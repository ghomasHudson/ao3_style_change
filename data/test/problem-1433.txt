“This must be some sort of a mistake, Teddy.” Harry sifted through the gifts. There was one present from Andromeda with matching wrapping paper as Draco’s gift, but then there were quite a few other gifts. He opened the tag on one of the gifts to see it was from Hermione.
“I think the hearth needs a good scrub, don’t you, sir?” Draco asked, swishing over to the fireplace before gracefully falling to his knees. Harry dropped his head back, closing his eyes. He was definitely going to crack first. Harry once again wondered why he’d ever thought it was a good idea to date a Slytherin.
“Seems that way. That’s great news, mate! I’m so happy for you. You deserve it.” Harry smiled, really meaning every word. He was so proud of his friend, and Ron had more than proved himself capable of the responsibilities that came with the job. Harry had no doubt the department was in safe hands with him.
Harry didn’t move for a long moment, afraid to come out from under the thick door that was likely imbued with centuries of Black family magic, probably just as Dark as whatever magic he had been attacked by.
Harry blinked again in quick succession, trying to calm down, and then lowered his wand slowly. There was no enemy there, no one to fight. Just Draco.
” Malfoy ran a hand through his hair, messing it up slightly. “I have the chocolate shipped in from Italy and stored in the kitchens in the Elvish stasis cabinets, which allows it to remain perfectly fresh as it would coming straight out of the Tuscan chocolaterie.”
“Absolutely. I saw nothing but you having it perfectly under control,” Draco stepped back and placed his hands on his hips, raising an eyebrow. “And what was it that your discharge papers said? Bedrest until Saturday?”
Harry’s cocktail went down smoothly, tasting mildly of cherry and some sort of citrus. When he looked up, Draco was looking intently at him, and Harry felt his cheeks heat, remembering Lila’s question—how she had assumed that they were interested in each other. While Harry had initially panicked at what she’d guessed about him, as that faded, he was increasingly aware of what she’d been suggesting. That his growing attraction was more obvious than he’d hoped.
“I’ve been waiting for a while for this scene,” Draco says softly. His eyes are hungry but still soft.
Harry turns, facing Draco, and brushes a strand out of his hair. Draco looks younger and more relaxed than Harry’s seen him in a long time.
Harry cleared his throat and let out a nervous laugh. “We’ll clean it up, Teddy. Don’t worry. We just, erm— had a few issues with the recipe.”
Harry thought back to their own lessons and the difference between when Hermione was helping them versus when it was just him and Ron.
Harry opened his mouth to argue that he could help, but a large yawn came out instead. “Okay, thanks.” He started toward the bedroom and then turned to Draco who was slowly creeping up the stairs. “Hey, Happy Christmas.”
“How was your trip?” Draco asked as he flicked his wand toward the turkey, starting the knives at carving off several pieces.
Before long they are both moaning and sweating as Harry holds on to the sides of the sink tightly to keep his balance. The poorly seated sink rocks back and forth in time with Draco’s thrusts. Harry mentally adds better securing the sink to the wall to his to-do list, but then Draco changes the angle, hitting Harry just right, and he cries out, quickly forgetting his household issues.
The only ones missing were Charlie and Teddy, both in Romania—their lives firmly wrapped up in the dragon sanctuary. After a childhood of positively revering the Dragon Tamer, Teddy had decided to follow in his footsteps. And although he showed nothing but outward support for his godson, Harry secretly wished Teddy had picked a career that was slightly less deadly and slightly closer in location. But they both still came back for holidays, even though they had made it clear, much to both Harry’s and Molly’s frustration, that their plans were to stay at the sanctuary until retirement.
“Hey Hagrid,” Harry said, with a smile. “Sorry I haven’t taken you up on tea yet, I’ve been a bit busy this week.”
Once they were in the fresh air, he decided to walk. His eyes were feeling scratchy from the dry Ministry air and staring too long at paperwork.
“What if they didn’t touch the food and just levitated it out of there?” Harry asked, wondering how this was going to work after all the spells had miraculously disappeared on the food.
Harry pushed down the nausea that was threatening to overwhelm him, remembering how he’d left things the previous day, and walked over.
Harry tugged at his collar, feeling claustrophobic from both the topic and the overlapping conversations.
“Yeah.” Harry watched as his mirror version leaned back, a hand trailing down Draco’s chest before hooking a thumb in his trousers. He watched the way his reflection smiled, the way Draco smiled back—easy and relaxed.
Harry tilted his head, trying to figure out how a muggle children’s toy had made it into Hogwarts storage. “It looks like a Magic 8-Ball.”
Harry rolled his eyes. Head Auror Robards rarely got involved in Auror cases unless someone was screwing up. He was usually too busy kissing the arse of the Minister and other higher-ups throughout the Ministry to get involved in the daily work.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, dropping a quick kiss on the corner of Draco’s lips. “I have to go meet Ron.”
“Yet another escaped creature. We’re up to six or seven, I think; there’s a list somewhere in the staff room. The worst was the Billywig—floating students everywhere and trying to catch a tiny insect in a castle this size proved impossible. Although,” Malfoy added, the corner of his lips quirking up, “watching Trelawney attempt to eat dinner while levitating above her chair was nearly worth it.”
Harry slid down the door, coming to a rest in front of Draco, and reaching forward to caress his cheek with a thumb. “I’m yours.”
Once upon a time, this would have been exactly his scene, but the war and the aftermath had taken any joy out of gladhanding. While he had managed to slowly and steadily work his way back to tolerable to most of Wizardkind, Draco had learned over the years that was best done while keeping his head down. The more he stayed out of sight, the more time people had to forget about him. He’d show up at the required events, make sure his boss saw him there, and wait for the earliest moment he could slip out unnoticed. The plan worked well.
“Maybe we’ll make some small ones tomorrow for Christmas morning, but only if we also have something healthy to go with it. How’s that sound?” Harry offered.
It wasn’t quite time for dinner, so Harry decided to wander the city for a bit; he stashed his Auror robes into his satchel and shrugged his coat on. The air was chilly but refreshing.
Harry hadn’t really thought about it, but supposed Ginny was right. Teaching was teaching, whether it was helping Teddy ride a broom, or Rose with her defence homework over breaks, or a whole bunch of Hogwarts students before a war broke out.
“Excellent,” Draco said with a glint in his eye and then leant forward and placed a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips. Before they could get any further, his phone buzzed on the bedside table.
“Okay, fine, but it still didn’t work,” Harry said, unwilling to continue this pointless argument for one more minute. “So what’s next?”
dark wash jeans, and tattoos peeked out from beneath the collar and short sleeves of his purple t-shirt. Harry’s eyes travelled to his left forearm to see only more tattoos, the Dark Mark no longer distinguishable in the chaos of colour and pattern.
“One day, after I’d expressed my absolute disinterest in marrying a woman, any woman, he’d sat me down to talk about how to keep lovers discreetly. And really, my father saying the word ‘lovers’ was the most traumatising part of that conversation.” Draco shuddered melodramatically.
“She’s pretty young, just a couple years out of Hogwarts, so it looks like she was one of the newer recruits. She’s not the ring leader, if that’s what you mean,” Ron replied.
Draco huffed a laugh and buried his face in Harry’s chest. “I’ll have you know that I do not actually want a house in the suburbs.”
They shook their heads, and Harry sent them off to practice, turning himself on the broom to keep an eye on them. He also took out his wand to have at the ready, wanting to avoid any more trips to the infirmary for the week. He knew there would likely be more injuries at some point—these were flying classes, after all—but he hoped he could at least space them out a bit more.
“When I got the inheritance, I kind of thought I might want to buy a pub. I’d assumed I’d exchange the money and get a Muggle one. But the London market is already over-saturated and the profit margins are thin, and even though I have enough now for it to not be much of a risk, I want to run a successful business.”
After a few minutes of fighting like children, they finally settled back onto the swing again, gently rocking. Harry already felt relief from telling her—committing to this change, even if he wasn’t ready for it. Something had to give. He knew he couldn’t keep living like this.
Harry glanced over to see Malfoy looking at him intently. True to his word, his expression wasn’t mocking. Every part of his brain was screaming not to give Malfoy more to mock him about, but at the same time, he really could use the help. “It’s the number of students. For the first and second-year classes—the rest are mostly fine, but I’ve got forty students who don’t know the basics.”
“I know. We ran the tests twice since we knew there hadn’t been any traces of magic other than household spells also.” Scott shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what to tell you. There was nothing.”
“Not even Robards?” Harry asked, surprised. Of the two of them, Ron was more likely to follow the chain of command.
After a beat, a few students walked over to the area indicated and dropped their brooms. Emily quickly followed and looked relieved the minute her broom hit the ground. A few others sighed dramatically, looking put out, but all of the students complied in the end.
Harry rolled his eyes and pulled another heavy cloth off a pile of furniture. More damaged portraits were piled on an antique desk. The inhabitants all seemed to have cleared out, so Harry levitated them to the growing pile in the corner.
After his last orgasm, Draco checked in with Harry and then gave him a break from the restraints, letting his limbs relax as he drank some water. Draco also gave him a reinvigoration potion for his muscles, making sure he wasn’t cramping or injuring himself with all the pulling and thrashing. Like most of their gear, the restraints are spelled with protection spells to make sure there’s no injury, but it’s been a long day in the same position. Then he strung him back up, just as tightly as before.
He came to a few times, once getting up for a late lunch that Draco had prepared, and a couple of times to use the bathroom, but he mostly spent the day in a groggy state, napping on and off. It was easier with Draco there, he noticed. While the case was still bouncing around the back of his brain, it was the first time he’d felt safe enough to let his guard down.
“Oh…” Draco coughed and stepped back before turning sharply towards the door. “I need to go—sorry, I just… I can’t—”
“Hey Draco, stop flirting and help me out!” Lila hollered. Harry looked up and realised the bar had got significantly more full.
Harry read through the list until everyone was sorted into one of ten colours, and sent them on their way. Now, he just needed to hope that he put them into groups that would work. While he didn’t know the students well, yet, he’d gotten enough of a sense of friends and rivals over the past two classes. He tried to separate both, putting each of them with students that they’d neither be tempted to antagonize nor just fool around with. With this group, he’d mixed the two houses, but in his afternoon class, he would have the Gryffindors and Slytherins on opposite sides of the field, just for his own sanity.
Draco made a noise that sounded like disbelief, before leaning his shoulder against the building and looking past Harry down to the street. The light of the streetlamps bounced off the wet pavement and the air smelled like it might have rained while they’d been inside. Harry hadn’t noticed before, too stuck in his own fuzzy thoughts.
Harry looked at the family and back at Edwards. “Can you stay with them and keep communicating? See if they need anything?”
Harry walked the perimeter of the room, looking for the least dusty boxes or stacks of parchment. He settled on a stack near the desk; it would have been easily accessible for someone sitting nearby. Pulling the large pile off the shelf, he sat on the floor and started to spread stuff out. Across the room, Draco was doing similarly with a basket of rolled up parchment. From the broken wax seals, they looked to be owl correspondence.
Draco’s collected composure fell away, and Harry could see the pain in his grey eyes, clear as day. But there was something else there too. So, taking a chance, Harry tentatively got up from the bed and walked over to Draco. He slowly wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist, keeping him from running away. He gently cupped Draco’s face with his other hand, brushing his thumb gently over his cheek.
Draco glances in the first bedroom as he passes by; James is engulfed in one of his video games. No matter how many times James has tried to explain, Draco still doesn't understand it the game. It involves something with blocks and building and that’s about all he took away from the many conversations. He always lets his son show him all the buildings and creations he makes on the game, but even James knows it’s a bit lost on him. Albus and Scorpius are in their bedroom, whispering in hushed voices, most likely not cleaning, but Draco doesn’t have the energy to fight with them any more about it at the moment. The five-year-olds are a perpetual handful, so he’ll take any moment of quiet he can get.
After Harry finished working the end of that rope, he put one firm palm on the middle of Draco’s back and the other on his chest, gently pushing Draco onto his back. Draco slowly lowered himself, surprised when his wrists and head hit a large soft pillow instead of the hard wooden floor.
So, Harry pushed down the thoughts as best he could. He tried to not stare too much when Draco helped Teddy into his new Christmas jumper that Molly must have sent over with Harry’s presents. Then, he tried not to flush too deeply when Draco watched him open his own presents. And reminded himself to get a grip when Draco and Teddy wrestled for an unclaimed candy cane that had fallen off a present, both of them laughing until they were red in the face.
Harry followed him down the hall and into a flat that was already full of people, low thudding music filling the space. It was surprisingly spacious for a London flat and felt immediately inviting, decorated in warm colours. There were several groups of people hanging out in different areas of the sitting room and a few people on what looked like a small balcony. Lila waved at them from her spot on the sofa and Harry trailed behind Draco as he greeted people and introduced Harry.
“I see it—everyone calm down!” Harry shouted over the chaos. “Mount your brooms and fly up about 10 feet so I can deal with it.”
Before he could get back to it, Mel burst through the door. She closed the door behind her and stopped, looking at Harry with a large smile spread across her face.
“Fine, but I’m calling a cab,” Draco said, pulling out his phone. Before Harry could protest further, Draco was already giving someone on the other end of the call an address.
Once he got to the letters that were about changing or closing out existing connections, he found a few requests in some of the folders, but those folders were far more full. So, it was probable that these weren’t the requests from Lucius’s letters as Harry doubted that the elderly witch in Bridlington or the robes shop in Brighton were likely candidates. Nonetheless, he still made notes of every missing file and duplicated the ones he did find.
"Okay, okay, love,” Harry said, making quick work of the final ropework around his wrists and then helping Draco lower his arms, massaging the limbs. “We’re all done. I’m going to help you to the bed.”
“Oh, can I?” Harry asked, flatly. “ I have Quidditch try-outs—all day. I do actually have work responsibilities, you know.”
“Auror Potter,” Quarrington said, clasping Harry’s hand and shaking it firmly. “You and Auror Shaw have done incredible work. The whole Ministry is grateful for the work you’ve done here.”
.” Harry sent a ball of light off to the far end of the room, and then repeated the spell several times illuminating the large warehouse in bright light.
He groaned but couldn’t help a smile from creeping up his face. For all her brashness, Ginny was a good friend, and he knew that was just an excuse to keep him company so that his nerves didn’t get the best of him.
Draco dropped a t-shirt and flannel pyjama bottoms on the bed before gesturing awkwardly to the door and walking out, closing the door behind him.
“Professor! Help!” Harry spun to see one of the Hufflepuffs dangling from their broom as it rose slowly but steadily upwards.
Harry sighed as he stood up; it didn’t really matter now. The man was dead. He hoped it was painful.
Harry’s chest ached, emotions warring—relief, excitement, fear, all clashing together at once. But it was right. He knew this was right.
“I’m currently undressing you.” Harry turned to watch Draco’s reaction, but he only rolled his eyes.
Harry slowly unwrapped the end of one of the rope bundles before scooting over to Draco. Harry then wrapped his hands around Draco’s wrists, which were still crossed behind his back, and lifted his arms over his head, pulling Draco’s wrists down until they were crossed at the nape of his neck. Draco already felt exposed, vulnerable, in the position.
. He knew he couldn’t have it, not really. Not with his name and fame. But fuck if he didn’t still yearn for it. He was sure his reaction to Malfoy was just that—envy at what the other man had.
“No. Everyone understood why I did it, but that didn’t mean Pearce didn’t have a case. Since it had happened at a game during official press time, he was going to sue the team and rumour had it, he was going to sue the league next since I hadn’t suffered any repercussions.”
“So, we have no leads, no sign of any kind of magic that could kill or even mildly harm someone, no signs that he died of natural causes, and no signs of potions or even potion ingredients?” Harry looked at Scott again, hoping for any contradiction.
As Harry starts to calm, distressed yells turning to low whimpers, he feels Draco run a soothing hand up and down his side. When he looks up, Draco is looking at him insistently, a bit of awe in his eye.
“Okay, well we found two possible magical causes that wouldn’t be traceable: first, a Markupo attack.” She slid some photos and information down the table towards Harry. He took the photo of a colourful and very large serpent-like creature and pinned it to the wall.
“I won’t keep you too long, I know you all have plenty of beginning of semester business to attend to.” Minerva gave them a small smile. “As most of you know, we’ve finished the repairs on the western fourth-floor corridor after the plumbing incident. That has been opened back up to the students. We’ve also received the new defence books for the library that were requested by Professor Chaumont, so those are available for the students.”
Draco pressed his lips together for a moment, the silence dragging out, until he finally asked, “Will you go to dinner with me tonight?”
“She dated Foxley until this summer. What are the chances she suddenly joined the Neo-Death Eater cult out of the blue?”
“Okay, we have a change of plans,” Ron said. “You and Mel need to stay here—Auror Hardy’s coming with us to make the arrests at the Ministry.”
didn’t work,” Harry replied, pulling out a chair from one of the tables and sitting down with a plop.
“How about the rest of the weekend? Do you think you could do that for me, Harry? Be a good boy and wear it for two whole days? While I tell you how gorgeous you look?”
Harry drops his head down and watches as Draco’s finger moves downward, running along the bottom of Harry’s cock, now straining against the fabric. Even though Harry knows there’s little chance that Draco’s going to let him come any time soon, his body continues to respond, aching for a harder touch, for more friction.
He’s vaguely aware of Draco stepping away, moving around the room. He’s too tired to lift his head, so he just listens as Draco shuffles through items on the table.
He sat down at his desk and started organising their case paperwork. He knew better than to start trying to talk to her before she’d had copious amounts of caffeine.
Harry sighed and watched as an expression of sadness fell over his face. It was no matter, he thought, stepping back from the sink and over to the toilet.
When Draco gets to the master bedroom, he gently pushes open the cracked door. His husband is sprawled out on the bed, face down. Harry desperately needed a nap after being up half the night with the twins after one of them had a nightmare. His face is relaxed with sleep, his t-shirt riding up his back, his joggers set low, showing just the start of the curve of his arse. He looks so young like this. And all of Harry’s Quidditch training over the years has not fallen off, his work as a coach still keeping him in shape.
Harry stood and rushed to comply, far too turned on to try to be sexy about it. His wrists got caught in his sleeves when he forgot about Draco’s cufflinks; he nearly lost his balance as the unfamiliar trousers started sliding down his legs. After some fumbling and swearing, Harry finally managed to divest himself of Draco’s robes and shirt, tossing them in a pile on the floor. His heart pounded as the cool office air moved across his nearly naked frame.
Harry’s arms stretched above his head to the corners, tied off at the wrists to the table legs below. His legs were bent at the knee, stretched to their limits, rope coiled around his calves and the table legs in turn. He could barely move an inch. Harry’s cock had hardened almost immediately, and from the look on Draco’s face, he hadn’t missed it either.
A moment later, he stumbled out of the other end of the Floo into the Ministry lobby and took a minute to catch his breath. His body ached from the travel, but after a moment, his head cleared enough to head to the lifts. Just a day at his desk, nothing too strenuous. He passed a few Ministry employees and nodded hello in their direction. Fortunately, anyone going into work on a Saturday was generally not inclined to stop for conversation.
Harry shook with laughter watching Teddy climb on Draco while simultaneously trying to pull the jumper over his head. He was pretty sure that was the armhole stretching around the top of Draco’s head.
Harry sighed. “I’m feeling better this morning. And there are still reports that need to be filed.” As much as he didn’t want to go in, there was work to be done.
“Adrastos. I am son of Aeneas and brother of Agata. You saved them today too,” the elf replied. “I can help you—I’m not so weak that my magic won’t work.”
“Well,” Bradbourn said, passing a few copies of a parchment around the table. “We were unable to find any other magical possibilities that wouldn’t have left spell residue or potion traces in the time frame, but we looked into some Muggle possibilities.”
The lighting was dim in their playroom—only about half of the torches were lit and the heavy crimson drapes were pulled over the curtains. Harry sat in the middle of the floor, cross-legged, with several bundles of matching deep blue rope in front of him. He smiled when he saw Draco and patted the floor next to him.
Harry arches his neck back as Draco hits his prostate dead on and then pushes in deep, and then Draco starts a quick pace. He pants over Harry, a bead of sweat dripping off his nose. Harry needs to come so badly, every hit and drag to his prostate making him more desperate. He babbles plea after plea, but it’s not enough.
“So are you going to try to convince me that you are still just friends? Nothing more? Let me guess, you’re sharing a bed platonically?” She asked, with a teasing grin.
a King? What if he got to feel Draco’s hand this one last time for a bit longer before they found out the end result?
Harry wrapped his hands around it, soaking up the warmth through the ceramic, and decided to get it over with.
Harry turned it over in his head. It was a good offer. He’d be able to stay in the department, still see Mel and his other work friends, but there would be no more cases. No tracking down the worst of wizarding kind and being surrounded by all of it.
Harry glanced at his reflection in a window as they walked past and grimaced. His hair was a mess; his tan coat washed out his light brown complexion, making him look a bit sickly. He really needed some new clothes. It was something Ginny had been teasing him about increasingly as of late—particularly when she’d had a few drinks and started badgering him about “getting out there and finding someone.” He glanced over at his partner. She fitted right in with her brown leather bomber jacket layered over a check shirt and jeans, her short light brown hair stylishly dishevelled.
Draco left his hand loose around Harry’s cock, just enough to tease, and with his other hand then slid the two cards to the right.
“There!” Neville lifted up the freshly potted plant and set it on a shelf to the side, putting his gloved hands on his hips and looking at them with a smile. “What are you two doing out here?”
“We got everyone at the Ministry,” she said, the satisfaction clear in her voice. “Weasley pulled Robards into interrogation almost immediately. And I don’t know how, but he convinced him to take Veritaserum, so we got a full list of everyone involved at the Ministry.”
“So, come,” Draco replied, sounding bored, as he wrapped his fingers around Harry’s cock and started pumping.
“Morning.” Harry turns to his side and wraps his arms around his partner, enjoying the warmth of the other man as he pulls him tight.
“Of course, we’ll come get him in the morning,” Draco says, trying to keep the disappointment of his ruined morning plans out of his voice. “Thanks again, Molly.”
“Where have you been staying, then? I asked Ron if you needed a place to stay, and he got a bit cagey with me.”
After a minute, Draco finally managed to get the jumper on properly and cast a spell at his hair, which Harry and Teddy both were disappointed to see tamed it quite well, all traces of static gone. Harry couldn’t help but like it when Draco was just a little less buttoned-up, a little dishevelled.
Harry whimpered and forced himself to look down when the next card was flipped. Jack of Clubs. Sweat beaded down his temple. It should be lower but given the last round, he couldn’t be sure.
He got to his bedroom and opened the wardrobe looking for something to change into. Normally, he just threw on the first thing he saw, but he remembered too clearly that uncomfortable feeling from the previous day. He cringed as he pushed through his Muggle clothes that were shoved to the one side of the wardrobe.
“No, I understand. I mean, we’ve come a long way since queer folks had to code messages to their lovers for fear of getting arrested by the Ministry, but there are still bigots and arseholes out there.”
“I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I wasn’t myself, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Draco added, gently.
“As much as I’m enjoying this, classes ended fifteen minutes ago,” a smug voice called out from behind Harry.
Harry hands him some Floo powder, and Draco’s last thought as he swirls through the Floo directly to St Mungo’s is that he’s feeling perfectly sober now.
He opened the door to Draco in a black wool coat with a blue scarf wrapped around his neck, his pale face and hair almost glowing in the light from the street lamps. Harry must have stood there for too long, as eventually, Draco raised an eyebrow as the corner of his lip quirked up.
Harry nodded shakily. Just as he opened his mouth to reply, Draco returned, carrying several glasses with practised ease.
Once Harry was done, Draco could no longer place his foot flat on the floor, as the heel was pushing into the bottom of his arse cheek. But it seemed Harry already had plans for this position, and Draco felt his foot pushed into a pointed position before being tucked under his arse. Then, his leg was slowly lowered to the floor, calf tucked underneath. His thigh stretched and burned from the motion, but eventually, it rested on the ground, forcing Draco’s lower half into an arch.
Harry’s nerve endings were on fire as his skin cooled from the trace of Draco’s tongue and he shivered, making everything more intense.
He scooped up another finger full and held it back up to Harry, who once again licked and sucked Draco’s finger clean.
“Okay,” Harry said brightly before turning back to Paulo. “It looks like a Wasps game, it is. And just send us an owl and we’ll meet you wherever you want for dinner.”
“Just hold on one minute, and I’ll take you to the infirmary,” Harry said before turning to the two other students. A quick assessment showed that the one student seemed to be just a bit bruised up, but Harry sent him to the infirmary for a full check-up anyway.
“I don’t know. I don’t really want it, honestly. Which I can’t believe I’m even saying that.” He let out a humourless laugh. “If you’d told me that fifteen years ago when I was barely scraping by and crashing on friends’ sofas…”
For a moment, nothing happened, and Harry started to turn, about to ask Draco what on earth he was seeing, but then he saw it. It started with a small movement, one he wasn’t making. He watched as his reflection reached out, slipping his hand in the hand of Draco’s reflection. For a moment, it seemed that it might stay like that, but then Harry watched as his mirror-self turned and pulled the other man towards him, leaning in, a hand coming up to stroke a cheek. He couldn’t look away as his reflection closed the distance, as they kissed.
It wasn’t like it was going to hurt him to read through some files. He could certainly do that while he was laid up in bed.
A few minutes later, the heavy steel door opened with a bang and people started streaming into the space. Someone opened the loading doors at the front of the building, and Harry could see swarms of teams in action out on the street—MLE officers, Healers in their field robes. As soon as the MLE officers relieved Bradbourn, starting to transport the criminals to Ministry holding cells, Harry headed to the front of the building where Auror Naomi Hardy was directing all the other teams.
Instead, Draco forced himself to stay still, focusing on how the rope felt as it wrapped around his skin, the feather-light touch of the loose ends as they brushed his back, the touch of Harry’s fingers as they worked the rope.
Harry closed his eyes, trying to settle down his body as he listened to the chair scape against the floor, the sound of a quill scratching following shortly after. The plug sped back to life.
“So, what you are saying is that I should turn Malfoy Manor into a raging gay club?” Draco replied, breaking out into a grin.
Draco stretched awake, slowly sitting up. Harry rummaged for some socks in his duffle, avoiding looking at Draco. He was finding himself increasingly flustered around the man whenever he was in his pyjamas. There was something about the rumpled groggy look about him that was just so soft, felt too intimate.
They had spent much of the day in the same position: Harry laying down on the sofa with his head propped up on a cushion and his feet pulled up on Draco’s lap. Draco’s arms were a comforting weight on Harry’s shins. The nervous energy Harry had been struggling with for the past few days finally subsided enough for him to actually relax and rest.
Draco flipped the next card. Six of Spades. Harry braced for the smacks, letting himself moan freely now. Draco sucked on his throat, and Harry could tell his composure was slipping as well. And god if that wasn’t hot. Knowing that being taken apart like this, that baring all his basest desires could unravel Draco’s well-curated composure was a heady sort of power for Harry. The kind he actually liked, the kind that felt real and visceral. To Harry, it felt like just as much of a gift to him as Harry’s submission was to Draco.
Harry whimpers, his body shaking with the need to come, as Draco continues to stroke him in firm motions. He’s unable to stop the thrust of his hips again, crying out as his bollocks stretch from his body. But he can’t stop. His hips continue to rock, even as his bollocks are pulled painfully tight in the process as he chases his release.
She landed with a soft thud and put her hands over her face. “I’m sorry. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, Professor.”
Harry let out an exhale, hoping that wasn’t a rule he’d missed. “No, sir.” He then felt Draco’s breath hit his neck.
Draco made a noise, possibly of protest, so Harry paused, his hands still mid-way down Draco’s shirt. He watched Draco as Draco watched the mirror, his cheeks flushed and the tips of his ears bright red even as his pupils were blown wide.
Draco tried to flex his muscles, push and pull against the restraints, but his limbs were unable to move—fixed in place by the unyielding ropes that pressed into his skin.
On his way, he checked his phone and saw several messages from Ginny and Hermione, both checking that he was coming to dinner at the Weasleys on Friday night for Arthur’s birthday. He quickly tapped out a reply in the affirmative to both of them while he walked to the pub, nearly running into several people and getting an earful about it from a very old woman who ranted about “young people, these days,” as he ducked around the corner from her.
After a few minutes of self-indulgence under the hot spray, he washed up and turned off the shower. He spelled his clothes clean and tossed on his pants and t-shirt, bundling up the rest of his clothes and carrying them back to Draco’s room. The alarm he’d initially felt at the upcoming raid had settled into a dull throb.
“I know, but he has a lot of connections here. He’s a high-profile wizard with a lot of Ministry ties. The
“Okay, then, see yeh later. Bye, Harry.” Hagrid turned and left, and Harry found himself feeling a bit off-kilter. He’d no idea they got along, let alone had tea together.
“Do you think you have any come left?” Draco asks in a low voice. “Will you dribble some out, or are you already dry?”
The students who had been on the ground quickly mounted their brooms and joined the others in the air. Harry pulled out his wand and cast an Incarcerous, not wanting to injure the thing with a stunner. Just before his spell hit, the bird disappeared with a pop.
“In many ways, that was much more special than the things I’d asked for. I think it was because I knew she thought of me,” Draco continued. “When she was busy with society events or shopping for new robes, or when I was off to Hogwarts, I knew she was still thinking about me.”
“Is this coming from the Public Opinion of Ministry Performance department? Because they hate when the Ministry gets any kind of press that isn’t sparkling and complimentary,” Harry said, with annoyance.
Once Draco had finished all the surfaces within Harry’s view, bending over at every opportunity, he flicked his wand, the feathers disappearing. Another flick and a fluffy white cloth popped out.
“He obviously had to readjust his plans after the war,” Draco said with a humourless laugh. “But it was always all laid out for me. What I would do, what relationships I would build, how I could get involved at the Ministry… who I would marry. He even had opinions on the ideal number of offspring. So being gay certainly didn’t help, but it wasn’t only that. He didn’t see my sexuality as anything but an inconvenience, really. I would have still been expected to marry someone of his choosing, given him at least one heir.
“No, it’s not that.” Harry sighed and looked up at the ceiling. “I just didn’t know how. I’d kept it a secret for so long that I didn’t even know how to talk to anyone about it. And then I ran into Draco…”
“For Robards?” Ron asked with a shake of his head. “It seems like it was about power, money and influence, mostly. Apparently Janus Jyce, for all his privacy, had a lot of connections in the Ministry and originally got Robards involved with promises of promotions. Starting with Head Auror.”
Exhausted, he finally collapsed on a nearby bench and dropped his head into his hands, fighting back the tears. After all this, the only person he wanted to talk to was Draco. He could tell himself it was just friendship, a close friendship—that it was enough. But Harry knew exactly what his feelings had grown into, for better or worse.
“What?” Mel walked over to his desk to peer over his shoulder. “No traces? How is that possible? He didn’t just drop dead!”
They made small talk while Harry waited on his pint, Draco going on about how someone could make a killing bringing just a little bit of Muggle culture to the wizarding pub scene. Once Harry retrieved his drink from the bar, he sat back down and looked at Draco, noticing the lines of stress and a slight frown.
Harry nodded to Edwards, who lifted his wand before performing another complicated gesture. The parchment swirled before the words reformed. Then a soft voice read out the message in what Harry assumed to be Serbian. The werewolf family listened intently and Harry could see some of the strain leave their shoulders at the message.
Harry nodded and gave him a small smile. As he sat there, the decision having been made, the dread started to recede and his muscles started loosening. With every passing moment, he knew he’d made the right call.
Harry presses his lips together looking like he’s holding back a laugh. “I think we definitely need to get it checked out, but I don’t think it’s permanent, love.”
“Sure,” Harry replied, smiling a bit at the idea of Draco riding the tube. No matter how much he saw the change in the man and knew he’d been living amongst Muggles nearly his entire adult life, he just couldn’t quite get over the dissonance.
The boy nodded, and Harry had him move his hand away so that he could cast a quick diagnostic spell. Fractured ribs. A painful injury but Madame Pomphrey would be able to patch those right up.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry replied, a smile tugging at his lips at just how much everything had changed since school.
“Yeah, well, the owner of the Falcons and the league were good at keeping things quiet. Basically, I became too much of a screw up for them.” Harry smiled with a sardonic shrug and headed towards the pub.
“She was devastated. And I felt really bad after it happened. Even if I was a spoiled brat, I didn’t actually like hurting her. But I was too panicked to care for long because her brother said he was telling and ran off to the house.”
woke up together when it was one of their birthdays. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he looked around the room, searching for signs of where Harry might have gone. He hoped the man knew better than to make him breakfast instead of waking him up with a birthday blowjob. There were priorities on birthdays, after all.
The engagement to Astoria Greengrass had been the result of what appeared to be very serious blackmail. Harry couldn’t work out exactly what Lucius had on the man, but it was clear that it was big enough to cost him a forced marriage of his youngest daughter. Worse yet, Draco’s proclivities had come up at length through the correspondence, and not in kind terms by either party. Once he reached the end of the stack, feeling decidedly nauseous, he looked up to see Draco shaking slightly, looking like he was on the verge of crying.
Harry headed over to the staff pantry, running through his to-do list in his head as he grabbed an apple off his shelf. Shoving some of the other fruit to the side, he looked for his yoghurt. It wasn’t there. Again. He put his apple back down to free up his hands and proceeded to dig through half the shelves to see if it had been moved.
Harry lets his head hang, his entire body spent. He stares at the wall, at the bed in the corner that's upside down from his vantage point. He's utterly spent.
Harry lifted his wand but then hesitated. “Does it bother you? I mean, we can do things the Muggle way, if you’d prefer.”
He turned off the taps and wiped his hands on Draco’s expensive trousers, only a little out of spite. He got a few lingering looks on the way back to their office— earlier that morning, once word had got out, they’d had a parade of Ministry workers who suddenly needed to walk very slowly by their office door.
“We’re sorry for your loss,” Mel said. “We understand if you need a moment, but we’ll need the names of your flatmates and your address.
Harry cleared his throat. “Not directly, but there’ve just been little things over the years. It’s not directed to me, but that doesn’t really matter. With so many brothers, it’s just, you know how brothers are with each other… Just joking about ‘not being gay’ when someone does something, I don’t know, it doesn’t even make sense half the time. And it’s not that big of a deal, it’s not like they use slurs, so I’m probably overreacting, but it just…” Harry trailed off, unable to really explain the things that have made him worried over the years. He couldn’t even remember every little incident, really; they were so small.
But he had to finish this. It was his job. But, more importantly, whoever was behind this was incredibly dangerous and Harry would never be able to live with himself if someone else—particularly someone he cared about, like Mel—got hurt.
His potions started to kick in, making him drowsy, but he fought to stay awake as he read through the messages from Draco. Harry felt a twist of guilt as he got further through them.
“Each team will have a zone and you are to stay in your zone. There’s enough room in each one for you to practice what we’ll be working on for the day. Understood?”
Draco’s eyes flit back and forth as he searched Harry’s face. “Yeah?” He let out a breath. “I still haven’t made a decision. I’m considering—well I’m not quite ready to talk about it yet; I will soon. But I just had to know.”
“Ah, well…” Ron pressed his lips together. “That case was supposed to go to Higgins and Perry. Robards had told me specifically to put them on it, but then your last case had just wrapped up, and they didn’t seem any closer to wrapping up the Neo-Death Eater case. So I moved some cases around. Robards was ticked off, but he’s always ticked off about something so I didn’t think much about it.”
Harry laughed, looking out across the grounds. It was a beautiful and warm mid-September day, and he found himself for the first time since arriving feeling at peace. Having that moment come while sitting on the steps to the castle talking Quidditch with Draco Malfoy was quite the surprise. Before he could follow that thought any further, he heard a pop and saw a blur of grey-blue run across the path.
“I want to show you something. I’m not sure— no promises on whether there will be anything of use, but could you meet me at the Manor Friday morning?” Draco asked.
Just as Draco’s internal strop was reaching epic heights, the bedroom door opened. Harry entered, fully dressed in jeans and a nice t-shirt and carrying a fair-sized present. Draco pulled himself to a seated position and crossed his arms across his bare chest.
Harry can’t stop the shiver that runs through his body. As much as being of service really does it for him, there’s nothing quite like being the centre of Draco’s attention—the intensity, the way the world narrows to just the two of them.
Harry glanced around the table to see that Neville and Filius had both subtly opened the books they’d brought along, extricating themselves from the conversation, so Harry was left with her undivided attention. He let out a small sigh and turned back to her, nodding.
“Stop.” Draco leaned forward resting his elbows on the desk. He looked Harry up and down while Harry forced his hand to still, letting it rest in place over his throbbing cock.
“Everyone agrees you're the best fit for the job,” Ron continued. “I know you weren’t particularly interested a few years ago, but we hope you’ll reconsider.”
“For me? Not much.” As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Harry realised that was a bit too honest so he hurried to change the topic. “So, what else do you do beyond work?”
His hand slipped past them; he paused and hesitated before running a finger along the lacy edge. This pair was a light blue, far skimpier than the rest as they curved up around his arse cheeks before dipping into his crack.
“How’s your work going, Hermione?” Harry asked, changing the topic. She worked tirelessly in her new position, and while Harry often worried she was running herself into the ground, he appreciated the passion she had for her work.
Taking a deep breath, Harry nudged his foot against the ground, pushing the swing into a slow rock. She wasn’t wrong. He’d thought about it—dating a Muggle to keep it away from hitting the wizarding news cycle. But if it ever got serious… he’d still need to tell his friends, Molly, and the rest of the Weasleys. And wasn’t that the point? For the relationship to get serious enough for that person to be a part of his life?
Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and cleared his throat. His hair stuck up in several places, and Harry felt such a surge of affection that he couldn’t stop himself from sliding off the chair, tangling himself in Draco’s lap and pulling him into a kiss.
After the trip to St Mungo’s, Draco spends a couple of weeks far too gun-shy to even attempt sex, and Harry can’t blame him. Even Harry's pretty traumatised by the whole thing and he wasn’t even the one injured. The Healer patched Draco right up after administering a sobering potion to him and Harry both with a judgmental look.
As Draco adjusts the angle, ramming into Harry's prostate. Moaning and throwing his head back, Harry feels his orgasm build, even as his cock goes untouched. But then there's a pressure as Draco’s hand wrap tightly around the base of his cock. He cries out. Fuck.
When he hears the Floo roar to life downstairs, Draco goes to the dresser and moves the needle on his old gramophone that he has hauled up from the sitting room just for the evening. A soft, relaxing violin starts just as Harry enters the room.
Harry looked at him flatly. “We needed to check. I know you haven’t been in contact with your father for a long time, but I still wanted to ask you some follow up questions about his friends or acquaintances. Maybe people that he’s had long relationships with that might have more information.” Harry knew it wasn’t a great starting place, but any lead at this point was something.
Harry nodded and continued drinking his tea. The war, their childhood—all of it was so long ago that they hadn’t really talked about any of it other than Draco’s issues with his parents. He was slowly becoming aware of how many potential landmines their new friendship still had; Harry didn’t really know where Draco stood on any of it. He knew Draco had changed his views quite dramatically about Muggles, Muggle-borns, and blood purity, but Harry had just assumed the rest had come with it.
Harry waited as Ron continued to read the rest of the names of some private citizens, some wealthy business people, some more Ministry workers, and knew when Ron saw it.
Before he managed to push it down long enough to ask Mel where they were at with the case reports, an interoffice memo came flying in, landing neatly on Harry’s desk. He unfolded it to see a message from Ron asking him to come see him when he got in.
Ron didn’t reply right away, looking off to the side. “I don’t know. Let’s worry about that later. We need to get you checked out at St Mungo’s and talk to the Aurors out here. This is still a crime scene.”
Before he could ask, another stack of letters was shoved in front of him, shaking slightly in Draco’s grasp. These were more recent, a negotiation with the Greengrasses, it appeared. And this time the stack included reply letters along with duplicated copies of Lucius’s originals. Harry made his way through the stack, his stomach turning in anger and disgust the longer he read.
“I’m staying until I see you dressed and in those tight-as-fuck jeans, Potter!” she hollered back with a laugh.
“I can’t—” she started, muffled in his robes, before sniffling sharply. “Maybe if I’d moved slower—not pushed everything through so fast.”
“Ok, sounds good. You finish the questions?” She put her quill down and cracked her knuckles, groaning.
As he started toward the door, Harry looked back. Draco sat on the bed, his knees pulled up to his chest, hugging a pillow in front of him—he looked lost, and Harry wanted to say fuck it all and stay with him.
“Top notch. This place might be better protected than the Ministry.” Mel cast a few other standard forensic spells, noting the results in her notebook.
Hopefully, Albus and Scorpius haven’t managed to do anything requiring another trip to St Mungo’s in the last ten minutes. At this rate, he’s surprised they aren’t qualifying for some sort of frequent patient status.
“It’s fine,” Draco cut him off. “This one’s on the house. Just the one though, Harry,” he said with a wink before heading to help another customer.
Harry’s breath hitches at another long drag along his prostate; his hips flex again, trying to get any friction.
“Oh, erm, same thing. But then students will need help, but when I go to one student, something else is happening behind me.”
They opened the door to a large room with a square bar in the middle and a variety of different sized tables scattered around the space. It was early, and the place was mostly empty. Quiet music and the sound of conversations bounced off the industrial ceiling and metal walls added to the noise. The occasional thud reverberated through the room, coming from up the stairs to Harry’s left. He could make out another door that seemed to be another business of some type.
After Quarrington was through the door, Ron sighed and flicked his wand to close the door. “Did you get checked out by a Healer?”
It appeared that Molly, Fleur, and Bill had made their way out to the back gardens, so Harry walked over to the sink and took a minute to collect himself in the empty kitchen. He knew they didn’t mean any harm, but he was so bloody sick of being nagged about his dating life, or lack thereof. Once he felt sufficiently under control, he opened up his texts to see two messages.
All Harry can do is shake his head, press his hands onto the desk as Draco thrusts into him hard. “No, sir.”
It was a skeleton crew for a raid this size. Aurors Williamson and Proudfoot were looking at the map, deep in discussion. Junior Aurors Naomi Hardy and Liam Bradbourn stood nearby, looking lost and a bit scared; Harry couldn’t blame them one bit.
Harry laughed at the boy’s single mindedness and cast a Tempus. It was a little after six, so Teddy had actually got a good amount more sleep. Harry, on the other hand, felt like he’d just been in a weird daze of a dream as every time he’d started to fall asleep more deeply, he’d been kicked awake. But he’d be back in his own bed that night, so he could sleep as long as he wanted. His chest tightened at the thought of going back to his empty house after this week. He was expected at the Weasley’s for Boxing Day, so he still had plenty of social activities on the horizon, but somehow that didn’t feel the same. Having people to wake up, to share meals with, to have lazy conversations with during the evening… it had been really nice.
Ron looked at him for a minute and then looked at Mel in exasperation. She was normally not any better at resting than Harry.
“Draco! It’s a tradition! You have to.” Teddy grabbed the jumper out of his hands and tried to put it on the man himself, with little success.
Harry knows somewhere back in his head that this is going to get more difficult from here—eventually, even his orgasms will become painful—but he’s slowly losing the ability to care about anything outside of the immediate moment. And right now, even though Draco has cancelled the heat spell and sent the feather back to the table, leaving only his hand, Harry’s unable to process anything other than how much Draco’s hand on his cock feels like absolute torture.
Harry blinked, stretching his limbs as he stood. His shoulders were sore from the position but he quickly moved his arms behind his back as he stood in position, waiting for Draco’s next instruction.
Harry made his way shakily back to the lift and down to his office. He saw Perry and Higgins down the hall but just nodded to them and entered his office, closing the door behind him and leaning against it. He took a moment to let himself take a deep, shaky breath and try to calm down his racing heart. God, he hated this. Not knowing who to trust, being forced to lie to his colleagues at the Ministry. He closed his eyes. It was all so much like the war. Too much like the war.
“Of course. Saturday will be perfect,” Draco replied as he ran through all the things he’d have to move around in his schedule.
“We have to go now—before Robards gets suspicious of where everyone is.” Ron checked his watch. “We’ve got everyone stable, but we can’t send anyone to St Mungo’s until the arrests are made.”
Harry’s heart sped up, unsure if he was more anxious if they’d caught the thief or not—for the first time, he really wondered about what they were actually going to do or say if they caught one of their colleagues had been stealing their food. What does one even say at that point? At the same time, he felt a growing panic that they’d inadvertently caused a bigger problem with their plant-scheme.
“Oh, erm—no.” It dawned on him for the first time that if Malfoy wasn’t actually involved, he likely didn’t know his father was dead. He sobered up quickly with the thought.
“Ugh, yeah.” Harry sat back. “I’m supposed to officially have it back in my possession tonight, after they finish with the last of the evidence gathering. The damage seems mostly limited to the ground floor and stairwell.”
Harry cleared his throat and stepped through the Floo, calling out his address, and a moment later, tumbled out in his own home.
A thought popped into Harry’s head, that he’d never seen Draco like this—of course, he’d never seen him in Harry’s body—but it was more than that. This was so much more intense, so much more intimate than anything they’d ever done. They’d never slowed down to watch, to really catalogue each other’s expressions and bodies. This obviously wouldn’t have been how Harry would’ve imagined it to happen, but it was so hot, so intimate. He had no idea when or if they’d ever have sex again—it had always been unplanned and spur of the moment. He decided at that moment that they would, if he had any say in it. And, next time, they’d do this all over again in their own bodies. As he watched Draco slowly losing control, his breathing becoming erratic, Harry could almost picture it—Draco’s white-blond hair falling over his eyes as his expression tightened and his orgasm built.
By the time Draco reaches his ticklish sides, Harry’s panting, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes.
“He’s sleeping on the sofa. Do you think you can be really quiet so we don’t wake him?” Harry asked, knowing that might be a big ask even when Teddy was in a good mood.
“Savage retired. His injuries are pretty extensive. He’ll be okay, but it might be months before he has full use of his right leg.”
Harry screwed up his eyes and shook his head. He didn’t. It was torture, but well within what he could take, well within what he wanted, no matter what his body screamed at the moment.
Harry felt Draco’s hands wrap around him, pulling him closer as he deepened the kiss, not pulling away for some minutes.
Harry nodded, his heart caught in his throat as he watched Draco slowly lower himself, dropping a kiss on Harry’s inner thigh. Harry dropped his head back, closing his eyes as he felt soft pressure and then a massaging touch as Draco worked the lube around Harry’s hole. Then there was pressure and Harry felt Draco’s finger slip in, slowly opening him up. After a moment he pulled out, and Harry looked up to see him adding more lube to his fingers.
Harry forced himself to take a breath before speaking. The Slytherin student reminded him so much of an eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy that he’d been having a hard time all lesson not snapping at the boy. While Alder could hardly have differed more in looks, with his dark complexion and the soft round lines of his face, he somehow managed to have an identical sneer as Harry’s once-rival. Still agitated from Malfoy’s non-stop needling of him since he arrived, Harry was finding his patience seriously taxed with the young Slytherin student.
Even though Minerva insisted they were both the best fit for the job at the time of the posting, Harry still believed that this was her way of taking care of them. They arrived at Hogwarts that September young, under-prepared, and far too broken.
“Just answer the question, and then we’ll explain.” After nearly two decades as an Auror, Harry knew to not rely too heavily on instinct alone. No one was infallible. But he was sure enough that they were about to bear the news of his father’s death.
“Harry, hey! There you are—I need you out back for a minute.” She grabbed him by the arm and dragged him out the back door.
Harry wondered what that would have like—parents that would have been proud of him for being cruel. Would he have been able to hold on to his sense of right and wrong? Would he have ever learned it in the first place? It bothered him that he didn’t know the answer.
While he got along with the majority of them, he definitely didn’t want to rehash how his first day went. He went to the staff pantry, which was lined with stasis charms for food preservation and stocked by the Hogwarts elves. He quickly found his area on the shelf, neatly labelled “Prof. Potter,” and grabbed one of the bananas he’d requested. He shuffled through the rest of the fruit, but the yoghurt was missing. That was odd. As he’d opted to take his lunch in the staff room rather than the Great Hall that first day, needing some quiet, he knew it had been in there at lunchtime. He glanced around the other shelves but didn’t see it anywhere.
While Harry inwardly panicked at what exactly Lila might be thinking, she slipped around the other side of the centre counter and out the entrance to the bar area before disappearing down a hallway towards the back of the pub.
Harry knew it was meant as a gesture to show he was joking, but Harry felt a warm flush run up the back of his neck even still. After clearing his throat, he took a long drink, draining about half of the cocktail.
All he’d ever wanted was to be normal. Just a normal wizard without a prophecy, without the fame and everything that came with being the “Chosen One.”
Draco put the glass on the bedside table and went back to his chest of drawers, pulling open the same drawer. He pulled out another pair of pyjama bottoms and t-shirt and then froze, seemingly thinking something through.
“For us,” Harry repeated, leaning over the booth and grabbing Draco’s collar before pulling him into a kiss.
Harry jerks in the restraints when it hits the soft inner flesh of his thighs; he groans when Draco warms up his chest and stomach. As he increases the intensity, Harry starts moaning—a near-continuous sound, desperate and free. He starts to get lost in it; even with the potion, the hits aren’t hard enough for real pain yet. So Harry lets himself sink into the sensation, only to be pulled out of it with a yelp as a sharp burn pierces through his nipples. Draco holds the chain connecting the two clamps as he brings the flogger down on Harry’s abdomen over and over, building intensity, until Harry’s moans become cries. The sensation of the soft tails moving from sensual to bruising.
Harry unrolled it. They were all from Severus Snape and appeared to have been written during Draco’s first few years at Hogwarts. While Harry only had the response letters to go off, it quickly became clear how much Lucius had meddled in his son’s education. At several points, Snape had even defended Draco from what must have been disparaging remarks about his son’s academic abilities. Once Harry finished with that scroll, he looked at the tall stack Draco had piled up next to him, wondering what else he’d tried to manipulate at Hogwarts.
“Just around the corner,” Lila replied after Harry asked for its location. She gave him a warm smile as he pulled himself up and unsteadily made his way down the hall. He was a bit more drunk than expected and had lost track of the number of drinks he’d had by that point.
Kevin had played on the Tornados before starting his own broom testing company, and the time away from professional play hadn’t impacted his physique at all. The guy was fit. In every sense of the word. He was also a flirt. Harry didn’t know if Kevin was gay or bi or just flirtatious in nature, but his behaviour threw Harry off his game something fierce.
“This…” Draco dropped wet kisses along Harry’s skin. “Is one of my favourite spots on the body.” He kissed along the skin just below the curve of Harry’s arse, mapping it out with his tongue as Harry whimpered beneath him, trying to hold still. “So sensitive to most people but so often overlooked.”
The interview rooms were all set up the same. An empty room except for a table with chairs on either side and a large floor-to-ceiling Charmed window on the wall behind where the Aurors sat. The Charmed window was actually a fully open space, allowing any observers to be in the same space as the interview, but the interviewee would be unable to see or hear them, unless they stepped through the Magical barrier.
Harry pulled his phone out of his pocket and sent off another message to Ron, responding to a question about availability and saying he was off to bed for the night but had a few more questions about the kids that he’d message him about in the morning.
“Well, haven’t you been telling me I should start getting used to them?” Draco asked, trying to keep the nervousness from showing on his face.
Draco pulled back, not wanting to wait another minute to try his new present. “Can we start now?” Draco asked, swinging a leg over Harry to straddle him before leaning over and pressing another kiss to his lips.
She laughed. “Well, let’s just say that the saying ‘sparks flew’ seemed very fitting in that moment—the way you looked at each other. And then when you told me that he’d given you access to the Manor, I’d wondered, actually.”
Once inside, he closed the door behind him and took stock of the office. Nothing stood out as being out of place immediately. Harry cast a few spells to see if someone had been sloppy, but none of his standard Auror spells detected any recent spellwork.
“Is that bad?” Harry asked, not remembering much about knarls other than they were often mistaken as hedgehogs.
With a calming breath, Harry finished undressing and stepped under the hot stream, letting the warmth soak into his sore muscles. At least it would all be over soon—no more missing witnesses or suspects and hopefully no more dead bodies. He was well past ready to close out this case, once and for all.
“Hello to you, too,” Harry said to Ron and Draco, cutting off yet another one of their never ending debates. When the two men had started to warm up to one another, Harry had expected they would make small talk over Quidditch, not argue the merits of Muggle conspiracy theories until they were blue in the face.
It’s just been one of those weeks. After spending the better part of Wednesday and Thursday dealing with magical plumbers and water damage specialists, Draco and Harry are exhausted. Molly’s agreed to take the kids for the night again while they go out to dinner and have an attempt at a date night.
As he slid onto a barstool, he saw two bartenders in the island area of the bar, a young man Harry hadn’t seen before, and the woman from the first day; he was pretty sure Draco had called her Lila.
“Potter.” She raised an eyebrow. “You know as well as I do that half those forms are just rewording the same shit in a different order for different records. We’ve got plenty of other people who can do that. And all of that can certainly wait until next week. We’ve both had a very rough couple of weeks. I’m planning on taking off early today, while I still have a position where I can do that,” she added with a smile. “I’m going to go celebrate with Jess and have a nice relaxing evening. So, you are going to gather your shit, leave the paperwork, and go find that boyfriend of yours.”
A layer of dust swirled through the air in the cavernous room. After nearly an hour of clearing out the space, they’d barely made a dent. Harry wiped his brow on the edge of his shirt sleeve, having discarded his Professor's robes only a few minutes into the task.
“What if it’s not a person?” Harry asked as they walked up the steps to the front doors, coming to a stop just inside the doors.
Once they were out of the main doors, Draco pulled him down the hall, to the hallway that wrapped around the side of the large event room—the one where they’d shared their first kiss. He pulled Harry further down the dark hallway and then pushed him up against the wall, kissing him roughly. Draco shoved his tongue in, not bothering with sweet or soft, holding Harry firmly in place with a hand on his strong chest, the other slipping around his body, pulling him close.
“We have a few things, but we don’t think any are very likely,” Auror Naomi Hardy started, looking nervous as she tucked one of her neat braids behind her ear and straightened the papers in front of her for the third time.
Harry grabbed that stack, dropping it on his desk and started rereading, sorting it into new piles. After he’d got through all of them, he noticed something. The Floo Network Authority pile was significantly larger than the rest. Harry let that spin in his brain for a minute, trying to decide if that was simply coincidence, after all that department needed to be contacted any time a change was made to a Floo address or someone moved. But Lucius certainly had never moved. In fact, even his summer home had been in his family for generations. Harry moved the other Ministry department files to the floor and spread out the letters and notes with Floo Network Authority references, now looking for something more specific, perhaps the reasons for contacting them.
A few of the house-elves hesitatingly made their way out of their large cage and started to explore the space.
Harry groaned. “Oh my god, this is a terrible idea. Are you going to be able to hold it together in the shops?”
“I think that can be arranged, Teddy.” Harry leaned down and pulled Teddy into a tight hug, before picking up his duffle and grabbing some Floo powder. He turned to Draco and nodded, giving the man a small smile. “Happy Christmas.”
“So good,” Draco said, still running his hands along Harry’s sides. “God, you feel perfect Harry. Let me know when you’re ready, love.”
Draco had a knack for story-telling. After years of watching him at Hogwarts, it was such a foreign experience for Harry to see it from this end. Harry distinctly remembered watching Draco reenact some of Harry’s more embarrassing moments at the Slytherin table, and he had no doubt Draco had done the same in his common room. So, Harry knew this was somehow a part of who the man was and always had been, but now tempered with age and a newfound humility, Harry was surprised at just how much he enjoyed his company. It was a strange thought to reconcile, as he watched the man, eyes bright with an easy smile on his face, animatedly tell a story about a particularly drunk patron who had attempted karaoke.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hands and then opened them back up, checking that nothing was compressed that shouldn’t be.
“Sounds good. Say ‘hi’ to Jess.” He shrugged off his robes, stowing them in his satchel, not wanting to hang out at the pub in uniform and put on his coat.
Foxley was in his mid-twenties, had gone to Hogwarts, and by all accounts was fairly boring. His parents lived in Leeds and were a middle-class wizarding family with no known skeletons in their closet. While the other missing lead, Astor, wasn’t pure-blood, he definitely kept the company of that society. But from everything the Aurors had dug up on Foxley, there was no connection there either—his family was mixed.
“No witnesses.” Mel flipped back a few pages in her pad. “His wife was at her gardening club and found him like this.”
Harry shot up, the wand in his hand pointing out. Harry blinked several times trying to register the situation as he stood, his wand levelled at Draco’s chest.
Harry hummed in agreement—he’d always been able to resist certain types of magic better than most other wix. It had first become noticeable when he’d been back at Hogwarts—the Imperius Curse, the allure of a Veela. But when he’d joined Auror training, it had become immediately apparent when he was often able to identify and fight past nearly all spells that were meant to trick the mind. Something about Harry made that particular kind of magic unable to get a firm grasp on him.
Then there was his adopted family. He had no idea how the other Weasley’s would take it. He didn’t think any of them were overtly homophobic, but there were little things… Molly had clear ideas about what she expected for her children’s lives and by extension his. A marriage, children, a traditional family. And the off-handed comments here and there by other members of the family over the years was just enough to spike fear into Harry and bring to the surface those fears deep in his soul. That he was wrong. abnormal. a
“Some people,” Draco continued as Harry felt his tongue flick out, teasing the small dark nub, sending shock waves through him, “don’t have sensitive nipples at all. So playing with them just doesn’t do much for them.”
Draco’s hips attempted to buck up, not making it far in his current position. Harry tsked and let go, going back to the single finger running up and down his cock.
Several complicated emotions flickered over Molly’s face until she finally settled on a somewhat forced smile. “Well, a Malfoy, hmm—well, it’s been a long time since the war, and I’m sure if you like him, he must be decent. Do you know what his favourite dessert is?” Before Harry could answer, her wand buzzed. “Oh, I need to check on the bread."
“It’s beautiful.” Harry pressed a kiss to his shoulder over one of the larger flowers, before dragging his finger along his back to a mandala just below the nape of his neck and traced the intricate circling pattern around scalloped edges and intersecting lines.
Draco nodded and took a drink of his pint. After a moment he looked at Harry’s t-shirt. “Did you have the day off?”
While he knew he’d probably feel better if he showered, he just didn’t have it in him. So instead, he pulled out his most comfortable pyjamas—a pair of worn checked bottoms and his softest t-shirt. He then rummaged through his clothes on the floor until he found his phone and wasn’t surprised to see that there still weren’t any messages. Harry understood, even though it hurt.
Harry flushed and pulled the glass in front of him. He took a long drink, trying to push down the general embarrassment of the last two days.
“Fuck,” Draco said, rubbing his hands on his face. “I don’t know why I’m so upset right now. I already knew how he felt about me. And I’m clearly an idiot for still caring about his opinion.”
Harry took a sip, taking a moment to savour the warmth travelling through his body. He could feel some of the tension leaving his shoulders, even as exhaustion started to catch up to him.
Harry knows he’s right but that doesn’t stop the string of curses and sobs that spill from his mouth for the next few minutes.
And before he can worry about not having answered Draco’s question, he feels Draco’s hand wrap around his aching cock. Harry thrashes at the sensation—the potion heightening the sensations. He babbles something that might have been
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and then took a sharp breath, his demeanour shifting at once back to cool and collected. “Sorry, you’re recovering and you nearly died. It isn’t the time. I’ll go put on some tea.” He turned to leave.
Harry wasn’t sure if he wanted to tell him or if he just felt like he needed to explain himself. “Honestly, I think there are a lot of things. Just the whole fame thing on its own is bad enough. Because while some people might be supportive, you know some aren’t and I’ve just not been sure I can take any more of it, you know?”
A loud sigh came from the other side of the office. Mel looked like shit, dark bags under her eyes. Harry sighed and closed the folder on his desk; he was sure he didn’t look any better. It had been over a week since Ernest Foxley had gone missing. There was no trace of him, and every lead they had followed up on was another dead end.
They sat in silence, rocking gently. Thin clouds were moving past the stars; moonlight reflecting off them, giving the sky a silver sheen.
“Ah, sorry,” Harry said, when he was sure he could breathe again. “I think I need to work on that part.”
Harry chuckles softly and continues kissing down his husband's lean body, biting at his sharp hips, sucking at the hollowed skin that curves towards his cock. He watches as Draco starts to squirm, his cock filling out under the sensations. Harry scoots back, tucking himself between Draco’s legs before dipping down and licking up the length of his cock, long and slender like the rest of him.
So, he settles for an “I love you” and drifts to sleep, knowing that he’ll wake in Draco’s arms—that he’ll have all the time in the world to say all those things later.
Harry slowly extricated himself. Draco huffed and stretched out as more real estate became available. Even though the awkward position couldn’t have lent itself to a good night’s rest, he looked peaceful. Harry found himself staring for a minute too long and then shook his head slightly, reminding himself that staring at people while they were sleeping was creepy. As Draco stretched out fully, still asleep, Harry grabbed the afghan off the sofa back and covered him up. He might as well let him get a little more sleep.
He opened his mouth to tell them to stay on the ground until he was back and had an immediate flashback to his first and only flying lesson. Nope, he was not going to make that mistake.
By the end of the day, he was absolutely convinced whoever had thought up the whole combined classes with house system had thrived off chaos. There were too many students. And, as he should have foreseen, Gryffindor and Slytherin, in particular, were a nightmare to teach together. The house rivalry was just as strong as it had been when Harry had attended. So, his afternoon lesson had ended with him not having made it through a single lesson and having to take points from both houses, solidifying his descent in their eyes from cool ex-Quidditch player to just another professor, possibly one who didn’t know what they were doing.
Even though he’s been stretched from the pounding that Draco gave him earlier, Harry still gasps as he feels a cold hard pressure stretching out the tight ring. He forces himself to breathe through it as Draco works it in and out, preparing Harry for what’s sure to be a larger stretch as the toy goes deeper.
Draco turned his head, his eyes roaming over Harry’s body, spread out on their overly large coffee table. His arse hung just off the edge, legs spread as wide as they could manage, the rope holding them secure.
“This is your body. You tell me what you want me to do.” Harry watched as Draco’s green eyes widened. He wasn’t sure if Draco was surprised that Harry was going through with this, or if he was just really excited at the prospect. Either way, he clearly was interested in this new proposition.
for additional tags and content warning for this final scene of Chapter 15 and the first scene of Chapter 16.
“It’s perfect, sir,” Draco replied. And it was. He was already losing track of time, getting lost in the sensations, in the forced stillness.
“I can look into this further,” Scott said. “We do some work with Muggle causes of death in the lab, so we’ll see if we can reach out to our Muggle contacts and find out what they’d be looking for if this were the reason for someone’s death.”
She shook with laughter under his arm and went ahead of him out the door. He felt a little lighter and a little more confident that he could finally tell her. Not yet… but eventually.
“Mel!” he tried to warn her just as the blast reverberated through the space. Harry watched her body crumple just as everything went black.
Draco sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “We actually had a huge row about it. I didn’t want to move to France; England’s my home, for better or worse. I could have stayed at her London home, but… I just needed a clean break. Maybe even from my friends.”
“He’s so different, Gin. Some of it is I’m sure that he’s been living with Muggles and isn’t some psycho blood purist anymore,” he said with a huff of a laugh. “But it’s just… he’s so happy. He’s so just okay with being himself.”
He continued to turn over the idea of the trainer job in his head as he opened the door to the pub, a blast of warm air hitting him in the face. He chose a table in the back corner, far enough away from other guests that they’d be able to talk without breaking the Statute of Secrecy, and tossed his coat and satchel down. After grabbing a couple of pints from the bar, he settled in and flipped through his phone. Still no messages from Draco. Harry was growing increasingly curious as to what Draco was up to. Earlier in the week, he’d been too distracted by the case and his own emotional state to give it much thought, but as the stress lightened—particularly now that he’d quit—he was wondering about it more and more.
Draco opened his mouth in protest, his eyes narrowing, as Harry slid his hand under the skirt and pinched his arse.
Hermione turned and looked at Harry flatly, clearly in disbelief, while Ron made a disgruntled noise on the other side of Harry.
“I’ll see her on Monday, if you’d like me to ask then?” Aubrey looked at him intently; everyone in the room was now completely focused on him.
“Yes, for fuck’s sake.” Harry shimmies up to his knees, sticking his arse towards Draco. “Do you want me to beg? Please fuck me?”
“Chlora-what?” The older SSC squad wizard who was seated next to Clara leaned forward to grab one of the parchment papers.
“Oh, they drink anyways. They come here first and then go up there. It’s an absolute menace, honestly. I’ve told Rob, that’s the owner, that I’m not managing that place. Drunk people with sharp heavy objects are decidedly not what I want to spend my time dealing with.” Draco huffed, clearly having a lot of opinions on the matter.
Harry reaches out to grab his arm but doesn’t get to Draco in time as his torso succumbs to gravity, slowly tipping backwards. He lands with a thud and a cry as his head bangs into the hardwood dresser nearby.
“Well, I’ve thought a lot about that,” Draco replied. “I know I’ll have to come up with a cover story and such, but I want to try to do both. I think it’s possible—I’ll need a new job that they can’t come visit me at.
She nodded, pulling in a shaky breath. “I know that. I do. I just—” She wiped her cheek and looked back up at him, clear anger visible beneath the tears. “It was my department, Harry. There were so many people in my department. They’ve been doing interviews—there were more, some who left only a few years ago.”
“Yes, so uncomfortable,” Harry replied, a smile playing at his lips. “Watching a hot man change in front of me is awful.”
“Hey, Scott,” Harry said to the young wizard as he entered their office holding what Harry hoped was completed lab work with a lead.
He hadn’t originally wanted a big party, but Draco had insisted and once Hermione agreed and also started pushing it, Harry knew it was a lost cause. They’d been right though. Seeing all of his friends and family in one place—the Weasleys, friends from Hogwarts, Auror friends—filled Harry’s heart.
Harry started towards Emily before having a second thought, turning on heel he headed back to the student. “Just stay on the ground until I get back, okay?” He nodded, and Harry hoped for the best as he turned and jogged back to the other end of the class area to go find Emily.
And he didn’t want to think about how close it had really come. The Healer had made it more than clear that had his personal protection spells been any weaker, they wouldn’t have survived.
He rolled his eyes, but let himself laugh. “Fine. I’ll tell you what, I’ll trade you one jab if you’ll do me a favour.”
Harry nodded, but deep down he knew this was a fool’s errand. Lucius had been too careful, too good at covering his tracks. The address they’d found had been an anomaly—one piece of evidence Lucius or his counterparts overlooked. Harry doubted they’d find another.
Once they were all in their zones, Harry amplified his voice. “Get started! I’ll be around to check your progress and answer questions.”
“That’s some bad luck right there, love.” Draco dropped a kiss on his shoulder. “But, rules are rules, that’ll be fifteen.”
“Hey there. Harry, right?” she asked, slipping a coaster in front of him. “You want the Sunset again?”
“Do you need anything?” Draco asked gently, dropping out of the scene momentarily. Harry shook his head, a small smile pulling up at his lips. Draco returned the smile, their eyes meeting, and Harry could feel the warmth, the love, how happy Draco was.
“And sometimes…” Draco continued to press light kisses along the sole of his foot. “An area that might normally be ticklish on a person can become sensual once they are aroused enough.”
Harry pinned up the photos and names on the board in the conference room as the other teams filed into the meeting. He was really hoping they could figure something out today, particularly before another person went missing. He was starting to feel the pinpricks of fixation that he sometimes got on a particularly difficult case. While he still couldn’t bring himself to care that Lucius Malfoy had likely been murdered, he was getting increasingly bothered by the lack of evidence and, now, the lack of potential leads.
“Oh shit,” Draco whispers just as the pipe bursts. Water sprays out from the new crack and hits both of them directly in the face.
Harry took a sip of his ale as he listened to Malfoy’s story about when Peeves decided to redistribute a whole box of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes that he’d found locked in Filch’s office to all the first-year students. Malfoy’s cheeks were flushed and his hands animated, and Harry caught himself focusing a little too much on the movement of his lips and the brightness of his eyes instead of the story. They were on their third round and Harry was starting to feel the effects. He leaned back in his chair, feeling the tension he’d been carrying all week melt out of him as he let Malfoy’s words wash over him.
“We’ll let you know if there’s anything else, but that should be enough for now,” Harry said, heading back towards the door.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “I think I always thought that, well, this isn’t one of those jobs you are supposed to have fun at.”
The pride tattoo on his other bicep, a series of rainbow coloured lines with “Love is Love” written out in a cursive script below was self explanatory, but Harry took the time to trace out each line with his tongue. He moved lower, to the bright chaotic flowers on the inside of his left forearm, where he knew the mark had been. As he traced the flowers, he could see the faintest dark outline of the mark underneath.
He knew she was trying to get a rise out of him—force him to make a mistake—but he was far too experienced to fall for that. It took a lot to rattle Harry in the field, far more than an arsehole like her, certainly.
Harry left on his pyjama bottoms and pulled on the thick deep purple sweater that sported a tan sorting hat on the front. It was a bit of a strange choice, but he liked the colour. Plus, it was still better than the jumper in glittery gold with a unicorn head that he’d received the year prior to that. George had flat out asked his mum if she was running out of ideas as he opened his present to find a Doxie on his own. Molly had declared that each year was to have a theme since there were so many children and grandchildren, which Harry took as, yes, she was running out of ideas.
Draco takes his time undressing his husband, watching as Harry relaxes and becomes more aroused from the light touches—a hand brushing his side, a slow kiss on his throat.
“Ah, erm—” Hagrid spoke up from the back of the room “I should probably let yeh all know, one of the Diricawls I got for the N.E.W.T. students seems to be missing.”
As he neared the Ministry entrance, he pushed it down: the worry, the envy, the fears. He was good at that by now. He’d throw himself into the case, focus on the puzzle and mystery of it all and leave no space for his personal issues. He had plenty to focus on with this case anyway.
“Are you always this stubborn after an injury? You’re just going to make your injuries worse! If your magic is still recovering from a curse, you can’t push yourself like this.” Draco shook his head, looking somewhere between irritated and fond… but mostly irritated.
Harry shuffled to the side of it to open the door and then levitated the plant to Malfoy’s shelf, tucking it behind his other food to keep it hidden from view.
“No, I’m not done. I’ve bit back retorts to your insults; I’ve not instigated any of it. Not once.” Harry raised an eyebrow, and he could see Malfoy thinking through their interactions so far. “But you’ve given me no reason to believe that you’ve changed.”
“Yeah, I only put lunches and snacks on my pantry requests,” Harry replied. He didn’t particularly like taking meals at the staff table—he felt like he was on display the whole time—but as new faculty, he thought he should probably make an effort.
“Draco, fuck—please.” Harry was straining against Draco now, his hips trying to thrust, looking for more.
Harry had no sense of time as the day went on; his entire world narrowed to the sensations deep within him. There was no discernable pattern to the plug, so he soon let go of trying to find one and was reduced to reacting as they came, riding the wave of sensations.
Harry drops his head onto Draco’s leg with a groan as Draco plops back on the bed. So much for breaking the dry spell.
Once he was done, Mel held out her hand for his quill, scanned the list with her finger, and added a few more on the bottom. They shared a significant look and both got back to work. After a few more letters, Harry started a second parchment for locations with dates. The only thing he didn’t seem to be finding was the
“That’s fine—all I’m asking is that you try. In fact, I’d like you to start the turn early also. At about 10 feet from the ground.”
to both make Harry want to know everything about him and also be floored that he didn’t want to punch him in the face anymore. Merlin, he was in trouble.
“Go.” Ginny gave him a warm smile. “I’ve got some stuff I have to take care of before tomorrow’s game anyways.”
Draco pressed his lips together, trying to figure out what he could possibly say that would quickly get him out of that device. No matter how much he’d been the one that wanted to try chastity, he was definitely ready for it to be off for the night.
Harry bit down a laugh and pushed Draco’s trousers and pants down just enough to pull out the long slender cock that was rapidly filling out at the recent turn of events. God, he wasn’t going to last long. He held his cock,
“We’ll be out in a minute, can you get us started? I just wanted to finish telling Harry my story real quick,” Ginny said. As soon as they were out of the room, she continued, “Ok, you were saying.”
“He didn’t think they should all be arrested or kept out of Hogwarts, but he thought born-wizards were better, obviously,” she answered.
Once she’d slid the lager in front of him and he’d paid, she hesitated for a minute. “Would you like me to let him know you’re here? Even if it’s not business?” She asked with a knowing glint in her eye.
“Please, Draco.” Harry turned his head to where his boyfriend leaned over at his desk, focused on work.
“You’re not an idiot,” he said, instead. “He was your father, of course you are going to care. I think it’s normal to worry about what your parents think of you. I mean, I know mine are gone, but even with the Weasleys…”
Harry knew exactly the couple he was talking about; they’d looked very much in love, and Harry had spent too long wondering what that might be like.
Harry pointed his wand at his throat, amplifying his voice throughout the pitch. “Alright, good job everyone. Let’s pack it up!”
“No. You have nothing to apologise for, Harry. If you aren’t interested in dating anyone, that’s your business. Even if you don’t ever want to… if that’s not something you’re interested in, that’s okay,” she said, gently.
Draco took a deep breath and looked contemplative. “Most of them were either killed or arrested in the war, but there’s one person that you might want to start with, now that I think of it. Abner Astor. He’s never been in any kind of position of power himself, but he’s more of a… maybe… go-between? He has connections and was just always around whenever my father had meetings.
Everyone else jumped into action immediately. Someone set off an alarm that let out a clamouring bell through the space. A roar sounded from the corner of the room, and Harry found himself momentarily distracted at the noise. He started to turn to locate the source of the noise but fought back the urge. They needed to neutralise the immediate threats first.
The gentle breeze seemed to carry the scent of the forest, pines mixing with an earthier smell. A few birds fluttered overhead, silhouetted against the deep blue of the sky, chirping as they swooped back around to the lake. It filled Harry with a sense of calm, a certain sense of rightness—that he’d made the right decision in coming back to Hogwarts.
Draco adjusts his stance, slipping his hand between them and wrapping his warm fingers around Harry’s cock. Harry throws his head back at the sensation. He’s so close. Draco picks up the pace. His breathing becomes more erratic, and Harry can tell he’s close too.
“Fine. I’ll figure it out anyway, eventually. I’m pretty sure the next time I can get you a few pints deep at a pub, you’ll tell me all about it.”
To Harry’s relief, the conversation had eventually steered away from his sex life, and Ginny had filled him in on all the latest Quidditch league gossip and her team’s progress. She’d been positively thrilled to learn that he’d come out to her parents and laughed heartily when he told her how he’d outed himself to Ron and Hermione in a potions-induced haze.
Malfoy looked up. “Yeah? That would be fantastic. That last batch was absolute rubbish—ruined a whole lesson’s worth of potions. I’ll stop by on Thursday for the information if you don’t mind.”
Harry had started off their shopping trip by telling her that he’d completely trust her judgment, knowing his own style was at least ten years out-of-date. And then, in a moment of what must have been insanity, he’d also made her promise not to let him back out of it.
“Auror Potter. One of these days I’d love to see you when you’ve not been nearly mortally wounded,” she said with a sigh, scanning through the parchment in her hand. She ran a few diagnostic tests and jotted something on the parchment.
“I woke up, and you weren’t here,” Draco said, unable to stop the pout from coming through in his voice.
“I don’t know if it was the combination or if it was your particularly strong brand of magic that saved you, but whatever it was, keep that up. It saved both your lives.”
Harry and Mel had begrudgingly stopped, their eyes dry and red from hours of intense concentration. The walls were covered with parchment—notes upon notes of dates, locations, and names. They hadn’t found any more big players, but they slowly added names of people who appeared to be low-level accomplices, like shopkeepers in Diagon Alley who were helping supply the operation.
Harry focused on dishing out some cranberry sauce, trying not to laugh. He supposed as long as they got there eventually, that was what mattered in the end.
“Yes, sir.” Harry tried to be graceful about it, but in the end needed to use his hands to spread his legs as wide as they would go, hooking them over Draco’s strong and trouser-clad legs.
Slowly and carefully, Draco had become one of Harry’s closest friends, maybe even his closest. They had no secrets from each other. Well,
They wouldn’t need any of that for the interview with Isabelle George. She’d already agreed to be interviewed under Veritaserum, provided a solicitor was present. And she’d already had her more gruelling interview on her case with Higgins and Perry for the Neo-Death Eater case.
“Yes, sir.” Harry crawled the short distance and tucked himself in between Draco’s legs, placing his hands on his thighs and waiting for the next instruction. His breath was already uneven, unsure what Draco had planned next.
“We’re a go for tomorrow,” Ron replied, sounding out of breath. “I just left a Portkey with Mel. Meet her at the flat at 0700. I also left you a spare set of Auror field robes and boots.”
Draco’s chest rose and fell with his unsteady breaths, and Harry knew that he wasn’t the only one that was nervous. For weeks, as he’d fantasised about the man, he’d always assumed that Draco would be calm, cool—too experienced to be affected. On his more insecure nights, when Harry’s mind would wander, Harry had imagined himself too nervous, too inexperienced to be any good—a disappointment. He never imagined Draco to be like this—his expression mirroring Harry’s own nervousness.
Harry seemed to know the effect he was having, the corners of his lips pulled up into a smile. An evil smile as far as Draco was concerned, as his breathing sped up.
He came around the last turn of the pitch and headed back to the line of brooms, seeing some students heading his way down the long path from the castle. He reminded himself that he’d gone over the lesson plan a dozen times, had flown professionally, and definitely knew what he was doing. Holding onto that thought tightly, he took another deep breath, wiped his hands on the sides of his robes one more time, and put on his game face.
“Go shower. I’ll keep the tea under a warming charm for when you’re done,” she said as she bounded down the stairs to the kitchen.
They started off normal. Draco texting him random thoughts he had as he had them. But then, as Harry didn’t reply, Draco became concerned that Harry was still mad about Saturday. The last few messages were more concerned. It seemed Draco worked out that something might have happened at work.
“What?” Draco asked. Harry never asked for his input during a scene other than checking in that he was okay.
“Hello,” she replied, cautiously, covering her phone with her hand as she slipped it into her pocket.
Harry found himself laughing quite easily. Once the moment passed though, they settled into a silence that became awkward quickly. There wasn’t anything more he needed, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to leave. His interest was piqued. This new Malfoy was a mystery; Harry couldn’t quite understand how this was the same person he’d hated so thoroughly at school.
Harry settled into his side as Draco draped an arm around him and rubbed his back. “It’s okay,” Harry said. “I’m just exhausted, sorry I didn’t check in more.”
to Astoria Greengrass. Harry remembered that it was broken off in just a few short months—a scandal that the press had obsessed over the news for a good month. But Harry couldn’t remember seeing or hearing a word about Malfoy since, and that had been well over a decade ago.
Draco flattens his tongue against his hole, wetting the area, before blowing softly and pulling a soft moan out of Harry. Harry’s barely moving, as relaxed as he is, and Draco smiles smugly, glad that he hasn’t lost his massage skills. He’s always prided himself on making Harry positively boneless during a massage—far better than any of the team masseuses, certainly. Plus, they don’t follow it up with a spectacular orgasm.
By the time Draco climbed the last two steps and opened the door, the calm from his bath was fully replaced by anticipation and nerves. Ever since he’d seen someone tied up at the club a few years prior, Draco knew he wanted to try it—the beautiful ropework, the slow process of wrapping them, the loose ends dragging across the sub’s skin, the stillness the sub was forced into from the tight restraints. He was half-hard just thinking about it.
A few minutes later, he rounded the corner to a busy street in Covent Garden. Christmas shoppers were out in hordes, and Harry mentally thanked Ron for the smart move.
This time, there was no worry as he breathed deeply, calmly. There were no racing thoughts or worries creeping in, only that moment existed—his body bound, the world dark, and the knowledge that Harry was nearby watching over him, protecting him.
Harry shivers in anticipation as Draco thrusts a slick finger in him, adding another quickly. He pulls at his restraints in vain, wanting nothing more than to rock into the sensation. The potion makes it all the more arousing, and he wants more, more,
She fought it for a minute, but eventually it became too much as Harry continued to let his magic build unfettered, and cried out. “Serbia!”
As much as any pressure feels like a relief, Harry desperately wants his mouth. He’s so sore and Draco’s warm mouth feels like a balm.
The sight of Draco looking up at him through his lashes as he bit at Harry’s hip was too much, so Harry dropped his head back on the pillow, letting his eyes fall closed.
Harry pulled out his phone, sending off a message to Adriana Johnson, the older sister of his former Gryffindor teammate and George’s wife, Angelina. His phone vibrated with her response immediately; she could move a few things around in her schedule.
He closed the door behind himself, leaning up against it and trying to catch his breath. They’d finished their debriefing—both Harry and Mel relaying the events of the raid and the magical creature smuggling ring. Harry knew they were all being taken care of—the family of werewolves, the house-elves, the myriad of other magical creatures—but as he had tried to objectively give his report to Ron and the Wizengamot member, he found his hands were shaking again. He’d been able to keep them hidden under the table, and it hadn’t seemed that anyone noticed, but Harry was barely keeping it together.
Draco came around to the patron side of the bar and sidled up to Harry, throwing a tattooed arm over Harry’s shoulders and pressing a kiss to his temple.
Harry grinned. They’d compromised by dipping a few more pieces of fruit in the leftover chocolate and saving them for a dessert to go with dinner.
Malfoy sighed and shuffled some papers. “I didn’t mean that as an insult—just, you flew professionally, you know the subject—what’s the problem?”
Harry sat at the end of his soft, worn leather sofa—the one he’d bought because it reminded him of the Gryffindor common room. The potions started to kick in slowly, and he found himself drifting in and out, startling himself awake a few times in the process as his head dropped toward his chest. Eventually, Draco sighed loudly, bent over and grabbed Harry by the legs, pulling them up onto the sofa and settling Harry’s sock-clad feet onto his own lap. Harry would have protested, but as he sunk further into the sofa, he felt himself quickly drifting off.
Harry turned to see Malfoy coming down the front steps to the castle. When he reached Harry, he sighed and sat down next to him.
His hips thrust into Draco’s hand, chasing what is bound to be a painful orgasm. He knows it won’t be good, knows it won’t be fulfilling, but he can’t stop.
“Perfect,” Draco says as reaches out and runs a hand through Harry’s hair, which hangs loosely. “You have no idea how beautiful you look like this,” he says barely above a whisper before reaching out and dragging his finger up Harry’s face, gathering the wetness there. He then puts his finger in front of Harry’s mouth, and Harry opens, licking the tears from Draco’s finger.
“Potter, I promise if I wanted to fuck with you, I would do better than stealing your yoghurt of all things.”
“What? This guy is meeting with the Neo-Death Eaters and is involved in the potions ring? Is it possible all these cases are connected?” Harry asked. That seemed highly unlikely. "You said he was a suspect? Was he cleared?”
His finger hovered over the message icon until he finally sighed and tapped the icon. He had a couple of unread messages from Ginny, but those would keep, no matter how much he wanted to answer those first and put off the inevitable.
“Sorry, sir, sorry,” Harry cries out, forcing himself to still. He keeps his fists tight and screws up his eyes, trying to will his body to behave.
“Do you mind me asking what you are afraid of? If you want to talk about it, that is,” Draco said, so considerately that it made Harry’s chest ache a little, knowing that his carefulness came from a place of his own experiences with bigotry and being hurt.
“Draco, that's amazing,” Harry said. “And you’re sure? About coming back to, you know, the wizarding community?”
“Was it—” Harry stopped himself before he started asking intrusive questions. He wondered how much of Draco’s situation was just his sexual orientation, or if it was something else. He’d been engaged to Astoria Greengrass, so maybe that was the crux of the issue.
“We’ve got a link between the missing Floo Regulation worker and one of the Neo-Death Eaters that was arrested last week,” Mel spoke up.
Harry hummed in agreement. “Let’s compare our notes in the morning and make sure we’ve got everything for now and wait for the lab results. Without a cause of death, we’re just going to be running in circles at this point. I'm getting a feeling this case is going to be a giant pain. Who would we even put on a suspect list at this point? Everyone that hated him? That would include me and half the Ministry.”
Harry picked up another notebook from the stacks around him on the floor. Some were leather, intricately bound with gold leaf edges, others were crudely sewn together with rough edges, but all of them were proving useless. He’d filled Mel in on what he found, or more accurately didn’t find, in the Floo department. They were both keeping a close eye on anything relating to that, but so far, they were coming up empty.
“Okay, everyone move back! No one is getting in trouble,” Harry said, kneeling down next to the student who was crying and seemed the most injured. He was holding his knee which was bent at a slightly wrong angle.
After the last of the stragglers were on the path to the school, Harry landed a few feet from Malfoy, not bothering with an attempt at being polite for once. “Any particular reason you are out here?”
Draco’s question brought up all the thoughts that Harry had spent the day trying to suppress. He wouldn’t have done anything, really, not in a body that wasn’t his. But that didn’t stop images from popping in his head all day—what Draco would look like flushed and freshly showered, water droplets hanging onto his pale skin; what he’d look like sleep mussed in the morning, fresh out of bed. Their hookups had always been fast, done with the speed of two people who were denying what they were really doing. He never got to see the rest of it.
Draco slid his hand down Harry’s side and threaded his fingers in Harry’s, tugging him towards the door. Harry followed willingly.
“Anything else?” Minerva asked, looking around the room. “Alright then, I’ll see you all for our next meeting in October.” She gave a small smile and a curt nod, and everyone began collecting their belongings.
“Okay, I’ll tell you what,” Ron said, turning to Harry. “If you rest for a few days, I’ll bring you some files to look through over the weekend.”
So, it made sense that Draco, sitting across from him would have been just as moulded and changed from another twenty years of experiences. Harry realised with a start that Draco had been living amongst Muggles longer than Harry had even known him at Hogwarts. That hurt his brain a little to wrap around.
Harry breathes a sigh of relief as he very carefully closes the door. The twins finally are down for their nap, James is busy with his game again, and Harry is determined to break Draco and his dry spell.
After taking his potions upon waking up that morning, the pain subsided quite a bit. He had managed to get all the way downstairs for some toast, which wasn’t a small feat given the number of stairs between his bedroom and the kitchen.
Draco nodded shakily and braced himself on one arm, the other moving to his cock and stroking himself in matching movements to Harry’s thrusts until he cried out and came. Harry dug his fingers into the ruffled fabric around his hips and sped up, thrusting hard and fast, as a warm heat pooled in his gut.
The fire crackled in the fireplace at the Burrow, and Harry felt at home sandwiched between Ron and Hermione on the smaller of the two sofas, all of them full from an extra large dinner.
“Okay.” Harry smiled at the enthusiasm. “Andy, Jacob and Terrance, let me see and then I’ll give you the next lesson.”
“Oh god—” Harry does remember. He remembers long, glorious nights where they’d fuck for hours when Draco would bring him to the edge over and over until Harry would be delirious, completely desperate for it. He remembers the earth-shattering orgasms that would follow, nearly blacking out from the intensity. He remembers being boneless and perfectly satiated, and Draco wrapping him up in his arms and Harry having never felt so loved and taken care of—knowing that the sweet torture was all for Harry—for his pleasure and torment and enjoyment.
They walked back around the Manor and entered this time. Harry could feel the tension radiating off of Draco the minute they were over the threshold; clearly he wasn’t thrilled to be back. A few long hallways and a staircase later found them in the study. The same one that Lucius Malfoy died in. The room looked the same as it had, a little darker without the fire in the hearth and without a dead body.
Draco’s hands ran up Harry’s chest, coming to rest on the sides of his head. Draco pulled back, still holding Harry. “You really see me? Us together, I mean?”
Harry whimpered as Draco slowly reached out, wrapping his long fingers around Harry’s cock, running his hand slowly up and down the length. Harry fought to stay still, using all his focus to not move his hips, to not spill the tea. After a few slow tugs, Draco relaxed his hand, holding it in a loose fist around the tip of Harry’s cock. Harry wanted nothing more than to thrust into his first, find friction, but let out a long whine instead.
“I didn’t mean that as a criticism, Shaw. I know it’s still early and you’re following every lead you have.” Ron sighed again.
“Sorry,” Draco replies, eyes widening. Cleaning charms on people need to be cast very gently. Draco decides to open Harry up with his fingers, just to be safe, and casts a lubrication charm at his fingers. He overshoots on this as well, and lube is suddenly everywhere.
Draco feels his cock filling out at the memories and pokes his head back out into the hallway. Music is still playing from James’s game, and the twins are quiet behind their closed door. Maybe Draco will even get lucky and they’ll stay that way for a few minutes. With a growing smile, Draco steps in the room and softly closes the door behind him before throwing locking and one-way silencing charms up. He then carefully sits on the bed next to Harry, brushing his wild hair out of his eyes.
Ever since their first hookup, it was one of Draco’s favourite games when he was bored—see how riled he could get Harry in the office. Harry was not a fan. Mostly.
Harry relaxed against him, letting the warmth of the other man’s body soothe him. At least, until he heard the slide of the cards and another flip.
“So, that brings us to the next order of business,” Ron said, his eyes still crinkled in a smile. “Assistant Head Auror.” He took a piece of parchment and handed it to Harry.
Before Harry could get too hot and bothered by the image, Draco turned around and quickly pulled off his trousers, slipping on his pyjama bottoms. He then pulled off his shirt. Harry watched as Draco’s lean muscles flexed at the movement. A vine curved around his shoulder blade, small flowers scattered along its length. There were other patterns and tattoos that he couldn’t quite make out, one in the centre of his back, another just above his hip.
. But the levitation charm is keeping him in place along with the ropes, and he can do little more than beg and plead as Draco slowly stretches him open.
Draco made no move to speed things up, though, as he moved back up the bed, spreading Harry’s thighs and settling him between them. He nipped and licked his way to where his thigh met his groin.
And in the light of day, Harry knew it wasn’t as dramatic as it had felt while he was completely sloshed. Draco knew he had been drunk, and Harry was sure they’d be able to continue their growing friendship. But that didn’t mean Harry still wasn’t disappointed and a little hurt. So, for most of Sunday, he had let himself wallow in the knowledge that Draco wasn’t interested in him.
Harry remembered being three drinks deep while George went on for at least an hour about the technology and the spell work involved. Within 5 minutes, Harry was pretty well glazed over. As cool as it was that George had got it working, the intricacies of that kind of magic were never particularly fascinating for Harry.
In a surprising act of openness and honesty, Malfoy had also explained during their walk to the village that no amount of apologizing could possibly repair what he’d done to Madame Rosmerta. So, out of respect, he kept clear of the Three Broomsticks. So far they’d stayed far away from the topic of the war. Harry knew if their friendship were to continue, it would likely need to be addressed eventually, but at the moment he found himself in no rush to get there. He’d seen enough proof of Malfoy’s character from the past few weeks to wait for that conversation. Instead he sat back and let himself enjoy the moment, listening to Malfoy tell story after story with a light in his eyes and a smile playing at his lips.
A few minutes later, Harry pushed through the solid oak door into the dark pub. He walked towards the back, glancing in the various booths as he passed them. When he got to the second to last, he found the other man.
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry’s jaw. “And then, there are some areas that are almost universal.” His mouth followed the curve of Harry’s jaw down to his neck, gently sucking under his ear. Harry tilted his head and moaned.
“Hmm,” Draco stills his hand on Harry’s cock. Harry freezes, making sure not to buck up—fighting against every instinct in his body to do so.
“Well, thank you, but I should ask what this is about,” Trelawney said, straightening her crocheted shawl.
Draco pays the driver after Harry spends too long fumbling for his wallet, and he drags Harry through the Leaky to the Floo.
Harry walked a little faster, not really knowing where he was going or what exactly he was looking for. He tried to lose himself in the movement, in the rhythmic footfalls on the pavement. When he was still a teenager, his dream involved a wife and children, a happy house with lots of life. His eyes prickled. He didn’t really have any of it. He had the job. The job that he never seemed to be able to leave at work, even when it wasn’t actively following him home with a vendetta. But the rest of it… He tried to remind himself that he had Ron and Hermione, Rose and Hugo, the Weasleys… Draco…
“Here’s how it will work. I have a deck of Muggle playing cards here.” Draco held the deck in Harry’s view before placing them on the table in front of them. “I am going to flip a card over. Then, you’ll guess whether the next card will be higher or lower. Understood?”
Harry leaned forward on his broom, flying to the other side of the group. The bird was running in circles just under a group of Slytherin students.
Harry hit send on the message, locked the phone, and handed it back to Draco. “I feel fine—totally rested. Why?”
“Hey, Bradbourn. I need you to go through this and double-check that everything’s in there,” Harry said, handing him the bag. While checking the supplies was always good protocol, Harry was more concerned with having the inexperienced Auror have something to do until it was time for the raid. Standing around thinking too much was always a terrible idea.
Draco softly chuckles, his breath tickling Harry’s neck. He continues with a few more firm and long strokes until Harry feels a warmth spreading as his orgasm builds. As expected, though, just as he’s about to lose control, to thrust into Draco’s palm and come, Draco pulls his hand away.
Harry laughs softly. “Absolutely. Whatever you say, dear.” He lets himself relax and sleep pull him in, basking in the absolute boneless relaxation that only comes from a great orgasm. Maybe they’ll even get a few more minutes in the morning before Ron and Hermione drop the kids back off. And maybe, they’ll actually be able to finish again. It could happen.
“It had better be,” Harry muttered. “I don’t fancy someone finding us both frozen in the hallway with a stolen plant.”
A moment later, he feels Draco’s hand on his inner thigh—just resting there. Then there’s a pressure on his hole.
When Draco got within reach, Harry grabbed him and dragged him roughly to him, pulling a noise of surprise from the other man.
Harry grasped Draco’s hips and pulled back slowly, watching his cock slide out and then back in again, the rough fabric of his jeans pressed uncomfortably between them. But Harry left his jeans as they were, enjoying the sight of them rubbing on Draco’s sensitive arse cheeks, knowing they were only adding to the sensations of the other man. Knowing that Draco would know that he hadn’t even bothered to undress before taking him right there on the floor of their sitting room.
“Because even though they can’t be traced, Muggle doctors say they show up as a heart attack. We’ve been trying to find out more, but we’re not sure that would line up with how the victim presented. We’re not sure what criteria they use to show a heart attack, since it would obviously be different from our autopsy spells.”
Harry felt his face heat, but he couldn’t look away. He found himself staring at Draco, the way he leaned back on the counter behind him, arms crossed as he laughed at something the man said. He was wearing a similar outfit as the day prior, just a plain coloured t-shirt and fitted jeans. This shirt was emerald green and clung to his shoulders and his stomach. As he turned around and started mixing the guy a drink, his shirt rode up just enough to show a slip of skin and the band of black pants. The inconsistent thumping sound he’d heard the other day coming from somewhere upstairs was back and seemed to mirror the jump of Harry’s heartbeat.
“Harry, you’re scaring me. What happened? Are you hurt? Did the potions not work?” Draco asked, voice concerned.
“Not that long ago, sadly,” she replied. “It apparently started in the nineteen twenties, but it was still around in the eighties, from what I’ve heard. The story goes that a pure-blooded witch had wanted to run away with her lover, but her parents were very strict and had an inkling about her preferences. She’d been locked away in their estate for some time, forbidden from socialising unless her parents were in attendance. Having nothing better to do, she read nearly all the ancient books in the library and stumbled on an old tome that outlined a way to communicate with an illicit lover—from back when love matches were forbidden in pure-blood society—all marriages were arranged back then, at least in those circles.”
It was still completely quiet upstairs, so after a long minute, Harry sighed and headed to the sitting room. He would give his boyfriend the benefit of the doubt for the moment and try to relax and enjoy the Puddlemere game.
“Yes, sir.” Harry already feels arousal thrumming through him at the thought. He can’t even begin to imagine how intense this will get once they’ve started. Even in normal play, Draco brings Harry to places he hadn’t even known possible—where all his senses jumble up into a heady mix of pleasure-pain.
“Thanks.” Harry hadn’t eaten much all week and certainly wasn’t going to turn down any of her food, even as his palms began to sweat at the conversation he was about to have.
While he’d been originally looking forward to lunch with Draco, annoyingly curious about the man, now he was dreading it with every fibre of his being. But it was fine. He’d just get through lunch, get the information they needed about Lucius, and then he’d never have to see him again.
“What would Christmas be without it?” Draco asked, with a smile, putting his arm up on the back of the sofa, Teddy nestling up against him.
“She likes to steal my friends, actually, and claim them as her own,” Draco said, leaning against the side of the wingback chair next to them.
“Can I at least start going through the evidence while I’m just sitting at home?” Harry asked. There was no way he was going to be able to sleep away the next few days now, knowing what he did.
“Not Potions,” Ron replied with a laugh, guessing where Harry’s mind was going. “It would be primarily offensive and defensive classes—combat magic, protection and defensive spells. Stuff you’re really good at,” Ron added.
Ron gave him a mock salute and slid around the bar through the opening at the back. Harry could more or less guarantee there were going to be some vicious combinations by the end of the night, no matter what Ron promised at the moment.
“No.” Mel pulled out her wand and cast a map spell on the wall that was often used by Aurors in the field. A simple map of London appeared. She flicked her wrist and zoomed into the Park Royal area—it wasn’t as detailed as some of the Muggle internet maps, but the roads and general building shapes were clear enough. “This was the warehouse that we searched, over here.” She pointed to a small building by the rails.
Draco only chuckled, but his laughter soon turned to a sigh as Harry bent down and peppered kissing along the edges of the lace panties. He hooked a finger in the thin fabric, lifting it just to the side, revealing a small, furrowed hole. Harry grabbed Draco’s hip with his free hand and ducked his head, licking at Draco’s entrance, running his tongue up and down the sensitive skin, but going no further until Draco was babbling nonsense, calling out Harry’s name along with strings of curses. After he felt Draco tremble beneath him, he dipped his tongue in, enjoying the noises the other man was making. He continued to lick and thrust his tongue, slipping a finger in alongside his tongue as Draco’s hole fluttered beneath his ministrations.
“Fine.” Malfoy huffed. “Tomorrow, then. I have my pantry items restocked every Monday through Saturday. I have to chaperone for the first Hogsmeade trip, you can hide in the staff room.”
He grabbed his coat on his way out the door and apparated from his doorstep to an alley they’d passed on that quiet side street the previous day. Walking to the pub, he pushed down that same uncomfortable feeling under his skin.
“What?” Draco asks, the shock subsiding at the mortifying thought of going to St Mungo’s with this—of someone, anyone, knowing that he managed to injure his cock during drunken sex. “No, absolutely not.”
Harry moans and pushes back into Draco’s hand, but Draco makes sure to take his time. They are probably a little drunker than is responsible for doing anything but sleeping, so he makes sure to go slow and take care of Harry. Draco adds another finger, getting Harry nice and open.
“Of course not, I’ve got more of that tea that yeh liked the last time,” Hagrid said, scratching his beard.
“Well, at least this will go quickly,” Harry said. Of course, he knew that would mean far more hours trying to track down where Malfoy might actually be. If he really was living in the Muggle world, which Harry highly doubted, they might be able to track his name through Muggle technology. But that would assume he was living there in any kind of legal capacity, paying taxes and whatnot.
“I heard you flew perfectly your first time, Professor Potter,” a Hufflepuff student next to them piped up, most unhelpfully. Harry couldn’t remember his name… something with an M? Matt? Mason?
A hand on his arm stopped him, and Harry stopped to turn back to Malfoy, who was looking at him earnestly.
“Good—she gave us a lot of information and some names we didn’t have. Not any big players; it seems we either got all of them or she just doesn’t know any more, but we got some more people that were helping them out financially.”
, surely leaving fingerprints behind. Harry had been kind enough to lend him his glasses for the day since he certainly didn’t need them at the moment.
Harry sighed, having forgotten all about that particular rumour. “No. That was just gossip. Now, don’t you have something you are supposed to be doing?”
Harry followed Draco into the large room, taking in the floor to ceiling shelves on two of the three walls. Unlike the orderly appearance of the books on the shelves in the study, this room was clearly meant for storage over aesthetics. There were boxes with peeling labels and baskets holding large quantities of scrolls. Another shelf was lined with dusty potions bottles and ingredients. At the far end of the room, just past a desk that sat facing them, was a fireplace with two wingback chairs nearby and a cabinet that appeared to be bursting at the seams with scrolls and thick files. Harry’s heartbeat sped up at the sheer possibility of the evidence this room might hold.
Harry laughed, Draco’s turns of phrase once again reminding Harry of how much time he’d spent in the Muggle world. With a shake of his head, he started filling him in on Neville’s rise in the herbology world, from his apprenticeship at Hogwarts to his latest guest lecture in New Zealand.
Harry laughs around his cock, sending reverberations up his body if the sound that comes out of Draco’s mouth is any indication. He presses a finger in, deciding Draco’s had enough teasing, and adds another soon after. Harry has never had the patience to hold back once Draco starts begging—or once he starts throwing out empty threats, more accurately.
Harry makes a sound of agreement, unable to do much more than that. Then Draco pushes back in, twisting his fingers painfully in Harry’s hair and crying out softly as his cock pulses its release.
“Fresh biscuits from Hannah,” Neville said. “I definitely don’t need this many, so I brought them to share. Pass them around if you would.”
The team became visible one at a time as the spells continued to fly through the air. Harry shot a stunner at a wizard who was gaining on Clara, just missing him.
“Why did your father kick you out? Was it just the… you know, gay thing?” Harry asked, carefully, hoping he hadn’t made an incorrect assumption.
Harry had only fuzzy memories of that night. They’d got extremely drunk… and extremely honest. But in the weeks after, it had been better. They’d been
He tried to convince himself that Draco was just busy at work, not that being busy had ever stopped him from responding before. He continued to tap the screen every time it darkened, timing out from lack of use.
