Severus maybe married and had plenty sexual experienced with his late husband but it's been a long time he talked about this embarassing conversation, moreover with Draco. The last time he god laid was 4-5 years ago. He was not sex addict. He enjoyed some pleasure but he limited his activities to no more than a blowjob. He was not ready with serious relathionship. He thought he had someone fated with him although he never met him. Yes him. Since he was young, he wished to be marked by male Alpha. He just didn't have a chance to met the fated Alpha. Even before he remembered his past with James he somehow stayed loyal to his imaginary Alpha. He felt owned by someone but he didn't know who. He often felt guilty when some men made a move on him. He felt like he cheated. So he always refused them if they're asking serious relationship. Truth was he had Alpha. Real Alpha. Not just his imagination. He had mate. He was James's husband. But he was a widow now. He no longer felt owned by him. He was a single mother. A single Omega. He knew James would like him to be happy again. He would allow him to be mated with someone else. Now he could sort of this matter openly. He still thought James was his Alpha but if someone made a move on him, he would consider it. Oh Merlin he sounded desperate. Sighing, he shaked his thought.
"Excellent. Now we proceed. It's good for now. I can go to Kingsley and discuss the next step." Lucius rose from his seat and walked toward the fireplace where he will floo to ministry. "I will have my dinner with minister." Then he gone.
Severus was so proud of Harry. His son bravely choose to marry Draco this young without wavered a bit. He was so confident with his choice. And same goes with Draco. His godchild is a perfect partner for his son. He pray for their happiness and will do everything to make them happy.
"Harry, may I ask you about Dursley? Are you ready to share that dark past with me? I won't forced you if you aren't ready."
"That's weird but okay. We will settle that matter after you get your fortunes. And you still have will's letters from Sirius Black and James Potter. I don't know why no one send you invitation to hearing will in Gringotts but that's okay. The will still valid. I recommend you to read that after you removed all the blocks and compulsions and claim your lordship / heirship. I will take a look at your vault. I will see who gave you that key. And I will find you a vault manager. Maybe Griphawk can be your vaults manager. I will notice him later. I will give you fifteen minutes to compose yourself." Gornnuk began to rose to let him had few minutes to calmed him down.
"Now gentlemen, should we continue?" Narcissa said in too cheerful tone like she's faking her tone. "Harry, dear. Remus gave you a letter from James. Would you mind to read your father's will aloud? Or do you want to read it in private with your mother?"
Bewildered " You want to marry Harry that soon?"
They currently talked randomly with Harry on Draco's lap, Severus sat beside Draco and Narcissa and Lucius in front of them.
"I am sorry for snapping at you two. I should control my emotions more."
Harry and Severus put in the same place as they have the most blocks and spell and compulsions. They dranks the similar potion. Severus had more spell on him casted by dark wizards too. Harry and Severus drank pain reliever potions, to ease their pain. And drank a potion to make the potion's residue evaporated. They were laying down on their back in the circle runes in the centre of the room. The room full with ancient runes and some goblin language and other foreign language. There were seven goblins surrounding them, put something inside the goblet and pour the liquid over Harry's and Severus's stomachs. They then chants and chants and soon both of them screaming in pain. They're being in fire. They're burning and spasms but the goblins continued their chants and pouring another potions onto their head. They can see there's black smoke coming out from their body, they shuddered then collapsed on the ground.
Harry looked so nervous. He was shaking and that made his mother who was styling his hair sighed.
"Me too Harry. I am happy to have you as my son. I longed to have my own children and I thought I was I couldn't bear any but actually I have a son and I am happy. Harry, I want to know you better." Severus kissed his temples.
Lucius, Draco and Severus read the letter with frowning face. Severus looked at Remus and letter few times. He wanted to ask him but he didn't find any words.
"Sure Cissa" He sighed in defeat. He would like to wait as much as time his son needed.
"Ah, no wonder. I sense the similarity between my old room and this chamber."
On 30th July, Harry received another letter form Draco. Titan looks exhausted when he landed on Harry's cupboard after he dropped the letter. Harry gives him owl treat and let him rest above his cupboard. They've been corresponding almost every day. Draco was the only one who know where Harry lives in. Draco often send him his mother's cooking. Harry really loves her Chocolate Mousse. Narcissa always makes sure Harry never run out of food. She thinks he's too skinny.
Harry was trying to free himself but Draco gripped him tight not allowing him to escape. Draco still grinding his hard length on Harry's back. Harry moved his legs intended to wake up but it made hard monster behind him found his companion. Draco somehow slipped his bare length through Harry's thighs and met Harry's length. The friction make Harry buckled his head. He unconsciously clenched his thighs and trapped Draco's length making more frictions for both lengths. Harry felt his mate grinned from his kisses on his neck and he realized that was intentional.
"Dragon, what happened. You were said you will celebrate Harry's birthday together. Why are you and Harry here? Are you two hurt? Did something happened with Harry's inheritance?"
Harry hums in cheerful tune when he cooked his dinner. He enjoys cooking, but hate doing other chores. After eating his dinner and washed his dishes he climbed upstair into his room. He lay down on his bed thinking about his life. His thought back to his sixth year. Still vivid in his minds on that eventful night.
Few hours later the morning came. Harry Potter finally opened his eyes blinded by the sun light. He forgot to closed the curtains last night. He heard tapping sounds and saw an owl outside his window. He opened it to let the owl in. The owl dropped a sealed letter and fly away with loud hoot.
They were resting in the family room. Tipsy brought them summer drinks like pimms, watermelon lemonade, strawberry limeade, ice shaken peach tea, coctail, fresh juices. Tipsy also brought solero, sorbet, fresh fruits, ice cream, frozen yogurt, scones and many more.
"Yes."
"Okay. If you say so." Harry still sounded upset.
"Son, don't be nervous. You will doing great. Draco won't let you fail. Stay still. I'm making your bird nest like hair a bit tamer. I want you to look more beautiful and be the most gorgeous person in the world. Okay honey? Now stay still. Take a deep breath and exhaled slowly." Severus style his son's hair that make him perfect.
Not more than fifteen minutes later Harry arrived in the dining room. He pecked Draco's cheek. Greeted the adults and sat beside Draco. The breakfast was end quickly. Lucius had to go to Italy for overnight business trips, Severus will headed to Hogwarts to meet McGonagall, Narcissa will stayed in her arts room to finish her sketching.
Draco can understand his fiancé thinking. His Omega just scared. Its his nature to be worried. Draco wouldn't let his ex mentor laid a hand on his mate. He would take any measurement and made them in upper hand.
Cissa was so happy to see her son after few days stayed in the ministry. She then summoned her husband and Remus to join the dinner. She also invited Minerva to come but was declined. Minerva couldn't be seen with them outside Hogwarts to minimise the suspicions.
"Mr. Malfoy, yes we've met when I teached you Defense in your third years. Now can you answer my questions? And why Harry is with you?"
After a long long day, they arrived at their manor. They boys looked so exhausted. They slept in instant after they changed their clothes. They would have a nice trip to Burgundy. Narcissa would visit Malfoy's wine yards and some factories while Harry and Draco spent their days in Malfoy's Cabin.
Narcissa who the only one was sobered, cleared her throat and clasped her hands. She brought everyone back to the reality.
****    ****
"Thank you. I believe that you have same visions with us. You are welcomed here. You will stayed here and we will have our discussion about this matter later."
***    ***
Harry still bit angry at Draco for casted a spell on him. But he's agree with him to stay calm. He sat bit further from Draco though.
Lucius cleared his throat to get attention. He said to Severus.
This is my thoughts about the ABO system. Maybe a bit different than usual information. I hope you all enjoy reading my story.
"Uhm, Mother? Can I call you that? Or do you prefer Papa?" he asked Severus shyly. He lowered his head afraid of being scolded.
Narcissa who didn't know about their unexpected encounter with Remus, welcomed them with enthusiastic. She grabbed Harry's hand and looked at the ring on his fourth finger.
"Yes love, you okay?" Draco coeed Harry.
Remus nodded and began to speak.
"Please have a seat."
"Hm, Dray. Thank you for everything. Thank you for being with me and help me with your rational thoughts. Thank you for calming me down. Thank you for taking me. I can't think properly but you handle it well. You are the best Alpha. Thank you. " He snuggled more into Draco.
making sure everything was under control.
His son was cute innocent virgin. He needed to assisted Harry when his first heat come. Harry blushed hard at his mother's questions, He knew he is virgin and innocent. He's late bloomer. He knew that. He never joined their dorm mates jerk off party in the dorm. He often run away when their dorm mates started to do pervert things. He never enjoyed the conversation about boobs, V, and sex. He even didn't like to touch himself. He didn't like thinking about sex at all, but maybe sometimes when he dreamed about Draco. He dreamed Draco did steamy stuff with him and next morning his pants was wet and sticky. But except that, he never did anything. He never dreamed about other men or even women. The thought disgusted Harry much. Ew.
"Thank you Moony. That's mean a lot." Harry hugged him back.
Draco and Harry arrived at Exquis restaurant at one pm. Draco gave the host his name and they were led into a semi private area. They sat in the corner and looked at the menu. While Draco was choosing the menu, Harry looking around enjoying the view. The place was stunning. It was semi contemporary dining hall. The decor was chic and cozy with beautiful flowers arrangement around the tables. Harry could feel the nice ambiance. He smiled at Draco and muttered soft thank you. Draco had a nice taste. He liked this restaurant. Draco grabbed Harry's hand and kissed his knuckles. Harry blushed at Draco's actions. Draco wasn't this bold in the past. Harry liked this new side of Draco. They were looking at each other fondly. Draco wanted to talked about their bonding when the food was served. They paused their conversation and started to eat. They would continue the conversation later. They were hungry and started to enjoy the food. The food was delicious. Harry liked his Braised Turbot. And the Truffled Macaroni and Cheese was superb. Harry was happy with his date. Draco spoiled him so much. He knew what Harry's like.
"Yes mother. I had a nice talk with Severus about Harry. I asked his blessings to marry Harry. I want to have soul bonding with him. Not just marking him." Draco looks at his mother reaction.
After dinner, Lucius talked to them and made a deal with Harry and Severus.
Harry thought Draco was hiding something from him. He tried to talk about this matter to Severus but his mother declined his idea. Narcissa was the same. She told him that Draco was tired and his job needed him a full concentration. Narcissa suggested Harry to take Draco on date. This was one reason they went to Diagon Alley just the two of them. Apart from school supplies, they would go shopping a few muggle formal attire, a more than few formal wizard robes, a full wardrobe with both combinations of muggle and wizard casual clothes. Harry still not fond of wizard robes but he was soon to be half Malfoy so he had to adapt with their traditions. So they compromised. Harry had to wears wizard robes every day except weekend when he allowed to wear muggle clothes. Draco had to follow the deal. He had to wear muggle fashion in the weekend when he had no gala invitation. Then after that they will have a simple lunch in one of muggle restaurants not far from Leaky Cauldron.
Titan, the handsome owl gave him soft hoot, soothing his nerves. He finally calmed down and could opened his second potion without difficulty, chugging the whole flask. He waited until his pain gone, then he emptied his last two potions. he crawled back onto his bed then fell asleep as soon as his head reached the pillow.
" Sev is it okay if I propose Harry before we back to Hogwarts?
After the satisfying lunch, Draco once again grabbed his hand and kissed his knuckles. He finally could talked without interruption.
"Nothing happened mother." He was embarrassed. Was he that loud? He thought he was being quiet.
Sirius, his mate, was killed. Although Sirius not his lifemate bond but he was his lover. He loved him and sometimes he missed his lover. The bond was now broken. He now lived alone without a mate. He could be with Sirius if they weren't be betrayed by Order of Phoenix. He and Sirius would stay together and maybe with Harry if that scumbs didn't wreck his life.
Draco left Severus and looking for his mother. He went to Art room where his mother spent her afternoon, painting. Narcissa was busy with her sketching when Draco knocking the opened door. He let himself came in and sat in the sofa near the easel.
The first door he came to was
Harry rolled his eyes and sighed. “Can I please have it?” He asked.
Harry and Draco open their Christmas gifts.
“Yes, Harry?”
Draco felt another bump. “Well, I don’t have any aunts or uncles and I’ve never known anyone while they were pregnant.” He replied.
Draco thought about it for a moment. He really wanted to give it to him but he thought it might be a little too soon. The look on Harry's face though, he knew he didn’t have a choice but to do it now.
“Well don’t just stand there, Harry. Make yourself at home.” Draco said as he plopped down on a squishy, over stuffed couch.
“Struggle all you want, Harry. You’ll never get free without help.” With that, the man turned away and began undressing.
Immediately, Lily and Emma began
Draco softly cupped Harry’s cheek. “He’s alright, Harry. I already checked on him. But right now, we need to get you to the hospital. I’ll be right back for him. Okay?”
At that moment, a woman with purple hair walked up to the group.
Draco glanced down at his crotch. “I’m not a boy?” He asked, feigning confusion. The smaller boy giggled a little as the blonde started laughing. “I love it, Harry.”
As Draco started to speak, his wand went flying from his pocket and he was thrown into the wall behind him. Then Professor Snape was pulling him up and away from Harry.
“Harry?” Draco called as he knocked
Harry sat up and helped remove his shirt. His hands then went to work undoing the buttons of Draco’s.
to break up with her when I’m not even sure what I am yet.” He finished.
“Are you going to move?” Draco asked, voice laced with lust once again.
Harry quickly glanced in the rear view mirror to make sure the toddler in the back seat was still asleep before responding to Draco.

wanted to go through with it though. He sorely wanted to get back at Sirius for
“How much of that did you hear?” Draco anxiously asked her.
“Harry, are you alright?” The blonde asked as he dropped back to his knees.
“Yes?”
Upon closer inspection, Harry discovered
Draco set the jar down near Harry's hip and tossed his wand across the bed but made sure it was nearby if he needed it. “You can always change your mind if you decide you can’t handle it this way.” He said as he parted Harry's legs and slid between them.
With a very naughty idea suddenly planted in his head, Harry slowly turned over in the blonde’s embrace and pulled the thin sheet that was keeping them apart off of himself. He then slipped his lightly trembling hands under the silver comforter and gripped the base of Draco's erection.
“Why don’t you stay here?” Harry suggested.
At every turnaround, Draco would glare at the door and curse under his breath when it remained closed. He was becoming more afraid as more time passed. It wasn’t supposed to take this long, was it?
listened outside the swinging door to see if he recognized the voices so that
Draco brought a hand to his stinging cheek and looked at Harry in confusion. “What… what was that for?” He asked softly. He wasn’t angry, just confused.
The other mirrored Harry's stance. “I can’t just enjoy dressing this way?”
“Yuh huh.” Said Lily.
Once Harry's crying turned to sniffling and hiccoughing, Draco asked, “Would you like to talk about it?”
A soft tug on his pant leg got Ethan’s attention. “I wanna see.” Said Elliot in his tiny voice.
“There’s nothing wrong with being
Harry’s grip on the handle tightened until his knuckles turned white. “Thanks.” He whispered, unable to look at him, fearing he would burst into tears. Sobbing out a small laugh, he added, “Think you can give me a push?”
Draco wrapped his arms around him and rested his head against the dark haired boy’s. “We can still write to each other and talk through our mirrors every night before we go to bed.”
Neither man answered.
“Exactly. You need to go to
“It’s a mood-evening potion. Usually it’s for pregnant witches or wizards, but Eric is afraid you’ll become emotional during the ceremony. So he’d like you to take it.” She explained in a rush.
Draco smiled a breathtaking smile and reached to his nightstand for his wand. He sat up on his knees, pointed it at his own rear end and muttered two spells Harry didn’t recognize. When he was done he shivered slightly and tossed his wand aside.
“I never said I am,” the teen said with a shrug.
As they continued to kiss, the blonde began thrusting against the younger man again, eliciting sinful moans from him.
Draco tilted his head back enough so his mouth wasn’t covered and replied, “Of course not. I love you! Why would I be mad?”
Harry was exhausted already. He was dying for it to be over with so that they could finally see their baby and hold him or her in their arms. If it weren’t for that particular outcome, Harry would have given up a long time ago.

wanted to know when I’d gotten someone pregnant and when the wedding was going to be. I refused to answer his questions so he sent people to find out for him. He confronted me once he’d learned enough to add to his suspicions. We ended up having a huge fight that ended with me being kicked out.”
“Not even close. But one of your friends is here to see you.” He pointed up at the girl in question.
“Get Emma Haysley.” Draco insisted.
the clicking stopped and it was silent.
Harry looked at Madam Pomfrey. “He’s right, Harry.”
“So uh, if ya don’ mind me askin’, who’s the lucky lady?” Hagrid quietly inquired.
“Can you make your hair orange?” Emma asked a second later. After a moment, orange replaced brown and both girls clapped enthusiastically.
Harry looked his lover up and down. “What did you have in mind?”
Draco looked at his husband over their son’s dark head. “It’s the twenty-first century, Harry. They can co-parent without being in a relationship.”
By the time the other three were done with their meals, Dudley having filled and finished eight plates from the buffet and two from the dessert line, Harry had only eaten half a nugget, three French fries, and hadn’t even opened the little bottle of chocolate milk that came with it.
“Faster, baby, please. More!”

“Where do you suppose she’s going?” Harry asked as the door shut behind her.
“I’ll not have you making a mess of my car.” Vernon seethed as he placed a few bills on the table.

I’d like to talk to you tonight, alone, in the empty classroom in the Charms corridor. Midnight.
When Emma went back to their room, Lily was impatiently undressing and redressing the Barbie dolls. “You were gone forever, Emma!” She shouted exasperatedly.
After a month, things had gotten relatively back to normal, something Harry was rather glad for. It felt a little weird without Ron there, but he hardly noticed with how much time he spent with Draco.
Harry did his best to smile. He felt better knowing her anger was at Ron and not himself for getting him arrested.
They laid together in a comfortable silence just enjoying the feel of the other pressed against them.

“Habit.” Harry replied evasively.
“I suppose, but there’s only one… profession I can think of where a man would wear a dress and come running out of an alley in the middle of the night.”
As those three climbed out of the car,
Because he wanted him to move at his own pace, Draco allowed Harry to control most of the movement. He whispered sweet nothings and kept his caresses gentle and soothing.
Draco helped Harry up and took him back over to the bed. They sat down, hands clasped, in front of the two chairs Madam Pomfrey and Professor Dumbledore were occupying.
Draco just smiled at the shorter boy. “I suppose I am a little biased.” He chuckled.
“Well, well, well, Harry Potter, as I live and breathe.” The brown-haired man said as he leaned against the door frame. “What brings you here, mate?”
He was seething in anger. The man turned toward his front door and didn’t even touch the handle before he realized he’d given Scorpius his keys.

After a few minutes, Madam Pomfrey announced that Ron was perfectly fine except for a few minor bruises on his torso and a nasty shoe print shaped one on the side of his face.
After a few minutes, he announced, “We were supposed to have Harry Potter speak to us tonight, but, unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, he is unable to attend this evening. So instead, please join me in welcoming his husband to the stage, Draco Potter-Malfoy.”
“You okay, Scor?” Ethan asked a few minutes later, having noticed the younger boy’s trepidation.
“No, I’m not.” Harry said weakly and tried to move away from the bigger boy.

The rest of the afternoon went by very uneventfully. His only visitor, other than Madam Pomfrey to check on him, was Hedwig. A letter was tied to her leg. He grabbed it and quickly read:

Ron clapped him on the shoulder and gave him a sad look.
sleepily. With one last kiss, Draco headed for the adjoined bathroom.
“Well, if it’s alright with you Harry, why don’t we just get right into it?” She asked softly.
Draco stepped out of the way so Harry could get in front of the barrier. “The featherweight charm should last long enough to— actually; I’ll just put another one on it.” He did so and then added, “As long as they don’t stop for too long, that will last plenty long enough for you to be able to carry it inside.”
Harry looked away from the piercing silver eyes. “I know.” He whispered as a few more tears trickled onto his cheeks.
When Sirius and Remus arrived on Christmas Eve though, Draco had to make himself scarce. Harry had told him that he didn’t think Sirius would take it too well that he was friends with a Slytherin, let alone a Malfoy.
“Are you boys alright?” Mrs. Weasley
“Harry?”

“There’s a good boy.” Harry said
The first thing Harry did when he woke up was check the time. It was almost two-thirty and the very first thing he felt was irrational anger. He’d slept right through lunch and Draco hadn’t woken up him.
“Congratulations, you have just given birth to a healthy baby boy.” He said as he leaned down to the place the child in Harry's now outstretched arms.
Finally, Madam Pomfrey stood back up to her full height. “You’re fine, young man.”
“I did, Mr. Potter.” She said sensitively.

His head spun when he started hyperventilating and his vision went fuzzy. A moment later he passed out.
The blonde had the decency to look ashamed. “I guess not. That was more your thing with the girls than mine.”
Harry pulled the blanket back and waited until he’d tucked the small boy into bed to reply. “No, Papa’s not mad at Scorpy. Or anyone else. Life just does weird things sometimes and he’s mad at that.” He smiled tightly.
Harry turned around and wrapped his
The blonde attempted to apologize, but gave up quickly and left the room without another word.
Completely miserable, Harry got up and dressed for the day in the only shirt that still fit him, though it was a little snug, that didn’t used to be Dudley’s. He then slowly meandered downstairs to help with one of the few meals they actually made him cook anymore; Sunday breakfast.
“Ginny.” Harry called as he ran
Oliver’s mouth dropped open in shock. “They… what?”
Remus glared at his black haired lover. “He needs help from a professional. Someone who can see the signs that we can’t. Someone he can talk to without feeling judged.” He explained. Sirius gave a growl of his own but was interrupted before he could say anything.
“How many times did you rape Harry? How many times did you take advantage of his loyalty to you?” The man roared.

“The first time.” Draco finished with a squeeze of Harry's hand.
Draco Malfoy, quickly followed by Lucius and Narcissa, marched his way down the aisle toward the almost married pair.
Harry dropped the parchment in disgust. He’d been dreamily reading it all day and it was from Malfoy! Why would he pretend to be Ginny?
“He’s just a little nervous.” Eric explained to the crowd with a playful smile. A few people laughed.
“There has to be something-”
“Good. Now we’re going to be late for class.” The blonde said as he pulled Harry quickly up the stairs.
The two year old shook his head,
“You’re still here?” He asked the other man in surprise.
said quietly as he laid a hand over Harry's sheet covered belly.
When Draco’s fingers touched Harry's arm, the dark-haired boy flinched and tried to move away but he was stuck against the wall.
“I’m sorry, Harry. It kind of slipped out when I told her who told me.” Hermione said feeling properly ashamed.
At the mention of his son, Draco readily agreed before throwing himself on Harry again and sobbing out a ‘thank you.’

he opened the door to see Harry sitting on the floor, half naked, and sobbing.

out of wedlock.
Throughout this, Harry couldn’t help but wonder, not for the first time, what it would feel like to have Draco inside him. He knew from experience the pain it could cause but that didn’t stop him from being curious.
While he waited for Harry to come back, Draco sat back down on his side of the bed and picked up a present from the smaller pile, wondering why there was three.
Draco’s eyes widened and he dashed forward. “What? Really? Where?” He placed his hands on Harry’s belly.
Harry rolled his eyes as he moved to the sink to rinse out his mouth. “What about class?”
“Would you like me to give you this
“Have you ever done this before?”
Harry looked up at him with hazy vision. “Yeah, actually.” He replied with a soft smile. “Let’s uh… go upstairs.”
Harry smiled, knowing full well that his son wasn’t going to like the answer. “It means you’re small and cute.” He replied.
Harry gave him a playful shove on the shoulder and said, “Don’t do that.”
Draco gave him a quick kiss. “We’re
“Harry, what are you looking at?” The blonde asked rhetorically.
“On both of us.” Draco added. “I know you bottom more often than not, but we shouldn’t risk either of us getting pregnant again.”
“Oh, god.” Scorpius panted. “I-I’m gonna… gonna come.”
“Draco, what are you doing here?” A flustered Narcissa asked, nearly dropping the book she was reading in surprise. The blonde man quickly crossed the sun room and deposited a sleepy Elliot into her arms.
“Harry!” Draco screamed when he finally came over their hands and on their stomachs.
“And… we’re married?” Came Harry’s next question, his attention flitting between Draco and the infant.
“I really look okay?” Harry asked skeptically.
“Ready, Harry?”
Each twin took a hold of one of Tonks’ hands and nearly dragged her toward the dining area. “What other stuff can you do?” One of them asked as they retreated.

Soon, Draco’s hand found Harry’s hips and he began grinding the other man against him. It didn’t take long for Harry to take up the motion and he soon found himself spilling his load in his pants.
“Damn it.” Draco said as he sat against the wall next to the toilet. He reached up and flicked the handle to flush the vomit away, not noticing the blood that had accompanied it. “I thought that was done for good this time.”
A week passed and Draco couldn’t get the mysterious blonde out of his head, which was odd because he’d had plenty of one-offs that he never even gave a second thought. There was nothing particularly special about her that he could think of besides the fact that she was hot. But so were all the others.
repeated a little louder and set a hand on the boy’s stomach, rubbing gently.
Harry turned to look at his blonde lover. “Yes, Draco, why so soon?”
“He’s a muggle.”
“WAIT!” A voice suddenly shouted from the back of the room.
“Now say ‘ah’.” The potions professor said as he hovered over the boy with an open vial.
At ten o’clock, Harry put on his cloak and headed down to the court yard and then across the bridge where he and Draco agreed to meet. He was delayed in the entrance hall though. It seemed Neville had spilled a botched potion he had been working on and it was melting everyone’s shoes to the floor. He had to wait on the marble stair case as Professors Snape and McGonagall cleaned it up and got everyone unstuck.
Look at that it's only been 8 years since I last updated this story. But, I knew I'd pick it back up eventually. I would like to apologize for the long wait, but my mental health has not been in a good place. It just seems like the older I get, the worse my anxiety gets.
Not a moment later, Draco was covering her body with his own and kissing her with everything he had. He pulled back for second. “You have been a very naughty girl, making me wait this long.”
“It’s your baby too. And I don’t want that to happen either.” Harry sniffled and buried his face in Draco's chest again.
“That’s not true!” The younger blonde snarled and the paper that was now sitting in the middle of the table burst into flames. Lucius quickly doused the fire as Draco continued a little more calmly, “You don’t know Harry. He wouldn’t have told me he loved me if he didn’t mean it.”
Harry awoke the next morning feeling warm, cozy, and happier than he could ever remember being in his entire life. He could’ve cast the strongest patronus the world had ever seen if he needed to.

“Or you lied because you don’t want to go to the damn infirmary.” Draco supplied.
Harry was just taking a sip of pumpkin juice when he felt a body drop into the seat next to him. He thought nothing of it until a hand slid into his. Startled, he turned just in time to see a smiling Draco before a pair of soft lips was on his.
Luckily, Draco noticed this and placed a comforting arm around his love. “Shhh. It’s okay.” He whispered against Harry’s temple.
“Because, I’ve got a date and I’m already late as it is!” Harry bellowed.
“The little slut!” Ron spat,

Harry looked back without stopping and said, “No that’s ok, Hagrid. I think I know where it is by now.”

“I’m sorry.” Harry said once he’d regained control of himself. “It’s not, I know but, Scorpius here thought
Harry crossed his arms and pouted. “Fine.”
“Scorpius…” The older of the two murmured. He moved from his chair to the edge of the bed. “Remember how I said ‘maybe someday’?”
Harry left first and Draco watched him go with a frown. He didn’t like being secretive about their relationship anymore. They both agreed it was a good idea at first, but now, Draco wanted everyone to know who Harry belonged to and that he belonged to him as well.
“Cool.”
“Draco, everyone’s staring at me.”
“I don’t think that will be necessary, Poppy. But I would like you to accompany me to my office so that you can examine Mr. Weasley. I’d like to talk to him myself before contacting the ministry.” Professor Dumbledore said.

“I’m fine Professor, really.” He said quickly, trying to subtly inch his way toward the door.

As soon as that one passed, Harry sat himself up and mentally prepared himself for the twelve foot trip to the fireplace. That was all he had to do, fire-call the school nurse and wait to be escorted, or mostly likely carried, to the hospital wing as he wasn’t allowed to use any mode of magical transportation.
“Do you want to know what I think?” Harry whispered and put his forehead against Scorpius’ so he could look him dead in his green flecked, gray eyes like it was some big important secret.
“Bye.” He said back.
Draco moved back to the side of the bed. “I can take care of it myself. You just rest.” He said before planting a chaste kiss on the other’s lips.
Harry took the pendant back and put it under his robes. “Thanks, Draco.” He said quietly. He looked up at the blonde with tears shimmering in his bright green eyes and threw himself on him.
Finally, Eric pulled away and stood up. “I’ll be here in the morning with your wedding attire.” He said as he walked toward the door. “Then I have a hair and manicure appointment for you. Okay?”
Draco gave the silent mind-healer a strange look before deciding the truth would be the best option. “Possibly, but I can’t be sure. After I went back to the house, but before I called for aurors, I… used the Killing Curse on him.
rewarded him with another kiss.
“Okay.” The blonde took the parcel and tore it open. “It’s just a rattle, love.” He gave the object a small shake, only to start when it began to vibrate on its own. Draco pointed it away from his face just in time for colorful sparks to shoot out accompanied by, “Congratulations, Harry and Draco!” Chorused in Fred and George’s voices.

The blonde man scrambled up from the bed and ran to the bathroom to relieve himself, leaving the door open in his haste.

Draco smiled and put his hand on his lower abdomen. “It’s already in there.”
Before leaving, she turned back to look at Draco and winked. Then she was gone.
“I’m not hungry.” Harry stated quietly.
Draco, who had been standing just to the right of Harry's vision, had quickly moved to help the, mostly likely, bruised boy off the ground.

After a minute to let his stomach settle, Draco stood back up and rinsed his mouth out. Then he checked himself out one more time before heading back to bed.

Harry’s eyebrows scrunched together. “Um… I don’t know, Harry maybe?”
“We can’t.” Harry finally whined.
The first response came in the form of Scorpius’ sobbing harshly from his spot between his parents.
“No!” The older boy nearly yelled and then forced a small smile. “I probably just needed to get it out. I feel better already.”

Lucius cleared his throat. “I’ve heard some bad things in my time.” He amended.
A sudden small thrust had Harry moaning against the blonde’s neck and whispering his name. He whimpered when the hips pressed against his moved away slightly.
Draco put a hand on the head of both boys. “Papa is going to work at Hogwarts this fall.” He looked at Harry and explained, “I told Minerva I wanted the job at your birthday party.”
“I was in class on the third floor.” Draco said with a soft smile. “And I’m extremely glad I was.” It was then that Harry realized they had reached the fourth floor and were approaching the hospital wing.

The five year old blonde just shrugged and repeated his question more forcefully, “What is a chibi?”
The next morning, Draco's sleep was disturbed once again by Harry struggling in his arms. At first, he thought Harry was having some sort of panic attack.
Harry smiled at the round-faced boy. “Yeah, great.”
Draco wrapped his arms around
“You know, Harry, despite how today ended, I think I’d like to hang out again sometime. Maybe even go on a date?” The blonde man suggested.
Harry nodded and wiped at the tears forming in his eyes as he replied, “This was his first year teaching. The combined stress was too much for him to handle.” He added, “The boys were really upset as well. They didn’t quite understand what Papa was sad about but it was enough for them to feel it too.”
Draco laughed lightly. “Of course, with me, love.”
Draco looked worriedly as his husband of a month. “Did you get any sleep last night?” He asked, voice full of concern.
“Is something wrong?” Draco asked as he gazed down at the mop of dark hair resting on him.

“Come on; just admit you had fun, Sev.” Sirius goaded as the pair of dark-haired men approached the door to number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Downstairs, Emma found Harry in Elliot and James’ bedroom putting them down for a quick nap before dinner.
Harry picked up the parcel he knew would be his own Weasley sweater and block of fudge. Sure enough, he tore open the brown paper to find a black sweater with a shimmery green ‘H’ adorning the chest. Slipping his sweater onto his naked torso, he was pleasantly surprised to find cakes hidden within instead of fudge. Molly likely figured the pair would share.
“Harry.”
Draco had only taken one step when a frighteningly familiar pain shot through his lower back and abdomen. He grabbed his stomach with both hands as tears started building in his eyes. “No, no, no, no, no, NO!” He screamed. “Not again!”
Ever cautious, Harry lowered his wand a bit. “So, you ambush me?”
“What kind of situation? They’re not in any trouble are they?” Oliver asked almost angrily, leaning forward in his seat.

“What’s wrong?” Harry asked as he rubbed the other’s back.
“No. Of course, not.” Scorpius replied and pushed the wand away from his face.
Harry looked at the other with mirth in his eyes. “You have a waterbed!” He exclaimed disbelievingly. “So not fair.”
“Congratulations, boys!” The Patel twins chorused as they vacated their own carriage and walked passed the married couple.
“…And he’s been looking for a way out of the contract ever since.”
“When will the story be printed?” Draco asked as the woman packed away her things.
“What’s that?” Harry asked as he watched the other pour some liquid onto his fingers. One finger slowly pushed passed Harry’s tight ring of muscle and he winced.
Shaking his head, Harry whispered, “Terrified. If they knew… I knew the same thing that happened last time would happen again. I don’t think I could take it.” Draco pulled Harry back into a hug as tears started silently streaming down his cheeks.
Lily turned to her twin and loudly exclaimed, “He’s pretty.”
“Draco!” The older man exclaimed with more than a little surprise in his voice. “This rude child belongs to you? I was sure he was a Potter; he even insinuated as much.”

The chattering of the rest of the family died almost instantly as Harry and Scorpius took the two empty chairs at the oblong table. Their seats were next to each other with Lily on Scorpius’ left and James in his highchair on Harry’s right. On the other side of the blonde baby was Draco.
“What… what does that have to do with me?” Harry finally asked, barely suppressing a stutter.

“Nope. Not old.” The blonde man insisted.

“Alright now, smile.”
Draco stopped and the two seemed to share a few words before the blonde continued on his way, likely to look for a safe point to apparate from.
Once they’d come down from their post-orgasmic bliss, Harry found his wand and cleaned off the drying semen. He dropped it back onto his nightstand before snuggling up to his blonde.
“Ok… I get that. What’s your real name?”
Suddenly the arm around his waist tightened. He felt and heard a sigh being released from the blonde behind him.
The brunette boy leered up at Scorpius. “I’m not ready for you to come.”
Draco chuckled a little and tightened his muscles around the cock inside of him. He reveled in the sound Harry made. “You

“And how’s that?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
“I was in jail for two months and when I got out, they told me he was already in foster care. If I wanted him back, I had to get a real job and a better place to live. Lucius is still watching me and thwarting my attempts though.

Harry sighed contentedly and leaned into Draco’s side. An around came around his shoulders and he whispered, “He’s perfect.”
“I separated them.” He quickly explained. “Now, I have to pee.” He waddled into the now empty room to relieve himself.
Harry wriggled a bit beneath the slightly bigger boy and stated, “I’m sticky.”
The brunette began searching for his women’s clothes. “Well I sure as hell couldn’t just waltz up to you and ask for a shag, now, could I? I’m a man and Harry Potter. I didn’t think that was the best combination to get you in the sack.” He replied hurriedly, pulling on various articles of clothing.
With a sad chuckle of his own, Draco put a hand on Harry's back and used just enough force to get him moving. A moment later, Harry was gone.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. Maybe it’ll help me remember.”
“About what?” Lily asked, playing with the collar of her dad’s robes.
It was reported to this journalist that Draco fell in love with his intended by the end of their first date, a lovely, little affair that took place in Hogsmeade one snowy day in February.
game in two hours and the sun was slowly making its way toward the horizon. This
Draco emerged from the bathroom
Draco noticed the pendant clutched tightly in Harry's hand. He glanced down at his right ring finger to see that he wasn’t wearing his ring. He immediately knew where it was. It was sitting on the sink in his bathroom. He’d taken it off before he got in the shower that morning and forgot to put it back on. Of all the days to do so…
“Oh, what is it?” Draco curiously. He knew the Weasley weren’t the richest family around and wondered what they would’ve gotten them.
Harry came to the conclusion that twelve feet became a lot further in an emergency when he dropped to his knees from the force of another contraction. He managed not to scream, but by the end of it he was nearly in tears.
“I knew I recognized you that day at Diagon Alley when we were eleven.” Harry said sometime later. “And then again on the train. I’ve been in agony for eight years trying to figure out where I’d known you from.”
“Come here.” He said, smiling sexily.
After a few minutes, Draco went about preparing his lover’s waiting hole. He pulled lube from the bedside table and immediately stuck two fingers inside of Harry. The brunette man moaned deeply and pressed himself down on the familiar intrusion.
Harry sank to the floor as well. “Because you’re going to be a father before you’re even out of school.” He answered quietly, on the brink of tears.
Draco ran a hand through his hair and sighed. He knew Harry would’ve asked eventually. “When I was five, my parents told me I was going to have a baby brother or sister. If you thought I was bad during school, I was actually a lot worse when I was little. I was a spoiled brat and the thought of a sibling was horrifying because that meant I wouldn’t get as much attention.
“I love you, Harry.” Draco whispered so as not to disturb the quiet moment.
“You’re gay, Harry? Dumbledore never mentioned that.” Emma said and then added, “Did you know you were gay before or after this all started?”
They two new parents-to-be spent the rest of the day cuddled up in bed, caressing and talking to Harry's stomach.
Harry pouted and grumbled, “Yeah, but you could have told me.”
“I told you not to call me that!” He aimed a kick at his brother’s shin but missed when they were each picked up by the father they inherited their hair color from; though both of them had the Potter gene for untamable hair.
“So… your wife is ok with you bringing home someone like me?” Draco asked, trying to end the silence that was becoming uncomfortable.
There was a grunt from the next room and Draco took a step back so he could see out the door to make sure Harry was still asleep. Apparently, the brunette had flipped over in his sleep and when he couldn’t find his husband’s body, he snuggled up to one of the body pillows.
“These are our daughters, Emma and Lily.” Each girl curtsied as her names was said. “And this sulking teenager is our son, Scorpius. We also have another little boy, Elliot, who’s at home with Harry.”

The woman paused for a moment and turned to look at the little family. “Very few male pregnancies are brought to term with zero complications.

The blonde rolled his eyes at the elf’s antics.
Lucius snorted. “And these girls belong to you, Draco?” He asked with a raised brow. Though it was obvious as the girls had inherited the Malfoy white-blonde hair.
Draco picked up the conversation from there. “Your escapades with my son have resulted in pregnancy.” He stated flatly.
“Surprised by what?”
Harry adjusted the blonde on his lap so that Draco was sitting sideways between his legs, knees bent over Harry's thigh, instead of straddling him, his now limp shaft finally sliding out. He held the taller man tightly against him and replied, “So what if you can’t get pregnant, there’s always me. And even if neither of us are able to have a child again, we can adopt. I know you still want a little girl and you’d love her even if she wasn’t flesh and blood.
“Yes, Harry.” Draco moaned loudly and followed his lover’s request.
“How mean was I?” The blonde boy asked meekly.
“Why can’t I just go home with you?” Harry asked for the thousandth time. “It’s not like Dumbledore will know.”
Dumbledore wrote us this morning and told us what’s been going on. I’m so sorry Harry. But you really should have told someone sooner.

“I took a hair from a muggle girl last summer.” Harlot answered, now completely dressed. “I thought it would make more sense than using someone you might know.”
Harry nodded and leaned up a little for another kiss before Draco took a step back and left before he decided he couldn’t do it.
“You said some pretty horrible things about class and blood purity.” Harry replied.
Harry laid down on his back and stared at the ceiling just as Draco was doing. A few moments later he felt a finger brush against his hand and he opened it so their fingers could link together. He shifted a little so he could comfortably turn his head and observe his husband.
“Good morning, Harry.” The old man said as he sat in a seat next to Harry's bed.

“I’m just frustrated.” He sniffled.
As he pumped the single digit within Harry's arse, Draco began kissing and nipping his way down his throat and chest. When he reached an already hardened nipple, he pulled it into his mouth and worried it between his teeth, causing Harry to arch against him and mewl in pleasure.
“I can’t do that.” Draco said as he sat down next to the crying boy.
Harry held out his hand. “Harry Potter, nice to meet you.”

Harry felt his heart flutter in his chest and tears prickle at his eyes.
“What?! No that’s not possible. Ron and I have been… all year and… no, no he wouldn’t do that.” Hermione said, trying to work out how it could be even remotely possible.
As he moved to pick up another present from his pile, Harry caught a glimpse of Draco’s handwriting and changed his mind about which he would open next. It was a relatively small package wrapped in shiny, gold paper. Just ‘Harry’ was written across the front, nothing more.

Harry took a right turn at the next stop sign and was just starting to get back up to speed, when someone ran out of an alley and tripped in the middle of his lane.
Before they reached their goal though, Harry suddenly squeezed the hand that was still in his and stopped short. The blonde boy turned concerned eyes on his husband only to see him lit up with absolute joy.
“Who the hell was she anyway?”
“I’ve seen the way you look at me.”
“Well, there’s bound to be one the day of and/or after the wedding. Plus when the baby’s born.” The slightly older teen said. “They probably just wanted to save some information for later.”

“Yeah, something’s wrong. Your child woke up and is trying to play hacky sack with my kidney.” Harry replied with a small yawn.
Harry was looking past Draco, thinking very hard about the decision he was about to make. He knew he didn’t want to disappoint Draco but he didn’t want to do it just because he wanted him to either.
Once again confused, Hagrid looked down at the dark-haired, sixteen year old boy and smiled a bit.
“Of course I have a name.” She rolled her eyes. “But you…” She poked him in the chest. “… can call me… Harlot.”
“A bit.” He answered as Ginny pulled a chair over from another bed. She sat down and gripped its arms so hard her knuckles turned white.
Anna gave him a gentle smile. “Alright then. Shall we continue?” She asked as she picked up her supplies once more.
finding it extremely difficult. It just didn’t fit right in his mouth.
“Yes, you may. But when I come back out here, he had better be asleep.” She said sternly.
Draco slid over until he was pressed against Harry's side and rolled so he was half lying on top of him. “I want you.” He stated simply and planted a few kisses along Harry's jaw.
Harry could feel his husband’s frantic heart beat against his own chest as Draco seated himself. He took a moment to calm himself down and to let the other adjust to the intrusion.
“Harry, we nee—”
“Yes.” They accidentally chorused and grinned at each other.
“He was your best friend, you little shit! He would’ve given you everything he had if you’d asked for it! You act as if he asked for the life he has. Harry would give everything to have a normal life!” Snape spat. “I’d kill you but you’re not worth going to prison over!”

Lily and Emma turned their twin, pleading looks on him instead.
“What’s wrong?” A different, but very familiar voice asked. The dark head of hair turned to reveal confused green eyes.
Harry couldn’t help his own small laugh, despite the situation. “That means he thinks you're Draco’s brother, dumbass.
While that was going on with Draco, Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey had knelt next to Harry and started checking him over.
Harry lifted his head so he could see Draco's face. “I never said he didn’t. I said I’m glad

With a watery smile, Harry nodded and Draco gave him a sweet, chaste kiss.
“What’d you name him?” Remus asked, turning back to Draco. “Madam Pomfrey didn’t tell us.”
Harry couldn’t help but turn bright red at the chide, though it wasn’t meant to be.  He shook his head and pulled an identical mirror out of his robes.
“It was?” Draco asked, looking at his fiancé in confusion.
thick from holding back his tears.
“You don’t want more?” The blonde replied just as incredulously.
“That’s part of it…” Draco trailed off. He didn’t want Harry to hate him for the rest of what was causing his fear.
As Harry reemerged from the bathroom, Madam Pomfrey came out of her office. She gave him a sympathetic look of understanding before gesturing for him to sit on the bed he had vacated in his haste.
“Yes.”
“No, Emma’s fine. I like her and I’d really rather not have to tell another person about it.” Harry replied. He glanced down at the form in his hand. “Do you have a quill?”
“Wait…” The brunette suddenly murmured, only two buttons in. He then grabbed the edges of Draco’s shirt and pulled, the remaining buttons flying off in random directions. He looked up at the panting blonde. “Was that okay?” He asked when he was met with silence.
“Of course dear. Is something wrong?” She asked kindly.
The blonde gestured toward a tray on the coffee between them. “Tea? Biscuits?” He offered.
When he sat back up, the blood rushing from his head started making him dizzy. Nausea kicked in and he sped toward the bathroom to empty the contents of his stomach.
Scorpius pouted and crossed his arms over his chest. “No! He went with Uncle Remy to the book store.” He seethed. “And you didn’t answer my question. What is a chibi?!”
With a sigh and drag of his hand through his hair, Draco continued, “Obviously, I couldn’t just leave the kids alone, so… Lucius is with them.”
When Elliot was dressed and tucked
“Good night Harry.” The blond said as he laid down facing away from him.
“And what do you have there?” The blonde asked, gesturing to the item in Harry's hands.
The blonde took it and put it around Harry's neck. The chain was so long that the pendant was more than half way down his torso.
The blonde had been hoping to get a rise out of the Gryffindor. He was again surprised when Harry just sat there and continued to cry.
“I’m… sorry.”
“Please don’t start on that.” Harry groaned as they reached the landing. “I know my moods have been out of whack. I don’t need commentating on it too.” The younger of the two pushed the door opened and walked into the room.
Suddenly a wand was in Ron's face. He went cross-eyed trying to look at the tip of it before looking up at the potions master.
“I’ve seen people come out of a lot worse. I’ve seen
I just want you to know that I still love you and always will. I’ll think about you every time he touches me and I’m sorry our baby will never be.
“You like that?” Ethan asked for the second time.
Fuzzily, Harry watched what he assumed was Snape’s arm waving over the small bundle, doing what though, he didn’t know.
After a few moments, Harry repeated, “Fuck me. Now.”
“I spent weeks in the library trying to figure what to do so you could contact me if you needed to. I wanted it to be inconspicuous but not something you’d forget. It took me several more days after that to get the damn charms right.
They talked as they walked the entire length of Hogsmeade all the way to the Shrieking Shack. Harry explained to Draco how it wasn’t really haunted and what actually caused the noises people used to hear.
It was silent for a while as they each tried to think of any possible way to get Harry out of the contract, keep the baby alive, or preferably, both.
“Knock it off!” Came a snarl from the bed. Both men turned their attention to the two boys. Harry's body language made it extremely obvious that their argument was upsetting him. He was curled into Draco's side, the blonde’s arms wrapped tightly around him as he shook.
Meanwhile, he lined his erection up with the prepared entrance. Draco pushed into the hilt in one smooth motion. Beneath him, Harry moaned incessantly.
Draco eyed Harry warily for a moment but dropped it for now. He’d talk when he was ready. For now, they had to finish getting ready for their first day of school.
That was all Draco needed to hear. He slowly pulled out until just the tip remained and then slammed back in. Harry screamed again, a little in discomfort, but mostly in absolute pleasure.
Finally, Draco raised his hand and waited to be called on. “Professor Snape, may I go to the bathroom?” He drawled lazily. The man nodded so Draco quickly cast a stasis charm on his potion and took it off the heat so it wouldn’t explode while he was gone.

The blonde sighed. He answered honestly, “No I’m not a virgin, Harry.” The other’s face fell. “But if it makes you feel any better, I’m a virgin when it comes to guys.” He added. Oddly enough, it did make him feel better.
Draco held up the ring. His index finger was pressed against the ruby. “They have a charm on them.” He said as he let go of the red gem. Harry looked down at his pendant and watched as the glow faded and the vibrating stopped.

Draco gave the dark-haired man a soft smile. “Yes. Our fifth.” He replied gently.
A soft, breathy moan escaped Harry's lips at the ministrations and his eyes fluttered opened slightly as the pace increased. Just when it was getting to be too much, the movements stopped and Harry groaned in disappointment.
sitting up in his toddler bed, red-faced.
“Hurry up, boy.” Vernon demanded once the check arrived. Harry noted that he’d only spoken to him twice so far and it was the exact same words both times.
“Well, Scorpius is the one who’s pregnant.” Draco helpfully stated. “I think we should ask him what he wants to do first.”

Elliot grinned and pulled the covers up to his chin. “Can I have a story?”
“I can only hope so.” Emma responded with a smile of her own.
Again Harry said nothing so Draco carefully pulled him up off the bed and turned him around, revealing his bleeding rear end.
Draco stepped up next to the young man holding his first grandchild. “So a girl, huh?”

“What’d you do that for?” Scorpius whined, completely ignoring what the man had said, and touched the front of his neck where his shirt had chafed a bit.
“No one really knew about the baby when sixth year ended.” Harry started. “But now, it’s kind of obvious and it’s only gonna get worse. What is everyone gonna think?”
spat, dropping a bucket just inside the door. “That was bloody disgusting.”
Scorpius sniffled, but looked up, blue eyes meeting brown. “Maybe… maybe someday?” He whimpered.
The dark-haired boy in question jerked up right. “’m sorry.” He said with a small yawn.
The headmaster smiled a little and said, “I suppose you don’t feel much like talking.”
“He was saying bad things about Dad.” The boy interjected.
“What took you so long?” Harry asked as he took the first one and loaded his trunk onto it.

As Draco stood up straight to toss his underwear on the tile, Harry’s face redden more and his cock started to harden while he watched the other’s muscles ripple under his skin.

On his way to the table his sisters and Tonks were occupying, the boy bumped into a man hard enough to cause him to stumble. Scorpius only paused long enough to keep his own balance but didn’t bother apologizing, thinking the other person wouldn’t stop him if he got away quickly.
Silence passed between the two men until Draco gave Harry a determined look.
“I want to feel you inside me.” He whispered, pointedly looking at Draco's chin instead of his eyes.

Takes place a little over four months after Scorpius was born.
Hagrid expression softened completely and he backed away from the pair that was still holding hands. “I guess I’ll leave ya ter it then.” He said softly, then turned and walked away.
“What happened?”
“Harry, love, it’s time to wake up.” Draco softly shook his new husband’s shoulder.
his best friend.” Hermione scathingly said to the blonde.
After a minute, Harry gave him the ok to continue, wincing and gasping, but not asking for him to stop, as inch after inch of Draco's prick buried itself inside him.
What could have been seconds or hours later, Harry finally felt pressure against his hole and the tip of a well lubricated finger push through the ring of muscle. He stopped the kiss and took a deep breath to calm himself then nodded for Draco to continue.
“Anyway, what’s up, love?” Draco asked, returning his attention to his daughters.
Draco rested his forehead on Harry's shoulder as the two fell into a sweet silence.
Draco leaned forward and his lips met Harry’s ear. “That was hot.” He breathed before pulling the flesh into his mouth. The pair fell back against the bed again as the older of the two men continued his way down Harry’s body. When he reached the hem of faded jeans, he quickly divested the other of the rest of his clothing.
“Daddy, what’s a chibi?” A small voice asked from the floor.
Draco looked around at all the faces staring up at him. Remus and a very pregnant Sirius were seated on his right, their five year old girl, Lyra, asleep on the former’s lap. His mother was sitting across from him with a small pile of blankets and pillows at her feet. Elliot was sleeping there. On his left, were Scorpius, Emma, and Lily, both girls were perched half way on their big brother. Only one appeared to be asleep. Standing in a back corner was Lucius, surprisingly still there.
“Oh Harry, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.” She said sadly.
Draco eyebrows nearly met his hairline. “You’re Harry Potter?”
After lingering there a moment, Draco continued his path down the willing body beneath him until he was level with Harry's thick, hard cock. His hot breath floated over it and Harry's hips lifted off the bed trying to make contact with, well, anything at this point. But Draco moved up just as Harry did and then pushed him back down.
“Yeah, but this is different. My body feels like it’s on fire knowing that I can’t do much about it.” Harry explained. The blonde suddenly pulled Harry into an alcove behind a nearby tapestry.
At first the blonde didn’t respond, just sat there staring at his lower abdomen incredulously. Then he brought up a hand and poked around under his belly button before laying his hand across it. The corner of his lips twitched a bit until a full blown smile graced his features.
“You!” He gasped as he spun around to face the only other occupant of the room.
“One month. Keep yourself busy and it’ll fly by before you know it.”
Once Draco was satisfied with the hickey he was leaving, he made a wet trail of kisses and nips down to Harry's left nipple, which he wasted absolutely no time pulling it into his mouth and torturing Harry with the sweet pleasure. He then turned his attention to the other and gave it the same treatment.
Lucius looked from the paper to his son to see a look of forced blankness on his face. With a raised eyebrow, the man asked, “Isn’t Potter the one you’ve been gushing about the past two days you’ve been home?”
Happy to obliged, Draco pressed forward, sliding the head of his cock into Harry. He moaned at the wonderful tightness around him.
“Then I’ll make you scare them away.” He replied with a smug smile.

story.” Catching his meaning, Harry hurried off to find a first-aid kit.
Without an answer or a warning, the dark-haired boy was suddenly snuggling into him, the same way he did when they were young. Draco put his arms around Harry and laid his head on top of the one that was resting on his shoulder. Somehow, neither of them felt awkward about it, as if the past eight years never even happened.
Draco pecked him on the lips.
“I want… no, I need you to stay.” Harry said frantically. If he was going to have to retell it again, he was going to need some help this time.

A young witch Harry recognized as the wedding planner said, “It’s almost time, Harry.”
“Yeah, inevitable.” Draco agreed.

I figured that since Harry had reasons for his children's names, that Draco should have one too.
“The only way you and I will ever have sex, is if we’re both completely willing and it’s not a form of payment. And certainly not tonight.” Harry replied resolutely.
Harry nodded his agreement, but then verbally added, “Only if you wear your sweater.”
“I don’t want to keep you from your loved ones so I’ll just get to the point. I spoke with Ms. Haysley and she gave me a brief overview of what you told her.” The headmaster told him. He produced a piece of parchment from his robes and handed it to Harry.
Draco immediately discarded his book on an end table and motioned for Harry to sit next to him. A shy smile graced his lips as the raven-haired boy moved and sat down.

“Are you using a contraceptive charm?” Harry asked, cutting him off. He immediately realized the callous tone he used and added a softer, “I won’t be angry if you’re honest.”
The trio finally stopped outside a large window.
Both blonde girls gasped and immediately turned to look back up at Tonks. “Please?” They begged with clasped hands and puppy dog eyes.
Once the vial was empty, Harry stretched across the bed to grab his wand from its place on his nightstand. Then he touched the tip to Draco's bare stomach and murmured the spell their maternity Healer taught them. A few seconds later it started glowing green and Harry's face lit up. “Afraid or not, it’s happening now.” He said as he looked up to see Draco's reaction.
“Hiya, Harry.” A voice called from the crowd.
When he was near the bottom of the stairs, Harry glanced up at the door to see who was looking for him. He only needed to see the white-blonde hair to know exactly who it was and for him to freeze with his foot in mid-air as he descended the last step.
“Well, I wanted to be an auror for a while but I changed my mind. I think I’d like to be a teacher here at the school. Or maybe start like a pre-Hogwarts wizarding school for younger kids.” Harry said.
“It might take a while but I’m going to do my best to get back on my feet. Until then, I think Scorpius will be happy here.” Draco smiled sadly. When he turned back to the door, a hand gently grabbed his and stopped him.
“Huh?”
“Ready for more, baby?” Draco asked.

“Ok. Why don’t you wake your brother up from his nap and go play before your punishment starts.” Harry suggested as he stood up.
Harry elbowed him and said, “Be nice. She’s my friend.”
“Harry's fine but it’s not over yet. He’s just fully dilated so we’ll probably start hearing screaming soon.” He replied dejectedly. “And Pomfrey kicked me out.”
“How bad do they taste?” Harry asked as he looked at the rather sickly green potion.

All Harry had to say to that was, “Oh.”
“We felt like being lazy tonight so Papa went and got pizza.”
Once the door was closed and locked behind them, Harry threw himself into Draco's embrace and began sobbing into his chest.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Malfoy.” A
Immediately, Draco pressed the head of his cock against Harry’s pucker, the ring of muscle giving way instantaneously. He slowly pushed forward until their hips were flush against each other. Then he waited a moment for the other boy to get used to the intrusion.
As he stepped inside, he slammed
Scorpius nodded his consent while the Healer replied, “By all means.”
Mr. Weasley announced, mostly for Harry and Charlie's benefit. Everyone got up
A few moments later, two sets of hurried footsteps were heard coming down the hall toward Draco's room before the door burst open.
Harry smiled wider and pulled his son into a bone crushing hug. “Well you are not a man. You are a boy and I happen to think all three of you are just the most adorable things I’ve ever seen.” He said against his son’s temple while said boy was trying to wriggle free of his father’s grip.
Harry smirked playfully and stuck his tongue out. “I love you, too. Happy?”
“It’s only a month. It’s only a month. It’s only a month.” Harry repeated under his breath as he followed his red-faced uncle and tried not to hyperventilate.
“I missed you t— mmph” Draco was cut off when Harry suddenly grabbed the back of his head and smashed their lips together. It only took a few seconds for him to be able to feel Harry's growing erection.
“They picked him up from the neighbor that was watching him and went to my place to get some of his stuff. I can tell you they didn’t take two steps into the apartment before deciding I was an unfit parent and most likely didn’t even go into his room, the only bedroom.” Draco explained with watery eyes. “If they had, they would’ve known it was his immediately and might not’ve taken him away. I always made sure his room was absolutely spotless. There was no peeling paint, no dirt, no bugs, or anything.

Harry sighed. “I know you don’t

the motive that bugged him.
Draco smirked around the hard cock in his mouth. He wanted to be Potter’s undoing.
“So…” Harry started, interrupting the silence that had fallen on the room. “What are we gonna do?”
The now twenty year old ran a hand through Scorpius’ hair as he began pushing again. “I’m so sorry. It took forever to get someone to cover my shift at work. No one wanted to come in and the owner only finally took over for me when I threatened to quit over the birth of my child.”
“I… I—” Harry was cut off when Draco suddenly thrust hard into him, jabbing his prostate. “Ooooh. I love you too!” He shouted.
wanted to ask… Does Ginny know?”
Draco absolutely could not believe that
“Yes and no. Apparently, your nineteen year old and our sixteen year old have grown rather fond of each other and that fondness has manifested itself in the form of… a child.” The blonde man slowly and cautiously explained.
With the one year old held tightly in one arm and Elliot’s hand grasping the other, the dark-haired man left the room, leaving a flustered Draco behind them.
Holding hands, Harry’s friends made their way from the room.
“I didn’t touch him!” Draco shouted as he struggled to get out of Snape’s grip. “I did that to Weasley but he hurt Harry. He’s been beating and raping Harry for over two years!”
Draco wiggled the fingers he had buried fully inside Harry and pushed them in just a little bit further. He was rewarded with a loud moan and an exclamation of, “Holy shit!”
Draco groaned in frustration. “We are not having sex on the train, Harry.”
“Why—?” Harry started but was cut off by a gentle finger to his lips.
“I knew he wanted to have it done and I didn’t tell him strictly no. But I did tell him I’d think about it and talk to you.” He gave their son a pointed look. “Just yesterday.”
“I didn’t want you to worry about me, especially since there’s nothing we can do about it.” Harry explained.
So when the young blonde actually
“They’re cute.” Harry said as the blonde set the booties aside. “My turn.” He picked up another present from the baby pile.
Remus rolled his eyes in annoyance. “They aren’t like puppies, Sirius. Babies need constant care at any and all hours of the day and you can’t just give it away if you decide it’s too hard or you don’t want it anymore. It’s for life or not at all and you’ve never been the best with commitment.”
“I can still dress myself, thank
When Harry felt Draco’s fingers touch his skin, his body started reacting. The places he touched tingled and his cock started to embarrassingly harden. He kept his hands over his lap, hoping Draco wouldn’t notice.
“Better?” Draco asked as he put the jar away.
“Whatever.” The teen replied and
By the time Harry reached Scorpius’ crib, the boy was nearly asleep already. He kissed the top of his head and waited for Draco to join them before laying him down.
“Remember, they can’t get married until I come back from going potty.” Emma stated as she pointed at the half dressed dolls that were being set up in a mock wedding.
“How bad?” The blonde panted and nipped the ear near his lips.
The brunette boy froze for a second. No one had asked him that yet and he struggled to find an answer. “I… I don’t really know.” He said brokenly. “He said… something about being friends with me wasn’t what he expected. Like he thought some of my fame would spill onto him just because he was my friend.” There were some other things as well but Harry didn’t want to share those.
My relatives know something is going on and I’m getting a little worried that they might figure it out soon. We both know that could be bad if they do.
“Oh really? And how’s that?” Harry asked with a raised brow.
“What do you mean, ‘she’s a witch’?” Draco cried incredulously.
“Why is Snape here?” The brunette asked, trying to be angry but not having the energy.
“We can keep our boxers on if that makes you feel any better.” Draco said affectionately.
“What’s this?” He asked.
“Well, my story’s not nearly as long, or interesting, as yours. A few years ago I started dating my best friend’s younger sister, Ginny. It was great except for the part where I was ready to settle down, start a family and she wasn’t. We were dating for two years before she ever even moved in with me but she wasn’t actually around most of the time.
touching his arse. “I’ve been thinking about it.” He replied. Then his breath hitched when both of his cheeks were cupped and squeezed tightly.
After Draco spent a few minutes generously feasting on Harry’s delicious manhood, he reached into his bedside table and pulled out a bottle. “It’s not too late to change your mind, Potter.” He quipped as he popped the top open.
Draco, who had been watching Harry and only half listening to what the man was saying, turned toward Sirius. His face was hardened in anger. He pulled his left arm back from around Harry and pulled up his sleeve revealing bare skin.
The small, chair-filled room was so quiet upon the man’s entrance; everyone in there heard him approaching and looked up at him. No one said a word.

“Merlin knows I wanted to tell Dumbledore! But I think I wanted to be your friend even more. Had I told when you asked me not to, you might have felt betrayed all over again.” The blonde explained.

Harry quickly downed the liquid and set the empty vial on the nightstand. “Will you lay down with me?” He asked before the potion started to affect him
“Now that is really none of your business.” Draco replied quickly. Even Scorpius didn’t know the real story behind how Harry and Draco got together. He turned to his son. “It’s almost time for me to speak. Let’s go sit down now.”
Draco wrapped his arms around the other and held him until they were both nearly asleep. At that point, they moved their cuddling to the bed and fell into a peaceful sleep.

The muscles around the Slytherin’s cock tighten and convulsed. Before he knew it, he was coming inside the smaller body. In short order, he collapsed forward.
“You could probably handle anyone.” Draco added and leaned down to peck Harry on the lips. A few wolf whistles were heard from other waiting students.
“Yes! Yesyesyesyesyesyes yes!” Draco shouted and rose from his seat.
Having been halfway in the car,
Mrs. Weasley had apparently invited every single person that Harry had ever
The man appeared just as surprised as he was. “No… not Potter, but you’re certainly his spawn.” The man jeered as he roughly released Scorpius’ collar. “And I’d wager the Weasley girl’s your mother.”
“I don’t know if I can keep anything down right now.” Harry whispered.
The teen thought it over for a minute. He really didn’t feel like being around anyone at the moment, but he was also starving. “What are we having?” He’d let the answer decide for him.

Before Harry could move much, Draco lifted the back of his shirt and could clearly see where the blood was coming from, but there was more than just blood. There was also dried semen.
Draco pulled Harry back to his chest and held him tightly. “It’s ok Harry. It’s not your fault.” He said quietly. Suddenly he was very angry at the redhead for ruining someone so precious.
Harry's face was red and tear-streaked and he looked like he was ready to pass out at any moment.
he was pregnant with the Slytherin’s spawn already.
He stopped, looked back over his shoulder, and said to Draco, “If I ever find out that ya laid a single harmful hand on Harry, I’ll kill ya with me bare hands.”
“Then I started thinking about how much easier it would have been for me and all the muggle-born students if we’d had someplace to teach us things about the wizarding world, like the fact that wizards can get pregnant. That would have been really nice to know beforehand.” Harry explained.
mouth and only just noticed how hard he was when he felt the other’s erection
“Maybe not sleep yet, but I think I’d like to lie down now.” He said quietly, giving his godfathers an apologetic look.
Ethan backed up some as he made his way downward. When he reached the other teen’s denim clad arse, he couldn’t help but to give it a good squeeze. He was startled slightly when he received a soft moan in response.
“Probably to use in other articles.” Draco replied with a soft sigh.
Before the younger blonde could replied, Scorpius chirped, “Harry Potter.”
Kingsley smiled supportively. “Of course, that is completely understandable. Now, who are these beautiful young ladies and the… gentleman behind you?”
“I’ve just informed the headmaster of the situation.” She told him as she sat in a chair.
Harry moved into the room to stand next to Draco. He crouched down before replying, “I thought about what we talked about and okay. Let’s do it.”
Because of his progressing pregnancy, Harry is in need of new clothes. He's not taking it well.

“Kids do that stuff anyway. And, I find it unlikely anyone would hurt us.” Draco softly explained.
Finally, Draco took a deep breath and timidly replied, “You saved my life.”
“Why you are what you are.”
She bent toward his face and placed

“That still doesn’t explain why you became a prostitute.” Harry said as the blonde finished with his bandages. “Surely you could have gotten a job anywhere.”
The small boy nodded. “Yeah.”
Harry wiggled at the tingling, but not unpleasant, sensation that went through his entire lower body. When it stopped, he nodded, indicating that he was ready.
Draco smiled. Apparently the smaller pile was gifts for the baby.
you’ll need to buy new ones every few weeks if you don’t get maternity robes.”
“For what?” Draco asked, trying to get Harry to look at him again. Harry shifted nervously.
Another ten minutes later, Harry
“Hmm, I’d like to examine your birth canal, just to be safe.” The witch said as she stood from her seat. “Please, remove your pants.”
“Do you ever pay attention in class?” Draco shook his head but he was smiling. “It’s like an out of body experience. Only you’re actually outside of your body, not just imagining it. But you’re not corporeal; you don’t have a physical body.”
“Come on. Let’s get you to the floo.” He said softly, leading Harry by the hand toward the living room.
“Well, we’ve known each other for sixteen years, but I don’t think we’ve seen each other since just after your daughters were born.” She replied with a soft smile.
Draco's eyes moved from the picture to the headline, expecting another story about how Harry saved the world and destroyed the darkest wizard of all time. He sputtered in his drink and felt the ceramic cup leave his hand before it smashed on the floor.
“Draco?” Harry asked tiredly.
Before replying, the blonde boy set his lit wand on a dust covered desk and raised his hands to chest level, showing Harry he wasn’t there to harm him. “She’s not coming.” He said at last. “I—”
Hagrid smiled down at the boy. “I s’pose I’ll just make me way down to me hut then.” He said as they neared the end of the bridge.
“I’m scared.” Was the simple reply.
Harry and Draco are interviewed for the Daily Prophet about their upcoming nuptials.
“Planning this for a while, huh, Potter?”
Before leaving the room, he checked on the baby already in his crib. The infant was obviously fighting sleep pretty hard, but it wouldn’t be long before he’d succumb to the sandman.
dinner for Elliot and himself.
“Wait, only me? You were…”
Draco’s hand left Harry’s stomach and both of them came up to cup his face. “I will NOT let that happen.” He stated as he wiped away the tears that were now falling from his beloved’s eyes. “I don’t care what I have to do. I’ll convince him to let you carry it to term so that I can raise it. Even if that means we can never see you again, I won’t let your baby be killed by that man.”
Instead of backing down and apologizing for his mistake, Hagrid turned his gaze back to the blonde boy.
Scorpius took a fearful step backward. “N-nothing.” He stuttered.
The room was silent for a few minutes as Harry contemplated this information.

One finger pushed passed the ring of muscle into the tight heat beyond it. A second followed not long after. They twisted and scissored to accommodate something larger.
“You’re still mad at me?” Harry asked, nuzzling the blonde’s neck.
Before anyone had the chance to answer the rhetorical the question, a scream was heard from the room behind the blonde seventeen year old.
The pair shared a quick kiss before making their way to the tub to share a relaxing bath together.
“No, I just thought it would be funny. And the scorpion didn’t sting anybody.” Scorpius said quietly and finally looked up at his two disappointed fathers.
The old medi-witch walked to a cabinet and came back with a jar filled with a light blue cream.

Five minutes later and they were still trying to catch their breath, only now they were on the floor with Draco kneeling between Harlot’s still spread legs, panting against her collarbone.

“That’s not fair!
and palmed him through his boxers before slipping beneath those as well and
Harry returned the smile and leaned up to close the distance between them. He wrapped his arms around his neck and pulled the blonde down. The weight of Draco on top of him made him feel safe.
Finally coherent again, Harry asked, “WHY did you stop?!”
The blonde chuckled lightly, slid Harry's glasses off his nose so they wouldn’t break in his sleep and placed them on the bedside table. “Good night, Harry.” He whispered and kissed his scarred forehead.
“I’m sorry.” Harry whimpered. “I didn’t know. I thought it was just a stomachache and when I figured it out…” He sobbed. “When I figured it out, I couldn’t move.” The end of his sentence was almost immediately followed by a scream as he was assaulted by more pain.
The article itself was fairly short. Aloud, Lucius read:
“Harry, would you please lift your shirt?” The medi-witch asked kindly.
Meanwhile, the blonde teen was ravishing his unresponsive mouth. The one-sided kiss continued as Draco brought a hand down to cup the raven’s crotch. He couldn’t help but smile when he discovered that Harry was actually half hard already.
“Please what?” Harry teased as he slowly pulled out until just the tip remained and rammed back in.
Harry hissed slightly. It burned, but kind of in a good way.
It was as Draco was washing his hands after using the urinal when he heard someone else walk into the bathroom. He paid them no mind until he heard the click of the lock and glanced up.
“I still feel like I owe you.”
Groggily, Harry watched as Draco

“What would you like to know first, Harry?” Pomfrey asked.
In the car, Harry sat in the back pressed against the door on the passenger side and completely ignored the other three, which was made easier by the fact that they were ignoring him as well. It was only slightly more difficult when Dudley started poking him in the back of the head to rile him up. But the large boy gave up quickly when he got no reaction.
The dark-haired teen quickly did what was suggested. Then he let out a squeak when the older boy suddenly sat on his arse.
A sharp pinch to his thigh brought
“Holy shit.” Harry whispered as he loosened his death grip on the steering wheel. He quickly put the car in park, unbuckled, and jumped out of the vehicle.
Once Harry allowed his hand to relax and be held, he opened his eyes and felt immediate relief at seeing Draco's gray eyes staring down at him in concern.
It was silent between the pair for a few minutes, nothing but the pounding bass making a sound, as Ethan worked the knots from his guest’s shoulders.
Taking a firm hold of her hips, Draco lifted her up the wall and she jumped a little to get her legs wrapped around his waist. She pulled him in close once they were balanced and the head of his cock bumped against her dripping entrance.
Harry arched off the bed as an experienced mouth worked it expertly.
Draco quickly unlocked the door and opened it to find a sobbing Harry on the other side. He had collapsed to his knees while trying to wake the other. In his distress, he couldn’t remember which stones revealed the doorknob.
She smiled and patted him on the shoulder before hurrying off after a group of mischievous looking third years.
It was nearly five minutes before Draco was back pushing two carts in front of him.
Harry picked up Lily and placed her on his hip. “Papa and I have made a decision.”
“And it’ll be tasteful, like you promised?” Harry asked, full of apprehension.
“You should go before I decide to just apparate us away from here.” Draco murmured and forced himself to take a step away from his future husband. Harry nodded a little and turned to grab the handle of his cart.

Once that was taken care of, the blonde rose from his seat and stretched his back before shoving his hands in his pockets and making his way out of the room.

Sirius gave Harry a soft smile. “Don’t mind us.” He said. “We’ll leave you alone so you can rest. We need to speak to Dumbledore anyway.” He stood up and kissed the top of Harry's head. “Love you, Harry.”
the other middle row seat and the twins were seated in the back row, buckled
The dark-haired teen looked at his fairer-haired husband. Draco shook his head, indicating he had nothing to add or ask.
Without a word, Draco stood from his place and made for the door of his husband’s hospital room. “I’m getting a healer.” He said from the door. Harry wouldn’t look at him.
Silvery-blue eyes opened to find the deep jade ones much farther away than he would have liked. Draco frowned a little and beckoned Harry back to him.
Draco piped up first. “For me at least, it was on our first date. We were walking back to the castle from Hogsmeade when Harry here started throwing snowballs at me. We ended up tumbling through the snow a bit and I just knew right then that I loved him.” He turned his attention to Harry. “What about you, love?”
Draco kicked his shoes off before slipping under the covers and cuddling up with Harry, chest to chest.
Harry against his chest and held him until he relaxed.
come out of a lot worse. And I want to help you get better, like any good boyfriend would.” Draco explained.
“Hey, whatever floats your boat, Harry. As long as he’s good to you, I’m good.” Ron explained.
Confused, Draco asked, “Harlot? Are you uh… insinuating something about yourself?”
“We’re late.” Scorpius stated the

“Like the time a gobstone got stuck in my nose?”
Worried, the two men rushed up the stairs, following the sounds of coughing. They reached a door they recognized as Harry’s and flung it open.
“The last time he… you were there, you told me you might need glasses. I laughed and said that glasses were yucky.” Draco said with a small smile on his face. Harry released a breath and couldn’t help the laughter that rose out of him.
As Draco followed, he stopped short. “
“Yeah, of course.” He replied.
Harry sighed and took a hold of his cart, Draco's arm going around his waist as they started walking.
“Honestly, Draco. It’s just your mother, not Voldemort.” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
When Harry focused his attention
“Didn’t think so. When you’ve been wearing a pair for a while and then take them off, it feels kind of like you’re sinking into the floor.” He said as he slowly lowered himself.

shoulder and his eyes popped open without him ever realizing they were closed.
Once Luna and Hermione had vacated the compartment, Draco turned in his seat to fully face his lover. “What’s going on, Harry? You didn’t sleep last night. You’re shaking like a leaf. What’s wrong?” He asked, care and concern shining in his silvery eyes.
“I’ve missed you so much.” Harry mumbled against a pale chest.
Draco turned toward his son with a slight glare. “Go mingle. Just don’t insult or annoy anyone, difficult as that may be for you.”
After giving Potter a day to settle in, Harrison arrived at his relative’s home and immediately proposed. He was ecstatic when Harry screamed his acceptance and leapt into his arms.
Draco and Harlot's next meeting doesn't quite go as planned. It gets better.
“Do you want me to walk you back to you dormitory?” The blonde asked, breaking the silence.
“It didn’t.” Harry blatantly lied without looking at him.
“I’m so sorry, Harry.” Hermione murmured, tears building in her brown eyes.
“We haven’t actually talked about it.” Draco replied. “But if Harry still likes his idea from before, I’m all for it.” He looked at the dark-haired man next to him, expecting to see a nod or smile of agreement. Instead, he saw a deep pain written across his face a moment before large tears began spilling from his eyes.
Harlot nodded in agreement.
Above him, Harry heard the blonde’s breath hitch slightly. As moved his lips down the hard cock, he could hear and feel Draco’s breathing quicken.
“I’ll be right outside that door, waiting, and as soon as it’s alright, I’ll be right here again.” He stated reassuringly.
then he wouldn’t have guilt gnawing at him because Sirius hadn’t done it on
“You’re just figuring that out now?” Harry teased.
“Draco,” Harry whined, “I’m trying
After that, they stopped at the crowded Three Broomsticks for lunch and a couple butterbeers. Harry wasn’t quite ready to make his sexual orientation public yet nor did he want to share his relationship with Draco (not because he was afraid of their reactions but because he wanted to keep him to himself for a while), so they found a booth hidden away from the prying eyes of curious students.
“Five centimeters.” Madam Pomfrey announced once she had lowered Harry's gown. The boy in question groaned in frustration, remembering that that meant he was only half way dilated.
Scorpius sighed. “Me. But I’m still handsome, you just said so.”
“Come on, love.” Draco said as he
Scorpius happily hopped down from the table and ran out of the room. He came back right away though and nearly collided with his father’s legs. “What Papa said before, does that mean I get to go to Hogwarts with you next year?”
“Harry?” He asked again, reaching out for the dark-haired man.
Harry didn’t even realize he was crying until he heard a knock on his bedroom door. He quickly put up a glamour to hide his pregnant state, something he had been doing since he became of age.
things, the blonde stood up and began looking through the ancient tomes. He
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, so glad you and your family could join us.” Kingsley Shacklebolt, the current Minister of Magic, shook Draco’s hand as he greeted him. He then seemed to realize that someone was missing from the group. “Where is Harry?”
Scorpius pushed his dad away. “No, Papa is not cute! Papa is a man and men are supposed to be handsome!” He said sharply and slammed a hand on the table.
The blonde bent down and pulled Harry’s pajamas back up before replying, “I told you, I was thanking you for saving my life.” He then retrieved his wand from the desk behind him.
With a smile of his own, Harry pulled out his wand and dropped the glamour on his body. The robes on his body stretched around the large belly that suddenly appeared.
“I don’t want to.” Harry spat.
Even walking slowly, it didn’t take nearly long enough to get to the barrier. They stopped off to the side so they weren’t in the way of other students and parents crossing into the muggle world.
“I give you five minutes to be alone with him and you reduce him to tears, Granger. What did you say to him?” The blonde asked as he started to comfortingly rub his back. The witch failed to notice Harry immediately start to calm down.
For a few moments Draco just stood there staring at Ron, his chest heaving as he tried to regain his breath. Then he remembered why he beat the ginger into unconsciousness.
Draco opened the door to the infirmary to see Harry curled up and Hermione failing miserably at making him feel better.
After Harry had been gone a couple minutes, Draco made his own way toward the Great Hall. Most of the student body was already present but he could still make out Harry's hair in the crowd. It helped that the brunette was sitting at the end of the table closest to him. He looked at him sadly as he turned toward the Slytherin table.
“Harry, if at any time you want me to stop, just say so. Alright?” Draco asked quietly, his eyes clearly saying, ‘Please don’t make me stop now.’
“Okay, you can move.” The raven-haired teen said a few minutes later.

Draco's heart fluttered as his cock got impossibly harder. He knew just how much this meant to Harry, how much he had to trust him. It made him feel special that Harry actually wanted him that way.
“No, it’s just that you’ve never called me anything like that before. And
“Huh?” He turned his arm so he
“Oh fuck, Harry.” The blonde moaned into the other’s ear. He could already feel his release quickly approaching. And for a moment he marveled at the fact that Harry hadn’t spent himself yet.
“Me? Are you sure?” Draco asked, wanting to be sure Harry was absolutely positive with that decision.
wouldn’t have to shout over the babble of the crowd of parents and students
With a sigh, Draco said, “I suppose. And I thank you for your help this evening, but you’re no longer needed.”
“If you don’t mind me asking…” Harry cleared his throat nervously. “Why do you… why are you…?”
“Quite frankly, Draco, I don’t care what you meant right now.” He sighed and rubbed his forehead. “Obviously, you aren’t dealing with this very well. Just… go. Take the girls downstairs, wake up the boys, and go eat dinner. We’ll be down in a bit.”

child? Especially knowing we could have our own?” He asked.
“Irrelevant.” The blonde said as he pulled a torn out book page from his pocket. He handed the parchment over to Harrison and said, “Read the circled passage.”
“I’m glad you came back again.” Draco broke the silence sometime later.
Harry had thought something was
Harry groaned and rolled onto his back. “Make it quick. What do you want?”
The door shut with a soft snap, immediately plunging Scorpius into darkness as he entered his family home. Suddenly, a single light flared to life.
“I have to remove the fetus by a cesarean section. I’ll cut into your abdomen and remove it and any other evidence of it; otherwise, you’ll die, Harry. Do you understand?” The woman asked.
Harry sighed. “I’m tired, everything’s sore, and I swear I’m peeing twice an hour.” He replied as he took a seat. Draco sat in an empty chair opposite the matron.
“I’m sorry Harry. I just wanted to spend more time with you. I wish we were in the same house.” Draco said as they walked toward his room.
“Mmm, don’t care.”
By the time our Savior left Hogwarts for the year, Harrison knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Harry and he was sure the other felt the same for him.
“Right.” Draco said as he took the jar from the woman.
“The only thing you experienced was pain and betrayal.” Draco said as he repeated his earlier actions, moving further up than before. He let gravity take over and slid back down harder than the first time. A soft gasp escaped Harry's lips and Draco could feel the beginnings of his own pleasure starting up.
“No I haven’t! I’ve been trying to help him get better and turn you in. But every time I’d make some progress with him; you’d beat him back down, in every sense of the fucking word!” Draco yelled as he continued to kick Ron a few more times. He was still laughing though.
At last Draco seemed to think that Harry was ready for the final step. He slid his fingers out and pulled off Harry's cock with a last squelchy suck.
“Well, good news, the baby seems to be in perfect health.” She stated happily.  “And I know I’ve asked before, but would you like to know the baby’s sex?”

already have?” Harry whined as they entered the shop.
Eric did so and everyone watched as his brows slowly rose until they had nearly disappeared into his hair. He laughed nervously. “So, Harry’s not pregnant.”
“The last time I saw you was when I was six. I had finally managed to stop messing up and getting myself beaten. I used to visit you sometimes in the late evening when you’d already be in bed. Remember?” Harry explained softly.
When he reached the correct door, Harry hesitated, suddenly fearful that Ginny might want to tell him she lost her feelings for him in the time they were apart. Or maybe that she had stronger feelings for someone else now. The warm bubble of hope in his chest convinced him to turn the knob.
With an amused shake of his head, Draco made his way back to Harry and climbed into his side of the bed. “I’ll stay until you fall asleep. Will that make you happy?” He asked as he settled in behind the other boy.
“BECAUSE I DIDN’T KNOW!”  Scorpius screamed. His face was red and wet with tears.
As soon as he heard Harry called “Potty” he whipped around and smiled breathtakingly.
need to get some sleep.”
“Are you ok, Harry?” Draco asked. He worried about what the letter might have contained.
Once again, the pair found the bed. The blonde young man slowly removed the shirt and single sock Harry had managed to put back on.
“How did the son of the richest man in the country end up living like this?” The question was rushed, almost like he was afraid or ashamed of asking.
“Harry.” The blonde called, catching his attention before he could leave the room.
When she moved away to continue
“Too late.”
“Absolutely.”
Draco slithered back up the lightly tanned body beneath him and resumed a playful dance with their tongues.
“There is such a thing as Healer-Patient confidentiality but because you were technically not her patient yet, there was nothing stopping her from telling me anything. If you sign that, you will become her patient legally and magically.
“Have you ever fought with Mr. Potter?” Was the next question the headmaster asked.
Neither of them spoke again after that and they both drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
“She has a first name. I’d appreciate it if you used it.” Harry stated pointedly.
The medi-witch sighed. “You are a very fertile young man, Mr. Potter. I suggest starting on a contraceptive potion once this little one is born.” She said as she gathered up her equipment to put it away.
“However, if we could get a copy of the contract, there might be a chance of finding a loophole.” Lucius explained.
“Yeah.” Was Harry's quiet answer.

to his zipper after a minute and pulled it down. One of them then snaked inside
Draco blanched slightly. “The answer is gonna sound pretentious.” He replied. “Tradition. We can’t exactly have a baby out of wedlock, now can we? And I thought it would be easier to get it out of the way during summer holiday than trying to deal with school, pregnancy, and planning a wedding.”
When he was allowed to breathe again, it took Draco several minutes to be able to form a full sentence. “Will you… at least tell me… your name?”
“Ok, Daddy.” They chorused and hopped off their chairs. They took their dirty dishes to the sink before shuffling from the room.
from.
“Shhh. Shhh.” Draco pulled Harry into a tight hug. “He’ll never hurt us again. He can’t anymore. Weasley didn’t make it.”
After a few minutes of being led in what felt like circles, Harry heard their footsteps start to echo and then a door close behind him.
toward the boy Draco was holding.
He looked at her and thought for a moment. “Why are you wearing muggle clothes?”
Just then there was a soft knock at the open door behind Draco.
“Either way, I already know what it is.” Draco said smugly.
She went back to the cupboard and brought back a clear vial filled with a potion that continuously changed from pink to blue and back again.
The dark-haired man gave an exasperated sigh. “They are not. I’ve seen plenty of guys with pierced ears. Fred and George each have an earring.”
“Harry?” Still no response.
“Thanks.” Harry said hastily as he jumped out of the car, the rain starting to fall just a bit harder. He hurried to open the back door and unbuckle the small child from the car seat without waking him.
“Get up, boy, and help your aunt make breakfast.” Vernon roared.
They let go of each other and quickly undressed down to their boxers. Then they slipped into the bubble filled water.
“Married to whom, exactly?” Lucius asked, obviously noticing the lack of an answer to this burning question.
All the while, Draco continued to, almost imperceptibly, add his ring ringer to the tightness inside Harry.
“Brilliant.” He replied, chest heaving and a hand still resting on his stomach.
“We have an unconscious person,” Harry told the lady behind the counter.
As he was about to shut the door, another one opened and Harry stepped out in nothing but a pair of low riding pajama pants.
semi-smugly. They then took the last few steps to the car, Harry opening up the
“Can I… kiss you?” He asked cautiously.
Just then, a door leading outside
With a sigh, Draco slid down so he was lying next to Harry and pulled the smaller boy tightly against him. “If this is the only one you want, it is the only one we’ll have. If you want fifty children, one way or another, we
I can do for you, I’ve been told I’m… good if that’s what you want.” The blonde sounded depressed as he spoke.
Draco smirked at his son. “You look
Draco wiped his eyes and leaned against the back of the couch to stare up at the ceiling. “I was arrested recently, an occupational hazard, for the third time. The first time they gave me a warning, the second my father heard about it and actually
The trip from the dungeons to the fourth floor seemed to last an eternity to Harry. In that time, he had three more contractions and managed to stay quiet through the first two.
“This is our son.” Draco said as he walked around the bed to place the sleeping infant in his husband’s arms.
Draco rarely fucked the same person twice and Harry wasn’t willing to risk
The answer became obvious when a guilty look crossed the blonde’s face and Draco turned his head away with a small cough. “Not… exactly.” He replied as he put a featherweight charm on Harry's trunk so the pregnant boy would be able to lift it.
“Don’t do that!” He reprimanded and smacked Draco in the shoulder. “And what do you think?!”
“That feels… so good.” He breathed and leaned forward to kiss the younger boy as he started a slow, but firm pace.

There was a short, awkward silence. “So… do you know anything else about him? His last name?” Harry finally asked, returning to the subject.

two-year-old on Harry's hip added with a scowl that could rival Draco's.
“Harry, you can’t just let him keep doing this to you. You need to tell Dumbledore and if you won’t, I will.” The blonde said as he stood up. “Come on. I’m going to take you to the hospital wing.”
Remus took it upon himself to get the conversation back to where it was before Harry's relationship status had come to light. “Is what he said true, Harry? Is Ron the one who hurt you?” He asked softly.
“Just what the bloody hell is going on here?” Vernon shouted. “You’ve been writing letters to those other freaks?! Are more of them going to be showing up at my doorstep?!” The man quickly rose to his feet, the chair he was sitting in creaking in protest at the sudden harsh treatment.
“Draco, you’ve had
love was the topic of conversation.
“I love you, too.” He replied with a smile.
Draco gave him a soft smile and nodded. Then he reached across the bed for his wand and cast the spell on Harry's arse.
“Hey.” Draco softly said after a few moments of silence. He brought his hand to Harry's chin and tilted his head up so they were looking at each other. “I love you.”
Harry took a shuddery breath. “I… yeah, I’m just tired.” He replied.
They walked into the kitchen where Harry picked Emma up and set her on the counter so that they were near eye level with each other. “Now, what’s wrong?”
When two weeks had passed, Draco began asking around about her but no one seemed to know who she was. He began fearing for his sanity.
The raven-haired man stood from his seat. “I’m going to go lie down while the little ones finish their nap.”
Ethan gave him a small smile. “I won’t make any promises, but
Draco got up as well, picking the blanket as he did so. The small family then made their way into the nursery to put the infant to bed.
“Shut up, Pansy!” He cautioned.
Harry was bored. And angry, and tired, and sweaty. His back hurt, his feet hurt, he could hardly walk without assistance, and worst of all, in his bias opinion, he was horny as hell and could do nothing about it.
“Caesarian?”
For one, Draco seemed to have calmed down considerably. His eyes were closed now and his free hand was resting on his stomach. Harry started rubbing the back of the hand in his with his thumb as his brow furrowed. Something in his brain was trying to make sense with what he was currently looking at and the conversation they had just had.
of August, our young savior, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy will be joined as one.
“Wow. You’re a really good kisser.” The smaller boy said as Draco sat them down on the couch.
Harry lowered his wand and the force field flickered and disappeared. Then he walked over to Draco and took his hand.
“Really?” Harry asked. “I’d never kissed anybody before.” He blushed in embarrassment.
Once comfortable, Harry addressed the package in Draco’s hand. “Who’s that for?” He asked with a nodded toward it.
Scorpius released a breath, having hoped she was done pestering him. “No, it’ll go away by itself.” He finally said.
When Draco turned around, it was to see Harry with his eyes closed and his head
again.
In a flash, Harry was across the room and literally jumped on Draco, nearly knocking them both to the floor.
“I got this at the apothecary in Hogsmeade last weekend.” He said as he sat back down, a small jar in his hand. “Do you want to put it on yourself or do you want me to do it?”
“Well, it sounds like you were both doing everything right. With women, one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, one in three for men. Sometimes, it just happens.” Healer Janus said.
“I’ll do it.” Draco replied without
As he was pushing open the door to
It was nearly a week later that Draco triumphantly held the messy, hastily written letter from Harry stating to be at his house at six o’clock the next evening. It was messy because Harry had been afraid if he didn’t write it quickly, he would chicken out before he even signed it.
“Don’t you dare touch him again.” Draco seethed.
“Yeah?” Harry said when the matron paused.
“We’re letting him keep them, aren’t we?” Draco asked, sighing in resignation.
Harry was on the floor, his face covered in spunk and surrounded by broken glass. Above him was another naked man.
“Why don’t you tell me what happened?”
“Well, maybe not
When they reached the door, Harry scurried back to his friends and grabbed his bag. Without so much as a word to any of them, he quickly went back to the waiting Draco.
Warnings: None
It was so much more than just a kiss. It was filled with feelings that couldn’t be put into words and silent declarations of love. And when Draco ended it, it was only because he couldn’t keep silent any longer.
Draco closed the jar and handed it back to Madam Pomfrey.
“I’ll be in my office if you need me.” The potions master said as he stalked toward the door.
He sat up as he turned back to Harry and slid over to him. Showing him his wand, Draco said, “I can prepare you the easy way, ensuring it’ll be done right. Or…” He showed him the jar in his other hand. “I can do it myself and hope that it’ll be enough. Which will it be?”
quite fond of doing his hair himself instead of using magic to put in place.
“Yeah, though he never said why.” Harry replied and looked quizzically at his fiancé.
“Well that was fun.” She said with
The kiss grew heated as their tongues battled within each other’s mouth. Harry moaned into it when one of Draco's hands slid under him to cup his ass. The other one moved away from its place at his side but he didn’t give it a second thought.
“Really? Then what… oh. I didn’ know ya were that way, Harry.” He said, surprised.
Harry stared up at the man. He had wavy brown hair that was messily pushed back, a few strands falling over his face. His eyes were a deep brown that almost seemed black and his voice made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand on end. This Eric Harrison had a very smooth personality that made it seem like he was very good at hiding things.
“I think so, as long as you weren’t lying to me.” Harry replied.
wardrobe and unzipped it to reveal his dress robes for the celebration.
Scorpius rolled his eyes but stopped the music and sat up. “Sure, whatever.” He mumbled.
The kissing began again and the pair of boys spent the next few minutes rocking against each other, just enjoying the feel of the other.
He explained.
“We’re not first time parents.” Harry stated before Draco could reply.
later and all signs
Lucius pulled out an empty chair and gracefully took a seat. “I was hoping we could talk and catch up. You
The house elf ‘eepped’ and spun around at the familiar voice, tripping on his socks and falling on his face as he did so.
Harry blinked and a few tears fell from his damp eyes. “I… Ron… he beat me and… the baby…” He placed a hand on his slightly bulged belly. “He killed it.” The man suddenly sobbed, his head hanging sadly.
Once he was fully seated, Draco opened his eyes again to see a wide-eyed Harry with a hand placed firmly over his own mouth. “Is something wrong?” He asked.
Harry's arms came around him and when he started pushing in, his nails dug into his back. But Draco paid it no mind as he was sure what the other was feeling was worse. When the head slipped passed the tight ring, Draco paused to allow Harry time to adjust.
Harry, still breathing hard, glanced back at him and replied, “Brilliant.”
“When we learned of your first pregnancy, it was very obvious you didn’t know it was possible and you were in shock. Because of that, I decided to wait until a later date when you had fully processed the information. That’s why I gave you that book.
Once Harry’s opening was good and stretched, Draco sat back on his knees and ordered, “Turn over.”
Emma leaned forward and placed what she hoped was a comforting hand on Harry’s shoulder. “It’s alright, Harry. You can cry if you need to.”
SMACK!
“As is required to be a potions master, I have an extensive amount of medical knowledge.” The dour man replied.
Emma was dressed in a light blue
“I have to say,” Draco started with a cool smirk in place. “If this is how all of our meetings will go, I hope we meet more often.”
“Yeah, but I didn’t think that meant I’d have to bottom constantly until I was actually pregnant.” He hissed softly when a second finger slid in with the first.
Once fully naked, Ron turned back to his hostage with an angry, red hard-on. He pointed his wand at the bound man on the bed and gave it a flick. Harry’s bathrobe flew from his body to land haphazardly across the room.
“He is good to me.” Harry said with a cheesy grin.
Harry huffed and threw the book he was trying to read on the floor. He was even grouchier than usual due to the fact that he was feeling extremely restless but could hardly move to do anything. His body was also achier than normal.

Draco spun around immediately and tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. “Damn it.” He muttered and weakly hit the wooden surface with his fist.

happen to say something.”
Just as last time, she leaned in for a quick kiss and responded with, “Maybe.”
Once they were full to bursting, Draco paid the bill, after much protesting from Harry, and they ventured back out into the chilly February afternoon. They made a trip down the street between the shops before Harry decided to drag Draco into Honeydukes.

“Me!” She giggled and leaned against the wall next to the door.
“It’s lubricant that also contains mild pain relieving properties.” The other boy replied.
“Hello?? Earth to Draco. Are you going to continue or what?” Harry asked as he poked him with his foot again. Draco retaliated by hitting that spot again.
The engagement announcement was in the
Draco suddenly sat up, the dark-haired boy still in his arms. “I’m not giving up. I still have a day to figure this out.” He insisted.

“Scorpius…” He started softly, gaining the younger teen’s attention. “I do care about you, but I’m just not ready for a serious relationship. I won’t abandon this baby though. I promise. I’ll be there for you.” He laid a hand on the other teen’s shoulder.
Harry listened for another minute
It was silent for a few minutes and Harry was nearly asleep again when a hand touched his thigh before sliding up it. The touches were so light though that they didn’t disturb him. The hand gripped his already half hard cock and started stroking it to full size.
“Harry!”
Harry backed as far away from him as he could but found himself against the headboard of his bed. Why did the Dursleys have to leave them to talk in private?
Harry wasn’t very hungry though. He was too busy thinking about Draco and what he might have been doing at that moment.
In the top bedroom of the house,
“So what did you do these past two weeks, that you haven’t already told me?” Harry asked as he snuggled into the blonde’s side.
Draco glared at Harry for telling while the brunette answered for him. “He was afraid of you.”
The man walked over and sat her on one of the twin beds. “Come here, Emma.” The girl in question stood up and moved to sit next to her sister. “We’ve decided we’re not gonna have any more babies.”
“Hello Harry.” She said kindly as she walked over to them. “I’m Healer Emma Haysley. You can call me Emma.” She held out her hand for him to shake but he didn’t move. “Right.” She awkwardly pulled her hand back.
made the two cups and then sat at the table to drink his own. A few minutes
When Draco closed the door behind them, he said, “Harry, you’re welcome here anytime you like.” Then he pointed out which three stones made the knob appear.
“Harry, are you okay?” The blonde placed a hand on his husband’s damp face. “Harry, can you answer me?”
“I don’t
Harry woke up the next morning with cold stone beneath him and a warm body behind him. For a minute he had trouble remembering why he was on the floor. He smiled when it came back to him though.

and then you were talking to yourself.” Ginny replied in place of her mother. Harry
Slowly, Harry lowered them to the floor of the shower and turned around so he was leaning against the wall and Draco was resting on his lap. He felt along the wall above him for the knob to turn off the water before wrapping his arms around the distraught man.
He whispered as they left the room, partially closing the door behind them.
“The call came from an abortion clinic.” Draco's jaw dropped. “By the time she came home a few hours later, I’d hired some movers to get her stuff out of my house and had destroyed half of this room. I had also changed all the locks. I haven’t spoken to her since she left the house that morning.
Harry nodded.
“Aaahhh… faa… faster.” He pleaded as Harry repeated the process, striking that special spot dead on. Draco's mouth fell open in a silent scream.
“Bathroom. Brush my teeth.” He replied as he made his way to the loo, stark naked.
Draco chuckled lightly. “I am
in prison for 15 years.”
beneath his pants.
“Can you make it longer, like, ten feet long?” One of the twins asked.
“Can Draco come back in?”
Harry shook his head forcefully.  “Of course, not!” He stated. “But there was one time… it was dark and Draco was particularly insatiable, he accidentally stuck...

“Okay, you’re turn.”
Harry tickled the infant again and giggled with him before turning to his husband, looking less than amused. “Can I ask you something?”
Harlot blushed a deep red. “I should go.” She stammered and quickly headed for the door.
“I know that!” Scorpius said with all the haughtiness of a Malfoy. “But what does it mean?”
“But… if he never got the chance to hurt me, why can’t I remember?” Harry asked again. “And, why am I even in the hospital if I’m not hurt?”

“Don’t, Draco. Just don’t.” Harry said when Draco tried to speak again.

Harry nodded. “I want to know what it’s like to be made love to properly.” He answered softly, finally looking into Draco's shining silvery eyes.
After turning off the tap, Harry
asked.
“I think once a week will be fine. You seem like a very resilient young man, Harry.” She said with a kind smile. “Which makes me wonder, is there anyone else who already knew about all this, someone who’s been trying to help you?” She asked.
Scorpius froze for half a second but quickly shook it off.  Parents tend to see everything though.
Harry sputtered and choked on his early afternoon tea. The owner of that voice wasn’t supposed to be home right now.
Harry placed a kiss behind Draco's ear and asked, “You want me to help with that, love?”
“Move already.” Draco demanded when several minutes had past and nothing had happened. He realized that Harry was gazing lovingly at his abdomen where his hand still rested. That was lovely and all but Draco wanted sex. So he tightened his muscles around the cock inside him and pulled off as much as he could in his position.

“Fine. But no wandering hands. I’m sore and we’re already behind as it is.” Harry stated and pulled Draco's hand, which was heading for his crotch, off of him.
When the car stopped, the trunk was popped and Harry moved to get his things as Dudley and Aunt Petunia went inside. Vernon stayed to make sure nothing weird happened to his car.

“Nooooo.” Harry whined petulantly, a clear sign that sleep was needed. “What if he needs me?”
“I don’t care until
“Harry. And if you want to hear it, it’ll cost you.” He finished as he stuffed the dirty cloth back into his purse.
“Sure.”

Harry took advantage of the open orifice and shoved his tongue in, mimicking his movements further down their bodies only at the speed the blonde wanted. He swallowed the moan Draco let out at the action.
Harry had been pleasantly surprised when nothing showed up in the paper about his ordeal, even after that much time. It appeared the ministry had decided to keep it quiet. Though, he suspected Dumbledore might have had something to do with it.

Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy met in school, though their relationship was rocky at best. It would be several years before the pair would confess their love for one another shortly after the beginning of their whirlwind affair.
Harry strained his ears trying to make out what was being said but it was made impossible when Dudley’s thunderous footsteps were heard coming down the stairs. He turned back to the stove and used a fork to flip the bacon.
Scorpius was confused again. “But I thought Daddy was like our Mommy?”
Harry carefully removed the brown paper and set with the already discarded wrappings. He laughed delightfully when he saw the tiny Weasley sweater Molly had knitted, adorned with a green letter ‘B’ for Baby.”
Suddenly, the door flew open.
As she passed it to the traumatized, younger man, she said, “Tell me, do you see a sixteen year old?”
“I… I don’t know. I wasn’t planning on getting married or having a family any time soon.” He quietly replied.
“Harry!” He exclaimed as he hurried over to him. “What happened?” He asked as he knelt next to him.
“I guess.” The boy answered as he shifted uncomfortably under his parents’ scrutiny.

Draco handed the keys to Scorpius. “Unbuckle your brother for me, take Lily and
replied with, “Trow up.” But Draco heard it more as “Trop.”
Managing a tiny smile, Harry replied, “I love you, too.” He barely had the words out before he was pulled into a fierce good-bye kiss, earning them some unseen glares from parents for such a public display of affection.
After a few minutes, Harry broke the kiss and rested his head where Draco's shoulder met his neck, breathing heavily against his throat as his thrusting sped up and became more erratic.
“I want it over now!” Harry suddenly spat, startling the blonde.
“Almost three months.” Draco whispered with his eyes on the floor.
“Harry, you have to listen to Madam Pomfrey, ok?” He asked gently.
“You can’t do that.” She hissed.
“What’s wrong with the robes I

“I had it for a week before I even read it. I was too afraid that it was rejection from you. When I finally did read it, I immediately started looking for a solution and completely forgot about writing you back.” Draco explained.
How did little Olivia come to be anyway?
“What’s that?” Draco asked, gesturing to a dark spot on the floor. He moved his wand closer until he could clearly see that it was a pool of blood. He then stepped around Harry and saw that the bottom of his night shirt was also covered in blood.
Harry pulled back a bit to look Draco in the face. “How do you know?” He argued.
“I’m not going to hurt you, Harry.” Draco muttered softly against the brunette’s temple and kissed it.
didn’t.” He said with a small smile and another yawn.
The pair fell into an amiable silence as they watched each other with Draco waiting for Harry to make the next move. And Harry, well he was trying to make that move.
Harry nodded delightfully and reached for his husband’s hand. With the other, he lifted his shirt.
Harry then told her of the first time Ron had hit him and the first time he was raped by him. It took a lot longer to tell Emma than it did to tell Draco.
Harry sat back down and sighed again. “No, he doesn’t hate you. We could never hate you.” He put an arm around the boy’s shoulders and Scorpius rested his head on him. “Now, what do you mean you didn’t know?”
“Where’d you get the DNA, by the way?” Draco asked. “I’ve never seen her before.”
It took only a few seconds for Draco to notice Harry hadn’t finished yet. He quickly took hold of the brunette’s erection and had him spilling over his hand in no time.
“Sweet Merlin, Harry, we have a kid.” He gasped.
standing right in front of him.
“Yes, you may. Next time, raise your hand.” Snape replied.
Above him, Harry loudly moaned his appreciation.

Harry thought he heard voices coming from the living room. For a moment he thought
Draco sarcastically rolled his eyes. “Gee, thanks. I pour my heart out to you and all I get in reply is, ‘I’m sticky’.”
With a bit of careful maneuvering, Draco managed to get a good hold on the

Flipping over, Draco asked, “What is it, Harry?”
“Anyway, I have to go.” He gave his mother a swift kiss on the cheek, tousled his son’s hair, and left.
“That is a long story…” Draco trailed off, realizing he didn’t know his helper’s name.
Harry giggled.

Harry dropped a few pieces of clothing in his trunk. “I don’t know.” He answered with a small smirk and a shrug.
Another sniffle preceded Harry’s
“I don’t know to be honest.” Harry said nonchalantly. “But you’re welcome to give it a try.” He gestured to his crotch where there was a rapidly growing bulge hidden by his loose pajama pants. Then he put his hands under his head and stared up at the blonde.
“What? I specifically told him to stay away from you, that you wanted nothing to do with him anymore.” The woman angrily stated.
Harry's astonishment doubled when the small boy ran passed him and straight into Draco's arms, who was now kneeling on the ground. The room was silent, except for the sounds of the two blondes crying together.
A few moments later, Narcissa entered the sitting room the boys were occupying with a middle-aged woman in tow. “Draco, Harry, this is Anna Manuel. She’s here for your interview.”
“Yeah, sleep sounds nice.” The brunette whispered as he snuggled into the warm body holding him. He fell asleep quickly to the sound of the blonde’s heartbeat.
Nervously, Harry said, “I was having sex with my boyfriend, not Malfoy, and we were trying something new. It didn’t go to well.”
“It’s so we can talk to each other when we’re not together.” Harry explained. “You say my name and you can see me and I can see you. Sirius gave me this one last year. I wrote him a letter a few days ago and asked him if I could have his so I could give it to someone. He seemed rather excited about it. I think he thought it was for a boy.”
Draco, sensing Harry’s continued anxiety, knelt in front of the other man. He slid the round glasses off the other’s face before taking it in both hands. Their lips met in a tender kiss that lasted but a moment. “We don’t have to do this, you know?” He started. “We could just hang out.”
Harry reached for his wand on the nightstand and removed the glamour. His shirt tightened as his stomach grew. At nearly six months, he was more the half the size he would be by the end.
Harry giggled and Draco smirked at Sirius' ridiculous reasoning for seeing the two boys so close. The man sank into the other chair next to Remus.
Hermione looked down at Harry to see he had stopped crying and that his head was resting comfortably on Draco's shoulder.
Several more weeks passed before Draco had any contact with “Harlot” whatsoever. Not a single glimpse of that reddish-blonde hair or the sound of her voice. He once thought he heard her giggling only to dash around the corner and see it was just the Weasley chit.
Zachary, the boy who threw up, a lot today.”
Without replying, Emma laid her head on his arm and looked down at the sleeping blonde baby. The three of them sat like that until Harry determined that James was asleep enough to be put in his crib. He then kissed the sleeping three year old on the forehead before taking his daughter’s hand and leading her out of the room.

Finally, Sirius shook his head and rubbed his eyes. “Have I died and gone to hell? And my eternal punishment is to see my loved ones paired with people I hate?” Sirius asked incredulously.
know how it feels” He said and raised himself up and inch or so before dropping back down.
“Right,” Sirius said awkwardly.
“At least you won’t be alone.” Draco said.
The blonde chuckled but complied.
“So why’d you stop me?” He asked once the moment passed.
