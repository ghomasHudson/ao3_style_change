thin ice right now,” his voice was rumbling like thunder as he spoke, lightning flashing in his eyes. Harry’s heart raced, but he held his ground determinedly, both legs on the ground, arms firmly on his sides.
Harry thought it odd but pleasant in a way to learn such things about Malfoy. Things that made him a little more human and a little less… well,
Now Rose had taken Ben under her wing, and was patiently presenting him with various Christmas decorations, with the little boy’s eyes wide with curiosity towards the shining gold and different sized bells he loved to shake.
Harry’s jaw dropped a little seeing him. Even now he hadn’t thought that he’d ever see the man again. “Malfoy? Wh–“
“That’s smart, we can do something together on the weekend,” Harry appreciated Hermione’s attempts at including him in their life, but he didn’t want to impose, so he settled for a polite nod. He felt like any time he was visiting them more than once a month, he was somehow intruding in their family life, like he was a fourth, soon to be fifth, wheel in the group.
For Draco, though, Harry had really played all his cards to get him to no time served in Azkaban. He testified that Draco was forced to become a Death Eater in order for Voldemort to punish Lucius for failing to obtain the prophecy from the Department of Mysteries. Harry turned into evidence Snape’s Pensieve memories of him and Dumbledore agreeing that when the time came, Snape should be the one to kill Dumbledore, not Draco. He had also told the judge directly, that he had been in the Astronomy Tower that night, and that if Draco had truly intended to kill Dumbledore, he would have gone ahead with it without hesitation. Harry also testified that Draco saved his life in the Malfoy Manor by lying that he could not recognize Harry after the Stinging Jinx Hermione had performed on him. All of this was luckily enough for the Wizengamot to be convinced of Draco’s relative innocence, and they only assigned a heavy fine on him for destruction of government property.
Malfoy made a humming sound as a sign of him processing the information, sprawling his legs lazily and staring into the distance. “Well, I’m sure you’ve found a suitable bride to continue your mediocre lineage.”
The blond git gave a huff that was nearing a laugh and turned around in his chair to look at Harry once again. “That must be the kindest thing you’ve ever said to me, Potter,” a smirk was hovering in the corner of his mouth, making Harry more uneasy under the man’s gaze. The moment was too intimate, Malfoy was in his
Despite having taken an accidental four-hour nap earlier in the day, Harry had slept like a baby in Malfoy’s bed, his other leg on top of the man, and a blonde head on his shoulder. He hadn’t had any dreams, and had only been woken up by the sun shining directly into his eyes. Harry couldn’t remember when he’d last slept until ten in the morning.
Now Draco smiled at Noah as he measured him up and down, “It’s itchy because the robes are made of the finest wool, gathered from sheep who live in the pure air of the mountains.” At least, that’s what the sales witch at Madam Mooney’s had convinced him of, before ripping him off grandly.
“For Merlin’s sakes, what is it Evergrey?” Harry had a feeling that whatever it was, it had something to do with the wicked piece of parchment in the man’s hand. For a split-second, Harry considered a change of career, maybe a florist somewhere warm.
“Bollocks, I almost forgot, George sent you something,” Ron started rummaging around his pockets, and managed to pull out two plastic packages and what seemed like a box of chocolates, “he says that
8 pm. The street was busy with customers trying to make their last purchases before the shops closed for the week. The spring fashion for robes had come and many windows advertised mid-season sales to get rid of their winter cloaks.
Harry could hear his pulse in his ears when he scanned the room with his eyes. There was no one there. He let out a deep sigh that was half relief and half disappointment. However, the room was not devoid of signs of someone living there. The narrow bed facing the door was made, the small wooden table with one chair beside it had a notebook and some papers lying about. A kettle was on the stove along with a cup and some cutlery. There were a few other papers taped on the walls: a map of London with red X’s marked on it, some illustrations and lists that Harry couldn’t make sense of.
For a while, there was only the splashing of the water from the fountain, where the two men were embracing. Harry felt like he could never get enough, never get close enough to the man he was wrapped around. His heart felt very full, and he wouldn’t have noticed his feet being completely soaked even if it was pointed out to him, that’s how swept up he was in the moment. He wanted to never stop kissing Malfoy, except to maybe tell him he loved him, he didn’t even think it inappropriate anymore, he was barely thinking about anything. The smell of flowers engulfed them as Aphrodite kept endlessly pouring the water into the pool, not that either of them would have noticed. It felt so very lovely to be held, after all this time, in the arms of the right person.
For a minute Harry decided to put aside the fact that he was thinking about Draco Malfoy, and just concentrate on the facts: they had known each other for a long time, they had both been through some horrible things in their lives, they were both lonely, they were both into men, and most importantly, Harry’s heart started hammering every time he thought about the bastard. When he was at work, he was constantly listening for a sharp knock on his door, and when he returned home, he always expected Malfoy to be there, waiting for him just like he did the other night. However, Harry had to return the first variable into the equation, he sighed. Draco sodding Malfoy.
Now it was Malfoy’s turn to raise his eyebrows and eye Harry’s figure up and down, a little bit too long for Harry’s comfort. Yep, the shirt was definitely too tight. “Well, you’re just going to have to do that later, now may I?”
“And why not?” Hermione inquired, consuming the cake at hyper speed and drinking her hot chocolate to top it off. Chocolate on chocolate, bold choice, perhaps Harry ought to try it after Malfoy had cursed him into next week for approaching him. Was Harry seriously considering doing this?
“Uh, the Ministry has no appeal, I mean, er, we’re fine with it… Your Honour,” Scot uttered again and sat down with a relieved thump.
Harry made his way over the doorstep and helped himself in putting away his outer robes in one of the hangers in the hallway wardrobe. He managed to take a quick look in the mirror and smooth out his hair before he heard a high pitched “Uncle Hawwy!” approaching him, accompanied by the sound of little steps tapping against the wooden floor. A redheaded girl ran straight towards him, and Harry lowered himself to greet her as he grabbed little Rose into his arms. “Rosie! What on earth have you been up to?” He smiled at her as he carried her into the open kitchen/dining room area where Hermione and Ron were.
Malfoy looked very pained by the conversation, but after a few seconds apparently decided to just give in. “Fine,” he uttered and rolled his eyes, “after the trials when I lost the Manor, I couldn’t find a reason to stay in this foul place, or worse, risk seeing your wretched face again, so I moved to Italy. Tuscany to be specific.”
“Lovely, your table manners are just how I remember them,” Malfoy said cynically and was twirling his glass on the table with his long fingers. How did Malfoy know about Harry’s table manners, he wondered? A question surely best to leave unasked.
“Morning Patrick,” Harry announced and stepped into the office. It was smaller than Harry’s, there was no fireplace or armchairs, only a desk with chairs in front of it, and two huge bookcases full of publications and parchments. He was nearly annoyed to see how neatly all of the documents were organized.
“I wish you wouldn’t be,” Harry replied quietly, “you’ve been through enough as it is.” He extended his free hand to gently brush Malfoy’s shoulder, not knowing what else to say or do. He wanted to comfort him, but had a feeling a smothering embrace wouldn’t be appreciated at the moment. If there was one thing Malfoy couldn’t stand, it was pity for him. But Harry couldn’t help himself pitying the man a little bit, his awful father dragging their family through everything, Voldemort manipulating Malfoy into doing his dirty work. He hadn’t deserved the treatment he’d got.
he looked down, and then up again, and said, “Fine, but only for the good luck.” And before Harry could give back a sarcastic quip, his heart hammering, Malfoy had already closed the gap between them and stepped into the pool with a splash. Next, he cast Nox, leaving them both to stand there, in the darkness. Harry found it quite hard to breathe, let alone reply to whatever Malfoy had just said, he had already forgotten. Fortunately, the man didn’t make him wait long, before grabbing Harry from the waist and pulling him into a very passionate kiss. Harry responded eagerly, wrapping his arms around the man, and letting himself be practically lifted from the water by Malfoy. His heart felt like a little bird trying to get out of his chest, his head felt cloudy aside for the very clear fact that he was, once again, snogging Malfoy, and once again, he couldn’t imagine doing anything else.
“Get off it, Arys! Parkinson’s not going to blab. We all swore an Unbreakable! Arys! Stop Stinging me!” Harry jolted into consciousness. He fell asleep on a floor.
“Arys! Where is Arys?” Harry talks to Ron and Malfoy’s blurring hairlines. “Er, all right, Malfoy, if’ll suffice. But if I find out that you’ve told anyone before Ron and Hermione say it’s okay, and I’ll know because I’ve just put a Spell on you to know, know. see, watch,” Harry does a little zig-zag Z-shape with his wand, and mutters something unintelligible. “Yup, cast it. so I’ll know, Malfoy, I’ll know.” He turns, “Shall we henceforth doth lettihim go now, Ronald? Queen Mab will get him if he tells a single body I promise.” Harry says solemnly. He has, in fact, just improved upon a spell he was working on a few weeks ago, and hopefully worked it out. It looks right, the way it falls around Malfoy, the pink around his cheeks, the red atop his lightening-blonde hair.
“Shut up, it’s gone!” He giggled, breathless. Here he was giggling, his hands all over Ron’s mouth, and the Prophet were probably going mad.
He’s plastered on his “Minister for Magic” mask, now, and he brings it around the table; a few seconds for each member of “Cupboard”. Hysteria Greengrass raises an eyebrow.
Harry drank his coffee standing, forked in a tumble of scrambled eggs, and the owl flapped its wings.
He shut the curtains and taking a quick moment to weigh the pros and the cons and going with pro, grabbed the old Invisibility out from the chest where it was kept.
“As previously stated, the very word exemplified before me.” The raven-haired man in the portrait waves his wrists illustriously, serene, and strides out of the frame.
“Superb.” Arys said, in Harry’s chair. Harry (Harys) handed Arys (Arry) his glasses. Arry put them on, pouting, and picking at her foreign skin. She moaned.
Harys made his way out of Grimmauld in all of Arys’ clothing she had been wearing earlier, and had to spell his hair orange, as was her new fashion for all intents and purposes. The Polyjuice didn’t have that on record, this brew. He had the Invisibility in his purse, and Arys’ wand up his sleeve. It was so unfortunate those moments he had to part with his Holly. So reminiscent of a dreary time he’d much rather forget.
The owl was an owl in species only: every other single characteristic she possessed was more vulture, to Harry. She was black with gigantic, swooping wings, -- hovering the way Snape’s black cloaks used to -- coral talons and cherry red eyes. Harry swore Arys’ had Charmed them that way, but he couldn’t prove it and she’d never admit to it. And then, she went and named the thing, “Lucy”.
Harry was almost too afraid of Arys’ retaliation to leave the house. But she was a Slytherin, and she was predictable in that way, so he knew she would wait good and hard for the opportune moment. He wasn’t worried, they had been through these sorts of games before. They were rather fun, after all.
“So, you’re not going to tell me anything? About a murder, that I alerted you to, that just happened outside my bloody --”
He stuffed another cracker and cheese into his mouth, chasing it down with the rest of his white wine.
Just on time (five minutes past two), Harry heard a cacaphony of sounds coming from his wards: Mrs. Black’s wail (Her portrait had come in handy after all), Veela screeching (Arys’ own personal alert), and crows crowing. He felt the wards being poked at, as if someone was poking their wand into his bellybutton. He wiped the sensation off, as he jogged to the door. It became One-Way Transparent when anyone was within the wards’ range -- a woman stood with her back to the door on the top step of Grimmauld’s stoop.
He could tell Ron, surely. He didn’t know where Ron was at the moment, but someone needed to get here quick, before the Muggles took jurisdiction.
He ended up safely behind a shrub, where he was well enough hidden if he made any coughs or mistaking sweeps of the hand, and where he could observe most of the proceedings. Even under the Invisibility, Harry could smell the magic dissapating from the crime scene, rising from the body of the unknown man.
“It’s Harry, Arys, and yes. I understand. It just, it happened so quickly. I didn’t know what to do.”
Harry couldn’t tell them about snooping in the Invisibility. For one, he made sure they didn’t know he still had the thing, and two, it wasn’t exactly protocol. It would only cast suspicion.
“Allow me.” Arys grimaced and cast a modified Silencing spell, only applying to Harry’s hunger pains.
“Arys, are there any more “Close Friend’s Gala pleasantries” I’ve got to perform?” Harry balled his fists into his closed eyes and pressed.
“Right. Well. Thank you, President Harpone, for all of your kind words. I hope everything, I mean, I hope you’re finding your stay really enjoyable. And that you get over your fear of kippers. They’re really worth it.” Harry smiled, his last Harry Potter Charm Smile he had in him. “I’ll talk to Ms Wronsky about an engagement,” the girls tittered, “I mean, an outing, next week. She’ll contact you soon. It was really lovely.” He nodded, bowed, did some more courtesies, and finally was able to leave.
If Rita Skeeter had asked little Harry Potter, Champion of Hogwarts, whether or not he imagined he’d be returning to the place at the age of twenty-three, he might have said “sure”.
“Yeah, erm, hey. Someone’s been murdered outside Grimmauld. I heard sirens, I woke up. Think you might want to stop by and check it out before the Muggles haul everything away.”
. Black wool trousers hid the ankles of his pointy boots, and he was wearing a forest green turtleneck under a dark grey woollen coat, collar up, naturally. The sight was thrilling in a way Harry didn’t care to get into, and he tried not to stare. Just as Malfoy had attempted earlier, he realized. Was Malfoy…? No, it was Harry who was going mad.
Now Malfoy gave a deep sigh. “I don’t mean the war, I mean, regular things, figuring out who you are when you’re a teenager, stuff like that,” he said it as though he was thinking of something specific, and Harry was debating to himself whether he wanted to know what it was or not. What had Malfoy been battling with that wasn’t related to Voldemort or his parents? Figuring himself out… maybe he was talking about realizing that he was gay, but in that case, what went into that battle?
“So, you hated me then?” Harry asked, part teasing, part out of sheer curiosity. It had been very clear to Harry at the time that Malfoy had hated his guts, but talking with Narcissa had made Harry doubt himself, and now he wanted to find out, once and for all, what had been going on at Draco’s end of the rivalry.
had been through either, “but now that you’ve come back into the picture… I’m afraid he’s reverting back to his old ways.”
The vulnerable look on Malfoy’s face he was trying very hard to conceal behind his scowl made Harry stay. He was just being nervous, hell, Harry was nervous beyond any rational thought.
Now Harry was wearing simple maroon robes under a black overcloak, they were softer in fabric and more comfortable than his work robes, and he was able to breathe in the jacket, unlike in the official Head Auror robes, no embroidery either.
Harry decided to ignore the latter comment, but to push on with the detective work, “Did you have a look yet?” He remembered seeing lists of names in the book, thinking that they might be important. He thanked his decision to pick up the journal and take it with him, otherwise he’d have another wound to heal, a more serious one perhaps.
, Harry thought, and to his horror noticed that he actually didn’t mind sitting here with Malfoy, his former arch nemesis.
“Isaac, do you think it would be possible to get a special permission from the Minister for the Department of Mysteries to brew a small batch of Veritaserum for our difficult detainee?”
“I don’t think we’re there yet, Potter,” came Malfoy’s cold answer. There it was again, as soon as Harry was about to learn a new detail about the man, he got pushed on his arse again. Little by little he was starting to lose faith in anything ever moving forward with him.
“Someone’s been stealing potions from our storage at the hospital,” Malfoy explained and leaned back in his chair, “they sent me to file a report since I’m working on that floor, and they can’t be arsed to run errands.”
The man kissed Harry right on the mouth, not saying anything. Harry responded eagerly, perhaps too eagerly. After a few moments, Malfoy gently flipped Harry over, spreading his legs on the bed, Harry let out a sharp breath in anticipation, which seemed to egg Draco on. The man’s hands were resting on Harry’s cheeks, pulling them apart slightly. In what felt like ages and no time at all, Harry felt something soft and wet on his taint, nearing his arsehole. He gasped as Draco’s tongue pushed inside, in what felt like the most intimate thing ever done to him. His tongue teased the rim of his hole, pushing in and out. Harry couldn’t hold back a moan; the whole situation was so preposterous.
Harry shrugged, at least it hadn’t been easy for him. “Especially if a corrupt government is trying to suppress the fact that a wizard constantly trying to off you even exists,” he couldn't help pointing it out. He was still filled with the old feeling of frustration and rage when he thought about Umbridge and Fudge scheming amongst themselves to cover up for Voldemort, from sheer fear, the cowards. Sure, Harry had his crush on Cho not work out, but at the time, there had been more pressing matters for him to worry about.
“What is it?” Harry asked. Suddenly, something in his stomach sank, and not like it had before, but in a much worse way. The way when you just know something bad has happened. Malfoy didn't say anything; his lips were white from how tightly they were pinched shut. The man drew his legs into his lap and wrapped his arms around them, lowering his jaw on his knees. Harry picked up the letter, it was short. It was Narcissa’s handwriting, no doubt about that, but it was faltering, and there were stains in the ink here and there, as though she had been crying. The letter said,
“Cheers,” Harry grabbed the piece of parchment, “what about the witch he was talking to? His distributor? Did he give a name?” Harry was eyeing the statement as they stepped into one of the packed elevators.
Harry’s jaw almost hit the ground from the sheer uncharacteristic nature of the response, but he managed to keep his composure and say quietly, but sternly, “You think?”
convince Draco Malfoy not to burn the place down in a fit of Fiendfyre. Harry had quite honestly had enough of the Malfoy family, especially of Draco tormenting him at every turn. Even a full decade later that git still found a way to lurk his way into Harry’s life and make it worse.
There was a long silence, where the fire behind Kingsley’s eyes eased off, as he stared at Harry, mulling over what had just been said. He extended himself, “What do you want?” the man asked in a low voice.
“Right, good,” Harry nodded again, unsure what to do next. They didn’t know where Dargan was, so they had pretty little to go on. Harry found it insufferable to merely wait for some witch or wizard to identify their suspect somewhere, they would never catch Dargan if they only knew places he had been, not where he
Harry counted that it was three times in two days now that Malfoy had managed to make him feel like a complete arse with his parting comment.
” Ron stressed the last word and was gesturing towards Harry’s robes. Ron always tried to egg Harry on to tell him what was going on in the ‘exciting part of the Ministry’. Harry guessed that even though Ron loved working at WWW alongside George, he missed the action of being an Auror. The thing was, most of the cases he was working on were classified and he couldn’t share as many details with Ron as he would have perhaps liked.
“Cursed if I am,” Ron huffed and drained his glass angrily only for it to fill itself again, “hell can freeze over a thousand times before I’m left alone with that git.” As soon as he’d said it, though, he gave Harry a guilty sideways glance, neck going red, “sorry, it’s just… hard to think of him as anything but
Harry’s mouth opened, but he couldn't think of anything to say, his heart had started racing. “Malfoy–“ he started feebly.
“No,” Draco hummed, “the few minutes are for this,” he moved to kiss Harry’s lips. They were soft, and willing, and the kiss was so familiar and warm that Draco just wanted to sink into it forever. It was nothing like when they first got together, all heat and passion – it was better, it was home. Draco clutched Harry in his arms softly but firmly, opening his mouth more and letting their tongues glide against each other in the kiss that was becoming way too hot way too fast.
Today he was returning to work. A little wistful that his little break was over, Harry dragged himself through the Ministry Atrium towards Kingsley’s office, reminding himself that it was only two days before the weekend again, and pints with Ron. Before Harry had been dreading weekends alone, but recently he had achieved an amicable state of sorts of being by himself, thanks to the abundance of alone-time he had been given.
better at being hated than me, cheers,” Malfoy emptied the last of his pint and almost slammed it on the table.
“Brilliant, we’ll have answers in no time,” Harry nodded, he really appreciated when criminals did their work for them, so considerate. Now he extended his arm to reach for the journal, “Can I see?”
It worked. “Why on earth did you stop?” Malfoy asked, turning to Harry, who lowered his hands, and wiped the rest of the stuff on his legs, “Wasn’t it like your only hobby?” Harry wanted to defend himself, but to his dissatisfaction, found that the man was right. What did he even do at school? Homework and flying, those were the two things that took up almost all of his time, there were so many assignments to complete and so many practices to make it to.
After some thirty minutes of playing, Harry and Draco motioned to the Italians that they had to leave. They said farewell and the locals waved after them gleefully, probably secretly happy to be rid of Harry’s horrendous performance on their team. The pair apparated back to Malfoy’s place from a quiet side alley.
Harry pulled out his wand, eyeing the entrance of the building suspiciously, “Right, you go through the back, I’ll take the front.”
him. Clearly, the twat had never felt a positive emotion towards Harry, it was pretty clear from his manner.
“I know,” Harry said with his mouth full, partly because he didn’t want to stop eating, and partly because there was nothing more to say, really.
to the night shift at the security stand, who immediately perked up from seeing Harry come his way. It was approaching 6 am, and there were only a handful of witches and wizards either leaving late or arriving early. Harry realized that he might as well have travelled to his own fireplace, but then remembered that it was probably still closed at this time, and was glad he was stuck to his manners.
“If you must,” Malfoy scowled and took a careful sip of his own tea, looking at least as suspicious as a person testing out for poison. His expression looked as if Harry had catered him a cup full of vodka, but for some reason withheld from commenting on it. It was odd to say the least.
“All alone?” she asked, her voice filled with worry, her brows furrowing, and her lower lip pushing out to a pout. Harry’s heart leapt as he gave a glance in Malfoy’s direction. The man was observing the situation with an unreadable expression. Actually, he seemed to be a bit awkward, shifting the weight back and forth on his feet, measuring little Rosie up and down, then moving his eyes on Harry, holding her in his lap.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” Harry protested, somehow Malfoy always knew how to turn things around to feel sorry for himself. Harry hated that to be honest.
Now he closed the heavy oak door to his office and faced the parchment calamity that he had left in his wake the day before, when he had had to quickly take off to supervise the arrest of a suspect in a case he was working on. Someone was selling dark magic laced memory potions that were not only extremely strong but increasingly unpredictable, which made them dangerous for use. Harry and some other Aurors were trying to track down sellers in order to get to the source. The man they arrested the previous day was the first solid lead they had had in weeks, and frankly the arrest could have been swifter, now Evergreen, Blackburn, and Rivers were tied up the whole afternoon interviewing and Obliviating muggles.
Narcissa had the audacity to shrug at Harry’s question. “I might be partial in this situation, I only want what’s best for my son,” she said and put down her teacup. How frustrating it was that she didn’t provide answers to Harry when he clearly needed them. On the other hand, Harry realized that it was completely preposterous for him to march in her house, demanding some kind of… what? Validation, maybe, to his feelings.
The yellow parchments were bound in red leather covers, and the golden letters were gleaming in the dim light of the tea house. Harry was sitting in a dark green armchair that almost swallowed him whole, whereas Malfoy had plopped himself down on rose-coloured bergère.
Rivers nodded, “I’ll get the release form ready, it should take up to an hour before she’s ready to be cleared.”
“Permanent if you ask me,” the man snorted and raised his eyebrows. Harry would have laughed if the quip came from anyone else, he couldn't give Malfoy the satisfaction. Also, he felt so tense that any natural reaction at this point would have been impossible.
Harry nuzzled Draco’s neck and kissed it, a small “Oh,” escaping the man’s lips. Harry lowered his hand to softly cup Draco’s face as he kept kissing along his neck and jaw. When he moved to his lips, both of them hovered there for a second, eyes closed, breathing each other in, before Harry planted the first kiss, light as a feather, on Draco’s lips. And then another, and another. Finally, their lips were gliding together, wet and soft and very very wonderful. As he was gently rubbing circles in Draco’s bare side under his robes, Harry thought that there was nowhere he’d rather be at this moment, and that he’d perhaps like to kiss Malfoy for the rest of his life.
Now he was standing in front of the door to the house, and had to take a deep breath as he placed a firm knock on it. What if Malfoy opened it? Suddenly Harry felt a wave of panic, he hadn’t really prepared what to say, and Malfoy was always so astute and nonchalant, pretty much the opposite of Harry. Also, he had never sought Malfoy out on his own, the bastard had always come to him, complaining about one thing or another.
“Third floor, the Potions Department,” Malfoy articulated, his gaze now lazily scanning Harry, making his palms sweaty.
“Well thanks, it’s been pretty great, if we’re lucky we might make it to the Quidditch World Cup in a couple of years,” she uttered very humbly, but Harry could see the excitement in her eyes. Playing in the World Cup had been one of Ginny’s dreams for at least a decade, if not longer.
On Monday Harry was almost glad to go to work, he craved anything that would wake him up from this weird nightmare he had been living in. The Ministry Atrium was packed when Harry strode through it in his usual fashion, greeting the wizard at the security stand and anyone else he knew. Being around people made him feel less detached from reality, it felt relieving to get out of his head more.
“I, er, seem to have hurt my ankle, I can’t really walk with it,” Harry explained, feeling his face heating up. How he wished he had some kind of a magical complaint, maybe if he had accidentally dyed his hair green, or Vanished his bollocks, or
“Thanks Patrick,” Harry smiled awkwardly, and then luckily remembered something that would surely divert the conversation away from him, “what about the journal?”
Harry pressed on, asking a painfully obvious question, just to make his point come across as clearly as possible. “And would it be possible to investigate the Dark Mark if all Death Eaters are gone?” Some expressions around the room started looking sour, while others looked almost intrigued as to where this was going. Harry thought he could have made a good lawyer, if he didn't hate studying so much. Well, truthfully, it was Hermione who had arranged this whole back and forth to unravel – Harry only got to act the part.
“Good, cheers. So, listen… Blackburn and Rivers did some digging about the ring, and it turns out that the M on it denotes an old criminal organization called the
Patrick shook his head and leaned back in the chair with a long sigh. “That was quite the stunt you pulled back there, give me a bloody heart attack you did.” He brought his measuring glance back to Harry, like it would be possible that he would spontaneously catch on fire as a side effect of some treatment.
. The inevitableness of the situation made it impossible for him to focus on anything, on acting normal. He noticed that he was mimicking Malfoy’s position, standing there with his arms on his sides, and he felt surrendered. Surrendered to the circumstance.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, but then just closed it again. He eyed Harry’s face for a few seconds, and when Harry thought that he would actually bend down and kiss him, he just snorted and turned around to climb up the steps. Another moment gone, why did their opportunities always slip away, unseized? Harry should have made the first move. He would. He would, before the night was over. “I must say that you have poor taste in romantic companions,” Malfoy announced, not looking back at Harry. Was he referring to Ginny or himself? Or both? There was no one else, except maybe Cho, but Harry had a feeling she wasn’t the point of the topic here.
Dargan was being very honeyed in his talk, and that made Harry nervous; it was easier to deal with criminals who were transparent in their intentions.
“You’re welcome, by the way,” Harry kept his steady stare at Lucius, knowing he was reaching for something unattainable.
“I didn’t say anything,” Malfoy replied vaguely, and then was quiet for a full two minutes, as they were making their way along the same street which ended in the promenade, they could already see it in the distance, smell the sea, “so what about Minister for Magic? I think you’d seriously have a shot at that.”
Be that as it may, he wouldn’t be happy for long. Not when he heard what Harry had to say. He took a quick breath and decided to just go for it. Fuck it, Hermione and Ginny were right, what’s the worst that could happen? “What’s going on here?” he asked, carefully monitoring Malfoy’s face for sudden changes. They didn’t happen.
Hamish was rubbing his chin thoughtfully, but didn't seem to come up with a counterargument, and finally nodded, leaning back in his chair. He wasn’t the only one to have questions, and him presenting one opened the doors for a stream of new ones: “Where would he be kept for research?”
“It would be my pleasure,” Evergrey replied, matching Harry’s tone, while the pair exited the interrogation room.
Now Harry’s eyes shot to Malfoy so quickly he almost pulled a muscle from his neck. The git seemed to be serious, his silver eyes measuring Harry up and down, his face red in splotches. “I, erm, I don’t get off until ten,” Harry answered, before realizing it didn’t really answer the question at all. He was afraid of where this might be going, although the thought also exhilarated him.
On Monday morning Harry arrived to work to find the permission slip on his desk denied. Honestly, he wasn’t sure what he was expecting, Veritaserum was illegal after all. Judging by the lack of other case-related memos on his desk he figured that there hadn’t been a sighting of Dargan yet, he sighed and put down the piece of parchment.
“To do anything with you,” Malfoy admitted, suddenly not looking at Harry anymore, “but yes, to sleep with you,” he gave Harry a shy smile and slouched on the bed to lie on his back. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of him, except to realize that he couldn't see anything, and to do a modest wandless Accio on his glasses. He put them on his nose. Then he carefully snuggled closer to Malfoy, planting a kiss on the side of his chest.
Now, though the door, another guard rushed in a handcuffed man, and sat him down on the table roughly. The guard gave Lucius’ shoulder a squeeze of warning, and left the room, banging the door closed behind him, leaving the two in the bleak room. Malfoy looked… bad, to say the least. His greasy hair was drooping on his head, half covering his face, and his bushy beard hid the other half. Harry would not have recognized him in a million years, if it weren’t for his eyes. Bright grey, same as Draco’s. Harry wished he hadn't noticed it.
Narcissa was quiet for a long time. She handed Harry the teacup and sat back down in the armchair, absentmindedly stirring the tea with a dainty silver spoon. “So, you read the letter, then,” she said, and took a careful sip, before turning her gaze back to Harry. Her expression was expectant. Harry bit the inside of his cheek and nodded, he went around the coffee table and sat back down on the edge of the sofa.
Narcissa had a timid look on her face when she saw Harry on her front step, “Harry Potter, h-how may I help you?” she hesitated. Harry was sorry to see that she was acting almost akin to when she was forced to serve Voldemort. He realized that Narcissa probably thought that he had come to arrest her again or some other terrible thing.
“Potter, might I join you?” A biting voice came from beside him, and Harry had to drop his act, lowering the notebook on the table and closing it. Malfoy’s face was quite sour, he was obviously not happy about the situation either.
Narcissa looked a little embarrassed, and it reminded Harry a lot of Hagrid, notorious for accidentally spilling other people’s secrets. He would have to write to him again one of these days. Now Narcissa sighed anxiously, “Oh dear, I probably shouldn’t have said that,” she stared at the empty fireplace and twisted her hands in her lap, “it’s just, you know Draco was always a little obsessed with you back when he was in school. Every holiday it was Potter this and Potter that, sometimes you beat him at Quidditch, other times he was bothered that you were Dumbledore’s favourite, eternally he thought you were up to something. Even Lucius thought it was a bit much,” now she turned to look at Harry, “me… I saw right through him, it wasn’t just resentment, it was envy as well, and maybe a little something else, but I never dared to impose.”
This awarded a very deep eye roll from Malfoy, who also slouched back in his chair to give Harry an irked stare. “Oh, for Merlin’s sakes, so are we now to just deal in awkward compliments for the end of time? Also, saying that you look better now than before is hardly a compliment, seeing how you started out.”
When it was time to leave, Draco closed all doors and windows as a matter of routine, his limbs moving as if they were on autopilot. He grabbed his bag, and Harry could hear something fall over in there, though it didn’t seem to be very heavy. They made their way downstairs into the shop, and Malfoy locked the door to his apartment with a muggle padlock and a protective charm. He then left a short note for Moretti, stating that something had come up, and that they’d have to leave for London, not knowing when they’d be back. Truthfully, Harry didn’t think if he’d ever be back, and even amidst the worry running through their veins like icy water, he couldn’t help giving the place a last, longing glance.
The next day, Monday, Malfoy determinedly marched downstairs to the shop to announce to Moretti that he was receiving a raise to his hourly rate, and that for the next week, he could decide to keep the shop open with his new salary, or close off for the time, it was all the same to him, he was taking the week off. Harry blushed when he heard Malfoy say it, and felt an awkward urge to grab his hand, but didn't think it appropriate in Moretti’s presence. The man was overwhelmed at the sudden bout of generosity, and thanked Malfoy profusely, Harry, too. Harry felt a bit awkward in the situation, but smiled at him politely.
. “My only clothes were whatever my cousin Dudley would care to discard on to me,” Harry continued, and started to get a taste of the storytelling, he sat up in his chair more, “they moved me to Dudley’s other room to stay when I turned eleven.”
“That’s good news,” Hermione nodded, and something about her way of handling the matter calmed Harry’s churning innards down, she wasn’t trying to cradle them, she was trying to solve a problem. “That’s very good, it means we can still do something. Now,” she flipped through the notepad and laid it back down on the table, “I talked to my boss, Mrs Ackerman, and she thinks that if we can make a solid case for the preservation of a Death Eater, one that would somehow benefit the Ministry, we could have a chance at winning the case. All we need to do now is to get the board to agree to have a hearing in front of a judge.” Harry wanted to cringe at the word
. How’s this for romance: fourth year, when I first heard about the Yule ball, my first thought was to ask you. Naturally, it was an impossible idea to entertain, and I ended up going with Pansy, who sat next to me the whole night while I brooded over you in your ridiculous dance robes, wanting to be up there with you,” Malfoy’s expression was a mix of disdain and something more vulnerable, “fifth year, I joined Umbridge’s ranks because I wanted to get your attention, and because I was so insanely jealous of that cow Cho Chang. Sixth year–“
after every kiss he placed on Harry’s body, and Harry had no choice, and no will to have a choice, but to respond
“I know,” Harry replied, finding the butterflies in his stomach almost unbearable, “I’m proud of you, really, for everything, and for taking the next step, as well. It can’t be easy.”
Harry sat up as well. “Draco, hey, hey,” he reached to grab the man’s arm gently, which caused him to turn his head to look at Harry, disoriented enough to not recognize him, “it’s okay, it’s just a nightmare, you’re home,” Harry was repeating as gently as he could. He let go of the man’s arm, sad to comprehend his state very well. He couldn’t remember how many times he’d woken up to himself screaming, sweating through the sheets. Now Malfoy seemed to come to, blinking rapidly, and he reached to grab Harry’s hand tightly. Harry squeezed back, and shuffled closer. Draco’s head fell onto his shoulder, his blond hair falling to cover his face.
“I suppose,” Draco murmured, not sounding very convinced, “at any rate, I think a thank you is in order for what you did today.”
“Brilliant,” Harry replied immediately, eager to leave Azkaban and never come back, eager to tell Draco the good news, “someone from the Ministry will come fetch you when it’s time.” With that, Harry knocked on the inside of the door, and seconds later one of the guards opened it to let him out, the other ready to escort him the hell out of this place.
They Apparated onto a chilly side alley behind two buildings, both of which had enormous trash bins outside in the back – probably restaurants. Malfoy gestured for Harry to follow him onto a wider street, and took a right towards the city centre. The setting sun was warm on Harry’s skin, and the air was still hot around them, as they walked to a small square, lined with old stone buildings that looked like they were about to crumble at any moment. Malfoy pointed to the nearest one, a white building, two stories high, menacingly crooked to the left. “That is the first house in Italy that was built entirely with magic,” he announced. To tell the truth, it didn’t look like much – the red bricks of the roof were barely holding on, and the windowsills had holes between the wall and the window from having to bend with the house over the years. “I know it looks utterly unfortunate, but apparently it has been like this for nearly two millennia,” Draco shrugged, “I think that clown Gilderoy Lockhart claimed he spent a night there once, though I highly doubt it.”
“Well, er, I now realize I haven’t said that out loud yet, haven’t I,” Harry started, feeling the red spreading from his face to his neck and his ears, “but yes, I love you, it might be stupid and unfortunate but I can’t help it, and I don’t want to fight it either, because I haven’t felt that way in a long time, I know it sounds horribly cliché coming out of my mouth, but–“
Harry propped himself up on his left elbow and turned to Draco, “What you said before, I wasn’t going to stop you because…” he paused, in search for words, “because I wanted it too.” Harry was looking at Malfoy, and felt a nearly irresistible urge to caress his hair, he wondered if it was as soft as it looked like, he hadn't really noticed before.
But he wasn’t at the matron’s office at the Ministry. That bed was a lot harder for the back. So, where was he? Harry tried to open his eyes, but it was too bright, so he squeezed them shut tightly. Instead, he tried wriggling his finger. It moved against the soft fabric of the blanket he was tucked under. He tried another finger, then his whole hand. It was effortless. The other arm seemed to be fine too. Then his toes, he could feel all of them, still attached to his working feet, and to his legs that obeyed him by lifting up from the bed and back down. Great. It was time to attempt opening his eyes again, and carefully, Harry squinted at the place he was in.
“Brilliant,” he said dryly, “I will owl Gringotts this evening with an order to transfer the money.” The man nodded awkwardly and with a swish of a well-worn cloak, he was off.
Harry was pulled out of his thoughts by the question. “No, I haven’t,” he replied, “never been outside the UK, actually.” It felt like a confession for some reason. He’d never been abroad. When he was little, he should’ve been so lucky as to accompany Petunia to the grocery store. The Dursley’s hardly travelled, and even so, they would have never, ever brought Harry with them.
When Harry stepped into the shower on the other side of the wall from Malfoy’s bedroom in the second floor, he realized that he’d, despite of the sun cream, gotten a bit of a sunburn on his shoulders and waist. It stung in the warm water and was red under his touch. Harry dried himself, dabbing carefully over the burned part with the towel, and returned to the bedroom. The outside doors were open, and Malfoy was standing on the small balcony, looking over the sea in thought. His golden hair was gently swinging in the salty breeze, and his blue cotton shirt was moving back and forth around his body. He looked so peaceful, Harry hated to interrupt it.
resting his jaw in his dark hair. Harry was so taken aback he didn’t say anything. That was probably for the best. The moment itself was enough to overwhelm him, but for some reason, the sheer comfort of being held suddenly made him feel the weight of every single night he had spent up tossing and turning.
Inside the large sitting room, it was cosy though, with bright flames crackling away in the fireplace, candles everywhere, and the large Christmas tree decorated so voluminously that one could barely see the tree behind the decorations. Draco had to admit he might have overdone it, if not otherwise, then by Harry’s doubtful expression when he came home. Noah liked it though, and he and Draco had agreed that Harry just had poor taste when it came to matter of holiday decorations.
Draco was already half awake when Harry brought him the letter to bed, and he let out a pained groan, having to wake up so early.
Before Harry could think another thought, the door opened. In front of him stood Narcissa Malfoy, in the flesh. Harry was relieved and disappointed at the same time, though he wasn’t sure about the origins of the latter feeling. The woman seemed more composed than the last time Harry saw her, her hair was back to the style she had modelled ten years ago, the dark circles under her eyes had faded, she looked well-rested and less haggard.
Draco nodded and wrapped his long fingers around the warm mug, giving apprehensive looks towards Harry, scanning his face for signs that he would start interviewing Draco about the events of the last two hours. But Harry wasn’t going to. “Aren’t you going to ask how it went?” Draco finally inquired, and took a careful sip of his milky tea, which he still seemed to detest.
Just when Harry was about to say that he’d love some tart, he was interrupted by loud steps coming down the stairs, accompanied by the usual “Uncle Hawwyyy!” as Rose jumped into his arms to give him a great big hug. “Where have you beeeeen?” she asked, her head still in Harry’s neck. She was wearing a yellow sundress and matching flower sandals; her red hair was bushier by the day.
“Thank you, Hogwarts, for your time and your enthusiasm.” Perfidy beams once more. “I’ll be carrying the fond memory of your smiling faces with me blah blah dad joke boring Ministry tripe.”
A few short minutes, hours, later Harry awoke to the familiar Veela’s call. Walburga was infamously absent. Harry frowned for a moment, and then recollected all of the events of the night/day preceeding.
“Your hair isn’t orange and your face is back on. Not an improvement. I preferred  the orange, myself.” Harry retorted.
He smacks his hands slowly together, half-arsedly feigning enthusiasm, as Minister Perfidy beams and performs a little number of bows and curtseys. The students exchange faces a bit confused, somewhat bemused, but primarily unused. Harry had struggled to keep his own eyes open, if he’s being completely honest. But he’s rarely that, these days.
“This place reeks of magic.” Malfoy sniffed delicately, but began to look curious. “And the state the atmos’ in? Where are we?”
He opened the door and pranced about the floor, pretending he was Romeo at the costume party. He went to play duel Arys on the stairs.
“Better. Stop messing your hair. Now go say hi.” Arys pointed, “There, Gringotts Board Member Albert Tepougé and his partner, Cary Renninger. No, left. Yes. Squeeze them, please them.”
“Yes, all right, Weasley. Calm yourself. You two’ve been married since the second year in my mind; I do not care. However, the entire Wizarding World is going to know, and care, in about five seconds if you don’t stop thundering on about it. Unhand me Potter, and we’ll forget this unfortunate misunderstanding ever happened.” Malfoy says.
He peers under the red and gold fabric and watches Perfidy as he’s escorted down the Great Hall by no fewer than six Aurors, three PR reps, an Appearance Specialist and a Handler, one temporarily acquired Headmistress, and one flapping Indian Runner Duck. And no one brings up the duck in public, not after Calgary.
“I thought that, too!” Harry was growing steadily drunk. Happily drunk. “It’s okay that we poke fun at him, isn’t it? Is my hair blonde?!”
“Perfect. Speaking of which, Ronald’s in the ballroom with Goyle. He was chatting up Perfidy’s wife the last I saw -- Ronald, of course, not Goyle.” She assured as Harry snorted.  “Ginny’s here already, she brought Captain Crunch.” Harry choked on a cracker.
“Yeah, sorry about that. If I’d known, I wouldn’t have allowed it. The thing is a vulture, I swear.”
Harry lied. He should have seen something after his ward went off, he knew it. Fuck, he was fucked, he was fried, just like Arys had said.
They both look at him incredulously. “I swear!” He holds his forearms and hands up in surrender. Harry had dropped the spell almost immediately after he'd set it.
“Our Spell-Masters will be here tomorrow, or shall I say today, to inspect that ingenius ward of yours, Mr Potter. Perhaps it can tell us some things about this grievous event yet unknown.” Rosier spiked. “Expect them in the late morning. We will be seeing you.”
He glances back at Malfoy: he’s fine, a little shell-shocked, but fine, and so Harry grabs them both by their arms and pulls them in together.
Arys would Apparate through the Dark Room once Malfoy and the Vow were finished, Malfoy would Apparate through the Dark Room once Malfoy and the Vow were finished, and Harry would try and sleep, please.
“Clearly the ward wasn’t meant to harm anyone. We will, however, have to have some of our Spell-Masters come tomorrow to look it over, to be sure. I’m sure they’ll also be quite curious as to how it works.” Whittery smiled, again, kindly.
He hangs from a battered Nimbus 2000 by his knees. His face, or Arys’ in the flames, is most certainly upside down.
Next she would try to manouver his fringe into a side-part. “Can’t you just,” and give up after a three minutes. “Nevermind. Late!”
"Well, ‘gentlemen’. I’ll be off, this was a riot. Let's not do it again, and not soon.” Malfoy turns and fades into the colours of ballgowns and wine and sparkles and
“Yeah, wand me?” he gestured. They each exchanged respective wands and Arys went back to reading as if nothing at all terrible had happened this evening. She didn’t even seem interested in where Harry had been or how he’d gotten back in without the spells noticing.
Harry -- being the “sporting old friend” of the Minister’s that he is -- is superbly in “Cupboard” all afternoon. His Hogwarts “bruncheon” still sits comfortably in his stomach, and he may or may not be about to nod off when Perfidy lets drop a clunky fist to the table.
“Great, thanks.” Harry removed his fists. His headache was worsening. Too much champagne. Poor fawn, Arys said with her big mean eyes.
“Wanker. I’ve been here. I’ve only just made it here, that’s all.” He aimed a cute little Quack-Attack at Ron, for good measure and fun and all that.
Harry and Malfoy both drew their wands simultaneously, eyeing each other up. They stepped in closer to one another, circling, vultures.
“Really? At this hour? Do you know, Ms Wronsky, exactly what time it is? There is no emergency that you could possibly require me for at this hour and even if there were such an emergency I--” Malfoy scorned.
“How about simply, ‘don’t interrupt me again, you prat’, being the best way.” Malfoy had sweat on his forehead. Just a dot, but Harry noticed it all the same, and smiled.
He got into his cupboards as he read, getting tea ready but also grabbing out two jugs from his cupboard.
Harry stomped over to the laughing idiot, threw the Invisibility Cloak over the both of them to be doubly safe, and grabbed onto the twat’s elbow, yanking him, Apparating through his wards and into Harry’s Dark Room.
Harry almost snorted at that. He’d been in far worse situations than this and had never required a “Ministry Guard” to sleep soundly. To sleep at all, even.
“So, erm, are there any more questions or any, stuff?” Harry asked awkwardly, fumbling with his mug. Faking his hesitance. Arys really did teach him well.
“Late!” She hooked their arms. “With me.” And tugged him to their destination, hoping they wouldn’t be late.
And so livid that he spent the entire tea (after eating, of course), imagining which Dark hex he would try on Arys as soon as the bloody tea was finished. He settled on Bloody Mary. It was infants league Dark, really, but it would do. He didn’t want to actually harm her after all, he was much too fond of her.
President Harpone was perfectly polite. He thanked Harry for his services to the Wizarding, and Muggle, worlds. (One of the few to add in the Muggle, Harry noted).
Malfoy leans in closer to Harry and lowers his voice, “I’m jealous. I’m hurt. I can’t be held responsible for my actions.”
“Fine, Arys.” He rolled his eyes and sighed, as one would with an overbearing mother, and looked back to Rosier and Whittery.
“Of course, Mr Potter. It is, in your circumstances, probably very necessary. Please, do believe me when I tell you we aren’t casting any aspersions on you, or anyone associated with you. We just need to follow procedure, be as thorough as possible. You know that. Of course you do, with Weasley as your mate.” Whittery assured again. He had a voice that was just the right volume, and just the right pitch, to put everyone around him at ease. Harry wondered if it was a charm of some sort. A ‘legal’ charm. He snickered behind his tea mug.
IT'S ABOUT CHOOSING MINIMALISM DESPITE ACCESS TO EXCESS ETC AND HARRY FINALLY MAKES THAT CHOUES AND BECOMES HIMSELF ALSO ARYS IS RIDE OR DIE SO IS DRACO (EVENTUALLY!)"
“Mr Potter, I’m Auror Whittery. Auror Rosier and I have some questions for you, if you wouldn’t mind.” He smiled politely.
“Great, Mr Potter. I’m happy to hear it. We’ll see who we can spare and send them over as soon as we get everything in order.” Whittery reassured, Arys and Harry.
Harry is supposed to follow now and makes to get up from his seat, just so. His own publicist, he’s certain, is swanning somewhere about the Hall.
“Are you not perfectly civil with your once foes? If you can do it, I’m positively sure she can. Anyway, you’ll get to witness it tonight. Or not. I’ll keep him away if you need. Now, on,” Arys said.
“Right. Good. Thanks. Here, you’ll need it, yeah?” Harry handed over his wand hesitantly, about to snatch it back at any second.
“Harry, do you not recognise flirting when you see it? I was getting off quite well before you stomped over. I am not your house-elf, I won’t comply with any more of these sullen orders...” and she went on for a bit longer.
“No, you shite-haired prat! But on the subject of blonde-headed prats, and brown-headed prats, and prats: Wood’s here up with Anthony Goldstein. Erm, to let you know. Like, so, before you find them in a dimly lit hall.”
“I know. Well, I didn’t know until after I had already put it in place. Like months after. And,--” Harry was beginning to ramble and was hoping on an Arys interruption.
“Harold! James! There is a bloody body a metre from your stoop and Aurors Obliviating Muggle police to Muggle oblivion. Explain, and quickly.”
And that's a wrap, folks! I'll end this four chapter and seven year old fic with notes I wrote in the original document like 2 years after I'd written anything new.
He took a second, a simple foggy second, to grab his glasses and propel to the window. He cast a Disillusionment and opened the curtains.
“I see, I see. Er, quite the party, eh, Weasley?” The Minister said, a bit taken aback, while Ron twisted his face into a pucker and nodded. “I’m sure you two’ll want to be catching up now. I’ll make my leave.” Perfidy leaned in. “Must locate the wife anyway.” He winked awkwardly and bounced off into the throngs.
“Goodnight, Mr Potter.” Arys shoved him towards the door, where Hermione was embracing a wriggling Ron.
“Malcker, enough. Please. I’ll sort it out.” Perfidy flattens his fringe and cajoles his neck to face.
“This ward, I’m very curious about. I’ve never heard of such a ward.” Rosier stated. The cupboard flapped in indignance.
“Malfoy, just shut up. Right now. I never thought I’d say this, and believe me, I never wanted to, but, you owe me. You know you do and well, I’m cashing in. That desperate. Please.” Harys paused for a breath, “And I need it tonight. Like, now. Before tomorrow morning. And you have to use my wand. I think. Most likely.” Harys grimaced. He knew how Malfoy would despise everything he said but Malfoy did owe him and he wasn’t too noble any longer to cash in on those debts if needs must.
Harry was reading and digesting this unpleasant and yet unsurprising note, as Arys waved her arm grandly and nearly poked out his eye.
“Erm, fuck. I can’t remember. Arys’ll know. She’s upstairs. I’m going to change. I’ll be back. I’m leaving you here, you can manage, right?”
“Shut up, Malfoy, and come on.” Harys, becoming Harry now as the room grew blurred, began Transfiguring Malfoy’s bedcovers in an effort to make him move faster.
“My house.” Harry didn’t feel the desire at the moment, or ever, to explain the intricacies of his Dark Room to Draco Malfoy. “This is my... whatever, erm... This is safest room in the house. I’m going to change.” He looked over at Malfoy, touching the walls and performing little bits of magic with his own wand, too distracted now to comment on Harry’s appearance, “Can you read all my existing wards from here?”
“Just a joke, Minister. Just joking.” Harry informs, rolling his eyes along with the fluffy Spring clouds.
“Yeah, as soon as I saw the body and the Muggle police handling it. I waited, a little, because I initially thought you guys would show up first, but when I realised you hadn’t, I...” Harry trailed off, chewing his nail.
It was an official list of all the expected guests at Hermione’s tonight. Harry groaned. In Hermione’s own handwriting, too. Arys must have Lucifered her this morning. Poor Hermione.
“What the ever-loving fuck now?” He grumbled. From a small slit in the curtains, red, blue and white lights danced around his bedroom.
“Of course.” Harry breathed, as Arys patted his shoulder in the soothing pats she did to calm him down.
“‘Night Great-great-great-grandfather.” Harry opens the book and hears the portrait sputter before rushing away.
“I’m not saying I can’t do it. I’m not even saying I won’t. I’m merely trying to convey the enormous amount of disdain I feel towards you, in this moment. Are you an idiot on purpose, like, do you intentionally go out of your way to try?” Malfoy mused. Despite all of his grumbling and whinging earlier, he was beginning to look amused, albeit begrudingly, and, Harys hoped, a peak interested.
“Because you’re the only one that can! Please. It’s, -- Arseing Merlin -- it’s a fucking ward I made up and you are the wizard who does the timey-wimey magic now aren’t you?”
He saw the Aurors had delivered on their promise sooner than expected. He waved to the Guard, (two Aurors -- neither Harry recognised), and thanked them profusely for their protection. He was Harys, after all. He had to play the part.
Unfortunately, Malcker’s good at something here, so here he stays; here, barking at the Minister for Magic.
“Lord, bless us, every one,” McGonagall mutters to herself, and rises to see the Minister and his troupe out. Harry, still sitting to her left, stifles a snort in his sleeve.
He was sure, however, he would be spending an importune amount of time with the Belgian sisters next week.
“I didn’t say leave!” Harry calls. “It’s Friday! I’m all alone. I’m so lonely!” He play-whinges. really whinges.
Harry gulps on a laugh. Perfidy, petrified, turns slightly aside towards his PR person, who -- along with much of the Hogwarts staff -- is attempting to cover their chortles with coughs and cups.
Harry rolled his eyes as he shook his head. ‘Don’t even,’ he replied. Arys tacked her index finger on the spine of the play to attract the others’ attention.
“You’ll Apparate right back to Pigfarts this fucking second. Or, and I’m being fucking nice, here -- “implementing” your rainbow-pissing “constructive criticism”, I am  -- if you prefer staying, I'll arrange it so I’ll have St. Mungo’s cart you off with a head full of Swiss Cheese in the following fucking second following this fucking second. How about it, now, ‘old sport’?”
“Arys, I’m going to be smothered to death by cravats.” He whined. A floating tray of wine, grapes, and chees es passed by. “Oh, snacks!”
“Honestly, mate,” Ron leaned in, breath smelling like fizzy alcohol, “I suspect,” he paused for dramatics, “she bribed some of them. With BLACKMAIL!” He said proudly.
“Ar--” Arys held up a sharp, pointed finger. He growled and grabbed a sheet of parchment and began scrawling while thinking up something plausible to say to his supposedly empty parlour, “Fucking... lamp... handle... thingy! Argh!” He sputtered.
“I,” Harys closed his eyes as he reveled in his own humiliation, “I told the Aurors’ I knew that the murder was magic because I had a ward up that could detect Dark magic in a hundred metre radius from Grimmauld. I told them I invented it.” He flushed. At least he wasn’t wearing his own face. “The Spell-Masters are to come late this morning and inspect said make-believe ward, and I need it to not be so make-believe by then. Can you help me?” He opened his eyes and tried to appear as miserable and helpless as he could, with Arys face and all not withstanding.
The room was once a drawing room, or some room, but once Harry had hired Arys (or however exactly that had worked), and Memene they had it converted into his dressing room. As a sort-of present and apology to Memene over an outfit arguement, Harry had even given the room a plaque. It was essentially a giant closet. If Walburga could see her old house now. Fuck, if Sirius could see his old house now.
She slammed the door. In dragonskin heels and a mask of some goo on her face, she stalked down the flight of stairs to the kitchen.
He looked behind him at a spelled-silent Malfoy, gesticulating madly. He brought his finger to his lips very pointedly, and nodded to the chair next to him.
What this meant, Harry knew, but nice to have confirmed by Arys all the same, was that the Aurors, or at least Rosier, positively suspected him of some sort of lying or treachery in this affair. Of course they did. That was the whole point of the murder, Harry presumed.
They drank their tea, and Arys swallowed a bit of golden potion from one jug, Harry a reedy, electric chartreuse from the other.
“Oh, tell them, fawn. It’s only done us good.” She flared her nostrils just the slightest so only Harry would notice and hold meaning.
“Something terrible did already happen! Someone was murdered outside my fucking house, Malfoy! And then I... I did some stupid shit, that I don’t need to go into detail with you about, and I made something up that I can’t possibly do on my own. And you’re the last person the Aurors would think I’d go to for help and the best person available to do the favour. Probably the only one.” Harys almost begged.
"Must we review Tea etiquette once more? I don’t want you being churlish with the President’s daughters. They’re very nice girls. Buck up.”
It’s only been a few months since Harry’s last “made an appearance” at the school, and not much has changed. Perhaps his weather and the wardrobe, or the other way around. He can’t quite tell the difference much, any more.
After speaking with the Aurors, very convincingly, (Harys grinned to himself), he Apparated off, wishing them both a good and safe night.
“You know, I daresay that with an exceptionally arrested psyche, one -- meaning you, of course -- can indeed be labeled ‘a brat’ at the more mature age of twenty-three.”
He went up to the parlour. He conversed via parchment with Arys regarding their next few steps. Arys, Malfoy, and Harry would perform an Unbreakable Vow in the Dark Room, ensuring Malfoy’s silence. (A very uncomfortable and somewhat lengthy exchange during which Harry had to tell Arys most everything about the Dark Room and why it even existed. She nearly set herself afire again.)
Oh my God, I can't believe I wrote HOUSE-ELVES who were not in REVOLT like Jesus FUCK MAN! Oh, the shame.
Harry eschewed the Invisibility, chucked a handful of green powder into the fireplace and shoved his head inside.
“Give me your scalp.” She positioned his head. She plucked a jar from her overcoat, and began applying it to Harry’s hair. Astonishingly, it stuck. “Aha! Those Weasleys really do know what they’re doing. I see why you chose them.”
“I can’t get over Goyle, I can’t, I really can’t, Arys. I just, what is Hermione thinking? I know, she’s being Hermione about it, and yes, Arys,” Harry interjected when he noticed the incredible look on her face, “I have asked her about it, believe me. Dozens of suppers. She just says he’s quiet and good at his job. I don’t get it.”
“It’s the afternoon, Harry. Your time for breakfast has long since expired. You’ll eat at Tea, I promise. I’m not sure what, probably some Belgian specialty.”
Harry was pissed, about to storm out of the room to answer the door another time, before Arys grabbed him by the waist of his pants and whipped him around to face her.
“Now, Malcker, old sport, I think I wrapped up this business of any anti-Ministry tomfoolery at Hogwarts. They loved my speech! Right, Harry? Standing ovation!” Perfidy argued.
Harry acquiesced silently. When Arys referred to him as “Harold James”, no matter how many times he protested that wasn’t his name, it meant she was upset. Supremely upset. And nobody could get upset with “Harold James” quite like Arys.
“Right, so, we’ll be back when things are sorted. Anyone else care to join? Right, I figured not. Have a splendid day, all,” he pulls a last face at the remaining and seated.
This was a morning routine. Kreacher would let in the owl he was so terrified of, prepare her a mess of cold pork fat, and then pop off to the Hogwarts kitchens for the majority of the day. The elf spent most of his time between places. Harry suspected he was afraid of Lucy, and strongly disliked her. He wondered if Kreacher would ever try to poison the bird.
Harry looked at Arys, asking her the silent question. Would they ask to see it now? What should he say?
“I invented it. Sort-of.” He managed to look a bit guilty, a bit proud, to both Rosier and Whittery.
Harry wasn’t looking forward to Gala guest-guessing, or Gala etiquette-reminding, but he knew right now, Hermione’d be pulling out her hair, Ron’s hair, and probably the hair of most of her colleagues.
“You did got married! Can we go upstairs and you will tell me about it posthaste!” Harry smiles and tugs his best friend in the direction of the nearest staircase.
“Remind me to tell you next week. No time, now. Oh, and don’t ask him about his broom!” Hermione warned.
“Ah, Phoebs, bloody genius. Let’s ask the table, shall we? Oi, woody, does the wand choose the wizard or is it the wizard chooses the wand HE’S GOING TO SHOVE UP THE OTHER WIZARD’S SHITTER IF THAT’S WHAT FUCKING GETS HIM MOVING OUT OF THE IMMOBILE FUCKING CHAIR. SHALL WE ASK THE CHAIR NOW, COME PHOEBS, LET’S HAVE A GO!” Malcker shouts, chucking his arms about in a bad parody of a Seeker, Harry thinks.
“Oh, no Harry. One would wish it were. I’ve got to be off. Eleanora’s just arrived. I’ll see you soon! Tell you everything next week! Have the vulture--!” She gestured with her hands and turned, finding some important Ministry official. No, not some, Eleanora Bancroft, Goblin Liason Head.
“Right the Tom-fuck you aren’t, Phoebs! It was a standing excretion, I heard. You dropped a steaming hot turd, Perfidy, and now who's the one responsible for cleaning up after your shite, eh? Who?" Tuckholm Malcker wheels his arms around and around.
“MCBRF: Hermione Granger, Hannah Abbott, Peony Brown, Lavander Brown, Blanche Finney, Thurston Ips, Gregory Goyle.” Harry mussed his hair.
Harry relayed the events, honestly, as he did trust Arys and what else were publicists for, if not to protect you from the public?
Arys was waiting for him in the Atrium, talking wands with some Ministry wizard. It would have been the perfect time for the Bloody Mary, if only they weren’t in the Ministry of bloody fucking Magic. Some turned to watch Harry. And that was why he couldn’t do any fun stuff here. And probably why he turned down the Aurors.
He raced to the window. He sent out an Impedimenta, hoping to slow the Muggles’ progress so the Aurors could get there in time and handle the situation. Maybe not the brightest idea, but they were clearing out, and he didn’t know what else to do.
“None of this is probably the best way to go about asking me for a favour. I’d suggest you return home, stick your head under your cushions, and --” Malfoy yawned, mid-bit  Harys couldn’t help but cackle. Well, laugh, would normally be how he did it, but as Arys, certain things about a person couldn’t help but change.
“An hour, perhaps. Maybe less. We’ll send the finest we can spare. Don’t you worry, Mr Potter. We’ve got this now.” Rosier chimed, and with that, they walked to the Apparition point and vanished.
Ron interrupts Harry’s fragmented thoughts, “Bloody hell I’m never drinkung again. Or getting married again. Only, there’s AUGUST!” he bemoans.
“Yes, well, Saviour complex or none, this isn’t any more of Mr Potter’s concern than it is his sleeping neighbors.” Rosier smirked.
“Good morning, Harry Potter,” Kreacher croaked, and Harry poured his coffee from the French-press into a mug.
“You realise, Mr Potter, regardless of your good name and standing, inventing and using a new spell without Ministry approval is breaking a law?” Whitterly asked gently.
“I REALISE THIS, POTTER. THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS AT STAKE PRESENTLY THAN THE STATE OF MY HAIR BUT THANK YOU FOR NOTICING. YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS AS ALWAYS PRECISE.”
“Is this finally happening, then?” A voice behind Harry prompted. He spun around and so did the room. He slapped a hand upon the window to right himself.
“But hopefully only when this is all over.” Whittery mourned, and with that, he and Rosier took their leave. Harry walked them back up the stairs.
Harry grabbed two glasses, passed one to Arys, and then a handful of cheese and one grape. For posterity.
As convincing as her act was, Harry knew she had some alternative reason for wanting a Ministry Guard around the square. He supposed he could go along with it, for now.
“Oh, my millions of Dark wards went off, I saw a dead body outside my window. Naturally, I decided to pop down there in my Invisibility Cloak first, you know, morbid curiousity. And don’t forget, I’m Harry Potter. Yeah, yes, that Invisibility Cloak. The Deathly Hallow you never need to know exists but you may have heard rumours. And, by the way, I can see magic. And smell it. And other stuff I can’t really explain yet. Yes, that powerful. Erm, sorry I forgot to mention that in my most recent interview. Also, you should know, it was my minions that I heard were involved in this one. Red cloaks, gold masks, the usual Potter preferences. Yep, right outside my bloody steps. Such a coincidence, right? Sounds plausible, right? Well-done, me!”
“On what?” Ron gets in really close to Malfoy’s face, and Harry really all of a sudden hopes Arys is somewhere nearby to take care of this situation, because he’s quite sure he’s lost the plot. And is very drunk, that as well.
“I’m sure,” Arys placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder, pressing and Sting Hexing him back into his seat, “Mr Potter is merely concerned about the disturbing events that have taken place outside of his home this evening.”
“Jared wants you for your wand. And even if all these people are there, they don't care what cut or colour my robes are. Besides, you told me once all I needed to have was you on my arm," he says.
Arys, in her writing, was all at once formal and organised, colloquial and shouting, and her postscripts were a cryptic system all of their own. They’d taken Harry nearly a month to decipher. He still didn’t even know what the “E” in her name stood for.
“I knew you’d been reading Shakespeare.” Malfoy accused. “Potter, we may be cordial with one another in public these days, barring recent occasions, but it does not mean I shan’t excavate your tiny little skull just to see what’s in there that makes you think you’re so bloody important you think you can intrude here, at my window, at bloody dawn. And why are you, NOT you?”
He exchanged greetings with the group there, (Hannah Abbott, Peony Brown, Lavander Brown, Blanche Finney, Thurston Ips, where was Gregory Goyle?) and he and Hermione sunk down into an alcove hiding a table of crackers.
