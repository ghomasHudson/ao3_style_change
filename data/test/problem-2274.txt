Harry had never been properly self-conscious – or at least he didn't think he'd been. Hindsight, as he'd discovered only in the past few months, was an interesting thing. Sharing showers and changerooms, getting dressed alongside the other boys – or not, as Harry belatedly realised. He'd rarely shared an open dressing space with his dormmates, and he'd always waited until the shower room was empty before entering himself. It had been natural. Automatic. He hadn't even thought about it, and definitely not with undertones of disgust the likes that Dudley's teasing or Uncle Vernon's blatant homophobia would have exhibited. But it was uncomfortable, he realised. Unnerving to be seen in such a way.
At that moment, Jackie stepped through the doorway, Jill in tow from where she'd apparently been scooped up from outside. As the rest of their friends turned towards them with greetings, Harry turned instead to Draco to murmur in his ear.
Folding his arms, Harry planted himself between Draco and his classmates. He knew he wasn't tall, knew he wasn't big by any stretch, and when compared to someone like Jacob lead the approaching group, he was practically diminutive. Their comparative size and confidence in their superiority was made only more apparent by the casual swagger of their almost synchronous steps, the artfully rumpled slovenliness of their uniforms, the smirks and sidelong glances they shared that bespoke an unvoiced threat. But that didn't matter. If didn't matter because Harry could feel his hackles rise and a rumble build in his chest.
"Yeah." Harry could see that. In such a short time, it had certainly grown harder to tell himself what he almost ached to hear. To feel what he should be feeling.
Draco Malfoy cared. It should have been astounding to hear, almost laughable, except that it wasn't. It definitely wasn't when Harry all but quivered before the echoing sigh of agreement within himself. Wanting wasn't caring. Not really. Or it wasn't usually, because somehow, in this instance, Draco seemed to have crossed the two wires. Somehow and yet perfectly so.
Harry had practiced. He'd gotten good, and at more than simple handkerchief tricks. At times he'd hardly even realised what his fingers were doing; the tricks simply seemed to happen.
Harry was half lost in thought, Draco absently checking his watch, and Harry's friends in various states of slouching and idle conversation, when his phone rang. Shaking himself from his thoughts, Harry drew it from his pocket and glanced at the screen. At the name depicted, he frowned, stowed it away once more, and tuck his hands between his knees.
A woman stood behind the couch, her hand resting casually on the headrest. Her nails were perfectly manicured, but subtly so, almost as though it were happenstance that found her fingers so perfectly adorned. Not so subtle was her beaming smile, the unfurling of her wide lips, and the brightness of her eyes that Harry had seen so many times before.
They had made progress, he and Draco, both independently and as partners. While there might have been a distinct lack of study, Harry didn't think it had been a waste of time at all. Far from it.
"Kind of." His voice was growing strangled now, and Harry couldn't quite work out the exact reason why. It wasn't quite awkwardness from but something like it. Not quite embarrassment either, though that felt a little closer to the mark. Tucking his face into the cradle of his arms, Harry spoke as much to the dark crevice in his lap as to Draco. "I really like it. It makes me feel calmer for some reason. Just touching, or whatever. I don't even care how that sounds, 'cause it's true."
"Then it doesn't matter." Harry pasted a smile on his face, giving Draco's hand another squeeze. Funny, how even holding Draco's hand had once seemed such a battle of with himself. That battle felt so trivial now. "It doesn't make a difference to me, so it shouldn't to you either."
Lily sighed again. "Alright. Just – alright. We'll let this one pass if you promise not to do it again."
"So," Ginny asked as Ron still spluttered about 'betrayals' and 'can't believe's, "what do you think?"
"This break," Draco continued, nodding to himself, "I'll come to Potting Point every day I can to meet you. You have to learn about magic, especially if you're actually capable of using it."
It wasn't that the room was uncharacteristically quiet. It wasn't that the studio manager had stepped in but minutes before, cast a quick glance around, before departing as though she'd been forcibly kicked out. It wasn't that there was tangible tension thrumming against and rebounding off the walls, starting and ending at the photographer.
Harry didn't know how long he would have to wait. He had faith that Draco would meet him with the utmost promptness, but he still might have to wait. Harry wouldn't go far, just out of sight of his house, then he would call for Draco through the mirror again. He wouldn't – couldn't conceive having to spend any longer alone beneath the smothering weight that had fallen upon him.
"I don't mind, Draco," Harry said, still speaking to his knees. "You can think what you want. You can want what you want. But please don't let that get in the way of me helping you when I can. I can't do much, but in this instance…" He paused, squeezed his wand briefly, before releasing it. His eyes flickered up just briefly, peering at Draco through the layers of his long fringe and his glasses that Harry's makeup artist Von would likely have been horrified to see all but masked his face. "Tell me what I can do."
As one, all six pairs of eyes turned towards him. It was the blond that spoke in reply, his hooded gaze unblinking. "And why would you think we cared about what your professor would impose?"
have, defended if he'd been more than a face in a magazine, he couldn't help but feel guilty for his choices.
"Just – can you just give me till after Christmas?" Harry hoped it didn't sound as much like a faintly desperate compromise as he thought it did. "Then we can properly talk, okay?"
Harry wrinkled his nose slightly. How he managed to make the expression anything less than a disaster upon his face, Draco didn't know, but he did. He did quite well, for that matter. "I didn't say it was an exact analogy. Just the beginning part."
Besides, little sleight of hand movements, conjured simplicities, and flashy flourishes weren't anything special – and yet Draco jerked in his seat and swung his gaze towards the rose with wide eyes.
In an instant, Jackie was back to blowing her lips and slouching in her chair. "Are you kidding? I've got some quality reading to do." She raised the book in her hands to present the cover to him.
For a moment, neither of them replied. Jill slowly pushed herself up off her elbows, her eyes wide and staring. Jackie's glare had disappeared, her eyes were just as wide. Pushing herself away from the headboard, she inched across the bed towards Harry.
" – was surprisingly amiable company, and has a way with predicting just what was asked of him," Dimitri murmured a little wistfully, his words snapping into Draco's thoughts like a rubbed band. "He was only a rising star when I first came across him, but you wouldn't have picked it."
"Seriously, though. And let's face it, I'd probably die if I could only eat a – a – what is that, a garden salad?"
Across the room, in what Harry realised with a glance came from the only portrait who hadn't spoken, a humming tune arose. The woman depicted, thin-faced and smiling like the rest of them were, smiled just a little wider when she caught his eye. Her humming rose in volume, and Harry couldn't help but frown. That tune… He was sure he'd heard it somewhere before. Wistful, and smooth, and –
"Sorry to burst your bubble," Harry said, tucking his hands beneath his legs in a far less nonchalant motion. "I don't really know what you were expecting, but it's all just a trick –"
," Hermione broke in, her words slurring as she leant into Ron. The motion dragged Ginny along with her, and subsequently Harry until he was half-hauled around the small, round table. "It's in the
early?" Harry asked. "You're the one who has to get dropped to school every other day because you oversleep. I know who the unusual one of us is."
Only when an exclamation of "Harry!" sounded did he even spare the room a glance. A glance, and then a stare. Why did he always stare? Draco didn't know, but he couldn't quite help himself.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Really? I think you could compete against a Vanishing Charm with how quickly you put it away. Did you actually get a stomach ache?"
Harry turned his frown upon him where he stood still hunched and very distinctly awkward in the back corner of the elevator, but he let it slide. He supposed it was all but expected for it to be Target Harry Day given the circumstances. Instead, he turned back to Ginny as the elevator pinged on a floor not their own. "You're weirdly vocal about my love life these days, has anyone ever told you that?"
"No. There's pictures and things, and that sometimes makes me feel like I remember, but I think that's probably just projecting, you know?"
Even so, Draco couldn't help but return to his staring as he slowly pushed himself away from the door and crossed the room. He paused at Harry's side, and though he knew that Harry noticed himself being watched, doing so with deliberate awareness erased the shame of it. Or at least it did for Draco.
"- but you need to get over yourselves, because this is the topic for our assignment and we're sticking with it. I've already taken notes, and I'm not starting all over again just because you say so." Harry had never been more adamant about his initially reluctant decision than he was now. He was sure he'd cling to it if he had to complete the assignment himself – which was looking increasingly likely. "Get over your superstitious nonsense and pull that fucking stick out of your arse, because whatever problem you have isn't mine. So shut the hell up."
For all that they might have to keep their magic a secret, now that Harry knew the reason for their disconcertion, it became something amusing. Thrilling. The frowns upon hearing everyday comments, and the wariness of anything even vaguely technological, made sense. That was to say nothing of showing them all the wonders of the non-magical world magic that Harry had been a part of since he could barely talk.
"Live a little, Harry," Jackie had continued. "I dare you to take up the challenge. Go on, do it. You might find a wizard master you can apprentice to or something."
Harry couldn't breathe. He thought he might have forgotten how to. He'd almost flinched at Draco's words, at the truth of them, just as he had the accusations they'd exchanged over lunch barely days before, but he withheld. He managed to overlook the stinging burn it provoked in the face of the greater surprise. The greater importance.
Almost against his will, Harry glanced back towards the Little Head Table. His gaze drew unerringly towards Malfoy's white-blond head, caught for a moment, then detached as he shook his own head. The ex-Slytherins were a little confusing, to say the least, with not a single one of them so much as raising their hackles at a passing comment that would have once started a fight. Granted, few muttered such imprecations and accusations even under their breaths anymore, with almost unanimous consensus holding fast to group support and a recovery mentality even for those once excluded, but even so. It was a little unexpected. More than a little.
Harry hasn’t told anyone about his night terrors, not even Ron and Hermione but he hates letting Malfoy feel like he’s the only one who is still affected by the events that occurred in that room.
“Harry,” Draco calls softly, resting his hand against Harry’s cheek, a warm weight for Harry to lean against. HIs thumb gently brushes away the lone tear that managed to escape and he frowns, eyes filled with concern, “what’s wrong?”
He could panic about the future later, when he was alone and wouldn’t rain on Harry’s moment. A part of him wanted to remind Harry that they’d decided they were going to travel. That they had talked about not knowing what to do after leaving Hogwarts but it was okay because they’d at least be figuring it out together.
Draco shrugs again, trying to wipe his eyes discreetly. Harry knows that it’s going to take more than this to convince Draco that it really wasn’t his fault. There are years of guilt and self loathing that he needs to work through.
Draco looks nervous, one hand coming up to run through his hair before he takes a deep breath, visibly steeling himself before he asks, “Would you like to go out for dinner with me? Tomorrow, maybe?”
“Mr. Potter!” boomed the owner, who had a nametag on her chest identifying her as Raz, “What a pleasure to see you! Have you come to purchase a pet? Or, no, it looks like you’ve got that covered! In for some kneazle supplies, eh? Those new hairless ones are quite the rage- I’ve been getting in some special orders just for them! All kneazles love our self heating line, but the little hairless ones especially appreciate it!” Raz pointed to a colorful corner that had what seemed to be far too much cat stuff for the physical space, with self-moving mice, wands, ropes, beds and baskets piled on top of trees and scratchers in all colors of the rainbow, many of which did indeed claim to be self-heating. Harry stared at a color-changing self-playing mouse, which squeaked and turned in circles and undulated between regular mouse color and every other color known to wizards, when he realized Raz was still waiting for an answer, and jerked himself back into the conversation.
Malfoy was not immune to the mirth- it seemed Harry’s hilarity was catching, as he too smiled, and then gave an undignified sort of giggle that only set Harry laughing harder.
“Master Harry should know better,” he said in tones of reproach. “This is not to be a cat, but a kneazle. A finer, purer line Kreacher has never seen! Such a beautiful specimen- all that nasty kneazle fur that gets all over Kreacher’s lovely couches gone. A great work of breeding, as befits a noble beast.”
“Let me assure you that this is in no way- wait. Did you just agree?” asked Malfoy, who had been about to launch into another attempt to sway Harry into going.
“Grimmauld Place has a very similar magic to the Manor- they were connected shortly after I was born, since it was assumed that with all the main line in prison or disowned, the property would eventually come to me. Your godfather escaping and willing it to you put an end to that idea, which is fine, but something of the magic is still the same. I imagine she just got a little confused, and since the Black townhouse DOES still feel like the Manor, she just… misjudged. A little.”
Putting a hand over the kitten to prevent any sudden or fearful leaps, Harry pressed into the store. Once inside, he found that the animal sounds weren’t quite as stressful as he had feared, and that they mostly formed a pleasant background noise as he walked into the shop. He was immediately greeted by the proprietor, a tall, round woman with smile lines and a mop of curly, frizzy hair. He was reminded of a weird cross between Hermione and Hagrid, and this thought made him smile.
Harry had to stifle an unprofessional giggle as he realized that he was standing in Malfoy Manor, mentally comparing the feel of a hairless cat to that of an erect penis. It wasn’t a perfect match, of course, but the sensation of taut, warm skin sliding over something hard underneath- it was definitely enough to make the comparison spring to mind.
Kreacher gave Harry a look, and Harry shrank back a little. Kreacher had, on one memorable afternoon, had tea with Molly Weasley, and the two of them had complained at length about Harry’s deplorable thinness, and general disregard for his well being. It had been mortifying, and seemed to have inspired Kreacher to adopt the persona of a terrifying mother hen. Also, he was fairly certain they owled about him- he was almost sure that he’d seen Molly’s owl, Celestina, flying away from the house on days when Molly had not written to him at all.
Harry poked at the toast and eggs that Kreacher had laid out on the dining room table. Kreacher was bustling about in the kitchen, doing something, but every so often he would poke his head into the dining room, and to forestall his dark mutterings and warnings about masters who did not eat and would surely starve and waste away, he tried to make sure he was in the process of eating something whenever Kreacher appeared. This was not as successful as he had hoped it would be, because by the time he was shrugging on his outer robes and ready to floo to work, a quick peek into the kitchen saw Kreacher perched on a tall stool with an enormous peacock quill in hand, scribbling away at a letter. Harry groaned. It was definitely a letter to Molly Weasley- he’d be lucky if he escaped from this with just some enforced dinner invitations- she’d been hinting with an increasing lack of subtlety that she’d like to come stay for a few days, just to help him out a bit.
Malfoy, Harry was pleased to see, did not look nearly as composed as before. His mouth was hanging open, and his eyes were wide and shocked.
“Master Harry must do as he sees best, of course. Kreacher is not a kitten minder- Kreacher has soup to prepare. If Master Harry does not know what to do, then perhaps Master Harry needs to seek… outside resources,” Kreacher said. His face twisted somewhat, in a way that could only mean one thing. Kreacher had made remarkable strides, and Harry truly believed that he cared for Harry, and his friends, but the long indoctrination by the Blacks in their beliefs of pureblood supremacy meant that Kreacher had a hard time expressing certain ideas.
Peering into his inbox, he saw that for once, he’d managed to make it in before the daily assignments. He sat in his chair, looked at the piles of paper around him, and abruptly decided that he could really use a cup of tea before getting started on the day’s (and previous day’s, and the day before that’s) work.
“Well it’s obvious how she got here, Harry. She’s a kneazle- they have very strong but limited magical abilities. Most kneazles are capable of limited apparition, and highly trained kneazles can be taught to set wards. This is basic magical creature knowledge, Harry. You should know this by now,” she said in a stern voice.
“Uhm,  well, I actually am here about the inspection this time, Malfoy. The one you got a letter about yesterday? I am here to, er,” Harry paused, and consulted the tea-stained parchment in his hands, “Inspect the facilities, report on the health and well-being of all breeding and pet animals, and give my general conclusions about the renewal of your breeding license,” he read off the parchment. He was getting good at that. The first time he’d read it, he’d had no idea what he was supposed to be doing, and he’d stumbled something dreadful. A few more, and he thought he’d be able to ditch the paper completely, and just go by memory. “Look, I have a check list and everything. The first item is living quarters, so why don’t you show me where you keep them all?” Harry asked.
The cat tapestries in the other room had not prepared him for what he saw as he stepped through the door. It was, to put it simply, a cat’s paradise.
“Er, yes Auror Robards, I will get right on that. I just love a good inspection first thing in the morning…” Harry trailed off, and smiled weakly. He took a sip of his tea to cover his nervousness, but judging by Robard’s narrowed eyes, it didn’t work.
He didn’t recognize his voice, or the brown hand that reached out and threw the floo powder in as he called out “Malfoy Manor” and allowed the floo to whisk him away, ejecting him with a cough and a thump into the main room of a place he thought he’d never set foot in again.
A loud, fake cough jerked Harry back to attention. He was still in front of Draco Malfoy, and what’s more, he was here on professional business. Auror Robards would want him to embody professionalism and respect, or whatever else it was he was always droning on about in staff meetings. Honestly, Harry usually spent those meetings imagining himself anywhere else, but he knew they were part of being an auror, so he attended, and only hated himself a little.
“Potter, I see you are back in my home, for some reason. Did you forget something? Are you lost? I would be happy to lend you some of my floo powder, but please, be anywhere but here,” said Malfoy.
Harry stared. He knew his experience with cats was limited, but still, surely he wasn’t that wrong about one of the basic components.
“Potter!” Malfoy barked. “Come away from there, and stop harassing my kneazles at once!” He sounded nervous. Harry became a little concerned. Was there something he didn’t want Harry to see? The cats looked well cared for, but maybe he was hiding something? Maybe it was all an elaborate glamor that would fall apart under scrutiny.
His initial impression of large green eyes, big ears, and droopy skin were all still correct, and even now that he knew she was a cat (or kneazle) he still thought he couldn’t entirely be blamed for assuming she was a house elf. Her pink skin was warm and soft, and as he looked closely he saw that she had tiny, broken off whiskers on her face, and a smattering of hair up the center of her nose.
“Yes, yes, Godric, you’re a very good boy,” murmured Malfoy. He and the cat (apparently named Godric, which Harry honestly had no idea how to feel about) gazed at each other for a few moments, and then he reached an internal decision, and looked up at Harry.
Harry did not have much experience with cats (kneazles), or really with pets of any kind beside owls, but it struck him as rather odd that one would allow itself to be carted around for an entire afternoon, and still have the energy to purr and offer him comfort. It wasn’t so bad, really. He didn’t have the most interaction with Crookshanks, but he was certain Crookshanks would have reacted extremely poorly to many of the things Harry had subjected the little kitten to over the course of the day. Harry began to feel slightly guilty, and rubbed the kitten’s head a little more vigorously, to which she responded with louder purring.
“Alright, alright. You win. I will attempt to talk, to Draco Malfoy, about whether or not he hates me and everyone I love and am related to. But when it all goes pear shaped, you’re the one I am absolutely blaming.”
Hey, just a general disclaimer for the fic and for me as an author, I absolutely do not stand with Rowling's views on trans people. If you do, I'd honestly rather you went and read something else. Thanks!
All at once, it was too much for him. The cats, Malfoy, the idea that he’d needed a year to work up to defeating Voldemort- Harry felt laughter bubbling up from within him, and before he knew it, he was doubled over, practically howling with laughter in the foyer of Malfoy Manor.
Kreacher looked at Harry, and then looked at the arm of the couch. He began to make an odd croaking noise, which, after a moment’s difficulty, Harry identified as laughter.
“I know where the floo is, I’ll just see myself out, and, uh, thanks for the invite! See you tomorrow, must run!” Harry ran from the room back to the foyer, where he threw in a fistful of floo powder, and called out “The Roost!”
Harry paused for a moment, briefly considered getting another cup to replace the one he’d spilled everywhere, and then decided against it. Best to get it over with all at once- like ripping off a bandaid.
Sharp, clicking steps on stone interrupted Harry from his kitten related musings. He jerked his head up, and jerked the kitten back towards him as he realized that he was, in all likelihood, about to come face to face with Draco Malfoy.
Harry was surprised to find that he DID want lunch, and he followed Ron into the kitchen. Maybe it wasn’t too terrible, talking to Ron. And Ron might have a point- he did feel better than when he’d come in. Talking. Who knew?
Every single tapestry in the entry way was of cats. They were not the sweet, saccharine cats that he remembered from Umbridge’s office, or even from Ms Figgs’ house, but they were still undeniably cats. Giant leopards lounging in trees, lions stalking the plains, tigers swimming in pools of water, and of course, kneazles. Kneazle borders around abstract tapestries, kneazle kittens hiding in gardens, kneazles fighting with giant harpies in another. Everything moved with slow, elegant grace, and Harry lost himself in watching the ripple of threads form pictures.
“And what, your first litter just happened to look like me? Malfoy, please, can you just get to the-”
“Minnesota?” Harry interrupted. “Where’s Minnesota? Is it by New York? Or California?” He’d never been keen on geography, and Hogwarts hadn’t helped that, and he realized he had just listed almost his entire knowledge of the United States.
Harry shuffled into the en suite, brushing his teeth and accioing his work robes. They were brown, and while that was not in any way the robes’ fault, Harry resented them, and their drabness. It felt like a personal insult on the state of his drab life, that he needed to not only go to his drab job and spend time in his drab office, but he had to cover himself in the drab brown as well. It seemed like a bad omen.
Harry looked around, not wanting to just start opening random doors, and found his attention drawn to the nearest tapestry. He looked at it, not really taking it in, until he realized what it was he was looking at, gave a snort of laughter, and looked around the room. All of a sudden, it was obvious.
“Well, Potter? I suppose you’re here for the yearly inspection- I will say, when I got a card this evening, I didn’t think it would be quite so soon. And you didn’t have to kidnap one of my kneazles- I would have let you know, you know! And not that it seems you or the Ministry cares, but tonight is a sensitive night for us all, and we’ve been a little stressed, since Chrysanthemum has been missing for almost an entire day, at this point, and really, I don’t know that two hours is enough notice to get the kneazelry into shape! Not that I’m hiding anything, of course, but you must understand that kneazles require a good deal of care every day, and sometimes things get a little bit messy. But come on in! Why not! After all, they can’t just send anyone, oh no! The Boy-Who-Lived himself sent out on a standard licensing inspection, since of course we can’t trust big bad Malfoys. Which is to say-” Malfoy cut himself off with what looked like effort, and glared at Harry.
Malfoy seemed to mistake Harry’s moment of embarrassed contemplation about the sweetness of Malfoy as a sign of anger, because he started babbling.
Harry tried to crane his neck to look at his small, extremely sharp companion, and then decided he might as well make use of her willingness to stay in one place. He called out a quick goodbye to Kreacher, and strode out the door, grabbing his black cloak from the floor where he’d tossed it earlier. He cast a quick drying charm on the robe, a quick sticking charm on the kitten, and then turned and apparated directly to Diagon Alley.
“Yes,” said Ron, relieved. “I am, in fact, talking about racism. Thank you, Harry, I’m still working on giving it its proper name, like Hermione tells me. Because I don’t think you’ll have much fun, if you have to constantly worry about what he’s thinking, if he’s looking down on you for your parents, for having a muggleborn mum or an Indian dad.”
Malfoy’s words echoed around the stone walls of the foyer. Malfoy was frozen, shocked by his presumption and realizing what exactly he’d just said. Harry himself was also shocked- he didn’t think anyone had ever said anything at all like that to him ever.
“As you may have cause to remember, this was right when the Ministry announced that they were going to have the first annual Harry Potter Day, and the magical world lost their fucking minds. Everyone was selling Harry Potter merchandise- you couldn’t walk down Diagon Alley without seeing at least a dozen carts selling the latest and greatest product with your face on it. I think at one point I was offered a two-for-one deal on toilet paper with your face on it.”
“Well, Potter? Do you admit it? Have you come to kidnap my prize kneazle and leave me destitute? What about our previous interaction made you think that you were welcome to drop in again?” Draco’s voice was sharp and clipped, his accent unbearably posh.
“I’m not mad,” said Harry, and he was shocked to find that it was true. He wasn’t mad. The Potteazles (uggh) were honestly kind of cute, and Draco was right, they were a lot better than any of the other merchandise with his face on it. He hadn’t known about the toilet paper before today. Or the popcorn. “I’m a little disappointed though. I wish people would ask before putting my face on things, kneazles included.” Hermione had a lot to say about copyright and the magical world- Harry was sure that in a few years, she’d have the laws needed passed, and that his face would no longer be fair game to anyone looking to make a quick galleon. Causes were absolutely Hermione’s love language.
“Oh, stuff it Malfoy, I’m just looking. Uhm, I mean, as an official Ministry representative, I have the right to examine the animals as needed,” said Harry. Draco looked highly agitated, but nodded.
"Ahem, well. If the next trip will be the one to the night of the party, we need to be prepared. What about my potion? We'll be there twelve hours, I’ll need at least two flasks, right? And what about our appearances? We'll need to disguise or we will be too recognisable and it would be risky. Also, I was thinking that it would be wise to bring along my Invisibility Cloak."
“Look, Draco, I know that—” Pansy huffed before continuing. “I’m just gonna say it. I know you’re afraid because you think that Potter’s going to wake up one day and realise you’re
He kept drinking his firewhiskey, happy to let it flow in his body, helping him free his mind, just enough to forget for an evening who he was, the War he just survived, the horrors he lived. His cock throbbed in his pants every time his gaze crossed Malfoy’s; he remembered all too well what those eyes wanted from him when the grey almost disappeared, replaced by the black of their dilated pupils, sparkling with desire.
Sweat formed on his upper lip and his breathing looked more laboured. When he started again, his voice was strained. “
“Oh my fucking—” Harry’s breath hitches and he keeps trembling as he comes a third time, knot pulsing and pulsing until he almost passes out.
Great, so now Malfoy was even apologising to Harry. This was definitely starting to feel like a dream.
. I just—” he swallowed, scratched the back of his neck. “I just feel angry, all the time. For all the injustice, the pain, the-the evil that’s still around and…”
Draco jumped from the couch, muttering frantically, “Maybe I can still do it in time! Oh Merlin, yes, the ring is—”
Draco’s eyes were shining when he turned to look at him and Harry ached to take him into his arms, hug him, whispering love words into his ears. Draco looked up at him, his voice broke.
He sucked in a breath and lingered a bit longer, Draco’s lips feather-light on his, his tea taste the faintest on Harry. A tear rolled down Harry’s cheek.
One month in, Malfoy started eating popcorn, drinking beer, watching the worst programs on television. He developed an addiction to crime shows and movies, dragging Harry into that too. They watched
His voice was hoarse when he spoke. “I’m sorry, Pansy. I didn’t want to make you worry. I just—” A sigh. “I just felt overwhelmed at the idea of all those people arriving. What if they don’t like the Manor as we arranged it, what if they’ll see… they’ll discover that…”
“I’m here,” Draco said, feeling stupid at the statement but still afraid of letting himself believe this was really happening.
“As I told you, I started trying to get Scarlet Tribe’s attention a couple of months ago, but I was finally contacted by them three weeks ago. I haven’t been inside their base enough to know everything about this spell.”
Draco brushed his lips on Harry’s, it was almost imperceptible. Harry felt a light spark run down his spine, to the core of his magic. But stilled. They had discovered, only a few months ago, that the lightest touch would only make Harry feel mildly dizzy and little sparks shock in him.
Pansy overtook Draco, running down the stairs. She flew past him, giggling excitedly, her balance precarious on her high heels, a fistful of her long bright lavender dress in one hand, to avoid tripping on it.
The room they had just entered was empty but for a tall man in a blue suit, bent over a desk — goggles and ear protections in place — who hadn't noticed them arriving.
“Ah, I see. I’m sorry, Draco. I never thanked you for restoring my portrait, but I am grateful and happy to see that someone in this family has a bit of sense. And, oh Circe, thanks for putting me far from the other Malfoys, they are always horrible with me!”
Their gazes locked and Harry could feel his face burn with lust, could see Malfoy’s cheeky smile, how he’d licked his lips looking right into Harry’s eyes.
“Draco,” Harry started, not knowing how to talk about it without fighting again. “I need you to stop bringing all this negativity to us. There’s a pattern in our travels, I know it and—”
You come, as foreseen, and a second later you hear the sounds of his wet hand furiously tugging on his cock. You want to see that; you turn your head, look over your shoulder and watch as his perfect, thick cock peeks out of his fist, spasming, painting everything with long shots of cum.
, I need—” Draco’s hips bucked forward, making his cock bump against Potter’s cheek. Potter’s tongue darted out again to lick down his shaft. “Please, for all the magic in this world, suck—”
Harry laughed, as Ron’s face reddened so much it matched his hair and muttered something that sounded like, “not true, I don’t care.”
Mrs Darsley’s words played in his mind, clouding it and making his breathing difficult. Was he doing the right thing? Hundreds of people would soon arrive for the Auction, he’d have to present the Manor and be convincing, smile, shake hands, kiss cheeks, pat shoulders.
What happened later had enshrined the pillars of their friendship with benefits. The trip from the door of Draco’s flat to his bedroom had been a mess of tangled limbs, and their feet bumping against one another in the darkness.
That was true. Harry had been surprised to hear that meticulous order leave his mouth, as if it were the most normal thing in the world. But the truth was — it
Malfoy drew out his wand and muttered a revealing spell on Harry's skin that immediately broke out in thousands of little red dots.
It was a bit warmer, but still minimalistic. A library full of books, where Harry recognised the names of both Muggle and Wizarding authors, a desk completely empty except for a cacti plant and two parchments, and three wooden chairs.
"Yeah, I need to go somewhere warm too. Maybe… well, you know, I booked that room at the hotel. Maybe we could go back there?"
"What!?" Malfoy's voice came out high-pitched and only slightly amused. And Harry could understand him, really. What the fuck was happening?
The medi-witch approached Harry's bed and gently smiled at him, performing some basic diagnostic spells as she started speaking.
When they arrived home, Draco took off his coat and shoes and smiled at Harry. “It was a weird lunch, but I feel so lucky, love.” He cupped his face and kissed Harry, who readily wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pushing him closer.
The game went on pretty much the same, with Hermione and Ron sending him glances from time to time, reminding Harry that he hadn’t escaped it and that they’d wanted every single detail of what happened the day after.
“No, I don’t know. And this is a female turtle, Potter.” Draco finally released the shell and looked directly into Potter’s perplexed face. “And she’s gravid.”
“They’re saying you fucked yesterday at the prom,” Pansy says, frowning. “It doesn’t make any sense,” she continues. “Because I’m pretty sure
It was the first time their mouths had touched like this. It was the closest thing they’d done to kissing and Draco was losing his mind as well as his patience.
A second later you’ve stripped him from his trousers, taken his legs and draped them around your waist. “I’ll fuck you so hard you’ll beg me to stop,” you say as he clenches his thighs behind your back. You take out your cock: it’s indecent, lord, Harry Potter pressed against a wall, half-naked, legs entwined behind your back.
“For saving my life. After the war and—” you feel your voice break. You swallow thickly. “And now. Every day.” You take a deep breath, manage to calm down enough to add, “I don’t want to get married to Astoria.”
“But won’t it hurt her? She’s used to us now!” Harry was clutching Lady Luck to his chest so hard Draco really feared he’d crushed her shell.
Harry raised his head to kiss along his jawline, his cheekbone, behind his ear, right where Malfoy’s skin was most sensitive. Malfoy couldn’t stop squirming against him, his hips jutting forward, every brush of their hard cocks eliciting the most beautiful sounds Harry had ever heard.
Harry arched his back, moaning at the feeling of his cock rutting against Malfoy’s hard length. He already felt close. “Ah! Yes, Malfoy,
Malfoy waited patiently for Harry’s cough to settle down. As soon as he could breathe again, Harry gaped at him, taking in the faint blush covering Malfoy’s cheeks. Damn, but it was a cute sight.
Harry waved his wand to clean himself up. In a whisper, he tried a weak, “Honestly, I had hoped so.”
Clever Hermione. She really knew him by now, and the pockets trick had always been the best one. Once Harry had found a note that said, ‘remember who you are’, and spent two days philosophising about life and death, then Neville had confessed to him he had slipped it into Harry’s pockets as a joke since he had developed an obsession for a Muggle cartoon,
With a hand on the doorknob of the bathroom, Draco felt his boldness abandoning him. What would he tell Potter when seeing him? ‘Oh, hi, what a coincidence’?
Tickets in hand, heart furiously beating in his chest, Draco looked as Harry entered their living room. And all of Draco’s blood drained from his face in sheer horror.
Immediately behind him, Granger and Weasley. Draco blinked through his surprise, searching for Pansy in the crowd and finding her. She smirked, mouthing something Draco didn’t catch. It was probably a reassurance, like ‘stay calm’.
Draco now opened both his eyes and they stared at the horizon, where sky and water met in a trembling line, in front of them in silence.
Harry looks at the eager faces of his friends—Hermione is there too, she must have spent the night with Ron. Perfect. Just perfect.
Harry nodded. He wasn't going to study anymore. He knew he wouldn't, and not only because he was tired. For all that Draco's studiousness was motivation enough, Harry was neither a good nor an avid studier himself. Reading printed words simply didn't work for him in the same way that it did for people like Draco and Hermione.
"Alright, you two," Hermione said as Ron returned to his armchair, bowl in hand. "Even I'm getting sick of it now, and your antics aren't even for my sake."
arose as a random thought in Harry's mind, and for a moment all he could think of was Parkinson's sneer, and Bulstrode's glare, and Malfoy's slinking flight after the Death Eaters as they fled from Hogwarts at the end of his sixth year. Except that, even with those thoughts arising, when Harry managed to focus his attention upon Malfoy – was it Malfoy? Yes, surely it was. No one else was quite that blond – he didn't feel angry. He felt… he felt…
A wizard master. Maybe not a magician but a wizard. What if he was? What if the showman Tyrell Trickson – a name that was so obviously false that Harry couldn't help but roll his eyes when he'd first heard it – could cast actual magic? Would he use a wand, or was he like Harry? Would he use both magic and sleight of hand, just like Draco was convinced that Harry did?
Shunting the thought from his mind, Draco frowned through his camera, adjusted the angle just so, and took another snap. Another tweak, another glance, and a second, then a third. As he eyed the fourth, nodding absently to himself even as he frowned at the flaws he could already see simply on the digital face, flaws that would have to be smoothed away, he straightened.
The woman at her side stared at Draco with a scowl rapidly growing upon her face. The man alongside her glanced at her sidelong before eyeing Draco with thinly veiled contempt. In all likelihood, Draco was assuming the degree of their hatred for him – he was fairly sure that first woman was a Muggle, anyway – but he abruptly decided he'd had enough. Not today. He couldn't face it today.
Hermione didn't look deterred, but Ron's face cleared a little. A small smile touched his lips. "Yeah, I hear you. How much more of this essay do I have?" He flipped through the parchment sheets before him, wincing at the minimal stack. "Dammit, I could have sworn I'd written more than this."
Flipping through the pictures again, placing potential 'not terrible' ones in a pile, Draco set about assisting where Pansy hadn't asked him to. She didn't chide him for stealing her pile; rather, when the waiter reappeared with quiet askance as to whether they would like to order or not, she waved him away to allow Draco to continue.
Draco's stomach dropped. That tight knot that had been coiled in his gut clenched with renewed force. Harry wasn't there. Neither was Ipetsky. Draco hadn't seen them leave and cursed the bloody git who'd distracted him from his sidelong staring that was maybe a little creepy but that he chose to ignore for its creepiness.
Draco clicked his tongue. His demanding almost-nervousness had faded into visible annoyance, which only added to Harry's confusion. "You're a Muggle. You shouldn't be talking about magic, let alone claiming you can use it."
A breath of exhalation that felt like a laugh as it brushed Harry's cheek fluttered across the distance between them. "Am I okay?"
Harry laughed. His agitation from waiting might not have abated, but how often did anyone get to see their best friend finally ask the object of their affections on a date? Even more rarely that it actually amounted to something.
"We get the chance to reflect upon the truth of our personal history," Clio said just as softly. "To view it without the tarnish of bias."
It took ten minutes. Ten minutes of ignoring him before Draco cleared his throat and spoke. "If I offended you, I'm sorry. Weasley family and my own have… a history."
Harry didn't reply immediately. Lowering his gaze, he regarded his feet at they crunched over the pebbled shore, little scraping, grating sounds of stone on stone elicited with each step. Each time Draco had asked him that question over the past few days, the same question that he all but knew the answer to and yet wanted to reclarify again and again, to get a proper answer,
He hoped that Jacob was half-blinded by the glitter-dust. He hoped Leonard had bruised his arse when he'd fallen, and that Jacob's stumble had knocked Keith out of play. He hoped that one of them had tripped down the stairs, or that they hadn't seen which direction he'd fled, or that they decided to give up because they knew Harry was fast and he could outrun them, just as he always had.
"Such as the impact of the war, and the grimy parts that no one likes to look at, let alone talk about. Such as the fact that families of Death Eaters are still being unjustly accused, convicted, and shunned even years after when we should – and do – know better."
How Harry ended up on his back, he wasn't quite sure. If he tried to track the sequence of events, he could have sworn he'd set the ground rules despite Draco's suggestiveness. Magic first. He wanted to study magic first, even if the alternative was looking just as if not more appealing these days.
Harry glanced back towards her. He frowned. Her face had paled, and Ron's had grown so wan himself that his freckles stood out in stark relief. It wasn't a good look for him, even if Harry had found him attractive in the first place. "What?"
Something had changed the night before. Something big, warm, and a little desperate. Though Harry couldn't put a name to it, he clung to that change with trembling, grasping hands.
"Two," Harry said, ignoring him again, "curious? Curious my arse. You and Pansy just about shit yourselves when we mentioned it last week."
One such bruise was still discomforting him from barely days ago. As Draco dropped to a squat, he couldn't quite withhold a grunt for the protest of muscles in his lower belly. He ignored the glance his assistant Dawley gave him and instead set about firmly affixing his attention on his camera as he unpacked it from its case.
At least Jackie wasn't glaring anymore. Apparently dinner really had helped to disperse her foul mood a little. Her arms were folded across her chest once more, however, and her eyebrows lowered. She regarded him shrewdly, like a school teacher with a particularly unruly child that she was contemplating sending to the principal's office. Except that Harry doubted any principal was capable of dishing out a punishment quite like what Jackie could manage.
It could be awkward, discomforting, so Harry avoided most interactions in a way different to Jackie's disregard. But partner work called for extenuating circumstances, and Harry might not be
As Harry spoke, continuing with a tangent that Draco was familiar with but hardly to such an extent, Draco could only stare in suppressed wonder. Harry actually knew what he was talking about. Really knew rather than just 'regurgitating headlines' as Clementine had said. Had he looked it up before they'd arrived? But no, he wouldn't have had the time. Had he really had an interesting in working with Clementine for so long that he'd made a point of keeping up with news of her? No, that didn't seem right either.
A squawk of surprise turned into a shout. A voice that sounded almost apologetic preceded a shriek. Feet scuffed the ground, something like a curse – magical, not simply an angry slur– seemed to snap through the air, and Draco only half bothered to strain his ears to hear the sounds of his attackers' continued company. When the tussle subsided, when nothing but the traffic and the hubbub on the footpath met his ears, his heaved a sigh and slumped back onto his heels. His gaze dragged heavily up to the abandoned opening of the alley.
"Yeah," Harry muttered, staring out the window as a smear of cloud shadowed the moon and briefly enveloped the garden in darkness. A second later and he jerked so violently he almost fell from his seat. He snapped his gaze towards Ron. "Shit."
Harry found that he became cold often. He'd asked Ginny if his skin felt chilled and she'd shaken her head with a bemused frown, but he still felt it. Not even cocooning himself tightly in a blanket helped to chase it away.
was an unremarkable building situated between similarly unremarkable if regal estates of a consistent height. Draco only identified it from the building at its side that stood out like a beacon, starkly black and white, and contrasting to the pale colours of those surrounding it. He swept past the markedly thinner pavement-idlers towards the building, unmarked but for a rusty-red wall depicting the restaurant's name in minute writing.
Another whisper of warmth curled like a tendril of ribbon against Draco's skin as Harry gave a small sigh. Then he tipped his head into the back of Draco's neck once more and that touch of coldness returned, a blatant contrast to the warmth enveloping the bed.
So he does, till they’re interrupted by the soft hooting of an owl sitting on the kitchen windowsill.
He’s shaken out of his musings by the feel of Harry’s foot nudging against his. He looks up to find Harry looking at him, an eyebrow arched in question. Draco shakes his head, grabbing his wine glass to take a big sip. Harry in this light is a reminder of all the changes he wasn’t here for. The soft light from the candles highlights the sharp slope of his jaw. It’s very distracting.
He knows Scorpius seems okay with it for now but there will be questions in the future; luckily, Draco knows he won’t be alone, Harry will be there with him to guide Scorpius.
Malfoy picks up the puppy follows Harry into the kitchen. Before Malfoy can comment on the state of his kitchen, Harry explains, “I had a little trouble while baking today.”
It takes me a while to get myself under control. I watch as I pull my cock out, his hole is still so open, stretched and gaping as my come drips out and down his crack.
Scorpius looks interested at that but quickly looks away before Harry can notice. Harry almost laughs out loud;
“You’re very good with him,” Harry offers, leaning back on his chair to grab the tin of biscuits from the counter behind him.
“I found some of my old toys while cleaning up,” Draco hurries to catch up to Harry. “I was wondering if Teddy might like to have them.”
He’s not ready for Draco to all but fling himself into Harry’s arms, hugging him tightly. Harry reacts on instinct, holding onto Draco gently, one hand rubbing Draco’s back soothingly. He can feel Draco’s shoulders shudder, hear his breath hitch, he can finally smell that maddeningly addictive scent again, something that’s purely Draco and has been on his mind for days.
Harry nods, finally heading through the doors. Draco stands there for a bit till the wizard behind him grumbles pointedly, making him flush and move aside.
The wind picks up speed around them, the rustling of the leaves filling in the silent gaps. Draco stands there, surprised, lost for words as Harry continues.
Harry can’t remember having had so much fun in a long time. They didn’t run out of things to talk about the entire time, he
After one such impromptu meeting, Sprout had stopped Draco on his way out. They had spent over an hour going over his notes on the soil to fertiliser ratio for Mandrakes. She had hesitated a little and had asked Draco to grab a seat before asking if he was aware of the Herbology Institute. On hearing Draco’s unfamiliarity with it, she had filled him in. How it was one of the best schools for Herbologists interested in research. How each year she would recommend a student based on their abilities.
He pulls the last batch of cookies from the oven, they’re crispy, light golden-brown and smell divine. Harry hopes that Malfoy likes them as much as he does. In an effort to integrate himself into the community and not end up living like a recluse like at Grimmauld Place, throughout the week Harry has made an effort to meet at least one of his neighbours from down the street. He’s met the wonderful couple that live two houses down, old Mr. Perkins who can be found playing with his grandson, the Smiths, a family of five that decorate the house together and invited Harry over for dinner.
As curiosity overtakes exhaustion, Harry settles in, pulling the covers halfway over himself as he drags the box closer. Pulling out the first photo on the top, Harry barely resists throwing it back in as he took in his dreadful hairstyle. The neatly written date at the bottom right corner makes him smile in awe, remembering little bits and pieces of the night. It was the first time Draco had joined their pub night, invited along by Hermione of all people. Harry had been surprised, and a little skeptical. He remembers asking Hermione if she was absolutely positive about bringing Malfoy along. Smiling at the photo now, Harry's glad she pushed for it, gave Draco a chance to find friends and move on.
that he’s thought about it, at all. And if Harry tells himself that it’s only innocent curiosity that makes him want to learn more about Malfoy, then, well, there’s no one to tell him otherwise.
Surprisingly, Draco sees Harry more than he thought he would, considering this isn’t even a case he’s a part of. Harry seems to have a knack for knowing when Draco’s in, dropping by with a cup of tea or, once, a bag of lemon cakes that he mentions picking up “just because.”
“Draco,” Harry said, looking apologetic. “I’m so sorry. There was a combat practice that ran over and I couldn’t leave even—”
Grabbing treats from the bowl under the window, Draco slides it open to gently take the letter tied around his left leg. Ignoring the treats placed in front of him, Maximus nudges Draco’s fingers with his beak till he’s rewarded with a chuckle and light scratches across the back. “Greedy little thing, aren’t you,” Draco murmurs fondly, giving Maximus his required dose of attention before pushing the treats forward. “Eat up.”
“Malfoy,” Harry calls out, waving cheerfully as he jumps down his front steps. It had taken him some time to get the information he needs, he is just on his way when he spots Malfoy and son walking down the street. He waits till they’re about to cross his house before calling out.
Draco is across from the bed, both hands wrapped around a steaming cup as he gazes out the window. He's wearing one of Harry's favorite outfits, besides Draco being entirely devoid of clothing of course. The stark white shirt is creased and only halfway buttoned but Draco makes even that look elegant, one collar dragging across his collar bone and almost falling off the shoulder. He's lost in thought, the shadow of a smile ghosting across his lips, his sharp jawline in contrast to the slight morning puffiness of his cheeks.
It was days upon days of theoretical studies on spell work and damage, practical hours on forms of combat, ward breaking and spell detection. It was more work that Harry had imagined.
day stuck just with Malfoy. Okay, whenever they’ve been paired with each other in the past they’ve worked quite well together but… seriously...again?
Draco brings Harry’s arm up to brush a kiss against the back of his hand before settling down again with Harry wrapped all around him. He’s warm and snug, Harry’s deep breaths pulling him closer and closer to sleep.
He watches as Malfoy takes a deep breath, his smile dulling  a little as he steels himself to say something. “There’s something else you should know, Potter.”
“Thank you.” Emma smiles, taking the offered bottle of wine with a chuckle. “I can’t take any of the credit though—this was entirely my beautiful wife’s vision. Speaking of whom,
Harry shrugs off his outer coat, wincing at the rain of soot that gathers at his feet. No matter how many times he travels by Floo it's never going to be his favorite mode of transport. Sometimes, however, like today, it's faster to just Floo from his office than to walk all the way to the Ministry apparition point.
This drabble was the winner that week. I remember staring at my screen in shock because I would have been glad to just survive another week!
Emma looks radiant, her sparkling blue dress in stark contrast to the dark formal robes she wears to work. She gives him a hug, inviting him in.
Harry climbs up the steps to Draco’s house slowly, nervousness making him clench his fingers around the wine bottle in his hand.
“Ah, thank you,” Draco says bashfully, settling into his seat “It was a long and arduous process tracking all variables and finding optimum conditions, but the results were pleasantly surprising.”
Malfoy goes on, running a hand through his hair, “It was in Vienna that everything changed. I don’t know why I chose that city but I did, and one night brought my life of self destruction crashing down on me.” He breathes in, taps the table with his fingers, his brow is furrowed as he recalls those memories, the downwards turn of his mouth reminding Harry too much of sixth year.
It takes him just a few seconds to come to terms with the realisation that he’s okay with holding Malfoy in his arms for as long as it needs for  him to stop looking so scared.
Harry wakes up on the floor, Hermione kneeling next to him while the rest of his friends alternate between looking at him and at Draco. He groans, standing up with Ron’s help.
Draco found himself fascinated, leaning forward to take a closer look at the brightly flickering flame. It looked normal, except for the unusual purple edges and the fact that it was burning steadily without any wood, tethered to the cauldron.
, murmured against his lips is enough to make Harry choke on a sob and kiss Draco back, too lost in the arms of the man he loves to notice the people cheering around them.
Now, with Luna at the bar with Seamus, Harry and Hermione were left alone with Malfoy who seemed to be enjoying himself just as much as they were and
The wedding planning is an exercise in patience. If pressed on the issue, Draco would have conceded that
Harry stands against the entryway, smirking at the sight of Draco in an apron. It is cute, yeah, but the sight made him want to push Draco up against a counter and mess him up a little. Unfortunately, with Scorpius just outside that isn’t really an option but he
It’s a silly little thing but within minutes they’re arguing, each trying to keep their voices low so as not to wake Scorpius.
The not knowing had seemed less daunting then, when he was sure there would be someone with him. However, as Draco watched Harry go over the letter again, he could feel the uncertainty ready to rise and overwhelm him again.
Once the dishes have been cleared away, kitchen spotless once again and wine bottles and glasses transferred to the living room, Harry is scared the nerves will come back.
Harry laughs, the loud, unabashed laughter that he only lets loose in front of a select group of people. Draco pushes himself off the counter and heads towards the stairs, but not before passing by Harry and pressing a kiss to his cheek.
He had accompanied her to the Emporium, and just like the last time she had gone looking for a pet, she had fallen for the one owl that had refused to co-operate, had stubbornly looked the other way as she tried to talk to it and had almost bitten Harry’s finger off. Athena was still a stubborn thing but Hermione adored her and she had almost stopped biting Harry now. As long as he kept the supply of owl treats going.
“I’m always a good boy, Granny,” Teddy giggles, jumping up to hug her waist. He scampers up the stairs, making sure to shout “I love you” before running around the corridor.
Just five days before the biggest realisation of his life, Malfoy compliments Harry for the first time.
The cabin they arrive at for their reunited family holiday looks cosy and the scenery outside makes a Muggle think of Narnia in winter. In such a beautiful place one can’t stay too much indoors. So snow fight it is.
“Papa,” Scorpius whispers to Malfoy,making a great show of turning away from Harry so that he doesn’t hear. “What is the word when two people live side by side? The one that Grandma used yesterday.”
“Eight months after my release and I was living life with no direction. Every month was a new city, I would drink the night away, many times in the arms of men whose faces I couldn’t recall the next day. It was, without a doubt, the lowest I have ever felt in my entire life and yet, I saw no reason to change.”
Harry can feel Hermione’s letter glaring at him from his personal notice board where he’d distractedly tacked it on yesterday. Pinned on between an old map of London and a month old pile of bills he needs to get reimbursed, he had placed it hoping that having it front and centre would make sure he doesn't forget.
“Anyway,” Ron says cheerfully as they walk out the shop, having finally found something worthy of using a bribe to aid in begging for Hermione’s forgiveness, “how are you doing these days? Settling in alright? Hermione wanted me to ask if you had unpacked everything yet and for your sake I’m hoping you have, you do not want her to get on your case about that. She’ll make you work throughout the day till everything’s done.”
Despite the shiver wracking his frame—less from the cold and more from the wand aimed directly at him, he suspected— Draco stood tall.
“Come on in, Potter and cut the act. It’s not like you’ve been very subtle with your peeking onto my property, which, by the way, is an offence.”
“Aha,” he exclaims, spotting fresh strawberries on the counter. A quick survey of the kitchen shows he has everything he needs for a delicious snack.
Their relationship was still new, in the stage where everything was bright and there was nothing wrong with the world. And after six months of dating, it was a given that they needed to merge their worlds in a way or another.
brought it within reach, Draco grabbing it in mid-air to blink through sleep-heavy eyes at the messy scribble.
. Malfoy is staring at him, biting his lip as he waits for Harry to reply. The ache has been replaced by a warmth that’s filling his body, starting from his toes to the tips of his fingers.
He laughs nervously, trailing off when Draco doesn’t join in. He looks tenser than before, his shoulders hunched and fingers curled around the edge of the counter.
. He truly had no plans for after. He had been so content with his life right now that, for once, he had not been worried about the future.
Lost in thought Harry almost misses the person seated four benches down the path. They haven’t noticed him yet, gazing straight ahead at a child playing in the snow. As he makes his way closer, Harry takes in the wind tousled blonde hair, long enough that the ends are brushing against the beige scarf tucked into the blue coat. The sharp jawline and pale, yet flushed, cheeks are making a long lost image rise to the forefront of his memory. It’s only when he comes to a stop next to the bench that Harry finally catches on.
“Come on,” Hermione calls, she’s quite a way down the street, smiling patiently as she waits for Harry to catch up. “We still have to get Christmas crackers and gifts for Molly and Arthur. And the puppy!”
He can see that Scorpius is trying to say something and though it’s difficult, he wants nothing more than to comfort the kid, he stays patient.
Earlier, when I would sleep alone, I learnt to time my breathing to the ticking of the clock on the wall and let that overtake my mind. Until nothing remained but the steady tick-tock of the seconds hand as I counted down the minutes until dawn. That is no longer an option now, Draco’s appearance in my life made sure of it.
He waits, wanting Harry to understand that he was against breaking the rules. Harry runs a hand through Scorpius hair and prompts him gently,  “Go on.”
Harry looks up to see Draco holding out the bag of candy canes that they brought from a street vendor for Scorpius. When Harry had insisted on buying them for the little boy, Draco had smiled indulgently and only put up a token protest, rolling his eyes when Harry had whooped in joy once he had said yes.
Eight months in, that had become a routine, too. They bought some dildos and plugs and played around with them. One memorable time, Draco had magically affixed the dildo onto the bed and bounced on it while Harry watched, cock in hand. Nothing was anything near satisfying — Harry needed more, needed to kiss those rosy lips, to lick Draco’s tantalising neck, touch his pert arse, bury himself into him.
“Draco?” A moment later, Pansy appeared at Draco’s side. She looked between the two of them with an eyebrow raised, finally settling on a smirk. “Potter, how nice. Those flowers in your hair are so pretty.”
After the first three weeks like this, Draco looked like a ghost in his own house. Every little noise would make him jump, make his heart pound madly in his chest, ringing loudly in his ears. That’s how Pansy found him the first time: crouched on the floor, silently crying.
“Ha bloody ha.” Harry shuffled his feet, sucked his bottom lip into his mouth. “Take off your shoes.”
She wiggled her eyebrows and glanced at Ginevra, who nodded at her. “Well, we were walking by the river, you know, and we were talking about the divorce… your upcoming wedding… and how we should have bought a gift for you, on top of other things?! And we may have been a bit tipsy…”
"So, let me see if I understood it right this time. Jacob casts the bond, something goes off, the bond should link our minds, skin, feelings, but the only one completed is the skin one. Jacob is missing, and I'm fucked."
When the yellow car stopped by them, Malfoy let out a scandalised screech, declaring he'd "never get in a thing so precarious", but following Harry nonetheless.
Harry laughs, reaches a hand out grabbing Draco’s shirt and pulling him into his chest. “Fine, I don’t care. The only thing I care about right now is you.”
When he got to the door of the laboratory Harry found the usual sign: “Work in progress — do NOT come in.” Harry rolled his eyes— everyone knew by now that Malfoy never took it down, not even when he wasn’t preparing potions at all.
“No. I told you not to take the Veritaserum, because I don’t trust you to not use Occlumency to shield it, Malfoy. I don’t trust you.”
“When you lick things before eating them. Mind you, it’s disgusting and unhygienic, and I don’t dare imagine what happens in your stomach but—” Potter rolled his eyes, huffing. “— but, er, I kinda like it.”
Malfoy’s smile didn’t falter at all. He just shrugged and said, “Maybe? Or maybe we found ourselves stuck in time. Which reminds me! You said something once about fixing the Time Machine! And I really didn’t like Geremia—”
“What! How can you lay down like that, Tori, after all of this! How could we be so blind? I mean, they bought a house together! A house!”
“Merlin’s flaccid balls! I am so angry I could fucking burn this horrible house to the ground!” Ginny was pacing angrily back and forth in the veranda of the beach house. She and Astoria had arrived less than an hour earlier.
His best friends burst out laughing, Hermione barely breathing when she choked out her, "Oh, Harry."
He tried to look normal throughout all the goodbye-greetings, and after a weird moment with their wives —
Twelve months in, and it occurred to Harry to check the calendar. He was shocked to find it was just a week past the anniversary of their last Hop. Surely Hermione and Geremia would be close to finding a solution and get them back home, right? He started maniacally counting every day that passed, much to Boo-boo and Draco’s dismay. “Harry, it’s of no use,” was Draco’s favourite phrase.
Just as Hermione opened her mouth to reply, the waitress approached. She was lovely, really. All smiles and plump lips, fluffy hair around her head. “What can I bring you love birds?”
“Wait—” Harry grabbed the envelope with the snakeskin and threw it at Malfoy. “Okay. It’s my turn, right?”
Malfoy wiggled his hips. “Perhaps,” he said, casting a quick cleaning charm and slumping on the rug, rolling on his back. He widened his legs and Harry crawled between them.
"Okay, then listen carefully. You must tell us exactly what Jacob does, okay? Don't think about the words, we can hear them with a simple spell."
After a second, Harry followed him, taking shrunken pans and trays out of his pockets, his cheeks flaming and absolutely adorable.
The conversation kept Draco busy for the first half of the dinner, but it wasn’t of any help for the remaining hour. His eyes kept skimming from one table to the next, making sure everyone was having a good time, enjoying the night. He found his eyes lingering over Potter’s table far too often, always with the same reaction of a hot feeling all over his face and neck, and his heart racing like a Snitch. Of all the wizards in the world, was it possible he found Potter… attractive?
Oh, fuck. Harry was so screwed — they were going to discover, he knew it, but tried anyway. “Guys, can’t we just drop—”
The bathrooms were just behind the big stairs in the atrium, the ones in front of the cherry wood doors at the entrance. Draco cast a quick look at the cuckoo clock: 11 pm. In an hour the guests would begin to go home — if he wanted a chance to talk with Potter, this was the right time.
“You could say that, Harry.” Ginny was tapping her fingers on the table, quickly, mechanically, as if trying to dig a hole in it.
“Well, I’ll be going. See you.” Everyone shot him knowing looks, or amused ones in the case of Pansy and Ron, and told him goodbye, their sweet voices and fake hearts flying around him. Draco shook his head and sped out of the pub, hoping to find Potter still waiting for him.
? It was too much. “Excuse me,” he muttered, then finally crossed the last few metres to the window doors of the ballroom and exited to the gardens.
, coveted tipsiness, come to rescue him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco managed to say, looking anywhere but into Pansy’s eyes.
Harry stopped his maddening pacing to look at her, her calm smile, her bright eyes. Malfoy was looking at her with his eyebrows wrinkled, his face a painting of doubts and questions but she sounded confident, and if there was a person Harry trusted with his life, it was Hermione Granger.
He pushed his cock just a fraction more into Potter’s mouth, grazing the back of his throat, making him gag. He’d be worried if this was the first time they were doing this, but by now Draco knew for a fact that Potter loved having Draco’s cock throat-deep in his mouth just as much as he did bollocks-deep in his arse.
“Don’t ever feel ashamed of it with me. I gave you full consent, you know I like it. I just… I’m afraid I’ll always wake up, you know?”
When Malfoy spoke again, he stuttered, his voice so low and quick he almost looked like he was muttering to himself. "Harry,
“Potter,” Malfoy calls him after what feels like an eternity, tugging at his shoulder. “You’re crushing me, you big oaf!”
This time, Potter burst out laughing, nearly choking on his tea. “Pancake King, is that even a thing? Berk.” He ran a hand through his hair, only messing it up further. “I like it when you do that.”
Harry looked at Malfoy, taking deep breaths, focussing on his lips and the reassuring words that were coming out of them. Soon enough, he found himself both calmer and aroused.
“Lick the rim of your glass,” Harry said without thinking. Malfoy raised one eyebrow, muttered, “you’re weird,” and proceeded to comply with Harry's order.
Potter had turned, a pan in his hand, with what looked like pancakes still frying in it. Draco felt his cheeks growing hot under Potter’s steady gaze and his brilliant smile.
Something sticky touched his lips and Draco opened his mouth, sticking out the tip of his tongue to lick at the object pushing against it. It was sweet— almost too sweet.
“She’s right,” Parkinson interfered. “And you know, Potter, Seamus is entitled to three more questions now.”
You grit your teeth, push your cock inside him. Fuck, it hurts. If it hurts for you, it must be hell for him. You look into his eyes, but they’re closed. He’s biting on his lips, his hands crossed on your nape, nails digging into your skin.
, it was the first time someone did that to me.” Harry gasped at Malfoy’s fingers now slipping in so easily, so known, familiar.
“T-then you fucked me, Draco, y-you thrust your cock in me so deeply, I felt so full and it was so new… I asked for more almost immediately.
With a snap of Harry’s fingers, a stasis was put over the food in the kitchen as a couple of bowls levitated from the kitchen to the bedroom. He clucked his tongue, staring into Draco’s eyes.
He snorts, adjusts his position so that he’s facing you. He threads a hand through his hair, messing it up even more. It only makes him look sultrier.
So here they were, snooping around Hogwarts from time to time, getting to spy on their old selves, mocking each other, showing Boo-boo around their old school. Apparently, he couldn’t be seen by the ghosts of Hogwarts either.
Harry sat down, leaning back against the trunk next to Malfoy, trying to ignore the mad speed of his own heartbeat. He was sure Malfoy could hear it for how loud it was pounding.
On Saturday, Draco didn’t even let Potter speak first when he entered in a lavender sundress. “What the heck are you wearing, Potter? And don’t even start again, Lady Luck is perfectly healthy!”
, lighting the air between Harry and Draco — they were standing close enough that their breaths mingled together but not quite able to touch each other.
"Listen, there's no time now. Look, a taxi." Harry waved a hand to the driver, shouting, "Over here, please!"
Naked, drunk, in a room he didn’t recognise. Oh, and tied up. Very much tied up, wrists and ankles locked to an unfamiliar bed.
A violent rainfall started plunging a second later and they rushed to swim out of the water, collecting their clothes and finding shelter under a big palm tree, laughing like teenagers who’d pulled off a prank.
Harry’s mind was a mess and his body was starting to succumb to his thoughts. A growl formed from his very guts and escaped past his lips as Malfoy’s face took on a pleased expression.
Draco mouthed an “exactly” as she shook her head and led them to the Thought Chamber to actually get some work done.
It had been hard for Draco at first, so used to strict mandatory shifts, but he’d quickly gotten used to the slower pace that cities living with the ocean rhythm gave.
"I'll never understand the fascination with those… phobile? Cellone? Ugh," Malfoy whispered to Harry, his face a perplexed mask.
Grimmauld Place had been cleaned up: everything was shiny and polished, Walburga’s portrait had been shut down somehow by Kreacher— Harry didn’t ask for details, he was just savouring the sudden quiet in the house.
“Oh, lord,” Harry grits out. “No! I don’t know why… we… well, it’s none of your business anyway!” And that’s just the truth, right? Because Draco’s not Harry’s boyfriend and Harry has no obligations towards him. Except Draco looks hurt now, and Harry’s heart clenches painfully.
Needless to say, the morning after they were both walking funny. Harry had never had so much sex in one single night.
Oh yes. We do. Harry pulls off and they rearrange to be face to face. Malfoy hooks his hands under his knees and spreads open for Harry.
“Have mercy, for fuck’s sake.” Malfoy had been so breathless his complaints weren’t holding any strength. His cock had swelled slowly, but oh so beautifully, red, sticky, vein throbbing.
He was sitting at a table with Pansy, Blaise and some other old classmates from Slytherin. Pansy insisted Draco should try to have some kind of interaction with them, trying to reconnect, which resulted in a table full of embarrassed guests.
, hanging out on a Friday night with their friends, sharing small talk about their daily lives. Every now and then, Potter would squeeze Draco’s knee under the table or brush against Draco’s hand, white-knuckled and tightly wrapped around his pint, and Draco would hate his life. So. Damn. Much.
Draco took a second before replying, letting the remark about their Hogwarts House roll off his back, concentrating instead on the flavour of the apples that melted on his tongue. He was unable to resist closing his eyes, an undignified moan escaping his lips.
Draco took a deep breath as the song of the wooden canary reverberated through the walls. It was six o’clock, time to start. Smiling as widely as he could, Draco cleared his throat and hoped his voice wouldn’t crack. “Welcome, witches and wizards of London. I am glad to see so many of you decided to participate in my Charity Auction. After the War, I had a hard time. I know what you’re thinking: I deserved it, the entire Malfoy family deserved it. Nonetheless, I felt wrecked, I thought I didn’t deserve to exit these walls again.” Draco inhaled slowly, trying to maintain his smile intact. “But it was a foolish thought. I understood that I needed to do something to change my situation and show you all I wanted to change, that… I
Harry nodded sharply; he saw that coming and he had prepared for this moment. It had been a long week. After the big Malfoys revelation, everyone at the Ministry had been gossiping and whispering.
Potter’s tone was coloured by a deep growl, the one he had whenever Draco flirted with someone else. His hot breath fanned against the shell of Draco’s ear, sending shivers down Draco’s spine, and he had to close his eyes against the sheer
Draco closed his eyes again and nuzzled against Harry’s neck, rubbing his forehead there. “Mmh, it was so good. It was weird at the beginning, but then everything was dark and I could only
As everyone waved their goodbyes, Hermione called Potter over to tell him something private. As Potter bent down to listen to whatever Hermione was telling him, he glanced at Draco, smirking. Potter slid his tongue over his upper lip in a clear invitation to Draco.
Pansy shook her head. “It’s okay… Draco, I need to ask you something, but you have to promise me you won’t freak out.”
“Sure, I was just, um. I’ll see you at Potions, yes?” Without turning around, Harry reaches the Slytherin table as all the students’ eyes turn to him.
Harry entered the house with the warm trepidation that he learned to associate with Draco by now and as soon as he stepped foot in, Teddy ran in his arms, screaming with joy. “Harry! Dray surprise!!” pointing towards his room.
Draco raised a hand and cupped the nape of Harry’s neck, lightly caressing it. He leaned his forehead on Harry’s and bumped their noses together, whispering, “They did. They did fall in love, didn’t they?”
Draco clenched his jaw. Of course Potter didn’t know a thing about him, and why should he. Draco was only the most famous magi-zoologist of their century.
They hardly talked about that anymore. Harry knew Draco and Boo-boo had talked about it, Draco had tried to explain to Boo-boo about Voldemort and to calm him down after witnessing Harry’s parents’ death, but he couldn’t bring himself to think more about it.
This time Malfoy thrust in with two fingers and let go of Harry’s cock, sitting between his legs instead, caressing his thigh with his free hand, looking pleased down at him.
“You’re really getting into it, huh,” Malfoy whispered as he sat down, visibly more relaxed. Harry’s face was on fire as Malfoy drew in a deep breath. “Whatever. Point is, from what I’ve witnessed, the spell is meant to make someone a… a sex slave.”
Now, you push two fingers into Potter’s hole: he cries out; one hand flies to grasp your hair. His hole is so tight you almost come in your pants as his muscles spasm around your fingers.
They went to sleep without eating that night, lost in conversation about their love, about what they liked in each other, reminding each other how wonderful the other was. The last thing Harry remembered, before drifting off to sleep, was Draco murmuring into his ear how lucky he had been to meet Harry, to have him in his life, that he would never exchange this cursed life with another if it meant losing Harry.
