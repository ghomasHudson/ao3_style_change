Harry leaves the shop and breathes in the winter air as the constant tick and turn of the pocketwatch syncs with the drumming of his heart.
"I don't have anything in particular picked out to watch. I figured we could see if any of the programmes on the telly looked interesting."
, that…"
"Now let's see, what else can I pester you about instead?" Blaise mused. "You know, I couldn't help but notice when we were talking about our favourite trips earlier that you were suspiciously silent. Even Hermione mentioned going on holiday to Germany, boring as her idea of touring every museum in Berlin sounded."
it would happen, as Foley hadn't given her followers a specific timeline. It made preventing the attack an almost impossibility, as it was critical they not make any obvious moves that would let Foley's followers know they were on to them. They'd lose their chance at capturing the last of her people, and could possibly cause them to divert their attack to an entirely new location, one they couldn't manage as easily. They worked with hospital administration to shore up defenses and covertly reduce the number of patients and staff on site, but it
"Of course they have," Parvati said in an undertone to Harry. "They'd be mad to come to a country in the middle of a civil war."
"I'm just antsy I suppose," he continued. "The last week has been pretty quiet—that always makes me wary."
… there wasn't any avoiding it, what it all meant."
"Ahh, somebody's back I see," Draco said, his voice thick and slow as if he'd been napping. His hand slid down to Harry's arse, pulling him in so that Harry could rub his hardening cock against Draco's hip.
"Here and there." Malfoy's tone is evasive. "It's a long story."
Harry's eyes widened. It was obvious Draco had given this a lot of thought, certainly more than Harry had, even though it felt like Harry'd thought of little else the past few weeks. It was overwhelming, all the possibilities, but that was why he had Draco. Draco, who would take care of everything, who'd figure out what Harry needed and give it to him. He shivered.
Aesthetically, he understood the appeal, but Harry wasn't generally attracted to older men, and he'd never been all that keen on blokes who were massively bigger than him, either. When he went for men, it was for somebody like Draco—long and lean, with interesting features—and he'd never been drawn to anyone more than a few years older than himself. Technically, Draco
"All right, Sean," Harry said to the boy, who was crying and hiccuping as he clung to his sister. "I need you to keep your eyes closed for me, okay? So the smoke doesn't sting them." Harry's eyes were already watering, and there were gritty tear tracks sliding down Cara's sooty cheeks. Sean looked to his big sister and she nodded encouragingly. He screwed his eyes shut and buried his face against her shoulder. A lump formed in Harry's throat and he looked away.
He Summoned them as soon as he sat down to eat; the curiosity was killing him.
Parvati put a hand on Fathi's arm, and he looked down at her. Harry couldn't understand the look in her eyes, the devastation, the helplessness, the weary acceptance. But he
"Draco, relax, I didn't tell them! Just because I'm more comfortable with everything doesn't mean I want to shout it out from the rooftops. It's still… private."
"Yes, alright," Malfoy replies, clearly flustered as Harry turns to the door, still grinning.
"Not pissed," Harry murmured against Draco's lips, his fingers tugging at Draco's trousers.
The entire world went still and quiet for what felt like a small eternity before exploding like a supernova as Harry came in his pants. Draco eyes went wide and he muttered, "
"Yes, looks like a fractured ulna. It's a clean break, so I should be able to mend it without too much time or difficulty."
The door at the end of the hallway was open just a crack, enough so that Harry could hear the low rumble of Graham's voice, followed by a higher, softer lilt. A few moments later, Graham emerged and gave them a small smile.
Harry moaned his assent, wriggling beneath Draco, arching as best he could in encouragement.
"What's it this time?" Harry asked, glancing over at Seamus who was waving his wand a little
All the fight rushed out of Harry.
"Ready?" Draco asked with a quirk of his brow.
Draco hummed thoughtfully, wriggling beneath Harry as his large hands slid down Harry's back to squeeze his bum.
"I assume you've heard of kink and BDSM?"
than fine before they left for the pub when Harry had blown him in the shower. But as the evening wore on, and talk turned more and more towards what was happening in Ireland, Draco had grown more quiet. Then again, he was never particularly boisterous and he always appeared more shy than he truly was whenever he was around Harry's rowdy group of friends, preferring to observe the chaos rather than jump into the fray. Harry was grateful that most of his mates had made a genuine effort to get to know Draco and include him in conversation, but he understood why they weren't all quite as comfortable together as Harry wished they'd be.
was what I discovered… I was terrified that there was something wrong and broken about me. That it was proof I really was bad and dark, given the kinds of stuff I fantasised about doing with a lover. It took a long time before I became truly comfortable with it, before I reached a point where I trusted myself enough to differentiate between my desire for consensual play and the kinds of atrocities I witnessed during the war."
next to praise kink,
"You don't see me as some kind of parent-figure, do you?" he asked in a low, smoky tone.
to help, even when it drained him, even when it brought back memories best left in the past and triggered night terrors that kept them both up. Draco, who Harry hadn't seen in so damn long, who Harry missed more than anything, like a piece of himself had been lopped off, leaving him aching and bereft.
"If we want to prevent this same thing from happening over and over again, here or abroad," Draco continued, his face flushed with the force of his conviction, "Then we need to change people's minds, we need to change who's in charge, and we need to restructure." He turned to Harry, his eyes blazing. "There is no shortage of things you could be doing to help make things better, especially with your level of fame and influence. People love you, they
This. This is what Harry had to remember when the itch to go out and blow shit up for the greater good got under his skin. The feeling of Draco in his arms, the taste of the lips, the way Draco made him feel strong and safe, protector and protected all at once. Draco was right; it was a miracle that they'd found each other, that they'd been able to work through all of their differences and grow into something so beautiful together. Harry didn't want to give it up, not for anything, and if that made them selfish, then at least they had one another for company.
"As far as I can tell, we've got control of all the entrances," Imogen said brusquely. "We have two dozen of Foley's followers in custody, and suspect another six are still at large inside. Gemma and Logan were tracking several of them on our end, and I know we've got others inside as well. Most of the patients and hospital staff have been evacuated, but there are still a few unaccounted for." She grimaced, her voice low and pained. "We miscalculated how big an attack this would be."
"Next time," Harry began, kneeling up and reaching behind himself to take hold of Draco's cock. "Next time you can finger me until I beg for it, but right now I really just want to get fucked."
Draco gave him a pleased look that made Harry's stomach flutter. "Such good instincts." He gestured to the sofa. "Why don't we sit and we can have a chat before jumping into things."
Harry grumbled but did as instructed. Draco stayed for a few moments, likely to ensure Harry followed his directions, before slipping out of the room. Harry left the scenery he and Draco had constructed but made sure all the loose figures were tucked away where they couldn't get stepped on and ruined, and then he made his way to the kitchen.
It looked like just about every Auror on staff was working the scene, and Harry scanned for Head Auror Robards, certain he'd have taken charge of such a high profile attack. Sure enough, he was not twenty yards away, barking orders at a pair of Junior Aurors, his face already lined with exhaustion and the heavy weight of responsibility.
Hard Limit (do not desire)
"Harry." It was just one word, but it was said in that same commanding voice Draco had used earlier, and before Harry had even realised it he had stopped, his hand stilled where it had been reaching for his robes.
"Can you fix it?" Harry asks anxiously as Malfoy peers down at the pocketwatch Arthur gave Harry five years ago. It was hit by a stray spell during yesterday's duel with an Auror Trainee, and though Harry was horrified at the potential loss of such a precious gift, it's provided him with the perfect excuse to check out Malfoy's new shop. After a lengthy and mysterious absence, Malfoy suddenly reappeared in Britain last month and opened a repair shop off Diagon Alley; Harry's been dying of curiosity ever since. Whatever Malfoy's been up to has clearly been good to him—he's fit as hell and Harry can't stop staring.
"Aren't you supposed to give injured people what they want?" Harry said. "Pretty sure you're supposed to spoil me rotten—helps with healing." Draco snorted, but Harry pressed on, "So if you really want to help me get better, you should be nice to me."
"Yeah, I don't think I was really conscious of it, but I guess I really wasn't thinking of you as the boy I knew at school, because Hogwarts wasn't something that was on my radar. You were just like… this person I trusted implicitly to take care of me and keep me safe. I didn't even have to think about it."
would be fine. He'd tease Harry for worrying and Harry would make him promise to be more careful, and they'd go out to dinner tomorrow like Harry planned. And when Harry asked him to marry him, Draco would say yes.
Harry had expected to perhaps find Emily in bed, resting after her ordeal. What he hadn't expected was to see the woman—who appeared to be close to Harry's age—sitting in the middle of the floor surrounded by baby dolls. She was wearing a frilly pink dress, much like the kind that Rose was always begging Ron and Hermione to buy for her, much to Hermione's consternation. Emily's hair was braided into two neat pigtails, a bright pink bow adorning the end of each plait. Harry blinked, looking instinctively over at Draco in confusion, who gave him another pointed stare.
"Maybe later," Draco replied. "As much as I love fucking your arse, right now I want you inside me. Want you to fuck me just like this."
"So do you," Draco replied as he pulled Harry down on top of him on their ridiculously comfortable mattress. He scratched his fingers along Harry's scalp in that way that always made Harry's cock twitch while arching temptingly beneath him.
Fathi sighed, apparently giving up his brief attempt at tact and going for his usual direct approach instead. "The attack, it's on the local hospital."
"Story Spells are a kind of magic that's been woven into a particular story. The magical illustrator has created moving imagery that activates as the story is read aloud."
"Okay, so maybe I'm not the only one with these fantasies, and maybe I'm not the only one who's struggled with feeling ashamed, but…" Harry trailed off, flushing. True, that was the biggest hurdle he had been trying to overcome, but it wasn't
"You're important to me too," Harry said softly, moving in close to brush a kiss against Draco's lips. Harry knew how much Draco liked control, and for somebody like him it would be incredibly frustrating knowing that Ron and Hermione's feelings about him, and how the night went, was more or less out of his hands. So Harry reminded Draco of what he
Draco grabbed his wand with his free hand and whispered a spell Harry didn't recognise. For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, and then Harry gasped as sparkling light began to pour from the pages of the book that Draco had Levitated in front of him. He looked down at Harry, seeming to realise Harry hadn't ever seen anything like this before.
Harry blinked. "You did?"
Harry blinked, feeling awkward and overwhelmed. Given his and Draco's decision to take their relationship as slow as treacle, they had been pretty actively
Somewhere between the heady euphoria of the chase, the goals, the whoops, cheers, and the adrenaline spike of the final catch, it occurred to Harry there were better ways for he and Draco to tackle their post-match energy than verbal sparring. It was fair to say it hit him, well, like a Bludger to the head.
"I love them!" Harry agreed, bounding over to Draco and plopping himself in Draco's lap, snuggling in for a hug. As much as Harry craved touch and affection, he wasn't great at initiating it after a childhood that had taught him it would only be met with rejection. But something about wearing these clothes, about having Draco care for him, stripped away all those barriers. He didn't think twice of physically showing his appreciation for what Draco had given to him, and Draco tugged him close, ruffling a hand through his messy hair.
"Are those… colouring books?"
. I've got the skills for it, and it feels selfish not to put them to use. But maybe you're right, maybe doing something else to help out here will make me feel better."
Draco's eyes widened momentarily before he shoved a truly gigantic chip into his mouth. He hummed questioningly, as if he hadn't quite heard Harry the first time. A little flag popped up in the back of Harry's mind and he narrowed his eyes. Draco was stalling.
There were two place settings on the table, and it was no mystery whose was whose. Draco's meal was set on fine china and looked to be some kind of roast meat with sprouts and potatoes. Harry's meal, on the other hand, appeared to be alphabet soup, presented in a bright-red bowl clearly meant for children with a matching spoon and plastic cup. Harry's stomach growled, reminding him that he actually
Harry shuddered so violently that there was no way Draco could have missed it. His smile turned indulgent, generous.
robes on over his pyjamas. "I don't know the specifics, but Byrne Apparated in for a private debrief a little over an hour ago."
They were still in their Quidditch leathers, hidden beneath the stands as the Snitch fluttered in Draco's clenched fist and Harry kissed Draco breathless. It was only a charity match, but that didn't diminish the sweetness of Draco's win against Harry as he brought the St Mungo's team to victory.
, something he and Draco were still navigating, still deciding if it was worth the risk. Some might even think they were being overly cautious—which wasn't something Harry was often accused of—but he knew once they crossed that line, it'd be too late to take it back, and Harry felt they were more than justified in worrying that a relationship between them would be doomed to implode.
"It does. But I wasn't sure if it would be something you liked or not. The clothes will last a couple of uses before beginning to fray. If this ends up being something you'd like to do with any kind of regularity, we can look into getting you something custom-made. Maybe even lots of somethings, a whole wardrobe if you'd like."
"Merlin, Potter, did you get yourself cursed!?"
"Yeah, okay," Harry said, somewhat dismissively, not sure he entirely agreed. Besides, he had more pressing matters on his mind. "But I definitely
, but emotionally… it feels like one more thing that makes me different and weird. I'm so tired of feeling like a freak."
"You telling tales on me, mate?" Seamus asked Ron as he made his way back to the table. "Ah, Harry, just the man I wanted to talk to."
Harry's cheeks flushed. They'd never been so direct with one another about their feelings before, and though he'd never really doubted Draco's affection for him, it was still nice to hear.
photos. They'd been lovely, filling him with a hungry yearning, but he couldn't help but notice that they all seemed to share a certain similar aesthetic, one that didn't quite hit the right note for Harry. All the boys were slender and doe-eyed; all their Daddies were buffer and bigger in stature and generally quite noticeably older. It made sense; the physical appearance of the Daddies and their boys was such a fitting representation of the dynamic. When Harry looked at the photos of the various couples together, he could
"I understand that, I do, Harry—you know how important it's been for me to choose the right side of the war this time around, and if going over and fighting had been the only way for me to do that, I'd be there right now." He scrunched his nose and gnawed on his lip, a sure sign he was thinking something out. "Maybe we can try and find other ways for you to get involved that would feel more productive and tangible but don't require you being out on the front lines." He hesitated. "You know, my expertise would be valued just as much in a war zone…" Harry winced at the thought of Draco going over there, putting himself at
, and Draco gave him a significant look. "Exactly. It's dangerous. If you feel you need to go, then maybe we could look into going together." It was clear he wasn't thrilled about the idea and frankly, neither was Harry. He couldn't stand the thought of Draco putting himself directly in harm's way, and his expression must have said so, because Draco gave him a look that very clearly said,
"Okay," Harry said. He still felt a little kernel of anxiety about doing it all wrong, but he tried to ignore it and focus on Draco. His words made sense, but it definitely sounded easier said than done. "I can try."
"Hey, so I think I'm gonna head home," Harry said in his best attempt at casualness as he walked into Draco's living room.
"I wasn't telling you because it bothered me," Draco said, his voice lower and rougher than before. He gave a gentle thrust into Harry's mouth, and though Harry's face was still burning, he resumed sucking, looking helplessly up at Draco, desperately turned on and slightly ashamed at the same time.
"I'm not stalking you!" Harry protested, perhaps a little too emphatically judging by Malfoy's dubiously raised eyebrows. "It's not my fault I've got a dangerous profession."
"Go on, then," he said indulgently. "Let's get this set up."
Finally the room was full. Every chair at the table was taken, and those that had come in too late to snag one were crowded up against the walls, their faces hungry with anticipation. Fathi cleared his throat, and the room went deathly silent.
"Go for it."
Draco's jaw clenched and he ran a hand through his hair as he swore softly. "I figured. I should apologise. Clearly I pushed you before you were ready, and I shouldn't have let you leave when you were so obviously upset afterwards."
"What?"
Harry's eyes grew wide. That… had not been what Harry was expecting. Or, well, maybe that wasn't entirely accurate, because something about the way Emily and her fiancé had interacted had struck a strange chord within Harry. It hadn't felt precisely sexual the way he thought kink was supposed to be, but Draco throwing out that term wasn't quite as shocking as he would've thought. Still, hearing Draco—the bloke he was kind-of-maybe dating—saying things like
without a hitch anyway.
While Foley's guard was distracted by the rest of the resistance, Harry focused in on her, channelling all his fury, all his rage, as he cast spell after spell against the protected barrier that was shimmering around her. It was strong, but Harry was stronger, and he could sense the barrier weakening as he hit it with every spell, hex, and curse in the book. Eventually, Foley couldn't ignore him any longer, and she abandoned the crystal goblet she'd been attempting to turn into a Portkey—even her Portkeys were pretentious, no shock there—and whirled on him, her eyes flashing fire.
Harry grinned against Draco's lips, feeling warmly content, a spark of hope and excitement for tomorrow flickering inside him.
"I insist on it," Draco replied with a grin.
, he wanted that, and preferably sooner rather than later, before he came all over Draco's hand.
"Err…" Harry was, as ever, eloquent in all situations. Though, to be fair, he wasn't sure there was an eloquent way to ask somebody if they were freaked out by your
"No—Nothing," she said with a hiccup, dashing her tears away with the back of her hand and straightening her spine. "It's the stress, that’s all. It's getting to me. But we're almost finished."
Draco smouldered at him and Harry swallowed heavily as Draco clarified, "No sex while we're doing an ageplay scene. Outside of that, however…"
apologies, Harry."
"We also—" Draco broke off and took a deep breath. "I know I keep harping on this, but I feel like I need to make it clear"—he gave Harry a rather severe look—"
Harry winced. "Oh god."
"Of course, I absolutely understand," Draco said, sincere and empathetic. Harry stared at him, entirely lost, as Graham turned and walked up the stairs. Draco made a move to follow, but Harry grabbed hold of his robes and held him back.
"I'm sorry, I really must be going," Malfoy said, turning to leave the room.
He's not sure why he's so invested in Malfoy. They've hardly spoken since the trials. Maybe Harry's got him all wrong, but if Malfoy really is changing, if he wants to make amends and try to do some good in the world, Harry thinks he should get that chance.
They settled down, Harry on the sofa and Draco on the adjacent loveseat. He looked just as gorgeously put together as he always did, and as desperately as Harry wanted to touch, he figured it was smart to keep their distance. It would be all too easy to get distracted, and they really did need to talk.
Work taken care of, Harry had spent ten minutes haphazardly throwing clothes and toiletries into a travel bag before sending off the final letter he'd written. He'd been purposefully vague, telling Draco that he was going away for a while to have some space to think, and that he'd be in touch soon. Harry knew Draco would be worried and concerned when he read it, and Harry felt bad about causing him any distress, but he just couldn't bear to face Draco quite yet. So he'd sent off Apocrypha with the letter and then immediately activated Blaise's Portkey; knowing Draco, he'd immediately Apparate to Harry's place the moment he got the letter, which meant Harry wanted to be long gone by then.
The look Harry had on his face must have reflected his doubt, because Draco huffed out a small, amused sound before continuing. "For example, you listed orgasm delay and denial as something you might be interested in, as well as spanking. In both of those instances I could push you far enough that you'd beg me to stop without actually meaning it. I don't plan to start out with anything quite like that for today, but while our scenes might not be physically strenuous, right now or possibly ever, we don't quite know how it'll affect you emotionally." He hesitated. "This kind of arrangement can be extremely taxing emotionally, and sometimes the smallest thing can end up pushing us past our limits in ways we never anticipated. If something gets to be too much for you to handle, I want you to use your safeword and put an immediate stop to it.
This answer seemed to satisfy, and Harry saw many people around the room beginning to share in his own excitement. Parvati seemed similarly enthused, though it was clear her hope was tempered with caution.
He'd been worried that thoughts of what might be on those tantalising lists would consume his day, but he had a literal roomful of invoices to comb through for his and Sue Li's latest case which required close reading; it was the first time he'd ever been grateful for such a mind-numbing task. By the end of the day, Harry didn't even want so much as to
Draco craned his neck to look down at his watch. "Just after seven."
, but that time would come later. After. When Harry wasn't so laser-focused on getting Draco's dick in him as soon as humanly possible.
"Good, then let's go to my spare bedroom, I've got a gift for you."
"Oh," Draco replied, his expression relieved. "All right then." He paused before continuing, his words faux casual. "Which book would you like?"
"Hot stuff?" Harry asked with a snort, though he didn't let that deter him from starting to ease back onto Draco's dick, relishing the stretch. Godric, but it had been far too long since he'd had this, and that it was
, purposefully targeting the injured and sick, innocents that were the most vulnerable and least likely to fight back and protect themselves, and the dedicated witches and wizards who cared for them. It was horrifying, and they had to pay for what they'd done. For what they'd taken from him.
Draco's jaw tightened as he began stripping off his robes. "But you didn't tell me Parvati had officially decided to volunteer to go over to Ireland. And don't think I missed how jealous you were when she said she'd finished the last of the paperwork and would be leaving soon."
One of Malfoy's eyebrows rose as he took in Harry's mussed bedsheets and the pile of laundry on the armchair in the corner. Harry knew he shouldn't have put off cleaning yesterday. He hastily kicked a used pair of pants under the bed, as if that would suddenly make the room appear like less of a disaster.
Harry swore he could feel Draco's smile pressed against his throat.
That wasn't necessarily a bad thing—it meant there were enough bodies around so as not to alert Foley's followers that the resistance knew their plans, but that didn't make any of them feel any better about it. Harry in particular felt like he was crawling out of his skin knowing that they were using innocent people as bait. All he could think about was what would happen if any of them should die, and how their families would feel if they found out that the resistance had known about the attack and had decided their loved ones' lives were worth the sacrifice. Harry was no stranger to the tough choices one sometimes had to make in war, but it didn't make that bitter pill any easier to swallow.
Harry's brow furrowed as he thought about all the things he'd read through online. He understood the importance of a safeword for traditional BDSM relationships, but he didn't think it really applied to what they were doing. "Can't it just be no or stop? I'm not really interested in any kind of consent play."
"Yeah," Harry agreed grimly, a heavy dose of guilt joining in the riot of unpleasant emotions wreaking havoc on his insides. "Have we heard from Fathi in regards to the rescue attempt back at the Manor?"
As a dedicated (or reckless, if you listened to Hermione) Auror, Harry managed to find his way to St Mungo's just about once a week. It wasn't Harry's favourite part of the job, getting injured, but it had certainly become a whole lot more interesting once Malfoy had been assigned as his Healer a few months ago. Harry had lost track of Malfoy in the aftermath of the war, a fact that bothered him more than it should have. Though in all his vague wonderings of what Malfoy was up to, Harry had certainly never guessed that Malfoy was abroad training to become a Healer. The second Harry saw him again after all these years, his obsession had reignited with a passion. Malfoy being a Healer was so at odds with the selfish, cowardly teenager Harry had known him as, he couldn't help his fascination.
Harry paused on the doorstep, a bag of takeaway in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. Realising he'd need to free a hand to knock, he shifted the handle of the plastic takeaway bag from his left palm to around his wrist, then switched the bottle of wine from his right hand to his left. With his newly freed hand, he knocked on the door to Draco's flat, his heart racing. His hands were already damp with sweat, and he wiped the palm of his free hand on his trousers while gripping the slippery wine bottle harder with the other, praying the glass wouldn't slip loose and shatter on the ground. There had to be useful spells for exactly these kinds of situations, but bugger if Hogwarts had taught him anything so useful in everyday life as that. He'd have to ask Molly the next time he was at the Burrow—it seemed like the kind of practical spellwork she was particularly proficient at.
"I'd like to tell you something. Are you listening?"
thinking about it."
By the time he'd finished undressing, Draco was naked too, and Harry allowed himself a moment to look and admire. By now, Harry had grown familiar with the long lines of Draco's body, the pale skin over sinewy muscle, and the grace and power of his lean form. His cock rose proud and hard from a thatch of golden curls, and Harry's mouth watered from the memory of his taste even as his cheeks grew hot as he recalled what had happened the last time he'd been on his knees for Draco. He met Draco's eyes, which were dark and ravenous.
"Draco!" he finally managed to say around his dry throat. "What are you doing here? How did you find me?"
"Is that what you want?" Harry murmured into Draco's skin. "Want to fuck me?"
about the possibility, it was clearly the kind of thing that could easily blow up in both of their faces. It was only natural to be curious after what he'd witnessed between Emily and Graham. With Draco's subsequent confession, it wasn't exactly a leap that Harry might start to wonder and fantasise. It didn't mean that Harry wanted any of that for real, it just meant he had a healthy imagination and a natural inquisitiveness—a trait that had got him into all kinds of trouble in the not-so-distant past. Just because he'd thought about it, it didn't mean he really wanted it, or that he needed to make those curious thoughts a reality.
But Draco, for all that he'd worked hard over the years to become a better person, was an imperfect guide, more inclined to see the world in shades of gray than Harry was. The Draco in his head had no problems with taking Foley out before she could hurt another soul, had no qualms with Harry playing jury, judge, and executioner. Harry might have had a problem with it, once, but things were different now, and the rage inside him was relentless and all-consuming, urging him to end this once and for all.
, but Malfoy—
Malfoy scowled and looked down at the chart in his hand. He was clearly in the middle of a busy shift, his blond hair slightly messy and his cheeks rosy as he read over the admittance form he obviously hadn't had a chance to look over before coming in. If he had, then he wouldn't have been so surprised. Then again, if he had, he might have tried to pass off the case to a fellow Healer, which would have been a waste of a perfectly good broken arm/valid excuse to see Malfoy.
Draco shot him a scathing look. "You possess many talents, Harry, but an eye for style isn't one of them, so you'll forgive me if I don't rely on your discerning judgement when it comes to the appropriateness of my attire."
wouldn't fly with Robards as a valid excuse for showing up late to work. Of course,
"Was that a yes to this Friday?" Harry shouted down the corridor after him, ignoring the curious stares of the patients and Healers walking down the halls.
"I'm so glad to hear that, Harry. You look brilliant in them."
He dipped his head towards Draco, tacitly acknowledging that Draco should indeed be taking point on this interview. Draco nodded before returning his focus to Emily and flashing her a wide smile that made Harry's knees go weak.
Harry nodded.
Draco takes Potter's hand, shakes it firmly and watches his long, confident strides until he disappears out of sight.
Harry's stomach fluttered with anticipation. "Do I still get to blow you?"
, Draco was good at giving head, taking all of Harry's not-inconsiderable-length down in one easy motion. Harry gasped, overcome with the white-hot pleasure of Draco's mouth sliding up and down his shaft, so tight and slick. He wasn't sure if he'd ever seen anything so hot as Draco's lips spread wide around his dick while he ruthlessly reduced Harry to a whining, desperate mess. All too soon Harry felt his orgasm well up within him, brought forth fast and wild by Draco's skilled sucking. Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd had such an enthusiastic blowjob, and the fact that it was
? Because Harry was pretty sure that was a no for him, both giving and receiving. In fact, Harry Summoned a quill and marked down
The silence between them was strangely comfortable. Harry hadn't ever been all that keen on small talk, and it seemed Draco wasn't either, the both of them content in one another's company without the need to fill the air with nervous chatter. Just being near Draco filled Harry with a buzzing warmth, his heart leaping every time their fingertips brushed, which was frequent enough to make Harry suspect he wasn't the only one looking forward to each 'accidental' touch.
could survive it, but it's already hard enough with you being an Auror, every day wondering if the next time you show up at St Mungo's it'll be for something we can't fix…" He trailed off, pressing his lips together and looking away as he blinked furiously. When he continued, his voice was rough. "Having you go off into a war zone in another country… maybe it makes me an awful person, but I just don't think I can live with that kind of fear and uncertainty. I… I don't want that kind of life for myself, and I don't want to pretend that I could deal with it just to make you happy."
"Blaise," Draco confirmed. "He knew I was seeing somebody new, though I'd not told him who—I know we'd discussed keeping things private for now. But apparently he'd put two and two together. I hope you won't be too hard on him about telling me where you were—he's quite loyal and wouldn't normally be the type to divulge a friend's secrets, but I'm not the only one who was concerned by your sudden and out-of-character departure."
"Okay, I see your point. How about… Hallows."
The moment they entered the sleek and surprisingly modern kitchen, Draco was waving his wand once more, sending various dishes, wine glasses, and cutlery flying through the air with practised ease. It surprised Harry. Not so much that Draco would have such casual mastery of his magic—he'd grown up with it after all—but that he'd have such delicate precision with household charms, which Harry knew from experience were annoyingly finicky. Harry figured the house-elves would have managed all of that for Draco growing up, and that he wouldn't have had occasion to learn them as a child—same as Harry, though obviously for very different reasons. Then again, Draco had been on his own for years, cut off from his family and from most of the wealth and privilege he'd been so accustomed to throughout his childhood. Harry supposed Draco had plenty of reasons to become proficient at household spells since the end of the war, particularly if he wanted to avoid having to wash and clean things the Muggle way.
Ron was standing in the doorway, his freckles standing out like drops of blood against his unnaturally pale face. His fearful expression made Harry's heart momentarily stop. Ron was panting, like he'd run all the way here from the Floos, and his eyes were wide with shock.
Harry made himself pause and truly think about it.
After what felt like an eternity but was probably less than ten seconds, the front door swung open to reveal Draco, his hair and skin seeming to glow, backlit with the light from his flat that spilled out around him onto the darkened doorstep. It hadn't even been an hour since Harry had last seen him; Draco had stopped by his desk before he left for the weekend to confirm they were still on for their date that night. Their date at
Parvati nodded slowly. "Fair enough. I'm just worried about you, that's all. With everything that's happened…" She trailed off and took another sip of tea, then tried again. "I know it's been hard, but I'm proud of you. Draco would be, too."
Reaching for the crayons, Harry opened up the book to the first page—the outline of a phoenix—and began to colour.
than liked Draco, and though Harry was pretty sure it was too soon for that other L-word, he thought it probably wasn't far off with the way things were going.
each other on a deeply fundamental level that Harry hadn't experienced with anybody other than Ron and Hermione. And even then, there were things Draco knew about Harry that even his best mates weren't privy to. Harry had let Draco inside in a way he'd never done with anybody else before, and he trusted Draco with those most secret, shameful parts of himself, something Harry didn't do lightly. He liked Draco, he
Not too late, then. He snuck a glance at Draco, who was sprawled casually across the sofa, the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows and exposing his pale and shapely forearms. A throb of arousal pulsed through Harry. They weren't having sex during their scenes, but surely they'd finished for the day, right? There was still plenty of time left for a different kind of fun. Harry had never felt so relaxed, his mind calm and quiet for the first time in ages.
(and definitely not a
"Harry!"
Wow, did that statement make Harry feel all kinds of things. He wasn't really surprised that Draco was the type to want to spoil Harry, to give him the very best of everything, but what
Harry couldn't let that happen.
"Yeah, but it's of concern to

Draco was waiting for him on the other side, pausing mid-stride as if he'd been pacing when Harry stumbled through the fireplace. Harry gave him a somewhat awkward smile. What was the protocol here? Should he act like this was just a regular date? Would they jump right in?
a child. Normally he'd temper his excitement, but wasn't the whole point of this thing with Draco that he didn't have to tamp down his childish impulses?
Harry ignored the slight—for one, Malfoy wasn't wrong, and for two, pissing him off right now wouldn't get Harry what he wanted, as delightful as it was to rile him up. Instead, Harry blinked slowly up at Malfoy—not hard, considering he was still feeling a bit faint from blood loss and the blinking took a worrying amount of effort—and gave Malfoy what he hoped was his most pleading and beguiling stare. Malfoy went still and looked at him with wide, shocked eyes, which Harry took to mean he was suitably bewitched—either that, or Harry had missed the mark entirely and Draco was actually wondering if Harry was suffering from gastro-intestinal distress. Not wanting to give Malfoy an opportunity to breathe life into that particularly unsexy possibility, Harry said, "In that case, why don't you take me back to my place and heal me up yourself? I bet you're just as good as whatever Trainee Healer they'll assign to me, and this way we can both avoid the hassle of St Mungo's."
Now, confronted with the man he hadn't been able to stop thinking about all week and listening as Draco tried to talk him through his anxiety spiral, Harry finally felt strong enough to go after what he wanted. He didn't want to lose Draco, and he didn't want to lose that peace he'd found with him either, even if it was unconventional. Maybe a lot of people wouldn't understand it—maybe
The wards in front of him shimmered and nine figures suddenly appeared at the edge of the forest, like a mirage solidifying. Unlike the resistance members, who were dressed in black to better blend in with the night foliage, Foley and her followers were clad in the rich jewel tones they'd become known for—Foley, it seemed, had a fondness for colour. In Harry's experience, that was somewhat of an oddity amongst Dark Lords, but at least it made it easier to differentiate the enemy from their own at a glance.
Draco held up a hand that Harry hadn't even realised he'd been clutching tightly. "Something tells me we're not quite done cuddling for the evening." He smiled to let Harry know he didn't mind. "Every sub is different, and I'm not entirely certain what your aftercare needs are after dropping into littlespace as opposed to subspace, so communication is key. We'll talk some more after you change, okay?"
Harry opened his mouth to interrupt, but Draco barrelled on, "And that's not
Harry's eyes went wide. So many options! He'd not even thought about the fact that magical toys and games would be different from Muggle ones. Harry wanted to try them all, but he had no idea where to start. He gnawed on his lip and looked pleadingly at Draco.
Draco only seemed somewhat mollified by this, and Harry could tell he was working himself up into a lather. Harry needed to stop his anxiety spiral before it got out of control. He wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and leaned in to whisper in his ear.
"Not you, too," Harry said with a groan. He wasn't sure what had started it, but lately his mates—Ron and Hermione in particular—had been on him to go on holiday. True, the only time off he'd taken since he started the Aurors had been when Ron and Hermione had got married several years ago, but he
"No! I mean, of course there's nothing wrong with it. If you want to tell them you absolutely should, it's just, oh
It was almost like an out of body experience, some separate, cooly analytical part of his mind noting that Imogen had miscalculated how many baddies were still loose, because Harry had not counted on a seventh wizard popping into the fight. There was a shouted "
"Now," Harry said, stepping closer until their chests were flush, "I want to be with you. I want this to be real, to tell our friends, and file paperwork with the Ministry's Wix Resources. I want to keep going on date nights, and I want to keep exploring kink the way we have been, though I can't promise I won't freak out again."
"Do you like it?" Draco asked, a touch of uncertainty in his voice.
It was all going to be all right.
"But it
Harry rummaged around in his jeans pockets until he found an old sweet wrapper, which he offered to Malfoy, mostly just to see the look of abject disgust on his face at being offered what was ostensibly rubbish.
"We know, Harry." There was such finality there, the kind of positive surety Harry knew Robards wouldn't dole out lightly.
They were sat next to each other at a large table that was crowded around with various members of the Irish Magical Resistance. He and Parvati were in Ireland on loan from the Auror Department in London, both of them having volunteered to help fight against Dark Lady Foley who'd been wreaking havoc in the country for years, and who had recently overthrown the Irish Ministry. It was a different time, a different place, with different people, but looking around this table always filled Harry with a pang as he recalled the Order meetings at Grimmauld Place. It felt like a lifetime ago, though it had only been seven years since the end of that war. Being an adult at the table now, it was hard not to cringe as he remembered how difficult he'd been back then, filled with the righteous anger only a teenager could truly manage. He now knew from experience that these strategy sessions were not nearly as exciting as he'd imagined them to be back when he'd been barred from attending them.
They materialised at the Apparition Point in Chelsea, right at the edge of the wizarding street that ran parallel to King's Road. The sweet smell of pancakes wafted in from the next street, reminding Harry that it was nearly time for lunch. Perhaps he and Draco could grab a bite once they'd finished with their interview. Not like a date, or anything—they were still on the clock after all—but just a nice, platonic luncheon between colleagues. Of course, Harry wouldn't exactly be opposed to another date, if that was on the table, but it hadn't even been twenty-four hours since the last one and Harry didn't want to seem overly keen, especially given that he was still trying to detangle the mess that was his feelings for Draco.
Malfoy's lips twitched as he arranged his expression into something suitably disappointed. "Oh, I'm
"Do you want to meet there, or shall we Side-Along?"
"Can't believe it's almost over," Harry said, blowing on the steaming tea.
," Harry moaned, changing course at the last moment, pretending he didn't realise what he'd almost said when his guard had been so lowered.
"I also have the names of a few kink-friendly Mind Healers, if that's something you'd be interested in pursuing," Draco continued a bit more hesitantly. "I should have realised sooner that you'd need more than just my help, especially considering how desperately I relied on my Mind Healer and the kink community when I was first starting out."
"That was horrible." A small smile tugs at the corner of Malfoy's mouth, his eyes dark as he studies Harry's. "I'm working."
It's distracting enough that a suspect gets the drop on him, unleashing a dozen Cornish Pixies and escaping while Harry tries to remember how on earth they managed to trap them in second-year. He's unsuccessful, and spends the rest of the day figuring out how to explain he lost their suspect in a way that won't get him laughed out of the department.
"I'm working the attack," Harry said. It wasn't a question. His voice sounded strange, deadly calm when inside he was a chaotic storm of emotion.
, watched over her? Harry's stomach flipped and he shifted in his seat.
-Draco
"Ahh, I've been thinking," Draco began, his hips twitching as Harry suckled at the head of his cock the way Harry knew he liked it. "I'd like to try something. From your lists, if that's all right? You can say no. Or safeword out if we try it and you don't like it."
. Somewhere along the way Harry had forgiven Draco. He'd not forgotten. He wasn't sweeping that ugliness under the rug and pretending it hadn't ever occurred, that Draco had always been the man he was now, the one Harry cared about so deeply. But Harry was no longer carrying that blame and anger towards Draco around in his heart. He'd seen how Draco had changed, and he had reached an understanding of the man Draco had become. They
With a heavy sigh, he trudged up the stairs towards the attic. It looked like Grimmauld Place was getting another scrub down.
"I don't give a damn what you think, Fathi, not in this." His voice was pure steel. "I'm going. You can't stop me. I wouldn't suggest you try."
"I've got the Adventures of Merlin enchanted action figures; some One, Two, Three, Arithmancy blocks; a My First Potions set; and a Charmed Child practice wand."
Draco groaned. "Salazar, you're awful. I can't believe they let you loose on the public with such horrible lines."
"What the hell was that?" he whispered. "You know our victim?"
Harry rolled his eyes, but some of the tension began to leach out of his muscles with the return of the familiar banter.
Harry nodded. He wasn't entirely sure what a Story Spell was, but cuddling on the sofa with Draco sounded nice. Harry followed him into the living room, crawling onto the sofa and waiting while Draco disappeared for a moment before returning with a children's book.
Harry bit his lip and nodded. "Yeah, I can do that. You're not the only one who struggles with talking about emotions and personal stuff, but I promise to work on it. I want to be better at it. I really mean it, you know. I was a git for running off without properly talking things over with you, and I've been a mess all week. Having you here is the first time I've felt like myself. I want to be with you, I want this to work."
He let out a sound which could only be categorised as a moan, far too tinged with desire to be mistaken for a groan of pain. Malfoy's gaze moved from Harry's now-healed side to his face, his pupils blown as he met Harry's stare. Harry saw with a sudden, dizzying rush, his own want reflected back at him. There was a moment of silence. Two. And then suddenly Malfoy was half in his lap and they were necking like teenagers, Malfoy's hands sliding through Harry's hair as Harry moaned into Malfoy's mouth.
Draco shook his head and spread his legs a bit wider so that Harry could settle more firmly between them.
"We'll talk later," Harry said firmly. He made his way towards the door.
Harry wasn't sure which possibility was worse.
"Do you not like it?" Draco asked, and Harry blinked at him, flushing when he realised he'd been lost in his thoughts.
"I know."
Harry's lips pulled into a smile, charmed and amused entirely against his will. "Normally I'd go for the savage route, but I got us a couple of different items to split, so I suppose we could make use of proper dishes, just this once."
"And how confident are we of Byrne's intel on the time and place? Given how critical that is to the success of the mission, I'd say we need to be pretty damn sure."
"Oh, right," Malfoy replied awkwardly. "Well, I have more patients to see. I trust you can find your way out?"
"I, erm, I like to feel it I guess? I mean, I still like a bit of prep, but I don't need much."
Harry couldn't help himself; he walked up to Draco and gave him a hard, passionate kiss. God, he was so in love with Draco he could hardly stand it. He was so smart, and courageous, and fucking
Of course, all of that was before last night.
Harry bristled. "We don't need both of us manning this entrance, and I'm one of the best offensive fighters we've got. Tell me it doesn't make sense for me to go in there. We both know there are innocents still inside, possibly being terrorised right this moment, and I can help stop it. I'm going in."
Harry swallowed heavily and sat. Draco took the seat opposite, his brow furrowing as he looked at Harry.
Draco didn't bother answering; he threaded his fingers through Harry's hair and pulled him in for a kiss.
Ron must have really been keen for his anniversary plans because he didn't even bristle at Malfoy's referring to Hermione as Granger instead of Granger-Weasley. He just flashed Malfoy a shockingly sunny smile before nodding at them both.
He didn't spend long taking things slowly or feeling Harry out—just a few gentle thrusts before he set up a deep, hard rhythm that had Harry's hands twisting in Draco's grip. He seemed to sense exactly how Harry wanted it, and Draco committed to delivering with his customary zeal. The pleasure didn't take long to build, growing and growing until it felt like Harry would burst. The fact that his movements were limited, pinned down as he was beneath Draco's body and with Draco's hands wrapped tight around his wrists, only made it all that much hotter. He'd had an occasional errant fantasy involving a bit of light bondage before, but it hadn't ever been an avenue he fully explored. Judging from the way he was reacting from just Draco's hands holding him down, Harry was
feel guilty. "It's not your fault. You're supposed to push me, and you didn't do anything I hadn't said I'd be interested in exploring. It just… I think it made it all a little too real. I never really allowed myself to think about what we were doing together, but when you said…
Fathi's jaw clenched in obvious annoyance and he gave a quick, sharp nod. "Yes. As you all know, Foley Manor is heavily warded. It's all but impenetrable, but those protections work both ways. She won't be able to arrange an International Portkey or Apparate out of the country from behind her wards, and given she doesn't want her absence from Ireland being made public, she won't be going through official Ministry channels, either."
." He winced and wiped his greasy fingers on his napkin, having finished with picking apart the rest of his fish into tiny flakes. "If it's not something you're interested in exploring, I don't want you to feel pressured. I've never been into any of the lifestyle stuff, and it's always been more of a bonus for me as opposed to something that's necessary."
Harry had been here for four days, and his thoughts were no clearer than they'd been when he'd left Britain. As soon as Harry got the letter from Blaise confirming that Harry could use his villa, he'd immediately sent off a missive to work requesting two weeks of leave. Robards had clearly been a bit annoyed at the lack of advanced notice, but he'd been unable to deny Harry's request, especially considering how much time off he had banked.
Harry opened his mouth to downplay the injury but Malfoy shot him a

because, well, Harry was too big around for just the one. Draco broke off the kiss to stare down at where he was wanking Harry off with both hands, clearly turned on. Harry was glad Draco didn't fall into the intimidated or jealous category, but given the way he was licking his lips, Harry braced himself for a change in their plans for the evening. It wouldn't be a hardship fucking Draco—far from it—even if it hadn't been what he'd been dreaming of over the past several months of foreplay.
Graham ran a hand through his hair, rumpling his perfect salt-and-pepper coiff. "We expected the Aurors would send somebody earlier, when we were still at St Mungo's." His tone wasn't exactly accusatory, but Harry felt chastened all the same. As understaffed as they were at the moment, they weren't able to respond as quickly as they should have in this situation.
to see it.
This was their shot, the only one they'd had in the six months since Harry came over to fight, and he'd be damned if he let Foley slip through their hands; who knew when they'd have another opportunity like this? She needed to pay, and Harry needed this unbearable war to end, needed to get back home to Draco. Draco, who had been stretched so thin for months and months before Harry had left, more than overworked between all his hours at St Mungo's and volunteering to provide medical care for the refugees from this godforsaken war. Draco who'd
older than him, even if it was by less than two months. That was something, Harry supposed, even if it didn't quite settle the discord in his chest. He was still trying to come to terms with the fact that this was something he wanted. Harry had finally had a chance to do some research, to maybe realise that he wasn't the only one who wanted this, that he wasn't so alone. Instead, he'd discovered that even in this area he was a freak. He didn't look like a little should look, and he didn't want the right kind of caretaker. The whole thing had left him confused and conflicted, feeling drawn to the dynamic but certain he was wanting it in all the wrong ways.
"That was lovely," Draco said with a pleased sigh. He flashed Harry a gratified grin. "You were perfect." He settled his hands on top of Harry's, which were still atop his knees. "You follow directions so well."
"You're close already," Draco said hoarsely, looking up at him, his silver eyes seeming to glow in the low lamplight. "I've never been with somebody so keen." The rough, awed tone of his voice made it clear that he liked Harry's eagerness very much, and Harry picked up the pace, crying out as Draco filled him again and again.
Harry blushed. He knew caretaker hadn't been the word Draco had been thinking. It filled him with a hot combo of want and shame, because he'd be lying if he said there hadn't been a few moments while he was under, where he'd wanted to call Draco by a different name. But that seemed like too much, too deviant, somehow. Draco had been nothing but wonderful and kind and game for anything throughout all of this, but he'd also admitted this hadn't ever been his usual kink. Harry didn't want to scare him off. Hell, Harry didn't want to scare
Normally, his first step when he had something to research was to enlist Hermione's help, but that was definitely not happening this time around. Just the thought of having to explain to Hermione what he was looking up and why made his cheeks flame and his stomach twist. It was bad enough Draco knew about Harry's strange desires; he absolutely didn't need anybody else finding out, especially not one of his best mates. Besides, this wasn't exactly the kind of research that he needed Hermione for anyway. Harry very much doubted the musty old tomes in the Grimmauld Place library had detailed information on full-grown wizards who liked pretending they were little kids.
Things felt different now that they were… something. Harry wasn't sure he was quite ready to call what they were doing dating, exactly, even though last night had most definitely been a date, the two of them sharing a nice meal together before Draco walked him home. It had been relatively chaste compared to some of the other first dates Harry had been on, but that goodnight kiss on Harry's doorstep had made Harry's stomach flutter and cramp with want, and it had taken all of Harry's willpower not to invite Draco inside for a 'nightcap'.
what it was like to have that, to have you
Harry got back from Berlin tired, but pleased. He'd accompanied Minister Shacklebolt as a member of his personal security for a meeting of several Heads of State in regards to the escalating situation in Ireland. Great Britain was already offering aid to the resistance on the ground that was trying to bring down Lady Foley, and they'd been taking refugees for months. Minister Shacklebolt was hoping to drum up support from other countries to help put an end to the madness and destruction. Guard-duty wasn't generally Harry's idea of a good time, but the topic of the Summit was one that was of particular interest to him, and there were worse people to spend time with than Kingsley. It was one more way for Harry to feel like he was doing his part to help the situation without actually fighting himself. He still felt the occasional pang when Parvati wrote him with updates from the war front, but for the most part Harry had made his peace with staying in England. He had a life here, one he wasn't eager to leave.
Far too soon Harry felt his orgasm peaking, the familiar tingling radiating out from his groin as the pleasure inside him reached a fever pitch. He wanted Draco to come first, so he braced himself by Draco's head with one arm and reached down between them with the other, taking Draco's hot, hard cock in hand. His shaft was soaked with precome, providing the perfect amount of slip as Harry gripped him hard and stripped him fast, just the way Draco liked it. Draco let out the familiar little hiccuping gasp he always made before he came and moments later he was spilling all over Harry's fist.
Draco's fair cheeks grew pink and he paused to take a large bite of fish, seeming to ponder as he chewed. "Yes, the Daddy thing. Traditional BDSM relationships generally involve at least one Dominant and one submissive partner. What that looks like can vary, but I'd say that Graham is pretty clearly a Daddy Dom, and Emily is his little girl. Those kinds of relationships are usually less focused on things like impact or sensory play—those whips and blindfolds you mentioned—and more about care and nurturing. Though, of course, there's an element of punishment when necessary."
"And who have you got with you, Cara?"
Harry understood that, too.
He missed Draco.
Harry grinned down at him. "Problem?"
look he could manage.
He took down one of the wizards before he had a chance to know what hit him and then moved on to the next, not holding anything back. Much like his duel with Foley, the spells Harry used weren't strictly sporting, but Harry was past caring about that. These people had attacked a
"Oh, all right," Draco snapped, seeming for all the world as if he was immensely put-upon by the request, though Harry didn't miss the slight easing of tension in his shoulders. A trip to St Mungo's wouldn't have been pleasant for either of them. "And what's your plan for getting us to your humble abode? I don't know where it is so I can't Apparate us, and you're in no position to do so either."
Harry's eyebrows rose. Maybe it
Fuck, they needed to do something, needed to make Foley talk so that all of this could
Draco frowned and looked away, reaching for the bottle of vinegar and dousing his chips with a surprising amount of vigour as he said shortly, "If you really thought that, we wouldn't be here right now."
No, if he wanted books on that kind of thing, he'd need to go somewhere a bit more modern. He knew Flourish & Blotts had a sexual wellness section—Luna had spent a very long pub night detailing the many helpful books she'd found there to spice things up in the bedroom with Rolf. Harry wasn't sure if the shop stocked books on his particular kink, but if they didn't have them on hand he could probably special order something. There was also the recent sex shop expansion of Weasley Wizard Wheezes, which was much more likely to actually have what he was looking for in stock. Both were decent enough options for the average wizard, but for Harry they were really only one step up from involving Hermione. Given his unfortunate level of fame, word of his perversions would no doubt show up tomorrow on the front page of the
"Come with me to the centre later today," Draco urged. "We can talk to Leslie about you volunteering. I don't want to seem like I don't get it, I do. But it's not selfish to want to live your life. You've earned it, Harry. More than anybody I know, you deserve to be happy."
"I've never really gone on holiday with anybody before, so I wouldn't know, but I can't say I've been enjoying myself all that much so far. Though I did have a lot on my mind."
Parvati winced, her expression bleak. Her sister was a massive
burn up the lists. He could tell Draco he'd changed his mind, that he didn't want to pursue any of it, and Draco would let him, he wouldn't push. The whole thing would fade into memory, a mere blip on the radar, and Harry would never have to face it.
"Not on purpose!" she cried out, her expression rumpled with guilt. "But you can't deny your magic has been a little… erratic since you came here. And when you were duelling Foley… you almost lost control. You wanted to kill her."
age them. He looked into the mirror and saw himself as he'd been at six, only instead of a too-large, threadbare shirt and a sad expression, he was wearing an excited grin and clothes that fit perfectly. Harry looked the way he imagined he might have if his parents hadn't died, if he'd had the chance to live out the childhood that was taken from him. But no, he didn't want to go down that path, not right now. Not when a boundless energy was welling up inside of him, urging him to run around and play, to throw his arms around Draco and thank him for the gift.
Harry can't stop thinking about Malfoy.
forgotten, tonight was supposed to be a date. Last I checked, playing with crayons and watching somebody act like a kid is the kind of thing I do with my godchildren, not with a boyfriend. "
there as a spy. If I were to rely solely on the information I've been told, I'd not be of much use to the resistance."
Byrne nodded eagerly. "She always is, though. And it's not just the greater wizarding world she doesn't want to know about her absence; she's not telling her followers, either. Only a dozen or so of her closest inner circle have been made aware, so we can expect a minimal guard."
, for takeaway and telly, which Harry was trying very hard not to read into, because they were taking things slow and not meant to be shagging on Draco's sofa, even if Harry really, really wanted to (and had worn his best pair of boxers, just in case).
Did he really desire that for himself?
"Never a dull moment with Seamus. But while everybody's distracted…" Harry gulped—that tone of voice never boded well, nor did the insinuating waggle of Blaise's eyebrows as he continued, "If you wanted to tell me more about this mystery person you've been seeing, I'm all ears."
"Arthur gave it to me." Harry carefully takes the watch and studies Malfoy. "Where did you go?"
(as one wizard who hadn't made it to a fourth date had put it) tended to be more of a net-negative than positive. It was always something. If it wasn't his partners feeling freaked out and intimidated by his sheer size, as if terrified that Harry's possessing a big cock meant he would be intent on forcing it upon them, then it was the men who seemed to take the size of Harry's dick as a personal affront to their own manhood and turned all pissy and competitive upon the reveal. Those that weren't immediately intimidated or emasculated seemed to view his dick with an almost avaricious gleam, keen to get dicked down by Harry, either because he was the Saviour or because a
," Harry said, waving off Ron's concern. "Fucker grazed me with a Severing Charm. I'll be right as rain as soon as I heal myself up."
"Yeah, you sounded really anti-climactic earlier." Harry rolled his eyes. He grinned at Draco and held out his hand. "What do you say to best of three?"
. The two of them fought well together, their magic syncing beautifully and their movements almost choreographed, each of them anticipating the other's moves. It made Harry sad and wistful, thinking of how in tune he and Draco had been the few times they'd gone to a duelling club together.
Ron snorted. "Mate, your Healing spells are shit. Go get yourself taken care of at St Mungo's, I'll get things wrapped-up here."
had done that. She'd taken Draco from him, she was the reason he was here, and now Harry was going to take all her power away from
"I'll think about it," Malfoy shouted back over his shoulder before disappearing around a corner.
Draco was still dressed in the dark trousers and crisp white button-up he'd been wearing earlier that day, but he'd ditched his shiny oxfords, leaving his feet bare but for a pair of midnight blue socks covered with fluttering white Abraxans which were most
giving it to him only made it all that hotter.
Draco smiled. "Excellent. To start, I want to leave sex out of our scenes, at least any of the ones that involve age regression. You said on your form that you're not quite sure if it's a sexual kind of release for you, so I want to leave that aspect off the table for the moment until you've had time to play and figure it out."
Draco moaned and seemed to lose himself for several moments, undulating his hips as his fingers carded through Harry's hair.
"And being with you makes me happy, so it's settled. No more talk of fucking off to Ireland without me, hmm?" Draco said, his tone light, though Harry could hear the thread of steel beneath it. But then Draco's face brightened as he grinned over at Harry. "If you want to travel so badly, we can go somewhere together. Somewhere where a war isn't being fought. Somewhere… tropical." His expression went dreamy. "Like Fiji. I've heard it's beautiful there. I've always wanted to go."
" and a jet of red-orange light, and Harry's heart skittered to a stop. For the briefest moment, there'd been a sense of relief—the hex had
Draco grinned at him, his proud expression making heat bloom in Harry's gut.
It looked like several of their defenses were holding up under the onslaught; a cluster of brightly-robed wizards blasted the silvery dome of protection surrounding the hospital in an attempt to weaken it. Judging from the screams coming from inside, and the smoke pouring from several open windows, something or someone had already made it in. Harry swore. This wouldn't be the first time Foley had used explosive charms and spells, sometimes even sacrificing her own people, in order to inflict maximum damage.
Sitting there, though, drinking his beer, surrounded by his friends and thinking of Draco, Harry realised it wasn't too far for
"He does," Parvati confirmed. "He's talking to Keating right now to get the go-ahead." Keating had been Deputy Minister before Foley had taken over. He'd gone on the run with Fathi and they'd been working together from the start. If Fathi was seeking Keating's approval, it meant his plan likely involved something of questionable legality for which Fathi would need executive approval and a promise of pardon.
"Ah, right." Harry struggled for a moment with his shirt, grateful he didn't have his bulky Auror robes to shrug out of since they'd been undercover when things had unexpectedly imploded. Then again, if he'd been wearing his Auror robes, with their woven-in protection charms, he probably wouldn't have been injured in the first place. Then again
Which he should be doing any moment now, if they didn't want to risk losing Foley entirely. Harry tensed, preparing himself to move. If Fathi didn't give the go ahead soon, Harry would take matters into his own hands. He was done waiting.
"I will. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear from you." He stood, giving Fathi a nod to indicate he was heading up to bed.
It was their third date and they were taking things slow—Draco's idea, of course, but Harry saw the merit in it, even if all he wanted to do right at that moment was drag Draco into bed. But when their first date—Indian takeaway in the St Mungo's cafeteria during one of Draco's brief shift breaks—went surprisingly well, and Harry realised these inconvenient feelings he had developed weren't going away, he quickly jumped on board with Draco's suggestion that they move slowly. Draco was still wary and skittish, unsure of Harry's intentions and if a relationship between them could ever work, and Harry didn't blame him. He was still coming to terms with the fact that his attraction to Draco was more than just physical desire, that he actually
The date had been a long time coming. Auror Training had been rocky at first, given all the history between them. But Draco had been dedicated and hard-working, and though Harry hadn't been all that swayed by his initial apology, seeing him actually strive to be a better person, to learn and grow…
Draco nodded. "We can head to her place of work if she's not in, but hopefully she was able to take the day off after a night like that."
"Tell me what's going on."
The letter was short. Draco suggested they meet that night to talk things over. He made it clear that it was fine if Harry thought it was too soon, but he believed it might be helpful if they had their discussion before the coming week, when they'd inevitably see one another at work. Harry fought off the instinctive urge to bury his head in the sand, acknowledging that Draco was probably right. He didn't need the distraction of their looming talk hanging over him while he was tracking down dangerous criminals and trying to fill out paperwork. Better to get it out of the way first.
The walls around them creaked and groaned ominously as they made it to a stairwell. Harry opened the metal door with a clang and ushered Cara and her brother through before taking the lead once more. The hospital was set onto a hill, so the entrance that Harry had come in through was technically three stories up. Harry already knew there was fighting there and he was hoping that the ground floor entrance might be less occupied—their battle plans had involved several members of the resistance taking that entrance as their primary task, and he had to pray they'd been successful.
