“Harry, practice is the best way to learn to fight off the Imperius Curse,” Granger says softly, gently, but Draco can already tell that tone won’t make Potter feel better. If anything, it will infuriate him more.
“I’m considering shaving both sides,” Eve says back, running her hand over the one buzzed side of her head. “Grow out my natural color a little more.”
Rather than answer her, however, Draco simply looks her dead in the eye, sets the headphones between them, and turns the volume all the way up so they can both hear the familiar song.
As lunch came and went Draco found himself in the garden again. Muddy wasn’t around, but Shadow came to say hello, his middle bulging with a mystery meal, and Snowflake let Draco scratch his head as he watered the plants.
He sighs, but he must enjoy pain because he takes out the CD and puts it into the player then slips the thin headphones onto his ears. Sure enough a very familiar, upbeat drum kicks up, shortly followed by clapping and some kind of fast-paced strings. Draco lowers his face into his palms and groans deeply.
He bites back the urge to snarl that he hadn’t apologized - because he hadn’t, and maybe he should, but he won’t - and instead says, “It is fine to be curious with me. I have not given you any reason to believe you couldn’t.” It was just… something about that book was making his skin crawl.
This time - and he’s genuinely not sure how he swung it - he manages to drag out Neville Longbottom.
“I do not claim to know what the hell that old geezer is doing, he’s clearly lost his mind and I deeply doubt his motivations, but something like this should not go unsaid. Despite what your previous years at Hogwarts have taught you, you’re not actually a martyr. You’re allowed to be selfish.”
Then it begins falling again and this time it doesn’t stop. Draco would scream but his voice gets caught in his throat as he sees the ground getting closer and closer, coming up to meet him and end his life with a splat. He doesn’t understand how this could have happened. He doesn’t understand what he could have done wrong. He hysterically begins pulling at the broom handle in a last-ditch effort to pull up, but it won’t work and he’s actually going to die. He’s going to hit the ground and die here and he doesn’t know why.
Draco had every intention of sharing his findings with the Golden Trio, they deserved to know, but what could they do with this knowledge? Dumbledore likely knew the prophecy, so maybe they could try to get answers from him?
He hurries to snatch Harry’s wand, then pulls out his own to point it at the Boy-Who-Lived as Umbridge surges forward and grabs his messy hair. With a vicious yank the woman pulls Harry out of the fireplace, sneering down at his wide eyes, and Draco feels a furious, protective snarl wanting to build in his chest. He stamps it down as Umbridge begins to speak.
“Higgs is a menace,” Draco growls as he jabs his fork into his lambchop, “He won’t leave Harry alone because he, and I quote, ‘Stole my rightful spot as Seeker, the half-breed cretin.’ Who says cretin anymore? I mean, really!”
There were a lot to choose from, Max filling up Draco’s life more than anyone else ever had. There’s all the times Max made Draco laugh, or Max taught him something new about Muggles, or Max ranted about nothing, or Max rambled about random facts…
“Who’s stupid and reckless?” Weasley questions as he and Granger finally trudge up to the two still sitting in the snow.
“Why can’t we teach them, then? That way no one will be in danger anymore,” Draco asks, voice quiet, a bad taste in the back of his mouth.
“Draco,” Fred suddenly hisses, nudging the blonde out of his thoughts, and he looks up at what must have jarred the Gryffindor. At first Draco doesn’t see any new issue. They’re still following Edgecombe and her weird wanderings. Except…
Draco feels his hackles rise, his mouth twisting into a sneer at the bushy-haired girl and her know-it-all voice, and he feels the word bubbling up. Mudblood. Mudblood. Mudblood. But he stomps it down along with his anger, taking a breath and instead turning to Potter, smirk back in place.
“Please do not,” Tracey replies calmly, like it is a normal request, and Theodore groans but doesn’t throw up. Small miracles.
“There’s our door,” Michael Corner hisses when they are finally close enough. Draco nods his furry head and gives a final, cursory look around, before urging the group forward. They have to pause for a moment outside the door, however, because apparently the only way into the tower is by answering a bloody riddle.
“Not that? Possibly? Was that too much to ask?” Draco sneers, turning to keep his eyes on the doors that they pass. He just wanted to find the damn Lung Dragon and be done with this little adventure already.
No matter what they did they wouldn’t be able to fix what had happened to Potter. Not what happened at the end of the Tournament, not what happened through most of his school years, not what happened throughout his entire life. It was clear something dark was building just beneath the surface, bubbling up when the silence lasts too long or they say the wrong thing.
“It happened again,” the quiet whisper left a young Draco Malfoy in a gust, frightened to break the calm silence of the front yard garden, the streetlights flicking on as the sun began to set and shadows stretched long like claws across the ground. The garden was small, pressed against the front porch and curving around the right side of the property, housing herbs and vegetables alike with a few flowers decorating the edges. It was freshly weeded, Draco’s doing. It was usually his responsibility to tend the gardens, even when his pale skin began to burn from the sun, namely due to his ability to deal with the natural residents.
“What…” Draco begins, trying desperately to withhold his screaming, and in doing so he falls back on a cold, harsh calm. “…in the nine circles of hell…” he slowly walks around Potter, hand brushing his shoulder, then moves to sit at the seat Eve’s mother vacated. His silver eyes are narrowed into furious slits as he stares down Potter, “…do you think you’re fucking doing?”
He wouldn’t lie and say he didn’t enjoy watching Mrs Nubble get scared by that owl, he just really wished he could talk to Hermione about it. This whole thing was beginning to feel like one of their events, but she had been unavailable for the last few days, apparently doing research on some boarding school she’d been accepted into. Draco hadn’t even known she’d been applying and he tried not to feel hurt.
“We’ll get back to you when we have the radios,” George says, also standing, and then both boys are turning and hurrying out of the library, whispering quickly to each other as they go.
She looks frustrated now, and a little betrayed, and now it is Draco’s turn to roll his eyes. “Ye of little faith. The focus on it being a claim was to make sure the Ministry allowed this to be published. What smart readers will note, however, is one: The Ministry has a member that is looser lipped than they would probably like. Something like that speaks poorly on the Ministry. Two: Potter did claim there were dementors, so what if it is true? Three: Snapping a wizard’s wand is a remarkably severe punishment to give for simple, underage magic. And four: Potter was found not guilty.”
“Well, obviously I want to communicate with Vince,” Draco begins and the shorter of the two boys smiles, seeming happier than Draco has ever seen him, “But I also was thinking… You know how I can see into the lake through the windows in Slytherin?” Hermione nods, eyes wide with intrigue, “Well, the other night I think I saw some kind of merperson! Obviously, we can’t hear each other, but what if I could teach them sign language?”
Then there’s Harry. Harry, who has been stressed out the entire year, but emotionally obliterated ever since the DA had been found. He and Draco hadn’t had as much time together as they would have liked, but it was clear Harry wasn’t doing all that well.
“I am pretty certain you are only succeeding in pissing yourself off, Scarhead,” Draco arches a brow.
Eventually, the DA dissipates, going back to their dorms and leaving the Golden Trio and Draco alone in the Room of Requirement.
With everyone’s long awaited Potions class finally taking place, Harry quickly becomes every first year’s best friend. He’s stopped in the Common Room before they can even make their way to breakfast, Sophie and Tracey demanding he tells them everything his mother will expect from them, and he flounders for a good while until Draco drags him away. Somewhere in the background he hears Millicent laugh at their expense and Theodore sneer something nasty about Lily.
So, for the most part, Draco’s first week at 12 Grimmauld Place is spent quietly researching the files, making notes in his own folder, and determining what is important and what is useless. Most of it, unfortunately, is useless.
The hat is removed from Draco’s head and he is greeted by a very interesting response. The green table is clapping, louder than with all the other students that had been sorted into them, a few of the older students whooping like the Gryffindor table had done.
“Professor,” the stern, elder woman corrects. McGonagall, Draco’s mind supplies as an afterthought, even though he has a hard time seeing her as anything but “crazy, stern lady.”
The two laugh at that, despite Max’s pain, before the Muggle sighs dramatically. “Did I ever tell you I’m super grateful you hung out with us that day? Mama and Papa think your parents must’ve been super worried, but they liked you being with us, too.”
The slap of a paper on the desk has Skeeter looking up, smiling innocently while Draco leans against the desk with a furious look on his face.
“Where did you get that?” Draco questions, stopping his climbing to look, wide-eyed at the vial. Carefully, like he’s not in control of his own fingers, he takes the vial away from Skeeter and looks at it more closely.
considered a dark art?” Potter leans in close again to get a look at the page, Draco spluttering and leaning away when some of his wild hair gets in his mouth.
McGonagall’s expression didn’t change at first, but her lips did thin. She looked particularly unhappy and Draco wondered if he had said the wrong thing. “How much do you know of your past?” she questions instead of answering and it makes the young boy angry. That wasn’t what he wanted to hear.
“Ooooh! Like how people used to think smart, imaginative women couldn’t give birth?” Max immediately perks up, energy finally entering their voice once more.
Draco moves forward, pressing his face to the glass of the window, trying to catch one final glimpse of the merman, but he can’t see anything. Only shadows of small fish as they move by.
Time seems to hold still for a moment as Draco sees his cousin falling back towards the arch and its black veil. He doesn’t know exactly what it all means, but he knows that if Sirius falls through it… he won’t ever be coming back. Magic is gathering on the other side of the room, great and powerful, but Draco thinks not even Dumbledore will be fast enough to save Sirius.
Sirius is told to call on Lupin, that they would be in charge of gathering up some kind of “old crowd,” which Draco can only assume must mean the Order of the Phoenix from the First Wizarding War. Then he talks to Snape in the most cryptic tone, saying, “You know what I must ask of you. If you are ready…” he takes a breath, “If you are prepared…”
“Don’t change the subject. If you’re not going to tell me, just say you won’t. Or you can’t. I’m risking my neck too, you know. The least you could do is show me some respect.”
“Well done, Johnson!” Draco calls, a smile growing on his face despite himself, and Gryffindor’s Quidditch Captain grins brightly. The rest of the students have quickly surrounded her, congratulating Angelina Johnson and asking how she’d done it.
“We have to find her,” Draco hisses, eyes darting around to make sure no one is looking at them. He’s thankful he doesn’t have to convince Harry, because the boy simply nods in agreement and they both use the crowd and chaos to slip away from the rest of their house.
They get the Quaffle close to the goals, but one of the Weasley twins throws off their rhythm with a well-aimed Bludger and, in a short struggle, the ball in back in Gryffindor’s possession.
Draco’s brows furrow, not quite liking the wording of that. His motive? That made it sound like he was committing a crime. Which, despite everything they’d gone through, was likely what Granger and Weasley thought Draco was doing.
He trips on his way to the ensuite but hardly cares, tumbling in and scrambling to the toilet before throwing up everything inside him. He retches violently, his whole body seizing, and tears begin streaming down his face.
They lapse into silence, animosity deteriorating into awkward contemplation. It appeared mutual confusion was a good way to diffuse a conflict.
“People will never understand them unless they allow themselves the chance to be proven wrong. Facts or no facts,” Tracey says, and she sounds kind of sad, too.
“Just wake me up next time,” Harry says, bumping Draco’s shoulder, “I’ll sit with you, no problem.” And so he does. They sit in the common room for a long while, lapsing into silence as Draco continues to write his letters. Eventually he moves on to writing out a few more theories for possible spells and when he begins drawing out a chart for his work he feels Harry slump beside him. A little readjusting later has Harry curled on his side on the couch, wrapped up in a soft blanket, his feet pressing against Draco’s hip as he continues to work.
So, when the beginning of fifth year comes around, the thestrals are no surprise to Draco. In fact, after having all summer to come to terms with them and even doing some research on the side, they almost relax him some.
It didn’t help, either, that so many of them had been so vocally supportive of the Ministry while it tried to cover up Voldemort’s return. Draco didn’t like those particular people, hated them with a passion even, but not even he was interested in the cruel remarks some of the other students were throwing at them.
“Eve’s is a crane,” Harry throws out when Granger stops for a breath. “And Leandra’s is a sea lion. Never thought I’d see a crane and sea lion snuggle, but it was pretty adorable.”
“For not blindly accepting everything she told us, really,” Max sighs. They didn’t sound happy, but they also didn’t sound like they were taking this all that seriously. It was just one more frustrating experience to add to the pile. “You wanna know what I’ve taken away from Religion class? And mass? And morning prayer? If you ever want someone to doubt Catholicism… Send them to Catholic school.”
Draco stomps down on the words he actually wants to say to Umbridge and instead offers a thankful smile, stepping into the office and taking his usual seat. He hates this room. He hates all the pink and hanging, cat plates. He hates that he has a usual seat. He hates that Umbridge knows how he takes his tea.
“But he cannot risk revealing his Animagus form while out in the open,” Luna says, snapping a few experimental photos herself, then hands the camera back to Draco.
“So, Finnigan is your friend again?” Draco asks the twins as he watches Finnigan pale and Tracey continue to stare at him through her curtain of hair.
Out of all the things in the World War 2 museum, few displays had really made Draco question its validity. With the realization that this was all an actual event that he had never even heard of before, he had become a bit more receptive and accepting of each explanation.
“My apologies for causing a scene, Granger,” he says, bowing his head a little, and then they are both turning back towards the castle, walking side-by-side.
“You’re stunning, dear,” Eve half-whispers to her, giving her a quick peck on the cheek, her dark lipstick thankfully not leaving a mark.
“Keep it in mind as you get started. If you have any questions, ask us,” Draco says firmly, then gives his hand a little, dismissive wave. “Get going, then.”
It didn’t stop there, though, because Umbridge did, actually, make house calls. She went house to house, calling students into their common rooms to demand they tell her where they had been that night. She had been especially harsh with Gryffindor, even brandishing her wand at one point.
okay with your father buying you onto your team?” Potter questions when they get to the cases holding the game balls. He’s giving Draco a very dark look, but the blonde shrugs nonchalantly.
Potter had to be doing it on purpose, Draco was sure of it. Everywhere he went people fawned over him, gushing about his great accomplishments and how he was destined for great things, and Potter just gobbled it all up. The modest act wasn’t fooling Draco.
“The Ministry is officially announcing the return of Voldemort,” Harry says in amazement, eyes wide as he reads.
That gets peoples attention. Suddenly the whole table is looking at him, eyes wide and curious. He remembers how Harry had been when he had first discovered Draco was The-Boy-Who-Lived, surprised by how little he knew, so Draco suspects, now, that that mindset is an unfortunately common thing.
“I liked my ‘two sides of the same coin’ metaphor,” Eve huffs, also joining the group and crouching beside Longbottom to look over Hermione.
“Don’t run, ickle first years! Stay! Stay!” Peeves is still yelling down the hallway. Harry, growing more and more frantic by the second, kicks the door, but that does nothing.
Harry smiles, weak but thankful, and quickly leans up to give Draco’s cheek a kiss. Then he’s stepping back and adjusting his footwork. “Come on, let’s figure out this spell,” he says with new vigor.
“‘Bad’ how?” Max’s mother finally asks, her voice a little quieter, but with a slightly different reverberation. Like she’d moved into a different room.
“Deal!” Vivian stretches out her hand to shake but the twins bypass that and instead each grab one of her arms. “To the library!” They then drag her, startled, away, leaving Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone in the vacant corridor.
“So demanding,” Draco huffs with an eyeroll, but no one seems particularly upset by his presence, so he settles more comfortably in. He does spot the mystery girl watching where Draco’s arm is still held captive and he narrows his eyes at her. “You know my name. What’s yours, then?”
“The Unforgiveable Curses are challenging to learn, but the Imperius Curse is deceptively easy,” Draco begins, stepping closer and taking ahold of one of Potter’s wrists and pressing his fingers to the pulse point. Out of the corner of his eye he sees Weasley startle, before grabbing ahold of Granger and dragging her away. He doesn’t know what that’s all about, but he’ll take the privacy for what it’s worth.
“Thank you, Harry,” Granger says in relief as Draco offers a small, pleased smile, and then they are hurrying off to get to Potions before they all get into trouble with Snape.
Sinistra is also there, and Draco knew she’d be, but it still makes his blood run cold. There hadn’t been any further attempts on Draco’s life since the fall, and beside her mysterious behavior during the troll attack Sinistra had acted like she normally would. It made Draco confused and curious, but now he would be back on his broom, in perfect sight of her, and his fears resurface.
Glancing around it appears most everyone is still focused on the ghosts. The earlier argument hadn’t drawn too much attention, thankfully, and now everyone was distracted, also thankfully. Draco runs a hand quickly through his hair, straightening out the strands that hang in his face in an attempt to just give his hands something to do.
“Not like I get to pick it,” he says, scrunching up his nose a few times to rid the tingly feeling that still lingered. Transforming into his Animagus form had felt completely right, with no issues beyond the initial pain and adjusting, but turning back into a human left him with a few lingering feelings.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. You…” Potter stops, swallows, then says, “Happy Christmas, Draco,” then turns around and flees through the castle as fast as he can.
“To my knowledge he was actually disowned,” Harry offers weakly, looking apologetic and concerned at once. “He, uh, didn’t care for his family’s traditions and rebelled. Ended up in Gryffindor with my dad, too.”
Even before the reality of Lucius Malfoy’s prejudices and affiliations had set in, Draco struggled for his attention. And, when he got it, he’d often overcompensate to assure that said attention wasn’t wasted.
“That’s good. It probably wouldn’t have gone well if I’d been arguing with a teapot, actually…” Potter mumbles to himself but Draco hears, his little ears twitching back towards him before refocusing on Krum.
“Your ten minutes are up,” Sinistra says behind him, having apparently come back up when Draco had his back turned, and the blonde looks back, too drained to feel startled. He looks at her and she stares at him with her blank, calculating eyes. She almost looks like she’s trying to figure out a puzzle, but it is hard to tell and Draco doesn’t feel up to deciphering anything.
He ended up in the library sitting at a table in a far corner across from Eve Hushburn. The Muggleborn was charming and shrewd when she needed to be, but on her own she was quiet and constantly reading. She was the perfect companion when Draco got in a
Bellatrix had said so, sitting there in Malfoy Manor’s dining room, standing and laughing in her deranged, gleeful way the moment Tana had apparated Draco in.
“How could he? You’re The-Boy-Who-Vanished. No one knew where you went or who took you away,” Harry reasons and Draco hates how much that makes sense. How could anyone have found him? McGonagall had said that even when they had finally found him again, they had still kept him a secret.
“Which is a massive breach in privacy, but there are likely no laws to regulate it,” Eve grumbles, displeased.
“What happened to being a suspicious bunch?” Weasley snaps, clearly not pleased, much the same as Granger. Even Potter, who seems the most relaxed, is clearly tense in the shoulders.
“Meh,” Sophie gives a shrug. She holds some of the strands of hair between her fingers and gives a snip with her scissors, trimming them first. “I like food and I like hair. I’m really not that complicated.”
The two captains are griping at each other, Wood demanding the Slytherin team leave while Flint’s smug responses only seemed to make the lions angrier. “Professor Snape gave us permission to use the pitch today,” Flint is saying, handing over a permission slip. Draco smirks even more viciously as Wood reads it.
While they talk, eating as they do, Gemma walks by and claps a hand against both boys’ shoulders, saying how happy she is to see them there, before heading over to sit with some of her friends. A few other Slytherins give them dirty or searching looks, but they are mostly left alone. Even Theodore and Millicent keep away, which Draco considers a victory, and they eat their dinner in peace.
“At this point, do you really think monitoring is going to be our biggest problem?” Theodore questions when Draco spins to glare at him.
has the Galleon?!” Weasley near shrieks, quickly jumping to conclusions and settling on the worst case.
About ten pages into the book and he hears hissed whispers across from him. He glances up to see the three Gryffindors leaned in close to one another, looking frustrated as they bicker about something, until finally Potter sighs in defeat. His green eyes turn towards Draco, his expression drawn, and he says, “Listen, Malfoy--”
Sinistra makes a sweeping motion with her hand, fingers flowing more elegantly than they had before, before she then points a single finger up into open air. “
Draco ignores it all, instead taking a quick glance around the nearly empty room with a scowl, then turning back to Potter as he shuts the door and stares at him, wide-eyed and shocked.
And then they’d sat together at the Gryffindor table, not even realizing what they were doing, and began to eat.
Merlin, Umbridge even pulled out some sign language while speaking to the half-giant. What was this woman’s problem? No, scratch that, Draco didn’t want to know. He just wanted her to go away already and—
Eve’s wand crackles through the air as she shoots a bolt of purple lightning at Millicent’s feet, holding her back from advancing any further. “Oops,” Eve drawls, but there’s a curl to her black lips as she glares at Millicent coldly.
Potter immediately turns an interesting shade of red and turns to his best friend so quickly Draco thinks he hears his neck snap. They proceed to have a very immature slapping match and, while they’re distracted, Granger leans towards Draco.
They finally slip out of the office, door shutting behind them, and only when they are a few corridors away do they finally break. Harry drops his school broom then grabs both of Draco’s shoulders, eyes big and face glowing. “Can you believe this?” he hisses, trying to keep his voice down in case Mr. Filch or another teacher might come by. “Quidditch! We just got onto the Quidditch team!”
“A secret organization?” Umbridge perks up immediately. “That is a direct violation of this school’s improved guidelines.” The woman is smiling, looking slimy and far too pleased, and Draco stands from his seat to move to the side of her desk.
“Oh, that one we all agree on,” Max says, focus clearly shifting to the conversation as they take a breather from their homework. “They’re crafty, but like… they’re supposed to be? Even the nice ones have to manipulate answers out of people, they’re just more agreeable.”
“Your article’s in the Prophet,” Harry says when the dishes have been taken away and now he, Draco, and Eve are just sitting around the table with new mugs. These have even more coffee in them. Apparently Yua Hushburn was a bit of a coffee fanatic…
Thankfully Lily releases him before it becomes even more awkward for him, and Harry comes over to bump their shoulders, smiling not unlike his father. “We were brilliant,” he says quietly, more confidence in his voice than Draco has ever heard before, and it sets his smile back into place.
Draco Lucius Malfoy was not a happy boy. It was his eighth birthday today and he had made it abundantly clear he wanted a wand. He didn’t care he wasn’t technically old enough, he knew he could handle it and he deserved the opportunity to try one out.
Draco rolls his eyes skyward as Max begins to cackle loudly. He’d just wanted a relaxing afternoon, the year already proving to be one of the most stressful to date, and he should have known Max would begin acting foolish.
Draco glances back at the window, brows furrowed. Augi said he was going to get Draco help. Had he really gone and woken Harry up just to make sure Draco wasn’t left alone? That… was incredibly sweet, actually. Especially for a creature that Draco had only just met. Then again… Augi said the merpeople were always watching them.
“Why didn’t it unlock when me and Malfoy went down there, though? When we interviewed Huang-Jun? If it was about Gryffindors and Slytherins or whatever bullshit you came up with, why not then?” Weasley whines, because he can’t let this go, apparently, and Draco sneers.
“It didn’t cross any of our minds, Harry,” Draco reminds him, voice firm, and he tilts his head so he can look at Harry. “Literally, none of us.”
He’d heard a few concerned calls from the Muggle parents, likely not wanting him to run off on his own, but he’d already gotten away.
The plan was for them to get a few pictures taken together and would then arrive fashionably late to the festivities. A few dances in Eve would slip away to go and be with her actual date, whom she had only just told him was a Hufflepuff named Leandra.
“Potter!” Crabbe and Goyle say in unison, the Boy-Who-Lived jumping in surprise and finally looking around him, confused. The two, large wizards have moved over to the side of Draco’s bed Harry is currently sitting on, both of them carrying crinkled and frayed parchments in their hands.
The two snicker and Draco has a moment, just a moment, where he is looking down at himself dancing with a Gryffindor muggleborn and wondering how he had gotten here. They’d, once upon a time, despised each other, but ever since third year… something had shifted, and Draco was pretty sure it had been within him.
“I enjoy taking photos. When I came upon this incident, I thought it prudent to record the following events.”
“Draco will be able to get in thanks to his name and father,” Sirius explains, “I’ll go in as his service dog.”
“You do play Gryffindor first,” Hermione says, speaking up for the first time since Ron snapped at her. Draco eyes Hermione and Ron suspiciously, unhappy that his friend would feel the need to remain quiet like that. “Having a few extra brooms in the air would be a big help.”
“Do you recall in our second year when you approached me to inform me you did not think I was the Heir of Slytherin?”
Potter walks a little closer and wraps a hand around Draco’s wrist, squeezing, and mumbles, “You’re not breathing.” He’s blessedly looking off to the side and not at Draco as the blonde heaves in air, forces himself to relax.
“I have decided to sponsor your Quidditch team,” Lucius says in way of greeting and Draco’s brows rise. He looks over to Flint who has a self-satisfied smirk on his face. The captain nods at him.
He ends up writing a slew of letters during classes, crumbling up most of them, and getting a few looks from the teachers. For the most part, however, he’s doing so well in his classes that they don’t make too much of a fuss. In Transfiguration McGonagall looks disapproving, but when Draco perfectly turns his worm into yarn and back again, she rolls her eyes and leaves him be.
“James Potter was a Chaser for Gryffindor,” Sinistra says and it isn’t a question. Her dark eyes turn to Draco and he stiffens. “Mr. Malfoy, this is your first time flying?” Draco can’t seem to find his voice so he just nods, eyes wide. “Naturally talented, then.” A blush creeps up Draco’s face at that and he ducks his head, flattered and embarrassed. He wasn’t used to adults complimenting him.
in the purest of senses, very rarely came a Slytherin’s way, and often there were more cons than pros if they strove “out of bounds” themselves. Draco had been very lucky, the cards falling in all the right places that, the moment he’d begun voicing interest in rebellion and questioning tradition, he hadn’t lost everything. He’d garnered confusion, curiosity, and disapproval, but not scorn.
“Holy shi-- Draco, I need some help!” Max’s voice comes through and Draco nearly drops everything just to scoop up the radio and pull it closer. “I don’t know what to do! Mama and Papa are gone and Eric just drove home, he just got his license, and he--”
“Your talk go well?” Draco questions the moment he walks into the Slytherin dorm room. He’s a mess and grinning and he doesn’t even care. Today had been a good day.
Glancing back around the room he spots Lily Potter looking right at him, her own green eyes alight with some strong emotion Draco can’t place. When they lock eyes, however, her expression softens and she smiles gratefully at him, nodding once and he nods back.
The underside of Draco’s bed is clean. Spotless, even, with the toys and books he’d stashed underneath now neatly put away in their rightful spots.
“You agreed to help. Stop complaining.” Potter turns back to watch the massive, destructive tree, trying to end the conversation.
“Yes. That,” Granger nods, pulling a baffled Draco back to the wall, carefully readjusting the cloak to ensure they are still covered. “I think I must apologize for that… I didn’t listen to your concerns over her and brushed them off like they were nothing, but when the twins said we had been ratted out… I knew it must have been Edgecombe.”
By the time Max had finished their rant Draco had been boiling with embarrassment and fury. They’d snapped at each other a bit more, getting nastier and nastier, until ending the call and not talking for nearly two weeks.
“He had a nightmare,” Longbottom explains and Draco stands a little straighter. “Don’t know what about. He just woke up screaming. Woke the rest of us up, too, and Ron took him to Professor McGonagall. After that Harry, Ron, Ginny, and the twins all left in a hurry.”
“That is quite enough. Please, control yourselves and go about your day,” she says firmly and doesn’t wait for a response, instead laying a hand on Draco’s back and pushing him around the people and towards the back. The blonde breathes a sigh of relief as they step into a back room, brick walls on all sides.
Hey guys! If you didn't notice in the last chapter I made a small mistake and said that the Quidditch game was the following day after the incident, but I forgot the Quidditch game was after Halloween. I fixed that up and now we are on to Spoopy Day!
Hermione hangs her head and says nothing, simply accepting the telling off she was sure to get. “Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” McGonagall continues, eyes hard like stone. “I am very disappointed in you,” Draco actually flinches at those words, sympathetic for his friend, “If you are unharmed make your way back up to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their common rooms.”
Draco rolls his eyes at that as Potter turns to his best friend, clearly amused, but struggling to allow himself the distraction. “The ferret thing was that imposter’s idea,” Draco snaps, before, with a few beats of concentration, he shifts.
“Looks like his head wound was worse than we thought. Lovegood thinks he has a concussion,” Blaise cringes, looking back at their friend. Harry has gently set Ginny down to sit beside her brother, careful of her leg, and is murmuring to Luna as he looks over his best friend with frantic urgency.
“Krum, would you like to see my favorite spell out of those books?” the blonde looks to the Durmstrang student with an overly cheerful smile.
“Within your rights does not make it appropriate, Draco my boy!” Draco startles at the over-excited voice of Max’s father, then immediately scowls down at the radio. He had been talking to Max, he didn’t want to talk to this weird, cheerful man.
Sometimes, rarely, the crying is Max’s. They don’t cry over much, their outlook on life so unashamedly positive that they just can’t be bothered most of the time, but sometimes things get to them. A rough few days stacking up into a single meltdown, a bad grade on a test, getting into particular trouble with their parents, or the occasional dog death on television.
“Yes. And you don’t,” Draco says, matter-of-factly. He turns a page of the book. “I am quite the expert on being a shitty friend, you see, so it is simple for me to recognize the actions of one,” he smirks at Granger over the top of the book, “Takes an ass to know an ass.”
Draco reaches out and takes the offered disposable camera, looking it over a few times then snapping a quick photo of Eve flipping him off to make sure it works. “Hardly long at all,” he admits. It hadn’t even been twelve hours since it had broken.
“We can do many dark things when we are struggling to survive,” Draco says with a resigned sigh, “Thus the Militus gained a dreadfully negative reputation.”
“Somebody is…” Draco whimpers, because while it may not have been aimed at Potter, a Killing Curse had still been used tonight.
“I do not like the term ‘motive,’ but my intentions, I assure you, are honest,” Draco decides to take this as seriously as he can. As ridiculous as this might all seem, he really, really wanted to date Harry, and these people weren’t just his friends, they were his family, and that meant Draco needed to play ball. “I would like to get to know him more and more everyday. I would like to be there for him when he needs me and let him be there for me as well. I would like to laugh and argue and enjoy each other’s’ presences as often as we can.”
“Anybody want to try a career as an Unspeakable and fill the rest of us in?” Theodore grumbles, jabbing at Longbottom’s elbow to get him to stop messing with his nose. The two, lanky boys have a momentary stare off - the Gryffindor pouting and the Slytherin arching an expectant brow - before Longbottom relents.
A pack of rechargeable batteries from Max’s father, with a charger that is meant to plug into something called an “outlet,” which Draco most certainly does not have, but the thought is still nice.
For a moment, Harry is silent, reading over the notes swiftly, before he’s promptly rolling up the parchment and tucking it under his jacket. “Take a shower. While you do, I’m going to bring this to Hermione. She’ll read over it and send it off,” Harry commands, shifting behind Draco and nudging him in the direction of the dorm’s bathroom.
“I can see your outlines,” Blaise comments, clearly seeing the same problem, and Theodore and Tracey’s heads pop back into view.
“What’s wrong with Malfoy?” Granger whispers as she approaches a few minutes later. Draco hasn’t moved.
The thing about Saturdays at Hogwarts is that most professors have set hours in their offices. To a younger student, or to a student less prone to mischief, one might think the best time to sneak into a professor’s office is during the scheduled timeframe they won’t be in it. Except, most professors set up minor charms when they aren’t scheduled to be in their offices to alert them when someone enters, meaning it is likely the second worst time to sneak in, just behind when they are actually inside.
Mrs Nubble doesn’t write another letter, too frightened to do much of anything else that day, and instead joins the rest of the house’s residents on their chores, attempting to get her mind away from the events.
“But… but it’s not… a verb…” Hermione splutters, looking suddenly very stunned and personally offended.
“Depends. Think you could tutor me?” Harry’s smile turns a bit more playful and Draco’s eyes are momentarily drawn to his lips.
“That would be the Headmaster,” Draco replies evenly, sitting down on a stone bench beside one of Hagrid’s gardens. “He’s kind of upset with the Headmaster at the moment, though. It’s… complicated. Don’t ask.”
Then, the Gryffindor is speaking in a soft, weak voice, “Maybe it would have been more merciful if I’d done nothing.” He doesn’t say it, but Draco can hear what Harry really thinks. Maybe it would have been better if Sirius had died, instead of left to rot inside his own body.
“Do you recall the file I showed you on the record? It didn’t have the actual prophecy in it, but it DID state that Professor Trelawney was the one to make it, while Dumbledore was the one to hear and turn it in. We could speak to one of them,” Draco squeezes Harry’s wrist, “Once we get out of here.”
But then Frederick is patting his shoulder and stepping away, looking equal parts serious and apologetic. “Let’s get to work, then, shall we?”
“The fish sit on the cabinets where you’ll find each person’s file,” Mr. Davis explains. Then, like they aren’t there anymore, he goes straight back to his work.
Blaise eventually graces them with his presence and a copy of The Prophet under his arm. He asks after everyone's health like it is expected of him, then immediately starts talking about the paper before anyone can answer.
McGonagall’s brows have risen, the wrinkles on her face more prominent as they scrunch up, but then she’s offering that tiny, slightly reassuring smile and Draco releases a held breath. “You are quite clever. I wonder if you will be a Ravenclaw with that wit.” Draco had no idea what a Ravenclaw was. “Yes, Miss Granger is a witch. A muggleborn, specifically. Professor Flitwick, Hogwarts’s Charms teacher, assisted her and her family not too long ago, if I am remembering correctly.”
There’s a universal flinch amongst the Gryffindors and Draco stiffens, looking amongst them in confusion and mounting concern. What did they know that he didn’t?
“What about Crabbe and Goyle?” Potter asks when Draco appears finished. The trio look confused that the two, giant boys weren’t on Draco’s list.
“I’ve never been on this side of one of those before,” Longbottom mumbles and Draco raises his sleeve to scrub furiously at his face.
Potter was a mess, that was clear, and he avoided crowds like the plague. Then again, crowds tended to avoid him, too, but somehow that only made it worse.
It was by far the most amazing thing Draco had ever witnessed when he saw Ginny Weasley punch Rodrick Bartholemew, a Ravenclaw sixth year, in the mouth for calling Crabbe and Goyle “the retarded gargoyles left to rot under the castle.” The two wizards - who made Ginny look miniscule and could have taken care of themselves - had hardly left her side for a week after that.
Max greets him immediately with an off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday,” loud and exactly what would be expected of the Muggle. This is followed by the radio being passed around to Max’s family, who all offer their own birthday wishes before it returns to Max. Draco talks about his day in as much detail as he can, especially focusing on his new “racing bike.” He has learned enough of Muggle culture to know some good substitute terms for his magical experiences.
“Ronald Weasley?” Hermione questions for clarity and Draco nods. He’s interested why the girl’s face suddenly sours with a vicious pout. “I have only been here one day, but I already do not like that boy,” she announces, putting her nose high into the air, and Draco turns more fully towards her, a smirk playing on his lips.
When Dumbledore emerges from the castle, Eve leading him across the grounds, the Headmaster looks over the body with a very quiet gaze, before looking up at Draco. “What has happened here?” he asks, voice calm if a little breathless. He’s pulled himself together very tightly, keeping calm but clearly upset.
Draco glares over at the table, silver eyes sharp as he tries to burn a hole through Pansy’s head. When he hears a snort behind him he turns around with a snap, furious and ready to bite someone’s head off. Ron at least startles a little, sitting just behind, working with Dean, but then he shrugs.
Harry’s brows furrow, like Draco has said something ridiculous, and his hand finds Draco’s. “Of course we do. Did you really not think that you were?” Harry questions, voice softer than it had been.
” Weasley says for the millionth time, flicking his wand around hazardously, a single splutter of shadows spitting out of his wand. The Room of Requirement was set up for one of their usual meetings, but with their new interest in practicing the Militus Charm the room had offered a small, open space off to the side for occasional spell attempts. Currently, the faux scene outside the faux windows was green, rolling hills alight with summer light, likely meaning Weasley was the one to get there first.
It was an interesting thought, but he brushed it aside as he entered the final OWL: History of Magic. He was confident in his abilities, and he was going to enter with no fears and leave feeling calm and relieved.
On a few occasions he has to freeze on an empty perch, sitting down, raising a paw, and opening his mouth in a silent snarl. He hardly looks like the other gargoyles, but a cursory glance leaves most passersby shrugging and walking off, content.
“You look chipper today, Potter!” Draco calls over the roar of wind and rain. He floats as casually as one can when soaked to the bone and constantly having to slick his hair out of his eyes. The storm isn’t enough to stop the first Quidditch game of the season, but it certainly drenches everyone’s moods.
Or Max’s whole family supporting Draco, or the care packages they’d send his way, or the records and comfortable clothes, or the compassion and support to urge him down his own path, or the soft words when he was upset, or the firm words when he was cruel…
“This part is for you. Pick whatever,” Draco replies, trying to remember what Algebra was. Was that the one like Arithmancy or something else?
“The fuck was all that?!” Blaise is demanding, stepping forward to wave his hands at the figures angrily. They stare at him without answer. “I thought we solved your stupid riddles! What was THAT?!”
Draco’s brows furrow as he hears the name. Weasley. That sounded familiar. Then all at once he remembers his run in with Arthur Weasley in the Muggles Studies section of Flourish and Blotts and whatever little color Draco has on his face vanishes. Oh, no, he was not getting into another conversation with that blabbermouth any time soon, thank you.
“Best option is to put a physical barrier between yourself and the caster,” Draco says firmly, taking a step forward, hands folded behind his back. Tracey and Luna’s matching, dreamy stares flick to him.
A few of the older students leant forward to shake his hand, like they’d done with Draco, but they had a look on their faces that set the blonde’s stomach turning. They thought this was hilarious, he realized. Harry had made it clear everyone expected him to go into Gryffindor, and Draco had read that Slytherin and Gryffindor had a long-standing rivalry. This couldn’t be easy for the messy-haired boy.
Draco doesn’t know why he suddenly feels the urge to run his fingers through the other boy’s hair, but he represses the urge and returns to his reading.
So, they had snacks while they planned. Spellbooks were opened all around them, including Draco’s three volumes of dark arts, and they were pouring over some possible new spells to learn.
“This isn’t a game. If this IS connected it could be really serious,” Harry says, his worry quickly taking over.
Back in the Slytherin common room Draco finds Harry sitting in one of the couches, trying his hardest to finish up some Charms homework, and Draco quietly takes a seat next to him and offers to help. It is a peace offering and no further words are needed, especially when Harry looks so relieved, realizing all is fine between them as they go through the questions.
Granger is raising her voice at Weasley over something he’s said and having no tact at all, while Potter looks like he wants to be anywhere else but there right now.
The… goo is so slow and leisurely and he can’t take his eyes away. There’re all kinds of colors, and he’s immediately drawn to a green one that surely must be speaking to him.
“Can’t tell me to not thank you when you’re a big cat,” Harry chuckles, laughing when Draco huffs at him. Just to prove a point, though, Draco uncurls his tail to swat it against Harry’s face. It just makes him giggle more and Draco recurls the tail around both of Harry’s legs, resigned to his incredibly pleasant fate.
He’d also managed, near the beginning, to hear about Ludo Bagman’s offer to assist Potter on his task, which was decidedly suspicious.
They’re definitely going to hit some roadblocks at some point. Very big roadblocks. Very big and very dangerous roadblocks. Draco’s just waiting for the damn ball to drop.
“It is impossible to teach where one lacks respect,” Narcissa replies and her face looks sad. Like she actually mourns the failed opportunity.
“Enough,” she snaps at him and his wide, startled eyes. “Draco has better hearing and smelling in this form--”
“Okaasan!” Eve whines as her mother glares at her and Duke looks between the two women with an amused smile on his face.
Draco had managed to explain the situation as Muggle-like as he possibly could. Basically, Umbridge was a failure as a teacher, but they believed Potter would make a spectacular tutor in her place. The issue was that all clubs, including study groups, needed to go through Umbridge first, and there was no way they could get her approval.
But he loved Max, too. No, not in the same way, not at all. Draco could never think of Max the way he thought of Harry, but there was so much love there, too. Raw and new and sudden and not what was expected.
They’ll talk again, and they’ll be okay, but until then Draco will be in a horrid mood, stuck in his thoughts and lonelier than ever. He’ll attempt to play with Crabbe and Goyle, strike up a hopeful conversation, but they’re so useless he wonders why he keeps them around.
“What about a keychain you can move to multiple places depending on what you want?” Lee says and the twins look like they might explode with excitement. Because of that excitement and Draco’s desire for distraction, he hardly notices the dragging footsteps behind him until Fred and George both look over his shoulder in clear surprise.
“Do… Do you ever find the answer?” Draco whispers, feeling his heart lodge in his throat at the painful shift in Max’s mother’s voice. While this was not her father, she had still lost someone too, yet she was taking the time to sit down and try to explain things to a child that wasn’t even hers.
They don’t talk about much at first, both Potter and Draco sitting on the bespectacled boy’s floor, leaning their backs against his bed. Potter asks about Max’s summer and how it might differ in America, to which Max immediately complains about the heat and humidity.
“Ever since I’ve known them,” Eve sighs dramatically. She’d pulled out a book when she’d found the conversation veering in an uninteresting direction, but now she sets it into her lap. “Years, now…”
The Slytherins - and Gryffindors, if Draco snuck up to their tower - were also seeming a bit more at ease as they knocked off more and more exams. They didn’t have the same confidence that Draco and his study group had, but finishing these things was a relief no matter what.
“I’m not sure if anything can do that, mate,” Ron jokes, smiling brightly, and Harry offers a small smile back.
She hurries over to Draco’s side, patting down her robes, then pauses to glance at the wintery landscape outside the faux window. “You always pick a winter scene,” the muggleborn says as she takes a seat beside Draco.
“It is a witch or wizard’s will to survive,” Sinistra corrects with little to no inflection in her voice, but Draco still sags for his wrong answer. “As living, conscious individuals, we all have the instinctive desire to live as long as possible. We may become entirely different people when we are struggling for our lives.”
And then he’d been awoken by Ms. Hushburn smacking both him and Harry across the head with a rolled-up newspaper. She’d yelled a lot in Japanese, clearly not happy about finding the two boys together on her couch when she had put in effort to keep them separate.
Draco hardly waits another moment before he throws the Earworm Jinx at Granger, sticking his go-to song into her head, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” and she snarls at him.
“I just think you’re thinking too hard on this! This guy sounds like he doesn’t actually enjoy all the attention. And if I’m able to gather that from your clearly biased stories, well…” Max leaves the rest unsaid, but Draco gets the picture.
“Come back, boy!” Madam Hooch called and the rest of the students watch in varying degrees of worry as Neville just goes up and up.
He had met Hermione Granger many years ago entirely by chance. They did not live in the same neighborhood, but they did live close enough. Close enough that on a walk home from school Draco had been surprised when a shoe fell squarely on his head.
“If you could shapeshift into any animal… What would it be?” Draco questions one evening up in the Astronomy Tower. It is just him and Max tonight, but there is no telling if that will remain. Potter, even without the Marauders Map, can pop up at any time, it feels.
Potter makes an exasperated face, but then Eve is speaking, her own expression bored. “He’s completely useless at receiving positive feedback.”
As it turns out the centaur, Firenze, managed to scare off the hooded figure after Draco and Potter had absconded, then rushed to try and find them. The forest was no place for children, he’d said, and Draco couldn’t have agreed more.
It’s like it is feeling out its own, new existence, shaking out muscles that had gone unused, before circling gracefully back to Draco. It stands beside him, not really looking at him, but
“Okay…” Draco says quietly, nodding and Potter’s messy hair - he couldn’t even tame it for the evening? - tickles his cheek. “Let’s talk.”
When Dumbledore stands once more the entire hall falls silent, attention entirely on their Headmaster. “Ahem - Just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered,” he begins and Draco half expects him to say some more nonsense. “I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”
Then he sees, out of the corner of his eye, a familiar mop of messy, raven hair and a tall ginger lingering across the way. Draco arches his brow at Potter and Weasley’s snooping, smirking and figuring he’ll be able to use this against them. After all, Draco is the resident sneak, not them.
He stops just at the Entrance Chamber, sniffing carefully. He can pick up the scent of Harry, Hermione, Weasley, Ginny, Luna, and Longbottom. He’s familiar with all the DA members at this point, but especially these ones.
“That’s fucking adorable,” Max immediately replies, “You know what… forget my whole argument. Follow your dream, Draco, I believe in you.”
“Little Billy got into Slytherin?” Dean cuts in, voice pitched high, “Oh no! But he was meant to be a theater kid!” A few of the pureblood kids at the table don’t quite get that joke, but they laugh along anyway when everyone else does.
“Because of what happened yesterday? Are you daft?” the Slytherin glares back. It was clear the trio was on edge, which was making this conversation more infuriating than it needed to be. “You’re an idiot for attacking Montague like that, but I certainly don’t agree with your punishment.”
He isn’t sure what has just transpired between the two of them, what will change, if anything will, but it doesn’t feel… bad. It feels inevitable. Maybe they skipped a few steps and leapt headfirst into this strange, new existence, but that seems perfectly in line with their relationship. He still doesn’t think he and Potter are friends, though. That title doesn’t sound right, even now.
“You look so miserable,” Draco says with a wave of his hand at Potter, one of his brows arching derisively, “I’m doing you a favor, really. You clearly need some peace and quiet, and you won’t be able to do that if you are left alone to your thoughts.”
“Granger,” Draco gives a sharp nod. “Weasley,” he offers the same to the tense, ginger boy. Potter seems to be the only one who isn’t, on some level, upset to see him. And isn’t that baffling?
“Just let me see it myself! What’s the harm?” he says petulantly. He knows he’s getting stared at by his foster siblings but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care at all. With his fists clenched tight at his sides he stomps his foot and glares up at his foster mother. It’s an immature thing to do, but he doesn’t care about that either.
“Well, if you mean fate as in ‘every single piece of our lives was decided by something else before we were even born,’ then no, I don’t think it’s very real…” Longbottom says, eyes tilted up towards the glass roof of the greenhouse. “But maybe substantial parts of our lives? Maybe the paths we take there can differ, but the outcomes will remain the same?”
Madam Pomfrey took care of Montague as soon as he was brought in, scowling something furious, and waved her wand urgently over his prone body. Draco and Tracey were quickly shooed out, the mediwitch focused, and the two Slytherins ended up lingering outside the hospital wing.
“Thank you,” Hermione cuts into their thoughts. She looks shy now, glancing up at Ron and Harry uncertainly. Draco, however, smiles when he catches her eye and steps forward to give her a tight hug.
“Just go away already!” Ron screams, trying to grab the troll’s attention again, but it’s useless. Draco is too close and its beady eyes are glaring down at him. The club rises and Draco only has a moment of relief when he sees the girls are alright, having fallen backwards from the impact, before he’s being lifted up by his leg.
“Oh, all house elves can read, young master. If we are called to fetch groceries, books, or organize the library we must know how to read to do so,” Tana explains and Draco looks past her at the corner of his closet where his Muggle books are hidden away.
“It’s not crucial,” Potter agrees, “I just would like to, and I think you could benefit from sharing this with more people.”
“Yes, Potter, he was. Can you imagine why?” Draco replies, matching Potter’s fire with ice in his eyes.
There had been more rustling, Draco staring down at his radio in surprise, and the distant sound of Max’s mother saying, “Darling, you need to calm down. You’ll frighten the boy.”
uh…” Did these guys not usually introduce themselves, or something? Mrs. Nubble would be appalled, Draco imagines. “Are you… you guys first years, too?”
“That’s the only floo that isn’t monitored by the Ministry,” Draco argues, brain beginning to work out possible ways to chase off the three Slytherins. He starts to move, releasing Theodore to keep heading for Umbridge’s office, but the other boy grabs Draco’s arm this time.
“Or maybe it is because the only reason your ‘people’ have been successful is because you have used the suppression of these minorities as stepping stones to the top and they’re sick of it! If they actually DID go about stealing your jobs, then all they’d be doing is following your lead!”
“He said… An Animagus?” Mrs. Weasley questions, looking slightly nervous, but Potter reaches out and squeezes her hand.
“This was not some flippant prank, or even some scandalous plan to make Hogwarts look bad. Someone did everything they could to ensure you were picked by the Goblet, without a shadow of a doubt. Harry Potter, I do believe someone is attempting to kill you.”
“I hate you,” Draco snarls and he’s pretty sure he means it. He was never doing another experiment for the woman ever again. “It works though…”
They sit close together, still with hooked arms, and wait for the chaotic ride to end, then greatly slip off the bus onto solid land with mirroring sighs of relief.
” he exclaims. Another Death Eater is charging at them, wand aglow, but is abruptly knocked backwards by Longbottom’s charging warthog. The shadowy beast isn’t huge, but it snorts furiously, stamping a foot, before charging into the fray.
Rita Skeeter was a boon for Draco’s investigations. Someone who had built her career on getting information, with something so simple to hold over her, seemed almost too good to be true, even if she was a tacky wench.
With all the excitement Draco is even more eager to get ready for bed. A few minutes later he is climbing into his bed, teeth brushed, face washed, and pajamas on, Harry clambering into his own bed a few moments after. Muddy has slithered somewhere under Draco’s bed, apparently hunting for rats now that she’s out of her duffel bag confinement, and Draco burrows into the warmth of his new, thick comforter.
It seems, however, that with dessert comes conversation and Millicent Bulstrode is leaning over the table towards Harry and Draco, her own plate piled with doughnuts and Jell-O, a strange combination. “Speaking of your mother, Potter,” she says, beady eyes glancing over at the Head Table, and she smirks. Draco doesn’t like it, and he doesn’t like how Harry has stiffened, as if frightened.
Sirius manages to snap Bellatrix in her shoulder with a yellow ball of energy that makes that arm go limp. It doesn’t slow down the dark witch, however, as she picks up her wand with her other hand, dodges spells thrown at her from Order members trying to get in close, and instead fires back.
Sure enough, as Draco had expected, the day after his ferret-y adventure he has Ron Weasley to deal with. Granger asks after his health, which is appreciated, but Weasley can’t seem to get over the fact that Draco had been stuck as a little ball of indignant fury for who knows how long.
Draco looks down, where Potter has taken ahold of his wrist and squeezes it. It’s like the other boy doesn’t want to let go, which baffles Draco, but Potter manages to pull himself away and hurry out of the compartment to fetch his bags.
The room falls silent, looking over at the spacey girl, but she does not acknowledge them further, so they go back to their own talking.
“Do as she says, Weasley, or I’ll curse you out of existence!” Pansy shrieks, her own fear reaching its peak, and Draco thinks he quite agrees with her, but all the blood has gone to his head and he feels horribly nauseous.
“It’s fine,” he replies, too sharply, and shakes his head. “It sucks, but I can’t miss someone I never met.”
likes them save for their own kind,” Daphne says primly from her seat across from them. She is cutting up her food with delicate, controlled movements, a pinky out where she holds her knife.
The tapping sounds again and Draco realizes it isn’t from the direction of any of the dorm rooms, but rather from the windows. The windows that look out into the lake. The windows where a large merman currently floats.
It was bullying without limits. Students jinxed and hexed to oblivion because Millicent, Warrington, Montague, and Verteaux were allowed to do it. Which meant the good-Slytherins had to try jinxing and hexing students, too.
Potter’s eyes widen comically, his pulse picking up beneath Draco’s fingers, and the blonde’s lips pinch as he thinks over his words. “That came out rather poetic, didn’t it? Actually, I am here to take you out to Muggle London for a bit.”
“I’ve never even had sex, Eve,” Draco whines, moving to follow but standing at the side of his bed, looking down at his friend.
Potter still kept an eye on him for the next few days, only really stopping once Draco was able to speak clearly again. Pushing the leaf against the side of his cheek seemed to be the easiest solution most of the time.
“So…” Harry begins, tapping his fingers on his knees, “Are we…” Harry pauses, reevaluating whatever he’d been about to say, and Draco waits for him to sort it out. “What should I tell Ron and Hermione we are?”
They had decided to pose an idea for a tutoring group to Umbridge with a far more acceptable premise for her pallet. At first, they could not determine a good group idea, but then Draco had remembered, from a not-too-distant memory, Professor Sinistra offering to tutor students in wandless magic.
This shop wasn’t as busy as some of the other stores, seeming to be in a little, calm bubble all its own, and Draco could appreciate that. There was a slightly older witch adjusting a display in the window when the blonde enters and she looks up at him the second the bell above the door jingles. She gives him a single once over before nodding and approaching.
Gemma gives them a few moments to take it all in before she steps in front of their group, hands on her hips, and big smile on her face. She looks ecstatic as she starts her obviously well-practiced speech for them all. She tells them a few facts about Slytherin they all already know. She tells them the common room has a charm on it that makes it feel unwelcoming to non-Slytherins. She tells them about a giant squid in the lake that sometimes swims by the windows, along with many other creatures. She compares the atmosphere of the room to a “mysterious, underwater shipwreck,” which would usually give Draco the chills, but this time he can’t help but happily agree.
He’s never had a friend before. And he didn’t want to come off as rude. He was a high bred child. He was poised and in control, not sloppy or rude. He was better, just like his mother and father said, and it would not do to let them down.
It was a gorgeous day, with a light breeze, blue sky, fluffy clouds, and just the right temperature. Draco found himself watching the grass ripple in the wind like a movie, and just beyond that the trees of the Forbidden Forest sway ominously.
“Nahhhh,” Max replies, “You still got that record player, anyway! We’ll keep sending you vinyls and stuff!”
“Not allowed to leave at night save for Astronomy class,” Draco sighs, ignoring the stab of guilt when he remembers last night, standing and brushing off some of the grass on his pants. He doesn’t offer to help as Vivian begins collecting all her supplies and she doesn’t ask.
Death Eater movement, and just the general stresses of school - Draco takes to pictures a lot more than he had in previous years.
“Well…” Draco pauses to think of his answer, turning back to Lucky in front of him. It seemed completely content to stay there so long as it was getting affection and attention. Like some kind of giant, skeletal puppy. “This one is certainly friendly,” he offers, glancing at Umbridge. “But that’s just animals, isn’t it? Some are friendly, some aren’t. Kind of like people.”
“Hmm, yes, I think I may just agree with you on that. Such an ambitious boy, ready to do what needs to be done. Yes, and as much as they will help you, I do believe you will help them, as well. Better be SLYTHERIN!”
“Why would he care about something like that?” Harry asks sharply, taking the file from his friend as his eyes frantically scour over the minimum information.
Dumbledore looks up at Draco from the files and offers a small smile, reassuring. “It shall be out little secret,” he says, shutting the folder and tucking it under his arm.
“The quote says magic and you are being purposefully obtuse, aren’t you? All I’m saying is we may just not be at a point to understand what is going on.”
“These people are dirty and dangerous. They want to disrupt the traditions long kept sacred by my ancestors. They--“
His sharp tone does not have the reaction he had been looking for. No, instead of rearing back, looking hurt, or even getting angry, Finnigan and Thomas almost look entertained. No, scratch that, they definitely look entertained.
“I’ll admit, there aren’t many muggleborns in Slytherin, only three, but they seem perfectly fine with them. I doubt anyone would want to mess with that Vivian character.”
The other boy’s smirk shifts into something softer and he steps forward. “I always am,” he says lowly, before reaching out and touching Draco’s brow. The blonde flinches away, hissing, only then remembering the cut he’d sustained from that bloody owl as a ferret. “You should get that fixed up.”
“She didn’t turn me down!” Potter nearly yells, silencing Draco, and the fingers still laying at the back of Draco’s neck curl self-consciously. Then, far more quietly, “I… turned her down…”
“A swamp isn’t a person, Tracey!” Daphna yells and Draco has to hold her back from pulling out her wand in her mounting frustration.
It feels like a charming spot his mother may even like, and he stashes that idea away for another time.
“They’re not all bad,” Granger says with a disapproving frown. “I quite like Eve, and Sophie, Daphne, and Tracey were sweet. There’s also this pureblooded boy. Blonde, tall, particularly pointy for a human being. He’s okay, I suppose.”
“Whoa…” comes a quiet breath from the hallway and Draco looks up sharply, eyes falling on Harry where he stands in the entryway to the living room. The boy’s eyes are wide, staring at Draco, and his face has flushed. And, in mounting horror, Draco begins to realize why.
Draco sighs deeply, sliding further down onto the floor, realizing this conversation was far, far from over.
“So, our studying abilities will change based on how we learn?” Draco had surmised. He’d never heard of these learning styles before, but then again, Max’s mother was a neuroscientist. She knew a lot of how the brain worked.
Draco hadn’t thought of that, and he feels rather embarrassed that he didn’t, but he agrees with no argument because it does sound nice. They walk around the grounds for the most of the day, slipping into the forest, searching for the thestrals, taking pictures, talking, kissing. It is quiet and calm with no one around, but they do spot a few people flying around over at the Quidditch pitch.
“Right! Lean back with a glass of apple cider, a good book, and let your cares drift away,” Max’s father hums like he’s imagining the scenario right then.
When Draco Malfoy is four years of age, he is certain there is a monster in his closet. He can no longer remember what kind, he thinks he may have thought it a werewolf or vampire, but what he does recall is his father rushing into his bedroom in the dead of night when Draco had begun crying out.
“According to Professor Flitwick,” the elder witch finally speaks up as they step back into the sunlight. It feels brighter here in Diagon Alley than the rest of London had. “Your friend, Miss. Granger, had a similar conversation with the goblins when she visited.” Oh, that did not surprise him at all. Draco and Hermione disagreed on quite a bit, but they were with each other for the important stuff.
For a moment they sit in silence, Draco kicking his dangling feet and not looking up at the woman across from him. When he offers no immediate answer Max’s mother continues. “It’s okay to feel scared of what you saw in the museum.”
“What’s wrong with that?” Harry’s tone has shifted, now. He sounds cold, like he’s somehow separating from the conversation mentally, and Draco can’t blame him. This was quickly taking a turn he had not been expecting and certainly didn’t like.
They go over the potions they’ll be brewing over the year, most of them sounding very serious and familiar from their potions books, but every other Monday Lily has decided they’ll learn a more fun, playful potion as a way to break up the monotony and just enjoy themselves.
“Transform back if it’s more comfortable,” Harry says, and, with a smile in his voice, adds, “And I wouldn’t mind having my stuffed toy again.”
“The Love Chamber is locked to all but a select few officials due to its dangerous, unpredictable nature. The Locked Room, however, locked itself so long ago that no one knows what is inside anymore,” Tracey says, swaying back and forth where she stands as they work around her.
Draco frowns, watching the friends struggle, and lays a hand on Harry’s arm. It’s tense and unmoving, save for a few twitches, and Harry doesn’t outwardly acknowledge him.
Despite being in a daze his whole ride up to the castle at the beginning of the year, wondering after Potter’s behavior, Dumbledore’s motives, and the mystery of how they intended to solve everything, he still makes a point of petting the massive beast’s flank, earning a pleased rumble as he continues on to the Welcoming Feast.
After staying like that for a while, Teddy’s hair slowly turned back to its usual turquoise. Harry relaxed and stood up to change.
“You talking. Cars outside...Er, people on the sidewalk. The creak of this bloody step,” he said as the wood made the sound at a shift in his weight. He dropped his gaze. It reminded him of the floorboards in Shrieking Shack. The broken windows. Staying under the Invisibility cloak as he watched-
Lucius Malfoy had completely ignored the innocence and genuine curiosity of his child and smacked him across the face before sending him to his room without dinner. The next day, he had only allowed Draco out
“Squib,” Harry corrected. “His parents were book collectors who travelled a lot. He moved here from the States three years ago,” he continued, gesturing for Malfoy to follow him. “Anyway, yeah, I think we have that one.”
“Yeah, yeah…” Draco fiddled with the leaves of the potted plant next to him. Talking about Potter with her was strange. “He’s...good.”
Draco didn’t realize that he’d been eating his food without saying a single word for about five minutes now until Potter laughed.
“Well enough to see you lot, yeah. I feel like… Like this time I can actually keep the momentum of meeting up with and talking to other people once I try again. So, I reckon I should. And I want to.”
Harry’s heart thudded wildly in his chest at the feel of Malfoy’s thumb against his lower lip. He looked at Malfoy, at the softness of his gaze and the curl of his lip, and felt the riot in his own chest unceasing. Nagging. Telling him,
Harry sat on the bed next to him, looking around the room. “I think Sirius would like this room being Teddy’s now.”
They continued to eat in comfortable silence, only breaking it to ask the other to pass the sauce or a paper napkin and to fight over the last dumpling. Draco would try to steal a few glances from time to time, but Potter would always meet his gaze, beaming at him, before Draco could look away.
Harry tore his eyes away, choking on his tea. He thumped a fist against his chest as he coughed violently.
“Oh, god.” Hermione must have noticed the shake in his words, because she immediately left her seat and crouched in front of Harry, putting her hands on his knees. “Hey, come on. Of course not.”
- is it really just harry's love language to send food to and feed his friends bc that's how he experienced friendship and family for the first time via the weasleys always feeding him and ron and hermione sending him pastries when he was locked up in his room? yes. but is it normal for harry to do that for someone he's only been friends with for a month? no. does that mean he fancies draco too!? we'll see :)
Harry tried. But his eyes kept drifting off to the side to fixate on a blank spot in the wall, little bits of memories sparking in his brain again.
He jumped out of bed and started pacing back and forth the room. Harry had always felt like he had barely got to live his life. How much more his parents? It wasn’t fair.
“Okay, fine.” She reached over the table to pinch him by the cheek and force him to look at her. “But would that be the worst thing? It’s a great job.”
Draco perked up, his brow furrowing at the worry in Potter’s voice. Was something wrong with Andromeda?
Harry took a breath. “I feel like this goes without saying seeing as I've been spending practically every day with you this past month. But I should say it anyway. I really appreciate your company. I really like being with you, being your friend. And it’s strangely helped me like myself more than I ever have. And
He couldn’t take his eyes off him. Potter looked different. His hair was longer and curlier, as if he had stopped attempting to brush it or have it cut. He had also grown a stubble. He wasn’t even skinny and lanky anymore. The hoodie he was wearing would’ve been baggy on him three years ago, but he’s put on some muscle since then. Not being on the run anymore and three years of non-stop Auror training would do that to you, Draco supposed.
Malfoy looked up at him, looking slightly startled. “Hah. Yeah. Andromeda and I had a bit of wine after she got Teddy ready for bed. She looked sleepy, so I offered. She just went up, actually.”
“I know you've moved on from Ginny and that you haven’t talked to her in months,” she said, interrupting him. “So, there are zero other reasons for you to seem so anxious and have that look on your face when we’re talking about your dating life here. You're not like this unless there's someone-”
Hermione leaned over and grabbed his hand. “We love you, Harry. I mean, we’re a family. So, of course, we were angry. But we were mostly scared. And sad.”
being a sap,” he complained, hoping Potter wasn’t paying attention to Draco’s hands, trembling from how much he was holding back right at that moment.
Potter shrugged, taking a seat. “A few very short-lived flings… Some dates and hookups here and there. All Muggles of course.”
Harry managed to laugh, but the uneasiness he could feel all over his body wasn’t completely gone. It was better, though. He watched his friends chuckle and shake their hands fondly at how lost they all seemed as they navigated this weird thing that was going to hang between them for a bit longer.
She snickered, shaking her head. “I have something in the back, I’ll go get it. Just promise me you won’t be riding that blasted bike of yours. Don’t want you coming back here in ten minutes after dropping one of my potted flowers in the middle of traffic again.”
There was a thud against the table as Potter accidentally nudged his glass over, getting water all over his shirt.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he could feel his tension easing away. He tended to forget that the war was further into his past than it felt and that forgiveness and perspective were vital aspects of people’s healing that he hasn’t gotten the hang of yet.
Draco is starting to pick up on signs that Harry might fancy him but tries to ignore it, the gang gets back together for a night of drinks and celebrations, and Harry says more that he planned to.
Harry felt his chest get heavy as she said that, but he nodded anyway. Looking at her fight back tears, he could feel a knot in his throat as all the guilt and shame he had been repressing started engulfing him. Harry hated this. He hated that he was looking at the girl he loved with the knowledge that he couldn’t keep pretending this was still a relationship.
He had started seeing Ron and Hermione from time to time again. He had even managed to attend a few Weasley gatherings, even with Ginny there.
“He said his friends always sent him pastries and stuff during the summer holidays when we were back in school. Maybe this is just something their lot does.”
"It changed when I took Teddy here for the first time. He was just a few months old then, but the way he crawled down the halls and filled the rooms with his first laughs made me realize that I could actually have happy memories here. I also figured that you’d prefer that I have the house and turn into something good rather than some stranger who wants to buy it just for the novelty of owning a famous ancestral home."
Harry poked him hard on the shoulder. "That’s not true. Hermione doesn't. And Ron, well,...he wants to try."
Andromeda patted him on the leg, looking apologetic, but Harry could tell she was also holding back a laugh. It was hard not to miss Tonks when Andromeda had the same sparkle in her eyes when she was amused.
She squeezed his arm. “Definitely. I don't know if it’s those meetings or something else, but...Whatever it is, I can tell you’re doing really good. And I’m happy for you.”
Snorting, Harry shook his head. “It’s fine. It’s about time anyway. I’ll see if she wants to meet up before then.”
“Well, you’re obviously colorblind if you thought those two shades were identical,” Malfoy countered.
“It’s like…” Harry straightened, starting to gesture in an attempt to grasp at words that would be enough to convey the warmth that was starting to spread in his chest the more he thought of him. “Seeing him like this... Constantly putting in the effort to be good and kind and self-aware after everything he’s been through and forced to believe? And succeeding at that every day? It was a reminder that no one has to be trapped as the person everyone else decided them to be all their lives.”
Harry smiled, suddenly remembering the first time Ron had tried to call him when Harry was staying at the Dursleys.
“He also told me about the good things you did. He said…He said you were like the heroes in the storybooks Aunt ‘Mione gave me,” he said, struggling more than usual with some of the r sounds of the words he said now that he was drifting off.
Draco was staring at his drink, but he could hear the shock in his voice. “Yeah. As the Potions teacher. I also meet up with Slughorn quite a bit during the holidays for theory work to prepare for it as well. McGonagall actually helped me get the St. Mungo’s job. The main work I do there is brew potions for the Healers. But I also had to choose extra work to specialize in, so I chose to help out Muggle-born kids. ”
Taking a break from the wizarding world was a good idea. No strangers gaping at him as he walked down the street. No Ministry officials guilting him into being part of big events for publicity. No more responsibilities. No more Boy Who Lived.
“My room and Sirius’ room have huge windows and don’t have any creepy paintings and decor stuck on the walls that I can’t tear down without the whole room getting destroyed … Also, Sirius has several pictures of his Hogwarts days on his walls. I reckon Teddy recognizes his dad in some of them. ”
This girl, however, was undoubtedly a Muggle. She had entered the store talking on her mobile and was wearing a jumper with a university logo on it.
Draco turned around and saw that he was leaning against the huge wooden wardrobe and panting. “I said to the left.
Harry was about to stand up to take the tape out of the player when Malfoy pointed to the big cans of paint at the corner of the room and asked, “What are those for?”
“Yes,” she stated with a sense of finality and a pointed look at Ron. “He’s Harry’s friend. And Teddy’s uncle. We can at least try, can’t we?”
“Definitely,” he answered, taking it from him and placing it in the box. He stared at the contents and hoped that Malfoy wasn’t judging him for how much of Sirius’ things he had decided to keep. “Well, I reckon that’s enough for tonight. I’m knackered.”
“Another bouquet for your girl?” Tina, the florist he had befriended through all his visits in the past years, asked. “She liked orchids, right?”
Malfoy let out a huff of amusement. “You out of all people should know how creative they are when it comes to spinning the same thing into a new story.”
“You're staring. Did you want to say something?” Malfoy asked as he continued to scrub at a dirty pot, glancing at Harry.
He smiled, nodding. “Yeah. I suppose I am. We still can’t meet up quite as much because their schedules are dreadful, and Hermione especially is always working. But it’s a start and-”
But before he could say it, there were descending footsteps on the staircase behind him. His head whipped around to see Malfoy.
Before he was aware of what he was about to do, Draco yelled “Oi, Potter!” from where he was standing.
Malfoy furrowed his brow, turning the sink off and drying his hands on a towel before turning to Harry. “Go ahead.”
He knew that he could no longer pretend that he didn’t know what this feeling was. And he felt like screaming or crying or laughing or
Lately, Harry’s dreams have been different too. His nightmares of running across Hogwarts as he felt bodies of students brushing his feet or of jets of green light hurtling towards him were replaced with what seemed like false memories. He couldn’t remember specifics; most of them were arbitrary, fleeting moments of different people. His parents. Sirius. Lupin. Dumbledore. Fred. Tonks.
He could already hear the clatter of pans and Andromeda’s singing from the kitchen. They both must have fallen asleep on the couch halfway through the fourth movie they had been watching. Potter had said it was a prequel to the trilogy they had just watched, Star Wars. The order in which they had watched the series was baffling to Draco, but he had figured it was best not to argue.
The way his heart fluttered in his chest terrified him. It was taking everything in him to fight the urge to take the rest of the day off, barge into the bookshop while Potter was working, and kiss him full on the mouth.
Draco grimaced at the thought of how painful it must be. “Easy there, sit still, let me…” He took his wand out and whispered an incantation as he dragged the tip from the right side of Potter’s neck, down to his shoulder, and all the way to his elbow.
The paper suddenly felt heavy in Harry’s hand, but he folded it anyway and kept it in his pocket. “Ginny.”
Harry grabbed another bundle of photos that was hiding underneath the junk. It was more memories that Sirius had captured. Many of them were in Hogwarts. He lingered on a photo of Remus in a brown cardigan, smiling begrudgingly at the camera as he was trying to study. Harry remembered wearing a similar cardigan for the first D.A. meeting. He remembered what his thought process had been back then: if he looked like Remus, he could teach almost as well as him.
He hadn’t been to any wizarding places. He had only responded to one of the dozens of letters Ron and Hermione had sent. If you asked him when was the last time he had even picked up his wand, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
It was hard to be in denial when he had once cut out pictures of the attractive players of Ireland’s Quidditch team from Seeker’s Weekly and put them up his wall before guiltily taking them down when he realized his father would not be happy with this. Or when he had spent most of Ravenclaw’s games staring at Roger Davies’ arse whenever Draco wasn’t playing. Or when he had drunkenly snogged Blaise Zabini in the first week of his fifth year, which led to two years of them secretly hooking up in broom closets and trophy rooms.
“And you’ve looked so much happier and more at ease these past few weeks…” She was looking down at her glass of wine, tracing the rim with her finger, but Draco could tell she was still watching him carefully from her periphery. “Humming to yourself in the morning, less jumpy, a spring in your step…”
“This alright?” he breathed out as he buried himself deep into the man beneath him, who was gasping and looking up at him through lidded eyes.
Potter cleared his throat. “Hey, do you want to watch a couple of movies? Today’s sort of been emotionally exhausting, and I feel like if I don’t put something on you’re gonna do whatever it is you and get me to talk more. Also, Ted’s collection is great,” he insisted, standing and walking to a large shelf of tapes next to the telly.
Harry could tell that Malfoy was already screening dozens of excuses in his head. "Asking was just a formality, by the way. Hermione is sort of demanding you be there. So that they can, you know. Make an effort to be friends with you too."
Draco wanted to feel angry at his mother. Wanted to ask why she was ruining a good thing. But he also knew that her concerns were valid. She was right. When it came to Draco’s dating life, she usually was.
It was strange that seeing him in that meeting weeks ago was so bizarre when Draco had already known that the people who lived in this house tied their lives together. The idea that maybe their worlds were always meant to collide again had never really crossed his mind before. It was hard to ignore it now, though.
Draco only had the moonlight and the glow of the outdoor lamps, but he could see how glassy Potter’s eyes were.
Draco nodded, pocketing his wand. “How’s your arm? Better?” he asked, desperate for a change of topic.
“I’m touched.” Draco felt less tense now that Potter was starting to sound like himself again. He released his grasp on Potter’s hand. As their hands brushed when he pulled back, Draco felt something stir in his chest. It was probably nothing.
“Yeah,” he said. “It also calms me down on bad days…And being in good shape when I’m expected to keep up with a four-year-old all day helps too.”
Talking over each other, Harry said, “What does that even mean?” as Ron clapped his hands together, muttering, “Oh, sure, babe, that clears things up.”
As she trailed off, Harry felt dizzy with all the information Hermione had just dumped on them, a multitude of feelings banging around in his head.
She trailed off. Draco knew what she had meant to say, but they don’t really talk about the trials much.
Then, there was a loud thud as his hand slipped and he fell hard on his shoulder, rolling onto his back.
“Oh, sorry Ted,” Astoria said, looking apologetic. “I actually need to go soon. I have work early tomorrow.”
He thought back to all the times Hermione visited Malfoy’s department when they all worked at the Ministry. Harry never questioned why, even though that was the reason he came to her to ask about him when Malfoy quit. Harry had always just assumed it was because she was friends with the woman Malfoy worked with. She certainly never corrected him. “You...You never mentioned it.”
Before Draco could get up, he noticed something glinting in Potter’s hand. It was a mirror shard reflecting light. The shard’s edges were covered in something dark and liquid. Draco squinted a little, just enough for him to see it was blood, coming from a long and deep gash on his palm.
Harry had always known he’d end up at St. Mungo’s eventually during his Auror career. He never expected, however, that it would happen just three weeks in.
Harry's worrying over Draco is driving him mad on top of missing him terribly. He's just not sure what to do about it.
Potter turned around, confusion on his face, as Draco walked up to him. “I haven’t heard that in years.”
Draco sat up in his bed with a jolt, sweating all over and feeling the tightness at the front of his pyjamas.
Draco chuckled. He then took off his blazer and hung it on the back of his chair as he undid the topmost buttons of his shirt.
Astoria was different. She was wearing denim overalls with a cropped pink t-shirt underneath and a flannel wrapped around her waist. Strands of her brown hair were sticking out and getting loose from her twin braids. She wore sparkly orange nail polish, which was chipped at the edges.
Malfoy was the first one to notice Harry. He looked up from the glass of wine he was drinking and smiled at the sight of him.
It helped that as Harry looked up at him, he saw the Malfoy he had gotten used to. Clothes neat and pressed and hair slicked back.
He found himself in the Great Hall again. Bodies lined up. Where was Remus? He couldn’t remember what he was wearing. He should remember what he was wearing. Was it a tweed jacket? No, that’s not right. How could he not remember? It was the last thing he wore. Maybe it was-
Draco studied the way Potter gazed back at him, feeling paralyzed just at the sight of the other boy looking at him so intently, lips parted and breathing still staggered from his workout. It was too much. He needed to say something.
The truth was that this caught Draco off guard. A small part of him had been worrying that remodeling the room was the only thing they could bond over other than Teddy himself. He now realized that it was sort of ridiculous to think so when most of the time they had been spending together was outside this room.
He pulled it out of his pocket and studied it. It glinted in the sunlight that slanted into the room from the window. Harry thought of all the junk in the room he had gotten rid of and how it made him feel lighter.
At this point, Harry would usually worry that she had recognized him. It’s not like he put any effort into disguising himself other than hiding his scar and letting his hair and stubble grow longer than he used to. He mostly just depended on the fact that it was a tiny, backstreet bookshop tucked between two low-key family-owned businesses far enough from wizarding neighborhoods.
It felt like being at the Weasley’s dinner table or at the Great Hall during breakfast before a Quidditch game again.
His throat finally clear, Harry just shrugged and fiddled with the string of his teabag. “What do you mean?”
Draco chuckled as he started unstoppering some of the ingredient bottles for the potion. “That’s true.”
It had happened so often that each instance had blurred together for Draco. He no longer knew which beating happened at a certain time. He couldn’t even remember when his father had first used the Cruciatus Curse on him. What he could remember, though, was the pain and the fear. Too vividly, at that.
“You alright?” she asked, sensing how tense he was. She planted a soft kiss on his shoulder. “This is what you’ve always wanted.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Not a lot of career opportunities for a former pureblood supremacist and the son of a convicted criminal.”
It felt like his words hit Harry right on the chest. Harry looked up at the man. “I guess… I guess that makes sense.”
Harry leaned against the doorframe of Sirius’ room after Malfoy left. It already looked a bit different. Not just cleaner but lighter, with all Sirius’ possessions packed neatly into the box they had left in the hallway. It was now a blank canvas for new, happy memories.
Potter, shirtless and wearing a rather fitted pair of exercise shorts, was doing press-ups with Teddy sitting on his back and laughing.
“Is it that obvious?” Harry said suddenly as he looked up at her, surprising himself as it tumbled out of his mouth.
“But thank you,” Potter added. He raised his wounded hand. “Not just for this, but also for… I don’t know. Whatever it is you’re doing that makes me want to actually talk about this rubbish. Merlin knows how you do it, but… Thanks.”
“Is it because you feel guilty for going after things you want that have nothing to do with being an Auror because you still feel like you owe the wizarding world this heroic image of you that they have?” slipped out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop himself.
“Yes, Draco, I am aware of who Harry Potter is.” She hopped off the stool to shake Harry’s hand. “Nice to meet you, Harry. I’ve heard a lot about you from this one,” she said, tilting her head towards Malfoy.
Malfoy’s eyes widened, and he pulled away. “Right, sorry. I forgot…” He cleared his throat, looking away for a few moments. “Er...Two things you can smell?”
There was a lull for a few moments. Harry expected Hermione to be the first to say something, but Ron finally spoke up.
Malfoy smiled sadly and shook his head. “Yeah, I… I get that. I still hate the person that I lost. But now, being angry at him feels strange. What am I supposed to do with this rage and bitterness now?”
Ron was glaring at him, his mouth agape and his fingers tightening around the neck of the wine bottle he was holding. Hermione took it from him, probably concerned he was going to throw it if she didn’t, and looked at Harry with a less hostile, but still distressed, expression.
Harry forced out a laugh. As he continued to watch Malfoy, noticing how he looked like he was glowing in the warm kitchen light, Harry
“Did you have a hard time finding the place?” Harry asked Malfoy as he led him to the living room. “Hermione put up a charm that makes anyone looking for my place lose all sense of direction until they’re like ten streets away from me. Shouldn’t affect people I’ve had over or invited after the charm was placed, but it can work funny sometimes…”
“This is the first one I’ve found without any witches or wizards who ended up recognizing me, Potter. It’s also the only one that doesn’t have any wizarding neighborhoods or shops nearby. Trust me, you’re not going to find another one you can go to anytime soon,” Draco insisted. “There are sessions on Sunday mornings as well, I think I’ll go to those instead. You can keep going to this one.”
The furniture was refurbished and shining like they were new, all moved to the right places. The bed was clean and soft, with thick blue sheets and comforters neatly made. One of the walls was covered in floating shelves, still empty but ready for Teddy’s books and toys. Light blue was painted all over the walls, making the room look like the sky on a nice summer’s day. The floor was covered in a carpet that was a darker shade of blue, almost like the night, and had a constellation pattern.
“That still doesn’t excuse the things Malfoy did,” Harry insisted, but the way Malfoy looked the night Dumbledore died started to flood his head as he said it. The terror on his face, the temptation when Dumbledore offered to welcome him to their side, the pain in his eyes. Harry was getting less and less convinced by the words he was telling Andromeda.
“Yeah, I-” his voice cracked before he could get the sentence out. He took a deep breath. “I… Merlin, I’m really sorry. To both of you. I...I really mean it when I say I’m going to do better this time.”
“I was going to give it to him after dinner, but I wanted him out of the room. In case you wanted to swear more. Andromeda would kill you.” He grabbed Potter by the arm he didn’t land on and his torso, feeling like his fingers were screaming at the touch of Potter’s bare waist, and guided him to a sitting position. “You’re such a clumsy mess.”
Draco smiled. “Yeah. The first months were tough because none of the staff or patients really trusted me… Which is definitely more than fair. But I earned their trust eventually and did quite a good job bonding with the patients, especially the Muggle-born kids… To be honest, it felt selfish at first… Like I was just doing it because of all the guilt. Soon enough, though, I accepted the fact I really do just like helping them and being skilled in something important and good.”
He closed his eyes tight and tried to shut out the thoughts. It worked for the first few minutes, but they were too much. They sounded like they were being yelled into his ear. His own voice in his head.
Her name was a mouthful, but calling her anything else didn’t feel right. Her last name was what he used to call Tonks. He didn’t want to call her ‘Dromeda either; that’s what Ted used to call her.
It’s not like he never zoned out before. It had just felt...different. It wasn’t that he had been distracted by his thoughts at the time. It was the opposite, really. Out of nowhere came the urge to just focus. On Malfoy’s face. And the way he was touching Harry. And the way he was staring back, unquestioning.
Harry nodded, thinking about how excited he was to visit Ron and Hermione after this meeting. It was starting to feel normal again after seeing them a few times the past month, but he still felt proud and warm about it. “Yeah, exactly.”
He looked over to the counter where Malfoy was seasoning the tray of cut-up vegetables like Harry had asked him to. Harry let himself watch Malfoy work, just for a few moments while he could.
He shrugged. “I knew the basics growing up because my aunt and uncle would make me cook in the mornings. But I only learned how to cook food that isn’t breakfast from Molly. I was going back and forth the Burrow and Andromeda’s during the first few months after the war ended. When I decided to really live on my own, Molly said she wouldn’t let me unless she was sure I wasn’t going to live off fast food takeaway and microwave meals.”
Losing track of his breathing, it started to shorten. Harry clasped his hands together, shaking and nails scratching at skin, and tried to focus on breathing again. He’s done this before. It’ll pass. Another 10 minutes, he figured miserably as the tightness all over his chest pressed on.
The man shrugged. “It’s just a process, mate. Besides, if you go about it this way and continue to trust yourself and the people around you, you end up with a support system that’s bigger than the one you started with, right?”
The dinner was mostly carried by Hermione and Malfoy talking about work. Documents she wanted him to go over, contact details to double-check, notes he had to owl to her. It was as if Harry hadn’t once watched Hermione punch Malfoy in the face when they were 13.
“I almost sold this whole place. Nearly took the first offer I got,” Harry found himself whispering into the empty room. He leaned against one of the bedposts. “It was too much, you know? Thinking about how you hated the childhood you experienced in these rooms, how the Order had you cooped in this place, how we hid here, terrified for our lives when we were on the run... Everything about this house just..revolted me.
Hermione laughed, and Harry rolled his eyes, kicking Ron underneath the table. “I’m serious! I think you two could be friends if you tried.”
She shrugged. “He didn’t want me to say. And I wasn’t about to. I mean, for the longest time thought he was just trying to get on my good side before I realized there was really nothing in it for him...”
The reflection of the warm fluorescent light of the living room in Potter’s green eyes looked like golden specks. The contour of his cheekbones and jaw were more prominent than they had ever been when they were teenagers. His eyelashes were long and dark, brushing against the lens of his glasses.
“Oh, no, don’t worry, dear. I’m having a horrid migraine. I just drank what was left of the potion you made for me yesterday. I was waiting until it took effect before I went back to bed.”
It made sense now. Harry hasn’t picked up or even looked at a single Daily Prophet issue for years. He hated seeing his face on the paper every other day. Everything from date nights with Ginny to him visiting his parents’ grave was considered front-page news.
But now, in hindsight, he was realizing more and more how wrong he was. As he drank his tea and waited for the oven to preheat, he thought back to all the signs his mind just didn’t pick up.
He sipped his wine as he thought about how this shouldn’t be such a big deal. Maybe he was just overthinking it.
So, coming out a year after his father was sent to Azkaban wasn’t as hard of a decision as he had always thought it would be. With most of wizarding society already hating him, he had figured that this would make little difference to his life. Draco had shrugged off every insulting headline and intrusive candid photo that made its way to the pages of the Daily Prophet each time he was seen with a new bloke. It hasn’t mattered to him in a long time.
Draco rolled his eyes, realizing that Andromeda was worrying about him too much again. It’s not that Draco didn’t have any friends. He’s met many new people since he started working at the hospital. It’s just that he just preferred being alone nowadays. “Andro-”
She scrunched up her face. “Right. Okay, maybe the Malfoy of it all is another story. But he’ll come around if you do choose to tell him.”
He nodded, a smile on his face and a sincerity in his eyes that made Harry want to just snog him senseless at that very second. “Of course.” Then, his eyes dropped. “Your fingers.”
Before Draco could articulate what to reply, Potter was gone. As he watched the bike disappear around the corner, Draco shook his head. This was definitely not how he expected his Tuesday night to go.
Harry nodded slowly. He didn’t want to be too honest about how much he wanted it, but at this point, it must be obvious to Malfoy.
"He’s not sick or anything, don’t worry,” Malfoy said, closing his book and putting it aside. “He was just really tired when he got here. Andromeda said she just lost track of time and let him stay up way too late last night."
He tried to raise his arm again, successfully this time, but his face still crumpled up in pain. “A little.”
“Since the last case I worked on. Dolohov. I got him cornered, but when it was time to stun and arrest him, I just froze. Ever since, the idea of trying to do magic has just felt so... exhausting to me. Like, I
He frowned. “You know, if you aren’t buying that I actually hate my father and everything he did… Or that I regret everything
He was right. Harry would have never moved into the place if any part of it still reminded him too much of Sirius’ terrible parents. The place was now brighter and cleaner than it had ever been. Hermione had transformed all the furniture into more modern-looking pieces. All the dark wallpaper had been replaced with white paint. He had torn down the walls with portraits of Sirius’ relatives on them because the permanent sticking charms wouldn’t budge.
Draco made his way to the living room and plopped down on the sofa, placing his wand on the coffee table. He thought of turning on the telly because there must be no way either him or Potter could hold a conversation for more than five minutes before it got awkward. Then, he realized he couldn’t even remember how to turn the thing on.
“Have you...er...seen anyone since?” Draco asked before he could stop himself. It was the first time she had come up in their conversations in a while, and Draco wanted a reason to bring up what he’d been wondering.
That was all it took for Ron and Hermione’s tense expressions to soften a little. Harry loved them so much.
Jasmine, the facilitator, nodded encouragingly. “It can be anything. How you’re feeling, whether you’ve been seeing your friends… Anything,” she prompted.
Harry leaned against the counter next to sink, chewing as he watched Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyes were narrowed in concentration, a few small creases appearing on his forehead, and his bottom lip was curled between his teeth. Harry wondered if Malfoy was aware that he bit his lip when he was focusing on something. He also wondered why he couldn’t look away.
Harry had expected Astoria to look like all the Slytherins he knew from school. Malfoy may have changed, but he still dressed the way he - and all his friends - did back in Hogwarts whenever they were out of uniform: Dark or neutral monochrome outfits. A rotation of plain button-downs and turtlenecks tucked in with an expensive belt. Always with a blazer on. Hair perfectly in place at all times. Shoes? Leather and shined.
were really hurt when you went months without talking to us. A couple of months ago, I would have never guessed we’d be seeing you this much again after a year of seeing you once in two months or so.
“Front page for seven days straight, huh?” Harry asked, breaking the silence. “How many ways could they paraphrase ‘Draco Malfoy is Gay,’ exactly?”
“Deal with it. This friendship is obviously important to you. Just...keep being his friend until your feelings tide over.”
“Harry,” Ron muttered through his teeth, his ears going red. “You have like 10 seconds to explain what’s going on right now.”
“And it’s not like you’ll be alone while Andromeda entertains everyone. You’ll have Weasley and Granger.”
“It’s nothing. Just don’t be an idiot and forget your wand again,” Draco quipped, hoping Potter couldn’t see how red he was. “Hey, can I ask you something?”
Astoria smiled as she finished pooling all the pink blocks together. “Yeah! For Christmas. I know it’s really early, but I knew Andromeda gets tons of commissions. Just wanted to make sure I could get Daph something special. Haven’t seen her in a while because of her job.”
“So, what’s the painting for? The one you commissioned from Andromeda,” Harry asked her as they sat on the floor, sorting the blocks by color at Teddy’s request. Teddy was behind them, rummaging through his trunk and trying to choose which dragon should live in the castle they had just finished building before making a new one.
“Has she… Has she mentioned Malfoy? I haven’t seen him around lately and… she worked him with him so...”
“I... Nothing. Sorry, I don’t know,” he mumbled as he looked away, fiddling with the shard in his pocket even more. But when he felt Malfoy’s hand on his wrist, he returned his gaze to him.
“I was looking for this old Potions book,”  Malfoy said, straightening. “But now that I’m here…” he murmured, gesturing to the shelves and shelves of Muggle books.
“What the-” Draco hastily took the mirror shard out of Potter’s hands and placed it on the step below them. “What
- talk to me about the fic or anything drarry  @ ginnywcasleys on tumblr!!!! u can also pressure me to write and update lmao i probably need it
Malfoy looked like how he usually did. He was wearing an expensive set of emerald robes with silver trimmings. His hair was slicked back and looked almost stiff. However, on his face, instead of the sneer Harry had gotten used to the past seven years, were soft, scared eyes and a mouth slightly open, as if he was trying to say something but was too afraid to.
“Yeah, I do,” he whispered, his eyes returning to the photograph. “I just didn’t expect that you’d have-”
“Oh, she’s a magizoologist! She’s sort of been everywhere, but the past year she’s been working on a project in Sweden at the dragon sanctuary. Romania’s next on her-”
“Yeah, apparently he returned to school to finish his last year and get his N.E.W.T.s…” Hermione trailed off and finally looked up, her brows furrowed. “Why are you suddenly interested?”
Draco clutched the container full of food that Andromeda had instructed him to give to Potter on his way to work. He knew he could have Apparated immediately to Thornton’s Books, the bookshop Potter works at, but he felt like he needed a walk. So, from Andromeda’s doorstep, he Apparated to a spot a few streets away from the store. As if the extra five minutes would give him enough time to process what he was feeling earlier this morning before seeing Potter again.
After awkward greetings and the most excruciating small talk Harry has had to endure, there he was, eating dinner with Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy. It was a ridiculous sight, really. If Ron hadn’t been shooting glares at Malfoy every few seconds or if there were a bit less uncomfortable silences between conversations, the scenario would have even been funny to Harry.
“You never asked about how my dinners with the Malfoys went, Harry,” she said with a sympathetic smile. “Nor did I think you’d like to hear about them without you bringing it up first. I know it bothers you, despite you acting like it doesn’t for my sake.”
Draco looked at him. “You’re going to get him a duplicate of everything he already owns at Andromeda’s, aren’t you?”
Harry knew that it was a lie, what with everything he had shared about his father in the meetings. It still obviously affected him. “You don’t get shit about it at work, right?”
“I never really gave you two an actual, full apology,” he continued. “And this is...what, a year late? But saying it now is as good as I can do at this point. So, I’m sorry. I'm sorry that I just disappeared, and that you didn't hear from me for months. I just...I spiraled into a terrible episode and the sick comfort I felt when I was alone and away from the rest of the world just got out of hand…”
He jogged down the stairs, already preparing himself for another smug comment from Andromeda about how much time he and Malfoy were spending together and how she was to thank. But, when he opened the door, Ron and Hermione’s cheery faces greeted him.
“It’s actually a lot cleaner than I anticipated,” Malfoy said, taking a swig out of his beer that Harry hadn’t noticed he had brought with him.
Whatever it was seemed like a lost memory, too faded and obscure to grasp, that sat in his chest rather than his mind. All he knew was that he hasn’t felt it in a long time. Not since...
- hey author, why did u change all the chapter titles to carly rae jepsen lyrics? bc all i ever do while writing this fic is listen to her songs abt yearning and love. is this fic heavily influenced by This Love Isn't Crazy and Heartbeat? maybe.
Draco could feel how frozen his feet were to the floor and became aware of how dry his throat had suddenly gotten. The universe was just toying with him at this point.
As soon as they found themselves on the house’s porch, the door flew open. Andromeda already had Muggle clothes on and a bag in her hand.
Ron, raising up a bottle of wine, grinned. “You said we could come over anytime, and we were obviously going to take that literally. But we brought wine!”
As soon as Potter said that and smiled at him, the sort of smile no one would deny was kind and light and
They walked down the hallway to open the door that had a small silver nameplate with ‘Sirius” engraved on it in cursive. Harry felt for the light switch and turned it on.
Potter’s teasing smile started to fade away, his expression now softer, more unsure. But he didn’t look away either. His green eyes looked like they were searching for something, trying to understand something, that he wasn’t aware of yet.
“Remus made an offhand comment once about how whenever he saw me and Ginny talking in the distance sometimes, he had to do a double-take because we reminded him of my parents.”
like the rest of the world. You're my best mates. And I’m sorry. I know I can't do anything right now but promise I won't do that again to you. But I
He kept his eyes open, but the images in his head continued. Less vivid, but still there. The Forbidden Forest. Endless trees. Then, black robes. A green light.
Harry followed his gaze to see a cluster of posters that featured Muggle women posing seductively in bikinis. He laughed, shaking his head. “Not the most child-friendly decor, I suppose.”
A look of realization dawned on Potter’s face. “Merlin. Never mind. Sorry. That was a rather stupid thing to ask.”
“Harry? You alright?” Ginny, who had been at his bedside reading magazines all afternoon, asked. She was still in her Quidditch robes from the practice that she left as soon as she heard Harry had been injured. “I mean, you know, given the whole hit-with-a-curse thing. You look like you’re thinking way too hard again.”
She gave him a dismissive wave of the hand. “It’s fine, Ron. I obviously don’t completely trust him yet, but I do think he’s changed. And I trust Harry and Andromeda.”
Draco blushed, but he just shrugged. “It’s nothing. Been studying this for years, and it’s the least of what I’m expected to know if I’m going to actually
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh, fuck you!” he called after him as Ron walked out of the kitchen, chuckling.
She smiled at him hesitantly - the way most people he didn’t talk to at work did - and left the room.
- thank you so much for the comments and kudos!!! they rly mean the world to me and always push me to write. im trying to be better at replying faster i swear ksjdfks
There was officially nothing left to do with Teddy’s room. The kid loved it. But here Malfoy was, still coming over like he usually did.
“Oh, alright,” Harry said, relieved. “Did she fall asleep while watching cartoons with him and woke up to find him still awake at midnight?”
The door opened and Harry’s eyes flew open. Through the mirror, he could see Draco Malfoy standing behind him.
Teddy has been loving sleeping in the same room as his godfather whenever he stayed over, and Potter was more than happy to oblige. But they both knew that he couldn’t baby and share a room with Teddy forever.
Before Harry could cut in, Malfoy answered, “Oh, not really. I’m here almost every day, so whenever Potter has him, I-”
Before he could finish the sentence, the customer stepped out from the bookshelves and started making his way to the counter. He didn’t know what Draco Malfoy was doing here, but he found himself feeling grateful anyway.
believe you. That’s… That’s what I wanted to say,” Harry said with an earnestness that even he was surprised by.
As he stared at him, Harry almost missed the slightest brush of Malfoy’s thumb against his knuckles. He found himself thinking he liked the way Malfoy’s skin felt. It was a weird thought. Harry had never been a tactile person, but these little touches felt charged with comfort.
Potter smirked. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you just want to work with me because you’d miss me otherwise.”
What was even harder to believe was how easy talking to Malfoy was. He didn’t know what it was, but there was something about him that actually made Harry want to volunteer information about his feelings for the first time in a long time.
A tiny part of Draco knew that ditching Astoria at the club and shagging the first bloke that caught his eye was not the answer to this, but it didn’t matter.
“Not my boyfriend,” he said, exasperated, but feeling a brief hum of excitement at the fleeting thought of the idea. He took a deep breath.
“I’m done for, I think.” Draco leaned against the doorframe of Astoria’s bedroom as she sat in front of her dressing table.
He no longer felt paralyzed at loud, sudden sounds, and he no longer had trouble breathing whenever he found himself too deep into his memories of the war. Yet, there was still a heavy weight he was carrying every day in his chest that wouldn’t go away and his wand had been stored away in a cupboard since he resigned as if magic itself was the direct cause of all this pain.
Potter smiled, but it faded away in moments. “Really, though. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m scared of the wizarding world in general right now. But unless I end up with Ginny again, which I doubt, I can’t imagine being with anyone who knows who I am.”
He turned back to Malfoy and saw that his eyes were a tad bit glassy as he continued to watch the colors of Teddy’s hair change in their photo.
By midnight, they had stripped down all the wallpaper (Harry couldn’t believe the number of loopholes to permanent sticking charms that the Blacks hadn’t thought of) and cut around the pictures Harry wanted to keep, sanded and patched the walls, and got rid of most of the rubbish in the room.
“It’s fine, mother. It’s just a little crush. Nothing more.” Draco didn’t know just how deep his feelings ran. But he knew he was lying when he said it.
Draco decided to ignore how the question made it sound like he and Potter were a couple of six-year-olds who were forced to be friends. “Yeah… We do.”
A few dragon stories in, Teddy’s bedroom door opened, and Andromeda stepped in. “Teddy, dear, time for bed. Come, you need to have a bath.”
“A kitchen and dining room?” Harry finished, looking around the huge space that was mostly bare except for a workbench, a few cupboards full of tools and bike parts, and the bike itself. It was the only room on the ground floor and he had hated how huge the old kitchen and dining room were, so deciding where to keep the bike was a no-brainer. “Yeah.”
“Oh, shut up,” Harry mumbled, trying to keep his hand from trembling in Malfoy’s and thankful that Malfoy was too preoccupied with healing him to notice the effect he was having on Harry.
“Ah, yeah…,” Malfoy murmured as he ran his hand across the cover. “Flourish and Blotts didn’t have it, so... Thanks.”
He snorted. “And say what? ‘Hi professor. Sorry for responding a year late. I was having a crisis. Can I please still have the job even though I had a mental breakdown that has left me unable to use magic without spiralling into an anxiety attack? Thanks.’”
The last person I lost died around four years ago. So, it’s strange doing this, seeking support and everything, now. I lived a pretty hectic life. For a long time, a lot of people depended on me to be someone I was never ready to be. So, I became that person. It was only last year when I decided that… That I felt like I could step back. For the first time, I felt like I could take some time for myself without the world - or, er, the people around me, I mean - going up in flames.
The woman chuckled through her tears. “Thank you. That… That makes sense. It’s just unfair. I finally allowed myself to despise her. Then, she suddenly drops dead and the emotions get less clear again. She was a bad person, but somehow, I’m the one stuck with all this hate and bitterness and sadness.”
The four-year-old nodded, tears streaming down his cheeks, before burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco just grunted in response, thinking of the night before in Andromeda’s kitchen. He remembered brushing crumbs off Potter’s lip before he could stop himself. He remembered the alarms ringing in his brain as he did it. Most of all, he remembered the stunned, soft expression of Potter’s face as it had happened. And the way he had looked like he could also hear the rest of the world slowly humming to silence in the span of those few seconds.
“A bit sore, but a lot better. Thank you,” he said, punctuating his thanks by touching Draco lightly on the wrist.
“Ginny,” he mumbled to himself, still confused but also reluctantly nursing a tiny inkling that was barely a full answer at the back of his head.
Thank you for the comments and all the kudos! they rly help motivate me to keep writing so yall are great huhu. Next chapter will be out in a week or two!
Draco’s heart started to speed up a bit at that. He dropped his gaze, trying to appear preoccupied with his food as he poked at it with his fork. There was no way he could look Potter in the eye right now without his face betraying anything he’d rather keep to himself. “Yeah. You will.”
Draco smiled. “I’ll take that as a compliment. I had some selfish motives, though. I was getting those attacks too. So, I wanted to figure out what was going on with me.”
Draco felt a drop in his stomach. He knew how that felt, and the many times he has proven himself right. The number of blokes who were with him because they were curious about the mysterious Draco Malfoy was disheartening. Boys that actually fancied him for him were too few and far apart. And even then it never lasted long enough to matter.
“Not as much now, but yeah. I mean, all the flashbacks and anxiety… Obviously, it’s because we all went through fucked up shit. But it’s also because I’m terrified of who I had to be as a kid. And terrified because people still see me that way. Sometimes, I still feel like every bloody decision I make that doesn’t align perfectly with who the world still expects to be can mean life or death like it did during the war.
“You’re going to complain about free food now?” Andromeda quipped without looking up from what she was doing. “Also, Draco, dear, don’t be rude,” she added, gesturing to the brunette girl who was sitting at the other end of the kitchen table.
Then, he saw the forest again. Ron walking away, disappearing with a crack. And then a snake lunging at him. And then a snap of a wand. A pair of snake-like eyes.
That seemed to have sobered Ron, even just a bit. He sighed, settling his hands on his hips and staring at the floor. “I don't know, mate…”
“I believe you,” Harry repeated. “I believe that you’re not who you were years ago. And I know about all the good you’re doing now… I just wanted to say that. For what it’s worth.”
“What? It’s comfortable. Not gonna throw out perfectly valuable Quidditch merchandise just because we broke up.”
Harry took a deep breath. “No, no. He would have found out eventually. Just a tad bit hard to tell a child to always behave when he knows you broke into Gringotts and fled on the back of a dragon like a bloody hypocrite.”
Harry wanted to tell Ron that it was okay. That he has been pretty terrible at being a friend lately. But Ron sounded tired, and he knew that Ron would stay on the line for hours convincing Harry that he did nothing wrong. So, Harry didn’t argue. “Anyway, I should really go now. I have work tomorrow.”
A younger girl that Draco recognized from the reception desk entered the room with a parcel in her hands. “Draco Malfoy?”
“Good. That’s...good.” Harry let out a breath, and it felt like he’s been holding it since the evening before.
Harry nodded at him, unsure of how to greet him, and Malfoy nodded back. The doors of the lift slid open, and despite being repulsed at the thought of standing in a small, enclosed space with Malfoy, he stepped in.
Draco Malfoy didn’t have a good childhood. In the public, Lucius had been a doting father who was proud of his son. It was never like that whenever his family was behind closed doors or beyond everyone else’s earshot.
Harry wanted to tell her that that’s what he was scared of. But he just shrugged. “I wouldn’t know who to trust, much less be in love with, ‘Mione.”
Still, after a few months, the freedom hadn’t been enough for him to ignore how miserable his mother was living alone in the manor. So, he had convinced her to sell it and move in with him.
Harry just stared at him, unnerved at how Malfoy had just stood there casually, describing the past eight months of Harry’s life with startling accuracy like it was no big deal. “It’s… It’s nothing, Malfoy.”
Steps creaked behind him, and he turned around. It was Hermione, her coat back on and looking at him apologetically. “I need to make sure he’s okay…”
“Oh, nonsense! You should stay the night as well. Teddy misses you, and you were going to come over tomorrow morning anyway.”
He even did all he could to make the place feel smaller and homier. The living room used to take up the entire first floor. With Hermione and Ginny’s help, he had managed to build a kitchen and dining room on the floor as well. The old kitchen and dining room on the ground floor had been converted to makeshift garages where he could work on the bike and park it when he couldn’t leave it outside.
Absentmindedly forming the base of the new castle, Harry watched as Astoria patiently answered all of Teddy’s questions. She even threw in a few stories here and there, her hands waving around as she seemed to get caught up in what she was saying as well. Teddy laughed and gasped, his hair switching colors more rapidly at his excitement.
Harry and Malfoy had two boxes by the pile: one for things to keep and another for the ones to throw away. They mostly stay silent as they sorted, except to make jokes about some of Sirius’ more questionable clothing or when Malfoy had to ask Harry if it was okay to throw something out.
Before he could reach his closet, there was a tap on the window. Harry jumped, but then saw it was just the Malfoys' owl again.
“You sound well,” Ron said in a voice so soft and relieved that it made Harry’s heart ache with the realization of just how much he really missed him and Hermione.
“Does it still hurt?” Draco asked, scooting closer to him. Their knees were touching now, but he found that he didn’t really mind.
Harry smiled politely at the girl who was now biting her lip and tilting her head to the side. “If you’ll excuse me…”
“You’re being dramatic,” Hermione said to Ron, rolling her eyes. “Malfoy and I aren’t even friends, really.”
A silence followed, but it wasn’t awkward like Draco expected. It felt comfortable. Like they were just sitting and taking in the fact that they understood each other. Draco looked at Potter, who looked the most at peace Draco has ever seen him, and figured he felt it too.
This resolve only lasted until he found himself getting two orders of takeaway from a Chinese restaurant instead of one and Apparating to Thornton’s Books. The moment Potter had seen him, he had immediately put up the Lunch Break sign on the window and grinned so wide that Draco’s heart felt like combusting.
But he still liked his solitude. He still only ever saw his friends once a month at the most, which was usually when Hermione and Ron would force him out Grimmauld Place. Whenever Ron managed to drag him to the Weasleys for someone’s birthday, he still felt welcomed like family, but it was also too overwhelming.
Harry carefully placed the photo in the box of items he was keeping. “The thought comforted me for a few years after the war. But now that we’ve broken up… Yeah, it’s weird.”
And that isolation… There’s been ups and downs. I expected that. But I didn’t really expect to be confronted with all the grief I’d been suppressing. I wasn’t even aware I was suppressing any grief at all. I thought I
“Three years of Auror training… You’d think some of those courses would be dedicated to teaching those arseholes to be decent to other human beings.”
Harry followed Malfoy’s gaze to see the edges of his nails bleeding slightly. It was only then that he realized he’d been picking at the skin around it. “Oh. Yeah, I just-”
“I…” Harry started, but his tongue felt lost in his mouth. "Can you let me be honest for a moment without you making fun of how nauseating and sentimental this is going to sound?” he found himself asking.
Harry shook his head. “S’not your fault. I should have told them we were friends. I was just scared of what they’d say if I told them it was easier being with-” he cut himself off, looking away. “I just...Yeah.”
By the time he laid Teddy on the bed, the kid had fallen asleep again. Harry put a blanket over him and sat on the edge of the bed gently playing with his hair until he seemed less tense.
“Oh sure, of course,” the girl said giggling. “We can talk some other time.” She slid the receipt, with a phone number now scrawled on it, across the counter and turned around to leave.
She squeezed his hand. “Look, we’ll talk soon, okay? It’ll be fine. I just need to go after Ron right now. Will you be okay?”
He smiled awkwardly. As Harry thought of ways to make her leave while she kept talking to him, he spotted movement behind one of the bookshelves. He felt relief as he realized there was another customer in the shop.
“You don’t carry your wand with you anymore. You ride that death trap of a bike everywhere instead of Apparating. You’re out of breath from cleaning and moving furniture around because you did all this without magic,” Malfoy listed off, gesturing around the room to punctuate his last point.
Potter downed his drink, shaking his head. “No, you just… caught me off guard. But, you’re right. Christ, how do you do that?”
At that, Harry felt like his chest was suddenly taking up too much of his body, and he didn’t know why.
“It’s… It’s alright. I can hardly call it a loss, right? Besides, I’ve made some friends at work. Like Astoria Greengrass from school.”
Potter rolled his eyes, but gave a small smile in defeat. “Fine. Yes, I know it was an anxiety attack. Hermione was the one helping me with them before I, you know, practically disappeared.”
“I... Okay.” Harry set his glasses down and ran his hands all over his face, unsure of how to feel. “Merlin, do you think Ron knows? Do you think it’ll bother him?”
Harry couldn’t place how she did this when he was never close to being this transparent with his best friends anymore. Maybe it was because he never really got to know her until after the war, so she never reminded him of his life back then. Whatever it was, he liked her company and trusted her.
At the center was the biggest portrait. It was him with his parents. Teddy must have only been a few days old then. He was being cradled in Tonks’ arms as Remus planted a kiss on the top of his head. His hair was pink like his mother’s.
Harry frowned. “Reckon it’ll be a problem? I know McGonagall and the other teachers can be old school sometimes, but there’s no way-”
great,” Harry mumbled, grinning at him as he took the plate. He gripped tight, not wanting to drop it as his fingers started to feel restless from all the adrenaline that was coursing through him.
Harry rubbed the heel of his palm against his forehead, closing his eyes for a bit. “Look, he’s Teddy’s uncle. We were bound to cross paths and be in each other’s lives eventually! Besides, he’s been...He’s actually been really good for him.”
Harry stood up and rushed out after him. By the time he reached the ground floor, though, Ron was gone, and the front door was open. “
“Oh, no… I spent the night at Andromeda’s to stay with Teddy because she had to keep her nephew company at the Muggle hospital. Minor accident. Everyone’s alright, she said.”
“Besides, I almost cut myself on that thing again the other week. Properly best for it to be rubbish.”
Ron smiled and took her hand to kiss the back of it. “No problem,” he said, before walking out the room.
Draco knelt next to Potter, peering at the shoulder he landed on. “Is your shoulder okay? You landed on it pretty hard with your arm in a weird position.”
Before Andromeda could reply, they saw Teddy’s head peeking out from the kitchen doorway. “You said Uncle Dwaco?” the boy asked, yawning and still clutching the stuffed puppy he slept with every night.
“No, Harry, stay. Please. We don’t have to talk about that. I- I was wrong. I’m sorry, it was dumb.” She looked up at him, a sympathetic expression on her face that made it obvious she didn’t believe what she was saying at all.
Draco kissed her on the cheek. “Were you waiting up for me?” He pulled up a stool and sat next to her.
Hermione and Ron continued complaining about their jobs, and Harry watched them, amused. He sipped at his cup of tea and thought of how it felt like he was in the Gryffindor Common Room again, listening to Hermione complain about a class curriculum or Ron go on about an essay he doesn’t want to start.
Something was stirring in Harry that felt too heavy and too big to just sit at the back of his mind. All he knew was that he had to keep his eyes on him.
“Oh… Okay then. Thanks,” Harry said, slowly nodding. He got up and started leading Malfoy to and up the stairs. “Why are you doing this?”
“You’re just dizzy and zoning out. Must have overexerted yourself,” he said in a tone as sure as he could manage despite the fact he was confused too. What
After the meeting, as Draco was exiting the building, he saw Potter a few yards away from him standing next to a motorbike. He felt weird, having heard all that from him today. He would bet that Potter wouldn’t have said all that with Draco in the room if he hadn’t been desperate for support and recovery.
She beamed at Draco. “That was very sweet of you, darling. You’re usually too anxious to look after him by yourself overnight.”
Snapping out of his thoughts, Draco cleared his throat. “Sorry. I was just trying to remember a spell." He grabbed his wand and tapped Potter’s palm thrice, whispering the incantation for a numbing charm. “Better?”
“Oh, wait, there’s actually one more picture left,” Harry suddenly remembered as he spotted one nail left on the wall. He walked over to the desk drawer where he had kept it after he and Andromeda had found the perfect frame for it.
Malfoy looked at the photo, speechless and thumb rubbing against the edges of the silver frame. In the picture was Malfoy asleep on the couch with Teddy on his chest dozing off as well. He was running his hand through his nephew’s locks in his sleep, Teddy’s hair shifting with every stroke. Blue. Pink Green. Blue. Pink. Green.
Harry tried not to run away at the thought of having Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy at the same dinner table. But, he figured that if these were all people he wanted in his life, it was going to have to happen sooner later.
Ron scoffed. “This is Draco Malfoy we’re talking about. Anything short of punching that git in the face is already too friendly for me. But if you two say the bloke’s alright, then I guess I’ll have to wait and see, won’t I?” he said the last few words through his teeth.
Harry had found himself feeling relieved at the idea of not having to report to missions for next month before the guilt rushed in. He was the saviour of the wizarding world that everyone put on a pedestal, and here he was, thrilled at the idea of not being expected to protect and save anyone.
Draco smiled at the thought but shook his head. “It’s alright. I have to head back to my place and change for work. I technically have the morning shift this month, but I just took the morning off because I promised Andromeda I’d come over for brunch.”
you! Now that prick can stop calling me useless when I tell him I can’t give him his favorite pain relief potion.”
“This bookshop is just the most charming thing,” she practically cooed. “Have you worked here long?”
you forgot that the group you gave me was the same group Draco Malfoy is in?!” Harry was sitting on Andromeda Tonks’ kitchen table the next morning, trying not to be upset at the lack of concern she was showing at the utter strangeness of the situation. “When are you ever even talking to him?!”
He heard someone in the room call for Ron. Ron muttered an apology and patted Harry’s back reassuringly before leaving.
Malfoy shrugged. “If you can’t be in there alone, I can help.” He stood up, already taking his jacket off.
Nonetheless, the sadness was there, and he carried it with him every day with the rest of the tangled up emotions he was left with.
Harry shook his head in disbelief at how much Andromeda thought she needed to help a couple of 22-year-olds make friends.
“Okay, okay… Good.” Harry lets out a nervous laugh, meeting her gaze. “You never answered my question.”
"Anyway, yeah. Teddy’s wonderful. He’s going to fill this room with good memories. The kind you deserved back then…”
Harry sat cross-legged next to Ginny on her bed, gripping the letter from the Department of Magical Law Enforcement tightly. He, Ron, and Hermione had opened the letters together earlier that morning, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off it. “Can you believe it?”
“So, yeah,” he mumbled as he finished telling them about finishing Teddy’s room the day before. “I was playing with him in it before his grandmother came to pick him up this morning, and it just feels so much lighter. I mean, it already did once I first threw all the rubbish away and started working on it. But now that it’s really, officially, his, it’s just a lot clearer just how much he can transform it into something...good. And happy.”
When he entered, he saw Malfoy in mid-conversation with Andromeda, who was transferring food onto a platter, and a petite girl with dark brown hair in twin braids. She looked familiar, but he wasn’t sure where he knew her from yet.
“I believe Harry,” Hermione suddenly said, breaking her silence almost in a whisper. Her brows were furrowed, and she started fumbling with the label of the wine bottle, picking at it in the edges.
“What a nightmare,”  Malfoy replied instantly, but there was a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
Malfoy scooted around the pile, which was barely a pile anymore with only a few stray items left, getting closer to Harry and placing a comforting hand on Harry’s knee. “You’ll get the hang of it again. It’ll be easier.”
“You know, just because I said I believed you were a good person now, doesn’t mean you’re any less irritating.”
“I wish I could, but I promised mother I’d spend time with her tomorrow. I guess I haven’t been home that much.”
Harry tries to figure out what it was about Malfoy.  As they grow closer, Harry starts to realize that there was something about them that made it feel different from all the other friendships he had. He just doesn't know what that means exactly.
He had decorated it the way he wanted to: something more modern and sleek after years of living in a manor crowded with ancient artifacts and tacky heirlooms. He had brought a string of one-night-stands home, feeling more thrilled by the thought that there was no one else home to judge who he fucked than by the meaningless sex itself. Draco had even taken pleasure in doing mundane things alone like laundry and cooking, sort of as a quiet celebration of his normalcy.
She scrunched up her nose. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t put off checking up on you ‘til the morning. Also, I was a bit concerned. You were gone from eight in the morning to midnight. You’ve never spent that much time out of the house unless it’s for work,” she said with an accusing look on her face.
Draco shrugged as he undid the twine that tied up the packaging. Inside was a red pastry box with a swirly white pattern on it and a card that said “Malfoy” on it. He turned the card over.
“Okay, that’s fair,” Potter said before taking another gulp of his drink. “You know… The work you’re doing at St. Mungo’s… It’s pretty great.”
“Oh, what’s it called? We have a lot of non-Muggle stuff in the backroom. The owner, Mr. Thornton, has this personal collection of rare books that he wants to get rid of.”
Swatting her hand away, he sighs. “If I accept the offer, I’ll just be stuck in this room eight hours a day. No more talking to patients and helping the Muggle-born kids that end up here. I want something more hands on. I want to teach.”
“You talk about the bike the way my friends do. It’s a perfectly normal mode of transportation, thank you very much,” Harry replied, throwing the towel he was using over his shoulder.
Draco’s heart started speeding up, and with panicked eyes, his head whipped to Astoria who had already opened the box and taken one of the chocolate cupcakes out.
Draco couldn’t bring himself to be part of the chorus of “Hi Harry” that followed. This was all too bizarre. He couldn’t even remember the last time he said that name out loud.
“Harry, thank y-” she cut herself off as she realized Draco was standing next to him. “Oh, Draco, sweetheart, you’re here,” she cooed, embracing him.
Harry looked at the mirror and thought about what Andromeda said a few days ago about how every kid who grew up during the war forgot how young they were. She was right. He could easily fit into groups of Muggles - seniors at universities - he’d always see drinking and partying towards the end of the week. He was still so young. His
Which is why she had managed to convince him to go to a Muggle grief support group. She had told him that Ted, her Muggle-born husband, used to go some throughout the years because of the friends they lost in the First War.
“Er, yeah, hi Tina,” Harry chuckled out awkwardly at the counter of the flower shop he used to frequent when he was dating Ginny. It was the only one open this early.
Malfoy chuckled. “I’m still surprised you do. Did Andromeda really give that much of a glowing review?”
As he watched her let go of his hand and walk out, closing the door behind her, Harry felt just how huge the house was. It felt suffocating. All this space. Too much space.
Harry rolled his eyes but couldn't help but smirk at her sarcasm despite the rapid beating in his chest. It had taken her and the rest of the Weasley siblings a while to start joking around again after Fred.
Draco opened his eyes and found himself in a narrow alley between buildings. He looked around to make sure no one had seen him before stepping onto the sidewalk and making his way to the bookshop.
This is the prologue chapter, offering glimpses into Harry's post-war life so far before the story truly starts.
“Hey, look,” Malfoy said, breaking the silence. He reached over to hand Harry a worn-out photo. “For a minute, I thought it was you and Weasley.”
“Definitely.” She was nodding a bit too enthusiastically to be convincing. “It was just a stupid guess.”
Draco stumbled backwards as Teddy practically jumped into his arms. He caught his nephew more out of instinct than awareness because his eyes were still glued on Potter.
"I don't think she meant to. She was musing on how two people from the same class - me and Longbottom - were going to be part of the faculty together. Then, she mentioned you saying you were interested."
Harry walked up to the door after parking his bike, running his hands through his unruly curls as an attempt to get rid of his helmet hair. He really didn’t have any reason to be here other than the fact that one of the customers he had at the shop today had a kid that talked like Teddy and made Harry miss him despite only seeing him a day ago.
Harry gave Ginny a sad smile. He knew that if he could tell anyone, it would be her. How he feels suffocated the instant he steps into the Ministry. How a part of him believes that he will never escape the incessant nightmares and flashbacks. How the knowledge that everyone still expects him to be who he was years ago - a version of himself that was only forced into existence because of a war that suddenly became his responsibility - makes him feel paralyzed. How he wanted to quit.
As soon as the bookshop door closed, Malfoy started laughing. “Even in the Muggle world, everyone flirts with you,” he said, picking up the receipt with the phone number on it.
Potter nodded, running his other hand through his hair again. Draco watched as Potter’s long fingers pushed back his dark, wavy locks. It was the clearest view Draco has ever had of his face. He had never even been this close to him before.
Andromeda hit him lightly on the knee with a kitchen towel, smirking. “Well, I’ve gathered from what everyone has told me that you’re always close to sending hexes flying everywhere at the mention of Draco. So, I figured I had to prepare for when you find out that he’s always over for dinner.”
She sat up straight, looking him in the eye. “Just because you weren’t meant to end up together doesn’t mean it wasn’t true love at one point. You knew with her, and you’ll know again the next time you’ve got someone worth keeping and loving. Whether it’s with her again or someone else. It’ll just be better this time because you’ll be loving whoever that is as
The worry in his mother’s eyes and the softness that crept into her voice got to him. He couldn’t keep lying.
“Oh, it’s this picture of me and Daphne as kids that I’ve always wanted to have painted. She’s a sentimental person, so I’m hoping she’ll love it.”
Draco had told himself after talking to Astoria that he’d keep it casual. He had decided that he could still be friends with him, but he didn’t have to spend every other day with him.
He nodded slowly. "…Yeah. I, er... I wrote her a few weeks after I quit my Auror post. But after she said I was more than welcomed to have the position if I wanted it, I just never wrote her back.”
It was the first time he had mentioned his friends, and Draco didn’t know what to say. Andromeda had told him Potter wasn’t really seeing them as much anymore. Even Potter had mentioned it in the meetings. “Can hardly imagine Weasley handling a baby.”
,” Andromeda scolded as she started carrying the food out of the room. “Come on, let’s eat. Harry, go get Teddy, will you? And make sure he washes his hands.”
like Potter. The man had the same glasses and green eyes, the same dark brown skin, the same unkempt hair. Still, it was hard to tell. It had been so long.
He knew that he should say something, let his presence be known. But as he watched Potter grunt while sweat dripped from his muscled arms, Draco was certain any noise that came out of his mouth would not be comprehensible.
“Yeah, I can see that,” Draco said, exasperated. He reached out and cradled Potter’s palm in his, taking out his wand with his other hand.
He peered at her curiously for a few moments, then rolled his eyes when he realized what she was doing. “You heard that the hospital wants to give me the full-time Potioneer position.”
Draco took another gulp of beer, his elbows brushing against Potter’s arm as he did. Potter rested his wrist on the knee that was touching Draco’s. Draco could feel the warmth of Potter’s hand and the cold of the bottle he held in it.
