Harry suddenly wondered why Draco was here, in the dimly lit empty common room, and not at Hogsmeade with everyone else. He desperately wanted to ask, but it was probably something Pansy already knew about. So instead, he just held Draco a little more tightly.
Hermione insisted it was harmless, but Harry’s lack of access to sugary manufactured serotonin said otherwise.
‘Polyjuice!’ he proclaimed, puffing out his chest, as if he were bestowing the answers to all the secrets of the universe with that one word. And, after Neville had explained his idea, Harry was very inclined to agree. Apparently, as The Snake-Slayer and Dumbledore’s General – unfairly better names than “Saviour” – Neville had been having similar problems to Harry; that is, until he started going out in public in disguise.
Draco nodded unsteadily. Harry made a soft noise and brought his hand up to stroke through Draco’s hair. He nearly flinched when his brain caught up to his hand, but Draco had melted fully into him at the contact, so instead, against his better judgement, he continued to gently massage Draco’s scalp.
Draco’s entire face was blasted open with shock – eyes wide, mouth agape, brows raised to his hairline. It would have been funny, if Harry hadn’t been so raw and desperate for Draco’s attention. When Draco tried to say something, only a squeak came out. He snapped his jaw shut, then opened it and tried again.
Harry wasn’t sure what he was allowed to do with his arms, but he knew leaving them paralysed in the air was probably suspicious, so he lowered his left hand into his lap and placed his right arm around Draco’s shoulders, inadvertently holding him even closer. Draco made a pleased noise and Harry had to stare very intently at the boring portrait on the far wall of a wrinkly old man eating an apple.
‘Harry.’
Oh god.
Harry sighed. That went about as well as he had expected. At least he still had all his fingers and toes. Nonetheless, he felt a dull ache spread from his chest, weighing him down. He slumped back into the chair. Harry wanted to curl in on himself, to mourn the loss of something he had never truly had by pressing into the indents Draco had left behind in the chair, but he knew he should apologise, even if he had just ruined everything.
"Thanks." Me and Draco said together.
The next day we woke up and began formulating a plan. Though Harry seemed to be having a hard time concentrating because he kept fiddling with his snitch that he got from Dumbldore.
An owl came with a letter to me. On the front it has Ginny's name on it. I was about to open it, but Draco took it from me and read it. He looked mad and put it in his pocket.
We sat down my practically sitting on Draco and we ate. "Bloody hell Blaise you look horrible are you okay?" Draco said noticing Blaise black eye and cuts.
When Mason left everyone began glaring at me. "I'll go look for him. I'm sorry." I said and left to look for Harry.
"Yes. I mean I am wearing boy clothes how is that not obvious?" I said.
"What did she say?" I asked.
"So Harry I was wandering  when you are actually going to do the wedding." Hermione said.
"I'm trying to sleep." Harry said.
When they left Harry said, "What do you know about the chamber?"
"Well, it's time to get to class. We have Defence Against The Dark Arts first - with Slytherin." Hermione said, getting up and us following.
Since Ron and I are friends again we all sat down with Ron and Hermione.
We then looked over at Blaise and Ron since they have not said anything in a while and saw them both asleep, Blaise cuddled up to Ron, with Ron having his arms around him.
"No. Stay here and do your work." Hermione said, glaring at us.
"Asked the hat not to put me there." He said shrugging.
He sat up. "But without you the heat is worse." He said.
"I wonder why he acts like hedwig is almost human. I'll ask him later." Harry said.
"So, How was your summer?" Pansy asked.
After the vows and such me and Harry began dancing together. Though Harry is really sheepish about it.
I turned to wormtail. "He is alive you good for nothing son of a bitch!" I yelled.
I got out of bed and started to get ready for the day, but I felt fear and sadness come from Harry. I walked out in nothing but pants. "Harry you okay?" I asked.
Draco has me sitting in his lap and we are doing our work. "Harry. The ingredients for a potion is not Draco over and over." Draco said, laughing.
"What do you want?" Harry said venomously.
"Oh come on Remus. We we're the same when we were there age." Sirius said.
"That's good Harry. Dementors are fear themselves. So you fear nothing but fear itself. If you want I can teach you to chase one away." Lupin said.
So we ate breakfast and flooed to Diagon ally. Hermione and Pansy ran over and hugged us as Ron and Blaise just waited for us to go to them.
Harry p.o.v (italics=Parseltongue
Mason sighed and said, "it's okay. I understand if you don't want to marry me. When we started dating I knew it was not going to last. You were on the rebound. When I asked you to marry me that was because it last longer then it did. I thought you were over it. I will be okay if you want to marry Draco."
"Yes." He said, grabbing hedwigs cage and my owls cage.
Harry sighed and then pulled me down to kiss him. Of course I allowed it and nibbled his lip making him open his mouth.
"So you feel like a boy today Harry?" Blaise said.
"I do have my Animugus form. Maybe next time I can sneak pass Hermione." I said, smiling.
Just as we were walking out Draco dragged me to a empty class room, pushed me up against a wall and began kissing me. I kissed back as he rubbed his hands all over me getting dangerously low. We finally came up for air. "I love being around your sent. You smell so good. I wanted to shag you all class. Maybe that's why I did not do good." He said. He began kissing me again. He began rubbing against me. He started kissing and licking my neck and jaw line. He then bit the marking that he placed on me in fourth year. I moaned as he sucked on the spot.
The next day it is the Gryffindor and Slytherin in defense. We walked in and all the tables are pushed back and a wardrobe is in the middle of the room. Though it's obviously not normal. Besides the fact it's shaking. I mean this is a magic school nothings normal.
"He won't. Ok, Stay here, I'm going to tell the others what happned", Draco said and walked out.
"Good. Imperio!" He yelled at the spider. "I could make it kill itself." He said putting it above a pot of boiling substance. "Or dance." He said putting it on Goyle's head and dance. "No one can stop it. Neville, name me the last one." He said, looking at Neville.
"You could not take the thought of his parents gone." Pansy said, smiling.
I just cuddled up to him and we fell back asleep.
Then we stayed in the couch relaxing tell dinner.
Harry p.o.v
"Let's get you to the hospital wing." He said and picked me up.
His eyes started to water. "I- I wanted to use it." He said.
"I'm not intruble or anything thank Merlin." I replied.
I playfully glared at Draco as the doctor told us that he is in good health and that I can leave shortly. He then walked out leaving us.
"Nothing important. It's over and done with." I said.
"You promise?" I asked, starting to believe him.
I want to know if he is going to tell the whole school that he is gay. And after that he wears girl clothes sometimes. Even though, he does already, just make it more noticeable.
We then went to bed and we went strait to sleep not wanting an repeat of last night. Though I would not mind. I mean Harry having a sexual dream about me is quite hot. But I don't need Hermione mad at me. So I went to sleep cuddling my little Harry.
"So. Draco is having a 'birthday party' this weekend. And he wants you to come." She said looking at her nails as she eats the bread.
Then a few minutes later Cedric came up and pointed to his watch indicating time. I nodded as he took Cho and swam away.
Though I don't care. I just want my Harry to be with me.
I went to the library, knowing the golden trio is in there.
"Mmhm." He replied and fell asleep.
Harry smiled. "I am fine Draco. Why would I not?" Harry said.
Though I don't mind. I love Harry and I will do every thing I can.
"Well he may force some more people or break some out of Azkaban." I said, thinking that it will make sense.
"Don't worry I'm sure it will all be fine." Harry said.
"Draco it's time to get up." I said.
"Go away, meanie!" I yelled.
He sniffed and said, "he is looking through my memories."
I felt some one looking at me and when I looked to see who it is. It's draco again. I glared at him hoping that he'd stop. But he just smiled.
We followed and we ended up at the hospital wing. She opened the door and Hermione is laying on the bed one arm up with a mirror in it.
Draco p.o.v
Both of the girls Harry set me up with left. I sighed and slouched more into my seat. Blaise came over and said, "Hey Ron, what's wrong?"
"Don't worry. As soon as he tries to hurt me you will know and then you can do something," Harry said and kissed my cheek.
He ran into the bathroom and I sat there in shock. He thinks I don't love him? I got up and knocked on the bathroom door. "Harry please. Come out. I'm not mad. I just want to talk. Please." I said.
I sat on the foot of the bed facing Harry. He started mumbling in his sleep until finally he jerked awake, sitting up. "Why did you do that!?" He said, shivering.
"Okay your cool and all but I'm not into you. I'm doing it for some one else." He said.
"I don't know. I mean Gryffinor does know, but I don't know how every one else will act. I bet Slytherin house will make fun of me." I said, holding the stuffies tighter.
"So you want me to say you're good looking too?" Harry said.
Harry p.o.v
I nodded. "Yeah. Fine. Just a little hot." I said.
The next day I woken up and we got ready. I dressed in the girls uniform and we went down to the common room and waited for our friends.
Harry p.o.v
"Alright just be quiet." Snape said turning around and marching out.
I woke up and Harry is awake.
"Yes?" I said sitting up, carefully setting Simba on the pillow.
"Little past nine. Would you like for me to call in Dobby to bring up breakfast?" Draco answerd.
Crookshanks came over. How she got there I don't know and went to touch the roots of the trees. "Come on," Harry called and ran over taking a tunnel. And we followed behind.
"How about we go to my room and get some sleep ya?" I said picking him up.
"Ginny done it. She used polyjuce to make herself look like me." Draco said.
"Fine," Harry replied.
Fang came over and sniffed Draco, but then cowered away. "If you let us inside we'll tell you." Hermione said, looking strangely at the dog.
I nodded and we finished eating and went to Hermione room because ours probably smell like sex. And we relaxed.
"Hey Draco." Blaise said as he came over with Ron.
"He was to busy to have one iver the summer and it's close to the school year so he though. Why not. Are you coming or not?" She answered.
"No Harry should go back to the school," Hermione said.
"This is important Hermione." Harry said and kept reading.
Draco p.o.v
In the morning we got up and began getting ready for the school day. And not wanting to leave Simba I carefully put him in my bad leaving James. I want to take him. But there is no more room.
But the nights were hard. I could barely sleep.
Harry can speak Parcelmouth! I thought suprised. Snape killed the snake and Finch Fletchly said to Harry, "What are you playing at?!" And walked out.
Though I quickly stood up. "Sitting here is not going to do any good. It's obvious that he is not in Hogwarts." I said
"Well lucky us. Let's party!" The twins said, jumping off the table.
The next day every one is staring at Harry, which is making Harry uncomfortable, which is making me mad. It's breakfast and I'm sitting at the Slytherins and he is with the Gryffindors. I growled and got up and walked over to him. I grabbed his wrist and we walked out.
I gasped. "What type of punishment is that?" I asked.
"That's all?" Ron asked.
"Hermione helps me," Ron said.
"Good. I'm happy you get along with my pets." Harry said smiling
I shrugged and said, "I was thinking maybe one set are out of school.  What do you to draco?"
He smiled and said, "I'd love to. I think Ron is still mad at me."
"What the bloody Hell is that?!" Ron yelled.
I hope you all enjoyed the first smut scene in the book.
I'm getting measured and Ron is complaining to me as Draco is looking for casual clothes.
The next day during Defense Mad-Eye asked for Harry to stay behind.
I sighed and got up. We both got ready me putting on the girls uniform, then went to the great Hall. Were our friends are already sitting, Ron, of course, is stuffing his face. We sit down and begin eating.
Draco hugged me to him. "Yes. let's not talk about this." Ron agreed.
"I promise." He said and kissed my forehead.
We all looked at Harry. "Are you in heat?" I asked.
The adults began talking as we walked around. We went to the robe shop and got new robes. "I remember when I first met you here Harry. You were so young and innocent to the wizarding world." I said.
"Yah I'm fine." Harry mumbled cuddling back up to me.
"Are we going to meet him?" Ron asked.
"Great!" Hermione said.
"Not our fault!" Ron said shoving food into his mouth.
"Anything you want to." He said.
They grabbed her arms and took her out of the hall, Umbitch kicking and screaming the whole way.
So we all got ready for bed and I fell asleep cuddling Draco.
We went to defense and Umbrige is at the front of the class. "Where is Remus?" I asked, or more like growled.
•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•~•
I followed the trio into the room, laughing at Harry. I grabbed him from Hermione. "Careful, you might break him. Plus he's mine."  I said. I wrapped my arms around him and kissed his cheek. A few Hufflepuff girls awed and fangirled.
"If you insist." He said and thrust inside of me.
"You're Malfoy - the one my master talks about," she hooted.
"Fine. Just thought you left me." He said, looking at his lap.
"I love you to." I said and kissed his forehead.
"There family is scared. They think the best way is by befriending you and your friends. Hermione can I tell you a secret?"
I then ran to Hermione, and woke her up as well. Then we even got pansy.
I leaned my head on his shoulder, happy I am almost as tall as him.
"In order to have that we must know what normal means." Ron said and laughed a bit.
"That is really rude you know. I mean what if Ron and Blaise done that to you two?" Pansy said, scolding us.
We followed the spiders into the forbidden forest, reminding me of the last time I was here with Harry. I was so scared and nearly peed my pants when that weird shadow thing showed up. When the spiders ended it was at some weird nest. Then a big spider that's about the size of my Manor appeared. "Who are you?" The spider said.
The next day me and Harry woke up and Harry got dressed in the girls uniform. When we got to the great hall Umbitch looked at Harry in disgust. So I glared at her.
"I can date who I want Malfoy. Come on Mason." I said taking Mason's hand and walking away from Malfoy.
"This is not funny Ron. Just tell me how they know." I said. "Wait, does this mean Draco knows?" he nodded. "Then why has he not made fun of me?" I ask.
"You asked." Draco said as Blaise and Ron came in.
He laughed and said, "I'm rich it's fine. I saw a wonderful magical world. I dated a famous wizard and had sex with him. And I got to spend time with an amazing person. I don't regret this one bit. But when you get married to Draco I better be invited and get to spend time with you more. We are still friends."
"You stroke the spine of course," I said sarcastically.
Draco p.o.v
He glanced at Draco and walked away.
"Good, yours my Draco?" He said.
"You will see." They said together and walked away.
Draco p.o.v
I woke up as Narcissa walked in. She smiled at us. "Can you wake up Draco. It's lunch time." She said. I nodded and she walked out. "Draco wake up." I said, shaking his shoulders. He moved a little, then pulled me against him. "Draco it's lunch time. Come on." I said. He still did not get up, so I bit his neck. He then turned us over and kissed me.
When we got there Ron and Blaise is already there and it's almost dark. We began walking and Hermione is singing the Hogwarts song as Harry is walking a bit away from us lost in thought.
"Yes," I said, scared.
We nodded and went to the room of requirement. "So now what? Ginny is in Azkaban, Voldemort is in the insane asylum, and Wormtail is dead. We have nothing to do." Ron said.
"I hope nothing bad happens to Buckbeak or Hagrid," I said and Hermione nodded.
Mean while with pansmion. Hermione p.o.v
I kissed his cheek and said, "we don't need to do anything right now."
Harry p.o.v
"I'm fine. That was a fun ride though." Mason said getting up and smiling.
He laughed. "I could not belive it. Though I think it's cute." I kissed his nose and some girls awwed.
"But Hermione that sounds so boring." Ron said.
I looked at him. "Wait, can he even leave?" I asked.
"Harry, Draco. Welcome to the Black house." Hermione said happily.
"Harry Ron is being me to me." Draco said nuzzling my neck.
"But how?! I thought I was good at hiding it!" I said.
"Oh come on. Tell us." Ron said.
Harry p.o.v
I know Hermione will take it well, but Ron I'm not too sure about. I hear a car engine, so I look outside.
We both came and Draco collapsed next to me. He hugged me to him. We both said that we love each other then fell asleep.
Draco had been continuing the one-sided conversation, oblivious to Harry’s reaction, and was now discussing the merits of introducing Latin courses to the Hogwarts curriculum and Harry really shouldn’t have been so captivated by a dead language he had no interest in but, of course, he was completely enveloped by Draco’s passion, both literally and metaphorically.
"That's what they all say," Ron said.
The doors opened and they set someone on the bed closest to the doors. And what I got from their conversation was another attack and the attacker broke the camera. And they might shut down the school.
"Is that even a good plan?" Pansy asked.
We then took off our boxers and he grabbed me, rubbing me. I moved against him needing the feeling.
That night as we got home from me showing Mason my work I noticed an owl on our coffee table with a package.
"PDA!" Fred and George screamed. Draco got off me and pulled me up. "Still love disgusted eh?" He asked.
For the rest of the week, I have been thinking about it: Draco has been much nicer and I have seen him practice quidditch. He will be a good opponent today.
"What, you don't think I'm beautiful?" I said.
The next day we went to the infermory. Ron is alseep in a chair beside blaises bed alseep holding blaises hand. There are no classes today and every one knows of Dumbledores death. Me Draco Pansy and Hermione sat down. "Should we wake Ron up?" Hermione asked.
"I'll be fine, Ron.  I mean, girls do it." Harry said smiling.
"Aww my poor wittle puppy." Harry said and hugged me.
"I need Harry's but if Harry gives me his blood then that means he accepts me," I said and Harry looked at me.
"Come on Harry, let's go up to the dorm." He said, getting up and me following. When we got in he roughly pushed me on the bed, closed the curtains, put up a silencing charm, and began kissing me. The burning began to slowly go away and I moaned into his mouth.
Victor came over and asked Hermione to write to him. She said she will.
I smiled. "Thanks. So what do you want to do now?" I asked.
I just growled. "I am going to kill those bitches." I said and went to walk out.
"Ginny." We who were awake answered.
He then went to the bathroom and I got dressed as I waited.
"Is it alright with you all?" Dad asked the Weasley.
Draco came back and noticed my unhappy expression. "Harry what's wrong?" He asked,  immediately cuddling up to me.
I ran around a bit, then I saw Harry sitting at his dorm window. I howled and he looked at me. He waved and I bowed, then ran off.
What am I going to do? He must hate me. With the Prophet as forever a reminder. I started scratching at my wrist, not paying attention.
"What took you two so long!" Hermione yelled.
I took Harry to his lesson then went back to my room and threw all of the potions away.
The next day I woke up and Draco is already awake and running his fingers through my hair.
"Thank you." We said.
Harry glanced at me and got up. I looked at Draco and it looked like he was going to cry. We walked to Dumbledors office, the others already there.
"Well let's go we need to get all our supplies." Mrs. Weasley said.
I looked over at the others and they all are hard at work. Hm. What if I trick Draco into making this potion.
"This was not our first time. It won't happen." Draco said.
I stood still not sure what to do. Draco looked at me like he wanted me to do somthing.
I turned human and was again on top of Harry. "We really need to stop getting into this position. Though I like it." I said.
"Alright Harry. What is wrong? You better speak." Hermione said.
"Yep not good looking at all. I'll say the best looking in here is me and Draco." Harry said.
"That actually sounds like a good idea." He said keeping me down. There is a knock at the door and Draco said. "Enter." Ron and Hermione came in.
"Mhm. You sure sound like you want to stay. And sleep." Draco said kissing my neck.
"I'm sorry my Hawwy. What do you want me to do? Will a kiss make it better?" Draco asked sounding worried.
"Snap her wand. Do anything, but she is my daughter." Mrs Weasley said.
Realization dawned on his face when both Blaise and Ron woke up. "Don't freak out, but I think Lucif is trying to kill Ron." Harry said.
"See somthing you like Potter?" I said mockingly.
Right now he is rubbing my knee though and I need more, but Draco will not allow it.
Draco p.o.v
We came in just as Blaise left. "What did you do?" Pansy asked as she and Hermione came in.
"Hm." I replied simply.
"It's alright. Someones coming sleep." He said and laid down. I did the same and had him cuddle to me.
"I looked before I went... I'm not stupid." Harry replied.
"I want to be with you to my Harry." I said and kissed Harry back.
We then sat in comfortable silence. All of us lost in our own thought. Wich made me start thinking. If I asked them to start calling me a girl when I feel like a girl and a boy when I feel like a boy, would they? Or would it just be too much trouble?
"Yes he is." Mason said walking in.
Dumbledore stood up and said, "Moody my good friend. I'm glad you made it. Everyone this is Mad-Eye Moody your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher."
"Ron and Draco began having a discussion that I don't want to talk about," I said.
Snape walked. "What are you all doing and what the devil was that absurd screeching?" He asked.
We walked out of the library. "I need to go feed Lucif." Harry said.
"Okay." I said and fallowed his lead.
"You could get the ingredients and I'll make the potion." Draco said.
"Your on your own Harry dear." She said and all the adults left the room.
"Morning my love. How do you feel?" I asked.
"And why do the Slytherins hate you three?" She asked, looking slightly disgusted.
He looked over. "It smells like you and looks how it should, so I say yes." He said and then continued working.
"Its Alright." Blaise said.
"How did you get the name in the goblet? Did you have an older student do it for you?" Dumbledore asked.
Once every one cleared out Mcgonagall had us 8th years fallow her to a picture of a hipogriff. "Gillyweed." Mcgonagal said and the picture opened. "Girls on left boys on right. You will each share a room with one person. Names are on doors." McGonagall said and left.
So I got up and walked out saying nothing.
"Ask him or his friends," Father said like it was obvious.
Man I should have slept like Draco said.
"What about them?" I asked.
Draco p.o.v
We went to the great hall and saw Hermione with Krum.
"Don't call me that Harry." Draco said and bit my neck.
"Draco. Wait. What about Harry?" Hermione said.
He laughed and said, "but you did say duddykins is allowed at our wedding right?"
He just leaned down and kissed me not doing as I asked.
Which, while worrying, as I thought about his name I relaxed.
"Mm. No. To tired." Harry said, batting my hands away.
"I'm not that much shorter than you," I said pouting.
I then pulled away and said, "how about we go back and do somthing more fun."
"Ms. Umbridge hurt my mate using a blood quill." Draco said as I looked at my hands.
James p.o.v
Our parents say Voldemort is crazier than last time. Not sure how crazy he was last time. I feel as though he was not crazy last time, if this is crazier.
At the end of the day, we couldn't change them back. When we (me, Draco, Ron, and Hermione) got to the common room, Ginny looked at us and laughed. "Wow, Harry you have never looked gayer. And Ron. Just. Wow." She said laughing.
"No." Harry said.
"Okay fine, but if he breaks her heart I'm gonna kill him." Ron said and walked away.
"I can't believe you. Harry and Draco turned you gay. Don't worry I will fix this." She said and walked away.
Me and Draco laghed and I then looked at the front seeing a horse with wings. "You okay Harry?" Draco asked putting an arm around me.
"Hermione why did you wake us up? We wanted to sleep in!" I said.
"Leave us alone! We're busy!" I said and closed the curtains and looked down to see a blushing Harry.
"I don't know." I said and went to follow him.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"They have work. So we are all alone." Draco said, smiling at me.
We sat in silance eating thoughtfully. I shrugged and said, "maybe it's all the pink."
Throughout the day Harry would switch between girl and boy actions. Making most of us confused.
We all started laughing and Hermione said, "you boys are terrible."
"What if it's a prank?" I asked.
We got on. "There are a lot of nargles (i think this is how its spelled.) out this evening." She said.
I grabbed his member and began playing with that, making him move his hips. When we both came I collapsed next to him, breathing deeply. "I love you Harry." I said and cuddled him.
Once we finished eating Ron and Hermione had to leave, so me and Draco went up to my room.
"So after Hogwarts and every thing and we get married, where would you like the wedding at?" I asked Harry.
Draco p.o.v
(Please read: I do not remember this one much so please don't get mad if anything is wrong.)
I then used a spell to get some lube and prepared himself and me. I then thrust myself inside of him and began pulling out and pushing in a rythem.  Stroking and kissing him as I did so. He gasped and moaned loudly incuriging me to go faster and harder.
"I don't know," Ron said.
What if he startes making fun of me realizing I'm just a waste of space. And that I'm just stupid. "Hey harry time to get up you okay?" Ron said.
"Yes, he was known to be one of the best. And Dumbledore best friend." I said.
"What? What did that slimy git do!" Ron asked gaining every one's undivided attention.
I laid Harry on our bed taking off his glasses and shoes. I got ready and laid next to him, he cuddling to me. "Draco." He mumbled.
"Harry did you take the potion this morning?" He asked. I looked at him worriedly. "Harry that's important. Now come on we are going to see Dumbledore and Snape will heal your hand and give us an extra one." Draco said.
"But Harry you practically saved Mr Weasley. So how is it bad?" Hermione said, smiling.
Draco smiled at me and said, "any thing for you my Harry."
"But every one knows. What would they think?" Harry said.
I'm so happy that Harry is not mad at me any more. I have no clue what I done wrong though. But at least she is happy. Though now I'll need to beg my parents to let us keep all the baby bunnies.
Harry p.o.v
We both started packing. "you share a room with others right?" Draco asked.
Me and Draco walked around as Hermione went with Pansy, Ron, and Blaise.
He stopped and looked around. "Ms. Granger. Name another." He said.
She just smiled and walked away.
Draco looked at me. "Are you defending her?" Draco asked.
We sat down on a couch with Harry on my lap. "Are you sure you will be okay?" I asked.
Pansy laughed and said, "true. We sure did. We should make merchandise."
We went into Honeydukes. "You two can get whatever you want I'll pay." Draco said.
I laughed. Draco will have fun with him. I thought.
"I wonder how that happned. Do you think Voldemort had somthing to do with it?" Hermione said.
"Hermione is right you two are cute together." Sirius said.
"I want to. But I am under cover. Now go, I'll help were I can." Snape said.
We woke up around seven and done our morning routine. We got dressed and I gave Harry the potion and we ate. Harry left with Sirius, leaving me here.
I leaned my head on hers and said, "Same. I also want candy."
"Well, how can I when he is always here?" Harry said.
Draco p.o.v
"Please Draco. Quickly." I said, pulling him down.
Ron who has gotten used to Harry wearing girl clothes said, "Well, fine we will leave." And walked away. Hermione smiled at us and done the same.
At the end, I got the box I had asked Remus to pick up for me, I kneeled in front of Harry and said, "Harry, I have loved you since we met at Madam Malkin's. I knew you were the one, then you rejected my hand, and I admit I was a bit of a jerk. But, in our second year, when I needed you, you were there. You accepted me as a mate and I love you. Which is why, I hope you accept this ring." I said and opened the box, in it is a silver ring with a red Ruby.
We then went down to the great hall Blaise and Ron joining us a few minutes later along with Pansy and Hermione. "Morning boys." Both Pansy and Hermione said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
"Really it's fine. The others should be getting back anytime now. We should take a shower and get dressed. I bet we smell like sex." Draco said.
The only reason why I broke up with him was to protect him. But no! I ruined it. I ruined everything!
The curtains opened again and Blaise said, "sorry that we are disturbing your sexy time. But Professer Lupin wants to speak with you two."
Zabini and I teleported to St. Mungo's.
As I was rushing down the stairs of the Manor, I saw that my Aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange, was twirling her wand in the air, while smiling maliciously, a glint of an unknown emotion flickering across her dark eyes.
Draco placed one hand on my hip and he pulled me down kissing him. Then there was a knock at the door and heard Hermione say, "come on boys let's get breakfast."
He looked away and said, "well. I want to. It's just. I don't know if it's a good idea."
"How did she get to go with him?" Draco asked.
They shook there heads. Either way, it didn't matter.
"It would be nice to know what it is," Draco agreed hugging me closely.
After Harry stumbled a little but I caught him. "You okay?" I asked and he nodded.
The next day all through classes, Harry was tired. He even fell asleep on me a few times. He was so cute. I did not have the will to wake him.
Harry p.o.v
I broke away and saw Pansy. "Is this a bad time?" She asked, blushing.
"He is. I have to go I'll see you around." I said and left.
We walked down and Hermione smiled at us. We sat down. "So how was your night? Did you sleep well?" Pansy asked.
"She is toad like." Ron agreed.
"Sure Harry anything you want," I said smiling at him.
"Do you really want to know?" Harry said, smiling, but still blushing. Ron nodded. "We slept." Harry said.!
"Are you already planning?" Draco asked.
"Why were you acting like that Draco?" Father asked.
When he came over he is wearing a red skirt with a white shirt and he has on red lipstick and black eye shadow. I smiled remembering when I gave him that. He sat down on the blanket I had set out and started taking out the food.
We both said good morning and began eating. Harry had me hold his hand as we ate, but I did not mind.
My parents deemed it alright but Ron said, "Wait up just a few rules for Draco. One, make sure that Harry is safe and don't do anything without his permission. If I hear one bad thing or notice anything different I will stake you."
"That Weasl is being annoying." Draco said.
"I talked to Granger and she told me what Potter likes," I said.
His face went red as every one started laughing. "Not funny Harry. Plus we almost died." He said.
He unconsciously curled up to me and I put my arms around him. I hope he will he happy about this. Then I fell asleep.
Harry p.o.v
"What do you mean there is nothing you can do!?" Draco yelled at him.
"Please call me Molly, dear." She replied.
He kissed my head and said, "i don't know how are you?"
Harry looked confused. "What's a pensive?" He asked.
He looked at his friends and they nodded.
"In my dream Voldemort was torturing Sirius!" Harry yelled at me.
A few minutes later we both fell asleep.
"No. Just. Don't worry about it." I said and ate.
Snape p.o.v after class.
"I can make you do anything I want. So go fetch." He said. "Please Dracy poo." He added.
"But why? There so cute." Harry said looking at the picture again.
I ran to Moaning Myrtles bathroom to get away. I am horrible and disgusting. I was not able to get away from Ginny. I should have tried harder and I bet Draco hates me. It also brought back memories of Vernon and what he done.
Then the door bell rang. "Oh Hermione and Ron are here." Mason said getting up and letting them in.
Once done we oblivite the lady the worked here and apeareated away to some woods, "Okay, decently how this time? How did they do it?" I asked.
"Harry I care about you more than you can imagine." I said and healed his arm.
Draco p.o.v
So I breathed. "Good boy. Don't pass out on us!" Hermione said and hit me upside the head.
We thought for a moment and Ron said, "surprise me."
Then pansy Hermione Ron and Blaise came in.
I bit on and began sucking. Harry moaned and moved a bit as though he wants to get comfterable. His moaning of course made me a little aroused. I bit harder making Harry gasp and moan. I began moving my hands tell I got to the front of his night pants.
"I think I sleep much better with you too," he agreed and kissed my cheek.
"Hello. Come in and sit down." She said. We done that and I looked around the office. Since its the headmasters everything is the same with all the pictures. Though Dumbledore's is not up. "So first off how is your first day back?" McGonagall asked. We all answerd by saying good as I noticed that Fawks is not here to. Then again that was Dumbledore's pet. "So the reson why I have called you up here is because Wormtail has gotten some more followers. He is saying that Voldemort has had his memory wiped and was kidnapped." She said.
After eating we had our classes. Lucky there was at lunch I got an letter giving me the okay to do as I wish and asking what I want done.
"Alright enough. Twenty points for creativity. Ten points away for disrupting class."
Ginny sat down and said, "what's going on here?"
"Well, how about we not do that again," Hermione suggested as Snape came in robes billowing.
"No. We won't." Harry said.
I ran over to him and smelled death. I grabbed him, hugging him and telling him everything will be okay. I realized Cedric is dead and everyone else did to. Mad Eye and Dumbledore came over.
I was bitten by a vampire last night in Knockturn Alley with my father. He killed the vampire afterward and took me home.
"Harry if you want you and Draco can go to your room and rest." Remus said.
"Good morning Harry." Draco said.
Harry's P.O.V.*
I watched as Potter got all the attention. The strange thing is that Potter's scent was the same as the one that I smelt in Knockturn.
"McGonagall and Ron sitting in a tree!" They started to sing.
"Nothing important." I replied before I grabbed Harry's wrist and dragged him into an abandoned classroom unable to control myself.
Afterward, we watched the sunset.
"I know but, I'm scared.  I-I don't know what to do." I said, hugging myself. Draco hugged me and kissed my forehead.
"Please don't what Harry?" Draco said, loosening his grip on me.
We ran out and found Ron and Blaise running to us with a fang. They both have swallon lips and disliked hair. "Realky!" Me and Pansy said together.
"We can see that." Pansy said, pointing at my neck.
When I finished I licked Harry's wound closed and laid next to him cuddling him.
He started to feed me as I thought if I should tell him about the abuse. "Well. It's not as go good as people think. My uncle, he... abuses me." I said.
"Hello ,my boy, how is your day?" Dumbledore asked, deep in thought.
He pouted and said, "Fine! You're mean!"
The twins stepped up to the circle that lines the goblet so only seventh years can got through. "This will help us-"
"Come on. let's get you inside Harry." He said, reaching for him, but I growled. He then pulled back.
After dinner I dragged Harry up to my room. "Take off your pants." I demanded.
"You wanna get a room?" I asked him.
"Well, we have to teach our new seeker." The Slytherin captain said.
There is a knock at the door so I got up to see who it was. When I opened the door it is just Hermione and Pansy.
"Maybe." I said.
Draco p.o.v
I quickly got up and dressed draco. Draco getting up tirdly and asking me what's wrong. So I quickly explained and got Ron and Blaise up to. Who are lucky not undressed from having sex.
"Draco I'm sure will make fun of me," Ron said.
"Well hello children. I bet you are looking for whatever hagrid brought over. Well. We're is it"? Umbitch said.
After I bought what I needed we apparated back. I found Harry in the kitchen with mom. "I am back love." I said and hugged him.
"Yeah I'll never understand them." Blaise said, shaking his head.
"So? We don't need to watch you kiss our friend." Ron said.
"No." He said simply.
"The man. It just proves I'm more manly then you." Ron said.
The next day Mason and I went to Diagon Alley so I could show him my world. I loved looking at his cute face as I showed him everything.
And I shrugged.
"They're Veela. So if you are not dating someone or a soulmate to someone and if you like that gender then you will fall under their spell." He answered.
Every one cheered and clapped me probably the loudest. Draco kissed my cheek and Dumbldore told us to tuck in so we began eating.
"Well you will be fine." I kissed his cheek, which made him blush a little.
"Night Draco love you." He said curling up to me.
He blushed as u practicly ripped his shrit off and began biting his chest and sucking on his nipples.he gasped and arched his back. I then pulled away and ripped his pants off then his boxers. He pulled me closer and quickly took my shirt off then my pants. I was about to sit back but he pulled me closer and put my penis in his mouth and began sucking. I groned and pushed more into his mouth. When I was close to cuming I pulled out of his mouth and made him suck my fingers to get them slick with saliva.
He scooted over closer to me, but Ginny just got closer. "Go away slut. We don't want you here." I growled, pulling Harry to my side.
"I don't know," I said.
"All I need is you Harry. So pleas if we do eventually face voldimort. Primiss me you'll be safe." Draco said.
When we finished, me and Draco went back to our room and finished packing.
"Don't do it again." He said and stormed out.
"Why would you care?" He asked.
"I'm sorry." I said.
"M- fine." He said cuddling me.
I carefully slipped out of Draco's arms and grabed the bottle from the night stand. I went to the bathroom and poured all the potion down the drain. I filled it up with water thanking merlin that the vile is not clear.
Pansy, Blaise, Goyle and Crabbe came in and sat on my bed.
"Okay let's go to my room," I said and led him to my room.
"Embarrassing?" Fred said.
"I- I asked... Fleur out," he stammered.
She turned around and stopped in front of us. "I am not going to be someone's last resort! Plus I already have a date!" She said stormed off.
So he talked to me and Snape repeated the process a few times.
"You can sleep." He said. I then fell asleep, my head resting on Draco's chest.
"Draco he is Harry Potter. He will be fine." She said and just as she said those words, Harry appeared clutching onto Cedric, crying.
Harry just stared at the food. "Eat Harry. You need it." Draco said, nudging Harry.
"I haven't got a clue." I said as we all went to our next class, which is Potions with Slytherins.
He nodded, so I picked him up bridle style and carried him back to the common room.
I walked up to him and Draco was looking at me worriedly. I stood in front of him. "I would like to see if you could stop the Imperius curse. If you want." Mad eye said.
"Don't worry Harry. Rita just likes to twist stories about people. Everything will be fine." I assured him.
I pulled him closer and tugged at his hair.
*Harry's P.O.V.*
"That's brilliant. I'm sure you will win Harry." I said and kissed his cheek.
I nodded. "Then we won't. Finish eating and we can go somewhere and relax." I said.
He glared at me. So I helped him up and we took a shower together. And it took all my will to not go for another round of sex.
"I guess the ministry wants to keep tabs on the school." Hermione said and everyone agreed.
"Hello my little mate. Did you sleep well?" I questioned, resting my head into his shoulder.
Hermione must have saw the cuts on his arm. "Harry what happened to your arm!?" She yelled.
After all our classes I met Harry at the Gryffindor's common room and Harry has something on his mind that Hermione is trying to get him off of.
We then got up and went to out first class.
"Snape came in with death eaters, then, he killed Dumbldore." I began crying.
"Not yet hunny. Let him spend time with his godfathers, and we can also spend time together. Then you can go stay with Harry. " Mom said.
"Did you like that Harry?" He asked.
I nodded, and we finished eating. All the while I tried to push the bad thoughts away.
Harry p.o.v
"Sounds great. How about tomorrow." Draco asked.
I'm going home! I thought. We then found a compartment and sat down with Ginny.
"So how about we have a change of discussion. What do you all think about the Beuxbaton girls?" Ron said.
"But i-"
"Okay." I said.
Then we went off to classes. I was happy that I can use the half blood prince book so I can probably pass in flying colors.
"What?" I replied.
"Where have you two been?" Ron said, changing the conversation.
"I don't need to listen to this! Just get ready for classes!" Ron yelled, walking out.
The girls looked over to us and grinned. As Ron and blaise sat against another tree talking.
I frowned and Draco said, "Blaise shut up. Come on Harry. You all can stay here." Draco then grabbed my hand and dragged me over to the teacher table. We stood infront of Dumbldore who is not even looking at me. "May we speak to you privetally Professor Dumbldore." Draco said.
I nodded and they told me, that when I'm done, I should get ready to go. So I went back up to my room and put on some red flats, I go to my dresser and put on some lip stick and eyeliner. After getting ready, I skipped downstairs.
"Alright champions line up. Girls on one side and boys on the other." McGonagall said.
Harry p.o.v
"So did you find anything important harry?" Blais asked.
I rolled my eyes. "I heard a Slytherin girl complaining about not having a date this morning. If you want we can go over and you can take her." I said.
"Yes but McGonagall is now in charge. No one is dumb enough to mess with her." I said.
When we got back to school i finally began feeling better about the whole Arthur Weasly attack. Draco during the whole break was trying to make me feel better.
But his father grabbed him and hit him upside the head. "How dare you hit me! Wait untill my father... Wait. Okay fine." Draco said and sat back down. He grabbed me and put me back onto his lap.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
"But you are comfortable." He said and buried his face in my neck and wrapping his arms around my waist.
"I'm sorry blaise." Ron said.
Some girls awed at what I said. Draco jumped onto me and I fell on my back and he pinned me down. He turned human and licked me again. "Still disgusting Potter?" He said, smirking.
"Thank you." He said.
"Just walking. We should not stay in one place to long." Hermione said as we began walking.
"Alright breakfast is ready. We can eat then open presents." Mom said.
"Yes but-"
"Okay." She said, holding out her foot.
I could tell he is aroused and said, "is it down there or somewhere else?"
"My hair? At least it's not greasy like yours. Or messy like Harry's." Ron shot back.
"And Harry don't forget about occlumency lessons today after dinner."  Snake said and walked out.
We then, go downstairs to see Sirius setting the table, and Remus reading something about Voldemort being back. "Morning boys." They said.
"No need to be sorry love. Just get the ingredients."
"Well, there must be something that can be done. Hey look here comes Viktor Krum." Ron said.
"I think that's a perfect idea," Oliver said.
"Who's the letters from love?" I asked, sitting down and opening mine.
He took it and took a sip. "Thank you Draco." He said, handing me the vile.
"Wait! Harry, Hermione, and Pansy did it. We had nothing to do with this." Ron said.
"At least Draco cares about Harry. Harry needs some one like him." Sirius said.
Then the doors opened and a spell was thrown making Mad-Eye sit in a chair.
I kissed back, and slithered my toung into his mouth. He groaned, and rolled his hips against mine. I held him down again and said, "Harry, not right now!"
I heard a scream from Ron's bed making Draco jump off of me. I looked over and everyone is now awake.
"Yes. Are you ready Draco?" Harry said, burying his head into my neck.
I grabbed the male uniform and quickly put it on.
"I'll tell you later." Harry said ,quietly.
I went to strike the horcrux Draco and Blaise passed out and a black smoke came out of it. It showed me images of Blaise breaking up with me, not loving me anymore. My freinds finding me weak and leaving, different ways of the same thing, then it showed Blaise killing Draco and kissing Harry, with Harry liking it.
"Will you two shut up. I'm trying to sleep." I said and snuggled more into Draco.
We got ready and then went to the great hall. Hermione and Ron are already there and I guess they can tell that somthing has happened.
"Harry love we can not stay in here all day.
"But it's wrong. There slaves. They are working for nothing." Hermione said.
I pulled away and Ron is hugging Blaise, his head buried in Blaise's neck. "Get a room you two!" Blaise yelled and helped Ron up to the room.
We then all yelled at him not to say that name. "Sorry. but still, we should still be worried." Harry said.
Draco smiled and then looked at Ron. "Oh, by the way. Call me dog again and I will hurt you." He growled threateningly.
"But I'll definitely get in right?" Ron asked.
The bushes began closing in on us so we ran from that. Then we found a straight shot at the cup and we ran for it helping each other since the bushes are now grabbing at our feet.
"Do you think we can visit him?" I asked.
I pulled Harry onto my lap and began kissing him. "I know we just had sex, but why not?" I said and began kissing his neck. I pushed Harry onto his back and began unbuttoning his shirt. The door slammed open. "Get off my Harry you mutt." A female voice said.
"I don't know. Ginny told me you wont. And you think I'm weak and unlovable." He said and cried some more.
I also bought three roses for Harry: one is pink and white, another red and the last one white.
Harry p.o.v
Malfoy glared at me and said, "it could have. But I was quite enjoying my time with Harry."
When we finished I took us to Snape and he gave us the healing potion. Then we stormed over to Dumbledors office. I opened the door and we walked in. "Dumbledore I am so sick and tired of that bitch. Either do somthing about it or I will have my father sue this school and have you fired!" I said, getting louder till the end of my sentence.
"Well I'm done. If you three want to go, we can." Hermione said.
I just skipped to the part that said, "Severus Snape should keep his large nose out of other people's business."
I rubbed his back and said. "I love you to."
"Stand up and walk around," Harry said.
"Really Harry? This is not the time. I have bad news!" Hermione said.
They called Harry's name so I have him one last kiss and told him good luck. And I ran to the stands.
Harry p.o.v
"If you insist," I said and leaned forward. I kissed him lightly on the lips. When I pulled back Harry is smiling like an idiot.
"I can't believe you bottemed." Draco said.
Mean while with Blron. Ron's p.o.v
"Making sure that mut did not touch you or hurt you." He said.
"We are not making out so it's not PDA. we are just cuddling. I  mean Ron and Blaise are too." Harry pointed out. And he's right.
I nodded quickly, and we ran up to her room. Though sadly Simba still can not run.
"Oh no. But Ron's okay?" Pansy said. Of course she is worried, Blaise is like a brother to her.
*Harry's P.O.V.*
When he saw us he smiled. "Hello Harry and Draco." He said.
I smiled and wached him sleep a bit tell I fell asleep myself.
Draco p.o.v
I hugged him to me and kissed his head. I know he does not like apeareating but he will be okay.
When we walked in I saw Ollivander and Rita Skeeter with a floating quill and parchment. "Hello. If you would go to each of us one by one that would be nice." Ollivander said.
"Maybe we should sign up," I said and Harry nodded as Ron made an affirmative grunt.
"Yes. What do I wear?" Harry asked.
"What are we going to do?" Ron said.
I can't believe that everyone was keeping this from me. I wonder if Draco knew. I went to the common room and Hermione Ron and Draco showed up.
"It's going to be alright Harry. Draco should be able to be back to watch." Ron said, following me.
"What's the plan?" I asked.
"Why has he not told us any of this?" Dumbledore asked.
"He was supposed to love me. He is supposed to be mine, but he just chose to be a fag and started dating that mutt. Now Ron is dating Blaise. What's next, you and Pansy? Oh and don't forget Dean and Seamus. All the Gryffindors are practically gay. it's wrong." Ginny said to Hermione.
"You better hope I don't put bars on your window!" she yelled. She then looked at me and said, "I'm not mad at you hunny. How about you take your things to Ron's room? Breakfast is almost ready."
"You better." Ron said and began studying his face.
I held my hand to my chest and kept flying.
I kissed him back harder. He pulled away from my lips and said "I love you Harry." Then began biting my neck thrusting slightly faster. I moaned loudly as Draco continued to bite me and play with my penis. "Come on Harry let me hear your pleasure." Draco said against my ear. He then licked it and nibbled. Making me moan loudly.
We ran to the toys, Ron looking around, probably not wanting to get caught in a kids store. I felt the toys and found a cute deer. I picked him up and showed him to my friends. Ginny also picked out a puppy.
I woke up in a hospital bed. Baby bump gone and Draco sitting next to me holding a baby boy. Narcissa holding another baby boy as well.
When we finished eating we had to go. And today griffindore has defence first with Hufflepuff. So me and Harry had to go our separate ways. So I kissed him goodby and left.
"What's going on, and why does Harry think he is going to die!" I yelled now worried.
I hugged Harry as Ron ran up to her.
"Well, we have time to think. Come on let's go get breakfast." He said and took my hand.
"Well maybe if you stopped staring at Draco and staring off into space you would understand," Hermione said.
Draco yanked me away from her pushing me into Ron and Blaise.
I was about to say something but she said, "I am not an owl so I am done!" And walked away. Ron and I glared at each other but he walked away.
"You and Nevill?" Ron asked.
"As much as I love your suggestion I don't think that will work," Draco said smiling a bit.
"But how?" Ron asked.
"Leave us mutt. I'm having a moment with my Harry." Ginny said, grabbing my arm.
"No Hermione, I don't want to talk about it. And Blaise if you want to know then be around more often." I said and laid my head on the table, not even taking the food Draco set out for me.
"So are you ready to go to breakfast?" Draco asked.
"You promised you won't," Ron said upset.
Draco came in and said, "you can not let him do this! I swear if you do my father will hear about this and I will press charges!"
"I don't want to talk about it." I said, snuggling to him.
"The enemy?! Ron this is so we can make freinds." She turned to us two. "Where have you two been? Get ready for bed now! And go to separate places now!" She said.
"I'll do nothing to hurt my little Harry," Draco said.
"Why?" He asked.
"No your not. You are just going through something right now." I said.
As soon as we got to the common room I sat on a couch and cuddled my stuffed animals. Hermione and Ron sat on eather side of me.
I just ignored him again and went back to looking at Harry. I mean this is starting to worry me. How could I have not noticed before? Was I thinking that since everything is better now that only when I am bored I am noticing? Or am I imagining things.
He got low. "I am so sorry. I did not mean to leave him alive. I was sure that he was dead." Wormtail said.
He done as I asked, making me get louder. He leaned down next to my ear putting both hands on either side of my head. "You are so cute. I love you so much." He whispered and bit at my ear.
"Plus it's the weekend." Blaise said, coming to my defense.
Harry nodded and said, "okay. Cool."
We ate then left. The rest of the day we sat in our dorm and done nothing.
"Can't we just stay here tonight?" Blaise said scooting real close to Ron.
We all sat down and began eating lunch. Remus then came in. "So what has happened while I was gone?" He said.
I went up to our room for a bit and smelled something strange from Harry's trunk.
Harry pouted. "But I want to be with Draco." He said.
"I wish you were there." He said.
"Okay." I said.
I finally left the common room and headed to my shared dorm. "How is Ginny?" Ron asked.
"Draco's cuddly?" Lucius said with a raised eyebrow.
Hermione got up and grabbed some cloths from her bag. She tossed them to us and said, "I may not have more tents but. I do have cloths. We got up and got dressed separately. We then sat back down and began eating.
"Yes." I answerd.
"Thanks Dray." He said.
Remus made sure I was okay and told me I done a good job.
"How are we going to get a pass to look in the Restricted books?" Hermione asked, all to happy to change the conversation.
I laughed and said, "could have been worse."
After the game we went back to the tent and Ron is boasting about Victor Krum.
"I would love to. thanks Ron. Meet me at the Slytherin common room an hour before the ball." May said.
I got close to him. "You useless rat. I thought that you were better then this." I said and kicked him inbetween the legs.
"You can call me Lucius." Dad said.
"Cedric. How are you back? I saw you die." Harry said, getting right to the point.
So we all got up and left.
"No its not harry. I read up on them and it actually increases the happiness you have." Hermione said, smiling.
I smiled as they began showing me around. When Remus came back, I saw that he had a new box, he said that it was time to go. I nodded to him and waved goodbye to Fred and George, they smiled and said bye.
*Draco's P.O.V.*
Then we fell asleep on the couch.
"N- No." I stuttered.
"Yah. But I can't help but feel bad. I mean he tried killing himself for me. What should I do Mason?" I asked.
Harry p.o.v
"Thanks," I said.
He sighed and said, "Blaise got bitten by a werewolf. There in the hospital wing,now..."
We both walked in and went down to the Slytherin table.
"How did you figure this out? We did not while we were studying up on vamps." I said.
We all got up and said good night and went to our beds. I pulled Harry close and kissed him lightly. "Good night Harry. I love you." I said.
Harry p.o.v
So there is some good things to no kids.
"Nothing much. Just walking around. I'm bored." She said turning the camera in her hand.
After Viktor put his name in the goblet he winked at me and glared at Draco who bared his fangs at him.
"This leech is being a brat." Ron said.
He smiled as Snape came over. "It's not as horrible as I thought it would be with Mr. Potter working with you. Good job." He said, then he walked away.
"Harry, have you apparated before?" I asked.
"Yes." He took out a jar of spiders and placed one on the table. He cursed the spider and demonstrated what he could do to it. Made it dance on Goyle head and then nearly killed it.
He began walking back and led us to our room without kissing.
"Tease." I said and followed.
Yes I have Remus and Sirius but its not the same. So now I am just laying in my bed bored.
"Thank you Harry. Draco I'm sorry." She then said.
"After the ball we can tell them how good it was." Hermione said.
I growled and pushed her away, disgusted that someone that was not my mate touched me like that. "Don't ever touch me like that again." I said and her poise and 'alluring' aura just diminished.
"And why should we do that." I said, wiggling my eyebrows.
He held his arms out, a sign to carry him. I got up, picked him up, and carried him to the great hall.
He then gave me his robe to cover me up and we went to our common room. Luckily every one has went to there rooms and to bed. So we went up to our room and Ron and Blaise are not back yet. We just changed and went to bed.
He turned to me and walked to my side and licked my cheek. Every one laughed, but Hermione just rolled her eyes. "Dray! eww!" I yelled.
Once all the candy was gone, Draco had us lay down and cuddle.
"yes I am. I can't wait." I said and cuddled into him. Though I cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. I mean everything is perfect the way I always wanted it. And the same goes for Mason.
After lessons Harry, me, and our friends went to our common room.
Harry covered his ears, beginning to run through he halls saying, "la la la la I'm not a part of this I don't know them la la la la!" as I explain male to male sex to Ron.
