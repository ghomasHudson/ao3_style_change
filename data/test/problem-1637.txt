Draco placed a second sandwich on Harry‘s desk, then perched on the corner of it and bent down to kiss his boyfriend.
"No one forced you to steal my drink," Draco scoffed. He knew the beer was revolting and he definitely didn't need another reminder.
"Apparating drunk, Malfoy," Potter tsked and erased the distance between them. He stopped just inches from Draco and peered into Draco's eyes. His gaze was dazed but it held a great deal of softness Draco hadn't expected.
"Alpha?" Robards asked. There was only silence. "Alpha, confirm you are heading out," Robards said again.
"Come on, Malfoy," Potter jumped off the desk and went to read the memo that had just landed on his own desk. "Besides, I would make it good for you."
Harry looked up towards the landing of the wooden staircase, half-obscured by the darkness. The banister was beautifully carved, made of the same rich wood as the stairs. The last remnants of daylight had disappeared and the only illumination provided to the corridor they were standing in was from the streetlamps outside. Harry tried to remember every advice Draco had given him during their sparse training sessions. He patted the pocket of his trousers, checking the flashlight was still there. He checked the temperature on his digital thermometer.
Harry followed him slowly, dragging his feet behind, lost in thought. Something was nagging at the back of his mind. Something about what Draco had just said didn't sit right with him for some reason. Harry tried to push the feeling away. Malfoy had been in the business much longer than Harry and he knew so much more about the ghosts. There was no reason to doubt his experience and knowledge. He found Draco standing at a kitchen counter, pouring water into a kettle from the tap. Harry sat down and absentmindedly played with the sleeve of his shirt, listening to the soft, tinkling noises coming from Draco's direction.
He steeled himself and crept a little closer still. He breathed in and out and sprung into action from his hiding spot.
The salty and bitter liquid splashed inside Draco‘s mouth. He eagerly swallowed all of it. He felt Harry tremble under him as he rode out his orgasm. Draco kept sucking Harry‘s prick softly, rolling his tongue over the sensitive tip and inside the slit, until Harry held his head with both hands and pushed Draco away.
„Bad day at work, it‘s nothing,“ Harry shrugged. He didn‘t want to talk to Ginny about the doubts about Draco that kept coming back. He loved her as a sister but he was not ready to talk to anyone about Draco. Not until he found out what was going on. „What did you need?“
"Shush, don't be daft," Hermione smiled. "I won't think that. You deserve happiness. I would be a shitty friend if I stood in the way."
„I really, really, really hate you. You have no idea how much I want to grab you by the collar, throw you on the table and...“ Harry trailed off, searching for words.
didn't you understand? You touch that wand again and I'll shove it up your arse so hard you're going to walk funny for a week," Draco spat. He frowned when he noticed Potter's suddenly flushed face. A small part of Draco's brain supplied that the look was rather attractive on him.
Harry cringed inwardly at the tinge of desperation colouring his voice. Malfoy looked at him as if he was trying to see through Harry's skin and flesh, all the way to his heart.
Draco teased him, played with him, his free arm stroking Potter's thigh and arse gently. Draco bent over him and kissed Potter's shoulder.
"There is a client waiting to see you, Mr. Malfoy," Pansy announced, her voice professional. The knowing smirk was anything but. "Mr. Gladstone owns a Bed & Breakfast under Ben Nevis," she said and left the room, not before quirking an eyebrow at Draco and snorting.
, Draco thought. He'd dreamed of Potter kissing him but he realized he wasn't ready, not yet. He panicked. He pushed hard at Harry's chest, who clearly hadn't expected it, and landed on his arse on the hard wooden floor. Draco silently cursed when he noticed a flash of hurt flicker in those beautiful eyes.
They'd agreed they would enter one by one so that they accidentally didn't make contact with the door and cause any unwarranted noise. Draco was first with Potter in tow, then Smith, and lastly Nott.
"Potter!" Robards called after him but Harry was already Apparating back to the entrance of Gringott's Bank.
Harry knew Draco was only trying to make the arrest easier, provoking the person in front of him to give them as many incriminating details as possible.
"I… of course I would have gone," Harry said defensively and crossed his arms over his chest. He remembered Malfoy making the same gesture earlier and hurriedly stuffed his hands in his pockets instead.
The gesture seemed to infuriate Ron, just as Harry had hoped. He jumped over, grabbed Harry by the collar of his shirt, and lifted him up off the ground. Their faces were inches apart now, and Harry could see how bloodshot Ron's eyes were. His breath was hot against Harry's skin and it carried a whiff of Firewhiskey with it. Ron pushed him and Harry pushed back.
Draco heaved a sigh, trying to slow his rapidly beating heart. "I need to taste you," he confessed breathlessly.
Harry fell to his knees. He could barely breathe. Deep down he knew he was in shock but his mind couldn't seem to comprehend what was happening. They couldn't be gone, he gave them the adrenaline shots. They had to be alive, the medi-wizards were wrong. He started crawling toward McLaggen and Montague. He could still save them. He didn't care how many people watched him or what they thought of him. He was going to save them.
Harry shifted over so that he was spooning Draco. He hugged him with one arm and pulled him close. Life could be amazing, Harry thought to himself as he inhaled the smell of Draco‘s shampoo and listened to his soft breaths. The last thought that crossed Harry‘s mind before he drifted off to sleep was how perfectly he and Draco fit together.
The lift came to a halt on the floor where the Regulation of Potion Usage and Utilization Department resided. They stepped out hurriedly, rushing to leave the awkward atmosphere behind them. Harry didn't let go of Draco's hand as they walked through the corridor to Draco's office. Harry felt overprotective of Draco as if every single person meant harm to him. He almost snarled at a wizard who nearly bumped into them in the corridor and only Draco's incredulous shake of the head stopped him from hexing the poor fella. Harry couldn't wait for this to be over, for life to go back to normal.
"Oh, I'm good, thank you. I was actually thinking we could talk in private," Ginny turned her disbelieving gaze at Harry.
"You're suspended for disobeying a direct order of your superior. One month without pay," Robards said, turned on his heel, and left.
Draco reached up to his custom-made shoulder holster and pulled out the thermometer. The shoulder holster held some of his smaller equipment. Beside the thermometer, there were two magnesium flares, a flashlight, and now, courtesy of Granger, two adrenaline shots. His belt held a silver-tipped rapier.
Greyback is holding Draco up in the air by his neck, claws threatening to puncture the soft beautiful skin Harry has traced with his fingers just moments before. Draco's legs kick in the air defenselessly.
Harry took in the desolate state of the room, the torn mattresses, the heap of furniture in the corner he'd levitated there. Right, that had changed.
"I might as well tell you. I'll be dead soon anyway," Malfoy utters those words flatly, without emotion. "I'm in love with you. I've been in love with you for a while."
„Albino peacocks are herbivores, darling,“ Pansy replied, waving her hand dismissively. „And then he couldn‘t climb down on his own and started screaming bloody murder. I had to run back to the Manor and get his mother to rescue him.“
"Arrange a meeting with Granger for today," he said and turned back toward his office. He decided to order some sandwiches and wait for Granger's reply. "And stop using magic for menial tasks you bint, how many times do I have to tell you?"
Draco forced himself to breathe in and out slowly. He needed to find Potter as soon as possible but at the same time he knew staying cautious was his top priority if he wanted to survive the night and get out of here alive. He stopped moving and signaled Pansy to do the same. He let his eyes roam across the corridor, its end barely visible in the darkness. No ghosts so far. He listened to the house, hoping to hear Potter moving around. Instead, he could hear the faint whisper of the wind outside and an occasional creak of the floorboard in one of the rooms. There was no sign of Potter, as far as Draco could tell. No footsteps, no banging sounds. Nothing. He knew that back in school, Potter could never stay quiet. He was always moving, fidgeting with his robes, humming softly, or shuffling his feet across the floor. Maybe Potter changed during the Auror training program and had learnt how to stay still while waiting for criminals in dark alleys or abandoned warehouses.
"I don't want to be partnered with Ron, I want to be partnered with you," Harry fumed. He broke the eye contact and looked at the floor. He felt a blush creep up his neck and hoped Malfoy would think it was the anger. Because there was no way he wouldn't notice it, was there? Harry just wasn't that lucky.
"I know this is going to sound weird but…" Harry paused for a minute, then carried on, looking Draco in the eyes intently. "Can I kiss you? I need to kiss you one last time. I understand if you don't…"
Smith backed off and sent a Patronus to Robards, briefly describing their situation and requesting the Head Auror's presence at once.
"Shit," Harry cursed and started casting every unlocking and opening charm he'd ever learned. Nothing worked. "Tell Robards to get his arse here!"
He looked his own reflection in the eyes. No more wallowing in self-pity, he decided. He wanted to solve the Problem, help Hermione raise the baby, fall in love with Draco and be with him if only Draco let him. Harry gulped and watched the reflection of his eyes slowly turn from wide and a little lost to determined. He was going to be strong for the people he loved. And he would do everything in his power to have it all.
Harry smiled broadly, ignoring Malfoy's jibes. His heart was beating fast against his ribs. "That's brilliant, Malfoy! I can't wait to see you locate a Source," Harry jumped up from his chair in excitement and moved around the table to place his hands enthusiastically on Malfoy's biceps. "Do you see how amazing that is? We can actually help people!"
Ron stood with his back to Harry, his trembling fists held by his sides, his knuckles white. He was shaking as if trying to reel all the anger in. They stayed like that for a while, Ron breathing hard, Harry trying not to make a sound.
Harry whirled around and reflexively pressed a tip on his wand against Draco's pale throat. Harry breathed out in exasperation and forced himself to relax. Draco would surely drive him mental one day with his jokes and stunts. He lowered his wand and cast a mild Stinging Hex inconspicuously on Draco's bum.
„Why didn‘t you tell me?“ Harry asked him quietly. He couldn‘t look Draco in the eye, instead, he opted for looking at the floor.
Pansy's shrill laughter carried in from the reception area. "Draco spent hours over the weekend coming up with it."
"Please, yes, Draco, please, I need you, please, inside me," Harry babbled, just as another slap landed on his other cheek.
„Harry?“ Draco groaned. He shifted slightly and Harry tried to lift him up and cradle him in his lap. Draco‘s loud cry of pain thwarted his effort.
"I thought you changed," Harry shook his head, disappointed with himself for believing even for a second Malfoy was different now. "I thought you weren't a coward anymore. I can see I was wrong. You know what? I don't care, Malfoy, I don't need you. I'm going to do it alone," all of a sudden Harry felt furious with himself. For a second he'd dared to hope that his life would finally take a turn for the better. He'd allowed himself to imagine what working with Malfoy would have been like. In his mind, hunting ghosts was what he'd expected from becoming an Auror in the first place. He wanted to help people in a way that mattered, not shuffle paperwork around his desk or lose people on pointless assignments. For some bizarre reason he wanted to have that with Malfoy, he wanted to stand side by side with him, cast spells, protect people. He wanted to save Malfoy in a fight. Hell, he wanted to let Malfoy save him. He'd always secretly wondered what it would have been like if he shook Malfoy's hand on that fateful day; if they'd become friends in their first year. Harry's shoulders slumped. It wasn't going to happen. He started walking purposefully toward the fireplace in the reception area.
„That‘s why I love you,“ Harry laughed out loud and pulled Draco tightly against his chest. Draco huffed in surprise. Harry wrapped him in his arms and legs, imitating the tentacles of the Giant Squid that inhabited the Great Lake at Hogwarts. Reveling in the sensation of Draco‘s familiar weight on top of him, Harry squeezed even tighter. Draco pretended to trash against his grip and they ended up wrestling, naked, getting tangled in the white bedsheets. They rolled around, running hands over each other‘s bodies voraciously. Draco nipped at Harry‘s neck, while Harry retaliated by tickling Draco‘s sides.
„Clearly you don‘t trust me and you don‘t trust my judgment either,“ Draco laughed mirthlessly. The sound was so out of place it startled Harry.
"I'm just doing it for the money, fear pays well," Malfoy retorted and waved his hand dismissively but Harry knew it was an act. There was none of the scathing bite to his words that Harry was used to hearing from him at Hogwarts.
„Draco,“ Harry breathed out. He closed his eyes as the sensation of his prick rubbing against the coarse material of the upholstery sent a wave of pleasure through his whole body. Harry loved sex with Draco. It was never boring, never dull, never the same. Sometimes they would make love at dawn, looking into each other‘s eyes, kissing softly, professing their love through the gentle rocking motion of their bodies. Other times Draco would shove Harry against the nearest surface and give them both a rough hand job, both of their pricks squeezed tightly in his palm. And then, there were times like these, when Draco did whatever he wanted to Harry. These were the times when Harry was able to completely let go of himself and ride on the wave of pleasure Draco would provide.
„Fuck you, you arsehole. I can‘t do this right now,“ Draco spat, anger welling up in him as a response to Harry's shouting. He tried to grab a fistful of the Floo powder but missed the bowl. He knocked it to the floor and it shattered. The powder spread over the ground as a layer of ash. Draco swayed again and fell on his knees. He blindly scooped some powder from the floorboards, threw it into the fire, and shouted out his address.
"Copy, squads, Falcon ready," Robards replied. "Niffler and Alpha take the front door. Phoenix, secure the back, in case someone decides to slip out through there."
„Work, where else would I be?“ Draco looked up at him with a strange expression on his face. He looked a bit pale and tired.
Ron had no idea what to do. He wanted to leave but if he opened the door, now that both Harry and Malfoy were looking at it, they would see it move. He contemplated his options. Before he could decide what to do, the shock he was in not helping his brain work any faster, Harry had locked the door. Ron was screwed. Figuratively. Not literary. Harry was the one getting screwed. Right in front of Ron‘s eyes. And Ron was forced to watch.
"I'm not behaving like a child," Harry grumbled petulantly. He could practically feel Malfoy rolling his eyes. Harry sniffed indignantly and followed him back to the corridor. He wanted to protest some more but remembered Draco’s rules. He had to listen to him during the cases otherwise Draco would not take Harry with him next time.
"Ron, I want to apologize for not telling you about all of this earlier. I should have told you about Draco being kidnapped, I shouldn't have kept it a secret from you. It was a shit thing to do to a friend and partner. I just… I was trying to protect Draco… but I lost him anyway," Harry breathed out heavily.
"That's not what I want, Harry," Hermione got up and sat in Harry's lap. She curled around him, seeking warmth and safety. "You're my best friend and I want you to be happy. You deserve it, don't think otherwise. You've been alone for far too long and you deserve to have someone who would be there for you."
They had returned from the hospital two hours ago. Narcissa joined them for dinner in Grimmauld Place, then politely excused herself when Harry started yawning. He caught barely an hour of sleep last night and spent the whole day watching over Draco. Narcissa tried to persuade Harry to go home and have a nap but he wouldn't hear of it. He stayed by Draco's side, fussing over him and generally annoying Draco with hundreds of questions. Are you comfortable? Does anything hurt? Would you like anything? I will just quickly go to the toilet and be right back. Will you be OK alone for a bit? Are you thirsty? Do you want me to fluff up your pillows a bit?
"Are you sorry for being a brainless ponce or for not listening?" Malfoy's pale eyebrow shot up so high til it disappeared under his fringe.
Something shattered in his expression, his face had gone pale and his eyes darkened. He whirled around and slammed both hands onto the kitchen counter, steadying himself. Harry could hear his fast panting. The movement of his heaving chest made his whole torso move up and down heavily. He looked as if he was in pain, his knuckles white with the strength of his grip on the edge of the counter.
"So, I guess I'll see you on Monday?" Draco asked casually. Considering that his prick was constantly hard for three hours straight, he thought he managed the easy tone of his voice rather spectacularly.
Harry was knackered. He kicked off his shoes and shook out of his Auror robes. He rolled his head and shoulders to relieve some of the tension. Today had been a difficult day at work. He and Ron had spent weeks tracking a band of criminals who stole a batch of wands from Olivander‘s and used the wands to steal money and jewels from wealthy wizards. As the wands were not tied to them magically and didn‘t hold their magical signature, tracking the felons had been grueling and exhausting. Today they finally managed to locate the at-first-sight-abandoned warehouse where the wizards planned their next break-ins and stored the stolen wands. The raid on the warehouse was tough, with hexes and jinxes flying all over the place. In the end, they managed to pacify and arrest every single one of the offenders. Tomorrow was going to be another grueling day, full of interrogations.
The door burst open and Pansy barged in. "Once you're done fucking each other with your eyes, shall we talk about the Gladstone case?"
Harry blushed and was grateful for the darkness surrounding him. He took a deep breath and started slowly climbing up the stairs, his gaze flickering between the digital display of his thermometer and the landing. The staircase continued behind a bend to his right. He moved closer to the banister, copying it on his ascend. His position would give him an advantage, increasing his field of view behind the bend. When he reached the landing, he let out a breath he'd been holding. So far, the temperature was stable, seventeen degrees. He looked up, toward the waiting darkness of the first floor. He couldn’t see much. It appeared that the corridor ran perpendicularly to the stairs, meaning he could barely see anything from his position. He would have to climb the remainder of the steps to be able to survey either side of the corridor. He hated these kinds of house layouts; too many corners only made it easier for the culprits to hide behind them. Culprits being ghosts now, his mind supplied.
Draco eyed him warily. Potter was definitely behaving very strangely. Draco would have to try to peak into his medical records. Even though he rather enjoyed having Potter as a partner, he didn't think it was safe if Potter suddenly suffered from dementia.
„It wasn‘t a compliment,“ Harry squeaked and blushed. „He‘s so arrogant he can‘t even grab a fork like a normal person!“
Ron went for what he surely thought of as a killer-leap off the chair but miscalculated the jump. He landed on top of Seamus, who was still running around the podium. They both went down in a heap of limbs, however, that didn't dissuade them from continuing the song.
Harry didn‘t need any further encouragement. He set up a savage pace, slamming his prick balls deep into Draco‘s arsehole. He reveled in the sensation of the hot, tight, and slick hole gripping his cock mercilessly. He changed the angle slightly and hit Draco‘s prostate. Draco meowled under him so sweetly Harry shuddered and nearly came.
"Get the fuck out," Harry jumped out of his seat. "I asked you to help Draco, not accuse him of some fabricated crimes that never even happened. He has a respectable job at the Ministry and he's been trying to fight against all the shit like this he'd been exposed to by being as good a person as he could possibly be. I will not sit here and listen to this bullshit!"
Draco scanned the temperature by the first door and quickly glanced inside."Ten degrees, the room seems clear," Draco whispered.
Harry had to admit that the years had treated Malfoy kindly. He was wearing a crisp white shirt with the top two buttons undone, revealing a stretch of pale skin and jutting collarbones. His cornflower-blue trousers were adorned with a black, presumably designer, belt. Black lacquered shoes completed the outfit. The most interesting part of Malfoy's clothing, however, was a brown leather shoulder holster. Malfoy had always been taller than Harry but now his height was accompanied by a set of broad shoulders and a thin waist. If Harry didn't know any better, he would have thought that Malfoy lifted weights in his free time. Hard, lean muscles were visible where the sleeves of his shirt had been rolled up. His hair was as pale as ever, short on the sides, longer on top. Malfoy must have spent ages in the bathroom that morning styling his hair because the longer strands were arranged in artful waves. His face was smoothly shaved. From afar his skin looked baby-smooth and Harry felt a sudden compulsion to touch Malfoy's cheek to see for himself.
Harry sighed and headed to the bathroom. He had no chance to grab his cloak as he‘d originally intended but he had to get out of the Gryffindor tower. He locked himself in a cubicle and thought hard.
"Hmmpf, see that you do," she glided haughtily back inside the foyer, grabbed her handbag, and departed without another word.
"Oh, he's still pretty much an arrogant prat," Harry laughed. "Only, he's different too. I think deep down, he cares about other people, maybe too much, but he doesn't want anyone to see it. I think he's afraid of getting hurt. I have a feeling he went through something really bad. Something to do with the ghosts."
"Wow, that was epic," Potter breathed out and coughed. His eyes were lit up partially with amazement and partially by the reflection of the flames, quickly engulfing the mansion.
"Then go get him, you ponce! Go and fall in love with him all over again," Pansy shook her head fondly.
Harry flopped himself onto the ugly khaki sofa without a word. He glanced at the front cover of the booklet and stared at it for a moment in bemusement. There was an animated, cartoon version of Malfoy drawn in wizarding paint, his blonde hair shiny and impeccably styled. The figure sneered at Harry and a speech bubble appeared above its head
"You were always a man of stating the obvious, weren't you?" Malfoy chuckled. "I gathered as much, I wouldn't believe for a second this was a friendly visit."
Harry leaned in and pressed his lips lightly against Draco's. Draco melted into the touch and wrapped Harry in his arms again. Harry licked along Draco's bottom lip, then sucked it inside his mouth and bit it gently. Draco's knees buckled and he felt faint. Harry's kiss was the best thing he'd ever experienced. It was soft and sweet, exciting and heart-stopping, it tasted like sunshine after a storm. The feel of Harry's tongue against his own made Draco's head spin. It was everything he'd ever secretly envied his friends. Harry was his world. How could he have not seen it before? How did he not realize it sooner? Harry's loud moan startled him. Harry was everything Draco had ever wanted but Harry didn't like him that way. Harry didn't want him, he wanted someone else and Draco was just close by, good enough to wipe away the pain for a while but that was all. Draco pulled away.
„Come on, he‘s not worth it,“ Ron grabbed Harry by the arm and pulled him out of the classroom. Harry was staring after Malfoy with such an intense look in his eyes that Ron was grateful it was not directed at him.
Harry wants to shout, he wants to fly across the room and slam the werewolf into the wall, crack his skull against the stone but he can't do anything. He can only lie there, unmoving, forced to watch another horror of the war.
"They see through the Disillusionment Charm for fuck's sake. I don't think he will be fine for that long," Harry sighed. He surveyed the door again and sent out a tentative tendril of magic. The wards were indeed powerful, more than anything Harry had ever come into contact with. He thought hard. There were always weak places in the wardwork. There were hitches and loopholes one could exploit to their advantage, given enough time. However, time was not on Harry's side. Think Harry, he reprimanded himself. The door was protected with the strongest type of magic. But noone would surely spend that much time and magic on the walls. Harry's heart leaped. He walked over to the wall next to the door and pointed his wand at a section of it.
„Please, Ron, Hermione,“ Harry said calmly. „Don‘t call Draco Ferret, just call him Draco. It means a lot to me.“ He waved his arm about. „This means a lot to me. My two best friends and my boyfriend having a civilized dinner. Please?“
Harry panted loudly as anger reverberated through his whole body. How could Draco just stand there and lie straight to his face? It wasn‘t even a smart lie, such as Harry would expect from a Slytherin. It was a dumb lie, a stupid lie. Harry‘s hands formed fists, his fingernails drawing blood in half-circles across his palms. The sharp sting of pain helped him breathe. The anger slowly gave way to a different emotion. Dread. What had he done? Draco hadn't looked stunning the way he always did after sex. He looked awful, pale, his hair sticking in damp strands to his forehead, his face contorted in a grimace of pain. Why did Harry burst out like a bloody teenager, instead of facing the issue like a grown-up man? Like an Auror he was? Fuck, he was an idiot. He needed to see if Draco was OK. He was so stupid, he promised himself he would handle the situation calmly. And worse, he‘d promised Draco nothing would change the way he felt about him. Harry loved him. How could he have treated him this way without hearing his side of the story? Fuck, what if the person Ginny saw was not even Draco? Harry started shaking, this time not with anger, but with fear. He grabbed a pinch of Floo powder and threw it into the fireplace. He pronounced Draco‘s address as clearly as he could, considering his voice was trembling violently. Nothing happened.
"I was thinking how to go about this. I don't trust regular Aurors. I thought I would involve only Robards and Minister Shacklebolt. I want to force them to make an Unbreakable Vow not to involve anyone else," Harry mused.
"Don't remember that we what, Potter? Please try to talk sensibly for once in your life," Draco shifted in his seat uncomfortably. "And untie me, would you, you pervert?"
"You're falling apart and you've ruined my best silk blouse. All of that because you don't love him, my arse! So what you don't remember spending time with him, you are obviously still head over heels for him. You wouldn't be sitting here, sobbing like a bloody Hufflepuff if you didn't love him. You've had a crush on him since the fourth year, I'm pretty sure that it didn't go away! Now, did it?" she pushed him toward the fireplace.
Harry calls for a private meeting with the Head Auror and the Minister of Magic. He plans to lead a secret investigation to find out who tortured Draco.
Draco leaned over Harry. He kissed the vertebrae of his spine one by one, moving his way slowly from Harry's neck to his bottom. He bit the flesh of Harry‘s arse without warning and heard Harry gasp. Draco dropped to his knees behind him and parted his cheeks, blowing air over Harry‘s puckered entrance. He took Harry‘s whimpers as an assent to continue. He bent lower and licked the skin of Harry‘s balls, gently nipping, playing with the loose skin with his lips and teeth and tongue.
"Muscle memory," Harry whispered. He leaned closer and slid his hands under Draco's shirt, splaying his fingers over Draco's vertebrae. "Imagine your spine as the piano keys. Imagine learning a melody by heart and playing it over and over and over again. Years fly by and you stop playing, you haven't touched the piano in ages, you can't even recall the melody you used to play."
Harry didn't have an answer to that. Instead, he crossed the room and sat down next to Ron. He threw his arm around his best friend's shoulders and they stayed like that, each lost in their own thoughts.
Potter grinned. Draco measured him suspiciously. Had Potter suffered a head injury during his stay in the States?
„What‘s wrong?“ one of them, a tall witch in her mid-thirties, asked quickly. Her eyes widened slightly when her eyes landed on Harry‘s scar but she didn‘t comment on it.
Harry grips the base of Draco's half-hard cock and sucks it into his mouth. He tongues the slit and Draco's moans drive him forward. He hollows his cheeks and sucks harder, quick movements up and down the head of Draco's prick. Draco's hands sneak into Harry's hair and urge him to go deeper. Harry obliges, getting high on making Draco groan like that. He stops only to dip his fingers in the oily substance, then goes back to worshiping Draco's cock with his tongue. His slick fingers find Draco's opening. Draco's tenses above him.
They were sitting in a newly-opened Café in Diagon Alley. The light was quickly fading outside and Draco was starting to get nervous. He was losing time fast. He originally wanted to drag Potter's arse out of that house before it got fully dark. It was too late for that now, having to find out the location of the mansion first. He and Pansy would have to go in there, fully geared, and risk their lives for Harry bloody Potter.
"Like," Harry's breathing was ragged in Draco's ear as he slipped his hand to the front of Draco's trousers and palmed his hard cock through the fabric. The touch was electric and Draco felt his balls draw up.
"Yes, you're part of Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. now, for as long as you wish. No matter what happens," he said at last.
For the first five days of his suspension, Harry stalked around his flat, grumbling at the injustice he had been subjected to. He re-organized his kitchen cupboards and sorted the food ingredients by alphabet. He cleared out his wardrobe, throwing out clothes he no longer wore. He went through his stores of emergency potions and stocked up on Hangover and Pepper-Up potions. Once his flat gleamed with cleanliness, he packed his bag and moved to Hermione's flat for a few days, where he proceeded with his bout of cleaning and managed to reorganize all her bookcases in one day, while Hermione was at work. When she returned, she screamed at him for what seemed like an eternity and forced him to put the books back to their original place. That was easier said than done as Harry couldn't remember the books' former placement on the shelves and he spent another four days on that task until Hermione was satisfied.
Potter seemed to soak in every bit of information Draco provided him with, his eyes wide and startlingly green. "That is amazing, I can't believe you figured all of this out on your own. So basically, there is salt, I knew about that one actually. Hermione read in a book somewhere that in the past, salt was used as a protection against ghosts. Then there's iron. It blocks the ghost's abilities, correct?"
"No, you certainly don't," Draco smiled that sharp smile again. "But the more you protest, the clearer the answer becomes." Draco bared his teeth.
Harry and Draco had made an agreement that their relationship would stay their sweet little secret. None of their friends knew they were dating. They never went out to dinners where they could be seen, either opting for take-away or Harry cooking them decent dinners. In the beginning, it had seemed like a great idea, staying hidden, where no one could meddle in their improbable and unexpected relationship.
„Better?“ Draco asked softly, his mouth slowly moving down, his tongue leaving a wet shiny path along Harry‘s neck.
It's nearly dawn when they come for them. Clean pants and trousers are thrown their way and they are made to dress in them. They hold hands as they walk out of the cellar, seeking comfort in what might be the last moments of their lives. They are led into a large, spacious room, a reception room of sorts. They are pushed in, Bellatrix gleaming with delight near a fireplace, Greyback snickering at them from his seat in an ornate armchair. Lucius Malfoy, his face ashen and contorted in a mask of pain, Narcissa Malfoy, her face buried in her husband's shoulder. A hooded person stands in front of a floor-to-ceiling window, his back turned to the room.
Draco whimpered. „About as bad as when you told me you wanted to throw me onto the table in the bloody Great Hall and fuck me right there?“ Draco grabbed Harry‘s bobbing dick and started tugging it with rapid movements of his hand.
"It got me thinking how strange it was that ghosts leave no traces. And then it hit me. They can leave a trace under certain conditions, an imprint if you will. Footsteps on a dusty floor or a bloodstain on the bedsheets. I've never really thought about it before but I think these traces are formed of ectoplasm."
He was old, Draco guessed around seventy. His remaining hair was gray and fell limply down to his shoulders, the skin on his face and hands covered in liver spots. He smelled of tobacco. Not the sharp, acidic stink of cigarette smoke that got stuck in the back of one's throat but the sweet scent of a freshly lit pipe.
"OK, whenever you're ready," Harry grabbed Draco's hands in his and ran his thumbs across Draco's knuckles. "We should start with the facts. What do we know?"
Harry's Expelliarmus shot out of his wand a second later but he knew it would reach Ginny too late. He watched helplessly as Ginny's spell hit Draco in the middle of the chest and he slumped briefly in his seat. Harry's spell threw Ginny a few meters back, her wand safely landing in Harry's outstretched hand. He heard Robards's shout to his left and trusted him to apprehend Ginny. Harry sprinted across the room and nearly threw himself at Draco. He kneeled in front of him and scanned him quickly for any visible injuries.
"I wanted to make sure you were alright, after…" Ginny trailed off when she noticed Draco lying on the sofa.
"Come on, stop dawdling. We have to educate you properly so that you can become a real, self-sufficient ghost-hunter who doesn't try to get himself killed the second we enter a first haunted house together," with that, Malfoy patted Harry's leg and crossed the room to an empty blackboard.
The foyer had been grand in its day from what Harry could see by the pale light of the full moon, illuminating the room in places. Dark wooden paneling decorated the walls. There was a broken glass chandelier hanging from the two-storey-high ceiling. Spiderwebs were strewn across it and all over the broken remains of furniture that used to adorn the room. Everything was covered by a thick layer of dust.
Harry watched Ron's, Seamus's, and Dean's heated argument about which Quidditch team would win the league this year. He raised from his chair and started heading toward his bedroom inconspicuously. It was quarter to 9 and if he wanted to be on time for his meeting with Malfoy, he had to grab the Invisibility Cloak and head out.
Draco allowed his mind to wander. Potter was holding his hand. Did that mean he actually cared about him? Draco had a vague feeling Potter had called him Draco before but he wasn't sure if it really happened or if it was only a wishful figment of his imagination. Potter's hand was warm in his. Draco allowed himself to stroke his thumb in a circular motion across the soft skin. He could get used to this. His heart constricted painfully in his chest with hope.
"Through here, Mr. Gladstone. Would you like tea or coffee?" Pansy's voice was dripping with politeness.
"I… I'm not sure. There is one thing though," Draco said. "I received a letter by Owl every day since, which was weird. I don't usually receive Owls at work, it's either memos or Firecalls. I don't remember reading the letters. Honestly, come to think of it, I don't even know where I put them."
"Coming," Harry replied, dried his hands on his jeans, and went to meet Hermione. He gave her a quick hug and wondered what had gotten her so excited.
Draco breathed in and out. They were both staring into each other's eyes. The time was frozen around them for what felt like hours. Finally, Draco sighed loudly.
„Yeah,“ Harry winced. Kissing Ginny after the war had never felt right. Their relationship was dead inside and never picked up when they left Hogwarts. Harry kept persuading himself he was ruined by the constant battles, loss, and pain. It had made him sick, thinking he would never lead a normal life, he would never feel what it was like to be consumed by love for someone and being loved unconditionally in return. He'd started to realize that the problem might lie elsewhere during his Auror training. He remembered the excitement of training, being pressed against the other trainees during the simulated raids and arrests. He recalled his cock thickening afterward in the showers, when he sneaked brief, shameful glances at the other trainees, naked under the spray of water, soaping their wet bodies. Yet, he never pursued his fantasies. He was dating Ginny and would never cheat on her. He never wanted to hurt her feelings. He had loved Ginny but slowly he came to realize it was more of a sibling love than a love that would make his heart pound in his chest and give him butterflies in the stomach.
"Yeah, a right hag she is. Anyway, we might have to come back here. The Source might be hidden somewhere in this room but we have to let the ghost lead us to it."
"You're such a twat," Harry snorted and batted away Draco's hand which was still resting on his shoulder.
On the night Harry had broken up with Ginny, finally admitting to himself that he was not interested in women that way, he went out drinking alone to a gay muggle bar. To his surprise, he met Draco there. One thing led to another and they ended up in Harry‘s bedroom in No. 12 Grimmauld Place. Over the course of that night, to Harry's utter surprise, he came to realize that Draco was not only hilarious and witty but considerate and sweet as well. What started as a one-night stand turned into a week-long affair and from there it gradually grew into a loving relationship.
"Actually, I'm rather curious myself. Why don't you give me the memory of you seeing Draco cheating on me?" Harry Accioed an empty vial from the Auror robes. He kept it there for emergency memory extractions. He offered Ginny the vial.
They returned to the corridor and stopped in the centre of it, at the top of the stairs leading back to the ground floor. Draco looked up and groaned. The wooden rectangle on the ceiling above him gave him the creeps. There was a string affixed to one end. It dangled above Draco's head, in what he thought was rather a mocking irony.
"No, Brook. I… I'm not feeling too well. I will be taking another day off today," he replied, trying to hide the tremble in his voice.
"Harry, please," Kingsley Shacklebolt reached out a hand and placed it soothingly on Harry's shoulder. "If we assembled a full team of Aurors, the investigation would move faster."
"That's fine," Draco tried to sound nonchalant while hoping at the same time no more hugs were at hand. "We should find the speccy git before he gets himself killed. Any ideas where he might have gone?" Draco arched his eyebrow.
"I didn't steal him, you pillock. He left you because he's gay. Nothing you do to me will ever change that!" Draco struggled in his bonds.
The Aurors had learnt the hard way over the past months that the newly risen ghosts could not be destroyed by magic. Spells passed through them easily, potions didn't seem to affect them in the slightest and all the curses and hexes in the world couldn't save you when you faced a spectre. They also found out that when a ghost touched you, you died a painful death within minutes. So far, there was no cure. Many good Aurors died in vain and the Ministry of Magic seemed to be in a state of upheaval. Harry tried to force them to take action, to make the Unspeakables research ways to kill the ghosts, if they could be killed, or find means to combat them. However, all the Ministry seemed to be doing was debating and discussing the Problem, as it was now called.
„Play nice, you promised,“ Harry leaned back into him and whispered in Draco‘s ear. He placed his arms over Draco‘s in a comfortable manner. His friends both gaped at him as if he‘d sprouted additional heads but Harry wasn‘t going to push Draco away. He was determined to show Draco how much he loved him by these small gestures and at the same time show his friends how amazing Draco actually was, now that he‘d broken out of his father‘s influence.
Pansy threw herself around Theo's neck, nearly sending them both sprawling on the floor. She wrapped her arms around his neck and squeezed him tightly. "I'm so glad you're back, I missed you so much!"
"Theo started calling them Type Zero. But in all honesty, I haven't seen one since the day the new types of ghosts emerged. I often wonder what had caused them to disappear but I never came across any clue that would point me in the right direction. It is as if one day, the old ghosts vanished without a trace and the new ones replaced them, out of nowhere, with the ability to kill people."
Draco peeked gingerly into the plastic bag Potter had thrust into his hand. There were dozens of different American sweets, wrapped in colourful packaging. Draco fished around in the bag and pulled out a navy blue Muggle hoodie with CHICAGO printed in large white block letters on the back. There was also a kitsch souvenir of something that distantly reminded Draco of a silver Bertie Bott's Jelly Bean.
"Thank God you're awake, I thought I'd lost you," the heavy weight lifting off his chest. Seeing Draco blink those beautiful grey eyes at him was one of the most precious sights he'd ever seen.
They were both sweaty and sticky, both panting hard. Harry pressed his forehead against Draco‘s, waiting for his breathing to slow.
"And the pain you mentioned you'd been feeling?" Robards asked. "Was it always as bad as when you ended up in the hospital or did it increase gradually?"
He crossed the room and kissed Draco fiercely. He slid his hands under Draco‘s cashmere sweater to caress the soft skin on his lower back.
„Leave me alone,“ Harry shouted and all the bottles in the liquor cabinet, the glass windows and door panes, the chandelier, exploded. Glass shards littered the floor around them. Ginny screamed shrilly.
Tracey didn't move. A chill started creeping up Harry's spine again and he looked around briefly. The ghosts had reformed again in the corners of the room and were floating toward him, faster this time. The slight movements of their limbs seemed eager as if they longed to reach him at once. Harry whipped around again and slapped Tracey across the cheek.
Draco woke up in the hospital. Again. He was quite familiar with his surroundings and wasn't surprised at all to see the white ceiling above him. What was new, however, was the feeling of something warm curled in his palm. Draco moved his head. It was a hand. Harry Potter was sitting in a chair next to the bed, fast asleep, holding Draco's hand.
"Harry, wait. I think I know why the spell didn't work," Draco's heart rate sped up. He took a deep breath, hoping his deduction was correct. "I'm so stupid for not realizing sooner. The iron prevents ghosts from entering the protective circle. It blocks off the ectoplasm entirely. It means we can't cast the spell from inside the circle."
"That's bullshit and you know it," Harry bellowed. "People are dying out there while the Ministry hides from the truth. We need to take precautions, we need to be safe while doing our job!"
They were standing in front of the fireplace in Grimmauld Place, about to leave for work. Draco rolled his eyes and stepped through the Floo, leaving Harry behind with a snicker.
Draco looked around. He was lying in a standard hospital room, the walls were painted in an awful shade of pastel green which was presumably but unsuccessfully meant to calm the patients down. He noticed Harry, sitting on a chair close to the foot of Draco‘s bed, his head resting on his left arm, face turned toward Draco‘s. His eyes were closed and he was breathing softly. Harry‘s right arm was reaching for Draco‘s hand, their fingers nearly touching but not quite, as if even in his sleep Harry wasn‘t certain his touch was welcome. Draco examined Harry more carefully. He was still beautiful, his hair as unruly as ever, but he looked terrible. There were deep purple circles under his eyes, his cheeks were streaked with dried tears, his eyelids seemed puffy.
They Apparated close to a decrepit mansion in the middle of nowhere. The mansion stood on a cliff, overlooking a bend of a river. The atmosphere surrounding the house was suffocating and already from afar Pansy could feel a strange presence emanating from the house. As if something was waiting for them inside, luring them in. Draco had quickly explained to her what Tracey had told him about their unsuccessful mission. Pansy shivered when she imagined entering the house, considering its gory and dark history. She selfishly wished Theo was back. It would mean Pansy could have stayed at home, safely tucked in her own bed, hidden behind protective iron wards and bouquets of dried lavender.
Hermione‘s eyes widened comically. Her hand flew to cover her mouth in surprise. Ron on the other hand...
"Why are we doing this for Potter of all people?" Pansy whined as she followed him. She didn't want to be ghost-touched and die, least of all to save Scarhead, a raging lunatic.
"My thoughts exactly," Draco nodded approvingly. "We'll decide later on based on the temperature checks but so far, the ground floor looks safe. You know, you're surprisingly good at this. I'm glad you're here with me tonight."
„Draco, I know you hate me right now but don‘t let that have an effect on your health, please. At least let me take you to the hospital to make sure this is not something serious. And when you‘re feeling better, you can shout at me all you want. I really wish you would shout at me and tell me what an idiot I am. I deserve that and more because honest to God I hate myself right now. I understand if you never forgive me because I will never forgive myself. I just wanted to tell you that I will be here for you. I will stand by you and help you figure this out, whatever is happening to you. I will be here for you as much as you let me. And once you‘re back to full health and decide you want me to leave, I will. You will never have to see me again. You will never have to hear from me if that‘s what you want. Just let me help you through this,“ Harry whispered beseechingly, his voice breaking several times.
"Fuck," Draco cursed and got on his feet. He pressed his hand against the wound. He didn't have time to check how serious it was. Adrenaline was pumping through his veins and thankfully he couldn't feel any pain yet. He sprinted toward the hostages and cast a quick Finite Incantatem. To his relief, it worked as expected and the chains shackling the hostages disappeared.
"Close," the corner of Draco's mouth lifted slightly. "Leave your emotions out of it. But I want to know what happened. Will you tell me? Later?"
"Action is my middle name," Harry wiggled his eyebrows at her and truly smiled for the first time in several days.
"I thought you trusted me," Ginny's lower lip wobbled. "I care about you, Harry. I would never lie to you, you know that, don't you?"
"Of course not, why would I?" Draco raised his eyebrows in a manner that suggested he found such an idea preposterous. He continued in a soothing voice. "You must understand, this is a standard question I have to ask. For a ghost to appear, there needs to be a death first. You grew up in a wizarding family. Have you ever heard any stories, let's say about some distant relative, great-grandparent, or such, dying in a magical accident or by someone's wand? I understand you are trying to distance yourself from the wizarding world but any such information would help us in making your establishment safe again."
Draco woke to an empty bed. He sat up, yawned, and scratched his belly languidly. He Accioed his emerald green silk robe and wrapped it around his naked body. He padded down the stairs in search of Harry. He followed the sounds of banging to the kitchen. Harry was dressed in his black pajama bottoms, his torso and feet were bare, muscles jumping in a symphony across his back as he bustled around the kitchen. Draco leaned in the doorway and observed Harry with adoration. Harry hadn't noticed his presence yet and was whistling a jaunty tune they'd heard on a Muggle radio weeks ago.
And then you came along. I still remember the night we met in that bar vividly. I remember every detail when I saw you standing there, with a glass of bourbon, observing the crowd. You were like a beacon of light, I was drawn to you, I couldn't keep my eyes off of you. Yet, I would have never approached you on my own. I felt raw, vulnerable, too scared to open myself to potential pain (yes, I thought you would taunt me and call me names and you would end up cutting me deeper than anyone I knew ever managed). But you never did. You sat down next to me and gave me that look. I think I was in love with you since that moment. It was then that I felt myself fall. Fall into your eyes. You were the first person in my life who saw me for who I really am. You helped me gather up the courage to start a new period of my life.
Draco wished Theo was here now instead of Pansy. She didn't have much experience in the field and even though she followed his orders well, he never felt truly comfortable with her guarding his back. Theo, on the other hand, was like his shadow. They were always aware of each other's position, anticipating each other's actions and movements. Sometimes Draco felt as if they could read each other's minds without the use of Legilimency. He missed Theo and hoped he would be back soon.
Draco moaned and slipped his fingers out of Potter's hole. He scooped out more lube and coated his dick with it. He lined himself against Potter's entrance and slowly pushed in. He fought to be gentle when all he wanted to do was pound hard and fast into that delicious heat.
It was past eight when Draco stepped through the Floo back to Grimmauld Place. He was infinitely grateful to his mother for the talk they'd had. Narcissa tried to make Draco see the problem from all angles. She encouraged Draco to try to imagine being in Harry's shoes. How would Draco feel, how would he behave? What Harry did was wrong and there was no excuse but she'd smiled at Draco and told him that all relationships had hardships. When she saw Harry in the hospital, distressed and in panic, she knew he loved Draco deeply. Now it was up to both of them to make the best of the mistakes they made. If Harry understood what he'd done wrong and wanted to atone, it meant he truly loved Draco. However, if he dismissed his actions and started behaving that way repeatedly, Draco should get out of such a relationship. It would mean Harry didn't truly love him and therefore the relationship would not be worth continuous pain on Draco's part. Narcissa had smiled at him and said that that was not the case of their Harry for sure. Draco's heart leaped at the words. Their Harry.
„Let‘s do that then,“ Draco purred. In one swift motion, he turned Harry around and forced him to bend over the arm of the sofa.
Fuck but why did Potter have to be so sweet and attentive? Draco had expected Potter would tear their clothes off, pound Draco hard into the mattress and leave. Draco had been ready for that. But seeing the considerate expression in Potter's face was torture and it would hurt so much more when Draco woke up in the morning to an empty, cold bed. Draco tried to breathe as his airway constricted painfully. How was he going to get up and function normally after this?
Harry was taken aback. Surprised, he sat up straighter in his chair. "Are you actually worried about me?"
"Stop stalling and tell me. I swear I won't tell anyone. Not even Pansy and if you knew her, you'd understand how dangerous business that is. She would torture me if she ever found out I kept such a juicy gossip from her," Draco shuddered when he imagined Pansy's revenge. She would definitely take her sweet time with him, that was for sure.
"Mostly Muggles," the old man replied. "You see, Jackie and I are both Squibs. Most of the wizards tend to look down on us. We prefer to steer clear of them."
They left the canteen a few minutes later and Harry said his goodbyes to Draco in the lift. There was too much tongue and groping, judging by the gagging sounds that were coming from the corner where Ron was standing. Harry couldn't care less.
"OK," Harry whispers and gets up. He crosses the room and picks up the discarded vial. There is some oil left in it still. He sits gingerly back on the cot. "I won't hurt you, I promise."
Draco whimpered involuntarily. Potter turned to him, their faces suddenly too close. Draco cleared his throat. Potter bit his lip and smiled.
"Let me show you what I think about that," Draco patted his thighs in an invitation for Harry to sit on top of him. He was biting his lip seductively.
Draco chuckled but relented. He Accioed a jar of lube and quickly coated his dick with a generous layer of it.
"As I said before, we're both idiots. Now, you have years of sex to catch up on and you have to figure out if you prefer topping or bottoming. Are you up for it?" Harry quirked his eyebrow in an imitation of Draco's signature expression.
Harry's green eyes bore into his, full of hope and love, desire and lust and longing. Oh my God, Draco thought. He was the most oblivious fool out of all the oblivious fools in the whole world. There was never anyone else. Harry wanted him. Draco wanted to punch himself for not seeing it sooner.
"It's all ready to go. What happened?" Pansy asked. She snapped into business mode, all her pretentiousness gone.
Harry's body jerked as he landed on top of McLaggen's body in the reception area of St Mungo's hospital. The room was in disarray, medi-wizards, and Aurors alike shouting and running around. A hand gripped Harry's arm and pulled him off McLaggen. Harry looked up into Robards's face which was screwed up in fury.
"Yes," Draco whispered, realizing he meant it. He wanted nothing more than to comfort Harry, press his body against his own chest and never let him go.
Potter giggled. He giggled a lot, Draco realized with a start. They entered the bedroom and Potter immediately spun around and pounced on Draco. He tore at his clothes with his hands and tore at his mouth with his lips, teeth, and tongue. Before Draco could say Slytherin, he was naked.
Harry led Draco to the bathroom. He was blushing slightly and fidgeted with the collar of his shirt. He opened the door gingerly and let Draco step in first.
"You're lucky you're gay," Hermione snorted some minutes later. "If you get a boner, I'll throw you out of the bed regardless."
"Hmmm," Draco replied and inhaled the scent of Harry's shampoo deep into his lungs. He let his breath out slowly. He decided right there and then that Harry in his arms was all he could ever need.
"Oh, of course, I should have realized," Mr. Gladstone sighed. "Please, stop by any time on Friday, Jackie and I will be waiting for you."
He slid his soapy palm to the front of their bodies, grabbing both of their erections, and started moving his hand up and down languidly.
No words can express how ashamed I am for not being able to control myself better. I can only promise you that I will do everything in my power not to behave like that ever again. I have decided that once we find out who is hurting you, and they are safely locked up in Azkaban, I will start going to therapy.
Harry had moved lower, he was running his tongue across Draco's abs, nearing his crotch. Harry's tongue sent sparks into Draco's prick and his head was spinning again from breathing too shallow and too fast. Draco felt he would faint any second from the pure excitement of having Harry touch him.
„You‘re killing me,“ Harry‘s voice sounded deep and hoarse. „Please just fuck me already, I need to feel you inside me. I‘ve been waiting for you thrust inside me for ages by now. That‘s enough of foreplay,“ Harry babbled.
"Harry, for fuck's sake, could you be any clumsier!" Hermione snapped at him when Harry inadvertently dropped a bottle of Skele-Gro potion on the floor. It shattered and splashed all over the room.
Harry brushed the hair off of Draco's face and pressed their foreheads together. "I'm so glad I have you back, Draco. I don't know what I would have done without you. You're everything to me and I can't imagine you not being a part of my life. I swear I want you forever and ever."
Harry's narrowed eyes bore into Draco. Even in the dark, he could feel the intensity of the glare. Suddenly, Harry started laughing. The sound was so unexpected, that Draco almost flinched. Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco's, making warmth spread through his chest.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He backed away slowly, his eyes squeezed shut, and bumped into a chair. It screeched on the wooden floor.
"First of all you don't need new shoes, you just want them. And second of all, no. Draco, I'm sorry but no," Harry said resolutely.
"I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important. And besides, it's not for me, it's for Draco. He's been very sick and this will help him feel better. If you go now, I will tell Draco you did this for him all by yourself," Harry added slyly.
"I would love to hear what you have to say about that, actually," Draco's smile was predatory, like a cat about to pounce on a mouse. And not in play. "Mmmm, right there Harry, that's good," he purred softly, making his voice maddeningly sexy on purpose. He bit his lip and threw his head back, exposing the long, lean line of his pale throat to the room.
"What are you waiting for then?" Draco grabbed Potter's hand urgently before either of them had a chance to sober up and change their minds. They staggered out of the pub, Draco grabbed Potter around the waist and Apparated them into his flat.
"We should talk about this later, now's not the time. Do you remember rule number eight?" he asked and turned toward Harry. Even though his eyes were shiny with unshed tears, Draco looked more composed with every breath he took. Harry admired the level of self-control Draco had.
"For the love of...," Harry sighed in exasperation. "You're not a consolation prize. You never will be."
"I want to hear you say it," Harry takes a step closer to Malfoy and nearly places his hand on his shoulder but stops himself. It is weird, with them both being nearly naked.
„That would be lovely, Harry. I can‘t wait to finally meet him! It‘s been so nice to see you smile again after everything you‘ve been through. You deserve to be happy. I‘m sure we will find him as amazing as you do,“ Hermione smiled at Harry enthusiastically.
She wondered if the world would be different had Kingsley Shacklebolt survived the Second Wizarding War, had he become the Minister of Magic instead of Scrimgeour. Maybe the magical world wouldn't have been in such disarray now. Maybe the Problem would actually be acknowledged by the government instead of being swept under the rug. Maybe the Aurors would have better equipment to deal with the ghosts. Maybe the healers would be allowed to search for the cure among the Muggle medicine as well. Maybe.
"Working with you might actually be the best thing that happened to me in a very long time," Potter turned serious and leaned tentatively closer in his chair.
"I thought you would be happy, you can be partnered with your precious Weasley now!" Malfoy shouted back. He jumped up as well.
"There aren't many options for a gay man who happens to be a former Death Eater, are there? The disgusted looks I get, the insults thrown my way, it kind of makes it hard to find someone who would want me. And those who wanted to take me to bed were all perverts, seeking the thrill of fucking a Death Eater. You have no idea what filth some people are able to let out of their mouths. And I would never pay for sex, ever," Draco shook his head vehemently. He swirled the beer in his glass, looking anywhere but at Potter.
"Let me try something," Draco whispered so quietly he could barely hear himself speak. "Close your eyes."
"Alright," she said, unperturbed by his pleading, and took a bite. "I think I figured it out. I just need to make sure the spell is safe but I think I'm very close. Basically, I combined three different principles from three different spells. The most important one being the memory extraction spell, the one you use to store your memories in a Pensieve. That forms the basis of the spell. However, it only works for insubstantial thoughts while we're dealing with ectoplasm, which is a substantial matter. For that reason, I decided to tweak it slightly, merging it with an
"I love you too, Harry. Promise me you won't do anything rash, I don't want you to end up in Azkaban instead," Draco moaned. It was harder for him to think, let alone speak. Harry's hand tightened around his cock and it was now a blur of movement.
"Not really, it wasn't the same without you," Malfoy smirked. Then, as if he realized what he had inadvertently admitted, he looked away and took a long sip of his Firewhiskey.
Kreacher made a show of looking around. „Kreacher does not see Master Draco. Kreacher concludes Master Draco is not here.“
Harry looked up at Malfoy who was staring at him with a strange expression on his face that Harry couldn't decipher.
Draco chuckled and continued. "I remember I went to my office after that and worked as usual. I finished as always at four, went to the Atrium, and took a Floo home. To Harry's I mean."
"I thought you hated me! I thought you would never have me so I tried to find someone like you instead. Except, no one was ever good enough. Not blonde enough, not pale enough, not snarky or feisty enough… no one was ever you, you utter twat," Potter shook his head. "I can't believe you've wanted me all along."
Draco set down the fork and knife on the sides of his plate. He took a sip of wine and tried to formulate his answer thoroughly. "It all started on Monday. I stopped by in Harry's office on Monday morning, Harry had forgotten his lunch at home." Draco smirked at Harry.
"You're beautiful, I love you. You're so gorgeous, stunning, I can't take my eyes off of you. God Draco, I'm so happy you're alright," Harry whispered as he drew circles with his free hand across Draco's abdomen, his other arm still wrapped securely over his chest.
Harry wandered into the drawing-room and fell down heavily on the loveseat facing the fireplace. He looked into the flames, not really seeing anything. Even though it was the end of May, the Manor was cold and the fire helped keep the chill of the evening at bay. There was a sound of footsteps in the corridor on the polished wooden floor. To his surprise, he was joined by Narcissa.
Potter woke up with a start and snatched his hand back as if burned. Draco's stomach lurched. His heart gave another painful beat, this time stung by the obvious rejection.
"Haven't you noticed that everyone I slept with was tall, lean, and blond?" Potter asked with a genuine interest in his voice.
The door of Draco's office opened and Pansy sauntered in, her high heels clicking on the wooden floor. Potter jumped back and flushed bright red, looking anywhere but at Draco.
„Not as amazing, no,“ Harry chuckled. „I‘m the only person on the receiving end of those brilliant blowjobs and I won‘t share. Not even with you.“
"Is that so?" Draco quirked an eyebrow. "In that case, I require a hot bath. With a mountain of foam in it. And rose petals. And lots and lots of candles in the bathroom."
"We have to get him out," Harry pressed. "We don't know how many robbers there are, what they are capable of, we don't know what he's up against." His heart was beating frantically in his chest, panic settling in his stomach with every passing minute.
Draco lapped at it, letting his tongue finally taste Harry. It was better than he imagined, salty and slightly bitter, and Draco breathed in hard to inhale as much of Harry's musk as he could. Harry smelled and tasted heavenly. Draco needed more of him. As if reading his mind, Harry pushed his cock gently into the inviting mouth. Draco sucked at the tip enthusiastically, practically feasting on Harry's prick. Harry started slowly fucking into the wet heat of Draco's mouth. Draco hollowed his cheeks and lifted his gaze to watch the pleasure building on Harry's face. His green eyes were trained on Draco's mouth, watching almost reverently the way his prick slipped in and out.
He realized suddenly what was weirding him out. Draco never felt relaxed in a haunted house, he was always vigilant, his honed reflexes ready to take action. The door in front of him stood wide open as if trying to lure them in. Something wasn't right. Draco concentrated. Suddenly he knew what was wrong. He could feel an ominous presence slowly, softly trickling into his mind, coaxing him forward. He almost hadn't noticed it was there, gently lapping at the edges of his mind, trying to caress him into a false sense of safety.
Draco calmed his breathing. He had two options. Wait for back-up as the procedure dictated or go inside. He thought about the hostages, he knew that the longer the Aurors delayed, the higher the chance the hostages would be harmed. Draco crossed the Entrance Hall resolutely. Another set of doors lead out and opened into the Main Hall of the Gringott's Bank. Draco could hear muffled voices coming from the other room. The wailing and desperate sobs told him the approximate position of the hostages. Based on the deeper, urgent shouts he presumed there were at least two other robbers. He pressed himself against a wall next to one of the doors leading to the hall. He sneaked a peek around the corner and surveyed his surroundings carefully.
Harry laughed out loud. The laughter turned into a sob and he tried to hold himself still as the shivers started running through his body. He knew Hermione could feel it but mercifully she ignored it and didn't say anything. Harry was grateful to her. He let the tears fall down his cheeks silently and despite his distress, he drifted off to sleep soon.
"I'm not sure, he didn't tell me what he planned to do. He said he was going out with you," Granger's gaze turned worried.
Ron never got a chance to answer as at that precise moment the door opened and Draco sauntered in airily.
"Your confusion doesn't surprise me at all, Potter," Draco drawled. "You've always been a bit thick."
Harry finally opened his eyes and they immediately landed on Draco. They never moved, never wavered. Draco was rooted to the spot, unable to move.
"Don't," Draco chokes down a sob. "Don't say that if you don't mean it." His eyes are suddenly brimming with tears, his whole body hard and unyielding where it was soft and pliant just seconds ago.
Hermione turned around to look at her boyfriend and narrowed her eyes at him, silently forcing him to shut his mouth at least. „Ronald?“
, igniting everything in their path. He coughed as the metallic scent of hot iron reached his lungs. The darkness dispersed almost immediately, replaced with a cloud of heavy, dark smoke billowing in their direction. It obscured their vision almost as effectively as the ghost-darkness had.
Harry felt a stab of guilt in his heart and shame prickled his spine. He realized with a jolt of fear that his friends, his enemies, the public, the Daily Prophet, not even Ginny's false accusations could ever ruin his relationship with Draco. If someone ruined it, it would be him, Harry. "Fuck, Draco, I'm sorry, I'm such a mess," Harry breathed out, his heart feeling heavy in his chest.
The healers disappeared in a rush of shouted instructions. The only evidence they'd been there was a field bed splattered with Draco's blood.
Draco placed his hand on top of Potter's thigh under the table, to keep him quiet without jumping too far ahead in the client's retelling of the events that had driven him to seek out the help of the agency. His heart skipped a beat when he heard Potter's sharp intake of breath.
"That's right, who would want to be alone with boring old Harry," Ron laughed good-heartedly and clapped them both on the shoulder. Given his drunken state, he misjudged his strength and Draco nearly landed face-first in his cider.
"Don't I fucking know that," Harry retorted without malice. Suddenly he flinched and rose up quickly. "It's coming back and it seems angry."
Draco had to agree with him. The last time Creevey had been summoned to a scene, a young girl and three Muggles died. A rogue Death Eater kidnapped the little girl, demanding ransom. Due to his hate for Death Eaters, Creevey didn't handle the situation by the book. He started threatening the Death Eater and escalated the tension even further. The resulting massacre made headlines of all the main newspapers in Britain. He was suspended for six months without pay and this was to be his first task since his return.
"Promise me you'll stay right here. For me," Harry said and gave Draco a quick peck on the lips. Without waiting for an answer, he climbed up.
„Harry,“ Draco said louder. He tried to place his fingers against Harry‘s lips to quiet the downpour of desperation that was leaving Harry‘s mouth.
"Come on, Potty. You're too soft, you'll have to try harder if you really want to bite me," Draco wiggled his eyebrows playfully, pretending he hadn't noticed Potter's intention.
"You shouldn't have to be used to it," Harry scowled. "I hate that people can't seem to pull their heads out of their arses, where the war is concerned."
"Come to think of it, I've never heard you mentioning anyone special in all the years of being an Auror," Smith laughed out loud.
"You smell good, new perfume?" Harry asked. Harry knew for a fact it was the same old one he'd always worn. He could never forget the scent, as it was closely linked to his cock. Every time he smelled it, no matter if it was in the office, during a coffee break, or in the middle of a stake-out, it made his prick thicken.
„I have to get you up, baby. I will Apparate us to St Mungo‘s but your Floo is locked and I can‘t get through the wards,“ Harry‘s cheeks were wet with tears, his eyes blurry and he couldn‘t see much. This was all his fault. He wanted to smash his head against the nearest hard surface but he had to stay strong. Draco needed him and he had to help him. „I have to carry you outside to be able to Apparate. I am so sorry, Draco. Please hold on, I promise it will be over soon, you just have to hold on a bit longer, OK?“
Pansy was a bit surprised Draco was back from the case so soon but she was too preoccupied with her silent rant about paranoid blonds to really worry about it. Barefoot, she crossed the living room into the corridor and opened the door vigorously, one hand placed on her hip to make her irritation visible at first glance.
Harry had to fight an urge to roll his eyes and hide an affectionate smile that threatened to curl his lips. He had to admit Draco looked debauched. Harry's cock approved of the view as well, it was half-hard already, just from the few seconds of staring at the long lean body sprawled before him.
"You and Malfoy, take the left, Smith and Nott will be on your right. You are to sneak in under Disillusionment Charm and evaluate the situation. The robbers are holding hostages, we don't know how many. Do not engage unless it is absolutely necessary. We are waiting for the negotiator to arrive, he should be here any minute."
A picture frame Draco didn't remember putting there, was propped on his desk. He lifted it up and examined it carefully. He and Harry were standing on a beach someplace Draco didn't recognize. He had to admire how beautiful Harry was in the picture. His hair messed up by an unseen wind, his face lit up with happiness, his eyes twinkling delightedly with a mischievous spark. Picture-Harry ran his hand through picture-Draco's hair, presumably to ruin his carefully styled haircut even more than the wind had already managed. Draco's breath hitched when he noticed his own expression in the photograph. He seemed grumpy on the outside but Draco could only marvel at the silent contentedness that seemed to radiate from him. How could he not remember?
„Mate, good to see you,“ Ron clapped him on the shoulder, simultaneously pushing a bottle of wine into Harry‘s hand.
"Draco fled to his flat and I realized only then he'd looked sick and not like… not like he'd shagged someone," Harry closed his eyes and let out a deep breath. "I went after him only to find him crumpled on the floor in front of the fireplace, unconscious."
Draco stared at their joined hands incredulously. He allowed himself a second to enjoy the warmth of Potter's skin against his. There weren't many opportunities like these and he meant to savour every single one of them.
"You're such an idiot," Harry laughed out loud, suddenly feeling giddy, overwhelmed with such happiness he wanted to start jumping around the room. Draco liked him!
Draco thought about it. He had been convinced that Potter wouldn't want Draco to attend the party but now that he was almost begging, how could Draco refuse?
Harry only nodded. The sky was being spliced with lightning every few seconds. Draco knew the flashes of light were going to make their job more difficult, tampering with their night vision.
"Anyway, you were right about the Sources," Harry smiled at her gently. He could see Hermione's expression transforming immediately. Gone was the sadness and anger, replaced with excitement and hope. He would try hard to keep the hope lighting up her face. He repeated what Malfoy had explained to him earlier.
„Breathe, Potter,“ he told himself. The voice in his head sounding like Draco‘s. The voice his mind used now as a default to get through uncomfortable situations. It startled him. Harry tried to count to three while inhaling, counted to five on exhale. When his breathing steadied, he got up and Apparated home.
"Other than seeing the ghost once, as you mentioned, have you or your wife observed any other," Draco paused, searching for the right words. "Unnatural occurrences lately?"
Some of the tightness seemed to leave Malfoy's body and his face relaxed slightly. He looked handsome again, his sharp cheekbones appeared less threatening, less savage, and more statuesque.
Draco lifted his hand up to silence everyone. He crossed the room and kissed Harry gently on the lips, sighing as their lips met in a soft caress. He placed his arms around Harry's shoulders and snuggled his face into the crook of Harry's neck.
Harry grinned and the corners of his mouth twitched mischievously. "Play," his hand traveled down Draco's side.
Harry's body reacts without his permission, his arms wrap around Draco - because suddenly, it's Draco, not Malfoy, in his arms. Harry lets his hand sneak into the soft platinum-blonde hair as he brings their lips together in a bruising kiss. Draco is stiff for a second, then his body responds, his hands grab at Harry's waist, pulling him closer. Draco tastes sweet, better than Harry ever dared to dream and he can't get enough of it. He explores every nook of Draco's mouth, their tongues twisting, lapping, ravaging each other as the long denied want explodes through their bodies.
"Mr. Malfoy, do you have any idea who could be behind these attacks on your person?" Robards asked directly. "Have you been involved in any dealings or transactions that might have caused you to become a target?"
"I expected you to behave like a grown-up," Hermione looked at him angrily. "You know what's at stake, you know why this is important."
"That's not…," Potter stuttered, clearly flustered. "Look, Malfoy, we all have our issues. You said there was never anyone special who would want you because of your past. Well, surprise! Everyone I ever slept with wanted me just because I'm the bloody Saviour. Even Ginny dated me because I was fucking Harry Potter. You never had sex because no one sees the person you are underneath that tattoo. Well, I sleep around because no one sees me for who I am either."
"Why are you doing this the Muggle way?" Harry whispered, fumbling for any distraction from Malfoy's breath caressing his cheek.
"Don't you fucking die, you wanker," Harry yelled at him as he ran down the white steps, far enough from the wards restricting his ability to Apparate.
"Oh God, Harry! I want you so much," Draco babbled. He was out of his mind as Harry's finger kept pushing inside him and pulling out again. The speed changed, one moment hard and fast, the next barely moving at all. Harry brushed Draco's prostate with every drag of his fingers and Draco could only gasp and squirm on the bed. He could barely take in his surroundings, there was only the feel of Harry's finger inside him and the tongue that was now circling his rim, accompanying the finger. There was only pleasure and the sounds they both made, their sighs and groans, the meowl Draco knew must have made, the whimpering and cursing. And then he came. The orgasm raged through him, he could barely breathe, he was drowning. Draco let his legs fall shakily on each side of Harry's beautiful body.
Harry hadn't slept much last night, he had no idea how to convince Draco his feelings for him were genuine. Hell, he had no idea how to tell Draco he even had feelings for him. In the end, Harry decided he would try to be a friend to Draco first, and maybe Draco would start trusting him. Harry also decided he would stop being such a slut. He would stop having sex with random blokes and wait for Draco, hoping one day, Draco would allow him to hold him in his arms.
Malfoy finished wiping Harry's face clean. "I would have loved to see that. We're starting with your training on Monday. Be here at eight sharp."
When the door closed behind Harry, Draco fell into his chair wearily. He didn't sleep well last night. He was tossing and turning for hours, and even the warmth and feel of Harry's body next to him couldn't lull him to sleep. He would never admit it out loud, but he was scared. He didn't want to get hurt again. He could still feel the remnants of the pain assaulting his senses, he could almost taste the way his whole body had felt as if it was on fire. The stretch and pull of his muscles had been almost unbearable. He didn't want to go through that again but it was the best plan they'd come up with on such short notice. One Crucio and that was it. The only thing that kept him going and not chickening out, was the reward that awaited him at the end. Harry.
"Like actually working," Malfoy replied indignantly. "Some of us don't have the luxury of tottering about, killing Dark Lords by accident. Some of us have to work hard to earn enough respect to keep our business floating."
Ron was pinching his arm repeatedly and mumbling to himself. „I‘m dreaming. This is a dream. I just need to wake up...“ He was so startled that he unconsciously let Blaise lead him away from the group.
„Doesn‘t matter, turn around,“ Harry ordered him, palming his painfully hard prick, giving it a few strokes. „Fuck, I don‘t have lube on me.“
Draco considered getting hurt more often if the result was waking up to this. Then he remembered the searing pain and panic of not being able to breathe as his lungs had filled with blood and disregarded the notion immediately. It sounded pathetic even to his own ears.
Harry felt Draco‘s hands tearing at his jeans, fiddling with the button and zipper. He quickly rid himself of the impeding T-Shirt he was wearing, throwing it on the floor where it joined Draco‘s sweater.
"Oh," Harry startled as if he hadn't even considered the possibility of such reply. He crossed the room slowly and stopped inches apart from Draco. Draco took in the way Harry's eyes widened even more, the bewilderment and a flicker of hope shining in them. His breath hitched when Harry's gaze flicked between Draco's eyes and lips uncertainly. The way Harry's chest heaved as he panted heavily, the way he held his hands pressed tightly against his sides as if stopping himself from reaching out and touching Draco.
—No, he is here freaking out, Blaise and Neville are with him, and they are acting really weird, I didn’t know what to do
—Fuck no, she hasn’t been at Grimmauld, I doubt my mom knows even, I bet she is going to flip when she finds out she kidnapped Harry... — he paused for a second thinking —. I’m totally telling her — he said taking his phone out to start typing.
—Well it makes sense, I mean they are still very young but it is the best prospect on both sides, there aren’t any female snakes in their generation
—Use it every time you feel cold, doesn’t matter if you are in-doors — he frowned, annoyed at Tom —. Don’t give me that look, is better if people think you are coming down with the flue, we don´t want to repeat the pool incident
Narcissa got out of the car and hurried her feet on the steps to enter the house. There, close to the hallway was Draco fidgeting with his phone.
—Well isn’t that just disrespectful, now that he is having a new baby, he just gives him back— his uncle said while he kept on eating, as if this was not an upsetting thing at all.
—I meant more like family matters, anything about Bellatrix or our little snake cousin. He is being pressured by that coven so is better like this, he can´t tell what he doesn’t know
—Of course is about Neville, I assume they are finally accepting that him and Theo can´t stand each other
Draco pursed his lips, troubled, but understanding Regulus stance on the subject. After all, he had to find out he was being transferred back through the principal. And his parents response when asked was, “ you shall continue your education at Hogwarts or not at all”
The burrow, just as the family financial situation, had seen better times, and now it seemed set on reflecting the difficult current situation, probably on hand of his mother just don´t having any time to care for it recently.
—They say plenty, although I don’t always understand, like…just the other day they were talking about the Black´s inheritance.
—Me too, that’s why I told her I was dating, I didn´t know she would get so weird about it, she is not even here half the time, but now she suddenly cares…—he finished sarcastically.
He looked around Hogwarts´s entrance and saw how most students were already leaving the school grounds, it was 30 minutes pass two and Tom should be here.
—Yes, a year in a comfortable house, elite school and complete freedom, what a terrible punishment— Tom said more sternily this time.
—Not at all — Regulus answered nonchalantly —. Nothing is ever enough to Walburga Black, so I shall oppose her with everything I have.
—I think I would have liked a little brother—Neville commented. Crouching down to touch some of the baby´s toys.
Tom was tall, and cool, and so much like an older brother. He would bring him presents and seat with him, talk with him, and in those moment, he didn’t feel like the snake anymore, trapped in the cage.
They had thought at first that it was just another one of his brothers’ messes, and maybe they had gotten too used to it, but the thing is nobody expected the issue to escalate this much. Just two teenage boys drunkenly entering an abandoned theater, the police found them, they paid for the few broken windows, done deal…right? Not this time around.
He opened his mouth ready to give a piece of his mind when he felt someone coming at him from the side. He instinctively started to raise his arm to stop them, but he was quick enough to realize it was just Lavender.
Draco winced as Potter bites down on his lower lip before those delectable lips disappeared as he was carried away from the wall. Draco felt the air rush out of his lungs as he tossed violently onto the bed. Before he knew it, something heavy went over him and hungry lips went over his again for another overwhelming kiss, his legs immediately moving to wrap around his waist. Impatient hands caressed his sides, overwhelming Draco with the sensations as his own hands tangled themselves in Potter's black locks. Before he knew it, his pajama pants disappeared with a snap of fingers just as those lips left his once again to attach to his neck, freeing his aching cock as frantic teeth, and lips quickly working on marring his smooth skin. Draco moaned as those rough hands touched all over his body, making him more impatient for the next step his dreams had so deprived him off on countless nights.
The blonde wasn't paying attention as Harry Potter walked out of the library and silently closed the door, looking sharp and clean looking as ever as if the sexual encounter in the library never occurred as he walked towards the blonde male. "My my Malfoy. I never took you for a peeping Tom." Draco refused to let his cheeks react as he gritted his teeth. He turned around to look at the smirking male. "Listen,
Draco thought as he was getting close to the door of the library, noticing that was completely wide open as muffle noises appeared to be coming from there.
"That's it, Draco, let me see this beautiful body writhe from my hands," Potter mumbled lustfully with praise against his skin as he kept moving his fingers to hit that same spot., causing Draco squirm from the growing pleasure. "P-Please I need you...inside of me..." Draco whined out breathlessly, feeling so desperate to feel that aching cock he has always dreamed of. Potter complied and pulled out his coated fingers, making Draco whine at the temporary loss before he watched with half-lidded lust filled eyes as the other took off his pants to display his equally hard cock. Draco quickly grabbed Potter by the back of the neck and slammed their lips together, making Potter groan as their lips clashed once again, his arms went around his neck as the brunette propping Draco's legs onto his shoulder before position his hard cock and pushing in all the way in one go.
His body writhed slightly as those nimble hands slowly stroked his aching cock, static electricity coursing through his body. This bastard better not stop. Suddenly, a soft hissing could be heard coming from down the corridor.
"Are you sure you want people to see that, Malfoy? Perhaps I can help you with that." Draco's eyes widened for a second as he quickly turned around to face the other male, noticing the same annoying smirk on that annoyingly handsome face. "What the fuck are you playing at, Potter? Are you brain dead or something? I told you I don't like being made fun of." Draco snarled, his hands balled up into fists as if he was getting ready for an attack. Harry found all of this pretty amusing, a deep chuckle left his lips as he made a step towards the blonde, who also took a step back. "Yes, I remember you saying that. I'm not playing any games, Malfoy. If I start something, I must be the one to finish it." He said, making more steps towards the blonde, who in turn took the same amount of steps back until his back was pressed against the wall
"I'm flattered that you have noticed, Draco." Harry practically purred as he started moving away from that spot, walking towards the blonde male. Draco scowled, noticing the way the lights from the lit torches cast strange shadows on Harry's face as he walked passed them, giving his handsome features a more dark feel then they already were. "That wasn't a compliment,
came back to me, my celestial dragon." Potter purred into his ear. "And I always say the same thing everytime we finish. 'I love you, my Draco.'"
Potter had a wicked smirk on his face as he held Draco's gaze while leaned up towards Daphne's ear and started hissing in her ear in Parseltongue. The blonde female's body suddenly bucked in pleasure as she cried out, her back arched as her body visibly shuddered. "O-Oh Harry!" Oh hell. Why the hell did the bastard had to start hissing? Draco had to find out the hard way that he was especially turned on when Potter started speaking in Parseltongue. At first, he wouldn't admit it when his body started reacting whenever Potter spoke in Parseltongue to the Dark Lord during the Death Eater meetings but when he started having them in his dreams... let's just say his dream-self always cums rather quickly.
spell, huh?" Draco growled. "I didn't need your help!" The blonde yelled, not caring that others could possibly hear him from the other side of the door. Potter's face was expressionless but his eyes had something else hidden behind those captivating emerald irises. Draco winced as Potter's hands grabbed his wrists and squeezed them so hard, he was forced to let go of the brunette's collar. Before Draco could react, a hand at his jaw and yanked him close so their bodies were inches from each other.
Potter." He snarled, trying to sound vicious as he moved away from the wall. Before Draco could even react, a hand grabbed onto his arm and was roughly shoved back against the wall, his arms pinned against the wall as he felt the air rush out of his lungs. "What the fuck, Potter! Get your hands off of me!" A deep chuckle greeted his ears, causing him to shiver at the sound he could practically feel with their chests pressed together. Merlin, does he look so fucking good. No, it must be the intoxicating musky cologne influencing his mind. Yes, that must be it. "Don't act all coy now, Malfoy. I know you enjoyed it." Before the blonde could say anything, he was roughly turned around, his back pressed against the hard muscular body and his arms pinned against his side by equally strong arms wrapped around him.
Instead of being mad, like Draco expected him to be, Potter smirked, a hidden amusement in his eyes when he noticed the blonde was turned on by what they were doing. Draco gulped nervously, suddenly not liking the way those green eyes seemed to dare him to keep watching to the end. He wanted to turn around to leave this area, to forget what he saw but his body seemed to rebel against him. Potter seemed to find it amusing to see him struggle behind that cobalt eyes as he moved one of his hand that was on Daphne's mid back to grab onto the soft long blonde locks. Daphne let out a sinful cry as her head got yanked back, a thin layer of sweat already formed on her skin, seemingly still not noticing that Draco was standing there.
to notice what you two are doing when you are practically fucking in the open." He sneered, trying his best to put his 'Malfoy' face. "Now if you will excuse me, I
Draco cries got louder and louder, masking Potter's moans as the blonde's nails started digging into his back, eventually breaking through the skin. "Fuck!" The blonde yelled out in the thrawls of pleasure. The grip around his thighs was so tight, he was sure there was going to be bruised in the morning. Harry suddenly pulled out from the blonde, causing Draco to gasp at the emptiness and before he could snap at the other, he was suddenly flipped onto his stomach and felt Potter slam back into him. Draco let another cry as the other filled up the void once again. The bed creaked from his violent thrusts as the blonde whispered encouraging words for him to go faster, his pale fingers gripped the satin sheets tightly.
Tom didn’t answer immediately, but Harry could hear him taking a deep breath as he regarded him. For a moment Harry thought he was going to hit him, Tom had never hit him, but the nstinct of feeling like prey was hard to forget.
—How so?— he asked, already annoyed with him —. It was the name of Tom´s uncle, and like that we would both have names with M, Bellatrix would like for it to be a tradition
He was startled out of his thoughts by Remus throwing the packed bills on the table, the noise resonated on the empty store.
—Oh…! Of course, the Lord— she laughed—. He will be down soon; he usually just has coffee but now that there is you — she said before walking out.
—But — Tom continued, giving him a look for interrupting —. Your registration in an educational facility is among the conditions for being released into my custody.
Harry bit his tongue obfuscated. They had conversations like this many times before, with Tom demanding while giving minimal information, and it was pissing him off.
The door was opened so Tom could see Harry from outside. Sitting on the floor with His back turned towards the door, he seemed at ease with contemplating nothing.
—Yes, I’m already set, rich future boyfriend selected, I was just being considerate of the wording for you
—Can´t he help you stay in Norway then? — Sirius was years from taking over the family, but surely as the heir he could exert some influence.
—Thank you Ms Malfoy, but I was hoping once Bellatrix is better maybe I can go back home…maybe visit her at the hospital.
—No need for that, I´m not judging, you just don´t seem like the type — Harry shrugged not really in the mood of making conversation, he was nervous as fuck and Frank was running late.
—We have the beginning of the year party coming up so they are probably going to be messaging like crazy, but is not always like that, I promise
—How can you say that when you know what I went through? I was sick, my instincts were out of control
—…I’m just over it…and to be honest I was over it at the end of last year already. We had these problems at home, and she wouldn’t stop bugging me, like, I didn´t have time for her and she got on my nerves
There was some door slamming and then the only thing he could hear were muffled voices. He closed the entrance door and stood there trying to see if he could listen more, worried.
This will be the last chapter to be a flashback, from next chapter we will be on the present and moving forward
Tom took long steps as he walked through the hallways. The maid running beside him barely keeping up.
It was probably taking some effort, since he had managed to somehow “miss” all the flights his parents had scheduled for him to get back to England.
—You want my solutions, that the only reason you keep coming to therapy, so you can get answers out of me
—Really? — Regulus thought about it for a second —. That’s a lot, what are they asking for in return?
To everybody else this event wouldn’t seem strange at all, but to her, knowing what she did it, was beyond bizarre, what was Tom´s move in playing along with the Notts? Milo and Neville as a match were not exactly unviable but it was not a smart move to pair the only two reptile omegas together.
—There is something going on with the snakes, I mean they have always kept tabs on Tom and Harry but …this is something else
That last morning, the day he left, he got out of the Dursley´s house with the intention to just go across the street, there the elderly would be waiting for him, he just had to walk up to her door and knock, easy right?
—Milo…—he started exasperated —. Having one son is a lot of work and you are making it worst by the minute subjecting me to his conversation… I thought I wasn’t capable of having children so you will have to excuse me if I do not have this baby yet in my calendar, surely it can wait for his time until he is born
—Milo…—he started exasperated —. Having one son is a lot of work and you are making it worst by the minute subjecting me to his conversation… I thought I wasn’t capable of having children so you will have to excuse me if I do not have this baby yet in my calendar, surely it can wait for his time until he is born
—Ohhh that — he said remembering —. I don´t know, things aren´t good between me and Tom so I don´t really want to ask him for anything, and he is set on picking me up every day so I figure going to a party will be less than a maybe
—Ok darling, sorry for the wait — came Madame Malkin’s out of the back room carrying a bunch of packages that she lay over the counter—. So… is four pants with the fixed hem, just as we measured…let’s see… the sweaters… — she kept checking if everything was there —. Tie, socks, all set for the school year
—Yes of course—she corrected herself—. I guess you are right — she said laughing lightly, pretending to be silly.
—She didn’t kidnap me — Harry tried to appease, finding the wording much too severe for what happened.
—What did you do? — Were her first words. A if he was at fault of something terrible, just by subjecting them to his early presence.
—Mister Gaunt, normally i would be perfectly at ease with this progress but, as I’m sure you are aware, your father asked for my help specially with your case, he is determined that you should do well in this school
—We think we found Harry…a teenager his age is in a hospital in Glasgow, he was identified as a snake.They refused to send picture of an underage boy to unrelated people, it didn’t help that Riddle´s doesn’t share his name so, I’m flying there tomorrow to see him myself, bringing the papers and everything.
—Well then, take this as an opportunity to know each other better, It could do no harm, you ought to be family after all—Harry pressed his lips in a line. Right…Tom was getting married soon.
—I’m sorry honey, is that one of your friends? — the woman inquired him sweetly. Harry was so dumfounded by the question that he was not able to answer right away.
—I would feel so lost, all on my own, this baby is very lucky, he will have Milo to teach him—she said sweetly.
—I doesn’t matter, he is dating now, first love and all that — he said, almost rolling his eyes in annoyance.
—I wasn’t with them when I left…— he admitted  —. I ran from my uncle´s house, so unless you plan on sending me there again, I don’t see any danger
When he got to the tent people sheered. Lucius Malfoy already had a microphone in hand and Draco thought everything was just too much, but as his parents said, It was an important birthday supposedly, deserving of a big celebration. So he put on a smile and tried to feel anything but numb.
—we should have gotten together before, to get the story straight— Regulus muttered, arms crossed —. I could at least greet him properly… can you believe them? Telling us last minute
Harry leaned over the kitchen island while  Ron kept mixing whatever drink he thought he was inventing. Screams could be heard already coming from the living room, as those who had arrived earlier  were already tipsy, and with Blaise’s mom out of town there was nothing to worry about.
—Lets just not make rushed decisions — he said grabbing him by the shoulders —. We´ll go to buy new gear this week, what do you think?
Harry started picking up his things so he could leave the class, keeping his eyes on Draco. He had been wondering about Bellatrix after yesterday´s shit show and Tom´s answers when questioned had proven most unsatisfactory. It hadn’t taken much thought to know he had to ask the eavesdropping cousin of the family.
—I will put all of this into bags — Madame Malkin continued, addressing them both —. And Darling, over there are the scarves, hat, gloves etc, take your pick and I’ll be back in a few minutes— she said before walking out, leaving them standing awkwardly.
He turned the phone around on his hands, thinking of what to do. He really didn’t want to speak to Tom so soon, and he had been making a statement on their last interactions, no answering his calls and only responding in short sentences to his questions via text. Tom had called this behavior a tantrum but Harry hope to get his point across, he was beyond upset at the current situation.
Harry raised his eyebrows and blinked a few times, trying to understand if he had just been insulted.
—Yes— she said signing —. It means you really believed your son was alright, and it was only one isolated event that triggered him… so now that he is saying he wasn’t in fact alright, how does that make you feel?
—Ignore them — Tom told him in a way that seemed light, but Harry knew it was the end of that conversation—. Eat the meat at least, the doctor said it would help.
—Jesus Pansy, I think you are drunk already— Blaise decided to interrupt coming into the room. He walked until he was besides him and Ron-
—Ok guys, the assembly is about to start so I will have to cut the live here, bye — she hurriedly ended the transmission and sent Blaize a death glare.
Harry grinned, Draco definitely sounded jealous. "There is one I know of," Harry tried for a seductive purr. He crossed the room and perched himself on the corner of Draco's desk. Draco's gaze slid to Harry's crotch and it made Harry feel giddy and a little bit hard.
There was a sudden, uncomfortable silence after that, all of the good mood evaporating in an instant.
Harry wiggled his hips again, pressing his erection more tightly against Draco's back. "I want to suck your cock, I want to thrust my tongue deep in your arse, I want to push my prick inside you so slowly you will choke for it. God Draco, I want all of it. I want all of you, always, forever."
"Of course," Granger nodded. "I sort of expected it. However, I wanted to tell you first how much I appreciate that you agreed to take Harry with you on a case. It's really good of you to put the old grudge behind you."
"Let's do it then," Draco sighed. This was the only chance he would ever get at having Potter the way he'd always dreamed of. "But no kissing."
"What about the old ghosts?" Potter asked all of a sudden. "You know what I mean. Bloody Baron, Nearly Headless Nick, Peeves. What happened to them?"
Harry had turned the food on his plate into mush while narrating his part of the story. He pushed his plate away, disgusted with himself, unable to swallow anything as a wave of nausea rolled in his stomach.
Draco was sitting on a chair in front of an old teacher‘s desk. Harry was perched on top of him, stradling him, his arms wrapped around Draco‘s shoulders. Harry‘s prick was hidden between their very naked bodies.
Harry hung the wet towel across a back of a chair and grabbed a spare blanket from the wardrobe. He didn't want to risk waking Draco up by trying to drag the bedsheet from underneath him. Harry gently lay beside Draco and curled into his side. Draco sighed contentedly in his sleep. Harry tucked them both in and drifted off to sleep.
Harry was sure he didn't imagine Malfoy's deep growl. It sent another wave of blood in a rush into his cock. Harry fought the urge to touch himself right then. He wiggled in his seat, hoping the movement would alleviate the tightness in his trousers but somehow made everything even worse. Harry contemplated straddling Malfoy's lap and thrusting against his groin until they both came in their pants. The idea was preposterous and yet strangely alluring.
"Sure," Harry nodded and smirked at him in return. Based on Pansy's quips, Malfoy was attracted to Harry too. Harry decided he wouldn't hide what he wanted anymore. He longed to wipe the smirk off of Malfoy's face with his tongue and he let it show in his eyes.
"What makes you think I made this specifically for you?" Malfoy scoffed. "It's the standard edition of our Ghost Hunter's Guide."
„Not as amazing as Harry does, I hope,“ Ron came into view. He was holding a Cornish pastie in one hand and a glass of pumpkin juice in the other.
Draco opened his equipment bag and started taking out various vials and containers, iron chains, and twigs of lavender. He arranged everything on top of his desk and glanced at Potter, who was perched on the edge of the desk, rummaging through the spread-out gear.
"Of course I didn't tell you. Would you have gone if I told you the best ghost-hunting agency was owned by none other than Draco Malfoy?" Hermione looked at him, her eyes boring into Harry's soul.
„Mr. Malfoy, I'm doctor Hayhurst and I will be your primary doctor during your stay here. Are you OK with Mr. Potter hearing your diagnosis or would you prefer him to wait outside?“ the medi-wizard asked formally.
„Thank you. I will leave you alone with Draco for a bit and then I‘ll come back,“ Harry replied with a sigh.
Potter shivered, his knees buckling, his whole body trembling under Draco's. Draco reached around Potter's hips and grabbed his prick. He started thrusting inside Potter; once, twice, three times, while jerking Potter off at the same time.
Harry groaned and buried his face in his palms in frustration. Why did Draco always have to take Harry's teasing the wrong way? Harry wanted to take Draco's hand in his and never let go. Now that Draco almost died in his arms, Harry never wanted to part from Draco, he wanted to keep him safe every bloody minute of every bloody day. Draco didn't seem to share Harry's sentiment.
I was never loved as a child. I was treated worse than a house-elf. I grew up being hated, being shown every day how worthless I was. I was told constantly that I deserved to be punished, that I was a freak who was not worthy of being loved. That's why every single relationship I've ever had was so dear to me. I lost too many people in the war and it affected me deeply, it messed me up even more than I already was.
"I love you too," Harry beamed at him. He ran the tip of his finger across the buttons of Draco's shirt and bit his lip seductively. "In that case, I think you're wearing too many clothes."
Ginny immediately pressed herself against Harry who stood there dumbstruck for a few seconds before he pried her off of him.
"I don't want to get wasted," Draco protested and cradled the bottle of cider against his chest protectively, out of Ron's reach. The more he drank, the more he liked it. Another reason was, that Harry had ordered it for him and he didn't want to hurt his feelings by not finishing it. He didn't say that out loud, however.
Draco nodded at Harry and slowly opened the last remaining door. As he stepped over the threshold, he felt the change in the temperature immediately. The wind had picked up outside and a particularly violent gust rattled the window, making Harry gasp. The air inside the room smelled of dust and old people, stale and sickly sweet, with an acrid note to it. Draco sniffed and scrunched his nose as he fought the urge to sneeze.
Draco unslung the bag from his shoulders and switched the rapier to his left hand. He wasn't proficient in fighting left-handed but he needed to locate the salt bombs in his bag fast. He blindly groped around his bag, eyes trained on the apparition before of him. It seemed to be retreating, the silver proving too much for it. Finally, he located a familiar shape inside his bag, the weight of it a welcome reassurance in his palm. He threw the salt bomb at the Raw-bones. Its wail echoed through the house as it burst into nothingness. It would be back soon but the reprieve was instant. Draco put the rapier back in its place at his belt and pulled out two more salt bombs. He kicked Pansy in the shin, she clearly deserved it, and snickered when she yelped.
"You don't have to lounge there, munching on a sandwich while watching me get tortured, you twat," Draco chuckled but Harry could tell he was feeling uneasy. "You have to let them cast one spell. A single spell and then you can start your magnificent rescue. No one said you had to watch me writhe in pain for hours."
"Pansy," Draco repeated forcefully. When she didn't even bat an eyelash in his direction, he crumpled the note he'd written to Potter in his fist and threw it at her. To his utter delight, it hit her straight in the face.
Draco gaped at him incredulously. "Oh my God, Potter, you truly are thick. I've always thought playing stupid must have been part of your strategy but you really are bloody thick. Let me spell it out for you, you lamebrain twat. We can't use magic. How are you going to see in a dark cellar, if you can't cast Lumos?"
Harry knew deep down he should have listened to Robards and evacuate the mansion. He'd promised Hermione, he would come back to her tonight. She needed him, now more than ever, with the baby due in two months. Ron wasn't there and Harry was her best friend, he promised her he would help her take care of the baby. Harry shook his head. He would do everything in his power to come back to Hermione but he wouldn't leave his colleagues to die either.
Harry wakes up in what looks like a black-and-white version of the King's Cross Station. He has a choice to make. Harry knows what to do. What greater reason is there to live than love?
—You know it wasn’t an accident — she said, her tone clipped. And she voiced it as a statement, it took him a little bit to understand he was supposed to respond.
—Why would he?  If he wasn’t planning to keep him—Harry told himself that was not true, that beast law was different…it still hurt—. Boy! You look scrawny, don´t they feed you in that house? Isn’t that guy rich? — What he  thought was rich was his uncle asking this, when
—Is fine…—he answered plainly. Sirius should had call him if he was planning to just drop his son and leave —. How long has he been there?
—What do you mean? — he asked playing dumb, in the way he had seen his mother do so often—. I thought he was doing good in Durmstrang
Harry was so dumfounded by the observation that he bursted out laughing. It had been ages since this had come up.
—Karkaroff— he greeted back, in a much more serious manner—. Well yes, I wanted him to enjoy his summer as much as he could, but Hogwarts start the 1
—I´ll take it from here — The maid looked at him startled for a second before nodding a short curtsy.
—My mom just came in and is making faces at me…she is scolding me now…mom I don´t understand — he heard Draco´s voice like it was from afar now —. Would you rather I give the phone? — he heard some squabble going on the other side before Ms Malfoy´s voice came through
His usual self would be able to give better answers, maybe try and think of a way to get out of this mess, but he could recognized that it was over,  and maybe it was right about time, he was too tired to keep fighting…and honestly at the moment, a tiny bit sedated.
Bellatrix had no taken well on the news of him and Tom going on vacation this summer, and honestly…he kind of understood, by then she would be 7 months pregnant and unable to join…Not that Tom had invited her either.
Harry didn´t recognized him so thought he probably was one of the transferred students he had heard about.
— She rolled her eyes at him for that but smiled—. …I´m Harry by the way— he quickly shook his head at realizing what he said —. I mean, Milo, I’m Milo
—I did study for this test —he defended sounding defeated, it wasn’t as if he didn´t put any effort.
—Well you heard him, he doesn’t want to be on camera, but this shoulder you guys see on the screen is him beside me, I hope that’s enough
—Really? —he faked confusion—. …maybe we have some misunderstanding here, Harry has always been supposed to finish his education at Hogwarts
Tom didn’t say anything for a while, letting the uncomfortable silence stretch on the office. On the side Harry saw the assistant stir in his spot.
Draco was hiding outside, leaning agaisnt a wall. The big white tent holding the party was shining with life in the distance, but he didn’t want to look at it. So he kept his eyes on the floor, and as the music kept playing, muffling the voices of people cheering, he felt like it was happening to somebody else.
—Is he mad? I mean…I don´t know the details but he has some responsibility in you leaving, right ? You shouldn’t have to walk on eggshell — Draco asked frowning.
—Since he arrived, he seems very upset and would not take any offer of food nor suggestions to go anywhere else, we weren´t sure if he just needed space or if something was wrong…
—Well of course if you have only one son you would make him your heir, is completely different if you were to have options— Bellatrix refuted stubbornly.
While he was saying this a maid entered the room to leave a basket with bread in front of them. There was an uncomfortable silence while they waited to be left alone again.
Narcissa Hummed noncommittedly and kept her opinion on the matter to herself. Being an alpha these days was rather overrated. In the past there were assumptions that alpha children inherited more power from their beast presentation, it had proven to be false back in the 90´s, still there was a lot of pride linked to having an alpha, sadly Lucius was among the people that wanted to feel that kind of pride.
It was a shit show, every summer, with him not saying he didn’t want to go and his relatives trying to look good, and not at all like they were relieved to have gotten rid of him. At least, since he had been recognized as a Gaunt, the treatment he got there wasn’t so bad anymore, they probably feared being sued.
—Bella had it painted again, She wanted green, but it turned out too dark — he said searching for a place to put his gift.
Meanwhile his relatives were dying to get rid of him. Harry liked to pretend he couldn’t listen to everything that was being said about him, but his relatives were far from subtle.
—Why? Does she have something to say to me? — he said, taunting. Bellatrix had said some upsetting things to him in the past…truths. He figured that must be the reason Tom was fussing.
—Yes, that of course, but… he is an omega, and He is Milo´s age,  very promising, right?— she said Brightly.
Harry faltered a little at that, They had just found out Neville was an omega, the only one in their grade beside Blaise… as far as anyone else knew.
—…you add the opposite of the number in both sides, the result is like passing it from one side to the other, because here is cero but over here, hey! —Harry was hit with a pen on the head —. Are you paying attention?
—Oh…that — Lucius said, seemingly having forgot about it—.Well… the least he can do if you ask me, even a Weasley can get passable grades if that’s the case…in anyway, don´t get too involved in all that drama
It was so…schoolly and childish, not at compliment that was exchanged where he was before and definitely not something he would like to be called.
After the call ended Tom let himself fall on his chair and threw his head back in exhaustion. He was tired of entertaining people like Karkaroff, as if they presented any type of authority. They wanted him as a part of their den because he was from an old lineage, the most important one in Europe and the only snake family remaining in England, but that did not stop them from mentioning occasionally, how surprised they were about the power he carried, being a bastard and all.
He thought as he got closer, noticing there were others sound too. Soft moans, sounds of rustling and slightly heavy breathing. Draco grew more curious as he finally made it to the door, the sounds getting louder.
making love? You practically abused your power and forced me to!" Draco hissed before he was suddenly pulled for a crushing kiss and it quickly ended as soon as it started. "Forced? Remember, you were the one who
"Don't tease me you fucker!" Draco growled out from frustration. The blonde heard Potter snicker against his neck. He gasped as two fingers breached his ass, the pain shooting up his body as he groaned, his fingers gripping Potter's hair tightly, the lustful kiss trailing from his neck to his collarbone distracting him somewhat from the pain. Draco quickly moaned he felt Potter started moving his fingers in a scissoring motion, his head tilt back against the pillow as he subconsciously pressed the other more against his body. Those lips left trails of fire down to his chest as the blonde writhed under him in pleasure, moans turned to soft cries as those skillful fingers thrust into that magic spot that made him see stars at the first try, his back arched against the soft bed sheets.
curse but also his body is two hundred pounds of pure muscle on a 6 FT 3 body. The Death Eaters attending the meeting shuddered at the hissing sounds the two were making as well as keeping their head down to avoid making eye contact with Harry.
Draco could hardly suppress the whine just begging to pass through his lips as well as the pleasurable shiver that went through his body every time he heard Potter speak in Parseltongue.
Potter seemed to have found this amusing, another deep chuckle met Draco's ear before a set of teeth nibbled on his earlobe, causing him to shiver again, distracting him from noticing a set of nimble fingers swiftly unbuttoned his pants. "Or were you imagining how my cock will feel in that tight ass of yours?" Ok, that did it. Draco felt his body finally turned into putty in the other's arms, his own hands gently gripped on Potter's forearm as if he was trying to stay on his two feet. Draco let out a gasp as Potter's hand dived into his pants while his other arm wrapped securely around his waist, his back arched against the strong chest as he barely let out a low moan.
Without saying another word, Draco charged forward, grabbing the other's hand and pulled him into the room. The door swung closed with a muffled bang as Draco shoved Potter back into the wall with all his might before he slammed his lips against the other's lips for a rough kiss. Potter immediately kissed the blonde back just as rough, seemingly not thrown off by the blondes action as their position switched, this time the brunette slammed the blonde back against the wall as he made Draco's legs wrap around his waist, hoisting him up against the wall as the blonde wrapped his arms around his neck. Lips and teeth clashed against each other as Potter ground his hips against Draco's, each movement rough with need as Draco groaned against his lips, feeling the other take his breath away.
Harry sat next to his grandfather in the grand chair, his captivating emerald eyes slowly scanned over the attending Death Eaters. He had no love for any of them. They were all just disposable minions to him, ready to just kill off if need be. His eyes stopped on a blond hair male around his age. He was a spitting image of his father, Lucius but more stunning. He had a strong looking physique yet petite looking with smooth alabaster skin. Pale, smooth skin that he would love to run his hands over, mark it and watch it flush red by his doing. His tongue peeked out slightly and licked the corner of his lips.
Draco finally got his body to move like he wanted and bolted out of there, quickly trying to distance himself from the tantalizing hissing as Daphne's cries continued after him. Draco came to a stop when he thought would be a pretty good distance between him and the door which he could still see. The blonde let out a sigh of relief as he turned around so he was facing the wall. He placed both of his hands on the wall, closing his eyes as he willed for his brain to let those sexy images go while trying to get his body to calm his body down so his tent wouldn't be so noticeable under his pants.
Draco heard Potter let out a sigh, his warm breath brushing lightly against his neck, that amazing hand pulling away from his hard cock.
Draco looked like an idiot just standing there with his mouth hanging slightly open but he quickly composed himself to an appearance befitting a Malfoy, a sneer on his face. "I should have known it was you, Potter. You always did have a knack for hiding in the shadows." Harry laughed lowly, causing Draco to shiver at the sound. Why is he making him feel like this?
"Go find where my grandson is, Draco. It appears he has disappeared once again." Lord Voldemort said in a soft voice, causing those in the room to shiver. "Yes, my lord," Draco said, getting up from his bent knee and briskly left the chamber. He couldn't believe he was being assigned as Potter's babysitter.
" Draco said in a scathing voice, keeping an eye on the other as he came to a stop several feet from the blonde. "And for your information, I wasn't
Draco did his best to make himself as imposing as possible to hide the fact he looked like a cornered animal. "I don't need your
He recognized a painting of the founder of the House of Slytherin in Hogwarts, Salazar Slytherin mounted on the wall. That means he was on the west side of the mansion...oh crap. He had stopped in front of
well why I'm here." Potter looked over at the blonde, an eyebrow raised before he snapped his fingers together, suddenly causing his shirt to be already buttoned and tucked nicely around his waist, sighing as he moved to stand in front of his desk. "No, I don't, Malfoy. I don't feel like reading your mind, so I suggest you get on with it."
There was utter silence until there was a sound like someone scoffed. "Very well." Draco's eyes widened as he back up a few steps when the person he was referring to earlier stepped out of the dark corner, a cocky smirk on his face and his emerald eyes shaded with a hint of darkness, portraying his personality. Let's not forget the fact that the first two buttons on his crisp white dress shirt were open, showing glimpses of his defined chest that seemed more muscular from the shadows.
Draco jolted from his sleep covered in sweat and an uncomfortable hard-on. God damn it. This was the tenth time this week that he has woken up just as the dream Potter was about to put his thick cock in his ass. Draco rolled onto his stomach and groaned into his satin covered pillow. The lustful dreams were getting worse since that encounter with the other. It doesn't help that the Dark Lord, Potter, and the Death Eaters in Voldemort's inner circle now lived together in a fortress-like mansion. Why? Who knows what goes on inside his head. No one seemed to mind. Draco let out another groan as he climbed out of his bed. He never seemed to go back to sleep after these kinds of dreams. He trudged out of his room in just his pajama pants into the dark quarters of the mansion.
Harry chuckled, the sound causing his fascination to look over at him from across the table. No one has ever heard the grandson of the Dark Lord laugh.
join us, Harry." Lord Voldemort said in a soft voice, his red eyes looking closely at his grandson. Harry didn't look the slightest bit apologetic as he walked over to the head of the oval-shaped table. "My apologies, Grandfather." Lucius looked towards the door, noticing that his son wasn't coming in. "Where is my son, young Master?" The older blonde inquired towards Harry, who had taken the position in the chair next to Lord Voldemort. Harry smirked, making some at the table uncomfortable, thinking that he did something to the Malfoy heir. "Oh, he had to take care of something. He'll be coming shortly."
"Come in." Draco heard a deep voice call out from inside of the room and opened the door, stepping in to see a house-elf standing on top of an armchair next to a shirtless Potter who was resting against the large maple desk, tending to his arm which was wrapped in bandages. Potter looked over at the blonde, his emerald eyes briefly observed him before a sigh left his lips. "Enough Dobby. Leave." He said in a soft voice. The house elf quickly stopped what it was doing and with a deep bow, the house elf disappeared with a loud crack. "What do you want Malfoy?" Potter drawled as he moved his ass from the desk, walking around to take his crisp white shirt that had been neatly laid on the back of his chair by the house elf and carefully put it on. The blonde couldn't miss the slight wince that handsome face made when the movement caused his injury to twinge in pain.
Draco thought, actually taking time to think rather than roaming around the mansion trying to find someone who has a knack for hiding ever since he was born.
"Damn snake," Draco mumbled out loud, scowling as Potter stepped away from him, immediately missing the extra body heat. The other heard and smirked before turning around to walk to the large form of Nagini. "Our business isn't don't yet, Malfoy. If you're feeling a little...heated, you know where to find me. See you at the meeting. " He said as he slowly disappeared down the corridor with the large snake slithering behind him. All was silent before Draco mumbled a curse as he leaned his back against the wall. What was he going to do with this raging hard-on? He couldn't possibly ask any of the girls to help him since they all were in the Death Eater meeting and he most
A male in his late teens hissed back, his head leaning against his knuckles which was resting on the armrest. The most peculiar part about this young man was his cold emerald eyes. Others wouldn't dare oppose him, not only because his eyes are the same color as the
Draco felt something snap and before he knew it, he shoved Potter against the desk, causing the heavy wood appliance to rattle a little. Potter hissed as a throbbing pain shot up his back before sending the blonde a glare and was about say something when Draco cut him off and grabbed his collar with both hands. "Who told you to jump in front of that
"You know why I can't stand on the side. I thought I made myself pretty clear the last time we made love." Potter said in a low voice as if he only wanted Draco to hear those words. The blonde flushed and grabbed the brunette's arm, trying to get that hand to let go. "You call
The brunette's aloof expression annoyed Draco, his eyebrows knitted together as he tried to control the anger that suddenly wheeling in his body. "Don't give me that, Potter." He said venomously, his fists clenched by his side. "You know
Daphne's erotic moans of Potter's name brought him out of his thoughts, and to his horror, feeling his pants get tighter. Oh Merlin, why did he need to have such reaction at the current moment? Potter hissed when the blonde female yanked at his hair so he pulled away from her neck, leaving several red bite marks on her milky skin. She leaned forward to kiss him but Draco saw Potter moved his head to the side to avoid it, ended up having her lips on his neck. Draco felt his breath get lodged in his throat when those same emerald eyes that haunt his nightmares noticed he was standing in the doorway, frozen like a deer caught in the car headlights.
"Damn bastard." Draco cursed midbreath as he stormed through the empty, poorly lit corridor limestone covered corridors. Who the hell does he think he is? Just because he is the grandson of the Dark Lord, doesn't mean he gets to give orders. Malfoys don't take orders from Harry Potter. "Are you sure about that, Draco? You seem quite eager to follow them just a moment ago." A male voice said from the direction towards a pitch dark corner of the corridor that the flickering lit torches couldn't touch. The voice was unexpected, it caused Draco to nearly jump out of his skin. A deep chuckle could be heard and the blonde quickly composed himself and sneered at the corner. "Reveal yourself. I don't like being made fun of especially by someone who isn't man enough to show me their face."
—She didn´t like him? — Draco asked, and it wasn’t his intention, but it somehow came out mockingly disingenuous.
Harry laid on the bed, cellphone agaisnt his shoulder, listening to Draco going on about how the last day of school had gone. He was not his preferred source of neither information nor entertainment, but Ron… he could never be trusted to answer his messages, let alone a phone call.
—…And what is important? Remind me, I mean besides parading me around as a trophy in Norway— Tom gave him a long look, flashing his red eyes. Harry knew he had crossed a line but stood his ground.
Remus leaned a little over the bag to take a look and Harry saw him moving his nose, as if sensing something. Could he smell it? No…that wasn’t possible
—Is an omega thing — he answered and jumped on his chair when his uncle hit the table with his hand.
—What other things you hear your parents talking about? —Back at the Dursley he used to hear a lot of conversation by accident, he wished he didn’t, as it was always hurtful, since then he learned to keep to himself.
It had been discussed how the whole situation was strange, it felt like too much and now with this hot shot lawyer getting involved, it was adding up.
—Are you serious? — Draco asked frowning, finding the idea a bit absurd—. What do you think he is going to do? snitch on our party habits?
—I guess I was lucky that you never realized you were winning, if this is how you behave when you are on top — she said bitterly seeing his reaction.
—I just don´t want you to get your hopes up, Tom is even taking Milo to Norway this summer, you know is so he can make connections, he wouldn’t introduce him to that community if he was even considering not to make him his heir
—Viktor Krum — Draco answered, and he was about to explain some more when comment from Neville stopped him.
Harry, a small figure sitting on his aunt´s couch felt like in a trial, with a group of adult men asking him question after question, like on the tv shows aunt Petunia liked to watch.
Submerged Deep into his mind he couldn’t hear the steps approaching him. It wasn’t until a pair shoes where in his line of sight that he looked up to find Sirius in front of him.
—And you though you were on the clear? After what you were caught doing — Tom said giving him a pointed stare.
—Yes, I’m going! — he could feel tears getting on his eyes, he wasn’t sure if there were out of anger or just the stress of having this fight, truth was, he would never get this emotional if they were face to face, but now he could not stop.
—Well you should, I rather you worry about that and not about matters that don’t affect you, it distracts you from what is important—
For the next few nights he had trouble falling asleep, and it was as it used to be, before everything, before finding out he was a snake, before Tom. He felt in the cage again, defenseless, alone, numb.
Tom waited for him to be out of earshot before fully adressing Bellatrix. She continued drinking her coffee, pretending everything was fine, he wasn't buying it.
Regulus kept going around his room setting his belongings, using earpods instead of speaker just so his family wouldn’t listen in on his conversation…not all of it at least.
—I’m not taking part in this — Harry annouced. He was ready to bail when he saw someone outside on the terrace —. You invited Neville? — he asked Blaise.
—. I Heard you went to the zoo recently — one said, taking a plate nearby to offer him biscuit. Harry took it perking up.
On that state of mind, he packed his bag to go stay with a neighbor, Arabella Figg, who would take care of him during his relative vacation abroad.
—Is only until you can regulate your own temperature, reptiles are…— Tom started to explain, but Harry had heard this a thousand times before.
Harry was ready throw shade back, but his eyes found Victors and the guy was frowning and looking directly at him.
— …like a picture in my head … whenever I thought of coming back …the life I imagined, he was part of it and now I realize all this time he was gone…
—The twins messed up and got expelled— Ron laughed when saying but it was in a sad tired manner— I mean… it was always going to happen, not this necessarily but something with them, still…there are damages to pay for, we had to go to court…Ginny didn´t want to come today, there’s other things going on, is…whatever
—Shit dude sorry…— he answered, looking apologetic —. We are behind the art building, you know where it is?...where are you?... ok stay there I’m going— he said hanging up —. Victor, I’ll be right back guys
—That’s two years from now and I don´t trust you to not get disowned before that — they both laughed at the idea.
Harry tried to keep listening, but even his sneak hearing could only take him so far. He walked away from the door to sit on his bed.
His mother had told him of this idea, threatening to quit playing futbol and how it supposedly would scare his father enough to cut him some slack, he didn’t know she would run with it though.
The way she said it, with a clear mock of innocence irritated him and Harry found himself wishing Tom would hurry. Couldn’t she just say what she wanted to say?
Tom uncovered his ears and took him by the shoulders, he then lowered his stance until he was almost at eye level with Bellatrix.
—You are a member of the Gaunt family, you had to be named accordingly, do you know just how fortunate you are?
Harry turned around, surprised at hearing an unknown someone butting into their conversation. A boy standing behind them extended his hand and Harry tried to cover how weird out he was.
—Lets find common ground here, I can enroll you in Hogwarts but that does not mean you have to show up to classes, so lets find you an incentive
—Sure, I’m not from London and I had to move here and start at Hogwarts once too , even now is the same all over again, I’ve been away for a while. What year are you in?
—Come on Neville, I’ll show you    —  he said starting to walk out the room. Harry didn’t have much choice but to follow along.
—…like a picture in my head … whenever I thought of coming back …the life I imagined, he was part of it and now I realize all this time he was gone…
—Indefinitely would be ideal, That’s the thing, since the baby is an hybrid between species we can´t be sure about the due date, and the chances of him being premature are very high, it would bring me so much peace if you were in England during that time, It would be awful for you to be overseas when the baby comes
Pansy turned around to see what she was talking about. There on the door was a familiar boy,  she wasn’t quite sure if she recognized him at first but then Blaize was waving at him, confirming her suspicion
—Yes well, you know I’ve been trying to knock some sense into him for a while, the baby is coming and is important for him to be close to his kin, both his father and his…big brother
—Peasant name? Really Malfoy—Malfoy came close, took something from the table and hit him on the head with it.
After hours the shopping mall felt decadent. With no people in it, silent hallways and dim lights, it was such a contrast from the usual lively place. There in the middle of the technology section, Harry was sitting on one of the counters of the closed department store, eyes glued to a flat tv screen, where some kind of gossip show was airing.
—Look amm — She read the file that on her hand, to see what his name was. He tried not to take it personally —. Milo…—
It was strange, hearing Tom speak for the first time in almost two years, he didn’t know what to say.
Harry saw her leaving the room and tried to acomotaed himself better on the bed to wait. It been two year since the last time he saw Tom.
—Sudden interest? What do you mean, they invited me, and I go there all the time, you are always pushing me to be friends with Draco, because you don´t like Ron and-
—I think maybe is time to grow up, and focus on the most important things, so I figured…—he shrugged and hoped his mother was right, because he sure as hell didn’t want to quit for real.
—Is alright, calm down, I’ll go check on them  — she left him to go upstairs, feigning a confidence she didn’t really have but wanted to convey to him.
—I don’t know, maybe is just me—he said shaking his head—.  Anyway be careful with what you say in front of Victor
—Yessss— Regulus said smiling to himself —. And now if she has question, I just can´t answer the phone because I’m at school — he announced.
help with this Milo, sadly for men, and I’m sure you will experience this someday, the baby does not matter until is here, until they are able to see it, before then it seems is like an abstract concept and his needs are of non-importance
—Well…not really, I used to do little runs, like in party clubs you know — He said without looking up —. This big of a pickup is much more stressful, there I sent the text
—How would I know? I assumed so, anyway it doesn’t really matter, you missed the last two weeks of school, we never do anything on those, Snape is the only one who likes to torture us until the end
—…Then why did you have me? — He knew, really, that he was just an accident. A one-night stand that no one thought was viable and had miraculously been born… at the cost of his mother’s life… All that was something he would not dare to bring up —. I can die by catching a mere draft— he said instead.
—Blaise— Pansy crossed her arms —. Do you feel that now because you have a boyfriend you can judge the single and independent?
—Don´t let Snape see you doing that —Draco muttered under his breath. He looked around, most students were already here but still not sight of Milo.
—oh!  Is Narcisa also nearby? — Regulus answered enthusiastically. Draco could not match the mood, his father very rarely engaged in small talk, so he was probably in some kind of trouble.
—Why are there conditions? —Harry started again—.The woman from social services said it was better for me to come here
—Nerves? — Bellatrix said indignantly —. Well, what would you know about nerves— Narcissa bit her tongue and handed her the cup —. Is all just so stressful, he could be the first snake to be born in England… in ages!
—...i don´t know — he looked around frantic and felt it, it was happening again, that thing when he felt cold, so cold, he couldn’t keep warm and then blackness.
Harry moved brusquely at that, turning to look at him frowning, like he couldn’t believe what he just said.
—. You are upset — Harry looked at Bellatrix for a second, wondered how she could ask such a thing after what she just told him.
He was glad that for his aunt this was enough of a report, because he honestly did not understand why any of that meant he had to be sent here. But then…it was just as every summer, right?...
—omg, right? — The girl Ron had introduced as Lavender, his girlfriend, said excitedly —. Is like I can´t get him to keep up, and he hasn’t updated his Instagram in weeks, like he´s been ghosting me all summer and I couldn’t even see what he was doing online
—No no no, look ahm...— she stopped him —. I´m sorry, that was uncalled for, you were just trying to be nice,  I just…I just moved here and I’m starting a new school and… is a lot of stress
The speech was good, the little part he paid attention to at least. His father went on about the pride it had given him to see his son and heir grow up and when he was finished  Draco applauded with the rest.
Tom, took long steps to reach his study, not wanting anyone to hear this conversation. After he had closed the door, he finally approach his desk to take the call.
—Are you texting her the news? — Draco asked half laughing to Regulus, ignoring Milo´s weak defense.
—Yeah…Neville stays at Blaise´s every other night, just so that he doesn’t have to be in that house —
He looked in the direction of the counter where Bellatrix was waiting for their drinks and wondered what could have possibly possessed Tom to ambush him with this.
Harry opened his mouth ready to say “Yeah sure, I’ll have him send you an email” when they heard screams on the hallway.
He sighed and looked at Tom, who was hiding his own boredom behind a glass of wine, holding in front of his lips but not drinking anything.
—You want my solutions, that the only reason you keep coming to therapy, so you can get answers out of me
The first few years had been the hardest, leaving everything he knew so he could become Tom´s son. And two years later he sill found himself struggling with it.
—I’d rather not risk it, is says very explicitly why you were arrested, it would be scandalous if it ever came out
—I thought you meant people with financial freedom, I don´t know how much help we can get from people our own age
Harry understood the need of going…the plan was to introduce him to other snakes, learn from them, and to finally reveal he was an omega… it was supposed to be important, but he was mostly just excited about not spending the summer at the Dursley´s.
—And you have said several times, how you never imagined yourself to be a parent— she added—. You thought were infertile
—Maybe that is the problem, you have never been challenged before, — Snape took a quill and started scribbling —. Ill shall appoint you with a study group and a classmate as your tutor, I think Mister Malfoy would do nicely
Harry wished they could flash forward to a point where everything between them was said and done, or better yet, he wished there was nothing to talk about, he wished they were fine.
—He transferred from Durmstrang, he is a bit grumpy though—Lavender said pouting— He only talks to his friend ammm… Regular?
—Lavender hi — he said hunching a little a from her, trying to dislodge his arm without being rude about it.
—Something about me being and omega and having options — Blaize seemed uncomfortable talking about it.
—Is Milo —he corrected extending his hand to Victor— Regulus just keeps forgetting — he added throwing his cousin a pressing look.
—What…Are you… sniffing me? — he asked laughing —. Someone told me you had like a good sense of smell but dude…
Neville shrugged but his cheeks turned red. The other three shared a look at this and tried to hide their laughter, Neville was so reserved that it was amusing to see him showing that much emotion, the urge to tease him was strong.
—We could press the issue — Tom continued—. But Sirius will be taking care of your record being erased, and for that to work we should not put any more attention to it
—No, he is highly enjoying this, he tells me everything that’s happening at home, he even sent me an audio of my mother losing it last week
They all turned to see who it was, there on the next road of students was Neville. He smiled and pointed forward.
—Everything alright? — Tom said as a greeting, confidently approaching and sitting as head of the table.
Silence, death silence for what felt like a minute. He could almost imagine Tom going still on the other side of the phone call.
—Clam down —he told himself when he realized his heart was beating like crazy—. He didn’t hit me, he hasn’t hit me in years
—Ooookey— he accepted starting to turn, thinking it would be better go take a look at the scarves like Madame Malkin said.
Harry stalled remembering, his uncle had been so angry at him.  Maybe this was him making good on his threat to send him to a special school, and these men were here to assess how crazy he was.
—Yeah whatever— Draco said before remembering something —. So…Were you like…being secretive about him? you didn´t mention a friend of yours was coming
Those had been the goods times. Harry would have been content with his life staying like that forever, he wished he´d never gone to London.
And he really was, so embarrassingly naive, trying to fit, make it better, when he had just been the bastard son in a close to dickens book situation.
After that they had taken his blood and made him spit in a tube. His aunt had given them farewell happily and Harry had been surprise at her good disposition at having stranger in their house but after a few days all had gone back to normal as if nothing, the incident no more than a coma in their life. Harry had even began to wonder if he had imagined it all and just when he was deciding to forget they brought Tom.
—You were always on the short side, but that is normal, omegas grow late —Harry looked at Sirius, he was looking at some documents on his laps, still he didn’t feel safe enough to speak freely.
—Yes, that of course, but… he is an omega, and He is Milo´s age,  very promising, right?—Harry frowned at that and turn to look at Tom intrigued, hadn’t he told her?
—Mom is not their fault, you know they were after us, they are just snatching this change like the leeches they are—Bill spoke up.
—Uhmm Thank you — he said slowly, clearly not meaning it —. Cute?…that’s…never heard that one before
—I didn’t know you guys were friends—Blaise was Malfoy´s best friend and ran in a totally different circle than Neville, everyone did really, Neville was quiet, shy and seemed perfectly happy with ignoring them.
Back when he was younger he didn’t quite understand who Tom was, didn’t thought much about it really, he was just a guy who visited him form time to time, brought presents, took him out on trips…it took him a while to understand, that this man was his father, and it was crazy to think now, that he as happier before knowing.
Blaise came in the room throwing his school bag away with no care of where it landed. Neville a quiet presence behind him.
—O yes… is a pity— Bellatrix said picking up a napkin and starting to play with it—. But when you are upset, I can see it, you two get the same distant expression in your eyes
—Well it seems he is staying and besides, My mother always says it, Sirius biggest accomplishment was convincing everyone he is harmless
—You know Milo, is no fun for me either to have to spend the afternoon doing double work because of you
—I’m sure it was, for a Burmese phyton too — one man said, his tone was very calm and harry felt like he understood.
—I think is him — Sirius ensured. He gave him a long look before adding —…your parent can’t know yet
—Shit…—Regulus said while holding his cigarette midair, pausing before taking a drag.—. You think they paid to get her out?
—I read that the modern methods of birth control come from a beast invention, if having heirs was such an issue why was this a worry for them? Even before it was for the rest of society?
—Isn’t he? because you were supposed to present him to the den two years ago, instead we never heard from him again, it makes you wonder
—Milk that, requested breakups should feel like max achievement to them, extreme compromise, set a high price early on—Pansy said in such a professional tone that they couldn’t help but snort in shock—. Believe me, you´ll thank me later
—Yes, his grandmother passed recently, right? — Tom answered, looking uninterested as he finally took a sip of his wine.
—Uhmm yeah, I didn´t mention it? — He tried to remember but he probably didn´t, it wasn’t a piece of information he offered on introduction.
—I think they will ask you to break up with Lavender—she whispered—. I heard them talking about it, you can´t be seen flaunting a human girl in our current situation…I’m sorry
Draco considered the idea, he knew the Gaunts had some king of agreement win Norway, given that so few snakes were left they wanted to stick together.
—Very much so, no matter if he has manifested powers, I doubt he will present as an alpha, probably a beta…he is terribly small, have you seen? Although that might be because of his upbringing
—Here you are — They both turned as his mother joyful voice reached them. She walked to them and took Draco by the shoulders. She was smiling but her grip was strong, the intention clear, to get him away from Sirius —. Come along, your father is about to give his speech
—Great question— the mans looked delighted —. So during the late 1800s there was an explosion in beast population, many of the most well know covens today were formed during this period, like the Norwegian snakes for example. But as you can expects conflict also became more common inside clans. From… I would say 1930 and 1950 we had a reactive retraction, many families choosing to solve the issue of inheritance with limiting to only one child, and this is how over time beast genes became rarer and more associated with an elite
