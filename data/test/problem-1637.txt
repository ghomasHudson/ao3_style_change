“And then…” Draco draws out the word suggestively. He swipes his tongue over his bottom lip. “You would have fucked me.”
Draco cursed under his breath, dragging the heel of his hand down, turning it to cup Harry’s balls and tug them through the fabric. “I brought full place settings.”
It was one of the most fundamental truths of Harry’s life: as soon as things were going well, everything would turn to shit.
“Where’d you get that?” Potter asked, looking interested. Draco thumbed it open.
Harry seems caught off-guard by the question, but after a moment takes a deep breath and starts talking. His voice is steady at the beginning, but his eyes go dark with same shadows they held when he mentioned it earlier, and Draco listens, heart pounding, as Harry relates what’s probably the bare bones of a story that still manages to be so fantastical Draco might not believe it if he hadn’t been witness to certain events. He averts his eyes from Harry’s face — it makes things easier, somehow — but shifts closer until they’re touching, and when Harry’s breath catches at one point, rests his palm over the jut of Harry’s shoulder blade. He maps the contours of Harry’s back, tight shifting muscle and smooth skin; he toys with the hair at the base of Harry’s skull. Harry’s voice drops abruptly.
“They don't—” someone says in quiet, low timbre, equally rusty. And familiar.
Six months. "And if I don't—"
“Harry,” Draco said. He tightened his hand on Harry’s forearm. “I’d like to speak with my mother alone.”
“Wait for me to get decontaminated!” Draco yelled, or perhaps muttered, against the hot skin of Potter’s neck. “But
In less time than it took Harry to procure the coffee, Kreacher had furnished them with a suitable tree. Snow was thick in the garden over the hedges and on the grass, the sky above it the shade of a robin’s egg. They left the curtains open to it and dressed the tree with ribbons and strings of berries, with tiny, exquisitely carved and bejeweled wooden ornaments from a trunk Kreacher brought down from the attic: a dragon with glowing ruby eyes, a wizard with an obsidian cloak, a unicorn with a luminescent opal horn. Kreacher, humming like an elf a hundred years younger, decorated the parlour’s mantelpiece with boughs of holly and evergreen, and with fat white candles charmed to burn for days without losing any of their wicks.
talk about it?”
“Yes,

Harry turned, a guilty smile creasing his face when he spotted Astoria. Her dark hair was a glossy curtain down to her shoulders, and she’d chosen to entirely reject wizarding attire with a silky wine-coloured suit; her trousers were wide and fluttering, and the cut of her jacket exposed the bare inner curve of each breast — in a low v, almost to her belly button — as well as the pale skin of her torso. But the glittering buttons clasping her jacket shut, and the wide diamond choker around her throat gave a more serious nod to the formality of the event, and she looked unperturbed by Harry’s quick double-take. She returned his smile and lifted the champagne flute she was holding in a silent toast, then took a modest sip as she waited for his response.
But since waking up with Potter in his bed, he'd found himself unable to stop blurring the line between their tentative friendship and the more he knew Potter wanted too. It had taken all of his hard-earned self-discipline to let Potter stumble off to work, robes thankfully hiding what felt to be an impressive erection.
studied in training, no one does.”
, his mind whispers insidiously when he flinches at the formality) might. The apology note throws shadows over everything, and Harry twists in bed each night, touching the looping scrawl of the words on the page. Breathing in Malfoy’s fading scent — wanting him on instinct, for better or worse.
“Why the
“Like you. I do, I
because…” Draco’s voice cracked, jaw going tight. “Was I supposed to find out today and not have any questions?”
Frankly, until Draco’s little exchange with her today, he’d never thought she might be so unconscionable as to send a being like an elf into battle for her, without protection. But what did he know. “Fine, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do other things.”
Harry looks around, desperation thrumming through him. He's too vulnerable, even standing there pressed up against a wall, but for the life of him he can’t think of a way in that doesn’t equal certain death.
” Draco tore open his own scroll and scanned the notification. “How?”
Draco paused, then gave up trying to remember what he’d been asking. Neither the question or  answer really mattered anymore; maybe none of them had. Not if Potter was going to look at him like
she said — waving him off.
And if the body who first rose could understand what it was seeing, it would object; it would even perhaps fight the things it has brought into existence.
“Can Malfoy hear me?”
“As evidenced, I think we can safely say that most of my ideas in regards to you are not my best,” Draco said. But the tension on his face was fading, and he ran his fingers through his hair. “Listen, I won’t be long, so—” He waited for a moment, returning Harry’s look with one of impatience. “—get out?”
“No,” Harry said. There was no reason to make her feel bad, and it wasn’t as if he had any claim on her time simply because they were friends.
“No need to apologise,” she said smoothly, and Ron nodded, eager to agree.
about the list,” Potter said, annoyed, “and you were just there. And the showers was an accident—”
Stupid Kingsley. Stupid new policies of training with Unspeakables. Stupid fucking Draco Malfoy, wearing stupid, low-slung black joggers and a clinging white tank-top instead of those boring grey robes that cover the stupid, slender curves of his biceps and the stupidly elegant jut of his shoulder blades. Those robes swim around him, make him look skinny. Harry much prefers them.
Hermione takes her preferred seat, just to the right. As her gaze settles on the fire popping merrily in the hearth, her mind wanders back to Neville and she’s seized with the abrupt, painful wish that the room was cold and dark. With the fire lit, everything feels too normal somehow, reminds her too much of visiting this office as a child.
“They’re not fit to donate,” Malfoy argued, finally turning to face him.
“Let me have you for longer than I haven’t,” Draco said. His voice was fervent, his hands warm on Harry’s legs, his gaze steady on Harry’s face. “I’ll believe whatever you say about me, then.”
...” Malfoy said doubtfully, and Harry looked up once more, a speechless snarl tearing from his throat. Malfoy held up both hands, palms flat. Defensive. “No,” he said, steadier. “It’s fine. Potter, it’s
“We should start soon — if we’re going to,” Harry says.
Draco’s eyelids lowered; his hips jerked. "What are we even…"
But he makes himself stay to watch, because that was what Hermione said to do, and Harry… Harry does what needs to be done, no matter the cost to himself.
It comes with a swish and flick, simple as
“Why did you insist we check?” Draco asks before addressing Harry’s question. “The house was practically falling apart at the seams. It looked like something a Weasley would build. What did you expect to find?”
“Because of its relation to Fiendfyre,” Draco says.
before coming home,” Draco says with a toss of his hair away from his face, and Harry wonders how, exactly, Draco expects him to respond.
“No, it was never like that between us. But—” Harry shrugs. He’s not sure where to go from there, why it matters that it was the first moment he’d felt wholly happy in years. His racing heart — so little of it had to do with the physicality of attraction, or even the kiss itself, but was a part of something deeper, and closer to the reason he took his wand from his throat when he heard Ron in the hall on that long, dark night after the Battle. It had something to do with how he’s always worn his survival instincts so close to the surface, and why he’s honed them so well; something to do with what he used to forge them in the first place, and finding a reason to, on a Christmas morning nine years before that night. “But it was different than with Hermione. Ron’s my… Before him, I was—” He makes the effort to get the word out. “—
Harry paused. The crushing seriousness of Malfoy’s tone finally sank in, blotting out the direction of Harry’s thoughts. He gulped once— nodded. “Yeah. Okay.” He tilted his head up Malfoy, who was staring down at him with a small frown pinching the bridge of his nose, and said, “Okay. I’ll Owl— either way.”
* * *
“Grab my jeans, can you?” Potter asks. He toes off each of his boots to bare his feet, wiggling his toes with a groan. Draco scowls and casts a pointed freshening charm before grabbing Potter’s jeans, and Potter gives a huff of amusement. “I’m sure yours are no better.”
“The, uh. Mine, I guess, and it’s got a separate tub.” It takes Harry a second to understand why Malfoy is looking at him so patiently. “Oh. Yeah. Upstairs, second door on the right. Towels and things in the cabinet next to the shower.”
“Well, not… memorised.” He shrugged, gaze shifting away.
Malfoy shrugged, still watching him keenly. A cool, waking blue was starting to drift through the gauzy curtains, though sunrise had to still be an hour away, and it subtly changed the proportions of his face. Softened some of Malfoy’s bladed features. “It’s not something people talk about. It’s a little crude to admit to your magic’s not working properly, isn’t it, and since the advent of certain potions, it’s become less necessary to seek aid — or, people think it is anyway, feel cured by what they get at the apothecary. Besides, the few of us who are born with the natural ability to use it on others tend to be purebloods, and people like my father felt—”
That he can't stop thinking of Malfoy like that.
The Blacks always had hawthorn trees on their properties, Sirius had told him. They were enchanted, powerful. They protected the land and the wizards that resided upon it. And since, by nature or design, the majority of Blacks were born within certain timeframes, they were usually chosen by hawthorn wands as well, including Sirius —
day to do this?” Potter said. His nose and cheeks were red, wind-chapped, but the rest of his face was pale — with the exception of his eyes, which glittered brightly behind his glasses, the white sky a stark backdrop behind him. He had a point; Draco’s fingers were stiff and frozen, even encased in his best, fur-lined, dragon-hide gloves, and his whole body felt like one giant bruise. A good lesson for the next time he wanted to have sex and then play a four-hour game on a broom with no sleep in between, maybe.
“Hold onto me and relax,” Malfoy says, and since it seems he’s going to do it either way, Harry digs his fingers into Malfoy’s shoulder and swallows several times in succession as he forces his body to relax despite the pain. Malfoy cups the underside of Harry’s arm below the loose joint, firmly grasps the top of Harry’s shoulder, and—
“Sounds like a rather appropriate summary of your whole life, actually,” Draco says, snorting. Harry shoves his shoulder, wishing his life was such that he could get offended, but it’s, well, accurate. Draco rocks back with a laugh and meets his eyes. “I’m glad,” he says. “That you know.”
“Yes.” This time, his laugh sounded strained, his smile obviously forced. “You’re probably a ridiculous one.”
Harry swallowed the bile rising in his throat and forced his wand down.
“The woman,” Harry prompts, when Draco doesn’t go on.
“Later,” Draco says, gazing at him with heavy-lidded eyes.
“Feels like I haven’t come home, until I can,” he says.
The door loomed ahead, heavy with brass fittings, a hostile prison-gate of a thing that Harry didn’t want to try to open. But Draco stopped in advance of the foyer, and Harry realised, a skipped heartbeat before Draco set his hand to the doorknob, where they were.
to go back to hating Pansy, the simpering, jealous girl who’d called for Harry’s head on a spike when he was barely a man.
Reeled in by the irritation on Draco’s face, and by how remarkably tender such an expression could be, Harry was getting closer to him — and Draco was no longer moving away. “What if Grimmauld Place wants you to stay?”
* * *
* * *
“If you look.” Draco reached into the shower and turned it on. Then he tugged his shirt off over his head and dropped it onto the toilet lid.
Harry shuddered. “I want—”
Malfoy said, “You.”
“Mm.” Draco looked him up and down. “At least whatever you stopped to save didn’t ruin your clothing. What was it this time, a baby seal?”
“I’ll see you there in a minute,” Draco says.
“You could have picked something else for us,” Harry pointed out with an uneasy roll of his shoulders. “She would have understood you having problems doing this one.”
Harry blows out a breath. “Right. Okay. We’ll pay attention tomorrow, then. They tend to go… inactive, during the day, unless some stimuli attracts their attention. I think the heat of the sun has something to do with it.”
Kreacher popped in quietly. He looked as weary as Harry felt, and stood there with stooped shoulders, the bags under his eyes swollen. “Master Harry requires something, sir?”
, maybe, enough that his conscience didn’t even whimper.
He knows deeper concern for his mother will come later, but then— She’s always been more adept at taking care of herself, of things, than most people realise. Whatever Granger has planned, Narcissa will be four steps ahead, a regal queen on the chessboard simply awaiting her opportunity to move into position. But as for Lucius…
Startled into his own laugh, Draco tilted his head to allow Potter more room. Potter bit down on a tendon and he shivered. “I suppose we might be able to arrange—” But no, maybe they wouldn’t, depending on how this went. “Some other time. Not tonight.”
“Stop whinging,” Harry says. Leaning against a desk, he opens a bottle of water and drinks for several seconds, throat working, then passes over the remains. “In case you’ve forgotten, ‘scratching’ me, probably means ‘killing’ me. I’ve had ten years to learn advanced combat skills. You took fencing for, what, a couple of years as a kid?”
But… Draco had let him stay the weekend.
Harry can’t really think of much to say to that except, “You know how mad Teddy is for you too, right?”
“I don’t know if there’s anything here,” Harry says. His feet feel rooted to the floor. Draco’s chest is free of scars, decorated only by a soft smattering of hair that narrows to a thin, ash-blond ribbon below his navel, his skin as fine and pale as marble. Draco reaches for his flies and arches an expectant brow that somehow pairs well with the weariness on his face. Harry clears his throat. “We’re in—”
Sorry if it doesn’t look like what you’re familiar with, but—”
Hermione follows her train of thought — she’s worried Narcissa will say something about Ron. That she’ll lie about what’s happened to him, or… or tell the truth, to gain the upper hand.
“Still in the habit of taking things that aren’t yours, I see,” he said with a sniff.
Malfoy keeps pace, huffing beside him, his long strides pounding the pavement under them with much more ease than Harry would expect for someone who’s been so inactive until recently; he’s a runner, that much is clear. And whether due to the sharing of his magic or just sheer luck, he seems to anticipate Harry’s movements, each abrupt turn into an alley, each dodge away from a street Harry recognises, as cleanly as a hunted gazelle. Harry concentrates on that, on Malfoy’s grace and almost psychic understanding of how Harry operates in an escape — it helps Harry to overlook the now-searing pain in his shoulder, throbbing tremendously with every footfall he takes. He grips his bad arm in his working one, pressing it against his side to keep it stationary, and pushes on.
Resigns himself to forever being turned on by Potter’s perpetual bedhead, especially when they’re in bed, and
and call him,
Harry glanced at Hermione to see if she’d argue the point, but she was gazing at Ron, transfixed. She blinked a glittery sheen of wetness from her eyes and slipped her hand into his, leaning her weight against his side. Ron dropped a kiss onto the cloud of her curls and shot Harry a sheepish smile. Harry cleared his throat, looking away, then self-consciously shuffled them into what Draco insisted on calling
Looking up, Draco caught him staring and schooled his expression. It left Harry feeling as though he’d been on the verge of knowing something new, something important, and had lost it. Draco dipped his spoon into his custard, brought it up. He said, “Merlin was in Slytherin,” then gave a small, nonchalant shrug, and slipped his spoon between his lips.
He thinks,
She doesn't reply. Across from him, Harry takes a few strangled pulls of air.
“I know what you meant.” Harry says. He heads for the door while he has the advantage. “I’ll see you around.”
“Not at all,” Harry lied. Half-turning to glance at Goyle and finding him still occupied at the cabinet, Harry casually smoothed the material over the front of his trousers and sent a quick, wandless Numbing charm to the region. Toeing off his shoes carefully so as to not scuff their high polish, Harry scooted them to the side with one foot, then took a deep breath and padded over to the pedestal in his socks, locking eyes with Draco as he stepped up onto it. As he lifted his hands to his belt.
, and about fifteen Galleons. It was pricier than he expected, but the lube he picked was silky and easily washed away with water or a murmured spell, as well as imbued with properties for heightened sensation, and he considered it well worth the cost.
"Everything is fine, mate. Just. We're here. It's over. Can you hear—?"
“Oh my god,
" Narcissus repeats, her voice like a lash. "Not if you love your daughter even a fraction of the amount I love my son." Hermione's heart stops; the slow smirk purses Narcissa’s lips is one of the most terrifying things she's ever seen. Narcissa tilts her head and says, "Pobble?"
Harry watches them pop out of sight one by one, at ten second intervals. He doesn’t like doing this to Hermione, knows it’ll probably worry her and potentially create a media storm the likes of which she hasn’t faced since the last time Harry did something like this. But she knows well enough where Harry’s priorities lie — even if she had to learn it from the rampage Harry’d gone on when Draco had what turned out to be nothing more than an accidental case of food poisoning.
Hermione was the one who stopped the ceremony, then.
“No.” Harry arches his hips, bringing their cocks into contact. “But we can pretend, if you want.”
“I don’t know, but I’m assuming it has to do with Granger holding her hostage.” Draco snorts. “Not a thing that breeds trust, that.”
Malfoy hesitated a beat, then lifted his chin and walked past Harry. But he stopped just outside the room and waited for Harry to close the door. They walked down together, the backs of their hands touching and moving away, touching again, shoulders brushing in the narrow stairwell — still brushing when it expanded, each flight wider than the one before it. Harry’s breath seemed very loud by the time they got to their landing, and Malfoy could have been holding his for all Harry could hear it.
Well, Christmas and lube.
, each of them says, in one way or another. “About how special magic is, how rare. About forgiveness, and faith, and…” Draco pauses, struck. He swallows. “About possibility.”
All of the simple-to-navigate boundaries of their friendship were gone, and they sought familiarity in fighting with one another, stupidly and often viciously, over things that didn’t matter to Harry at all: the invitation to one of the Ministry’s fundraising galas, whether they should cook or go out or order takeaway. Harry floundered, sure there was more behind their fights, unsure what to do to stop having them, goaded when asking only resulted in another one.
“It was my pleasure,” Hermione says, when Narcissa conspicuously doesn’t continue. “I hope you’re enjoying your company as well.” She nods her greeting to the elves. Descendents of the first elves who came to work at Hogwarts, they’ve been thoroughly vetted, and have taken their instructions — not to follow Narcissa’s orders or interact with her in any way, to accompany her everywhere, and to report everything she does, suspicious or not — with gratifying resolve. Hermione reminds herself to prepare Minvera for the daily file she’ll receive about Narcissa’s bathroom habits and adds, “Perhaps they’ll help to assuage your loneliness.”
“Thanks. Mind fetching something clean for Edward to wear?” he throws over his shoulder, already leading the way up the stairs.
“Yeah,” Harry said. His return smile felt a little shaky; so did his hands. “Bed sounds good.”
* * *
and understanding of my own feelings,  and the way I viewed yours. It felt like those first nine years between us were just… points on a map, hoping we might end up in the same place. And I couldn’t get on a train bound for anywhere you wouldn’t be.”
Pansy’s smile is utterly wicked with glee — she’ll have had a hand in it, Draco knows — and though Blaise looks bored because he always looks a little bored, there’s a telling air of smugness about it this time.
“Being a—” Robards cut himself off with a strained laugh. “I’m afraid it’s not the same. Choosing to link yourself to power hungry blood purists who throw their wealth around to get their own way no matter who suffers is much different to— to—”
Draco tempers the bitter twist of his lips before Harry can see it. But honestly. If ever an obvious statement has been made.
“Your wand?”
” and the terror that gripped Harry made him hesitate long enough that Malfoy could push him off.
“How much of my gold are you spending today?”
A deeply petty part of Draco resents his hesitation and wants to refuse, but logic reminds him that Harry’s yet to let him down. Not in any real way. Shivering, Draco fits himself just enough against Harry’s side, their legs tangling with a familiarity born of necessity. Harry’s arm comes down to lightly circle Draco’s shoulders, the tension leaking from his body in increments.
“It couldn’t possibly have been a permanent charm, which should be obvious now that it’s down, and have
Draco crossed his arms over his chest. "Why should I?"
Harry, eyes on the throb of Draco’s pulse in his throat, said, “It’s giving them to ‘us’, is it?”
“I wouldn’t have been able to say no,” Harry says. It’s as honest a statement as he’s ever made. He can still recall the
“I think so,” Ron said. “Almost no one has been shopping on that side of Diagon lately. Bad location. Too near to Knockturn without any of the taboo appeal. Funny thing is that Malfoy could probably help a lot of people if he can really— well. Anyway.” Ron rose. “You said something about lunch?”
He inhales, letting his mind go blank. He rolls his head from side to side unthinkingly, neck loosening when it cracks; he shifts his shoulders to limber them up. “Get the broom,” he says. Malfoy does a double-take and Harry shakes his head. “Don't panic,” he says again. “Just get the broom and… Do what you can with it. If we can’t make it work again, we’ll... Climb from balcony to balcony.”
Draco’s cock was harder than it had been in Potter’s presence in years.
They were easy decisions to make: under the stars, their fourth wedding was in the garden.
Harry blinked. “I suppose the polite thing would be to pretend you’ve ever been polite?”
“You’ll do no such thing,” he said sharply. “You won’t say a bloody
Harry sets his own head back down. He closes his eyes again and goes to sleep.
“Mmm…” Potter let his mouth be taken in another kiss as he seemed to consider, still stroking Draco with that slow, warm hand. His mouth was warm now too, and Draco couldn’t help kissing him, really; Potter had got him too used to it when he was turned on. Potter broke away. “What do you want to know? I went to some clubs, over the summer,” he whispered. “I— I had all these questions about myself and I met someone. I learned some things from him, but it wasn’t serious. I’ve, um, done this part before.”
seems just beyond the cusp of allowable magic, as he discovered when Travers went down. Most magic that can be used for offensive or defensive measures is like that, and Harry knows he can stomach hurting the dog with the weapon at his hip if it attacks, he
“You couldn’t possibly expect me to agree with that,” Draco said, an exasperated tilt to his mouth. He scooted down a little further, cradled by his mound of pillows, and groped awkwardly under the blanket. “We’re twenty-one.”
, around his wrist,
“We’re aware,” Malfoy said grimly, and Harry realised they were still holding hands, Malfoy’s palm hot and damp against his. Harry tried to let go, but Malfoy tightened his grip. “Give them another minute,” he said, jerking his chin in the direction of Narcissa, who had at least stopped swaying where she stood.
“It’ll be easier tomorrow,” Potter says, the words followed by a small grunt and the snap of the button on his jeans, the hiss of his zip. “We’ll start scouting for a good place to make camp well before the sun goes down, have a bit of time to get everything in place so we can be more comfortable.”
“What?”
* * *
There’s nothing Narcissa can do to stop that — not yet and perhaps not ever — so she doesn’t bother with an answer. She’s content to let Granger think she has so little regard for human life if necessary.
That uneasy look flickered over her face. It would serve her right if Draco sicked up all over her, it really would.
“Okay,” he says, wondering how long he’s been standing there when he realises Teddy’s begun tensing once more in his arms. Harry pivots and heads downstairs to the Floo, and adds a hasty, “No, no, it’s fine, that’s good, yes, we’ll get Draco and— and punk-anshoo,” for effect. He doesn’t love the idea and it’s a hit to the remnants of his pride, but his pride can get fucked for all he cares if it brings Teddy any comfort.
“Mm.” Draco looks out the window, squinting thoughtfully. “I was young,” he says. “Mother always bought them for me, anything I wanted really. They made me feel a certain way, and Father turned a blind eye because—”
There’s a long pause. Draco chews on his lip. “If I had my wand— I could get us out in a bare second.”
"Shush, now, and do as your mummy says. Cissy needs to talk with her, too," Narcissa tells her, pressing a kiss to the top of her curls. "There's a good girl."
There was something sly and enquiring about how she said it that settled heavy as a stone in Harry’s stomach. “Thanks for the sales lesson,” he said, forcibly unclenching his jaw. He smiled the smile he wore in an interrogation room, widening it when her gaze darted away. Swift, but telling. “But if your insinuation is that Draco or I have done that to each other, you’re wrong. You weren’t there when—” He broke off, swallowing. He looked at the curtains leading to Draco’s flat.
“Kreacher didn’t wake you, did he?” Draco frowned.
“A little,” Harry concedes, ignoring the shudder of warning in his chest. “Ron, Hermione. I talked about Fred a bit with Arthur and Mo—
— and as long as Draco could compartmentalise, it wasn’t as if they couldn’t keep... doing what they were doing. Perhaps until the school year concluded.
done, not coming to talk to Malfoy hours ago?
“Ah, yes.” Astoria leaned to peer over his shoulder as Harry turned back to study the crowd. “Where has he got himself off to? Come to think of it, I didn’t see you two show up.”
Harry didn’t volunteer why he brought his book bag, though Malfoy’s pursed-lipped glances at it weren’t exactly subtle; neither of them had so far brought anything beyond their wands and baskets, other than the occasional pair of gloves. And Malfoy didn’t ask, not until Harry requested a favour. Even then, Malfoy approached his curiosity in a roundabout fashion.
“That’s not necessary,” Draco said, even as he moved into Harry’s space. “In fact, I think—”
“Well, I don’t know,” Draco said, sniffing. Intractable as ever. With dawning horror, Harry wanted to touch him all over — wanted to throttle him, wanted to work the buttons of his breeches open with his teeth. Dear god. Draco scowled. “Are you going to Disarm me again?”
“So you’ve mentioned,” Draco says dryly, but if Harry realises he’s being indulged, he’s unoffended. “We probably won’t have time to relay all of that.”
“Yes.” As much as anyone had ever tried to be. “He—”
“You made an offer,” Potter said, not looking anywhere near as poleaxed as I felt or he ought to, in my estimation for someone who’d never shown any inclination he was attracted to men. In fact, Potter’s cheeks were flushed and his eyes were bright, and he seemed… Well, there was no way I was going to put actual words to the look on Potter’s face, for once. But the scowl he’d been wearing in direct complement to my well-perfected sneer had vanished. Potter lifted his chin, chest heaving lightly. “I accepted.”
It takes Harry a few minutes to compose himself, and he feels too exposed by the open space — and Malfoy’s narrow look — when he finally joins him. He hands Malfoy the half-scimitar, wiped clean of its lingering bloodstains. Malfoy takes it with a small gulp, holding it loosely at his side.
“I guess not,” Harry said, smiling tiredly, and Draco paused at the entrance to the study to look over his shoulder — a few seconds longer than someone might, if they weren’t waiting for something. In his fatigue, Harry imagined Draco’s steady grey gaze as having gone soft, an impossibly tender thing like the back of his neck; he imagined himself stepping forward and pressing Draco to the wall, getting close to see if he was right. His thighs tensed with a push forward that he didn’t take, the conviction of single step looming in the space between them, the threat of chasm opening under his feet if he breached it.
in bed, knew that kissing him through a handjob was sure to make him gasp and writhe, knew the way his cock twitched and his thighs tensed when he came. Whether Potter was there out of convenience or because he actually liked Draco shouldn’t matter.
from her, Rose." Her wand is hot in her hand, violent magic swirling through her so fast she doesn't know if she can contain it. She meets Narcissa's gaze. "Let her
Draco sat next to him, had helped himself to the edge of Harry’s pillow and was resting at an awkward sideways angle. His eyes were closed, his forehead creased even in his doze. The strained calligraphy of grief pulled his lips in an elegant downward slope, and Harry got it, then. Remembered — what  had happened, and where he’d been, and everything he’d learned. He went breathless for a moment. He didn’t know how such a big thing could be so simple, or how it was possible not to have noticed a thing so big. He exhaled, which hurt, and inhaled again, which hurt even worse.
“Of course he does.” Malfoy sniffed and rounded the table. He selected a chair two down from where Harry was sitting at the head and dropped into it, leaning back and crossing his legs — stretching them out — without pulling closer to the table. He raised an imperious eyebrow at Harry, then directed it at Kreacher. “What’s more, he likes doing what I say. Don’t you?”
Draco sprinkled it into their house. His eyes were alight above the purple smudges that gave away his exhaustion, and a smile teased the corners of his mouth. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, dusting his hands when they were empty. “I’ve been… I needed to…” He shook his head. “I’ve been otherwise engaged.”
“Shut it.”
“Did you need fried eggs on toast the next morning?” Harry asks, feeling inexplicably soothed by the story. He smiles.
tired, really, just not tired of Draco’s room, or bed, or body. They were still lying in opposite directions, and Harry snuck a hand under the sheets to find slip it around one foot, tugging it towards him. Draco resisted for only a second, then huffed, set aside his tray, and unbent his leg. Pleased, Harry dragged the edge of his thumbnail along Draco’s arch. Watched his toes curl. “We should both be.”
“Stop.”
The silence, as Draco scrambled for a way to fill it, lasted thousands of lifetimes. Then Potter finished his beer, grinned, and dug a Galleon from his pocket to drop on the table.
lackeys. And look what had happened. Lackeys in general were a bad idea, which Potter must know now, having the entire school floating around him begging to do his bidding and complimenting his stupid hair and eyes and scar and arse and magical ability, oh
“I promised you a drink that night,” Draco says at last. “When you showed up at the club.”
Granger’s lashes flutter rapidly and then she resumes her original pose, though Narcissa’s pleased to note her hands have balled up. “You weren’t reading over his shoulder?”
At her request, the Unspeakables have been tinkering with the spell that allows mobile reception through and, apparently, taking such a call from the middle of Healing Wing wasn't ideal. But the Astronomy Tower is perfect, and the observation rooms within it remain one of the more successful — and popular — ideas Hermione incorporated when she took over and began updating the castle and curriculum. Sectioning off the tower makes it possible to accommodate students of every age at the same time without confusion over coursework, and it only takes a small charm to Vanish the walls for the upper-years’ studies. Muggle parents, in particular, have been appreciative to learn that science lessons continue after primary school, and the younger children never fail to look like they're involved in a great adventure during class.
Harry sighed and hitched the blanket a little more securely around his hips. He felt too bared by Draco's easy comprehension of his heart.  “So I did nothing.”
me, don’t you? You and Granger and what’s left of my department, and don’t think I’m not grateful to get out of the hotel alive, but you’ve gone thick in the head if you think that you’re not just as accountable to me as I am to you on this trip. You think you’d have got off the balcony without me? Or—”
“You look at it,” Draco said, a breathy semblance of his standard, snotty drawl. He mouthed along the knot of Harry’s jaw, a hard skim of teeth, and thrust into his fist. “If you brought me in here for a quick handjob, I’m more than fine with that. Keep watching and in a minute you’ll
“‘Hey, I have a few days off,’” Draco finally said — quoted. “‘Come over when you get off work if you’re free, need your help with blackout charms.” He finished with a sardonic scoff. Harry’s rising temper vanished like smoke. He hesitated, awkwardly debating with himself before scooting close, but stopped with a few inches left between them, when the line of Draco’s bare shoulders went tense. He heard Draco swallow.
him: how to make the comfort he offered less about himself than someone else’s. When Draco lost a patient or woke up shaking from a nightmare, Harry listened, and pulled together the threads of what he knew about Draco, to become whatever Draco needed.
The room was as he’d left it — as its original master had. Malfoy wandered in, darting a bemused glance at Harry, and from the doorway Harry said, “I found it… a few days ago. I’ve been back every day.” He pointed to the parchment resting on the centre table and Malfoy frowned and picked it up. “I— I made an inventory.”
According to Potter’s newly-retained representation, Astoria Greengrass, he has put old grudges with “non-threatening persons” to rest. But does that mean Potter is no longer the Saviour we believe him to be? Surely such unsavoury associations should be questioned, or at least under intense scrutiny for their duration, this journalist pointed out. “Not at all,” Ms Greengrass claimed via long-distance Floo call. “It is merely a sign that Mr Potter has grown as a person. He no longer nurtures the petty disagreements of old, which will help him in his pursuit of actual potential threats. Draco Malfoy is reformed, and I think his acquaintance with Mr Potter is proof of that as well.”
“Thank you,” Harry says again, seriously. “For this, and for— for coming back, too. I should have said so, before.”
“The pineapple?” he asked.
“Harry, Harry stop, we don’t have a lot of time,” she breaks in. “We’re drawing on elf magic right now, and I don’t want to injure them if I can help it.”
“Yeah. But—” It didn’t seem possible to Harry that he could have got it so wrong, yet again. That his timing could be so, so fucked. He shook his head.
There’s a long silence. Harry braces himself, but there’s an air of caution to Malfoy’s sarcasm when he next speaks. “Ah, yes, because of course
“What is it?”
"You had a right to be," Harry said.
“No…” Malfoy drew it out, questioningly. He tilted his head, a swath of pale hair falling over his forehead. He brushed it back. “But I can feel the lack of malicious intent. There’s a lot of calm in here.”
She dislikes them, uncertainties. Still, she allows herself to briefly savour a tiny rush of satisfaction as she turns to pull a quill from the drawer beside her bed, along with two sheets of parchment. Because she
Cursing under his breath, Harry detoured onto Whimsy Lane from High Street.
“You do,” Draco says, “and you can see it, even now: me, on my knees as you hold my hair and work my mouth over your cock until you’re coming down my throat. Can’t you? But…” He chuckles, one hand gripping his thigh through his dressing gown. “That’s not what you like best. You like being...catered to, don’t you, Potter? You like a long blowjob, one that’s not done until your whole cock is wet with saliva.” His flush deepens, and so does his smirk, and Harry can’t even breathe for wanting him. “Do want to instruct me on
After a moment, Potter tipped him a little smile. He climbed to his feet and turned his face up to the spray of the shower. The whole stall was hot with steam, but Draco’s dressing gown was soaked and the occasional splatter of water from Potter washing off made him shiver with chill. He wrapped the dressing gown tighter around him.
Harry does.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy says. But he doesn’t seem convinced of that, and neither is Harry. If Harry couldn’t stop himself from looking forward at this point, he’d perhaps be nervous about what that means for their trip, but he’s learned to take things day by day — sometimes even second by second. Malfoy takes a long pull of air. “Why are you here?”
The air shimmers and there’s a single beat of silence, every living thing within a kilometre somehow recognising the violation of the natural order. Then a passerby shakes off his tremble with a laugh and says, “Quelqu'un doit avoir marché sur ma tombe.”
“It was his attitude,” Hermione said, brows furrowing. “He was— Malfoy again, and all we’d done was— Frankly, I’m not convinced he didn’t know about Capricarian Black’s absolved marriage.”
“Well, he never finished it,” Harry says. “Or I fell asleep first. Have you heard it?”
” Potter’s forehead fell to Draco’s collarbone, and he reached down between them, knuckles coasting over Draco’s arse as he slicked the head of his cock. “No, just—” He pushed and the muscles of Draco’s rim
Putting on a smile, Harry walks up to the bed. “So, you, er, wanted a sleepover?” he ventures, and exhales deeply at Teddy’s solemn nod.
Draco holds the towel to his chest for another beat, face immobile. Then: “Yeah.”
Harry wheezed a laugh. “You know what, Narcissa?” he asked softly, disabling the
“I don't,” Potter says shortly. “We were— I came on assignment. Troyes.” Flicking Draco another glance, he shrugs the pack from his shoulders and moves to the sofa. “If it's safe enough here, I think we should stay for the night. What I'd like to—”
Draco coughed a little and swallowed the bite he was chewing. “What?”
Draco stared at him for a long beat. "In the last two weeks, he's pissed on my Oriental rug, gotten himself stuck in no fewer than nine different trees at the property line, stolen your wand, bitten me when I wouldn't let him ride Francis again, and masturbated on a priceless— oh Merlin, and look at him now!"
who Sirius Black was,” Draco muttered.
“I don’t know,” he says, unsettled. “I don’t… feel anything.”
Can’t you see he’s  bleeding out!”
“Are you all right?”
Hermione sniffled, then gave a little laugh. “You’re not even a little worried he won’t show up?”
“What on—?” Draco glared up at him, brandishing his wand as Harry advanced. “Harry—”
Potter’s mouth quirked so devilishly, Draco balled his hands to keep from reaching for him. “I was looking
Malfoy tucked his wand away and shrugged. “It’s getting late,” he said. “We should go to bed.”
Far worse than the probability that she’s lost Ron is the idea that he's out there walking gracelessly, beautiful blue eyes gone white, with a decomposing face full of features she knows better than her own. That he might not recognise the children they made together, or
Draco’s heart stutters, his chest heaving. He quietly gasps out “
“That’ll be fine.” Draco stares at him, a bitter taste on the back of his tongue. He shoots Harry a smile to hide his confusion. “You do seem to have a convenient talent for… covering me.”
“Harry.” Draco touches his arm, curling his fingers around Harry’s wrist to draw him a little closer, and Harry makes himself turn back, makes himself look at Draco’s face again; all of the aggravation in his face is gone. “I’m here. I’m fine,” Draco says, the gentleness in his tone almost too much to take. “You didn’t lose me.”
,” Potter gritted out that day, his hands tight on Draco’s biceps, green eyes wide and pupils blown. “We’re covered in a
tripping through his mind. “I was gone. Our things were gone.”
“One eighty-eight,” Draco finishes for him. Potter’s silent. He slides his hand over Draco’s groin, splaying his fingers there. Draco pushes into it and says, “Or my family being…” He takes a deep breath. “Or— Or Pansy.”
you,” Malfoy said. “They mob you because they want to and you won’t let them, which is a rather easy fix; we just need to control the flow of information. Part of that will be with the press, but most of it will come from interacting with people, who will do half the job of talking you up to journalists looking for a scoop. Good copy, remember? Only tailored for your professional advancement.”
“But the other—” Hermione faltered, her gaze a stab against Harry’s burning cheek. He picked at the edge of the luxurious conference table with his thumbnail and heard her draw in a breath. “Oh.”
“That I might be getting married someday, yeah,” Harry said in disbelief. “It was my grandmother’s. I inherited it when I turned twenty-one, but I wouldn’t use it even if I was getting engaged tomorrow!
was what left him utterly unprepared, walking out of the Floo on Friday number seven, to find Potter lounging in a booth a few steps away, all by himself.
“No,” Harry says, then amends, “Well, no one on my task force. Draco narrows his eyes at that, frown deepening. “All evil has been vanquished. For now. We got them.”
“Thanks,” he said, giving her a pained smile. The clothes were brighter than he was used to -- a deep teal shirt offset by the rich jade of his tie (colours he had promised to never try to change) over dark grey trousers -- and designed to attract attention rather than avoid it. He
, or perhaps simply,
Draco couldn’t exactly wrap the items up with a little bow and expect Potter to understand they weren’t actually gifts, so he figured placing them in strategic places around their room and offhandedly pulling them out over the course of Christmas day was a safe bet. The watch went into his pillowcase.
Draco finally broke the silence. “Your promotion?”
“Wait,” she said. Her face had gone ashen in the last week, her lips dry and cracking, and red between the cracks. Her voice was faint as dust, but everyone paused. “Wait. I’m close to figuring out… I just need a little longer, I know it.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. He pulled off his glasses, pressed his fingers to his eyes. “I’m so sorry. It’s just— it’s been—”
“Master Draco is being receiving your company.” Kreacher glared at him. “And Kreacher is having duties to attend.” He Disapparated with an angry little puff of smoke that smelled of mothballs and, concerningly, brimstone — a sure sign of a house elf in a rare temper.
Draco says nothing; there
Harry leaned closer, inhaling, and Draco’s breath caught. Held. His skin was clean and smelled of apples; he’d taken a bath before starting to pack. Harry was so mad for him, he could barely think straight. Draco’d probably lay him out flat the second they got to the duelling room — there was no better technique than being able to successfully distract your opponent.
The room spins around him and the last thing he sees is Potter's face coming closer, Potter's outstretched hand, before everything goes dark.
“Doing something in France, I suppose,” Harry said, though honestly he hadn’t really thought about it at all; it hadn’t seemed like something that mattered, with Malfoy so far out of reach. “How long does it take?”
And looked back up. “It’s. Uh.”
“So…” The word lingers, a question and statement at once, though Harry has no idea what conclusion he’s come to. Malfoy’s eyes are distant, thoughtful, and he licks his lower lip, then takes it between his teeth. He turns his gaze to Harry. “So we have no real way of knowing that we won’t run into them, do we? At any given time,” he says, brow furrowing. “Even if we don’t hear a mob of them approach. There are really no guarantees, are there?”
Malfoy lifted his head, turned to face him. Dragging air into his lungs, Harry wondered how they’d got so close when Malfoy was in the same spot at the end of the table and Harry had no memory of pushing into the space that separated them. Malfoy’s gaze flicked over him assessingly, looking less surprised to find Harry near than Harry felt.
— were… expensive.
“Do you really think he’s going to share it with you?” someone asks. Draco starts, the towel falling to the floor. She’s sitting on the lip of the counter in Muggle clothes like the ones she wore when they’d gone clubbing, before everything got complicated, a short skirt and sparkly black top that’s held up by slender threads over her bare shoulders. She crosses her legs at the ankle and idly kicks her feet back and forth.
Draco could still taste Potter's tongue in his mouth, could still feel the sleek press of it against his own. Fortunately, though the questions in Potter's ridiculously vivid eyes multiplied every day, he hadn't voiced one yet. That very morning, he'd gone pliantly into Draco's arms with no objection after announcing he was leaving for work, leaving Draco no choice but to fist his hand in Potter's robes and drag him forward. Ten minutes of fervent necking later, Potter bent backward against the table that contained Draco's flavour plants in their pots, they'd finally pulled away. Potter's lips had been rosy, shiny with saliva, and Draco'd had to stifle a growl of frustration because... What the fuck was he
“I know, I know. But—” Harry gulps in a breath, feeling strangely cold for a moment before he shakes it off. “Can you tell me who’s there? Who’s survived? Who— Who hasn’t?”
Malfoy snorted. “Colour me astonished,” he said, aiming a pointed glance at Harry’s plate. But he was paying attention, so Harry huffed and set his fork down.
“Yes.”
” Draco asked, feeling rather put-out. “Telling me I’m wonderful and that anyone who gets to know me will see that? How undeserving Potter is of my praise?” he suggested.
“Don’t tell me.” Malfoy’s voice dripped with false sympathy. The uncertainty had fled his face, a sly smile curling his mouth. "You really thought I’d been joining you because I
Harry stubbornly didn’t move — didn’t even reach for his wand, though it was obvious Malfoy was expecting him to. “I’m here and you have a few minutes. Teach me something.”
“I’ve really got to go,” he said, a few minutes into making out with Potter on his disgusting sofa.
“About how your diet needs more fibre, I’m assuming, from the look on your face,” Malfoy says, one brow arched.
He hears Draco make a tiny, breathless sound behind him as he starts to follow. Harry grins. Ron and the other Aurors will have things well in hand with the information Harry sent, and he figures it’s as good a time as any to take a small holiday, alone with the man he loves. He couldn’t have asked for a better one than a few days cuddling by a fire while they watch the snow, and making inventive use of every surface in the cabin. He’s never once skived off work before, but no one other he and Draco will know the truth.
Then Hermione cleared her throat. Rosy-cheeked, she looked up at Harry, squared her shoulders, and said, "Well?"
“I’m sorry,” he says. “I’ll get rid of it.”
For a second, she thinks she’s imagining the tear that glides down Minerva’s cheek. Even at her most demonstrative, Hermione’s never seen her cry before. But no, it’s really there, tracking a gleaming path from her sparse, wet eyelashes as she closes her eyes, all the way down to her chin. She clasps Hermione’s hands tighter.
The day was an exercise in sharp-eyed patience, a meticulously strategic duel, two areas in which it seemed the Malfoys had forgotten Harry’s experience. When Narcissa requested that Draco show her their room, Harry cut off Draco’s objection with two fingers pressed to the small of his back and went up with them; when Lucius flung his napkin onto the table and announced he and Draco needed privacy for an official discussion on their business holdings, Harry offered him the use of an owl to send for a solicitor. Moves made, and countered — by Harry’s clothing hanging in Draco’s wardrobe and two dented pillows on Draco’s bed, by an appointment with a solicitor a month out. Draco’s aplomb proved as essential as Harry’s determination in their roles as… whatever roles they’d assigned themselves for this pretense.

be Draco’s death sentence. In one way or another.
“Don’t worry,” Malfoy says, voice slipping back into its familiar, clipped tones so unexpectedly that Harry startles. Looking up, he sees Malfoy watching him, an unpleasant shadow on his face. “I’m not planning on staying — though you obviously need more help than Andromeda realised, or else she never would have allowed him to stay with you.”
“Well?” Malfoy drawled. “Unless your question was whether I’d care to join you downstairs for a—”
“I see.” Malfoy ducks his head a bit, pressing a light kiss to Teddy’s temple, and Teddy clings to him harder, wracked with sobs. Harry isn’t sure how to feel about the fact that he’s still crying; he doesn’t want Teddy to be sad anymore, but he likes that Malfoy’s presence isn’t an immediate fix-it, and that makes him feel even worse. Malfoy runs a practiced gaze over him, smirks, and says, “Haven’t got much sleep, have you?”
Another.
“Me neither,” Draco said. The press had been rabid over the summer,
“Were,” Harry said, scowling.
“But why?” Malfoy blurted. “When—”
" a pointed smack against the meat of his palm, "who were dosed with the Memory Obscurification Elixir."
He tells himself it doesn’t matter. Clings to that. He’d likely never have returned anyway, not after what’s taken place here. Not after what he’s had to do. But with each flutter of smoky magic and burnt earth that wisps past them, he’s reminded that the life he’s built to overcome his old one has been irrevocably altered. Trapped in the room, sure he’d not make it out alive, that had seemed a trifling thing to worry about. Out in the open, with Potter at his side and the lowering sun glaring down at them, dead bodies littering the streets, it’s different. He’s supposed to feel hope now. ...Isn’t he?
Putting down the pocket watch, Malfoy reached a hand behind him and murmured. His wand flew obligingly into his hand and he slithered closer to the trunk, still on his stomach, a rippling flex of his arse under those tight breeches, of his toes against the mattress. He came up on one elbow and touched his wand to the diorama of pixies, flicked it over the wings of one with a smooth little twirl. Pursing his lips, a knit of irritation forming on his brow, he did it again. The taxidermied pixie trembled, its wings extending and then freezing in place. Malfoy looked up and smiled — an uncomplicated smile, teeth and dimple flashing, proud and astonishingly sweet. Harry’s breath stuttered.
She assumes a placid expression when Minerva lowers her head. “How are you?” Her eyes are grave, but her brogue is kind. “When was the last time you slept?”
It’s a standard hotel room, albeit a little nicer than he’d thought when first coming in. There’s a little table pressed to the wall that turns out to be empty, but using his torch, Harry prowls around and stops at the desk he saw before. There’s a small bin to the side of it, which contains four rotting apple cores, two mushy brown banana peels, a few empty bags of crisps, and an empty jar with
“The sun is barely up and — dammit, Malfoy — we have to talk!” Potter said. But his seat on the broom changed from the bored, absent-minded way people flew on their way somewhere, to something more purposeful, posture straightening, elbows drawing in against his sides. His grip on the broom handle shifted. “I’m a bit sore for this, you know.”
Granger narrows her eyes. “Perhaps if you were half the witch or person or mother Molly Weasley is, I might.”
According to a statement made by Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister For Magic, Head Auror Gawain Robards has tendered his resignation — effective immediately. But unnamed Ministry sources claim our heroic Head Auror has done so in disgrace, and may additionally face criminal charges of blackmail, coercion, and theft. Robards, oft praised for his nearly ninety percent solve rate of cases in the last five years, worked with the famed Order of the Phoenix during the war against He Who Will Never Be Named, which makes this reporter wonder how far into the past his (alleged) criminal activities go. We will report events as they unfold.
“Oh, god.
Draco saved Harry’s life on no fewer than four occasions before Harry died for the second time. Harry thought it ironic that his death happened to coincide with his realisation of Draco's feelings for him.
get?” Draco asked. “Where am I supposed to be?”
“I'm better at it than you think.”
Malfoy makes things difficult of course, the way he always has. On the periphery of Harry’s life for years until that night, Malfoy’s now like a wandering star Harry’s rotating around, always at the centre of whatever gathering Harry attends; already in the canteen at work when Harry wants lunch; stepping out of the lift Harry’s about to board. A gravitational attraction Harry can no longer avoid. And worse: one who doesn’t acknowledge him other than with too-brief, expressionless glances.
Harry tucks the machete he transfigured from a broken signpost on the second night into the leather scabbard strapped to his hip. Silently, he heads down the stairs, avoiding the one near the bottom that creaks. It's too quiet a sound to worry about, but it startles him every time. The side-effects of making as little noise as possible for the last couple of weeks.
“No,” Malfoy said — sneering it. “No, we haven’t.”
, by now.”
That had been on the second night; they’d been on the road then, too. Williams had just turned twenty-one, was a cheerful sort of kid who’d been excited for the opportunity to be part of Harry’s team, though he’d got married only a few months prior — Aurors who worked under Harry had a tendency to advance quickly. Harry blows out a breath. “Yeah, I’m sure. We can’t use it.”
Gouged through in places by the nub of a quill, the letter Malfoy’s mother sent along with his allergy potions indicated that administering them would be the hardest part.
Harry clutches the cooling coin in his fist and shakes off his curiosity. There are too many answers to that, none of which he has the time to contemplate. The magic wrapped around the coin is too strong to be used in anything other than emergency, which has curtailed communication to only the most necessary. So it doesn’t really matter what Hermione needs Malfoy for, only that she thinks it’s important enough to endanger the spot Harry’s deemed safe enough to rest in for a couple of days before pushing on. That’s enough for him.
Draco pulls his knees up to his chest, ankles crossed. “Tell me about the Master of Death.”
“Even if it ruins everything,” he says.
it could be. Granted, he and Draco hadn’t precisely talked about, well, anything yet, but Harry considered it promising that the nerves Draco rubbed wrong could be so easily soothed by… this. Harry took off his glasses and slid to the floor.
“Haha.” Potter lifted a shoulder, let it drop. Like he truly thought Draco was joking. “Anyway, it won’t happen again.”
Weasley,” he said. Pansy’s hand flew to cover her mouth once more, and Draco strode off.
have very nice green eyes, for instance.”
“Another round of laps?” Malfoy asks after a minute, chest still lightly heaving. It’s more of a wheeze, really, or even a whisper, but that’s something they’ve both got in the habit of, speaking as though they’re sharing secrets. It fosters a weird sense of affinity between them, and Harry doesn’t like it, doesn’t like that the confidential tone of Malfoy’s voice, its huskiness, reminds him of things he’s heard from Hermione and Ron. He can’t allow himself to care more than he already does; he’ll be happy when there’s enough distance from the city to speak at conversational levels again.
Harry — the real, live Harry Potter, whom I’d very definitely shagged — lifted his head. His hair was a disaster, as though he’d been caught in an electricity-dampening spell, and he gave me a disgruntled scowl before fumbling his glasses on. His expression shifted to one of concern, something that might have bothered me, if I had any expectation of lasting through the next minute. As it was, I couldn’t really breathe or feel my face.

He didn’t give either of them a chance to respond before disappearing behind yet another door Harry hadn’t noticed. Zabini whistled and turned to Harry, an awkward pause suspended between them until he held out his hand. “I don’t think we’ve ever actually talked, though of course—”
Harry snatches his hands back in surprise, a surge of anger rolling through him. He shoves it away as Malfoy edges to the side, slanting him distrustful glances. Malfoy works his back along the cupboard to the corner and down the wall to the door, Harry slowly pivoting on his feet to watch his progress.
something Draco could blame on Pansy and Blaise: how slow he’d been on the uptake that not all friends were like them. Though they could (occasionally) be sort of wonderful when they weren’t busy being the very worst people alive, Draco knew quite well they were just as likely to spike his coffee with a diuretic as they were to bring him coffee at all.
not here. If you want to know if I’m lying, ask me.”
Kneeling between Draco’s spread legs, Harry studies the tension on his face before pressing a soft kiss to Draco’s clavicle. Draco starts, tenses. His head comes up, his eyes nearly black. Harry hears Draco’s finger sliding from his body, soft and wet, and Draco’s hand comes up, sliding damp around his nape to bring Harry to him. They kiss recklessly, open-mouthed and hot, and Harry reaches up to snag his fingers through Draco’s white-blond locks, to yank his head to the side. He presses his tongue in when Draco groans, a low, deep sound that rattles through Harry to his cock. Draco kisses him back, tongue rubbing against Harry’s, fingers gripping the back of his neck, and lifts a leg and wraps it around Harry’s thighs to pull him closer. Harry allows it for a moment just because it feels splendid, Draco’s long, leanly muscled calf pressing against the back of Harry’s thighs, but finally lifts Draco’s leg from around him, setting it down with a small shudder at the whimper Draco makes. He nips Draco’s bottom lip and draws away.

“Don’t insult my intelligence. I’m not stupid enough to believe you don’t have a set price already.”
” he barks, and imperiously shoves Harry’s head lower. “But, ah,” he says, breathless again when Harry laughs and drags his tongue over the skin just above his waistband, “not
“It’s fine,” Draco said evenly, turning back when Potter ran out of words. He willed the heat in his face to recede. “They got to us before either of us, uhm, well, you know.”

“And what about Kreacher?”
“Malfoy?” Potter nudges his knee. He looks perplexed, then concerned. “Aren’t you?”
“I would think them negligent if they were not.”
The sky was fully dark by the time Draco’s parents took their leave, and Harry’s amusement at Lucius’ accumulating rage over being thwarted had worn as thin as Lucius’ control over it.
“Only on a case,” Harry said.
es, and groaned,
,” Harry said, bucking impatiently against him. Draco wrapped his fist tighter and smirked, wanking him firmly once, twice, fingers curling over Harry’s sopping wet glans, a deadly serious tease. But on the third stroke, he clenched his fist around the crown of Harry’s cock, and Harry came hard, shocks of shivery tension rippling through each of his muscles and the world fading grey about him. When he opened his eyes, panting, he saw Draco’s chest was striped with his come, a few pale drops even on the underside of his chin. Draco looked as though he was trying not to smile — which only served to make him look more smug than he might have otherwise.
That was true enough. Harry had woken to the unforgiving tattoo of rain, a saturation of deafening white-noise and the scent of wet earth and decay when he opened his window to look outside. The Wireless service was spotty, only playing scratchy forties ballads that kept getting interrupted by cautionary weather updates:
Trying to.
“What is?” Harry asked, blank. If Malfoy took another step, maybe two, he’d be near enough to smell— to touch. Agitated, Harry turned around, walking deeper into Malfoy’s studio; he hadn’t come here with the intention of touching Malfoy, at least not in any of the ways his dick seemed eager for. That one had been so quickly and easily substituted for the other was… unsettling.
Harry met Ron’s exasperated gaze over the gleam of Draco’s hair, and gave him a feeble shrug. Ron sighed and stalked from the kitchen. Draco glanced up at Harry, blew the strands of his fringe off his forehead, then wordlessly guided Harry to sit with him at the table. He was concluding a diagnostic spell on damage to Harry’s hand when Ron returned with his bag, and nodded without looking over.
“Well, if we suppose it takes Weasley and the other Aurors ten minutes to show up and another fifteen for the department to take down anyone still in my flat…” Draco trails off significantly, and then the quality of his voice changes. He clears his throat. “And a day or two for for them to track someone down who might know how to get us out… We may be here awhile.”
Tension keeps them quiet for the morning, which stretches out before Harry, as seemingly endless as the road they’re following. His measure of time lately has narrowed to grids on his map, or that of a thundering heartbeat in moments of peril or pleasure, but now he can’t stop himself from looking at his watch every five minutes, three, two, because each second that passes feels like a second closer to Ron, to Hermione.
“Well, it’s considered polite, isn’t it?” Harry asked, then cleared the roughness from his throat. Skin warming deliciously under Draco’s direct, unyielding assessment, he said, “Aren’t you going to excuse us?”
socks and a
“Just tell him we’ll be right down,” Draco said smoothly. He turned to Harry as Kreacher Apparated away and swallowed hard, a wry huff of laughter gusting free. “Trust Longbottom to still know how to make things as awkward as possible, even with that face. Everyone else will be here soon, if they haven’t begun showing up already. You said informal, yes?.”
There were a thousand reasons. If Harry spent his lifetime counting them, he wouldn’t reach the end of the list.
“You want to see,” Draco says abruptly, voice lowering once more. “Don’t you, Harry?”
This is how it shouldn't happen.
Harry glances at him. Malfoy’s nose is pink, sweat turning his hair a delicate gold at the roots, and Harry realises that sometime during their journey the clouds have parted. He’s in the habit of relegating discomfort — from chill, from heat or exhaustion — to the back of his mind, the way he’s always done with Auror work, but he notices it now. Leather is particularly useful to protect the skin from the touch of Inferi, much better than cotton or even wool, but Malfoy’s got long sleeves under his jacket as well, and he looks both chalky and overheated, which isn’t good.
smile until Ron swallowed and took another sullen bite and fell into a stewing sort of silence, rather than resuming his tirade. Thinking it probably best to change the subject while he had the chance, Harry sat at the kitchen table and said, “I don’t suppose you read the paper last night?”
As if reading his mind, Malfoy said, “I didn’t ask for your help. I didn’t want it.” He looked sideways at Harry, lips twisting down into a sour little bow. “I never have.”
Stomach jittering, Harry looked to his own cup. Whether Harry didn’t know how to be polite to Malfoy, or simply hadn’t wanted to try, didn’t change the accuracy of Malfoy’s assessment. It was made all the more distressing by Malfoy’s matter-of-fact tone, and that, point made, he hadn’t belaboured it.
“Nope,” he said, infusing his voice with cheer he didn’t feel. A twinkle flashed in his periphery, hovering in place. He didn’t look at it. “Had to be today. Sorry about your arse, though.”
Harry blinks, startled. “How did you know what I was—?”
“I— He…” There’s a bit of static as Hermione trails off, as though she’s moving. Pacing, probably, and Harry can practically picture it, the quick clip of her strides, the nervous brushing-back of her hair. “We’re not sure, but there were, um, some papers indicating she… knows. Something. I negotiated a conversation in return for letting her talk to Malfoy—”
They went down together on the bed, Draco’s legs sliding straight against the mattress, Harry slumping half over him. He moved his fingers inside Draco — felt the massage of an aftershock, and kissed away Draco’s overstimulated hiss. His lips were soft, pliant. Chapped from Harry’s mouth, and his own habit of biting them.
Harry was saved from coming up with a reply to that by Goyle, who came out of a tiny, doorless room that appeared behind a mirror (and promptly vanished). He looked the same — thick-necked and hulking — but for the sunny yellow, sashed robes he wore, and the open warmth of his frankly beautiful smile when his gaze landed on Draco. “You wore it!” he said delightedly, coming closer to scoop Draco up in a hug. Harry stepped back, alarmed, but Draco seemed to accept it as due course, a faintly embarrassed expression crossing his face as he patted Goyle reluctantly on the back.
“If it did, would you trust me to tell you?”
“Fair point.” Harry snorted and twisted to check, feeling for holes in the denim. It was warm, but as far as he could tell, not damaged. “Anywhere safe to sit?”
Draco huffs, rising with a waspish flap of his hand for effect; he grabs his clothes and Harry’s wand before stalking into the loo. As of yesterday, Harry wasn’t willing, or perhaps able, to accept sympathy, so Draco was pleased to stumble across a set of tactics that seemed to work; needling Harry always has, to some extent. He uses the toilet — rank, yet endlessly preferable to pissing on the side of the road; having one has felt like such a luxury for the last three days, he almost wants to laugh — and then Harry’s wand to wash, mind caught on Harry’s smile as he dresses. Despite the peace Harry seemed to make with the circumstances last night, Draco finds it impressive that Harry can smile at all, though he supposes Harry’s always had the ability to put himself aside in favour of the bigger picture. His reputation is built on it.
“Fuck
“That’s not a problem for you?” Draco asks, looking confused and slightly disturbed. His gaze flicks over Harry’s face.
“Talking?” Draco demanded — viciously, all trace of his drawl gone. He pushed off the sofa and looked down at his nose at her. “You’ve barely let me get a word in edgewise for the last thirty minutes. In my
Without really talking about it, they walked the short distance from the cinema to Barnaby’s offices. After having been outed in the papers as Harry and Draco’s solicitor, his sleepy trade had begun to boom, but serendipity was on their side: he’d just had a cancellation. They watched in silence as he drew up the contracts, and once Draco signed, he Flooed to the flat near his shop with a promise to come home the following day. It as two-thirty in the afternoon.
“Yes. Yeah. We can—”  It comes from a younger Unspeakable that Hermione thinks is partnered with the older fellow on spell design. Hermione wonders if he’s friends with Malfoy; he doesn’t look much older than she is. He glances at her and does a double-take, blinks a little in the face of her glare. Lowering his head once more, he finishes making a note on his parchment with a quill, then looks up at her with a cautious smile. “We’ll make sure to do that.”
“Yes, I know.”
Harry’s eyes are dark. He gives Draco an approving smile, moves back as far as he can in their tight quarters, and lifts the collar of his t-shirt to wipe away the trail of sweat working its way down his temple. “That was perfect,” he says, a little breathless. “Switch.”
“I thought there should be a better record of that,” Draco said. “You as his chosen heir.”
“Brilliant,” Harry said, pulling a face. “I was really hoping that’d take off.”
“Still,” Malfoy says, sniffing. “There were more suitable volunteers to take care of Edward, if she needed—”
“Fine, yeah. I don’t care.” Harry balled up his hands over the dangerous twitch of arousal in his lap, hoping it wouldn’t turn into anything more. Furious that it was anything at all. He kept his eyes on the blue-grey sky. “Here, though. Not—” he swallowed, “—my room. Or yours.”
“Why a calculator?” Harry asked, squinting.
“Slytherin!”
He just can’t…”
Draco inhaled, hard and fast. He lifted his drink to his lips and took a sip, glancing around, and said, “Five minutes.” Then he pasted on a bland smile that did absolutely nothing to disguise the blaze in his cheeks or keen glitter of his eyes, pressed his half-full drink into Harry’s hand, and stalked off, robes whipping about his calves in his haste.
Harry’s cock jerks. He sits on the bed as Malfoy’s owl hops onto the guest perch, shaking water from its creamy-brown feathers before consuming the breaded grasshopper Harry gave it. He touches Malfoy’s strong, elegant lettering and shudders at the way it seems to stroke the pads of his fingers. He Summons his own parchment and quill and writes,
“Trust me,” Potter says, so grimly Draco has no choice but to pay attention. He sighs, his pack settling with the soft crunch of fallen leaves when he sets it down.
The fact that this time it had actually been

, distracting, a break in the spell between them.
She scurried away, and Harry brought the glaze-streaked spoon up to his mouth.
Yet... they were both half-hard, and getting harder. Harry blinked, the haze of bloodlust not quite receding but, but—
— bending Draco’s body to his will, turning Draco into a wreck of shivering limbs, and coaxes Draco’s cock stiff again with his mouth, his hands. He presses Draco back, pushes inside him, and fucks him slow, a reiteration of his feelings, so long the only way Draco could accept them outright. But this time Harry does it with a chant falling from his lips to Draco’s, a swirl of breath in the space between their kisses:
. Someone who
that Rose acquired for her. Yet she finds herself staring sightlessly at the words for several minutes as she works out the implications of Granger’s abrupt departure.
“My—”
Draco worked the knot from side to side until it hung as loosely as Potter’s.
Diverted from the horizon, Harry watches their fingers twine together. In a bid to forget the feel of them working him over, Harry hasn’t let himself look at Draco's hands much lately, but the look of them is remarkably familiar, all creamy skin and long, slightly knobby fingers. They're hands that are absurdly suited to their owner: fine-boned but deceptively strong, toughened spots hidden on the inside of his grip. Harry’s hand doesn’t look quite right with it in comparison, tanned despite the near-constant covering of his glove, his knuckles still swollen and torn bloody. But despite the visual contrast, Draco’s calluses are rubbing against the few soft, sensitive spots on Harry’s palm, and vice versa, and the clasp...
“No rabbit?”
“I don’t
Harry huffs a snort at the Weasley bit, giving him a sidelong glance as if to say Draco might want to watch his step. Draco shrugs without apology, because it’s not untrue; Weasley homes have always seemed to have a slight wobble to them, however well-fortified with magic they might be.
, Potter, these balconies are only about five metres apart.” He scoffs it, but strides to the balcony to get the broom.
“I—” Draco shakes his head, then huffs out a sardonic laugh. “I think I broke my hand on your bloody chin.”
“Wh—” Harry started to turn, but Draco was already spreading him open. Pushing his face in. Lapping along the crevice of Harry’s arse with long, unadorned stripes, practically dismissive but for the vibration of his purr against Harry and the savage skill he used to dart the tip of his tongue into Harry’s hole with each pass. Harry’s ankles twisted with the eager attempt to widen his stance; his head fell forward with a
He’d assumed he would have the freedom to make choices, eventually.
The word woke Harry out of a sound sleep — heart still thudding slow and even, Draco’s quiet snore ruffling his hair. Harry opened his eyes unrealistically wide in the dark and remembered Draco’s gift. He disentangled himself from the heavy cling of Draco’s limbs and lit a subtle
“Looked at you?” Harry squints at the road ahead, a grim note coming into his voice. “Yeah. I noticed.”
“Aren’t
Draco snorts and notes the way Harry’s eyes stray again to his watch. “Is it time?”
Hesitantly, Kreacher edged closer, still tilting Harry those wary looks. Grip tightening around his fork, Harry forced a reassuring smile. He watched as Kreacher snapped his fingers and a setting appeared in front of Malfoy: gold-and-white china that matched Harry’s, and shining golden cutlery, far in excess of what Malfoy could conceivably need to eat. Kreacher snapped his fingers again and produced a heavy-looking decanter, half-filled with a shimmery pink liquid. He unstoppered it, a fine, sweet-smelling mist lacing out, then fading. He filled Malfoy’s goblet and stepped back from the table. “Kreacher will be bringing Master— Malfoy’s dinner very quickly, sir, yes,” he muttered, his hunched posture smoothing. His huge, dulled eyes seemed to brighten briefly, and then he nodded and Disapparated, a dusty
On Friday, the hair rises on your arms. On the back of your neck. Through layers of Scent Warding, you can feel it, smell it. Him. You were humming along with the latest Celestina Warbeck, and your voice breaks into a soft whine. Your quill snaps from the pressure of your fingers, your prick stiffening so quickly it aches.
“Well.” Malfoy lowers gingerly onto the ground and crosses his legs. “She was alone. Don’t they… gravitate toward each other?”
Draco sat, seemed to think better of it, and stood back up. Swallowed, glancing at Harry’s knotted hands. He began to remove his clothing with quiet efficiency, bending at the waist to release the buckle on the side of each boot, then drawing them off, and his high, stocking-like socks after them. Straightening, he reached over his shoulder to fist a hand in the back of his shirt.
“I could Apparate home and grab the camera I bought so we could find out,” Harry offered, meaning it. Draco shut his eyes, a hot, tempted look on his face, and Harry said, “But I’m not suggesting my office.”
“I’ll be fine,” Harry says through his teeth. “I’ve had one before.”
“What?” Harry asked, then stopped because Malfoy meant—
“S’probably why his business is failing,” Ron said. “No one is going to trust a Malfoy to clean out magical static without taking advantage, it’s a pretty vulnerable position to be in. Although,” he added musingly, “if I’m right, the Dark magic repellents lining his table wouldn’t let him.”
They finish their meal in silence, Draco’s mind whirring with possibilities — most of them previously discarded. Harry’s expectation that Draco might determine what Granger’s message meant aligns with his own, and he finds it maddening that he hasn’t been able to. They’ve discussed it ad nauseum, throwing ideas back and forth, to no avail beyond avoiding the things they can’t talk about outside the tent.
There exists a delicate equilibrium in any successful negotiation. Offering too much or settling for too little can upset that balance, but not nearly as much as letting your opponent leave before you’re ready for them to — and particularly not before you’ve revealed the gauntlet swinging above their head.
It takes him a few moments to force himself to study Parkinson —
Draco stared into the box for a long time. Then he lifted the ring out and rolled it between his thumb and two fingers, examining it — wordless, unreadable. At length, Harry couldn’t take it any longer. “It’s a—”
, he’d said.
This sort of happiness is not one you ever thought you'd find.
“Would you like me to do it now?” Draco asks, finally as breathless as Harry feels, as rough and uneven. “Do you want to put your cock down my throat? Want to feel me swallow around it when you come?”
“Don’t be too hard on Hermione,” Ron said quietly, joining him. “She’s been… She kept looking, for you. Every spare second, Harry. You asked her to, and so she did. It’s been— And I know it was worse for you, however it is now. I’m not stupid. But she’s driven herself half into the grave trying to figure out a solution. Almost six months of, ‘I need another two minutes to check something,’ turning into four more hours before she slept, and, ‘Harry’s trying his best to get along with Draco, the least we can do is make it easier on him,’ and ‘I promised him, we don’t let each other down.’ She was—” Ron paused. “She was hit harder than anyone from the initial drain, maybe because she’s Muggle-born. Had to recover in Mungo’s. And then she was the first one to feel the symptoms of… noncompliance. And she didn’t tell me. Another week in Mungo’s, when I—” his voice cracked, “—found her on the floor of our flat. She made me promise not to say.”

“My office,” Hermione says, just in case a student wanders up. She hesitates, wondering if she should invite Anthony to follow, but he — thankfully — takes the decision out of her hands by giving her a small parting smile and walking in the opposite direction.
“Not all night.” Harry smirked, glancing pointedly at the rug between them.
And the anticipation didn’t prepare him for when it did. Harry felt the pulse of it when Malfoy started to come, in his hand and around his own cock, an undulating ripple that tore Harry’s orgasm from him too. Humid gasps passed back and forth from their mouths with the tenor of sobs, and pleasure rocketed down Harry’s spine, pulling his balls painfully tight. He squeezed his eyes shut, Malfoy’s arse coaxing his cock of each drop as he spilled over Harry’s swiftly-moving hand. Harry didn’t notice when Malfoy pulled his mouth away, his entire body flooded with sensation, his mind blissfully blank. Moving with tiny, instinctive jerks, Harry rode it out until the last twinge had faded, not yet ready to face the rest — how brilliant it felt, or how terrible it was, that something so empty could be so, so good.
“I heard it.” Harry nodded to Draco’s left hand, curled into a loose fist. “And I saw what you didn’t say,” he said. Draco sucked a whistle of air in through his teeth. “We should t—”
Draco shook his head. Harry put the other drink down and turned back to pluck at Draco’s tie, slipping it free from his waistcoat; he curled it around his hand — once, twice — and scooted closer. Closer still, when that wasn’t enough, crowding Draco into his sofa cushions. Stretching out half on top of him, pushing into his space. Draco’s breath sped up, and he gifted Harry with a shift of his leg that set Harry in the cradle between his long, trousered thighs. Harry could feel the hard length of Draco’s prick nudging his hip. Mouths nearly touching, Harry met Draco’s eyes, swallowed, and said, “I’ve got too many ideas and zero experience.”
“If you’re not going to send it in, Owl it back to me,” Malfoy mutters. “I’ll have it published by morning.”
He tugs on his boots and turns to organising what little he's managed to stockpile. He keeps anything he takes out spread on a small table next to the sofa, right over the lip of the bag resting below it, positioned for a quick scoop-and-run. He has to, especially since his findings are so meagre: some food and a couple of lighters, a matchbook, a map. A knife. He's still got some Auror-issued beads that can muffle the magic of low-grade spells, and all but one of those goes into the bag as well; he doesn't want to tempt himself to use them when it's not truly necessary. He pilfered some batteries from the remote control of the empty flat he’s up taken residence in, and though the remote flashed ‘low battery’ when he tested it, he has a feeling they’ll come in handy, so they go into his pocket with his last bead. He knows he won't be back even if this turns out to be a fool’s errand. Fortunately, the Five Seasons is less than a mile from where he's holed up, right across from the Seine, and there's still well over an hour before sundown — if he leaves now, he has a chance of making it before he's spotted and has to run.
He closed his eyes and focused on the sensation of Potter’s fingers. “Just… fuck. Keep doing that.”
approached him in the corridors of Hogwarts, if he’d been bold enough to make such a declaration in front of everyone. Wondering, he smoothed the parchment flat and wrote a message on one side:
on the door. It’s a strong enough spell to distract them should they wander by, but not so potent as to lure them out from wherever they seem to hide during the day. He doesn't bother closing the door behind him, and starts walking.
"Mm. I couldn't agree more." Draco's eyes ran over Harry's body heatedly, like a brand. "But there's still the little problem of...?"
Harry thought,
” he suggests. Potter hesitates and Draco says, “
“At least you won’t die from exhaustion or malnutrition.” Ron said it cheerfully enough, but concern furrowed his forehead. “So how long are you taking? A few days? A week?”
“If I had, would my daughter be alive right now?” Granger says.
“And he sent the solicitor away. And the way he’s been talking—” Hermione’s voice was muffled into his chest.
” Potter hisses. “Get back.
It felt good to say, a relief of such weight it made Harry wonder just how long he’d been feeling that way, but had been too focused on his goals to let himself think about it.
“I’m not a problem,” Harry said, pulling a wounded face at Hermione.
Malfoy looks at him and suddenly stumbles. He halts in place, blinking rapidly and muttering a curse under his breath, then shakes his head and huffs a light laugh. “She had them waiting when I woke up.”
“Here’s Narcissa.” Hermione pauses, then says, fiercely, “Take
“Yeah. Except,” Harry sighed, “I’d get to pick my own cases and supervise the rest. Train incoming Aurors.

“Yeah,” Potter said breathlessly — and froze. Draco opened his eyes to see Potter’s face when he came, but… Potter
“It’s
“Jesus.”
“Mummy?”
“No, I wasn’t thinking— of—” Harry exhaled, shaking his head at the automatic defence that rose.
“When did you?”
The insult flowed through Harry, sharp as Firewhiskey, and he found himself grinning. Malfoy’s scorn jumped about in his mind in the exact way necessary to help him come to a decision, a long-buried sense of excitement burrowing up to the surface. “Tell me, Malfoy,” he said, “what’s the most cordial way to say ‘fuck off’?”
Shuffling movement and more voices, some of them yelling over each other. Draco’s wandtip skittered, warm and friendly, against Harry’s temple and then down the line of his chest before fading. A Numbing spell, Harry thought, and tried to tell Draco he didn’t need one — everything was already pretty numb, rather cosy and warm, actually — but couldn’t make his mouth work. Then the press of lips warmed the shell of his ear, and Draco spoke again, low and tight: “Please.
“Having fun back there?” Draco asked, low. He set his cheek back to the pillow.
“I won’t!” Harry shouted, following close on his heels. Malfoy huffed a taunting laugh and wrenched the door open. The cool air hit Harry’s hot cheeks and Harry was sure he meant to grab the door, to slam it shut behind Malfoy — he was
“It wasn’t
Draco went harder at him, bollocks so tight they weren’t even making that soft, damp slap against Potter’s arse anymore on each thrust. He whipped his hips, twisting them with each push in and Potter’s fingers tightened on his back, on his arse cheek. Their lips met in the middle with clumsy, gasping kisses, and Potter’s thighs pulled in, growing taut like they did when he was about to come, his knees knocking against Draco’s ribs. And just as Draco was sure he was going to lose control, Potter cried out in a low, uneven voice. His cock throbbed between the slide of their stomachs and his arse clamped down around Draco’s cock with long, pulsing spasms. Draco turned his face to press his cheek to Potter’s shoulder, hot against hot, goosebumps rising on his skin as he juddered his hips to chase down his orgasm. He pushed his cock as deep as he could and came too, mouth on the silk around Potter’s neck to muffle his groan, pleasure spiking down through his body to his toes.
“Alright, and?” Malfoy’s frown deepens. “Potter, are you aware that you look positively mad right now?”
Bewildered, Harry re-buckled his belt and followed him, the tension in his body a reminder of what he’d just turned down. Draco went to the end of the corridor and turned down one of the new corners rather than heading up to the next level. He opened the third door on the left, the eighteenth-century tea parlour Harry had only ever been in to add to the House map.
“No!” Malfoy shook his head quickly. Kept shaking it, blond hair tossing about his head. “I didn’t say— I said, ‘you have a ring.’”
“Not— Not really, I suppose,” she admits. Then, in a blurt, “How is it so easy for you?”
Draco released his wrist, chest rising and falling fast against Harry’s. He tried to pull away the hand held to Harry’s cheek, but Harry tightened his hold. Eyes still closed for fear they might overflow, Harry turned his face and kissed Draco’s palm.
. He’s not
“And of course, if you need, I can find a way to take on your surplus, move some of my own cases around — between us,” Robards said with a reassuring nod. But his moustache shifted again for a beat. “The Wizengamot won’t ever hear that— Well.”
One corner of Malfoy’s mouth ticked up. “Humility is for people who don’t know their own—” His smile faded. “Who don't know when they’re right,” he finished, subdued.

, that left Harry feeling scoured from the inside out.
“You said you didn’t want anyone to do that shit,” Draco said. “When Pansy—”
As though Harry knew what that was, anymore. “Planning for your own future with Theo?” he asked, voice rough. Draco had loosened the laces of his collar again, and it was only Wednesday, but Harry wanted to—
“Greg,” Draco snapped.
“Ideally more often, then,” Draco said. “And activity?”
like that. His face flooded with heat and he fumbled his tumbler back onto the table, wondering what it said about him that it had never even occurred to him to
He covers Potter’s tight grip with his own. Potter nods and exhales. His cheek is damp with tears, though whether they’re from the deepthroating he just took or whatever's going through his mind, Draco can’t tell. But he releases himself, bringing up his hand to rest on Draco’s bare hip, and Draco winds his fingers around the thick length of Potter’s cock, matching the same pressure Potter was using, and starts jerking him. Potter’s hips twitch helplessly, and Draco increases the pace, gliding Potter’s foreskin down over the sopping wet head of his prick, twisting his grip when he drags it back. Draco’s softening cock jerks in response to the sounds Potter makes, hungry, broken little groans, Draco’s own name muttered in a rough voice. He wants to go down on Potter, wants to suck him off, to taste him, but he’s afraid the awkward transition of their position in the tight space of the tent might break the spell that allows them to focus only on each other, so he echoes the bite Potter left on his jaw and cups Potter’s balls with his free hand, squeezing them in a gentle roll as he moves his hand over Potter’s cock.
“Good.” It was an understatement; Harry’s blood was practically singing through his veins, his body energised with a rush of chaotic feel-good endorphins. But there was no real way to express that without sounding like a wanker. “Good. Yeah. That was impressive.”
It takes him a few precious minutes to rearrange what he's already got in his pack, but when he's finally done and everything's in, the weight of it feels like a weight being
A stack of books on the bedside stand.

you, fuck,
“Good Merlin,” Draco said. He gave a strained laugh, his hand landing low on Harry’s belly — though not low enough. His fingers paused there, curled just a little into Harry’s robes before exerting pressure. Pushing him back. “And how would it look if we abandon the benefit to fuck over your desk on our first date?”
He tried not to think about what did. For the most part, he was successful.
Draco's Dark Mark had faded to a few shades darker than his skin over the years. Harry took it in, the blurry lines shaping the coil of the snake, the skull he could see a little if he squinted. He hadn’t applied much thought to it in years, not as anything other than something Draco was ashamed of having, or that Harry might need to defend him over; hadn’t wanted to, maybe.
“Sure,” Ron said. He grimaced at Harry, then looked at her and said, somewhat apologetically, “But in a servant’s capacity. It’s his home as long as there’s an owner to serve, and if the owner doesn’t give a toss about it, nothing he says or does is going to be enough.” He pointed to a painting on the wall that depicted a band of centaurs running together through a field at night. “Didn’t this used to feature the bloody aftermath of a centaur war?”
“You like that,” Harry counters. “And I’m not the only one who does it.”
Annoyed, Draco glares at him for being right. “It would break them.”
— the right to utilise what gifts they’ve been given, their passions, as long as they’re not hurting anyone else. No matter who they are!
“Ron told me a story once,” Harry says. Apparently he gets talkative when he’s all shagged out, even on the verge of sleep. Draco’s never had cause to stick around and find out, sure that if he stayed too long, Harry would figure out sooner than later exactly why they shouldn’t be doing what they were. Harry props his chin on Draco’s shoulder and looks at him; Draco forces himself not to look away. It’s uncomfortable, this profound sense of peace, of… potential. He’s not sure he believes it enough for the risk he’s taken.
“What d’you suggest?” Harry asked, eyeing her. “Forks and fashion don’t interest me, I’m rubbish at small talk, and I don’t think
“Oh,” Draco said dumbly, looking down and wondering if there was a way to get less naked without looking as if that was his goal. “You meant to actually talk.” He resolved the matter by marching to Potter’s bed and sliding in it — he hadn’t slept in it, after all, and the sheets were clean and warm. He pulled the blankets up to his waist and folded his arms over his bare chest. “Continue.”
“Can—?
“I’m waiting,” Harry said.
Draco gasped. “
“I only saw the first two,” Draco says as if they’re talking about where to get takeaway from. He rubs distractedly at his forehead. “My wand was…?”
Harry fishes them from the pocket of his bag and hands them over. The sunglasses have reflective lenses, and he hides a frown when Malfoy slips them onto the bridge of his nose; Malfoy’s eyes are unusually expressive, and Harry wants to know what he’s thinking.
The general public didn’t know about the contract yet. There’d been some conjecture on Harry’s disappearance — which Ron and Hermione had handled by dropping the name of a random country anytime they were asked — and none at all on Draco’s, who everyone had assumed, or hoped, would disappear as soon as he was given the chance.
Argue directly with the Wizengamot over the budget we’re alloted and hire new staff. I might even be able to take some of the holiday time I’ve accrued. And the only thing that’s stopping me is—”
Just one of the many reasons Harry so despised Grimmauld place; he’d never wanted to live in it again.
“Harry,” Draco said. His eyes were on Harry’s face, his lips pulled up to one side. He swivelled his hips again. “Drawer.”
” Malfoy said, nettled. The look he slanted at Harry was equal parts cagey and defiant. “And it’s none of your business what I do with my things.”
But you had me working a hundred hours a week without complaint,” he said, grateful his voice wasn’t shaking. “You had me thinking,” he huffed a pained laugh, “I was less than I am.”
Potter squeezes the side of his neck, just once, before backing up a few steps and looking down at his bare hand. He flexes it, balls it into a fist, and Draco notices the whitening of a faint scar pulling tight. Potter glances at him. “I cast
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Harry says on a rush of air. Draco takes a step back, complexion bleeding of the heightened colour it gained while they danced, his expression stony and unforgiving. Harry catches his elbow. “I meant—”
“Malfoy—”
“It’s me. My conduct outside of work isn’t ‘befitting a senior Ministry position,’” he quoted, sounding sullen to his own ears. “The way I talk to the press, or the way I avoid them. Maybe both. The Head Auror is responsible for releasing public statements, and you know me.”

“Yeah, but…” Harry removed his glasses again and dug a knuckle against his eye, where the headache was starting to form. “Yeah. You’re right. He’s just been hard to pin down for awhile. And he voted against an increase in our budget—”
“A Floo call with my mother. Dinner in the Great Hall,” Draco said carelessly. He took a deep breath and lowered his voice. “But those aren’t the plans I’ve been thinking about all day.”
to hurt me,
Harry cracks a brutal laugh. He turns and winds his arm back. Releases it. The mobile crashes against the wall with a spray of plastic splinters and Harry whips back around and cuffs hard fingers around Draco's wrists. Unprepared and stiff with shock, Draco stumbles as Harry drives him backwards, gives a grunt of protest when his hips bang into the edge of the desk and Harry presses tight against him. His breath is hot on Draco’s face and his eyes are glittering with terrifying menace, but the overwhelming throb of pain he’s broadcasting tells a different story.
“Jesus, what’s crawled up your arse?” Potter dug into his bag and pulled out a bottle of pumpkin juice.
Harder to ignore was the note slipped under the door on Saturday evening like a whisper, after another round of knocking. He considered burning it, tried not paying it any mind, but the folded scrap of parchment just sat there on the floor, accusingly, until it eventually made its way into his hand.
“We don’t,” Draco said flatly. The head of his cock was already aching, caught flat between them. He curled his fingers around Potter’s hip and guided him in a faster rock, closing his eyes and tilting his head back. The admission slipped out of him, softly: “That feels too good.”
Draco flashed him a look, then turned back to the clock. “It’s been a long few years,” he said, as though that explained everything. Maybe it did.
When she faces Granger again, Granger is sipping from her tea, her gaze watchful, and the extra cup has been turned over. Narcissa moves to take the seat opposite her. Her own tea has been appropriately strained, her cup filled to three-quarters, and not a drop has been spilled on her saucer. An admonishment for Narcissa’s assumption she’d make a mistake, perhaps — silent, but pointed. Amused, Narcissa grants her a small smile to concede as she begins adding the amount of milk and sugar she prefers, but Granger doesn’t respond with so much as a flicker of expression.
Potter removes his hand and brings up a wet cloth, squeezing out the excess water into a bin sitting beside him. “I thought if you weren’t covered in—” With a hard exhale, he begins (resumes?) washing caked blood off of Draco’s chest. The water is lukewarm, and smells of Draco’s lemongrass soap. “Maybe I should have woken you, but I didn’t know how long it’s been since you’ve slept. You looked like you needed it.”
And, fuck, Potter’s ‘little bit’ felt like quite a lot. Draco’s rim stretched until the flare of Potter’s cockhead popped in, and there Potter stayed, breath laboured. Draco felt Potter’s hand flex around his cock, and then Potter wound his fist around Draco’s. He gave it a long, slow pull.
The knob turned.
After the club, Harry didn’t know how to stop. The world narrowed to every invective they’d thrown at each other once upon a time, and the matches they’d flown, when beating one another had been as worthy a goal as simply winning, and as big a reason to. He thought of the way Draco’d hurled himself into the fight on the Quidditch pitch when they were young, fists flying even as he was besieged by livid Gryffindors, a snarl tearing from his throat and only Harry’s name on his lips. He thought of the sharp, malicious gleam in Draco’s eyes when he’d stomped on Harry’s face, Draco’s triumph and satisfaction.
“Brilliant." Hermione hesitates when he doesn't immediately respond, nor make to leave. It feels oddly similar to that moment of near-escape in her morning meetings, so she decides to go with it. "Um. Was there something else?"
But for some reason you can’t say it, and Harry doesn't.
He woke up groggy and found Luna curled next to him, softly singing an off-key lullaby about a travelling wizard finding his true love. She smiled at seeing him awake and drifted a hand to his hair, stroking through it, scritching at his scalp as though Harry were a housepet in need of soothing. Harry let himself drift through to the end of the song.
But his eyes kept catching on number four:
have been stupid enough to fill them out.” He Summoned the Snitch and stroked over its wings, still fluttering a fast tickle against his fingertips. “Oh, Merlin. Wouldn’t it be funny if it was an exercise in humiliation and Potter filled one out? I’d like to see that form on the Common Room board. ‘Fears: Now that the Dark Lord is gone, I am afraid of my glasses breaking… Because the only spell I know is
“That’s rather ironic, coming from you,” she said, thunking a heavy bookbag onto the reception desk. “Considering the company you keep — and the fact that, of the two of us, he belongs with me.”
“There was a lot of smoke,” Harry says mildly, but gives himself away with a guilty wince when Draco brings his fingers to his nose to check the scent of the soot. “Caused by a few flying curses. We were out in under fifteen minutes.”
“You can change your mind if you want,” he said, flooding Harry’s system once more with all of the bitter resentment he’d just distracted Harry from feeling.
Malfoy’s jaw flexes, somehow turning his face even pointier. Colour rests high in his cheekbones. “This is a bad fucking idea, Potter.” But he says it in warning, rather than refusal. His voice is hoarse. “Do you have any idea what you’re doing?”
, Ron’s voice comes, exasperated.
“If you do, you wouldn’t have any authority left,” she says.
“Why in hell didn’t you—?” Potter sounds livid, but doesn’t finish his question. Draco drags his gaze away from the body, stomach roiling. The sun is starting to set in earnest.
“Oh,” she said, the word soft and smothered. She gave another cough, took another drink of water. “Oh.”
“The magic herein shall call upon only descendants who have been: Birthed of magical parantege, and are: Favoured with vigorous, complementary magics of their own,” his intonation capitalising significant words somehow, “and whose: Ages are complementary to one another, whose: Bodies shall each be fertile and in superior physical condition. Their compatibility for marital relations should require: Neither of them to suffer unduly, as claused by the mutual admiration betwixt them. They: Neither shall have children from prior relations, nor: Be committed to marriage with anyone else, in Word or through promissory contract.”
Harry clears his throat. Gives him a clipped nod. “Bill Weasley. Most of my friends in the DMLE, apparently.” A muscle jumps in his jaw. “Ginny.”
, but
, Draco gasped, biting Harry on the back of the neck as he’d pounded into him from behind.
, P—’”
Scoffing a laugh, Harry relaxes. He rubs his knuckles against his jaw and slants Draco an olive-branch smile. “What did you — potentially, significantly — realise?”
“What’s your point?” Draco asked, shifting a little when Harry started on his chest. Snidely, he continued, “That no one will ever measure up to Saint Potter’s standards?”
“I love bread pudding,” Rose says. She glances around and finds Narcissa’s napkin, using it to wipe down the clean fork Narcissa hands her, before placing the napkin in her lap. Narcissa raises her eyebrows, impressed. She’s perhaps given Granger too little credit.
” Harry’s voice cracked with the admission, a single syllable halved in the middle. His chest aching from it, and from the expression that rippled across Draco’s features.
Harry drew off with a small cough, eyes watering, and leaned back, hand moving with swift tight pulls over his own cock.
“I’m not going to put you off,” Draco said, a host of unsaid things behind it. Harry wanted to ask, to press, but as the steam rose misty between them, Draco’s expression flickered, proud and vulnerable at once, and Harry found he couldn’t make himself say anything. Draco bit his lower lip, guiding Harry’s face away once more with one hand. He squeezed the flannel against Harry’s nape, a sluice of warm water and bubbles down to the crack of his arse, and put his mouth back to Harry’s ear. “I’m not going to hold myself back any longer, either.”
“They are aware, Headmistress,” Minerva interjects, startling her. Her expression is mild, but there’s a soft edge of rebuke to her tone as she says, “Their knowledge of their magical abilities and limits probably far exceeds ours, about our own.” Hermione flushes; they’ve discussed her tendency to treat elves like children on more than one occasion. But then Minerva sighs, and rests her elbow on the table, pressing two fingers against her temple. “However, I cannot see any harm in clearly outlining the hazards for each new elf that takes on the task.”
“I should be tired, shouldn’t I?” he said after dinner — his only half-finished because he couldn’t stop thinking about Draco’s feet. He
Harry heard a sound near the door to his loo and looked there. Wryly, he said, “I’ve done most of them.”
He escorted Harry to an entirely different room than Blaise had brought him to before, to Harry's initial relief. Rather than a large closet of sorts filled with clothing hung in rows, bits of parchment Spell-o-Taped to their collars or sleeves, Harry saw a more standard tailoring chamber. A raised pedestal sat in the middle of the room; mirrors on each wall cast a series of infinite reflections. Where there was space, multi-coloured swatches of fabric gleamed in the abundant light, draped expectantly over hangers affixed to the bare spaces on the walls and fluttering as if waiting for the opportunity to be used — exotic burnt oranges and shades of turquoise Harry’d only seen in pictures of Grecian seas, reds so rich and liquid they looked like they belonged in a wine glass, and greens that made Harry itch to feel the grass of a Quidditch pitch under his bare feet.
are you here?”
“If we’d gone back right away, they could have still been in my flat,” he mutters.
