Harry opened his eyes on the last strum of his guitar and saw everybody staring at him wide eyed, and also almost everyone had come out of their dorm rooms to see who was singing. Harry blinked, then smiled. "I'm sorry, did I wake you up?" He asked the eighth years wearing pyjamas.
As he was heading up the stairs, Uncle Vernon was coming down and thought it would be funny to trip Harry up, causing him to smash his head on the banister. Vernon laughed and carried on his way, whilst Harry went upstairs and got his wand. He decided to cast a glamour on himself, he didn't want whoever sent the note to freak out and run away.
One sleepless night was followed by another, then another, until Harry couldn't physically do anything. It's not like the Dursley's helped. They just made him work and would only let him drink, no eating as Vernon had promised. On Harry's 5th night at Privet Drive he finally managed to sleep, but woke up soon, sweat running down his forehead after the first nightmare he would have out of hundreds.
"Alright my little monkey, come down now!" Draco called, chuckling. Harry climbed down the tree but then almost immediately found another one and started running up to it. The top of the tree was in the makeshift blue sky of the room and when Harry looked down, all he could see was a tiny spec that was his boyfriend.
"Answer me Harry, why!" Hermione pushed. "Why else do you expect! I was living with the Dursley's, not one letter from anyone, who did I have to talk to! Dudley? Yeah, because while I'm doing the work around the house, I'm just going to ask 'oh, hey Duddykins, how was your day?' NOT ONE LETTER." Harry shouted, letting it all out.
"He's still a bit drunk. Mostly woozy hangover though," Draco chuckled. Hermione came in, sauntering towards them and rubbing her temples. "I have the worst hangover!" She groaned, plopping down.
Watching you grow up, at first I definitely saw your mother in you. But, then you went to school and broke probably more rules than I did!" James laughed and Harry chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Flying a car to Hogwarts though..." James paused and Harry gulped. Was he about to be told off by his dad for the first time? "Brilliant! Bloody brilliant! I wish I had thought of that in my day!" James grinned and Harry gaped stupidly.

"Na ah! Everyone needs to know you belong to me. Or, at least, that you aren't available to anybody else!" He smirked. "You know you can't tell anybody about who actually gave you those. You'd out us all and you know the laws." Seamus said seriously.
"Really says something when your childhood enemy understands you more than your best friend." Harry sniffed and watched Hermione walk out after Ron. "Are you okay Harry?" Malfoy asked. "What do you bloody think." He snapped, getting up and storming over to his bed. Harry got under the covers, rolled over so he wasn't facing Malfoy's bed and went to sleep.
"Oh this poor, poor boy! It's going to take him a while to get back up and running," Madame Pomfrey frowned, putting her hand to Harry's forehead. "He has nightmares too. Herm- Granger, said that it's this thing called PTSD. He gets memories and flashbacks from the war." Draco added.
"You do? Seamus growled. "You didn't even finish your third bottle! How do you think I feel? Harry's still a bit drunk for fucks sake!" Draco had started putting some bacon on Harry's plate, when Harry stopped him. "Come on Harry, you know you need to eat," he whispered. "I'm... Uh.... Going vegan." Harry muttered. Draco rolled his eyes and put some toast on his plate instead, but keeping the bacon to the side.
Harry made his way over to the largest pumpkin where he and Draco had planned to meet. But, when he got there, he saw nobody behind it. He looked around, but couldn't see purple hair anywhere. Harry sat down on the floor, blue hair flopping over his eyes and watched others dance.
"It was a stag, Draco. I don't know what it means, but I know it means something, so I have to ask you, just this one thing," Harry took a deep breath in and stared into those grey eyes he had always loved to look in. "Will you be my boyfriend... Officially?" Harry spoke, holding that breath and awaiting his answer. Then, Draco started to laugh.
"Oh, emerald," Draco smiled and squeezed his dark haired boyfriend into a hug. "I'm so happy to be with you. You're all I need in this life and the next." The two boys said no more but understood perfectly what the other was trying to say.
"Draco? Can one boy kiss another boy?" Harry asked. "Yeah, it's called being gay, duh!" Draco laughed, but stopped when he saw the confusion on Harry's face. "Don't tell me that Golden Boy Potter has never heard of someone being gay? Well, it's when one boy falls in love, dates, kisses or anything like that, another boy. Why do you ask?" He asked, looking at the raven haired boy curiously.
"So what if I was gay?" Harry announced. "What are you going to do, lock me up? How would that help anybody?" He said snarkily. "It would keep them safe from your curse!" Fudge snapped, stepping back as if Harry were contagious. "Being gay isn't a disease! It isn't a choice or a life style, it's who a person is and they don't control that! Nothing else to it. Your idea of gay people is that one touch, then you are suddenly going to be irresistibly in love with a person of the same gender? Minister, you and I have shaken hands many times before, tell me do you feel yourself lured to men, do you find them attractive in the way you believe you should not?"
"Since before we came to school. Severus used to come and hide here from the bullies, showed me the spot when I complained about not having anywhere remotely private to do my study and thinking," Draco explained. "He never told me the names of the bullies but I said that if I ever found out who they were then I would beat them to the ground!" Draco chuckled, but Harry gulped.
"Wait, what? How do you know who it is?" Harry asked suspiciously. "I may or may have seen you kiss in the infirmary. But the encanta bond, Harry! Really?" Harry tapped his wand to his wrist, revealing the heart and then showed it to Sirius.
"Hey, don't cry. When you cry I can't see your beautiful eyes," Draco whispered, removing Harry's glasses and wiping his tears. "Come on, else we're going to be late." Harry sniffled once more and then stepped into the large fireplace. "It's the first time he's shown thoughts like that in a while," he heard Draco murmur to Sirius. "Maybe it was the run-in with the Dursley's? Or having to deal with two trials in one day?" Sirius said quietly back to Draco. "I'm fine, now let's go, Ministry of Magic!" Harry shouted and felt that horrible lurch in the bottom of his stomach as he zoomed through the fireplaces.
Harry shivered slightly and Draco pulled him closer to him, warming him up a little bit. They were both being cautious but as far as they could see, nobody was around. Harry placed his head on Draco's shoulder and Draco kissed the top of Harry's head. "I wish we could be like this all the time," Harry whispered, his emerald green eyes meeting Draco's sparkling grey. Draco noticed that Harry's eyes weren't as bright as they used to be, they weren't full of hope anymore and it broke his heart. "It will be one day." Draco replied, though they both new that the future for them and any others like them, was uncertain.
But despite the feeling of dread concurring in his stomach, he couldn't help but feel pure glee as he walked into the dungeons. "What's got your smile plastered on so big?" Hermione asked. "Later." Harry whispered as Professor Slughorn started talking.
Draco rolled his eyes, pulling Harry's head towards him so their lips almost connected- then Hermione burst through the door, holding a book and some old newspaper clippings and Draco let out a loud, audible groan. "Can't I just kiss my boyfriend without being disturbed for once!" He sighed, half shouting as Hermione covered her eyes.
That didn't exactly work, as Harry's ruthless uncle slammed open the door and sent Harry flying across his room. "HOW DARE YOU DO THAT THING IN MY HOUSE! I HAVE THE RIGHT MIND TO THROW YOU OUT OF HERE!" Harry scrambled up and saw Dudley and Petunia standing at the door. "Don't have your Dumble-dick to protect you now do you? He's DEAD, isn't he!" Petunia laughed coming in and kicking Harry over. She walked back out, laughing to herself and Dudley followed her. Vernon however, shut Harry's window and curtains and stood over Harry. "Your going to be sorry you ever took that- that wand out in my house!" He chuckled, his words going through Harry like venom.

Harry started thinking on the way back to Privet Drive. Now that he could do magic outside of Hogwarts, things could change with the Dursley's he could finally use magic without getting another letter saying he was expelled, he had finished Hogwarts anyway. As soon as they got in, Harry ran up to his room and put his trunk into his wardrobe. He stuck his wand into his pocket and headed downstairs to start on his chores.
"Fine, deal with grief in your own way Potter." Malfoy rolled his eyes. "You not saying a thing isn't going to bring anyone back." He said and with that, he walked out. Who was Harry kidding. Malfoy wasn't showing concern for him. No one is. He'd just have to deal with it himself.
"I was imperiused!" Barton yelled, sending chills down Harry's spine. "Yeah, 'imperiused'." Harry replied, rolling his eyes. "A further ten points for your arrogance Potter! Look, I may not be the best person in the world but I would never have joined leagues with you-know-who willingly," Barton sighed. "Sure." Draco muttered under his breath, but Harry felt some sort of sympathy for his professor.

That was, until, a certain pale haired, grey eyed boy walked in and sat down. "Potter, I just wanted to say... sorry." He finally said. Harry looked up at Malfoy curiously. "I'm sorry for being such a cruel git to you and your friends all the time through the years. I really mean it. I don't know why I did it to be honest, I guess I don't handle rejection very well," he awkwardly chuckled. Harry just nodded in response and suddenly became very interested in the seat design.
"It's okay. I would do it again and again. He means the world to me!" Draco smiled, regaining his good Malfoy posture. "We know." Mr Potter smiled. The two boys sat opposite the ghosts on Draco's bed, whilst they were sat on Harry's.
"Dare!" Harry shouted like an excited toddler. "I'm a brave lion! Grrr!" He giggled. Draco loved seeing Harry like this, happy and carefree. "I dare you to play us something on your guitar! Yes Harry, I know your secret passion too!" He grinned deviously.
Once again, Harry slowly opened his eyes, just a little bit. Was he dead yet? Is this what heaven felt like? Because it sure hurt. Then he heard voices, or, one voice. "I think you can hear me Harry. Please wake up. I need you here! I need you to be able to stand by my side, and I'm not breaking my promise now I'm going to do everything in my power to help you back onto your feet again. Please Harry, I can't face this all alone. I need you."
The pair sat in a far corner booth at Draco's insistence as he claimed that "anybody could be watching, there are wizards everywhere!" However, nobody seemed to care when Harry leaned over and kissed Draco on the cheek before sliding into his seat.
"Concentrate. Focus on only your happiest memory." Harry said calmly. "Expecto Patronum!" Draco shouted, but still no animal formation appeared. Draco looked disappointed but Harry just smiled at him. "It's okay. We'll keep on trying, I never expected you to do it first try. Plus, we're drunk!" He giggled and threw himself onto his bed. He patted the space next to him and Draco lay down next to him.
Ron and Hermione retreated into their room for an 'early night' even though it was only eight o' clock. 8 o' clock! Harry remembered the note he had received earlier and suddenly just got nervous. Draco left the common room claiming that Slughorn wanted to see him for some reason, which Harry did not know. Must be something to do with Slytherin.
Silence.
Harry and Sirius looked around at the crowd of terrified students. A burst of anger and happiness flared up and Harry's voiced boomed over the whole hall. "Sirius Black is innocent!" He shouted over the crowd. "He was framed for those murders by Peter Pettigrew and then served for those crimes he did not commit. You have no need to fear him, I love him like I love my own father." The students blinked at Harry, silently stunned. "Well, wands away!" He cooed and wands went back in pockets, although gossiping students still looked scared.

"Harry, it's okay, calm down," Sirius said, pushing past Draco and hugging Harry tight. "You mean... He's innocent?" Draco asked, finally lowering his wand. "He's the only family I have left. He was my father's best friend," Harry smiled. "I thought he was gone, I thought he was killed. But, here he his!"
"What do you mean? Should I know you?" Ron asked. "C'mon, Ron, you have to be kidding. We've been best friends for years! How else would I know you can only sleep with your teddy bear and you wet the bed until you were seven?" Harry said with a smirk and Draco had to stifle a he burst of laughter with a coughing fit.
"I sense some tension here, whats goi'n on?" Hagrid asked, looking between Harry and Ron. "They had a really stupid argument and won't talk to each other, no matter how much I try to persuade them." Hermione huffed, clearly annoyed that neither boy would listen to her. "Well, listen 'ere. I've known you two to be best frie'ns since you was li'le. I'm sure no argument, big o' small can get between you two, eh?" Hagrid said.
George got up and engulfed Harry in a massive bear hug. "I'm so sorry Harry, I should've saw the signs, I should have known. I'm sorry I never wrote to you after the war its just-" George's eyes filled with tears.
"Look at you two, blushing every other second," Ginny laughed. The four talked for a while, avoiding the topic of a certain ginger haired bastard. That was until, he walked in.
Harry was late to potions that day, and had to quickly jump to his seat next to Hermione before Parvati Patil sat in it. She scoffed at him then took the last seat next to Neville.
"Watch it Potter! That'll be five points from Gryffindor for talking back! Ten points from Gryffindor and Slytherin for the disgusting cuddling!" Barton snapped. Draco pulled Harry closer to him which practically made Barton gag.
"Well, before I tell you why I was in the hospital, there's a bit of a backstory. It all started when Dumbledore left me with the Dursleys all those years ago. I always told you how much I hated living with them, but there was a real reason behind it."
Draco jumped off Harry and grabbed the chair, holding it up whilst Harry just sat there, not quite fully taking in what was happening. "Merlin, it's just you two. You gave me a heart attack!" Malfoy sighed, but Hermione had already rushed up to Harry.
"Hermione, what's going on?" Ron whispered in a panicky tone. "It's Harry and Draco. They're playing as Jacob Evans and Alex Black. It's how they can be together in public." Hermione whispered back as the boys pulled apart.
"Draco!" Harry giggled. "Truth or dare?" Draco thought for a moment then smirked. "Truth." He replied. "BORING!" Seamus shouted.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
"Come with me," Harry whispered suddenly. "What?" Petunia spat again. "Come with me, just for a minute. I have something to show you." Harry stepped forward and held out his arm. "Petunia, don't, I'm warning you!" Vernon snarled, but she still grabbed Harry's outstretched arm. Draco quickly slipped his arm around Harry's waist and they were whisked away. They re-appeared on the doorstep of a large, dark house and Harry flung open the door and pulled the other two inside.
"Amazing plan Harry, but aren't you forgetting something? You haven't even asked Malfoy yet," she giggled. Harry's smile dropped as he remembered. The other boy probably wouldn't even want to go with him.
Whilst running, Skeeter had shrunk the camera so it was miniscule and with a pop was a beetle, scurrying away. Harry fell to the ground, choking in fear for what might happen next. Not only do they now have more proof, but the likely-hood was that Draco's face could be distinguishable in that photo.
'No, get off me you bitch!' He wanted to scream but alas, he was still stuck under the spell, so he had no choice but to follow. Pansy had turned Draco into her bitch, so when Harry Potter approached them at breakfast, she got extremely pissed off.
"You do know you never told me what Ron did," Sirius said. "I can't exactly tell you. Not without telling you some other things which I'm not exactly ready to share yet. It could get me in serious trouble."

Harry was brought back to 3rd year on the train to hogwarts, where they had first met Lupin. It was so strange to think that he wasn't here anymore. Neither is Tonks. All that's left of them is Teddy Lupin, Harry's Godson. Harry knew that when he gets out of school, he'd have to take Teddy into his custody. That is what Godfathers are there for, after all.
"Eat." Draco said plainly, pointing to Harry's plate which had been loaded with eggs, bacon, beans and so much more. But instead, Harry just took an apple from the fruit bowl and started nibbling on it. "I didn't want to do this Harry, but you leave me no choice," Harry looked at Draco, confused, "What do you mea-" But before Harry could finish, a spoon full of scrambled eggs was shoved into his mouth.
But when the path was cleared, Harry saw who had cast the patronus as its owner called it back. Draco. Draco and Harry's eyes locked, both as confused as the other. Draco was about to come over when Madame Pomfrey took him and Sirius by the ears and up to the hospital wing. Over the years, Harry had grown to absolutely hate that room.
Harry didn't even attempt to argue back, because he knew every word his boyfriend spoke was true. It was crazy how just a few months ago, Harry thought he would never be able to trust this boy and now, he didn't think he trusted anybody more.
"Blimey, Harry. You must be one powerful wizard to have a bond like that!" Sirius nodded, now back in his seat. "Or Draco is." Harry pointed out. "Or my dear second cousin, I suppose." The two men conversed for a while until Professor Barton came in and he and Sirius both let out an audible gasp, both pointing their wands at each other.
"I think it was pretty self explanatory when he was on top of you sucking your face off like a bloody dementor," Ron hissed, his ears and face redder than Harry had ever seen before. Ron started laughing to himself, shaking his head as he paced around the room. "I can't believe it. You, a faggot! Why can't you just be normal?" He exclaimed, practically spitting in Harry's face.
Harry stood in a small room he recognised as a nursery. In the corner of this room, a man with scruffy black hair and a woman my bright, gleaming emerald eyes were singing to a small baby in their arms. Their voices were both delicate and sweet and little baby Harry was watching his parents in awe, falling asleep. "Ever wonder where you got your musical talents from?" Sirius asked from beside him. "I heard you playing once. You sounded just like your Dad I was freaking out until I heard a sort of softness in it then thought of Lily. You are so talented, Harry Potter and yet you don't seem to realize that."
Harry opened his eyes again and he was back in the hospital wing, still in Draco's arms and the tears very much real. He quickly sat up and wiped them away, not wanting to make eye contact with Draco. But he didn't have a choice as Draco took Harry's chin and turned his face towards him. "You're ok," Draco smiled, before leaning in and kissing Harry lightly on the lips. They drew apart, Draco clutching Harry's face when Madame Pomfrey came bustling into the room.
"Oh, boo hoo, cut the crap nobody cares!" Draco rolled his eyes. "Harry is our worlds fucking saviour, he saved us all from eternal doom! What are people going to think if you lock him up, huh?" He snapped.  Fudge looked lost for a second then snarled. "I am the minister, not you and I think you will find I can do whatever I want! What do you care anyway? What even are you to Potter, last I heard you were helping plot to kill him!"
"Ron, what did you mean in defence when you said Malfoy was a fa- uh, you know?" Harry asked, wondering if Ron knew something or was just throwing it as an insult. "I heard my Dad talking about it to my mum. Apparently, Lucius Malfoy was trying to clear Draco from the Malfoy name after he found out he was gay, but he wanted to keep it quiet. I'm not surprised either. If it was me, I'd just take my child straight to Azkaban." He laughed.
"I knew that he was no good for you Harry." He said matter-of-factly. "Yeah, well, now you have no reason to hate me,"
"Draco, calm down. It was nothing, really!" But what Harry said, just appeared to make Malfoy even more angry. "Nothing? Nothing! I should have known before. I thought that I saw you wipe blood off your face when I came to see you. Thought I was going mental when it disappeared, but that was just the glamour, wasn't it?" So he did notice.
Harry had started to get a bit tired, so he went to investigate the bathroom. It had two toilet stalls, two showers and two sinks. Harry grabbed a towel out of the cabinet and put it on the railing outside of the shower stall. He stripped and turned the shower on.
"Lily, dear! What was it you literally just said to Draco here? That the past didn't matter?..." Mr Potter smirked. "It's- it's different!" Mrs Potter spluttered. "I don't think so!" Harry smiled in a sing-song voice. Lily looked speechless, then just came and sat back down, though still glaring deeply at Ron as though she was trying to rip him to pieces with her mind.
More of a stunned silence.
"But then Cho Chang kissed you, didn't she Harry! Under the mistletoe!" Seamus chuckled. "Uh, right... Cho Chang. I'm not doing a whole song by the way, I'm not that good." Harry shared eye contact with Draco for a couple of seconds before diverting his attention to his guitar.
Harry smiled and looked up into those grey eyes he had always longed for, even if he didn't know it. "I do love you too, Draco. And I don't want to lose you now. I want to get better, I need to get better. And if you don't want to help me, I understand,"
"You've been here for nine days. You, uh... You tried to leave." Draco muttered. They boys sat in silence as the rest of the night came back clearly, not missing out a single detail.
"Harry, what is it? I got your patronus and you sounded so upset!" She rushed, pulling him into a tight hug. "It was a fake relationship," said Harry hoarsely. "Draco never loved me. He was playing and humiliating me all along." Ginny quickly explained what happened to Luna and Hermione so that Harry wouldn't have to repeat it again.
Harry stood on the spot, shocked, wand still in hand. He slowly started to walk back up to number 4, reliving the events that just occurred. He climbed back up to his room and lay on the bed. Tomorrow, Harry would be going back to Hogwarts, away from the Dursley's once again. He was dreading it but excited at the same time.
Hermione had been taking small sips of her firewhiskey, but didn't allow herself to drink too much- drunk Hermione is a reckless Hermione. "Let's play spin the bottle truth or dare!" Seamus hiccuped, holding up an empty bottle of vodka (mainly drank by Harry, who had just wanted to forget all the pain he'd been through and all his worries for a night).
"That's right Harry, I am your girlfriend!" She smiled anxiously, and gave him a quick peck on the lips. Entertained students retreated back into their dorms, laughing at Harry's drunkenness and gossiping in awe about his not-so-secret musical talent.
"Well, yeah, but I'm fine now! And maybe it's not up to you, maybe it's up to the-"
"I called on them a couple of nights ago. Who better to tell the story than the people who were in it?" Sirius said and Harry simply nodded. He had wanted to call on his parents ever since they left him again that night a couple of weeks ago, but he hadn't. Because you're a wimp. You can't look in the faces of the people you killed.
They broke away and looked at one another. "You, Mr. Potter are very much gay, and one hell of a kisser." Draco winked, then walked out of the dorm room, wiggling his bottom slightly making Harry giggle and blush.
The song ended and the sound of applause filled the room. Harry came back to the real world and saw that everyone was clapping, seemingly at them. "That was beautiful," one girl whispered. "They look like they could be soulmates for all we know, it was perfect!" Another boy said. Harry and Draco blushed at the comments, but bowed together.
Harry crawled into his bed after getting a rather nasty beating from Uncle Vernon, when an owl swooped into his window. Harry untied the piece of parchment attached to its leg, gave it a couple of his old owl treats and watched as the charming bird flew away. He rolled open the piece of parchment, expecting to see Rons scruffy writing or Hermione's neat, but instead an unknown was layed out in front of him. Potter, meet me on the end of Privet Drive tomorrow afternoon at 2. We need to talk- D.
"POTTER!" Draco yelled. Harry laughed at him. "You turned me into a girl!" He whined. "Well, it is boy-girl and I asked you, so you get to be the girl." Harry smirked, pulling on one of Draco's curls. "Fine then, my turn!" Draco said, grabbing his own wand. Harry felt his face change, then when Draco lowered his wand. He looked in the mirror and gasped.
'Don't do it, Draco.'
"Why does he know?" Draco snapped, turning to Harry. "I didn't tell him!" Harry said, putting his hands up in defence. "No, George did, But also, I'm his best friend so I kind of have a right to know." Ron smirked. Harry turned to Ron and narrowed his eyes so they were simply just slits.
Harry and Sirius watched memory after memory, bursting into fits of laughter when a new born baby Harry woke up in the middle of the night screaming and a freaked out James ran around the house as a stag, and into pools of tears when James proposed to Lily because it was so beautiful.
Whilst they were planning all day, Hermione brought up food from the kitchens, watching Harry closely to make sure he ate more than just one pomegranate seed. Draco also pushed Harry to eat more, which he reluctantly obliged to. He didn't say it out loud, but he was glad he was getting better and it made him even happier that it was Draco helping.
They joined Seamus and Dean at the very end of the eighth year table, closest to the door and furthest away from the rest of the students. For once, Draco felt lucky that nobody wanted to sit next to him so they all had space.
"It's alright. It's okay! You're Harry Potter, saviour of the wizarding world, I'd like to see Fudge try to put you in Azkaban!" He chortled. "Hermione said that too, but I'm not so sure. We'll see in the trial anyway. The argument with Ron was just him being a homophobic little shit. He... he prompted me to kill myself and gave me the last metaphorical push. He then shoved a blade in my hand and told me to... you know, 'finish the job'."
I started writing this on Wattpad a couple of years ago but I can’t get back onto my account eek so I’ll be posting it on here :)
Ginny noticed Harry and Draco still holding hands and whispered something to Hermione, who just giggled. "What? What is it?" Draco asked as the girls giggled further. "How's that straddle and snog action working out for you?" Ginny snorted.
"Let's go and ask Harry then, he'll know, he'll prove me right! I've never seen either of you before in my life!" Ron growled, now getting angry. "Oh, so you and him are suddenly just best friends again? After what you did..." Draco growled, the anger clearly not fake.
"You two have the exact same patronus. I knew that you could have a stag and a doe, for example, just like Harry's parents or you switch patronus's like mine is a dog and Ron's is an otter!" She spoke then frowned. "Was, sorry. Anyway, I don't think I've ever heard of a couple who have the exact same patronus's. And then I thought about Harry's behaviour towards Pansy at breakfast, when he growled..." She paused again and the two boys stared at her, waiting for her to carry on when out of the blue, she moved to punch Draco.
James stopped laughing and beamed down at Harry who returned a smile. This is what life should have been like, growing up hearing about the legendary pranks James Potter and his friends played at school and then trying to pull even better ones. That's the life Harry wished he had.
After ten minutes of her awkwardly trying to get Harry to drink different potions, Draco came in and Pomfrey left leaving the two boys with some privacy. "You did it!" Harry grinned. "Yeah, well the dementor was about to kiss you and ain't nobody touching those lips but me!" He laughed in a joke sassy voice.
Harry wanted to lash out at Ron, yell at him that there was nothing wrong about Malfoy liking boys. But instead, he chose the friendlier approach. "I don't see what you've got against gays?" He asked. "They're just people who love the same gender, it's not like it's a choice. You didn't choose to be straight, you just are. They didn't choose to be gay, it's just their lifestyle. Plus, wouldn't they be good to adopt the squibs and werewolves that have been abandoned by their parents?" Ron just shrugged, as if not giving two about what Harry has to say.
Harry couldn't stop staring. He never noticed how beautiful one simple colour could be. The eyes tore away from Harry and he looked around. Memories of last night Came rushing back to him and he felt a stab of guilt. "D- Draco?" Malfoy whipped around at the mention of his first name. "I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier. I know you were only trying to help." Draco smiled, nodded then climbed back into bed. Harry waited for Draco to fall back asleep, before creeping out to the common room. It was three in the morning, but Harry could never go back to sleep after that dream, that nightmare.
"You're so cute, Potter!" Draco grinned, petting Harry. Harry barked in return and curled up in Draco's lap. Silence fell between the boys once more as they watched the moon. Everything was just how it should have been, until a ginger haired boy came strolling up to them.
"I'm so sorry!" He chocked as his best friends attempted to out their hands on his shoulders, only for them to fall through. "You have to be strong, Sirius. For Harry. For Teddy. For us." Lupin smiled sadly. "I know," Sirius sniffled. "It's just hard sometimes." James and Remus looked sadly at the only living Marauder. "We know, Pads. We know."
But there was that kiss. Draco kissed Harry first, so surely that counted for something. "Look, there he is now!" Hermione whispered, pointing to the pale blonde boy who had just walked in. "Hermione, I can't ask him now, I'm not prepared!" Harry whisper-yelled as Hermione tried to pry him off his seat.
"He beat this illness with the help and confidence of the people who loved him, and you need to let your friends help too. Accept help from anyone that offers it or else your just going to whither away bit by bit." Sirius got up and walked out, leaving and emotional Harry with an emotional school nurse who had been eaves dropping on their entire conversation.
He tuned his guitar and sat on his bed, strumming chords. This was the first time he had played after the whole Draco fiasco, and it felt magical. He hummed random melodies to the music, making up sentences in his head as he played which he then wrote down in his song book.
"Hermione, don't do that, don't blame yourself," Harry muttered, wiping the tears off her face. "Why not? That's what you've been doing to yourself! What hurts you hurts me, Harry. We're best friends. Do you ever think about hurting yourself?" She asked. "Sometimes, but I've never acted on it." He lied, for she didn't didn't know he hadn't got rid of the whole glamour.
"So what was this about building a fort?" Hermione giggled.
Ignoring what McGonogall said, Sirius went on happily. "You all thought that my dear cousin, Bellatrix, struck me with the killing curse, but actually, it missed. At the same time she cast her spell, another death eater behind us struck me with the crucio. He knocked me into the veil, which was some sort of archway into the after life."
A man came running out of a room and when he saw his godson, breathed a sigh of relief. But then Sirius stiffened up again as he saw the woman looking around the dark and dirty house with a look of illness and distaste upon her face. "Why have you brought her into my home?" Sirius spat as they all went into the living room. "I needed a private place." Harry said so firmly that Sirius did not even bother question it right then. "Uh, come Draco, I need to have some words with you." He said hastily and the other two men left, leaving Harry and Petunia in the large room, alone.
Suddenly, there was a searing pain in Harry's forehead and he went into a state of panic. The last time he had felt pain like this was when Voldemort had been stood right next to Harry. Memories from the war broke Harry's mind, even though the pain had faded away.
Halloween was coming up quickly and Harry still hadn't found a date to the party. He really wanted to ask Draco, but he knew he couldn't. He'd have to find a girl to ask, because apparently it's mandatory that you have a date.
Harry changed back into his human form, still sat in Draco's lap. "I should go after him," Harry started, and tried to get up but Draco pushed him right back down. "No, you are not running after that pathetic excuse of a boy." Draco snapped, suddenly reminding Harry of his old ways, when they were rivals.
Harry looked up at Draco questioningly, a slight smirk upon his face. "Yeah. What are you going to do about it?" Harry dared and Draco just smiled and rolled his eyes and kissed his boyfriend, wrapping his arms around Harry's slender waist and keeping him against the tree. The kiss lasted for what felt like an eternity, only stopping once in a while for breaths.
Harry was his best friend, he had been ever since that first train ride when they were eleven, and now it's like it never happened. His best friend had tried to commit suicide because of him, and he acted as if he didn't care, prompted it even, but the truth was, he did care.
Harry read the article in a stunned silence, unable to find his breath. There was no way in hell he would be able to win that trial now, there was far too much evidence against him. Harry's eyes scanned over the whole article and found there was no mention of Draco's name. He breathed out a sigh of relief then looked up at Hermione who was staring at him as if he might just collapse into the ground at the news. But, on the contrary, he was surprisingly calm.
"Alright, that's enough Weasley. Nothing like that happened for goodness sakes and correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't have a baby without a womb," Malfoy laughed, Harry flushing a deep red.
Ginny ran out of the common room and everyone stared at Draco. "What? Now she won't be the only sober one!" He said. "That," Harry slurred. "Is my boyfriend! He's the most kindest most amazingest person in the world!"
"Sorry Dad," Ron laughed, rolling his eyes. "Yes, sorry Daddy." Draco smirked and Ron did a double take and choke on his died out laughter. "Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't ask you sooner! Harry, are you top or bottom?" Hermione asked, which made Draco stop laughing too.
During the ride home, Harry started to read all of his school books he had with him. He understood Hermione now, the books were quite fascinating, especially Hogwarts: A history. "Never took you for the reading type Potter?" Malfoy said, as Harry stuck his nose further into the book. He started to think about going back to the Dursley's and all the pain that they inflicted upon him. He started to feel queasy, but just carried on reading. "You alright Potter? You look really ill." Malfoy stated. Harry just nodded and put his book down, as it was just making him feel more ill. "Dreading going home?" Malfoy asked. Harry snapped his head up to look at the other boy, wondering if he could somehow read thoughts. "Me too." Malfoy finally sighed, and spoke no more for the rest of the journey.
Draco leapt off from his seat and punched Ron right around the jaw. "Get your filthy faggot hands off me!" He growled. "RONALD!" Ginny screeched as she jumped up. "Get out of the way Ginevra, why are you protecting him, he cheated on you!" Ron and Ginny argued, before Ron pushed Ginny to the floor and stalked up to Harry's bed.
"Interested in hair growing potions, Harry?" Draco snickered, glancing at the book Harry was holding. "What? Oh, uh no," Harry chuckled awkwardly pushing the book back into its shelf. "I actually came over to talk to you," Draco put his book back, raising a single brow up at him.
"Hermione figured it out. First I started growling whenever anyone tried to hurt Draco and then that day with the dementors, that was Draco's patronus, the stag. Hermione being Hermione put two and two together and, well..." Harry held up his arm.
Harry quickly shut the door and walked into the next stall. He stripped and turned the water on. He watched as his glamour faded away. He deserved every punch, kick and slap that he got. He deserved every scar that he got. Yet, he just couldn't stay dead. He got out of the shower, wrapped his towel around his waist and stood in front of the mirror. It appeared that he other boy hadn't got out of the shower yet.
"Here I am." Sirius replied, smiling widely. "Oh. I'll um... I'll see you in class Harry." Draco said awkwardly, then slipped out. "I'm going to be living at Grimmauld, Harry. I'm going to ask Moony if he wants to move in with me and help make the house a little happier. Then we can prepare to finally end Voldemort, once and for all!"
"Now that you've tormented us a little bit, do you mind leaving, we were having a nice morning to ourselves before you came along." Draco smiled sarcastically. "Detention Malfoy! Tuesday night in my office!" Barton snarled then stormed away.
"Trouble is my middle name. And Sirius is my first!" Harry rolled his eyes at his Godfathers childishness, but had the urge to tell him the truth. "So... you know how I said Ginny and I are a thing? Well, we're not. And that's because, um... I feel how you felt with Remus, except all the time. Obviously, not with Remus, not that I don't think he's nice, but I would never... Like a Dad, you know and uh, get what I mean?" Harry said quickly, holding his breath.
Harry jumped back from Ron, remembering the first time Harry had showed signs of magic and his uncle had found out. They tried to beat him into being normal. Harry started to panic, unable to control his breathing. He was back in Privet Drive and he could hear Vernon's loud stomps coming angrily down the stairs above the cupboard where Harry slept.
'KILL HIM, DRACO! NOW!'
"So it is you two!" George grinned. "Yep! And for the record, Harry, this boy likes you very much too," Draco smiled. "Just, promise me Harry. If you ever get thoughts like that again, owl me. I can't be losing you too." George smiled and the door opened and the other Weasley's along with Hermione and Ginny came in.
At this point, Draco walked into the room and stopped at the scene, looking from George Weasley looking panicked and out of place to Harry, now lying on the floor having a panic attack. Draco ran into the bathroom and grabbed a cold, wet sponge and ran back out to Harry.
Harry shook his head and smiled. "You're here now. That's all that matters in this moment of time." Sirius looked up at Harry, wiping away stray tears. "How are you holding up, Harry? You've been through too much for such a young boy."
"That's just ghastly. He's lucky that I love him so much. Maybe I can persuade him to look at things differently," Hermione nodded. At that point, Ron walked in and looked at Harry and Hermione.
"Moony?" He cried, as the werewolf looked at him, broken. He looked younger than the last time Sirius had seen him. "Death has done me some good deeds," he chuckled. "I look good and I don't turn into a monster once a month. Neither does Tonks, which is always good to hear!" Remus grinned mischievously.
"W- what? What do you mean?" Ron spluttered, eyes widening. "Well don't make us repeat it!" Draco drawled. "Is this some sort of prank? Where are Harry and Ferret then?" Ron asked suspiciously, eyes narrowing.
Even though it had taken her a little while longer to forgive him, Ron and Hermione were back on track. "Just kiss already!" Harry grinned and Ron's ears went red but Hermione pulled him into a kiss. "None of that in my classroom whilst a lesson is in progress please!" Barton snapped and Hermione pulled away blushing furiously. "Today we will be learning a new found spell to block the cruciatus curse. First, I'll need a volunteer to demonstrate the curse on!" The class chuckled but then stopped as they saw Barton had a dead serious look on his face.
"You're such a kid," Draco said hiding a smile. "Says the one who decided to build a fort."
Harry showed Draco his wrist and he knew that the last slither of hope for this boy had disappeared. As well as some obvious fresh scars on his arm, the little heart was completely black and wasn't beating at all.
"Why? Is Hermione really driving you that mad?" Harry smiled weakly, opening his eyes further, only to see blurry dots. But, he could tell as Draco's eyes widened and his face split into a grin that seemed to reach from ear to ear.
"How did you know?" Harry asked, sitting on the other boys bed next to him. "It was kind of just a feeling, you know. My Father tried to make an arranged marriage for me and this girl from Ravenclaw. I didn't like her that way, or any other girl. But I started looking at this one boy in a different light," he shrugged.
"Can you promise me, promise me that it isn't a joke or some foolish way to make fun of me?" Harry spoke. "I promise, cross my heart and swear upon Merlin!" Draco answered defiantly. "How could I pretend to be with someone and build a fort with them, come on, I only do that with the most special people!" He winked and Harry smiled, then gasped.
Slughorn eyed him for a minute then chuckled lightly. "Well any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine! I helped him defeat he who must not be named, you know!" And he walked away.

Ginny moved out of the crowd and stood beside Harry, grabbing his hand. This gesture caused many confused faces amongst the students, professors and workers. "Well are you gay or not?" Someone shouted. Harry took a deep breath in. "Yes. I'm gay." There were cries all around, people calling him names and some people running back to try and stand as far away from him as possible. Draco, Ginny and Hermione stayed with him, but Ron was nowhere to be seen.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
"No thanks, I'm swamped with homework. I need to get it done before Monday," Harry replied, rolling his eyes. Ron and Hermione came down later and announced they were going on a date that day, which left Harry to himself.
"He's been abused by the muggles his whole life. They starved him and now he just doesn't eat at all. He blames himself for the war and all the people we lost. Mix that with a giant secret and a really bad fight with his 'best friend' I suppose it got too much for him," he sighed, sitting in the chair next to his raven haired party date.
"Now, this counter curse..." Barton carried on talking but Ron and Hermione were whispering hurriedly. "Do you think anybody suspected them?" Ron whispered. "I don't think so. Anybody would have stopped Barton but Malfoy got there first." Hermione replied but the worried expression etched on her face spoke otherwise.
"He told me that you and Malfoy were... in love." He chocked out, and Harry could tell that it was forced out. "No. Draco wasn't in love with me." Harry said emotionlessly. "He left me. Said he was just playing me, making a fool out of me. You were right, I was stupid to fall for him." Ron gaped at him, stopping in the middle of a corridor, before running to catch up with Harry who had kept on walking.
The news of Harry's trial and his confession had spread around like wildfire and witches and wizards all swarmed around him once a short, stumpy wizard in deep crimson robes called out "It's Harry Potter!"
Harry, stress overcoming him, shoved spoonfuls of eggs into his mouth, so much he almost looked like Ronald. "Oh Harry, I'm so proud of you!" Hermione squealed. Harry looked up at her then spat the eggs back onto his plate.
They headed back to eighth year tower and sat down in the common room. Crookshanks came padding out of Ron and Hermione's room and sat down, purring on Sirius's lap. They always did seem to have some type of weird connection.
"You didn't need a whole lot of convincing, we just had to build a fort together!" Draco laughed, then realized he had said that in front of other people and stopped chuckling immediately. Ron and Hermione just blinked at them, completely confused. "You really forgive too easy Harry." Hermione said, smiling slightly. "One thing I learned from the war, is that life's too short to hold a grudge. I think Draco realised that too and that's why he apologised to me on the train." Harry nodded and Draco blushed- Harry was exposing his nice side to everybody!
He wrote this song, thinking that Draco would of course, never return these crazed feelings, but look at them now, sharing kisses whenever they could, sneaking around like rebellious teenagers.
"My sweet, why are you crying?" He asked, brushing away the tears. "I'm so happy things ended up like this. Sirius is alive, he's here and he is a free man! That's all I dreamed it to be since I found out he was my godfather and the truth about that night years ago. I finally have somebody I can look to as a father and do things a father and son might do. And of course, I have you, my sweet, beautiful soulmate. I couldn't be any more content in this moment," Harry sniffled, smiling up at Draco with a shine in his eyes that let said boy know that this was the truth.
Harry pulled Remus to the side and whispered. "Sirius is afraid to say it, but... he loves you, you know. He really does, you didn't see his reaction when he found out you were gone." Remus nodded sadly. "I do know. I'm always watching him. I loved him too- tell him that." He smiled, then disappeared with the rest of the ghosts.
"Uh, Harry, Ron and I have to go to the prefects carriage. Will you be okay here alone?" Hermione asked. Harry wanted to yell at her, of course he wasn't going to be okay alone, he never was and never will be! But of course, he just nodded again. "We'll be back as soon as we can." And with that, they left. Harry was by himself... again.
"Harry, darling, can I speak with you please?" Mrs Weasley asked, pulling Harry out of his thoughts about a certain blonde boy who was missing out on the cheer and fun. "Oh, uh, sure!" He smiled and Mrs Weasley pulled up a cheer. "How have you been doing?" Harry asked politely, getting nervous around the woman who recently lost a child due to his mistakes. "I'm alright, my dear. I actually wanted to ask you about something said during the trial, it's been pulling at my hair," she frowned. "It was said that you are... gay?"
"Harry, Harry wait!" Draco yelled as he ran. "I have veritaserum, I can prove the truth to you!" He caught up to the trio and blocked their path. "You'd be willing to do that for me?" Harry gasped softly. Veritaserum was nasty stuff and did not feel good at all.
"Look what you've done you stupid boy!" Vernon spat at Harry, who didn't even know he was being spoken to until Draco was pushed out the way and he had been smacked round the back of the head. "Don't, Vernon." Petunia said softly, surprising everyone once again. "Why, would you like to do him in yourself, sweetheart? Try to knock a bit more freakishness out of him?" Vernon said, grinning evilly, his purple face swelling even further with the joy of hurting his nephew. "I- I have something to confess. I... I was a witch at Hogwarts until my fourth year," Petunia squeaked.
It was Sirius's turn to roll his eyes. "I just want to make sure that you're safe, Harry. I don't want to end up alone." Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat, knowing what his Godfather was thinking about.
That's when a thought popped into his head. "Ron?" He asked, looking at the red headed boy who was currently shoving egg into his mouth. "Yeah?" He muffled, not even bothering to wait until he had finished his mouthful. "What do the ministry do to gay wizards?"
"No, no Harry I wasn't! It was Pansy Parkinson, she had me under the imperius curse, none of it was me!"
"You're joking, Perce!" Shouted Fred as the death eater he was fighting collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells.
"HARRY!" Hermione yelled, running in. "What, what is it? Are you alright? Are you hurt?" Harry panicked, quickly jumping up and grabbing his wand. "Yes, yes! I've just had a brilliant idea!" She squealed.
"We should go after them, they aren't exactly buddies, are they?" Ron said. "You will stay right where you are Weasley! Nobody else will leave this classroom until I say so, or you may just become a part of my demonstration like Potter was." Barton snarled and everybody stayed stiff in their seats.
Sirius eventually brought Harry back into the office and they sat down, wiping away leftover tears. Sirius then got something out of a small bag and handed it to Harry. It was a small picture frame and a necklace of gold ribbon.
Harry rolled his eyes but leant in and pressed a kiss against Draco's neck. "I'm glad to have you back Ferret."
Harry seemed to be playing his guitar and singing, and when he finished there was applause. "What was that song that you sang to me, in the memory I saw? I really liked it." He said. "La vi en rose," an unfamiliar male voice replied. It seemed somehow distant.
"But, Harry, you don't like coff- oh!" George gasped. "So, Ron... Does he know?" Harry nodded his head and sighed. "There's this boy that I really really like and I think he likes me too, and Ron caught us together... He, um, sort of put the cherry on top of this massive cake and it all collapsed," George looked at him eyebrow raised and Harry stared him straight in the eye. "I tried to commit suicide, George. I wasn't in my right mind, Ron had already gone and told me that if I was gay then I should kill myself and I guess I listened to him."
Harry got up off the floor and sat beside Ginny on her bed. He had stopped crying ad now just felt pure fury. "I can't believe I let him play me like that," he said. "Nobody could have known Harry. It all looked so genuine." Ginny stopped talking as the four other Gryffindor girl seventh years and a couple of Ravenclaw girls came in. "Oh, are you alright Harry?" Luna asked. "Let's go somewhere more private and collect Hermione along the way." Harry whispered, and got up, grabbing Ginny's hand softly, as he still had to pretend in front of the others that he was her boyfriend. He quickly sent a patronus to Hermione telling her to meet them in the Room of Requirements, where him and the two girls were headed.
Harry walked back out into the bedroom, but froze when he saw someone sitting on the other bed. "Who is that?" They asked and turned around. "Potter?"
"You can't honestly expect me to leave with you!" Hermione screeched, her face contorted with a mix of emotions. "You disgust me Ronald Weasley and I can't even look at you without wanting to personally murder you myself. If you hadn't guessed it, I'm through with you. Never expect me to take you back you evil cockroach!" She hissed.
"It's all my fault, and I am so sorry. Sorry that I had to be the chosen one, sorry that I was even born! Maybe if I wasn't then Fred would still be here. Mum, Dad, Sirius. They would all still be here." He slid down the wall, again, head between his knees. "Are you an idiot Weasel? Can't you see he already blames himself enough?" Came Malfoy's voice. "Keep your nose out of it Malfoy, it's none of your business." Ron said, then stormed out.
"And you've been back two weeks and haven't even had the audacity to come and say hi, I am your sister and-"
"It's okay, I understand. We were all grieving. Nobody had time for me," Harry smiled sadly. "Um, except me!" Draco said. Harry flashed Draco and smile and turned back to George. The ginger haired boy stared at the two curiously, then his eyes landed on their hands clutched together and smirked. "When you say Ron 'caught' you, what did you mean exactly? Is there going to be a little Potter-Malfoy running around?" George snickered.
Harry didn't know why, but he got up, stormed out and went straight towards Neville's room. "Oh, hey Harry," Neville smiled as he walked in. Luna was in there too, doing her makeup for the party. "Luna, you need to tell him," Harry said bluntly. Luna looked confused, but then saw Ginny at the door. "Oh," she said dreamily. "Well, seems as you told Harry I suppose I can tell Neville," Luna said and sat down opposite Neville. Harry nodded then walked out of the room to give them some privacy.
Harry pocketed the blade and went back inside the hospital wing where Draco was pacing a corner, mumbling curses to himself and Ginny was comforting Hermione once again. "Ron said he's leaving Hogwarts. You don't ever have to even look at him again," Ginny nodded.
"No need," Harry said, sadly. "What?" Sirius asked, confused. "Voldemorts dead. Gone. Kapush. Never coming back. But, Sirius... Neither is Remus." Harry looked up at his Godfather stricken with shock. His eyes had the same ghostly look to them, but now tears were falling and Sirius was shaking madly. "M- Moony? He's.. g-g-gone?" He cried, and Harry couldn't help but let a few tears go too. "I'm so sorry, Padfoot," Harry whispered, holding his Godfathers hand. Sirius screamed out, shaking all over with grief and Harry just sat with him until he calmed down a little bit.
"What, why not?" Draco whined. "I was under the imperius curse! Gosh imperius and crucio, this week hasn't been good for me."
Harry went back into his dorm room and got changed. He headed into the common room and saw students leaving for breakfast. Ron and Hermione came out of their room and Hermione threw a apologetic look at Harry. "Ron, will you please apologise to him?" she whispered. Ron just rolled his eyes and stepped out of the portrait.
McGonagall strode across to the other side of the room, her hand over her mouth to stifle her cries. Madame Pomfrey ran over to comfort her, so Draco took the chance to grab Harry's hand in his own. That's when he noticed it.
"I'm sorry, Potter but as he is your legal guardian then I'm going to have to explain everything to him. On that note, Madame Pomfrey has informed me you haven't been to see her once since you were discharged!" Harry huffed and started to make his way down to potions. Sirius had already had to take in so much information, could he deal with even a little bit more?
"Why are you always covered in blood?" Draco sighed softly as if this was a common thing now. "I get asked that question a lot!" Harry laughed. "But Harry, seriously... You didn't?-" Harry quickly shook his head and Draco smiled a bit.
Harry stood, frozen to the spot, until he came to his senses. Draco. He needed to protect Draco, his one chance of happiness. Harry ran after Draco, looking out for a glimpse of blonde or purple hair.
Sirius frowned at Harry. "Please, Harry. I need it to be you." Harry smiled sadly at Sirius, then nodded. "Okay then, if it means that much to you. Out of interest, how did you ask Mum and Dad?"
The evening came around and the Weasley's had left, George lingering for a few minutes after to check up on Harry then flooing away.
"There was no point in you attacking me. Using some spell that Snivellous made up- and it wasn't even perfected! Whoever uses that sectumsempra curse are bloody dark, stupid and foolish wizards! You were foolish! I almost died and you got a small scratch boo fucking hoo."
"Hey guys," Harry smiled in his fake American accent, catching on with the plan. "Um... Jacob?" Hermione said confusedly. Ron simply looked baffled. "Who are you?" He asked. "Oh, ha ha. Good joke." Draco- or Alex rather- said in a sarcastic, high and squeaky voice.
Harry just groaned, got up and started to walk towards the hall. He looked behind him and Draco was there, following him making sure he didn't run back. Harry headed for the Gryffindor table, but felt an arm tug his, and he was pulled over to the Slytherin table. Draco sat Harry down and started to load food onto Harry's plate, earning an odd look from what felt like everyone in the school. Harry looked over at the Gryffindor table and saw Ron just shovelling food into his mouth, not even noticing the absence of his so called best friend.
"I have something else to admit. I'm seeing someone- I'm not going to say who just yet, but we have the encanta bond." Sirius fell off his seat. "You and Malfoy have the encanta bond?"
"That's because we aren't together, Pansy. We never were. And I'm already a lot happier with these friends than I ever was with you, you ugly bitch!" Draco sneered, and she slapped him clean across the face.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
Harry's voice became as clear as Pansy's inside Draco's head, and he almost dropped his wand in shock. It was Harry, it was Harry all along. 'DO IT!' Pansy screeched. "No." Draco chocked as he felt the spell loosen.
"Right. Well, I have some homework to do, and quite frankly, I don't want to do it with a homophobe like you, so I'm going to go into my dorm room and do it." He snapped, and stormed off. When he walked in to room number seven, he saw Draco sitting on his bed with a book in his hands.
Draco spun the bottle and it landed on Ginny. "Truth or dare," He smiled, casually taking a shot of vodka. "Dare!" Ginny smiled. "I dare you to go and get Luna and make her join in the game," Draco smiled. He knew that Ginny felt lonely, being the only one not drinking, so now she could have Luna.
Fred looked at Percy with glee. "You actually are joking Perce... I don't think I've heard you joke since you were.."
"He only started getting better when his friends and family were there to help him. Lily finally said yes to being his official girlfriend too and that lifted his spirits. One of the main reasons why he wasn't getting better was because he didn't open up to us and he felt so lonely and depressed, I guess. People had assumed that James and Lily had been a couple for ages, but it was only real when he asked and opened up to her, and she helped him in numerous different ways, like Ginny will help you, Harry, if you let her."
Inside the frame were two pieces of paper, holding the same vows Harry had heard in the wedding memory. On the ribbon, there were two wedding rings. "I was going to give these to you as a wedding gift but now seems more fitting." Sirius nodded. Harry threw his arms around his Godfather and they stayed for a while, talking about baby Harry and hilarious pranks the marauders used to play.
Harry's heart stopped and his insides froze as if he had already been wheeled to Azkaban, surrounded by dementors. "Oh, sure! Just take the Harry Potter to Azkaban as a way to say thank you for winning the war!" Amos Diggory shouted from beside Leonara. "My son may be gone, but Harry here did his best to save all of your lives, and your children! Cedric wouldn't have wanted Harry's ending like this."
"I don't understand," Harry smiled. "Who'd want to love me?" Tears filled Harry's eyes as he looked away from the boy that he wanted to give his whole heart to. "I want to. And I always will. I saw them Harry. What you've done to yourself, on your arm. And I don't understand! I never realised it was that bad and I should've, I am so sorry that I was too dumb to see how much you were actually hurting. I love you, Harry. And I'm not afraid to say it anymore because now I think that you love me too."
Draco was all Harry could think about. When he talked to him, Harry just wanted to answer but something was stopping him, like an invisible force inside his body telling him he's not allowed to get up and function properly. And so he listened, just like he always had.
Draco finally put the sponge down and wrapped his arms around Harry from the back and put a quick kiss on his head. "What just happened?" George breathed, handing Harry his shirt and robes. Harry quickly slipped them on then looked up at George. His red hair had grown past his ears- or rather just ear and his eyes looked distant.
"How will I know? I'm so confused Draco, I don't know what to think," Harry sighed, furrowing his brows. "I know something that might help." Draco smirked and before Harry could say anything, he felt a soft pair of lips on his. It was strange at first, he wasn't used to it, but then he slowly melted into it, their lips moving in sync.
"Nymphadora Tonks. And a son! Who knew you had it in you Moony. I'm so sorry. If I had found my way back sooner then maybe you wouldn't be... gone." Sirius cried, pained that he couldn't hug his lifelong best friend. "We aren't truly gone, Sirius. You know that." Another voice said from behind him. James.
"If you spit it out, I will hex you." Draco said, drawing the spoon away from Harry. Cursing inside his head, Harry slowly chewed the eggs, thinking of a way he could possibly spit them out. But, finally giving up, he swallowed. In that moment, Harry had the sudden urge to throw up, so ran out of the hall, hand over his mouth. He ran to the nearest boys toilets and threw up. He heard the door open and close then a hand rubbing calming circles on his back.
"What are you doing here?" Sirius spat. "I'm a professor here. I needn't ask what you're doing here, I heard about your little fiasco in the Great Hall. Bet you loved that attention, didn't you?" Barton spat back. "I'm confused," Harry stated. "You two know each other?"
Dean turned back to the game and spun the bottle. It landed on Harry. "Dare!" He shouted before anyone could even ask. "I dare you... To give Draco a hickey!" Dean smirked. Draco started blushing immensely, but Harry was already dragging him towards their dorm room and away from watching eyes.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
Overwhelmed with pain, Harry passed out but Draco stood up and pinned Barton against the wall by the neck. "You dare hurt Harry again and you'll be dead in a heartbeat." He growled. He picked Harry up over his shoulder and stormed out of the classroom. Barton cleared his throat at the shocked class who were now looking at him in fear.
"What're you going to do Harry?" Luna asked, worry etched into her voice. "What I do best." Harry replied, shrugging.
"I know, but I have friends in there and I just left them for the worse! They should hate me." Harry muttered quietly, suddenly finding the pattern on the pillows very interesting. "You have to stop doing that! Nobody is going to hate you, you just had the cruciatus curse performed on you, if anything they'll feel sympathetic. You've already defeated the Dark Lord and now you have one of his followers as a professor- not that people know that."
Harry glared at Draco, but Draco just shot him back an 'it was for your own good' look. "I'll leave you two to catch up, I'm sure, Mr Malfoy that you can explain everything. You have an extremely loyal friend Potter, even if you haven't always seen eye to eye. He hasn't left this room once since you arrived." She smiled gently and walked away.
We're so far deep, I'll sing my song to you,
Harry, Draco and Sirius pushed through the crowd and down to the department of mysteries and into a trial room. It was the same room where the Lestranges had been ordered to Azkaban and Harry had narrowly escaped expulsion from Hogwarts in his fifth year.
Draco spun the bottle which landed on Dean who picked truth. He admitted that he actually does love Quidditch more than football. Dean spun the bottle which landed on Hermione, who also picked truth. "I don't like doing dares!" She complained. Hermione spun the bottle which landed on Draco again, who picked dare and he spun it and it, thankfully for him, landed on Harry.
"Anyway, we found and destroyed the real locket but then got kidnapped by snatchers. We were taken to Malfoy Manor and we escaped but Wormtail and Dobby were killed. We made our way back to Hogwarts, after getting the cup out of Bellatrix Lestranges valt and there was a war. That's why things may seem a bit out of place now."
"I never hated you, Harry! I could never hate you. You have every right to hate me, though, and I am so, so, so sorry! I know you can't forgive me right away, but-"
His eyes were clutched tight. Harry was living in his own nightmare even though he was wide awake. "HARRY!" a voice shouted. Harry's eyes flew open and he saw rubble laying everywhere. He was in the castle grounds, the reminiscence of the war right in front of him.
The common room was almost empty apart from two Gryffindor boys Harry recognised as Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan. Harry was about to walk away, when he saw Dean lean in to Seamus and they kissed. "Holy shit." Harry accidentally said The two boys stood up and stared at Harry. Multiple bottles of Fire whiskey scattered the floor around them. It must have been a drunk kiss or something, Harry thought as they ran off into their dorm.
"I'm alright now, thanks," Harry muttered, not looking them in the eye, more just looking at the patterns on the floor. The guilt had started consuming him once again.
"Who are the first two?" Harry asked. "Your Mum and Dad." Sirius replied. Harry thought for a moment then sighed. "I'd love to Padfoot, but I don't know whether or not they would believe me. Like you said, a couple of days before my trial- with their suspicions of me, I don't know whether they would take into account anything I say."
Draco looked down at the ground shuffling awkwardly. He really should tell them, but he didn't want to betray Harry's trust especially not at a time like this. "Mr Malfoy, do you know something?" Pomfrey asked. He would tell, he'd have to! It's for Harry's own good.
"But that's hardly fair. I get to share my problems with you but you can't share yours with me? We're meant to be in this together Draco, why can't you see that?" Harry sighed heavily. "Because my main priority at the moment is you! I'm not going to stop helping you until that heart on your wrist is red and even then I'm not going to stop caring for you!" Draco smiled seriously.
The whole room burst into applause and Harry jumped up and took a long bow. He put his guitar on an armchair near him then pulled Draco up next to him. "I wrote that song about yooouuuuu!" Harry giggled. The whole room went silent. "I love you Draaacccooooo!"
"So you confess?" Fudge said, clearly surprised that it was as simple as that. "Yep. And I'm not ashamed either! Neither should anyone else who are hiding who they truly are on the inside, it isn't fair! Why don't we get to be with who we love and you do? " These words were repeated in a Ministry courtroom at nine o'clock in the morning, the following Saturday.
"We found the diadem, and destroyed the two horecruxes which we thought just left Nagini. Voldemort tried to kill me again but it didn't work, just got rid of the part of his soul that was inside me. Neville killed Nagini and we defeated Voldemort. Ron and Hermione became a couple!" He grinned, for a brief moment forgetting the fight that had taken place between the two boys.

It took a while for Ron to find Malfoy, as he had gone near the end of the lake and into some form of a cave. Malfoy was sat with a black sleeping wolf in his lap and his head snapped up when Ron came strolling down. "What the fuck are you doing here Weasel?" He snapped and the wolf opened his eyes to see what in the name of Merlin was going on.
"You must be a terrible kisser if that's the case," Malfoy chuckled. "You want to bet on it?" Harry smirked. He wasn't sure where he got this boost of confidence from, but he was enjoying it. "Oh, I'd love to." Draco whispered, and their lips locked together like two matching pieces of a jigsaw.
Harry hadn't said a word since the battle ended. Since Tom was finally brought to his end. Blood, bodies and rubble lay scattered all over the castle grounds, and as Harry looked around, he felt all the pain. All the guilt, he had taken all of these peoples lives away, it was his fault. He felt a hand on his shoulder and turned around. It was Hermione, all beaten and bloodied up, tears streaming silently down her face.
Harry was left alone, once again, so he decided to venture into his dorm room and pick up his guitar. Harry knew that he had played for the others that one night, but it still made his heart pound at the thought of performing for them. He was just too scared, though of what, he didn't know.
"But it was Malfoy!" Ron spat. "He's changed, Ron. I could tell in the couple of hours I spent with them, he is head over heels for Harry. If he ever did anything to Harry, then mark my words we would pummel him right into hell and then further down, but you haven't seen them when they're together, Ron. They're pretty much in love."
"I should be heading back. Kreacher was giving me some weird lip about 'Master Harry and his courageous friends' and how he 'misses them so!' You've broken my house elf!" He laughed. "Tell Kreacher I'll visit as soon as possible." Harry grinned and waved as his Godfather walked away.
"James only told us in the beginning of seventh year. One of the few times I've seen your Dad cry. He told us everything, that he'd been so ill all this time and the potions weren't working. He was scared he was going to die and that's why he was so cocky all the time. He didn't want to show that he was afraid, just like the rest of us are at the worst of times."
It was a very small gesture, but Harry noticed that it was there. "Ron and I are going down to Hogsmeade next weekend together, do you want to come Harry?" Hermione asked. "No thanks Hermione, I have things that I need to do." Harry said, forcing a smile. That was a complete lie. Harry didn't have anything to do over the weekend that he knew of yet, he just didn't want to become the third wheel and sit awkwardly as Hermione and Ron shared a butterbeer and talked about their relationship.
"Is that your Halloween costume Harry? For the party?" He asked. "What, what party?" Harry asked. "You know, the big halloween party everyone has been talking about on Halloween," Harry must've not been listening to whatever teacher told them. "Right, that party. Uh, yeah I'm trying this out. What do you think?" He asked.
Slughorn opened the doors to the Great Hall and everyone ran in, the girls screaming in delight as they saw the Weird Sisters standing on the stage. They were playing a fast song first, so Harry and Ginny headed to the very front of the stage making sure to be seen together.
"His scar used to hurt when you-know-who was close to him or trying to invade his mind, Minerva told me," Pomfrey agreed, rushing around Harry and checking him with different spells and potions. "We've kept it quiet around school, Potter. We've told people that you had fallen off your broom not being able to see in the night. I suspected with things like this, you don't want anybody to know and that's why you used the glamour?"
"Mr Potter, if you would please come to my office. It's urgent!" She said, trying to hide a smile. She looked flustered and sweaty as if she had been running. Harry left his friends and followed the Headmistress to her office and when she opened the door, Harry almost fainted at the sight.
Harry and Ginny headed back to the eighth year common room and headed in as Wilma ticked off his name. Luna ran up to Ginny and gave her a hug as they entered. Hermione looked at Harry, and he nodded, confirming that his idea was going as planned.
Draco placed a kiss on the other boys forehead, a couple of tears dripping onto Harry's face. As Draco wiped them away he sniffled. "You said you were happy, Potter. And I was dumb enough to believe you. How could you be happy with me?"
Harry kept his eyes closed and huddled into himself. It had been a long day and yet it wasn't even noon. Draco came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms protectively around him and muttered "none of them will hurt you anymore." Harry just nodded and leaned back into the blonde boy's embrace.
"It was you, wasn't it?" Malfoy asked. Harry just looked at the pale haired boy in confusion. "You sent that letter to the ministry, didn't you. Excusing my mother from her Azkaban sentence." Harry slowly nodded, thinking back to after the battle and sending off a letter from the owlery. "Thank you," Malfoy muttered and did something Harry thought that he could never do. Malfoy, Harry's sworn enemy since 1st year, hugged him.
The months came and left very slowly. After a month of living with the Dursley's, Harry was allowed to eat again but, he had eaten merely one green apple before Uncle Vernon came up with another reason to beat Harry up and not let him eat again.
Harry could hear his heart best louder and louder in his chest. He could never be happy. What was he thinking? No one would ever accept him as he was. Everyone, if they haven't already, will abandon him. Harry's thoughts raced around in his head and he shakily got up and made his way to the balcony, the other two boys not noticing him.
"Master Harry! What is it Kreacher can do for you today? Some roast chicken? Steak and kidney pie? Catch any thieves?" The small, old house elf smiled, following Sirius into the room and bowing down to Harry. "Just take care of Sirius, yeah? When he gets back?" Harry smiled. "Of course, master Harry Potter, an honour it is! I is wondering where Dobby is being? Kreacher has not heard from Dobby in a while and Dobby is being Kreacher's friend," Kreacher said cautiously, and Harry felt his stomach drop and his heart break a little at the question. "Dobby's gone, Kreacher. He isn't coming back." Draco said softly, pulling Harry a little bit closer to him and raking a hand through his hair.
"Gryffindor are up against Slytherin in two weeks. Are you still the seeker for your house?" Harry asked, and Draco nodded. "Me against you again Potter. Don't worry, I'll go easy on you," he winked. "Easy? On me?" Harry laughed. "That is real cute Malfoy, you can give me all you got but it still won't be enough!" "Oh, really?" Draco grinned cheekily and pinned Harry against the tree.
Build a fort.
"Yeah, yeah it did." Harry replied sadly, staring dumbly down at his hands. "I have an idea!" Draco grinned, grabbing Harry's hands and smirking. He then grabbed his wand and changed himself into Alex Black and Harry into Jacob Evans. "Let's go and have some fun." He grinned at Harry's confusion, and just lead him out of their room and sat down with Ron and Hermione.
I'll hold you so close you'll see,
"I, too have some evidence!" Barton cried from the witness stand. He showed the court the photo from Harry and Draco's date the other night and Harry scoffed. "That's a girl," he stated. "Some girl from a lower year in school who had been obsessing over me, so I thought that I would give her what she wanted as well as testing for myself. Look at the delicacy of the hands, that's clearly a female." The court looked at the photo again and all nodded in agreement. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco looking all annoyed and huffy and it just melted Harry's heart. Draco spotted Harry looking and flipped him off while the court were obsessing over the photo. Harry smirked and shrugged, laughing quietly.
"Harry!" Harry turned to Sirius who now looked slightly pissed off. Harry gulped and Sirius's face loosened slightly. "We can't. I will allow you to use this once, and only once. On your wedding day. If Moony taught me anything, and he did teach me a lot of things really, is that sometimes you can't do something even if it seemed like a really good prank at the time and would knock the socks off of Evans for James- the idea can be really stupid and end up with someone getting hurt."
Harry looked up and saw Mrs Weasley, staring right back at him. She gestured for him to come and stand by her, so he reluctantly walked over and was engulfed in hugs. He didn't want to look at the body. It was his fault that a Weasley was dead. All they had ever done was protect, feed and love him like their own, and this is how he repays them.
"But I thought they hated each other?" Ginny asked as Hermione shut the door. "Things change," Hermione shrugged. "People change."
"So, Potter. New evidence of your homosexuality eh? I wonder where that came from. Shame your face wasn't in it too Malfoy else you could have kept your father's empty cell company! I'm sure Potter here would have a cell exactly like it, just way on the other side of Azkaban!" He chuckled cruelly. "You really think that they would lock Harry up in a cell after he defeated your master?" Draco scoffed.
"Harry, you can talk to me you know, what's going on?" She asked, placing a comforting hand on his. Well, if Malfoy didn't run away, why would Hermione? "I've had some... issues, after the war. I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that happened, I couldn't even bring myself to look at the Weasley's," he sighed. "I sort of became a bit... depressed, I suppose. And when I went back to Privet Drive, it didn't help." Hermione looked at Harry, comfortingly. So far so good.
The students all filed into the classroom and chose their seats. Harry quickly sat at the far back corner, not wanting to have a spotlight cast on him this year. But, none the less, the new teacher walked in and immediately requested that Harry come and sit at the front of the room. "Can't have our brightest student be hiding in the back now, can we?" The new professor smiled. Harry sat down in his seat between Ron and Draco and sunk down.
Malfoy had run away. Harry knew it, after all who would want to share a room with a horrible creature like him. Malfoy was going to tell McGonagoll and he would be kicked out of Hogwarts, for sure. For killing all of them. Harry heard the door open and looked up. Malfoy had come in, a worried look on his face.
His father and his friends had been those bullies, but Harry didn't want to talk about that right now. "It's so beautiful," Harry said, complimenting the night sky. "I know something that's even more beautiful!" Draco smiled, and Harry who was caught up in the stars just replied. "What?"
Harry woke up suddenly, someone shaking his shoulders. Harry opened his eyes and grabbed his glasses, shoving them on his face. Draco Malfoy stood above him, a worried expression on his face. "It was just a bad dream, don't worry." Malfoy whispered. Harry, still breathing hard, didn't hear him.
Harry nodded and said his goodbyes to Sirius before going into the bathroom to clean up his hands. Draco was in there with a towel wrapped around his waist and his wet hair flopping over his forehead. Harry just stared at this beauty in front of him; his hair, his eyes, his lips, his face... His abs. Harry drew in a sharp breath, blushing at his own thoughts.
There were many confused and outraged faces directed towards Umbridge, but she just stayed sat there, smiling. "And what proof do you have of this Mr Potter? None. And let us not forget that you broke into the Ministry a while back, pretending to be a different person by use of the polyjuice potion and assaulted me in this very courtroom!"
Harry just stayed silent and watched as Hermione Came in and sat down. "You know what just happened Mione? Harry asked Ginny to go to the party together!" Ron smiled. "Oh, really?" She asked and gave Harry a death stare when she saw that he had put the grape on his plate. "Yeah," he replied, watching her put some eggs and bacon onto his plate. "Well, good for you." She smiled at him, but her eyes told a different story.
He held out a hand to help Harry up, but Harry misread the gesture and flinched away, trying to get as far away from the other boy as possible. "Potter, let me help you. Tell me who did all that to you and we can fix it." Harry shook his head frantically. Why did Malfoy care so much? Why, after all this time, was he being nice now? "Potter talk to me!" Malfoy now shouted.
Harry felt too sore to move, but then remembered the letter he had hid earlier. He grabbed his wand from his pocket, pointed at the places he knew were definitely broken, and fixed them with wordless spells. He slowly got up and stumbled over to the loose floorboard and grabbed the letter. It was no doubt, a letter saying he was going to Azkaban for killing hundreds of people.
Harry found out that Slughorn was hosting the party and it was strictly boy-girl. Harry knew what he had to do, even if he didn't want to do it. So, during breakfast he dragged himself over to the Gryffindor table and pulled Ginny to the side.
Thoughts of guilt and pain intruded Harry's mind, and he quickly ran into his dorm room before he made a fool of himself in front of everyone else. He had hoped Draco would be in there, but no such luck. Harry tried to control his breathing, digging through his things for something. At last, at the very bottom of his trunk, he found the shard of mirror that was connected to another.
But Anthony's words always echoed in his head and he was brought back to the real life where what was illegal, was illegal. But when had Ron ever actually listened to the rules? He and his friends had broken pretty much every single school rule there was and he didn't as much bat an eyelid.
Draco had a smug smirk set upon his face and he chuckled "Aw, Potter has feelings for me! How sweet!"
Once he had calmed down he sighed happily and fell into Draco for a hug. "Harry, we're in public!" Draco gasped, jumping back and looking around frantically. "We're in Muggle civilization, Draco. The laws are different here. Come on, I know where we are, there's a nice café around the corner and I need a drink." Harry said softly and took Draco's hand before dragging him away.
Without thinking, Harry ran and threw his arms around him, not wanting to let go, to lose him again. "How!" Harry gasped. "I'll leave you two alone." McGonogall smiled. "Oh, Harry. He's only just got here. Fumbled through my fireplace. He doesn't know what's happened the years he's been gone. I would explain, but I think it's best that you do." She nodded and walked out, closing the door.
"Good evening all. I have a couple of things to say before we start our well needed feast. As you all know, terrible, terrible events happened at our school in the earlier May, and we suffered horrible losses. We have rebuilt our school, stronger than ever before. Our 8th years who have come back, the north east tower has been devoted to you for your dormitories and common room. All houses will stay in the same tower. You have each been put with one other person to share a room. Our caretaker Filch has asked me to remind you, no supplies from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes or Zonko's joke shop are to be allowed inside the castle. The forbidden forest is still, out of bounds. May the feast commence!"
Harry found Ginny at lunch and made plans to meet up with her in the Gryffindor common room later that evening. That girl really did not know what she had coming.
"What are you smiling about? You don't deserve to be happy," he scoffed, sneering at Harry. Uncle Vernon looked up and Harry quickly wiped the smile off his face. "Come on Dudley, we're going to teach the boy a lesson." Vernon smirked. Harry tried to run up to his room, but the two whale sized men followed him and pushed him to the ground. As they were beating him, Harry tried to crawl over to his trunk that was set in the corner of his bedroom. With one final hard kick and punch from the two Dursley men, Harry apperated to Kings Cross. He quickly jumped up and casted a glamour on himself, so the marks from recent and previous events wouldn't show.
"Well, duh. I'd been forced to live with them my whole life by Dumbledore. They are, unfortunately, my family of sorts." Harry said, then quickly throwing his hand over his mouth, realizing what he had said. "It was those muggles? They did that to you?" Draco asked, anger boiling up inside, making his face go red. "I swear to MERLIN, I am going to MURDER that big piece of-" Harry quickly intervened, not wanting things to get out of hand.
He finally left the common room, him and Sirius still glaring daggers at each other. Harry unfolded the parchment and stared at it puzzled
A sudden anger boiled up inside Harry. He felt like screaming at her, letting it all out. But what good would that do? "I'm okay." He simply said. "Gosh Harry, your voice sounds awful." She said, getting a glass of water for Harry. He sipped it and heard Malfoy come out of the bathroom. "What do you expect he hadn't spoken a word for 4 months." He scoffed. Hermione looked round at Harry surprised. "You haven't spoken since the battle? Why, Harry?" Harry glared at Draco. "Oh, sorry, I thought she knew," he admitted sheepishly.
Harry felt his heart start racing in his chest, this could be it! This could be the chance to finally be able to give his parents that warm embrace he had always given in his dreams. Harry snatched up the book and ran towards the Headmistress's office. "Professor!" Harry panted, startling a working McGonagall.
"Said yes." Harry smiled and watched as Hermione's face turned from utter confusion to pure glee. Harry almost fell off his chair when Hermione practically threw herself into him, engulfing him in hugs and squeals. Harry looked out the corner of his eye and saw Draco sitting at the next table, a smirk resting on his face.
"We're so sorry we haven't written Harry, we really wanted to, just..." Hermione started. "You reminded us of the war a bit. You understand, right?" Ron finished. Harry just nodded. He didn't have any energy to argue. His whole body ached, and it felt like he had a cracked rib. That, and he hadn't muttered a word in almost 4 months.

"Oh, Potter. Mind if I sit? Everywhere else is full." Malfoy asked. Harry slowly nodded his head. He knew that the blonde boy in front of him was forced into getting the dark mark. Harry saw the look on his face the night he was on the astronomy tower. He didn't belong with the others. His thoughts were finalised when Malfoy didn't out him when they were in Malfoy Manor after being caught by the snatchers.
"Short pale blonde hair, grey-blue eyes, a muscular build. Pointed jaw and firm hands, preferably in Slytherin, you know, more mischievous." Hermione started to giggle a lot, holding her stomach. "What?" Harry asked, confused. "What are you giggling at?" Hermione continued giggling and finally whispered "You just described a certain Draco Malfoy." Then she ran off as the bell went.

Harry paused for a moment, still strumming but in thought. "I suppose now the lyrics have changed. Let me just alter them slightly." He smiled, looking at Draco. Draco blushed, but never looked away still in awe of this boy who was so freaking talented, he just couldn't believe it.
"Darkness. Really catches your attention, doesn't it? Enlightens your senses. But sometimes, all we need is a little bit of light." A voice spoke, and the room was lit up by a thousand small, floating candles and presented what seemed to be a meadow with a picnic blanket set up not too far ahead.
"Woah, Potter, please, I actually like my face," Draco smirked. Harry rolled his eyes and started using simple transfiguration skills to change Draco's features. Once he was done, Malfoy no longer looked like Malfoy. Instead he had dark purple hair, twisted into loose curls, reaching his shoulders. His face was more heart shaped than pointed and had freckles scattered all over his face. His eyes were a light, chestnut brown. He didn't look like Draco at all.
Sirius Black watched through the hospital wings window as his Godson and the Malfoy boy exchanged kisses. Harry is going to have a hard time denying those charges when he is so clearly in love with that other boy.
Harry stayed sat on the bed, and touched his lips as they were still tingling. "Holy shit." Harry said to himself as he adjusted his glasses. For the time that he and Draco were together, Harry finally felt some shred of happiness somewhere inside him.
Harry changed himself back, washing away all glamours then put his hands gently on Draco's shoulders. Draco whipped around then looked at Harry, his face red and tear-stained. Harry threw his arms around Draco, soothingly stroking his hair.
"Why did you save me Draco?" Harry whispered."Huh?" Draco gasped, taken aback by the sudden question. "Why did you save me?" Harry repeated, louder this time.
"Oh, are all you Weasley's this dumb?" Draco sighed. "Just tell him Harry, he's never going to guess." Harry looked back at George who still looked confused. He took a deep breath and decided to tell the whole truth.
Draco clutched Harry's face, never wanting to let go and Harry ran his fingers through Draco's still silky hair, smiling into the kiss. "Okay, that's enough now! We get it, you're soulmates," Ron said, and Harry pulled away from Draco, who whimpered at the loss, but then remembered he was in the presence of other people and scrambled off of Harry's lap.
Harry smiled when they drew away and headed back to the eighth year table. "What was that, Harry?" Ron smirked as he sat down. "I asked Ginny to go to the party with me," Harry shrugged, and picked up a grape which he started to nibble on. "Nice, mate. You'll be the perfect pair, you know. You both support the gays for some reason," he said, muttering the last part and rolling his eyes.
"I think I'd prefer it if you were closer." Harry mumbled and Draco's body pressed up against his. Just when they were about to share their kiss, Harry switched their places so now Draco was up against the wall. "Aren't you forgetting?" Harry said, smirking. "I'm the guy in this relationship!"
"I was expelled mid-way through my fourth year at school and was so embarrassed that I wiped everyone's memories of me ever being there, destroyed all files. I was a Slytherin, best friends with Bellatrix Black. I was expelled because Bella wanted to do something dark and stupid and I was dragged into it, then the blame was placed on me when it backfired. I was expelled and my hatred for the wizarding world grew and it has still been growing ever since."
"Draco, are you okay?" Harry asked nervously. "Yes, why wouldn't I be?" He chuckled. "I just thought... The whole reason we were in our room that night... on Halloween, was because we had heard your father escaped from Azkaban. Have you heard anymore about it?" Harry questioned, looking into those bedazzling grey eyes.
"What do you mean I'm right?" Hermione asked. "Barton was a death eater. He was at Malfoy Manor a couple of times. He was apparently under the imperius curse and was never even given the mark. You-know-who thought he was too pathetic to receive his mark." Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at Malfoy in shock. "Close your mouths, your gonna catch flies." Malfoy said, rolling his eyes. "Why would McGonagall hire an ex death eater?" Ron asked. "Only The Dark Lord, Bellatrix, Mother, Father and I knew who he was. He was too cowardly to even show up in the war." Draco said, then left without another word.
"Speaking of mum and dad, have you seen them?" Harry asked as they made their way back to the crowd. "Actually, yeah. James popped up for a mere few seconds and told me that they had used most of their time and that they would not be able to visit for quite a long while. They're still watching over us though, Harry." Sirius smiled sadly.
"No, of course not!" Fudge snapped, his face turning beet red reminding Harry of his uncle, which just angered him more. "We are real people with real emotions and if you can't see that, then maybe you are the one who needs to be locked away! Not us!" Harry's comments made everybody gasp and some even looked confused, as if they had taken in Harry's words and were questioning everything that had ever been taught to them about the gay agenda. However, Fudge still had a cold, harsh look upon his face. "How dare you talk to me like that! I am the minister of ma-"
Ginny threw the door open, ran in and hugged Neville. Harry watched from the doorway, amused. "Thank you for being so understanding, Neville. If you ever need anything, then don't hesitate to ask," Ginny smiled. "Well, I think I'm going to be needing a date to the party," he chuckled as the two girls shared a small kiss.
" Through sixth year, he became more and more unhealthy and thin and in the end, just wouldn't eat because he felt too sick. We thought it was because his father had died that summer, but it lasted throughout the whole year. He started to use glamours to hide himself, but that didn't go unnoticed by us. He stopped coming down to meals and either said he had already been or was going to go later."

"I know that you were under the curse," Harry smiled. "But I've been watching you and it didn't even look like you were trying to fight it. In some ways, I get it. The imperius curse makes you feel relaxed and free in your own mind. But it doesn't make the pain lessen for me, Draco. You haven't even the faintest idea of the thoughts that ran through my head during that time, with you gone, there was nobody there to keep me sane."
"Hi Draco," said Harry, so softly the addressed boy barely heard. It was the warm butterflies in his stomach that made him turn around. "I just wanted to say that I understand why you did what you did. I'm pathetic and it'd be really easy to toy with my emotions, it was an opportunity you just couldn't pass."
She turned to a marked page in the book and her eyes started to scan the page, silently reading. "Is this normal?" Draco whispered to Harry. "Pretty much. Though, she's never tried to punch me and Ron!" Harry laughed and Draco flicked his ear. Hermione gasped and then giggled excitedly. "What?" Harry asked impatiently. "Let me see your wrists, both of you!" She said, but before either of them could even choose to comply, she grabbed Harry's arm and pointed her wand to it, ignoring the scars and muttering some words in latin.
He stepped out of a ministry fireplace just as Draco came whizzing down followed shortly by Sirius. They both looked worriedly at Harry who had began to walk and was no sooner bombarded by witches and wizards. "Foul, unnatural boy! You should have been locked up!" A witch with dark violet robes snapped at him. "Be careful or I might just kiss a boy in front of your children!" Harry said sarcastically and chuckled as the witch squealed and fled.
"So we can't go together anymore?" She laughed lightly. Harry awkwardly chuckled, glad that she wasn't throwing shoes at him across the room. "What's your plan? To be able to go with him? You know you could be arrested for being seen with whoever it is?" Harry hastily explained his plan as she nodded along.
He missed running his fingers through Draco's soft, silky hair and his soft, thin lips that were just perfect for kissing. He missed that stupid, smug smirk that played on his lips that he pretended to hate but actually loved.
"Haven't you read the Daily Prophet or Witch Weekly?" Harry asked, his heart thumping against his chest and suddenly feeling rather queasy. "No, I cancelled my subscriptions after... well," Molly said sadly. "Oh, er-well, you see- it is true," Harry gulped. "Oh, okay then!" Molly smiled. "You're- you're okay with it?" Harry choked, completely relieved. "Oh of course I am! This does not change you as the sweet, brave boy I've come to love as my own son!" Molly said and Harry jumped in with a big hug. "Thank you." He whispered.

"Wait, what?" Draco said. "I'm going to need you to come with me Potter! You are going to Azkaban, I believe there is a cell empty next to the one where your Godfather will be sent to after his trial!" Fudge snarled, chuckling maliciously. He moved to grab Harry, but Draco shot in-between them, growling and snarling. Fudge looked shocked and tried to push Draco out of the way, but Harry buried this feeling of wanting to attack and rip the face off of he minister and grabbed Draco lightly and pulled him behind. They couldn't risk being exposed.
Ron looked at her in pure shock, before spinning and starting to run out when he felt Harry's hand on his shoulder. "Please, Ron. I'm willing to forgive if you can learn to accept me. I don't want to lose you now, after everything we've been through together. You're my best friend Ron. You've helped me through dark times and I've helped you through yours. Please don't throw away these past eight years over some small thing. I need you Ron and you need me too."
"Harry!" Harry was rattled out of his train of thoughts by Sirius shouting at him. "It was my fault you died," Harry whispered, involuntary tears escaping his eyes. "I'm not dead, Harry." Sirius smiled warmly and Harry nodded numbly.
"Hermione. You come from the Muggle world, you had a good upbringing, nice parents so when did your forget how to FUCKING KNOCK!" Harry groaned, annoyed that his almost-kiss with Draco was interrupted because that was so what he needed right now. He turned around too as Draco pulled on his clothes. "Sorry! But I think I've found out something really important! Are we okay to look?" She asked. "Yeah, alright."
"I'm the worst friend, the worst brother, the worst boyfriend! How is Hermione?" He asked nervously. "She refused to talk about you. Would only stay with us if we spoke about something else. You really hurt her, Ron. You hurt everybody and if you can ever accept the idea that Harry can be with whoever he wants and go back to Hogwarts, then you're going to have a hell of a lot of work to do."
"Goodbye, Draco." Harry's final words crashed through him like a million shards of ice and before he could even process the thought, the boy he loved was gone. Gone. He couldn't just be gone, there was so much left to do, so much left to say! Harry needed to know the truth and Draco knew just how to do that.
"That isn't soon enough," Harry grumbled, but let himself be pulled into a hug by his soulmate nonetheless. "Just until tomorrow." Draco smiled. "Tomorrow." Harry nodded and watched as Draco walked away towards his mother and then apparated away. "Damn you have it bad! I don't think I ever even saw James look at Lily that way and they were in l.o.v.e, love!" Sirius laughed.
"Too soon for jokes? Okay." He smiled. Hermione and Ginny sighed, relieved that Harry was up and talking. Harry looked up and saw Draco looking at him in a kind of awe. "What, what is it?" He asked. "You made a joke! Sure, it wasn't appropriate for the time, but it's still progress!" Draco grinned childishly. "Oh!" Harry said, blushing.
"Uh, Harry. Dean and Seamus have had a secret relationship going on for months now. Only Neville and I know, you cannot tell anyone! They could get arrested! It's horrific." She whispered. Harry nodded his head curtly. "Uh, Hermione, why are we at the library? We have defence in ten minutes," Harry said. "Well, now that it's been brought up, I want to check the laws. Surely, there can't be a proper valid reason for not letting people love who they want to love. You've let out the monster in me Harry." She laughed.
"Hey Gin, I was wondering, do you want to come to the Halloween party with me?" He asked. "I thought you'd never ask," She smiled, and pulled Harry into a long kiss. Harry, reluctantly, kissed back, not wanting to show any suspicion.
And he did.
Harry had expected people to curse him, to shoot spells at him or scream in his face, but instead they all thanked him and attempted to shake his hand until he had no space left to breathe. "Please, a little space!" He managed to squeak out as his anxiety rose, but nobody heard him. "Excuse me," he said a little louder, trying to push through the crowd. "Please, let me through." He said a little louder and looked up, to see warm, mercury eyes catch his panicked emerald green ones.
Harry lead Sirius to the eighth year table where the students around then scuttled away. "I can't believe you would do something like that Harry." Sirius sighed, putting a sandwich on his Godsons plate. "It's alright, they need to know-"
Draco passed Harry his glasses and as soon as Harry put them on, he grabbed Draco's face and pulled him into a kiss. Although he hurt all over, Harry felt light and free. Draco pulled away and sat on the edge of Harry's bed. "Easy tiger," Draco smirked. "You can't go all 'hard ass' now, I heard every single thing you said to me whilst I was out," Harry grinned devishly. Draco blushed hard, but didn't break eye contact with Harry.
Harry smiled and offered his hand out to Draco. "Care for a dance, m'lady?" He asked formally. "Why, of course!" Draco giggled and they walked onto the dance floor. A slow song started playing so Draco put his hands around Harry's neck.
Draco let go and Harry lay back down, exhausted and felt a hand take his and squeeze it gently. "What happened?" The nurse asked. "Harry woke up and I think something triggered his PTSD. He was saying the names of all the... Deceased people and sorry over and over again. A flashback. I think it may have been his head hurting because he was clutching his forehead and screaming," Draco answered.
When the dementor disappeared. Harry's eyes flew open and he saw... A stag? The Dementors had all been cleared away as questions roamed through Harry's head. Dad? Has he come back too?
And there stood Ronald Weasley, the boy who had betrayed Harry's trust."Where's Harry?" The ginger snarled, his eyes drawing away from the odd wolf. "Why on earth do you think I'd tell you?" Draco snarled, annoyed glints in his eyes. "It's none of your business!" Ron said, but knew that he was wrong.
"Sirius? Sirius!" Harry gasped, holding onto the bed post as he slid onto the floor. And image showed on the mirror which didn't show Harry's reflection, but his Godfather's face which was of complete shock. "Harry! What is it, are you okay?" Sirius said. "I- I- I can't!" Harry gasped again, choking on his own breath. The mirrors edges started to dig into his palms, drawing blood.
"I know that Ronald. I spoke to her too, she knew about it all along. She was completely fine with it, she never really liked Harry like that in the first place she just thought that it would make you happy!" Once again, Ron groaned at his stupidity.
"Get him a cup of water," Draco ordered, taking Harry's robes off, then his top and taking mumbling calm things to him, mopping his body with the sponge. He held Harry close to him as he started to calm down and took the glass of water from the Weasley.
Harry ran out of the bathroom and straight into McGonagoll. "Oh, Mr Potter. I've been tring to find you. Here is your timetable for this year. I think it would be time to start getting to your first lesson." She said and walked away. Harry looked down at his timetable. Defence against the dark arts first. Time to meet the new professor. Maybe, this one will last more than a year and not try to kill Harry like most of the others.
"No, I mean, look at me! Who would want to listen to me?" He sighed, guilty memories flooding his brain like a dam just broke. "What are you on about Harry?" She asked. He remembered the glamour and thought to himself. Hermione could accept him as gay, she didn't abandon him. Was there the slightest chance that she could see him as who he really was? A freak?
The sky darkened and the room was lit by only a few candles and the moon and stars. Harry and Draco sat down on the blanket and Draco took out some sandwiches and wine. "This is my favourite!" Harry grinned, his eyes on the bottle. "I know, that's why I got it!" Draco laughed huskily.
"I'm so happy for you two!" Sirius beamed as some kids quickly ran past him with squeals. The great hall doors flew open again and some Dementors glided in towards them, the floating candles all extinguishing a suffiecent coldness glooming over them. "No!" Harry shouted. "He's innocent!"
"Are we really going to allow him on the stands? Look at him, disgusting little gay boy, crying like the fairy he is!" A high pitched voice squealed from behind Fudge. Dolores Umbridge sat there, stupid little pink bow in her hair and ugly toad face scrunched up in disgust. "Gay?" Harry heard a gasp from the crowd and saw Molly Weasley looking as if she were trying to figure out a very difficult puzzle in her head. Sirius, Hermione and a few others let out cries of outrage and Harry felt more than saw Draco growling under his breath, ready to pounce if somebody said one more thing about his soulmate.
"How? I've started eating lunch again!" Harry complained. "And what do you eat for lunch, Mr Potter?" She prompted, as if holding such information was very valuable to her. "Quarter of a sandwich." Harry muttered. "What? Any more and I would just throw it all back up, wouldn't you rather I kept it down?" Sirius rolled his eyes and muttered in an annoyed tone "Just like your father."
'Room of requirement, 8:30pm- don't be late'.
Harry turned around to see Draco still with no top on, but with his trousers on at least. Harry blushed again at his bare chested boyfriend and Hermione rolled her eyes at the pair. They moved into the bedroom and sat down on one of the beds.
Pansy strolled up to Draco, acting as if she were the most important thing in the world and took Draco's face in her hands and kissed him. Draco did as he was told and complied to the kiss, no matter how disgusting it felt. He heard Harry's footsteps take off hurriedly, but he was told not to care. Potter didn't mean a thing to him, anymore.
Ginny and Harry headed down to the Great Hall with Hermione and Ron. Luna and Draco went down separately, both in disguise. Ginny and Luna had the same plan as Harry and Draco but Luna didn't know that Harry was also going off with someone else.
"Nah, mate. Everyone's going to be going as a zombie. Do something original." He smiled then walked out. "That was close," Hermione said, releasing the breath she didn't know she was holding. "Yeah," Harry agreed as he put his glamour back on.
"Snape's dead too, Sirius. And he wasn't bad. Dumbledore ordered him to kill him so Draco's soul would be protected from evil. You probably knew that Snape was in love with my Mum. He asked Voldemort to spare her and when he didn't, Snape became loyal to Dumbledore. He's sort of been helping us all along."
Sunday morning came and Harry walked downstairs to make the Dursley's breakfast before going to Kings Cross Station. Harry smiled to himself as he put the plates in front of Vernon, Dudley and Petunia and was about to walk away when Dudley spoke up.
Petunia signed again and stood up. "When you were first left on our doorstep, I was afraid of your powers, I could basically feel the magic radiating from you, so I put a block on your mind. Your magic goes way beyond the limits of a normal wizard, Harry. I know it would have been useful for fighting you-know-who, but I can remove the block now. I just need your wand." Harry hesitated, but then handed over his wand to his aunt's outstretched hand. "Reserare quod mente!" Petunia whispered while pointing the wand at Harry's head, but Harry did not feel any difference. "I don't feel any change?" Harry said, taking back his wand. "It'll take a while, a week or two maybe, but your full powers will be restored."
Harry felt his heart drop. He was planning on doing something special for Draco on Tuesday night, just to say thank you for everything. Now, he would have to change it to Wednesday night after Quidditch practise.
After a minute or two of watching students and teachers twirl on the dance floor, he felt a hand on his shoulder. "Draco!" Harry exclaimed, jumping up to see long, purple hair and chestnut brown eyes. "Who's this Draco? My name is Alex," Draco grinned. "Sorry I kept you waiting, girls like to gossip. They wanted to know all about me."
Harry lifted up his top and showed Hermione the multiple whip marks living on his back. The tears started to roll freely and Hermione engulfed Harry into a massive hug, sobbing into his jumper. "That's why you haven't been eating. I knew something was up, and I didn't act on it sooner!" She cried.
"Well, let's try now," Harry smiled. Draco picked up his wand and he and Harry stood up. "Think of your happiest memory then say the incantation 'Expecto Patronum'. It's alright if you don't get it first try, that's completely normal." Draco closed his eyes and concentrated. "Expecto Patronum!" He stated and a small silver whisp came out the end of his wand like some deformed fog.
"Sorry Professor, not in the mood to deflect curses today," Harry shrugged. "Alright then," Barton said to Harry's surprise. "Mr Weasley!"
"It's all my fault, it's all my fault, IT'S ALL MY FAULT!" He screamed. George stared at Harry in shock, unsure what to do. Harry started hyperventilating, breaths coming short, and he sat down on his knees, knowing his legs wouldn't support him.
"But Professor, you aren't allowed to do that! It's illegal!" Hermione gasped. "I'm aware of that Miss Granger, I am the Professor here. Which also means I know a way of doing it without causing too much pain. It's all for the greater good." He smirked then turned his glare towards Harry. "Mr Potter, would you be so kind as to join me up here?"
Harry stopped again and pulled his wand out. This was it, the big reveal. He wiped his glamour away and Hermione burst out crying. "Sometimes, the abuse wouldn't be so bad and sometimes it would be things you would usually go to the hospital for. Broken ribs, too much blood loss. But, magic had to fix most of it. Petunia found the way she liked to do it and did it every time she could,"
Ron had done some serious thinking after he came home from Hogwarts. He had just left his best friend and girlfriend at school after learning one simple secret. Sometimes he kicked himself for doing something so stupid, but then the memory of why he did it came back and he just didn't care.
Harry stared at the letter in complete silence as into dropped into the bowl of waffles. "This has to stay between us all, okay?" Harry whispered. His friends all nodded and Hermione went to talk, but Harry cut her off. "We'll talk about it later." He muttered quickly, seeing McGonagoll walking quickly towards them. He shoved the letter in his bag then picked up his fork and started prodding at his bacon.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
Harry watched out the corner of his eye as Malfoy sat down next to Blaise Zabini, another 8th year. Ron and Hermione Came running in and sat opposite harry. "We're so sorry Harry, we had to.." but Hermione was cut off as McGonagoll stood up and began the sorting. Once all of the new students had sat down, the headmistress continued to stand at the front.
Harry's jaw dropped t the floor. "B-but, Mum, Dad- Remus! We could touch them, hug them as if they were really there!" He said, grinning at the fantasy. "Exactly, Harry. As if they were there. Once they have to go again, the grief will just hit us ten times harder than before. As much as I would absolutely love to sit down and have a butterbeer with my best friends again, we can't. Especially with the emotional range you're in right now. Hermione told me something happened and it really broke you."
"When you were born, one of my biggest wishes was that you would grow up to be like Lily. I was a reckless kid, absolutely reckless- I enjoyed it of course, don't get me wrong, but I was definitely stupid at times.
"And what I need is for you two boys to stop being such adorable saps and come and join the rest of the party! We're headed back to Grimmauld Place for celebrations, you up for it?" Sirius smiled, turning the corner and causing Draco and Harry to leap apart. "Of course," Harry smiled. "Actually, I think I am going to head back to Malfoy Manor with my mother. For those who don't know about us yet, and that is the majority, I don't think having a Malfoy turn up at the party would be great fun for them." Draco shrugged and Harry pouted. "Now don't give me that look, I will see you tomorrow back at Hogwarts!" Draco chuckled.
"Touch him and I swear to God, I will rip your head off of your fucking neck," Hermione growled as she and Ron stepped defensively either side of the raven haired boy. "No, it wasn't me!" Draco whined.
"They can't put you in Azkaban, Harry, can they? I mean, you saved the wizarding world! Harry, you could probably do this!" She squeaked. "No, I can't," Harry whispered quietly. "What? Yes, you can Harry!" She smiled.
"Fine, Potter. I will let you walk free with a mind healer- but mark my words! This does not change a thing about the laws and so long as I am in power, they never will change!" Fudge grunted and stormed away. Harry grinned as a few workers came down to shake his hand. "I thought that you guys think that I was contagious?" Harry questioned. "Oh, no, most of us don't believe that anymore, we all agree with everything you said!" The same mousy looking woman squeaked. "Oh, well thank you... Uh-"
"A dares a dare," Harry shrugged, winking then kissing Malfoy on the forehead, nose, cheek and then lips. "Scared Malfoy?" Harry asked, smirking as he pulled Draco closer. "You wish." He grinned.
So now, after watching him closely for a couple of minutes to make sure he was alright and stable, Draco carried on with his childish fort. When Harry awoke, his body ached immensely, but he didn't care. In fact, what he saw when he opened his eyes made him first lie there dumbly in shock then grin like a chimpanzee.
Harry and Sirius were left standing alone in the corridor. "I'd like to show you something Harry." Sirius said as he passed into McGonogall's empty office. He lead Harry to the pensive and extracted some memories from his head. "Watch these." He smiled sadly, and Harry gently pushed his head through the breaking waters of the pensive.
Gasps and screams echoed from all around the room, wands were whipped out, but Sirius just headed straight for Harry. "Oh my!" Hermione gasped, leaping up. Harry stood up too, his stomach contracting in fear when Sirius knocked him into a massive bear hug. "Sirius, what are you-"
Harry paired up with Hermione whilst Ron went with Seamus. They went to get their ingredients, and Harry prepared them whilst Hermione brewed.
Sirius scoffed. "Know each other? Archie Barton practically grew up in my house. Regulus's best friend. He gave me this!" Sirius lifted his hair up to show a ghastly scar on the back of his neck.
Mr Dursley gulped, his eyes not leaving Draco's wand, not even for a second. "Draco," warned Harry. "You don't need to, it's fine, just let them go and get on with their miserable lives." By then, Petunia Dursley had come striding in, almost collapsing in alarm when she saw the sight in front of her. "Mrs Dursley, how nice to see you!" Mocked Draco, smiling enthusiastically. "My mother was in your sister's year at Hogwarts you know, they were quite good friends until my father chose her as his bride."
"What do you mean 'in the hospital'?" Sirius asked, standing up. "You didn't tell your Godfather about Halloween?" McGonogall asked, raising a brow. "No, and it's okay, really, he doesn't need to know!" He rushed.
"Yeah. Before the battle started, Ron and I came up here. We thought we were never going to see this room again, so we decided to leave a piece of us in here. I saw my Dad's but I didn't realise that it was him," Harry nodded. "Your Dad and us also did this," Sirius said, getting up and pushing a wardrobe out the way.
