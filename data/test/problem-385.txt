His descent lasted seconds, centuries, and no time at all until he landed in a place unlike any he had ever seen.
Slowly, Harry stood. He was surrounded by a sea of trees so tall, it seemed as though they might actually touch the sky. The leaves were every shade of red and orange, almost resembling flames blowing gently in the breeze.
When he reached the bottom, Harry couldn't help but laugh exuberantly, even as he winced slightly from the impact. He was sure there would be bruises tomorrow, but it had been worth it.
"Trail? What trail?" Harry asked, holding the note as though it would answer him. Suddenly, threads of colourful lights appeared, intertwining until they resembled a swirling rainbow, only with many more colours. Harry was enraptured as a breeze swept through the forest, causing the rainbow to bend and sway. Unable to help himself, Harry put his hand into the stream of light. Although the rainbow moved with his hand as it had with the wind, it refused to stray from wherever it was meant to lead him.
Lucius turned and seated himself calmly at his desk. The only sound in the room was the scratching of quill against parchment, and Draco knew he was dismissed.
He looked up, only to find that his boyfriend was standing right in front of him, shaking with laughter.
“Back in... when? To before I died?” Confusion swirled in his mind. It was too much to handle. Even if he did go back to that day, the most he would be able to do was escape his own death. He wouldn’t be able to save anyone… Harry would still die, and Voldemort would still win. There would be no point.
With a sudden inspiration, Draco said, “Yes, Kreacher, there is something I would like you to do for me,” feeling a pang of sympathy when the elf perked up immediately, “I would like you to carry a message to Sirius Black in Azkaban.”
Ignoring Draco’s stunned expression, Olivander rang up the purchase and bid him farewell. Draco stood in shock just outside of the shop for several minutes. The wand that had chosen him, chose those with character and loyalty? Ever since his death, Draco had been wrapped in self-loathing. It had faded to the background in the time since his rebirth, but it was still very much there. To hear that his wand would not have likely chosen a dark wizard was a gift he hadn’t expected or known that he needed.
Draco nodded stiffly. He had been rather angry when he learned that not only had Harry been abused, no one had thought to help him. That was the most regret he’d ever felt about losing Harry’s friendship. If they’d been friends, Draco would have done whatever was necessary to spare him that treatment.
“The war did not end as it should have. With your help, I see a change to rewrite and restore destiny, and the fate of our world along with it.”
Draco mentally cursed himself; he should have known there would be a price to pay for a chance like this. He motioned for Merlin to continue, bracing himself for anything.
A crash echoed throughout the room as the door flew open, revealing his godson Draco. The boy’s face was as emotionless as ever, but his eyes and magic were swimming with fury.
"Fine, Harry. I'm not made of glass." He could hear the smirk in Draco's voice. "Take care of him and get me out of here, yeah?"
Suddenly, Draco remembered the hand still resting on his shoulder. Unsure of what to say, he looked up, only to be completely floored by the depths of the concern in Merlin’s eyes.
Sirius straightened and clasped Harry's shoulder, a mischievous gleam in his eye. "Now, I want to tell you about the Room of Requirement. Have you ever heard of it?"
While Draco had been terrified when he'd first been captured, that was no longer the case. Now, looking up at snake-face himself, Draco was royally pissed off.
Draco nodded, his heart glowing from such a simple statement. No one had ever absolved him of his family’s crimes before, past life or otherwise. Even though Harry knew next to nothing about the wrongs his family had done, it still felt nice to not be immediately distrusted.
Harry is going to have to have a couple of difficult conversations today. But on the bright side, Umbridge is missing!
Miss Ames looked up in shock, her face nearly entirely red with embarrassment. She fumbled with her wand for a moment before giving it a wave, causing all of the pairs to rush back to the shelves and place themselves neatly in a spot.
While only a few days had passed since the confrontation with Umbridge, life at Hogwarts had taken a dramatic shift. It was assumed that Draco was hiding out due to the incident in the Great Hall, so no one was particularly concerned. The main focus of the school at the moment was the fact that Umbridge was no longer terrorizing the halls.
As night fell on Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry a lone figure wandered the halls. Draco Malfoy had been assigned to patrol the halls after curfew and bring anyone he caught to Umbridge immediately. As he walked, he looked down briefly at the badge Umbridge had given him. Silently, he cursed the badge, Umbridge, and everything about his current life. He sighed in resignation, there was no point in dwelling on it all. As he continued walking, he drifted into a state of thoughtlessness, only paying enough attention to his surroundings to avoid running into walls.
“There were records of this place and its history in the Black Family Vault that I inherited from Sirius. Eduardus Limette Black was a historian and loved to travel to various wizarding countries and communities, learning their ways and documenting their history. Eventually, his travels led him here. When Eduardus first heard the tales of the two lovers, their tragedy, and the Devas, he was skeptical. He came to investigate and found that he could see the Devas, due to his power as a True Seer. Over the next several years, he learned the ways of the people and the Devas. Learning from the Devas, he helped to make the forest and the land around it flourish. As a gift, the Devas gave him their memories. He learned everything that had happened, and he wrote it all down. His parents later disowned him; he had married a witch who was poor and a half-blood, and as such beneath their status. Eduardus didn’t care, however, and he remained in the village for the rest of his life.”
Draco hesitated, as though not trusting what Harry was saying, “Well… yes you did. But why aren’t you angry?”
This was supposed to be his vacation! His and Harry’s first vacation as a couple! He’d been ecstatic when his boyfriend of nearly a year had proposed they take a holiday together. Yet instead of relaxing in a spa, getting a massage, or shagging in their hotel room, he was traipsing after his raven-haired boyfriend through a bloody rainforest.
Draco started to protest, but his mother cut him off, bending to whisper in his ear, “Your father isn’t here, and he need not know. You’re just a boy, and I want you to be able to act like one. I trust you to make wise decisions with this money.”
Kreacher looked to where Draco pointed and nodded his head, “All humans is being tall to Kreacher,  but that man is being much too tall."
Harry laughed at the simplicity of the message; clearly, his soulmate had thought the same thing he had and decided to test the theory. He waited to see if the word would disappear, allowing him to write another message, but it didn’t.
“About your father and everything. I mean, I’m sure you can hold off for a bit. He’s not going to try to make you a death eater tomorrow. But how are you going to handle it? What do you plan to do afterwards?”
“Do not worry, I do not intend to deny you this chance if you do not agree to my request. It is one I must make nevertheless. For too long now, our world has been divided. Houses at Hogwarts, blood-status, light and dark, good and evil. This is not the way the world works. One madman has convinced the world that all Slytherins are evil, choosing to ignore that I myself was a Slytherin.”
His love for places like this was something only Draco knew. When the wind blew and Harry closed his eyes, breathing in the scented air, it was almost as though something was calling to him, awakening his soul and rejuvenating his mind and body. He didn't know if it was magic or just his imagination, but when that feeling swept over him, it felt as though the forest had a life and spirit of its own.
Shaking his head, “Alright Potter, it’s not that funny. You caught me off guard. Now, will you please calm yourself and explain what this place is? Surely an average sitting room wouldn’t need an invisible door.”
When Harry got to the front, he was met by a mortified Miss Ames. The woman’s face was flushed and her blue eyes glistened with unshed tears, “I’m so so sorry Mr. Potter! That was inexcusable and shameful of me! To think I didn’t even notice when
This will most likely be a pretty long fic. It will also likely get darker over time. I’m not quite sure how much as of yet, which is why the tags are pretty generic. When needed, I will change them.
Draco swallowed and stood straighter, “Hello, Kreacher. Thank you for allowing me entry into the home of your late Mistress, Lady Walburga.”
Suddenly, Hagrid spoke up, “Well, here ye are. I’ll be headin’ off fer a bit. Figure I might as well pick up some supplies for the school, long as I’m here an’ all. I’ll be back when yer done.”
Tears flowed freely from Draco’s eyes. Why had Harry brought him here? He struggled to free himself from Harry’s embrace, wanting to escape the feeling of despair.
Draco felt as though his breath was ripped out of him as he was hurled across the room. Seconds later, pain and white burst behind his eyes, his head making a sickening
Draco turned, facing his mother and smiling in gratitude. After a moment, his happiness turned to fear, “Is anything wrong? Where is Father?” he asked, worried about being caught with the Boy Who Lived, not to mention Hagrid, whom his father detested.
Harry tried to protest, but Draco wouldn’t let him get a word in. After a few minutes, Harry decided to try again,  “Draco,” Harry said, but it went unnoticed in the other boys’ ranting. “Draco!” Harry shouted, causing the frantic blond to pause mid-sentence. Harry smiled as Draco blinked his eyes in apparent shock. “I’m not angry with you. I told you I would be back, didn’t I?
Kreacher didn’t hesitate and seemed almost offended, “Kreacher is being a good house-elf. Kreacher would never betray his master.”
“Do you smell that?” Draco sniffed the air, curiosity growing by the second. Honeysuckle? No…something similar…but not quite.
Draco forced himself to stand. Muddled as he was, he was grateful that he remembered the things he had learned in his past life. If he hadn’t, and he had stayed on the floor, Merlin only knew what his father would have done to him.
Harry and Draco spent three days worshiping each other. Such was their reverence, it was as if each was learning the others’ body for the first time.
Draco sighed in frustration and decided to focus his attention on Harry’s arse, rather than the trees. It was certainly a more pleasant sight. Perhaps he would take revenge on his lovely boyfriend later in the evening. He did so enjoy making Harry beg for him. His mood improved drastically as he began to picture all of the delicious ways he could torment his lover.
Floored at the casual use of his first name by his long-time rival, Draco forced himself forward, entering the room with all of the Malfoy-bred confidence he could muster.
“I’ve been doing some thinking about what you said, Hermione. I never took the time to explain why I was so angry and everything that had happened. I lashed out. So I’m going to tell you everything, and I want you to listen until I’m done. Can you two do that?” He asked, looking at them expectantly. They nodded without a moment’s hesitation.
He almost felt relieved, although he knew he should have been punished for all the things he had done.
Hi! I'm so sorry for the cliffhanger! I hope this chapter is good enough to make up for it! Please review either way! Love you!
Several minutes passed in silence before Merlin continued. “Humans have free will, allowing us to make our own decisions. However, each decision has a guaranteed outcome, which can only come to pass if the decision is made. Some things are set in stone by decisions made long before us. But there are times where, when we choose a different action, we can change our entire path as well. That is what I want you to do.”
After several minutes, he was finally able to calm down. He sat up, wiped tears of mirth from his eyes, and beamed at Draco, who was staring at him with his eyes wide and his mouth half-open in shock. “That’s just brilliant!”
Every time he started to wonder if they would accept the bond, he quickly shut the thought down, trying to convince himself that if he didn’t think about it, he wouldn’t hope for it, and it wouldn’t hurt when it didn’t happen.
Draco turned his head and glared daggers at his attacker; tree root, just big enough for his foot to fit in. He tried and failed for a few moments to remove his foot, quickly giving up and shouting, "Merlin's Balls! Harry will get your arse over here and HELP ME?!"
Beneath that was the immense joy that he finally had more of his parents to hang on to. As he was getting ready to leave the bank for the day, intending to come back tomorrow and decide what he wanted to take and what to keep safe, something caught his eye.
“Would you two cease that infernal arguing?” he groaned, slowly opening his eyes and glaring lightly at the pair of elves as his head began to throb. It was only as they went silent that he noticed another noise that he remembered vaguely from before he passed out. As he became fully conscious, he was surrounded by a melody so beautiful and peaceful, it brought tears to his eyes. He had never, in this life or the last, heard a comparable sound. It was then that he registered the soft weight against his chest. Lifting his head carefully, his eyes widened when they were met with the piercing blue eyes of his kitten Lyra. Only, something was different.
When they arrived in the common room, empty as Harry had hoped, they sat together in their favourite armchairs by the fire.
Harry turned to leave and Draco's hopes plummeted. He assumed this meant he was being rejected once again, and tried to keep from being overcome by the devastation until he was alone. He started when, as if hearing Draco's thoughts, Harry turned and spoke to him again, one hand on the curtain that separated them from the rest of the castle.
Before Draco could protest again, his mother blew him a kiss and bid him farewell, “Have fun, darling. I’ll see you this afternoon. It was lovely to meet you, Harry.”
He stopped pacing and turned to glare at his godfather. “And who are you to talk about bullying anyway? You ARE a bully! Potter was wrong to treat you as he did, but he was a kid! YOU’RE A PROFESSOR! You bully everyone who isn’t in Slytherin! You torment FIRST-YEARS, CHILDREN! You blame them for not paying attention and call them idiots, but the truth is, they most likely fail because of you! Students like Longbottom are so petrified of you that they can’t function, and students like Harry know they won’t get anywhere, so they don’t bother trying!”
Potter let go of Draco’s wrist but didn’t break eye contact while he spoke to his godson. “What’d you see, Teddy?” Harry asked, smiling even wider.
“Correct.” There was a pause, and Harry panicked, thinking their play might be over due to his indiscretion. However, much to his delight, only a moment later, he heard the delicious sounds of a belt being untethered from its loops.
They all moaned loudly, Neville and Theo, Draco and the rest of the voyeurs, when Theo was fully seated in Neville’s lap. Draco, who had originally watched to stave his own curiosity, had never thought that he’d
Draco snapped. He hadn’t wanted to, but he couldn’t help it. “Of course it does!” He felt his voice raise as it filled the room. “I don’t want to hurt someone. That’s not who I am anymore!”
Draco wanted to reach out, hug his friend and hold her tight and tell her that it was all going to be okay. But it wasn’t. Her parents barely spoke to her, in the same clipped tones his own parents used. He didn’t know how to comfort her, in the same way he didn’t know how to comfort himself. Instead, he usually lashed out, panicking, letting his magic running rampant out his veins.
Relief flooded through him when he immediately recognized the handwriting as Draco's. He leapt out of bed and dashed to the closet. After considering his options for several minutes, Harry decided on his nicest pair of black jeans and a dark green button-up. Casual or not, he still wanted to look presentable at the very least.
“What h…happened to the bodies? They aren’t buried here are they?” Draco asked, slightly frightened at the prospect.
'' in enormous gold letters. The whole thing was large enough that even Harry could see it clearly at a distance.
Saying nothing further, Draco stormed out of the room and slammed the door. Severus stared at the door in shock for several minutes before he returned to his desk and poured another stiff drink.
“Nothing…There’s nothing here!” Disbelief, anger, and fear gripped him all at once. If Harry had been having him on…..
My hope is that with everything balancing out here, and my lovely new beta Yuvika kicking me in the tail, it won't take me too long to update.
He frowned as he remembered that the only reason he’d been able to get glasses at all was that his teacher had noticed his tendency to squint and rub his eyes when he was trying to read. Harry would forever be grateful that his teacher had started sending letters home when she received no response. The Dursleys had been forced to act or face questions.
Really, what had death done to him, he thought to himself. It was common knowledge to every pure-blood that house-elves as a species needed to serve. To most, being free was more of a punishment than anything else, regardless of how they’d been treated. Draco couldn’t imagine how awful it must have been for Kreacher, bound to serve and yet alone in this house all this time. He nodded to himself; he could help Kreacher both by treating him kindly and tasking him as needed.
At this, Harry burst into laughter once again. Draco glared, “Just what on earth is so bloody funny!” he shouted. Harry said between laughs, “it’s just…you could have gotten out of there yourself if you had tried!”
“You’re about as intimidating as a toad as you are in human form… but very well,” he sighed, “have your say.”
The instant he picked it up, Harry felt as though he was yanked through the air at top speed. A moment later, he dropped to the ground. The hard landing knocked the wind right out of him, and he struggled to catch his breath for several minutes.
Frowning, Harry set the letter down and picked up the package. Turning it over in his hands, he realized it was a book. He was suspicious, but also curious. Hermione would probably skin him alive for this... He smiled at the thought and opened it.
In the silence, Harry picked up on a faint roaring sound. When his breathing and heart rate was steady again, he got up and continued on. With each step the roaring grew louder, until the forest came to a halt, revealing a large and beautiful river. He walked over to the stone bridge that connected the two sides, preparing to cross. However, when his foot touched the stone, a note and a bottle of water appeared, landing gently on the ground.
For half an hour, Draco read his magazine, resolutely ignoring the hoarse croaks from across the room. It was only when the toad was finally silent that he decided to look up.
"Bloody hell, Draco!" he shouted, just in case Draco was nearby, "A little warning next time! You know I hate-"
If he'd realized the truth... if he'd accepted it... abandoned his foolish childhood dream of his father's pride... then maybe...
“That’s not the only reason though!” Merlin insisted. “Harry’s life needs changing in ways he wouldn’t be able or willing to do. Because he was the only one who could defeat Voldemort, he was made to believe that was all he was useful for, and he came to believe it. Yet it was this exact belief that was his downfall in the end. He should have been nurtured, allowed to grow in his strength and confidence. Instead, he was sheltered, manipulated, and abused. No one, not even his friends, did anything to intervene.”
“Why are they helpful?” the girl in the middle asked, her voice high-pitched and a bit jarring on Draco’s ears.
“Tonight we’re playing Medusa,” she said to a room full of his classmates. “The rules are simple; I count, and on three you stare at the person you most desire to kiss. If your eyes are locked, you’re frozen until your lips touch.” She grinned devilishly, before adding, “Only use of your tongue can release you.”
Even though he was still positioned, his back straight and his arse resting on his heels, Draco could see the slightest tilt of Theo’s body as he leaned into Neville’s touch.
He countered his mother’s grimace with a smile. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to change before eating. If you’re still here when I get back, I’ll take that as your decision.”
He could feel it, buzzing right below his skin, waiting to ignite with just the tiniest of sparks, but Draco didn’t want that. He didn’t want to combust. Instead, he closed his eyes.
“You tell me, teach,” Draco snarled. His hands were shaking, and his cock was hard, harder than it had been in his previous memories. Harder than he thought he had ever been in his entire life.
“It’s Friday, and you know what that means!” Harry said, unable to control his joy. “That’s right, witches, wizards, and wixen all around, it’s time for
A fluffy chapter, with Luna and Rolf and Ginny and Pansy and Draco and Harry and Teddy! We're at the zoo, y'all!
Neville nodded in understanding. “My checklist was practically shredded to bits by the time I was done, so many erasure charms it was impossible to see the words at the end.” He pulled out his wand and leaned forward, tapping Draco’s sheet with the tip. Instantly, the parchment was duplicated, a copy appearing in Neville’s hand.
Draco spent the night tossing and turning, images of Neville’s shop filled with flowers, of the club, shelves filled with toys, of the man, spread and pink-cheeked and moaning.
Neville was seated when Draco walked in, and as promised, he was alone. “Prompt as always,” he smiled in greeting. “And looking quite handsome. Sit down. I thought we’d talk before trying anything out tonight.”
“More like…guidelines, or boundaries we set together.” Pansy shook her head and took another sip out of her glass. “I’m not explaining this right.”
Draco had spent a lifetime convincing himself: That he was better than everyone; that his family was royalty; that he could defeat whomever he wanted and bully whomever he wanted and that he would get married to a woman and have children that were better than everyone else, and that he definitely wasn’t…
“You’re so good, so hot, Potter,” his Master growled as he inserted his slick finger again. This time, instead of withdrawing, he twisted it upward, curling his finger as he teased the spot deep within him. Harry could feel the metal ring at the base of his Master’s long fingers, pressing against his needy hole. The thought of that pure symbol of their love made Harry feel so safe, so adored, and so ready to show his Sir how much he loved and needed him as well.
Daddy dom Neville and Theo in this chap, y'all! Full penetration, a bit of choking, and a good time had by all. Enjoy!!! Let me know what you think about our Daddy Neville, and his precious baby boy!
That night, he laid back on their bed, anxious to see Draco strut in those damnable fishnets he couldn’t get out of his head, and hopefully nothing else. Well, a black lace thong would also be nice, but he wasn’t going to get his hopes up that much.
Even through Draco’s trousers, Harry could tell the moment his hands reached the top of the fishnet stockings. He felt the ridge of lace, and with the pads of his fingers, Harry traced out the tiny green bow, the same one he’d stared at so many mornings in the drawer.
Still, he couldn’t pull his eyes away, or his hand away from his cock as he watched a couple so deeply in love as they made love in front of him. Neville’s hand had found their way from holding Theo’s to teasing his hole, and Draco rubbed the tip of his cock with his thumb to tease himself as well.
“We’re...not expecting guests for dinner, are we? If it’s Weasley, I need to double my recipe completely.”
Theo nodded, barely holding himself up as Neville thrust into him. Neville groaned as he came, his cock buried deep into Theo.
Without waiting for a response, Draco calmly strutted towards the door. Just as he was about to exit, he paused, turned his head and said over his shoulder, “Party should be interesting tonight. See you there.”
In a blink, Harry transformed Draco’s pristine trousers into an almost too-short pleated black skirt, complete with green hem. All at once, the stockings that he had admired for so long were finally on display.
Harry practically spun in his chair before pulling out the card Lee had handed him before the show. “Ah, and I see this week’s sponsor is
Then Neville did something Draco had imagined in one of his fantasies. He held Theo’s arms tightly at his sides, and began to feed him his cock.
Draco couldn’t sleep, though. Instead, he tossed and turned, wondering what the next day of hell would bring.
All of his tensions spilled out of him as Harry cried out in relief, his whole body focused on his Master’s touch, his fingers, his thighs. He felt so safe and adored as he was fulfilled with pleasure.
“Mmm, like when I make Pansy strip and tie her to a chair. Then I leave and steep my tea.” Ginny said with a grin.
“Since everyone loved Medusa, I thought we’d play another one,” Pansy called out, and why she was the ringleader for their sexcapades, Draco didn’t know. She gave Draco a quick wink before announcing, “We’re going to play Spin the Bottle!”
“Well, who knew I could spend 40 minutes talking about Neville and his Venomous Tentacula—which is quite large I might add—so now a quick word from our sponsors.
“You’ve been so good for me,” Sir spoke, and Harry’s skin broke out in goosebumps at that sultry voice. “Asking me to punish you.”
“Once I saw them, I couldn’t- ” Harry felt his cock twitch. “Oh, god, Draco, I couldn’t stop thinking about you stepping into them, your delicate toes.” He had pictured it so many times as he’d reached for the stockings, his fantasies running with abandon. “How you’d pull them up past the knob of your ankle, the one I like to kiss when I’ve got you on your back and your calves against my chest.”
As everyone around him watched, Neville stood and gently flipped Theo so his back was now resting on the soft mattress instead of his chest. Draco could see how swollen Neville’s lips were, how his chest was heaving as he continued to twist and position Theo until his body lay parallel with the bedframe and his head dropped off the edge of the bed.
He flipped it over so that Draco could see his checklist, and instead of the scratches and checks, each option was coded a colour: red, yellow and green. “This copy stays with Oli at the front,” Neville said before turning the paper to face himself, “and I’ll pull it before each one of our sessions. Any change you make on your sheet will adjust on this one.”
He heard his Master folding his belt in half before he felt the lush leather rubbing across his sensitive backside.
He loved his employment and had tirelessly worked his way through his apprenticeship. Draco was still on the bottom rung of the brewmasters, destined to stir and slice, chop and divy, until he had so many mending charms on his fingerprints that his skin sparked against the sharp, silver-tipped knife.
“Oh, did Harry invite you to the zoo with Teddy? That’s so cute!” Ginny clapped her hands in excitement.
Theo’s arse clenched tightly as he undulated on Neville’s hard length, his hands reaching up to balance himself on Neville’s firm chest.
Draco was positive his face was contorted in confusion as Potter continued. “I never left. I just… transferred to another class.”
“Yep. Not that he’d stray from Hermione, but he’s a bit wound up. Could use a good paddling, Ron could.”
“Darling, you already know I like to crawl around with a ball gag in my mouth. What’s more personal than that?”
They kissed, and Draco tugged greedily along his length. He didn’t bother to see who was looking anymore, too engrossed in the scene unfolding in front of him to care. He had never seen anything hotter in his entire life than what was happening only eight feet away behind a glass pane.
Things we can look forward to: their first scene together! A group scene with Neville! Spanking! Orgasm Delay! Collaring!!!!! and much more cuddles and hugs and kisses and loooooove!
“Take care of my hole,” Theo moaned, and Draco tried to imagine what Potter might say. Would he beg for Draco to go harder, or faster?  Would he whine so beautifully as Draco teased his slit? Would he thrust his own cock into Draco’s lubed palm as Draco pounded into him over and over and over again?
A branch snapped in the distance, and Draco gasped as the beast spread its feathers and took off into the sky, a golden ball disappearing in almost an instant. It was beautiful, stunning, and for a moment, Draco wondered what it’d be like to be up on a broom, chasing the bird all over a pitch.
Draco could hear birds chirping, but he couldn’t see anything. Instinctively, he reached for his wand with his other hand. The hand that wasn’t currently tingling in Potter’s grasp, that is. “What are we looking for?” Draco asked, trying to stop his mind from focusing on the fact that he was, indeed, holding Potter’s hand on a hillside in a Wizarding zoo.
“Haven’t flown in a while,” Draco said, his voice barely audible. It was the truth, but it also didn’t matter what he said, he just wanted to keep talking. To hear Potter talk in that low whisper, to have their faces so close that he could just lean, only a little, blame it on the wind, or —
“Possibly.” Neville shrugged with ease. “We’ll delve into the second form of play a bit later, how funishment and punishment work in this type of relationship.
“Been wanting you in my arms all week, Teddy Bear,” Neville murmured right before bringing his lips to Theo’s mouth, then kissing his way to Theo’s cheek and jawline.
He had run away from those walls, like a coward after everything he had done to destroy the place he had affectionately thought of as a second home for seven years.
“Ten with my palm,” he said, and Harry felt the smooth pads of his fingers dance across his naked bottom until they cupped his skin roughly. “And then ten with my belt.”
Deft hands cinched him at the waist and helped him bend himself over the sturdy thighs of his Master. He leaned forward, letting gravity take hold until his body rested against the silk fabric of trousers and his fingers lay flat against the concrete floor.
They were exactly how Harry pictured they would look on Draco; delicate, sexy, and the perfect contrast against his alabaster skin. The skirt barely held the dip in Draco’s arse, emphasizing his sculpted, muscular arsecheeks that Harry could never get enough of.
He always seemed to end up next to Potter, though. Near the sinks, by the toilets, in the shower stall directly to the right of the Chosen One.
“Great,” Neville nodded with confidence. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to tend to Harry for a bit. See you tomorrow.”
Draco had shaken the water out of his hair, trying to rid the image of someone else claiming Potter. No. That would not do.
He closed his eyes, and only felt Harry, capable and strong, moaning even louder now. The sound was practically in Draco’s ear, ‘Malfoy’, ‘Malfoy’, ‘Yes, fuck’.
Potter’s hand felt loose in his own, and Draco became distinctly aware that Potter was backing away, his face fully red and his eyes staring at anything but Draco’s own, and what if he thought that — no, Draco couldn’t let him think that this wasn’t what he wanted.
Nevertheless, he was more than curious about how to properly ‘prep’ and not rush like Ernie had with Theo. If that situation came along for him, he wanted to be ready. A Malfoy was always prepared.
“Well, what do you know, we have a caller,” Harry grinned, knowing just who was on the other line. “Hello, guest, you’re on with
“Stand up,” Sir commanded, and Harry snapped open his eyes, still only seeing darkness. He pushed up on his palms, manoeuvered to his feet as quickly as possible, and stood.
At first, Draco had blamed it on necessity. The showers were crowded in the morning, or after a game of two-a-side Quidditch, or after Care of Magical Creatures when they had to withdraw dung from the cages of Thestrals.
BIG thanks to Thunder_of_Dragons and Eva_Eleanor who alphaed and betaed this chap (and this story, can you all believe its almost over???), and Malenkayacherepakha who britpicked (incredible friend, you are). Also thanks to TheeStarryknight for betaing and squeeing all over these chapters for me!
Harry groaned again, something muffled, and Draco let his body tilt into his touch as his hands slid down his chest. His cock was aching to be touched, and instead of Draco’s own palm wrapping itself around his burgeoning erection, he let himself imagine it was Harry’s.
Pansy nodded in understanding. “He must have taken you to the training room. First time we went, he took us straight back there, had me on my knees in minutes.” Her gaze went a bit glossy as they drifted to a blank spot on her back wall.
“Ah, that’ll be John. Not his real name, I don’t think, but he tends to like the redheads. He’s always asking Gin about Ronnykins.”
Draco could barely hear Pansy’s voice over the pounding in his ears. He had been kissed. Potter had just kissed him. In front of everyone. With tongue.
“So I know what you can do in four minutes, but what about three?” Harry said, wrapping his arms around Malfoy’s waist.
It didn’t take him long to decide on which option to take. He only paused briefly, staring at his stomach covered in spunk. His wand was in his hand; it would only take a moment, one quick cleansing charm and another one to dampen his hair and make it look like he had been showering all along, minding his own business. Instead, he knotted his towel around his waist, and with his best Malfoy glare, he sauntered out of the stall.
“Kiss before I leave?” Draco said, arching his eyebrow in curiosity at Harry, trying to lean casually backwards on their dresser. “Or do you have more reorganising to do?”
She shrugged and then downed her drink. Pansy Accioed over the bottle before answering. “It depends. There’s always a motive behind it.” After pouring herself another glass, Pansy offered the bottle to Draco.
- UPDATE: Hi all! I know, I haven't posted in a few weeks! I am working on the final six so I can make sure they're as great as you deserve them to be. I'll start posting again on Sept 1, and I appreciate all of your patience until then!
When he looked back into the room, Neville had stood and hooked his trousers over his hips. He pulled his wand out of his pocket and Accioed over a thick blanket, wrapping Theo up in it, before placing a soft, tender kiss on his forehead and leaving the room.
Neville paused. “At the beginning, Theo thought he might have liked it, but we learned together that he did not.” He Accioed over a heavy trunk from the side of the room, and upon releasing the clasp, revealed several drawers with tiny wooden knobs. He opened one, exposing a long line of metal spheres, increasing in size from slim and short to wide and tall.
Not that Potter wanted any of that. Draco tried to remind himself, but his fantasies continued throughout the week.
Draco watched in awe as Theo visibly shuddered, eyes focused laser-sharp on the floor, a smile curling his lips.
He wondered if those hands were coarse, if they’d feel rough as they ran down Draco’s sides. Would they be strong as they gripped onto his hips. Would they leave little purple bruises from pressing into his delicate skin too hard.
His body was shaking as he leaned against the tile wall of the shower. Had all of that really just happened? Had he just pulled himself off to the sounds of Chosen Harry Potter, beating his own broomstick with Draco’s name on his lips?
“Is that—” he started, but his words stuck in his throat. They were all of a sudden close, so close that instead of the smell of walnut and grass, Draco could only smell honey, could only smell Potter. If Potter just turned his head, only slightly, they’d be face to face, close enough that Draco could just lean a bit more and—
I have literally been waiting since last October to share the next chapter with you. Stay tuned until next Monday!
The sound rose above the shower spray, curling around Draco as he padded to his own stall. It came out like a moan, desperate, needy and as hot as the water that was producing all that steam.
“Similar to your fight or flight instincts,” Draco added. He had read about how serotonin and epinephrine were often produced during scenes.
“But then it...well, if it’s not a punishment, that is, it’s almost like…” Her eyes went a little out of focus, until she cleared her throat and continued. “Like everything else falls away. Your worries, and your stress, and all you can do is feel.”
“What the fuck was that, Potter? Implying that I’m gay? That I’m throwing the match to stare at some coach’s arse?”
In a panic, Draco slammed the door and grabbed the parchment from the top of his desk. A simple spell illuminated the last lettering scribbled across its pages, and Draco cringed as he read the next part of the letter he had scrolled.
Harry had to close his eyes to stem off the rush of heat that coursed through his body. The thought of his husband, all donned up in black, or white, or the softest velvet blue crush, had him so aroused he could barely think straight.
Draco couldn’t help but feel surprised as he took his aunt’s hand for the first time in his life. She was so warm and welcoming, so different from Aunt Bella and even his mother. His mother, who he apparently looked like. He’d always been compared to his father, from the colour of his slicked-back hair to the steely arch of his eyebrows, all the way down to the sharp angle of his nose.
Alexsander met him at the door, escorting him inside and handing him a lowball of brandy. “Ms Parkinson speaks highly of her friend,” he smiled. “She insists we take excellent care of you or face detestable punishment.”
Then Draco blamed it on the smell of Potter’s shampoo. It reminded him of home, the smell of citrus and honeysuckle. Draco’s own lavender-scented potions had muddled his nose from years of use, and he hardly smelled anything as he poured it into his palm and worked it into his hair. But Potter’s sharp floral and lime always made their way to Draco, cutting through the spray of water and other surrounding smells.
to tell you what Marjorie said.” He heard Pansy’s voice behind him, and he wanted to move, to at least get out of the bloody doorway where the setting sun was lighting him up like a fucking beacon. No, he needed to slam the door, back up into the anonymity of evening air and crowded passerbys. It was so stuffy in the bar, that was all. Stuffy, and loud, and smelling horribly of darkened ale and ex-whatevers.
“Pull your cock out,” Malfoy groaned into his ear before sticking his tongue out to barely graze the lobe. “Suck on it until you got hard.”
He didn’t give it back right away, though. Instead, Potter stood over Draco’s bed, holding his wand and holding his gaze. “After I died, I told myself I wasn’t going to live in fear ever again.”
The warm water felt delicious on his back and his neck, working out the kinks that had formed by sleeping at such an uncomfortable angle. He let the waterfall pelt against his scalp, drip down his chest, cling to the hairs on his thighs. Once he finally felt clean and warm, he stepped out of the suds and wrapped a fluffy towel low around his waist.
“I’d feed you my cock, Potter, until you wouldn’t even be able to make any noise, until the only thing you could do was grunt, or pant, or gag, and you’d love it, wouldn’t you? You’d love to swallow my cock like it was sweet Treacle Tart, like it was the best thing you’d ever had pulsing down your throat.”
Draco glared, raising his eyebrows as his hair began to cling to his jawline. Potter held his stare, his eyelashes fluttering as tiny droplets of rain clumped against them. Draco almost thought he looked distant, despite their bodies being so close, but before he could consider it further, a flash of lightning lit up the sky.
Not as much of a glow-up as Potter, though. The last time Draco had seen Scarhead, he was dirty and thin, his hair matted and his face puffy and destroyed by that horrible hex. Draco could barely recognize him, except for his eyes.
“Harry, make sure to tell Draco that winning against him was easier than a slice of tart, and that the Snitch is that little gold ball in the sky, not Coach Krum’s arse.” Harry blinked. He should have probably read the cue card off the air before doing it live. “Well, I’m sure Malfoy knows what a Snitch looks like, Ginny, but thank you for that insight.” He took in a breath, and continued. “But I’m sure we would all agree that Viktor’s arse is also quite a sight and worth more than 150 measly points.”
“Could we not do this here?” Potter said, making a motion to follow the disappearing crowd and head indoors. Quickly, Draco grabbed his wrist, holding him still.
At its core, it was similar to learning Potions. A single mistake could destroy a potion, but if brewed correctly, it could help. It could save lives.
He wondered for a moment if Potter would wear joggers on their date as well, or maybe he’d trade them out for tight jeans or black trousers. Or maybe…
around both him and Potter. The rain instantly ceased to pound against their shoulders as an invisible umbrella surrounded them. Draco couldn’t help but smile smugly at Potter’s look of surprise.
Draco huffed, rolled his eyes and stared at Harry as if he had suggested they drink a Riesling with their pot roast instead of a cabernet. “I said they’re right here.”
With that, he turned, fully expecting to walk out of the zoo and out of Potter’s life. However, right before he reached the barrier, he felt a warm grip on his wrist.
Quickly Vanishing the evidence, Draco was about to drag himself into a much needed shower when an owl began to peck at his toes.
Pansy wiped a tear away from her eye and took a deep breath. “When we’re at the club though, when I’m with Ginny, she takes all that pressure from me. She takes it off my shoulders. All of it.”
Draco could still hear Potter talking, but the sound wasn’t reaching his ears. The only thing he could hear was the chirping of the Snidgets and Potter’s words.
“You’ve said it yourself on your little wireless show,” Malfoy spat through the phone. “I’ve been distracted.”
“Mr Malfoy, don’t you look nice tonight,” Oli grinned. “Mr Longbottom is waiting in the training room,” they said before pointing down the hall.
Thanks to Malenkayacherepakha, EvAEleanor and Thunder of Dragons for your patience throughout this whole story. I would have given up way before this without you all.
His hand was instantly filled with a glass of merlot as soon as he walked through the Floo. He settled at the end of Pansy’s lemon-coloured sofa, crossing his ankles below him as he took the first calming sip of wine. It went down easily, way easier than whisky.
“As we all know by now, Ginevra Weasley absolutely dominated the game against the Arrows yesterday. I spoke to this brilliant seeker just before we came on the air, who had the following to share:” Harry cleared his throat as he picked up the scribbled note Ginny had left on their table that morning.
And it still was fine. Great, of course it was great. Didn’t matter that he hadn’t seen Potter since the day that he died, only to find the git sitting perfectly fine and content and very much alive. A little older, yes, glasses still broken in the middle (he knew he was the most powerful fucking wizard around, didn’t he?), just casually talking to a
They ended up on a grassy knoll with a scattering of fully mature trees. As they walked through a containment charm, Draco was surprised to feel the air shift from a muggy heat to a calming breeze.
“Prim, proper little Potter,” Draco started with a bite, still surprised that no one had stopped him, especially their cardigan-loving instructor. “The whole world thinks they know you, don’t they? Perfect Potter and his perfect scar.” Draco paused, and on instinct, lifted his thumb to rub along the raised skin on Potter’s forehead.
That was when he realised he was rock-hard, even though the scene had barely begun. Draco had tried to imagine what it would feel like, diving into the tight heat of another man, but he couldn’t know for sure. Would it feel like the solid clench of his fist? The soft slick of a lubricated sleeve? Or would it be more like sinking into a bath, relaxing and warm, and, oh,
Draco huffed, before inhaling again. Yes, he definitely smelled honey. “So maybe I noticed you earlier.”
Or if those fingers, the ones that Draco had stared at as they wrapped around the thick handle of a broom, and stirred cauldron ingredients with such delicacy, were somewhere else. Clasped around something harder. Something longer. Something thicker.
Draco unrolled the parchment, his heart beating in his chest. Was it from his mother? Apologizing for their sudden departure? Was it from his boss, asking him that his potion was a catastrophe and he shouldn’t return to work?
“Great,” Neville grinned, happiness radiating across his face. “Now,” he continued with a wink, “let me show you what manacles are.”
Shrugging to himself, imagining what Hermione would say at his recklessness, he reached out and touched the thread. Warmth exploded through him, as though filling his heart and soul with the promise of something beautiful. Though he’d only touched it for a second, it felt as though his entire world shifted… until he removed his hand.
Removing his hand from the light, Harry pondered Draco's words. It was true: he had been feeling rather strained lately. In less than five years, Harry had come to detest being an Auror. His name got in the way, the politics were a nightmare, and he was tired of fighting for his life. Harry had never mentioned it at home, but he wasn't surprised that Draco had picked up on his current feelings. He knew Harry better than anyone.
“Part of the job description,” Merlin said with a chuckle, “In order to help souls move on to their next destination, whatever it may be, I need to help them through whatever fear, pain, or grief they may be feeling. This place allows me to hear those thoughts, regardless of any magical defence. Rest assured, I would never abuse it.”
Mentally shaking himself, Harry pushed all of the dark thoughts into the back of his mind, locking them away.
Draco was so wrapped up in disgust and self-loathing, he nearly jumped when Harry broke the silence.
Under the new ministry, those with marks were imprisoned, and those whose marks had vanished were released with full pardons.
Before Harry could respond, Healer Edwards continued, “I also suspect that you don't want anyone to know about it. I just want you to know that no child deserves to be neglected. You should be loved, and not just because you are The Boy Who Lived. I understand why you won't tell me, but promise me you'll tell someone you trust, alright?”
When Draco spotted Harry, he rushed up to him with guilt and worry etched on his face, “I’m so sorry, Harry. I shouldn’t have insulted Hagrid. I have a habit of speaking my mind without thinking.”
“Oh, that…” Draco shrugged, “I already owled him. I denounced the death eaters and Voldemort and shamed him and his actions in the process. It was really quite a relief actually. I wrote everything I’ve been wanting to say, insulting him thoroughly and eloquently in the process. I imagine it will be quite a shock when he reads it.”
Behind the desk sat a pale woman with wild blonde hair and furrowed brows, too absorbed in stacks of parchment to notice their entrance. After waiting for several minutes, Harry considered interrupting the woman. At this moment, however, a tall and slim man with dark-brown skin walked through the door in the back of the shop.  His familiar muggle clothing stood out against the wizarding robes Harry had seen all day. From the white coat he wore, Harry guessed that this man would be his eye-doctor.
Love to my friends Kaedemarie and Freyja-luna for seeing me through this chapter, and to all my lovely Larks for their unwavering support.
When they arrived in the muggle neighborhood, Draco looked at the space where Dobby was standing, having made himself invisible to prevent exposure. For his part, Draco was dressed in jeans, a white t-shirt, and his leather jacket. He smiled at the thought of his father seeing him like this; he was fairly sure the man would drop dead from shock.
By the time they’d arrived at the robe shop, Harry felt completely out of his element and was beginning to think Hagrid had forgotten he’d only just learned about magic. His hopelessness was only magnified when he’d met someone his age while getting fit for his school robes. The boy had stared at him, and Harry had figured he was going to comment on his scar like everyone else. He’d been surprised when the boy had apologized for staring and explained his nerves.
“Yes, I’ve found something I believe you would be interested in,” Draco tempted vaguely,  internally smirking when he saw her eyes widen with curiosity and greed.
Harry removed his hands, and Draco gasped. They were facing a wall of beautiful magenta flowers, hanging from the treetops in vines. Upon closer inspection, he realized that the leaves were magenta. The flower itself was a tiny delicate thing, pure white and no bigger than the tip of his finger. He took a deep breath, inhaling the wonderful scent of the flowers.
“What house are you hoping for? I...well...my whole family has been in Slytherin.” Draco paused. He hadn’t realized it until this moment, but he didn’t particularly want to be sorted into Slytherin this time around. With this thought, Draco remembered something from his time with Merlin:
“Are you saying that Voldemort was supposed to lose? But then… why didn’t he? And when you say rewrite destiny… is that possible?
He paused, opening the box and revealing a beautiful gold band with pearl and sapphire inlay woven together in small knots. "Will you marry me?"
When they finally broke apart, shining silver eyes met blazing emerald green, and an understanding passed between them. There could have been fear, hesitancy, awkwardness, or doubt, but there was none—only passion and determination.
Draco shook his head and stepped onto the stool, hoping that at least his appearance was a little less pretentious this time around. He turned his head toward Harry, trying to think of something friendly to say. He only succeeded in staring at the boy.
Harry was captivated by the blond’s words and could see the depth of his sincerity in the silver eyes that were intently staring at him. After a moment, he swallowed and nodded.
He scoffed at himself as he watched the ink settle into his skin and disappear. His soulmate… his destined match… and he wrote ‘hey'? Not even ‘hello’, but ‘hey'?
how you feel. I was at least informed ahead of time, but knowing what the houses mean doesn't always prepare you. Some know exactly where they should or want to go, but I think most of us have no idea where we belong. I certainly don't."
Kneeling to the floor, Draco placed his hand on Kreacher’s head. “I’m so sorry, Kreacher. I’m so sorry he left. And that Regulus and Walburga died. You don’t have to like Sirius or forgive him. But he doesn’t deserve to be trapped in there.”
“You said it yourself. What would have happened if you hadn’t made those mistakes? Or if you had befriended Harry? It can’t be denied that your destiny was very much intertwined with that of the war. Had you done things differently, many things would not have come to pass as they did.”
He paused, laughing outright at the irritation on Draco’s face. “I know, that was vague and convoluted. All you need to know is that the afterlife has many possibilities, and you will not be going to any of them.”
Excited for the afternoon ahead, Harry took off at a run towards the eye center. As he got closer, he could see that Draco was pacing back and forth in front of the entrance.
At that moment, Madam Malkin came and finished up both of their orders. They left the building together, chatting amicably about the things they still needed to gather. As they approached Hagrid, Draco saw the man’s face cloud over with concern. “Harry!” Hagrid said loudly, “What’re ye doin’ with him? He’s a Malfoy! Do ye know what his father is like?”
Disclaimer: See Chapter 1! The conception of Merlin and his role in this story is my creation, but otherwise, I own nothing!
One night, Draco had arrived first. He was beginning to worry when Harry burst in, eyes blazing with fury and hand dripping with blood.
“But wait,” Draco asked, confused, “I’ve never heard of familiars showing magic of their own. I haven’t given her any magic of mine, and it doesn’t feel as though she’s taken any.”
He sank to his knees, punching his fists into the ground as hard as he could with each breath he took, determined to suffer the pain.
“Oh,” Harry paused, looking surprised.  “It’s alright, and yes I am,” Harry fidgeted as he spoke, his nerves evident.
Sirius had already talked to Harry once that summer, teaching him about pureblood families and sharing his childhood with him. Sirius had told Harry that he wasn't a bad person, and those few words had meant the world to Harry. That being said, Sirius excluded, of course, Harry was still furious with the lot of them for ignoring him over the summer and trying to hide everything for him.
Mentions of violence, mentioning of blood, OC character death, nothing too explicit. Implied sexual activity, nothing explicit.
“Because of my success at guiding wizardkind in life, I was given the responsibility of guiding them in death. Whether good or evil, I take each witch or wizard to their next destination. Think of me as a ferryman of sorts.”
“That’s your advice? Calm down? Oh for the love of Merlin…” he paused, smacking his forehead in frustration. He would have to come up with a new expression at this rate. He almost found the whole thing funny. Who knew dead people could faint?
Harry had been ecstatic at the prospect of having a place to hide away from time to time. His anger temporarily forgotten, He spent the rest of the day with Sirius, badgering him with questions about the Room and his time at school. It had been the first time in a while Harry was able to forget his troubled thoughts.
“I’m sorry, Harry. But..." Hagrid paused, seemingly growing more flustered. Draco guessed he was trying to think of an excuse that wouldn’t offend Harry further.
A large shaggy dog was pacing the confines of his cell restlessly when he heard a loud crack. Suddenly, a crisply folded piece of parchment dropped in front of his paws. He snarled at the air in front of him and sniffed the parchment. It smelled familiar, but he couldn’t figure out why. Sirius had half a mind to shred it with his teeth, but his curiosity won out. Shifting back to his human form, he cautiously picked up the parchment and unfolded it. When nothing happened, Sirius read the elegant script:
Author’s Notes: Love to my readers and as always, major props to my beta PTwritesmore and all the loves to my Larks!
Merlin smiled and shook his head, “I cannot give you all the answers, I’m afraid. But consider each house carefully over the next few days. You’re a different person than you were before, after all.”
As it says in the summary, this chapter will be in Harry's POV. This chapter was getting really long, so I decided this was a good place to end it. The next chapter will be Harry's POV as well, and then it will alternate between Harry and Draco. Please review!
His smile immediately left his face, when he noticed the dining room was empty, cold and dark. Both of his parents were gone, disappearing as quickly as a flicker of fire in his Floo.
Applause broke out around them, and Draco felt a drop of rain on his cheek. He sneered, then shouted again over the clapping. “Just couldn’t be in a class with me, then.”
Draco gasped, and his face instantly turned bright red at his audible response. In all of his years, he had never heard of someone doing something
That instead of moaning ‘Malfoy’ in the stall next to him, Harry was there, pressing him into the shower wall, as he tugged and twisted Draco in his calloused palm.
Harry paused, still gripping Draco’s wrist and holding him to his burgeoning erection. “What did you say?”
“Good. Luckily, I don’t think anyone really noticed.” Harry paused. “At least I found out he’s currently single.”
He felt the hitch of Potter’s breath before he even felt the puff of hot air across his cheek. Draco grinned, viciously, knowing he’d won. Feeling a way he hadn’t in quite some time.
His first instinct was to spit a scathing retort, glare at Longbottom until he backed down. But Draco took a breath instead, reminding himself that Neville was helping him, teaching him. That he was on his side.
He quickly found a spot between Zabini and Thomas, smirking when he realized Zabini was positioned directly across from his roommate, Longbottom. And right next to him…
His mind was racing while his feet remained rooted to the cold tile of the bathroom floor. Should he say something? Should he walk right back out and pretend that he never entered the loo at all? Or should he peel away the thin shower curtain, march into the stall, and coat Potter’s chest with the same filth that covered him the night before?
, that is. He knew the story, of course, how Bragge offered Galleons to the Quidditch player that could catch the golden bird, and he was pleasantly surprised how closely the tiny creature resembled the snitch they used now.
If you skipped the last chap, Neville taught a class and it brought up some not great feelings/memories for Draco. However, Neville being the excellent Dom/friend he is, took him home (as a friend!) and helped him process. Then he invited Draco to Teddy's birthday party. And here we are!
After the war, he had come to the realization that he was quite good at convincing himself of half-truths and straight lies. Sometimes it was easier than facing reality, that your dreams of the future were just that. Foolish dreams.
“I think we’re interrupting something!” Luna chimed in. “And the zoo is about to close. Almost dinner time, anyway.”
He pressed his palm into his erection, hoping not only to stave off any impending pleasure, but also to make sure it was reasonably hidden from the others that were joining to watch the show. The last thing he needed was his own inexperience to be exposed in the dim lights.
That small glimpse of Potter’s cock, ridged in another man's hand as he trailed bites down Potter’s bared throat had been enough to completely fuck up Draco’s world.
“Enjoy your morning wank, Potter?” Draco leered as he washed his hands in the sink directly next to his nemesis. “I know I sure did.”
“You mean a good wallop?” the older man interjected with a laugh. Draco’s mind wandered to earlier, when Pansy suggested Ron could use a strong paddling.
“You’re a pureblood. A Parkinson. And you more than casually visit a sex dungeon.” He didn't want to sound judgemental, but he was having trouble wrapping his head around the whole thing. Taking control, giving control, possibly having sex, it was all too confusing. Draco lived in a world of certainty. The exact ingredients, the perfect temperature, always lead to the same results. No power play, only facts.
Whew, we made it to the end of this journey! As of today, this is a completed fic, but it is nowhere near the end of these boys future. I have lots more planned, and I hope you stay tuned!
“Yes, but…” His own eyes got wide as he tilted his head toward Neville. “We can talk about it later.”
Neville broke their kiss and then murmured against Theo’s lips. “Do you want to sit on Daddy’s lap?”
A thunderous applause to my cheerleader, Thunder_of_Dragons on this. And all my love to EvA and Malenkayacherepakha for your betaness and amazing input to this story. I would have not been able to write this chapter without you.
. Like he was buzzing. It was similar and yet so different to how it was when his magic spilled wild, when he broke the china, or ruined the furniture. Instead, it was as if he buzzed under his skin, contained, controlled.
His Sir wore that outfit every time they played, and it had built such an effect on Harry that now when he saw black suspenders, he’d get so hard he’d want to find an empty cubicle and wank himself raw.
Things were going great. Draco had successfully finished his apprenticeship and secured employment at the finest potionery in Diagon; his small, but solid grouping of friends were a grateful stability in his life; his father rested underground where he could no longer scar Draco with his words; he visited his mother every Sunday between 4 and 7pm, enough time to share pleasantries but not long enough to sour an awkward supper.
He only had to glance into the mirror to see the look of surprise, quickly replaced with horror as realisation crossed over Potter’s reflected face. Draco couldn’t help but smirk, making sure to arch his chest in the fluorescent lights so Potter could see the trails of his pleasure spread across his skin.
She grinned. “Oh, yes. How sensitive I get, how much I beg and cry for her.” Pansy sat up straight in her chair. “I used to get so embarrassed at the sounds I’d make, but Ginny loves them.”
By the time they arrived, the party was in full swing. Despite the dark clouds gathering in the sky, Aunt Andromeda had chosen to host the party outside, clearly to accommodate the masses of witches and wizards that were in attendance.
His thighs were burning, positioned so far above his head, as he struggled to keep his balance across his Master’s thighs, but the strain only heightened his pleasure, his want for release. He arched his feet, hooking his toes around the back of the chair for added stability as he felt the smooth pads of his master’s fingers begin to circle his hole.
One was already on, the steam billowing above the stall, the mirrors already foggy. He huffed, annoyed that he wouldn’t have the space to himself as he wanked and washed, and haphazardly threw his towel onto the sink before tugging off his clothes.
It was then that Draco realised the room was not just filled with Potter. There were three other people gathered in an awkward semi-circle around Longbottom. He didn’t know the other gentleman - he was older, with bits of grey sprinkled into his dark beard - but Draco vaguely recognized one of the women to his left. Abbott, he thought, although he couldn’t quite place her first name. Anna or Helen or something like that. He had no idea who the last student was, nor did he care, because he definitely recognized the new person that just walked in.
Draco arched, pushing his shoulder blades into the wall as his hips canted forward into his waiting hands. It should have felt like it normally did, when he pulled himself off in the confines of his four-poster, silencing charms blocking off the noise from his surrounding mates.
Draco ended up doing none of that, and instead tiptoed into the closest empty stall, the one that just so happened to share a tiled wall with Potter. He leaned against the other side, tucking his feet back as far as possible and hoping that they wouldn’t be visible should Potter glance towards the floor.
“Draco, where have you been?” his father bellowed, standing up from his chair. “It’s extremely inconsiderate to be late, especially when you’re the host.” His glare cut into Draco before he could even shut his front door behind him.
He used a Close Shave spell and a hair emulsifying charm and all the other bits of magic that would possibly delay the inevitable conversation. Begrudgingly, he settled in front of his Floo and called for his closest friend, who he was learning more about every day.
Harry dropped his hands back down so his palms were flat to the concrete, his fingers splayed out to give him better leverage. He felt so exposed; even though he had been naked through their entire session, the fact that his thighs were spread so far, revealing the most private part of himself for his Master to do whatever he wanted, made him feel so incredibly vulnerable.
That morning, he watched as Draco left their room, arms full of clothes as he headed to the shower. Harry practically dove out of bed the second the door shut, wondering if he could get a quick wank out while holding the frilly fabric and rubbing his thumb over the soft green ribbon that weaved its way across the top. But when he reached into the drawer, his hand came back empty.
Draco stared into green, letting his mind fill with the memory of the last time he saw those eyes, fluttering with pleasure in the back of a darkened alley, desperate and longing and raw.
“I’d lick every inch of you while you continued your little show, until you were panting and practically crying out my name.”
Draco groaned and finally sat up. “What do you want?” he asked, wincing at his voice. He was hoping to come off dismissive, but instead it came across as, ugh, curious. As if he actually cared.
Malfoy in months, apart from catching the occasional match in person. Same blond hair, same fierce grey eyes. He looked shorter though. Hunched. As if he was trying to hide in the background, merge into the blur of the crowd.
Draco tried to think of the last time he even saw Potter. It wasn’t at school, but it wasn’t long after. A glance down an alley after attending some ridiculous soiree his mother had dragged him to, a last minute effort to salvage the Malfoy name. That glance had provided more of Potter than he had even seen before Seventh, his throat tilted upward, exposed in the pale moonlight. That same luminescence had trickled down Potter’s chest, revealing the piece of Potter even the paper hadn’t uncovered.
Understanding intentions and motivation was something Draco knew he was skilled at. As a Slytherin, he knew how to be cunning, how to poke, and prod, and manipulate someone's weakness to get what he wanted.
It felt so good on his long-neglected cock that Harry continued to rut against his Master’s leg. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he was fully aware he was breaking the rules, but he couldn’t focus on that.
Okay, fine. There was a one in 25 chance that his spin would land on anyone in particular. The odds were certainly with him that it wouldn’t be-
“You are in control, but you are not in charge,” Neville said during their last session of the week. “At best, you are planting the seeds, but your partner is watering the earth. You are nurturing the plant together, every stem, every leaf. Your actions affect each other, and how healthy your flower will grow.”
The Snidget’s body was almost comically round, its feathers shimmering brightly in the artificial sun. Attached to its large body was a long, skinny beak, right below tiny eyes that surveyed the trees around it.
Neville nodded. “You will review your Submissive’s whenever you play. It’s imperative we adhere to each other’s RACK, or risk-aware consensual kink. For instance,” he continued, magically sticking the checklist to the wall and expanding it so it was easier to read, “you have watersports as a hard limit. Therefore, even if your Submissive enjoyed that element of play, it wouldn’t be incorporated into a scene with you.”
One chap left! I have a whole series planned for next year (incl. scening at the club for all three couples, relationship goals *cough* collaring *cough* and very naughty play/dirty talk which was intended to get into this story but...Draco is a precious bean and needed to take his sweet ass time. Please subscribe to the series and stay tuned!
Kreacher twisted his face into what Draco could only hope was a smile, nearly shouting, “Yes young Master! Kreacher would be honored! Kreacher will be taking very good care of Young Master! Kreacher will help Master Sirius!”
His performance had the desired effect: her face grew impossibly swollen and flushed the same colour pink as her office. “That’s very nice to hear, Mr. Malfoy. It would have been rather… unfortunate… if you were no longer able to perform your duties,” she smiled sweetly at him.
Once again, major love and thanks to my beta PTwritesmore who was absolutely instrumental in writing this series, and this chapter in particular. There's a lot in this chapter so if anyone is confused about anything please feel free to DM me! Please review!
Draco was mortified. He couldn’t think straight. He was rooted to the spot, shaken to his very core.
His luck would continue with the absence of Umbridge in their Defence Against the Dark Arts class. For a moment, Harry was suspicious.
“Thank you, Kreacher.” Draco rose and walked to his writing desk, penning his message to Sirius. He would have to pick up some things for the man while he was in Diagon Alley next week. “Here you go,” Draco said, handing the note to Kreacher, “Make yourself invisible, and drop this where he can see it. That way you two don’t have to see each other,” he paused briefly as a thought occurred to him. “Will you need to worry about the Dementors?”
Draco began to pace the room. “Have you ever bothered to look past his hair and glasses? His clothes are an absolute mess, he’s always bruised and thin, and eats like he’s starving at the beginning of the year.” Severus watched as his godson took a breath, feeling as though he’d been petrified. He couldn’t rationalize this, as hard as he was trying.
He paused. He noticed the words in his hand read, "I must not tell lies". He made a mental note to ask Harry about it later and applied the ointments to his hand. As soon as he was done, he saw a great amount of tension leave Harry's shoulders. He felt another twinge of anger as he realized the boy must have been in far worse pain than he cared to show. He placed the gauze over the ointment and began the slow and careful process of wrapping the hand. Once he had a good start on the wrap, he began speaking again. "As for Voldemort, he is the reason I’m talking to you about this. Even when I believed the ideals my father spouted, I never wanted to kill for them. That's what I would be made to do, eventually. Voldemort has come back into power, and my father is in his inner circle, or at least he was the first time around. I would be made to get the dark mark. To serve. To torture. To kill. Maybe not right away. But it would happen. I know the truth. Voldemort is completely mad. I may not have been there for it. But I've heard the stories, just like everyone has. He will destroy everything. I will not scrape and serve beneath the robes of that mutated piece of filth. But if I'm going to be free of that, I'm going to need your help. Once I tell my father, I'll likely be disowned at the very least. School will become a danger once Voldemort gets word. He doesn't take kindly to refusal, no matter who they are. He will want me disposed of, just for the sake of sending a message to the others. The only possibility I have of avoiding it is with your help."
Despite everything he'd seen so far, Harry rubbed his eyes once and then again, and even pinched himself in his amazement.
Steeling his resolve, Draco moved to his writing desk, setting Lyra gently on his lap. The tears flowed like a river from his eyes
Shaking himself from the memories, Harry began to follow the trail. Looking back, he was glad that he had agreed, and had learned to enjoy Draco's efforts. Because of that day, he was walking through this beautiful place, making his way towards a man who loved him unconditionally and showed him every day.
He was staring at the ceiling when Hedwig flew in, dropping a package and a letter on the bed before moving to her cage.
Severus could hardly comprehend the words, and then his mind swam with rage. “Do not presume to judge me, Draco!” he shouted. “I have no idea how you came to know of the lessons or why you are here defending Potter of all people, nor do I care! It is none of your business! I’m sure Potter had a wonderful time whining and playing the victim—”
The morning after his “rebirth” as he was now calling it, Draco approached his mother’s study. He wanted to see her, hear her, talk with her, and even just be near her again. As he raised his hand to knock, he heard his mother humming, and his hand froze mid-air. Emotions slammed into Draco like the Hogwarts Express, and he found he couldn’t move.
Once again, Harry is standing in front of his Aunt and Uncle's home, already anxiously awaiting the day he can leave again. He has no idea the kind of surprises and revelations that await him in his last few weeks, but one thing is certain, his last moments in Private Drive will be anything but boring.
"Let this serve as payment," Lucius condemned softly, " Your afterlife shall be a torment of regret and despair; a living hell that will haunt you with your failures and treasury..." he paused, plunging the knife forward, "... for all eternity."
With a start, Draco realized he was running late to meet Harry and broke off at a run. When he made it to Madam Malkin’s, he saw with relief that Harry was just being led to the stool for his fitting. Draco steeled himself and made his way inside, still slightly out of breath.
Draco thought for a moment. Harry was trying to tell him something...but what? He closed his eyes and thought over everything Harry had told him. Suddenly, the words came flowing back to him.
“Oh,” Hagrid said, thinking it over for a moment, “Well, ter tell ye the truth, his mother was right. I was too judgemental at the start. He seems like a nice enough lad, despite his father, and I thought yer may be more comfortable with someone yer own age.”
And so he told them everything. He started with the Dursleys and their treatment of him, going into more detail than he had ever done before. With some hesitation, he opened up about fourth year, his anger at Ron and what happened at the graveyard, leading him to the summer and his feelings of abandonment. Next came the night with the dementors, his court hearing, Dumbledore, and Umbridge. By the time he finished, it was getting close to dinner time. He was hoarse from talking, Hermione had tears in her eyes, and Ron was looking at the floor. The air between them was so tense, it seemed like it might shatter at any moment.
Harry turned Draco around and hugged him, whispering words of comfort. When Draco ceased struggling, Harry spoke into his ear, his voice rough with emotion, “Have you ever heard of a creature called a Deva?”
Slowly, memories of everything they'd done and talked about crowded out the dark thoughts. He wiped his eyes furiously, telling that part of his brain to shove it. Returning Draco's gift wouldn't be a good thing. If anything, it would be an insult, one Harry was unwilling to give.
Calmed by the thoughts of his Godfather, he found himself slowly relaxing. Before he knew it, Harry was fast asleep.
As the tears slowed and his breathing calmed, Draco found that he felt infinitely better, as though a poison had been purged.
Harry debated with himself. He hated Malfoy… and Malfoy hated him… right? But then why did he seem to care about Harry blaming himself when not even Ron or Hermione had noticed?
Still, as he settled in for his first night with the island as his home, he couldn’t escape the feeling that there was still something… someone missing from his life. An empty feeling in his heart that nothing could chase away.
He thought. With a sigh, he plunged forward, “I think you should come and stay with me in Gryffindor tower.”

Harry stood in the hallway outside the office, completely gobsmacked.  He had never heard anything like what Healer Edwards had said, and it was too much for him to process in addition to everything else. Harry leaned against the wall and closed his eyes, breathing deeply and thinking about all of the things he wanted to do today. He and Draco had made plans. He was going to go out and have fun discovering all kinds of new things. He was going to spend the day with a friend for the first time in his life. Everything would be ruined if he mulled over everything else.
Draco had known that he would have to see his father again eventually. He had thought he was prepared for it. But coming back from his trip with Harry, he had almost forgotten everything. For a moment, he had been a simple eleven-year-old boy again. The abuse of his past had faded, along with the circumstances of his death. Now, with just one sentence from the house elf, It all came flooding back: the pain as the knife twisted through him, the anger and grief and the betrayal, floating in the Nothing.
It was just after 10 pm as Draco Malfoy approached the location Harry had given him the night before. He’d had a rough time getting from the dungeons to the seventh floor, narrowly dodging Filch and Peeves along the way, but he’d made it.
Draco found himself speechless, something he did not often experience. Shaking himself slightly, he asked, “Why bring me here? I take it your little Gryffindor friends don’t know. So why me, of all people?”
After a moment, Harry decided against worrying too much, as did the rest of the students. Umbridge wasn’t there, and that’s all they needed to know.  They chose to spend the class practising some new spells they’d been learning, or work on their homework for other classes. Even Ron, irresponsible as he usually was, managed to get some work done.
If Draco wondered, he didn't comment. Instead, he followed Harry, both excited to see what the rest of the day would bring.
In truth, Severus had thought Lucius was successful until the incident with the howler. Apparently, Draco had been keeping secrets.
“Dobby is being very careful, young master,” Dobby whispered dramatically, “Dobby will not be disappointing you.” Draco heard a small pop and assumed the elf was gone. He settled down on a nearby bench to read one of his magazines and wait for Dobby to return.
Trigger Warning for mentions of emotional abuse, depictions of the impact relating to emotional abuse, and one scene of extreme emotional abuse.
The man waved his hand, vanishing the snake. "It was a curse set upon you by your father. When he killed you, he wanted to ensure you suffered beyond your death. It would have fed on you for eternity, crushing your soul beneath the weight of your own emotions."
But now that he saw the thread and had felt that warmth, there was no question in his mind. He took the thread and wrapped it around his wrist, signalling the acceptance of the bond. The thread pulsed brilliantly before vanishing completely. Harry was briefly alarmed before remembering… he touched the pulse point on his wrist and watched in wonder as the bond appeared again, still the brilliant white of purity and potential.
She was surrounded by a faint silver glow.  Her eyes, which were beautiful on their own, were shining, making the blue look ethereal. Her fur was glowing as well, grey and white colours sparkling in the dimly lit room. As she looked at him, Draco realized that the melody was coming from her.
The cat meowed in greeting when he spotted Harry. He grabbed the toad in his mouth, pranced over to Harry, and dropped it at his feet. He turned his eyes to Harry, looking at him expectantly.
: the drink that tingles as it slides down your throat!” Harry grimaced. He really needed to talk to Lee about these promotions.
He heard a gasp from his left, Melody or Abbott, he wasn’t sure. Either way, no one was stopping him. Not now.
Draco didn’t acknowledge his statement, nor his apology, his hands aimlessly folding napkin squares into origami swans as he continued to dress the table. Harry had no choice but to continue.
A challenge. Draco rolled back his shoulders and walked steadily across the room, passing Abbott, and annoying Melody, and the other guy until he stood directly in front of the Chosen One himself.
At this, Draco looked at Harry questioning, his eyes still shining with emotion and slightly red-rimmed from crying. “But then, how did his account end up in the Black Family Vault? A disowned family member doesn't have access to the Family vaults.
“Yes,” croaked the house-elf, “Naughty Sirius is in Azkaban. As the only male child of the Black family line, Kreacher is bound to serve you.”
“I understand. Nightmares can feel so real. But I’m not going anywhere. I’m right here,” she said as she hugged him fiercely.  His mother had no idea it had been no nightmare. It had been his reality, and he was extremely determined that it would not happen again.
“What I do with my free time is none of your business. I can see you are angry. Would you care to talk about it?” Many people thought him heartless, and in many ways it was true, but Severus genuinely loved his godson. He’d been there when the boy was born and had always tried to be a fatherly figure for him, as Lucius had taken little interest besides poisoning his mind.
Confused by the situation, Harry decided it was best to wait outside, although he made a mental note to go inside after Draco if he wasn’t back in ten minutes. The blonde was obviously angry, and Harry got the sense that provoking his temper was a bad idea.
His mother misunderstood the reason behind his reaction and said, “Don’t you worry, darling. If you need to cry in front of me, you cry. I know your father doesn’t approve, but I’m your mother, and I’m not going to shame you for a normal human emotion.”
“Already taken care of,” Draco smirked again, “I used a forgery spell to pen a note to McGonagall. She’ll be away on ministry business for the rest of the week. I wanted to give us a few extra days just in case, but I don’t think it will take that long to wear her down.”
He turned again towards Kreacher. “So because our bond happened naturally, she can use magic? But how?”
