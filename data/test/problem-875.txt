The train ride this year was refreshing. Harry found himself taking in every sound that he could - the muffled chatter from other carriages, the train. Harry had even missed the sound of Ron’s loud chewing.
“You swore to obey me, Harry,” Dumbledore was saying. “Go!”
“What?” Harry asked after several moments of silence. “Why did you want to meet here?”
“A necklace could be good. Easy to hide,” she suggested.
Draco drew in a sharp breath. “Merlin, not everything is about you, Harry!” Draco grumbled. Any love they had in their eyes when they stared at each other, was gone. Now it was just daggers, glaring and frowns at each other.
“...surprising,” he finished. “You’re a bit worked up right now.”
“Hey, I was brave! And I did all of that when I was eleven!” he shook his head, then sighed. After a moment, he turned to Draco. “Dumbledore taught me about Horcruxes. Have you got any idea what they really are?”
Narcissa scooted up and took the blankets off his face, stroking his hair gently. “Just let your father undo the curse on your wedding day, Draco. Then get divorced and go back to Harry.”
“I’m fine,” he shook his head. His mouth was dry and his chest was aching for something; anything to fill the emptiness. Was it Cedric? Or was it Harry’s inability to save him? Either way, he couldn’t deny it. Cedric was gone because of him. “We don’t need to talk about it.”
“You have no right to do that,” Draco hissed, his eyes piercing into Harry’s. Harry slowly opened his mouth to speak.
“You’re just Harry to me,” Draco replied softly.
“I really think it’s better if you talk to him today,” she said, shaking her head. What threw Harry off was she seemed genuine, unlike what he had noticed before. “Go wherever you usually meet. He’ll be waiting.”
Harry found himself zoning in and out. He felt mostly blank, the guilt had washed away. He had forced himself to block out any sort of thoughts of the incident. But every so often, he would see someone in the hallways that looked ever so slightly like Draco, making him flinch and drop everything he would be holding.
Draco scoffed at that but went to change anyways. He came out of the bathroom to see Pansy holding a basket.
“Can we get to work now?” Draco asked.
“What?”
“Where’s Potter?” he folded his arms. “This is stupid.”

“Well, I know we all hung out in Eighth Year and such, but… I was the one who broke up with you, so it didn’t seem fair for me to stay in the friendship group. There was obviously going to be space only for one of us, and I wanted it to be you.”
Draco nodded. “You should’ve told me he was coming. I don’t want to intrude.”
“You know, you’re a really bad liar,” Draco said, lying down on his bed, Harry still at the foot of it.
Harry went for his detention, missing the Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. When he had entered the Gryffindor Common Room, everyone was celebrating.
“Harry-” Hermione started, then tapped his shoulder when she noticed his bare ears. “No hearing aids?” she asked while signing. “Is this some sort of exercise Malfoy’s making you practice?”
It all clicked. That’s what Draco was doing in the Room of Requirement. That’s what Voldemort had set him to do.
“I’m tired!” Harry raised his voice, causing everyone who was chatting to quiet down at once. He turned around and looked at everyone before shaking his head, his voice dropping low, “I’m just… tired.”
“For your safety, don’t, okay?” Harry took his hand and squeezed it. “Promise me. I’d rather be ambushed than lose you. Besides, this is what our training is for, right? You’re helping me in any way you can. Don’t overdo it before you end up in danger.”
“You’re no help,” Harry muttered as he following Ron out of their dorm.
“What else can I do?” he raised his voice.
“Just now? What was that whole thing with Malfoy about?”
Yet he couldn’t focus. All he could think about how he couldn’t mess up, not this time. No one was going to die for him. Not Hermione, not Ron, Neville, Ginny, Luna, anyone. He couldn’t let it happen, not again.
“What?” Harry asked, putting his hands under Draco’s sweater, looking up at him. “I can’t stand myself sometimes?”
Harry shrugged. “It’s not fair to him,” Harry said with a sigh. “I want to keep what happened between us.”
“Alright there, Harry?” Ron asked after they had reached the Eighth Year Common Room. He had noticed that Harry still seemed to be far away. No one could blame him. Harry simply nodded slightly in response, not saying anything.
, stop daydreaming,” said Hermione, rolling her eyes when she noticed Harry wasn’t paying attention to what she was saying. The loud chatter was deafening, but Harry didn’t mind it. He smiled slightly to himself when he stared at what seemed like a shaken up first year kid, nervous to leave her parents.
“That was before I fought someone because of him,” he said rather harshly, stuffing his face with a mouthful of food. “Before his stupid touch made my skin burn. Now all I want to do is dig a hole and bury myself in it. He definitely took the fight the wrong way. I was just trying to stop Blaise from making bizarre accusations.”
“Draco!” he said back in a completely different tone in an attempt to mock him. “But you’re serious? We had an essay? I’m fucked.”
The utter feeling of shame and guilt swirling around his chest, Draco rolled down the sleeve of his left arm where his Dark Mark was peeking out.
“Right back at you!” Harry retorted.
He played with his fingers, staring down at his feet. “It just feels like I’ve talked to you about things I couldn’t even dream to say to my friends, through these poems. And you don’t judge me. I watch you quietly chuckle at the poem, maybe smile. Sometimes I catch you reading over it again and again. And… it feels like we’re really friends.”
had gotten their communication right. Harry just hoped it was enough to keep them together when they were on the cusp of war.
“Give me your hand,” he said.
“Draco?”
*******
Hermione blinked. “That’s it? Harry, even a freaking snail could figure that out!”
He pulled away to catch his breath, staring at the man in front of him. “Do you really not like my hair gelled back?”
“Wait!” Harry whisper-shouted, which made Draco turn around and walk back to Harry.
“Take whatever side you want,” Harry rolled his eyes. “Spoilt Slytherin asshole,” he murmured under his breath.
“Oh shoot, I think I left the Snitch out on the field,” Harry said, suddenly realizing. “You go ahead to dinner, Ron.”

problem… right?
“Uh, that’s literally what I just asked you.” Draco didn’t feel the need to be formal with Snape. After all, Snape was always around Malfoy Manor, having meals with his family. Snape was Draco’s godfather, after all.
“Really?” he asked, eyes widening.
“I told you to do it a week ago when Professor had assigned it to us,” Draco sang, “This is what you get for not listening to your wonderful boyfriend’s advice,” Draco watched as Harry gave him a blank stare before going back to writing frantically. Draco started to pout.
“It was sweet. You know, it almost felt like you were actually sorry for once.”
“Let’s face it, we only
There will be a lot of changes for Draco and Harry.
“There are books in the library for it,” Harry said after a moment, mainly because he was still trying to process what Draco was saying. “Seriously, you don’t need me for this.”
,” Harry said, accidentally stressing on the word ‘friend’ too much.
“Why don’t you just go talk to him?”
Draco wolfed down his food, and Harry resisted the urge to call him a hypocrite, mainly because Draco looked beautiful when he was excited. Well, he always looked beautiful, but even more so.
“What are you talking about, mate?” Ron said through a mouthful. “Why would you be a burden?”
“Look,” his voice was shaky, “I know that out there, you have to be a Malfoy and I have to be Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived. But… when we’re in that room, away from the rest of the world, it feels like I’m just Harry, and you’re just Draco. And it feels like everything will be okay again.”
“You- what?” He stared up at Harry, eyes widening. His face was burning, and it actually felt as if he was coming down with a fever. Harry avoided his eyes, putting the piece of paper back into his pocket.
“...Alright,” he said.
“How soon?” Harry asked, grabbing Draco’s hand and gripping onto it tightly, afraid to let go. “I…” his eyes welled up with tears. “I’m not sure if I can keep doing this. It hurts so much, Draco.’
Draco opened his mouth to say something, but the chattering was dying down so all he could slip out was a venomous “Potter.” and had to glare at him. Harry glared right back, and then the two put their hands under the table, Harry putting his hand right on top of Draco’s which was resting on his thigh.
Harry gathered his stuff and caught up with Ron and Hermione, and they all walked to their next class, Potions.
“I really think that’s his decision,” Harry said. Any tears he had before were long gone, replaced with feelings of anger and frustration.
“Like a log,” he answered, his voice still raspy. “But I’m still tired,” he yawned, smiling when Pansy put some food on his plate. “Thanks.” He looked up to see the family owl in front of him on the table, jumping.
It was an hour till noon and Harry was getting really nervous now. He entered the Gryffindor Common Room.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said finally, unsure if there was really anything else worth saying. “Draco, I don’t know what I’d do with myself if Voldemort uses you to get to me. Whether you do it voluntarily or not; that’s not the point.”
“Draco,” he whispered. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“I haven’t seen you for two years and you greet me like that?” Draco folded his arms. “Not cool, Granger. Oh, sorry, it’s Weasley now, isn’t it?”
“No, I suppose not,” she said. “It’s just… quite sudden and unexpected.”
Two weeks later, when Harry, Hermione and Ron were trying to make their way to the Room of Requirement, Umbridge had caught them with the Inquisitorial Squad. They took the three directly to her office, however the rest of the group was yet to be found.
“Shut up,” Ron spoke up. “Do you really have nothing better to do than obsess over Harry? It almost seems like a personality trait now.”
Pansy pulled up her stockings, holding her champagne in one hand, almost losing her balance. Draco quickly grabbed her glass. “Could you be more careful? You almost spilled that on me!”
When Harry entered the Room of Requirement, he noticed Draco was already sitting at the table. He looked up as the other entered, and the two stared at each other until Harry made his way to the table.
“Shut
“No. Especially not on your birthday,” Draco sat down on the bed again, and Harry followed, gazing at him intently. “Stop looking at me like that.”
bloody stupid. It’s the only logic.”
Groaning in pain, he leaned his head against the bookshelf. Draco walked up to him, kneeling and stroking his forehead. “You’re in worse shape than I thought, darling.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay. Maybe I’ll have a salad…” he frowned, walking past the mirror, then abruptly stopping, staring at his reflection. He put a hand to the brown streak, sighing loudly as he left his room. Narcissa, concerned, followed after.
Harry stood up, moving closer to Draco. “If this was two years ago. Hell, even if it was three years ago, I wouldn’t have doubted this, you - us - even for a second. But… not anymore. Haven’t we pushed this far enough? Haven’t we… tried hard enough? If we were really meant to be together, something would’ve given us a sign.”
“I don’t know,” he answered finally. He couldn’t lie to himself. Cedric may have been an infatuation, sure, but Draco was different. It was everything he felt with Cedric and more. It was stronger. It was the way Draco fiddled with his ring whenever he was focused, it was the way he’d run his hands through his stupid, silky hair at least a thousand times a day, the way his silver eyes sunk into Harry’s, making him feel so on display, yet so safe at the same time. It was the way Draco’s poems were the only thing he was looking forward to in the mornings, and the way Friday evenings were his favorite time of the week.
“So sorry, Professor Snape. The medicine Madame Pomfrey gave him makes him a little forgetful… and a bit dazed.” Hermione explained, grabbing Harry’s textbook from the table, making direct eye contact with Draco.
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said with another eye roll, but stared when he took notice of Draco - his silver eyes were glistening, his hair looked silky as always (Draco finally stopped gelling his hair up), sharp cheekbones, soft looking lips and clothes that complimented his body perfectly. “Wow,” Harry said before he could stop himself.
The Gryffindor gave him a small smile. “I cry all the time. Well, not all the time. I think I felt a few tears come down my face last week when I dropped my book. Now that’s embarrassing isn’t it? I also cried three days ago because I was in the shower and the water wasn’t hot enough,” he rambled. He looked up to see Draco smiling through his tears. “Sorry.”
Looking over to the group that seemed to be politely talking, Harry pursed his lips, then squeezed in beside Hermione, who was the furthest away from Draco in the circle they were standing it.
“Mr. Potter, I would have been willing to overlook this due to your… unfortunate circumstances,” she said, “but you resorted to violence, and you already had detention from Professor Umbridge last week. Both of you will have three weeks of detention with me.”
“Sorry, I fail to see how this is your doing,” Draco replied. “Come on, let’s go to breakfast.” He quickly changed the subject before Pansy could go on an explanation of how it was her doing.
“You really are sorry, then?” Harry asked, staring down at the books in front of him. “Not using me just for your own benefit?”
After some conversation with Luna and the others, they realized it was probably time to make rounds - which was probably the con of showing up late to a party. They were fine to talk to everyone, but all three of them were somewhat dreading going to Draco, Pansy, and Astoria.
oh gosh this is definitely one of my favorite chapters. i loved writing this, and i hoped you loved reading it just as much!
Draco rolled his eyes, but carefully took Harry’s hands and took him to his dorm, gently pushing him into bed, tucking him away, giving him some water to drink before he could fall asleep. Draco stared at Harry for a few seconds, who had his eyes shut, before he gently placed a kiss on his forehead, turning away to leave.
When he entered now, he noticed Draco was at the table, hunched over rather tensely.
Hermione hesitantly slowed down, turning around to look at him, her gaze moving to someone behind him. Harry turned, following her eyes to Blaise, who he guessed had been trying to get his attention.
“Uh… thanks,” he nodded, but turned to Hermione, clearly seeming as if he didn’t believe her.
But the question was, why?
“How did you find this place, anyway?” he cleared his throat, looking around. They were on a cliff and they could barely see the castle in the distance, it was somewhat of a foggy sight. He looked back at Draco, who wasn’t making an attempt to move from his position.
“You literally just told me to let go of you.”
hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Today, as Harry entered the Room of Requirement, he tapped his watch (that was paired with Draco’s) once, which from what he remembered, meant ‘hey’. He got one tap back, which likely meant that Draco was on his way.
Draco stood nearby the entrance of the train station, looking at the large crowds that were either entering or leaving the building. He looked around before staring down at his hands that were trembling.
“Shh, will you? I’m trying to give you a hickey,” Harry mumbled as he bit at Draco’s neck, smiling when he heard Draco trying to hold back a soft moan but failing. Harry looked up and jumped onto Draco, wrapping his legs around his waist, smashing his lips against the other's.
“Harry…” Draco’s eyes were starting to tear up. “I hate you,” he said with a chuckle.
“Is something wrong, Draco?”
“A tad bit strict if you ask me,” he commented, opening the book and staring down at the textbook, smiling to himself. “Don’t consider becoming a professor. Students will hate you.”
“Oh, don’t worry about it, dear. I have loads of things anyway,” Molly said with a smile. “Now, off you two go. It’s getting quite late.”
“Really, just because I said you could visit from time to time doesn’t mean you can pop in any time you wish,” she was saying, running a hand through her short black hair. She pushed the covers off of her and sidled up beside him once she heard him crying. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
It was a kiss with many, many emotions; the main one being lust, this time. They hadn’t met up to study, hang out or anything for the past week. The two were practically thirsty for each other.
There was a small sound from the nearby room, followed by footsteps. Ron was still snoring and the footsteps sounded slightly heavy. Neither Hermione or Ron would be wearing shoes, since they’d have just woken up. It had to be someone dangerous. A Death Eater, maybe?
“I don’t want to go,” he admitted, his voice thick with emotion. “Tell me to stay, Draco. Please.”
“I can’t deal with this. I can’t-” Harry paused, trying to form a sentence amidst of trying not to cry. “I trusted you, with absolutely everything.”
“I don’t see how I spend my Friday evenings is any of your concern, Pansy,” he folded his arms, holding his head up high.
Harry got out his wand too. “I’d like to see how this has nothing to do with me.”
“Well, do you think about him a lot?” she asked. “Do you feel worried about him?”
The Slytherin half-heartedly swayed with the music, looking down at the boy in front of him, who was grinning like an idiot. “God, Potter,” he shook his head, trying to keep a somewhat composed face, “you’re getting all of the beats wrong!”
“Excuse you, I think they’re quite fantastic,” he snapped, folding his arms. “But… does this mean you forgive me?”
“We have twenty minutes till breakfast,” Draco said with an eye roll, “why do you always wake up so late?”
“Draco?”
“Yeah, you did, but the way you behaved was quite ridiculous. I can’t just forgive you like that. I hope you understand it’s sort of hard for me,” he said calmly, then stood up. “Thank you for your apology.”

The two didn’t want to break the uncomfortable silence, so they decided to stay there like that for a few moments.
making me do.”
The promise he had made to himself; that he would make only one letter to Harry to keep for himself, was broken.
“Hi,” he replied after a few moments of hesitation.
“Take good care of him,” She whispered after leaning in, “He’s such a sweetheart. Don’t let him get hurt.”
Harry’s thoughts were scrambled.
********
“Give me a kiss for good luck, at least?” Draco said in a slight whiny tone, and Harry rolled his eyes, turning to Draco and kissing him on the lips softly, wrapping his arms around his neck.
“Good.”
“Merlin, I’m stupid,” Draco squeezed Harry’s hands. “But here, listen to me clearly.” He paused, looking up at him, eyes glinting under the moonlight. He let go of Harry’s hands and as he spoke, he signed, “I love you."
“I’m fine.”
“Of course I do, are you crazy? It’s you, for Merlin’s sake. I’d recognize you if you were in someone else’s body.” Draco replied impatiently, looking around.
“Um… I asked Pansy who asked one of her friends… it’s kind of a long chain, but I got them,” he explained. “Could you try them on?”
“How can you say that? When I have this?” Draco pulled up his sleeve aggressively, looking away. He couldn’t even look at his mark. But to his surprise, Harry took his arm and gently brushed his lips against his mark. “Harry, stop. You’re being an idiot.”
“It was alright,” he answered. “Idle. Boring. Didn’t really do much for me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked among both of them, and Narcissa nudged him. “Go. We’ll meet at dinner.”
“Oh, what are you now, detectives? I sat down because I wanted to make sure that both Dr- Malfoy and I were okay.”
“You understand what this concerns, don’t you, Mr. Potter?” Umbridge asked, and Harry wondered if she was purposely speaking fast so he wouldn’t be able to read her lips. He looked over to Hermione, who started to translate for him through sign language. “None of that will be necessary, Ms. Granger. Who knows what sort of lies you two might be cultivating?”
Closeby, Draco was playing with his food again. “Is it too soon for a second date?” He blurted suddenly, though quietly so only Pansy could hear him. Pansy laughed slightly.
The next few weeks went by completely normal. Harry and Draco were doing a good job of hiding their relationship, and no one got in their way. Harry was finally getting used to things being this way.
“I don’t know how long this will last for,” Harry cut him off, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders, hands trembling slightly. “Just… let me have this.”
After Draco had told her everything, if possible, his grin was even wider than before. “It was perfect. I wasn’t sure if it would go well, you know, considering we couldn’t possibly do what normal couples do, but… we made it work.”
“I’m sure you heard me, Potter. Didn’t you?” Lucius asked in an icy tone. “My son shouldn’t be dating a lowlife like you.”
Then, Harry got up, gently putting his lips to Draco’s hand. Then he slowly let go of Draco’s hand and left to go to class.
“It’s been two years…” Harry whispered. “I’ve changed.”
“No, I’m going,” he raised his voice, walking to the living room. Ron and Hermione followed after, and he stopped. Draco and Pansy left the bathroom as quietly as possible, trying to listen in from the hallway.
“Harry dear, are you leaving already?” Molly asked as she entered the room.
“You can’t just ignore me forever,” she said. The two looked down at the TV remote that was on the coffee table, both scrambling to grab it. They did some back and forth before she eventually won, quickly turning it off. “We need to talk about this. You can’t sit here and mope!”
“Harry Potter is dead!” repeated Voldemort, looking around at everyone. Draco took in a deep breath.
“And… I just broke up with him this morning. I don’t really like him at all.”
“Here they go again…” Hermione stated with an eye roll.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry said, slightly breathless, knowing he had to speak quickly before the countdown was over, “Before midnight, I just want you to know that… that… well… whatever the new year brings us, well I’ll… I’ll still love you and, I will never, ever let you go, and… and I’ll stop being such a pain in the ass.”
The funeral occurred. Draco didn’t show up for the funeral. Ginny stayed close to Harry, attempting to comfort him. It didn’t work at all, for Harry. No matter how mad he was with Draco, no matter how angry and betrayed he felt, he couldn’t help but miss him.
“Can I see you tomorrow?”
“Oh, yes. Just use your wand, like you did with Draco.” A voice inside his head said revoltingly. Harry lowered his wand, his hand trembling, his face going blank. He turned and threw his wand on his bed.
Dodger had returned a few weeks later.
“When does something not happen to me?” he sighed, looking across the room, raising his eyebrows slightly at Draco as if to greet him, who tried not to smile in response, looking back down at his work. “Um… I was kissed.”
When they were finally sent back to their dorm rooms, Harry sunk down on the couch in the Gryffindor Common Room, leaning back, thinking about what Pansy had said. She was right. Draco hadn’t done something the past few months for there to be uncertainty.
Draco just hated how it would never go away. How every time he would look at it for the rest of his life, he would feel instant regret.
The blond, wary, got up from the bed and sat down across from his father. “Is something wrong?”
“He’s been like that all day,” Hermione was saying in a low voice, frowning as she looked over at him. Ron and Ginny turned to look at Harry, who was curled up on the couch in the Gryffindor Common Room, staring into the fire. “Harry,” she said in a gentle voice, tapping him on the shoulder.
“Hmm. For the record, Ron, I wouldn’t kiss you even if I was the saddest person alive.”
“I couldn’t just push her away! She was sad,” he pointed out. “I don’t suppose you would push, I don’t know, Hermione away if she kissed you while she was sad?”
After finding gifts for everyone, they made it back to the store. Since it was the weekend, Hermione and Ron helped him with business at the store, which was busy as always. Piece by piece, Harry was bringing his life back together, one without Draco.
He looked up at him, seeing the determination in Draco’s eyes. “Can’t hurt to try again. Except that it could,” he chuckled, standing up and moving closer to him, only laughing more when the blond rolled his eyes at his joke. Trying to endure the pain, Harry reached out to touch him, only to fall back on the bed, wincing. “Fuck me, that hurts!”
“I...I’m not ly-”
“A… while,” his voice was low, almost as if he was afraid to say it out loud. “You know, with everything that’s going on in my family… he helps me forget. He doesn’t even realize it. And… his laugh is so sweet. It…”
Harry and Ron sat down on either side of Hermione, grateful that she saved a seat for them like she always does.
“No, I just… this week has been so frustrating,” he answered. “Blaise has done practically everything to get on my nerves, and most of the Slytherins keep giving me dirty looks. I have no idea what he told them, but I’m sure it wasn’t something good. And, on top of

“Especially you,” Draco said with an eye roll, taking the waffle from Harry’s hands and starting to eat it. Harry stared at him, pouting, turning away and folding his arms. “Oh, come on, I was just joking!” Draco said when he noticed Harry pouting and being overdramatic. He pulled Harry to face him, pressing his lips on his and kissing him softly. Harry was happy to kiss him right back as their tongues danced in each other’s mouth.
“Excuse you, I think you’re forgetting how Dumbledore literally
“Oh… sorry. I just felt like calling you Dray.” Harry said. He found himself staring deep into Draco’s silver eyes.
“That’s… fine,” he said, shaking his head. “As long as I know that we tried.”
“I’m not,” Draco replied with an eye roll. “I didn’t want Harry to take it the wrong way so I made something up… okay, maybe I’m a little paranoid.”
“Yes. Let us burn it.” Both of them rose to their feet and pushed their chairs to the table. Sirius stayed seated. “Do not burn yourselves”, he warned, while Harry and Draco were leaving the dining room. The fire, which consumed every last bit of a part of Draco’s past lightened up the evening sky with a warm red and melted into the departing sun. So, the two young men stood there, in unity, and watched it burn.
“Do you want to burn the letter?” While Draco had been speaking, Harry had thought of a way, how he could help him. His break up with Ginny left him with nothing really, when he met her to tell her, that it was over. She took it on the chin and they went their separate ways. But Harry knew that he wanted to walk with Draco from now on.
Hermione was standing next to me – her wand at the ready. It was quiet. So silent, that you could hear a pin drop. Although, even that sound, of the pin hitting the floor, would be muffled by the grass. There was absolutely no noise. Without noticing, we had all held our breaths. The death eaters on the other side of the hill were turning themselves towards us. The person in the middle of the forming battlefield turned their back to us and faced them. Simultaneously, we let out our breath and got ready. The fight was on.
“You do not mean that, father. That’s what you said to me after the battle ended and then you disappeared.” Draco rose to his feet and so did I. “You were never proud of me and you never will be. I am just a puzzle piece in your big scheme. But somehow, however, you try to turn and twist it, I do not fit. I will never fit in. Because I do not want to. I am good the way I am. Do you know how long I had to pretend to be okay with what you and your colleagues were doing? I was not okay with it. I was scared. I was fucking scared and scarred.” He rolled up the sleeve of his shirt and revealed the mark, which was pulsating since the one at the sky had not yet disappeared. “It pains me to see this! I was chosen to kill Dumbledore because you were too much of a coward to step up. You had the responsibility to protect me. You were responsible. But you failed to be a good parent. For that I hate you. I despise every inch of your being. Every time I have to look at or think about you, I get the urge to throw up, destroy something, or scream. You took everything from me. You are not my father, but rather a tyrant and a close-minded pure blood fanatic.” Draco inhaled deeply and pulled down the sleeve to cover his mark. He had a way of holding speeches like this one. I already realized this, while we were still at Hogwarts. That was it, what amazed me so much about him.
Draco, who was sitting in bed, WSL book in his hands, was taken aback when he saw him standing by his bed, frowning. “Potter,” he said. “What are you doing here? Got yourself injured again or something?”
“Can I ask you something?” Draco asked once Harry looked at him again. “Why do you keep staring at the ceiling?”
“You swore to obey me, Harry. Go!”
“Wouldn’t be normal for them if they weren’t arguing about something stupid,” Pansy replied as she walked up to the four along with Luna. Draco and Harry gasped dramatically before they shot everyone a look.
Ron and Hermione had, of course, questioned Harry about what happened. They only got one sentence in response.
“Uh, nothing.” He replied, grinning as he looked away and sat down beside Hermione.
“And I you.”
He was surprised, to say the least, and to be frank, he wasn’t sure if he liked this new side of Draco. “Um… you know, you don’t need to come every Friday if you don’t want to,” Harry pointed out. “I’m sure you’re busy with friends.”
“Right…” he said. “If you’ll excuse me, then…” he stood up and left the room. This was how every visit was for him. It was lonely, cold, and silent. He thought of Harry, wondering if he was alright. They wouldn’t be able to communicate except for letters. Draco realized he would probably have to send his letters early in the morning to avoid the risk of his father or anyone reading it.
Harry spent the next few days wondering why Draco would even want to fight Blaise for something like that. It wasn’t like they were that good friends, right? While he felt like he could talk to him about things, he didn’t realize that they were at that stage.
“Seeing as that took you twenty minutes…” Harry said, ignoring Draco’s sly insult, he took out a book from his bag. “This helped me learn the basics. Just flick through it whenever you have time. For now just go through the first chapter.”
“I’m sorry about Sirius, Harry. And I’m sorry about my father.”
Harry turned to look at him, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Well, it’s not like you should be telling me anyway. Don’t you have some sort of pact, I don’t know, where you can’t say it out loud?”
“I don’t see it that way,” he shook his head. “I just… I’ve been afraid that if I say something, he could potentially tell his father or Voldemort. That’s what our argument was about. It’s been hard for me to trust him because of my fear.”
“And him and Lavender?”
“Draco… you shouldn’t have lashed out like that to your father.” Narcissa said with a sigh. “He’s not too happy. I know you’re upset that you can’t leave this place, but…”
“Since when do you care what’s said about Potter? Don’t tell me you’ve become his bodyguard, just like the Weasel and the Mudblood. Or worse, don’t tell me he’s won your heart over,” he let out a loose laugh. “Got a boyfriend, have we? Feeling a bit protective?”
“It’ll get better.”
Harry was looking around before slowly turning to Draco. “I’m really sad, you know,” Harry blurted, his green eyes widened as he stared into Draco’s silver ones. “You know Malfoy?”
The reason Draco had been fighting was gone.
“Yes, but… he’s also apologetic, kind, nerdy, and stupid,” Harry sighed. “And it’s so easy to be around him. We were friends for a few months before and even had a while to try it out. So, please, just don’t tell anyone, okay? Especially when I don't even know where our relationship is going to go after this…”
Hermione sighed. “What happened?” She asked in a hushed voice. Ginny stared at the three. Just as Harry opened his mouth to speak, all three of them turned to look at Ginny who was staring at them intently.
“Hi,” Draco spoke finally.
Both Hermione and Ron stood in front of him somewhat menacingly. “Are you going to tell us why the hell you and Malfoy were talking about
“Calm down, Hermione,” Ron said with a slight laugh. Hermione raised an eyebrow offendedly, turning to face Ron, who took a step back, “Only joking. You don’t need to calm down, because you are calm…”
“Fuck right off, Hermione,” he rolled his eyes, folding his arms. “Wow. Okay, um, cool. I’ll… see you guys later.”
“My, my,” Harry said as he saw Draco sprawled on the couch, WSL book in his hands. “It’s the last day before the holidays and you’re
“Malfoy!”
He looked around at Molly, Ginny, and Ron, who were all smiling at him. “It’s probably way too expensive,” he muttered, putting the newspaper down. “And we don’t even know if it would work. My hearing was lost because of dark magic.”
“Harry. I simply do not have the time nor am I willing to put in the effort to argue with you over anything of this sort. We have
“I never loved you,” said Draco. His eyes looked different, and he had a different expression on his face. “I was always working for Voldemort - dating you was just one of my tasks.”
It seemed that this year was not going to go well.
“Okay.”
“She’s got game,” Pansy shrugged, putting a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. He rolled his eyes at her. “You have to give her that. But I wouldn’t be too disappointed. He clearly doesn’t like her."
Draco licked his lips, reaching out and stroking Harry’s hair gently. “I know. But the rules kept us safe.”
Pansy paused, then nodded. “I know, Draco, and I’m not trying to-”
“And you’re unhappy you had your first kiss because…?” Ron asked, folding his arms.
He gulped. “...okay,” was all he could say. She couldn’t know about him and Harry, could she? He had tried his best to not speak of Harry at all, and he spent most of his time in his room when he wasn’t being forced to attend Death Eater meetings.
“Cons of declaring me your enemy in first year,” Harry said with a sigh, looking into Draco’s eyes.
Draco shrieked once again, “WHO THE FUCK IS THAT IN MY PHONE, HARRY? YOU CAN TRAP PEOPLE IN THIS DEVICE? I DON’T WANT IT! GET IT AWAY FROM ME!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nothing?! Draco, you almost died!”
“No. I won’t let you kill him.”
“Uh, can we get back to the conversation, please?” Harry asked awkwardly, shifting as Draco faked a gag. Ron and Hermione slowly pulled apart, breathless and grinning, turning back to Draco and Harry.
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice called from his left. Harry immediately turned to Hermione, causing Ginny’s lips to touch his cheek instead of his lips. Startled, Harry flinched backward. Harry had to say something since it had gotten awkward.
“Wow, you look nice,” She smiled, gazing at Harry’s sweater and pants. “Simple, but classy.”
“I didn’t say that-”
“Right, so what did I just say?”
“No,” he sighed. “That you have to see me cry.”
“What are you on about, Potter?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Draco visibly cringed, biting his lip. “I’m sorry. I didn’t-”
Just then, Draco heard a faint tapping against the window. He slowly turned around and saw an owl tapping its beak against the window. He slowly opened it and let the owl come in, realizing that it was Dodger, the Malfoy family’s owl.
Hermione stared at the two of them. “I… genuinely can’t tell if you two are dating or are still enemies,” she said, then paused. “Harry, what’s that in your ears? Oh my God, are those the Wizarding hearing aids?”
Harry shook his head. He opened his mouth to speak. “
“Um… what was that about?” Harry asked once the chatter slowly started up again.
Harry closed the space between them, and in that moment, he knew he didn’t have to answer the man in front him. In that moment, it felt as if he was in Sixth Year at Hogwarts. That they had just made it to their tent and could kiss and cuddle and make out as much as they liked. Things were simple - or as simple as things could be for them - back then.
“Why didn’t you want to say anything?” he asked quietly.
Pansy was expecting him to scoff or be annoyed, but much to her surprise, he looked up, his eyes watery, nodding. Startled, she nodded, quickly getting up, gesturing for him to come with her. She linked her arm through his and they went up to the Astronomy Tower. Pansy knew this was a place, if anything, would help calm him down.
“...Maybe a cat too?”
*******
“Yes. Now pretend to laugh at something I just said.” Pansy ordered.
Harry had taken his time with drinking the two bottles, but he still felt slightly dizzy as he took ahold of the third bottle, deciding it was too tiring for him to stand up. He slowly walked towards the couch, trying not to fall over in the process. Eventually, he made it to the sofa, sitting down beside a white-haired male, almost falling right on top of him.
“That would be most appreciated, thank you. Is there any way I could repay you?” Harry mocked, wondering if he was pushing it too far. But he couldn’t stop the words slipping out of his mouth. Draco bit his lip, showing a clear sign of unappreciation. He grabbed a hold of Harry’s hand and handed him his wand.
“That bracelet looks nice,” Pansy smiled as she sat down beside him in the Great Hall. “Did someone get it for you for Christmas?”
“It’s okay. You’re hurting right now.”
“Would it be totally weird for me to say that I do?”
“But now I’m
“It’s been over a year and a half, Father. I’m
“Oh shut up, I’m not cute. If anything, you’re the cute one.” Draco teased back. “Messy hair, round glasses? Cute.”
“Just break up with Lavender!” Harry said matter-of-factly.
He stopped talking as soon as he saw Draco standing in the doorway. Turning back around, he continued to stock the shelves.
He looked down at the letter in his hand, folding it. “Forget it, Harry,” he said, wiping his tears away quickly. “I’m fine.”
He had betrayed Harry. He had no right to try and calm down Harry, or to even help him.
“On it,” Draco said at once, turning to his closet. “Go drink water. If you get lost, call out to me.”
“Ron!” Molly Weasley called from downstairs.
He was wearing a maroon sweater and jeans. His eyes were greener than usual. Draco put a hand to the waistband of his trousers to check if his shirt was tucked in properly, gulping.
“Don’t joke about it. Now, if it’s actually hurting, do you want me to help?”
Horrible. He felt horrible.
“Tell me one thing, Harry,” he spoke again. “Why the fuck did you tell me I’m worth the risk?”
Now, as it stung, memories from sixth year were slowly flooding back. All he could wonder was, why was it stinging? Harry had the same question about his scar. He slowly put a hand to his scar before looking up at Draco.
“I think it’s better if we go,” Ron said, “I don’t know if ‘Mione will come-”
“Your father has heard of some wizarding hearing aids being made. Not a cure, but… it would help me hear again.”
Draco just smiled, knowing even if he spoke, it would be pointless. Harry couldn’t see nor hear him. Bringing out his broom, he nudged Harry, who put his hand out.
“You know, I completely forgot that we were doing lunch.”
Draco looked over at Harry now, who was scribbling away on a piece of paper, mouthing to himself the words he was writing. He smiled slightly to himself. Whatever happened the next day, would happen.
Harry lifted up his right hand, maybe to smack the other playfully, but he ended up turning to face Draco, cupping his cheek, looking far into his silver, glistening eyes, leaning in close, close enough to feel Draco’s gentle breathing on his lips. Draco stared back into Harry’s shining green eyes as he laid back on the bed, wondering what was going through the other’s mind.
Harry was smiling awkwardly, “and here I thought I was stupid for saying it to you,” he mumbled, adjusting the hearing aids on his ears. “I love you too, Draco.”
“Not as much.”
Shrugging on a sweater, Harry followed him outside to the Common Room, where Hermione and Ginny were conversing. The two looked up at him inquisitively. “You’re coming?” Hermione signed. He quickly signed back ‘yes’.
“Took the words right out of my mouth,” Draco replied, his silver eyes glistening, before shaking his head. “No, you keep it, for as long as you need, love.”
The redhead stared at him in confusion. “Yes, that’s how relationships work. I think so, at least. Why? Who told you this?”
“Let’s talk in the other room, I don’t want them to know you’re here,” Harry said quietly. They went up to Harry’s room, where Draco remained tense, eyebrows creased into a frown.
Draco and Harry jumped so suddenly that Harry had to lean against the table, and Draco hit his head against the wall, quickly pulling his pants up before Narcissa could walk in. Narcissa walked in, smiling as she set down the tray of hot tea, before looking up. She studied Draco’s messy hair and unbuttoned shirt, and the fresh hickey on his neck, before going to Harry who’s glasses were tilted, his shirt was half tucked and half untucked, and then taking in a deep breath.
Harry loved her sometimes. He quickly snuck away and walked up to the room of requirement, sighing when he saw it was empty. Maybe Draco had just left, or maybe he hadn’t had a chance to get away.
“You’re strange,” she commented. “But you seem… happier. Did something happen? Did Malfoy get into trouble or something?”
Harry turned and left the dorm, shutting the door behind, leaving the three confused as hell.
She chuckled, taking his hand and firmly shaking it. “I know. Nice to meet you, though.”
Was he totally stupid for ruining things between them? He just didn’t want things to get complicated. Although, things between Harry and Draco couldn’t ever be simple. With their love, there would always be a little hatred, and with their hatred, there would always be a little love to spare.
“It’s
“Wow, Potter, just when I thought you couldn’t get more stupid,” Draco said with venom in his voice. “Are you sure your glasses even work?”
“If you find any, feel free throw them at me.”
Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s. “I love you too.”
“Yeah yeah,” he leaned forward and stared at the picture of Harry seeming somewhat bewildered by the flash of the photo, a nervous smile on his face. “He looks nice. Despite the nasty title.”
“Gee, thanks,” Ron scoffed, and the three let out a small chuckle. Harry turned around to look for Draco. It was Friday evening, which meant it was almost time for them to meet in the Room of Requirement to study, but he seemed to be nowhere in sight. Maybe he had finished up already.
Another meeting as the summer came to end and autumn began. This time, Draco was forced to join the meeting.
“Not as well as you!”
“Fuck off,” Harry whispered. “This is probably just a fucking relief for you than anything else. Stop with the fake tears.”
“Malfoy’s missing too,” Ron said. Draco and Harry stopped short when they heard Ron say that.
“It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he said. “I don’t want you to feel like I’m forcing you to do anything.”
“Breakfast is about to be over in five minutes, just wait a bit, Draco,” Pansy said with an eye roll. “But oh, what can you do. Love is hard to handle, I understand.”
Hermione walked to their table and set Harry’s textbooks down. “Draco’s totally worried. You can completely see it on his face. This’ll get him to talk to Harry for sure!” Hermione told Pansy somewhat excitedly. Harry was barely listening, he was more focused on trying to focus which was barely working.
“Well, that doesn’t concern you in the slightest,” Lucius shrugged, then noticed the look in Draco’s eyes. “...alright. On your wedding day, I will undo the curse. Are you happy with that? You can explain to Potter after a wedding ring on your finger. And, for Merlin’s sake, ditch that brown streak hairstyle. It doesn’t suit you.”
“I didn’t bring up
GUYS I'm so sorry for a late update! I had the worst block and I couldn't write. I hope you liked this chapter! Merry Christmas!
Hope you liked it!
“I was going to explain. I was going to explain everything.” Draco turned to face Harry. “But you… you…”
“Well, I am telling you to stop dating Potter.”
The two eventually stopped kissing. Not because they wanted to, but because Draco’s Dark Mark was starting to burn, and Harry’s scar was hurting too.
“So, Draco,” Arthur Weasley started, “How come you and Harry are friends after all these years?”
“I wish,” Draco sighed, “but Pansy, Blaise and me are going to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Besides, we’ve spent two days together already.”
“Wait a minute,” Ron spoke up. “The letters from D… they were from
Harry spoke finally, reaching out and putting a hand to Draco’s head. “Gelled.”
, Harry,” she stressed, trying to keep her composure, “but he may be in a position where he can’t choose. All I’m saying is… can’t this wait until things have cleared up more? If it ever does…”
“Well, yeah,” Draco said as he started to kiss Harry’s neck.
, Ms. Granger!” she raised her voice. Her patience seemed to be wearing thin. Harry caught the eye of Draco, who seemed just annoyed as he did. “Mr. Fudge will be here soon. I need to greet him. Meanwhile, all of you,” she snapped her fingers to the Inquisitorial Squad, “find the rest of the group.”
“What word is that?” Harry pointed to his hands. “Did you actually learn the signs for the potions?”
“...Friday, yeah.”
And before he knew it, Harry was kissing him.
“Harry-”
“Almost?”
“Hey,” he said, taking a small step back.
It was Harry, after all.
Harry didn’t even pay attention as the class started, he was too self-conscious of the fact that Draco was right there beside him. After twenty minutes or so into the lesson, Harry felt a hand touch his thigh from under the table.
Harry exchanged glances with Draco, before sighing. “I’ll explain it later. For now, we need to focus on the actual matter at hand. It had to be someone from the group,” he spoke, turning his attention to his friends.
“Harry, what the hell are you doing?” Hermione snapped, leaning over and picking up his books. She followed Harry’s gaze and realized what was wrong. “Oh, it’s just Malfoy; it’s okay, Harry.”
“Ron, the dress dark purple, not blue.”
Draco was gazing out the window. When he heard Harry coming up the stairs, he moved aside, making sure to be a good five feet apart from him (cause they’re not gay).
“Actually, I was,” Harry replied, standing up as he shut his books and dumped them into his bag.
Harry let out a sigh of relief, feeling a huge weight on his shoulders leaving all of a sudden. He opened the box to see a necklace, with the letter D in silver “D?”
“Point taken,” Harry said finally. “It’s not as if you could’ve told me this earlier.”
His face turned pink. “For the last time, you need to stop looking at our letters! That’s private stuff!”
Realization hit Harry.
Draco, who was still suspiciously staring at the phone as if it could kill him at any moment, hesitantly pressed down on the home button.
As the past week had passed, Draco had been growing nervous. He remembered that Harry too needed to know if their relationship was worth it. He had been trying to tell himself that it was okay; and he had to be grateful for even having a month of Harry Potter. He did not know what love was, and the more time he spent with Harry, he wondered if that was what it was. Enjoying the green in his eyes, his gentle touch, his lips. Perhaps it was the way the snow seemed prettier and how the sunrise was brighter.
“Harry, will you stop obsessing over Malfoy?” Hermione suddenly said, practically glaring at Harry. “This is the third time this week you’ve shown up late to breakfast! You’ve got to stop.”
“Run along, now.” Draco pushed Harry in the direction of the Gryffindor Tower, not giving him time to ask him anything. Harry, confused, walked to his dorm as Draco told him to do so.
“What’s going on?” Hermione asked as she poked her head round the door, confused. She stared at the scene before her, then shook her head, going back inside the living room. Harry and Ron followed suit, sitting down beside each other.
”Well, try your best to make that answer a yes. I’m sure he just needs some time, alright?” Pansy said sympathetically. “You two just need to... rekindle your love?”
“So… uh… be with me for one month. Now, I’m not sure if it could work out either. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to try. Draco, I’ve never felt this way about anyone before. Not to this extent.”
Snape started the class and told them to write an essay. Since Harry sat on the right and Draco on the left side of the table, it was helpful. Draco was left handed and Harry was right-handed, so the two could hold hands under the table. Of course, it was risky so the two did it very slowly and calmly so Snape wouldn’t notice.
As Harry, Hermione and Ron dissolved into a silent conversation through sign language, Draco walked over to stand beside Pansy, frowning. She took his hand and squeezed it gently, trying to give him a reassuring look.
She was silent. “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize it would…”
Harry stared at him for a few moments, unsure of what to say. For someone who had told him he didn’t love him anymore, this was strange to hear. “Er… well they usually all hang out without me, and even when I do go, I just… I don’t know… I’ve kind of been out of touch with my friends.”
“Never.”
“Very well then. You know my father once said that you always find a friend in someone you wouldn’t expect.” Luna told them with a smile. “So what were you two talking about if you aren’t friends?” Luna asked, well aware that she was being nosy.
“Hey, Malfoy isn’t here.” Ron pointed out. Hermione and Ron stared at each other for a few seconds before bursting into laughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I-I overreacted. I was just hurt. I thought you were on his side. I didn’t know,” Harry whispered. “I shouldn’t have pushed you away so harshly. I shouldn’t have acted the way I did.
“Hey, you’re the one who brought it up.”
Draco Malfoy’s smile; the calm after the storm. Harry wished Draco could be the calm after every storm to come. That he would be there to conquer the storm with him. That’s all Harry really wanted.
Harry looked at him for a long moment. He could feel butterflies in his stomach, but he was unsure why.
Pansy pulled the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them, walking after Harry, who was now at the entrance of the Gryffindor Common Room. He stopped right at the portrait.
Draco stared at Pansy, shocked. “Really?”
“Three?” he echoed, outraged.
They lasted in silence for about ten minutes, until Harry looked up to see him gazing frustratedly down at the book, shaking his head. “Do you need help?” he asked.
“Where is he?” Draco said, clutching something in his hands tightly. “You said he exited the building!”
“I say, you’re being stupid,” Draco stated, looking down at his coffee. “Seriously. Don’t you think it’s better to just leave it? I mean, I already got three weeks of detention. I don’t need anymore at the risk of being caught. Besides, I’m a prefect.”
Harry didn’t reply, simply stuffed his face with food so he wouldn’t have to answer. Hermione rolled her eyes, but sympathetically put a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it gently.
“No, no,” he shook his head. “You’re not going to turn this around on me.” he shut his eyes for a moment, then opened them to look at her. “How long have you known?”
“Harry, if you honestly believe that, then I don’t know what to say to you,” Draco said, his expression faltering suddenly. The two were silent for a moment, then he spoke again. “I don’t know what you want me to do! You told me this was worth the risk.”
“Hello,” he said, adjusting the hearing aid in his ear, smiling awkwardly.
Harry grinned, taking his hand and shaking it firmly. “Yes, please.”
“How’s Ron?”
“Mr. Potter, you don’t take me for a fool, do you?” Snape asked icily. “Please come to the front of the class to sit beside Malfoy.”
Draco slowly stood up, grimacing as he remembered about Astoria Greengrass kissing him. “Alright, fine. What do you want it to say?”
They walked towards the railing, and Pansy looked up at the stars, smiling sympathetically when she heard him sniffle. “He can’t trust you?” she asked, rubbing his back soothingly as he kept his eyes on the sky.
“Yeah, that’s true…” Draco said with a sigh. “Just… after you
Harry, face flushed, folded the poem and placed it in the box he had. He was thinking of getting another box as his current one was almost overflowing. The Saturday coming up would be there one month anniversary, and he couldn’t help but be nervous. Although they were having fun, did it necessarily mean that he was worth the risk? He didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t want to grow attached to Draco, only to have him break his heart.
“You okay, love?” Draco asked softly as he sat down beside Harry, who was frowning as he took a sip of his coffee.
Harry pulled Draco away from the crowd, taking him to the side. They were on a sort of rooftop, so they were looking at the fireworks from a distance from where the display actually was.
“I thought that meant you wanted me to let go of you.”
“Potter!” came Draco’s voice from behind. “Potter!”
“It was a handshake of
“Hey...” Ginny appeared out of nowhere. She had been crying. Hermione walked over to her and asked her what was wrong. “Dean and I had a fight.” Ginny glanced over to look at Harry to see his reaction, but he was busy watching Draco.
Draco stared at his door for a few seconds. It seemed like he had no choice - Lucius had taken this to far. Draco took large steps back, before charging against his door, hitting his body against it with full force.
However, the medicine that Madame Pomfrey had forced Harry to drink made him a little forgetful.
“Are these yours?” Harry asked, noticing the initials ‘D.M.’ on the left side of the silk pajama shirt.
“How was the dancing?”
And just like that, Dumbledore was gone. Everything would change. Nothing would ever quite stay the same anymore. Harry, as he moved down the stairs to chase the Death Eaters, tried not to think about what that meant for Draco and him.
“Oh, you know me, I’m perfect,” she grinned. “How’s your Potions store? I’ve been meaning to visit!”
“Harry, I want to know what happened between you and Draco.”
“I suppose so. I’m sure you realize that me and him have not… been in touch lately.”
“The summer break…” Draco drifted off into silence. “This past summer break…”
“How is everyone, by the way?” Draco asked.
He stared at her, frowning. “Have I become a huge burden on you?” he asked, looking over to Ron, who was sitting across from them.
“The first class we have is Defence Against the Dark Arts with Snape,” Hermione stated, before listing out all of the classes they had. Harry focused on his food, only half paying attention to Hermione when a dreamy voice behind him spoke.
“So, I heard about-”
“You don’t need to explain.” Harry cut him off. “This is what you’ve been spending the past few weeks doing, haven’t you? Canceling Saturdays, not coming to class? I’m not stupid. I knew something was up. I just… can’t believe it was this.”
“How did you even get it?” Harry asked out loud, realizing he was way too bad at sign language to be able to understand him. “These were in my dorm.”
“Oh, I apologize. I didn’t quite feel hungry,” he turned back to his journal, staring down at his half-written poem. He shut it and turned to look at her. “I woke up a few hours ago, but… I couldn’t quite sleep last night. I just needed to gather myself.”
Harry watched him go in disbelief.
“He had mentioned in the letters that his father wasn’t particularly happy with Draco. Maybe he’s not letting Draco come to Hogwarts.” Pansy said carefully, looking over to Hermione before turning to Harry.
“Oh, um, dispute,” Hermione signed it for him again, then once more slowly, smiling proudly. “I just learned it yesterday.”
Draco clenched his fists, chewing on his bottom lip - all he wanted was to see Harry. But it seemed like that was too much to as for. “Really, now?” said Draco in a firm annoyed tone, “I think it’s best if I listen to my mother.”
“You liked Cho Chang?!”
Draco took a step forward. “If you want to be competent in a duel, Harry, you need to learn to fight without hearing aids. Chances are, once anyone sees them, they’re going to knock it right off your ears.”
“What, Harry? Just tell me, I won’t judge you,” Hermione said in a comforting tone, sitting down beside him.
“Ah, dear, I don’t know much about what happened there, but… you two were so great together. It just seemed so… how do I say it? It felt right to see you two as a couple. I always knew you were a good kid. But… if you’re happy with Astoria, then that’s what matters.”
He sighed, opening the door for her to enter. She shut the door behind them, frowning. “What’s wrong?”
Pansy cleared her throat. “Okay, I’m gonna leave before you both start fucking right here,” she announced, walking over and slapping Harry on the back. “You’re not bad, Potter. Not at all. I think you genuinely have a chance against that wanker.”
“Well… today’s Ron’s birthday, as you know. It was supposed to be really great, but he ate some chocolates that were for me - and they ended up having a love potion in them. So I had to take him to Slughorn-”
(p.s. I didn't proofread the chapter! I'll do it a bit later, sorry early readers if it's a bit wonky or some grammar is bad)
Harry thought what Pansy was saying was utterly ridiculous, stupid and uncalled for, but he simply nodded, too tired to argue, so he just slowly shook off Pansy’s hand. Harry only liked Draco’s touch. Everyone else squeezed his hand too tight, or too less. Harry pushed away that thought, walking away from Pansy and entering his dorm.
just in case there's any confusion :)
“I used a spell from the Half-Blood Prince’s textbook, that was made for enemies.”
Harry woke the next day and got ready before going to breakfast. Everyone got their schedules and so did he. Harry glanced over at the Slytherin table in the hall, only to see that Draco wasn’t there. He opened his mouth to say something about it to Ron when Harry saw Draco entering the Hall.
“What? I’m just asking. Besides, I was talking to Harry. I know you’ll tell me absolutely nothing.” Pansy said reasonably. Harry stepped out from behind Draco.
“It was actually 10-9, which is pretty close.”
“And you don’t hate me?”
He shook his head. “No, I suppose not. It’s not mine anyway.”
Hearing the door chime as someone entered, Harry cursed under his breath then turned around. “I’m sorry, we’re closed-”
“Oh, fuck off!” Harry snapped as he slammed his hand against the steering wheel. “I swear you cheated.”
?” Hermione asked, folding her arms.
He just hoped that Harry would be there for him.
“Fucking hell, Draco, weren’t you just-”
“You did! You led me on! I can’t believe you!” Tears were falling down her face and she was glaring at Harry. “Why did you kiss me back then? That day?”
“I felt horrible. I felt betrayed, mostly. I didn’t want to eat. I couldn’t sleep. I cared too much about what happened, and no matter how much I tried to convince myself
Harry sat on the floor of his room. He literally felt that there was no point of staying at Hogwarts if he didn’t get to see Draco - one of the main reasons he wanted to come back to Hogwarts was because of him. Harry ran a hand through his hair, slowly standing up.
“Don’t,” he shook his head. “If I ask, you’ll have to explain, and…” he looked down at Draco’s Dark Mark that was half covered by his sleeve. “And I don’t want to go down that road. Not tonight.”
One week before the wedding, Draco picked up his quill, unsure of what to say to Harry. Maybe there was nothing to say. Maybe there was too much to say in one letter. But all he could think of when the quill touched the paper was scribbling on it vigorously.
“Fuck off,” Draco said through tears, “Just let me apologize.”
Draco’s eyes moved to the two brooms. “Where’s Harry?”
“Course not,” he said up, a cheeky smile on his face, wondering why his face felt so hot. “Back to work?”
“I always think you’re pathetic anyway. Isn’t that the whole point?” Harry asked, lightly patting him on the shoulder to ease the tension. He wondered why there needed to be tension at all. Draco was probably the one person he had talked to the most in the past three weeks.
“H...Harry, what… what are you doing here?” Draco stuttered, standing right in front of something that looked like a closet, so Harry wouldn’t see it.
Standing up, Harry walked over and - uncomfortably - sat on Draco’s lap until he settled, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder, who wrapped his arms around him. “Do you need to do your homework now? Or we could…”
“I know, Harry.”
“I’m not happy,” Draco said before he could stop himself. “I imagined the rest of my life with you. Now I have to spend it with some… some woman. We don’t love each other. Not in the slightest.”
“So, Harry, are you really just friends with Draco? Because well… I saw you kissing, and being friends with benefits really isn’t a good idea, not that I’m speaking from experience, I just had a friend-”
The rest of the Death Eaters arrived, along with Snape.
“Well… uh…” Hermione struggled to answer. She turned to Pansy, hoping she would answer.  To her dismay, Pansy suddenly looked very interested in a nearby duck that was waddling around, which was completely unaware of the serious situation. “Pansy.” Hermione snapped annoyedly.
Harry looked up at the ceiling again. “Yeah… yeah, it’s… it is what it is.”
This chapter... wow. I mean, I hope you like it?
“Yes?”
“I have a date with someone,” Harry said slowly, looking down and playing with the sleeves of his sweater. Hermione shut her book almost immediately.
Tears were starting to spill down Draco’s cheeks as the words echoed into his brain. “Harry, please, no.”
He sighed. “It isn’t exactly a huge emergency. It’s just… um…”She frowned, walking closer to him. “What’s up?"
“Harry?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. He was so sure he had asked for the other room. Was it because Harry was here?
“I think he mentioned something about meaning to give it to Dumbledore or something, but that isn’t important, what’s important is-” Harry went on a long rant, but Draco’s ears were suddenly closed. He knew immediately what the drink was. Breaking eye contact from Harry, he looked down at his feet, guilt and resentment hitting his chest.
“I keep things real,” Harry shrugged, smirking. Staring into Draco’s silver eyes were almost intoxicating. He felt like an idiot for letting him take his breath away, but he couldn’t help it. Draco was perfect. No, he wasn’t perfect. But he was beautiful, and his imperfections is what Harry loved the most about him.
Before they knew it, everyone was counting down.
“Do you need me to get you some water?” Draco asked as he finished changing into his silk pajamas.
“M-maybe.” Draco stuttered, suddenly very embarrassed.
“Come down now!” she shrieked, pulling the covers off of him and grabbing his arm. Harry barely had time to answer as she dragged him downstairs excitedly, then shoved a newspaper in his face. Raising an eyebrow, he looked down at the article.
As he entered, he mumbled a quick ‘hey’, making his way to the table and dropping his bag on the ground. Taking a seat, he flinched when Draco slammed his hands on the table, forcing Harry to look at him.
“...Daphne Greengrass?” Ron asked.
The silver-eyed boy stepped towards the sink, gathering some water in his hand and rubbing it over the spot in Harry’s hair. “It’s easier if I do it,” he said when he noticed Harry staring at him, wide-eyed.
Snape slowly entered. “Draco, I need to talk to you.”
“Alright, so I don’t really know what Malfoy likes, but I got my favorite,” Ron said, handing Harry a paper plate that had a freshly made waffle with chocolate syrup, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream. Pansy stared down at Draco who had a faraway look in his eyes as he stared at the ground, slightly confused as to why he seemed so upset.
A couple - or a dozen - drinks later, Draco was, needless to say, drunk. Molly found it quite funny, because he was starting to be overly honest about everything, and practically rambling about useless things, such as the music or the people around them.
“I’m sorry…” she was saying, “I just… miss him terribly, especially as we learn all of this.”
“You’re different.”
As Harry walked down, he heard some movement. Harry slowly looked up and jumped when he noticed Draco standing right in front of him.
“I…” The way they looked at each other? He hadn’t really ever paid attention to that. “I don’t know. I guess only time will tell.”
On Monday morning, Harry made his way to class. He was nowhere near in a state to be out of bed, but he had forced Madame Pomfrey to let him come to class. He had no choice but to do so, with their exams coming up in just a few months.
“For fuck’s sake,” he said under his breath, then looked up. “Yes. It was about you.”
“Did Malfoy just shout that he’s not gay?” Ron asked, confused.
It took a few moments to process what had happened.
“You don’t have to be so careful. At this rate, we might have to start shouting to be able to hear each other,” Harry snorted.
Harry and Draco smiled at Molly, saying bye to everyone before turning. Molly tapped Harry on his shoulder, and he turned around, wondering why she was calling him back.
They both turned to the now even further extended room, a large bed in the corner. “We could go to bed, you mean?” Draco asked, looking down at him. “Hm… maybe. If I get the right side.”
Meanwhile, Harry slowly made his way to the Potion’s closet. As he got inside, he turned on the light and tried to shut the door behind him, but someone was there. Harry immediately turned, hoping and praying it wasn’t a Professor.
“Saint Potter is wearing a Slytherin Quidditch jumper,” a snarky voice said, “how did he land his hands on one? Oy, Potter, did you steal it from us?”
Hermione, impatient, tapped him on the shoulder. “Harry, what the hell are you two on about?” she asked, but he didn’t even look in her direction, too fixated on Draco.
********
Molly laughed lightly. “I’m glad you like it, dear. Please do come back before you go back to Hogwarts-”
Harry bit his lip, taking a long sip from the bottle of Firewhiskey, “Can I trust you?” He asked in a low voice, staring at the other intently, leaning in. Draco nodded, and Harry burst into hysterical giggles. “Okay, shh… you can’t tell anyone. I’m… I’m in love with Draco Malfoy.”
Harry nodded, smiling at Draco. “I know, Draco.”
“So… America, huh?” Harry said, folding his arms. Astoria, Ron and Hermione had already left, and the Weasleys were upstairs, getting ready for bed. The two sat outside, neither one quite ready to leave yet.
“My face or the sunrise?”
He felt betrayed. Another person had left him, a person he trusted deeply. There was an unbearable feeling dawning on Harry’s chest.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I really don’t think I need to stand up-”
“Hey, I was just making a joke!” Harry defended, putting his hands in the air.
“Let me make it a bit clearer to you,” Harry said, “As long as I’m alive, I won’t let you hurt Draco. And that’s a promise.” Harry set down Lucius’ wand on the counter, before turning to exit the kitchen.
“I’m not-” Noticing his expression, Harry’s eyes darkened. He folded his arms. “What do you want me to say? That I’m having nightmares of someone who died because of me? Because it was my fault? Or do you want to know about the visions I’ve been getting? Talking about isn’t going to help me.”
Hermione put a hand on his shoulder. “Draco? It’s time to tell him. He deserves to know. The pain he’s in, it’s… it hurts to watch him go through it every day.”
“Don’t. You know you shouldn’t.”
“I should have.” He mumbled, looking away from Harry. Harry put up his hand and slapped Draco right in the face.
It was the book Snape had given him to read. Draco remembered what his mother had said.
“I know,” the blond shrugged, stepping towards the brunet, trying not to smile. “I just thought about how sad your arse would be to spend a Friday without me now. I bet you’re used to it.”
The boy almost fell over from the sudden noise, dropping everything that was in his hands, turning to face Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry put a hand to his hair as he felt his dyed streak itch. Turning to the oven, he saw his reflection, noticing that it was white again. Draco quickly took several steps back, fear creeping into his eyes.
“I’m shaking,” Harry mocked, then looked up to see the crowd that had formed. Before the other could retaliate, Professor McGonagall had shown up, practically screaming for everyone to make their way to their classes.
“I’m not!” Draco protested. “Harry, please, just listen. Let me explain-”
“I just don’t understand
“I don’t care about my birthday,” Harry replied, standing up and collapsing into Draco’s arms, kissing him passionately. “I missed you so much,” he whispered against the blond’s soft lips, who seemed surprised.
Harry realized it was probably not a good idea to talk to Draco, but before he could walk away, the door opened and Draco stood there, staring at Harry.
p.s. not proofread so excuse me if I've made any mistakes - it's midnight as I post this
And he was. The door opened and he entered. His face was pale, and he looked exhausted, but he was smiling, and for the first time in a while, it didn’t look forced.
“My Draco’s here!” Harry teased with a grin as Draco walked up to him on Saturday morning.
“I heard Harry Potter is coming to Hogwarts, Mum,” Harry heard the girl say, “Is it true?”
“So… do you want to tell me?”
Everything seemed lonely. It was so strange - him and Draco have probably been broken up for more time than they’ve actually dated, but this seemed like something he couldn’t get over. It had been two years, but he couldn’t just throw this away, could he?
The two cuddled until Draco left before everyone was done with dinner. After Harry thanked Draco again (which Draco responded with a smack and told him not to thank him), they wished each other a good night.
“Good morning,” The two muttered, smiling sheepishly, sitting down on the couch beside Hermione. Luna and Pansy were seated on the floor and Ron was sitting on a beanbag.
“For the best,” he echoed, relaxing as Harry rested his head on his shoulder. Draco pulled him closer. He shut his eyes for a moment, feeling his Dark Mark sting, trying to erase it with the feeling of having Harry in his arms.
Harry looked over to Pansy, who met his gaze, shrugging in confusion, then nodding her head in the direction that Draco had gone. He nodded slightly, then turned and looked down at Hermione.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s hair fell into his eyes as he gave Harry a long look. “...Merlin, you just reversed everything I had tried to do to hate you in the past few months. Harry, me being a Death Eater is something that
“I’ve got back-up. The Death Eaters are in your school tonight,” Draco was saying. Harry wanted to do something. He wanted to stop listening to what was happening, he wanted to leave. He didn’t want to listen to this.
“-only worried. I know. Thank you. Should we head to the room of requirement now?”
“Was to see if this was worth the risk,” he spoke gently. “And I made my decision.”
Harry quickly put on his clothes, pocketing the letter, and slipping out of the person’s apartment - whom he guessed was Peter? Or Phil. He couldn’t remember, nor was he in a desperate attempt to try.
Hermione nudged his shoulder. Harry finally snapped out of his thoughts and looked up at her. “Just… be careful the next few days.”
“I will in a moment. I just need to tell you something first,” Draco said, grabbing a nearby chair and sitting by the door, keeping his eyes on Harry, who was more than five feet away.
“Yes. Is that an issue?”
“Are you ever in the mood to get swarmed by people with questions about our relationship?”
“You’ve been so weird all weekend,” Ron said as the three sat down during Charms class. It was a revision lesson today, which meant they could study and chat all they liked. After all, it was their last week before the holidays. “Did something happen?”
“Potter,” Draco repeated agitatedly, catching up with him. He tugged at his robe. Startled, Harry turned around, then cursed under his breath. “Look at this,” he signed.
“Oh, please, they bicker all the time,” Pansy rolled her eyes, fixing her hair. “Seriously. I don’t know how you’ve dealt with it all these years, Harry.”
?” she emphasized, snatching the newspaper out of his hands, then chuckled. “There’s your boyfriend, front and center.”
And Harry? Well, Harry’s plan seemed a little more within reach.
“Where were you last night?” Hermione raised an eyebrow as he sat down beside her.
“No, I don’t,” Draco shook his head, curling his lip in disgust, “because I’m considerate of your situation. But why should I care about this so much if you clearly can’t trust me?”
“When are you not worried about me anymore,” he rolled his eyes, then gulped. “Sorry. That was a bit out of line. I was in the room of requirement studying and fell asleep there. I came back a bit late.”
“You’re smiling,” Pansy sang. “You really like him, don’t you?”
“Harry, I want to talk to you,” Ginny told him.
“Look, it’s one thing they can actually agree on!” Pansy teased, receiving a snowball in the face from Draco. “Oh, you did
“He’s not coming?” Hermione asked Ron as they left. Ron simply shook his head as he frowned.
, no. Come, sit with me. I want to talk to you. Your father just left for some work, so this is the best time,” she said, yet she still seemed on edge, looking at the door every few moments.
On Wednesday evening, Harry found himself making his way to the wing, rather uneasy. He hadn’t gotten a poem from Draco the past two days, which made him think that maybe Draco was really sick.
“I’m sorry. It was stupid to come here. And… now I fucked up my one shot at being successful in my father’s eyes-”
“But… I don’t even know if he’s gay, let alone if he likes the guy who threw his hearing aids into the lake.”
“I know you’re trying to prove me to be the idiot here,” Harry gestured to Draco’s hands, “but the only person who looks pathetic is the one trying to bully the deaf teenager. I don’t think you thought this one through.”
love,
“Ow Harry, you just shouted into my ear,” Draco said with an eye roll.
“Why, is Harry on the front cover again?” he asked, taking it from her hands, searching for Harry’s face. Narcissa eyed him, but didn’t say anything.
“Hey, guys,” Pansy said, hugging Hermione and Ron in turn. Astoria hugged them too, but it was a little awkward. When it was Draco’s turn, he stood awkwardly until Hermione hugged him tightly.
The two had spoken at the same time, so suddenly that they were taken aback. Blinking in surprise, they were interrupted by Hermione, Ron and Astoria entering the living room.
After a while of studying and Harry asleep on him, Draco slowly packed his things and carried Harry down to his dorm before slipping into his own.
But for Draco, his night wasn’t over yet. And it sure as hell wasn’t going to be a good one.
Draco didn’t need to say a word, he didn’t need to explain. Harry didn’t need to say words of comfort, he didn’t need to ask. All they needed in that moment, was one thing.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Do you want to go somewhere more private?”
Draco wrote, and wrote, and wrote until he was almost asleep at his desk. He would write the most random thoughts that would pop up in his head. But he would also write the thoughts that had been lurking in the back of his mind for months.
Draco now stared at his own reflection for a few more seconds before slowly turning away. He had to see Harry, he had to.
“Uh…” Draco turned to face Harry, unsure of what to say. Neither of them ever really discussed how they were going to say it.
Harry groaned, looking over at the piece of paper Draco was writing in. “Another poem?” He stood up quickly and walked so he could read it over his shoulder, knowing rather well he could’ve just picked it up.
“Is it because of me?” Draco asked quietly, unsure if he even wanted an answer.
The class started off pretty normally. The class was set to work, but this time Harry and Draco were too focused on their work to hold hands under the table.
“Well… time, yes, but not enough ingredients,” Ginny cried.
Two weeks passed. Every day felt like a constant argument with himself, trying to come up with reasonable explanations for why Draco had broken up with him, only to end up blaming himself.
“No, it’s fine, really. At least my own damn parents wouldn’t be abusive towards me,” Harry muttered before he could stop himself, turning away and exiting the library as quickly as he could.
“I wouldn’t say that. It’s probably the only thing that could help you in your O.W.Ls.”
Bravery was stupid. It cost him his boyfriend. Cost him a shit ton of things.
The silver-eyed boy found himself unable to stop smiling. “We could try right now. It’s just you and me here.”
“What? No, no. It’s fine.” Draco told Harry. “It just washes out anyways…” He muttered to himself.
The class started and Harry watched Draco enter, ignoring his presence. It had been a few days, but Draco did not attempt to start any conversations with Harry during detention, nor did they acknowledge each other in the hallways.
“Oh, this? It’s just a promise ring…” Harry awkwardly scratched the back of his neck. “No, Draco and I are just dating for now…” Molly nodded to show she understood, still smiling. Harry paused for a few seconds, before biting his lip. “S-so, you’re okay with me being gay?”
“Okay, good. I can’t… I can’t handle another person hiding things from me and lying to me. I need to know you’re on my side. Telling me what he’s asking you to do… will make me sure that you’re truly on my side. Not that I think you’re not on my side.”
“How long?”
Harry took his shirt off slowly. “Show me.”
What sucked the most was that he thought Harry wouldn’t be one of those people.
“We held hands in class on Monday,” Harry said with an eye roll.
“How do you expect him to understand you if-”
“Harry, what are you doing?” Hermione shook him, breathless. “They must’ve gone the wrong way!”
“What? What’s wrong? Are you getting hurt again? I’m so sorry,” Draco asked, panicked, scrambling to move away, only to stop when he saw the other shaking, then bursting into laughter.
“I don’t know about that,” Ron shrugged, “but I agree with you.”
Ron simply shrugged. “I dunno. It’ll probably just wash out. Come on, I’m hungry, let’s get to breakfast.”
“But-”
Harry shook his head. “Nothing makes sense anymore. I had… I had a plan,” he whispered. “It was a sloppy plan, but… it made sense to me. I was happy just knowing that the plan would work out, but… now I know it won’t.”
“Anyway… who’s your girlfriend?” When he didn’t reply, she raised an eyebrow, dropping her voice to a whisper. “...boyfriend?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s true… I’m just an idiot in your eyes, aren’t I?” Harry asked.
“Only when
“Should’ve thought of that before you decided to get on my nerves,” he fumed, backing away from the lake, then throwing the hearing aids the furthest he could. Harry watched in awe as it sank into the water, frozen for a moment. Then he turned to Draco, a stone-cold expression on his face. He practically ripped off the robes that seemed to hold him back, grabbing Draco by the collar and pushing him against the nearby tree.
“What, that I used a spell made especially for enemies at my boyfriend?”
Draco did.
“Like you’re ready to go shopping,” she smiled sweetly, walking over to fix his collar. He nodded, putting a hand to the faded brown streak in his hair. It seemed he didn’t need to dye it anymore. It was slowly turning white on its own.
okay that poem in this chapter, I genuinely really like it. I'm a horrible poet but I really like this one even if it's not perfect. I also think it fits Draco a lot.
“Happy anniversary. I love you too,” Draco said quietly, then took out a small piece of paper, handing it to Harry. “Don’t forget that, okay?”
He had tied them together in a red ribbon and wrote ‘Harry Potter’ in the front.
“Harry.”  Harry could sense the tone of Draco’s voice. It was serious, it was cold, it was a tone that implied that he was shutting himself off and that he wasn’t going to talk to Harry.
Draco stood up, knocking the glasses on their table over, grabbing Blaise by the collar and pulling him up. The chatter in the pub had quietened down, and all eyes were on the two. Harry, clueless, followed everyone else’s gaze after noticing they were gaping at something.
“You underestimate me, Harry,” Draco smiled as he put his hands on Harry’s face, using his thumb to wipe away his tears. “Listen. I know I can’t make any of it go away. Let’s take it one step at a time, alright? Right now, I’m here. And you have all of me.”
“Draco, please. Please just open the door. I know you’re in there, Draco,” Harry had said on the fifth day.
“Draco, wait a bit. Don’t you sit right next to each other in Defense Against the Dark Arts? Slip him a note then.”
********
“You know,” She made the sound again, looking at him as if he was the weird one for not understanding what she meant. “You’re so whipped for him.”
“Maybe,” Draco said slyly with a wink.
“You have a letter,” Draco spoke softly. “And… I need to go soon.”
“Harry, go and wake Severus,” Dumbledore ordered faintly. “Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do not remove your Cloak.”
He felt his eyes sting with tears. “She’s deaf,” his voice was quiet. He was grateful that they were the only ones in this carriage. “She fell really sick last year, and now she’s deaf. It was something to do with her eardrums.”
Hermione and Ron were still trying to wrap their heads around the fact that he was actually seeing Draco, however, did not bring it up to him. They couldn’t deny the fact that Draco had certainly made him significantly happier the past few months. Other than that, Harry seemed to sulk every time his name was mentioned.
“What-”
Because it’s 1, a boy, 2, freaking Draco Lucius Malfoy.
“You’re not losing me,” Draco said softly. “I’m always here,” he reached forward and touched Harry’s chest gently. “And I’m always up here too,” he pressed his index finger gently against Harry’s temple.
Ron and Hermione, who’s eyebrows were raised when they had watched Harry struggling to find his stuff, nodded.
“Voldemort’s probably up to something.” Harry mused as he pulled up Draco’s arm to his lips, kissing it gently.
Narcissa smiled, but it wasn’t the smile he wanted. It was a sad smile, that reached her eyes, as if to let him know that she was too afraid to give him an answer. “Pansy said he might…” he muttered.
They sat in silence for a moment.
“Sign here,” Draco pointed to the piece of paper. Lucius stared at him for a long moment. “A true Malfoy never goes back on their word, don’t they?”
“You wouldn’t let me do that; you’d force me to study until it’s drilled into my brain,” Harry replied in a soft tone, his eyes still shut, a smile twitching at his lips when he felt Draco stroking his hair.
Harry looked at the map, scanning through every place he could possibly be. But his name was nowhere to be found. Harry saw Pansy’s name, Crabbe and Goyle’s name, and even Blaise’s. If Draco was studying, why wasn’t he at the library or in his dorm or Common Room? Or even with one of his friends?
Harry tried not to smile, unsure if Draco was aware that he had been running his hand up and down his arm reassuringly. He looked around the room. The walls that were initially grey were now white; the small bookshelf was now big enough to be called a library, the couch had a blanket, and there was a window by the table.
“Pfft…” Draco scoffed softly. “Don’t bother.” Draco received a slap from Harry.
Harry and Draco, from what they decided a while back, don’t really do big gifts. They do… poems and small things that remind them of one another, like the charm bracelet Harry got last year.
Harry just wanted to feel Draco against him again - the smoothness of his skin, his tingly, sensual touch, his deep voice. He wished he hadn’t fallen asleep, because then he could’ve asked Draco to stay. And Draco Malfoy on Harry Potter’s side, as astonishing as it would be to the public, was all he really wanted.
“He told me he dropped it… he seemed pretty firm about it too. He probably
“What is this, an interrogation?” Harry replied with an eye roll. “I sat down because I got hurt by the fall.” He lied.
“Yeah, that’s strange,” Ron said with a raised eyebrow. “Maybe you’re getting grey hair.”
P.S. (update?) I've lost inspiration to write this story so it's going to end here. thanks for the support <3
“So, how’s the Eighth Year, kids? Handling it well?” she asked, flashing a smile towards Draco and Harry. The two smiled, grateful that she had changed the subject.
“I need to go too. Like… right now. Dumbledore’s waiting for me,” he turned to leave, then turned right back around, taking Draco’s hands, looking up at him. “Happy anniversary. I love you.”
hey loves!! hope you enjoyed this chapter!!
Hello! I just wanted to say that this story can also be found on Wattpad. Not sure if I'll keep it up there or not, just wanted to try it out.
Breakfast was boring and lonely as usual. Everyone was having a conversation and Harry had decided long ago he was ‘too deaf’ to engage in them. He left before anyone else was even done with his breakfast.
face him, you always have your friends to help you. You know, Granger and the Weasleys, and Dumbledore too… For me, it isn’t like that.”
Then, Harry jumped forwards and pushed Draco down on the bed, hitting their lips together. The two quickly pulled apart, groaning in pain.
“About one p.m.?”
Every time Draco and Harry locked eyes, the streaks in their hair would glisten. Neither of them ever noticed, and neither did they care about it. The two were just glad to be able to be together again.
“Oh, honey,” she smiled, and in a bizarre plot twist, wrapped her arms around him tightly. “Of course not. I’ve always had a feeling, you know.”
With that, he left.
“Is this goodbye?” Draco asked, stepping closer towards him for the first time.
“That’s not all, watch,” he put out his wrist with his own watch and tapped it. “Look. We can communicate like this. The watch vibrates for each other as soon as we tap it. It can happen from any distance, it’s created magically. Obviously.”
“Astoria, do you have a moment?” He asked suddenly, placing his plate on the table in front of him. She nodded, signalling to Pansy silently to go ahead without her. “Listen, um… I just wanted to talk about… the possibility of our… marriage.”
Draco flung an envelope over to Harry, who caught it at the last second.
“The thing is, Harry, you don’t even hang out with us much anymore. The past few weeks you would ditch us to see what Malfoy’s up to, and now you just seem distant.” Hermione admitted. Harry blinked and turned to face Ron, who was nodding along to what Hermione was saying.
Draco nodded, sitting down on the bed. “Only he can take back the curse. My hands were tied. The only option was to break up with Harry. I know if I told him about it, he’d throw me in his arms anyway. I couldn’t hurt him that way.”
“What?”
“Harry, calm down,” he said, putting his hands on Harry’s shoulders, looking at him reassuringly, but he was still trying to get out of bed. Draco quickly stopped him.  “Hey, calm down, you’re safe.”
“I’m in love with you, Harry. Madly. Deeply. Unwaveringly.”
“I guess I’m deaf for you, then?” Harry replied cheekily.
“I can’t breathe,” Draco told Harry dramatically. Harry rolled his eyes and slowly sat up, letting go of Draco, who gave Harry a very offended look.
*******
“A lovely idiot,” he whispered. “...
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Is there more alcohol?” he asked, biting his lip. He looked over Hermione’s shoulder to see Draco sitting on the couch by himself.
What hurt Draco the most is that his father didn’t say no.
risk to take. And even when I took it, you couldn’t trust me.”
He rubbed his eyes, turning to look at her. “I just saw Harry.”
A week passed. Draco ignored Harry’s presence, didn’t send any more poems, and nor did he show up on Friday. Harry, too humiliated, had only waited for fifteen minutes this time. Did Draco really just play with his feelings? But the poems he had sent in the holidays sounded so genuine…
“How was your date, lovebird?” Pansy asked as she entered the dorm. “You avoided me all evening yesterday!”
“I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner,” Draco started, his voice cracking. “I’m sorry I just left you like that. I’m sorry that we fought.”
“You do, and it’s not a bad thing,” Pansy said, sensing his scared tone. “You have someone. He’ll be yours. He’ll accept you.”
“How do you know?”
“Don’t do that,” Draco told him, instantly noticing his fists and placing his hands over Harry’s, unclenching his fists. “It was fine… stop looking at me like that. So it wasn’t fine. So what? It’s never fine.”
Draco seemed a little surprised. “Really? You? Brave Harry Potter?”
I really want to thank you guys so, so much for your support. Looking at your comments really got me motivated and made me feel much better about continuing this story - I genuinely thought that no one liked this story. So, really, thank you. My writing is not great at all but it is really important to me (always has been), so seeing your support really helps me.
“You’re still a bit disoriented. Just gather yourself for a moment,” he said gently, concern written all over his face. He sat on the bed just beside Harry, stroking his hair softly as they sat in silence. Draco looked down at Harry’s trembling hands, but didn’t say anything,
“It can’t hurt to try. I know there’s no sort of cure or hearing aids in the Wizarding World, so…” She looked at him, practically urging him to try it on.
Harry spent most of his Saturday hanging out with Hermione and Ron. Though, he did feel a bit left out because Ron and Hermione were just talking amongst themselves for most of the time. Well, mostly bickering. And Harry knew better than to interrupt it.
“Don’t worry about it,” she said, going over and pulling him into a hug. “You take care of yourself, alright? And stop by next week, if you can.”
“Harry, you do realize that… this is practically abuse, right?”
“Oh, Christ, no. He was horrified, to say the least,” Harry shook his head. “No, no… I think he mentioned he was supposed to give that drink to Dumbledore.”
“I saw it,” he said quietly. “You don’t need to hide it from me.”
” He shot, grabbing Lucius’ wand and clutching it tightly.
The brown in Draco’s hair shined and glistened as Harry broke out of the bind, pushing the Cloak off of him.
, Christmas is in a month. That means I need to go home for the holidays but I’ve barely learnt any sign language-”
“No partner, Mr. Potter?” He asked, glancing over to Ron and Hermione who were awkwardly moving to get the ingredients they needed.
“Hmm?” Harry hummed. He was busy thinking about how to ask Draco to hang out later today.
Later on in the day, Ron accidentally ate chocolates that were meant for Harry and they had to go to Slughorn. And then, Ron got poisoned.
He put up his middle finger, to which Harry laughed. “Seeing as you’re not lying about being deaf, I don’t think you’re lying about… You-Know-Who either. So don’t you think you should be learning your spells?”
“How did it feel?” Harry asked slowly. “Her disgusting, dry lips on yours. Her arms around your neck. Your beautiful, soft lips, on hers. Pulling her closer to you.”
Harry turned to face Hermione and Ron who were caught up in their own conversation, bickering about their schedules, before turning back to Luna. “Sure.” He said and stood up, leaving the hall with Luna.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Can you stop being so grumpy? Your boyfriend will be here soon.”
“Seems like everything else,” she nudged his shoulder, then sighed when he looked down, playing with his fingers. “I think you should spend more time with him to understand how you really feel."
Taking a sip from his drink, Harry, shut his eyes for a moment, feeling the scar on his forehead burn. Gulping, he opened his eyes, wincing. It hadn’t hurt in two years. Was being around Draco what sparked it for him? Swaying a little, he shook his head, trying to snap out of it.
“You love me, really,” Pansy said as she stuck her tongue out at Draco, who simply scoffed. “Oh please, if it weren’t for me, you and Harry probably wouldn’t have even gotten together!”
Harry burst out laughing, but quickly jumped up and moved away when Draco got out his wand. After being chased around for a few moments, they both turned as the door burst open.
Harry found himself exiting the castle and going near the lake, where the entrance of the Forbidden Forest was. He entered and walked into the forest. He remembered the last time he had walked through here, he was with Draco.
“Is there another Harry we know?” he snapped. “Yes, Harry Potter.”
“Well, don’t get any- Harry!” Draco snapped, startled when Harry nudged his shoulder then quickly ran back, smirking to himself as if he was a child.
“Yet you want a second date,” Harry said as he put more chips into his mouth. “Don’t you?”
“Not comparing, just saying how’s it’s the cherry on top of the cake.”
“...Alright, you do have a point.”
“I just… never expected to like her, I guess.” Harry said with a small shrug. “But enough of that. Will you help me out?”
“What do you mean? Of course, I’m coming!” Hermione protested from the other side of the room, walking towards Ron and grinning at him. “I’ll go if you go.” She leaned forwards and before Draco and Harry knew it, they were making out beside them.
“Harry!” Pansy squealed, walking towards him and pulling him into a hug. “I haven’t seen you in forever, love!” Harry hugged her back, laughing awkwardly, looking up to see Draco’s eyes directly on him. He quickly looked away, pulling away from the hug.
“Harry, I thought it was obvious. I mean, you can literally feel his presence when he enters the building. And your hair - isn’t that a dead giveaway?” she folded her arms.
Harry turned to see where what used to be a blank wall, there was a door. Draco was really in the Room of Requirement. Harry took in a deep breath before slowly entering.
“Why didn’t you come to me sooner?” Harry asked as he kissed his cheek. “As if I’d let you break up with me over this. I guess we’ll have to be more careful. How did Snape even find out?”
“UH, I don’t think so.” A voice firmly said behind Harry. Harry turned around, shirtless, and confused. Draco held a box in his hand. Not a plain old cardboard box. A bright, red box, with a big gold bow on top of it.
“What the hell, Draco? Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Even if it’s verbal, it’s still abuse.”
He pulled off his Invisibility Cloak and left to fight the Death Eaters.
Draco looked over to the Gryffindor again, who was looking at him now, almost curiously. He raised his eyebrows slightly, as if to ask him if everything was alright. He nodded in response, and Harry gave him a small smile. Draco smiled back before the two both turned back to their work.
He turned to leave, opening the door. Suddenly, he turned around, heart beating so fast he thought he might faint. “Would you like to get coffee sometime? Preferably five to six feet apart.”
“Just make it completely brown!”
Draco’s hand was slightly trembling, and he gulped down what felt like a storm of emotions, picking up his textbook, blinking back tears. He had answered so softly that Harry almost didn’t even hear him.
“Harry, in a relationship like yours, shit can get pretty complicated. I’m not trying to make excuses for him or anything like that. I’m just trying to understand how to fix this. Are you close to making a decision?” she asked, sipping her hot cocoa.
“By looking into my mind?” Draco answered, confused. “Why’s that important now?”
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Draco shoved him, but he was stifling a laugh. “Right, so, the deal. What do you think?”
“I see you forgot this,” She said with a grin.
He rubbed his temples. “I’m worried for his safety. More importantly… I’m worried that this… might be something we can’t overcome,” it was the first time he had said that out loud. “You know. War. It’s… a big thing.”
“Draco, if you find Harry Potter for the Dark Lord, he will be pleased. He will be very happy with us.”
Draco let out a squeal, unprepared as the two fell off the bed, rolling on the ground. But Harry didn’t let go. He tightly hugged Draco until he was forced to hug Harry back.
“That’s me,” Harry said with a shrug, adjusting his glasses as he slowed down his writing, looking over at Draco. “You never want to just make out. Are you tired? Did something happen? Did someone insult you? Did someone-”
“Do you often wonder about that brown strip in your hair?” Snape asked. Draco slowly turned to his mirror, his hand going to the brown streak in his hair.
“I can’t, really. I got some work to do right after. I’m terribly sorry, love, but results are on Monday, I need to finish up essays for extra credit.”
“You must end it, Draco. If The Dark Lord finds out, you will be in big trouble, and so will your family, and so will I. And so will Harry.”
“Well, I’ve got to say, yes it
“I heard that.”
Pushing him gently back on the couch, Draco kissed him on the lips finally, his hands wandering down, slipping into Harry’s trousers, who let out a soft, low moan. “I have to go after this.”
Signing the poem off with his initials, he shut the journal, setting the quill down. He kept his eyes on the fire. He was growing tired of the situation, yet thoughts of it consumed most of his time. Standing up, he shook his head. Harry was probably not even thinking of him. He was stupid to even let it bother him this much. Of course he would be untrustworthy. He was a Malfoy, and that’s all people would see him for.
His voice was deeper than Harry had last heard it. Well, the last time was probably in fourth year and Draco was insulting him like always. He had never heard Draco’s voice sound so soft.
“I just… Before our first official date, should I rethink this?”
“Draco and I aren’t together anymore,” Harry said slowly. It hurt him to say it, but he had to say it out loud sooner or later.
By the next day, everyone had assumed that Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter had a duel, and Harry had won. This caused even more whispering every time Harry entered a room.
“Hey, Potter,” Draco snorted, holding up the WSL book. “I found a nice sign.” he set the book down and clumsily signed the word for ‘dork’. “I’ll be using this a lot for you.”
“Oh, shut up, Draco.”
“Well, yes, but why would I say anything? I hate to break it to you, but I didn’t do this. Although I’m sure you’ve been actively waiting for me so fuck something up between us,” Draco snapped, glaring at Harry.
“Yeah, she is,” Harry said with a grin, speeding up his pace and running into class.
“Splendid,” Harry said, sitting up, annoyed that he was disturbed. “What the fuck does it take to get some alone time around here?”
“I know.” He kissed the top of Harry’s head. “But it doesn’t change anything between us, right?”
“You know it’s me,” said Harry in astonishment.
Pansy and Draco exchanged glances. “Probably,” she replied, using her eyes to tell Draco to stay silent. “Anyway-”
But as Draco said it, he couldn’t help but feel utter shame and guilt.
Harry smiled slightly as he looked up at Draco, “You won’t leave me here while I’m asleep?”
“Sorry! I just thought you need to know!” She protested, before shutting the door and leaving.
“Oh yes, it’s me who has to grow up,” Harry replied with an eye roll. He grabbed the waffle back and starting eating, turning to Hermione, Ron, and Luna who seemed to be arguing.
After a few moments, the two pulled apart, breathless but grinning.
“I’ll see you on the other side?”
“No, no… nothing like that…” Harry muttered, chuckling slightly, unable to take his eyes off of Draco - no, Harry didn’t
“Does it look like it?” He replied, swiftly losing the energy to argue back.
“You like my attention then,” Harry said with a refreshing sigh, smirking. “Nice to know.”
It's late for me as I upload this so I'm sorry if there are tons of mistakes, this is not proofread lmao
As soon as she left, Harry turned to Draco. “I
“Oh, as if you’re not a huge Gryffindork. ‘Oh, I’m going to jump on a broom that I don’t know how to ride to help out my friend!’”
“Why’d you go anyway?” He asked, leaning back on the couch, starting to feel more at ease.
She nodded, sitting down beside him. “I’ve already prepared for it. I don’t have… anyone in mind right now, so I think if Harry doesn’t show up… the best option is just to go through with it. After all, we can’t let our parents down.”
bumped into
“So, what were you guys up to?” Pansy asked with a wink, breaking the silence. Hermione and Ron facepalmed.
“Harry, can we talk?”
(See the end of the chapter for
When they pulled away for the last time, Harry looked up at him nervously, breathing heavily. He put a hand to his own lips, not taking his eyes off Draco, too overwhelmed to say anything. The two flopped down on the couch, still buzzing from the kiss.
Groaning, Draco sat up in his bed, reaching out for something - or perhaps it was someone. He stared at the empty space beside him, unsure of what he had done wrong to end up in this position. He remembered the lonely nights during the war, longing for Harry, but deep inside knowing that they would be together again. That feeling wasn’t there this time, and he realized that’s what made him so afraid.
“Working on it,” Draco finished for Harry. “Don’t tell anyone Pansy, or I swear to Merlin I’ll murder your ass.”
Harry, who was not really doing anything in particular, choked on his saliva, coughing like a maniac, before looking up at Draco. “Excuse me, what?” Harry asked, “A dinner with the Malfoys! Outrageous. It’s almost as if you want your family to hate me.”
“Don’t want Madam Pomfrey to ask questions,” Harry stated. “Thanks, though you do realize if you would have just accepted my great joke, this wouldn’t have happened, right?”
The poems to him, however, had stopped. It was an insufferable, Friday morning, but the hope that they would be meeting in the evening to study gave him a shred of excitement, and it was enough to work with amidst the chatter of his friends that he couldn’t possibly join. They were all talking way too fast, and it felt like they were having three conversations at once.
Draco looked down at his shoes, biting his lip. Pansy gasped excitedly.
incredibly stupid.”
“I hate this, I hate this, I hate this!” Harry groaned as he dramatically fell back on his seat, rubbing his temples.
“I’m there,” Draco said. “It’ll just take some getting used to. I don’t care if you’re a pureblood or not. They shouldn’t either. You’ll be fine.” Well, the truth was, Draco didn’t know if he would be fine. Sure, things with the Weasleys had gone quite smoothly, but the Malfoys… well, needless to say, they were a whole different story.
you go on these dates every Friday, Draco? Is it to her dormitories? Do you guys-”
Monday through Friday, Harry only used his hearing aids when necessary and kept his distance from Draco. Well, it wasn’t as if they were too close in public anyway, but he avoided their usual banter that would take place here and there. But he could only escape it for so long, because it was Friday evening and he had to go to the Room of Requirement for his usual lesson time. He contemplated on even going, but then realized he was being extremely unfair towards Draco.
Draco couldn’t suppress a smile. “Food?”
Draco nodded, chewing on the inside of his cheek. “I know.”
“Oh, Draco, you’re here!” Molly grinned. “Oh, and you brought gifts! Ron, why don’t you direct him to the Christmas tree?”
“No. I’m just part of a family that kills,” he said quietly.
Harry sighed. “I... I didn’t say no,” he mumbled. “But... I can’t say yes either. I need some time to think about this.”
“There are so many factors and things that want to keep us apart,” Harry continued, taking a small step forward. “So many things that we can’t ignore. I’m the Boy Who Lived.”
“If everything goes to plan, three months. I’ll be there for a few years at the least. Not sure if Astoria will stay with me the whole time. I mean, it’s not like she’d miss me or something,” he chuckled, his smile fading when he noticed Harry was staring down, eyes widening when he realized he was crying. “What’s wrong?”
Harry let his eyes adjust, realizing that he had fallen asleep with his glasses still on. “I’m… sleeping?” he replied, raising an eyebrow. Seeing Ron’s annoyed expression, he sat up. “What’s up, Ron?”
“No, fuck this.” Harry stood up and opened up his trunk, practically throwing his clothes out.
“You know… I could feel the pain he was feeling… it was weird, but I could, I swear I could. Do you believe me?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded slightly. “I just… I feel so te-terrible…”
He gave him a quizzical look, exchanging glances with Hermione, who seemed confused too. “What do you want?”
“Yes,” Draco grumbled.
Draco’s hand - hesitantly and carefully - trailed down Harry’s face. He kissed Harry’s neck. “I’m everywhere,” he whispered. He kissed his arms, his fingers, his palms, his chest, down to his stomach. “I’m always with you.”
“Draco… did you learn sign language?” she asked while signing back.
“For what, Harry? This isn’t your fault,” Draco shook his head, reaching forward and using his fingers to delicately wipe his tears away, pulling him closer.
“Boyfriend!” Draco cried out in shock as they entered the Potions classroom. Almost everyone turned to look at Draco. “Pansy, you’ve got a boyfriend?” He asked loudly without missing a beat. Everyone turned away, thinking that they were just having a normal conversation now.
Draco was too busy grinning to pay attention to Pansy. “What?” He asked after a few moments, registering that Pansy had said something to him.
He blinked in surprise. Harry leaned into Draco’s touch as he wiped his tears away. “You do?”
She looked at him for a moment, then smirked. “Good idea, Mr. Malfoy.”
, but someone better than me, and I just hate how he let that bitch kiss him, I know I’m in no place to say anything but still.”
“It’s not finished,” Draco said, putting his hands over the paper, aware of how close Harry’s face was. He could practically feel his breath on his neck. To make matters worse, he only leaned in more so his chest was against his back, removing Draco’s hands.
“Oh,” Draco scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “It didn’t seem like I was clingy?”
“Okay, that was probably the lamest thing I’ve ever said,” Draco, panicked, picked up the WSL book. “Let’s just get on with the lesson? If you’re planning to actually teach me something this week, that is.”
“I love it,” Harry said, choking up, trying desperately to hold back tears. “It’s beautiful.” His hand trembling slightly, he picked up one of the rings, taking Draco’s left hand and putting it on his ring finger. “There,” He said in more of a whisper than a loud voice.
“Just ignore him,” Hermione mumbled, continuing to walk. Ron nodded. The two really weren’t in the mood to see Draco and Harry fight again. “Yesterday already caused somewhat of a crowd.”
“Okay, since you’re a little taller - which I hate, by the way - I guess you put your arm around my waist and I put mine on your shoulder,” Harry explained, doing so as he spoke. He put up his free hand and intertwined them with Draco’s.
“So… you accept that he’s actually deaf?” she raised an eyebrow, not bothering to ask why he needed to learn sign language to make fun of Harry. Draco gulped, staring at her for a few moments, unsure of what to say, before shaking his head aggressively.
“Fuck off,” he rolled his eyes, but he was smiling, letting Draco’s hand rest on his face for a moment before the two awkwardly turned back to their work, realizing what had just happened.
“Well, that’s quite a relief,” Draco sighed, but smiled, leaning forward and kissing him softly. He felt his heart flutter and his chest easen up. He had been too nervous about today. He didn’t know what he would’ve done if the hearing aids hadn’t worked for Harry.
Harry smiled slightly.
********
“What are you complaining about? I gave you my scarf, my gloves, my hat, would you like me to just give you all my clothes?”
That’s how it was, and that’s how they planned for it to be. Always.
Surprisingly for Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to know that they shouldn’t pry. They let him have his privacy, and let him keep to himself.
He stared into the brunet’s green eyes, unsure of how to tell him that the poem was about the two of them. “I guess so,” he said finally. “And… it’s only one of them that likes the time they spend together.”
“Uh…” Harry winced. “Yes.”
“I have no idea, actually. He knew before he even read my mind-”
“That was not the plan. The plan was to do something else, but it ended up backfiring.” Draco said, walking to Harry. “I don’t want to do any of this. You know that.”
“I had a feeling you’d need some music,” Pansy said with a shrug.
“I trust you,” Harry whispered - or tried to - he couldn’t tell. “I want to be with you without feeling guilty that I’m putting you at risk too.”
this isn't a chapter (sorry)
Harry turned to leave, barely able to speak. “That could’ve been you.”
“Hey, mate,” Ron said from behind Harry, hugging Harry for a long moment, before turning to Draco. The two awkwardly shook hands.
There was silence for a few seconds, as a shaking Harry lowered his hand. The professor that had been teaching the Dark Arts lesson walked in immediately and somehow managed to get the Boggart away and back into the classroom.
“You won’t leave me here while I’m asleep?” Draco asked softly, slowly shutting his eyes, already knowing the answer as he relaxed himself, getting comfortable.
“Um… there’s a club,” he lied quickly. “You know, since Potter is deaf. I suppose they’re trying to be more inclusive.”
The green-eyed boy left the closet with hair looking like he just got out of bed, followed by the silver-eyed boy whose tie was loosened and uniform was all crumpled up.
“I’m good,” Harry smiled, hugging her back. “Sorry I couldn’t make it last year.”
“Researching what? How to turn me on?” Draco asked between kisses.
“Yeah.”
“Who would you want to be your first kiss, then?” Hermione asked.
Two days before Christmas, the poems had come to an abrupt stop. There was no owl tapping on Harry’s window. He decided not to question it - holidays were busy times, and he had a big family. A family full of Death Eaters…
“Draco, it’s been years. It’d take time for that to be reversed. Besides, she was probably extra cranky because we woke her up.”
“I think he does. The night he was in the Hospital Wing, Harry and I fought, so I went back to apologize, and I heard him talking to someone. Now, I didn’t hear her voice, but I’m pretty sure she hid under the bed.” Hermione stated, turning to face Ron. “Who do you think could it be?”
“Right, makes sense.” he got out his wand as well. “It was the color-changing spell, right? Okay, stand up.”
“I wouldn’t go as far to say avoiding. I mean-”
As he sat down, the door suddenly opened, and Draco entered, sweating and breathless.
“Uh, no, you placed your hand on my thigh and started tickling me and I had to bite my tongue to stop myself from squirming.”
Hermione and Ron looked around the room and saw no one missing.
“Absolutely ridiculous,” He huffed as walked with Ron to breakfast.
Because that’d only wound his already aching heart more.
“Malfoy’s been weird recently,” Hermione spoke up, picking at her food. “He seems… bubblier or something. Less nasty, too. He barely even insults me anymore.”
Harry knew he should’ve said no to the proposal, and he should be saying no to coffee. But it seemed his heart taken over, because he nodded.
*******
“What? Draco’s a... Death Eater? But Harry said…” Hermione started but then sighed. “It all makes sense in a way now. The way they were acting... I saw Harry carry a huge jar filled with this weird sludge once. That was for the mark, wasn’t it?”
- malfoypolix
“I hope so,” his voice was muffled. When he pulled away, the three stared at each other before dissolving into soft laughter. “Sorry, Ron, I got your t-shirt all wet, let me give you one of mine…”
“Since when is money a problem for us?”
“I don’t think you should be rethinking anything, Draco.”
That’s why Draco was so glad when Pansy walked in and shooed out Harry before they were caught.
“Dumb? Idiotic? Stupid?”
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, but no one really annoys me - except for you, of course. It… gets quite boring for me. Everyone’s having a conversation and I… I need Hermione to translate what’s happening.”
Both rubbing their cheeks, Draco quickly walked back to his chair and Harry instantly felt better.
He looked into Draco’s eyes, then shook his head. “I’m sorry,” he said, wiping the tears off his face that he hadn’t even noticed were there. “I just… I forgot where I was for a second. I’m fine.” He moved to stand up, but Draco pushed him back gently.
“So what were you doing these past few weeks?” Hermione asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Why didn’t you wake me up earlier?” Harry asked. Draco turned, revealing a bruise on his cheek. “What happened?”
Throughout the rest of the week, Harry’s speech was minimalized. He barely spoke out loud, and during their next Charms class, he didn’t even attempt to take his wand out when they were trying to learn a new spell. Blaise sat back in triumph, while Draco beside him wanted to slap the smirk off of his face.
“Draco? Are you okay?” Harry spoke when he was sure the rest were out of earshot. Harry tried to speak in a gentle voice, pulling him carefully away from his chest so he could look at him. “Did something happen at lunch today with your father?”
“What?” Draco’s eyes widened. “Harry… you’re grieving. You don’t mean that.”
“Malfoy,” Snape repeated agitatedly. “Go.”
hope you enjoyed!! stay safe! enjoy your day! take it easy. you are loved <3
“I also have a darker shade of green if this is too bright for you. The red one… well, red is my favorite color so I couldn’t give you my favorite red one, so you’ll have to settle with maroon. But Harry, if you ever want another set, just tell me. I’ll give you one.”
“I understand, and I feel the same way, but… don’t speak so loud,” he answered quickly, speaking in a low tone. “You don’t know who could be listening. These Death Eaters would do anything to get on the good side of the Dark Lord.”
“Draco,” she said softly, eyebrows furrowed. “How did you even learn sign language?”
“Except me?” Harry asked, smiling.
Harry was going to protest, he was going to open his mouth to say something. But something told him that he should let Draco talk.
Draco looked over to the window. “
“I can’t,” he shook his head. “The bullshit she says makes me want to cave my own head in.”
“You know, you can ask me to come to stay at Grimmauld Place with you, right?” Harry said with an eye roll, but squeezed Draco’s hand gently under the blanket, sneaking a smile at him, before turning to Ron. “What about you guys?”
“Don’t imitate me, then.”
“Really,” Draco nodded, then frowned. “Unless… you decided this isn’t worth the risk. I completely understand. I mean, it’s your life at stake-”
“What’s got your wand in a knot?” Hermione asked as Harry sat down.
Two days had passed.
“That’s okay,” Hermione said, watching as Ron put his arms around Harry tightly. “You weren’t obligated to say yes to him. If you don’t think it’s a good idea for you two to be together, that’s perfectly acceptable.”
Harry laughed. “Do I still have feelings for him… what a joke, of course I don’t-”
“Of course,” Harry said reassuringly. He started drawing circles on the back of Draco’s hand with his index finger. By now he was right beside Draco, almost on top of him.
And, while it wasn’t much, it was still something. It was all they had. Their word - their promise.
“Draco?” Harry questioned when he noticed the silver-eyed boy standing outside of the kitchen, who grabbed the other’s hand and dragged him into his room. “Wait, you heard what happened?”
Dumbledore and Harry got on Rosmerta’s brooms and they went up to Hogwarts.
“I understand, but… why do you want to be with me again? I… I’m not the same person I was from two years ago.”
“It’s all good,” he replied. “Really.”
“Rambling?” Harry raised an eyebrow, his eyes sliding over to Draco, who seemed to be laughing while talking to his friends.
“What? No?” Harry shook his head, thinking back to their previous class, which was potions. He had been staring at Draco most of the time. Now that he thought about it, Cho was actually in his line of vision. “Ohh, I wasn’t staring at
“Look, Potter won’t even attempt the spell today,” Blaise nudged Draco, who looked at him in disgust.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Draco winced. “I always forget. I’m sorry.”
” Draco shouted, feeling utter embarrassment, burying his face into his hands.
“Well, yes,” she nodded. “But I’ve seen the way you look at each other. Something like that… it’d take a lot to break, don’t you think?”
They slowly made their way inside the Slytherin Common Room and to Draco’s dorm.
“Shut up, Ron,” he rolled his eyes, trying to hide his smile. He looked ahead to see Draco seated. The two made eye contact, and for a brief moment, Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He gulped, then looked away quickly, smiling again as he walked past the blond, who was also trying not to smile.
“You lied and kept secrets about me,” Harry said without thinking. “Wait, was that supposed to be a pickup line?”
“N-no. Fuck, no. No, I didn’t… no…” Harry sank to his knees, right beside where Draco was shaking in a pool of his own blood. “No! I didn’t… Fuck!”
His dorm mates just assumed he had turned in early that night.
Draco went on and on. Pansy rolled her eyes.
After a lot of chatter (that Draco wasn’t paying attention to), Bellatrix finally spoke up.
“I suggest you stop,” the blond threatened in a low voice, aware of all the people staring. Gritting his teeth, the pure disgust was evident on his face. “You don’t know what you’re saying.”
“Not quite,” Harry replied, running a hand through his hair. “Here’s the thing, Gin-”
Harry let go of Draco’s hand as if it were fire, looking away from Draco. The stinging pain in his chest hit him; because no matter how much Harry denied it, it was true. He will never understand. And Harry will always have missed out on having a real family; a real childhood.
“You aren’t, you really aren’t,” Harry spoke. He felt it was now his turn. “How do you think I felt? Finding out you aren’t on my side, that you’ve been doing things behind my back. That maybe it was all a lie, that maybe you were just acting from the beginning.
“Oh, um, I’m fine.” But his voice was cracked and all he wanted to do was die. He was a horrible person. A disgusting, revolting person. That’s what he thought of himself, at least.
“Um… what would a feeling be described as when… you really care about someone’s well being?”
“Draco and Astoria might be moving,” she called from the living room, jumping when she heard a crash. Slowly, she entered the kitchen, raising an eyebrow as she saw a broken plate on the floor. “Harry!”
What was frustrating wasn’t Blaise’s stupid remarks, it was that he was right. How was Harry going to defend himself through everything? He still had three years of education left. He was nowhere near ready to fight Voldemort.
“You will not believe the night I’ve had, Draco, so please,” he flopped down on the couch, shutting his eyes. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I know you had a good lesson planned for us today.”
“I’m so fucking sorry,” Harry was mumbling into Draco’s neck, “I really am. I don’t know what I was thinking. I shouldn’t have said that stupid shit. I didn’t mean it, okay? I didn’t.”
“The poor boy… what a horrible thing to go through. His whole life has been messed up. I can’t help but imagine what it would be like if it happened to you, and that’s what makes me so-”
Draco turned around when he saw someone behind him in the mirror. His face was pale, his lips were dry, his face was streaked with tears and his eyes looked lost. As a natural instinct, he immediately got out his wand and pointed it at Harry.
Harry smiled slightly, “Thanks,” he said, sighing in relief. “I guess I never really, uh… thought about telling anyone. It was more just about being with Draco rather than telling anyone about it.”
“It’s been six days.”
“Why do you always Apparate here first?” He rolled his eyes, but knew it was because half of the time he would never even show up to the parties or gatherings their friends were having. Now Hermione and Ron would make sure to stop by his place to see if he was going to come or not. It was sweet of them to do so, but he would never tell them that.
“Only kidding! Welcome to the family, boy.”
Draco let out a soft chuckle, and the two dissolved into silence for a moment as they continued walking. “You seem… different.”
“Is it okay if I see you again?” Harry asked before Draco could. “If Astoria’s okay with-”
“I honestly think we should just forget he exists,” Harry nodded.
“Of course he is. I can’t stay. He’ll die before I do. It’s like asking to be found. I couldn’t possibly put him in that sort of danger, now could I?” he paused, then frowned when she didn’t answer. “Pansy?”
“What… are you doing, Draco?” Pansy asked as she reached him, watching him pace back and forth near the entrance of the Great Hall. “I’ve been watching you pace from all the way over there,” she pointed behind her, which was a long hallway.
Draco put a hand to his head. “I’m sorry. I’m being stupid. I shouldn’t have said all that. Just forget it."
“Harry!” Draco scolded.
Draco was seated in between Pansy and Blaise, staring at the food on his plate but not eating. Harry noticed that the food on his plate was untouched.
Draco said nothing.
are you doing here? Harry, are you nuts?”
“Fuck you, Draco,” Harry was saying, “Fuck you. Get out of the fucking room, please just open the door, so we can talk. Please just let me see you. Please just let me apologize. You don’t have to forgive me. This is getting tiring. Everyone’s so worried, you know that? Not just me. If not for me, please just come outside for everyone else.”
Massaging his temples, he decided it would be easier to just go to Luna’s party and figure out what to do about him later. After all, he still had a month. He stared at the invitation to his and Draco’s ‘wedding’, smiling almost bitterly. Imagine if that was real - imagine if Draco’s father wasn’t a complete dickhead. They could actually have had this type of wedding. They could probably hyphenate the names, though he wasn’t sure if Lucius would like that very much.
“What?”
He looked at her, somewhat confused. He didn’t know how much Draco had told her, so decided to play dumb just in case. “Malfoy… wants to see-”
Hermione just hugged him tightly, followed by Ron. After that night, Harry came clean to them. They already sort of knew judging by their behavior but comforted him nonetheless. It wasn’t easy avoiding Draco for the rest of their Eighth Year, but they tried their best. Draco and Astoria started dating just before their graduation and they got engaged last year.
Harry took the letter from the owl, petting him before returning to his meal, unfolding the paper with his free hand. Hermione and Ron’s interest in the letters had now been lost as they were always bickering with each other. Besides, they could tell Harry didn’t like it when they asked him about it.
Draco stared at him for a few seconds, “I don’t think you mean that.”
“Hey…” Luna said as she entered, eyebrows knitted. “I sense a lot of tense energy in this room. Do you know why Draco and Pansy are just standing outside in the hallway?”
“It helps me not cry,” he whispered, voice hoarse, but there were tears streaming down his face. “I was afraid of this, Draco. This happening to you, or to Hermione, or Ron. I thought it would be fine. That I could stop it from happening.”
“This is awful,” he nuzzled his head into Draco’s shoulder. And then, finally, he said, “things are going to change this summer.”
“Harry,” she gently placed her hand on his, making sure to enunciate, “You’ll get through this.”
“Harry, wait,” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. “Your-- your decision. Are you any closer to… making a decision?”
Draco Malfoy stood at the door of The Burrow, trying his best not to cry as he pulled on his sweater. “I-I get my own Weasley sweater?” He asked, holding back the tears. “H-Harry, see! I don’t have to wear yours anymore…”
“Draco, are you joining?” Pansy asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Told you!” Ron said with a grin. And for once, Hermione grinned right back.
She smiled nervously. “Like stated before, it isn’t really something that should be forced-”
“Hey, stay,” Harry pleaded as he tried to get up, pulling him down so they were sitting beside each other, refusing to let go of his hand. “Stay for a second.”
“The letters,” Draco whispered in realization. Harry nodded. “You read them all?”
“No one believes me, do they?” he muttered, looking over to his friends. “I can’t believe I got detention from Umbridge because she thinks I’m not really deaf.”
“I’m free on Friday evenings,” he stated.
“Have you… got a song stuck in your head?” she asked.
“Y-yes, I was,” Draco answered slowly. He wasn't surprised by Harry's sudden entrance. It was as if Draco knew he was there the whole time.
“Is this you or Hermione speaking?” Harry raised an eyebrow, and Ron pursed his lips.
“I love you, Harry,” Draco blurted in response. Harry moved so he was leaning on Draco.
Hermione turned to look at the two who were desperately trying to hide their hickeys, quickly standing up and walking over to Ron, sitting down on his lap.
“...Don’t make me regret it,” He said. “I still don’t forgive you, by the way. But I’m not vile enough to not help you out for something like this.”
“But it’s funny, isn’t it?” Blaise pestered, realizing he seemed to be hitting a nerve. “The bloody git can’t even hear us talking about him one feet away. He’s a bit of an idiot-”
“Temporary happiness?” he echoed, stuffing his face with food.
Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Draco all stopped chewing, and Ron even choked on his food a little. All four of them mentally cringed.
“Are you kidding? What do you want me to call you?” Draco asked sarcastically. “Yes, Harry is my person-who-I’ve-been-dating-for-the-past-three-months.”
“You’re not forgiven,” Draco said with a smug look on his face. “Aren’t you too pretty to be a boy?”
sorry,” he mocked, then rested his head flat against the floor. “I can feel the beat thumping into my head.”
Harry grabbed his stuff and walked to his dorm. He was the Quidditch captain of the Gryffindor house, but he didn’t seem into it anymore. He was tired and just wanted to know what Draco was up to.
“Potter?”
“Not really,” Draco said with a shrug. “I’m a Malfoy. We’re pretty much born to lie and keep secrets to get what we want.”
Molly had sent him an invitation again, and he felt it would be too rude to decline. Taking a quill, he dipped it in ink and started writing to Molly Weasley, accepting her invitation to the Christmas dinner.
There was a pause. Until Draco’s cold expression crumbled. “I hate this, Harry. I hate that this is happening,” Draco mumbled, his hands starting to tremble. “We… shouldn’t do this anymore, should we? It’s a bad idea… it’s-”
“Fuck those rules, Draco,” Harry shut his eyes, trying to contain his emotions, but failing like usual. “I’m sick of treading carefully. The truth is, we’re on opposite sides of a war. That will always be the truth. No amount of rules is going to change that.”
“Well, no, but I did finish it in time, and now I get to relax rather than trying to finish it two days before the due date,” he said, then noticed Harry’s dejected expression. “...it’s alright, I said I’ll help. Just start the introduction, alright?”
That’s when Draco realized that he had been crying too.
*******
Once Harry pulled away, he gave a lingering look towards Draco before turning and laying back down on the bed, pulling the duvet over them both. Draco wrapped an arm around Harry, and they stayed that way under the Gryffindor finally managed to fall asleep, his soft snores making the Slytherin slowly fall asleep as well.
I hope you're having a wonderful 2021 so far!
“Are you out of your mind? Of course we’re going to come,” Ron shook his head. “That’s out of the question. But I do think we should think this through.”
“Harry-”
“Has anyone ever told you how rubbish you are at lying?”
And Draco stayed, because how could he ever say no?

“Seemed funny enough to me,” Harry said, grabbing his hands and flipping him over, intertwining their legs together. Just as he leaned forward to kiss Draco again, who seemed caught off guard, Hermione’s voice came from just outside the room, stopping the ‘pause’ in their curse.
“Harry, stop-”
. We’re in the damn library. Now, let if you’re not going to study, let me read, at least,” Draco said, pulling Harry’s chair closer to him and adjusting his head so that the other wasn’t uncomfortable leaning against him.
“You suppose? This is the second time we’re sitting this close to each other. You would’ve bled to death by now if it was still in place.”
“Oh, it’s a bit stupid,” he snatched it back from Draco. “Once it’s done. And if you tell me what you’re doing here?”
The next morning was dreadful. Harry woke up to the sun shining on his face. Since it seemed alarm clocks - or the chatter of his roommates - would not wake him up, he had to sleep with the curtains of his bed open. Blinking, he slowly put his glasses and got ready.
“I thought you’d never tell us,” Hermione said, getting excited all of a sudden. “You know, Ron and I did suspect it. Sneaking off for walks, not coming for dinner, not coming to your dorm till late night? You have a secret girlfriend, don’t you?”
Draco wrapped an arm around Harry, who leaned his head on his shoulder, calming himself. They sat there for a few moments in silence. Harry took a mental note of everything around him right now. Draco’s soft breathing, the slight breeze, the pink sky, the feeling of being in his arms.
“But Harry! These people practically treat you as their own son! I can’t mess up! Besides, they already hate me so much! Harry, I can’t do this. I can’t! They hate me! They’re going to hate me even more-”
It had been from Harry, of course.
“Nothing happened!” Harry lied very unsmoothly, his voice going a bit high pitched.
There was a moment of tenseness as the two stared at each other. Harry bit his lip, conflicted as to what to do or say, and then settled on doing something quite stupid.
“We’re about to cut the cake, so you can make out for like five more minutes,” Pansy said, quickly catching the pillow Harry threw at her. “We’ll tell everyone that you’ll come down in a bit.”
Harry felt hot tears running down his face, as he finally took off his fragile mask of numbness.
Harry was crying. He had taken off his glasses and thrown it to the side. Hot tears escaped his eyes, as he buried his face in his hands, trying to get it to stop. Hoping everything would just stop.
“Oh please. Yesterday,
“So you accept that you’re in love with Draco?”
Harry closed the map and stowed it away, exiting his dorm, not even paying attention to Dean and Seamus who were asking him where he was going.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Just then, the three heard footsteps approaching. Dumbledore cast a binding spell on Harry once again, and Draco quickly picked up the cloak, walking over to him and pulling it on Harry so he wouldn’t be seen.
“Yeah, no, you’re fine,” Harry said, standing up.
“Harry,” his voice cracked slightly. He reached forward and took his hand, gulping. “I’m sorry you’ve had to go through something like that.”
“Seems like you’re trying a little too hard to get his attention,” Blaise chuckled, quietening down when he earned a dirty look from Draco.
And suddenly Ginny cut him off, placing her lips on his, wrapping her arms around his neck.
“Just some old relative that I need to learn WSL for. And… I was thinking-”
Draco’s eyes widened slightly. “Pardon?”
“Another letter,” Hermione said, trying to take it from the owl, who quickly flew away from her and onto Harry’s shoulder. “Who keeps sending you these anyway?” she said, folding her arms.
Her eyes widened slightly, surprised. “That’s funny. Pansy told me he was reaching today.”
“Try for me,” he signed. “Please?”
The following Monday, Harry’s day started off relatively normal, feeling a bit at ease that Ginny wasn’t following him around anymore.
Harry had spent the last few weeks looking at the Marauders Map, trying to find out where Draco had been going, he was disappearing during classes from time to time.
“We should’ve planned a better time.”
“I love you,” Harry said again.
Shutting his bedside light off, despite himself, he thought of his boyfriend, with his stupid smile and his stupid hair, because at the very least, he had him for one more week, and he was grateful for even that.
“Oh dear, I guess it’s better for you to see and understand for yourself,” Pansy said with a long sigh as they walked into the Hall. Harry was seated at the Gryffindor table and was sitting beside Ron and Hermione. He turned to see Draco and slightly smiled at him. In return, Draco shot a demeaning glare at him before sitting down beside Pansy. “Come on, Draco. You’re being ridiculous.”
“What’s this?” he asked, looking down at the box questioningly.
“I guess we’re both stuck with bad luck, then,” Draco said, moving forward. He leaned downwards and brushed his lips against Harry’s ever so gently, as if to ask for permission. Their hearts were pounding as Draco kissed him again with more confidence, trying not to smile when Harry put his arms around his neck. It wasn’t a wet kiss this time. It wasn’t awkward and nor did Harry feel like it was some sort of obligation to be kissing Draco. It felt like a need that needed to be fulfilled.
“I need to know what happened, Harry,” Hermione told him.
“Harry, we’re supposed to be
“He probably has a secret girlfriend,” Ron said jokingly, but Hermione turned and nodded.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked Draco, watching him.
“What?”
push it. But was it really so bad for him to do that? He was only worried.
And then it happened. Sirius, gone through the veil. It was Harry’s fault, again. The words Remus said to him seemed to play in his head over and over again.
“Were you ever planning on telling me, or what?” Harry spoke after a few moments. His tone was icy; having zero sympathy nor emotion.
As soon as he had entered, he was a little grateful to see that Draco’s back was turned to him. He had thought maybe he would feel more at ease and more… warm if he saw Draco, but he still felt cold, if not colder. It was unnerving, to say the least, but Harry found himself actually being able to laugh and get along with everyone.
“What? Oh yeah, definitely.”
“You will be needed for a task soon,” he stated. Draco felt his blood run cold. “The Dark Lord needs something to be done. I’m not sure what yet. But I can convince him that you are worthy of it.”
“You’ve been through a lot,” Hermione frowned. “I’m just trying to make sure you feel comfortable around us.”
“You don’t need to say anything,” he shook his head. “I just wanted you to know that. I don’t want to fight with you Harry, not ever again. If you want to forget about…” he pointed to the mistletoe, “I understand.”
He nodded. “I understand, yeah. Thank you.”
“Yeah, ‘Mione’s right, mate. Don’t worry. I know this isn’t what you want to hear right now, but you need to let what’s happening pass. I know it feels like an eternity, but it’ll be over soon. Don’t worry.”
“What is it?” Ron asked, slightly annoyed, looking at Harry’s reflection instead of Harry himself.
“H...Harry, I can explain. Please, just listen-”
Draco simply lifted his arm to show his watch. “I missed you too. Happy birthday, darling,” he spoke softly while signing, but Harry simply pushed him back until they were on his bed. “It’s midnight and you’re so energized?”
Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, then kicked Pansy under the table. Hard.
“I know. You are such a Slytherin that you could be Salazar himself.”
“I’ve done the research necessary, and I’ll do more until we have to leave,” Hermione replied. “We’ll stay for the wedding. Then we’ll go.”
“For fuck’s sake,” he whispered under his breath as Snape practically dragged him to where Draco was standing, who looked up, raising an eyebrow as he looked at both of them.
Harry hesitantly took a few steps closer then sat back down on the bed, shaking his head. “Maybe we both imagined it,” he rolled his eyes, rubbing his scar.
“I really have no idea."
Harry stood up, clearing his throat. “Right, so, I’ll see you on Friday?”
“Very funny,” Harry said sarcastically. “Well, I just hope you don’t use it on your relative.”
“You should’ve come to see me first.”
“Maybe he’s turning a new leaf,” Harry shrugged. “I don’t suppose you expected him to stay the same forever.”
Draco licked his lips, carefully removing Harry’s hand from his crotch. “No."
you!” She sang.
“I was riding around on my broom a few months ago… upset about things. I needed to get away from my friends and everyone… I love Pansy and all, but…” he trailed off into silence, then shook his head. “Anyway, I found this place. I come here to clear my head sometimes.”
“Looks like he’s completely normal to me,” Ron said when he noticed Draco glaring at them. Harry finally looked away from him and focused on his food.
Harry, who was staring at the fire, now turned to Draco and sat a little closer to him. Harry gave him a reassuring look, a look that said that he could talk as much as he wanted to.
“You’ll be fine, Harry,” Draco reassured Harry. “I just have some work to do.”
“Draco,” Harry said when he saw Draco entering the Eight-Year Common Room. An even darker feeling than before had hit Harry’s chest, making him wonder what was wrong.
“Yeah,” he said. “It’s just…” he leaned forward, kissing him on the lips quickly, taking Harry by surprise. “I haven’t kissed you in a week, you know.”
Pansy shrugged. “...too badly,” she added.
“Take it, Harry,” Draco whispered. Harry hesitantly took it and stood up, quickly walking over to Dobby.
“So you agree that they would have to like the person to enjoy spending time with them?”
doing here?”
“Done. Rule two: we don’t talk about Voldemort.”
He felt happy that he was one of the people who could see Draco’s real side.

“That’s what I’m afraid of,” he whispered.
“Take it off, Draco, it’s boiling,” Harry replied, standing up and leaning against the open windowsill, breathing in the fresh, cold air. “Come here.”
“No luck?” Narcissa Malfoy asked as Draco lied down on his bed. Draco didn’t respond. She slowly sat down at the foot of his bed. “Send them a letter.”
Harry laughed, and Draco found himself trying not to smile at the way Harry’s face lit up as he laughed… then Draco remembered that he was under the cloak, so his mouth widened into a grin as they exited the Room of Requirement, on their way to the Eighth Year Common Room.
“I never learned how to properly block him out, Draco,” Harry replied. “Do you really want to break up with me?”
“Why do you look like you just had a major revelation?” she asked, placing a pile of clothes on his bed. “Laundry for the week. Listen, Ron and Hermione’s anniversary party is tonight, so try to look like less of a mess.”
boyfriend, if you say whatever you’re going to, I can keep my mouth shut? I have an obligation to protect the people around me. So as long as you don’t say it, we’re both safe. Otherwise… it’ll be on me. On my conscience.”
“Pansy, if anyone in my family found out about us… it wouldn’t be only me in danger, but Harry as well. Besides, I should back out while I’m ahead,” he stated. “You were right, you know. We are star crossed lovers. Meaning there’s no point in it.”
“Pansy! Just get on it with it.”
“Harry!” Hermione screeched as she entered the store. “What’s the emergency?"
“Well… alright then.” Hermione replied, admitting she was wrong. Ron absentmindedly wrapped an arm around her shoulders. Harry immediately smirked but hid it with his book, pretending to be reading intently.
Pansy burst out laughing. Draco stared at her in utter disbelief. “Sorry, just the thought of you being with Astoria was too much for me to take.” Pansy said with a laugh. “Come on, you were with Harry last night, weren’t you?”
“You can hear me?” Draco asked, eyes wide.
Despite Hermione’s tendencies to be early, they were actually late for once. Everyone was already at the party. Harry found it odd but a little nice to see her laidback and relaxed for once. Maybe it was because she was too afraid to be sharp with Harry. While he was grateful for his friends worrying for him, he felt rather irritated that he was treated so delicately, almost like glass.
All Draco felt was pain. Seeing him kissing someone else. Seeing someone else’s arms around his body, seeing someone else staring at him the way he should have been. All Draco could think was how he was the one who should have been kissing Harry, having his arms around Harry. Draco walked all the way to the empty bathroom.
“I’m not,” Harry shook his head. “I just want to spend time with you again.”
He looked up, waiting for Harry to finish, but he simply sat there with his mouth slightly open, frowning. “Tomorrow’s… Saturday,” he finished, gulping nervously. Draco nodded, a small smile on his face.
TW: Homophobia
This chapter is written from Draco's point of view and explores how he gets along with his new role as an Auror in the ministry of magic. However, this doesn't always go as smoothly as he imagined, because old rivalries are flaring up again.
I picked up my coat and put it back on. Immediately, I felt the warmth come back to me, which had been gone beforehand. My breath caught up with my calming nerves and I started to come back to normality. Hermione was standing to my left and Harry to my right. The new silver trio. Ron let out a frustrated grunt and walked off. It was probably better for both of us if he would remove himself from my eyesight. I straightened my coat and my posture. Work could begin now.
Harry and I walked into the elevator after we had said goodbye to Hermione. We would see her today at lunch again. Since Harry and I shared an office we reached it after a short walk. As I stepped inside I felt instantly at home. The black laptops on the light wooden desks reminded me, that this was the one place where I felt like I was in my element. This was my place to shine. Weasley could suffocate waiting for me to fail at my job.
“Yeah. I’m his boyfriend. Is there a problem with that?” I knew exactly what Weasley’s problem was. He hated to see me in one of those places, where he never would have expected me. Just like the little, poor pure blood he was. He couldn’t even use Voldemort’s name. Hermione was right, when she mentioned, that the avoidance of a name only produced more anxiety about the wearer of that name. “I need to leave now, Weasley. I have work to do.” The adrenaline was slowly receding to where it came from. My pride had not been broken, by Weasley’s little tantrum. He would have to live with me being here.
We were standing with our backs to a clearing of a forest. It had lost most of its leaves, because of the continued cold temperatures. Luckily, we were wearing our coats, which kept us from being congealed to ice blocks. To our right, a big valley lay beneath the ground we were standing on. The fog was rising from the bottom. It almost looked like the whole dell was filled with lots of misty clouds. But what actually were we doing here? Draco had got an important tip from Hermione, that the death eater ring, would be holding its next meeting here.
“Hermione, Aileen!”, I screamed. They turned towards me and came running. Both of them looked quite worried. “Is everything alright?”, Aileen asked, as she was bending down to Draco. “Just leave me, - please”, Draco muttered with a strained and tearful voice. He rose to his feet and walked away from us. “Draco, wait", I meant quietly. Why was he walking away now? Was he doing alright? “Harry, leave him, it’s alright”, Remus meant calmly. “Are you two ladies alright?”, he asked Hermione and Aileen. They nodded. “We beat them pretty well.” Aileen seemed to be proud of all of us. “Sounds like we should all get home and get something to drink”, I announced. “And what do we do with all the death eaters, which are still here?”, Hermione asked. “Just leave them here. Voldemort will collect them. We should focus on Bellatrix and Lucius”, I answered. “Absolutely we will do that”, Draco agreed, who had returned unnoticed. I rubbed his back and looked at him. He nodded. “Let’s go home then”, Remus proposed, while extending his arm. We all grabbed either a part of his hand or arm and thus we all disappeared from this horrendously cold place.
Lucius attacked his own son, Draco, while the other death eaters were coming for us. They marched forward in the same formation as Hermione, Aileen, and I were. Three of them reached us simultaneously. While Hermione and Aileen were busy fighting a duo of death eaters, I had an unfortunate encounter with Bellatrix Lestrange. How I despise that woman with every possible inch of my skin. We were standing opposite of each other.
