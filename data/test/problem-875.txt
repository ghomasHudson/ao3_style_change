Draco tried very hard not to think about what Potter might have done with Finch-Fletchley on the train. He had to live with the other boy for a year, so he might as well try to make it as cordial as possible. When Finch-Fletchley stopped his dancing to meet Draco’s eyes in a challenging stare, Draco held his gaze and smiled tightly. He stepped into the room towards the smaller boy and held out his hand.
“When was the last time Slytherin won the Quiddich House Cup though,” Theo shot back slyly, earning a hard punch on the arm from Tracey.
“This doesn’t change anything Pans” he said, meeting her eyes finally. “I just want to get through this year.”
He batted her off him and pointed to the empty chair next to him, but she waved him away and wandered off to get herself a cup of tea. She returned with two mugs and handed one to him, then she settled in the chair, folding one leg underneath herself and leaning forward to rest her elbows on the table. If her mother could see her she’d have a heart attack. She sipped her tea and looked at him pointedly.
She glanced down at the scorch mark on the front of his white school shirt, in the centre of his chest. The end of his Slytherin tie had been disintegrated, and what was left was smoking slightly.
“I’ve kissed a few people. Not Blaise though,” he added in a rush, “but I was in denial about myself for ages, and then the last few years... there just wasn’t the time,” he finished lamely.
Draco smiled. The idea of paying Potter back for his lateness with escargot flitted across his mind, but he squashed it. He wasn’t actively trying to ruin this.
Potter huffed, running a hand through his hair. It was getting longer on top, the silky black tufts sticking straight up in places.
“Fine, if you want a plan so badly, we’ll think of something good on Saturday. You worry too much you know.”
Weasley folded his arms. Potter pulled out his cigarette pack, stuck one between his lips, and lit it with the tip of his wand.
Some violence and mentions of implied past violence in this chapter. Also a lot of time talking about Draco’s hair to make up for it.
Draco’s anxiety spiked. He didn’t want to go near any of them if he could help it. He didn’t want to deal with the past, he wanted to hide away in the dungeons, do his classes, and get his NEWTs. He wanted to never see any of them again, but Pansy and Blaise were already getting to their feet so he reluctantly followed them. His hands were cold but his palms were sweaty, and he hoped to Merlin that no one could see him trembling.
“I’m taking Potter back up to the castle. I’d like you to join us,” his tone of voice implying that this was not a request.
Draco blinked rapidly, feeling a complex cocktail of emotions bubbling up in his chest. He sat down on the edge of his bed, worrying a Slytherin tie in his hands.
“Study period too, but I doubt anyone would be worrying if I don’t show up where I’m supposed to be, they never usually do.” He grimaced.
Without any greeting Blaise turned on Draco and spat, “Weasley snores,” as though Draco had planned the room assignments specifically to annoy him.
“Um Draco? Have you and Blaise ever...?” Justin asked softly out of the darkness, the end of his sentence hanging heavily in the air.
“Good morning sunshine! What you doing over here at the boring table?” Potter asked, tugging on a strand of Luna’s long blonde hair. He glanced past Luna and spotted Draco, his eyebrows quirking up in surprise.
Before he could reply, Blaise was standing before them, his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, holding a shot in each hand. Pansy reached for one, but Blaise downed both shots, one after the other, and grinned down at them cheerfully.
Howard’s face twisted in anger when Potter dismissed him with his body language. He glanced behind himself, towards something Draco couldn’t see, and when he turned back his expression was calculating. Draco didn’t like it one bit. He tugged at Potter’s arm, wanting to escape this whole situation before anything else happened. Potter looked at him again, his sharp eyes softening slightly, and he allowed himself to be pulled.
Boot was sitting on the other side of the common room with Anthony Goldstein, obviously offended by the mere existence of the Slytherin’s. His perpetually angry expression shifted to one of surprise when Pansy burst out laughing and shot him the finger.
He gestured to the pictures on the wall behind him. Draco guessed that was the band who was singing. He rubbed his arms uneasily.
“Mother is going to get married again,” he said in a bored voice, gently stroking a finger over Nyx's inky feathers. She clicked her orange beak happily.
“It looks like it’s not you that’s starting trouble, but it’s your choice Mr Malfoy. I’m just here to patch you students up, not to pass judgements.”
Draco spoke to him in French, and the man’s smile brightened as he replied. Potter looked between them with his eyebrows raised. Draco had to admit that he was showing off a little, and the small gleam of admiration in Potter’s eyes was worth it. He asked about the specials and made a quick decision on what to order before he overthought it. The waiter nodded happily and took away the menus.
Draco had all the same NEWT classes with the two girls, and he’d already made his peace with the fact that he’d never come top in any of them. When his father had been on the school’s board of governors he’d been furious to find out that Draco had been beaten in every class by a muggleborn. Every near impeccable test result had been met with scorn, and the occasional severe punishment, because he hadn’t managed to outrank Granger. He had hated her for it. More than the simple hate he had been taught to have for all muggleborns, Granger had seemed like a personal thorn in his side.
“Although,” he muttered, as the students around them started to settle down, “I’ll always accept a favour from the future Minister.”
After finally getting Potter to be honest with him, Draco decided he needed some time to think. If he was going to get involved with this crazy plan, he wanted to do it properly.
A shoulder bumped his and he looked up. Potter stood next to him, his back to the bar, facing the room. He leaned his elbows back to prop himself against the bar top.
Howard staggered up and charged at Potter, fists swinging. He knocked Potter backwards, and he fell heavily into a table covered in empty glasses. Shattered glass sprayed from the table, slicing through Potter’s bare forearms. Without a pause, Potter righted himself and swung for Howard. They grappled back and forth before Potter’s head snapped back from a blow to the face. He floundered, then slashed his wand back around. Howard was forced off his feet again, slamming backward into the floor. In a blink Potter was straddling Howard’s chest, raining punches down on him, while Howard tried to shake him off.
Pansy threw a sugar cube at each of them. One of them hit Draco on the shoulder, but Luna caught the other and popped it into her mouth with a grin.
Fred and George nodded solemnly. “Of course mum,” George says and Fred cracks another wide smile. “Thank you for the idea! Bye!” Before Mrs. Weasley could get around to smacking them, the twins ran away towards the front of the train. “Those boys will be the death of me,” she grumbles under her breath.
The boy frowns, making his face look like a ferret, Harry stifles a laugh. “Hagrid? Do you mean that old fool who takes care of Hogwarts? That’s hilarious! I’ve heard that he gets so drunk-” Harry jumps up. “Don’t say another word! Hagrid is a great person.” Neither boy say a word for a few moments, all that can be heard in the store is Madame Malkin’s pins.
Draco walks alongside Harry, who points and gasps at shops and people. “Stop that! You are making us seem like tourists,” he says. Harry laughs. “But I am a tourist Draco! Woah, what’s that?” Harry points to a large crowd gathered in front of a window. “Come on, let’s look!” he shifts his bags into his right hand and grabs Draco’s hand. Draco looked down, startled. Harry takes off running, with Draco in tow.
Harry Potter stumbles in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasion, arms filled with school supplies. Madam Malkin, who hated when people clogged up her perfectly spacious store, paused in the middle of pinning another boys’ robes to turn around. “Hogwarts?” she asks. Harry nods slowly. “Then, please move away from the door and sit. Once I’m finished with Mr. Malfoy you can be next.” Madam Malkin turns back abruptly, leaving Harry to sit in one of the comfortable chairs in front of the boy getting fitted.
Mrs. Weasley glances at a nearby clock. “Stop tickling your sister boys, it’s almost eleven!” George sets Ginny on the ground softly before tweaking her on the nose. “See you at Christmas alright? Be good.” Fred crouches at her ear. “Don’t do anything we wouldn’t do,” he says in a whisper just loud enough for everyone else to hear. Their mother starts to dig in her purse, all the Weasley children groan. “Mum, we don’t need the sandwiches,” Ron says pleadingly, “We had a big breakfast you know, I’m not hungry at all!”
Harry watches as his travel companions get in line to have Mrs. Weasley drop a plastic ball onto their freckled hands. They all tried to smile at their mother but Harry could see how each of the children quickly shoved the ball deep in their pockets behind their mother’s back. Mrs. Weasley hugged her kids tightly together and then said, “Better be off then. Make sure to be nice to professors-” she shot a look at the twins, who smiled mischievously. “And no funny business boys, I do not want to get a letter from the school that you’ve blown up a bathroom or something.”
Mr. Malfoy turned out not to be a grown man like Harry had thought, but a boy with pale hair and skin. Harry smiles at the boy nervously before dumping his luggage on a chair beside him. The pale-haired boy scoffs. “You have to lug all that junk around? That’s a pity, my mum is carrying my supplies in a special bag. It can never be full.” Harry shrugs. “Hagrid’s carrying most of my books,” he says “But I couldn’t just have him take everything.”
Mrs. Weasley smiles, “Why yes! All of my children will be attending this year, except Ginny.” next to her, the little girl frowned, making Harry think this was a sore subject. “The platform is just this way.” Mrs. Weasley points to the wall behind her. The twins laugh when they see Harry’s face. Percy looks at Harry apologetically and says “Mum, I don’t think Harry knows how to get to the platform.” Judging by all of the Weasley's confused faces, Harry guessed this was unusual.
“Alright, Mr.- what’s your name again? You are done, just sign a few things so I may send your robes to you.” Madam Malkin says. Harry takes the quill that had been poking him and writes his name on the papers before setting them face down on a nearby desk. “Thank you, Madam!” Harry says. Then he turns to Draco. “Shall we go then? I’m starving!” Harry grabs his supplies, piling them up in one hand to open the door. Draco follows, debating with himself if he should help or not.
Hello! Are you Draco Malfoy or did I remember your address wrong? I hope my owl found you, she seemed a bit anxious when I had tied the letter to her leg… Do you like my owl? Her name is Hedwig, a name she picked for herself by pecking at my school books. Speaking of books, why did we have to get so many? I don’t even want to imagine the amount of homework we’ll be doing in a few months.
Potter's intense expression broke into a big delighted smile. Draco’s stomach gave a lurch, and he suddenly felt nervous.
Sure, Draco had gotten there early because he got everywhere early, but now it was one fifteen, and Potter was officially late.
Draco sneered at him, but there was another pop of a spell and Draco hit the ground before everything faded to blackness.
“I have no idea how the Gryffindor’s and Ravenclaw's lived in towers for the last 7 years. These stairs might kill me. At least it explains why Patil has such a spectacular arse.”
“NO! No, sorry, I phrased that badly! I meant there’s a few of us going, as a friend group,” she said in a rush.
Draco’s blood ran cold. Without a thought he threw himself forwards, skidding on pieces of broken glass. He grabbed hold of Potter and dragged him backwards.
They piled into the room, and there sat McGonagall behind her desk, her hands clasped tightly in front of her. The deep frown on her face spoke volumes without her needing to say a word. Beside her, behind the desk, standing tall with his huge arms folded across his chest, was Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic.
Potter shifted around on his chair, stretching his legs out under the table. His feet brushed against Draco’s and they both jumped. He coughed, but didn’t move his legs.
“Before I could even think about going back to sleep, an owl showed up at the window with a letter from Andromeda.”
Potter stumbled a few steps and Draco let go of him. The loss of the warmth of Potter’s fingers on his skin made his heart ache. The hungry, heated expression on Potter’s face melted into confusion.
The note he had received that morning felt heavy in his pocket. It was the first time his mother had replied to any of his letters this year. After telling her that he couldn’t come home for Christmas, Ulysses had proudly returned with a sealed envelope, and Draco had recognised Narcissa Malfoy’s customised stationery immediately. He’d felt a hopeful flutter in his stomach, before he’d opened the letter to see one single line, written in his mother’s impeccable calligraphy:
He heard retreating footsteps and then it was quiet for a while. Draco was wide awake now, puzzling over the conversation.
There was an awkward silence. Potter picked his menu up again, stared at it like it was something offensive, then looked back up at Draco.
He collapsed back against the bed. The Matron leaned over him with a small jar she pulled from her pocket, applying a greasy salve to the red mark on his chest. It cooled immediately, and Draco breathed a sigh of relief.
“Oh that’s my fault I’m afraid Parkinson,” Finch-Fletchley piped up from across the table, “Ernie and I whisked him down for breakfast with us and I didn’t think. My apologies.”
Potter was distracted by the food again, and Draco was glad he’d chosen something simple but delicious. Whenever Raphael put his steak frites with béarnaise sauce and green beans on the specials menu, you knew the chef was in a good mood, and the dish always sold out.
“Sooo, what do you think?” he asked her, shaking his head from side to side so his hair swished over his shoulders.
“None of this is in any way your fault. If you want to blame someone, I’d recommend the Dark Lord. You know, the guy with an inferiority complex who started a war.”
“I can wait for you by the door, if you want Hermione?” she asked, glancing back and forth between Draco and Granger uncertainly.
He weaved across the common room, dancing around people and sliding through gaps in the crowd. He spotted Luna and Girl Weasley dancing together, pressed close by the crush of people around them, and he grinned happily.
Draco came back from dinner to find Finch-Fletchley in their room, knee deep in discarded clothes, the Spice Girls blaring in the background. He’d never seen the other boy so happy. Draco hadn’t even thought about dressing up for the party. Finch-Fletchley gleefully started flinging Draco’s clothes around the room as well as his own, when Draco asked for his help in picking an outfit.
He shook himself and tugged on a long sleeved cotton top, before sliding back into bed. He really was exhausted. He lay down, shifting onto his side to take the pressure off his back, and tried to forget about everything. It was hours before he drifted into fitful sleep.
“I don’t know about everyone else here, but I’m not comfortable sharing a room with Slytherin’s and Death Eaters.” He glared at Draco.
“Do you want to run through the Arithmancy exercises?” Granger asked, her business-like formality breaking up the awkward tension.
“Granger?” he blurted out, and she paused, her arms full of books. “Could I talk to you for a minute? Privately?”
“I saw him come in really early in the morning a while ago. At the time I assumed he’d come from somewhere else in the castle, I didn’t even think that he might have been out of the school.”
Draco hadn’t had much contact with Beckett, as he didn’t take Defence anymore. The man radiated a calm authority, which eased some of the churning in Draco’s stomach, but didn’t entirely win him over.
Standing there in the half light, Potter looked like some debauched God of ancient times, and Draco didn’t feel nervous or embarrassed. He raised his chin and met Potter’s gaze steadily. It was Potter who broke the eye contact this time, rubbing a hand through his hair, shoving it back off his face and exposing that famous scar, white against his brown skin. Draco had a sudden ridiculous urge to touch it.
Draco didn’t feel like laughing anymore. His insides felt cold. He looked away and saw Justin was also watching Blaise, a small frown creasing between his eyes.
Blaise sighed and got to his feet. Draco slid out of his side of the booth, and followed Blaise to the bar.
He pulled Potter’s legs up onto the bed, and rolled him onto his side. He wondered how it was that the universe kept finding new ways to torture him.
“I study with Perks and Finnigan because we all take Astronomy, but I’m not going on outings with them! Why didn’t you tell me about this?” she said shrilly.
“Of course I like Justin, everybody likes Justin. We really should have gotten an emotional support Hufflepuff years ago.”
“I guess that explains why Connie didn’t want to come back to school this year,” said Anthony Goldstein a few seats down the table. “Her dad must have agreed to put her on the Prophet payroll. She certainly knows enough students to get the inside scoop.”
He fidgeted with the tiny coffee cup, slightly at a loss for what to do now. Potter seemed to feel the same.
“Look,” Potter started again, “I came to find you to ask if you wanted to go out with me on Saturday... so I can apologise?”
“No matter the gender, Potter clearly still has no taste,” he forced out, praying his voice remained calm, “or any decorum. A toilet on the train? He’s so desperate he can’t wait until we arrive? He never did have any self control.” He gave a disgusted sniff.
She rolled onto her back again and fell into a brooding silence. Draco sat with her for a bit quietly, before he headed up for the privacy of his room.
Draco’s mind whirled. Potter had said he’d never slept with a girl, so he hadn’t been with girl Weasley. Which Weasley had he slept with?
After his classes finished Draco made it to the library in one piece. When he walked in he felt contentment wash over him. He’d always loved this library. He loved the high ceilings and the dark wood shelves that were taller than anyone could reach. The hush was so peaceful. It was never too cold or too warm. He loved that you could get lost in it. It was like a maze, and while wandering the tall dark shelves you could come across a study area with little tables, or a window with a squishy window seat, or a comfortable reading nook, or a couple aggressively making out.
Potter’s anger was contained under a calm facade now. He straightened lazily and turned his back on Howard, smiling winningly at Madam Rosmerta. She had appeared behind the bar, worrying a dish cloth in her hands, her eyes assessing the situation with a frown. Draco didn’t move. He couldn’t look away from a potential threat.
Draco was just wiping his eyes when Madame Pomfrey came back around the curtain. She spared a glance at Luna, before bending over him to check his chest. He looked down at it and saw that the redness had receded to a pale pinkish colour. The Matron gave him a tight smile.
Ooof that was a hard chapter to write. I'm not sure why but it took ages! As a heads up, I'm travelling with work next week and I'm not sure if I'll have enough time (or data) to upload the next chapter but I shall do my best to. If I can't, our regularly scheduled programming will continue the week after! ~Kisses~
The few stragglers left in the common room were the eighth years who planned to Apparate home from the village. They’d been able to enjoy a little lie in, and would be settled in at home before lunchtime. Draco’s stomach twisted a little, thinking about what Christmas used to mean to him. The parties at the Manor, and how happy his mother would be. She had loved Christmas.
They ate in silence. Potter looked up occasionally, glancing around the restaurant. Draco cursed his own awkwardness.
Draco’s heart skipped. He thought Potter was going to kiss him, but instead he ghosted his lips along Draco’s jaw, his breath hot. Draco’s skin tingled. He pressed a soft kiss under Draco’s ear, before dragging his lips down Draco’s neck, pushing his hair back and pulling the collar of his jumper aside to press his face against him. He breathed deeply, drinking Draco in.
On the other side of the booth, Blaise was leaning in close to speak to Potter, their shoulders touching. He laughed softly, then maintained eye contact with Potter while he chased the straw in his drink around with his tongue.
Blaise sloped off towards the record player to convince Justin to turn down the volume and Draco knew that games were afoot. The ball game seemed to have ended, a few people were still swaying around to the music but most had gathered near the fire. Potter was smoking over by the windows with Finnigan and Thomas.
He’d said that so many times to himself it was like a mantra. He didn’t even want to think about what life would be like when school was over.
Blaise’s money was safe. There were only two people per room, but McGonagall had made sure to mix the Houses up. Draco watched the sour look cross Pansy’s face when she saw her name on a door under the name ‘Parvati Patil’, before she plastered on a smile to greet her new roommate. Draco’s stomach started to churn as he wondered who his roommate would be. It would be just awful if it was Boot. What if it was Potter? He tripped going up the stairs at the thought. He wasn’t sure which would be worse. With a rush of fear he wished Blaise had waited for him, but squashed his emotions quickly. He wasn’t a child. If he was going to make it through the year he would have to bear whatever was thrown at him, with quiet dignity.
The train was filling up, so they carried on towards the end of the platform. As the engine smoke began to clear, Draco's steps faltered. Up ahead, leaning casually against a wrought iron pillar, was Harry Potter.
“Oh, that could be fun,” Tracey piped up, craning her neck to look over at Thomas cheering while Brown chugged back whatever was in the glass.
The pervious year, when the whole world had gone to shit and he’d been certain that he could be killed any day, he’d found a unique way of rebelling. Not anything useful that could have ended the war, he hadn’t been brave enough to join the DA, but it took his mind off of his spiralling doubt about all the choices he’d made. Whenever they were allowed into Hogsmeade, he and Blaise had apparated into muggle London and gone shopping.
Now he’d calmed down, he thought about what Potter was saying. What would it mean to publicly date Potter? Not a real relationship, but one that could benefit them both, with the added bonus of not having to worry about how Potter felt about him. Draco had recently been thinking about how to be more open about his sexuality after all. This would send a pretty clear message to the wizarding world.
There was one last vial on the tray, full of a clear liquid. He regarded it warily when she handed it to him, still coughing a little.
“I don’t blame you Draco. It wasn’t your choice to keep me there, and there was very little you could have done.”
The first two weeks back ended up being pretty quiet. Finch-Fletchley was a much better roommate than Draco could have imagined. He found classes so much less stressful without the shadow of the war hanging over him. The library was just as peaceful as it ever was. He really should have appreciated those two weeks more.
He wasn’t the only one to have noticed. Headmistress McGonagall was eyeing the Gryffindor table with a pinched frown.
The atmosphere in the room plummeted so quickly Draco’s head swam. The Slytherin’s all turned murderous expressions on Boot and even Justin looked angry. Everyone else looked uncomfortable. Draco’s gut twisted painfully, but it wasn’t new information to anyone, Boot was just trying to remind them all he was an outsider.
Pansy elbowed him sharply and Draco flinched. She’d caught him right in a fresh bruise he’d gotten in a nasty fall that morning. Fifth years thought knock back jinxes were so funny.
Draco rolled his eyes. Blaise was well aware of this. He still preened like the peacock he was before standing to leave again.
“Leave it alone Howard, you great idiot,” another man at the bar said to the beefy man with a grimace.
“OK but... But... Why the fuck would you pick me?” Draco half shouted, exasperated, “I’m a Death Eater! How will this help your image at all?”
“Harry is the closest thing I have to a brother. I want to be responsible for him. I choose to be in his business, even though I know most of the time he wishes I wouldn’t. I just don’t know how to help him when he won’t listen to me.”
Pansy threw her magazine aside excitedly. Blaise sat down with a casual air and smoothed his shirt front. It must be excellent gossip if he was drawing it out like this.
Pansy turned and smacked Blaise hard across the back of the head, causing him to yelp and anxiously check his hair in the reflection of a knife.
The Headmistress stood slowly from her chair, her gaze locked on Potter, her eyebrows raised in imperious disapproval.
“Ummmm... what I mean is, it was a set up,” he forced himself to continue, “That man in the pub said all manner of horrible things to Potter with the purpose of getting a reaction out of him. He was working with the camera man.”
“OK, OK, chill. I’m not getting up early to wave everyone off with a hanky. Shall we say midday? The common room will be empty by then.”
He pulled on a jumper, and thicker socks onto his feet, before sitting down at his desk. He found the incomplete letter he had started a few days before in a pile of Herbology notes, and reread the few short lines. Wrinkling his nose, he picked up his quill, dipped it into his ink well, and crossed out what he’d written.
“What about our marriage of convenience to appease our homophobic families? Shall I cancel the caterer?”
Pansy would want to know why, and Draco needed to think of what he would say to convince her. All the shallow, practical reasons that his Slytherin brain had supplied him with in that alley were only part of it. He barely wanted to admit it to himself, but he had missed Potter’s attention. Logically he knew that this was more of a business arrangement than a relationship, but he’d be lying if he didn’t acknowledge that the biggest reason he’d agreed was an excuse to spend time with Potter.
Potter pulled out his cigarettes as soon as they were outside, and lit one. He walked in silence, one hand shoved in his jeans pocket. It was still softly snowing, the ground crunching underfoot, and Potter wasn’t wearing his jacket.
A day late sorry, but this chapter is extra long so please forgive me. I didn't want to cut off mid date so I just kept going. I warned you it would take a while to get there, but we finally have some fake boyfriends, hurrah ~Kisses~
He tried to carry on reading, but when he realised he could have walked down to Hogsmeade with Pansy, and come back by now, if he’d known Potter was going to be this late, he started to get pissed off.
The last few years had been awful. The twisted memories took up the space of what was once a bright and joyful thing.
Patil looked up with startled eyes. Luna just nodded absently while she carried on writing her History of Magic essay in her loopy cursive. Granger turned her questioning gaze on Draco in exasperation.
Potter stood behind the sofa, Finnigan and Thomas behind him. His eyes danced mischievously in the light of the fire, a challenging smirk on his lips.
Coming face to face with cruel words this evening, even if they had been mainly aimed at Potter, had shaken him more than he wanted to admit.
Draco knew he had been to every class they shared so far this week, and possibly all his other classes too. Maybe he was trying to prove a point to the Headmistress? Did he need help with homework? Surely that would be something he would go to Hermione for.
The track changed on the record player. He looked back at Finch-Fletchley, who was still watching him carefully, as though expecting him to loose his temper at any moment .
She helped him into a soft hospital robe, and into the bed. Then she whisked away around the curtain. He sat for a moment by himself, and the reality of the afternoon came crashing over him. By the time Madam Pomfrey returned with a tray full of little bottles a few minutes later, he had worked himself up into such a state that he was hyperventilating. She calmly placed the tray down on the table beside the bed, picked up a small vial of milky liquid, and pushed it into his hand.
Granger and Turpin were watching him shrewdly. Granger took a sip of the drink she was holding, and met his eyes steadily.
Potter was chuckling as the starters arrived. Draco was trying to contain how thrilled he was at having made Potter laugh.
“Ummmm Hermione? Are you really asking me out in front of your boyfriend? Because I’m flattered, but I really don’t... I mean I’m...” he stuttered.
“What I mean is, this isn’t logic Grang... Hermione. You think there’s an answer for every problem, but this isn’t something you can look up in a book. Potter is processing trauma, we all are, and there’s no one way to do that.”
“Why wouldn’t you Draco? It’s just one date. You never know? You might hit it off,” she said optimistically.
What most people didn’t know, is that Draco had developed a recent fondness for muggle clothes. He’d always been a lover of fashion, and a beautifully tailored wizard robe was simply perfect, but over the years at Hogwarts he’d grown more and more intrigued by muggle styles. It was a whole new world of clothing to explore.
“So Potter is really on the outs with the Weasley’s then?” Draco asked carefully, watching as Luna began pouring way too much honey into her porridge.
“Butterbeers are not conducive to the evenings festivities,” Blaise continued, pointing to the only drinks on the table. “What will everyone be having? The first round is on Draco.”
He believed that his mother loved him. He wanted to believe that everything she had done had been out of a misguided belief that she was doing the right thing. The problem was that every step Draco had taken away from everything he had been raised to believe, the more withdrawn his mother had become.
Luna turned back to Draco with a soft sigh, and rested her cheek on her fist, with her elbow on the table.
Potter ran a hand over his face and through his hair, looking away into the crowd. He blew out a harsh breath, and shifted to pull his cigarettes from his back pocket. He pulled one from the pack and twirled it between his fingers, but he didn’t light it. The motion drew Draco’s attention to Potter’s fingernails, which were painted lime green.
“Back so soon Miss Weasley? Miss Roper is resting. Mr Malfoy, what on Earth has happened to your leg?” the Matron greeted them as they tumbled through the Hospital wing doors.
“Do you really think people assume I’m straight? Is this why I’ve had no success with Ravenclaw Patil?”
He was completely drained. The emotional marathon he’d just been on weighed heavy on his shoulders, as he lurched across the corridor and into the blessed peace of his own room. In the familiarity of his space, Draco felt shaky. He went to sit on the edge of his bed, clasping the mattress tightly to ground himself.
“Well good. I hope you enjoy yourself, I’m off to bed. I’m knackered,” he huffed wearily. The mere thought of a party put him instantly on edge
Instead of snapping he replied calmly, “Do you honestly believe I could bribe Hermione Granger with some Gillywater and Firewhisky? You know her better than that Potter.”
They rounded a corner into a quiet study area, and Luna paused, her head slightly tilted. Draco looked across the tables and saw Granger and Ravenclaw Patil diligently working away together with a mound of books between them. Luna glanced at him, and then made her way over to the two girls, with Draco following silently behind her.
“Don’t be silly Pans, you aren’t my bodyguard. And I don’t need you to go on some sort of vigilante revenge rampage.”
Potter looked at him then, his eyebrows quirking up in surprise. There was a studded bar through his eyebrow today instead of his usual ring. Draco stared at it.
Draco was putting his height to good use, trying to track down Luna. He eventually spotted her white blonde head over by the windows.
“How is it possible that he doesn’t realise how massively queer we both are?” she gasped incredulously to Draco in between chuckles.
He woke up on his bed, Finch-Fletchley and Blaise hovering above him. Finch-Fletchley was wringing his hands.
Pansy alternated between ignoring Padma, and trying to engage her in passive aggressive conversation. Draco tried to jump in and save Padma as often as he could, and she smiled gratefully at him when Pansy was distracted with her drink.
“Sort of. She wanted me to just ask you for your help out right. I thought it would be a better idea if we tried the whole date thing...” he said awkwardly.
Ernie MacMillan was lounging on a sofa in the common room when they got downstairs. He shot to his feet when he saw Draco and his face contorted into the same suspicious squint as Longbottom. Finch-Fletchley tugged Draco forward by the arm and he realised he had stilled under MacMillan’s scrutiny.
Soon, they were ready. For what they were ready for, Harry didn’t know, but he hoped they would get to the platform soon. Every time he glanced at the clock on the wall near them it seemed to be getting nearer and nearer to 11:00. He pushed his cart beside Ron, who seemed to be sleeping standing up. “Excuse me, Ronald?” Harry says and taps the boy's shoulder lightly.
“Can I please go, mum? Please, please, pleeeeeease?” she begs. George laughs and scoops the little Weasley into his arms. She squeals in delight. “Ginny, you aren't the only one who wants you to come,” George says, making Ginny look into his eyes. Fred joins them. “But we need to be able to warn everyone at Hogwarts that the great Ginny Weasley is coming.” Harry was surprised by their serious tone. Next to him, Ron whispers “Wait for it Harry, don’t be fooled.”
Harry thinks about that. “So you stay with the houses for the entire time you’re at school? Sounds brilliant to me.” Draco composes himself and turns his head back to say “Yes, my family has always been in Slytherin. So that’s what house I’m going to be in.” he says confidently. Madam Malkin clears her throat. “Mr. Malfoy, if you do not stand still for at least a moment then your robes will be too small this year,” she says. Draco stills, “Yes Madam Malkin. Sorry.” Harry smiles at Draco’s back. For someone who had such an imperious attitude, Draco definitely was scared of Madam Malkin. A comfortable silence settles in the shop. Harry, absorbing the info about Hogwarts, and Draco, feeling embarrassed by the fact he had gotten scolded in front of a complete stranger.
Luna sat down happily beside him and began to pour a selection of different juices into one glass. Pansy was staring at her like she was an exotic animal in a zoo.
Potter hadn’t let go of the Ravenclaw boy and was bringing his fist back to hit him again, when the other boy got an arm around Potter’s neck, wrenching him away and down.
McGonagall definitely didn’t know how to react to Potter’s little speech, but she responded in her usual clipped manner.
“Yes, well,” he continued, working to keep his voice calm and hide the panic that had been building for days now, “we should talk. In the common room after everyone is gone? Make a plan?” he stressed.
“Morning Harry. I’m having a family breakfast with Draco. You look tired, I hope you’re not still being haunted by that Mare?”
“It’s fine,” said Draco casually, as though he hadn’t been working himself up into a nervous wreak for twenty minutes.
Draco lay very still, listening to the sounds of the two boys as they left the room, and then waiting a bit longer in case Blaise changed his mind and came back.
Draco looked down at his notes. He was uncomfortable. He wasn’t used to telling people how he really felt about anything.
“That was months ago old boy,” he rolled his eyes and slapped Draco’s arm playfully, “You should have asked. On the train, that was just fun, I mean you can’t blame me? Harry is hot.”
“Good morning darling. You might have left me a little note or something, I looked everywhere for you,” she huffed, before smiling sweetly at him when he handed her a cup of black tea with 3 sugars.
When he looked up Finch-Fletchley had turned to grin at him, an unusual expression for someone about to tell him to piss off. Maybe this had just been a joke at Draco’s expense the whole time.
Weasley and Lovegood deposited him against one of the beds. He wrapped an arm across the burning in his chest with a groan.
Hermione seemed to know he wasn’t done though, because she wordlessly kept pace with him when they left the classroom.
Something about him looked different, and it took Draco a moment to figure it out as he watched Potter shrug out of his leather jacket and scarf. For a start there was nothing dangling from his ears. There was just a simple row of silver studs instead. He didn’t have any eye makeup on, not even eyeliner. He still wore his heavy boots, but his black jeans had no rips in them, and he was wearing a plain green shirt. When he pulled his chair out to sit down, Draco saw that his fingernails were bare. He hadn’t seen Potter without painted nails once this year. He looked like he’d made an effort to be presentable, but Draco found that he was disappointed. He liked the way Potter always surprised him with his style.
She smiled at him, and he saw the glimmer of hope in her eyes. She wanted to be his family. Even knowing who he was and what he had done, she wanted to claim him. The tears that had threatened to make an appearance a few minutes before now slid down his cheeks.
He could still hear the crowd in the pub, still see the people gathered around shifting uncomfortably. Potter and Howard were frozen in place, their eyes darting around in shock, the enraged expression stuck on Potter’s face.
“I shouldn’t have said anything,” he said ruefully, finally putting the cigarette he had been playing with between his lips, and lighting it with his wand wordlessly, “I came over here to flirt with you and I’ve failed miserably.”
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Potter get up and disappear back into the crowd. He turned his head to watch him leave, feeling forlorn.
“Well I should go and get a drink, this is a party after all,” he said quickly, laughing nervously. “I’ll see you girls later.”
Draco found Granger in the library later that day. He was deep within the labyrinth of the shelves, looking for a very old compendium of rare medical plants which Madam Pince swore was here somewhere, when he spotted her. She was squashed into a narrow window seat recess, her knees pulled up to her chest. She wasn’t reading any of the books stacked around her, she was just staring out of the window, watching the last crimson rays of light bleed from the sky over the black forest.
He wandered around looking for Luna, but when he didn’t spot her, he went back to the main part of the library to wait. She walked in just as he started browsing the commonly used books which were kept near the front. He ran his thumb down the spine of a well worn copy of ‘Hogwarts: A History’, as she waved and came over to meet him.
In the silence, Madame Malkin says “Mr. Malfoy, turn around if you please. And stop moving! This will take all day.” Draco nods and turns to the wall. Harry leans back. “Sorry about that, sometimes I don’t think before speaking,” he says. “So there are four houses, right?” Draco nods. “Er, yeah. You get sorted into them at the beginning of the year..”
My trunk is almost all packed, but I think there’s something I’m forgetting. This has to be the most nerve-racking day of my life. The Dursleys are dropping me off tomorrow at about 10. What about you? I bet your parents didn’t laugh when you told them the train was at Platform 9 ¾ like Uncle Vernon did. It felt as though the whole house was shaking with the force of his laugh.
Potter ambled down the corridor towards him, swaying slightly. Draco took in his dark ripped jeans, thick leather boots, Motörhead t-shirt, and smudged black eye makeup. His mouth went dry.
He continued chatting while they unpacked, and Draco began to pick up little things about Finch-Fletchley’s life. He had brothers, his father worked in muggle government, he owned and rode horses, and he preferred to summer in Italy. Draco found he didn’t need to contribute much to the conversation, for which he was grateful.
Hello! I’m Ky, the author of |Just Like Magic|. Anyhow, I’m thinking of having a sort of Q&A soon. You can ask me questions about the characters, story, or even some things about me! Maybe to celebrate 10 chapters? Let me know what you think about that and we’ll see what happens ;) Thank you again, and see you all in the next chapter! ~Ky )
Exploring zaps a lot of energy from a boy. As they gorge themselves on Fish 'n Chips, Harry and Draco talk about the wizarding world. Hagrid appears to take Harry back to the Dursley's. The boys agree to owl each other over the rest of the summer.
Still frustrated, the pale-faced boy stomped until he was right in front of the wall. He turned to his parents and was surprised to not find them behind him but standing adjacent to the wall. “Aren't you coming with me to the platform?” Draco asked, trying to keep the nervousness out of his voice. His father shook his head so his blond ponytail swung back and forth. “Son, we have early appointments and your mother would like to get more sleep.” he patted Dracos shoulder in what he believed was a fatherly gesture. “Good luck this year, Crabb and Goyle’s sons are expecting you to meet them on the train.” Draco could hardly conceal the disgust on his face, what his father meant was that those boys would watch him and report back to Mr. Malfoy if his son did anything wrong. Still scowling, Draco let his mother kiss his cheek and then watched as Dobby apparated away with a pop, and Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy walked away into the crowd and disappeared from view. Draco clenched his fist angrily and discovered the paper still there. He shoves it deep into a pocket before walking through the wall.
The drawing is amazing, as you can expect from the great Draco Malfoy. Have you shown your parents yet? I have a feeling they will think they are as bloody brilliant as I think they are. Did you enjoy my horrible drawing of Hedwig? She would not stay still enough for me to get a good angle. Of course, that’s just my excuse if anyone asks why it’s so badly drawn.
Harry repeats the platform number to the man. This time the ticket man just shakes his head. “If this is a joke, it’s not a funny one boy. Tell me the truth this time.” Harry was about to say the platform number again when a woman’s voice shrieked from behind him. “Fred! George! Stop that this instant!” Harry turned to find a group of redheads marching past, trying to catch up with two red-haired boys running ahead at breakneck speed.
Harry stifled a laugh. “Hello sir, can I have a cart for my trunk and directions to a platform?” he asks. After another yawn, the man nods and rubs his eyes blearily. “Yes, I suppose so. The carts are by the entrance-” Harry blushes slightly, embarrassed of not seeing the carts earlier. “-And what platform would you be going to?” The man continued.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Not really, you just need to learn everything I was taught when I was five.” Harry stares at Draco for a second before laughing again. Draco frowns, not thinking what he said was even remotely funny. Hagrid laughed awkwardly. “Well, anyways ‘Arry, we need ter be off. Lots more ter buy.” Harry nodded and stood, gathering his bags. Draco got up as well, leaving a few galleons on the table. “Goodbye Draco, guess I’ll see you on the Express?” Harry asks, barely concealing the hope in his voice. Draco allowed himself a small nod, “Yes. Goodbye.” he says stiffly. The black-haired boy turns to go follow the large gatekeeper.
Harry raises his eyebrows, What are those words. I’ve more or less been living on a rock for the past week” he laughs. “And under stairs the rest of my life!” Draco stares at this crazy-haired, bespectacled, boy in complete shock.
“Harry, you can’t be that surprised by magic every time you see it,” he says. Then Ron pushes his cart towards the wall, calling back “Come on, I’ll go first through the wall to show you how it’s done.” Harry shakes himself, knowing Ron was right and pushes the cart beside his new friend. “Sorry about that Ron, I’m kind of new to this whole thing,” Harry says sheepishly. Ron shrugs, “Don’t trouble yourself mate. Now, watch me.” With that, Ron confidently strode into the wall.
I know your probably asleep by now, sorry for the late response. My parents were hosting a party, and of course, I had to be there. Not sure why, there were no other kids my age, just old friends of my dad.
Well hello there. I’m back with another pretty long chapter. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay! I wanted to thank everyone for reading Just Like Magic and being patient while waiting for this chapter. Now, on with the show, or uh reading? Eh, you know what I mean. ~ky
Most students were already on the train. Boys and girls leaned out of windows, waving wildly and calling to relations. All this made the platform very loud indeed. The twins, Ron, and Harry pushed through the crowd, arriving at the other half of the group just as little Ginny was complaining.
The sound of Madam Malkin’s pins coupled with the overall silence in the shop was making Harry sleepy. When the bell rang, Harry jumped at the sound. Madam Malkin stabbed his shoulder with a sharp pin. “Ouch!” he yells. He looks up to see Draco standing in front of him. “Oh, hey Draco. So you’ve decided to stay?” Draco nods. “There’s nothing better to do.”
Draco goes to stand in front of him. “I guess you’re next then. I’ll be going then…” Harry stands. “Wait, can you stay? You don’t have to, but you seem to know loads of things so maybe-” he stops rambling abruptly at Draco’s look. “Me, help you?” Draco says. “Why should I?” Harry smiles. “Because I don’t know a thing about anything magic and you probably know loads.” He says, trying to butter Draco up. “Aaand, you seem like a good person.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “Hmmm…. I’ll think about it,” he says and walks toward the door. Harry goes to Madam Malkin. “I’m ready for my fitting Madam.”
Luna beamed at Draco, waving happily before bouncing off through the maze of shelves, Patil following slowly behind her.
Potter flushed, looking down at his hands on the table, and Draco regretted saying anything when he saw the dejected look on his face. They were silent again.
Potter stared Howard down coolly. Draco had expected him to protest the accusation, but Potter didn’t seem to care if people thought that about them. Draco wasn’t sure if he should be offended or not.
At first it was his fame. Draco had grown up hearing the story of how Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord. That every witch and wizard knew his name. That he was a hero. As a small boy, Draco had gone on adventures with his imaginary best friend Harry Potter.
“She’s mixing it up this time, he’s some rich muggle so he’s no idea who she is. She wants his penthouse in Manhattan. She doesn’t have any property in America yet.”
“We need more drinks!” Draco announced loudly, surprising himself, “Blaise? I need your help again.”
Draco was very sure that Finch-Fletchley was not happy to see him. He’d heard that the muggle born boy had been forced to flee the country last year to avoid being arrested.
“If you think you’re going to get out of telling me how you ended up being blasted down a flight of stairs today, you’re loonier than everyone says I am.”
Justin was over by the record player talking to Sally-Anne Perks, when Potter went over and slung an arm around the smaller boys shoulders, pulling him away from his conversation and over to the stack of records. They seemed to be arguing about music choices. Justin never talked about Potter, and Draco had no idea if anything had happened beyond their train hook up.
Draco sank down onto the floor by the low window, mirroring her pose and resting his chin on his fist, with his elbow on the seat.
“McGonagall said we could, he’s not breaking any rules by leaving,” Theo said, scratching his nose absently. “He twitchier than I remember, he doesn’t like sitting still you know... but it’s really up to him if he wants to skip classes. I still think he’ll do OK with the NEWTs. The little time he spends in our room, he’s always reading.”
The sound Potter made when he tried a spoonful went to the top of the list of Draco’s favourite things. Potter didn’t seem aware of anyone else in the room as he inhaled half the bowl, and then looked up a little guiltily as though remembering that Draco was there.
They walked into the Hall and up to the eighth year table side by side. Several students turned to stare at them in confusion. When they reached the table, Granger nodded at him and went to sit next to Weasley, who was staring at her incredulously. Draco dithered for a second before going to sit with Justin and his friend Hannah Abbott.
As soon as Potter’s weight left Howard’s chest, he reared up, and kicked out. His foot caught Draco, who let go of Potter and went tumbling to the floor. His hand came down on a big shard of glass, which sliced his palm and he hissed in pain. Before he could move, his vision burst with stars and his head exploded in agony. Howard had struggled to his feet, his nose bloody and broken, and kicked Draco in the side of the head, sending him rolling across the floor.
All jokes aside, the drawing is good. It holds the highest honor of being framed on the wall in my bedroom, next to the self-portrait that you sent last week. So now you want to know about the ghosts? When I asked my father, he said that there are house ghosts and even a ghost professor. Although he didn’t go into much detail, my father let slip that there’s a ghost girl in a dungeon girls’ bathroom. Her name is Moaning Gertal? Cercle? Myrtle? Something like that.
Harry smiles, grateful that even though his only acquaintance was grumpy, he actually knew someone who could help him. “Sit, my fitting may take less than yours though.” Draco takes a seat and stares at Harry pointedly. “What do you want to know?” he says. Harry thinks for a moment. “What’s Quidditch? I heard some wizards talking about it on the way here. Is it food?” Draco almost laughs at the absurdity, “No, it’s a sport Harry. A really popular one at that.” It takes a while for Draco to explain everything he needed to know about Quidditch, but Harry eventually got it.
Are you nervous about school too? I’m guessing that because you’ve been asking an awful amount of questions about Hogwarts lately.
It was no easy matter for Draco to get on the Hogwarts Express. Most students were already on the train and waving through the windows at their relatives who stood blocking any entrances. After shoving his trunk onto a small portly wizard dressed in red, Draco pushed his way through parents and grandparents until he finally entered a train car near the end of the lineup. This car was bustling with students of all ages talking and laughing with each other. Draco squeezed between two young witches excitedly talking about all the classes they wanted to take, and his mind wandered to other things besides school. Like if Harry had made it on the train or if his stupid muggle relatives had even bothered to drop him off, and how he needed to remember to keep very personal things hidden away from annoying house-elves.
Anyways thank you again for being patient and hopefully not giving up on me. I've made a new schedule to get chapters done faster. I can't make any promises but I want chapter 8 to be done in like 3-4 weeks.
With one more push, Fred and George hefted Harry’s trunk inside the train’s storage car. Both twins smiled, relieved.  “That’s the last one of ours,” George said and wiped his sweating forehead with an already soaked shirt. “I can’t believe we had to lift five trunks all by our lonesome.” Fred smiled and then gasped. “Oh no, next year we’ll have to do six! With Ginny coming along.” The boys sighed wearily in perfect sync.
“Well, that’s alright, we’ll just show him.” Harry looks at the youngest boy. He had been deadly quiet this whole time until now. Mrs. Weasley nods. “Of course, thank you, Ronald.” She ruffles her son's hair. “You can go with Harry then!” Ron pushes her hands off his head. “Yes mum,” he mutters.
Hedwig hooted from the cage he was holding, stirring Harry out of his thoughts. He dragged his trunk to the Information desk. The man behind the glass seemed to be asleep, leaning against the wall, spittle drooling from his open mouth. “Excuse me, sir? Sir!” The man’s eyes blink open. He yawns hugely. “Wh- what? Pardon?”
If my parents don’t forget about me and sleep in tomorrow then I should be at Platform 9 ¾ by 10:45 am on the dot. We Malfoys strive to be fashionably late you know.
Next were Fred and Mrs. Weasley with Ginny in tow. The little girl giggled as she went through. Ron sighed and turned back to Harry, who was still gaping open-mouthed. “Harry, it’s our turn,” Ron says. The black-haired boy doesn't stop staring at the wall. A punch to his shoulder solves that. “Ouch!” Harry says, rubbing his sore appendage. “What did you do that for?” Ron laughs loudly.
In the event I am very late, try to save us a train car on the Express, will you? They get filled up quickly. See you there.
“Oh really?” The pale boy drawls, breaking the tense silence. “And who are you? Defender of the stupid I reckon.” Harry clenches his hands. “I’m Harry, for your information.” Ferret Face smiled. “Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. Nice to meet you.” Draco waited for a reaction, but Harry just stared blankly at him. Ignorant fool! He thinks.
Draco sat back down, twisting his hands in his lap. This was harder to say than he’d thought. Granger remained on her feet, stood a little away from him, her arms crossed over her chest.
Blaise had gone from a casual acquaintance to one of his closest friends through those shopping trips. Pansy had been terribly jealous when she’d found out, but when she came back from France at the end of the summer, she bought him Parisian couture and he knew he was forgiven.
As Pansy shoved him up the step onto the train, Draco glanced back again. Potter was in the same spot, and Draco briefly wondered why he was stood alone. Surely Granger and Weasley were returning to Hogwarts as well.
His fears were unjustified however. When they looked around the Hall they saw that a fifth smaller table had been added at the front of the room near the staff table. It was already occupied by a number of their eighth year classmates. Draco felt the hostile gazes of the rest of the students, that he had avoided the night before, as he walked with Finch-Fletchley and MacMillan to the table.
They carried on staring at him with identical confused expressions. He reached his hand up to comb through his hair nervously, when he realised he was sitting here with his hair still done in tiny plaits. They must think him a lunatic.
He did care now. He didn’t want Potter’s hatred anymore, but as he was discovering, without the hatred there was nothing.
He slid an arm around her to steady her. When Pansy was drunk, she lost all ability to control her volume, or her limbs.
Draco thought he might be blushing and tilted his head forwards so his hair swung forwards a little. Merlin, he was repressed if he was getting worked up about touching Potter’s feet.
Potter was grumbling to himself as Draco pulled back his blankets, and forced Potter to sit on the edge of the bed. He picked up one of the discarded mugs, vanished the contents, and cast a quick scouring charm over it, before filling it with water from his wand. He pushed the mug into Potter’s hands, and crouched down to take off his boots.
“Pandora Lovegood was once Pandora Malfoy,” he elaborated. “My father’s older sister and life long free spirit. Disowned, never spoken of again blah blah blah etc.”
“What happened anyway?” Draco asked boldly. Those three cocktails might have been stronger than he thought.
Using the wall and Lovegood for support, Draco got up on his right leg, keeping his weight off his left side.
They were still giggling together when Blaise returned just in time for them to depart from the train.
“Do you really think I would do that to you?” she asked gently, reaching out to grasp his arm tightly.
Later, up in his room, Draco hummed along to the now familiar voices of the Spice Girls. He’d learned all their names, and nearly all the words to ‘Viva Forever'. Justin had disappeared to the bathroom, so Draco quickly got changed. His skin was looking better already with the ointment Madam Pomfrey had given him, but still might raise questions.
“No, definitely not. He only said he wanted to take me out to apologise for last Friday? Which I said was completely unnecessary.”
He wrapped an arm around her, and held out the other arm for Justin, who still looked on edge. Justin jumped up on the bed and twisted against Draco’s side.
“Never mind your questions Miss Weasley. Mr Malfoy needs medical attention,” the Matron interjected, for which Draco was immediately relieved.
He needed to find Pansy, so she could confirm his presence at the party, before he could enact his plan and sneak off early.
Silently Potter stalked towards him. Draco just watched him and didn’t move a muscle. He came to stand beside Draco, staring into the flames, took a long last pull on his cigarette, and flicked the butt into the fire. He glanced down at Draco then, and reached out to tug softly on one of Draco’s plaits, a small smile twitching at the corners of his mouth. Then he walked away without a word, up the stairs to the dorms. Draco stayed frozen in place for a long while, until the fire magically dimmed and the common room was flooded with late summer sunlight.
Draco felt stunned. He’d never registered that magical ability would be an abnormality for muggleborns. His father had always raged about how muggleborns were diluting magical bloodlines, and ruining proper wizarding society. He’d never thought about the potential life which was taken away from a muggleborn when they found out who they really were. Everything they thought they would have in their future, everything their parents had hoped for them, all gone. Would Justin have preferred to live the life which had been expected of him, if he could choose?
After twenty minutes with his eyes screwed shut, he sat up angrily. He wasn’t going back to sleep, and all he was doing was worrying about what was going to happen today. He still refused to get up, and instead pulled a thick volume from his bookshelf. He’d been meaning to do some in-depth research into the properties of gingko.
“You could do essays in bed. You have enough books up here in your mini library,” Justin smirked, glancing over at Draco’s overflowing bookshelves.
“That’s preposterous. Justin doesn’t like me. He’s the one that broke up with me!” he said indignantly.
She left, and he stayed lying down quietly, staring up at the ceiling. The calming draught had made him a little drowsy.
The three of them made it up to the forth floor in a clump. Draco was really starting to hurt, and not just from his leg.
“No no no no no yes, I’m very gay, I just mean hypothetically if kissing was a thing we would do, would you be ashamed of me?” Pansy seemed angry that he wasn’t following her drunk logic.
“I can’t just stop, it won’t be enough! I’ve done too much damage. The rumours are everywhere. People will just keep talking, even if I take a public vow of chastity. The only way to clear up all this mess is to point the gossip at something else, get them talking about something better,” he muttered sullenly, “Like a steady relationship... Just until the end of the school year.”
She was wearing a short sleeveless teal dress, with orange tights and silver trainers, and at least 6 different necklaces, one of which appeared to be made of butterbeer bottle caps. Her hair was pulled to the side into a fishtail plait that he was enormously jealous of. She had threaded strands of silver through it. She smiled at him gently. At her side, Girl Weasley stood scowling up at him. She had worn baggy cargo trousers, tucked into combat boots, and a tight black crop top under an open grey plaid shirt, displaying her impressively defined stomach.
Hermione had decided that it was best if he and Potter had a lunch date. He’d argued that it should just be coffee. Apparently that was unacceptable to Potter because there was only one tea and coffee shop in Hogsmeade, and Potter had an unexplained disgust for the place.
“Would you like me to order for you? I’ve been here before and I’m sure I can pick out something you’ll like,” he asked sweetly.
He didn’t know why, but he really didn’t want to tell anyone about what happened. It would just be his word against Boot's anyway, and no one would want to believe him. Besides, a small twisted voice in his head was whispering “you deserve this”.
Before kicking off this weeks chapter I’d like to say thank you for all the comments I’ve had so far, you’re all lovely and it’s really spurred me on in writing this fic. I’ve never had the confidence to share anything I’ve written before, so thanks guys!
He grabbed his pyjamas and wash bag, heading out for the bathroom to get cleaned up. It was so late already, but he couldn’t get into a clean bed while he was still filthy from the train. In the shower he leaned against the cold tiles and let the water wash over him while he breathed deeply. This was his first moment completely alone all day, and his thoughts were still buzzing around his head like angry bees. Mostly he thought about how he didn’t deserve to be here.
He left the pub with Beckett and McDonald, and fell in step with Potter as they followed the Professor’s up the dark Hogsmead street.
“Why on earth didn’t you silence your curtains?” Pansy sighed. She and Draco knew how much Blaise valued “beauty sleep".
He worried that it made him selfish, willingly leaving his mother alone, but she hadn’t given him any indication that she even wanted him around anymore. He’d rather spend his Christmas alone at school, than to return to that house full of nightmares.
He got out of the shower, dried himself with magic, and pulled on his pale grey pyjama bottoms and black t-shirt. He was officially beyond exhausted.
“It’s definitely an effective way to get to know people. I had no idea about Lisa and Fred, that was jolly bonkers,” Justin continued, sniffing a little, his curls flattening as he pulled his blanket over his head.
“Honestly,” he lied, “I was on my way to my room and a spell hit me from behind. I woke up in bed. It could have been anyone.”
Draco stared at him, before turning on his heel and walking tiredly back into his room. He climbed back onto his bed and sat cross-legged in the middle of the mattress. Potter stood uncertainly in the doorway, before following Draco inside. He glanced around the room with interest, quirking a small smile at Justin’s posters.
Hermione went to speak to Professor McDonald in a hushed voice, and then moved to Potter’s side. A few men from the pub went wordlessly to restrain Howard, and McDonald flicked her wand, releasing the spell.
It was almost dinnertime when they started to pack up, and Draco had a sudden panicky burst of courage to do something he’d been wanting to do.
The last picture Luna showed him was the oldest, and he stared at it in awe. In it, Pandora was younger than either Draco or Luna, maybe 13 or 14. Draco realised she was in the rose garden at Malfoy Manor,  and with her in the photo was a very small boy who was beaming and hugging her legs. His father. Draco had never seen a picture of his father as such a small child. He looked happy as he waved his small fists up at his sister, who laughed. Draco felt a well of sadness in his chest, thinking about the life that was ahead of this joyful child. How he would be shaped and cut down to fulfil a hollow legacy, just as Draco had.
“You’ll find the entrance in the Long Gallery, behind a tapestry of Carpathe taming a phoenix.” She smiled slightly, “the password is Unity.”
“Tonight isn’t a night for spilling secrets,” he said mischievously, “tonight is a night for making new ones.”
“Would you all please gather at the Gryffindor table?” McGonagall asked as she stepped down from the dais the staff table was raised on.
“And you thought this year wasn’t going to be any fun.” He forced out a laugh, hiding his face by looking through his bag for a book. Any book.
“You’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plan with Harry then. Keep an eye on him for me, will you?”
Beyond the crowds at King’s Cross Station, through the magical barrier between platforms 9 and 10, the gleaming scarlet steam engine stood waiting, bathing platform 9 ¾ in white smoke.
For Salazar’s sake, he’d actually agreed to out himself to the wizarding world... and his mother... just to help Harry Potter get a job.
Potter stumbled forwards, the momentum of his last movements bringing him to his knees as he tried to stop himself. He was panting, his hands clenched in fists against the floor. Hermione crouched down next to him, speaking softly, and after a second he looked up to meet her eyes. The anger left him, and suddenly he was just a frightened boy. His eyes darted around, like a cornered animal, and finally rested on Draco.
“I’m not asking for your forgiveness Granger. Honestly I don’t deserve it. I just wanted you to know that I was sorry. That’s all.”
It wasn’t long before the peace was disrupted when Blaise came rushing back into the carriage. There was a familiar gleam in his dark eyes. He had gossip.
He sounded wrecked. When he looked up, Draco was looking into the face of a man who was lost. His heart constricted in his chest. It took all his self control to stay put and not rush across the room to gather Potter in his arms.
Blaise turned the newspaper towards them silently. There, on the front page, was a headline: Sexcapades of the Saviour
Potter sprang back at the two other boys. His expression was furious. He grabbed at the front of one of their shirts, pulling the boy forwards, off balance, and then driving his other fist into their face. Draco winced in sympathy, but then he felt a cold rush down his spine. He recognised those two. They were the boys who were with the Gryffindor who had knocked him down the stairs.
“Your father had a secret sister?” Blaise asked, amazed. “How did we never know this? No one can keep secrets in pure blood society.”
There was a heavy silence. Draco didn’t think it was any of his business, so he wasn’t going to press the issue.
Draco realised just how tall Lovegood was for a girl. With her silver grey eyes, platinum hair and fine bone structure, they almost looked like twins. They were both looking down at the redhead, who was looking sweaty in quiddich robes. He spotted the gleaming silver Captain’s badge twinkling on her chest.
Weasley made an aborted noise of protest. Granger had put her hand on his leg. He sat back looking petulant.
Draco snorted. He was unsure why Potter had started this, but he was certain that it wasn’t because he liked him. He would find out why. That was the main reason he’d agreed to go today.
I spoke in defence of Malfoy at his trial, and he was cleared. Are you doubting my word Terry? The only reason we were in a war was because of this bullshit ‘us and them' mentality. If we keep looking at everything as black and white, then how are we any better than Voldemort?”
“In this made up hypothetical situation that will never happen, of course not baby,” Blaise said, still looking confused.
“I...” he started, before continuing in a rush, “I just wanted to say that I’m aware my family has caused you rather a lot of turmoil, and I’m sorry. As for me personally, I know that my behaviour in the past has been... abhorrent to say the least, especially towards you. I won’t make any excuses for myself, I can’t justify my actions, all I can say is I’m sorry... and I have a lot of regrets. I’m trying to be better.”
“I’m not really an expert. I think as long as you’re publicly hanging out a lot, that should be enough. Maybe some light PDA, but nothing you’re uncomfortable with? I bet you’ve been overthinking it,” she said softly.
“I know you don’t believe he’s changed, but I know he has. His aura is changing,” said Lovegood simply, as though it was obvious. Draco shifted uncomfortably. Were they talking about him or somebody else?
“If anyone needs to Spice up their life it’s you Malfoy! The Spice Girls are positively a sensation. I have both of their albums.”
Weirdly, Potter relaxed just a little. Draco hadn’t expected to have any impact on him, but his taut frame loosened, and his breathing slowed. His eyes darted towards Draco, taking in his panicked face, and his expression became serious.
I’m sure you’re all anxious to get a good nights sleep ready for your classes tomorrow. You are all free to go, except Eighth years? Could you please remain in your seats for a moment longer. I wish to speak to you further.”
He punched Draco hard in the stomach, and Draco couldn’t even fold into the pain so the air was just forced out of his lungs in a gasp. He couldn’t get any more back in and he wheezed. He couldn’t believe he had let his guard down just because he felt comfortable being back at school. Of course he was still in danger here. As he got some air back in shallow pants, he waited for Boot to make his point and stared him down calmly.
“Ah well, they probably do, they just don’t care,” he corrected, “how are you feeling after finding out your long term ex boyfriend is a raging homosexual?”
He checked the time. It was nearly noon, so he curled up in a chair near the fire to wait for Potter.
“Well I wish you wouldn’t. There are plenty of things I’m sure you need to atone for Draco, but I don’t count that as one of them,” she said matter-of-factly.
Then he remembered the comments that had been made about Potter in the Daily Prophet, and in the Headmistress’s office last week. Potter relaxed slightly at his response. He bit his lip as his eyes moved from the wine list and away, around the restaurant.
Draco sprang out of his seat and dragged her along with him, pulling her away from the now much busier common room and into the deserted stairwell.
“Lavender Brown? Badass face scars? Squeaky voice? Practically magically bonded to your sister at the hip? That Lavender,” he said, sitting up on the bed, still grinning broadly.
There was absolute silence in the Hall. Students and teachers bowed their heads respectfully, and Draco tried very hard not to think. Not to think about his father in Azkaban, not to think about his mother all alone, not to think about Vince being swallowed by flames. After a few minutes McGonagall looked up with a sad smile and cleared her throat.
“You’ve been in the wars Mr Malfoy. Would you like me to send for the Headmistress?” she asked gently.
“Well... they’re conservative so they aren’t thrilled, but they want me to be happy. It does help that I have three older brothers who seem more than willing to carry on the family name. My eldest brother Jeremy will be the future Lord Framlingham, and take Father’s seat in the House of Lords. It’s his children that will carry that on.
“Oh yes, let’s celebrate,” Draco snipped, “Let’s celebrate that we’re not one of the 6 kids from our year who died.”
At twelve fifty-five he went inside, mainly because he was cold. He’d gotten a table for two, and settled in to wait for Potter.
He deflated instantly, the annoyance bleeding out as fast as it came. He sat down heavily in an armchair and covered his face with his hands.
Brown gave a sudden shriek of joy when the song changed and the music got louder. She grabbed Patil and starting to dance aggressively. Pansy laughed and joined in, dragging Draco with her. Neither of them had any clue what was so particular about this song, but the beat was intoxicating and Draco was dancing before he even realised. Other people crowed into the space that had been cleared in the common room to join in, and Draco was quickly sandwiched between Pansy and Blaise, laughing and letting the music wash through him. The song changed but they kept dancing. Draco twirled Pansy around to a song about ‘common people’, and ‘saw the sign’ with Justin bopping around him.
“Justin! It’s so good to see you.” Blaise exclaimed as though he’d just noticed his existence, which honestly was probably true.
“I... um... I... I was looking for... my sister?” she stuttered weakly, seemingly unable to tear her gaze away.
The weather was hot, and the sky was blindingly clear on September 1st. In the not so distant past, this hopeful day of new beginnings had seemed like a pipe dream. The wizarding world was at peace, evil had been vanquished, and Hogwarts had been rebuilt to welcome it’s students back for a new school year.
While Draco was engaged with the others, out of the corner of his eye, he was watching Hermione and Potter. They were talking together, and Potter was smirking with pleased amusement while Hermione laughed at something he had said.
“It doesn’t matter what he said. By now you should have the emotional maturity to rise above what other people say,” McGonagall rebuked him.
She was in the navy dress. She was drunk. Her usually impeccable red lipstick was smeared across her cheek.
When Draco had tried to avoid busy corridors, where the worst of the unidentifiable long distance attacks occurred, he realised he was left exposed to other types of attack. Ambush attempts became a common part of his day to day, and while he became quite adept at outsmarting the roaming groups of vengeance seekers, he wasn’t always successful.
Upon arriving in the common room Draco wasn’t really sure what to do so he tried to look like he was supposed to be there, and watched the groups forming around him.
It was almost noon by the time Pansy appeared. Sleep was Pansy’s favourite pass time, and weekend lie-ins were practically sacred to her. She was immaculately put together as always in a chic little day dress, but her eyes were heavy and she was yawning as she came to find him. She draped herself over the back of his chair like an overindulged house cat.
Potter was mostly quiet, just chatting to Luna and Hermione, and helping Blaise to polish off the tray of shots. He spun the small empty glasses on the table top absently.
“More than likely. Blaise is always pretty strict about taking advantage of loose inhibitions. He thrives on other people’s secrets... and he’s been trying to get into Turpin’s pants, so Truth or Dare is probably on the cards.”
“Is Hermione weeping over Harry’s delinquent behaviour again?” she asked, so softly it was almost inaudible.
Draco tensed instinctively, but Potter smiled at him. It wasn’t the loose grin that he had seen on Potter's face before, or the smirk he had sometimes thrown Draco’s way. This smile was heated, wolfish, and to Draco’s horror he felt his face flush of its own accord. Potter, slowly and deliberately, winked at him.
He was almost ready when Finch-Fletchley bounded back into the room fully dressed, his curls pulled back from his face with a row of small sparkling clips.
“I wanted to,” he said softly, “I wanted to hide in the dungeons and pretend none of you even existed, but that’s not how things are turning out. People keep surprising me. I really like Justin, and Luna actually wants to be my family. I’ve spent my whole life trying to be something I’m not. Now I... well now I want to see who I can be without my father treating me like a fucking trained poodle.”
Blaise turned on Finch-Fletchley, his eyes like melted dark chocolate, and Finch-Fletchley looked hopelessly between him and Draco.
Potter flicked the butt of his cigarette onto the floor and looked up, his eyes locking suddenly on Draco’s. In his surprise, Draco maintained the eye contact, and in that moment Potter's carefully blank face flashed to an expression that Draco knew well. Challenge.
“It won’t be weird, you should come! Go out, get some drinks. I bet Blaise will come, and Justin, you like Justin,” he said quickly, attempting to distract her.
That was when two Officers of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol arrived. Draco wondered how they had gotten here so fast, before he remembered that Beckett was an ex Auror. He probably had a way to call his buddies in the department. Draco shrank back against Pansy. Understanding flared in her eyes and she looked around for an escape route.
When they reached the Hall Draco found himself shrinking a little as the dread crept back in. He hadn’t thought this through. Would he be sitting at the Hufflepuff table? There were definitely worse Houses to approach, but even so.
“It’s never too late. You three are bonded tighter than family. I know we can find a way to bring him back. He just needs help,” Luna replied soothingly.
Weasley and Draco both stared at her in surprise. Weasley turned to look back at Draco with renewed interest.
Draco gave a small indignant squawk as she began towing him forcefully towards the nearest carriage door. Although she would never admit it, Draco knew Pansy was just as apprehensive and anxious about returning to Hogwarts as he was.
