So. So far, the only emotion Harry can see being even a
Then, Harry's hands are on his face and they're kissing
He doesn't think it's hatred. No, Harry and Draco are on good terms now- they've both done the other a huge service. Draco threw Harry a wand in the battle of Hogwarts so he could stand a chance against Voldemort, and Harry spoke at Draco's Death Eater trial, practically saving him from a life in Azkaban. So this feeling can't be stemming from loathing.
. Their mouths glide perfectly together, as though they were made to unite and Harry doesn't think he's ever been so elated in his entire life.
Harry shudders, choking a bit on the toast he's eating. Hermione shoots him a puzzled look.
Harry likes that very much- how Draco no longer calls him 'Potter' with a spit (unless he's mocking him, but it's all in good fun). He stands, slightly taller than Harry, but much more slender. He’s all soft lines and crisp edges, neat and tidy and precise, while Harry’s more hard and toned. Draco blinks heavily, obviously tired and drained from sitting in the cold. Harry grins at him crookedly and decides to spark small talk before making his grand statement.
Everyone knows the story of the Malfoy family. How Draco’s father, Lucius was a Death Eater, and his mother, Narcissa, a valiant supporter. The Daily Prophet had a ball on ‘Malfoys Forced Only Son to Become Death Eater to Carry Out Ancestral History,’ after the war in which You-Know-Who was defeated. All three were pardoned in court due to their defection from the Death Eater regime, but now live a life with very few allies.
It's now halfway through the year's first term and Draco's been having an especially rousing time. He is, quite predictably, the top of his potions class (even without Professor Snape's specialist assistance) and Draco has been achieving to an outstanding level in all of his subjects. The boy feels he deserves an enormous reward for his exertion and skill, so he plans to prize himself with a warm soak in the newly refurbished senior bathroom.
"I've been wondering," Potter announces after a short while of silence, "if you know of any cute boys I can get my hands on?"
is the 'cute boy' Potter is referring to, but can't allow himself to play along with this silly game. It could really hurt him and his reputation, "I can't even begin to comprehend what you're implying, Potter."
Potter starts to wade through the soapy water, towards Draco who panics and scoots along the wall a few metres further away from the approaching boy. Draco swallows his pride and stands, too, making it easier to put more distance between Potter and himself.
Since then, there's something Harry hasn't been able to push from his mind. Someone, in truth. This person who consumes his thoughts and bewitches his body to the point where every time Harry sees them he just wants to
He hears startled whispers emerge from the Gryffindors all around him, but Harry doesn't care. He virtually runs out of the great hall and down the Hogwarts corridor as he's on a new mission now, to find and confess to Draco.
just do it!"
"I'm not a particularly good flirt," Harry says and he watches Draco's eyebrows knit together, "and I know I can be a right arrogant prick sometimes."
He's so very angry that Draco bullied him and his friends all that time, and he's angry at himself for not giving it back as much as he should've. He's angry that Malfoy worked for the man who killed his parents- even if it wasn't his choice! And Harry's so, so angry that he's grown to care for him, to see him as a
Harry quirks an eyebrow and exhales deeply through his nose, "But I've just realised something massive and, being the arrogant prick I am, my pride tells me I have to inform you
it'd had at the beginning and, with Ginny constantly overseas for Quidditch... it was just too difficult. She took it well at the time, but Ron said she cried herself to sleep every night for a month. Harry did feel bad, he really did, but he'd been unhappy for a while and needed some de-stress time. After all, he had just killed Lord Voldemort.
Draco bobs up and down, right hand twisting with his head's every movement and the rhythm seems to drive Harry wild. He places a strong hand on the back of Draco's head, scratching at his scalp and murmuring small praises that are near inaudible. The utterances turn into quiet moans when Draco hollows his cheeks and dips a cheeky tongue into Harry's slit.
Potter looks alarmed as if he hadn't noticed Draco until that very moment. He smiles sarcastically, dipping one foot into the bath to check its temperature, then drops fully into the water. His gaze is fixed on Draco and, even with the bubbles climbing high above his nipples, the blond boy feels somewhat exposed. Potter shrugs, "Is it a travesty to trim one's pubic hair?"
"It's my first time," Draco says, "but I know I'll be back." Potter nods in agreement, his green eyes burning into Draco's grey ones.
Draco feels slightly deflated. Usually, Potter would put up a fight and the pair would snark back and forwards at each other until they'd used every slur in the book. He huffs a sigh and returns to his place at the Slytherin table, annoyed and dreary. So annoyed that, for no reason at all, he elbows the boy next to him in the chest.
They stay like that for a while, just kissing, tasting each other, feeling one another so passionately. Then they embrace. A soft, innocent hug which portrays so much longing, intimacy and happiness. Harry finds he loves to be in love, and he's never felt so strongly about someone before. He wishes he'd known earlier. Every minute with Draco seems priceless and he just
"I became rather adept in the field of Disillusionment Charms last year," he smiles, "that is if the water isn't an issue for you?"
"Why aren't
Draco smirks, "Is it that obvious?"
he'll never be able to let him go.
extent." He stands up straight, neck aching slightly from all the hard work it's been doing, and looks Harry in the eyes. Harry stands, too, and grinds his dick against Draco's neglected one. Despite it not being touched for the entire duration of their shenanigans, Draco's cock is painfully hard and red and dripping (and not just because he's in a bath).
Harry shakes his head, black hair falling messily into his eyes. He can’t decide how he feels about calling Draco pathetic, but he knows it felt amazing at the time (It felt even more wonderful when Professor Moody turned the grey eyed boy into a ferret). The boy has already ruled out hatred as the dominating feeling toward Draco, but not anger.
With a crease between his eyebrows, Draco hisses, "I can come up with a few reasons why
Harry laughs a bit, "I left to come find you."
He complies.
She looks up at him gently, "Yes?"
"You're not special, Potter. No one can trust themself around me," the blond boy muses and before Potter can spit back a refusal, Draco leans down and grazes his teeth along Potter's thigh. The muscle flexes, skin going taut before Potter relaxes once more. Draco finds it fascinating. He dips his head back down and bites softly, about an inch away from Potter's cock.
was the moment he realised Draco's problems and behaviour came from a desperate need to impress his father. He only needed to take one look at Lucius to figure as much.
flirting- Draco's not daft enough to miss that. He's also aware that
So why is Draco any different?
So, he knows that it was second year that he began to care for Draco (if only a tiny bit), but Harry's still no closer to working out why he's been consuming his brain for the last few months.
Draco chuckles, "You tell me, Potter. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on your grooming choices, however, I will say that mop on your head looks atrocious and you should definitely cut it."
and it feels like blissful ecstasy. Draco's lips feel ethereal on his own and this,
"Noted." The black-haired boy says whilst taking in the bathroom's wonders, "Quite the luxurious spot, isn't it? The things I could do in here."
"I have something important to tell you."
The blond boy snorts, a raucous laugh ripping through him. He presses against Harry's body and wonders if it's considered acceptable to sleep in a public bathtub.
"Not necessarily," Potter replies, stopping his movements and surveying Draco's dishevelled expression, "but I'm sure that pretty mouth of yours can do a lot more than bitch about Muggleborns."
He pulls off with a filthy, wet sound, "Isn't that kind of the whole point?"
It takes a multitude of effort for Draco to lift his heavy head and look Harry in the face. His mouth is open, harsh puffs of air rushing from the orifice and it takes all Draco has not to come at the sight.
hate Draco, and the feeling was mutual, but Harry is aware the only resentment he ever held against the blond haired boy was because of his cruel father. Regret doesn't usually feel this way, though. It's more of a settled emotion which Harry's learned to deal with. So it can't be that.
Draco. Of course he likes him. Draco's the biggest behavioural turnaround of the century, not to mention the change in his worldly views. But Harry likes Ron too. And Hermione, and Neville, Luna, Seamus, Dean. But he doesn't think about them every second of every day. He isn't worried
"I'd hope so," Draco mocks, "I know you're an asshole but I would presume not to
"What is it, Harry?" Draco takes a step closer and Harry hears the breath catch in his throat.
With blazing green eyes, Potter surges forward, hands seizing Draco with utmost desperation, and seals their lips in a bruising kiss. Draco takes a second to react as this is not a common scene for him, but he manages to wrap his arms around Potter's delicious body. They connect fantastically and Draco feels white-hot sparks whizz through him in a whirl of different sensations. Potter's lips are experienced- it wouldn't take a genius to work out as much- and the sense they bring to Draco's own is indescribably wonderful.
Harry stares at Draco with wide eyes and whispers, "Finish."
Harry's always been bold, and now is no different, "Draco, may I have a word?"
Draco looks up, smiles sweetly and waves his wand to pack his belongings away, "Of course, Harry."
The green eyed boy smiles and looks over at Ron. They both showed each other great loyalty that day, and without that, they may have drifted, for loyalty is the base of any great relationship. Platonic or more.
"Won't I just?" Potter all but growls, taking a large step forwards.
"Yeah," Harry nuzzles against Draco's neck, "I'm more of a suckee than a sucker."
Harry Potter is in love with Draco Malfoy.
Harry nods leisurely, "And I've just had a eureka moment and worked out I'm not as straight as I thought."
was 15).
Not many of his past companions have reappeared for their eighth year but Draco doesn't really mind. The only actual
Harry does need to relive those memories too, though, for third year was sort of a strange turning point for him.
Their first meeting doesn't give Harry much more insight to what that feeling for Draco is, of course, they didn't even know each other except by name. Really, in their first year at Hogwarts, Draco had been nothing more than a malicious bully. No depth to him, no saddening backstory... just a, plain and simple, nasty piece of work. First Year Draco won't really help Harry's mission to get him out of his head, so he moves onto year 2.
is the time.
Potter huffs a sardonic laugh and places a hand on the side of Draco's neck, "Well, we're about to change that."
Draco's suspicions are proved correct when he watches the boy turn around and finds a very naked, very toned Harry Potter standing before him. Now, Draco isn't usually one to react severely when faced with an attractive person, but he'd be lying if he said his cock didn't harden slightly at the sight of Potter's muscular physique. He blames his arousal on the hot water and attempts to disguise it with a perfectly impertinent remark, "I see Ginny wasn't lying about the manscaping."
Reluctantly, Draco rips away, their lips uncoupling with that telltale sound. He breathes heavily, warm air fanning over Potter's chin and Draco only just manages to say, "Here?"
Her jaw tenses, and Draco's only mildly disappointed she's not in the mood for a dispute on Wizarding blood status today. He, once more, sees the female Weasley with a hard line across her forehead. He chooses to focus on Potter, now.
Since then, Harry's tried his best not to think of Draco sexually... but every now and then, when his wank-bank is so shamefully empty, the blond haired boy does worm his way into Harry's brain.
It's now the morning of September 21st, the first day of the third week of their eighth year at Hogwarts and Harry can't seem to focus on his breakfast. Just a few minutes ago, Ron received a 'thrilling' Owl about Ginny's fourth Quidditch victory for the season and Hermione's pouring over it like it's some sort of history textbook. While she reads the letter and Ron, unsurprisingly, gazes up at her, Harry has a moment with his thoughts.
As he sips his morning pumpkin juice, Draco surveys the other students sitting in The Great Hall. He is tremendously amused when he spots a young Hufflepuff girl light Justin Finch-Fletchley's robes on fire. Justin scowls before casting 'Aguamenti' on the flames. If it were him, Draco would have used an Extinguishing Spell, but he isn't surprised Justin goes for a much... messier option. Hufflepuffs aren't known for their humongous brains.
"I'm in love with you, Draco," Harry blurts and the boy in front of him lets out a great sigh of relief.
A lot's changed since Harry and Ginny's breakup. They had to part, well, Harry thought so anyway. Their relationship was lacking that
Yes, he knows he hasn’t exactly made a huge effort to be a more approachable person... just a
"Cast 'em wandlessly as I came in." and at Draco's alarmed look, he adds, "I don't trust myself."
"Not to you," he replies quickly, noticing Ginny's scowl.
Potter's laugh rings throughout the echoey room as he hoists himself onto the edge of the bathtub. Draco thinks he looks absolutely exquisite with his soapy, wet skin, rippling muscles and that big, hard dick which stretches past his bellybutton.
Harry casts a wandless cleaning charm over the water, just in case any come wasn't filtered away. He smiles, "For the record, I never sucked any of the Weasley's dicks."
Regret slips into Harry’s mind. He deeply regrets all the times he was so unkind to Draco (no matter how much he got in return). If he'd known then that Draco was just a pressured, broken little boy, basically begging for someone to care for him, Harry would've acted much more sympathetically. He
His sincerity forces a small whimper to rise from Draco's throat, "No, Potter. I want to, just, isn't it a bit open?"
He stands up promptly and trots over to where 'The Golden Trio' (as all the cringe-worthy Third Years like to call them) are sitting. As he nears, he spies Ginny Weasel glaring daggers at Harry Potter and Draco knows he's in for a treat!
"Oh, no matter if you don't," he waves a dismissive hand, "I just thought- Who better to ask than Draco Malfoy? You do seem to be rather...
Harry screws up his face in confusion. He realises the only way to grasp the reality is by reliving his past encounters with Draco. Maybe then he'll be able to stop dwelling on him.
A peculiar mix of concern and arousal sweeps over Potter's features before he replies, "We don't have to, Malfoy. At all, I mean. If you don't want to."
Draco Malfoy.
will hate him.
one. Draco’s civil (ish) with the Gryffindorks, he no longer flicks a breaking charm at any pair of glasses he sees and he doesn’t go around slagging insults at anyone who looks vulnerable. Most of the time. He’s seen over 100 Muggleborns already this year and hasn’t once used the ‘M Word.’ If that isn’t considered personal growth (his Mind Healer’s always banging on about that awful phrase), then Draco doesn’t know what is.
Draco copies his action, throwing away every shred of control he's ever had. The pair of them are forever inching closer, "You know, I've always seen myself as a very independent person and I have no issue with getting just myself off."
Draco wonders how he's still alive today, what with all the teasing he's done in the past, as he watches Weasley sear with anger just from a tiny little poke. Unsurprisingly, Ronald hasn't got the backbone to defend himself so Granger steps in, "Do you really think you, of all people, have the right to insult someone's
because he despised Draco so much and was always trying to find a way to better him. Then... well... then third year came around and Harry became so confused. He cringes now, thinking about it, he was such an embarrassing teenager and everyone could probably see it- even Draco himself.
"Well, yes," Harry says. His brain doesn't seem to be working properly. Damn, Draco's good, "but I want you to, as well."
"Such a shame." Draco fakes a snuffle and shakes his head, "Although it's not really a surprise. What does she have? 10 brothers? You were bound to
is the feeling that's been overwhelming Harry. Love. He is so in love with the boy he's kissing. He's
In Draco’s opinion, the whole thing is bollocks. The Malfoys turned around, paid for their past transgressions and have been forgiven by the only people who really matter. If some Second Year Ravenclaw decides to shudder as Draco walks past them in the corridor, he will not hesitate to accidentally kick them in the face.
At 11:30 pm sharp that night, Draco makes his way through the school and to the bathroom. He hasn't indulged in a warm bath for far too long and he is beyond excited. Upon arrival in the lavish room, Draco immediately proceeds to the limited edition spa baths. They're specifically for the
Mr Malfoy displayed himself perfectly, portraying every bad-guy from Harry’s childhood stories, and he almost began to feel sorry for Draco. Growing up with someone as awful as Lucius in the house must've shaped Draco to be the confusing character he was.
Harry cannot stop thinking about this boy who he doesn't feel hate or grief or regret or remorse for.
Harry feels something heavy fall into place. A deep, strong realisation that resides in his gut. It hasn't just been since he left Ginny, no. He's had Malfoy on his mind for so much longer than that. For a time, it
Years and Draco feels significant gratification, as that means there is less of a chance that his relaxation will be interrupted.
feel his climax on the horizon. It's as if he's teetering on the edge of a fence and if he leans forward just the tiniest bit, he'll fall off. Draco wants to fall off, but something inside doesn't let him push that one step further.
They break apart. Draco's voice comes out in a whisper, "It's cold."
The next part doesn't matter, it was just usual bully-Draco. But, hell, if Harry's not still embarrassed by his obscene idea that Draco Malfoy was checking him out. If he thinks about it now, Harry can't stop himself from feeling sick, in fact, his stomach is twisting presently.
In the privacy of a changing stall, he strips off his evening clothes, before dashing into the ever-bubbling bath. It is a rather stupendous place, with 3 enormous hot pools and showers larger than a small car. Draco sinks into the watery depths and feels his mind instantly become clearer.
He can't ignore this section of his journey on working out what it is he feels for Malfoy, however. Harry's third year brought some unexpected (and mostly unwelcome) mental images. Malfoy under him. Malfoy on his lap. Malfoy's pink lips wrapped around his-
They hold hands as they walk through the halls, receiving shocked looks from students all around but Harry can't care less. He suspects Draco has a similar mindset as he can barely keep the skip out of his walk. They end up in the Gryffindor common room and snog each other senseless for a good 15 minutes, without a person in sight. It seems their ravishing euphoria will never end until...
That's when Draco became hyper aware of the pool of lube in his hand once again. He felt the prickle of heat rise up his neck, suffocating himself in his own embarrassment. He wasn't sure how he forgot the slick wetness against his skin when he was so fascinated by it just moments ago.
"Draco." Harry swallowed down a moan that was threatening to come out. "Draco, look at me."
Panic brewed within the depths of his stomach. He was starting to become freaked out at the thought of forgetting so easily and not being in control. What else might he forget if he—
"Go on then, get to its level." Slughorn gestured and Draco's eyes went wide as it hit him.
"'Corpus! It time for attack!" Albus devised before slipping off of Draco and reaching for the first toy he could find. Scorpius followed suit, picking up on Albus' movements quickly.
"Yeah, alright." Harry scoffed. "I'd like to see you try."
"Hey, hey, you stay there, I'll come to you." Harry jumped in, already having visions of the small boy slipping on the water that slicked the bathroom floor.
"What Papa?" Albus replied with curious eyes and gazed up at him from the floor.
"I told you, I'm just making sure you're okay." Harry answered, reaching out for the broken utensil. Before Harry could grab it, Draco threw the pieces off to the side, launching them across the back of the room.
"Harry. Oh, fuck, Harry." Draco keened, his eyes falling shut as his head rolled back on the cushion. He looked thoroughly debauched. His hair clung to his forehead in wet waves and his lips were slicked with his own spit. Harry wanted nothing more than to attack them with his own.
"Fuck." He breathed out and glanced down at Harry's hand that was dangerously close to his cock. "I'll keep my hands still, Harry. You do it. Get me off, please. Need you so bad." Draco whined and wiggled his hand out from under Harry's.
need help too." Harry joked and smiled back at Draco with a lopsided grin.
's and then float off to dream land. Why did that have to wait until the morning if that's how they both felt?
"Mr. Malfoy. You look quite dreadful. Are you running a fever?" Professor Slughorn questioned, but the boy completely ignored him.
•——————•——————•
"See my love? All you have to do is ask and I'll give you anything you need." Harry began to push up on his knees, preparing to stand up. He felt Draco's hand fall from his shirt and he watched it hit the bed.
each other without any boundaries.
For all he knows, the boy he caught feelings for could be up all night plotting his dorm mates death.
"Come for me, Draco. Right here in the middle of class with everyone around. I want you to come knowing that someone could turn around and see you fall apart under my touch. Come for me."
"My feet are not fat!" Draco breathed out an over exaggerated gasp in attempt to sound offended. This only caused Scorpius to burst out into a fit of giggles. "You know what happens when little boys are around fat feet?" Draco asked with a devious smile growing on his face.
But he understood everything now. The way he felt under Harry's fixation, the excitement he got after riling him up. He always made sure he was the center of Harry's attention.
"Now who can tell me the other potion that uses powdered root of asphodel as an ingredient?" Slughorn scanned over his students for any raised hands. Draco's head whipped toward the front of the room, remembering their current location.
"Papa, you stop that right now!" Scorpius demanded and hurled himself at the feet of his father, latching his arms and legs around Draco's firm calf.
Draco pulled it upwards so that Harry's leg was bent slightly at the knee. Harry still had no idea where he was going with this as he watched Draco scramble off of him and make his way towards Harry's feet.
This time, he couldn't swallow down the moan that ripped out of his throat. "Fuck."
"You go now. Don't do you dare touch your cock, I swear to Merlin Draco. I'll be there in five minutes. Get yourself ready for me." Harry ordered, giving Draco's cock a few more teasing strokes.
"Don't worry about it." Harry waved them off, forcing himself to smile. "Goodnight you two." He pushed himself off the cushion and lifted his heavy legs towards his friends. With one quick kiss on Hermione's cheek and a hearty pat on Ron's back, he finally made his way to his room for the night.
The first thick ribbon shot out and landed on his school robes. Draco's mouth fell wide open and his eyes screwed shut as his balls drew up once again.
"Come on then, my love. Work your magic." Harry patted his upper thigh in signal for Draco to make his way over and Draco obliged without hesitation.
him that Harry was in that building. He had no cogitation of what they assigned him to. He obviously wasn't filling out paper work because that's what Harry did
His hold on Harry's erection faltered and his vision faded to black for a few moments, his brain short circuiting after the intensity of his orgasm.
He mentally prepared himself for the blow as well as he could. He could already picture Slughorn's face of pure disgust looking back down at him as he pulled his strong fist off of his prick.
"You not a princess, Papa!" Scorpius informed him, like he didn't know that already.
His silver eyes locked with Draco's, but he remained muted. After a few moments, he dropped onto his hands and knees, the only sound in the room was from Scorpius' skin coming into contact with the porcelain tiles. The eye contact was broken now, but Draco's eyes were still burning onto the blonde curls bouncing atop his head.
Draco's hand didn't move to stroke up Harry's shaft. It just sat atop the slick skin with a firm grip. The burn Harry felt under his skin was absolutely devine.
"Do you think the
" Harry continued.
It was always an odd sight to see, Scorpius with his hair slicked back. He looked uncannily like Draco when he was his age and the image always sent shivers up his spine.
With a pair of Harry's swim trunks on (because he couldn't find his own, of course. Not because he just wanted to wear Harry's), he shamefully trudged back into the ensuite with his head hung low. He ordered his boys to wait on the floor while he went to change. He's aware of the fact they they're old enough to be in the water while he steps out for a moment, but it still freaks him out nonetheless.
Harry believed that Scorpius looked adorable like that, though. It was only for the shear fact that he did resemble Draco.
"Gods gift to the world, right?" Harry teased, noticing Draco's glazed over stare on his hand. "Come on then, show me how a pretty boy like you would put it to good use." Harry's words danced off the tip of his tongue and they affected Draco immediately, sending him into a flurry of soft whines.
He desperately tried to compose himself. His tie was loose, his buttons were in the wrong holes, and parchment threatened to escape out of his satchel. His nimble fingers worked at correcting every error pertaining to his appearance so that he could look presentable when he stepped into class.
Harry's eyes scanned every feature on Draco's face and his smile grew larger by the second. Draco couldn't help but grin back at the man and his heart fluttered like he was a bloody sixteen year old with a school crush.
To say that Draco was embarrassed would be an understatement. He was
"Never mind, you're too far gone to understand, I'm afraid." Harry smiled back at the boy and he found himself wanting to kiss those pouty lips once more.
Draco clambered on top of Harry, hovering over his muscular legs. He seized the denim fabric of his trousers in his fists and avidly yanked them down towards his calves. Harry's black pants followed suit.
They were both Captains on a ship that had no end destination. If one of them fell out of line for even a second, the ship would crumble beneath their feet and sink to the bottom of the sea, never to return again. Somehow their ship was still sailing and they've gained new crew members along the way that made it easier to for them to stay afloat.
"So is this what you get up to every night when I get back from the common room?" Harry casually asked, pretending to take interest in the pieces of parchment lying on top of Draco's desk. He ran his fingers over the smooth wood of the chair, waiting for a reply.
Draco's hand flailed under the table, searching for anything he could grab onto to ground himself. He latched onto Harry's thigh, gripping the fabric tightly as he struggled to keep his squirming body still.
It was then when Draco fully registered Harry's state. His prick was fully out and settled in his hand, watching Draco like he was a valuable art piece hung up at The Louvre.
this, so he was going to let himself have it.
"I'll quickly go over this next ingredient as we are drawing near the end of our lesson."
"Papa almost hurted her! He going to squish her with his fat feet!" Albus exclaimed whilst dramatically laying down on his back and holding Iggy up above his face. "I save Iggy from fat Papa feet!"
"I can see that." Draco stifled a laugh and glanced down at the few legos sticking out of the middle of the tower. Or should he say
He took a few careful steps in Draco's direction, making sure he stayed upright. His swollen member was in Draco's direct line of sight, positioned half a foot in front of his debauched expression.
Harry seized his quill in his hand once again and dipped it into the ink pot before letting it dance about the page in front of him. Draco eyed him, completely gobsmacked and still fully aroused.
Harry's promising words floated through the air and grabbed at Draco's beating heart, closing around it in a warm embrace. It was all he needed to hear to know exactly how Harry felt.
Like he said,
sitting in the bubble bath all by himself surrounded by children's toys.
"But could you?" Harry cut him off, unhappy with the answer he was being given.
Draco wanted to snap back, but then he remembered this was his
"Easy now, Mr. Malfoy."
"Harry..." Draco trailed off. He forced himself to meet Harry's gaze, which was a complete mistake. His eyes were dark and full of desire, but they were masked behind his innocent smile. Draco instantly knew he was done for.
"Not sure why I said it like that." Harry said honestly. He let out an embarrassed laugh before looking down at the blank parchment laid out in front of him. He dipped the tip of his quill into the jet black ink and mindlessly created abstract shapes across the page. He was desperate for a distraction. Anything to get his mind off of the heat in between his legs.
It was almost too quiet for Harry to hear, but he decided he wasn't going to push Draco any further. As much fun as it was teasing Draco, it also made him achingly hard again and he was desperate for release.
"Yes, of course we can my little one. Of course we can."
Draco moaned in response, not wasting a beat before he kicked his legs out in front of him and arched his back against the bed.
Draco had a sudden urge to try and please him all over again. He wanted to be
His gestures were sporadic and frenzied. When his swollen prick met the bed, he began circling his hips, hungrily rolling his erection through the mess he's created.
"Just fucking go already." Draco continued to whine, this time pushing himself back successfully on the object and sinking himself further down.
He instantly felt the heat of Draco's member against his calloused palm. His fingers instinctively wrapped around his length, giving it a playful squeeze.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug and Draco nuzzled his nose into his neck, letting himself get lost in Harry's scent for a moment. He placed a gentle, chaste kiss to Harry's skin before tugging back from his grip.
This opened a whole new territory that Harry desperately tried not to cross. He found himself watching Malfoy do simple tasks, like folding his clothes and putting them away or brushing his hair in the morning.
"Harry I—" Harry cut him off with another kiss, sucking Draco's bottom lip into his mouth and tugging on it gently before letting it go.
Draco would point out.
Draco pressed his lips against the tip and dribbled his own spit onto the surface. He moaned against the swollen flesh, feeling it twitch beneath him.
“Draco, you can’t just charge into the ministry.” Harry warned. “That place is a fortress. Nearly all of the employees are brainwashed. Plus, you’re a war criminal and a rogue vampire. If they catch you they’ll do much worse than just kill you.”
“I hardly think that’s any of your business,” Draco sneered.
“I’m looking for work actually,” Draco stated. Once he had accepted Robards’ offer he’d been sent straight to Knockturn Alley to secure a position as an assistant shopkeeper at Borgin & Burkes. A task which Robards had overestimated the simplicity of. This became clear to Draco when Borgan’s face fell in suspicion at his proposal.
“I remember that raid,” Harry spoke up. “That’s one of the reasons I left the Ministry. They refused to do anything about it because all of the victims were prisoners. Nothing but scum in their eyes and they were glad to be rid of them. They were criminals, but it was sickening that the Ministry acted no better than those they threw behind bars.”
“Oh, you’re here,” Malcolm said in a tone that was impossible to read.
“I’m not surprised. Bloodroot is one of the most heavily regulated poisons to date. Only the highest ranking ministry officials have access to it, not even the best potion smugglers can get their hands on it.”
“Very well,” Draco sighed. “What could I possibly have to lose?”
“Malfoy?” The unmistakable voice of Harry Potter brought Draco out of his momentary rage.
“If you’d told me I’d be inviting you into my bed three years ago, I’d have probably hexed the living daylights out of you,” Draco laughed once his breath stilled.
Draco through for a moment. “If I hurry I can get it from the house and still be back in time to open.”
Borgin smiled. He appeared to be intrigued by Draco’s seemingly nefarious intentions. “Going behind daddy’s back, eh? Not getting into trouble are we, Draco?”
“Is she a pureblood?”
Once they had all said their goodbyes, Harry helped Draco with the last of his things and they apparated to an alley that opened up to a quiet street.
A waiter approached them with a drink on a tray, which he presented to Harry.
“Of course,” Draco reassured and Teddy’s expression lightened a bit. “I’ll always be there for you, Teddy. Remember that.”
“Of course not,” Draco assured her.
“You know I have no money,” Draco smirked, allowing his hands to finally make their way to hold Harry’s back.
“What’s on your mind, love?” Draco asked Astoria as they lie tangled in the bedsheets. She’d been quiet all evening which was unlike her.
Ron went to return to whatever it was he was doing before he noticed Draco, but not before he glared at the blonde out of his bosses view.
Teddy had been antsy all day. Andromeda was called into St. Mungo’s for an overnight shift, Harry had sent an owl earlier stating that he’d been caught up at work and would be late, and Draco unfortunately hadn’t been able to entertain do to the copious amounts of reading he had to do on the ministry’s latest target.
Satisfied with Draco’s compliance, Harry tapped his wand on the ignition and the bike came to life. The headlights illuminated the previously dark street and the roar of the engine echoed off the walls of the surrounding buildings.
Draco smiled and returned the gesture.
Draco’s hands were anchored to the sides of Harry’s face as if he feared he would lose those lips if he didn’t. Harry’s erection rested heavy against Draco’s thigh and groaned at the sensation, pushing his hips to meet Harry’s. An action which resulted in Harry biting Draco’s bottom lip and sucking it between his teeth.
Draco stayed silent as he tried to decide whether or not he would answer Harry’s answer. Of course it bloody hurt. For months he woke up in the middle of the night sweating and clutching the mark that burned every time he closed his eyes. But that was a memory Draco had spent years trying to forget.
“You little trouble maker,” Draco teased.
Robards’ words faded to the back of Draco’s mind. He was far too focused on his efforts to not look over at Harry to be concerned with anything else.
Draco to inform him that he was incredibly hard.
Sensing Draco was close, Harry pushed himself out of the old chair. His knees were wobbling slightly as he took a step forward towards the bed. His cock bobbed between the opening of his trousers, standing proudly under Draco's hazy gaze.
"My love, I can't understand you. You have to lift your head from the sheets."
"I wanna see those pretty swollen lips around me, taking me all the way in." Harry's hand untwisted from Draco's hair and made its way along his jaw, settling under his chin again. He tilted Draco's head up to look at him and ran the pad of his thumb against Draco's plump lip, rubbing his spit in.

Even though Harry promised himself he wouldn't pleasure himself until Draco's needs were fulfilled, he couldn't help but fondle his erection through his jeans. He was so incredibly aroused, he could feel his pre-come seeping through his trousers
"Touch me. Gods, I don't think if ever been this hard in my life." Draco groaned and threw his head back. Harry had to shush him as he seemed to forget the setting of their naughty scene.
Harry peered at the empty table next to his, noticing the ingredients that were splayed out across the top.
"Spread your cheeks for me, love. I wanna see how beautiful that hole is. Wanna see how desperate it is to have my thick cock inside it. Does it want that, my sweet boy?"
Smirking to himself, he let one of the leg openings get caught on his big toe and he pulled it back gently with his hand, careful not to stretch it. He let it go with a small snap and his panties flew a few feet in front of him, landing in front of Harry.
"Beautiful." Harry said, stuck in a post-orgasmic trance as he watched the head of Draco’s cock disappear behind his foreskin and reappear when he pulled it back down.
He scolded himself.
give Draco what he was asking for, but he wanted to tease him. He wanted Draco to beg for him. Harry found it so incredibly hot that it made his knees weak.
When Draco returned to the lower level he found that Harry had moved all of the paperwork from the kitchen and spread it out on the coffee table. He was lounging comfortably with his legs crossed, a file in one hand and a steaming cup of tea in the other. His brow was furrowed in concentration as he scanned the document in front of him.
“Alright,” Draco sighed and reluctantly rose from his place on the couch.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked, a deep concern in his eyes.
“Where are you going?” Harry asked Draco over the music.
Draco looked toward the rugged man who stirred in his sleep, a man who had saved Draco’s life on multiple occasions, and wondered if he’d ever be able to repay him.
Draco paused at the sight, once again captivated by the man before him. The intensity in Harry’s eyes, the way he bit his lip, the sliver of skin that was exposed when he reached for another file. All of which sent Draco’s blood rushing south.
“Stop fucking with my friends,” Harry said to Draco.
“Did it hurt?” Harry asked quietly.
“I’m assuming most of your guests are--”
“Weasley!” Robards’ booming voice echoed through the room.
“Not going to turn me in are you?” Draco took a step closer to Harry.
“There’s a Weasley here for you,” Draco replied.
“She does, does she?”
Mouth agape and eyes wide, Draco’s face mimicked the man’s in front of him. Until he was struck with an idea. His expression gracefully relaxed into his signature smirk. Draco took this as an opportunity to have a little fun. Harry had insisted he answer the door, why not make the best of a bad situation.
“I prefer to know that my employees aren’t involved in anything...illegal.”
Draco braced himself against the wall with both hands on either side of Harry’s head and pressed his body against the other man as if he wanted them to merge and become one.
The next day, Draco set up a deal on the far end of Knockturn Alley. The trade off was quick and painless. The dealer didn’t ask questions and barely glanced at Draco when he made the handoff.
“Still, don’t you think that’s at least a conversation we should have had? Don’t my feelings matter?”
There was a brief moment devoid of touch of any kind where Harry coated his length in lube. Harry  grasped Draco’s hip with one hand and lined himself up to Draco’s hole with the other. The next moment was pure bliss as Harry pressed into Draco, stretching him wide as he pushed past the pliant ring of muscle until he was completely seated inside him.
“Are you just going to sit there?” Harry asked.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry looked up from his drink when Draco spoke.
Harry rolled his eyes and reached for the handle when Draco didn’t answer.
Harry tried his best to stifle his laugh at Draco’s reaction so Teddy wouldn’t notice.
Harry could tell that Draco didn’t like going home to an empty bed and made a point to stall when he could. Not that Harry minded. He had grown to enjoy Draco’s company. The way they talked and laughed together reminded him of a simpler time. Draco always got Harry in a way no one else had. Not even Ron and Hermione at times. Yes, they suffered losses in the war and resisted The Reform, but Harry and Draco were touched by a darkness. One that could only be attributed to a connection with the Dark Lord.
“Don’t be a stranger, alright?” She said.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
“What’s the worst that could happen?”
“Malfoy? Come to self surrender?”
Shelves stretched from floor to ceiling on the walls adjacent the entryway filled with hundreds of books of varying ages. There was a writing table nestled in an alcove to his right. On it, a quill feverishly scribbled away on a piece of parchment. A spiral staircase to his left allowed access to the books on higher levels. The opposite wall housed a grand fireplace framed with large armchairs each accompanied by a side table. An eerie portrait of someone he didn’t recognize peering down at him from above the mantle with cold yet indifferent eyes.
“Excuse me,” Draco uttered the words at a volume that was impossible to hear over the music that engulfed the room. He removed himself from Harry’s embrace and fled toward his office.
“Yes, sir. I was hoping to inquire about any administrative positions that might be available.”
“Then take me,” Draco said quietly.
“Very funny.”
“Well Daphne also tells me that you haven’t made it ‘official’. Maybe you haven’t changed so much after all.” Pansy’s eyes then widened in surprise. “Oh my god there’s someone else, isn’t there.
Suddenly, Draco toppled over as if his legs gave out. Harry was fast enough to catch him before he fell to the ground and helped him into one of the chairs in front of the fire.
Draco groaned and rolled onto his back. His head was pounding and his body felt weighed down. Even the simple task of opening his eyes felt like a chore. But he managed nonetheless.
When Draco arrived at the ministry, he was directed to the department and seated outside Gawain Robards’ office.
“You two go ahead. I’ve got some more work to get through,” Draco stated.
Their desperation grew as both men came dangerously close to their climax. Not having the patients to prep Harry properly, Draco reached for his wand to stretch and lubricate Harry’s hole. The realization that Draco had left his wand in the parlor hit him with a wave of frustration.
Draco attempted to prop himself up when a burning sensation shot up his right arm. He winced at the pain and was greeted by a gruesome sight when he looked at his arm to find the skin red and blistered.
Draco studied Harry’s features, reminiscing about the times they had spent together in their youth. Those had been some of the happiest in his life. Whenever those bright, emerald eyes locked onto Draco’s, all of his problems melted away. An effect that Draco now realized had not faltered over time.
“What do you want,” Harry asked coldly after he answered the door.
It was only when Harry placed his hand on Draco’s thigh when he froze. Not because he didn’t like it. In fact it was the complete opposite. And that’s what frightened him. He’d spent so much time trying to push his feelings away. But butterflies filled Draco’s stomach as Harry’s large hand gently squeezed his upper thigh. His mind went foggy as he slowly looked into Harry’s eyes.
Harry wondered further into the flat. His eyes swept over the dark wood floors noticing the large oriental rug and elegant couches that framed a marble fireplace topped with a mirror with silver trimming. “And also...not.” Harry added when gaze found the modern kitchen appliances, and lofted sleeping area. Then, noticing that it was a studio, was the biggest surprise.
“What?” Harry asked, not sure of what the vampire meant.
“So,” Malcolm continued. “Did Draco finally bed you?”
“Well we’ve got to try! I won’t let them get away with what they did to you!” Draco paused. Harry, too, was taken aback by his slip of the tongue. “Or Adriel.”
“When you’ve been in this business as long as I have you learn to exploit loopholes.” Borgin smiled that slimy smile of his. “When can you start?”
“Well, you better figure it out.”
While pacing the kitchen to stretch his legs, Draco glanced into the next room to see Harry and Teddy cuddled together on the couch and smiled. Harry looked up and noticed the blonde, then smiled himself.
“I doubt I’d be welcome there.”
Robards gestured to the leather bound chairs on the other side of the large mahogany fixture. Draco accepted and sat gingerly at the edge of the chair.
“No.”
“Then make them wait.” Draco hoped his obstinance would hint to Harry the ridiculousness of his request.
“Harry!” Draco called to his boyfriend. “Door!”
Harry signed and leaned back on one of the couches behind him. He knew Draco was waiting for an explanation and would either drag it out of him or leave despite Harry’s warning.
Harry had been chipping away at the wall Draco had built up over so many years of pain and sadness and neglect since the day they’d been reacquainted. And he’d finally broken through.
“Since when do you ride a motorcycle?” Draco asked thinking back to all of their past encounters. Not once had he seen Harry travel anyway other than on foot Or broom of course, but that part of their life felt a lifetime away. Even so, it wasn’t that much of a stretch seeing that Harry already looked the part of some sort of night rider.
“No need to apologize,” Draco assured. “We have nothing to hide.”
“You mean like an auror?” Draco asked. He didn’t necessarily think he was qualified for said position. That and ninety percent of the aurors were people who would be less than willing to work with him.
“Draco, you almost kissed me.”
“Maybe if you were honest with yourself you’d be able to see that the only thing that ruined your relationship was the fact that you were too selfish to just settle for one lover instead of two.
“Why don’t you let me show you?” Harry whispered. He reached out and took Draco’s face in his hands as he closed the gap between their lips.
Draco froze. He was kissing Harry Potter. Harry Potter was kissing him. Harry’s lips were soft and full and fit perfectly in line with Draco’s. It was much better than Draco could have ever imagined. Draco was in ecstasy. Every neuron in his body was firing off at once.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I have some business to take care of,” Draco spoke the words without stopping or turning to face Harry.
“Harry, please,” Draco began.
Draco said nothing. He fixed his gaze on Harry waiting for him to continue.
He placed tender kisses on the inside of Harry’s thighs, then sat up just enough to take in the sight of him. Draco eyed Harry hungrily and all but pounced at him taking his length in one go.
Draco continued to stare intently.
Draco sighed as he suddenly remembered idiotically storming out of the club without checking the time. If Harry hadn't been there, he’d probably be dead. A reality that wouldn’t have bothered him a few weeks before.
“Is it that hard to believe?”
“When you were with the Aurors, did you hear of or see any use of illicit potions?” Draco asked.
Draco scoffed. Only Potter would find a way to make this situation humorous.
“Then what are you waiting for? Why are you holding back? Is it something about me?”
“I would have thought all your training would make this a breeze. If I knew you were just going to complain I would have asked someone else to help me,” Draco teased.
Before Draco had a chance to protest, Harry took the glass from his hand and placed it on the table in front of them. Harry then took Draco’s hand in his and guided them toward the dance floor.
Harry stopped, but before he was able to speak, Draco had aparated them to his bed.
“No,” Draco answered coldly. “I killed that bastard as soon as I had the chance.”
Harry became tense. Memories of his training flooded back in endless waves. Memories he’d spent years trying to rid himself of.
Draco reluctantly held out his arm and Harry grimaced at the sight of the mutilated appendage.
There was a long moment of silence before Astoria spoke again. “I don’t think I can do this anymore, Draco.”
“I think you broke him,” Draco playfully observed.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re not as bad a person as you make yourself out to be.”
“Please!” He begged. “I really don’t know anything! I’m just a runner. Bloodroot is impossible to get a hold of. Only the ministry has access to it.”
“Look on the bright side. If that were to happen then you wouldn’t need a job.”
“I haven’t known you to go on more than a few dates with any one person.”
Draco smiled fondly and wrapped his arm around Teddy, pulling him in closer. “Yeah, Teddy Bear. I’ll be fun now.”
Draco followed willingly, completely lost in the moment. They descended the balcony stairs and mixed in with the general crowd. The music was deafening and the lights hypnotizing, but all he could focus on was Harry. It was as if they were the only two people in the room. The only two people in the world.
“You think I had a choice?” Draco scoffed and all sympathy he might have had for Harry was gone.. “I can’t believe I wasted my time on you! I can’t believe I though you actually cared about me and that it could turn into something that was more than just sex!”
“I hope that’s not an issue,” Harry said on the defense.
Harry’s eyes lit up and he wasted no time capturing Draco’s lips with his own. The heat between them was eminent. Harry possessively held Draco and pushed him further into his desk. His hands feverishly roamed Draco’s body, reclaiming every inch of the blonde.
“We never said we were exclusive,” Draco mumbled.
That night, Draco returned to Decadence for the first time in months. If he were to start a trail to Adriel’s killer, this was the place to do it.
“Alright,” Draco said. “I’m in.”
“I’ve developed a salve to help with the healing process. It shouldn't take more than a few days. What time is it?” Draco asked.
Draco slid inside and began to thrust deep inside of Astoria. Their sighs and moans complemented one another as his pace quickened. Astoria was reduced to a writhing mess when she began to touch herself. She reached her climax with a shout. Her walls clenched around Draco, who was not far behind.
Harry looked at the box he was carrying. “You’re joking, right?”
Draco groaned. He never knew wandless magic could be so sexy. The way Harry’s magic engulfed him felt more intimate than anything he’d ever experienced. He caught a glimpse of Harry’s face which made it very clear that he knew just how much his magic was affecting Draco.
“What are we doing, Draco?” She asked after a moment.
“Mal--wha--Har--but?” Ron’s unintelligible string of words was music to Draco’s ears. He had his boyfriend’s oblivious best friend right where he wanted him.
The words sent shivers down Draco’s spine. Everything. He’d wanted everything the man on top of him was willing to give. Harry wasn’t like the other men he’d been with. He wasn’t looking to just get off after a long night of drinking and bad decisions. But at the same time a voice in the back of his head warned him that this was a bad idea.
Andromeda didn’t have a television but Harry had rigged up some sort of contraption that projected the film on the wall opposite the couch. Teddy had chosen to watch some muggle children's film that he was most likely introduced to by Harry. Draco looked toward the other man and shot him a look expressing his disdain for the nonsense.
"Don't ever leave me by myself with them
"Well alright, you little brat." Draco teased and wrapped his hands around the base of the toy, releasing it from his sons grip. Scorpius let go
Hesitant, Draco decided to respond with, "what are you playing at, Potter?" Harry noted that his usual defensive tone seemed watered down with arousal. He couldn't help but let the corners of his mouth twitch up into a smile.
Draco's fingers grazed over his own pale skin and his hyper sensitive body twitched underneath his touch. His finger drew teasing circles around one of his erect nipples, while his left hand began trailing down towards his half hard prick that was hidden beneath
"Is this okay?" Harry asked, trailing his finger along Draco's jawline. His hot breath tickled at Draco's lips and entered through the opening of his mouth. All Draco could do was nod his head in agreement.
"Sorry, the knee. I apologize for—" Harry's arm began to speed up and Draco was lost again. Lost in his own headspace where only him and Harry existed.
So yes, it was rather
"Oh—Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck." Draco repeated under his breath as he rolled his hips into Harry's delicious grip.
loathed the situation he got himself into, but for an entirely different reason than he started out with:
His tongue ran across the smooth surface of his skin, watching Harry through hooded eyelids. He swirled it around the back of his hand, lapping at every part of skin Harry graced upon.
"You're beautiful, do you know that?"
Harry let out a low chuckle, understanding immediately what Draco wanted him to do. "Eager now, are we my love?" Harry teased and took notice upon the fiery red flush appearing on the tip of Draco's ears.
"I've been s'good Harry. Please. I'll be so good." Draco pleaded, begging Harry for his sweet release.
Slughorns voice died down and every head in the room curiously turned towards the commotion at the door.
"So bad, Harry. Need you s'bad." Draco whined and spread apart his cheeks, hooking his fingers on the g string to pull it to the side.
Harry's surprise didn't linger for long. He found himself taking the lead, controlling Draco's desperate movements. The boy clung onto Harry like he was scared he would leave him, but he wasn't going anywhere. Harry wouldn't ever dream of it.
"In case you forgot," Harry started, using his opposite hand to hold down Draco's hips against the seat. "We are in the middle of potions right now. You need to control yourself or we'll get caught."
"Of course! You go get them ready for me and I'll be down in a minute, ok Bud?" Harry suggested, ruffling the top of Albus' head. The two boys nodded eagerly and raced off towards the the living room, leaving Draco and Harry alone.
"You both are. You're gonna be the greatest wizards of all time." Draco replied, not holding back the growing smile on his face.
Now, a few months later, Harry
Harry shuddered underneath the soft flicks of Draco's tongue against his head. The wet smacking coming from Draco's lips as he enjoyed licking up the pre-release off of Harry was a delicious sound to hear. It was driving Harry insane.
It was odd. The feeling of hatred he felt for Draco had completely dissipated over the last several months.
Squeezing the base of his cock, he drew his eyes away from his it and back to Draco. His complexion still appeared to be flushed and the tips of his usually tamed hair was beginning to curl.
Even though Draco would refuse to agree to it out loud, it
He pushed his arse backwards, hoping to feel the silicon shape against his hole again, but Harry was quicker on his feet. He waved his wand away from himself, causing the object to move in response.
." Draco demanded, pressing down harder against Harry's hand.
It was in this moment Harry knew he has never been so achingly aroused in his lifetime.
"What the hell are you on about." Draco gasped, clearly not paying attention to the lecture at all. Harry stifled a laugh while he circled the head with a teasing finger.
Draco whined and curled his toes, lost in the world Harry was creating for him. He could faintly hear the sound of a zipper being undone and the old wooden chair creaking, but as his finger applied more pressure on top of his rim, his curiosity fled him faster than it came on.
From Albus already creating white long beards out of soap, to Scorpius utilizing a plastic strainer to make it "rain" on Draco's head, he was a giggling mess.
"Hey, don't let me stop you." Harry teased, finally falling out of his stiffened state and regaining his confidence. He's been dreaming about this moment for longer than he would like to admit, and he wasn't about to ruin it by not taken advantage of the situation. That is of course, if Malfoy was willing to participate as well. He wouldn't push anything onto the other boy that he didn't want.
He wasn't sure when the transition went from 'King' to 'Princess', but he decided to not correct them. If it made them laugh, who was he to tell them to stop?
"Is Iggy ok?" Albus was already towering over
"Does someone not remember what happens when little boys are around fat feet?" Draco asked, lifting his eyebrow in question.
The words echoed in his head, stuck on repeat like a broken record. It was the same Harry he met years ago on the train, eager to please the boy he has heard so much about while growing up.
Draco let it go with a
." Draco hissed in Harry's direction after the attention was drawn off of them.
“I’m not talking about your arm,” Harry said before Draco had a chance to speak.
“Are you mad? You can’t work tonight.” Harry pointed out.
“My father doesn’t know I’m here if that’s what you’re implying.” Lucius made a lot of enemies in attempts to lessen his sentence. A great deal of death eaters were behind bars because of him. “I need funds that he doesn’t have access to.”
“I couldn’t care less about that. Look at you, you can barely stand.” Harry insisted.
Harry sat with himself for a moment before casting a tempus. The time read 6:20am. Sunrise.
Harry’s lips were moving, but Draco was too distracted by the sensory overload to comprehend his words.
Draco wracked his brain for something to say before the door was slammed in his face.
Harry might not have realized, but it was clear now to Draco. He was falling in love with Harry, and Harry with him.
Both of the men lay breathless next to each other. When their breathing settled they continued to lay motionless in the silence.
Harry spoke up when Draco continued to hold his tongue. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have--”
Draco stood and followed Robards into his office. It was much larger than he would have expected. And exquisitely decorated. The walls were adorned with various plaques and medals of honor. The walls were lined with bookshelves filled with books on numerous subjects. In the center of the office stood a large desk which was framed by grand windows that overlooked the busy streets of London.
“Hey, man, I don’t have anything on me! I swear!” He whimpered.
“Save it for the Aurors.” Draco spat. “Someone in the city is dealing bloodroot and you’re going to tell me who.”
Harry looked at Draco as if he had gone mad before he noticed the sincerity in his eyes and his defences relaxed.
Draco pushed himself inside Harry slowly until he had nothing left to give. He captured Harry’s lips in his and began to thrust hard into the other man again and again. Each of his breaths ended in an erotic groan. Each of Harry’s gradually became louder and Draco increased his pace until he was a whimpering writhing mess under him.
Scorpius' cold hand reached out to grab Draco's gray trousers and shivers shot up through his knee. Soon the rest of Scorpius' body followed suit and he plopped himself right into the lap of his
man alive. As if he wasn't taking about
"Since you asked so nicely..." He trailed off and went to collect Draco's dripping come in the palm of his hand. He rubbed in the slimy fluid with his fingers, coating his hand up in the natural lube.
Slughorn waved his wand and the lights began to dim, signifying the start to the presentation. Harry's eyes wandered around the room, taking in the state of his other classmates.
"I charmed the dildo. Is this alright, my pretty boy? Are you ready or do you need more time?" Harry raised his wand, putting a stop to the movements so Draco could respond.
Harry's hand stroked upwards until it found the head of Draco's throbbing cock. Precome spilled out and trailed down the length, collecting against Harry's tight fist. He used the viscous fluid to lather up Draco's cockhead with the pad of his thumb. The sensations made Draco twitch in his seat.
"Papa no!" Albus screeched, squirming and laughing underneath him. He relinquished Iggy from his grip and as soon as she hit the ground, she rolled off towards the wall. Draco's foot was soon enveloped in his sons tiny hands, and he used every ounce of strength he had in his four year old body to push his Papa away. "'Corpus! 'Corpus, help me!"
"Swim trunks? Wow, you guys were really living the dream today." He commented once he saw Albus sporting his golden snitch swim suit. He grabbed three of the towels stacked up on the shelf and casted a warming charm on all of them.
Draco moaned, loud enough for not just Harry to hear, but also Millicent Bulstrode who sat at the front of the room. Draco quickly masked it with a cough and Harry waited a few moments for the attention to draw away before continuing.
and I blame every second on you." Draco said, but there was no bite behind his words.
If apparition wasn't blocked from the Hogwarts wards, Draco would've been far from the classroom in the dungeons by now. He felt faint under the intense stares of his peers. He felt as though they all knew the dirty deeds he committed in this very room just moments ago.
it to be.
It was the moment when Draco received an owl from Harry explaining that he would be home late, when Draco realized he was simply and utterly
As Draco leaned into the counter, crushing the bean under the knife Slughorn provided and Harry mentally disrobed him, wanting to see the way his muscles flexed under tension.
He removed his hand from Draco's hip and placed it on top of his own crotch, palming the achingly hard outline through his trousers.
"Fuck." Harry breathed out and his hand instinctively sought out for the sweaty waves of hair on top of Draco's head. He entangled his fingers through the untamed locks and gripped at his scalp. Draco drew out a long cry of pleasure around Harry's cock and the vibrations sent shivers up his body.
Harry held the small piece of metal in between his two fingers and tugged his fly down, opening the flap and exposing his pants underneath. He pulled out his swollen member and gave it a few strokes before massaging the spongy head in his palm. He lifted his chin and stared directly at Draco who now stood at the front.
"The next ingredient we—Oh! I thought I saw a bird flying across the room there for a moment. Peculiar, that was. Hmm, where was I? Ah yes, The next ingredient..." Draco stifled a laugh and bit back his growing smirk. Harry appeared to be more annoyed than amused by Slughorn's words.
"Ah yes, Miss Granger!" Slughorn called enthusiastically. Draco's eyes followed to where Harry's friends were seated, just a few rows ahead of them.
"Tastes so good." Draco groaned breathlessly before impatiently picking it back up and latching his mouth back around it. He slurped up Harry's juices greedily, swallowing as much as he could. Draco was making such a mess with his spit, it began to pool amongst Harry's pubic hair.
"The powdered root of asphodel is also used in the Vitamix potion. The effect of the potion gives the drinker a burst of energy, which greatly sharpens their reflexes." Hermione answered loudly, but to the boys in the back of the room, it sounded like it was coming from down the hall. The voices in the room began to fizzle out again.
"Yes, sir." Harry teased. He might've been able to hide his laughter, but he certainly failed to conceal the wide grin on his face.
Frustrated moans broke past Draco's lips, vocalizing his disagreement. Draco's knees gave out beneath him and soon his whole body was lying flush against the mattress.
"What are you playing at?"
"Oh no." Ron stopped in his tracks and froze, his features showcasing his trepidation. It was enough to draw Harry's attention and force his body upright in concern.
