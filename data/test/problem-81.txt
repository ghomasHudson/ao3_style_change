“Darling, I know it’s hard. But facing it is the best way to get over him. And you will get over it and before you know it, you’ll be moving on with someone else.”
They all take a pint and follow Michael to a corner table, where there’s more light and the music is less loud.
Harry smiles back and cocks his head slightly to the side.
“And?”
“I was not glaring.”
When he walks back out of the toilet, he immediately bumps into Dan. It’s like he’s been waiting on him. “Michael told me you were here.” Dan brushes his hand over Draco’s cheek. “He also told me something else.”
“No, it’s not! You’re just scared.”
“Greg!” Pansy shrieks.
“I’m fine!” He says, but it isn’t true. He’s drunk in the back of the car and he is crying like a baby coming home from the bar. Pansy and Greg had picked this night to tell their friends that they were engaged. And Draco had drunk a bit too much. Jealous of his friends. They’re able to be together all the time and in public. And Draco wants the same. He doesn’t want to keep secrets just to keep Harry, but it’s the way it is.
“How so?” Harry asks curiously, he knew McLaren to be a nice guy.
“Nope,” Draco lets the p pop extra loudly, “That’s why I’m here.” He points at his empty glass, “Just downing my sorrows.”
“Point is,” Harry continues, ignoring Draco. “You are all wrong.”
“So, as I was saying. Before sleeping beauty over there joined us.” Blaise smirks at Draco before turning to Pansy and Greg.
“I know, I know.” Dan gets up, “He’s only got eyes for you.”
“Yes, what the fuck are you doing here?!” Dan stalks towards them and Draco flinches and tries to slink away from Dan’s approaching figure. Harry notices it and steps in between them.
Draco’s look turns dark, “I’m not a fool Blaise. You’re just trying to get a rise out of me and I’m not playing along.” He stands up.
“Harry?!” Weasley shouts, “They said you were here. Where are you? I
Draco settles his enormous tap. The many drinks haven’t made Dan more attractive. And yes, Draco might be desperate, but he’s still desperate for Harry. Not for his annoying friend.
Draco wakes in an empty bed. He shoots up and glances around the room. Did Harry leave? Did he realise this was a mistake after all? Draco spots Harry shoes near the door. He frowns to himself and points his ears, but he can’t hear the shower. He must have went and left them behind.
“Well, you know how the prophet likes to document my life.”
It’s dusty inside and Harry frowns before casting some cleaning spells through the kitchen and sitting room.  He puts the cattle on and asks Draco to sit down on the couch with a movement of his hand.
Draco shrugs again. He isn’t really sure how long he’s been here. He tries not to think about it, because thinking about it means thinking about that morning and that night. And that means thinking about Harry and that just ends up feeling like death by a thousand cuts. So, he just gets drunk, but it’s not enough cause when the morning the comes Harry is not there. And then he has to do it again.
“Great. He’s lounging at the recovery ward. I’ll be glad when he’s gone.”
“Why?” Harry walks up to Draco, “Let me tell you a story to explain. I walked into a muggle bar with a new friend who told me he needed someone to set up with his best friend. Because his best friend had a new hot friend he really wanted to meet. So of course, good friend that I am, I went with him. Low and behold I ended up in the hot friends bed. And listen, this is really important.” Harry gives him a serious look, and Draco can’t help but smirk at his look. “The guy was really hot.” Draco laughs.
Draco ignores him as he elbows his way out of the bar. Dan keeps on his trail, “You know that Michael and I decided were better of as friends. So, I’m single again too.”
Draco looks up at Harry, who’s pacing up and down the length of the couch.
“Well that too.”
“Please don’t repeat that out loud.” Draco says.
“Nice to meet you Draco.” Potter – Harry – says and he pulls Draco against him and presses his lips back against Draco’s.
Blaise snorts, “You’re not going to beat me Ronald.”
Blaise just shrugs. “Potter,” Blaise says, looking out of the corner of his eyes at Draco.
“Oh, McLaren has this story about his son’s toad that he just tells everyone all the time.”
“No, why would we do that.”
“Babe, no.”
“And if you win?”
Potter pulls away, loops his fingers through one of Draco’s beltloops and pulls him along to his bed. Potter turns around with a grin and Draco raises his eyebrow in question. With one hand on his chest Potter pushes Draco, not hard but Draco lets himself fall on his back on the bed. He shrugs of his shoes and crawls further on the bed till his head is on the pillow.
“Sssh,” Draco pulls him up and presses a hand over Harry’s mouth, “I hear someone coming.” Draco hastily grabs his wand, summons their clothes and shoes and closes the curtain with a swish.
Greg carries Pansy to the dorms, “Good luck Blaise, Draco with your games. We’re going to play our own right now.” Pansy shouts.
“No need to state the obvious-”
Draco hums and accios another bag from which he takes a belt which he throws at Harry. As Harry puts the belt through the loops Draco steps closer to him with a colbert and a jacket in his hands. “Try this one first.” He hands Harry the colbert. When Harry has shrugged it on Draco straightens his collar and commands him to put the shirt in his slacks. When he tries it with the jacket the shirt needs to be worn out of his slacks. Then he needs to try it with another colour shirt. Another colour slacks. A pair of jeans. Other shoes. Boots. A different belt. A longer coat. Draco even places a hat on Harry's head at some point.
“Spin the bottle,” Pansy smirks.
“Found Potter?” Blaise asks smirking at Ronald.
Draco startles, Merlin, do even muggles now know who Harry Potter is?!
“Does that mean that you’ve been photographed entering my house?”
“Yes, I want this.” Draco takes Harry’s face into his hands and kisses him slowly. “Are you sure too?”
.” Hermione says with a smirk.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Blaise says angerly.
Draco feels the colour draining from his face. “You – you can’t know that.”
“Then Blaise will do his charm thing and ask Potter to entertain Draco if he doesn’t do alone. Potter will sputter and Draco,” she fixes Draco with one on her looks, “You will get up and ask
“You want to stop studying in order to go on a date?”
“Harry?” Now it sounds like Granger has entered the dorm as well. “Ron?” she asks, “Where is Harry?”
“I hate you.” Blaise says under his breath.
Harry looks up grinning like a devil, “definitely not.” He says. He walks up to Draco and presses his lips to Draco´s temple, “that´s. That´s probably the best thing I´ve ever heard.” He whispers.
Stunned Draco stares at him, “A cupboard?”
“A couple of months ago, when Ron, Avery and I first started talking about going back, I talk to Kingsley and Gawain about it. They found a few aurors who were interested into coming to Romania. So I err, kind of trained them, so now they’re working there.”
“He’s just dressing to kill his time.” Pansy says.
“Yeah we had to fight a band of rouge nifflers for it.” Ron jokes.
“Boys! Boys! This is not your dorm!” Parvati Patil shouts laughing.
Merlin, it still hurts. It’s been 2 months and he still hasn’t heard anything from him. It’s been so hard not to contact him, but Harry knows he needs to give Draco the space he asked for. Harry realises he really hurt Draco. He just hadn’t realised how much.
“Oh really?” Her face lightens up.
Just then someone pushes open the door.
Michael flushes, “We’ve been friends since Uni.”
“Yes. Goodbye.” Draco grabs Harry’s wrist and pulls him along to their dorm.
Malfoy smiles weakly and Harry wants to say more, but the waitress sets down their drinks and they order lunch.
“Of course, I can Blaise, don’t be stupid.” Draco snaps.
“Yeah. He died at the battle of Hogwarts all those years ago. I hadn’t seen his brother in years, but Seamus and Dean ran into him and he told them he wanted to give Colin’s old camera to me. So, they took him along yesterday. Dennis explained how to use it.” Harry looks up at Draco and smirks, “Want to try it?”
So it was that he found himself expending his excess energy by pacing in his tastefully decorated sitting room, the decor courtesy of Pansy since she’d taken to interior design after school like a duck to water. He was having a hard time coming up with an idea of what to get Malfoy for Christmas. Harry desperately wanted him to like it, but what did you get a man who could (and frequently did) buy whatever his heart desired? He knew Malfoy’s taste in everything from clothing, to wine, to music was far superior to his own, so Harry was more than a little unnerved at this point. It’d have to be something unexpected. His head came up sharply as an idea coalesced in his mind. It was perfect, but it would also leave him exposed with nowhere to hide once they did the whole ‘revealing who got who’ bit of the exchange. Well, he hadn’t been sorted into Gryffindor for nothing.
Smirking at him, she bounced to her feet and made to head off to her own room for some well-deserved rest only to be brought up short by Harry’s hand loosely encircling her wrist. She arched her eyebrows at him, and he gave her a tired smile in response.
Draco’s eyes gleamed as he stood and rounded the corner of the table to draw even with Harry. He leaned into Harry’s space and crowded him against the table’s edge, his hands moving to rest palms flat on either side of him. “Anything you want me to, but only if you’re very good.”
Draco thought,
It was Harry’s turn to yank Draco towards him, his mouth colliding with the other man’s as he kissed him with a newfound sense of urgency. He felt Draco groan into the kiss, their tongues exploring each other thoroughly for several drawn-out moments. When they finally broke away long enough to gasp for air, Harry looked into Draco’s flushed face, his own cheeks heated but voice low and thick with need.
He merely laughed when Draco growled and pinched his side, slapping his hand away lightly as he leaned down to capture the man’s mouth in another kiss. Draco melted into it, his index fingers hooking in the loops of Harry’s jeans, which still hung loosely around his hips. It would be another twenty minutes before either of them bothered to spare a thought for the fact they were still at work, but who had time for such trivialities when they could be engrossed in each other instead? Who indeed.
A tingle ran down Draco’s spine as he was greeted by a dark rumble, though the tone was as lush as velvet. Sebastien Toussaint could have given his former Potions professor a run for his money when it came to a voice that could by turns either beguile or cut like glass, but he was far easier on the eyes than Snape could’ve ever hoped to be. Draco shoved that thought aside viciously before nodding politely to the tailor and returning the polite greeting and launching into an explanation of why he was there and what he wanted.
“I would have if I’d known you wanted me to before. What are you doing tonight?”
“Potter, care to rejoin us in the present? I’ve only been standing here holding this out to you for the last little bit of forever. Don’t mind me. I have all day.”
You’re so..ah, so good for me. Let go, I wa-want to see it…”
Malfoy had looked affronted at the idea that
After a while Draco made a face and complained about the mess, and Harry laughed as he cast a cleaning charm and then settled them both under the covers, nosing at Draco’s hairline before placing a tender kiss to his temple.
“The amount I took, at the strength I brewed it, about an hour.” Draco bit off each word sharply, leveling Harry with a frosty glare of reproach at the insult.
“I want to, Draco, I do. Merlin, I want you so much. You have no idea, but there’s something I have to tell you first. Please. Can we go back inside? Back to our room. We’ll talk, and then if you still want—”
Hermione’s expression had begun to clear after the reassurance of the envelope’s delivery, but it quickly darkened again at the mention of the Head Auror. That man was always bothering Harry, pulling him for special missions or consulting with him on especially Dark cases, sometimes going so far as to ask him to intercede with the Minister, which always made Harry extremely uncomfortable, but she knew Harry had trouble saying no to people, particularly when they needed his help. She was becoming increasingly concerned about her friend being spread too thin, and she said as much now to Ron.
He wrapped a hand around his erection, gasping in relief at the sensation as he started to stroke, his free hand coming up to stifle the sounds he was making as he continued to pleasure himself. All thoughts of trying to hold back had fled, and in their place was Harry. When Draco closed his eyes he imagined a much darker hand wrapped around his cock, a beloved voice murmuring in his ear. He bit down on his knuckle, hips rocking as he frantically sought relief from the need roaring through him. Unfortunately (and unbeknownst to him) Draco would find none via his own touch, and he was becoming more and more desperate as the minutes ticked on.
“Mnn.. Harry, I wan-wanna give yo—”
“Having some trouble there, love?”
give him the envelope I gave you, I hope?”
my skin in vivid detail.
Pansy cackled from her spot next to Harry and piped up just as Draco made it to the tree and leaned down to grab the first present, muttering under his breath all the while,
Draco shook his head frantically, one hand lifting to thread his fingers through Harry’s hair and tug him into another deep, lingering kiss before he broke it off to continue in a hoarse voice,
“Ha bloody ha. Now quit scowling at me and hold still. Does it have to be like in that manual you have there, or is any braid alright?”
Harry then silenced Draco’s resulting squawk of indignation by kissing him again, this time open-mouthed and filthy, and it was all Draco could do to not slide bonelessly to the floor. By the end of it he was sure the only thing keeping him on his feet was the firm pressure of Harry’s hands, which had slipped backward to cup his arse and draw him even closer as Draco shamelessly rode his thigh, a high, mewling noise escaping him in the process. Harry might’ve been full of quips about shutting Draco up, but he was the one that kept up a running commentary when his mouth wasn’t otherwise engaged.
Draco slides on the bench, Michael sliding in after him. Dan sits in the stool opposite of Draco and immediately rubs his feet against Draco’s. Draco recoils not pleased with the casual touches of a stranger.
“No, I didn't.” Draco snaps, “If I did I would've-”
“Well,”
Wedding 2: Millicent and Theo 3
Millicent shrugs, “You said you fancy boys. I want to test it. You know all the girls will be sad, but at least we’ll know.”
“I’m, I’m not gay.”
“Yes of course! Luna and I want our best men to look the best!”
“That doesn’t really help your case mate. It’s not like you dated anyone else.” Ron says.
“Yes, I know.”
“Oh,” Pansy crawls on his lap, presses a kiss on his neck and whispers something in his ear. Draco sees Greg’s face light up.
“Ignore him Draco. Come with me.” Dan interrupts him.
“Don’t tell Hermione mate,” Ron slaps Harry on the back once he’s finally dressed, “or she’ll really take you shopping.”
“I rent a place on Cornelia street.” Draco says casually in the car.
“Errr, thanks Justin.” Blaise says as Draco just gapes at him.
“I- uh” Potter sighs, “Let’s get changed.” He turns and starts toward their shared room. Draco and Potter share a dormitory with Theo and MacMillen.
“Stop for now. Let’s just go for a butterbeer and study afterwards in the common room on the comfortable couch.”
’re the one for me, not Ginny. It never was Ginny; I see that now. And I don’t know why I didn’t realise this before. I know I don’t deserve another chance, but if you give me one. I promise, I swear I’ll never let you wake up alone ever again.” Harry stops pacing and looks at Draco. Their eyes meet, Harry’s are bright, red, and wet.
“For Merlin’s sake!” Harry speaks up, “Butt out of my life. I’m fine! Really I don’t need a date to the weddings and Malfoy and I were just talking about work.”
Then suddenly he pulls out of Blaise’s arms. Blaise stumbles, but steadies himself before falling over. Ronald isn’t so lucky; he stumbles back over the char and lands on his bum on the floor. He scrambles up not meeting Blaise’s eyes, “I’m sorry I – I have to go. To do… stuff.”
Draco casts a quick reparo and scroucify and pours himself a new cup of tea.
“Both.” Harry sips his drink and winks at Draco.
Pansy already starts shrieking with laughter, “I can see where this is going.”
“Great, just a second,” she runs up the staircase to her dormitory.
Harry pushes another finger and Draco breaks the kiss as he pushes his head into the pillows. “You Okay with this?” Harry whispers in his ear.
Potter leans in and kisses him again. Softer this time. Draco lets himself melt into the kiss and deepens it. He sneaks his hands under Potter’s sweater, trailing over his back, nails scratching. Potter groans deep in his throat and pulls slightly away from Draco.
“I-I don’t want to.”
His friends quickly glance his way.
“Guys?” Hermione eyes Harry curiously. Harry who has just been trying to ignore this entire conversation rolls at Hermione’s curiosity.
“Just a few.”
“Why are you smirking?” Theo asks.
“Carbonara please.” Draco takes the box from Harry's hands. They eat in a peaceful quiet. Harry notices that Draco leaves the tomato pieces that were in the salad on the side of his plate and he quickly steals them with his fork. Draco looks at him out of the side of his eyes and smirks as he steals an extra piece of cheese from Harry’s plate. Harry chuckles, and even though he likes his salad with cheese as well he lets Draco get away with it.
“Or we could go somewhere else. France. Italy. Maybe Spain? Or we could even go to America.”
“Hey!” Draco protests, uncomfortable.
“And-” Hermione starts.
Draco pushes down his disappointment. He knew this would happen when he asked Harry home, and when he saw him in his sheets. He falls back on his sheets, how could he have thought spending a night with Harry
“I’m not sure if I’d call it spectacular.”
“But then again he hasn’t met Weasley.” Draco’s eyes gleam mysteriously as he sips his champagne.
“Fuck,” Ronald mutters under his breath, and moves his king, trying to free it from Blaise’s bishop’s grip, a rooky move that he never would’ve made if he wasn’t so flustered.
With a switch of his hand Harry cleans up the mess they made and if Draco hadn’t just come, he’d be turned on again.
“How so?”
“I didn't know what that spell did!”
“Here?” the taxi driver stops when Draco pushes the door open.
“They already did,” Luna says whimsically. “They are here aren’t they.”
“Doesn’t bother us.” Harry says while Draco says, “Special quidditch ropes.”
“Well I don’t blame you.” Harry says.
Harry sighs deeply and turns around. “Draco,” he starts, “I don’t think-”
“Then why did you set me up with him?”
Hermione is completely absorbed in her books. Weasley however, doesn’t seem to even bother on his studies. He keeps distracting her with touches and kisses. Can’t he see that this is bothering her? Hermione’s clearly uncomfortable being this close in public. Especially in the library, her hide away place. Theo understands her completely. Unlike Potter, Weasley and even Blaise and Draco, they have had many friends during their early Hogwarts years. Theo’s honestly surprised he’s starting to gain more friends this eight year. They both used the library to hide away in earlier years. But till this year they hadn’t seen much of each other. Maybe every now and again, but their opposite positions of their houses made them stay clear of each other. Now they share a common room and their classes are smaller, so they see much more of each other. Maybe they see each other really for the first time. They have a lot in common and Theo admires her determination and her excessive knowledge. And now she always chuckles softly at his sarcastic comments in classes of remarks about their books. Every time she does so, it makes Theo’s stomach flutter.
“I’m so happy to see you again, it’s been far too long. The letters just haven’t been enough.” She says the bright smile not falling from her face.
“Yep, that's probably why I still have all these old clothes that I never wear anymore. I never used to have anything of my own, and now that I do, I sometimes sort of hoard them. At least that's what ´Mione says.”
Harry laughs breathlessly and removes his fingers. He whispers a wandless lubricant spell and slicks his cock up with his now wet fingers. He adjusts Draco’s legs around his waist and positions himself. Slowly Harry pushes in. Draco digs his nails in against the slight burn.
Angry, Harry ran towards them. What the fuck was Dan thinking?! Harry pulled him of off Draco and punched him hard across the face. Dan cursed at him, but Harry ignored him and focused on Draco, “Draco. Draco, are you alright?”
“Harry.”
For someone so smart and well spoken. When he gets nervous it amazes Draco that he can’t speak at all. But it seems to amuse Granger, because she smiles softly. “I’ll just grab my books. The we can go to the library. I was thinking we should try and search in the charm section for another angle.”
“Harry?” Draco can’t hold back his tears, “What are you doing here?”
“You’ve planned it all out, haven’t you?”
Draco runs back upstairs and checks the bathroom, just to be sure. It’s empty. And not just because Harry isn’t there. Draco frowns to himself and opens the cupboard above the sink. Half of his stuff is gone. No. It’s not his stuff that’s gone. It’s Harry’s.
“Darling what’s wrong?” Pansy isn’t strong enough to keep him up, so when he falls to his knees, she sits down with him. She pushes his hair out of his face, “Draco?”
Harry nods affirmatively, “but today isn’t about us Theo. How are you feeling? Now that you’re a married man.”
“Draco, please. Let me explain.” Harry reaches out, but Draco pulls away. A bit too quickly and he stumbles. He’s still too drunk. He needs to get away before he does something stupid. “Why should I?” He says as he starts walking away in the opposite way that Dan went.
“What are you doing?”
“Like it?” Draco glances up at Harry, who worries his lower lip between his teeth and has a serious frown. “I love it. I – Thank you. No one ever made me a cake before.”
“Hey,” Draco has never seen Blaise this uncomfortable. Blaise is an impossible handsome guy, with flawless dark skin, broad shoulders, big hands and a jaw that could cut paper. He could get anyone he wanted, but he settled his sight on a Weasley the most stubborn of wizards. And he picked the Weasley who probably hadn’t even considered all the possibilities of his sexuality. Making it impossibly hard on himself.
“Very articulate Potter!” Draco screams after him.
Harry leans in, his soft lips pressed against Draco’s. Draco’s eyes fall close as he gasps, allowing Harry’s tongue to slip in and oh Merlin.
“No, I, I wanted this for a while now.”
“Well sort off.”
Hermione’s laughing about some joke Theo made about a grammar mistake in their book. A strand of hair has escaped her ponytail and Theo leans close to tug it behind her ear. Hermione stills and looks into Theo’s eyes.
“They only gave me the hand-me-downs of my cousin. Who was much bigger than me?”
Blaise had seen less of Ronald this week then he had since the start of this school year, a month ago. Every time Blaise caught Ronald alone, or set up a chess game. Potter came and demanded all of Ronald's attention.
Intertwined they fall asleep.
“We dare Neville to snog Hannah.” Harry says.
“I don’t care; do it together.” Millicent shrugs.
“I-  I just.” Michael takes a deep breath, “I just don’t think he’s into me.”
Merlin this is it. This is really happening. Draco cups the back of Harry’s neck and pulls him closer. Harry’s hands roam over Draco’s sides, and he can’t help the soft moan that escapes him. It just feels so good. So real, not like any of the dreams he’s had before.
“I dare you to finish your drink in one go.”
He pulls away so he can look at her face, though she’s blurry through his tears. He shakes his head, “But it wasn’t enough.”
“And it looks like he’s going to hurl.” Blaise leans back over the passenger seat and scrunches his nose.
“You’re just saying that cause you’re jealous.” Pansy says.
Draco quirks an eyebrow, “I thought you planned it so we could have the whole night to ourselves?”
“Honestly Potter. I think I recognized the shirt you were wearing when we went to Dominique from our 5
Draco shrugs and gratefully takes the drink from the waitress, “Nope,” again he lets the p pop. “I get drunk but it’s not enough, cause when the morning comes, he’s still not there.”
Harry blinked at Pansy.
“And again, they’re both single. Also aren’t they invited to most of the same weddings? Seems like perfect date material to me.” Avery backs Hermione up.
“He told me you were single again.” Dan steps next to Draco at the bar.
“Please,” Draco interrupts, “Let me say something.”
Harry follows Draco through the room, out of the double doors. He can feel the eyes on him, but he doesn’t care. He only has eyes for Draco. Outside, a taxi awaits. Harry slides in after Draco.
Draco arches his back, one hand grabbing the sheets. The other tightens in Harry’s hair, pulling, urging him on and begging for more.
“At your fancy boarding school?” Michael holds out his hands and Potter takes it, “I’m Michael.”
“Potter’s – Harry’s eyes widen.”
“Yes, yes I’ll find you an excuse. Now go!”
Harry opens the scroll carefully as to not damage the parchment. His eyes flash over the paper and his lips part in O. “My parents wedding certificate?”
spot behind Draco’s ear, it takes him over the edge. And Draco comes, moaning deeply.
Harry knows that he has to say something to Maurice but he’s only able to stare.
“I hate you so much.” Blaise stands up and hesitantly walks to Weasley.
“I know, but I’m busy with work right now. I’ll meet someone when the time is right.” Harry says.
“So, what are you blackmailing me with Nott?”
“But this isn’t part of your question, is it?” Draco asks hastily as he sees Harry starting to get up.
“How? Harry, you are the
“Guess you’ll have to go shopping again.” Someone calls Draco’s name and he starts to move towards them, but he turns at the last moment, “No
“I err, I guess you’re right. Where-”
“Yeah you are. You look like Greg after Pansy shagged his brains out.” Blaise snickers.
“Nonsense,” Pansy objects and starts pulling him away from his seat at the window toward the middle of the room. “You’re moping. And we’re going to play a game.”
Blaise laughs and orders his queen to take one of Ronald’s towers.
This, however, doesn’t seem to bother Dan. Because he starts the nibbling on Draco’s jaw. Draco tries to push Dan away, but he’s too drunk and stumbles. Dan pins Draco’s arms to his sides against the wall and presses his lips forcefully against Draco’s. Draco struggles, but he can’t seem to push Dan away.
“Draco,” Pansy takes a step towards him, “You can tell us. You know that right.”
“Oh, come on Draco don’t be a wuss.”Millicent sneers.
“Who has nice hair?” Harry asks from behind Draco. Draco spins in his chair. How much of that had he heard.
“Merlin Draco,” Harry picks up the speed of his hand.
“That’s not snogging!!” Pansy shrieks.
Draco doesn’t do anything but gape at Harry. He’s still here. He’s making him breakfast. Draco can’t comprehend anything about this situation. The craziest thing may be that Harry’s wearing a pair of Draco’s pants.
“You got me something?”
“Seriously?” Malfoy gapes at Harry, “Salazar, is everyone marring this year?”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Why don´t you do that then.”
“Great,” Ronald says smiling, “We were completely on the same line.”
“Now stop glaring at me from the great hall.” Harry says.
“An old suit he found a back of a closet” Avery points out.
Draco pushes his hand away, “No thank you.”
“It’s nothing Ron.” Harry says.
Wait, it isn’t a dream. This is really happening. Harry Potter is really kissing him. Making him feel all these things, not just in his head, but... Draco pulls away slowly, he really can’t get a hard on with all his classmates around. Harry gives him a shy smile and it makes Draco want to pull him back in and continue what did they started. They stand close, both breathing hard.
“Come on Ron,” Granger says, grabbing the red redhead by his arm and pulling him along out of the room, “Malfoy’s probably right. We should talk to each other.”
Harry flips Draco back on his back and Draco opens his mouth to complain. He was so close. But Harry crawls back over him and kisses him deeply and lingering. When he pulls back his green eyes burn and stare deeply into Draco´s. He softly pushes himself inside Draco, his eyes not leaving Draco´s. It makes Draco wonder if they could always be this close. And though he tried not to be the one to be the first to look away, when Harry finds that place that sets Draco´s blood alight and makes his entire body tingle, he turns to the side and gasps then moans loudly. Harry groans and buries his head against the side of Draco’s neck. Harry’s moans are muffled in Draco’s neck, but Draco just babbles out loud as Harry hits his prostate every time. “Yes! Harry, yes. More, more please. I – I need- Oh sweet Merlin. Yes, Harry, yes!” Draco comes with a scream and Harry groans loudly as he follows Draco over the edge.
Draco raises his eyebrow, “Except with you?”
“Thanks ‘Mione!” Ginny smiles and she and Luna make their excuses as they go to greet more of their guests that enter their quaint little cottage to the open double doors that lead to a field that serves as their garden.
“You mean, we’re both fucking hilarious.” Pansy says as she wraps her arms around Hermione’s middle and presses a kiss on her girlfriends cheek. Harry laughs.
“I’m not annoying. You are!”
“So, if you could please go away so we can get to it.” Draco says, slightly snickering at how red Weasley flushes.
With a curt nod Draco steps into the floo and disappears.
Draco laughs, still a little hoarse from the kissing that just transpired.
“Circe, this really
"Potter is the missing piece?"
Harry laughs.
“I do not want to get into her pants!”
“What? This?” Harry rubs his cock against Draco’s.
“Blimey,” Ron says sighing, “Only you and Harry are going to be the only single ones left.”
Harry looks up at Malfoy, his grey eyes not meeting Harry’s instead he stares at his fingers. Harry’s surprised that Malfoy told him anything at all. “You’re young to become a master healer.” Harry states, trying to keep the conversation away from their troubled past. Because he knows that will most definitely lead to some sort of fight, which Harry really doesn’t want. Especially not if they’re going to have to work together in the future.
the problem.”
“ It's does not like I had a choice or anything.”
Draco moans and nods then stumbles towards the bed toeing off his shoes and socks as he goes. He sprawls on his back. Propping himself up on an elbow looking at Harry as he undresses. When he’s completely naked he pounces on Draco. literally pounces. They kiss desperately, Draco’s nails digging in his back as he clings to Harry. Draco feels Harry’s cock pressing into his thigh through his trousers. And Draco moans in Harry’s mouth. Harry fumbles with the buttons on Draco’s trousers and when they pop open, he flips Draco over. Harry pulls Draco’s trousers and pants of at the same time. His breath ghosts over Draco’s back as Harry moves down.
Draco gasps, “You didn´t”
“No, I can't. I already stayed longer than I intended to do, but I couldn't help it when I saw the state of your wardrobe. I have an early day tomorrow.”
Seamus easily chugs his drink then turns to Greg to dare him to chug a bottle in one go. Greg in his turn asks Susan Bones who her crush is and surprise, surprise, it’s Potter. Draco throws his drink back in one go.
Draco hums and places his head on Harry’s lap.
Ron rounds the bookcase, “Hey ‘Mione, do you think we should check up on Harry?”
“Don’t forget jock.” Potter changes the subject.
Harry doesn’t care and pushes them further on the bed, till Draco’s head is resting on the pillows. Harry kisses him softly, tenderly and Draco relaxes completely under Harry’s touch. His nails digging into Harry’s bum.
Harry nods curtly, but doesn't bother to elaborate with words. Why would he? He looks Maurice over once more, expensive designer suit. Muggle surprisingly. But still, he seems very pretentious.
Though this eight year has, by some miracle, created a peace between the different houses, Draco knows that no one really
“No, but Malfoy was talking about how he wanted to suck Harry’s cock.” Ron’s says turning slight green again.
“I have an idea.” Millicent stands up and stalks towards Harry and Draco. She grabs a bottle of fire whiskey and spills a trail over Harry’s bare chest. “I dare Draco to lick it off.”
“You could have warned me Malfoy was in his bed.”
"Of course."
“As you probably know, I was raised by my aunt and uncle.” Harry explains, “And they didn't really like my parents or anything out of order or wizardingly. So, they made me help with chores, gave me my cousin Dudley’s clothes and made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs.”
“Then I’ll just have to keep hiding from her.”
Harry sneaks his fingers back inside Draco, and Draco moans approvingly into Harry’s mouth.
“We’ll we,” Pansy indicates between her and Greg, “are done seeing all three of you mope. So, what are we going to do about it?”
“I´ve been eyeing your bath since the moment I first saw it. It looked almost like the one from the prefect’s bathroom back at Hogwarts. You know I don´t have a bath like that at my place.” Harry grins cheekily.
Harry starts laughing, “I think we can find something. But first let’s eat some cake.”
“A kiss?”
Not allowing himself to second guess, Blaise leans in and kisses him softly. Ronald makes a surprised sound that sounds like,
Ronald’s face takes on that adorable frown that he always gets when deciding on the best move.
Blaise snickers and they both turn to look at Draco, he’s muttering at Greg and Blaise as he stares over at the Gryffindor table. Like he’s been doing almost every meal since first year. He doesn’t even bother looking down at his plate as he pokes furiously at his chicken breast and potatoes. The looks on Greg’s and Pansy’s faces show that he’s muttering about Potter again. Everyone knows that Draco has a crush on Potter, though he still pretends he doesn’t. Draco is just lucky that Potter is so bloody oblivious, because Theo suspects Hermione knows. Weasley might even know.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it?” Greg asks.
Harry grabs Draco’s hand, “But, what-”
“I am, want to bet?”
“I wanted to, -”
“Where are you going?” Michael asks as he steadies him.
“Honestly,” Avery comes down the flight of stairs, “It’s right here!” Avery is wearing a forest green dress that cuts at her knees and complements her red hair perfectly. Her hair is not the same natural red as her boyfriend but rather a bright painted red. She throws Harry a smile and rolls her blue eyes with obvious affection for her boyfriend as she walks into the drawing room. Ron bounces down the stairs, “Thanks babe!” He yells after Avery as he hops on one foot to pull the other shoe on. Harry rolls his eyes as well and follows Avery to the drawing room. He grabs his suit jacket of a chair and pulls it on.
Thank you for reading!!
“Hell yeah!” Harry smiles and undoes Draco’s trousers and shoves them down, they gather around his ankles. Harry snickers and walks backwards to his bed, “Come on then!” Harry climbs into Draco’s bed and shuts the curtains.
Harry snorts, “He was like that at school.”
“I’m not blackmailing you.”
Greg raises his hand, “What are we going to do once they’re all set up?”
“Truth.” Draco says as he lifts the glass to his lips and puts it down when he finds it empty.
“I know right.” Harry says with a smile.
“Uhm, well, we’ve mostly been studying,” Granger stammers, and Theo tries to hide his crimson face behind his glass. “But we’ve not only been studying.” She glances from Theo beside her to the other side of the circle where Weasley sits next to Potter and Finnigan. Who, in his turn stares down into his glass instead of meeting her gaze.
“So, you two got on in school than?” Dan wiggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“I need to talk to him first.”
Greg smirks.
“Why are you all on about Potter all of a sudden?”
“I've also ordered a suit for Luna en Ginevra’s wedding. Dominique will deliver it next week.”
Draco’s mug crashes on the ground again.
Draco’s unsure of what to do with his hands, but when he grazes his hands against Harry’s back, he hears approving sounds. Encouraged he grabs hold of Harry more forcefully. This seems to encourage Harry as well cause pushes his hips against Draco’s. As Harry’s hard on rubs against Draco’s he gasps and bumps his head against the door.
Like clockwork Granger looks up. “You find the homework difficult as well?” she asks.
As Draco bows down to untie his shoes, Harry’s pants land next to him. Now Draco stumbles in his haste to get out of his shoes, trousers and pants. But when he finally does, he pulls open the curtains and climbs into the bed.
Harry lingers a little longer near the fireplace before turning around. “Did Mister Malfoy leave, master?”
“Ok?” Harry asks, once he’s fully inside.
“Well, I can't, can I! He'd already killed my parents.” Harry is angry now too.
“Oh, come on Draco. I didn’t mean it like that.” Dan cups Draco’s face with a hand, “It’s just Michael promised me a good time. He told me you’re the type of guy who goes home with a man every now and then. And I mean, you’re hot. I’m hot. Let’s just have some fun.” Dan tries to pull Draco’s face closer.
“Okay follow me.” She seats them further at the back, away from the crowd. “What could I start you off with?”
Harry thought about storming off. However, he knew that Draco never thought Dan attractive and Harry glanced back against the pair by the wall. Now that he looked closer it seemed that Dan was literally forcing himself on Draco.
“Bossy.” Harry smirks, “but noted.”
“I- uh – I” flustered Ronald hastily makes a move, exactly like Blaise planned.
“I really do not want to know.” Draco says, raising a hand to his face.
Theo waits near the entrance of the library for Blaise. When he spots the tall guy, he urges him to follow him a bit further into the library.
“What? Of shagging Greg? I’m sorry, but he’s not really my type.”
Ron kept him up after work. He kept talking about how great it was that he and Ginny were getting back together. Harry just wanted to go to him, to Draco. He just wanted to go to his kitchen and cook a nice meal, while Draco sat at the kitchen table complaining about his work.
Hermione rolls her eyes. “Oh and Harry. Oliver is getting married, so you might be want to go to that wedding.”
He starts moving faster, and Draco moves his hips up, in time with Harry.
of June
“Well Ron’s older brother Charlie works and lives in Romania at a dragon sanctuary, so we went there and got a job. Ron loved it, but it wasn’t really for me.”
“I really do not need to know that!” Draco shouts after them.”
Draco hesitates on one hand he wants to take the potion and yell properly at Harry, until he begs Draco to take him back. On the other hand, he wants to throw the potion against the wall and make harry walk after him, begging for forgiveness. And he knows both are fantasies.
“Oh Draco,” Pansy gasps behind her hand. “Please tell me you didn’t let
Harry clutches his glass close to his chest. He feels out of place at Pansy’s and Greg’s engagement’s party. It’s still weird that he considers them friends now he has known for a while now that Hermione’s close to Pansy, but he still hadn’t expected to be invited to this party. Not after what happened with Draco.
“Well,” Pansy says, “I think you guys succeeded.”
“Because
They sit down next to each other and Harry places the salad in between their plates. “Carbonara or Bolognese?” He asks Draco.
Before Harry gets to respond the portkey hurls them away. When they land they hurry along a field to the wedding. Harry slides in a seat next to Pansy, “Seriously though Potter. What is this suit?” Pansy eyes trail over him, “If you can even call it that?”
“You’re the one Dan told me about!”
“Dan’s into everyone.” Potter says. “I think you should just go up there.”
“You’re sure you want to do that?” Blaise asks.
Potter has been ignoring Draco ever since this school year started. In the summer, after his trails, Draco went to Potter to thank an apologises to him. Afterwards they even exchanged quite frequent letters. Friendly letters. But when they got back to Hogwarts it all stopped and Potter started ignoring Draco. Which never happened before, not even when they weren’t friendly. It drives Draco mad.
When they tumble on the bed Draco pulls Harry on top of him. Harry trails kisses over Draco’s jaw down his neck. Over his chest, down to his stomach and –
“Some garlic bread and a bottle of water and” He glances over at Draco, “the wine list, please.”
“Also, I think my knowledge of German will be a great addition to the work force.” Maurice continues hesitantly when Harry doesn’t say anything.
“Err,”
“Well if I knew that, Potter.” She spat, “he wasn’t missing, now was he?”
He´s made his way through 4 boxes when Draco decides to take a break and eat his sandwich. He still has a lot more boxes, shelves even, to go, but if the aurors wanted their information faster they shouldn´t have send him alone he muses.
Blaise takes his time going back up to the common room.
“So, you like it then?” Draco asks.
“I trust your sense of style, Malfoy.” Harry says grinning, as he kicks off his shoes and steps out of your robes.
He doesn't even get halfway before Harry pulls him over presses their lips together. Harry kisses him eagerly his hands roaming over Draco’s body, trying to touch everything at once.
Wedding 1: Dean and Seamus 30
“We have a reservation.” Harry says. And Draco raises an eyebrow. He didn’t know Harry had planned this. It makes his stomach flutter.
“Marcus Flint.” Hermione says with a glint in her eyes.
“First of all, it’s way too expensive. Not all of us are as rich as the Malfoys. Besides I’d look utter ridiculous in those clothes.”
Theo nods and Blaise stalks off without another word.
“You’re always going on about how Malfoy is the only one who gives you a challenge. And you do like challenge.” Weasley supports his girlfriend.
Dan’s arm is slouched over Draco’s shoulder and he’s telling him some story about how his boss is a bitch. Draco wonders why in Salazar’s name Michael thought it was a good idea to pair Draco up with this man.
“You’re right. I’ll take you anywhere you want. I won’t keep you hidden away any longer. We can go to the best wizarding restaurants without any glamours. I’ll take you to the burrow for Sunday dinners. I’ll even go with you to the Manor to meet with your parents. And we´ll finally go on that holiday we talked about.” Harry sits down next to Draco and tangles their fingers. “Please Draco. I love you.”
Begrudgingly Draco does, scowling at Harry’s back. “What’s happened here?” Harry asks, trying for some small talk.
“Is that supposed to be an insult? Cause I don’t know what that means.”
Draco wakes up to the sound of an owl ticking on his bedroom window. He groans and forces himself to get up and open the window. His parent’s owl scoops in, a package in his claws. He gives it to Draco after several threats. The note is written his mother’s cursive handwriting.
They still, both breathing rapidly, trying to get their hearts to slow down.
“One night stands?” Pansy interjects helpfully with a smirk. “Merlin you’re just like Draco. At least you’re both handsome enough to still get laid when single.”
“With Potter? I don’t need help with Potter.”
Blaise looks at Theo, wondering whether he should feel relieved or guilty. In Theo’s eyes he can see the same question reflected.
“Why are you still wet?” Blaise asks when he pulls away after a snog.
hot.” Millicent’s voice wakes Draco from his dream.
Harry laughs and flicks his hand over their bodies. Draco feels a soft sensation of a cleaning charm.
“Well,
Harry plops down in between Draco and Blaise, and Draco’s heart starts beating in his throat.
“Can’t handle a little bit of skin?” Blaise smirks at him as he takes the bottle from Draco.
Greg starts laughing, “The pictures. I forgot about the pictures.”
“I’m sure everyone would like to snog Draco,” Pansy says, “but we can hardly all snog him. That won’t make the game anymore fun.”
Harry smiles brightly and pulls Draco on top of him, “I’m going to book it in the morning.” Harry promises before kissing Draco again.
“Draco?” Justin nudges him again, “Would you like some?” He hands out a bottle of fire whiskey.
Draco tries to stay positive, maybe Harry’s downstairs in the kitchen, like he was the first morning.
Draco shrugs.
There’s a picture of them walking with their arms around each other back from Draco’s birthday dinner at the Golden Dragon two days ago. “Because your glamour is shit.” Draco snickers.
“He’s gone missing? To where?”
“Why? What are you-”
“I do?” Theo asks still flustered.
All heads turn to her and Potter looks betrayed, “‘Moine!”
“Since I woke up alone.”
“What are you smiling about mate?” Ron and Avery come back from the dancefloor followed by Hermione who was dancing with her girlfriend who is now talking to Draco and Lavender Brown.
“She might set you up with Malfoy, mate. Bloody hell can you imagine.” Ron shudders and they make their way to their beds in adjourning rooms. When Harry lays into his bed he stares up at his canopy. He mulls over the information he has gathered about Draco Malfoy. Though Harry can’t say he would want to be set up with Draco Malfoy, or even be friends with him. but he can’t deny that he finds Draco Malfoy incredibly attractive. Harry shakes his head and turns on his side. He doesn’t have time for thoughts like this. No, he needs to prepare himself for his conversation with Robards and then after he’s settled at work. Then he can focus on finding someone to settle with. Someone who isn’t as confusing as Draco Malfoy. Someone sweet. Someone nice. Still, when Harry closes his eyes all he sees are Draco Malfoy’s dimples. And when he falls asleep he dreams about Draco Malfoy’s tattoos.
Harry shrugs and looks at Draco expectantly.
So, he packed his stuff, he couldn’t help but take the picture frame with the picture of him and Draco holding on to each other and smiling. And with on last glance at Draco, Merlin, her really is unfairly handsome, Harry left.
“Too nice hair.” Pansy smirks.
“It’s just an old suit that I found in the back of the closet. It’s the only thing I had.” Harry shrugs.
Malfoy responds with a simple nod.
“Oh, that doesn’t matter Theo,” Pansy says, falling on the couch next to Hermione, “She just wants you in those tight robes. Don’t worry ‘Mione, we’ll organise a game when the weather clears up. so, we can have a proper viewing.”
“Potter I swear, if you’re not going to fuck me right now. I might actually kill you.”
“I know you mister Potter.” Maurice says, and Harry doesn't invite him to call him by his given name. Fuck no. instead he just looks at him in anticipation of the riveting conversation lines like this almost always introduce. Maurice clears his throat. “Head auror, right?”
“Wait you’re the best man and you picked out the wedding dress?” Harry asks.
“Err,” Theo starts to pull away, but Hermione grabs hold of Theo’s shirt and pulls him in. Her lips are soft under his, she pulls him a closer to deepen the kiss. Theo obediently leans in and cups her face softly with his hands.
“I hate you.”
The golden trio gather round near the staircases to the dormitories and start whispering. Potter throws a glance in Draco’s direction. When he sees Draco looking, he hurriedly looks away and starts talking hurriedly at his friends.
“Wasn’t Robards offered the head law enforcement?” Ginny asks Hermione.
Draco chuckles at Blaise’s his gaping at Pansy and sips from his glass.
“I can’t find my other shoo!” Ron yells down.
“Harry,” Ron nudges him with his elbow.
“I´ll make sure l get off soon tonight.” Harry says smilingly before grabbing Draco close and kissing him soundly.
“Draco?” Harry lets his fingers ghost over Draco’s stomach, “Are you okay with this? Do you want this?” His fingers now trail over the zip of his trousers.
“Don’t open the curtains!” Harry shouts when he pushed Draco’s hand on the side.
“Do you need help getting over him? My offer still stands. I honestly think you’ve gotten even more handsome then you were before.”
“Nope that’s because my glamour is superb.”
“Well Pans, you weren’t there, but Draco wanted to pay his favourite game.”
Harry follows him and shakes Robards hand. “I’ll see you tomorrow Harry. At nine a.m., same place.” Robards says with a smirk. Harry smiles back, “See you tomorrow Gawain.”
Wedding 3: Luna and Ginny 15th of June
He all but runs out of the common room. Blaise sinks down on a chair, and flicks his want to gather his chess set, then sends it sailing back to the dorm. He stares into the fire. The kiss was amazing even better than he had anticipated, and Ronald even kissed him back. But still Blaise can’t help but think that he screwed up somehow.
“What the fuck Draco?! You take that back right now!”
“I was talking to Draco about it just now as well-”
“Huh,” Ron looks from Harry back to his girlfriend and back at Harry again. “But he was talking to Malfoy. What were you talking about?”
Draco fills his glass, downs it and fills it again.
“Why? Do we need some sort of special robes?” Harry asks.
Draco makes his way outside and Dan grabs hold of his arm and turns him around. Draco stumbles and his back hits the wall. Dan steps into his space. “I promise you Draco. I’ll give you the best shag you’ve ever had, and you’ll be over Harry in no time.”
“Sure.” Draco got up, “How do we do this.”
“Did you live together? Is he still there?”
Pansy pulls his empty glass from his hands and shoves in a new, full one. Draco huffs “I was actually thinking about going back to my dorm. Blaise is moping.”
An hour and some floo powder stains later he arrives at the office, where auror Johnson is hovering over his desk. “Malfoy.” He says briskly, “I need you to go to the archives and research potion accidents over the last 5 years.”
Ron looks sideways at Harry, raising an eyebrow.
“Don't tell me you bought me all these bags full of clothes.”
“I’m going to take a piss.” Draco shakes himself free from Michael as he walks towards the toilets. He only stumbles into one table and a chair.
“Because Dan’s fun, when he’s not trying to get into your pants.” Michael answers.
“Eager much?” Draco manages to ask before Harry’s lips crash on his.
Hermione jumps up and away from Theo, “I’m here Ron.”
“Why? Is there a reason you were bothering me?”
But instead of kissing him, Draco pushes his hips forward. Potter gasps when their cocks rub against each other.”
“Really?”
A couple of moves later Blaise has a little advantage again. And he knows he has to play it smart if he wants to win. He glances through his lashes at Ronald, “I have decided what I want when I win.”
“Wait.” Draco says stilling Harry with a hand.
“You’re marrying Parkinson?” Ron asks bemused.
“I swear Draco, I can make you feel so good.” Dan’s face closes in and Draco turns his head just in time, the world spins.
“Like what? Myself? Now you don’t like me anymore Harry. You’d rather be with your ginger bitch? Make ugly ginger babies? And-”
“Oh, you
“That’s because you buttoned it crookedly.” Hermione says as she starts unbuttoning his shirt and refastening it.
Draco opens his mouth to try and deny it again.
“Well, I’m black,” Blaise stats.
will go shopping otherwise you’ll just buy the same shirts again.” With one last sneaky look and a wave Draco walks away from Harry to the other side of the room.
"Potter."
“Are you okay?” Theo asks.
Harry drags Draco through the common room and up to the dorm. As soon as the door closes behind them Harry pushes him against the door. “I’ve been wanting to do this since Halloween. You looked so good in those blue robes.” Harry leans in and kisses him desperately, his hands braced on either side of Draco’s head against the door.
“No?” Blaise asks sweetly.
?” Draco’s given name doesn’t sound as strange out of his mouth as Harry expected it would.
Harry pulls something out of his pocket and with a quick engorgio enlarges it to his normal size. It’s a carton box. “What is it?” Draco asks.
“Avery?”
“I dare you to snog the bloke you fancy.”
“Blaise orders one of his pawns to slay one of Ronald’s, “Just confident.”
“You were only gone for a week.” Draco mumbles.
“Well, Harry isn’t doing anything.” Granger blurts out.
He takes a deep breath before knocking softly on the door. He pushes it open. Harry sits on his side of the bed, his back to Draco.
“I don’t follow.”
“Well you know how the Dragon reserve is a bit of England with in Romania, but not all Romanians are so happy about it and there was quite a lot of crime when we first arrived. So I’ve been working for the ministry, kind of err auroring about you could say.”
“Open up.” Harry urges him.
Hermione laughs, “How he lost it? Yeah I’ve heard that story multiple times.”
When they step out of the floo in the stuffy and dusty living room of Grimmauld Place Ron turns to Harry. “You better not tell Hermione that you’re other relationship was with Charlie and most of your one night stands were with blonds blokes.”
And now this, the front-page news
“No.”
Blaise stops near the double doors, turns around and raises his eyebrows. “So, spill.”
He swallows and realise that this is the moment he’s been waiting for. That he should lean in and capture her lips with his. But they’re in the library and Theo always judges others for kissing here. He’s judged Hermione and Weasley before. And Theo’s afraid, not necessarily of Weasley, but what will Hermione do when he kisses her. Will she kiss him back? Will she pull away? Will she slap him across the face, run off and never want to talk to him again?
“No Draco,” Greg says suddenly.
“I thought all the glasses champagne would be all gone by now.”
“That’s what I do.” Malfoy smiles at Harry, his grey eyes sparkling, “But why Romania? Why not France or Italy.”
“I know! Merlin, I know. But if you had the chance to save them wouldn't you have done everything in your power to do so?”  Draco blinks rapidly.
“It isn’t a contest Malfoy. Harry probably wants to talk to me too.”
Draco roughly pulls Harry in for a kiss, he can taste himself on Harry’s lips and it turns him impossibly more on. “For heaven’s sake. Why are you still wearing your clothes.” Draco grabs his wand that lay disregarded on the sheets and vanishes Harry’s clothes.
“Make me.” He says with a smirk.
“No? Not even you, pining after a straight ginger who’s in a relationship might I add.”
“Hey,” Weasley is clearly tipsy, “You need Harry?”
“I agree.” Draco encourages Michael.
“So you’ve become an auror after all.” Ginny says.
“You would've what? Been nicer to me at school?” Harry raises an eyebrow.
“Draco you know the Prophet always writes bullshit.”
“Maybe I was just trying to help you.”
“What?” Michael asks, “Unfairly handsome or incredibly vain?”
Merlin, Weasley seems to be licking Hermione’s neck. Theo’s stomach flips uncomfortably. Weasley should just go and do that to Blaise. He would probably melt into Weasley’s arms the way he hoped Hermione would do. Instead Hermione pulls away and says something under her breath, her face flush and angry. Weasley mumbles something and begrudgingly turns back to his studies.
Draco smirks.
“Seriously Potter?” Draco arches one of his perfect eyebrows, “The worst?”
“Arsehole! This isn’t a Slytherin thing, this is a Blaise thing.”
“You’re not wearing any clothes.”
Draco ignores Dan who saunters away. He blinks at Harry, “Why are you here, Harry? Why do you care? You left me. You broke my heart.” Draco says thinking of Pansy’s words.
my fault.”
Harry startles as the old elf stands in front of me, “Merlin Kreacher!” Harry says as he presses his hands against his chest, “Warn a guy will you. I forgot that you were here.”
“I didn’t read the shitty article, Potter.” Draco snaps. “That’s not what I care about, it’s that picture. I don’t know what kind of lunch it was for you if she only ate you.”
“It didn’t really last that long.” Harry says with a shrug.
“You’re not wearing that to the other weddings.” Hermione says looking over at Harry passed Pansy.
“Hey!” Pansy objects when she and Greg settle across from them, “What about us?”
“You actually look good Potter.”
Draco grabs a pair of trousers and shoes, and he tries to ignore the fact that the closet is half empty. He dresses himself and tries to stop himself from crying. Once he’s dressed, he stumbles to the floo.
of May.
“Why would I do that? It’s true. She only wants you now because her quidditch team keeps losing, even the Canons are beating her horrible team. And she
“How is McLaren doing by the way?” Harry asks changing the subject, acquiring after one of his injured aurors.
“Changing for our seeker game.” Draco says glancing over his shoulder.
Draco manages to throw a surprised look at Blaise just before Parvati stumbles into the hijacked charms classroom. “Couldn’t find an empty bottle.” She announces. A disappointed gasp sounds through the room.
Harry’s hand dips lower and wraps it about the both of them, making them both moan from deeply within. It only takes a few moments till Draco is spluttering a gasping. Harry following him suit.
Draco clears his throat and wipes his own wet eyes with the back of his hand, “You said that the first time.”
Harry gapes at him for a minute, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. “I can’t talk to you when you’re like this Draco.”
Blaise grimaces at him, "Don't blame your failed attempts with Granger on me, Nott."
“Draco? Draco are you alright?” Harry cups Draco’s face with both his hands.
“Yes, yes. Like that.” Harry whispers in his ear, “Merlin you’re so hot.”
Draco is putting on the kettle when someone knocks on the front door. No one ever comes through his front door; Harry always uses the floo. Draco closes his bathrobe tighter around himself and opens up the front door.
“Oh right, yeah I guess I have to get up on time tomorrow as well.” Harry stands up as Draco makes his way to the floo. At the last moment Draco turns back around to face him, they're suddenly very close.
“Millicent didn’t give us a choice either.”Harry protests in turn.
“Git,” Ronald says, his complexion clearing and a smile spreading on his face. Just like Blaise hoped he would. “I’ll be having nightmares for years.”
“No! ‘Mione don’t it’s totally worth it.” Pansy shrieks as Greg carries her off to the stairs.
“It was just a nightmare.”
Pansy sighs, “You know you can stay here for however long you want to. But at some point you’ll need to go back for your stuff.”
“You can’t just dare me to do things, the game’s called truth or dare.” Longbottom says, already standing up.
Draco spends the rest of the day on Greg’s and Pansy’s couch. She forces him to eat something but mostly just holds him.
Draco rolls his eyes, why can’t they just talk to each other?
Draco groans and settles further in his seat, his arms crossed over his chest.
“And black wins,” Weasley says smiling as he makes his own move.
“Why do you want a position in England, and not in Germany?” Harry asks.
When he walks into the cosy eight-year common room it’s still almost empty. Even though he took his time he’s still earlier than the quidditch players. So, he settles down on one of the lazy armchairs near the fire. He summons the table with the chess set. He places it between the 2 armchairs and puts the pieces in the right place by hand. He and Ronald have played a couple of games together since the start of the year in September. So far, they both have won a game and the rest ended at a standstill or took too long. Back in Slytherin dorm there wasn’t anyone who could compete with Blaise. Draco was the only one who came close, but still Blaise beat him almost all the time. Ronald gives him a challenge
kissed
“Nice to meet you too.”
Harry laughs and they hurry through the floo. When they stumble out in Pansy and Hermione’s apartment. “Good you’re here.” Hermione starts, she rumbles about and grabs an broken umbrella with a flower pattern. “Everybody hold on it’s ready to set off in about a minute.” They all hurry to hold on to the umbrella. Harry ends up between Pansy and Avery. “What are you wearing, Potter?!” Pansy asks Harry.
“I have not.”
“You told me he was handsome yes. Which is an understatement. And you told me he spend a lot of time and attention on his appearance,”
Draco just shrugs. He can’t tell them that the mention of Harry’s last name sends him right back to waking up alone in their bed. With his smell still lingering and his touch still ghosting on his skin.
Draco and Potter come pounding down the stairs. It took them a bit too long just to change.
“Two weeks,” Greg answers for him.
“Wow, this is really making me feel so much better.”
“Harry and Malfoy are in the showers.” Weasley says with a shudder.
Draco trails behind Potter.
“Yes, it was,” Harry agrees. He had to blink back his tears several times. Ginny and Luna had written their own vows and they brought most people to clutching their loved ones. Harry of course hadn´t had a loved one to clutch, still he was moved. It almost made him want to start working less to make time for dates. “Thanks” he says just before he takes a sip of the cool champagne. He needed this. He was becomming hot in his suit.
“But,” Potter tries.
“We’ve decided it will take place somewhere in June. That reminds me,” Ginny says, “Now you’re back we need to get you fitted for robes. ‘Moine?”
“Sure.” Harry grabs Malfoy’s upper arm, and with a turn of his heels Malfoy apparates them away. They land into a small alley and Malfoy leads Harry around the corner. Harry notices they’re in a muggle area as Malfoy leads them to a small café.
“‘Mione?” Weasley decides that’s the moment to run into the library towards them.
Hermione shoots Theo an apologetic smile. And Theo smiles back even though he doesn’t feel like it.
Blaise and Weasley are immerged in their game so Draco gathers his courage and looks at Potter, “So,”
“Yeah you were Malfoy. Merlin you’re so annoying.”
Draco’s halfway there when he hears a low voice, that’s neither Pansy’s nor Greg’s. His heart starts pounding rapidly, for a minute he thinks that Harry’s finally found him and is here to apologies and to beg him to come back to Cornelia street. But when he steps into the kitchen, his heart settles. It’s just Blaise.
“Maurice wanted to ask you a question about auroring Potter.” Draco says trying to fill the awkward silence.
Ron scoffs, “No way.”
“You too Potter get out of the way!” Pansy continues.
Dan leans in close, the alcohol clear in is breath. “It’s a pity though, you’re so pretty.” Dan walks away, towards the bar, a gleam in his eyes.
“Don’t be daft Blaise. You’re affections of the Golden Trio of course.”
“We just want you to find someone just like we have, Harry.” Hermione says softly.
“Blaise is not trying to find your weak spot, Draco.” Theo urges. “He’s into Weasley and needs you to distract Potter.”
“You’re still very handsome,” Dan says his face close to Draco’s.
“Oh it’s nothing Ron.” Harry says.
“You were all wrong about me.”
Draco, clearly very pissed, blinked at him. Eventually Harry got Draco away from Dan and gave him the spare hangover potion he’s been keeping in his coat pocket.
Blaise shrugs to himself when Draco’s ready to share, he will. And turns his attention back to the chessboard, Ronald orders his knight to a different position.
“Ah there he is,” Blaise grins. “I thought I lost you my friend.”
“What kind of pictures?” Blaise asks curiously.
“Godric this place is a mess.” A familiar voice says behind him. Draco turns around in his chair, “Potter?” he asks, “What are you doing here?”
I don’t know why you are laughing mate.” Ron says. “This means you’re the only one who’s still single.”
Draco nods.
“Draco?”
“Best man?” Ron manages to croak out when he finally gets his breath back.
For the first time, Harry walked away from a fight with Draco Malfoy. The words he spoke had placed doubts in his mind. Was he going to leave Draco to be with Ginny? Everyone who knows him best says so. Are they right and is he just as oblivious as the all always tell him he is? And if he is should he leave right now, before he hurts Draco even more? But he loved Draco. He did, didn’t he?
Since Ron and Avery have moved out to their own apartment near Diagon Ally, Harry hadn't expected to come home to someone. Especially not to Draco Malfoy. He probably should have when he answered Draco’s note with request of his floo address this morning, but it didn´t even cross his mind. Harry stands still staring at his living room and all the paper bags and his clothes that overcrowded the room, and the blond head in the middle. “Malfoy?” Harry asks.
Moreover, Draco Malfoy isn’t wearing wizarding clothes. Nothing at all even similar to the robes Harry thought the pureblood would prefer the wear. Instead Draco Malfoy wears a pair of dark blue loafers, a pair of dark blue skinny jeans that do amazing things for his long legs and pert bottom, and a white button down shirt. The buttons of the shirt are undone at the top, showing off the pale skin of his throat, neck and even the top of his chest. Harry can see the light reflect on the thin silver lines of scars there. The sleeves of the shirt are rolled up showing off strong forearms. His left arm seems to be covered in bright colourful tattoos. And even though Harry tries he can’t see what they are and if the dark mark is still visible.
“I thought Gryffindors were brave. Never expected you would refuse to complete a simple bet. But if you’re really afraid of a kiss.” Blaise shrugs, faking nonchalance, but his heart is beating fast in his chest. He’s been thinking about kissing him for so long and now that he’s so close, he doesn’t know how he’ll take it when Ronald turns away.
“Yes, well I hope I will.” Hermione says with a wistful smile.
“It’s less.”
“Why Greece?”
“Seamus,” Granger asks, “Truth or dare?”
The Slytherins should each other glances as the couple walks out of the common room.
“You broke up with me.” Draco says a little bit more forcefully, getting over the shock of seeing Harry again.
Draco begrudgingly takes another step away from Harry and sits down next to Blaise.
"He's been doing the same with Hermione."
“You couldn’t se the game at all?” Theo asks confused.
Draco hurries out of the apartment. It’s cold outside and the autumn wind tears at his clothes, before he apparates away.
“I’m leaving.” Theo says standing up. “I’m going to the library to hide from you crazy people. Hermione do you want to come along?”
“Well, you retaliated bloodily enough.”
“Oh I don’t know. We could go visit Hagrid at Hogwarts.”
“Draco?”
Harry didn’t know where to start, but he was still glad to be away from the party. With all those prying eyes and questions, he didn’t know how to answer. He went to the apartment on Cornelia street first, but of course he wasn’t there. Pansy would have checked it first.
Greg eyes him suspiciously, as Blaise continues talking.
Draco slips his hands under Harry’s shirt, his nails dragging over his back. “Bedroom?” Harry breathes. Draco grabs his wrist and pulls him up the stairs to the bedroom of Draco’s new 2 floor apartment. The first floor exists of a small hallway with double doors that lead to an open plan kitchen and living space and a staircase that leads to a big bedroom with in suite.
“Harry, can’t you just let it go?”
Harry knocked on Head Auror Robards’ door the following morning.
Draco interrupts him with a finger in the air, “But I get to yell at you.”
Pansy raise her perfectly groomed eyebrows at him, urging him on.
A young, smiling woman steps up to them, “How may I help you?” she asks cheerily.
Draco downs the potion, ignoring the foul taste. It takes a minute for the potion to work. And when it does Draco blinks a few times at Harry, before taking a deep breath. “What the fuck?”
“Then why exactly do I have to try them on?” Harry asks as he already starts unbuttoning his auror robes.
Blaise closes his book and places it on his nightstand, “Nothing special.”
They fall asleep like this. Pansy sleeps right through, but Draco’s flashbacks keep waking him up at least once every hour. Every time he closes his eyes images of him and Harry flash through is mind.
“I don’t know what you’re on about Nott.” Blaise says without looking at Theo.
“Why? Why now? You hid me away for months. We didn’t even tell our friends, I told myself it was because of the papers, but we both know that’s a lie. And then you left.”
Harry bites softly in his earlobe, “Shut up and get on the bed.”
“Seriously Malfoy? What am I supposed to wear now?”
“I hate all of you.” Draco says.
Weasley walks up to the table and the two big blokes bend over the tiny table inspecting the tiny pieces.
“Well, Theo needs Potter distracted so he can get into Granger pants.”
“On holiday.”
“But if one fits won't they all fit?”
for him to play with you. And then you all can flirt like mad. Any questions?”
“We’ll discuss it in the morning.” Pansy urges him up the stairs to the spare bedroom.
Okay, so I finished this earlier then I anticipated
“What name did you even put the reservation under if we’re going under a glamour?’’
“Yeah, well-”
“No,” Draco pulls his hand out of her grip, “Horrible idea.”
“Still, you had a big part in planning this wedding and found time to go shopping with me. Next to your very busy working schedule. If I’d known you were that busy I wouldn’t have bothered you with such a trivial thing”
“Truth or dare, Draco.” Daphne Greengrass asks agitated. She’s clearly asked it before.
Harry can’t help but smirk, “You’re the one who chose these clothes, Malfoy.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Harry stands up. “4 more.” He looks round the table. Michael and Draco both nod, “And buy some shots!” Dan shouts when Harry walks away.
“I’m sorry, but I-”
Harry mutters the lube spell and pushes Draco over. Draco struggles one foot from his pants and opens his legs wider, to make it easier for Harry. Who makes quick work of preparing Draco. Mutters the lube spell once more. Then pushes himself slowly into Draco. Draco grabs the sheets at the same time as Harry grabs hold of his hips. He finds a rhythm quickly and has Draco moaning his name in no time. The delicious friction between the sheets and his stomach make Draco come fast and hard.
“Yes. She was an auror trainee. Top of her class. She volunteered actually, wanting to go abroad. She’s now Ron’s fiancée.” Harry smirks.
Ronald just stares at him.
“I’ll just buy new clothes.”
When he finally found Draco, Harry couldn’t believe what he saw. Dan was pushing him up against the wall. Forcing his tongue down Draco’s throat.
Draco tries to hide his shaking hands and blinks back his tears. He was right. Potter did leave him for her. He feels his friends’ eyes on him, and shakes his head, “No-Nothing.” He stammers.
“I,” Draco hesitates not sure what to say.
Fucking Potter.
Everyone starts laughing even harder and Draco puts his head in his hands.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“That’s too bad.” Ronald moves from the bed and Blaise shoots up, grabbing one of Weasley’s wrists. “Where are you going?”
“What do you mean what am I doing? We were set up on a date, so I’m just hurrying along the steps. So I can take you home.” He leans back in and Draco shuffles further away, he almost falls of off the bench, “Err,”
“There was someone in Romania?” Hermione asks.
“Well Potter, it may be good for you to get acquainted with healer Malfoy, since you are going to be responsible for the aurors.”
“You tricked me! You fucking-”
“We’ve really been away too long, haven’t we mate?” Ron says as he hands Harry a bottle of cold beer. Harry nods, his eyes not leaving Draco Malfoy, as Ron continues. “I mean I don’t understand how they can be friends with the ferret.” Right as he says that Hermione looks up and spots them. Malfoy also looks their way, his and Harry’s eyes meet and Harry hurriedly looks away. Hermione says something to Malfoy who nods at her with his dazzling smile. Hermione walks away from him and bounces up to Harry and Ron. She throws her arms around Harry’s neck first and then around Ron’s. “I’m so glad you are back!” She exclaims, “When did your portkey get in?”
“Well not really,” Harry scratches the back of his head, “I finished my training in England, but I didn’t become an auror in England. When I was in Romania there was a lot of petty crimes that I started trying to stop it and made contact with Kingsley and Gawain telling them we should do something about it. They let me set up a little auror force, which was basically me and Avery, sometimes Ron and Charlie when we needed backup.”
“Didn’t you play a game yesterday?” Pansy says.
“What?!” Draco splutters, turning red. “I don’t want to get into Potter’s pants.” Draco hisses.
Oil drips on his finger as he stuffs it into his mouth. He stifles a moan, “That’s really good.” He says when he swallowed it.
“Go away? To where?”
“To talk about work Potter.”  Malfoy rolls his eyes like Harry is daft.
“Well, Ron and I,” Potter starts.
“About what exactly?” Blaise quirks his eyebrow.
“I did tell you!” Michael counters.
“Definitely,” Blaise grins one of his predatory grins and holds out his hand. Weasley takes it and they shake shortly.
Harry catches the paper, “This is a paper.”
“Trivial?” Draco places his empty champagne glass on the high top table next to them and crosses his arms sternly over each other, “Shopping for clothes is never trivial. Especially when you help such a hopeless case as you, Potter.” Draco smirks mischievously when he snaps Harry’s last name like he used to when they were kids.
“Are you waiting for it to seep into his crotch?” Blaise snickers.
“No, Greg, no!” Pansy shrieks, laughing as he lifts her up and buries his face in her neck.
Aah so they are sleeping together Blaise thinks as he says; “But where would be the fun in that?”
“Fuck off Nott!” Blaise rolls his eyes. “Meet me in the library after Divination and before Potions I have a study period.”
She pokes a finger at his chest, “You’re going to do your auroring and find him. Right now! Or I’m going to tell your new old girlfriend and your so-called friends what you’ve done to my best friend.”
“Well we saw each other every day. Writing letters seemed stupid.”
“This is a stupid idea,” Theo whispers back.
Harry breathes Draco’s name over and over into Draco’s neck. One of his hands sneaks down and wraps around Draco’s cock. After just a few strokes Draco comes undone. His eyes rolling back in his head and his fingers digging into Harry’s skin, Harry’s name on his lips. Harry gasps and stills as comes, his eyes locking with Draco´s. He presses a desperate kiss on Draco´s lip.
Theo smiles, “I would love that.”
“Dare.” Harry says without hesitation.
“Why? It’s not your fault.” She says with a smile.
“Pansy and Greg starts snogging instead. Draco tries to get away from them and bumps into Theo instead.
Harry’s moving his body against Draco and with his left hand he pulls Draco against him. His other hand is trailing across stomach, making Draco shiver. Pleasure surges through Draco every time Harry moves his hips.
“Yes, all of them.”
“You said you wanted to talk.” Draco grabs the cup without looking at Harry, “So talk.”
“And what was that?”
Theo and Hermione settled at a table in the secluded aria of the library. They’ve finished their arithmancy homework and are now quietly discussing which material they’ll need to study for their N.E.W.T.S exam.
“I do not have affections for any part of the Golden Trio.” Draco denies with his pointy nose up in the air.
Harry throws a dazzling smile over his shoulder, “I promise it’s a really great restaurant. Even though the place is a bit dodgy.”
The advantage Blaise thought he had vanishes when Ronald makes his next move. Blaise frowns, staring at the board. He has every attention on winning this game. He knows exactly what he’s going to have Ronald do, when he needs to collect his debt.
s when the day went to hell.
“Yeah you have. So why do you want to play nice all of a sudden?”
“Or something” Harry mutters.
Draco flinches and gets up. “I – I can’t do this right now. I, you. You have to give me time!”
Dan gets up, “Michael, switch with me. I want to get to know the date you promised me.” Dan flashes a wolfish smile.
“What?!” Draco asks at the same time as Harry lays down with his hands behind his head, a blush spread across his cheeks and on his throat.
Draco smiles brightly, this is turning into his best birthday yet. “What kind of restaurant?” Draco asks curiously.
“Kreacher is always here, Master Harry.”
Theo’s writing down the important ingredients of a swelling solution, when someone sits down in the empty seat beside him. Normally he hates it when someone sits down so close next to him, but when he looks up and sees Hermione, he can’t stop the smile spreading on his face.
“I’ll have the same and could we have a bottle of the Malbec from 1997 please.”
“I’m your best friend.” Greg grins.
"No, Draco is the missing piece."
“That we really are great friends, but nothing more.” Ronald’s smiling brightly at Blaise. “We’ve both known it for a while now, but it just took a chess game for me to really realise it.”
Draco smiles as he looks down at the photo, in its him and Harry hold onto each other and smile brightly. “I think there’s an empty picture frame somewhere.” He pulls open a couple of drawers before he finds what he’s been looking for. He puts the picture in the frame, “I’m going to get you my present now.”
Ron chokes on his beer as Harry asks, “Wedding?”
Potter steps into Draco’s space, “Shut up Malfoy!”
“Granger. Hermione,” Blaise looks at Hermione and she nods at him with a smile on her face. “Hermione wants Theo to play a quidditch games, so she can see how hot he looks in quidditch robes.”
“Yes, he sounds totally smitten.” Blaise says.
When Harry finally got home, Draco was already there. He was busy with the owls. Harry pressed a quick kiss on his neck and ran up the stairs to change.
Draco raises an eyebrow, “Any specifications?”
“But it’s fine really,” she continues, “We’re better off as just friends.”
Harry pulls him towards breakfast. They’re both barefoot in the kitchen and to Draco it feels like sacred new beginnings of something that will be the end of him.
“Oh, we did see the game.” Pansy says, “Blaise is just sad that he couldn’t get a good view at his boyfriends bum.”
“Go on Draco, lick it off before it dries.” Millicent urges him.
“You’re not!” Harry jumps out of the bed with renewed vigour.
Draco rolls on his side to face Harry, he’s unsure whether Harry plans on staying over. Was this an one off for him? Draco can’t imagine Harry plans on this being anything more than physical. Draco shivers when a cold gust of air brushes his skin. Harry grabs the sheets and pulls them over their bodies. It’s as if he can sense Draco’s insecurities, because he opens his arms, “Come here. I know you secretly love to cuddle.”
“Nott, shut your mouth!” Blaise says at the same time that Draco says, “The Weasel? The orange orangutan? Seriously that’s who you’ve settled on?”
“With rambling.” Hermione snickers, “You always do that when you start going off about something.”
“I know I’m to blame, but I don’t want to do this to you. And I don’t want to lose this, with you.” Draco sighs, “It’s not your fault the papers write constantly about you and speculate about your love life. But I’m highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you. And I realise your ex is still your friend and I shouldn’t have said those things about her. I was mean and wrong and I’m sorry. But I’m so terrified that if you ever walk away, you’ll go back to her. That you’re going to leave me for her. And I can’t, Harry I can’t live with that.”
“That’s not what I meant.” Harry laughs and when Draco frowns at him he explains further, “I meant this spending the day in bed. You and me intertwined. Eating take out and drinking expensive wine.”
“I don’t know. I haven’t been here.”
“We want to help you.”
Weasley grabs Blaise by his elbow and pulls him along to their own dorm, “I’ll tell you if it’s worth it ‘Mione.” He shouts over his shoulder.
“See, I do look ridiculous.” Harry sighs pulling at his cuffs.
“Me?” Harry says bemused, “but I haven’t been here in the last four years.”
“Are you doing anything tonight?” Harry asks as he rights his robes.
“Damn. Are you okay?”
Hermione looks up and frowns, “And how exactly do you think this is your fault?”
He smiles to himself as the players bustle inside the common room. Ron spots Blaise sitting with the chess set and raises his eyebrow in challenge. Blaise mimics his look and smirks. Ronald starts toward him, when Potter grabs his arm. “Ron, you have to help me!”
Theo nods, clearly relieved, “Sounds like a good idea.”
“I wasn’t enough. I tried everything Pansy. I really did. I kept it a secret because he wanted me to. I apologised after the fight and I-” Draco’s voice hitches. Pansy pulls him closer as she shushes him.
“But,” Harry continues before Draco gets to say anything. “most surprisingly was that this guy was my worst enemy, my archnemeses in school. And here he was in a place I never thought I’d see him, with muggles! Muggles. I thought he hated muggles. But then again I haven’t seen him in 7 years. So of course I’m curious to know what’s been going on with him.”
“Fine, we didn’t see much,” Blaise says with a pout.
“And Draco looks like Harry’s usual type.”
Sunday morning finds Blaise in the quidditch stands on the Hogwarts grounds. A book I one hand, though he doesn’t even bother pretending to read. A friendly quidditch game between the eight years is in full motion on the field. His eyes are trained on the hoops on the right side of the pitch. Ronald’s circling the hoops expertly. He hasn’t let a quaffle through yet. And though Blaise doesn’t like to play himself, he does enjoy making bets on the quidditch league. He likes looking at the game, trying to anticipate who’s going where and who’s going to score. Right now, though, he isn’t paying attention to any of theat. The keeper in Red pulling all his attention. He just looks so damn good, his broad shoulders visible as he circles the hoops waiting for the Chasers to come and try to score. His leg muscles tight around his broom. And when he bends over to speed up Blaise gets a good view of his ass. And that does things to Blaise. Salazar, he looks just so good. Blaise would love to get his hands on him. Or even the other way around, Blaise isn’t picky. He’s seen how touchy-feely Ronald can be. It makes Blaise jealous especially because it seems like Ron’s girlfriend doesn’t seem to appreciate all the attention, he gives her. But if Blaise can’t get Ronald to turn his attention to himself, he’ll just keep on looking. He picked this spot for a reason after all.
“Blaise realises Ronald is teasing him, but even that knowledge can’t calm the pounding of his heart or the fluttering in his stomach. “No, it doesn’t work like that.”
“To get into his pants.”
Harry dips a slice of bread in the garlic oil and gives it to Draco, “Here, try this.”
Draco narrows his eyes and opens his mouth to say something, but Harry beats him to it, “I'm sorry for stalking you, and I wasn't always the nicest to you either. I guess we were meant to be little pricks to each other.”
Harry nods and presses his lips together.
Michael pokes him with his elbow, “You never told me you were a jock.”
“And they seem to gravitate towards each other,” Avery continues ignoring Ron’s protest.
The box is filled with his favourite French chocolates, but Draco doesn’t have the appetite to eat any of them. Ever since he started his desk job at the lower levels in the Ministry his father has been telling him he doesn’t need to work. That he needs to find a wife and produce an heir. “You’re the last Malfoy,” his father would say, “You need to make sure that the Malfoy name will continue. Don’t waste your time on work that’s beneath you.” And Draco would stare down at his plate and excuse himself as soon as he could.
Potter lunges forward and kisses him forcefully on his lips. Surprised Draco gasps. Potter pulls away as fast as he kissed him. They stare at each other for a second then they both move forward and kiss each other desperately.
“What was that all about?” Weasley asks confused.
Ronald turns so red it clashes with his hair. “What? But I – I’m in a relationship.”
“Again, shut up!” Harry laughs. “Maybe the reporter saw me enter here.” He muses.
“Want me to enlighten you?” Blaise slowly closes the gap between them wrapping an arm around Ronald’s waist.
"Potter?"
“I err, we err. I don’t know?” Ron manages.
"He's staring back."
“Malfoy?”
Dan grabs Draco’s wrist, “And why the fuck not?!”
Theo hopes the library is the best place to ´accidently´ bump into her. He and Hermione have studied together here a few times. Well not really together but they sat at the same table and exchanged a few smiles. In arithmancy, where there´s no Weasley and no Potter, they sit next to each other and make assignments together. When it´s quiet in the common room or they had a particular hard assignment, they study together. But in the weekends Hermione tends to spend most of her time with Weasley. However, Theo hopes Blaise was able to occupy Weasley so Theo can spend time with Hermione and try his flirting skills.
“Well no, but.”
“Is studying really all you and Theo have been doing in the library?”
“You don’t get it Pansy. I won’t! And I’ll never date anyone else again. Never again.”
Harry smiles and presses his face into the crook of Draco’s neck.
“In bed he won’t let me open the curtains. Why are you looking for him?”
“Anything you want, love. I’ll give you everything.”
“Nonsense, darling. Everyone else can enjoy seeing you in something nice for a change at least as long as it takes to open the rest of the gifts. Besides, you wouldn’t want to hold up the proceedings now would you? Of course not.”
“I don’t just want to take you to bed. It’s more than that. I want..I want everything with you, Draco. I’m all in. You’re it for me. You always have been, really. Just took me awhile to get there, is all. What do you think?”
“For fuck’s sake, Harry, you’re making me dizzy just watching you. You already know I want to shag you rotten. What are you working yourself into such a lather for?”
“Fourth year?!”
Harry’s eyes widened as he realized what had just happened, and he choked out in shock, “Draco, did you just dose yourself with
When Ron had given him the envelope, and he’d read Malfoy’s name on the slip of paper he’d found inside it Harry’s immediate response had been panic, but he’d squashed it down desperately in an attempt to waylay any sort of comment from Ron. He didn’t know how successful he’d been, but he hadn’t blurted out the name at the very least. Harry’s problem was that his rather unhealthy obsession with Draco from sixth year had only gone underground while he was dealing with all the madness of what should have been his seventh year at school, and then the Battle had happened, and..well.
, Draco’s train of thought was cut off abruptly by Harry’s arms tightening around him.
His control snapping at last, Harry pulled out and flipped them, rolling Draco onto his back and hiking one of his legs up over Harry’s arm. Holding him open like that, he entered him again swiftly, which had Draco crying out and scrabbling for purchase against the bed covers as Harry began pounding into him relentlessly. He saw Draco’s cock stirring and slowly filling out again under the onslaught of sensation, and the blond was keening and incoherent at that point, eyes wild as he met Harry thrust for thrust.
“Potter, it’s bloody cold out here! Let me in already, or do you make a habit of having your guests hang about in the doorway? Honestly..”
“No, I like it. I like..everything you’re doing. More of it, please, and preferably horizontally sometime in the near future if you would be so kind.”
“Yes.”
A throat clearing nearby jerked his attention back to his task, and he flushed guiltily before hastily scooping up several handfuls of sand and mounding them together to start shaping the wall he was meant to be building. He avoided Millie’s knowing look and Luna’s softly amused smile both by studiously focusing on attaching his tower to what was shaping up to be a rather sprawling structure that perhaps appeared castle-ish if one were feeling generous. Harry sighed and finished the wall before being sent off with his bucket to collect seashells and other beach detritus to decorate the ‘castle’.
“Ginevra, there was a
With a low growl, Harry swept his arms down and forward through the water in an arc, quite effectively drenching Draco with the huge splash he sent his way. The blond cursed and spluttered, wiping his eyes and slicking back his hair with both hands before lunging for Harry and shoving at his shoulders while hooking an ankle around one of his and setting him off balance enough to force his head below the surface. After a few seconds, Draco let him up, and they continued to wrestle playfully for a minute before breaking off and trading splashes and calling half-hearted insults at each other amidst the laughter that kept bursting out of both of them throughout the exchange.
“I would’ve asked you out to dinner like a
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes, but the twitching of his lips gave away his amusement as he buried his nose in Draco’s hair, nuzzling gently before placing a soft kiss to his temple.
At that, Harry stood up, chin jutting upward defiantly as he met Draco’s gaze evenly. Amusement lurked at the corners of his own mouth and in his eyes as he toed off his shoes and yanked his shirt over his head and tossed it aside before delivering the now expected response.
He reinforced the threat by palming his own length with a hissed inhale, loving the way Harry’s eyes devoured the motion as if it were the most enthralling thing he’d ever seen. In short order Harry was naked and crawling across the bed until he was atop Draco. Smacking Draco’s hand off his own cock, Harry kissed him hotly as he replaced it with his own, fingers curling in a loose fist around it and starting to pump it slowly. With a sound like he was dying, Draco arched up into the touch, fingers scrabbling on the sheets as he sought any kind of purchase. He broke the kiss to gasp for air before moving on to exploring the expanse of Harry’s neck with his lips and tongue.
Harry pulled back a bit both to catch his breath and to consider his next course of action. He searched Draco’s face for a moment before seeming to come to a decision and squaring his shoulders. Feeling the mood shift from playful to serious, he braced himself for whatever Harry was about to say.
“I wanted to have a rational discussion about this for once in our lives, but no, you had to act like a bloody child and avoid me all day. More fool me for assuming that you wouldn’t take the coward’s way out! But that’s fine. That’s just
“Are you sure, love? There’s no rush. We can—”
He stared up at Draco, his gaze hot with hunger as he switched to the other nipple and reached between Draco’s legs at the same time to palm his shaft through his clothes, stroking firmly. The blond cried out softly and arched into the touch, fingers clutching at the duvet as he bucked his hips mindlessly for a while. Harry was in no hurry and would’ve happily continued to tease Draco for longer, but the other man was losing patience fast. He watched the awareness slowly spill back into Draco’s face and gave a low noise of protest when he was made to pull off and instructed by Draco in a haughty, demanding tone to strip and lie down on his back.
A smirk curved Draco’s lips as he shrugged out of his coat and handed it over, watching as Harry hung it on a coat rack just by the door before heading deeper into the house and toward the kitchen. He answered in the affirmative and followed the other man at a leisurely pace. It wasn’t the first time he’d been here, but it
And before Draco had time to even get his bearings, Harry had shifted to the side and flipped Draco onto his stomach. When Draco gave him a slightly wild-eyed look over his shoulder, Harry chuckled and smoothed his hands down Draco’s sides, fingers making soothing little circles as they drifted further down.
“Come on, baby..come f-for me. I want to see it, Draco.. Oh,
“My hero, as usual.”
these things?”
, gods, please. Harry, please!”
I can only revel in every
Blaise got up and moved down to an empty spot beside Neville on the other side of the table, taking his plate with him and then passing back the empty one that had been at the other setting. Harry flushed red but sat down in the vacated chair and quietly started loading his plate with food. Most of the conversations had trailed off at this point, and Hermione and Ron were staring at him hard, expressions knowing. He pretended not to notice, but Draco glanced over at him, sighed, rolled his eyes, and offered him his hand, palm up under the table.
He deeply regretted not listening to that voice mere seconds later when the door to the cupboard was unceremoniously yanked open, and a small circle of their friends peered in at them. Draco had broken away from the kiss with a startled gasp, his lurch backward only halted by Harry’s grip on the back of his robes. Theo whooped and darted away before Draco could so much as twitch forward, presumably off to share this delectable little piece of gossip before anyone could stop him. Draco growled low in his throat, eyes narrowing as he started plotting his revenge, mind racing silently with plans.
His shoulders sagged a bit in relief as he made it to the shop he’d been heading for. It was one he frequented quite regularly, and he was relieved they were still willing to accept his custom. La Maison Sorcier was run by a forbidding older wizard who could’ve been anywhere from 40 to over 100 for all Draco could tell. The man hadn’t changed one whit in all the years the men of Draco’s family had been coming here for their suits, and at this point Draco seriously doubted he ever would. The man himself swept up from the back just as Draco was coming in and brushing a few errant flakes of snow from the shoulders of his cloak.
“There, that’s better. Now, to cover all our bases. Yes, Draco, there was a bet, and Ron is right, Ginny, you were off by three days from the looks of things. Greg won. And honestly, I don’t know why you’re surprised with this lot. Did Harry tell you
Harry! Yes! Yes, if you don’t fuck me soon I think I might expire, but first I want to suck you.”
being difficult? That’s rich coming from you!”
Harry had blown up at all their friends and slammed the door in their faces, also conveniently rendering them alone in the broom cupboard together. Again. There was some snickering outside of the door and what sounded like an indignant tirade from the Weasel, but a gradual shuffling seemed to indicate an exodus away from their cupboard before Harry slapped a silencing spell up, effectively cutting off any further noise and also guaranteeing they wouldn’t be overheard.
Draco gave a deep-throated moan as Harry set to with a great deal of enthusiasm and an equal amount of skill. It wasn’t long before he was writhing in place, hands clenching into fists as his legs started to shake. Harry gave a pleased rumble before nibbling lightly at Draco’s rim and flicking his tongue across the sensitive flesh there. Harry then brought his tongue to a point and drove it into Draco’s hole, which caused Draco to howl and utter a string of curses in quick succession as he canted his hips back and tried to take Harry deeper. Harry groaned and pressed even closer, hands caressing the globes of Draco’s arse as he continued to thrust his tongue in and out in a steady rhythm.
Licking his lips with nervous anticipation, Harry did as instructed, propping himself up a bit on Draco’s ridiculous mound of pillows by the headboard and watching as Draco slid out of his own clothes and crawled across the mattress toward him. He didn’t think he’d ever been this hard in his life, and he was slightly afraid that he might lose it within the first few seconds of Draco touching him. He needn’t have worried, however, because now that Draco was taking the lead, the blond had every intention of making this last.
Draco’s eyes flitted up to Harry’s hair to emphasize his point, which was in its usual messy bun while he was at home. Nevermind the fact that the blond had complained bitterly the last time Harry’d gotten fed up and had it cut high and tight on the sides and in back and barely left enough of a fringe to obscure the famous scar marring his forehead. It had amused Harry enough that he hadn’t cut it again after that, instead managing the wild, untamable mass by tying it back as often as possible. He did like pleasing Draco, after all, and if his lover liked combing his fingers through Harry’s hair while they lounged about at home or even better tightening a fist in it while they.. Well, he’d put up with both the cracks about it being unmanageable and the extra time it took in the shower to wash it if it made Draco happy.
“Of course, ‘Mione. I made sure he took it, I swear! We just got cut short because Robards needed to see him about something or other.”
She graced him with a fond look as she answered.
“Draco?”
“I want to touch you, Draco. May I? God, the things I want to do to you…”
Harry, I swear to you if you don’t-
There was a story there, and Draco was determined to get it.. just, later. Right at that moment the fact that Harry Potter was touching him was distracting him from nearly everything else that was going on. He’d wanted this, wanted
That last bit was a rather obvious ploy to redirect her attention, and she gave him a withering look to let him know that she saw right through him but had decided to answer him anyway.
Hannah Abbott had looked up at that and nodded a little, looking thoughtful.
Draco’s tone was a bit incredulous, and Harry arched an eyebrow at him, stealing one of Draco’s own usual facial expressions in response. The other man’s tone was half exasperated, half amused.
“Yes, I’m sure, you pillock. Do you want me to beg?”
“Do continue, little helper. Though I can’t imagine what could top this one this year, hm?”
“First of all, that is none of your business, second question, same answer, and third, yeah, I suppose so since it kept everyone from having to listen to you and Nev going at it like rabbits all week. No offense, Neville.”
The next morning they woke up curled around each other, warm and content. Draco insisted on a joint shower, and this time Harry happily took him up on the offer, which cost them an extra half an hour. Thank Merlin for magic and hot water that never ran out. Clean, dressed, and sated, they descended to the main level of the house at last and joined everyone in the dining room where breakfast was already well underway. Draco slid into the chair next to Pansy and reached across her to grab the granola and start making himself a bowl with that and some assorted fruits also within easy reach.
So saying, Harry pulled him into another deep, lingering kiss. They continued on in this fashion until they were both breathless and at the end of their patience with the limited options being pressed up against the kitchen counter presented them, so Harry laced his fingers with Draco’s and led him back down the hall and up the stairs to his bedroom. Pushing open the door, he scratched the back of his neck in a nervous gesture and stammered out an apology for the mess.
When I dream of fire,
She smiled at him over her shoulder when he grimaced but muttered an apology just as she tossed the powder into the flames and stated her destination as her office at the Ministry and vanished in a whoosh of green flames.
“Is this the part where I’m supposed to thank you for gracing me with your presence? Because if so, you've got a long wait ahead of you.” Harry poured them both a cup of Draco’s preferred Earl Grey (he kept a tin especially for his visits, not that he’d ever admit it) and carried them over to the table before taking the seat across from Draco. “I was in the middle of a new landscape, you insufferable prat.”
“Sorry about that. You okay? Seemed like what she said really bothered you, and I might’ve..overreacted a bit.”
He was knocked out of his feverish musing by a familiar drawl that was even more drawn out than usual and tinged with more than a little annoyance.
“—biscuits?”
His eyes widened as the heat that he’d previously believed was only an external problem abruptly coiled tightly in his midsection. He fought the familiar sensation coursing through him for a few minutes, startled by the fierceness of the need that assailed him. Because that’s what it was, arousal. And the thought that had sent it flaring through him so intensely was of Harry. Merlin help him.. Draco’s lips parted on a gasp as another, stronger bolt of pure lust shot through him, causing his cock to thicken in his trousers and sweat to bead at his temples. He gripped the arms of his chair, trying desperately to get a hold of himself, but the image of a naked Harry, wet and soapy from the showers (a very old and very frequent favorite of his many fantasies), wouldn’t leave him.
He blinked and returned his attention to what Toussaint was saying about waistcoat options. Draco narrowed his eyes thoughtfully and nodded in agreement on the number of buttons but shook his head when the other man suggested a print. No, Harry wouldn’t fancy any frippery. Simple, elegant lines would do for him, and Draco said as much as they moved on to colors. Black, he thought. Maybe a touch of green here and there, just the tie and the pocket square, that would do nicely. Or perhaps a bow tie? The thought made Draco’s lips twitch at the corners as he bit back a smile. Oh how Harry would hate that. Yes, a bow tie would do nicely. He wanted Harry to like the gift, of course, but he wouldn’t be Draco Malfoy if he didn’t yank his old nemesis’ chain just a tad. The green would do that, too, but it served the dual purpose of setting off Harry’s eyes.
Luna graced Ron with a warm smile and nodded, picking up the thread of her story as if nothing untoward had occurred. Ron listened attentively while stuffing his face with his mince pies, and Harry forced himself to focus on Luna as well. He wasn’t sure quite how much time had passed, but before long his plate was empty. The three of them had moved on to discuss how each of their respective careers was going, and Harry was trying to steer it more toward Ron and Luna since how he felt about his own time in the Auror Corps wasn’t something he was really keen on discussing just then. Thankfully he was granted a reprieve in the form of Malfoy calling for everyone’s attention and suggesting they move on into the parlor for the main event.
Eventually he’d convinced himself he was being ridiculous and had managed to fall asleep. His alarm had jogged him awake with barely enough time to make himself semi presentable before he’d grabbed the present he’d spent a painstaking amount of time wrapping so carefully even Ron and Hermione would have had a hard time believing it had been Harry who’d managed something so neatly done and high-tailed it out the door. And that was how he found himself here, in Malfoy’s ridiculously huge house, eating delicious food that had no doubt been provided by an army of house elves, and fretting over when lunch would be over and everyone would make their way into the festively decorated parlor to open the presents they’d set under the massive Christmas tree.
“It couldn’t wait, no, but I’m not in trouble. Relax, Potter. I’m here because of my Secret Santa present. Care to wager as to why that is?”
“Now Hermione, I’m sure Harry’s got it under control. I’ll keep an eye on him. You know I’ve got his back. How’d it go with Malfoy? Did he buy it?”
might throw a more scandalous event than Slytherins could, which had caused Harry to snicker into his folded arms, but then it got about a million times better when Parkinson dropped her scowl, trading it for a lethal looking grin instead as she added her opinion to the whole thing.
The concern in Harry’s voice warmed him from the inside out, banishing the rest of Draco’s irritation. He replaced his cup on its saucer and favored Harry with a fond look. The other man couldn’t fail to notice, and suddenly it was Harry’s turn to blush. Draco decided the time for playing coy was past. He might not have a Gryffindor’s courage, but he had Slytherin ambition in spades. When he wanted something he went after it with a single-minded focus that worked just as well.
“Well it was beyond obvious you got me! Who else would dress me up like that? You’re such a posh wanker, do you know that? And
“Heed me, young Malfoy. Your,” and Toussaint held up a hand to forestall any protest, and Draco closed his mouth with a snap as the man continued, “Monsieur Potter is quite something. Worth this declaration, non?”
Harry was tired. He’d been up for what felt like half the night, utterly distracted by the fact that Draco was sleeping mere metres away. Harry had nearly swallowed his tongue when Draco came out of the bathroom after his shower, bare except for the towel wrapped around his hips. His gaze had first snagged on the soulmark on Draco’s chest, a messily scrawled
We’re doing this. Okay.”
Harry moaned raggedly when Draco’s teeth grazed a particularly sensitive spot behind his left ear, and he muttered a continuous stream of commentary as one of Draco’s hands teased his hard cock in turn, nimble fingers rolling the foreskin down and using the pre-come beading there to slick the shaft before gripping it firmly and tugging to match Harry’s own quickening pulls on Draco’s length.
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t know why you’re being so difficult about this. It was random. Pansy and Ron were both there. And Harry’s easy to shop for, so you have nothing to complain about. You really shouldn’t have said, you know. It takes the fun out of things. Now stop whinging and take your envelope. I have to head back to the office.”
Chest heaving with his sharp intake of breath, Draco didn’t have to be told twice. Harry moaned his approval as the other man grasped him by the hair and guided him back onto his cock. He swallowed him down and let Draco take the lead as he relaxed his throat and closed his eyes, relishing the tugs to his hair and the flex of Draco’s hips as he started to thrust. Harry’s own cock was aching, hard and straining against the zip of his jeans, but he kept his hands on Draco’s legs, idly caressing him as the other man took his pleasure. Harry also liked to wait for it.
But Draco didn’t make any move to accuse Harry of anything. In fact, he barely acknowledged Harry for the rest of the visit. Flummoxed, Harry finally managed to slink off and change back into his casual clothes once everyone was settled into conversations speculating who’d gotten who and how the annual reveal would go at their also traditional New Year’s Eve gathering. He wasn’t especially nervous about hosting. He had plenty of room, after all, but he
Slouching into a chair at the breakfast nook, he ate his leftover curry (along with an extra helping of guilt; Draco knew it was one of his favorites) and fretted over how the hell he could possibly fix this without completely ruining his friendship with Draco. He’d basically announced his interest in the other man to all and sundry at breakfast, and he couldn’t very well take it back now. Shoving away his empty plate, he groaned and ran his hands through his hair in an agitated gesture.
Harry’s eyes widened, and his mouth went dry at both the use of his given name and the very thought of being naked in the water with Draco. The blond had bent down to peel off his socks and tuck them into his shoes before straightening and locking eyes with Harry, a challenging little glint in them as his lips curved into his patented smirk.
“Look at you, just covered in my spunk. You love it, don’t you, gorgeous?”
With a beleaguered sigh, Harry assured her that he would make sure he’d stocked his liquor cabinet to her approval and missed the return of the picture to Draco’s hands. He glanced over just in time to catch him looking at him, however, and he could only pray that he wasn’t blushing. He shifted nervously before he caught himself mid-motion, and he saw the other man’s eyes narrow thoughtfully. Shit. Harry was doomed.
“Your present? No, I can’t..I mean I don’t… Umm, do you want more tea?”
of your fingertips against
Both their faces bore similar angry looks at the memory, but Ron shook his head and continued on.
A shudder of anticipation wracked Draco’s frame, but Harry was already loosening his grip and carding his fingers gently through his hair again, every now and then massaging Draco’s scalp with his fingertips. He sighed in contentment, limbs growing loose and heavy as sleep started to steal over him despite his wishes to the contrary. He managed to mumble part of a reply, his words fumbling and slowly dwindling entirely as he drifted off.
“So! Soulmates united at last. Wondered how long it would take you to ‘fess up. You’re welcome for the room-sharing, by the way. But the important question here is, who kissed who first? Did you have a nice time last night? Good thing there’s built-in silencing charms on the rooms, eh?”
the contrast of the dark
Harry took it without missing a beat, lacing their fingers together and switching to his other hand to bring his toast to his mouth as if there were nothing out of the ordinary occurring. Pansy put her head in her hands, and Ginny was the one to finally break the silence that had settled over the room.
“Oi, you did not! You said they’d be shagging within the first two days. We’ve been here nearly a week!”
His hands came up to cradle his own face, hiding from the reality that the sharp, insistent tugging at his core was making apparent. If he’d dared to look up he might’ve seen a mirrored expression of shock on the face of the man across from him. His once upon a time childhood nemesis, Savior of them all, now revealed to be his
You’re so bloody sentimental the Hat should’ve Sorted you Hufflepuff. Are you sure it wasn’t confused? Can one Confund a magical artifact? Hmm..”
“You have on entirely too many clothes.”
Harry was positive he heard the word “cow” among Draco’s grumbling as he passed them without so much as a glance toward Pansy when their prickly host handed off the first gift to a chortling Blaise. As was tradition, they waited for each person to open their gift and let everyone see what it was and offer comments before moving on to the next one. After Blaise’s much admired pocket watch, it was onto Neville, who got a very nice pair of dragon hide gloves that were spelled with enchantments designed to protect him from some of the nastier magical plants he worked with in the greenhouses at Hogwarts, having taken over for Professor Sprout when she’d retired the year before.
“Is it not enough that I opened my home to you lot, provided a fabulous luncheon, and graced everyone with my company? No, I’m to play Santa’s little helper as well because apparently no one else is capable of reading labels on packages!”
“I figured it was welcome what with you kissing me and all. Should I apologize?”
And so Harry was stuck. They weren’t enemies anymore, but Malfoy still kept him at arms-length, still called him
“Now that we’re all settled, why don’t you do the honors, Draco?”
Harry growled and gave Draco’s hips a squeeze, shifting so that he pressed against the blonde in a hot, slow glide that had Draco moaning and forgetting his train of thought.
It wasn’t unpleasant, though, far from it. Harry swallowed, at a loss for words as the reality of their position sank in. Cheeks flaming, he prayed that it was too dark for the other man to tell, and he released Draco’s wrists and was about to move off when Draco lurched up, grabbing Harry around the middle and heaving him over till he’d rolled Harry beneath him instead. Unbearably smug now, Draco grinned down at him and tapped Harry’s chest with one slender forefinger.
Ron broke in from across the table.
“It’s exquisite, Monsieur. It came out even better than I imagined. I couldn’t be more pleased.”
And when Draco obliged him he shuddered, hips bucking in tandem with Draco’s own thrusts. Draco let out a little whine when Harry paused in his litany to kiss him hard, tongue mimicking the motion of their lower bodies. It was deep and wet and everything Draco’d ever imagined kissing Harry would be like, only a hundred times better than any fantasy because it was
“And if
He bit his lip, voice wavering just slightly at the end, feeling a bit vulnerable with the admission. Harry’s expression softened at the tone, and he reached out with his clean hand, cupping Draco’s chin and tilting his face up so he could press a gentle kiss to the corner of his mouth.
“Since you’ve dragged me out of my warm, comfortable bed for no good reason, you ought to at least make it worth my while. Let’s go swimming.”
“Shut up. You love it.”
that sat directly over his heart. His attention had lingered on the Sectumsempra scars, before dropping down and finally settling on the light trail of blond hairs that started at Draco’s navel and trailed down to vanish beneath the white terrycloth of the towel. He wasn’t entirely certain whether he should’ve been grateful for its presence or not. That was until a throat clearing had caused him to jerk his gaze up, meeting two very amused grey eyes peering at him from across the room.
“I win, Potter. I demand a prize for my efforts. Pay up, or suffer the consequences!”
“I’m not delicate, Potter. You can give it a good tug if you like. I want you to fuck my face, so don’t act all shy now.”
Draco sighed and flopped down beside him dramatically. Harry’s eyebrows went up as he continued to watch him, expression bemused, yet fond. The other man copied his pose, leaning back on his hands and tilting his head up to look at the sky.
“Thanks, Pansy. For putting up with all this. And for the advice, too. I’ll think about what you said. Have a good night.”
Meticulous as always, Draco undid the bow and slowly peeled the spellotape loose so as not to rip the paper. That he folded and set aside neatly before opening the box that took up most of his lap and was balanced carefully on his knees. Folding back the tissue paper that had been tucked over top of whatever was inside, he looked down to see..
Hermione went to take the frame in hand to get a closer look to see if there was a signature on the drawing anywhere, and Draco’s grip tightened reflexively for a moment before he forced himself to let her have it. It was
to give at eleven due to
Once the dust had settled and he’d finally had a chance to figure out what he was going to do with the rest of his life he’d discovered that maybe the excitement of being on the run wasn’t half so intimidating as the daunting task of living in the aftermath. Headmistress McGonagall had offered all of them an eighth year at Hogwarts to complete their education, and while Hermione had jumped at the chance, Harry and Ron had both opted for an abbreviated course that allowed them to take their N.E.W.T.s and go straight into the Auror training program.
Harry could feel himself getting close, and he growled as he canted his hips at a slightly different angle and drove forward again, searching..searching. There! Draco screamed his name, followed closely by several choice expletives as Harry’s cock found his prostate, and he proceeded to keep up a steady assault on that spot, coupled with the quickening pulls of his hand on Draco’s cock. He could tell by the desperation on Draco’s face and the way his body was beginning to tense that he was almost there, and he just needed that little bit extra to push him over the edge.
“Does this meet with His Majesty’s approval, then?”
And so the peace was kept, and everyone carried on with their various beach activities, one of the highlights of which was a volleyball tournament that ended when Ginny sent the ball hurtling into the distance with a wildly overenthusiastic spike, and no one could find it despite an extensive search. Harry secretly thought it was really because people had given up in favor of the lemonade and snacks that Luna had brought down from the house, but he was hardly complaining at that point. He was thinking about that afternoon now that he was safely ensconced in his four-poster for the night, idling over the memory of the way the sunlight had glinted off of Draco’s hair.
less important than me. How rude.”
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed off of Harry as he got to his feet and kicked off his shoes before slowly tugging his shirt over his head and tossing it down carelessly.
“And they say Gryffindors are supposed to be brave. Nevermind the fact that I looked for you for bloody
Taking a deep breath, he drew closer and walked slowly around the display so that he could take the whole thing in. He was almost unaware of Toussaint’s scrutiny of him while he took in all the fine details of the suit. In truth, he was caught up in imagining what it would look like on Harry and nearly startled when the other man cleared his throat and arched an eyebrow at Draco in a blatant display of amusement at his expense. Blushing hotly at being caught out, Draco jerked his eyes from Toussaint’s, to the suit, and back again before responding.
But Harry had a feeling that Blaise’s discretion only went so far, and this beach getaway would be the perfect opportunity for some Slytherin meddling. Sighing, Harry muttered a drying charm for his hair and moved into his room at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place in order to dress and then begin packing. Stuck in a house with not only Blaise, but Draco, Pansy, Greg, Millie, Luna, and the Gryffindor lot for seven whole days and nights? It was going to be a long week.
Before Harry could voice a protest, Draco kissed him once more, soft and sweet before pulling back to continue.
By the time he’d heard Draco leaving their room, Harry had been awake for quite some time. Sighing as the door clicked shut, he sat up and peeked out of his curtains to make sure Draco was really gone before shoving them open and dragging himself to his feet. Making his way to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his face, he peered into the mirror, which told him his hair looked a fright. With an irritated growl, he flicked a silencing spell at it and took care of his morning ablutions before pulling on some clothes and reluctantly heading downstairs for breakfast.
and the light of our skin.
“Our friends are terrible. We’re going on vacation alone next time.”
“Ha-arry.. I wan-want..oh sweet
The mumbling faded away as Harry moved closer, arms going around Draco and holding him firmly as he turned his head and pressed his lips to Draco’s palm. This of course caused Draco’s face to heat, cheeks going pink even as horror at what Harry’s words implied struck him full force. Had he meant that his
Draco huffed and slumped back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest and settling into what promised to be a spectacular sulk. After a few minutes of terse silence, he picked up his tea and drank it (but certainly not because Harry had said to). Harry sipped his own tea half-heartedly and kept stealing little sideways glances at Draco, hurriedly looking away again whenever he thought himself in danger of being caught at it.
“Ouch! You arsehole, that hurt! What do you want, then? A parade? A medal? Shall I call the Prophet and put an announcement in?”
He winced at the low growl he got by way of a reply and briefly debated fleeing for his life before his Gryffindor courage rose to the fore and propelled him further into the room.
, of all people. Nevermind that he found Weasley tolerable (and a menace who regularly thrashed him at chess) now. Back then he’d envied their friendship quite keenly.
“Gryffindors. Insufferably sincere, the lot of you.”
He watched as Harry finished fussing with the teacups and turned toward him, placing one squarely in front of Draco before picking up his own and sipping slowly. Blinking down at the offering, Draco took the cup in hand and took an experimental sip. It was perfect, just enough sugar and a splash of milk.
Draco grumbled a little at the loss of Harry’s fingers inside him but was quick to respond as he flipped onto his back and reached for the other man to tug him closer.
“Even after all these years he still seems a bit surprised to get anything. It’s enough to break your heart, that is. Mum always sends him extra fudge, bless her. She about had kittens in second year, remember? When me and the twins told her those awful Muggles were starving him?”
He couldn’t suppress the needy whimper that escaped him when Harry wedged a thigh in between both of his and began to rock Draco against him with an encouraging squeeze from the hands grasping Draco’s hips. Harry broke the kiss to nuzzle along the line of Draco’s jaw until he reached his ear. Teeth nipped at his earlobe lightly, and Draco gasped, a shudder going through him as he clung to the other man, mind whirling at how quickly things had progressed. Not that he was complaining, mind. He was already painfully hard from just a bit of kissing, but he wasn’t too terribly embarrassed by it when he could feel the evidence of Harry’s reciprocal desire digging into his hip as the other man murmured into his ear, voice husky with need.
more than a bit worried about the reveal, for obvious reasons.
Draco angled his head just enough to glare up at him with one eye, but Harry knew his heart wasn’t really in it despite the huff that escaped him. He continued on unabashed.
When he made it back to the parlor everyone was slowly gathering their things and making their goodbyes, so he joined in and barely got a chance to thank Draco for hosting before he was swept off by Hermione and Ron as they made for the nearest apparition point. They had to pick up their daughter Rose from the Burrow, and he had decided to apparate with his fine new suit tucked into its box under his arm rather than risk an incident going home by floo. He’d never managed to be graceful coming out of it, no matter that he’d been doing it for twelve years now. Some things never changed.
Blinking slowly, Draco stared at the other man wordlessly for what felt like several minutes but was likely only seconds of silent consideration before his chin went up and his shoulders went back, nostrils flaring as he (finally) rose to the occasion.
“Potter, you better not skimp on the good stuff. You’re hosting New Year’s Eve. I have a feeling we’re going to need more than butterbeers and lager this year.”
He’d been sat beside Draco that night. Draco remembered that quite clearly because Pansy had taken the piss at both of them when she’d made a rush to push Harry down next to him and then encouraged everyone else to take up the rest of the space so they couldn’t rearrange themselves. The bint. He’d been wound tighter than a drum for the first hour with the hot line of Potter’s thigh pressing against his in the booth, but eventually he’d gotten a bit of liquor in him and had loosened up and even considered thanking her for it later.
“I forgive you. It’s done with. Are you coming down to breakfast?”
Smirking triumphantly as his fingers closed around the quill case, he pulled it out and shut the drawer again before settling in for a morning of paperwork and chocolates, courtesy of his partner. He unwrapped the box and popped one into his mouth before picking up one of the files he’d retrieved on his way into the office. Brandishing his quill, he set to work. Harry constantly moaned about this portion of the job, but Draco was meticulous when it came to their paperwork and rather enjoyed it, though he did still make Harry fill out the bits that were relevant to him. Draco wouldn’t have a case getting thrown out due to someone arguing that he had falsified information on a case file. Even this long after the war there were still those who automatically mistrusted the name Malfoy, and he’d give them no excuse to question his work ethic.
Harry tightened his grip on the back of Draco’s neck before letting go with a curse and taking over from the other man stroking him. With an eager little hiccupping whine, Draco leaned forward just as he began to come, the first few streaks splashing across his chest and shoulder before Draco could position himself to catch the last two spurts against his chin and cheeks, eyes tightly shut to prevent any mishaps. Harry rubbed the head of his cock against Draco’s lips, and the other man opened for him, lapping wetly at the tip for a moment before Harry had to pull back as it became too sensitive.
“Oh fuck, Draco! That’s so good. You’re so good. I..ohh, shit. God, don’t stop doing that. Jus-just..uhn, harder!”
“Maybe that last one a bit, yeah. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go and pretend I didn’t just humiliate myself in front of you and all our friends if you don’t mind.”
His grip on Harry’s cock tightened briefly and then went slack as he fumbled over his request, and the other man released his earlobe with a wet pop before shifting so he could look Draco in the eye, his own fist slowing on Draco’s length but not stopping entirely as he replied.
Draco claimed the bathroom first, but once they were both clean and safely clothed from the waist down, at least (Harry in another pair of clean joggers and Draco in silky pyjama bottoms, though he’d forgone the matching top, the posh git), they settled down, Draco sitting on his bed and Harry pacing nervously in the space between their four posters. After an odd half dozen loops back and forth, Harry felt Draco’s hand close around his wrist, yanking him to a stop in front of the other man.
He licked his lips and noted the way Potter..oh blast it all! The way
“If I knew this would’ve shut you up so easily I would’ve done it ages ago.”
Grinning mischievously, Harry bit Draco lightly on one arse cheek only hard enough to leave the lightest impression of his teeth. When Draco’s hips stuttered and a guttural moan slipped past his lips, Harry laughed again and carefully withdrew his fingers as he replied.
Draco silenced him with another kiss, this one slow but just as heated as before, and he cupped Harry’s arse and squeezed it roughly. Harry melted against him with a low moan, but before it could go much further, Draco broke the kiss and released him, stepping back, his expression showing how much the effort must have cost him.
A stream of muttered cursing caught Harry’s ear as he was passing the door to their bedroom, so he paused and poked his head in to see what had Draco in such a snit. His boyfriend was sitting in front of the vanity, glancing from the mirror, down to a book he had open in front of him, and back again. Those long, elegant fingers Harry loved so much were buried in Draco’s hair, which normally fell to the middle of his back but was currently half done up in what looked to be a complicated sort of braid gone wrong. A hand mirror spelled to float behind the blond shifted this way and that as Draco turned his head in an attempt to see where he’d missed a plait.
Harry’s laugh rang out, bubbling up from deep in his chest, but he wordlessly summoned a jar of lube and caught it easily when it came soaring out of his night table drawer. Coating one hand with lube, he worked first one, then two fingers into Draco in quick succession and started pistoning them in and out, occasionally scissoring them gently to open Draco further. Draco was already fairly relaxed from the rimming, and it wasn’t long before he was demanding that Harry stop being such a priss and give it to him already, all the while pushing back eagerly when Harry added a third finger.
Harry hitched his bag higher on his shoulder and followed in Draco’s wake, down to the last door on the left. The blond was already unpacking his things, having laid claim to the bed closest to the bathroom. Harry brightened a bit as he realized that this left him near the window and tossed his duffle onto the bed and began digging through it for the smaller bag that held his shower kit. Then, kit in hand, he made for the bathroom to put everything away while Draco was still fussing with arranging his clothes in the dresser nearest his bed.
“I wonder the same thing about you and all those sweets you manage to pack away. Do you have a second stomach hidden somewhere, maybe?”
Merlin, Harry, you! Only you!
“I’ll take chocolate, like anyone with sense, thank you. Who eats plain shortbread biscuits?”
He felt Harry turning them both slightly as the other boy shielded him with his body and glared at the rest of the small crowd surrounding the door. Harry’s chest rumbled against Draco’s with the force of each word spitting out of him, tone bristling with anger and a thread of something else. Protectiveness, maybe? The cupboard door banged shut again, propelled by a burst of magic that could only have come from Harry. Draco could feel it, the way it swirled and pulsed around him, humming with tension from the Gryffindor’s emotional outburst.
It certainly had nothing to do with the budding crush he’d developed on Harry in their intervening years at school that manifested itself in a ridiculous rivalry and a constant need to get Harry’s attention by any means necessary. No, never that. Nor had he any need to continuously dismiss said non-existent crush when they’d worked out their differences in their 8th year at school, nor during Auror training, and certainly not when they’d been assigned as partners after they’d graduated to the field. He was content with what they had. It would be the height of foolishness to wish for anything more, and Draco Malfoy was no fool (that unfortunate business with the Dark Lord notwithstanding, of course).
Harry needed no further urging, and they both trudged through the water and up the beach to retrieve their clothing and make their way back to their room with all the stealth they could muster. Thankfully, they encountered no one on their way, and once back in their room, Harry had to decline the idea of a shared shower. He laughed at Draco’s pout, but he knew that if he was naked with the other man for any length of time, the idea of talking before they went any further than kissing would fly right out the window.
He made a face, as if the very thought was offensive. Harry scowled at him but pulled out the box of chocolate ones anyway and arranged them on a plate, which he set down in front of Draco before turning away to take the kettle off the heat and pour as he answered.
Draco stared at him, one eyebrow arched in clear disapproval of Harry’s method for silencing him. Harry flushed and hastily removed his hand, sitting back down and clearing his throat before continuing, “Okay. So. Er.. how-how long have you felt this way? Wait, you don’t have to answer that.” He put his head in his hands. “It feels wrong asking you things because you can’t control what you say. God, Draco, did it really have to be Veritaserum? Trust you to go over the top with everything.”
Do that again!”
One corner of his mouth curled up in a fond grin, Harry obeyed and eased out a little before rocking himself back in. He set a slow, deep rhythm that had Draco arching up to meet him, a needy whine building in the back of his throat. When the blonde was clawing at his back and hissing at him to go
“Come on, Harry. Give us a little fashion show, why don’t you? I’m sure your benefactor would want to know that his or her gift fits, hm?”
“Don’t even think about hogging all the counter space in there, Potter. I know there’s a double sink, and the one closer to the bath is
He startled, his back bumping into the doorframe as his head whipped toward the noise. Harry swallowed as he peered into Draco’s pinched face. Oh, he was in for it now. Harry’d seen that look before, and frankly, he’d rather face another Hungarian Horntail than have this conversation. But then he remembered all the teasing over the last few days, the way their banter always danced the line between friendly and flirting lately, and how much that had confused him and made him ache for things he thought he couldn’t have, and Harry started to get angry, too. Jaw firming, he straightened and strode into the room, coming to a stop beside the large island in the center of the kitchen and stared the other man down.
Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, chest squeezing painfully tight as the image of someone else in Harry’s arms flashed across his mind before he squashed it back down with a vicious jab. Lips pressed firmly together to stave off anymore senseless jabbering, he looked over to meet Toussaint’s knowing expression. When the other man spoke again, the teasing lilt was gone, replaced with frank advice.
He blinked and stared at Harry blankly, finally managing a weak, “Yes, Harry?”
Was it just him, or was this cupboard getting smaller? Harry swallowed nervously at the thought and shifted in place. Malfoy must’ve caught the look on his face, read more there than just embarrassment at being in there with
Draco’s answer was prompt and matter of fact. It was also woefully short of any kind of explanation. Harry set his cup down with an audible click, and his next words nearly exploded out of him in an exasperated rush. “What the hell did you do that for?! It’s dangerous! Get up. We’re going to St. Mungo’s. Of all the ridiculous—” Draco cut him off mid sentence, his answer causing Harry to freeze halfway out of his chair.
That thought brought him back to himself with a jolt, and he broke the kiss despite the keening noise Draco made as he tried to pull him back in for another. He shook his head, but he was smiling as he did so, instead pressing soft but fervent kisses along Draco’s jawline before nuzzling behind his ear, lips catching along the delicate shell of it as he murmured to him.
After that it was Ron, who was quite chuffed to open a quaffle signed by his favorite Keeper from the Chudley Cannons, and then it was Pansy’s turn to make a rather large show of how pleased she was with her advance copy of “Jeunes Génies de La Mode”, which she was featured in for her rather explosive career as an interior designer for the rich and famous. Harry had made enthusiastic comments for each and had laughed particularly hard when Ginny made a clever quip about Neville maybe keeping all of his fingers now that he had those gloves, but as each present was opened and the pile grew smaller and smaller he grew more anxious for the moment that they would all be gone and Draco would get to his own gift. It was
At some point Harry had gone from gripping his robes to wrapping his arms around him and pulling Draco flush against him from shoulder, to hip in one long line down their bodies, and Draco was having a rather difficult time hiding the fact that he was
He could get used to this, Harry in his arms, the delicious groans that tugging on his hair elicited, all of it. Draco broke the kiss with a sigh and hid his face in Harry’s neck, pressing even closer to the other boy, a smile curving his lips as he brushed them slowly along the warm line of Harry’s throat. If this was where party games got them, then maybe they weren’t so stupid after all. Harry feathered a light kiss against Draco’s temple, his pulse thrumming against Draco’s lips.
“Oh fine, stop looking at me like I kicked your crup, and I’ll translate to Gryffindor, so you don’t miss it this time. He loves you, too, so just bloody
Sighing, she rubbed her temples before relenting slightly at the hurt look on his face. Voice gentling, she switched tactics, reaching out and patting him a bit awkwardly on the knee.
“You’re a crap Legilimens. How do you just
When they’d tired each other out enough to call a truce, Harry closed the distance between them, smiling as he reached out without thinking to sweep a stray lock of hair out of Draco’s face and tuck it gently behind his ear. The other man stilled, gaze locking with Harry’s. They stood there like that, the moment stretching between them, and it was Draco who broke it first, surging toward Harry and wrapping an arm around his waist to haul him closer, the other hand fisting in his hair as he kissed him fiercely.
Draco’s fingers loosened in his hair but didn’t withdraw. As he calmed, Draco stroked through the wild curls slowly, and when they’d both caught their breath, Harry looked up at him with a warm smile. He felt Draco tugging him upward and carefully stood but was arrested part of the way by Draco’s mouth seeking and claiming his own while the fingers left his hair and instead crept down to join Draco’s other hand in undoing his flies. Harry groaned into the kiss when he realized what Draco was up to, nodding his approval as his jeans and pants were shoved aside just enough to free his cock from their confines.
Flushed and more than a little worked up at this point, Harry still couldn’t quite bring himself to give in to the temptation to give Draco what he was asking for. This brazen display was so unlike him that there had to be more going on here. Brow furrowing, he managed to wrench his gaze away from his partner to take in the rest of the room. At the sight of the open box of chocolates on Draco’s desk, it suddenly clicked into place. “Shit, it’s the chocolates.”
“As if he didn’t have enough on his plate! That’s the third time this week, and it’s only Tuesday! I’m about ready to march down there and give that man a piece of my mind! The nerve of him after everything Harry’s done for—”
If there’d been any doubt that Draco was blushing before he was definitely doing so now. Even the tips of his ears glowed pink, and his voice was slightly strangled as he stumbled over a reply.
“Find your pride, Monsieur Malfoy, and perhaps a bit of that renowned Slytherin cunning, and I am quite sure you will manage.”
“You want my opinion on something that required you to show up at my house at midnight the day before Christmas Eve? Malfoy, what’s going on? Are you in trouble? Do you need help?”
the first time without any of the rest of their friends along. When they got to the kitchen, Draco settled himself at a stool behind the island and watched Harry move about, putting the kettle on and getting out cups and saucers almost in a daze.
Draco’s head came up at that, and he glared at Harry fiercely over his shoulder. But he still choked out an answer when Harry merely smiled and raised his eyebrows at him.
But why hadn’t it happened before? Why
He let perhaps two minutes at most pass before lifting his hand to do so again when the motion was interrupted midway by the door jerking open and a rumpled looking Harry Potter blinked out at him owlishly.
Harry looked at him like he thought Draco had completely lost the plot.
Draco snorted and rested his head on Harry’s chest, allowing his eyes to drift shut contentedly as Harry stroked his back absent-mindedly. They were both on the edge of sleep when Harry whispered into the silence, his voice low but firm.
those shoes. So naturally she’d have to go.
And then there’d been Ginny and the way they’d left things at the end of sixth year before he’d gone off Horcrux hunting. Harry had felt paralyzed with guilt over the fact that while he’d missed her, it had been her friendship he’d missed and not so much the kissing or the fact that she’d told him she loved him. That part actually filled him with a sick sort of dread, and when she’d finally cornered him at the Burrow one day during the summer after the Battle he’d braced himself for the fallout.
Draco was currently draped over Harry’s lap, stark naked, hands tied rather artfully behind him with a length of black nylon rope specifically suited for the purpose. He was also blindfolded, though Harry had forgone the gag this time, he’d said, “because I want to hear all those pretty little noises I can wring out of you, love.” Just the memory was enough to make Draco shudder with want, though at the moment he had no need of a reminder when his bottom was still quivering slightly, the sensitive skin hot to the touch and bright red from the spanking Harry had just finished administering.
It crumpled to the floor in a forgotten heap as Harry kissed him and turned him about, steering him toward the bed ‘til the backs of his knees hit the mattress. Harry drew back then and looked at him carefully, hands settling on Draco’s belt buckle and pausing for permission. At Draco’s nod, he slid it out of its loops and then made short work of the fastenings on his trousers before shoving them and his pants halfway down his thighs in one go. Draco groaned and pushed at them, wiggling his way out the rest of the way and kicking them aside impatiently before sinking down onto the bed and sliding along until he could recline on the mound of pillows at the headboard. Pointing at Harry’s joggers, he ordered imperiously.
“You can come, darling. I want you to. Do it for me now, yeah? You’re so beautiful when you let go, Draco.”
This was met with a dark chuckle as Toussaint circled him, giving both him and the suit an appraising glance before drifting over to the mannequin and launching into an explanation of how he’d brought the sketches they’d poured over to life. Draco listened with rapt attention, nodding and humming appreciative responses in all the right places. The man was a genius. The least Draco could do was pay court for a few minutes. Then with a calculating glint in his jet gaze, the tailor switched topics, catching Draco completely off guard yet again.
Several hours and quite a number of sketches later Draco and Toussaint had settled on a design. After finalizing everything and settling his tab at the counter, Toussaint told him he could have it ready in a fortnight, which suited Draco perfectly. Donning his cloak, he nodded a polite farewell to the shop owner and braced himself for the trial of once again heading out to navigate through the holiday crowds. All he knew was the look on Potter’s face when he saw his gift better be worth all this trouble. He couldn’t stop himself from smiling a little as he pictured Harry with his mouth flopping open and shut like a fish. Yes, something like that would do quite nicely.
He mumbled the last bit and stuffed a bite of eggs into his mouth before Hermione could question him further. She eyed him pensively before turning to nudge Ron on her other side and started another low voiced conversation with her boyfriend. Harry groaned internally, aware it was him they were discussing but knowing it was pointless to try to put them off. Instead, he focused on finishing his breakfast and making half-hearted attempts to keep up with the flow of conversation around him.
A weak-voiced ‘none taken’ was heard from beside Blaise, who, far from being offended, was laughing madly at Harry’s retort. Pansy was also looking rather impressed and had started clapping part of the way through. There was an outbreak of giggling around the room before everyone finally settled back down, and order was restored. Ginny had crept back into her chair and started chatting with Luna and Millie, and Draco only gave her a cursory glare before leaning into Harry’s side and murmuring in his ear.
Harry blinked up at him for a moment, his expression clearly stating that he thought Draco’d gone round the twist, and he said as much.
I’m about to ask this, but obviously neither of you is fit to handle it on your own. You admitted you fancy him, so what’s the hold-up?”
“I was thinking and wanted your opinion on something.”
, of all people. A fidgety and flushed Malfoy who was pressed entirely too close to him in the cramped confines of the cupboard. And why the hell was there a broom cupboard there all of a sudden, anyway? Well, aside from the fact that the Room’s purpose was to provide people with what they needed. Harry huffed at the idea that any of this was
His cock throbbed where it was still sheathed inside Draco’s tight heat, and he groaned a little, closing his eyes and working to keep his breathing deep and even as he replied, his voice strained.
, had captured him in a moment of joy, and then gifted it to him knowing that eventually he’d be revealed. It was so..so Gryffindor of him. Draco swallowed and stood, gaze stuck on the picture for a moment before he gently placed it back in the box and darted to his room for a coat. He didn’t care what bloody time it was. If Harry wasn’t awake he was about to be.
Unbeknownst to him caught up in his fit of pique as he was, both Pansy and Hermione had appraised his reaction and shared a knowing look before giving each other the smallest of nods. Pansy then rose gracefully and took Harry in hand, even going so far as to make him do a little walk about so everyone could see him in his finery from all angles before ferrying him back to their settee and settling back down though Harry protested this with a weakly voiced,
