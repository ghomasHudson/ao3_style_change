"Fred and George are arranging a late New Years Party so it'll be perfect to escape from everyone then." Harry nodded.
"Oh?" Draco said in surprise. He raised an eyebrow. " You know that Umbridge would shut it down in a second if she knew about that. How do you run it? How do you keep it a secret?"
to attend Hogwarts!" Malfoy picked up another rock and through it directly onto the ground and it bounced towards the lake.
"Why don't you go first?" Ron snorted. Harry elbowed him in the ribs, and Ron hit him back in protest.
"I mean his dad's a Death Eater, he probably learned loads of stuff about the dark arts from him. I mean have you even met Malfoy, he's down at Knockturn Ally every Tuesday, I swear." Ron reminded her.
"The Quibbler? You have got to be joking. We publish it there and we loose all hope of people believing Harry." Draco shook his head.
"I found this, and I decided you should have it. It will keep you safe." Luna said dreamily. Draco kept it in his hand, pressed to his chest.
Harry felt wary about it, but he trusted Draco. Mostly. He hesitated before opening the door for Draco.
Mrs. Weasley came to check up on Harry as often as she could. She constantly asked Harry why they wouldn't stay with them. Harry always told her that it was how he coped with Sirius's death.  That he needed to be there, to find out more about him. And that was partly true. Mrs. Weasley would tell him it was unhealthy. That he needed to be around other people.
the reputation. He was also a favourite of Umbridge's even though Draco despised her. Harry knew there would be uproar if Draco Malfoy joined the DA. But he trusted him now, he wanted him to be a part of something this important because Draco was his friend.
It was Tuesday, the day of Harry's party. The last day. Hermione put a few spells on Draco. So that people didn't see how ill he looked. How thin, how gaunt, how pale.
"I know this is because i told you i loved you. Can't a man love his best friend?" Draco said fiercely. Harry came to a realization on what he was talking about. The lake.
As Harry lingered on these thoughts, Umbridge took notice that Harry had stopped writing and was only staring out of the window.
When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Draco straitened his posture and went to greet the three of them.
But Harry couldn't avoid the pair forever. Especially considering Neville, who although has shown great improvement, wasn't doing too great against Draco. He realized that Draco kept stunning Neville before he could even cast out a spell.
Harry wondered how much trouble they'd be in if Professor McGonagall  found out they had snuck a Slytherin into the common room.
In the room was a door that emitted light from the bottom crack. His palms were sweaty and his heart was racing. He heard voices coming from the other side.
"I'll search for one with you. I'll find one and I'll fix this. I won't give up. I promise I won't give up. I need to fix this" Harry breathed heavily.
"You do realize centaurs travel in herds. If they all come attacking us, Hargrid wouldn't be able to save us." Draco said in an angry whisper.
"Eat them, you'll feel better. I think. I hope. " Draco popped them in his mouth. He still wore a grimace.
"Potter." He sneered before making eye contact with Harry, but when  he looked into Harry's eyes, his own flashed red and he jolted over in pain.
"Oh, great going Potter. You suggest we go to the ministry. But you don't even have a plan?" Draco said, rolling his eyes.
"Of course, yeah. Thank you, Hagrid." Harry smiled. Draco got up and followed him towards the door.  Hagrid opened the door for them and they exited the cabin. The air outside wash fresh and cool, and smelt of rain, even though it should be snowing again sometime soon.
's is rubbish anyways. Liking another Wizard isn't bad or even insane." Ron said, patting his shoulder. "I'll jinx any one who tries to mess with you." Ron promised.
"Draco will be fine. When he wakes up, he will be shaken. But he will not suffer long term effects."
The members of the DA stood in the room, in front of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Draco was out of sight from everyone. Hermione had met up with him earlier so she could give him the enchanted coin and get him to sign the lists to ensure confidentiality.
"That's an understatement." Someone coughed. Draco refused to look awkward, and only continued talking.
before I do. There's so many wizards who live to be over 100 years old and they end up doing nothing with their lives. Yet here I am, signed up for an unavoidable teenage death, and I'm setting out to do
Harry awoke to a Golden light. His eyes focused. He recognised it as the fountain at the Ministry of Magic. But it was blurry. Where were his glasses?
"No no no," Harry said. "I'm saying that because Hermione came up with a solution not too long ago, to teach people Defense Again the Dark Arts. She suggested we create a club in which we help people learn spells so that they can actually defend themselves (what with Voldemort on the loose and all) and pass their OWLs, of course."
They pulled apart when they heard a rustling in the trees behind them. Draco looked suspiciously at the area, before hesitantly looking back at Harry.
Harry reluctantly stood up to face Dumbledore. But suddenly Harry felt a white-hot pain running through his scar. He felt dizzy with pain and he collapsed to the floor.
He noticed Draco tense up. Hermione had tears in her eyes. She cried out for him to just tell the truth. But he soon figured out what she was doing. She was leading Umbridge to the forest.
"I know that the reputation I've built for myself is... well, the only word I can think for it is, ugly. I've been terrible, and now, something life changing has happened to me, and it took that to realize that I no longer want to be that person. I want to be better, I know I can. And I think this would help me to become kinder, to become selfless, and to become..." Draco paused for a second. " And to become brave."
"My son. Don't be ridiculous. Come with me. You will be rewarded for bringing Potter along. Come stand with me." Lucius held his hand out to his son.
Ron would head off to start a diversion. Draco would go report it to Umbridge. Hermione would work to keep guard of the office while Harry spoke in the fireplace. Harry would use the knife Sirius had given him to unlock the door.
"Can I kiss you, Harry?" Draco asked. Harry nodded with a smile. As always those sparks were as strong as ever. Even though Draco was weak their connection burned strongly.
"Stay away from my son!" Roared Lucius behind her. His robes were tattered from the glass. His eye was beginning to blacken, and his long blond hair was matted. Lucius shoved Bellatrix forcefully out of the way.
"Did you." Malfoy huffed. "Or did you not read this out loud before I walked into this bloody room."
The rhythm of Draco's breaths sent Harry to his own sleep, where his mind conjured the blonde hair and silver eyed boy in his dreams.
"It's okay to cry." Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair gently. No one had ever told him that before.
A voice came out of his mouth that wasn't his own. He could not focus on what that voice said. He wondered if this was dying. He thought about being with Sirius. His parents. And possibly later on, Draco. He wondered if his parents, Cedric, Sirius felt like this when they died. He felt a wave of sorrow for them.
Harry's hand stung more and more every time he wrote the sentence, until it hurt so much it felt numb. As Harry wrote, he noticed that down below, the Slytherin's were practicing at the Quidditch field.
"You know what happens to people like you?" The boy asked him stepping forward more. Harry backed up and felt the wall behind him. He took out his wand. The Slytherin took out his own wand at the same time.
After what seemed like forever, they came across a clearing . Around it, trees were uprooted and branches were strewn everywhere.
The door open and Harry accidentally gasped. Malfoy quickly turned his head towards the area Harry was in. He glanced to the empty space on the shelf were the book had been and and his expression went from fear to annoyance.
"Er, well, so I know you guys aren't going to take this lightly. Because well, this is someone you'd least expect to be with us."
"What's that? You're not making sense Potter. You've gone bonkers." The Slytherin roared with laughter. Harry stayed silent.
But Harry knew he never really wanted it to be any other way. It wouldn't have felt right with anyone but Draco. This connection was wonderful. Amazing. As natural to him as magic. Maybe it was magic.
Because Dumbledore was their solution to all their problems. Something gone wrong? Tell Dumbledore, he'll be sure to fix it. Nevermind the mess could give the ministry a good reason to expell him and send him to Azkaban.
"RUN." Harry bellowed, and the four of them sprinted in zig zags out of the isle, dodging spells being sent their direction.
"Wow, Harry..." Draco said as they were outside of the pub. "I knew terrible stuff happened that night, but I hadn't expected it to be so...so...." He was lost for words for a second. "That sounded absolutely terrible. Fucking epic, but absolutely terrible."
"That's none of your business." Hermione said cooly. "Harry's been with hundreds of witches and wizards. He's not here to be interviewed about his love life." Rita grimmaced and put her quill back into her handbag.
He felt an abundance of emotions at once. He couldn't control it. The mirror in the room cracked. Accidental Magic. He needed to calm down. But god it was so hard.
"You're bloody insane." Draco whispered fiercely to Hagrid. Harry felt like he was missing something important.
"Are you alright, Harry?" Hermione asked. Harry couldn't help but think that was a stupid question to ask.
"How long have you known? About my feelings for him?" Harry asked desperately. Was it really that obvious?
Harry had small hope that maybe he'll find a counter curse before he ran out of time. But that hope was continuing to diminish. Harry found it hard to stay positive.
" That." Draco stated. "Was the worst thing. I've ever willingly put myself through." He leaned back on one of the desks and looked down. Harry laughed.
"Ronald, of course saving Malfoy is worth all of this! He may not have been too nice to us in the past but that's not worth the rest of his life!" Hermione exclaimed.
Hermione pointed her wand to the mess, and muttered a few unfamiliar spells. The mess was cleaned up and the bag turned back up. His bowl was filled with food.
." He muttered, pointing his wand at them, and he put them on. He looked around. His heart skipped a beat.
He felt the sickening spin, and he closed his eyes. He landed on the floor of the Ministry of Magic, facing the golden statue. He was covered in soot and his glasses were crooked.
"Harry, I'm already done for! My time will be up soon anyways. It no longer matters what they know about me!"
"Your godfather. He pushed you out of the way when - when she-she cast the curse. He took the blow himself. He fell through the veil. Your godfather is dead, Harry."
"We think we should give him a chance too." Fred spoke out, his arm on George's shoulder. George nodded.
"Don't pretend, Potter! You're just saying you don't hate me because I'm a dead man walking! I know it because everyone hates me! I know! What makes you different from everyone else besides that fancy scar carved into your head, golden boy!" Malfoy's pale cheeks had turned red.
Harry stopped reading. He couldn't bare to go on. He suddenly didn't feel like eating anymore. He looked up to the Slytherin table. Draco wasn't there. Hermione looked at him sympathetically.
"Forgive us, Harry. But we've been your friends for years, and we've become a bit... jealous... because you've only just started becoming friends with him. And we don't want to see you leave us just so you can be with Malfoy more often. It kinda hurts our feelings."
"Thank you, Ron." Harry said genuinely. "For everything. For the support. And especially for helping me out with that Slytherin. You're a really great friend, you know."
The door creaked open, startling Harry. Draco was at the threshold. His eyes had  a hurt and frustrated look.
He heard the door open behind him. He turned to face a burly Slytherin, a silver badge on his chest. He was part of the Inquisitorial Squad. When he saw Harry a malicious smile spread across his face.
Harry was in disbelief that Draco had actually managed to eat the entire box like that without spitting them out once. Draco looked quite ill, though, as he tosses the box into the trashcan.
Harry returned to his senses and gave a quick shake of his head no, with wide eyes. He tightened his grip of the quill and began writing again.
"To cast a Patronus, you've gotta think of a really happy memory. " Harry instructed. "It's really advanced magic so if you don't get it it's okay."
But Hermione still seemed unsure. "We can't be sure it actually worked..." She said nervously. " I could've gotten it wrong."
"I've screwed up, Harry." Ron gulped, staring down at his water. "She's not going to speak to me for for at least a week!"
"My father had taken up practicing the Cruciatus curse on me whenever I disobeyed him. So when I returned during the Holidays after I had wrote him, he didn't hesitate to use it on me immediately after I entered the Manor. My mother, she couldn't do anything. Or he'd do the same to her."
"Oh yeah." Draco nodded. "I know where you're talking about. Lets call it the rock place." He laughed. Harry gave him a long sigh.
Ron choked in the middle of drinking his pumpkin juice. Hermione rolled her eyes at him before she continued.
Harry's scar seared as he awoke, like fire burning through the shape of lightning. Drenched in sweat, he sat up, grabbing his glasses.
Harry gave Hermione a slight smile. "Thanks Hermione, that means a lot. But that's not why I wasn't in class this afternoon."
Harry walked into the Great Hall for breakfast. As he walked, a few students snickered at him. He was used to that, though. Ever since the daily prophet started writing stories about how "crazy" he was.
"Do you have a death wish?" Draco asked incredulously. "Because if you go alone, you will die. And I can't let that happen."
Harry finished it with a confused look on his face. There was nothing more about the spell in the book, only the incantation. It gave no information on how to cast it, and it gave no clear information on what exactly the spell was meant to do. Harry would probably have to take it back to Hermione to decipher.
"So before I entered Hogwarts, my father had fed me all this information on blood traitors and mudbloods, muggles and the whole list. And of course, I believed all of this, because who else was there to tell me he was wrong? Other Death Eaters? Of course not. But- when i entered Hogwarts, there were so many other view points and perspectives. People who were there to disagree and give reasons
"If you're fine, then go ahead and walk down those stairs by yourself without Harry's help." Hermione challenged.
Harry set it down in the kitchen before quickly traveling back upstairs to tell Draco they were here. Draco reluctantly got up and traveled with Harry downstairs, using Harry's arm as support.
"No, no. Closer I mean. Please." Draco looked at him pleadingly again. Harry pulled him into his arms. Draco buried his face into Harry's chest.
"Er... actually." Draco looked down. " I'm not on the team anymore... I kinda quit." Draco admitted.
"First of all- we're going to figure out how to reverse the curse. You're not going to die that day, Malfoy. You're going to live a full life alright, and everythings gonna be okay because were going to figure it all out. Second of all- Malfoy, I've said this. If you do end up getting the unfortunate side of the curse, I would never be happy about the outcome. Ever. I told you this. I know youve been an arse to me for the past five years, but believe it or not I don't hate you. Voldemort? I hate. Umbridge? I hate. You? You don't even come close."
"It's alright, Harry." Luna told him. "Everyone does it anyways. He's only afraid that Draco Malfoy'll betray us. But he doesn't have to be, because Draco's being genuine. I can tell."
Harry realised there was wind blowing around him. The pain faded. He was laying flat on the cool marble floor.
Draco walked into the Office, clutching Hermione. Behind him came the burly Slytherin Harry had faced in the bathroom, clutching Ron. The slytherin's jaw was bruised and his eye blackened. Someone that made him seem even more threatening to Harry.
The potion took effect quickly, and could be seen clearly the next day. Colour seemed to return to Draco's face. His appetite returned, and Draco seemed to be in a much better room. He was still cold to the touch, but Harry could've sworn he was becoming a bit warmer.
Umbridge glanced over at Harry's dripping hand and nodded in satisfaction. "Very well then, Mr. Potter. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow evening. Hurry along."
"I've got your back, Sirius yelled. Curses were sent flying in his directions as Bellatrix screamed them madly.
Harry lead Draco up the staircase, both under the Invisibility Cloak. He eyed the Marauders' Map carefully.
Malfoy snickered in the corner of the room. Snape glanced at him for a second before turning back to Harry. Hermione was about to argue back but Ron motioned for her to sit down and shut up.
Harry yanked the curtain in front of the portrait closed. Silence filled the air. He travelled back up the staircase to Draco's room.
"I'm sorry, Malfoy." Harry looked at him with guilt in his eyes. "I'll work until the end to find the cure, until it's too late. But you don't have to, if you don't want to. I understand that. It's okay."
Hermione looked at him sympathetically. Harry didn't want her sympathy. He just wanted the stupid curse to go away.
Harry followed after him. The cool air stung his face. Draco was still wearing his scarf, but he didn't mind.
The room around them was still and quiet. The faces of the people looking at them were filled with a mixture of fear, shock, concern, and from Zachariah Smith, amusement.
But Harry, at the moment couldn't think. His mind was a cluttered mess that was impossible to sort out.
"My safety doesn't matter, alright. I will find a way to make sure you're safe over the summer." Harry said intently.
"BLOODY HELL!" Draco shot up, wiping the water from his face with the sleeve of his robes. Harry just cast a drying charm on Draco.
Umbridge took their wands from them, and set them on her desk. She questioned Harry and he refused to say anything.
"Fine." Draco repeated with a scoff. "Take me to Hagrids. But dear god, I swear, if anyone sees us together, going down to that buffoon, then you'll sorely regret it. Potter." He walked over to Harry wobbly, and leaned on him for support. Harry shook his head, and helped support Draco.
"Harry... don't you think you have a bit of a.. saving people thing?" Hermione asked smally. Draco snorted. The three of them glared at Draco.
He couldn't. He couldn't bare the thought of Voldemort or The Malfoy family knowing. Lucius Malfoy, who he had seen with cold eyes, looking at him through the Death Eater mask. A shiver ran down his spine.
Harry lifted him in his arms and carried him down the stairs. He supported him as he walked weakly to the living room. But Draco of course, tried to pass it off as if he was fine.
"Yes. Don't mention it." She mumbled awkwardly and shuffled out of the broom closet. It wasn't as cramped but he and Draco were still
"I'm done- I'm just done." He said in anger, but distraught coloured his tone. He put his face in his hands with a deep breath.
""Sorry 'bout that. Reckon he was takin an interest in ya. Don' worry though, he wouldn' hurt ya." Hagrid assured.
"There's not much we can do about that except be more careful about D.A. meetings and talking to Draco." She sighed.
Two weeks later, Harry sat beside Draco once more in the Room of Requirement. They were relaxing on the loveseat together, simply talking. Draco was leaned against him.
They ordered a couple of coffees, and sat down at a table by the window, looking at the snow gently falling down.
Grawp looked at Hagrid with what seemed to be a disappointed expression. Then, Grawp proceeded to bend down and gently release Draco from his palm.
"I love you." Draco said. " I love you so much. There's no place I'd rather be right now than here with you."
Harry went through a door they'd already marked, and set Draco down, kneeling beside him. They were the only ones there.
"Actually, I just went digging in your garden, and I also took a visit to see Luna and her father, who lives over the hill from your house. Luna was happy to help."
It was serene and peaceful, exactly what Harry needed. He needed calm, to escape his overwhelming emotions.
"I told you that this forest was fucking forbidden for a reason." Draco looked at him with frustration and fear.
"Of  course I'll stay with you. I'll be with you, until the very end." Harry replied, his throat tight. He held Draco's hand.
"I'll take care of the boy from here. You're careless. You nearly risked us the prophecy, you bitch."
Draco played with Harry's hair and Harry closed his eyes.  Draco was gentle, and he hummed softly. Harry didn't recognise the tune.
"Yes and I've regretted it. I mean, you've seen how she acts around me. I've presented no interest in her, yet she clings to me like a bug, even though I clearly am annoyed by it. But, I thought, why not give it a go? Yeah? Well, after that I just need to know if kissing is supposed to feel that gross or if it was just her."
"We'll just. Take off from the Hogwarts express. Before anyone notices we'll just board a muggle train and leave." Harry said, imagining the fantasy, wishing desperately and hopelessly for that dream to become reality.
good job faking then. I mean his eyes turned red! And he's seems more ... I dunno... vulnerable if that's the right word." Harry replied
Malfoy's words echoed throughout his head, the same thing over and over again. He couldn't escape the ice in Malfoy's voice, no matter how far he tried to run away from it, no matter where he went. They were still clear and loud as ever.
Harry tried to hold him back but Draco pushed Harry away, knocking him to the ground. Draco limped painfully, but face full of furry to the mad woman. He pointed his wand at her.
"Potter you bloody idiot," Malfoy's voiced cracked, as he obviously was trying to hold back an abundance of emotion. "You- you've cursed me to a death sentence."
"I think Umbridge suspects that I have the book. She's got a close eye on me. If she- If she finds out you're friends with me, you'll be done for. If she finds out, so does your dad, and so does Voldemort." He told him panicky.
"How'd you get all that?" Ron asked as she placed a bag full of ingredients next to her potions cauldron.
"It's about Malfoy." Harry told her. Her interested expression became a frown again, and Ron shook his head.
Now that Dumbledore wasn't at Hogwarts, the new Head was Umbridge, according to Educational Decree number Twenty-Eight.
Malfoy sank down, closer to the shore, next to Harry. Harry  sat down beside him. The sun was starting to set, turning the water of the lake into fire.
The more Harry thought about those dreaded detentions, the more the scars on the back of Harry's hand burned. Harry had only just removed the bandages off it yesterday, now he'd have to deal with it all over again.
He put his head in his hands and he couldn't control the sobs. Hermione came beside him and hugged him. Tears ran down her cheeks too.
Draco said, infuriated. Hermione got up and left the room, followed quickly by Ron. But Harry didn't budge.
"The sooner you leave the less of a chance you have of getting caught. So lets get a move on!" Hermione led the way out, and when they passed the common room, they found a couple Gryffindors still passed out.
Hagrid seemed to realise this and quickly grabbed a bucket from under the table and pushed it in Draco's face. Draco grabbed it, and started getting sick inside the bucket.
Hermione had known before he'd even known himself. He felt a lot of appreciation for her as a friend.
"Thank you, Hermione. A whole lot. I really mean it." Harry said genuinely. "I'm going to see if there's still food in the great hall." Harry said, distracting himself from the subject.
"Maybe we can..." Draco said suddenly. "The ministry only tracks magic performed around us. They can't prove that we do the magic because this is a wizard's house. Magic is performed here all the time."
"Hmm, what about that twisty tree by the lake?" Harry suggested. Draco smiled with a nod. No one really went near the tree, as it was in a secluded part of the grounds and not many people knew about it.
territory, Hagrid. Do not come back, or next time I won't go so soft on you." Bane looked to Hagrid with rage. He looked at Draco, Harry, and Hermione. "You have brought children here. We do not hurt fawns, but consider this your final warning."
Draco said clearly. A silver Lion erupted from the end of Draco's wand, it's paws treaded silently on the floor. Bright and warm.
"You've been so brave." Harry said to him, Draco held Harry's hand, grasping it tightly, his fingers still cold.
"Not that big a deal?! Harry look at your hand. That's cruel! And for something you didn't even lie about? She's an ignorant woman. She has no place in this school, making ridiculous rules and hurting students. She doesn't even know how to teach!" Draco paced some more. "It'll be a miracle if everyone doesn't fail their OWLs this year." His face was red and he spat out his words with frustration and anger.
"Wait no." Harry interjected. "If we show this to Dumbledore then he'd know I was in the restricted section without permission, out of bed after hours, and snooping around in a teacher's stuff. A teacher from the ministry at that! I could get in so much trouble and I can't risk being expelled and having to live with the Dursley's again for the rest of my school years."
"Well...Voldemort's got Sirius. I saw it." Ron's eyes widened but Hermione looked unsure. Draco just looked plainly confused.
" Malfoy yelled. "He told me that Muggleborns are thieves of magic. He told me Muggleborns shouldn't be
Ron! That was the most foolish thing you both have ever done. Actually I can name worse, but nevermind that. That was the worst. You two do realize that we have O.W.Ls to study for? We don't have time for that nonsense!"
Harry sighed. "Yeah..." He got up and walked towards Hermione. Hermione handed him the book. It felt like poison in his hands, but at the same time it felt powerful, and it felt like it would have what he most wanted at the moment. A cure.
"Do you really think my father would care if it's illegal? Considering?" Malfoy flung another rock at the lake.
Harry shrugged those feelings off like sand being brushed off of his shoulders. He walked towards the fire, and after taking a breath, he threw the book into the fire. The fire grew and  became a bright burst of teal for a second before slowly fading back orange and dying down to it's regular size.
But he knew one thing. He knew that he'd decided that he trusted him, because there was no way Malfoy could fake all of this. All of the pain that shown in his grey eyes. And Harry only wanted to make it better.
"Well I was thinking about you, not hard to do considering you're right here, but nonetheless, I was thinking about you. And I thought I should share that. You're soul is beautiful you know. Not often do you come across someone like you." Draco told him softly and pressed his hand to Harry's chest, feeling his heartbeat.
Friday afternoon, Harry returned to Umbridge's office. As soon as he walked through the door, Umbridge handed him the quill with an overly-sweet smile spread across her toad-like face.
It was the afternoon, and the sunset was expected to start soon. The lake shimmered, and mountains surrounded it. There was forest behind him, and the sunlight of the setting sun shone through the green leaves of the tall trees. Harry sat by the shore, looking out into water that lapped onto the rocks close to his feet.
"You hate me Potter, it's not hard to figure out. How could you not? I know you'll be happy once I'm finally out of your hair."
"We need to talk..." He motioned to the common room. The pair of them crept past the bunks, down the stair case, taking a seat in the comfy chairs.
"Small." Draco repeated. "Yeah, I see... I think me and Harry should head back now... thank you for showing us this... this interesting... giant." Draco started to turn but Harry tugged the sleeve of his robes.
"Stay away from me or I'll smash it." Draco sneered. "The Dark Lord wouldn't like that now, would he."
But Harry said nothing more to Hermione, who had let the subject go. Probably under the impression Harry had complied with her idea. Harry decided he would let her give him the sickles. But he wouldn't use them. He just wanted to avoid an argument that he knew Hermione would probably win.
Five minutes later they were travelling through the stuffy passage to Honeydukes, the invisibility cloak in Harry's left hand.
Draco shook his head. "God, no. I don't enjoy being stuck in the Hospital Wing, thank you very much."
The Order has less frequent meetings. According to Mrs. Weasley, there wouldn't be another meeting for another week and a half.
When they travelled back, leaving Umbridge behind with the centaurs, they were greeted by Ron and Draco.
"Yer an idiot." Hagrid told him, "but yer gonna be alright, but don' be doin'  that again unless you'd like to vomit." He laughed.
"Hey, it'll be alright. People will have to either acknowledge that you've began to change as a person or they'll have to deal with it."
A Death Eater shot at Draco but Harry shielded him. A duel began between Harry and the Death Eater, who shot spells at Harry almost quicker than Harry could block them.
"Do you think that there's any health risks that could come from doing that? I mean, I have a set date, I'd love to last long enough to reach it " Draco asked him, his face paler than usual.
"How the hell did you figure out this was here?" Draco asked, looking curiously around the passage. Harry pulled out the Maurauder's map.
"One moment." He said before grabbing his bag and searching through it. He pulled out a quill, ink, and a note book and flipped to a blank page. He wrote "Bucket List." At the top of it. Harry found himself wishing he could have the ability to write as neatly as he did.
"Oh you don't have to throw a party Mrs. Weasley. I know you all are busy and I don't want to trouble you. I don't really  celebrate my birthday that often anyways."
Harry ran further. He was almost to the door. But Draco suddenly collapsed. His ankle. Draco motioned for Harry to go.
"If it were poison would I eat one myself?" Hagrid asked him and popped one in his mouth. Draco's suspicious expression didn't fade, but he hesitantly took one from Hagrid. He then put the leaf in his mouth and started chewing. But Draco's expression didn't seem relieved, he only looked increasingly more ill.
"Good luck, Harry." Ron snorted. "I'll be in the library."  Hermione seemed the tiniest surprised at the last part, but quickly shook it off as he left the common room.
Harry knew Umbridge would direct her attention to Harry, who she most likely suspected was the reason behind the disappearance of the book. If she saw the friendliness between him and Draco... Harry shuddered. He couldn't let anything else happen to him.
"Girls can go into the boys dormitory,remember? You just can't go into ours." Hermione reminded him. "Anyways, Harry. Draco is
"Do you think I haven't seen enough torture and death and horrible things in my life to understand?! Do you think my father shielded me from the Dark Lord's doing? God, Harry, I've seen so much. Too much. I've witnessed people being killed like flies. I am prepared for anything the Dark Lord could bring my way."
It wasn't until Harry finished his coffee that he remembered he was supposed to meet Hermione at the Three Broomsticks.
"Harry!" Hermione's voice rang out. Harry opened his eyes to see the curtains pulled open. He faced  the frizzy hair and frustrated eyes of Hermione.
Harry didn't respond. How could that be true, after Harry had caused him so much misfortune. How could that be true when, the more he was around Harry, the more danger he was in. But oh, there was something in Draco's eyes that told him his words were sincere. Harry looked right into the silver, feeling closer to him.
"That doesn't matter. I no longer care. I accept my fate. I have to accept it, because otherwise the rest of my life will be wasted. And there's probably nothing more about this curse at Hogwarts, even in the restricted section." Malfoy ran his fingers through his silky blonde hair. "Anyways. This might make me the person I've always wanted to be."
Harry paused for a second. "Do you think we would've become friends sooner if I had chosen Slytherin?"
"If you don't want to agree to help him, then you don't have to. But we're going to help Hagrid." Hermione said firmly. Draco gave in.
Harry shook his head with the smallest smile on his face before continuing his journey to the common room.
" Zacharias spoke out loudly. "He's a manipulative Slytherin and he's going to do is betray us. I don't know what you all expect. He's a Slytherin, and all Slytherins care about is power. "
"You shouldn't be in here." He said. "I might have to report you to Professor Umbridge for trying to hit on every guy who walks in here."
"No I don't. " He whispered, and looked away. Harry shook his head. He did. He's made mistakes, but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve those things. All his life Draco had been neglected of love and kindness, and someone finally began to talk to him and look at the person he really is, and shown him those things. And he put his guard down, showed vulnerability, trust, and he returned the kindness.
"I got sick at lunch, sir." Harry replied. His palms were sweaty. He looked around the room, trying to avoid eye contact.
Harry sat at his favourite place by the lake. Now that he no longer had detention with Umbridge, he wasn't researching the Devil's Curse, and he didn't have Quidditch practice, he actually had free time again.
"His name 's Grawp." Hagrid said proudly. "He doesn' speak English too well but I've been tryin' yer teach him."
"Buckbeak only attacked you because you didn't listen to what Hagrid clearly told everyone to do. He said: 'Don't insult them they're proud creatures.'" He tried to imitate Hagrids voice, poorly. "And you know what you did? You insulted the damn bird."
He was able to clear his negative thoughts and focus on the peaceful sounds of the nature around him.
"Hold up." Ron stared at the two of them. "You found a mysterious Latin spell after snooping around Umbridge's desk. And on the back of it there were the words 'The Book of
"None of your business, Potter. You're not entitled to knowing everything just because you're a celebrity." Malfoy sneered.
"I figured. it'll be difficult for me, opening up to people like that. But what isn't difficult these days?" Draco gave a nervous laugh.
"Umbridge, she's sided with Voldemort. They planted the Book of Death at Hogwarts." Harry tried to explain.
Draco chuckled. "You know, it's so strange talking about my own death like this. Usually people think of it as a solemn thing, death. But here we are, laughing because of a list of things I want to do before I die. I'm going to die." Draco laughed and leaned back into the trunk of the tree.
"Are you alright, Harry?" Dumbledore asked. What a stupid question to ask. He nodded anyways, even though he felt anything but alright.
"In case the alcohol doesn't do the job, we can't have him recognize that Draco doesn't belong here." Hermione explained, as though it should've been obvious. Harry began to wonder how long the party had lasted.
"You'll stay with me, right? The entire time?" Draco asked, his voice shaky. "I don't want to die alone." Silent tears began to roll down Draco's cheeks.
Harry was relieved that Umbridge gave no hint of suspicion towards Draco. But he also knew that he'd have to be more careful.
Harry understand, and nodded. "I'm sorry, you two. I promise, I won't let our friendship fall apart only to spend more time building up mine with Malfoy. Hey, to make it up to you guys,  we can all three go to Hogsmeade the next visit together. Just us. It'll be fun. We haven't done something like that in a while."
"Ah can I have a kiss before you do?" Draco asked. Harry smiled and gave Draco a quick kiss before heading down the stairs.
Harry didn't know what to say, what to do. He just did what he thought would keep Draco away. And it worked.
"I'm going to heal your ankle , Alright." Sirius muttered to him. "I might be a little bit rusty on healing magic..." Draco gulped. Harry remembered what Lockhart did his second year to Harry's arm.
"It's the freak map you had when we were going up to your Common Room. This is crazy, how'd you get a hold of it?"
"That's understandable. Neither could I." Draco muttered. " How are you doing? Don't say fine. I know you're not."
"I know, Harry." Hermione said with sympathy. "But, there's many other sources we can look through."
" Harry, I can tell you're getting close to him. Don't let yourself get too close. It'll only be taken away from you in the end."
"Aren't you worried about being here with me? On Valentine's Day?" Draco asked, nervousness and panic seeming to surface inside of him.
"Wanna go see the shrieking shack?" Harry suggested. It wasn't so much the sightseeing, but the fact that it was almost secluded that made Harry want to go see it.
"Sounds great." Harry nodded, a fake smile on his face. The last thing Harry wanted to do was celebrate. Birthdays seemed stupid to him. Celebrating them seemed stupid to him. All he wanted to do was lay in bed.
"So after that, I stopped going home for the holidays. I stopped questioning him, even though every year I learned more and more about why he was wrong. But my 'friend's' parents all had connections with my father, and if I started to seem like I was thinking for my own, he would've easily found out. So I tried to force myself into his mindset again. And now I'm just so afraid to stop. It's difficult to go against something you've been taught for all of your life. I'm so afraid that people will find out I've been talking to famous Harry Potter. Because when i return home, I won't be returning to Hogwarts again. And I don't want to die there with my father constantly torturing me because I've disobeyed him."
Draco was going to die after all. He had thought... he had thought that Draco was finally cured. He closed his eyes and imagined a future where Draco didn't die. Where they lived side by side together. Where they were able to be free. Able  to look at the stars together. To escape from everything. To spend years with each other . But that was impossible. All that hope was washed away. He felt shattered. His death was inevitable.
"What are you still doing up at this hour? After what's happen" Malfoy sneered, making an obvious attempt to steady his voice.
"Oh, enough. I thought we had stopped going on about a counter curse. It's just a waste of time." Draco snapped. This was the third time Hermione had brought it up. Draco didn't know that Harry too was looking for a counter curse. He couldn't bare to sit around and do nothing as he was slipping away from him. So soon after Sirius too... Harry squeezed his eyes shut.
As they continued though, Harry noticed that Malfoy's tense and angry demeanor seemed to fade slowly into a sad expression as the hour went by. Harry didn't comment on it.
Draco left the closet, leaving Harry feeling wind-blown He stood alone there for  a second, recapping it in his mind, before walking out to join Hermione in the Common room.
"It's a date then." Said Harry confidently. Draco's expression became relieved, a smile on his lips.
She cleared her throat. "Hm, hm, Mr. Potter." She looked directly at him with her malicious smile. "Is this your way of telling me you'd rather stay longer?"
"Here. Take this for tonight. So you don't get caught in the halls after curfew." Harry said, handing Draco his Invisibility Cloak.
"We should probably get back to bed." Ron yawned, and obvious attempt to change the subject from Draco. Harry waved for him to go, pretending he couldn't see how Ron felt.
Ron, on the other hand, had expressed alot of excitement to try Fire-whiskey. He was in the crowd bragging about a broomstick, a cup of the stuff in his hand. Hermione noticed him and only became more frustrated. She stormed up to him.
"Of course." Harry said softly. Their lips connected. Harry knew that spark, that raging fire, would live on, even after Draco was gone.
When Harry was finally exhausted enough to drift to sleep, the rest of his night was filled with nightmares.
"I'm extremely concerned that the book is even at Hogwarts. Its gotta be illegal to preform that curse, I wouldn't be surprised if that book is illegal to have possession of. I mean can you imagine what someone can do with a book like that! Horrid things! I mean it's titled 'The Book of
"This wasn't supposed to happen, I would never have intentionally done this to you- I've never in my life wanted to kill you, Malfoy. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please. " Harry cried. "There has to be a counter curse- there has to! Do you know ?"
The common room was crowded and Fred and George had managed to bring food from the kitchen, as well as a generous supply of Butterbeer and Fire-whiskey. Harry wondered how they managed to get it, but didn't think much of it. Somethings were better off unsolved.
"You looked like you were having a bloody seizure, Potter. And you look like you're going to be sick."
"Don't go back." Harry told him. Which was a bit contradictory towards himself, considering couldn't follow his own advice with the Dursleys, the previous years
By morning Draco was assigned part of Umbridge's "Inquisitorial Squad". He bore a silver badge on his chest to prove it.
He made continual glances at the Map to be sure that no one out on patrol was headed towards his direction. Everyone he was looking out for was conveniently patrolling other parts of the castle and the area he was travelling through continued to stay empty.
"Oh quit yer whinin'. I never poisoned yeh. Only helped yeh." Hagrid shut the jar of leaves and put them back in the cupboard.
He felt dangerous. He feared to go to sleep because he didn't want to endanger anyone. A big part of him felt guilt. What if it was his fault that Mr. Weasley was attacked in the first place? Even though everyone kept telling him Harry was the reason he was even alive.
"I wish we could've been friends longer. Before all this curse rubbish happened. All those years of hate, and I regret it all. I wish I hadn't been such a bloody jerk. I wish I could've known."
a cure staring right at us in one of these books and I never end up finding it because i just stopped?" Harry looked up at him worriedly.
"Here, give these to Draco in the morning." He advised, looking cautiously towards Draco. Harry pocketed the sweets as George turned back to Fred.  Harry wandered off to talk to Ron.
"I figured it out when you sacrificed not talking to him just to keep him safe. It pained you, so much, but you did it anyways, to protect him."
"You've failed tremendously at this lesson, Mr. Potter. I will not ask you to attempt to make another one, because it is clear that you will never figure out how to do this. Instead, for the rest of the class period I will have you clean up the mess you've made of this room, and for your homework you will write an essay on this potion, how to make it, and the origins. Let's pray that you don't somehow mess this up, because if you do, I'll be
"I never expected... to have so many friends." Draco said softly to Harry, looking to Ron, Hermione, Luna. Even the twins and Ginny.
Harry glided, calm and composed as he came to a halt, looking down at the pale face of Lucius Malfoy.
Sirius ran into the room, a large gash on his forehead. Blood was dripping down his face. He looked at Draco with worry, and pointed his wand at him, deeply concentrating. He muttered a few spells and a few minutes later, Draco stopped thrashing. He just lay there unconscious. Harry looked at Sirius in panic.
"I'm sorry, I just got caught up in myself. I didn't think!" Ron pleaded to the closed door. It stayed silent and shut.  For the rest of the night, Ron didn't talk to anyone and only drank water. He lingered by the food, with a grimace that made no one want to approach him.
Harry finally felt hope. Draco wasn't going to die. Relief flooded Harry and the whole day he was cheerful.
Harry wasn't sure what he was feeling. It was a complex mixture of warmth, emotion, and happiness. He didn't know how to put it into words, but he liked the emotion.
They looked around at the shops and bought a few things, which they kept in their robes. Harry enjoyed spending quality time with Draco. He enjoyed not having to think about anything that troubled them. Just being able to hold his hand and talk to him. Like two ordinary boys, who just so happened to be in love.
Now that the Room of Requirement had been discovered, they no longer had a secret meeting place. But thanks to Fred and George, they could manage to find time alone. The twins were determined to cause mayhem for the new Headmistress.
When they finally arrived at Hagrid's hut, Harry exhaustedly knocked on the door. Harry could hear Fang barking inside and Hagrid telling him to hush. The door clicked open and Hagrid stood there, towering over them, a warm smile on his face.
As soon as soon as he took the last one down and set them all into a drawer, the first few members began to arrive and people began spilling in.
Harry was just extremely impressed he kept them in his mouth and managed to eat them. There was still more left I'm the box through.
Draco started to stir and Harry closed his eyes in relief. He helped Draco up to his feet. Draco looked shaken, yet determined.
The figure was not looking at Harry. It was looking across from Harry. The figure spoke with a cold high pitched voice, sending shivers down Harry's spine. At first he did not focus on the words it was saying. But he concentrated on them.
"Ah. See. That's a good question cause I seemed to have forgotten." Draco told him, deep in thought. Harry chuckled.
y! Would you rather me just drop you off by the dungeons and have you go to your common room from there?" Harry threatened. He wouldn't give Draco any hint that he knew where the Slytherin common room was, because he knew Draco would instantly become suspicious if he did.
Then, he came. He walked between them, and they stopped duelling. It was Dumbledore. He wasn't calm when he looked to Draco. He was fuming.
"Nah, I think someone got photos. I think I'll put him back how he was when he was sober- just to preserve his sanity. If he decides in the morning that's how he wants to look, well I'm not going to stop him. He's a pretty lady." Harry laughed. Ron returned the laugh.
"Don't 'but' me, Potter. Just do it. Or I'll take off house points. I can do that. Now run along, and don't get yourself into more trouble than it's worth." Malfoy ordered before walking the opposite direction swiftly.
"There you are, at it again. Stating the obvious. We have until July to figure it out. One day without research won't hurt. Anyways what if there is no reversal? We'd be pointlessly overworking ourselves for the rest of the school year. That's not how I want to spend the rest of my days. Anyways, this comes with sooner consequences if it doesn't get done."
"Er yeah, its in my bag, one moment." Harry replied and reached over the arm of his chair to pull up his bag. He set the bag in his lap, pulled out the old book, and proceeded to set his bag back down on the floor.
Draco began silently writing into the journal, leaning in close to the page in concentration. Harry sat there awkwardly because he couldn't see what Draco was writing and didn't want to be nosy by looking over his shoulder.
He glanced at the map one more time to confirm that Madam Pince was safely asleep in her bed. He then snuck towards the restricted section. scanning through the books, he found the one he was searching for and carefully removed it from the shelf. His plan was to get the information he needed and put the book right back where it belonged.
"Maybe he doesn't know kindness. Maybe that's why he did that." Harry said. Draco was lost for words. He just sat there and thought for a moment.
"Do you think something like this will happen again?" Harry asked. "That someone will try to attack me because of that article?"
And he disappeared in the flames. Love. He had called Harry Love in front of Ron and Hermione. Ron and Hermione hadn't even seemed to bat an eye. Harry felt pride for Draco that moment. Going first. Taking new steps. But he also felt nervous. If something were to happen to Draco...
"Oh, Harry." Draco's silver eyes met with Harry's. "You know that I never blamed you at all, right? This just... happened. And I wouldn't have it any other way. So much good blossomed from this. You've long been forgiven by me. It's time you forgive yourself."
"Tripping Jinx. Very well done, Draco. 200 points to Slytherin." The malicious voice of Dolores Umbridge cried out behind them. Draco looked at him wide eyed before looking to Umbridge. His demeanour completely changed. He gripped Harry tighter and placed him in a choke hold.
I'm not sure what else I want to write..." Draco tapped his thumb on his knee. "I have nothing else major that I want to do with my life that I
For a moment, Harry could see the vulnerability in Malfoy's eyes. He could see pain. Anger. Sadness. Wonder? But only for a moment before they went back to cold.
Harry put his words into consideration. " I think everyone has a chance in their lives to live. I just don't think a lot of people take it. Or understand it. People put off things they want to do for so long, until it's too late " Harry replied thoughtfully. " I think of takes understanding that there's no point to putting things off. You just have to do it."
"I suppose we're just going to have to check every door and see if we can find it." Draco said quietly, opening the door closest to them. They entered hesitantly. It was not the room Harry saw in his vision. In the centre there was a tall veil.
Harry shook his head. "Malfoy hasn't died. He told me the date that he's supposedly going to die is implanted in his head by the curse and he told me it's July 31st, 1996."
"No!" Bellatrix cried out. " We need to protect the Prophecy! We mustn't hurt Potter until we have it!"
"Stop apologising, I don't want to hear it. There's literally nothing that can be done about it." Malfoy said in annoyance.
Harry felt upset and angry as he began to realize the way Malfoy treated him throughout the years wasn't his fault. It was his fathers.
it goes over three feet. If he has any problems with it, then he's a trash teacher and he'll have to answer to m
They heard a sudden shuffling. They froze before Draco quickly rolled of the bed, flat on the floor. the Harry pretended to be asleep. Madam Pomfrey opened the door, and suspiciously looked around. Draco was out of sight and completely silent. She hesitantly walked back. They waited a solid five minutes before daring to move. Once they were sure she had gone back Draco sat up again.
"Does it look like the full moon to you, Draco. In full daylight. In the middle of the month?" Hermione snapped.
He slung Draco's arm over his shoulder and Ron came to his aid, lifting him on the other side. They carried him to the Dormitory, which was mostly empty except for Neville, who was snoring. They heaved him onto Harry's bed, and Harry sat at the edge with a sigh. Ron stood standing, scanning his long hair and smudged make-up.
" No I haven't- not intentionally at least. I just needed to find information . And I could've carried on with that with no problem if you hadn't strut in here like you own the place."
Harry's arm began to cramp up and little drops of dripped onto the nearly filled up parchment. It was now almost completely dark out, with the top of the sun peaking out on the horizon.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and muttered something inaudible under his breath. He then looked at Harry with a cold glare.
"What did you do, you bloody prick? What did you do to me?" Draco huffed as he backed into the wall behind him and slid to the floor, putting his hands over his ears.
"No." Harry replied quietly. "You're drunk." Draco's expression shifted slightly into disappointment. Not much, but enough for Harry to notice.
Slytherin. He should've been able to defend himself. But now he had to spend over night at the hospital wing because of a 16 year old boy. He fought Voldemort three times for crying out loud. He didn't know what had happened. Why he'd frozen up like that.
Harry couldn't draw for the life of him, and when he tried he always ended up getting frustrated and crumpling his drawings up. He didn't really like anything he made, because whenever he brought projects, crafts, and art to the Dursley's from school, they'd always tell him whatever he made was terrible and throw it out.
"You could get yourself into a whole lot of trouble. Regarding this curse business.." He looked at him with a sad expression. "And I don't just mean legally."
She stood up from her chair and paced. "And all dark magic comes with a price, Harry. The heart's desire part is sketchy... This is absolutely terrible, Harry! You've basically killed Malfoy... oh dear goodness.... I mean Malfoy can be a git sometimes but that doesn't mean he deserves to die! Do you know if there's any way to reverse the curse? Do you know how long you have to figure out if you
"She won't write anything that's not the truth. I'll ensure it." Hermione said, directly giving Rita a cold look.
"Oh thank you Harry, it's chicken and rice- I know you guys probably don't get as good food from Kreature." She said, handing him the pot.
"A lot of people who've joined the DA are people who've had constant abuse thrown at them from Malfoy, Harry. It'd be very hard, if not impossible, to get everyone to trust Malfoy enough to let him be a part of something so important to these people. Maybe you've gained each other's trust, but he has to be able to accomplish that with no less then thirty people. Fights could break out, and it could lead to disaster. Is this really a good decision to make?"
The day of the Quidditch game, they didn't have a chance to sneak off together before Hagrid pulled Harry, Draco, and Hermione aside in the empty hallway.
. I accept I am going to die,  like everyone else will. The only difference is that my date is sooner. And it knowing it makes me finally ready to live."
"You know what I mean." Hermione said patiently. "You're in love with him." It wasn't a question. Harry froze.
One day, as Harry walked by Draco, unnoticed in the halls, he folded a small piece of Parchment. All that was written on it were the words "I'm so sorry." He enchanted the parchment to fly into Draco's hand.
"We've got some methods , but I can't share them with you unless you join... Would you like to? Join, I mean." Harry asked him awkwardly. He was nervous to ask him, because he was a Slytherin and they had
"I can make the two of you sickles. Just like the Galleons for the D.A.. That way you can communicate and organize meetings in the Room of Requirement when you want to talk." Hermione said, thinking. " There's nothing in the rules or any decrees that say two people can't meet in secret. Even if there was I bet that wouldn't stop most people. I know what the Seventh years get up to." Hermione said sourly. Harry laughed at the last part. And, as Harry thought about it, he realized it could work. He wouldn't have to force himself to stay away from Draco any longer. But Harry felt conflicted. The risk of doing so...
"I, Potter, happen to know quite a bit about this curse. " Malfoy said bitterly. " I know that it's called The Devil's Spell. I know that the first person to look at the caster in the eyes will fall victim to the curse. And I know that this damned book shouldn't even be at Hogwarts, not even in the restricted section."
"Don't worry, I'll talk to her." Harry assured. "But you should probably apologize, she'd take more consideration into that."
Once outside, Harry noticed as his eyes began to adjust he could see more twinkling stars against the pitch black blanket of sky.
"Now is not the time to be making jokes!" Malfoy scorned, but he was obviously attemting to suppress a smile.
"Alright. I'll meet you there. I don't want anyone seeing us walking together in the hallways, because, well you know..." Draco shuffled his feet.
Harry realized she was probably right. But he didn't want to take chances. He couldn't. But Hermione spoke more.
"Well he's one of my best friends, isn't he? 'Course I love him. Like I love you and Ron." Harry tried to brush off her question. Hermione shook her head.
"Harry, we don't hear anything." Hermione said, concerned. Draco rest his hand on Harry's shoulder gently.
He and Draco headed back to the school, talking with each other nonstop until they had to part ways. Harry enjoyed Draco's company a lot. He found Draco to be easy to talk to now, and enjoyed the conversations he had with him.
Rita squinted at them, adjusting her glasses. A sly smile spread across her face as she came to a conclusion.
Luckily, they managed to exit the Cellar with no problems, as all the workers were busy tending to the busy store, which was decorated with pink hearts and flowers for Valentine's Day. Harry shuddered when he realized it reminded him of Umbridge's office.
"Oh, like hell." Harry said, pushing the orb back into Draco's pocket. He slung Draco's arm over his shoulder, heaving him up.
"Er...in the front." Harry rubbed his forehead. Madam Pomfrey conjured a cup of water and handed it to him.
"I grew up in a place where it was natural for me to do those kinds of things. Everyone else did those things as well, and I never really thought it wrong until I got to Hogwarts. But that doesn't cover for my actions, and I know that. And it's still difficult for me to break out of my ways." Draco looked down for a second.
Sometimes Draco would update Harry on what Umbridge had set in store. Other times they'd just meet up simply to be close to each other. To see eachother without the public facade they put up.
Before Harry could reply, Draco pushed his way into the crowd to Harry. Except his artificially dark hair flowed past his shoulders. Dark lipstick stained his lips; eyeliner and eye shadow outlined his eyes. He wore girl's dress robes and glitter covered him, reminding Harry of a disco ball. Fred and George cackled with laughter behind him.
The plan followed through. Harry attempted to contact Sirius. But instead he found Kreature, who confirmed Harry's suspicion. Sirius was at the Ministry.
Harry spoke to Sirius upstairs, while he was feeding buckbeak. He shared his concern about the snake, and Sirius reassured him. But he also told him about Draco, not including the kiss.
!" He heard a familiar voice cry out. The pain subsided and Harry hastily lifted himself off the ground. Draco was there, fuming. He shot spells at the Death Eater like lightning, and the man was soon immobilised on the ground.But Draco kept going.
But, Harry noticed that the more he talked to Malfoy the more Malfoy seem to stray farther away then the image he'd set for himself for the last five years.
From then on, Harry rarely saw Draco smiling in his classes, or the great hall. Not even with his friends. He carried a burdened look, and every word he said to Harry was fueled with anger.
"That was graceful." Draco snorted, looking down at him with amusement. Draco held out his hand to help Harry up. Harry took it.
"I'm sorry." His voice quivered but his expression stayed the same. He didn't think Harry had heard him. He didn't intend for Harry to hear him. But Harry did.
Harry longed to be down there, flying freely on his broom, rather than sitting in Umbridge's stuffy office that smelt like over sprayed perfume, carving letters into his hand. But instead, Harry had been banned for from playing Quidditch for the rest of his years at Hogwarts.
Harry reached into his back pocket, grabbing his wand, preparing to disarm himself in case anything happened.
"I really should just go alone... I don't want you guys getting hurt." Harry said, looking at Ron and Hermione as well.
"Hello, everyone. " Draco said calmly. The room was pen-drop silent. Harry could see the anxiety radiating off of Hermione. "I think the main thing I wanted to say is an apology, because I realize that I haven't been the kindest person in the past."
to have a boyfriend. Literally your personal life has nothing to do with them!" Ron ranted. "Why are people getting so upset about another person's love life?"
"I just want to be a better person. My father crushed that out of me, and now I feel disgusting. I feel evil. Vile. So that brings the question. How am I supposed to be a better person, when all my life I've buried the last bit of good in me?"
"We should probably return to the Castle. Its nearly dark, Filtch will close the doors soon." Draco said suddenly. " Don't worry about getting caught in the halls though.  I'm a prefect, I'll escort you. "
"All of you have gone absolutely mad." Draco muttered. He grasped Harry's hand again, and Hagrid paid no mind. Harry gave Draco an amused smile.
"That's why I asked you, you idiot." Draco said, but he wore a slight smile on his face. "When should we meet up? Can't be with other people around though, everyone thinks I hate you."
Hermione and Ron faced him, frowns on their faces. They sat in the great hall for breakfast, waiting for mail.
He remembered when Malfoy had first tried to be his friend. He had held out his hand, waiting for Harry to take it, and of course Harry didn't as he had just insulted Ron. Harry realized now that Malfoy had been like that because of what his father had told him.
"Look at me in the eyes." He said seriously. Draco obeyed, tears threatening to spill out of his silver eyes, his face red.
"Ok, I was eleven! How was I supposed to know that Slytherin wasn't that bad! Anyways the Slytherin/ Gryffindor rivalry didn't help that. Also, Gryffindor is easily the best house, we've been over this." Harry argued. "Gryffindor won the house cup four years in a row!"
They were an inch apart. Harry avoided eye contact with him. Draco leaned in and pressed his mouth to Harry's lips. Something felt wrong.
"You can. This summer. We'll find somewhere to stay, far away from any cities. Somewhere open and free. Where we can be together and not have to worry about anything." Harry promised.
"But Hermione, if the Ministry of Magic finds out I preformed that curse I could be thrown right into Azkaban, especially considering it could result in the death of an upper class pure blood student who is the son of a man who  works at the ministry and would stop at nothing to get his way. I mean three years ago he blackmailed the council members to send Dumbledore out of the school. Imagine of he found out that I cursed his son to a death sentence."
He did exactly what Draco insisted he do. He lied. And with that, Dumbledore managed to save all their asses. But now Dumbledore was no longer at Hogwarts. That was the price payed. He was gone.
"I'm trying to, yes. It's hard, and it's scary. But I think it'll be alright in the end." Draco said thoughtfully.
Draco paused for a second. " I was remembering the first time I told you I loved you. We were by the lake, and it was autumn. The sun was setting. Everything was beautiful. And I had you."
"You. Are the bravest person I've met. And a fucking great wizard. We all have are weaknesses Harry. Don't let one fall cloud every thing else." Draco told him seriously. Then he grinned. "I love you."
"If you try this shit again, you will loose that prefect badge. I'll ensure it." Hermione threatened, and the two of them looked in awe, Ron in slight fear. They've only heard Hermione use that language when referencing to professor Trelawney. Or Umbridge.
"I don't care." Draco smiled. "I figured you'd be sleeping by now. I thought I'd have to wake you up."
"I didn't know there was vodka!" Draco slurred excitedly as Harry handed him the cup. Fred and George roared with laughter as Draco downed the water. Draco smiled drunkenly at Harry before turning back to Fred and George to continue his story about apples.
But as he stared down at the field, eyes following the blond streak circling smoothly around the field, Harry began to wonder more about Malfoy. Harry had observed as Malfoy and him talked alone with each other, Malfoy became less of the awful person Harry made him out to be. Harry was curious about him. He was curious if Malfoy really meant everything he said to him in the past, or if it was just an act being performed for an audience that gave him no mercy.
"I understand, I've been a horrid person. I understand that you guys won't trust me right away, and that some of  you might never trust me. I'm only asking for a chance. I really am sorry. Sorry to all of you. I'm sorry for the insults, for treating you cruelly, for judging you based on the purity of your blood and the amount of money you own." Draco looked at Ron for a second. Ron gave him a nod.
"Why do you have him here?" Draco asked. Him? Harry looked at the mound again, trying to figure out what Draco was seeing.
The more he thought about it, the more he concluded that if McGonagall knew everything that had had happened last night, they'd surely be expelled. Anxiety crept up in him.
"I almost thought I might have to take you to Madam Pomfrey for alcohol poisoning." Harry snorted. Hermione just looked at them with a disgruntled expression.
"Ever wonder how Fred and George got around so easily?" Harry smiled smugly. He wasn't going to mention that his dad, a convict escaped from Azkaban
Harry tried to remember reading something about Draco from the Prophet. The articles he was referring to were probably written years ago, he knew Draco was quick to hold grudges.
"Draco, please." Said Harry. "Hagrid's our friend." Draco hesitated before sighing. He faced the giant again.
The cake was brought out, 16 candles lit on top.  Everyone sang in harmony. The cake was cut. Draco took a few bites before giving the rest to Harry.
Harry stood up and cautiously looked into it. Laying in the ash was a book. And in the blink of an eye, it was open. Harry hastily picked it up and read inside it. His heart jumped.
"Exactly." Harry nodded. "So I thought to look in the Library for the book and, of course, I couldn't find it. So last night I ventured to the Restricted section."
"How'd you get in here?" Harry asked groggily. He reached for his glasses before he realized they were still on his face. He pushed them up.
"Well... I mean I whispered it as I read it... but that can't have done anything. I don't know anything about this curse except the incantation. I don't even know how it works or what it's called, let alone how to cast it."
"That was a joke, Potter. Lighten up." Malfoy laughed as he grabbed his things and put them into his bag.
"How about you stand up and explain to the class why you were unable to join us on Wednesday afternoon. We had missed you
Draco took Harry's hand. His fingers cold. Harry held tightly, rubbing circled with his thumb on the back of Draco's hand.
"That's so messed up! Why would people even care if you have a boyfriend? It's not like you're forcing
When they ventured to the forest, Hermione brought Umbridge into deep shit. Centaurs. And they themselves were saved by Grawp.
He woke up in the hospital wing. He felt sore, but the pain had dissipated. His arm was still in a sling though. He sat up, and reached for his glasses on the table by his bed.
Sure enough, more Death Eaters spilled into the room. Jets of green and red light flashed all around the room.
A curse hit Harry directly in he chest and he couldn't help but scream from the blinding pain. His whole body gave out and he couldn't help but scream. He was no longer in control of his body, he writhed around. Spots in his vision. This is what the Cruciatus Curse felt like.
"Wee Draco's been a naughty boy." Bellatrix was right behind them. Blood trailed down her gaunt face, glass shards cut gashes in her arms and dress. " We can't have another traitor in the family. Oh no, the dark lord wouldn't like that."
"Stupify!" Ron and Draco yelled in sync, and then slytherin was blasted backwards in his chair, slumped back into unconsciousness.
"So there's a new member in the DA, whom I thought I should talk to you about." Harry cleared his throat. Everyone looked around the room to see if they could find this new person.
The lion treaded beside the stag. The animals circled eachother playfully. Then they made eye contact. They approached eachother, and pressed their heads together softly. They faded from view.
"You became famous a literal year after you were born. You probably got sent to the care of someone that coddled you. Don't pretend like you know." Draco sneered.
"You think it's that easy, Potter?" Malfoy rolled his eyes. "My father would kill me before the Curse has the chance to."
Followed by Sirius came Professor Lupin, along with Bellatrix chasing after him, a wild look in her eyes.
"Well I found this spell translated into English. And i know it was a spell because I knew a few words in Latin because i had to study Latin in muggle school and i still remember a bit of it. And as I read it i kinda whispered it out loud. And after I read it i heard a noise and looked at the Marauder's Map and guess who had also decided to also pay a visit to the restricted section."
Harry leaned back in bed with a sigh. He could tell this would only be the start of nightmares to come.
Harry and Draco sat side by side, leaning on the trunk of the tree looking out at the beautiful water of the lake. Sometimes the squid would pop out from the surface, and Harry would point it out to Draco with a smile. They talked about many different things, from classes to hobbies.
Mrs. Weasley still came. He'd told her that Draco had the flu. She brought him chicken soup, a worried expression always on her face. Draco accepted the soup graciously but he couldn't keep it down. He couldn't keep anything down.
Harry thought it best not to explain. Better for Draco. Safer. The less contact he had with Draco, the less suspicion Umbridge would have. His heart hurt, but he knew that if Draco and him talked about it, he'd end up changing Harry's mind. Harry knew that he couldn't face Draco.
A Death Eater cackled behind the threatening man. "Another traitor in the family, Lucius? Must be bad blood."  There were a couple of chuckles.
"Well... Not everyone'll fail..." He hesitated. He wasn't sure whether or not he should tell Draco about Dumbledore's Army. Harry certainly trusted him, but he was unsure if Ron and Hermione would as well. He knew they were skeptical of him. Harry decided he would tell Draco anyways, but before he could, Draco cut it.
"Oh there's a manditory meeting today that all the Teachers have to attend. " Harry informed him. Draco nodded warily.
"Oh...didn't really give off the tone of a joke." Harry said as he pulled his own bag over his shoulder.
But he knew that he couldn't continue forever. He felt weak, but he continued sending spells Draco's way.
"I think its time for us to go to sleep. We can figure out what to do with the book in the morning." Ron yawned.
"You deserve kindness, Draco." Harry said, reading his sad eyes. "You deserve friendship, love, all those things."
"Definitely." Harry grinned. It was Draco's turn to lead him. They walked for a few minutes, before Draco stopped them in front of a shabby, small place. It looked old, with tinted windows. the metal sign was bent and shook with every cool gust of wind.
"Let the boy go." Dumbledore ordered. Wind swirled angrily around them and Draco dropped to the floor. Harry ran to Draco, kneeling to his side.
They faced a huge mound of what looked like boulders and earth. Harry's heart raced, wondering what Hagrid had in store. Draco looked terrified as he stared at the mound. He grasped his hand tighter and moved closer to Harry. Hermione looked absolutely shellshocked.
Hermione did end up giving him the sickles the next day. He pretended to smile and he thanked her. But right as she was about to walk off to the girls dorm, he stopped her.
"Er... would you like to come to the Three Broomsticks with me?" Harry asked, pushing his glasses up. Draco nodded slowly.
A shield of magic formed around Harry. He willed himself to crawl to Draco's side, shielding the unconscious boy.
Soon enough people bustled through the door and Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione went upstairs to Draco's room. Draco sat at the edge of his bed, and Harry sat next to him.
He struggled to spit out any words for a minute, holding one finger up, before spitting out a firm "yes."
"That's fair." Draco shrugged, and before Harry could stop him, Draco climbed ontop of the nearest table.
"I do have some drawings in my bag... this year I've had much more time to draw because I don't really care about school much anymore." He pulled out a sketch book from his bag, and opened it to show Harry.
Harry walked over to them. Draco gave him a look that was colder than ice. Although Harry had expected his glare, his heart dropped.
"Are you really sure you should be reading through that book? I mean you read a few words out loud and ended up accidentally cursing someone to death! This has to be the most dangerous book I've ever seen."
"Don't worry, we've been in the forest loads of times. As long as you're smart about your surroundings you should be fine." Harry reassured.
Harry waited for her to get onto him more as she looked around, making sure they wouldn't be overheard. Hermione's expression was softer, which surprised Harry. She leaned in.
"Is that...me? "Draco asked faintly. Harry looked closely and noticed photos pinned to the board. They were of Draco standing on the table, long flowing hair and glittery.
Harry continued the next few days as if he never became friends with Draco Malfoy. Draco seemed to realize this and after his first few fruitless attempts to talk to Harry, Draco's attitude became cold towards Harry.
Harry recounted Voldemort's return. Cedric's death. He answered the questions she asked. Draco listened intently as well, hearing what actually happened for the first time. It didn't take as long as Harry had expected.
"Dumbledore has a good reason to hand out those points. I didn't see any of you guys fight of Voldemort." Harry huffed. "Honestly, I can't believe you're comparing Dumbledore to
"Ok look, I was eleven first of all. And you'd just insulted my friend and his family. And I'd just been told that 'not a single witch or wizard who went bad wasn't in Slytherin'. Second of all, Slytherin is
Harry didn't answer. Draco most certainly was not looking better. He was thinning and constantly tired. He was weak and he couldn't get up or down the stairs without assistance. He'd often get violent shivers out of no where, and he'd occasionally get dizzy spells that lasted for an extended amount of time. He was looking far from better. He was dying.
"Well Ron... it's a long story. He's not a Gryffindor... he was just wearing my scarf. And his hair was a different colour than usual. I- I'm dating Draco." Harry told him, looking around to make sure no one heard. The room was empty so of course no one heard.
As Harry began to notice they were nearing the trap door to the Honeyduke's cellar, he pressed his fingers to his lips, signaling Draco to be quiet. When they reached it, they silently listened to see if they could hear if any one was there. Once they were sure that it was silent behind the door, Harry draped the cloak around the two of them. With difficulty, they carefully pushed through the trap door.
Draco's chest was still warm. His heart beat strong. Harry's breathing was relaxed as he just lay against Draco, his mind calm. Draco and him were content.
"Well I wanted to know how you two felt about Malfoy joining the DA. I figured it give you two and everyone else a chance to get to know him better.
"I'll see you after classes, Potter. Meet me here. We'll work more on researching the curse." Malfoy said.
Harry opened his eyes to see an angry and impatient Malfoy staring down at him. He was covered in cold sweat and he felt nauseous and shaky.
Harry pointed to the map and whispered 'Mischief Managed' and the words disappeared. He slipped it into his pocket.
"I mean, you can be a git sometimes, but y'know I really think you've actually started to change. And I mean, Harry trusts you. And Hermione has started to. So I think maybe I should look into that too. " Ron nodded.
"How do you expect to figure out if he's actually there or not?" Ron asked. Harry thought for a second before he had an idea.
"The only reason that Slytherin won this year was because Umbridge handed out points to Slytherin like candy and gave a handful if you the power to deduct points from other houses. That is the most unfair thing."
"I'm a terrible person. And I've finally been able to see it. And I've realized-" He choked. "God, I've realized that this isn't the person I want to die as."
"Harry, we don't want to rush this. It looks complicated and we don't know what will actually happen if we give it to Draco."
"Thank you, Harry." Draco said, handling the cloak carefully. "I'll be sure to give it back as soon as I can."
"Well I got a friend out of all of this and I've never had one of those before, so that's quite exciting for me, if I'm being honest. I just wish it could last longer. But no point on lingering on that. Gotta focus on the time I do have. I've gotta live."  He stared up at the winding branches of the tree.
Malfoy didn't say anything in response. He just opened the book again with hesitation and continued to scan through the pages.
"I can guess though..." Harry looked down. " I really am so sorry. I'm so sorry." Harry found himself being the one trying to pointlessly mask the cracks in his voice this time.
Draco nodded, a smile on his face and looked out into the lake. Harry knew they should head back to the castle as the sun was beginning to set, yet he didn't want to. He just wanted to stay with with Draco. But then he remembered that his invisibility cloak was still in the common room, and it'd be more trouble then what it was worth to try and sneak around the school after curfew.
mud-blood in second year, because it was a word he learned from his father. And He needed to stay true to his father.
." The boy cackled and the wand flew out of his hand before he could disarm himself. He didn't dare move to grab it.
