"Don't react, you must wait for my signal, Potter. If you fuck this up for me it'll be a lot worse than my cock up your arse, understand?"
Harry grunts, an ugly acknowledgement and tries to get his bearings on the situation. At least there was only one other person in the room, that thin smiling man, looking for all the world like a new parent. He focuses again, gathering his magic as Draco slides him his wand and whispers instructions, still pounding into his arse.
Hermione had had her suspicions when Dumbledore himself had first shown up to woo them away from their research.
"Dr Potter, Dr Granger, this is my lawyer, Mr Riddle." he said, gesturing to the thin man opposite. "He's actually the reason you're all here! He insisted we needed an expert's endorsement for the project to move forward."
Draco looks at him curiously.
"I agree wholeheartedly," Dr Malfoy added. "It is undoubtedly a foolish endeavour. An incredible feat of technology that you could manage this, yes, but really, did you even wonder whether or not you
Harry moans pathetically as hands tip him onto his front. They manipulate him, tugging at his clothes, until he's naked on the rug, presenting like a bitch in heat when really all he wants to do is curl up and find his damn magic. He cries out as something hard and wet presses in at his backside, and he spares a bleary thought that at least they used lube, before they're fucking him open, brutally taking him.
"Knew you'd like this, Draco," he mutters and rucks Draco's Auror robes up over his hips. Harry tries to shove Draco's trousers and pants down and curses as they get caught around his wide-legged stance, tied to the desk as he is. Draco stifles a gasp as the clothes disappear entirely, leaving only the red Auror robes bunched over his waist.
“We have a problem young Malfoy.”  Draco didn't say anything, any retort he could come up with would just be turned back around on him. “You can move freely into the lavatory where Harry was, injured?” Draco noticed the way he hesitated before the word injured.
They were talking about Harry Potter. They were about to make an attack. Draco tuned back out, he didn’t want to listen.
So why then, was Draco having second thoughts?
“Don’t move” Harry said softly he cringed at the sound of his voice. He hadn’t heard himself speak in awhile.
“A friend,” Harry said noncommittally. Ron didn't push. He never really did. He handed Harry parchment when they reached the kitchen and a quill and Harry scratched out his quick message, handing it to the owl and watching it take flight. It would reach Draco before Harry could.
Being a death eater did, didn't it? Harry thought remembering the dark mark etched into Malfoy’s skin.
“Yes, I think I know a lost cause when I see one.” The words were light, pleasant almost. For anyone who hadn’t spent years listening to Dumbledore, you would think it was all a joke.
“It is out of my hands,” Dumbledore said, making a show of holding out his hands like he was showing Draco there was nothing he could do.
Draco picked up his pace nearing more of a jog than a walk, Harry had been in a coma for a week now but for some reason, it felt like Draco was watching the last few grains of sand drain out of an hourglass. He had done well to follow his gut over the past several days. They led him to find Harry, to the mirror, and now his gut was leading him to the hospital wing as if he was on one end of a rope being pulled. He had to hand it to Granger. She was very good at keeping up and seemed to sense his urgency, as they neared the hospital wing they both broke out into a dead sprint at the same time leaving Ron calling for them to wait up, behind them.
“Wha-“ the boy started to say trying to move his head
“Figured you'd come back eventually.” Blaise Zabini said cooly
This was something Harry would never get over. The beauty of magic. The warmth in the air as things were put right. He could feel it. He could breathe it in as it moved around him. For a moment he was alright with it. Then the spell was over, the house was put back the way it was meant to be. And the feeling of magic left him.
“Blimey, but you didn’t have to be so rough about it.” The man said, rubbing a spot on his rather round stomach. Dumbledore was positioned in front of Harry enough that the man hadn’t yet noticed him. “What gave me away?”
The burrow was tall, leaning slightly, and warm-looking. He trudged his way to it, having been left in the swampy marsh around the house. Left by Dumbledore. Every step felt heavy with weight Harry should have grown used to by now. Every step felt wrong in this place he was usually so comfortable in.
Days passed the same as the last. He woke up with Harry, they went to potions or they went flying, Draco forgot he even had a schedule of classes tucked away in a forgotten textbook under his bed. They had meals at their respective house tables and then spent all their spare time in the library trying to figure out what connected him and he-who-must-not-be-named. Draco had tried on numerous occasions to tell them there was no need, he hasn't been sucked back into those nightmares. Into that room, in weeks. He did not tell the others that the only difference was that Harry was spending his nights in the same bed.
This one was quite a bit taller than him and he had to forcefully throw the sheet in order to reveal what lay beneath it. It was a large mirror that his mother would have adored, and for good reason, it was beautifully made. Draco would have to blind not to see that. He glanced into the mirror for a second and saw his puffy face and immediately felt ashamed. But he was caught off guard when the picture started to change. That's when he realized what this was. The mirror of Erised. Draco didn't know if he wanted to see what the mirror would show him. He didn't know if he was ready.he wasn't sure why he felt that way but before he could question his own thought process he turned around and stalked angrily out of the room kicking the shaking trunk on his way past pretending that it didn't hurt his foot as bad as it did. He walked out into the hall and started towards the dungeons, to the Slytherin common room. He could hear voices bouncing around the corridors but they sounded far off. Draco ignored them but quickened his pace.
“Mister Malfoy, if you could kindly explain what it is that happened?” Draco looked up slowly to meet the headmaster's eyes. He could practically feel the ginger boy glaring at him and in his head, he pictured him as Potter’s guard dog, the thought caused his lips to twitch up in an almost smile.
That was fast! well hopefully they will all be fast because i have just set the ridiculously outrageous goal to complete the entire second half of this fic by January 8th. (spoiler alert idk if ima make it) but goals are fun! even the hard ones like posting 20 chapters in the span of three months! hahaha well here goes nothing!
“What do you have?” Harry said he was interested now. Call it self-preservation or blatant curiosity. He sat next to Ron.
“Who's there?” Draco said internally flinching at the sound of his voice cutting through the almost silence. He was about to say something else but his words died in his throat and the panic that had all but dissipated, came rushing back. He has been a student at Hogwarts for 6 years now. And hed been witness for some awful things done at the hands of Voldemort and his father. But nothing really came close to what he could see now. To what he had blindly run past just moments ago. The entire room seemed stained. Of course, it was not the entire room but Draco's tunnel vision made it seem like the entire room. Red, Draco's favorite color. Red splattered on the floor, not 2 feet from where he was standing. Red droplets leading from the crude looking splatter to a stall door. A door with half a red handprint smeared on the edge. Red. Draco didn't know what he was doing. In his head, he knew he needed to run and to get help and to not touch anything just to get a teacher to handle this, but there was a pull. His feet moved without permission, following the path of red, going against everything his mind was screaming at him. He reached out his hand to push the door open. A part of him was terrified of what he would find hiding behind the stall door. There was, however, a part of him that knew. The door swung open and everything inside of him fell to pieces.
He crossed the room and fell onto his four-poster bed, his head fell into his hands. He remembered when he was younger. Eleven years old, ready to head off to Hogwarts for the first time. He remembered how proud his father had been when he was sorted into Slytherin. It was such a happy time for their family. Draco took a lot of pride in being a Slytherin. Maybe more pride than in his family name right now. Draco used to look up to his father, used to be proud of him and his family name. It was startling to Draco that he no longer did.
It was fairly a straightforward plan. As plans of his could go. It was at least better than “don’t die, don’t get anyone killed” though that was just as much a part of this plan as any other, he tacked on a silent ‘or worse expelled’ that seemed to be a running theme year after year as well.
It was the simple things that got Harry through the Summers.
In a way he was right.
“Sod off Zabini I need sleep.” Draco cleared his throat in hopes he’d sound normal. The other boy looked at him for a long moment causing Draco to squirm in his spot. Until finally he hopped off of Draco's bed.
He vaguely hears Harry talking to him and it starts to bring him out of it.
Blood wasn’t a foreign sight to Harry. To most people, the sight of so much of it would likely lead to a fit of nausea or even a fainting spell. Harry was used to open wounds and red was his favorite color
“You can go if you want. You didn't have to stay here for me” Ron gave him a look that screamed ‘you've got to be kidding me’ and took another bite of sandwich.
Also I try to make sure to add warnings in my notes beforehand if I miss anything please let me know so I can edit in! Thank you!
“Thanks”
“It tends to run in families, not always. I'm sure you've heard of Sirius Black. All his lot was in my house, but not Sirius,  no sir he was a Gryffindor. He's dead, you know.” It was with a casualty that one could only talk about death when they didn’t care in the slightest, that he said this. Harry thought he was going to be sick. He felt red hot and faint and like his stomach was twisting around itself.
would be staying here.
“There are exceptions to every rule.”
“You’re not sending him back” He echoed Potter, looking almost desperately at the headmaster who held up another dismissive hand in an attempt to silence him.
Platinum blonde hair. That’s what it looked like Harry thought. Probably just something left behind from the children yesterday. He started to continue on his walk. But stopped again when he heard a strained cough.
Draco glanced back at the empty seat only to realize at some point Severus Snape had joined the group. It wasn’t good that Draco could miss that. If he missed too much he’d get himself into trouble. He tuned back into the meeting.
The bleeding stopped soaking through towels and Harry felt exhausted again.
“Oh, I don't know maybe you could tell me what happened to Potter?” Blaise was taller than him by a few inches and it infuriated him to no end to have to look up at somebody. People should have to look up to him.
“Did you forget that the Dark Lord, the most powerful wizard of our time, did you not think he could tell that you are untrue?” His father was whispering angrily over him. Draco was still stunned from the slap to let the words sink in. “you have killed us all” and then the room was filling with more people. But the only thing Draco could focus on was his mother. The strongest person Draco had ever known. His mother was on the floor hugging herself with tears running down her face, a hand clamped over her mouth to try and silence her cries.
Today it looked like fire dancing across the horizon. He stood there a little longer watching the dark fade into the pale blue of morning. And then he turned around and started walking back. Not back to the Dursleys, but the park, at least until he was sure Uncle Vernon was gone for the day and he could sneak back into his room to find spare change enough to buy himself something to eat, or at least coffee to get him through wandering around the rest of the day.
“You wished to see me?” Draco never thought he'd be so ecstatic to hear the monotone voice of his head of house.
“You aren’t leaving, are you? So soon?” So much for Just One drink. Harry thought.
“Hermione's here?”
Draco couldn’t comprehend it. The voices were still whispering as if he and Potter weren’t here. As if there wasn’t so much blood soaked into their clothes that the stench of iron hung in the air. It was like they weren’t even there.
“Then we will see you at the feast,” Dumbledore said warmly.  Horace went back inside. “Well done Harry”
He was standing alone for a minute, but he already knew something about his appearance seemed different, happier. He was wearing a red t-shirt and muggle jeans, and the pale skin on his left arm was clean. The mark was no longer there. The mark that now itched under the sleeve of his shirt. He almost thought that was it. That his deepest desire was simply not to be marked. However, a figure was walking up behind his reflection. Their face was blurred at first but in his soul, Draco knew, just like he always knew that everything in his life would always come down to this. And sure enough, his face came into focus, framed by messy dark hair, and he was smiling. Harry Potter was in the mirror, and he was laughing and pushing at Draco. They were happy together, and the Harry in front of him entwined his fingers with Draco and he wished so much that he could be that Draco.
Hope you like this chapter let me know what you think! there's lots more to come.
Draco never asked again.
Dumbledore turned, an eyebrow raised “You'll come out of retirement?”
It was an honor, his father had said, to be invited to these meetings. To be chosen to help the Dark Lord achieve his goals. An honor to be chosen to take the dark mark at his young age. Draco had been ecstatic at the beginning of the summer at the news. He’d attended the meetings, and was given a mission, to prove himself, the Dark Lord had said. His father had told him how proud he was of Draco. His father had told him what an honor it was.
“Funny how that happens sometimes isn’t it,” He said, shaking his head as though the thought was absurd.
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, sobs racking his body, but when the shaking finally stopped and he allowed himself to sit up, daylight streamed through the high windows of the classroom. His head throbbed behind his eyes and his breath came ragged, ripping through his raw throat. His body ached as he uncurled it limb by limb. He pulled himself up and took in the room he was in.
Draco was relieved for himself and sick for his father and the way he shrank back. Shoulders back. Chin up. But his father cowered. And handed over his wand.
“Come on Ron.” Hermione pulled at his arm. She looked like she was close to tears. Draco looked away. Seeing people cry made him very uncomfortable, it was something that was always looked down on in his home growing up.
“You know I can’t leave someone dying and not do anything about it.” Draco looked again to Potter, staring at him even. The tension between the two was unlike anything Draco had ever felt before. He’d always thought Potter and the headmaster were close. That Potter trusted the old man. He was supposed to be the good guy. Dumbledore and Harry were supposed to save everyone. However, it was clear in the set of Potter’s jaw that that was not the case. Draco could feel himself wilting. He could feel some small shred of hope buried somewhere deep in him shrivel and disappear. He felt robbed of something fundamental. Something he didn't even know he was holding onto. Some hope he must have been clinging to since before Harry Potter became someone he loathed rather than a fairy tale.
“Draco you have to run,” That hadn’t come from Harry. That was another voice. A voice he knew well. That was his mother's voice. He looked up, searching for her, but there was no one there. No one but him and Potter who was looking at him with eyes as wide as they could go being half swollen shut.
The house was silent and he whispered a near-silent “Thank Merlin'' as he toed the door the rest of the way closed. The soft click echoed in Harry's ears and he stilled for a few moments to make sure no one had heard. To make sure his aunt hadn’t heard.
Someone was here then. They had to be. Was he In danger? Was someone watching him. Or perhaps some small child was an unknown witch or wizard just waiting for their Hogwarts letter. But there were no children here. Option one seemed far more likey then.
Two hours and three letters later Harry was done. He thought he’d written to the people with the biggest chance of caring, or ability to help. First was Dumbledore. The first letter Harry had written with blood still sticky on his hands. Leaving red fingerprints along the edges of the page. Good. maybe that would get his attention. The next was to professor McGonagall. The head of Gryffindor house and the one who offered him a biscuit when he’d gone off on Umbridge rather than scolding him for it. And the last letter, the one Harry wasn’t sure he was going to write at first, was to Severus Snape. Not someone Harry trusted or even liked. In fact, Harry knew he was aligned with Voldemort even if, for whatever reason, no one trusted him on it. He also knew that he was Draco Malfoy’s Godfather. The term hurt Harry. Godfather. It tore through him with a vengeance after a full summer of pushing away the loss of his own Godfather. But now wasn’t the time to mourn. He addressed each letter and wondered how to go about sending them.
“You seemed to have managed” Dumbledore was saying. “Young Malfoy is looking just fine and we are rather busy preparing for the beginning of term.”
“Both I think,” Harry said trying to shake the tremor out of his hands.
The park was hot. Sweat trickled down his neck and back making him feel wet and gross. Harry always felt gross over the summer. He hated the raw heat.
They were alone in the kitchen as Ron scarfed down a sandwich and then another. Harry let himself just be in the space. Trying to push away the worry and the dream and Horace and Dumbeldore and all of it.
He hadn’t been too keen on realizing even here he had a babysitter. And that apparently the goings-on at number four Privet Drive wasn’t cause enough for Dumbledore to involve himself. He remembered breaking down in front of her when he found out why she was there and what all she knew. He had thought at the time if she had only told Dumbledore he wouldn’t have had to go back. But she had told him. And Dumbledore did nothing.
“Harry,” Hermione said, jumping up and smiling at him as if he didn't just walk in on everybody talking about him.
The sound of bare feet could be faintly heard to one end of the room. He was here. He took his seat at the head of the table and only when he opened his arms and greeted them with a hissed ‘welcome’ were they allowed to be seated.
Draco stared at his hands, but they didn't look like his hands. They were stained with thick red and the sight made his stomach churn. An urgent conversation was going on around him and he knew most of it was questions for him, but he could only look at his hands, clenching and unclenching his fists. He started to scratch at his skin, he wanted the stains to go away, to disappear. He wanted it all to disappear.
They ended up not going to Diagon Alley, Ron seemed content to sit around with him for most of the day. Talking about quidditch and the first trip they would take to Hogsmeade. Harry told Ron about meeting Slughorn but not that he had spent a few days at the castle with Draco. He didn't tell him that the friend he sent a letter to was Draco. He didn't tell him anything about Draco. . He wasn’t keeping it from Ron so to speak, he was just worried about what reaction he would get from him. Ron hated Draco and with good reason. He had no idea what the past few days meant between him and Draco. And if that was anything that could end up being friendship what would that mean for Ron and Hermione.
“Wait.” she interrupted again holding her hand out to stop him. “you said you went to the crime scene and didn't use any magic?” she asked
“My knowledge of the mirror or Erised is quite limited im afraid” Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips. “Do you still have it?”
The Dark Lord was standing now, walking towards them. Draco bit the inside of his cheek.
Harry pulled himself back to the men in the room. While he was distracted with the clean-up, He must have moved deeper into the room because now he stood in the middle of it. Horace was looking at him the way Harry was so used to strangers looking at him. Wide-eyed and mouth opened in a silent ‘oh’.
Once the laugh escaped his lips, something else tried to follow. Something from deep inside his chest tried desperately to tear free of its bone cage and climb up his throat. Harry swallowed the lump. He would not cry. Not in his aunt and uncle's house. Not kneeling next to Draco Malfoy. Not with his hands stained crimson as he tried to save a life rather than end it. Harry would not cry. There was no need.
The sickening crack that sounded when his head connected with the wall.
“What about Potter '' he blurted, the forced calm he’d been trying to hold onto was slipping from him and it could be heard in the slight tremor when he said the other boy's name.
“I dunno. I recognized them in the dream but I can't picture their face now” Ron nodded.
“Except for the Malfoys,” the Dark Lord said, almost as an afterthought. Draco felt cold as he stood there. He wanted to look to his father for help but he didn’t, instead, he stood there beside his father and his mother next to him, waiting. “Oh forgive me, the elder of the Malfoys. Draco may go.” He stood there a second too long, hesitation was a sign of weakness. He tried to cover it up by bending slightly in a bow.
While deep in thought Harry had snuck into the bathroom and retrieved a pile of Petunia's fluffy white towels. Harry lowered himself to his knees on the floor next to the bed, or rather, mattress on the floor. He had had a bedframe once. In truth, he couldn’t remember how it had broken. Just that he no longer had one. He sat back on his heels and assessed the damage with unattached emotion. He peeled the fabric of Malfoy’s shirt away from the wound.
But Harry was alone. Wasn’t he?
this is very much a project I love working on, its an idea that's been around my head for years now and its all coming together on paper so now all that's left is to see how you enjoy it! please let me know your opinions!
If the walk from the park to the house was rough on Harry’s always aching limbs, it had nothing on the trek up the stairs. His whole body shook when his feet fell on the top step. All at once, the relief at being almost there was replaced with his sinking heart. His bedroom door was wide open. Meaning, his uncle had spent at least a few minutes looking for him this morning. That was never a good sign. He fought against the tremble that had begun to creep up his spine and made his way through the doorway. At least he wouldn't have to worry with another doorknob.
And right now, in muggle little whinging. It felt like magic.
“To see Harry.” Draco rasped, stopping only to nod at Granger who nodded back at him.
“Your house?” He asked, rather than say anything he would have to take back later.
“Your… your safe” the word safe tasted like a lie in his mouth. Tasted like acid and made the back of his left hand itch.
“What, what do you mean?” He tried to pull his mask back on, to stand straighter, but it felt like the world was threatening to crush him in that moment. There were footsteps in the hall behind her. Multiple footsteps and Draco felt his fight or flight reflex trying to surface. He wanted to run.
“I didn’t know I was,” He admitted “Dumbledore,” He said instead of a real answer. She nodded as if that made perfect and complete sense. And it did. Dumbledore wasn’t in the Habit of making his plans known to anyone but himself. Harry did try not to think this bitterly. Mr. Weasly clapped him on the back smiling at him.
Malfoy gagging and bleeding. Pomfrey and Snape taking turns shouting for things from each other. The way he was certain he heard his name, McGonnagal rushing into the room just before Dumbeldore whisked him away.
Nineteen down an unknown amount to go! as always let me know what you liked and what you didn't!
that he couldn’t quite put a name to. It was important. Whatever it was that he was missing was important,
Tears!? Bloody Tears? Why the fuck was he crying. He closed the door behind him and slid to the floor hugging his knees. Why was he crying? ‘Because he's dead’ he thought to himself bitterly. Yes, so Harry Potter's dead that's good that should be a good thing shouldn't it? No more pressure from his father to get information about the damned boy, no more being involved in the dark lord's plot to kill him, because he was already dead. He was the bane of Draco's existence and he hated him so why in the fuck is he sitting here crying over his death like a bloody girl?!
Don’t look him in the eye.
The house looked not just abandoned but much like it should be a crime scene.  If anyone was in there Harry wasn’t sure he wanted to be the one to find them. He had seen more than enough Death and Blood recently. Dumbledore walked up the paved sidewalk to the door. Harry really shouldn’t have been shocked. He followed because at this point his only way back to the castle was Dumbledore, and while he was sure he could catch the train if he really wanted to leave the Headmaster here he would rather get back sooner. Soon as he could, which would mean going along with whatever this plan of his was.
He wrapped his arms loosely around his knees and watched the horizon. He could admit he was angry with being dropped on the Weasly’s doorstep without a second thought. Wouldn’t be the first time he was left on a doorstep by Dumbledore though. The thought made him smile even if it was flat.
“You’re daft if you think sending him back there is a good idea,” Draco said flatly.
Draco died nearly three hours later. Three hours of Madam Pomfrey working over him. Three hours of held breaths and pacing. Three hours of Severus Snape yelling at Albus Dumbledore, throwing the freshly brewed Veritaserum at his head. Three hours after Harry Potter woke up.
The common room was almost empty only a few seventh years looked up when he entered. He shot a glare at them and they both quickly went back to what they were doing. Being the prince of Slytherin did have its perks he thought as he made his way to the dormitories. The dormitories which should have been empty. And was save for one figure lounged out on Draco's bed. Draco was too tired to be rightfully angry.
“Potter,” he whispered barely above a breath. The other boy looked at him, startled and wide-eyed and for a flash of a moment Draco caught himself wanting to go back to that house and… “Are you alright?” it was starting to feel wrong to even think of him as Potter after everything he’d seen.
“Oh, i will have none of this.” Madam Pomfrey muttered. “Utter nonsense.” she continued as she walked away from them and towards the aurors. “Who sent you here?” he could hear her demand.” she lead them away and Draco couldn't hear anymore.
“I get it, Potter.” Draco slid to the floor his back against Harry's bed. “The pressure you were under, I was under it too.”  Draco dropped Harry's wand  “I'm sorry I couldn't save you harry. I'm so sorry I couldn't keep you safe.” a last tear slid down Draco's face and the room grew fuzzy. “I'm so sorry Harry,” he breathed.
“You better hope that he's okay Malfoy.” the way he said his name made it sound like it was a dirty word. Draco looked away as the remaining two-thirds of the golden trio walked past him and out of Dumbledore's office.
it.” Harry felt nauseous. “Whoever it was, I thought they deserved it. But then someone interrupted, someone I knew and it surprised me enough to see them that Voldemort noticed I was there and severed the connection.” Harry wasn’t meeting Ron's eyes. He waited for his friend to say something, anything would be good enough for him but Ron sat there considering for endless minutes.
“Ron, please.” Hermione hiccuped.
Everything continued until the cold came. Fall and its usual chill that prepared everyone for the snow of winter. That's when it started to get bad again.
“Just what do you think you’re doing Mister Malfoy.” Madam Pomfrey asked sternly. It was clear the way she positioned herself in between him and the curtains that she wasn’t going to let him pass her easily.
“Very well. Severus, I expect the proper amount by tonight. That will be all.”
“Not really,” He answered honestly. He felt her looking at him then. “There's something I need to tell you both, I don’t know what it means if it means anything I just know well I don't I don't know anything Mione.” She nodded patiently.
He held his shoulders back, kept his chin up but his eyes down and he followed his mother and father into the long black room that once served as a place for his father to hold meetings with people he wanted to intimidate.
Harry Potter, Golden boy, The Chosen One, Saviour of the Wizarding World, Harry Potter down the bloody stairs.
He turned to face Hermione again, an apology in his eyes for what he was about to do. He took a few steps closing the distance between himself and granger and plucked her wand out of its pocket in her robe. He didn't stop long enough to notice how she didn't fight him and willingly let him take her wand. Instead, he focused all his attention, all his panic, all his anger on the Aurors, now just a few paces away from him, and yelled ‘stupefy’ brandishing Hermione's wand at the men.
“You’re not sending him back,” Potter said incredulously. “We don’t even know who’s bloody trying to kill him” Sending him back... That's what Potter was worried about? Sending Draco home. He fought the urge to roll his eyes. Home was the safest place for him, surely Potter couldn’t think he’d gotten this hurt there? He thought of his mother and his father, always there for him always protecting him. For a moment when he thought of them though he thought of his mother crying and he thought he felt a burn in his cheek and lip. Home was safe. However, even as he thought so, he was overwhelmed by a fear he couldn’t place.
“Sir, I really wish you would reconsider surely if he's willing to take it that means he's telling the truth isn't that enough, can’t you trust him now?”
“It surprised me more that you were wanting to help young Malfoy'' Dumbledore said. Draco's head snapped up. He didn't like the way that sounded coming from Dumbledore. In fact, everything about the way the headmaster spoke and moved about the room felt uneasy to Draco. It was familiar and it made his skin crawl. ‘Young Malfoy’ it was the way many addressed him, the way many referred to him, and yet. And yet it made him want to run away. Made his throat close up and his fingers tremble. He hated it. And he couldn't place where that hatred came from. He felt sick. “The two of you never have gotten along have you?” He risked a glance at Potter and cringed at the expression peaking through a swollen eye and busted up lip. He had been on the receiving end of such looks from Potter for years. Looking at him like this though, it pulled at him.
“Nightmare or scar?” He asked. Harry wished people would give Ron more credit. He really was a lot smarter than anyone knew. Anyone but him of course.
“Who are we keeping safe?” He asked as casually as he could manage, though he knew good and well who they were talking about. Mr. Weasly was standing talking to Ron, Hermione and Ginny, looking all too serious on the couch. They all looked up at him, various expressions of embarrassment played on each of their faces.
Chapter Twenty-Two right on time! let me know what you think good or bad, this chapter practically wrote itself, wich is a good thing since i had very little time this week to work. i hope you like it i really do.
“I am aware now of certain goings-on and I can assure you I would never put Harry here in any unnecessary danger. He is too important.” Draco seethed, what could make what Draco witnessed necessary? Nothing. “Mister Potter will be well taken care of and returned to the guardianship of his Aunt and Uncle who I will speak to about what is and isn't appropriate." Draco sneered his trademark sneer at the old man.
“Please sit,” He said to Draco once the door was shut and the staircase was done spinning. It wasn't a question or an offer, the please was simply the sugar to make the pill easier to swallow. It was an order, a command. One like you would give an unruly house elf. He took on the same tone that his father used constantly, the only tone Draco’s father ever took with him. “Orders were made to be followed, made to be listened to.” Lucius had made that clear to him as a child. Draco looked at the armchair Dumbledore was gesturing to. Silenced stretched on as Draco took in the armchair in front of him for some reason to him it represented surrender. “What happened.” He asked when it became apparent to him that he wasn't keen on following his orders.
He sat back on the floor, against his door and allowed himself thirty seconds to properly freak out.
“I wouldn't mind.” it came out a whisper. And he flinched away from the glare his godfather shot at him.
‘Purifying’ that's what his father had said. Blood purity was the foundation of what the Dark Lord stood for. The foundation of what the Malfoys always believed. The foundation of what Draco believed. His father told him stories about how the heretic muggle lovers were being wiped out to put those with pure blood back on top where they always belonged.
Harry liked the park this early, and when it was late at night. Those were the times that he would be at least mostly alone. Children didn’t wake early and weren’t out late, at least not the kids that actually enjoyed the park for playing. And if he were to be seen here by his uncle, or Dudley, well they were all too focused on their image to do anything to him here, in plain view of the nicer houses across the field. Houses much too nice for Vernon to afford. Harry snorted at the thought of Vernon confronting him here.
“He thinks I killed him.” Draco's voice almost came out I a whimper.
“My best friend is a muggle-born and she's the smartest in our year,” Harry said cooly.
“Never mind about that how do we fix it? How do we save him?” Draco asked through his teeth.
“The thing Harry Potter used to kill himself with,” he stated dully. There really was no way to sugarcoat it, not that he was ever in the business of sugarcoating anything but he held so much respect for this woman it felt wrong to just blurt something like out with nothing to soften the blow. He could see her eyes start to water but she nodded.
“Draco,” her voice sounded like a warning and it made the hair on the back of his neck stand on end.
“Oh, Harry.” Draco exhaled, ignoring the way his voice cracked. It no longer mattered now. Not here. Here he didn't have to worry about being a Malfoy. What would it help him now? He bit his lip so hard he could taste a slight hint of blood on his tongue. “Harry why,” Draco broke off, glancing away from the boy.  “I bet you'd love this.” Draco chuckled darkly. “As we speak, there are two Aurors outside these curtains who, as soon as they wake up, will be arresting me for killing you.”  Draco swallowed hard. “Why,” he repeated. His voice finally breaking into a strangled sob. “You had everything, Potter. Friends and family and loyalty. Definitely, things I didn't have.” Draco whipped away a tear that had, without permission, fallen down his face. “You know what else I never had potter? A chance. You never gave me a chance.” he could barely speak above a whisper now as more tears threatened to break ranks. “All these years could have been so very different if only you had given me a chance. Not that I deserved one.” he thought over the past few years. “Yeah definitely didn't deserve it but, I would have changed.” he took a few steps closer and placed one of his hands on Harry’s. “For you Harry I could have changed.” the boy looked so very very fragile.
“Don't know how don't know why it feels like such a big thing either.” She pat his knee and gave him an unreadable look.
“Yes, I yeah I have it,” Draco said slowly, the idea of handing it over to anyone still made him feel uneasy.  But he pulled it out of his pocket and held it out to her all the same.
“He can’t go back either, look at him! If anyone needs to see Madam Pomfrey it’s him” He was standing now, in the span of a blink. His side burned but he didn't let it stop him.
Read responsibly and let me know what you think!
The fact that he was covered in blood was for some reason not surprising either. He could feel it in his side. The whispering had stopped and Dumbledore cleared his throat, apparently ready now to acknowledge their existence.
The man in the doorway, the ease in which he threw Potter down the stairs.
“You didn't see it, Mione, I don’t think it is” His voice was childish he couldn't wrap his head around it being a trap, it’s what he thought at first but not now not after Draco saved him. Not after he saved Draco. She hummed softly.
“There's more,” he said quietly waiting until she motioned him to continue. “I found the thing he used to do it.
“He cut himself with a broken piece of the mirror of Erised,” he said turning to Hermione, frantic to tell her the information she would need to save Harry before the two Aurors could take him away. He showered her the piece of glass in his hand before shoving it back into his pocket forcefully, feeling the edge bite into the skin on his finger. If anyone could save him surely it would be Hermione. The only witch to beat him out in grades.
“I had a feeling that might of been the case, even tried to voice the option to Albus but he didn't go for it, Said it couldn't be true.” Draco looked around spotting a tissue box across the room and stood to get it, offering it to her she smiled and took a tissue “please go on mister Malfoy.”
“It’s illegal to force someone to take it I was simply asking a question and I'd like it if you gave Draco a chance to answer for himself.”
“Damned shame I missed him. The whole Black family in green and silver except Sirius. I would have liked the set” Horus said sighing, oblivious to the fist Harry was making around his wand.
“They think you tried to kill Harry. Their aurors.” about that time one of the men looked up from his conversation with Ron and started heading towards Draco.
There were rules.
He walked for a while before the boy stirred. He glanced down to see one gray-blue eye struggling to open and look around.
“Go on Poppy. Hurry.” Dumbledore said as calm as he always was. She disappeared with a snap. “Everyone else goes to your dormitories, now,” he said exuding so much authority everyone was gone within seconds. Everyone except Draco and of course Harry's beloved friends who were already making there way over to him.
that being said this is another short chapter look for chapter fifteen soon! and I hope you enjoy it! lert me know what you think!
“Well it’s possible he was the one to cast the spell in the first place, though I highly doubt it. This spell is much more advanced than almost any student here could cast.” the potions master answered, almost managing to sound bored. Draco felt like he wanted to argue that he could, in fact, cast whatever spell they were talking about, but at the same time, it wouldn't help his current predicament if he argued that point.
“You need to be careful in any matter.” she had the same expression on her face she wore when there was something to solve. “I don’t trust it” Harry curled tighter in on himself. She was right not to, after everything she personally had been through because of him, Harry could hardly expect anything else. “Have you told Ron?”
This was an utter mess. A mess that might lead to the murder of one Harry James Potter. As he pressed the towel to Draco's middle he laughed dryly. Voldemort would be so disappointed his death came about over some ruined towels, rather than the tip of his wand.
“What the hell are you getting at?” Draco said fiercely
. Harry thought dryly and fought the urge to roll his eyes. He was caught off guard however when Horace pointed at him and
all the love
“Malfoy?” He shook his head. He didn't want to hear that name. But he said nothing about it. “Are you alright?” The same question Draco had asked of him earlier.
“You alright mate?” Harry blinked only now remembering he wasn’t alone. He looked over and Ron was sitting on the edge of his bed across the room from him. He was dressed, must have woken up before, and let him rest. He was watching Harry expectantly.
He could see clearly that this wasn’t some one-time thing. Harry Potter was afraid. He was seeing it again.
“Well it is certainly good to have you” He seemed genuine. The Weasleys always were welcoming no matter what it seemed.
let me know what you think, what you like and what you don't!
Here we are at chapter thirteen! lots going on in this one had lots of things to cover to set up the next few chapters. hope you enjoy it! let me know what you think, what you like and what you don't.
“M.. Mother?” he stuttered. Of course, he stuttered, he could never stand tall against his mother. She used to be his safe place. She used to be the only one he didn't have to pretend around. The only one who has ever seen him cry past his toddler years. And Draco very much felt like crying now.
“Oh, you mustn't think me prejudiced!” Oh, must he not? “No no no haven’t I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorites?” Harry was failing to see how that made anything better. He found himself wondering what was taking Dumbledore so long to come back. He was pointing out the other frames, the ones that Harry hadn’t bothered with. Telling him all about who was who and what they did for him. What gifts they sent him.
“Mhm got here a day ago. She was late too. Trains day after tomorrow ya know” Harry bit his lip, he didn’t know, he supposed it was too much to wish for it to be sooner. He nodded despite not knowing. “They wanted to wake you up and all of us go but you looked really tired, told em I’d wait for you. We can floo to Fred and George's shop if you want or we can hang here until they come back. Doesn't matter to me” Harry half-smiled at his friend. He wasn’t much up for going anywhere. But he didn’t exactly want to tell Ron that either. He knew it was asking a lot for Ron to give up an afternoon with Hermione. Even if Ron didn't see it that way yet.
“Draco” His father hissed as quietly as he could, trying not to draw attention to them. Draco looked over his father who was glancing pointedly at Dracos hands. The trembling had gotten worse. Silently Draco took a breath and forced them to be still before blinking coldly at his father and turning away. His father recently taught him to be unwavering. To be stone cold. One thing Draco was good at was pretending.
“Not possible I'm afraid, though I can fix you up real quick while the other doctors do some more tests on Mister Potter, come on up on the bed you go.” she motioned to a bed just behind him and he nodded and let himself be led over to it. He cast a quick glance at Ron and Hermione who looked about at white as ghosts and it occurred to him they haven't been allowed here yet. They must not have known how serious it was. He sighed and let the mediwitch examine him. He bit his lip when she healed his broken nose rather than allowing himself to cry out in pain. Even if he wasn't a Malfoy he was still a Slytherin and Slytherins did not show that kind of weakness.
Trigger Warnings for this chapter!! it does contain literal torture of a teenager. please skip this chapter if that upsets you!!!
This chapter practically wrote itself. I hope you like it!! Let me know what you think!
“Harry, Harry listen to me open your bloody eyes. Do you hear me Potter?” he grunted as he continued to run through the hallways. “Somebody please help me please!” he shouted, hoping he could get somebody's attention. The hospital wing was close, he was almost there, he knew he could make it. But he didn't know if Potter could make it.
“Harry I assure you we won’t be sending him anywhere, Madam Pomfrey should be here by sunrise she’s coming early specifically to check on you two and he’ll be staying in the hospital wing until term begins.” Draco’s head was spinning, the whole room was spinning for that matter but he tightened his grip on the arm of the chair, trying to regain some calm. He would be staying here. That shouldn’t come with so much relief. That shouldn’t make him want to cry. That shouldn’t wait...
Draco couldn’t for the life of him connect the dots that led him here. There were too many missing pieces, gaping holes, and fuzzy outlines of
The Dark Lord was testing him, A test he would have to pass or fail. To pass would mean to live, but to live in service of the Dark Lord. To fail would mean to make his own choices, be his own person, be free. But to fail would also mean to die. So where was the choice?
“Draco..?” the whisper was so desperate and questioning and pure. The boy closed his eyes at the same time that Draco sank to his knees soaking his knees in red. Soaking his knees in blood.
Harry never played here. Not really. As a child, he wasn’t allowed. When he and his cousin were too young to wander alone Petunia would either leave Harry in his closet under the stairs, or she’d keep him on the bench next to her. Not allowed to play in the same space as her precious Dudley.
. So why couldn’t he remember it?
He kicked a rock every few steps. The rock slid across the pavement in front of him skipping and jumping along as Harry kicked it. It was a game he liked to play, see how far he can kick a rock from the park all the way to number 4. It was stupid and mindless. But if he made it all the way back and the rock was still in front of him, he’d leave it in the driveway. It always annoyed his Aunt Petunia who took pride in her perfectly manicured front lawn and all the handpicked stones that went there. And when Aunt Petunia was annoyed, she annoyed Uncle Vernon which was always Harrys’ goal. And it’s not like they could tie a stupid little rock to him.
Draco sat, stiffly. He made a mental note to pull his shoulders back and keep his chin up. He was a Malfoy and he needed to look it, especially here.
Harry wiped sweat off his forehead. Yeah, he hated the heat, but it was far better than being in that house all day. He much preferred sitting in an abandoned swing or riding around on trains all day to the way things were at home. No, the Dursleys was not a home. These days Harry wasn’t sure where ‘home’ could be.
“I would be right in assuming you have no intention of retiring to your rooms for the evening?” Dumbledore asked them.
“Right,” Harry said, drawing the word out to three syllables. “Who is threatening my life this time?” it should bother him to ask such a thing, but he was ashamed to admit it gave him a bit of a thrill.
“I would have loved you harry potter.” Draco finally broke into uncontrollable sobs.
“You're not him,” Ron said after a few more tense moments. “The scar connects you physically but you're nothing like him. You're just feeling what he’s feeling. You can’t control what he's feeling when you see through his eyes” Harry considered this. The logic was sound enough. It didn't make him feel much better though.
chapter seven this is it this is the seventh chapter far from the end were just really getting going now. lots and lots to come. tell me what your thinking friends.
Don’t ask questions.
“I wouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions, Weasel,” Draco said softly not putting near as much energy he usually put into fighting with the ginger boy.
Immediately Harry fell into the defensive. His wand was tucked into his waistband but he didn’t grab it, not yet. He tried to act like nothing was wrong, pulled his shoulders back, and casually brushed the non-existent dirt from his pants before starting to walk across the park.
“-but not faintly harm one another, if I am to kill him.” The Dark Lord walked past Draco and he felt himself stiffen slightly. “I am to do so with another's wand. Come, surely one of you would like the honor?” there was that word again. Honor. The Dark Lord was walking back towards them now. “Hmm? What about you?” Draco almost choked. He was staring straight ahead. Please please not me. He thought desperately. “Lucius?” To Dracos left he could see the Dark Lord’s hand reaching out to his father.
“I’m sorry” she whispered as a single tear fell down her cheek. And then she was being shoved out of the way and his father was surging through the door. Coming at him so fast Draco automatically stumbled backward, unable to maintain his posture or his cool facade, he was sure the fear showed in his face. His father looked ready to kill him. A look Draco had never seen on his father’s face before and as soon as he was close enough, as soon as he had him back against the wall, his father slapped him hard across the face. Another occurrence that had never happened before.
And dammit but his father knew
The scene played out in his head again. As it would on an endless loop forever, or at least in the foreseeable future.
Hi Friends! it seems in my disorganization and lack of sleep I have posted chapters out of order skipping what was supposed to be chapter five, a chapter from Harry's point of view. I am fixing the order now, if you were confused I urge you to please read this chapter and then continue on to reread chapter six which I accidentally posted early I am sorry. I hope this gets seen by anyone and it helps move the story along as I'd intended it.
“Can I borrow an owl?” He asked instead. Ron shrugged.
The sun was going down. The sun was going down and Harry was hot and he didn’t want to go back to the house. But the sun was going down. So he stood, legs and back aching from sitting so still for so long. And he started the long walk back, with his hands shoved inside his pockets and his head down.
“Yeah I found it the night Harry tried to,” he broke off clearing his throat. “The night Harry almost died. I didn’t notice anything wrong with it that night but I wasn't really close enough to it to tell.” Draco wasn't to keen on mentioning the fact that he had spent almost that entire night sobbing into his knees. “But when I found it again, this morning, I saw it closer and could see the broken piece I found, fit perfectly.” Draco was staring at his hands, trying to force them to be still.
His eyes, almost out of habit, glanced to the sky. Nothing here had happened to warrant the dark mark but ever since his fourth year, he’s caught himself looking for it any time a situation feels off.
"I thought we agreed it was a trap,” She said running to walk beside him now.
“If he's dead, I swear I will kill you,” Ron growled again, ever the faithful lap dog.
“Potter open your eyes,” he said, his voice shaking as he grabbed at the wounds on Harry's arms. “Damnit potter opens your eyes,”  he said again. The blood didn't slow, just poured through Draco's fingers. This wasn't going to work. He slid his arms under Harry and scooped him up. He wasn't as heavy as he thought he should have been. Draco nearly slipped trying to get out of the stall. Fuck, Draco thought. Fuck, fuck, “FUCK” he finally screamed. He tore out of the room and into the hallway again. He needed to get potter to the hospital wing. He started to run.
“And he will, but I’m afraid in the case of mister Potter he really does need to return.” Draco was looking at Potter already when Dumbledore said this. He could see Potter shrinking in on himself. He could see his
Without looking he knew where he was. Same place he had fled to the last time he ran away from the headmaster. He turned to face the bare room. immediately he looked to the golden mirror, the sheet pooled on the floor still, from when he ripped it off. Then, from where he stood he noticed it. And how could he not have seen it before? He walked closer, fishing the broken shard of glass from his pocket. The mirror was missing a piece. And he got closer he knew in his bones that the glass in his hand would fit perfectly. He reached his free hand out to feel the edges of the hole, ignoring the blur as the mirror prepared to show him his deepest desire. He traced the empty spot wondering how Harry had broken the mirror. It was said that the mirror couldn't break.  He pulled his hand back the same time the image in the mirror cleared.
His father was a shadow of what Draco always thought he was. His father didn’t look powerful anymore. He looked weak. Slumped over when he thought no one saw him. The way he went about serving the Dark Lord was no different than their house-elves served them. In what world were Malfoys meant to be servants? Not in the world, his father painted for him. Not in the world, Draco wanted to live in. it didn’t make sense to Draco.
“Did, did you hear that?” He asked Harry almost pleadingly. He wasn’t surprised when Harry shook his head. It had been his mother's voice and. She was telling him to run. Why would his mother be telling him to run? Why did it feel like so much more than that? He was moving backward, away from Potter away from the almost concern he held in his eyes. In his damned swollen eyes that made Draco think of too large men and cracking noises and busted lips.
Mrs. Weasly came around the corner, wiping her hands on her apron. “Harry!” She sounded surprised but at least there wasn’t a hint of annoyance he could find anywhere on her. “Well, why didn’t you tell us you were coming dear boy I thought we wouldn’t get to see you until Christmas this year” Harry felt his cheeks color.
Don’t address him unless he speaks to you first.
Summer at the Dursleys was not a vacation. He didn’t understand why he couldn’t just stay at the castle during the wretched two months in between classes. But he was over whining about it. Dumbledore would only spew more bullshit about how it was the safest place for him until he turned 18. That was a load of crap. Harry would dare to say he’d be safer in Voldemort’s grip than spending one more summer with his Aunt and Uncle.
“Do you know what happened?” He asked instead of answering. Harry shook his head.
He was met with a rather familiar pain that could be felt even while asleep. A burning in his head. Like the scar was being carved into his head with a failed spell all over again. He could see blurry images. He couldn’t make out any faces. Just the vague idea of people. He was watching from Voldemort’s eyes. He wanted to recoil away from the images but there was a part of him that embraced it. That reveled in the screams he could hear coming from the cell in front of him. It was a boy, Harry realized, that was screaming at the end of his wand. It served him right for having gone against him. The thoughts were not Harry's own but they felt like they easily could be.
“No!” he exclaimed suddenly moving back a little. She looked offended and Draco quickly tried to cover it up. “No I mean, yes I'll sit down with you, I’ll do whatever I can to save him, just please don't heal anything else,” he said slowly. A good number of the doctors had looked up at his shout and he could feel a blush creeping up his neck.
Open the door but please merlin don’t wake anyone.
His father had always been a picture of power to Draco. He had never had to see this side of things. His father taught him that to serve by the Dark Lord's side was where the Malfoys would always belong. He told Draco bedtime stories about the good days when the Dark Lord was purifying the magical community.
He was gone. He himself was gone from the moment. From that place. From all of space and time it seemed. He couldn’t make out what was happening to him until he reappeared in the middle of a dark neighborhood street beside Dumbledore. Harry loathed apparition. The way he was swept up into nothing, his very being felt like it was being pulled and squished and blended and bent in ways a person should never be. He loathed even more that when it came to Dumbledore he was given no warning. It was just, one moment there and the next gone.
“Well, goodbye then I suppose” Horace mumbled more to himself than to them. Harry followed Dumbledore back out into the street.
He was told his whole wizarding life that you couldn’t just feel magic in the air. That it was just something that existed in him. But everyone was wrong. There was a distinct shift in the air, something almost electric, that tickled the hairs on his arm and the back of his neck.
“Ah, so this is how you’ve decided to persuade me” Horace crossed his arms over his chest, much like a child. In fact, Harry was certain he had seen this exact scowly look on Dudleys face when they were younger and Petunia had thought to try and curb Dudley's diet. “Don’t think I don't know what you're trying to do Albus. The answer is no”
“Just One,” he said, handing Dumbeldore a glass and not handing Harry one. He tried not to look put out.
The corridors were empty as he knew they would be. It was far too early for any student in their right mind to be awake. Which is probably why he enjoyed waking up before the sun. he smirked at the idea of being completely out of his mind and shoved his hands in his pockets, he wasn't sure where to go, there was nowhere he could go. Not until they were able to wake Harry up and get his account of what happened that night.
Dumbeldore merely shrugged beside him, “Then how about a drink my old friend? We’ve come all this way.” Horace seemed to consider this a moment his gaze trailing from Harry to Dumbledore like he was fighting with himself. All at once he slumped and begrudgingly pulled a bottle of firewhiskey from a shelf.
He reached out to touch his shoulder, gently rolling him onto his back, Harry intended to check for breathing and to try to wake him but he stumbled back with a sharp gasp escaping his lips.
“I see,” she said. “Now Draco. I know you were the one who got me here. And I thank you for that. But nobody knows how exactly you found him. I know it might not be something you want to talk about I know the headmaster has told me you don't but I was hoping you wouldn't mind terribly sitting down and talking with me for a just a few minutes.” she said as she pointed her wand towards Dracos black eye.
“You mean where he slit his arms open?” Draco sneered. He was tired of nobody opening there eyes and seeing the situation for what it really was. “Yeah, I opened the door and walked in. why has nobody bothered to clean up the mess?”
It was a single shard of glass. He picked the glass up and examined it closely. The edges were jagged and sharp and sent chills through Draco, thinking about how Harry cut himself open with such a crude weapon. He flipped the glass over and saw it was a broken piece of a mirror. It clearly reflected the bags under Draco's eyes. He looked away and quickly shoved it into his pocket. He turned his attention to the wall of sinks behind him, looking for which mirror harry had shattered to get his weapon, but none of the mirrors were even slightly cracked. So he didn't get the piece from this room then. It dawned on Draco that this must have been planned. He must have held onto the piece of broken mirror for a while before he brought himself to do it. That thought filled Draco with a sense of dread as he slid his hand into his pocket and wrapped it around the shard. He knew he should take it straight to Dumbledore, but the thought of handing it over felt wrong somehow. It felt like throwing harry under the bus, but in reality, it would be throwing himself under the bus, showing up in the headmaster's office with the murder weapon in hand. With that kind of proof, Draco would find himself locked away in Azkaban quicker than he could say ‘I didn't do it’. He needed to show someone though, didn't he? Or maybe he didn't, maybe he could keep this to himself. He didn't know what it would do to the wizarding world if they knew their savior tried to kill himself. Draco shook his head and headed out of the bathroom hand still wrapped around the broken glass deep in his pocket. He felt afraid to let it go for some horrible reason.
“Okay,” She said slowly, trying to find whatever words she was going to say. She looked almost hurt. Harry bit his lip feeling guilt swell in his stomach. “Harry you have to understand how that sounds” He didn’t really. For days he’d been trying to figure it all out. For days he's been completely lost on the subject. “It sounds like a trap Harry” she sounded apologetic he shook his head at the thought.
“Want to tell me about it?” Harry considered this and considered Ron, the crease of concern in his forehead. He only ever told Ron about these things. Sometimes Hermione but she was always looking for the answers, sometimes Harry couldn’t look for answers in everything and that's when he knew he could count on Ron to just listen.
“No,” Draco said flatly. Dumbledore raised an eyebrow. “You were there. You saw what was happening”  his hands were in fists and he was looking Dumbledore in the eye and the old man leaned back ever so slightly like he was shocked and the only thing Draco could think was
A boy a little shorter than himself was leaning against the side of the stall. His raven hair fell in his eyes and a pair of glasses lay abandoned next to him. None of this is what broke Draco down in ways he didn't think possible. No, it was the red. Red poured out of and around the nastiest looking gashes Draco had ever seen on anyone's arms. Draco stood there for way too long.
the two started towards the door again, and Draco watched them. For not the first time in his life, he envied Potter. He envied the loyalty he so easily inspired. He envied the power he had so effortlessly. He envied most of all the perfect life he had, and he hated him. Who in their right mind would throw away such a life as Harry Potter’s? He was mister perfect, he could get away with whatever he wanted. He was practically worshiped, who wouldn't want all of that? He was bloody rich. More than that, more than any of it, he was loved. Actually properly loved, by so many people. Draco couldn't say he knew what that felt like. What it felt like to even have one person care for him as deeply as the mudblood and the lapdog cared for Harry.
“He goes out a lot, for meetings that he tells nobody of, in a location that is kept secret. He works closely with Umbridge and used to work under Lucious.” Mr. Weasly was still talking, but Harry was in his dream again. Lucious. Of course, it was Lucious, the one who told Voldemort to stop, the one who was sitting across from him at the table. He was begging, in the last dream, Lucious was begging Voldemort to reconsider, begging him to change his mind. It was Lucious he was seeing.
It was hard to tell what emotions were playing on the lines around Potter’s eyes but he could tell when they hardened. When he turned away from Draco. When he decided not to answer. It wasn’t surprising by any means. Draco swallowed down whatever retort he had been trying to come up with and slumped farther into his own seat secretly hoping he could get enough blood on the thing that even a cleaning charm couldn’t save it.
“Ah” The man called Horace sighed as if considering the things he overlooked.
It was like adrenaline or something.
Missing a few, Harry corrected his thoughts as he discarded the now-useless towel on the floor in favor for a clean one.
Part of Harry wanted the wound to automatically heal itself before his eyes. Then Malfoy would wake up and apparate away and Harry could be left with the consequences of trying to have him in peace. But not even madam Pomfrey's potions could work that fast.
What had that been? He knew it wasn’t him. He hadn’t done any form of accidental magic since the summer before his third year. No matter how upset he got or how hurt he was he hadn’t wanted to risk expulsion. So he knew it wasn’t coming from him.
Draco was ordered to stay in his common room. He sat on his bed and stared at the curtains that were pulled closed around him. Today's breakfast tray laid untouched at his feet. It was bad enough being sent to his room like a petulant child, it was another for them to have taken away his wand. ‘Probation’ they called it. A fancy word for saying the headmaster didn't trust him, but what else is new? He wasn't allowed to go to classes, he couldn’t roam the corridors, hell he wasn't even allowed to send any letters. As if he had anyone to send letters to anyways. He couldn't sit still anymore. He couldn't look at the green curtains anymore. They reminded him too much of the boy he let die. Angered he ripped the silky curtains open and in a way that only a Malfoy could, he stalked out of the room.
“Ah yes.  Lily lovely Lily” Horace said in a way that made Harry want to steal away the photo and keep it for himself. She was young and smiling, it was the first time he had seen a picture of her this young. “She was one of mine, your mother,” Harry bristled “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. so full of life she was beautiful too, you know. Charming girl, I used to tell her she ought to have been a Slytherin. Bus she wouldn't hear of it. had quite the smart mouth.” Harry set the frame down and turned to look at Horace more closely.
Draco's eyes flicked to the empty seat at the table. The seat directly to the right of the Dark Lord, who was talking about something or another. It was dangerous for Draco not to know what was being talked about, but he usually never had to say more than ‘yes, my Lord’ or ‘no, my Lord’.
“I started it. I picked a fight with him,” he said quickly not wanting to get anyone in trouble. Not today at least.  He'd find a way to get back at the redhead some other time.
“What about me?” Potter asked, and Draco was baffled by the confusion in the other boy's voice. Dumbledore said nothing.
A different door. A different man. A burn on his lip. Darkness and a curse. He was still looking at Harry. At a boy afraid.  He didn't know why, or how, but he understood at least the surface of what he was feeling.
He was about to open his mouth, to say there obviously wasn't anyone here and they should go back.
For no reason at all harry decided to go with a 45% chance that his aunt and uncle were asleep. He hated to go with 50/50 odds. It felt like cheating somehow.
He missed flying, no matter how hot it was, feeling the wind in his face created only by how fast he could cut through the air was exhilarating. It was something he was good at, really and truly good at. Something that wasn’t tied to Voldemort, or his scar, or his bloody destiny. Something that wasn’t orchestrated for him. Something that was just him.
Here's the thing guys timeline-wise I have backed myself into a corner somewhat. the story is on track but I can't not keep up the alternating povs and the Harry chapters would be entirely too long if I just keep going. so while I have material planned for unconscious Draco as you will read here in a moment there's not very much of it. this is the shortest chapter I have ever posted in I think any of my stories if I'm remembering right and I promise it will be the shortest chapter in this story from now on and the parts that follow since this will be a two or three-part series in future. chapter thirteen I am hoping will make up for the lack of content and should be up within the next day or two at the most.
“My mother’s eyes. Yeah,” He said he was getting tired of hearing that. If it wasn’t the scar and the story that went with it. It was the eyes like his mother's. He picked up a frame positioned at the front. His mother. He felt guilty for resenting this that they had in common, but he was desperate for someone to recognize him for something that was just him.
Time inched by unbearably slowly.
He was seeing other things now too.
“I'm fine” He found himself saying, his mouth moving without his permission. Dumbledore and Potter stared at him like they had forgotten he was even here. Even to Draco, his voice sounded weak. It reminded him of the way his father sounded when he spoke to the Dark Lord.
“Except for the eyes, you've got-”
“Ron wouldn’t let us wake you,” She said quietly, watching Ron sleep. She bumped her shoulder against his softly “Are you alright?”
It was the middle of the night when he woke up to Malfoy’s gasps. It was only moments later that he found himself wherever the hell ‘here’ was.
Harry felt sick and he didn't know if it was due to the suddenness of the new place, or the fact that he was here at all, here when he should be in the hospital wing. Shouldn’t he be? For a moment Harry didn’t know anything at all about where he should be.
Draco wasn't ready for these tests the Dark Lord was giving him.
What was a few broken bones anyway to the boy who just kept on living?
“We deserve to know what this rat did to Harry.” Ron raged. Draco looked over to see The mudblood physically holding Ron's arms back to keep the weasel from pouncing on him again.
If anyone were to attempt a guess at how Harry spent his summers, it wouldn’t be his best friends. It wouldn’t be his professors, or Lupin, or even Dumbledore. It would be Madam Pumfrey. He visited her on his first night back to Hogwarts every year since his second. And last year she sent him a few potions, one for infection, one for internal bleeding, one for pain, one for sleep, and one to help ease natural healing. Harry took the whole sack to Malfoy’s side.
“I hesitated and I wish I hadn't. Believed me I wish I hadn't waited a single moment. I picked him up and ran. I knew I had to save him because he was supposed to save us all. Nobody else was in the bathroom when I got there and nobody else was there when we left. I didn't cast any spells I didn't even know there was a spell to keep people out until Dumbledore told me a few hours ago. And I know that by my entering this morning it made it look like I was the one who cast the spell but I swear I didn't.”
He glanced at Hedwig, his beautiful perfect Snowy owl trapped in her cage. A thick padlock hung off the door and the sight twisted in Harry. He knew what it was to be trapped. He wished he could let her out. But he couldn’t. So what was his next option? Ms. Figg. who Harry had found out last year had direct contact with Dumbledore.
“Mister Malfoy, we’re giving you a chance to come out on your own and accept your arrest. If you don't, we'll force ourselves in and the outcome won't be pleasant.” Draco whispered the spell again, wand pointed to his other wrist.
“Do you want lunch?” Ron asked, clapping his hands together and standing up. Lunch? Had Harry been allowed to sleep that long? And if that much time had passed what was happening to Draco now. Had he woken up to find Harry gone? Would he care? His stomach hurt thinking about it. He shook his head.
“Sorry to bother you Sir, but I am unable to use magic and when I found Malfoy I couldn’t have saved him without getting expelled.” Found him. Draco thought tiredly. Just how had Potter found him? Where was he that he needed to be found by Potter in the first place? What was going on? And why were they still sitting here in Dumbledore's office instead of in the Hospital Wing where Harry could be being healed.
“I didn't kill him,” Draco whispered as Ron brushed past him. He met his eyes for a brief moment.
Tw blood and injuries!!!!
So this one is quite a bit longer than previous chapters. what do you prefer? the longer or shorter chapters? let me know!
Then the Dark Lord entered the room. Draco wasn’t sure what happened but the room went dark and cold.
He walked quickly out of the neighborhood. He skipped the park for now and kept walking. His glasses were cracked and bent but it was only a mild inconvenience. He was a bit surprised he’d made it this far into the summer before they were broken. He knew Hermione would fix them for him as soon as they were on the train.
He realized quickly that what he’s seen a glimpse of actually was hair. The crackle of magic was back in the air, if only very faintly.
“You know I knew you were a git. Everyone knows you’re a git and you have your strange rivalry with Potter but you’re not a killer. I know that better than anyone. And you know better than anyone that I haven't spoken to my death eater parents in 4 years. So once you realize that you have all of one friend in this god forsaken hell hole I’ll be there waiting for you to come to your bloody senses.” Zabini stood there waiting for him to say something, probably waiting for him to apologize. The lump was back in Draco's throat and he feared that the second he opened his mouth to say anything then that would be it and he'd start to cry again and Malfoys didn't cry. Instead, he just rolled over to face away from his friend who he could hear cursing under his breath as he walked out of the room.
Draco Malfoy was unconscious in his bed. Before he could really let that thought sink in, he heard movement throughout the house. Harry half jumped, half crawled across the small room closing his door as quietly as he could and twisting the lock. An act that was always forbidden when his uncle was home. He'd rather risk him finding a locked door than a boy in his bed. A bleeding boy in his bed. A bleeding wizard boy in his bed. Merlin, but he would be dead if Vernon found out about this. And not in the way kids claim their parents would kill them. Harry would be really and truly dead. Buried under Petunia’s roses or thrown to the bottom of the lake in the middle of the night never to be seen again kind of dead. This would only ever end badly, Harry knew that. But he was determined to avoid that particular future.
This puts him back with Voldamort.
There was a sound, so low, almost nonexistent and if it hadn't been for the massive amount of attention Draco was paying to the noises surrounding him he probably wouldn't have noticed. It wasn't obvious and for a moment he thought he made it up. He stood upright and listened. It took a few moments, few moments that he later regretted hesitating on. But soon he heard what had made him pause. It sounded like someone was breathing. But it was so light. Draco turned around to face the room. Who dared to interrupt in his moment of weakness? Nobody could be seen, only stall doors and shadows. But still, a shallow breathing could be heard.
“That was all he said? Are you sure?” Madam Pomfrey interrupted, Draco glanced up at her and noticed her brow furrowed. Draco nodded.
A boy who was Draco Malfoy was bleeding in his bed, and there was little Harry could do about it being underage just barely, but regardless enough to keep him from being able to use magic. There was supposed to be an allowance for life or death situations as was this one, but after last year's trial attempting to expel him for protecting himself, he knew the ministry was watching him particularly closely and he would not be allowed any such allowances.
His thirty seconds were over. As if on a timer his hands stopped shaking and Harry pulled himself up Aching limbs and all. First, he needed to make sure the bleeding had stopped. Really he should have done that in the first place. Then he needed to find help.
“Yes please have a seat, Severus.” Dumbledore extended his arm to the empty chair next to Draco.
“Malfoy'' He didn't want to hear it. He didn't want to listen. He wanted to cover his ears like a child and curl up on his good side and sleep and forget and forget it all. Forget the way his mother looked at him in the doorway of his room. Forget the way Harry's uncle looked at Harry. He wanted to forget stinging cheeks and cracking bones. He wanted to forget slithering calm voices and dismissive hands.
The atmosphere in the great hall was suffocating. Nothing on the surface appeared out of place, it was only a sickening uneasy feeling that snaked through Draco's entire being. He couldn't place it, he couldn't figure out what made the air so thick. It was too much. Draco stood and fled the Hall, ignoring the questioning looks of his friends. Ignoring the stares of those who were not his friends. Ignoring the empty seat at the table across the hall. Ignoring all of this, because something somewhere was not right.
“Malfoy!” the angered voice called. Draco turned away from the mirror stunned, he didn't want to see more and instead decided to face the angry redhead who was now practically charging him. Draco didn't fight back as Ron attacked him, knocking him to the floor and for the second time in a week he proceeded to punch and kick any part of Draco he could reach. Draco took it until Ron had finally tired himself out.
“Was it bad this summer?” Ron only asked him when they were alone but he made sure to ask it at the end of every summer. They weren't allowed to communicate, for fear of letters being tracked and Harry's supposed safe location becoming known to the wrong sort. Ron didn’t know the extent of things. He didn't know about what his Uncle would do to him. Didn't know about the cupboard Harry was still forced into from time to time. But he knew about the bars on the window and that was enough for Ron to worry.
Sure he hated the boy. He was so smug all the time and he wasn’t even a pureblood. There was nothing about Harry Potter that should have him walking around like he was the epitome of all things good. Potter didn’t know what ‘good’ meant.
“I think-” He started to say only his tongue knotted up before he could continue and it came out sounding as though he were drunk. He stood there a moment longer before the entire corridor twisted on an angle tipping everything upside down. “Potter '' He tried to say, he wasn’t sure if he was successful, only that after the attempt he felt arms around him. Catching him. And then the world went dark and cold.
He knew that waiting inside would be a warm meal and hugs and his best friend whom Harry had taken to referring to as his brother. Hermione might even be inside as well. His other best friend. He couldn't bring himself to go inside yet. He sank instead to the front step. The lights were off of course. He had no idea what time it had been when he woke to Draco falling on the floor. Even less how much time he had spent staring at the carpet in Horace’s living room, though Harry came to suspect it wasn’t actually Horace’s place, to begin with. The Weasly’s would no doubt be asleep and while they wouldn’t mind waking up for him he wasn’t about to make them. He wasn’t ready to be around anyone anyways.
“I was in his head but it was different. It wasn’t clear like it usually is.” His voice sounded shaky and he tried to swallow the nerves. “It was more intense too, I was more” He hesitated only a fraction of a moment before forcing himself to continue “More connected somehow. He was hurting someone, I couldn't see who. But it wasn’t just that. I was doing it too. I
An honor. His father said. A great honor.
“Ah, Harry we really must be going” Harry was relieved as Dumbledore reappeared. He needed to get back.
“Enough. Let's move this conversation to my office.”
“Right then. Some privacy, would you like some tea?” she asked holding out a cup already full of steaming liquid. He took it, and took a seat in one of the armchairs, setting his tea down beside him. Her office was much different than the other teachers here. For one there wasn't a desk in between her and whomever she needed to speak with, instead, there was just a circle of about half a dozen mixed matched arm chairs all facing each other. She took a seat in the one closest to Draco and turned it a bit to face him better. She tried handing him a biscuit but he turned it down, focused more on what he was about to say.
He pushed his glasses back up onto his nose, peering through the one good side. He was still walking but he wasn’t sure where. He didn’t care where It didn’t matter where. The brief thought about Hermione was already making his hands shake in something akin to anticipation. And sorrow. His friends, even if they tried to write, the letters would never reach him.
He had to figure a way to save Malfoy though. Why exactly he even wanted to save the boy he couldn't comprehend. Malfoy made it his personal mission, it seemed, to make Harry's life acutely miserable at school. Not that Malfoy much exceeded in that. Malfoy had nothing on the Dursleys.
“We need to know what that death eater did to Harry.” Ron spat viciously.
“Are you done now?” he asked, hating the way his voice came out choked. The redhead said nothing and Draco took it to mean yes. Draco pushed past Weasley and started out the door.
“I haven’t heard him around yet but feel free to go on up and wake him, no need in him wasting the day lazing about” Harry didn’t point up that the sun only just started to rise a moment ago and it could hardly be considered wasting the day to be asleep at such an early hour. He thanked her and walked up the stairs to Ron's room. He knew the way well. He spent as much time here as he could get away with since second year when Ron and the twins saved him from being trapped behind barred windows.
ATTENTION: if this feels familure it is because I messed up and posted my chapters out of order, previously this was posted as chapter five when it was supposed to be chapter Six, if you have come back to read because you've been notified of an update please go back a chapter and read the real chapter five, it will probably make this chapter make better sense. Thank you and I'm sorry.
“Where are you going?” He asked. It wasn’t his voice, it couldn’t be. But it was. It was distorted like it was folding in on itself and he could hear it ricocheting off the walls. It wasn't his but it was. He laughed again as the boy tried to get away.
Carefully, with his head still tilted towards the floor, He glanced at Potter.
“No, you don't know. You don't know and I don't know and none of this makes any fucking sense.” Draco was screaming. “I don't know what happened.” That wasn't quite true though, was it? He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harry Potter had slit his own wrists. What he couldn't understand, was why. “I don't know why this happened,” Draco said only slightly quieter than his previous screaming. He couldn't look up from the desk to see the pity in Dumbledore's eyes. He just couldn't. He didn't need to be pitied. He didn't want it. Without another word, he stalked out of the office. Paying no attention to the headmaster calling his name behind him.
“Now why wouldn’t I?” she asked clearly frustrated.
“Mione and Ginny are getting our books,” Ron said around a mouthful of food.
Trigger Warnings for abusive guardians!!
“Mister Malfoy I understand how you must be feeling,”
The closer he came to the Burrow the more he felt like breaking. He felt lost. Used and discarded as he was time and time again it seemed. Was there anything he could do to get back before the train? How long was there even before the train? He usually knew. A countdown to the hour living in the back of his mind all through the summers. But he had forgotten by now. This must have been planned. Dumbledore didn’t want him underfoot. He served his purpose and while normally, being here would be a relief. He couldn’t shake the worry that clung to him. The way Draco said his name in his sleep. The way it was Draco now. He didn’t know when it changed for him but there was no arguing that it had.
“Oh I’m sure we’ll find a use for you” They stopped walking in front of a house with the front door hanging on only one of its hinges. Harry couldn’t be sure if the chill he felt against his skin was due to the sight of the house, or the way Dumbledore said the words. He chose not to respond. But that didn’t hold back the unease he felt. I'm sure we'll find a use for you. Because that's his role is it not? To be used. Harry kicked a rock at his feet. Watching it skitter a few feet on the cement walkway. Dumbledore glanced at it, Harry didn't know if it was amusement or disapproval that flashed in his eyes.
It wasn't long before sleep enveloped him, filling his head with nightmarish memories he'd rather forget.
“Yes yes,” Dumbledore said and Draco looked in time to see Dumbledore hold up a dismissive hand. Anger began to build in Draco but he looked back down. He was hurt, that was true when first he woke he could feel it in his side. The tear that stretched, pulling at his skin from his lowest rib and wrapped around to the bottom of his back. He could feel it burn under the fabric of his shirt. It was a feverish burn, but for now, at least it was dulling, the adrenaline probably hiding the pain from him. It was still bleeding, hidden under a borrowed cloak, but the bleeding was slow. He didn't know why he was hiding it exactly. Just that for some reason he felt he needed to be here in this office hearing what was being said. Was it a mission? Perhaps something the Dark Lord set him to do. That idea didn’t sit well with Draco making him squirm slightly in his seat, wincing at the pull in his skin.
“Morning Mister Weasley,” He said standing and grinning falsely.
Harry found himself standing at the base of the Dursley’s driveway. Malfoy had grown completely limp, and his arms were beginning to burn. He wasn’t sure why it surprised him to be standing here. There was nowhere else he could go. No, where he could take Malfoy but right here. It was still early. The moon could still be seen in the soft morning light. Hopefully, this would mean his aunt would still be asleep. She was always the hardest to predict of the Dursleys.
He wasn’t sure what he expected, but it certainly wasn’t this. He was expected to kill. On some level, Draco always knew that was a possibility in his future. But not one he’d have to face so soon.
This meeting had little to do with him, most things the Dark Lord said had little to do with him beyond assigning the mission. But here he was, sitting to the right of his father. A position that showed he was ready to follow in his father's footsteps. A position Draco took up of his own free will a little over a month ago. A position that Draco now loathed.
“I don't know” he screamed, whirling around to glare at Dumbledore. “Okay? I don’t bloody know!” The Headmaster looked at him with pity radiating off of him and it filled the air, reacting badly with Draco's thick hatred and overwhelming anger. He took a few steps forward until he was leaning across the desk. “Don't. you.  dare. fucking.  pity.  me. Old. Man.” he said emphasizing each and every word through gritted teeth.
Open the door.
He was a Malfoy. He was a Slytherin, He was a Deatheater if the dark mark on his arm was any indication, not that he could clearly remember how he’d gotten it. He should be taking notes, should be getting ready to return to the manor with everything he’s learned. He should be taking Potter with him, turning him in. He was wounded and weak and it would end the war before it could fully start. This, what he was doing now, went against everything he had been taught to do and say and believe. There were expectations he had to upkeep. There were rules. Harry Potter was the enemy. But he didn’t stop. He didn’t slow. He didn’t let go.
“Is Ron up?” He asked, he felt a bit rude by doing so but if anything was going to make him feel better it would be him.
“Potters dead. Go write to your death eater parents and start celebrating the news.” Draco laid back in his bed, fully clothed on top of the covers.
“They're here for you,” she whispered as soon as she was close enough to be heard.
Light broke in the sky ahead of him and Harry stopped walking. He was already sweaty again. He wasn’t sure how long that means he’s been walking but the sun was finally coming up. Peeking over the buildings ahead. The darkness receding against the burst of warm colors. Harry liked watching the sunrise. It looked different almost every morning from almost every place.
He sat up, heart hammering against his ribs trying to grasp onto the images he had seen the last image. The man pleading for the boy being tortured. Some idea to know who it was. He could tell someone about it. But the images were fading fast, leaving him with nothing but a sick feeling in his stomach.
When he caught up Dumbledore continued talking as if there hadn’t been a pause, “I need to convince an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and fill our missing spot on the staff list” Right. The defense against the dark arts position.  The one that never could stay filled.
Draco’s touch traced taunting down his chest, stroking over his abs, dragging through smears of honey and lower, following a narrow trail of hair to rub into the dark mess of Harry’s curls and circle at the base of his cock, squeezing tightly.
A stately eagle owl woke Harry one Saturday morning in mid-January with a series of abruptly loud pecks to his bedroom window.
He held out for as long as he could—really only a few minutes—before Draco was pumping his orgasm out of him in faster strokes, while Harry panted and gripped at Draco’s arse through his trousers.
“That would be brilliant,” Harry admitted with some obvious relief. “But really, any help you’re willing to offer would be. Thanks Cassie.”
“Rough sleepers,” Savage said quietly at his shoulder, shaking his head sadly.
Harry’s back garden butted up against several of his neighbours’ gardens, separated by a few overgrown lanes, barely wide enough for a single person to walk through. The garden itself was quite small, surrounded by a patchwork of odd fencing and lattice choices—with some areas over-fenced, and others with no fences at all. Harry hadn’t really understood what the previous owners were trying to accomplish, but it was one of many messes he hadn’t got around to sorting out yet.
It had two levels, smaller than the library at Hogwarts, but perhaps not by all that much. Harry took it all in with a genuine interest, though of course his first thought was of Hermione, and how she likely would have enjoyed perusing such an old library.
“I’ll message you on the board Tuesday night to work out a plan. Let me know once you’re certain you’ve got the time off,” he instructed tersely.
He must’ve known it would make Harry blush, and it did.
In the end they barely got out of bed all day. Every time Harry might’ve had the chance to reflect on how wrong it was that he was fucking Draco for hours in the bed he shared with Ginny—well, he didn’t have the blood flow to reflect on anything but how good Draco felt all around his cock, which was really incredibly good.
Harry sighed exasperation, shutting down the strange twist catching in his chest that they might have an eventually anything.
“You don’t have…other plans?” Draco was surely leaving the ‘with Ginevra’ bit unsaid on purpose.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered again sleepily. “Did you want to—? Er.”
A pale brow furrowed faintly. “But you’re not boring, and you’ve never been. You’re a risk taker. You’ll walk right up to the precipice and jump, and never question why you’re jumping until you’re falling through the air.”
With a lower cry, Harry pushed into each tightening convulsion inside him and Draco rode him relentlessly, soft hands sliding splayed over his chest in appreciative strokes, spreading the mess he’d made, until Harry jolted beneath him, hotly slicking him inside.
“Ah. The goat man, is it? That explains the smell of this place. Do you carry absinthe?”
Harry sent back a small Portkey, one from a pair of tarnished cufflinks he’d found in the back of his attic. He had to look up how to link the spell to a matching object, one Harry could keep on him whilst running all about London, and he thought it ought to work quite well.
“Tea?”
“…You could come if you like.”
“Let’s keep this little excursion to ourselves, shall we?”
Harry heard something in Draco’s voice break. He tried to pull off again, but Harry thrust up with all the force he could manage without any leverage.
“You’re looking a bit pallid, Potter. Are you sure you’re up for this?” Draco’s tone was deceptively disinterested.
“Fuck, that feels good,” he breathed in a pleasure-shock, his cock swelling with an undeniable throb of interest as Draco taunted at sensitive places, nudging up on his taint and teasing over his balls with a dangerously good pressure.
Harry snorted at the notion he would ever intentionally flatter a Malfoy, but his amusement faded as memories, too many and too dark, assailed his thoughts and quickened his pulse, until he managed to reign them in. Given the obvious consequences, he might’ve withdrawn from this line of thinking – but stubbornly his whiskey-soaked mind and terrible judgement would insist otherwise.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Isn’t there always time for snogging?”
He’d stayed in for at least an hour more, willing himself not to think of Draco, how he felt all around him, or any of the other vexingly persistent little details which might make it harder for him to get some much-needed sleep.
“Fuck’s sake,” he bemoaned tiredly.
Draco woke suddenly, with a too-loud gasp, and when the fearful grey of his eyes met Harry’s, Harry saw a kind of panic in them he hadn’t seen there in a few years.
Draco curled his arms tight around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him down as close as he could. Harry fucked him so hard then that he came before he was ready to, but Draco pressed up, driving the spilling tip of Harry’s cock right where he needed to push into a climax so intense it left Draco faintly trembling under him.
Once they had properly showered, they dressed relatively quickly, then parted ways. Draco went off to the library to look into window and curtain modifications, and Harry stayed behind in the ballroom, getting on with as many extensions as he could in the meanwhile.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Get your head out of your cock, Potter.”
“What?” Harry repeated, pushing up to actually look at him then.
Ginny nodded, kissed Harry’s cheek, and headed over to chat with Seamus and Dean. They were seated at the old table with an impressive line-up of empty shot glasses.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“No problem,” Harry assured. He stopped himself short of saying thank you, and went back to his scone.
The room was keyed to only accept magic from Aurors—Draco wouldn’t be able to get back out without him, but Harry didn’t think that would be a problem.
“I didn’t do it on
Really, Draco was irresistible when he was all wet. Squished so close together as they were, Harry couldn’t seem to keep himself from touching every bit of soaked skin he could get his hands on.
Harry had ordered a pot of tea, and it was steeping soothingly on the table between them. There were biscuits as well, and a few small sandwiches, of which Harry had already had two. He’d worked up quite an appetite running about all morning.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
,” Draco whispered, and their tangled fingers grew slick and slippery. He trailed a path of sharp bites along Harry’s jaw to his ear before he elaborated any further. “We’ll be doing things the long way this time. No spells…except for that one.”
Harry found him leaning leisurely against a tree, eerily reminiscent of a time right at the catalyst to the war, that summer at the Quidditch World Cup. They had been so young then, not knowing what was just on the horizon.
Draco let slip a low, smug laugh. “That happens occasionally.”
“She’s right, Mate. I don’t know why the bloody hell you thought Malfoy was a good substitute.”
“Have you got a card or something? Only I haven’t really got the time to talk just now, but—”
,” Draco expelled, riding him faster, working off a residual pleasure-shock before his hips worked down on Harry’s cock, pressing and holding him deeper again. Harry could feel the tremors of pleasure inside when Draco found the right spot.
The last couple days of Harry’s week were quite dull and uneventful—excepting the single Field Training mission he’d gone on that wasn’t about chasing off Dementors.
Before they left the tent behind, Draco verified the bathroom, kitchen, and the sitting room were all as clean as the bedroom, as if they’d never been there at all, and they headed out together to finally get on with casting the extensions again.
Sounding rather dryly amused, Draco jumped immediately on the break in conversation for an opportunity to leave, rising to offer his hand just as he had the last time.
“I killed your cult leader,” Harry blurted. “They gave me a pass on Astronomy.”
But Harry was already storming out of the atrium.
Harry watched him swirl off through the fire with his own small frown. All sorts of emotions were roiling in him—worry and nerves, guilt and desire, a healthy dash of denial, and a true exhilaration that they were closer than ever to tangible progress.
“That’s not how you’re meant to consume these.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco picked up right where he’d left off.
“I won’t be long,” he promised, and hurried up the creaky wooden staircase, trying to ignore the nervous thrum beating in his chest, and the somewhat nauseating level of guilt he felt just then.
Harry groaned, thrusting up all the harder as Draco’s cursing intensified. The throbbing hold on his cock squeezed tighter as he found Draco’s sweet spot again, and again, and they each flew closer to the edge of relief.
The weekend before, Hermione had Floo-called to plan a night to catch up—and they had both discovered they worked nearly opposing schedules these days. Combining in the need to include Ron, who was at the shop more nights and weekends than not—it became clear fairly soon that it might be a while until they could find a time to meet when they were all free.
“Yeah, better,” Harry agreed.
“Potter.” Draco was apparently quite serious.
“Put some clothes on, Potter, or you’ll never get out of here.”
But then again Harry had also been there with him that night in the tower, when Draco couldn’t do what they were asking of him, even when it meant defying, as Draco had put it, one of the most powerful wizards in living memory. Even when it meant disobeying his own family.
The contended cadence of Draco’s hum was answer enough.
An arched eyebrow seemed to be asking if he would be getting to the point any time soon. He took a deep breath.
Even then, surely, that had to be a good sign.
Through somewhat fuzzy vision, Harry looked across the bedroom to a wooden-framed window, through which he could see the back end of a neighbouring tent and, more fuzzily, a bit of the ballroom’s mirrored wall reflecting the entire spiral.
“That’ll be enough. It’s an outlandishly expensive bottle.”
“I suppose I ought to join you, or you’re likely to choose somewhere completely unsuitable.”
“I’ll be down in just a bit to start on tea, yeah? You erm, probably have time for a bath, if you want.”
Draco blinked in slight surprise before he seemed to recover.
That one night was behind them now, and Harry didn’t see why their meetings and letters couldn’t stay strictly professional.
“Right then, essentially, private use of Undetectable Extension Charms is strictly prohibited by the Ministry—specifically because of the Secrecy Statutes, you know. Production of those few objects that do use Extension Charms is very tightly controlled by Misuse of Muggle Artifacts and the Improper Use of Magic office.”
Standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder, they both took in the few shelves of prophecies before them, only a small half-circle now, and far shorter than they had once been. Harry didn’t bother to scan the shelves, or read the labels—in the back of his mind, he knew whatever he might’ve been looking for was no longer there.
Draco huffed breathlessly. “Go without me, or we’ll be in here all day.”
He opened his eyes at least, though he couldn’t recall closing them, and met directly with his own hazy green, his extremely heated cheeks, and a crooked tilt to the glasses he’d never bothered to remove. He heard Draco’s quiet chuckle as he moved back, offering a hand to help him stand upright.
“Roll over, and spread your legs. I want to watch you come.”
“Er. The spells. What’s left to do?”
“And?” Draco drawled.
“What’s the matter? Have I broken your heart after you’ve called me a whore? Fuck off.”
When he bit harder, just above the line of his pants, Draco moaned, his hips twitching forward impatiently. Harry tugged his pants down below his arse and helped to pull the stiff length of Draco’s cock free from them.
He had been back in the cave with Dumbledore, while he sobbed for Harry to make the hurt stop, and when he woke his cheeks were wet. It took him another four hours to get back to sleep, and he only eventually managed it when he went down to stretch out by the fire, on the settee in his sitting room.
“Potter?”
Harry couldn’t help noting it was sort of nice that when Draco was soft like this, he could fit nearly all of him into his mouth at once, without choking.
He didn’t find Draco in the library.
“…We didn’t quite make the attic,” Draco pointed out in amusement, a flush still high on his cheeks.
“The government and the councils are leaning into supporting a lot of local and private organisations to do the actual work—but there’ve been a lot of miscommunications between them and some of the already established churches and charities—it’s not exactly efficient. A lot of them, as well as the hostels and such meant to provide accommodation, they weren’t always collecting or reporting their numbers accurately. St. Mungo’s have been trying to tackle the mental health aspect with a bit of success, but of course all those places are only ever temporary, and with quite a lot of conditions on who can stay, and for how long.”
“Should we do all the Extensions at your place?”
“Your mum still talks to Andromeda?”
She smiled wryly. “So I’ve heard. Tessie shows me more than just the gossip columns.”
“I said
All day he tried to shut out a persistent twinge of concern that he had done something wrong. Obviously, the
When he woke some time later, it was to find that Draco had not been so lucky—his narrow fingers clutched tensely tight to Harry’s shirt. When he shifted a bit uncertainly, Draco let out a quiet, familiarly-frightened whimper.
Harry stared speechlessly.
“Then you didn’t actually do much shopping at all, did you?”
Tracing his fingertips up the outline of Draco’s cock, Harry discovered he was already stiff and pressed to the front of his trousers. When he chanced a look, Draco’s head had tipped back, his eyes fallen closed.
have a lovely day
Trigger Warning for abusive guardians.
The entire room fell silent as Draco sank again to his knees. Dumbledore stood looking down at Draco, who was covered in blood.
“We can't, as far as I know, it's not possible. I suppose if we knew what he saw we might have a better chance understanding at least but again.”
“Oi! Malfoy!” he heard someone calling behind him and recognized the weasel right away. He turned down the first corridor he could find and picked up a sprint trying to lose the redhead. The last thing he needed today was to deal with potters bloody followers. He could hear footsteps running far behind him but knew he’d catch up eventually, Draco made a few more turns and ducked into the first door he could find pushing it quietly closed.
Harry raised his wand. Not his wand. Not his hand. Harry raised his wand and whispered the curse again. The boy screamed and screamed and screamed until the sound of it mixed with Harry's laugh and he couldn’t tell the sounds apart. He couldn’t tell himself apart. Was he himself was he something else something worse. The laughing and the screams filled his ears.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was alive. There was blood. Merlin, but there was blood trailing from and clinging to him. Matted in the hair that looked too familiar to Harry. Three was blood, and his body was facing away from him. He couldn’t see any signs of breathing. He wasn’t sure what to do if the boy was dead. Did he leave him? No. No child Should see something like that. No boy should be left this way. Abandoned and bloody. Anyway, Harry had heard him cough, hadn’t he?  Harry was equally unsure of what to do if the boy was alive. He wasn’t a healer. But either way, Harry had to do
“It seems young Malfoy is able to get into the lavatory where Harry was attacked,” Dumbledore said evenly. “I was hoping you could tell me how that's possible since he had no wand on him.”
“Not quite. I was just wondering if I could borrow your washroom” Harry sagged. Horace pointed to where it was and it was just the two of them. He didn’t like being so close to Horace, he didn’t know the man, so he wandered around the living room, looking at spines of books and odd trinkets.
“Enough Mister Weasley, I will send for you both soon,” Dumbledore said.
Draco didn't wait to watch them fall. He could feel everyone holding their breath for a brief moment before the room flew into chaos, everyone more intent on helping the Aurors then on Draco. And that's exactly what he needed. He slipped through the curtains separating him from Harry almost without anyone seeing. Anyone but Hermione who met his eyes just before he pulled the curtains tightly closed and spelled them locked. He didn't want to turn around. He didn't want to see Harry the way he was now but he needed to. He exhaled slowly turning on his heel and almost immediately his heart dropped to the floor. Draco was sure he could hear it shattering like his mother's crystal vase he had knocked over when he was seven.
Until he did. All at once. Stopping in his tracks and breathing heavy. The edges of his vision pulsed in and out of focus. His ears were ringing so loud that even as he watched Harry's lips moving, he couldn’t hear the words being said. He took a step backward and the pain came back to him all at once. His side was on fire, he doubled over wrapping his arms around himself and when he looked up again, he wasn’t in the corridor. He was in a room he only remembered seeing once. He was behind bars and his mother was looking at him with an intensity he had never before seen in her. She was disheveled and tear-stained and she was whispering something to him. Something he knew she shouldn’t be saying. He wanted to reach out and touch her but as soon as the vision of her had come it was gone and he was looking at Potter again.
He kept his eyes down out of habit, watching the floor while Dumbledore whispered to the portraits on the wall. The headmaster was pacing, hands behind his back, ignoring them. Ignoring them both. To his left sat Harry Potter. The same Harry Potter that he’d just watched get thrown down a flight of steps. The same Harry Potter that managed to become a seeker in first year. The same Harry Potter who sat silently, bleeding and swollen. The same Harry Potter that Draco memorized all those years ago in Madam Malkin's. The very same too skinny boy. Harry Potter who was all but broken sitting in the oversized armchair, barely recognizable to even him. Draco shuddered. Thinking about what he’d seen felt wrong. Like he had trespassed, stumbled onto something no one was meant to see, but that didn’t make it something that should be ignored either.
“We should get you to the Hospital Wing.” He was saying but Draco couldn’t breathe.
“Okay,” she said thinking over what he just told her.
“Draco. I shouldn’t be here” She started. Her voice broke in a way Draco had never heard from her before. “And neither should you.” Draco couldn’t understand what she was trying to say but he could see the conflict in her eyes. Something was wrong.
“Where are we?” Harry asked, still disoriented.
Harry turned trying to find what caught his eye.
Chapter Eight! i'll be honest usualy i pants my way through everything I write which is one of two reasons I never manage to post consistently. howeverrrrr i may or may not have planned the next 17 chapters of this fic in detail so I'm hoping chapters will come out faster. I'm hoping.
But it didn’t matter what Harry would dare to say. No one would listen to him anyway. He knew his place by now. He was a pawn in everyone else’s games. A pawn, the first piece to be sacrificed in any game of wizard’s chess. That’s all he was.
Now the room served a more important purpose. A place for the Dark Lord to gather his followers, of which Draco was one, or more accurately, would be one.
Nobody took notice of the three teenagers standing in the doorway, and Draco used this to his advantage. He walked straight to the closed privacy curtains, sure that Harry would be behind them. He was within three steps of pulling the curtains back when he was noticed.
“You killed him!” Ron spat in Draco's face but he did nothing to deny it. What was the point? Harry Potter is dead and nobody is going to believe anything Draco had to say. Besides who would honestly believe that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, The golden boy, The savior of the damn Wizarding world, would try and take his own life? The realization of that overwhelmed Draco. Was that honestly and truly what happened. Harry Potter tried to kill himself?  Harry Potter had slit his wrists in such a horrific way, try as he might Draco couldn't erase the picture now embedded in his memory. Within seconds of Ron’s outburst, pain exploded across his face. Draco didn't try to stop him, He just laid there taking everything the weasel could throw at him, knowing it wasn't enough, knowing it could never be enough. It wasn't long enough before Ron was hauled off of him, leaving Draco lying on the floor, dazed and awaiting the next strike.
“I need to see him.” he cringed at how pathetic he sounded. At how un-Malfoy he sounded. He wondered idly to himself if he could even be considered a Malfoy anymore. Being in love with  Harry Potter was sure to put a strain on his relationship with his father, wouldn’t it? He tried not to think about the consequences of his current situation.
“No it really isn’t” Harry was sure he must be glaring at the man. He wasn’t paying enough attention to notice and Harry tried to gain control of his face before he decided to look his way again. He still didn't know why Dumbledore thought he could help but he wasn't about to mess it up by letting the man know he didn't like him much.
A lump rose in Draco's throat and he fought hard to swallow it. He didn't cry. Malfoys don't cry. He chanted this in his head over and over until a single hot tear managed to escape and with it, his levee broke. Tears streamed down his face without permission and he ducked into the first door he came across.
“What was all that about?” Harry asked, irritation clear in his tone. Dumbledore merely held a finger up at him, to silence him. He sighed and they continued to walk.
“I deserved it trust me”He wanted to tell her he deserved it for not getting Harry here quick enough, for hesitating rather than bringing him straight here for being so horribly cold to him for the past seven years he wanted to tell her it would never be enough to punish him if the boy didn't live.  “Can we go to your office now?”  he asked siding off the bed and glancing around at all the people. Madam Pomfrey looked at him with pity in her eyes. He hated pity, but bit back the bitter taste of it and looked towards her office.
Harry sat in his swing and kicked the dirt. He was alone. And it was quiet. But there was something in the air that felt… well it felt like magic.
For anyone who skipped the last chapter;
“I’m off Molly, I'll be home before you know it- oh dear” Harry twisted and looked at Mr. Weasly. He forced a smile.
Chapter eleven!!! this is going by much faster than I thought, Twelve and Thirteen will be coming shortly. let me know what you think!
He wasn’t sure exactly when the girls came back. It was late into the evening when Hermione came into Ron's room. Ron was snoring on his twin-sized bed, his foot hanging off the end of it. Harry was sitting with his knees tucked under his chin on the second bed. She sat next to him.
“Oh my dear Horace, if there had been death eaters then there would have been the Dark mark in the sky. That and the presence of dragon's blood, though I will hand it to you, you make a rather convincing armchair my old friend.” Harry scratched at the back of his neck absently. He felt completely useless standing there. He was certain there was no reason for him to be here.
Harry nearly slipped on the top step. He caught himself on a rail, meant to keep the kids from falling off. When he looked down at his shoe he saw the sticky thick red and he shuddered. He almost backed away. He almost ran away. But he didn’t. He was careful not to step in the red sticky trail as he knelt by the body. By the boy.
He sat there long enough for his body to start going numb in places, tingling as the blood flow slowed too much. Birds started to sing the songs of morning somewhere close by. He still didn’t move. He wondered if Draco had ever woken up. If Madam Pomfrey and Snape had figured out what was the matter with him and healed him once and for all. A darker part of him wondered if he was dead. The thought made him gag on the bile that rose suddenly in his throat. He wasn’t used to feeling such things about Draco. His unease had always been founded in suspicion. Now his reaction came from a  place of pure concern. Light broke in the sky washing the tall grass in the colors of sunrise.
He didn’t care about the stain on his hands as he dug through his school trunk, tucked safely away in his closet. He was looking for a small sack gifted to him only a few months ago.
No. He didn’t let himself think about the train or Hermione. Or anything that meant school was coming up soon. If he thought about it then he would miss it all the more. And if he missed it any more than he already did then he would never make it the last three weeks. He would never make it.
His door opened and Draco was quick to jump up and fix his hair to lay flat and perfect again. But when he looked his mother wasn’t looking at him, but at the ring, lying abandoned on the dresser. She’d never seen him take it off.
Chapter the next! It's a longer one but and it's not my favorite but there was a lot of time to cover I hope you like it!
“What is it dear?” Mrs. Weasly called from deeper into the house.
“There have been whispers in the Ministry” He started.
Open the door but don’t drop Malfoy.
Maybe he wanted to prove something.
Thank you for your time!
“It was a piece of the mirror of Erised.” he said.
Harry was reeling, parts of the dreams were coming back with razor-sharp focus. It was painful remembering them. He can’t believe he didn’t before. It was maddening now seeing the obvious splayed out in front of him. He wanted to remember more. He tried to see more clearly the boy in the cell though Harry had a terribly sickening idea of who it would be. It hurt looking so closely. It burned.
“May I go now,” Draco demanded, standing from the chair and crossing his arms over his chest.
“Sure. who ya writing to” The question wasn’t meant to be nosy, just a way to make conversation as they climbed down the stairs. And really Harry had told Ron almost everything so it didn’t seem out of place for him to ask.
“I must admit I was surprised, Harry, to receive your letter. I had thought Hedwig was locked up on your time home.” What the bloody hell was this oafe even saying right now. He thought he heard Potter laugh quietly, almost bitterly, beside him.
“Yeah.” He said still the slightest bit short of breath.
But it wasn’t his mother's voice anymore. He blinked his eyes open, unsure when he closed them, and Harry was still there looking at him. Holding a hand out to him. He was right back in First year, holding out his own hand. Only he didn’t push Harry's hand away, he took it gently and let himself be pulled up grunting and wincing all the way.
“Draco would you consent to take Veritaserum?”
“Harry!” Hermione was shouting at him, he realized only now that she had been for some time. He was slumped over half-leaning on Ron, and his scar was on fire. “Harry!” Hermione knelt in front of him trying to regain his attention. He groaned. The images were still clear to him now. He was more desperate than ever to get back to Hogwarts.
Malfoys didn’t bow to anyone. So he’d thought. But he’d seen his father bow to the Dark Lord countless times. The Dark Lord made a noise of approval and Draco stood and left.
“So you’re to convince me then,” Horace said behind him. Harry's jaw clenched a moment before he forced himself to relax. He glanced at Horace preparing to say something though he wasn’t sure as to what. “You look very like your father,” Horace said. Harry quickly turned back to the bookshelves.
Thank you!
There was a plan. A set of rules and expectations that Draco let fall. Failure, his father always said, was not an option for a Malfoy. But Draco failed, and now there was nothing left.
When Dumbledore poked his wand into the cushion of an armchair, which promptly sprang up and into a man.
"What's the matter, Harry?" Hermione asked
The first thing that caught his eye wasn’t the dark mark standing out clear as day on the pale pale skin where the sleeve of the shirt had been ripped, or the once white button-down shirt that now clung wet with blood to the boy. no, the first thing Harry noticed was his face and the dark dark bruise on his face. And his closed eyes. And the lips that were turning blue, slightly parted. And he saw the boy’s chest shudder with the attempt at breathing.  And with sudden absolute clarity, Harry knew he had to help him.
The room, unlike the last time he had been in here, was full of people. People Draco hadn’t ever seen here at Hogwarts before and up in the middle of them all was Madam Pomfrey, directing everyone and answering questions. It dawned on Draco then that they would have called for doctors from St. Mungo's and probably other wizarding hospitals to help bring their savior back to life.
“Budleigh Babberton” Dumbledore said as if Harry was meant to know exactly where that is in the world. He was still regaining his bearings when Dumbledore took off, walking much too quickly for Harry at this time of night, reluctantly he hurried after the Headmaster. He was glad he had the forethought to bring his wand when he’d rushed to the hospital wing minutes earlier. He clutched it now in his right hand, surveying the empty darkness around them. Houses stood on either side of the street dark with the time of night. Each one of them had Harry on edge. Anything could be waiting here. Waiting for him.
In the end, it was an easy choice.
He could see was white hair and claws reaching for him. Wrapping arms around him. Pulling him back and down into an icy abyss.
The last of the night sky had disappeared for the day. He was almost to the other side of the park when something caught his eye. A color that felt out of place among the bright primary colors of the play yard and the dirt.
Open the door but don’t get blood on the welcome mat.
“Something funny to you?” The lapdog made a noise that almost sounded like a growl, pulling a chuckle from Draco's throat.
“I must be barking mad but yes I suppose I will. I’ll want a raise, mind you. And a bigger office.”
He stood behind his chair, as did all the members in attendance. The room was loud with silence. Draco had come to hate silence. He kept his eyes down. He had to, it was the rules. And for the briefest of moments upon when they entered Draco swore he saw the Muggle Studies professor hovering over the stretched out table.
"somethings happening, I don't know what it is but I'm going to the Hospital wing to Draco"
When he wakes up Harry is not there but someone else not identified is and they use a muggle shot to put him back into the coma
“Please please Madam Pomfrey we need help,” he shouted into the empty hospital wing. No one was there. Of course not, she was sitting next to Dumbledore at the feast, of course, she's not here she wouldn't need to be. Okay, he thought okay he needed to get to her now. He laid Harry down and tried not to look at the blood pooling on the white floor, he tried to erase the thought that Harry might already be gone. He ran again ran as fast as he could which admittedly was much faster without carrying the unconscious boy. Luckily the great hall was quite close to the hospital wing. He threw the doors to the great hall open and ran inside. He remembered the time in the first year when professor Quirrell ran into the great hall.
“Harry, Harry Potter.” he mumbled,  “Help him please please help him, he's in the hospital wing.” Draco gasped sucking in air that he didn't realize he had been holding his breath. “Don't just stand there! Bloody do something!” he shouted.
A bleeding wizard boy in his bed.
“Your mother was a muggle-born, you know. Truly was a shock when I found out, though she must have been a pureblood she was so good.”
And now he had to prove himself to be what he no longer wanted to be.
It was late enough in the day now that if Harry were to show himself, He’d be expected to do something for his aunt for the rest of the day. But He wasn’t exactly wanting to wait and let Malfoy get possibly worse either. Harry considered the options, not that there were many. Go out the front door, get noticed by his aunt, not be able to escape her until Vernon came home. Or, out the window beside his bed, probably break his ankle, and hope whatever help came for Malfoy would send a quick episky his way before they were off.
He was once again caught with the thought ‘why am I trying to save him as he uncapped the first of the potions. He didn’t try to answer himself and went about tilting Malfoys head back and pouring each of the potions down his throat. Except for the one for sleeping as Malfoy hadn’t so much as stirred since the long walk to the Dursleys.
first of all, I am terribly sorry for the long wait this time. life is life it happens. i am very much hoping to be able to write more often in the next few weeks to bring you chapters faster.
“The thing who used to do what?” she questioned confusion clear in her voice. Merlin, they have no idea. Draco thought to himself looking at the woman in front of him sadly.
Once in the Dark Lord's hands, he sent a curse at the woman Draco had made a point not to look at. Now he was looking though. Her body slammed into the tabletop in front of him. It was the only place he could look. He didn’t stop himself from jumping back a fraction of an inch at the impact. Her cold dead eyes were looking directly at him. He wanted to cry. He did not cry.
“Why don’t you start at the beginning?” He looked at her for a long minute before he did just that. He told her about finding Draco hurt, going to Hogwarts, getting along with him for a few days, and the way Draco shook in his arms when he carried him to the hospital wing. He left out a fair bit about the Dursleys and Draco saving him and the Dark mark Draco wore. He wasn’t looking at her as he went through the story. But when he did he found himself sorry he said anything at all.
“Come come in” Mr. Weasly ushered him inside instead of leaving for work as he was doing previously. “Molly we have a guest” Harry felt every bit that he was intruding.
The silent halls of Hogwarts were a welcome contrast to the noisy affairs back at the feast. He much preferred to be alone away from the prying eyes and whispered insults that were constantly thrown at him. His mind kept traveling back to the empty seat and found himself walking faster. He wasn't sure where he was going but wherever he ended up he needed to get there faster. He needed to get there now. He needed to, he stopped in the middle of the hallway, he needed to breathe. His chest tightened up, he couldn't seem to get air into his lungs. No, he couldn't do this here. To his right were some classrooms that he hadn't been in for a few years, and to his left, conveniently located, were the men's bathrooms. He heard voices behind him and panicked. It felt like all the walls were closing in on him, and he quickly tore into the bathrooms ripping off his cloak and dropping it on the floor. His breathing came harsh and heavy and panic clouded every sense. He splashed water on his face and yanked at his tie desperate to get some air. He stared into the sink where drops of water fell from the tips of his hair and made satisfying plink noises onto the porcelain.
“P... Potter?” The boy said, voice full of confusion. So different from how it usually sounded. Then Draco Malfoy passed out. In Harry Potter’s arms.
“No,” He said again.
“Maybe it would be best if we talked on our own, Mister Malfoy?” Dumbledore offered, ‘wasn’t that a brilliant idea’ Draco thought, forcing himself up into an almost sitting position. Dumbledore extended his hand as if to help him up. Draco only ignored it and rose gracefully to his feet. ‘It wasn't like a Malfoy to ever be anything but graceful’, his mother's voice spoke in the back of his mind from a distant memory of his childhood back when it was still decent. He shoved the intruding memory away as Dumbledore spoke again, “Mister Weasley, Miss Granger please return to the Gryffindor common room, I assure you, you will be the first to know of any news concerning young Harry.”
The seat remained empty and the Dark Lord continued talking, or rather, some take on hissing. It was a dreadful sound. It’s what Draco would imagine a snake would sound like trying to speak English. It slithered down his spine and sent a chill into the pit of his stomach.
“This” Dumbledore said, moving to stand next to him and put a hand on his shoulder. Harry didn’t shrug him off no matter how bad he wanted to. “Is Harry Potter” The excitement on Horace’s face quickly turned dark, Harry had half a mind to step away.
He heard her again and he tripped over his own feet, falling backward on his arse. Her voice was so quiet now. He craned his neck to look for her, to look up at her. For a moment he could see her, standing above him. And then she was gone and Draco was decidedly going mad.
“It’s not healing is it?” Harry asked, voice quiet and eyes looking away.
Harry sighed softly. There was nothing more he could do from here. Harry picked up the soaked towels and threw them into the floor of his closet. Another problem for another day. He was exhausted beyond belief. But his plan wasn't complete yet. He pulled out a few pieces of parchment and sat on the other side of the mattress, careful not to jostle Malfoy. With a textbook in his lap to act as a desk, he began to write.
