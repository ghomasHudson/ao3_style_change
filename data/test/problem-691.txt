“Right.” Harry says, for lack of anything else to say, and then McGonagall sighs, long and rough, her Scottish brogue thickening in preparation for what she’s about to say and Harry knows it’s going to be about the summer, and his whereabouts, and the goddamn Order and he can’t-
or maybe just his name, and she is gone in a cloud of scent and a strand of long petal-like hair on the carpet.
.  Kreacher brings him cups of endless cups of tea and Harry drinks them all mindlessly, his stomach full and sloshing; uncaring, really.
The Potions classroom is dark as ever, but slightly cleaner, the desks shinier and the walls practically wallpapered in posters of famous celebrities, who’d attended Slughorn’s ‘Slug Club’.  Slughorn’s aesthetics, Harry can only imagine.  (He wonders what Snape would think and scoffs to himself.)
God, Harry thinks, pulse fluttering weakly, hands scrabbling at the walls for purchase, mind shuddering under the weight of such unasked-for knowledge-
to summon his wandless magic, the haze of panic and disgust and fear was too strong and he couldn’t stop it-
“There was a rockfall,” Harry says, voice subdued, “And Ron and Lockhart were trapped on one side.  I-I knew I’d have to go on alone.” His eyes trace the crisp engravings, that beloved slickness.  Slime, water washing over tile, the rasp of a basilisk’s scales.  That familiar terror thudding, juddering in the pulse at his throat, the thin skin at his wrists, breaths sobbing harshly, singeing his throat with the force of them, the expiation.  The weight of a sword’s pommel in his unformed hands.  And afterwards, his hands hanging limply by his sides, heart hammering a ferris wheel in his chest until he couldn’t breathe for the terribly, lingering, pounding, for
When you live a miserable childhood, you separate, perhaps subconsciously, your existence into ‘life’ and ‘not-life’.  Harry does not count the Dursley’s as his life.  They did nothing for him, he learned nothing, he accomplished nothing, he felt nothing. (Feels nothing.) A miserable existence spent in misery, an ever-extinguishing equation of dull discontent.
Draco Malfoy is his godson and look at the Unbreakable Vow that strings tight around his throat, tight enough to cut deep and far and fast.  Look at this, look at what we have wrought, look at this beauty that is doomed before it has begun.  Complications, endurances.  Severus will endure, he will find a way.
Draco tries again, even more hopelessly this time, and Saorise lets out an inarticulate noise of frustration.
The second-year girl nods.  She’s not meeting his eyes, looking directly and resolutely at the stones; Harry feels a spurt of vague pity.  “What’s your name?” Harry asks, biting his lip, and her gaze darts up, looking astonished.
She slides up his forearm, bare and slender in the moon, her tongue flicking at the blood pooling in his palm.
They bring in the tattooist- a slim, balding, man with a wand as thick as a thumb.  He avoids the eyes of everyone there and refuses payment (Draco also thinks he may have urinated in his pants, by the smell of it).
Parseltongue is fascinating, honestly, and he is disgusted by the negligence with which Potter treats it.  He barely even uses the gift.
“But your caution is misplaced.  You will take the Mark without my magic; you have not yet earned it.”
Draco can feel a little part of him, the part balled tight and pressed into a diamond-hard kernel, melt away.
He practices his dueling- the movements, holding a slender twig in his hand in replacement for his wand.  He knows how to fight like a Muggle; years of Harry-Hunting have taught him that much, and dueling is like boxing, sort of.
Harry stuffs various Dark compendiums (glamoured, of course), his robes, his Heir rings (a trip to Gringotts informed him of his Heirships to the Potter and Black Houses), his set of brushes and ritual tools, and his course-books into his trunk.
Slowly, he stands, wincing at the pain in his knees. He feels hungry, empty, hollowed and scooped out with a silver spoon (Malfoy, his mind supplies;
There’s pain hitching in his throat and he wants to cry but he can’t.  He’s shaking, a bone-deep sort of shaking that runs through every rivulet of blood in his veins, and he bites down on his lip, hard, ignoring the part of him that whispers
Thankfully, the Dark Lord Voldemort is not present at the breakfast table, although Bella is, her dark hair falling in sleek curls, her heavy-lidded eyes alive with intelligence and cunning and just a graze of madness (it is, after all, but 6 o’clock).  “Baby Malfoy!” She coos when Draco takes a seat and helps himself to some toast.
Harry smiles, every muscle in his body screaming of exhaustion.  “We’re going to be,” He says, quiet and just a little bit vicious because the Dursley’s didn’t beat everything out of him, no, if anything, they
He’d bitten his lip so hard he’d drawn blood, desperation shining in his eyes until Pansy wacked him again and murmured a quick healing charm for his lip, a soft hand on his arm reminding him.
In which Harry Potter breathes. In which Harry Potter boards (a train of laughing chattering children, he has not been a child in so so long, adulthood is never more unbearable than in juxtaposition).  In which Harry Potter teases (a long-time enemy,  two lost children, a runaway and a slip of a prince).
France is looser about these things; he loves it there, the pretty girls with long lashes and soft hands, the pretty boys with knowing eyes and pink mouths.
You must know it pains me to have to ask you such things, when I am sure you’re still grieving our Sirius, but you
Narcissa may love him, but she is realistic and she will not steal him away, will not so much whisper any thread of anything she is planning to him until the time comes.
The lock gives easily enough, and the weight of Vernon against the door topples the bins and then the door is swinging open and Harry is standing, armed with false confidence and a string of dark-brown runes.
Draco can’t breathe, the air is strung so tightly, thick with anticipation- is he the only feeling this? He can’t
Still, he can tell that she’s excited about it, that she knows what he’s doing.  He wonders just how much she knows, how much she can converse, and feels a thrum of anticipation deep in his belly, his muscles relaxing for the first time in days-
thing and magic and their history of DADA Professors and Quidditch (which, he remembers, he’ll have to quit), is highly statistically improbable, (he’s landed himself in the hospital wing two-point-five times a year, on average) and, just, he can’t afford to be so fucking cautious
It’s just a tattoo, for now.  After he murders Dumbledore and brings filth into his home, the Dark Lord will animate it with his magic, and it will be there forever, Draco will never be able to remove it.

; Blaise understands, eyes glinting with something that makes Draco go loose and hot, his stomach pitting with something desperate.  It’s all he will get; stolen kisses and fucking in a bed spelled with enough silence and privacy wards to guard the fucking Department of Mysteries.
Also, this fic will have some minor Dumbledore-bashing. Not a fan of major bashing, but the thing is Dumbles is such a fucking manipulative
“You’re late.” Malfoy turns, his robes flicking around his feet; waves frothing at the feet of Botticelli’s Venus.  An indescribable feeling washes over Harry, glazing his thoughts- he’s been here before, seen this before, done this before, and the sensation of it is heady, dreams strung on white lawn.
His gaze catches on Ron.  The sweet coppery shine of his orange hair, so bright in the shy shafts of morning light.  The hardened set of his mouth.  He would get on the team or die trying, Harry knows, because right now this isn’t just about Quidditch, it’s about them.  Ron and Hermione don’t know what the matter was, don’t know why Harry can’t talk to them like normal- because he isn’t normal, he
It’s the witching hour (when he discovered that particular Muggle name for midnight, he laughed so hard he almost cried) when he sneaks out, an Undetectably-Extended bag carrying the elements of the ritual.
Draco wonders if the bruise will spread across his neck, his face, his feet, until his skin is purple-black all over, until he is a pool of aching.  He wonders if he will welcome it.
Maybe it is all in his dreams, his magniloquent fancies of pretent, maybe he has imagined a romance for the two of them, dreamed up glittering balustrades and stones thrown at windows.  Maybe this is
He does not let the flicker of amusement show on his face; he breathes a fog of icy mist around his thick stone walls and snow falls, thickening his defenses further.
He tilts his head down slightly, inhales the crisp fragrance of pears and elegance that hangs around her pale head in rich, moneyed, clouds.  She is- home.
Hermione seizes the doorknob, twists it with shocking savagery, and wrenches the door open, marching with short, sharp, snapping, steps- and slowing, pausing, forehead creasing in confusion.
Poets wrote poems about wars, Draco remembers, epics, and isn’t that just so Muggle, the idea of taking tragedy and utterly worthless death and making it into something beautiful- but then, he’s not too well-versed in war poetry, he doesn’t know, maybe it’s ugly.
Harry has Aoife coiled sunnily around his neck, under the Cloak, and he’s making for the second-floor girl’s bathroom, and, by extension, the Chamber of Secrets. Hopefully, he’ll avoid the prefects on patrol-
They don’t understand but they will when they die, Kreacher’s beloved Masters and Mistresses.  Kreacher is their sole caretaker, Kreacher tends to them with all the care in his broken withered labyrinth of a heart.
He can’t help thinking what Granger would think if she saw his trunk- he doesn’t sleep in the bed at Hogwarts, he sleeps in his trunk, with its large, soft, sheets and the space and the small pond with darting fish.  In it are crammed dozens and dozens of books; highly theoretical Potions texts and ancient Dark tomes (warded and glamoured with the most effective spells he knows), first-editions and signed copies.
There’s an abrupt breaking, the stone falling away from beneath him, and Draco only has time to murmur a swift Cushioning Charm before he’s landing, hard, on the slick, gleaming, tiles.
, but he’ll never match the deft ease which characterizes the way the house elves do things, he’ll more likely make a mess of things and offend them than actually help.
Draco drinks a flagon of Cruciatus Potion after dinner; the trembling in his twitching muscles eases somewhat.  This time, it had been that he didn’t have a definitive plan (
“The eloquence of your speech, not to exaggerate- nay, as if a thing was possible - was staggering in its ferocity.  I do believe that Messers Finnegan and Thomas were so overcome by it that they drifted into awed unconsciousness.”
Family magick, too, plays a role.  The Blacks have a history of Metamorphmagi, tempered by a healthy dose of madness, the Lestranges have fine cheekbones and Seers, the Bulstrodes have natural Legilimens.
Malfoy pauses, eyes flitting over Harry, stroking over the wild tufts of hair and the Gryffindor tie knotted securely at the base of his throat.  His eyes are a weight, heavy in the draughty, whispering, echoes of the Chamber, grout stained bromide and flaking with age.  He’s staring at Harry so completely, so utterly, absorbing the hollows and hallows of him, taking his measure.  No one’s looked at him with such intent before, no one’s-
When he wakes, the house is quiet.  He’s curled up in a room papered in Slytherin green and silver, tangled in a nest of sheets and blankets.  The sheets smell fresh, like crisp laundry and cotton.
“Draco.” Severus sighs, sounding so old and so, so, weary.  Draco cannot help but think of when he was little and clinging to his godfather’s robes, looking up at him with adoring gray (Black) eyes, lisping
He doesn’t have time to research for the blood ritual- after breakfast, Narcissa takes him into the greenhouse room and proceeds to shock him.
Draco watches as Potter stumbles into the Defense Against The Dark Arts (ha, he’s been training in the Dark Arts all summer) classroom, hair a perpetual mess that is truly, utterly, astonishing in the degree of its explosive messiness, robes slightly askew, and tie knotted loose around the golden hollow of his throat.  Something hollows him.  Draco can feel a similar feeling in the knot of his stomach, in the bruise that has begun to ache again (the Numbing Potions are wearing off).
Potter’s grinning, high flags of colour in his cheeks, green eyes bright. They’re- he’s slipped off his glasses, Draco realizes, and without them he looks impossibly beautiful, a bright burning pillar of glass and wild curls and violent colour. Something in Potter quickens at danger, something in him is only alive on the brink of death.  Draco’s breath catches in his throat- he’s still on his knees; it’s strangely fitting - and he feels a deep, hollowing, ache inside him, that terribly human lust for beauty.
He needs- he needs somewhere to stay.  For the two months of summer break that there are left. Harry breathes out shakily.
The tap below him widens, chasms into a gaping slick hole to slide in, a mouth to consume.  Empty space, yawning. Wide. Blackness so thick one would have to wade in it, waist-high.
He walks to the snakes section.  They hiss, eyes fixed on them.  He wonders if they can sense Parselmouths.
But everyone has always hated Slytherins, the whole school hates him and Pansy and Millie and Blaise and Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of them, green-clothed smirking daggers that they are.
Of course, he hadn’t been keeping an eye on the second Weasley.  Ginny corners him easily, her hair shining like a beacon.
Draco tilts his head, scanning the room.  He passes over the Hufflepuff table fairly quickly, and divots his attention to the Ravens-
Harry hisses at her, and the sound of Parseltongue from his lips, his lips which he has sealed so far when it comes to his Gryffindor compatriots, seems to unnerve Ron and Hermione; as he thought, really.  As he thought.
Afterwards, Rodolphus Lestrange tells him what he has to do.  There is a Vanishing Cabinet in Borgin and Burke’s that corresponds to one in Hogwarts.  He needs to repair the one in Hogwarts.
For the letters, spilling from the crisp edges of their designated parameters, spell out the damning I	A M	L O R D	V O L D E M O R T.
and they do, magic urging slack, uncooperative, limbs into seaweed motion, tendrils and front and idle pale forearms.  This is the unrest, he thinks; this is not- correct.  Accurate.  What could he have done?  They would not leave, but they are now gone, where does the line cross, where do we draw it, on the sand?  His thoughts undulate, they come in tides and moon-crests, he’s a sunken pool of forgetting on the colorfully matted floor.
Also! Now they both have snakes and GoSh, I did nOt mean for this to happen, two cutesy Parselmouths with their cutesy snakes argh I just wanted Draco to be super into snakes and Harry to have the line
“Harry, m’boy!” Harry’s hurrying to meet Malfoy; he wants to be early, he feels something deep in his bones, something he doesn’t quite understand.  Quickening in his blood, the feeling of deep-seated longing for something he cannot verbalize, lapping at the slick walls of his veins like schools of fish, until his hands are shaking from the intensity. He does not understand, but he knows this:
The days blur together in a haze of poisons and Parseltongue practice; gone is the summertime delirium in France, if it ever existed.
Eventually, they select one snake.  She’s bright yellow and about as thick as three arms.  Harry bends down, making eye contact.
One moment Potter’s pressing deeper, smiling, and the next he’s tearing himself away, face utterly white, lips slick and berry-red.  Draco can see the darkness of his mouth, that well-circle of the unknown, known.
Potter’s loosely disheveled, cheeks flushed and panting.  He runs- aimlessly, Draco thinks, seeking higher ground like a cliff swallow.  They’re on the seventh floor, Potter makes an aborted movement that may have been the start of something, and then he slides, back scraping against the wall.
“The Dark Arts,” Snape begins, his voice sharp and swarthy and alive in a way Harry’s never heard before-
Snape lets his hand fall from where it’s propped up on the doorframe and turns in a whirl of billowing robes.  “You are to do lines,” Snape says, back to Harry and it would be oh-so-easy to curse him,
Harry knows that once he’s of age and the Trace has been removed, he’s sure as fuck going to pay a visit to dear old Privet Drive, perhaps show them what an unregistered wand and several dozen tomes on Dark magic can do.  But.  This.  This Patronus.)
Now he has the filthy half-blood son of a Potter and a Mudblood as his Master and Kreacher knows that Mistress would surely not approve and yet if this is the

Harry wonders when Voldemort stopped being Tom.  When he, teetering on the knife-edged brink of humanity, had jerked in one last desperate paroxysm and plummeted unerringly for the deepest cesspits.  When Tom Riddle started looking an awful lot like a ghost and Voldemort had been the only name that comes to mind for the luridly pale, scarlet-eyed, apparition that looks more like a monster of legend than the ‘greatest wizard who ever lived’.
In Harry’s grand plan to evade his friends, he did not factor one thing into his calculations: Quidditch. He’s Captain now, and that means he has to hold tryouts and he knows that Ron will be trying out and Hermione will be in the stands.
- rendering, clarification.  He feels- solidified, startling present, the ache in his knees from kneeling, the air bent around him in tattered warmth.
He maybe shrieks spell after spell, he maybe creates a miniature tornado, wind whirling around him and smashing picture-frames, ripping pages, tearing-pulping-shredding (it's only fair, he thinks, fuck you

him.  That filthy, disgusting, scum, put himself inside Master Harry.  Kreacher cannot fathom the disgusting crime of it, it is so boggling.  The portraits, the heads, the walls, and Kreacher, they are all in agreement.  This Muggle scum must burn.
What draws people to him is the way his eyes crinkle when he smiles, the brightness of his green eyes behind those hideous glasses (an
“Er.  Shit.” Harry says, uselessly. What.  What can he possibly say?  All at once, the moonshine Luna-gleam of the night, arrayed prettily ‘round the fat stones of the castle, falls away in glittering, twisted, shards; it is just him and his two best friends, who he hasn’t spoken to in a month, staring at each other in the wild, chillingly beautiful, Scottish night.  Six feet away, and it feels like an insurmountable chasm already.
“What if I don’t want to?” Potter murmurs, and when Draco drops his hands, he’s leaning back again, green eyes bright and knifing.
The nightmares don’t stop, after that.  He wonders if they- maybe - maybe it’s like his scars, they never go away.
More than that, the ancestral lands steeped in centuries of sacrifice, the ballrooms and bright glassine dances paid for in blood.  Muggle-borns don’t understand, not really, they can’t, they weren’t raised that way.
- had backed him against a wall.  “Uncle Vernon-” Harry had said, uncertainly, and then Vernon twisted him, pushing his stomach against the wall and hefting his weight against Harry’s back, grinding his hardness against Harry, the sheaf of busty women clenched in his fist until he came in a burst of wetness.
Harry’s first instinct is to turn him down, but then he remembers Dumbledore’s half-moon’s and loopy penmanship and he smiles, bright.
After all, Dumbledore only ever calls him ‘Tom’ to his face, and that seems akin to poking a rabid dog- dangerous and illogical.  To Harry and his friends it is always ‘Voldemort’ or ‘the threat of Voldemort’ or ‘the unimaginable danger of Voldemort’.  He only ever calls Voldemort by a dead man’s name to provoke him, perhaps to cite a closeness that existed, if ever, only in the realms of fantasy.
Harry closes his eyes.  It’s not too big of a concession- the castle still has countless forgotten secrets, and dozens and dozens of secret alcoves and rooms, but still.

Draco wakes at exactly 6 o’clock, slipping off his pyjamas and folding them in a precise pile at the foot of his bed, pulling on his robes in sharp, measured, movements, fingers nimbly doing up the stays and ties; at this point, it’s second nature.
Sitting in the stands at the Tournament, Potter blooming into shape on the cold earth, slamming down, weighed down by a body that should-could-would-have breathed still.  That look in his eyes, like shattered bottle-green glass, hazy and indeterminate and searing.
“You will learn about poisons,” Narcissa says during a lull in the breakfast conversation, tucking a strand of her long pale hair behind her ear.  “I will teach you myself.”
She does, her yellow body slithering over to him and curling around him in loose, heavy, coils, and Harry isn’t sure if he’s sobbing or not.  He could be.
,” Hermione says, helplessly, and her eyes are so large and brown and glittering, her face drawn in gentle, forgiving, lines from the tip of her rounded nose to the point of her chin; everything about her is so unsullied.
Harry says nothing.  She is, after all, quite correct.  He feels small and flower-tender, standing in the cloak of night with a whitening hand clenched around his broomstick.  He feels like he’s been pricked all around his skin with fine needles, he feels a soul-deep ache and, and, and.  There’s an itchy heat behind his eyes, if he blinks the moment will pass, he’s sure of it.  Amorphous, blown-away with a breath.
The bell rings and students stream from the classroom.  Harry is lost to a sea of dizzying humanity.

It’s simple, familiar, really- the cane, the cursed silver - but the Dark Lord watches this time and Draco cannot show an ounce of weakness, so he does not cry out like he wants to when the cursed silver-side of the cane strikes him upside the ribs, when he feels the bruise blooming, spreading.
Oh, Severus thinks when he catches glimpse of the unshakable, indomitable, violescence of those clear green eyes, oh, but I thought I ruined you.
That taken care of, Harry reverts his attention to his book.  Hermione- well, maybe not Hermione, she’s always been one for the

Dumbledore and facing Hermione, Ron.  Hermione would understand, he thinks- she’s smart like that, she puts together facts and ideas, sliding them together with nary a thought, logic whirring in the cogs of her mind like some infernal engine-  but Ron and his family are loyal to Dumbledore to the last.
“Stop,” Harry murmurs over and over and over, pressing his knuckles into his mouth and relishing in the bite of teeth on skin, the shocking sting, teeth cutting past skin
And Gaunts.  Heart beating fast, Draco reads on.  (Gaunts have married into the Malfoys several times over; once in 1323, once in 1632, and once in 1698.  There’s one more, in somewhere in the 900’s, but Draco can’t remember it.)
Potter shrugs, elfin eyes dancing.  “He wasn’t really doing anything- he was more like… cheerleading.  In the background.”
Draco thinks about how he’d once extended a hand to Potter, the Heir of an Ancient and Noble House, a tentative alliance in the curve of his fingers, the chink of his elbow.  Malfoys and Potters weren’t allies in the past war, but their history extended farther than that, roots trawling deep beneath soil and tangling together more often than not.

And that’s- it’s so fucking simple that he can’t help the slightly crazed laugh that spills from his lips.  “Sorry,” Harry gasps out, and then he’s swinging his Cloak gloriously up, gloriously free, over the narrow bracket of his shoulders, flipping the hood up over his head and darting up the stairs, Silencing his footsteps and Shrinking his trunk and running, out of Gryffindor Tower, running, running, running.
Potter’s eyes follow the tilt of Draco’s lips, and he lifts slim fingers to his pouting, full, mouth, blowing- blowing Draco a goddamn
They go to Knockturn the next morning, Draco citing his need to prepare for his task.  His murder mission; his suicide mission.
“Well, prefect? You have me at your mercy now,” Harry says, smirking slightly, and they can both tell he doesn’t really mean it but Malfoy snickers anyway, drawing in on himself and tipping Harry a half-smile.
Her eyes are a knifing, piercing, blue, large and long-lashed and tinted with shades of violet, her hair is a fine red-gold curtain about the clean curve of her face, obscuring her pale features.  She looks quite ill, her skin holds a sickly shine, but she holds his gaze with equanimity, spine straightening and eyes so steady it’s almost as if she’s taking his measure.  Assessing.
Dobby worships Potter now, Draco hears.  He doesn’t blame Dobby, thinking of those long seconds he’d had to hold his fingers on the stovetop, thinks of the lamps he’d had to smash his face in, the countless punishments deserved and undeserved.
After he’s done laughing, Draco pets Saorise, fingers scratching lightly at her scales in the way she likes.  She ripples under his fingers, hissing happily.
“I will, Mother,” Draco swears, and maybe that’s enough, but he doesn’t remember what he’s promising to do, doesn’t know, doesn’t have a clue, he only knows that Narcissa is relaxing, shoulders going slack again.  She murmurs something like
Draco has been given a terrible task- tasks - and his entire torso has been cursed and his schedule has been thoroughly avulsed of everything that made it worthwhile in the first place, but he is goddamn happy and going to stay that way, at least for a few hours.

Against his will, he feels  a tired smile curl his lips, an empty sigh whooshing from him and she tracks the noise like a hound, head cocked and eyes narrowed, yanking the Cloak off of him. It absconds in a billow of furling silver, and he is at once alive and not, head spinning as he desperately tries to reconcile the friendly open faces he knows with the angry narrowed eyes of Hermione, a potent simmering brown, and the bright blue of Ron.  There’s something to say, something they’ll expect him to say- but there’s nothing he

When Kreacher tentatively prods him, Harry talks.  The words spill out of his mouth like the vomit he’s just spat out, a ball of tangled jargon but Kreacher understands, says nothing more on the matter besides
“Ye- well, no, the parts about Morgana aren’t true- Merlin’s underpants, though, definitely, I gave them to Ron as a keepsake afterwards-”
Harry meanders off- he’d meant to show Aoife the Chamber, but that’s rather ruined now, so he slips into Gryffindor Tower.  Ron and Hermione are curled in the common room, talking in low voices, but they look up as he- clothed in the Cloak but they fucking know it’s him, of course they do - walks in.
Hardly anything ever does, besides faint disdain; Draco’s been disregarding his emotions long enough that they fade into muffled, unheeded, cries.

Draco- he can’t move, not without pain.  Narcissa, her face bleached white, had helped him with the charms, and through a complex cocktail of the strongest pain-easing spells they know, it is reduced to a steady ache.  It’s- well, it’s the best he can hope for, really.

Professor McGonagall looks at him a moment longer, those sharp eyes ticking all over what feels like the various planes of his existence, and then is off in a whirl of sensible robes, a tartan scarf, and the faint powdery scent of violet water.

The rest of the train ride passes in companionable chatter.  Luna seems to understand that Harry isn’t really in the mood to talk to Ron or Hermione, and she extends an invitation to sit with him at the Ravenclaw table.
“If you’re not in Gryffindor,” Harry says, sharply, “You might as well clear out.” He pauses, biting his lip.  “And,” Harry adds reluctantly, “If you’re just here to gawk at me-” This prompts a round of furious giggles from a cluster of shiningly-arrayed Gryffindors, and Harry sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose and raking a hand through his curls, which are immutably tangled from the wind.

It would be intimidating, terrifying, if he didn’t speak Parseltongue as well, having the enormous snake slither to his side and drape over his body, but as it is Voldemort seems almost like a schoolyard bully.
There is a dreadfully, painfully, uncomfortable dinner, the Dark Lord lounging at the head of the table with Bella at his right hand, Nagini sprawling in thick bulging loops to his left.

, Harry thinks, flicking his wand in the circular motion, and the goblet blooms, shifts, hatch-marks of fur and warm beating flesh emerging, as if the mouse has always been a goblet and the goblet has always been a mouse and he has simply melted the layer of encrusted metal to reveal the true shape of the goblet; a mouse, which has been there all along.
He starts- and stares, because this scenario is so far removed from what he’d been thinking of, it was almost like something of a fantasy, a dream transcribed onto the glittering Hogwarts dark- syrupy, temperate.
The days- pass. Somehow.  He goes to classes, tries to deal with the encroaching tide of unfamiliar, alien, memories, avoids the dark and RonandHermione, and works tirelessly during Quidditch practice, until he’s- they’re all - nothing but a skin of flesh and sweat and slender bones knocking about, nothing but a hollow scooped out.  (He wonders when he will learn to be anything but concave.)
that has Uncle Vernon pushing Harry against a wall, his puce face shining and sweaty, all fat hands and the rasp of a belt buckle and heavy panting, it only just started after the Triwizard Tournament, when he was sleepless and pale and weak with nightmares of Cedric and the graveyard, when he was too tired to put up that much of a fight.

Harry Potter leads Draco Malfoy into Salazar Slytherin’s mouth, a hand braced on the crumbling teeth, and for a moment the earth is broken apart by a single stillness.  Singular.  Extraneous.
Harry twitches a hand, a wave of panicked magic displacing the cold, still, air and carrying him up the slick walls, through the channel and propelling him to the gloss-grimed tiles bordering the Chamber’s womb.  It feels like a rebirth, the action of it.

No, by a combination of a loveless childhood and a early insertion into the stark, unforgiving, field of war, Harry is totally different from James- fundamentally, irredeemably.  He thinks of Sirius, who’d perhaps expected another James or something close to him and who had landed himself with Harry- quieter, grimmer, used to the rigors of vitriol and the meaty swing of a fist, used to the serpentine cock of a pale head and the ruby angles of two eyes, unchangeable.
“He asked me how I got rid of Voldemort.  And when I asked him why he cared, why it mattered, when I told him that Voldemort was past his time, he said-” Potter swallows, voice tight, “
that they are all three of them major juvenile participants in one of the most important military/political endeavors in the last century (excluding Grindewald, that is) and when he isn’t at Hogwarts or Privet Drive he’s at Grimmauld, where, undeniably, they will dwell as well.
“Ginny,” Harry says, because what else is there to say.  There’s a senseless, inchoate, longing in him, whipping up and frothing like tides against the stark slippery surface of a cliff.  He wants warmth and he wants- he wants the comforting peppery heat of the Burrow, wants the darkness and the meaty purple of Vernon Dursley to never have existed in the first place.  God, if he’d grown up with the Weasley’s…
Harry thinks, strokes an idle hand down Aoife’s scales.  She hisses in pleasure, eyes slitting shut, and he smiles, faintly.

The bruise has spread across his ribs now; it unfurls inky-violet clouds across the white skin of his thighs, stretches twilight fingers across his collarbone.
All he knows is tearing out of the house with his messily-crammed trunk and wand and Hedwig released to the skies (she’ll find him, she always does), all he remembers is running as fast, as hard as he can.
It is in Kreacher’s bird-like bones and his green-ink blood, the walls and breathing portraits inhale when Kreacher sucks in a breath, exhale when Kreacher’s heart beats a rapid tattoo against his wrinkled thin skin.
Harry drops his gaze, engaging Luna in a conversation about Crumple-Horned Snorckacks and Erumpents. The fire is gone, leaving him feeling vaguely ill.
Afterwards, Narcissa smiles at him. Her lips move against his hair, murmuring something sacred, and she withdraws, a pale hand lingering on his shoulder.  “Make me proud, Draco.”
(It’s particularly ingenious, actually- he’s keyed the runes to them, while managing to exclude himself, through the advent of scrawling the runes in his own blood.  Hermione herself wouldn’t be able to undo it, and she’s the one who takes Ancient Runes.)
The Dark Lord laughs and Draco has no doubt that he has seen through Draco’s flimsy excuses; a flash of fear locks his knees.

The Dark Lord eyes him, amused.  Draco is disgusted at his serpentine features, at this mockery of a man who has torn his entire being, scratched and scraped at his humanity until it ran dry, carved himself into a monster with corpse-colored skin and blood-colored eyes and gaunt, stick-thin, limbs, but he’s been Occluding since he could speak French and he knows that not a trace of it shows on his face.

Because there he is, Britain’s Savior, perched demurely at the Ravenclaw table, engaged in a conversation with Luna Lovegood.
What is it like, Harry thinks, walking to the DADA classroom, to be so unwavering in your conviction, to hold something in such high esteem you are willing to kill, to sin, to burn, to die, for them?  Like Muggles, Harry realizes with a sense of sinking revelation, like Muggles and their gods.  They’d burned innocents in the name of their Gods, tortured and defiled and
“I’ll turn a blind eye.  Run along, little lion.” Malfoy says, and there’s something about his words that make Harry shudder with something he can’t name.

, of blood charts, memorized marriages and alliances and dates, of the Old Magic that fucking Dumbledore and Fudge have done their best to stamp out.
“Alright, there?” Potter taunts, thick black lashes flicking teasingly.  He strides ahead of Draco, moving fluidly towards Salazar Slytherin’s mouth, and the sway of his hips- deliberate, those black eyelashes a preface to what Draco
Potter's mouth falls open, and it shouldn’t be so attractive- stupid, boorish, Gryffindor, Draco tells himself - but Circe, it is.
With a hiss, he enlarges Aoife slightly, just enough for her to intimidating but nowhere close to her real length and loops her around his neck where she curls, content and sunny, scarf-like.
Harry glances up to see Slughorn.  The man’s peering at his cauldron, eyes wide and protuberant.  “The clear winner! Excellent, excellent, Harry!” Slughorn beams, and he prattles on about Harry’s
It’s Quidditch tryouts and Harry’s shivering, cold, the jumper under his robes threadbare and his gloves worn, the leather patchy and thin enough to prick a needle through.
That taken care of (there’s no way to ward against the cursed silver; he checked), Draco turns to Parseltongue.
Potter raises his wand, the levering of his wand arm akin to the raising of a drawbridge. It’s abrupt, and Draco starts.
He nods at her, cordial; bends his head against the fine drizzle that’s dispersing through the already cold night air, and heads for the castle.
He’d been an awful house elf, always questioning and stamping, eyes so large but slitting so thinly when he disapproved, and Lucius had attempted to beat it out of him and it hadn’t worked and here they were now.
The letters move in tandem with the motions of his wrist, exchanging places like a game of Magical Chairs.  Draco scans them- no.
- He’s half-arched up the bed now, hips canting up as he fucks into his hand over and over, eyes slitting shut helplessly. A film reel of images- Potter by the lake, Gryffindor tie slung casually around his neck, the collar of his shirt undone and hanging loose, collarbones golden and arching in the sunlight; Potter diving for the Snitch, hair wind-slaked to his scalp, robes slick against his skin with rain; Potter under the Hogsmeade sunlight, smile warm and easy and open, an arm slung around a friend’s shoulders.
“Stay here, Saorise.” Draco murmurs, glaring at her when she hisses.  He doesn’t want the Dark Lord to know about her, something about the idea of a Parselmouth he does not trust- trust
Still, he doesn’t know this man quite yet, and any Potions professor is bound to be better than Snape.
Harry Potter sits at Ravenclaw table, cloaked in enough Notice-Me-Nots to hide the Ministry and eats warily, like every bite of food is too much for his pink, soft, mouth.  Lily had those lips, Severus thinks.  Lily had those- and she - and I - what did I -
Harry knows better than he can articulate, better than Dumbledore could imagine, what it is like to be called by a name that no longer applies to you, that was given to you in a terrible place and used by people you despise. His body still jumps whenever he hears the word ‘freak’, sometimes when he hears the word ‘boy’.
But he can’t lie, memories don’t, and there’s also Sirius and hours spent alone in the attic, tossing steak to Buckbeak, eyes turned resolutely inward and
He smooths his hair, flattening it with a few muttered charms until it’s sleek and coiffed, checks his Occlumency barriers, examines his reflection in the mirror for any imperfections. There are deep bruises under his eyes; he charms them away with half a thought.  Granger may surpass him in the theoretical department (he generally can’t be bothered to write twice the required length for extra credit), he’s excellent at the practical department; he is a Malfoy, after all.  Precision,
He was a Malfoy and a Black; of course he did.  His bow was flawless, knees bending, eyes steady; locked.  And the hippogriff had liked him, even, its golden eyes searingly bright with some sort of grudging approval- and then, Draco’d insulted its appearance- one word,

“Harry, m’boy!” Harry suppresses a sigh- the only people who call him ‘boy’ are Albus and Vernon and- well. He hates them both.
He pads over to Sirius’s room, curling up in the blankets and breathing in the fading smell of him and trying desperately not to cry.

I am mobilizing a force of Aurors to search for you.  Dear boy, I know it isn’t the most ideal of situations, but this really could have been avoided if you’d just listened!
Severus.  Severus will never change, Draco knows, and Severus loves him with every ounce of love he is capable of, which is not a terribly large amount.  Most of it is so bound up in grief and denial and terrible, terrible, hatred, so deep it rocks the very core of him and hardens the shell of him until to outsiders he is a bitter, spiteful, man.
Harry lets out a shuddering breath, the Cloak swallowing the last of his silvered protests.  There’s a hypnagogic sprawl to the lesions of his thoughts.  He’s barely leapt onto the bed before he’s fast asleep.
He can recite every Malfoy-Potter marriage in the last three hundred years, and if James Potter had lived, Potter would have been able to as well, Draco knows.
The trouble is that Draco is more magically inclined to healing spells (which he discovered after Narcissa drilled the need for them into him), naturally more inclined to the, well,
He curls up on the damp, dew-furred, grass with his wand clutched so tightly in his fist it feels liable to snap.  He must have broken past Dumbledore’s magic somehow- he doesn’t particularly care, all that matters is that he has it now.
Apparently, he was sleeping during an important Death Eater meeting (Draco isn’t even a Death Eater, how was he supposed to know?) and as such, Lucius punishes him.
Vernon’s hand slips, grazing Harry’s skin, and then he’s yelling, the flesh of his ring finger pink and blistering.
He’s been staring, mouth parted.  He needs to stop doing that, but Harry finds himself veering into his mind far too easily these days, falling prey to the drift of thoughts like poetry, and his skull is a cage of bone and misdirection and he cannot possibly break through.  Harry’s mind is in shambling disarray, he notes, thoughts strewn like paper fireworks across the vast, eolian, abyss he has yet to plumb. Wind-strewn, mussed, quicksilver thoughts skating across the icy rime of perception, emotion a thick tinge illuminating and individuating the violence-wrung wreck of him, sea brine and blood.
She stirs and hisses at him.  Draco conjures two white mice for her, tosses them to her, watches as she rears and attacks them, lightning personified.
McGonagall smiles, a rare occasion made all the rarer by the fond shine to her eyes- which are, Harry realizes, a very pale shade of blue, colored with startling complexity, like the grains of a star.  “Well, Mr. Potter.  I daresay you’re the best student for the job.”
The house-elves are eager as ever, piping voices and Dobby’s large eyes; he thinks, again, of Eilonwy.  There’s something
Harry’s feet clip the loose stone he should have remembered because it’s been there all six years of his Hogwarts education, he hisses
God, his eyes.  They’ve always been that frightening shade of green, as long as Draco’s known him, but now they’ve taken on a bluish cast, like pictures he’s seen of newborns- a flat etiolated patina coating the sheen of his irises.
Aoife ripples sicilian and serpentine ‘round his neck, spilling from his throat and curling sinuously around his waist.
“Do you have something for me?” Harry asks, and she nods, looking apologetic and thrusting the crumpled paper towards him.
“No, I-” Harry gasps out, but Vernon is slamming him to the ground on his stomach and yanking down his jeans-
Potter chuckles, his laughter a warm and easy refrain in the undertow of Draco’s thoughts, which are, at the moment, comprised primarily of
“Bye, Professor!” Harry cries, hasty and shaking and he’s gone, whipping past the door and breaking into a sprint.  His foot clips something skidding and damp on the cobblestones and he barely catch himself before he trips.  It’s a copy of the Daily Prophet, fresh from breakfast, the ink slightly damp on the cold wet stones.
“Sir.” Harry nods.  “McGonagall explained about your situation- we have several old Potions textbooks in the cabinet right over there, and I’m sure you’ll be able to find the necessary equipment!”
they’re awful, Harry, I really do, and it definitely isn’t the best place to grieve and I’m so sorry about everything, but you really need to think about your safety!
At long last, he decides on a magically-enhanced brew with deadly extracts of nightshade and water hemlock.  He bottles it and coats in layer after layer of thick, protective, magic.
Instead, the runes guarantee painful itching and hair loss if any of the Dursleys cross the threshold with intent to harm, and second-degree burns if they actually

She identifies half a dozen poisonous plants in the space of a few seconds and arranges them from least poisonous to most deadly in a flash; her fingers are precise and careful as they draw venom from a Stunned taipan.  She murmurs tales to him of poisoning and espionage as she tips a few drops in a cup of tea, shows him how to stir quickly, quietly, wandlessly.
He’d thought it some miraculous feat, some marvelous legerdemain, and marked it as another curio of adrenaline, of the peculiarities of circumstance in which a heart afire with fear could find itself in.
Hermione. His mind flits to the last time he saw her, face damp and terribly, horribly, confused, her hair making an explosively bushy aureole around her face.  He can’t even begin to articulate why he’s avoiding her, only that this farce of normality is suddenly desperately important for him to keep up, and he knows that if he spends even more than five minutes in her presence, her or Ron both, he will spill his secrets in gasping confessional and she will see the emptiness in him where once dwelt the light of passion, Gryffindor-gold and bright as a star.
Now, I understand if you’re embarrassed or angry, but this goes beyond that.  I quite empathize, but your safety is key.  Your
He sequesters himself in his rooms, only emerging for meals and lessons with Narcissa .  He decides on slipping the poison in the old fool’s lemon drops; it’s easiest, although the thought makes him feel sick, panicky.
yesterday I made a dress and the day before that i made a gathered skirt with blueberry fabric- by which i mean the fabric had blueberries on it like polka dots, 'tis very fetching - and today i made an apron and i feel like i could be a good housewife.  homemaker? domestic goddess?  because also i made crème brûlée the other day (which isn't that much of an accomplishment.  it's very misleadingly easy.  if anyone's interested, i used the website "Sally's Baking Addiction" which i highly recommend for all baking pursuits, especially cake and orange curd) and i feel so hip.  i have not yet made sourdough but it's a situation that is liable to change, so i'll keep you guys updated.
“Soon, I might be able to understand you,” Draco whispers to Saorise, smiling as she winds around his forearm, tongue flickering.
He plays favorites like you wouldn’t believe; he hates Slytherins and purebloods, though he comes from an ancient line himself.  He claims to be unprejudiced, but Draco knows better.
The light is damp and cool and barely there when he pops into existence.  A batty thing, the disgraced filthy Black called him once, many times, a barmy elf, mad-as-a-hatter- Kreacher doesn’t know why a hatter would be mad.
he’s only been to about three places in his life- five, if you count Diagon and Hogsmeade, although Hogsmeade is debatably under the purview of Hogwarts, and six if you count the graveyard, which Harry doesn’t.)
He spends time with Luna, that ethereal dream-tied creature of air and the lonely blue of twilight, who witters about thestrals and places cool hands on his and smiles at him, heedless of recompense.
Harry bends his head, chin pressing into his sternum, hurrying hurrying hurrying, anything to get out of this dark corridor that looks like unraveling thread and paths that lead further into the dark, not the light.  There’s something there’s something there’s something-
There is blood dripping down his face and blood pooling in his arse from Vernon shoving in but Vernon doesn’t care why would he-

. She hisses firmly, and Draco shakes his head, he needs to find some way to subvert this, the Dark Lord is insanely good at magic but nobody is perfect.  (Except Draco, he needs to be, he must be, he is a pureblooded Heir to the House of Malfoy, nobody can be more perfect than him he must smile perfectly score perfectly shake hands perfectly bow perfectly kiss hands perfectly dance perfectly flirt perfectly fuck perfectly-)
His resolve wilts under her shrewd, disbelieving, eyes.  “Ancient Runes,” McGonagall repeats, slowly, “Which you have never shown any interest in, three years late- I suppose you might be able to take it with the third years if you like, Potter-”

There’s an underwater feel to it all, his head heavy and sound rippling in isacoustic reverberations. The light, too, a vatic gleam, strange and pelagic.
Harry leans, sags, really against the beanbag, an overwhelming urge to go to sleep surging over him.  The fragile, fissiparous, fragments of his self-made reality are crumbling to shreds around him and he cannot do a thing.  He cannot do a
The fat lump of Muggle scum is sitting on an equally lumpy couch of little to no taste (what can you expect, Kreacher, Walburga purrs low and sweet in his skull, they’re Muggles, after all).
Now, this. Slughorn, round belly encased in emerald green, watery eyes and handsome jowls, chuckling and eyeing him with contrived camaraderie.

He can’t tell if his dreams are nightmares or not; they all revolve around snakes and flickering tongues and pain; red eyes warring against the greenest eyes he’s ever seen.

Think of your family; think of your friends, who are quite worried for you. I believe Ms. Weasley, in particular, told Severus off in a quite spectacular fashion, with a rather magnificent Bat-Bogey Hex.  More to the point: if you do not report back, I will be forced to register you as Missing- you have not yet reached the magical age of majority, Harry!  Come now, return home!

Later, Harry doesn’t remember anything.  There is only the breaking, the shattering, the sense of utter loss; there is only the violent fury and virulent wrath.  All of his broken, jagged, edges, smashed and ground and burnt by the weight that is Vernon Dursley, every sharp edge pulverizing the other, grinding and grinding in time to Vernon's thrusts, whittling him down and prying him apart with clammy hands and cloying claws (everything smells like peaches) until he's not even broken he's not even dust he's not even human he's not even-
When he gets back to the Manor, he is confronted by Nagini, who hisses threats at him until he kneels.  He gets to his feet afterwards and walks as quickly as he dares to his rooms, breathing out in relief when he sees Saorise safe and sound.
! and the sour-faced house elf appears, bulbous eyes narrowed. He’s muttering something unpleasant about being forced to appear where there are so many Muggles around, but Harry can’t- can’t deal with this.
and then it’s over and Harry’s shaken and hollow and slinking to the back of the classroom, his cloak of Notice-Me-Not’s settling over him like driftwood.  It doesn’t have to make sense, he thinks. Just-
“Looks like the little lamb has left the fold,” Blaise croons, something sharp and predatory glittering in the sclera of his eye; when Draco blinks, he sees phosphenes glittering and blooming on the edges of his vision.  “Blaise.” Draco grits out, closing his eyes, “Please stop that.”
Closes it, he feels sick suddenly.  “Hi,” Harry says, weakly, balling the crumpled thinness of the Cloak in his pocket.  He can’t say anything- they want him to say something, but what can he say?  What can he-
And.  Lord.  He’s spoken with snakes of all kinds, chatted with Saorise, hissed back and forth with a snarky adder, and all of it hasn’t prepared him for hearing Parseltongue fall from Potter’s lips with unspeakable eloquence, susurrating up Draco’s
“You will take my Mark.” The Dark Lord says at length, and while Draco’s walls are meters thick and coated in ice and magic, he can’t stop the small inhalation of breath.
He makes his way to Defense just in time- and oh, fuck. Snape’s there, the tip of his nose and the slick oil-shine of his hair.  The sear of his black, black, eyes.  Those eyes loved my mother once, Harry thinks numbly, feeling pinned to the wall with accusation.
and he wants to get away, he almost turns back and runs outside, to the cool damp kiss of the rain, but Luna places a gentle hand on his arm and murmurs a spell, and the roar recedes to a reasonable amount.  Harry smiles at her, relieved.
Narcissa holds him oh-so-delicately in her arms, and he thinks of how funny it is, that getting bruised again again again makes him stronger, and yet here he is, being held like he is made of spun glass, like he is a sweet intricate confection, thinner than glass and sweeter than sugar.
“Oi, I’ve got it.  That nasty git, Kreacher, might’ve done something- wouldn’t be the first time a house elf blocked Harry’s mail, would it?”
It doesn’t work at first, it needs more of a kick, so Draco casts a Dark Magic stasis charm, one intended for preserving bodies, and the bruise slows and settles finally, peevishly.
and how he must have inherited her Potions skill, and Harry just nods.  Fuck, why does everyone want to talk to him about his
his body whispers).  He doesn’t bother with the Cloak- there’s a reckless kind of insolubility to him,
If the destruction of a locket was so important to Voldemort, if that was what tethered him to life…
But of course, Vernon chooses this time to have a whit of common sense and he grabs the collar of Harry’s shirt and pulls him out of the room,
Saorise hisses in delight and leaps on it, her fangs ripping the tissue-thin petals to wet shreds.  Draco stares in silence, and then shrugs.  It doesn’t matter that much, does it.
“Yes, Potter, your OWLS.” McGonagall repeats, impatient but not unkind. A strand of hair, graying, slips from her tight bun.  She slides a sheet of paper over to him.
The thing is, he’d be able to conjure- well, one cannot conjure food, it goes against Gamp’s - he’d be able to
, when he is curled over the empty spaces in between his bones, the hollow pit of his stomach, the soft spaces in between the knobs of his spine, he feels like an altar to some unholy deity, he feels like salted earth and blood-sown seeds; what is left after a desolation is rarely pretty and there is no uglier thing than the vacancy inside him.)
Potter’s gone silent, his face whitening, fists curling into loose flowers at his sides.  There’s an almost indiscernible tremble running through him, and his eyes-
God, he’ll have to avoid landing himself in the hospital wing the whole entire term, which, given the whole
It really isn’t about blood purity, and for a second Draco hates Voldemort for making it about that.  (Only a second and then he tamps it down, twisting it painfully and shoving it in a tiny velvet box, tosses it in the narrow creaking closet where he keeps the rest of the Things Lucius Malfoy Would Not Approve Of, where he keeps the memorized lines of the muggle poet Oscar Wilde he’d read in France,
“I resent that implication.” Harry says, lofty, but he’s stifling a smile.  It’s funny- when he’s with Malfoy or Luna, he feels more like
He sets Saorise in the center of the circle, and she wreathes slowly, scales glinting.  Draco concentrates on the magic, concentrates on the wand movements he’s memorized, the sinuous undulation of it.
, so banal and benevolent a word for the grotesque items he must tick off on his to-do list: murder, child-endangerment, breaking and entering…
He lets go of his trunk and walks up the stairs, opening the first available room and curling up in the bed, letting the darkness at the edges of his vision eclipse the light.
Draco can’t quite help the laugh that bubbles from him, if only because of the utter implausibility of the situation.
They make their way into the bathroom, shoes skidding across the grimy slick of the tiles.  Potter’s been here before, his footsteps tread with familiarity, breaths slowing and eyes on the tiles, almost like a pattern.
A brief glimpse of Potter’s face- stark, stricken, and then Potter’s drawing himself up and intoning “Malfoy” with cold, contemptuous, dignity.
“You’re different this year,” Harry says, quietly, and lets the Cloak slide silkily from his shoulders, exposing a drowsy Aoife.  Malfoy’s eyes widen.
Apparently, Parseltongue is not like every language, it cannot be learned by everyone.  Those with expressed Parseltongue traits speak it automatically (
Draco exhales shakily, sliding Saorise around his neck and straightening his robes, smoothing his hair.
Potter runs out of Potions as soon as the bell rings, and Draco, curious and more even-tempered than he has been in what feels like years (hating Potter took a lot of his energy, Draco realizes), follows.
Draco remembers the dementors, remembers hearing of Potter’s fainting fit.  They’d all felt it, even the Slytherins, that sense of dull horror-
The thought doesn’t disgust him as it should; Harry feels… numb.  Blank.  Pain no longer has much of an effect on him; he is too used to it.
Ron would be disgusted, horrified.  He’d claim it didn’t make a difference to him, but if Harry looked into his eyes he would see the pity and disgust.
Snape looks at him, onyx eyes assessing and sharp, and Harry wonders if Snape’s capable of wordlessly and wandlessly Legilimizing him, Professor Dumbledore and Voldemort certainly are.  Harry drops his gaze.
gesture, but the way he does it, all loose shoulders and lean, relaxed, lines of muscle, makes it look artful.
also i've been reading stuff lately and i thought to leave you with some quotes to repurpose and sound smart/edgy/like an educated, cultured, European, intellectual with sweater vests and Oxfords:

Sirius, laughing in a photograph, pink-cheeked and glittery-eyed, Sirius, bored and haughtily handsome, a twitch of his wand hoisting Snape up in the air, Sirius, gripping Harry’s shoulders tightly, holding him just
Harry knows how that feels.  He used to feel the same way, like he- or, rather the mask he wore - was close to breaking- on the brink of breaking- broken.  Now that it is, what is left is a total absence, a desolated plain, and it’s freeing.  He wonders what Malfoy would look like, free.
Draco’s so distracted that he barely scrapes together a passing grade.  He imagines Severus’s horrified face, and then, the expression Severus would make if he found out Draco was staring at
He really, really, wants to be a Parselmouth, and it is that that sends him bolt upright, a shaking hand doing up his shirt buttons, slowly.
He knows Voldemort lived in an orphanage, once, in the middle of World War II and he knows, too, the peculiar kinship between them.
For as much as the Light preaches, one has to only look at their family trees, and well.  The evidence speaks for itself, purebloods are purebloods, no matter how you want to look at it, casting shadows and labeling things ‘Light’ and ‘Dark’.
that’s not RonandHermione who believes him.  He writes a note to Malfoy, writes a time and a date and the location (on the floor of the girl’s bathroom).  Waits. (He doesn’t have to for too long; he gets a response the next day:
Draco mutters a curse in Latin that would make his mother’s ears bleed and casts a few quick wordless charms, straightening everything and dampening the high flush in his cheeks and the feverish light in his eyes, muffling the aching pain of the rib-wide bruise so he can walk without wincing.
“We will do what it takes to survive, Dragon.” Narcissa’s lips barely move against his skin, whispering secrets into his ear.  “We will not forget this insult,” Narcissa breathes, and he feels it strengthen in his body, harden like steel exposed to cold.
The next few days are blurred, grayed and curling at the edges.  After the first, dreamless, sleep, he is plagued by nightmares of hot, sweaty, palms and rough breath in his ear; he vomits and vomits and still he does not feel clean inside.
, because there’s no way Malfoy is a Parselmouth, but Harry can’t escape the feeling that he’s missed something.  He wants to ask-
He sets the ritual, the athame, pentagon, chalice, wand, in their allocated positions.  He breathes deeply, takes his wand, purifies the air, and casts a ritual circle, walking clockwise.  It shines brightly in the shifting shadows.
Blaise is grinning, teeth looking white and disturbingly sharp against the warmth of his skin, and Draco is reminded for the first time in years that this is the son of the woman who’d lured, married, and slayed seven men without a flicker of remorse, without ever being arrested or even detained for questioning.
But please, Professor Dumbledore is quite worried, and he’s- well, he’s rather scary when he works up to it - prepared to do rather a lot to find you.  (I’m keeping an eye on him, don’t worry.) And, yes, we’re all quite worried as well.  I’ve been doing tracking spells over and over with the Christmas presents you gave me even though I know they won’t work, because according to Golpapott’s Third Law of Elemental Tracking, the object has to be a personal object or object that would have the specific person's essence in its workings, and I can’t believe I’m disregarding it, but, well… scientific method?  Trying what works, I guess.
Draco tries, a little weakly, a little pointlessly, and Saorise just shakes her head and slithers onto his shoulders, careful to avoid the bruise.
, Draco thinks abstractly- one second, only, because Potter’s eyes are horrified and so very green and he’s sprinting away, and Draco’s alone and so very very cold.
It’s not as bad as it could be, honestly.  The bruises litter his body like bodies on a battlefield, the most recent ones an inky violet, fading fingerprints of yellow-green dotting the curvature of his ribs.
Draco doesn’t bother to explain that Slytherin takes in the battered ones, the one that life has crushed, and sharpens them all into something wicked and strong.  He doesn’t bother to explain that they are cruel but they are kind, that the volley of clever wordplay is

At some point, Dudley wanders back into the house, plucks a peach from the fruit bowl, and wanders back out, banging the door shut as he goes; the sound makes Harry start, almost dropping the twig.
Draco gags, and as soon as the Death Eaters are gone, Narcissa rushes to his side; cool careful fingers combing through his hair, murmuring pain-relieving charms and hauling him up.
The idea of being able to do something real, something definite, is like a punch to the stomach, Harry’s breathless and smiling for once; he raises his wand and intones
His magic is tearing, furious, broken, a thousand storm clouds gashing a thousand teeth and maybe the world could burn and him with it and maybe he would like it; welcome it, even-

My next update will not be for a couple of months.  Why? Well, because, quite frankly, the way I write things- I write chapters and post them directly after i have finished, which is most likely fueled by the temptation of instant gratification (aka me being a comments/kudos whore ;) - is just not feasible. It isn’t sustainable.  Therefore, I’m looking to create what is called a “buffer”, meaning I’ll have several chapters already written and therefore will be able to post more regularly and confidently.  Which means, unfortunately, your next update won’t be for a long time.

“Harry.” Ginny clips out, fierce.  She’s always been fierce, even hidden under the doe-eyed fangirl from second-year, or maybe Tom did that, Tom carved out the heart in her which was made of mollusk hearts and melting sugar and shoved his hands deep, shoved in iron and coal and fire.  Tom does that to a lot of people, Harry thinks, senseless. Tom did that to him-
“Trust me, I’ve been wondering about that everyday of my life,” Potter mutters, sliding his hands in his pockets- such a
He leans in instead, closer to Malfoy, nostrils flaring as he inhales the spicy, expensive smell that hangs around him.  He wants to open his mouth, wants it in his throat, wants to choke on it.  He smiles, instead.
The thought or Sirius makes him feel simultaneously angry and empty- emptier than the norm, that is.
Slowly, carefully, Harry spreads fingers on the bruises and concentrates.  He can’t get all of them- he leaves the biggest ink-colored bruise on his hip, but he gets most of the fresh bruises, watching as they fade.  Yellow green, the color of safety.
Kreacher, who seems to be warring with his dislike for Harry and his approval at Harry’s actions, nods again and promises to ward the house against any visitors. By the satisfied glint in his eyes, Harry suspects that trespassers will be greeted with something along the lines of death and dismemberment, but he doesn’t have the heart to care.
He hasn’t thought of Malfoy in months; their seething animosity seems childish, superfluous, now, and it’s almost anachronistic to meet his gaze, like he’s been plucked from the grayness and desolation and slipped back into the old easy ways, identifying enemies by the color of their ties, green or red.

Harry knows that Dumbledore has and always will call him ‘Tom’, which he supposes Dumbledore thinks is some brave and noble attempt to remind the man of the humanity which he had blatantly and remorselessly discarded.
He could be- he could.  He’s still making something of himself, Harry remembers, still trying to build something that resembles a human out of the scattered, tattered, desolation of his self, like transmutation, like alchemy and bloodied stones and black cauldrons.  That person, that- he could be like Luna, if he wanted, and it wouldn’t, necessarily, have to be like trying on a mask- or it would be, but like trying on enchanted clothing and having it assimilate to your body, absorbing the essence of you through the keyholes of your pores, your ears, the cavern of your mouth.  He could be like anyone he wanted, he could believe in Nargles and wear radishes, he could give zero fucks about Britain and swan off to Zimbabwe, he could, he could, he could-

He can’t sleep but he is always, always, tired.  Kreacher makes him rich, glistening, meals; everything tastes like ash in his mouth, like oxygen and saliva, like nothing at all.
“Well, Mr. Potter?” Professor McGonagall says, impatient, and Harry reaches out a hand that he’d like to pretend is not trembling as it undeniably is, and snatches it up, quick as a mouse.  “Thank you,” Harry breathes out, grateful because he can only imagine how irritated she must have been when he’d run away like a bloody coward and secluded himself-

Draco exhales, shakily, a hand trailing down to the tie of his pyjamas.  He slips a hand around his aching cock and groans in relief.
Harry opens his mouth. Closes it. There’s something for him to say, isn’t there, bright and perfect and just out of his reach, something that will make him sound exactly a proud son to his Gryffindor-to-the-utmost-maximum father, bright and messy-haired and beloved by three-quarters of the school.  He can’t think of anything.  Maybe he isn’t supposed to.
Hermione damn Granger.  He feels a swell of longing, surging up so soundly and totally he can’t move for a few seconds, washing him in shades of nocturne and pitch-violet.
She emits an annoyed hiss, and Draco laughs, conjures a few white mice for her.  He has to get back to his poisons, he has to plan.  He’d originally thought of the lemon drops that the old fool is so fond of, but he offers them to every student who enters his office, and Draco is many things, but not a murderer.
Blaise and his mother are both lilith, which are cousins of the veela, with a powerful, dangerous, allure- not one that controls attraction precisely, but that wreaks havoc on the mind, the senses.  Draco supposes he should be grateful for the fact that Blaise stopped it before it got to his other senses.
Harry swallows and nods, drawing his wand from his waistband.  He feels the leaping magic at his fingertips, rushing into his wand with eager avidity.  Harry opens his mouth, closes it. Nonverbal.
They go to Borgin and Burke’s within the week, and Draco threatens the man at the counter, hardly aware of what he is saying, until the stammering man tells him what he needs to know.
Basically, in this AU at least, Harry doesn't show at least 60% of his potential (he does have about 80% harnessed for use in truly dangerous situations, but he's learned not to outshine people).  Not to worry, this will soon change.  (or, not soon, exactly?  Three chapters?  Four?  Is that soon?  *shrugs*
Narcissa, on the other hand, is the epitome of a Lady of an Ancient and Noble House, of a Slytherin.  She is beautiful, all dark Black eyes and soft pale hair.  Icy when confronted with enemies, warm with him (not lately, but he remembers it still; how intently she would listen as he babbled about his day, how she taught him to be strong enough to withstand the weight of the world, the softness of her hands as she smoothed his hair, the letters she wrote him- writes him - her elegant quillwork taking up five pages, at least).
He sees Hermione and Ron whispering furiously at the Gryffindor table and can’t help wincing.  He misses them but he- he

He pads to Sirius’s room, Aoife knowing better than to follow him, and sinks onto his bed.  He goes here so often that it’s stopped smelling like Sirius and started smelling like him, but that’s alright.  He never really knew what Sirius smelled like anyway.
P.S. So, this fic started out as a "Draco-Centric" fic, featuring Draco and only Draco as the main star, but I soon realized that with Harry, we have a framework of events and shit, what with the Slug Club and Dumbledore's lessons and Quidditch and the H-BP and with Draco, it'd basically just be: "Draco.... still hasn't finished his tasks yet.  He's delaying!  Delaying!  Delaying!  Because he doesn't want to let a bunch of homicidal maniacs run loose in a castle full of children!"  Which is... boring. So, it's now more Harry-centric.  Sorry!
Well.  Mostly empty.  Luna’s there, curled up with her copy of the Quibbler (she’s reading it sideways, which Harry finds rather droll), and although the thought of being with the cheerful, beaming, faces of his fellow Gryffindors makes him want to curl up like a slug presented with salt, he finds he doesn’t mind Luna.  Here, another child of perpetual loneliness.
I’m really worried for you, Harry.  I hope this finds you, somewhere.  I was going to track the owl but apparently the Ministry has spells against that, and I’m not confident enough to follow it on a broom.  (I’m sure Professor Dumbledore would have someone able doing it, but I’m… well, I thought it only proper for you to come out when you’re ready, although you should be ready
“We were in Slytherin’s Chamber, it seemed appropriate.” Harry quips, and his eyes fall on the cave-in. He’d cleared away the rubble, but he couldn’t grow the walls back again.  “Lockhart tried to attack us,” Harry continues, words cool, “Tried to wipe our memories and erase our minds, it was the only thing he knew how to do, really-”

He is bereft, he is thestral-colored inside, he is laconic and marmoreal and something he cannot define but is perhaps the exact shade of nothingness, he is not anything close to the Harry James Potter they think they know.
(About Kreacher- his opinion of Harry seems to have changed drastically.  When he hears that Harry has, for all intents and purposes, decided to cut ties to the Order, he is begrudgingly hopeful; when Harry aimlessly begins carting the ‘Dark’ artifacts back into the places they belong, fingers moving out of intuition, realigning the webs of energy and snapping things into place, Kreacher lights up, when he sees Harry examining the Black family wards and working his blood into them, he is ecstatic.  Funny, really, the change in attitude, the change it wrings on the house.  The dingy, grimy, house is bright and opulent now, Kreacher cooking meals in freshly washed cotton; Harry barely notices it.  Everything is gray, God, he just- he can’t - it doesn’t

And now, Kreacher knows he is right.  Master Harry, with his viridian eyes and messy Potter hair, has been Black all along.  He watches Master Harry devour books on Dark Magic, Darker and Darker and Darkest, venturing further and further into the Blackest corners of the Black library.  He watches Master Harry practice curses so foul that Mistress Walburga would cry in happiness, watches the portraits appraise Master Harry with prying laconic eyes.
No, it isn’t the blood purity, really.  Purebloods aren’t fucking stupid, they understand the dangers of inbreeding. Magic is magic and magic is might; fresh blood is always appreciated. In the 1800’s, purebloods would take in muggle-borns (it’s the magic that matters, after all) and raise them pure, steeping them in a complex brew of grace and waltzing and decades,
Draco watches as the right side of Sev’s mouth drifts up in unwilling amusement.  He slams it down as soon as he sees Draco’s grin, scowling.
“Most… thoughtful of you, Draco.” Voldemort whispers softly, resting his skull on a single white palm. The sibilant sound of voice sends shivers through Draco; he sets his feet slightly further apart, bracing his weight more steadily.
It starts like this: on accident.  Harry’s got his eyes on the serpentine sconces, all lazy scales and sinuous thickening, and his next offhand comment comes out in Parseltongue.
Hermione would handle it better; she would order dozens of books on the psychological damage of child abuse and handle everything in the most politically correct way possible, sickeningly careful and gentle in her interactions with him, as if he were some unspeakably delicate treasure fashioned of glass rather than a boy who had been broken so many times before that his scars had scars had scars.
The snakes immediately descend into a frenzy of hisses, arguing over who’s the most venomous and who’s the longest and who’s the thickest.

Severus is staring at Potter, those eyes which have only been directed to Draco with irritation at the most, are glaring at Potter as if by the sheer force of his hatred, he can excise Potter from this plane of existence. Potter looks trapped, his right hand curling into a delicate fist, thumb running feverishly over the dry skin of his index finger.

A hissing laugh; “Rise.” Draco concentrates on his Occlumency barriers, smoothing on curses; here, a curse that’ll freeze the blood in your veins; here, a curse that’ll turn every bone in your body to dust.  His face is expressionless; the consummate pureblood son.
Potter’s always been attractive, even in his baggy Muggle clothing and hideous glasses, his hair muffed up and atrocious, his eyes have always been that deathly beautiful green, as unearthly and haunting as an aurora borealis, his skin has always been that warm color, the arch of his cheekbones and the tilt of his eyes have always been that enticing.

He works them to the bone; past that, to the marrow, until not even Ginny has the energy to approach him, until their minds are collectively empty and utterly displaced of anything but the implacable need for warm water and sleep and food.

. (People nattered on about how he’d stopped Voldemort, but if Dumbledore had wanted to hide the Stone, he wouldn’t have announced to the
?  He’d fallen into the Veil, and Potter had almost followed him so distraught he had been, wasn’t that so wonderful?

throat bared for her teeth.  It never will be; she loves him lion-like, and it niggles at him, worries at him like an itch he cannot scratch-
- loyalty is to him, which, to Draco- a child whose parents don't really show a lot of affection, who's been treated as a pawn his whole life, who's been tortured, means a
Death Eaters would use the witch-burnings as examples, sheaves of paper detailing their wrongdoings.
” Shrieking now, desperate, the end of sound drifting up into a tight wail.  They do not leave, they scramble on their beanbags and look at him with enormous eyes asking, asking, asking, and he begs the Room, begs it
the time for reckless Gryffindor-ness!  (At least you brought your trunk and presumably, your homework, with you, I suppose.)
he thinks starkly, astonishingly, of James Potter and Lily Evans and hatred and hexes and a blossoming, billowing, romance.
Draco tells himself, and he doesn’t even blame Potter- he’s disgusting, a monster has touched this skin, bruised him, Marked him.). Still, how had he been so foolish, how could he?  He’s a fucking Death Eater, and he’s just kissed (admittedly, it’s not likely he’ll tell, like that’s any sort of condolence) Harry fucking Potter. He- Circe and - and - Merlin. Merlin.
Harry steps forward, eyes on the paper in the girl’s fist.  She’s trembling slightly, and Harry feels bad but not that bad.
The portraits, the living-breathing-beating Black treasures, and when Master Harry reconnects them in a way not even Kreacher can, in a way that only a Black can, absentmindedly correcting the flow of energy and repairing the terrible, gaping, damage that the filthy disgrace and that mongrel Mundungus Fletcher have wrought on this Ancient and Novel House, Kreacher- and the portraits lining the walls, the heads of his ancestors plaqued on the lily-gilded embossed wallpaper - knows that Master Harry is truly a Black, truly the Lord of their Most Ancient And Noble House.
Harry hiccoughs in relief, shooting several breath-freshening charms at his mouth, and hisses, his voice cracking,
It’s such a stark contrast to their previous interactions- teetering a knife’s edge between teasing flirtatiousness and buried sincerity  -  that Draco gapes for all of one second before composing himself- exacting architecture, the cold, clean, lines of his face in unflappable repose.  He is Narcissa Black Malfoy’s son, after all.
“You’re a Parselmouth?” Harry says, disbelieving, because he’s certain if Malfoy spoke Parseltongue he would have showed it off by now, or, or
A monster reaches out with one languid, white, hand, spidery and thin and unspeakably austere, and Draco does not move a muscle.
“Excellent lesson, sir.” Draco says, smiling cheerfully.  Severus’s scowl becomes, if possible, even more pronounced.
“Just-” He chokes out, the jagged edges of his own voice a soothing refrain in the humming quiet of Hogwarts asleep (but not quite; no, not ever).  “God-” finally, shaking, falling apart, meat falling gently off bone-
Saorise is small enough (Draco has a Shrinking Charm on her; otherwise she’d have been confiscated) that she goes unnoticed, although the way Nagini’s eyes linger on him, he doubts it will be for long.
slipped backwards, because although he knows the exact improbability (it’s a tally and sum of every interaction, every sneer every hiss every glare every action and its equal, opposite, reaction, there is most likely a precise number he could put to each side but he won’t) there is no animosity in Malfoy’s gaze; he meets Harry’s wondering eyes evenly.
He’s late, as he predicted, and he sidles in as unobtrusively as he can be- or at least, he tries to.  Hermione’s in the middle of answering a question, her eyes lit with fervor, but when Slughorn catches sight of him- well.  Harry’s heart sinks.
and pins it on the notice board where clusters of eager Gryffindors soon converge, a frothing mass of excitement.  He smiles vaguely and makes his way to Transfiguration, Eilonwy Selwyn’s burning eyes fixed in his mind.
. That line is from a stray thought that does not belong to him, a thread of a tapestry that once hung on someone (
Malfoy has an odd expression on his face, something queer and fey, all the angles of his face drawing towards the center in heartbreaking desideratum.
Parseltongue, besides the obvious factor of genetics, is like any other language, so there must be a book that explains it.
“I- I’m sorry,” Harry rasps out after an age, looking everywhere but their eyes, concentrating on the freckle adjoining the hinge of Ron’s jaw, he can’t look at glittering blue or brown, so fucking familiar and strange and at once the dichotomy pains him.
used to, however, is Potter resting his chin on his hands and curving plump lips upwards, green eyes dark and utterly blank, lashes fluttering flirtatiously.
Blaise blinks, looking sheepish, and when Draco opens his eyes, his vision has returned to normal again.  “Sorry, my magical inheritance came this summer, it’s gotten a bit harder to control.”
They’re crossing staircases, down down down, and Harry feels a prickle on the leaf-line of his spine.  Someone- he whirls around, sees a second-year girl, the same wan-faced one that’d carried the note from McGonagall’s office.  Their gazes connect, and she stiffens, hands curling tightly by her sides.  The paper crinkles in her fist.
“Yes,” says Potter, like he’s guessed at Draco’s thoughts.  “That does mean exactly what you think it does.”
And, when we get to the next chapter, we'll start to see some major canon divergence.  This fic isn't about taking down Voldemort, btw.  This is a drarry fic, and the ending is ambiguous (relatively) but you can assume that Harry will eventually take down Voldemort and his horcruxes? idk it'll work out.  (or not hehe). Just! My point is that this is a story of their relationship and Harry and his Slytherin side.  There is plot, and there is a vanquished evil, but it isn't... necessarily.... Voldemort.  This is confusing, I know.  Anyway, THERE WILL BE CANON DIVERGENCE. BEEP BEEP.  CANON DIVERGENCE TRAIN, COMING THROUGH.  MAKE WAY, MAKE WAY, FOR THE SEA OF CANON DIVERGENCE, LED BY THE MERRY SHIP "JOANNE'S A BITCH". (God, that didn't even make sense in my head)
p.s. sorry for the jesus-christ-is-it-really-that-fucking-long Note in the beginning.  As I've said, I... I don't handle temptation well.  And his psychological issues needed explaining.
He finds two suitable books on Parseltongue in Borgin and Burke’s and pays for them under the guise of buying books on rare poisons.

.  He’d been possessing her, you see, using her body to open the Chamber and petrify people.  She’d tried to throw away his diary, but she stole it back again- she’d poured out her soul to him, and the manipulative disgusting bastard that he was, he’d pretended to be so

Harry tears away from Malfoy, gasping- shaking.  Shuddering with want and sickness in equal measure- he is
Draco Malfoy is not James Potter and neither is Harry; none of them are vibrant enough to play the dazzling glow of Lily Evans, even for a moment, but he can see the vague outlines and similarities and he feels a crushing, desolating, sense of despair, because this cannot be all that there is, doomed overwritten love sagas that play out across the years and kill and strangle and choke and burn out in a flood of brilliance (and take Severus with them.  When Lily Evans Potter fell, he fell with her.  If Draco Malfoy fails and dies, the Unbreakable Vow will take Severus with him.  That is his part, the terribly willing tagalong, and he plays it the only way he knows how- scornfully).
Potter’s voice is amused.  “I assure you, I’m not.  We’ll have to be quiet- Myrtle can get kind of loud.”
He thumbs the head of his cock, hissing in pleasure, and fists himself slowly, working from the root to the sensitive tip, over and over and over.
Reckon it’s about time to go back, eh?  Dumbledore’s in a right strop, and so’s Mum, although she’s more mad at Mundungus (dunno how she figures it’s his fault, maybe he was slacking off on duty again?)
Master Harry will be good for the Blacks, the Potter blood will freshen and hopefully curb some of the Black madness, the Dark Magic will be good for the world, and things will prosper and
into the Veil; how fucking stupid is that, how useless is that death?  More useless than his life, but not by much, Harry thinks cruelly.  Cruelty, it’s second nature to him these days, it’s been dealt to him so long he knows the game, knows every dash of paint on every card, knows the heft of every dice and each minute chink in the card table, knows every player and their weaknesses; his weakness is all of them and he knows how to play the game, he

(When he is finished, he has been working for a dutiful hour, grin manic and teeth sheathed in blood.  He retracts the wicked claws he has grown, the sharpness of his teeth, cools the anger that is sated, barely.  The Muggle scum is a bleeding shredded mess of clarified fat on the rugged carpet.  Kreacher takes his leave.)
“Draco,” the Dark Lord hisses, and Draco kneels smoothly, eyes trained respectfully on the panels of
Harry completes the Ancient Runes worksheet easily- there’s a few he doesn’t recognize, because he’s learnt the Dark and intensely practical runes for his blood-work and the nuances of practitioner and student do not always collimate successfully, but he’s fairly certain that he’ll be accepted into at least the fifth year class- actually, he hopes he will, because Luna will be there and Hermione won’t be.
There’s a moment of silence, and then he hears tired hoots and hollers, smiles and promises.  Back-claps.  He sees Ron in the corner of his periphery, moving towards him, and Harry casts a few quick Cleaning Charms all over himself, ridding his skin of sweat and odor.  He doesn’t have to shower here, he’ll just- he’ll just-
“It is almost being time, Master Potter!” An elf squeaks, and Harry gets up, hurriedly sweeping crumbs off his lap and attempting to clean up after himself- the elves flood around him and rid the mess with a few brisk snaps.
War’s ugly.  Draco knows, he knows, but he doesn’t have much of a choice.  War’s ugly, but it’s coming.
It’s a shame, really- she’s clever and talented, she has control and precision, but she keeps herself so firmly in place, she knows nothing about rituals and blood and power.
Harry slips out of his shirt, the thin cotton twisting between his fingers, and observes the bruises on his body.  Not above the shirt, never above the shirt, no one can know.
Yes, he knows.  She used to seek him out. When the cloying embrace of suburbia was too much for her, when she’d had enough of the narrowed eyes and cat-like hisses of her bony sister, she used to knock at his door and together they would escape like two lost children, two runaways, sheltering in the dwelling green glow of glen and fen and woodland, skipping stones and wishing on clouds because the stars were fogged by the thick smog of humanity’s exhaust.
“You’re an actual fucking disaster.” Draco concludes after several moments of introspection.  Potter looks delighted by this.  “A bloody danger magnet. How in Circe’s name do you manage to
Professor Babbling is a competent, if slightly scatterbrained, professor with peculiar violet eyes and mousy brown hair.  She grades his work, mumbling under her breath absently about runes, and clears him for taking class with the sixth years.
In which Draco Malfoy shakes (the pain, the bruises. inky and violet, violent, across his ribs. when?).  In which Draco Malfoy observes.  In which Draco Malfoy
Slowly, a white bicuspid tugging at his red mouth, Potter twists his wrist with a surprising amount of grace.  Not elegance, never elegance, but a certain arresting, figuring, power that is born from duels and battles rather than dances and ballrooms.
The motion- running a hand through windswept hair - brings to mind his father- his - James.  Harry is nothing like him and he has never been so terribly, utterly, aware of this fact, like looking straight into the glaringly obvious prism of reflection.  James, ineffable and affable, the popular beyond belief Gryffindor king, bully and heartbreaker in equal measure- no, Harry isn’t like that, despite looking like a near picture-perfect carbon copy of him, exterior-wise.
Harry’s breathing too hard, panting and digging his nails into his palms; he takes a deep breath.  Blood is dripping from his nails.
When he’s at Privet Drive, he gets angry too often, he feels surges of resentment towards Ron, tidal waves of hatred towards Dumbledore.  (Ron doesn’t
It’s disgusting.  He can’t- Hogwarts is his home for nine months of the year, and now he is tasked with bringing murder and torture to its bright secrets and serpentine, twisting, hallways.
- and instead, he flips open the book.  The previous owner’d drawn all over it, and once Harry stops feeling irritated and starts actually reading the doodles, he realizes that they’re quite helpful, actually. He follows the instructions, mind fluttered somewhere far off, fingers moving in practiced mechanic, glancing down every so often to check the book- or, rather, the book’s vandaliser.
, they insist, and so they have to conduct their holy rites under the cover of the night, have to celebrate Beltane with a wary eye on the shadows.
Harry curls up late at night, petting Hedwig absentmindedly.  She coos softly, nipping at the skin of Harry’s wrist with the brassy sharpness of her beak. A drop of blood.  (Harry heals it with a murmured
The next day dawns summer-bright and early, and Harry Apparates (he’d enlisted Kreacher to teach him Apparition and it’s one of the best decisions he’s ever made- house elves can Apparate
Harry has always followed his instincts.  Aside from that one notable Quirrel/Snape mixup, he’s usually right.  Something about being born for a war, born for a prophecy, groomed from the age of eleven and attacked constantly makes for very good instincts; Harry would’ve been dead by far if he didn’t listen to them.  And there’s something about Eilonwy Selwyn that draws him, something strange in her large, unfathomable, eyes.
It stings, a low burning hum, but he is no stranger to pain.  (Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Lucius- long pale hair and a faint smile.)
Harry ducks his head, slings his bag over his shoulder, and disperses in the vivid blackness of five o’clock, Scotland.
Or, no.  That’s a lie- he’s looking forward to Hogwarts, to the castle and the magic and the wonder of it all (it never, ever, gets old) but he isn’t looking forward to seeing Albus
“Okay.” Draco says, faintly.  “Right.” The Dark Lord was once called ‘Tom’, Potter slayed a basilisk with Gryffindor’s Sword while Voldemort played cheerleader in the background, and Potter is apparently familiar with the Dark Arts.  He’s already had a few shocks to the system; what’s one more?
“Professor,” Harry says, suddenly, “D’you think I might be able to take Ancient Runes instead of Divination?”
is nothing, not positive, not negative, only a clear, ringing, zero; air so clear, so unclouded, you could see the heartbeat of a sparrow from miles away, thrumming and fluttering.
Some of that was for him once, the piceous, piteous, boy with all the blackness of a crow, some of that light and unbearable veracity was for him, a small shard of glowing light imparted holier than the rest.
She’s furious, but there’s not exactly anything she can do.  He has Pansy’s soft stroking hands on his scalp, Blaise’s dry wit and quiet comfort.
Harry closes his eyes, running a absent hand over the wet, prickling, grass.  “Kreacher,” Harry utters tonelessly.
An O for Transfig and Care, E’s for Potions and Herbology… he’d failed Divination, obviously, and Astronomy was a bust, given the business with Hagrid…
.  (Yes, 'Hogwarts Harry' is in almost constant danger, too, but I'll go out on a limb here and say that flying away from dragons is more enjoyable than getting beaten and starved.)  'Summer Harry' is much more willing to do anything in order to be safe.
So, because Harry's been abused and basically has developed a second personality to deal with his trauma, (wait, scratch that- his ~original~ personality is what's dealing with it- the blank, unemotive, survivor.  the happy, adventurous, boy is the second personality.  okay, continue) one might wonder as to his mental walls, i.e. his Occlumency skills.  Well, suffice it to say- Harry indeed has some good fucking Occlumency walls, although they aren't Draco-level (let alone
Harry stares at it, in silence for a few moments.   Acid Pops- the password, obviously. If he were different, Harry can imagine sneaking out to Hogsmeade to buy Acid Pops and giving one to the Headmaster just for the twinkle of his blue eyes and the

Draco tells her, and she consents, albeit rather grumpily.  It’ll be hard to hide, Draco thinks- her scales are an iridescent blue; she is sleek and whip-like.

Memory comes to him, color bleeding through the dark.  That day he’d been excited, unable to stop prattling on until Pansy’d wacked him across the bum with a textbook (an ordinary one, thank Merlin, he still has nightmares about The Monster Book Of Monsters and if it had bit his
When I graduate, Harry tells himself, I will embark on an enormously, embarrassingly, long trip spanning the entirety of the magical world.

projecting the time in front of him.  He’s not late, but he’ll miss breakfast if he lingers for too long.
, the tight grasp of her arms, nubbly Weasley sweater dragging against his robes, the itchy cough of wool conjuring images of Petunia’s rug and a face purple with mad, lustful, self-importance and- and he-
(also also, i have discovered a lovely theme song for this fic: Bad People by Lauren Aquilina.  listen to it, you won't regret it.)
There is a written language, Parselscript, which is full of curves and sinuous accents; he studies the alphabet furiously and manages to memorize it in two days.  Spells incanted in Parseltongue are more powerful; words spoken in Parseltongue are generally more truthful (snakes don’t lie, after all, and Parseltongue functions like a low-grade Veritaserum.  Draco resolves to practice lying in it as soon as he can; he can’t afford not to).
Vernon is getting hungry again; Petunia is going away for a week to see an old friend and Dudley is hardly ever in the house anymore.  He’s been relying on the locks on his door but Vernon could break down the door easily and it’s for that reason that Harry’s erected rudimentary blood wards around his room.
, sometimes.  Yes, they are sharp and cruel, but they do nothing the world hasn’t done to them already, and people are so fucking
But Vernon Dursley takes it away at Platform 9 and 3/4 every summer, ever since his one and only attempt last year, when he’d transfigured a random stick into a wand and slipped his real wand into his waistband.  He’d had them at his mercy for two delicious hours, before Dumbledore had shown up, blue eyes twinkling in a disappointed manner, telling Harry that he was
Let's take a moment to talk about Harry's skills.  So, as we can see, he has indeed ventured into the ~Dark Arts~ as a method of self-defense, given that the ~Light~ shit is just not cutting it.  (Draco is actually wrong to say that Harry doesn't know Parselmagic- the thing is that Harry does know it, and is indeed practiced in it, given that Parselmagic doesn't have as much need for a wand b/c it's inherently more powerful, but he doesn't use it or have a snake familiar because he doesn't want to freak out his utterly Gryffindorish 'Light' friends.) Also, boy's putting up some kinda powerful blood wards.  Needless to say, this ain't your regular mediocre Harry.  He does still get average good-ish grades, but this is for one reason and one reason only: Aunt Petunia used to scream at him for getting better marks than Dudley.  It's common practice for him to learn and study very hard, consuming all the material and mastering the subject (because, as he knows, knowledge is needed to survive and he never knows when he'll be in danger), and then, when it comes time to present all his mastery , he just.... doesn't.
Remembering those dulled eyes (call him naive but he’d seen those eyes as a sort of Promethean Fire, indomitable and forever lit), the cadaverous pale of his skin, the terribly visible tremble of his hands where they curled by his sides- it sends shivers through him still.
Potter snorts, turning sideways to fix one luminous eye on him.  Draco’s heart, encased in the stentorian curves of his ribs and several pounds of perpetually bruised flesh, most definitely does not stutter.
Saorise hisses again, nuzzling worriedly against his skin.  He forgets her breed, it is something intelligent and venomous and loyal as Muggle snakes are not; magic doesn’t fix everything but it fixes a lot.
(Inside him, though, something shakes awake, loose coils scraping against its stone confines, shedding flurries of sparks like flint against steel.
Harry shakes out the silvery cloth, light scatting showily across the stone bilge of the walls, flings it over the two of them- Malfoy’s warm breath in the moist enclosure of anonymity - and tugs Malfoy towards the bathroom.
Harry announces him as Keeper.  “Congratulations.” Harry says, quietly, when Ron approaches him, and then he’s snarling
Harry had scrambled away as soon as he relented, face crimson and nausea swirling in him, banging his knees several times on the way to the toilet (he’d vomited for what felt like hours, coughing up bile and stomach acid, the feeling of Vernon’s sweat smearing on his skin), disbelief and shock and horror and mortification tight in his chest.
Harry runs, panting, and then he’s at Snape’s door, hurling himself against it and knocking, frantically.  “Help,” He gasps, mind gone senseless with terror, even Voldemort hasn’t inspired this much fear in him, there’s something dark in the corridors, something
Harry tilts his chin, rests it on upturned palms, the picture of innocence.  He smiles beatifically at Malfoy, making no attempt to disguise the hollowness in his eyes, and- Merlin - Malfoy
(Exhaust, he thinks.  He’s exhausted.  He’s never liked children. He loathes them, actually; in every one of their cocksure smirks he sees James Potter and Sirius Black, in every one of their idolizing gazes he sees Peter Pettigrew, in every one of their stuttering cowardliness he sees Remus Lupin and the yellow seething eyes at the end of the tunnel, roaring for blood denied and fought for, in every radiant beam he sees Lily Evans, before she was polluted by the besotted cloying arrogance of Potter, and it is exhausting.  He has had enough of his past, had enough of remembrances, had enough of figurines that moved in predetermined pathways across the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, had enough.  His life is a tragedy in its emptiness.  There is nothing here to give light, has never been for over two decades, and he looks at his students with the cold pitiless eyes of a crow and carves his mark on them with his hooked nose and yellow-stained fingers and uncaring brilliance.)
Harry chuckles faintly, more out of reflex than humor, and Vanishes a section of the glass.  She slithers through immediately, curling around his neck and shoulders and trailing down his arms.  Harry pays for her, ignoring the shop owner’s befuddled warnings about her high venom levels and being

Talk drifts to different subjects and Draco closes his eyes again, sinking into Pansy’s lap and the soft soothing feeling of her nails against his scalp.
Not a Crucio, but the bruise is spreading somehow.  What had been barely a few inches in diameter is steadily widening, covering more than half his ribcage.  Cursed silver, most likely, but his father’s never hit him with that side of the cane before.  Draco wonders what he did wrong, wonders if he deserved it, wonders if anyone does.
There is something he hasn’t felt in months and doesn’t care to identify at the moment running in him, a reckless Gryffindor’s veins; Harry blows Malfoy a kiss.
, because how fucking stupid did he have to be- it was the Parseltongue, he knows, Circe, if he hadn’t had such ironclad control of himself he might have pressed Potter against the nearest surface when hearing him speak it, too.  But then the desire had faded and Potter had realized who, exactly, he was kissing, and the want in him had distilled into horror, plain and simple.
Practice is godawful, with two of his favorite Weasleys on the team- Ron and Ginny - and Hermione in the stands and really, can this day get any worse?
God, they’re awful.  He doesn’t even know what he should have expected, but the team he’d been on had been perfect, moving in unison like a well-oiled machine.  Years of practice and drills, he can only imagine.  He’d been a wee first year when he’d joined, after all, his perception limited to the narrow scope of hero-worship.
He remembers how life feels when you have nothing to live for, when you are eking out an existence solitarily simply for the sake and knowledge that you will someday rise high, higher, highest.
“Things,” Harry says, weary.  “Things happened and I-” Harry cuts himself off, biting his lip.  “I’m dealing with it.” Harry finishes.
And then she’s lunging over the gaps of the beanbags- he backs away, shrinking against the cushion - and gripping him in her arms, and it’s as if touch is the catalyst to bring his wavering, pitiful, house of cards that could only ever be a house and not a
“Could I take an evaluation?” Harry asks, a tad desperate, and McGonagall, looking supremely wary, acquiesces, withdrawing a monumental quantity of paperwork and sliding a few sheaves of Ancient Runes work over the slick surface of her desk with the point of a handsome eagle-feather quill.
3. We will soon enter Harry's POV.  (Right now he's seeming like a bit of a moronic jock-stereotype and I promise it isn't that- remember, Harry was abused, too, even if his abuse was different from Draco's.  He was starved, beaten, assaulted; Draco was beaten and tortured à la
” He raises his voice, and the bluish sheen to Potter’s eyes recedes slightly, lingering at the corners of his cornea.  He blinks slowly, the long feathery spikes of his lashes brushing his skin, like he’s coming out of a dream.
Draco finds communicating with Saorise fairly easy- he still can’t help the rush of disbelieving excitement whenever he talks to her - but that’s because he’s
He hands the letters to Ulysses, watching as his owl carries them away, and feels lighter than he has in days.
“You expect me to believe,” Draco says, flatly, “That you fought off Slytherin’s Basilisk with Gryffindor’s Sword in Merlin’s underpants and Morgana knighted you after the event?”
, but there’s a voice like Vernon in his head, and the memories of a puce face and disgusting wetness and sickening, terrible, pain, and Draco’s stroking down his navel and he- can’t.
There’s a speech, and the Sorting, and Harry plays a wizarding version of noughts and crosses with Luna, erasing the evidence with a wave of his hand when the plates appear, food-laden and steaming, in front of them.  Harry selects a velvety pumpkin soup and digs in.
He memorizes Dark curses, spells for expelling entrails, spells for leaving the victim drowning in their own blood.  When he coughs, he half-expects to leave Darkness behind.
Noteworthy: Draco isn’t used to seeing Harry Potter weak.  Oh, Potter, face slicked in grime, blood, sweat, various indeterminable fluids - those great, terrible, eyes glowing with inextinguishable viridescence- that is familiar.
Kreacher nods jerkily, a bony hand gripping his elbow; there’s an awful, twisting sensation not unlike a Portkey and then they’re in the entranceway of Grimmauld Place, and Harry feels so utterly empty and there’s a deep ache in his bones but he needs to do this one thing first.
Potter turns, the juncture of his neck and shoulder fluid and clean, something animalistic in the smooth cant of his movements.  A flash of green irises, a slice of a challenge, and then he’s leaping through the slide like he’s done this in his sleep, like it’s a matter of routine.  It probably is. Circe knows if Draco had access to the Chamber of Secrets, he would-
When he is trembling all over, muscles exhausted and quivering, he fills two sheaves of parchment with Dark curses that he should know.  He doesn’t even know what for, but he knows that he will not be that helpless again.
I must ask you again, quite strongly, to please write back and allow me to escort you home.  Are you at Grimmauld Place?  We do need it for Order headquarters, I’m afraid.  Or is it that rather rude house-elf, Kreacher, who is blocking the wards?  Do forgive me, I sometimes tend to think out loud.  Now, onto the matter at hand: we need you to return.  Britain needs you to remain safe, Harry.
It takes three weeks for Dumbledore’s owls to get past the wards, and Hedwig makes her displeasure known.  Harry
He repeats it, facing east, south, and west, respectively.  The Magic is alive now, sharp and interested and alert.
What could I be? Harry thinks as he trips artlessly on the rounded stones of Hogwarts. Is this how Luna feels, traipsing merrily along with her loose, shining hair swaying in rivulets of white-gold (
Afterwards, the house elves clear the dishes with snaps of their fingers and Draco is dismissed.  Heart beating fast, he slips into the library and loses himself in old grimoires, searching for that countercurse.
.  She might’ve been in love with him, she might have just wanted a listening ear.” Potter’s breath catches as he inhales, he’s shaking subtly.  Whatever comes up next, it’s of grave import.  Draco leans forward.
Draco makes a frustrated noise, slides his hands around to grip the nape of Potter’s neck, and seeks out Potter’s mouth with his own, fitting their lips together and swallowing Potter’s surprised gasp.
Harry knows better.  It’s humanity, that sick bright flame, that fever-shine of twisted light, that burning, fervid, passion behind the arc of a knife, the force of a fist, sharp hungry teeth.
While he is, he contemplates the problem that is avoiding his two very best friends, who constitute basically his entire social circle.
. First of all, slut-shaming is disgusting and cruel, and second of all, as fic writers, ideally our aim should be to write enjoyable work, and not.... I dunno, bigoted and gruesome manifestos? Just putting it out there! :)
“Now, onto the next matter,  I have a task for you, Draco.”  Voldemort smiles, his red eyes very bright.  Draco wants to run and hide, wants to crawl into the safety of his mind behind his impenetrable walls.  He can’t.
