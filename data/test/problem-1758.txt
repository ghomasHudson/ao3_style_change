Draco felt he was punch-drunk on happiness and adrenaline. He couldn't remember having laughed this hard or for this long any time in the past several years, and yet after leaving the bookshop he and Harry hadn't stopped giggling like schoolchildren until they were two streets away. They walked aimlessly, paying no heed to where they went, until Draco absently checked his phone and was floored to realize it was already time for him to get to class.
“Draco, you’ve always been a bit of a prat but your grades have never slipped and you’re well-liked within your house. I think your father is proud of you and all that you’ve achieved. The Ministry has been quite busy this year so I’m not surprised that he would be stressed. He might grow distant but he won’t love you any less.” Harry planted a soft kiss on Draco’s temple, pulling his arm above the water and running his fingertips over the pink scars. “Is that why you did this? The feeling of not being enough?”

“Wouldn’t dream of it, although, I might need to tell Mione if you don't,” Ron said softly, smiling at his friend.
bathroom?” Draco raised an eyebrow at the unfamiliar ghost.
“Oh, calm your snitch, Potter,” Draco replied, sliding down his trousers to reveal the swim trunks underneath. “We’re not there just yet.”
Draco made his way over to Harry, hooking his finger under the golden chain around his neck. “I didn’t think you’d wear it.”
“Took me a bit, but I managed to get it before the end of the lesson.” Ron beamed. He’s always had trouble in charms and was happy to succeed.
“Well, I don’t know. Anything.” Draco moved his hand to the small of Harry’s back, pulling him even closer. Harry’s eyes flicked down to Draco’s lips as he talked, feeling his partner’s heartbeat in time with his.
“If you must.”
Harry didn’t say anything but nodded, moving his hand from Draco’s waist and onto his shoulder. Draco did the same, making sure there was enough space to adjust his grip on Harry’s waist if he needed to.
“Then talk to me.” Draco said simply, also moving closer to Harry.
“Yes, Harry, I’m fully aware. Do you want to improve or not?”
“It’s only awkward if you make it. See, you’re looking at me right now.” Draco spoke softly, searching Harry’s emerald eyes despite knowing exactly how he felt. Both of them could feel the softly bubbling pool, giving off steam and a soft scent of lavender, so warm, so inviting. It’s okay to climb in, right?
The two boys sat in silence before Draco piped up again.
“That’s
Warning: This chapter mentions self-harm.
“Good, you’re back. We need to talk.” Harry was immediately ambushed by Hermione the moment he entered the common room, the girl dragging him over to the table when Ron waited for them. Hermione pushed Harry into the chair before walking over to her own. “Talk”
“No, don’t worry about it.” Harry shook his head, unable to meet Draco’s eyes. “I shouldn’t be complaining. They’ve given me a roof over my head, a bed to sleep in, taught me how to cook and clean. Some people have it worse than me.”
Draco softly reached his fingers up to his lips that still tingled despite the loss of contact. “Harry-”
The door to the bathroom slid open, revealing a grand, spacious room of beautiful white marble and white linen curtains. In the centre of the room was a glorious candle-lit chandelier, illuminating the large, swimming pool-like bathtub below. The tub itself was sunk into the floor, lined with various gold faucets, each encrusted with a gemstone of some kind. Maybe bringing Draco here was a bad idea.
into Draco’s touch, unsure if they were still moving.
“It’s going to be fine, My uncle and aunt have been getting better with each year and my cousin punches me less.”
“Well, defeated Voldemort twice, killed a basilisk, freed a wanted criminal. I don’t even think that’s the end of the list.” Harry replied. Draco’s eyes widened in shock.
“What did they do to you?”
“I spend half of the summer with Ron and his family anyway, so you won’t have to wait long before you can owl me.”
be hiding in the darkness that causes fear.” Harry replied, wondering where this conversation was going.
Remember to like and Kudos if you enjoyed, I always read your lovely comments.
“It was a kind gift. Why wouldn’t I wear it?” Harry responded, stepping into the tub only to be swallowed by water and bubbles. Draco followed suit, although with a bit more grace, enjoying the warmth of the water surrounding him.
Harry had eventually learned the truth of Moody’s true identity and how his name ended up in the cup and the last day was a sombre one, a vigil held in Cedric Diggory’s honour.
“Hm, so grumpy. You could give Professor McGonagall a run for her money.” Harry replied, following Draco’s instructions. He started moving slowly, remembering when to turn despite his off timing. Music suddenly filled the room, Harry secretly glad that they always met in the Room of Requirement.
” Harry, fueled by anger and his overwhelming need to punch Malfoy cast the spell. A jet of silver shot off the tip of his wand and around Malfoy’s wrist, but nothing happened. Harry sat back in his seat, blood boiling because in trying to prove Malfoy wrong, he messed up the spell completely.
“And what would we do instead?” Draco asked.
Their lips moved perfectly against each other, almost as if it was meant to me. Was it the bond? Was this feeling real? None of that mattered. They soaked up the warmth the other provided, living this moment like it was their last. Draco pulled Harry flush against his chest, using his free hand to softly cradle the boy’s face. Harry felt weak when Draco traced his finger behind his ear over the spot he so very liked, lightly tugging his hair in return.
“He didn’t spend any of the summer or Christmas break with me, he’s never done that before.” Draco allowed himself to melt into Harry’s embrace, feeling the warmth and comfort the other boy provided.
“No, Professor.” The pair grumbled in unison.
“Oh, I’m so scared. Malfoy used a bad word.” Harry started taking advantage of the upper hand he suddenly had.
Harry didn’t say anything in response but rather shared a sad smile with Draco. Maybe, just maybe, things might turn out okay.
“Good morning everyone, glad to see you’ve all found your assigned partners.” Professor Flitwick took his spot at the font of the class, waiting for the students to settle before he continued. “Today we’ll be learning a simple, but useful spell. It is a Rope Binding spell, often used as a means to ensure not losing someone in a crowd or by Aurors when making arrests. Now, I want to picture what you want this rope to bind to, in this case it will be your partner’s wrist. Once you have that image in your head I want you to aim your wand at your partner’s wrist and use the incantation

“Draco, you’re taller than me.”
“But that can’t be good for you.”
“Sorry, it slipped my mind,” Harry replied, tucking his invisibility cloak and golden egg under his arm. The boys hadn’t seen each other since the encounter in the cupboard, they had been so wrapped up in everything else in their lives that they haven’t had the chance.
“Yes, I guess you’re right. I see things differently, the sun and moon chasing each other not in a game of cat and mouse but rather seeking the other’s company.” Luna took her silver eyes from the sky and looked at Harry. “The day and the night miss each other and that is why the sunrises and sunsets are so beautiful. It’s the few moments during the day where the two lovers are reunited, their love and joy painting the skys. The day is blue and the night is dark because that’s how the lovers feel when they are torn apart.”
“Where were you?” Hermione asked, cutting right to the chase.
“Would you two shut the hell up?!” Ron not-so-kindly told the pair on the other side of the room, who were now quietly hatching a plan to find the brave soul that took Harry Potter off the market.
“But you’re
“What are you going to do? Tickle torture? You know nothing will work, right?” Draco replied, almost laughing at the absurd face Harry made.
“You wish.”
“Draco, you’re avoiding the question.” Harry softly turned Draco’s face to meet his own, green and grey meeting in a way that sent sparks flying through their veins. “Did you hurt yourself because you felt that you weren’t enough?”
something that Harry wasn’t telling him. Harry’s scared to tell Draco that Hermione knows about their bond, he didn’t want to hurt and lose him again. He’s scared of what would happen if Draco became upset and angry with him.
“Please tell me you brought swim trunks,” Draco said, also mirroring Harry’s actions.
“Because it’s not every day that you catch Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy sneaking into the Prefects’ bathroom, you know.” Myrtle crossed her arms over her chest, grumbling at the two boys.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry replied. “Pine fresh.”
Just wanted to clear this up before you dive into this chapter, everything is based on Harry's POV with the exception of the tasks, which I've written in Draco's POV since we all know what happens during the task. I wanted to story to hold the same essence as the books, so I felt this was the best way to do so. Hope this helps.
I can owl you.”
“I wish I could just take you to the Manor with me, enjoy the summer in the wizarding world for once.”
“Of course not. There’s only one brain cell between all of us and it’s mine.” Ginny replied, Luna quietly giggling beside her. Harry shook his head as he made his way back into the castle.
“I don’t see why not,” Harry replied.
“Really? You do?”
to move. You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to and you just need to look at me.”
“Wait, you know her? Like, actually know her?” Draco asked, turning to face Harry.
“I’ve dealt with worse.” Harry shrugged.
“Ron, that means that Harry will have to work with Malfoy during the next lesson.” Hermonie added.
“You didn’t do anything wrong, Draco,” Harry replied, taking one for Draco’s hands in his own. “Almost all of Ron’s brothers have achieved great things while at Hogwarts. Even though his parents love and care for him he still puts himself under stress to be like his brothers, to make his parents proud even though he doesn’t need to prove himself to them. He can be a bit of a hothead sometimes but I’ll always forgive him, it’s really not his fault.”
“Yeah, whatever. The sooner we get this done, the better.” Harry rolled his eyes, sitting next to the pesky Slytherin.
“The damned Yule Ball. I’m a hopeless dancer and I
be enough for me and our magic reflects that. We didn’t choose to become connected but we chose to understand each other.” Harry placed another kiss onto Draco’s temple, slowly running his fingers through his wet, blond locks.
“Mate, ‘Mione said you just rushed up here. Is everything okay?” Ron pulled back the covers, worried as to what could have overwhelmed his friend. He gasped, noticing the redness and slight swelling on Harry’s lips. “Please don’t tell me you weren't just doing what I thought you were doing.”
“What did they do to you?” Draco asked softly. “Please, Harry. You can’t keep pushing me away.”
Harry caught on easily, and he pulled back to look at Draco with furrowed brows and concern in his eyes. "Did I go too fast?" he asked. Nothing but sincerity colored his tone, and Draco felt even worse knowing that Harry was likely blaming himself for Draco's regression to his previous ways.
“I would like the same,” Draco said faintly. “No more secrets, I swear.”
Several things happened at once. By Draco's side, Harry stiffened with a sharp intake of breath and clutched so tightly at Draco's hand, he would not have been surprised to find mild bruises forming later that evening. The girl's companion exclaimed, "Oh my god, Lavender! You can't say things like that!" All conversation in the cafe drew to a close as the patrons zeroed in on Draco and Harry's linked hands, and though most turned away immediately, clearly disinterested, a few gawked openly, only adding to the overall tension of the situation. The sudden silence that permeated the atmosphere was disturbed only by the loud, out-of-place whirring of machinery from the back.
Draco gave a half-shrug. “It doesn’t matter what I would be okay with. That’s my cross to bear, and my consequences to make peace with.” He affected nonchalance, but his mind was racing. For all his angry declarations, Harry hadn’t stormed out yet. What did he have left to say? Was it possible Harry didn’t
He couldn’t stop replaying the scene over and over in his head, wondering whether it had actually happened or whether he had hallucinated the whole encounter. Draco had associated the Mark with violence so intimately, and for so long, that he couldn’t understand how it didn’t carry the same connotations for others. Even if they were ignorant as to what the Mark stood for, didn’t it look menacing? Unhinged? A serpent extending from the empty mouth of a hyperrealistic skull wasn’t a particularly pleasant image.
They were only meters from escaping when Lucius gathered his wits about him enough to shout, “There’s no coming back from this, Draco! If you choose that mongrel over your own father, your own blood, I swear I will consider you dead.”
"No one knows the real me, Potter," Draco said emotionlessly.
“Draco?” Harry asked frantically, his voice loud, as though he’d tried to catch Draco’s attention several times already.
What had he been thinking, making such a reckless decision as this? There was no way this relationship could work out for him. In fact, the past had systematically proven to him that selfish indulgences could only result in heartbreak. There was no reason to suspect Harry was any different. Just this morning, Draco had been warning Harry not to go out with such a broken man as Draco, and just last night, Draco had had a vivid reminder of why his fears were legitimate. How had he forgotten all of this so quickly?
"Oh, him," Draco said, feigning remembrance. He pointed in the direction of a random bookshelf. "I think he was headed that way." The girls thanked him hastily and sped off. Draco kept his eyes on them, waiting for them to realize the man they were looking or was nowhere to be found.
The walk to the canteen was an awkward one, as neither male knew how to strike up a conversation. But luckily, once they arrived at their destination, the warm atmosphere dispelled the tension between them.
The assessment was not overly inaccurate. On each of the rare occasions they had met, Weasley had made a point to impress upon Draco the severity of the consequences he would face if he broke Harry's heart. Weasley's overprotective behavior would have been endearing, in much the same way a precocious toddler was endearing, had Draco not found it so immensely irritating already.
That last thought hit him like a freight train, punching the breath out of his lungs. He still couldn’t believe Harry was no longer a part of his life. And it had been his fault. As always, he had hidden away in fear, and his fear had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Sitting as far from the exit as he was, Draco couldn’t beat the crowd of students out the door when lecture ended. He was jostled about by the throng, all equally as eager to leave as he was, and it was all he could do to keep pushing forward. As he finally managed to pass through the door, a student bumped him rather forcefully from behind, causing him to throw out both his arms in an effort to regain his balance and prevent himself from sprawling face first into a wall.
He forced himself to pull away finally, his work ethic taking precedence over his burgeoning feelings for Harry. "I'll text you," he said.
"I much prefer spending time with you to that," Harry remarked, and Draco rolled his eyes in response.
So why was he letting the Mark—and, by proxy, his past—dictate the way he lived? Why had he let himself be ruled by fear?
, not when he was young and foolish, and certainly not now despite his older age and increased maturity. He had almost come to expect the unexpected, to as much of an extent as the unexpected could be expected, and he made it a point to no longer let it faze him. So when a month after their chance encounter, he received a call from the front desk stating that a boy named Harry Potter was asking for Draco to buzz him in, Draco simply released a long-suffering sigh and accepted his fate.
Nonetheless, even in the privacy of his own room, Draco couldn’t quell the anxiety buzzing beneath his skin. His eyes drifted towards the window above his desk almost obsessively, though whether he was hoping to catch one of Yaxley’s henchmen in the act or to reassure himself there was no one there, Draco didn’t know.
Draco left his Mark bare as he made his way to Harry’s flat. The sight of it still threatened to send him spiraling into anxiety, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe seeing Draco’s bare arm would convince Harry that Draco’s apology was sincere, and that he was willing to put in the effort to come to terms with his past.
He only realized his mistake when he sunk into his customary seat near the front of the lecture hall and draped his coat over the back of his chair, exposing his arms in the process. His
Even as he agonized over the consequences of this decision, his phone buzzed with a text. Draco glanced at it, his heart rate speeding up when he saw it was from Harry. He unlocked his phone to find a short and sweet "can't wait to see you again" waiting for him.
When they entered Draco’s room, Draco gestured vaguely to his couch before moving to place the pistol on his desk. He stood still for a moment, mesmerized by the glinting gunmetal. Then he shook himself out of his reverie, filled an empty glass with water, and passed it to Harry where he had curled up on the couch, all the while trying to ignore the way his hands were trembling. Harry accepted the water with a brief nod and a stony expression.
Draco's mouth went dry. He had steadily grown more willing to come out to his and Harry's friends, even if he wasn't entirely comfortable, since he at least knew they would be supportive. But the thought of announcing his sexual preferences to a group of virtual strangers was enough to give him heart palpitations. He would never be able to maintain control in a situation that unpredictable and potentially volatile.
Draco said nothing, sifting through Potter's words and formulating a reply. Potter apparently took his silence for rejection, for he stood up with a sad smile. "Look, I get it. If you don't want to get out with me, I won't bug you again. I just thought it was worth a try." He hesitated a moment longer, and then turned around to walk away.
“Looking for someone?” Yaxley asked, his thin lips stretched into a smug smirk.
Perhaps sensing the tension thrumming through Draco's body, or perhaps simply seeing his expression, Harry stilled. "We don't have to," he said quietly, as he had on each of the previous occasions they had reached this point. He began rolling the shirt back down Draco's torso even as he spoke, already anticipating Draco's answer.
“No!” cried Draco. He rushed forward, but the sound of several Death Eaters drawing their own weapons stopped him. He looked toward them and was unsurprised to find three separate guns pointed directly at him.
But he had been backed into a corner now, and there was nothing he could do but wait for the other shoe to drop. Yaxley had the advantage here, even without the power of Lucius on his side. The Death Eaters were more likely to give their loyalty to a man who wore his Mark as a badge of honor than a man who had turned tail and run the moment he turned eighteen. The lack of follow-through on Yaxley’s threats might speak to the weakness of Yaxley’s bluff, but his prolonged silence might also be an omen of more sinister things to come.
Wow, this chapter got...kind of out of hand, lol. It also took me 6 months to write. I'm really sorry for the delay, and I hope the length of this chapter makes up for it!
“If they’re friends, Master, they’re like no friends I’ve ever seen,” Yaxley replied with obvious relish. Draco wanted nothing more than to take a pair of brass knuckles to the older man’s torso, even as the sense memory of flesh tearing under metal brought bile rushing back up his throat. “Had their hands and mouths all over each other.”
Harry nodded.
Draco took a breath to calm himself, glad that he had positioned himself so that Yaxley couldn't see how shaken he was. He needed to convince Yaxley of his conviction if he wanted to keep the upper hand in this already-tenuous conversation. "I don't owe you any justifications, Yaxley," Draco said. "Tell Father to come collect me himself, if he truly desires me to return. He must be losing his touch if he thinks I'll view this treatment as anything but an insult."
“But not now. And not soon,” Harry concluded. “You wouldn’t have said anything until you’d run yourself ragged trying to achieve whatever outcome you’re holding out for, would you?”
“Don’t flatter yourself, Potter,” Draco muttered, his own cheeks pink too. “I was asleep.”
wash it!” Harry retorted, turning to face Draco, eyes flashing with anger.
“So her loss is everyone else’s gain?” Draco asked, quirking an eyebrow.
“I don’t see your name on it!”
“At thirteen? No,” Harry flushed. “I didn’t know I liked boys back then.”
When they finally broke apart, flushed and out of breath and weak with exhilaration, all they could do is laugh at first.
They managed to make it through their respective hygiene routines with only one brief separation — after twenty minutes of watching Draco style his hair, Harry’d had enough and walked off. Draco had yelped, grabbed Harry’s wrist, and pouted the entire way to the common room.
“I can’t believe you!” Draco raised his voice as they pushed the door open. “I thought we’d got past this!”
“I never wanted to be an Auror,” he said after a long silence. The words felt like bark in his mouth, rough and honest, scratching at his voice to get out. He felt the warm heaviness of tears building up behind his eyes but there was no stopping it now. “Everyone always just assumes I’m going to be an Auror, because everyone thinks I’m a warrior. But I was never given any choice, you know? The war chose me, the war tore me away from my family, and I never got a say in any of it because if I did, if I said no, then everyone died.”
Draco snorted softly. “Potter, please,” he said. “My looks are the least of my worries. No, it’s more the marrying a girl part that’s the problem. That’s the bit I don’t want.”
Harry, peeved that Draco had won their silent walking race, pushed past him in an attempt to squeeze in the door first. Draco had other ideas, though, and shoved Harry against the doorframe. They struggled for a moment, trying to keep each other from getting into the common room, then both burst through the doorway at once in a tangle of limbs.
“Because
Pansy laughed delightedly. “I knew she would be as fed up as we are,” she said. “Tonight, then?”
Draco gasped. They were stood right in the center of a small circle, which glowed faintly gold under the white chalk. Neatly-drawn runes flowed around the outside of the shape.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked warily.
Pansy grinned. “Let’s get ready, then.”
“Whatever,” he said instead. “We’ll see you traitors in class.”
Pansy gave a groan, shook her head and looked to Hermione. “What have we done?”
By now, the handful of other patrons in the small restaurant had also begun to take notice of the situation. It was clear that the attention was unsettling for Harry, if the way he was nervously wringing his hands was any indication. "Um," Harry started, glancing helplessly at Draco. "I don't really-"
When Harry's voice cut through the silence, it was hesitant and unsteady, a sharp contrast from the determination burning in his eyes. "My parents died when I was eleven," he said. "It was a car crash. We were driving home from an audition for some children's show, I forget what it was now, when someone ran a red and barrelled into us."
"Draco Malfoy," Draco responded warily, still unsettled by how much the man had affected him. He took Harry's hand and shook it firmly, pleasantly surprised to receive a firm grip in reply.
Still, better safe than sorry. Draco forced Potter to remain still for another minute before signalling to him that the coast was clear. Potter slowly crawled out and stood. He stretched to relieve his cramped muscles and brushed off the dust his legs had collected. Draco took advantage of his obvious distraction to assess him.
's easy openness made it easy to trust him. Draco was still wary about the potential consequences that could come to pass, but for the first time, he didn't want to let those consequences hold him back.
Draco had a split second to make his decision. He could put his coat back on, but that would look even stranger, and the lecture hall was toasty besides. But leaving his coat off meant showing off the Mark to all and sundry, a circumstance he had been steadfastly avoiding all year. Was he ready to bare his heart on his sleeve—or his forearm, as it were? Of course he wasn’t; his fight with Harry last night had made that abundantly clear. But what choice did he have? The professor was already speaking, and Draco didn’t want to draw further attention to himself by making a scene.
“Wow, Potter. You’re actually more coordinated than I expected.” Draco jokenly poked at Harry.
“What could be worse than fighting the most feared wizard in history?”
Draco stood up, walking over to where Harry stood. He placed one hand on Harry’s shoulder, taking his hand in the other.
“It’s just that my Father has been so stressed this year, I feel that it’s my fault because I’m not living up to his expectations. I know he loves me but he just seems so distant. I didn’t think that Weasley would be feeling that same constant feeling of not being enough, his family left the Sacred Twenty-Eight after all.”
“But at the end of the day the moon comes back, bringing the darkness and the stars with it. Why is there fear in the night when there’s the beauty of the stars and moon to enjoy?”
“Why do you think the sun chases the moon?” Luna asked, still gazing up into the heavens.
“Look, no matter what happens with your dad from this point forward I will be there for you. You will
“I guess this is where we part,” Draco spoke first, fiddling with the hem of his robe.
“Mate, that’s rough. You’re not going to do it with Malfoy though, right?” Ron asked his friend.
“Mione spoke with me after my big fight with Ron, she knew there was something going on between us because of how I defended you.” Harry whispered, not wanting to disturb the quiet that surrounded Draco and himself. “I told her about the bond before she had the chance to milk it out of me. I can assure you that she won’t tell anyone, she values my privacy and it’s fair to assume she’ll do the same for you. She might be a teacher’s pet but she’s not a tattle-tail.”
As soon as Draco felt he could move again, he escaped into a nearby bathroom to collect himself. Though it was empty when he entered, he locked himself into one of the stalls to avoid being confronted by his reflection.
“When my parents died, my aunt and uncle got custody of me,” Harry said before Draco could break the silence with an explanation, or an apology, or anything at all. “They resented me. They had a son already: Dudley. He was about my age but twice my size, and he had just as many brain cells as letters in his name. The lot of them thought my parents were liberal embarrassments who coddled me far too much, and that I was in sore need of discipline, so in their infinite wisdom, they decided to starve the insolence out of me. I stopped acting because I was too busy trying to scrounge up dinner most nights to worry about learning lines.
"Malfoys are not cowards," he said to himself, the words an echo of a sentiment he had heard all too often when he was younger. He grimaced at the unwanted memories and pushed them back like he had been unable to do the previous night. Despite the unpleasant shudder that passed through him, however, the words had their desired effect, propelling him through his door and towards the library before he lost his courage again.
“If you’re determined to end this—to end
As he crunched through the snow, Draco felt his head droop with the weight of the thoughts buzzing through his mind. He had been so certain that he had left his past on the other side of a closing set of train doors, stranded on a platform in London while Draco fled in search of a clean start. He had managed to forget, somehow, that a life such as his was not so easily abandoned, and that the severing of those ties would leave behind a tangled web Draco would be unable to escape.
He got none of that. Instead, the students immediately shifted to pass around him, with one girl saying only, “Wicked ink, Malfoy,” before continuing on her way.
Potter released a disbelieving chuckle. "Says the man wearing a black long-sleeved shirt," he pointed out, nodding towards Draco's choice of dress. "Why the disparity?"
Draco almost didn't realize they'd already reached their destination, caught up in conversation as he was. He was strangely reluctant to let Potter leave, likely for good, but he had no reason to ask Potter to stay. "I'll see you around, then," he said politely.
Harry grinned. “Fantastic. I’ll get to see your reaction firsthand,” he said, genuine excitement coloring his voice. His happiness was infectious and Draco couldn’t help smiling a little in response. He didn’t resist as Harry pulled him to their eyesore of a tree, where a single poorly-wrapped package was nestled beneath the cheap plastic branches. “We should put some fake presents under the tree next year,” Harry mused even as he sank to the ground, dragging Draco down with him, and shoved the present into his hands.
Draco tensed, clenching his eyes shut involuntarily in an instinctive defense against sensations he had no desire to feel again. He wouldn't wish those emotions, that guilt, on his worst enemy, much less someone he could potentially grow to care for.
You don't care about that, though! So I'll save the introspective rambling for the end of the fic, once I've published the rest of it. For now, please know that there are 4 more chapters after this one, and I aim to update at least once a week (though I may update more frequently; it would be kind of cool to mark this complete before 2020 ends).
Harry released a short, explosive breath, and Draco flinched instinctively at the abrupt sound in their otherwise quiet flat. It was a subtle action, a slight tensing of his already rigid body, but he knew Harry had noticed. After a moment of silence, Harry turned and made his way into the living room, and Draco forced himself to follow. He sat on the opposite end of the couch from Harry, leaving over a foot of distance between them. His posture was stiff, his hands clasped firmly in his lap. He waited for Harry to speak.
Already the cracks were beginning to show.
Harry was silent, and Draco claimed his victory with a vicious sneer. “I’m done here. I warned you from the start. You’re the one who chose not to listen.” He spun around once more and stalked away. Harry didn’t call after him again.
Silence reigned as the two of them sat and drank, but it was a comfortable sort and not wholly unwelcome. If Draco closed his eyes, he could almost pretend that Potter wasn't actually here, and Draco had hallucinated the past few minutes. It wouldn't have been too extraordinary, considering the workload Draco had been managing recently.
Harry apparently thought so as well, since he pulled back and frowned at Draco. He seemed to take in Draco’s tired eyes and halfhearted smile for the first time, and his frown deepened. “What happened? Are you alright?” he asked.
Then Potter was gone, leaving a cold absence in his stead. Draco absently raised his hand to his lips, as though to catch the kiss Potter had just given him and keep it there, and watched Potter leave without looking back even once. There was a bounce in his step that Draco knew hadn't been there earlier. As Draco watched Potter disappear, he was left wondering, what the hell had just happened?
A soft smile stretched his lips as memories of their date flooded back to him. Once more he felt the giddiness that had been buzzing through him all morning, and he remembered exactly why he had agreed to date Harry. Harry had the ability to convince Draco that everything would work out in its own time.
Potter gave a small chuckle. "Yeah, I know, I should be ecstatic," he said. "Honestly though, it gets tiring after a while. I don't want the fame. I don't really understand why I have it to begin with. But it's a moot point either way, since I don't-don't like girls." He stared firmly at Draco, as though daring him to comment on his hesitance. But Draco noticed how his jaw clenched in fear and his shoulders tensed warily.
Harry shrugged. "You don't have anywhere to stay; I'll have the flat to myself since Ron's going home over break. It makes perfect sense."
Potter grimaced. "Alright, I might have been a child actor for a semi-popular drama that's currently all the rage with teenage girls," he allowed. "Anyway, it didn't last long, and it's not like I have any dear love of acting or its accompanying popularity. None of these girls seem to get that, though. It's annoying," he said in what sounded dangerously like a whine. He stabbed viciously at his salad.
Draco briefly glanced away from his work in irritation as a shrill scream resounded through the library, but when the commotion seemed to have no outcome, he paid it no mind and continued with his research. It was going well enough until a rugged brunette careened around the corner where Draco's worktable was located, glancing around frantically while he tried to catch his breath. Finally, his gaze settled on Draco, who had been staring rather unashamedly at the man, and he heaved a sigh of relief.
Then he froze, a jolt of panic lancing through him. What time was it? Had he overslept? He couldn’t afford to be tardy so early in the semester.
In the end, his commitment to academic success won out. He dropped his left hand into his lap and pressed his forearm against his waist. In this position, the majority of the Mark was hidden from sight, and Draco could focus on keeping the panic welling in his chest at bay.
“It’s beautiful,” Draco whispered in awe. He carefully unfolded the scarf to see it in its entirety before looping it around his neck. The scarf was warm as well as enthralling, and Draco found himself duly impressed.
But Lucius only smiled in response, and once again Draco realized he had misstepped. “So this boy can still be used as leverage. How interesting,” Lucius mused. “You ought to learn to mind your tongue, Draco.” In one fluid motion, he passed his cane to his left hand, drew his pistol, and pointed the gun at Harry’s head.
“You’re tense,” Harry murmured, pulling Draco away from his thoughts.
Still, Draco wasn't lucky enough for Harry to drop the conversation entirely. The reprieve he was granted was mournfully short, and just moments after they left the shopping center, Harry asked, "So where are you staying over break, then?"
"I was lucky," Harry breathed against Draco's lips, making him shiver involuntarily. "I survived with a broken arm, two cracked ribs, and some gashes on my legs. My parents, though…" He trailed off. Draco tilted his chin up so he could kiss Harry, trying to pour silent encouragement into the gesture. He noticed that Harry hadn't mentioned the scar on his forehead, and he took the omission to mean that Harry had acquired it elsewhere. He filed the information away absently, deciding to address it some other time.
Draco stepped out from the stall and cautiously approached one of the mirrors. Step by step, he drew closer, until his arms bumped against the porcelain lip of the sink, and he could stare directly into his own eyes. This was the first time he had faced his reflection without shying away since Christmas Eve; he looked into his eyes, his haggard face, and tried to see what others saw. What his professors saw, and his classmates—even, possibly, what Harry saw.
Within moments, Draco was walking up the stairs to the floor where he was supposed to meet Potter, buying himself some time to gather his wits by foregoing the lift. "Malfoys don't run and hide," he whispered to himself sternly, trying for the same nonchalant attitude he was known for. And really, what did it say about him that he had to talk to himself in order to prepare for a simple conversation? He didn't particularly want to know. "Malfoys take control of the situation and turn it to their advantage." The words soured his mouth, calling forth images of his father and his associates.
"Hide me, please," the man all but begged, a wild look in his eyes.
hung in the air.
"No, I'm busy tomorrow. I'm hanging out with two of my friends, Ron and Hermione," Harry explained. "Although, if you wanted to meet them, I suppose you could join us? We're just going to the pub for a few pints. I know you said you weren't ready to come out, but they're good people, I know they wouldn't say anything."
Upon confirming Lucius confirmed was still too blinded with pain to pay them any mind, Draco turned to Montague. “Cut him loose,” he said, using the pistol to gesture towards Harry. He was buzzing, every centimeter of his skin alight with fear and gunmetal, something like acid scorching his veins. Montague made quick work of the rope holding Harry immobile, and Draco traded in his pistol for Montague’s while the other man was distracted. As soon as the last of the rope fell away, Draco rushed to pull Harry out of Montague’s reach.
“So we’re even, then. We’ve beaten our dirty laundry half to death and laid our souls bare, and if I got up and left right now, you would be okay with that.” Harry said it like a challenge, his tone aggressive but no longer scornful. Tentatively, Draco turned to face him and was surprised to find Harry’s glower had been replaced by something almost resembling curiosity.
"You're gay?" Draco wondered aloud, his eyes widening in surprise.
Draco froze mid-bite, barely resisting the urge to glance at his left arm to ensure that it was still hidden. Should he tell the truth? Immediately he knew he couldn't do that. Oddly enough, he liked Potter and enjoyed his company. He couldn't bear the disgust Potter would surely feel if he knew the truth. Should he lie and say the library was cold? But he knew instinctively that Potter wouldn't appreciate deception, and regardless, he didn't want to lie to Potter anyway. What was it about the man that Draco found so compelling?
He put two underground transfers and several kilometers between himself and Yaxley before he felt safe enough to give release to the emotions warring within him. He hunched in on himself, holding his head in his hands as violent shudders ripped through his body. Though he felt his eyes water, he angrily rubbed at them until the tears disappeared, unwilling to express that much vulnerability in public.
Draco jolted awake, heart racing and sweat soaking through his clothes. He threw the covers off his body and rolled onto his side, outstretched hands groping blindly for the lamp. He finally managed to turn it on, and he examined his hands in the resulting light, fully expecting them to be soaked in the blood of innocents.
Yaxley’s smirk transformed into a scowl, his displeasure at being ignored abundantly evident. Just as during their past confrontation, though, he had no leg to stand on. Disgrace or not, runaway or not, Draco remained the son of Lucius Malfoy. “You’ll find out soon enough,” Yaxley said. He finally stepped forward, pulling the door shut behind him, and stalked past Draco while typing something on his mobile. “Come on, then,” he snarled when he noticed Draco hadn’t moved. “You should know better than to keep him waiting.”
Despite his concern and curiosity, however, Draco didn't pry. Instead, he gently guided Harry onto the tube, through campus, and into his room. He sat Harry down on the bed before turning away to fetch him a bottle of water. He perched on his desk chair, watching in silence as Harry downed the bottle in one go.
“Not yet,” Harry said after a moment. “I’ll let you have the time you want. But you’re running out of chances, Draco.”
Feeling uncomfortably guilty, Draco swallowed his own discomfort and reached out for Harry's hand as they walked towards the door. He rubbed soothing circles on Harry's skin, trying to convey a silent apology and offer some small comfort in the tense atmosphere of the cafe. Harry squeezed Draco's hand in silent acknowledgement, and to Draco's delight, he noticed that Harry was smiling slightly.
They left the shop a while later before they could be kicked out by the visibly irritated staff, who were no doubt upset the two boys were taking seats that could be occupied by paying customers instead. Laughing to themselves at the glares they were receiving, they fled to a nearby bookstore for lack of anything better to do.
Despite the chilly morning weather, Harry dragged Draco to a quaint ice cream shop several minutes away from campus. Eyeing Harry's thin tshirt with amusement, Draco spared a moment to be grateful for his own long sleeves that now served as a line of defense against the freezing interior of the shop.
"Slipped back around the corner the moment you two left," he said breezily as the two girls neared his desk. They nodded wordlessly and left the way they'd came, hopefully for good.
When Harry said nothing more, Draco asked the question that had been plaguing him all evening. "Why didn't you keep acting?" he asked, his voice breathy as Harry continued pressing kisses in a trail down his collarbone. "Did you really hate it that much?"
To his chagrin, Draco found himself inexplicably drawn to the horribly cliched Christmas films that seemed to air without pause as the holiday drew ever near. He forced Harry to watch as many of the cringeworthy films as they could stomach. More often than not, their impromptu movie marathons turned into drinking games that ended with the two laughing too loudly and snogging sloppily, the films continuing to play unheeded in the background.
Potter cleared his throat then, a small and unobtrusive noise that nonetheless shattered the illusion immediately. As much as Draco would prefer to pretend this wasn't really happening, he knew he had to speak to Potter eventually.
They considered hitting up the post-Christmas sales that afternoon before the shelves were ravaged by determined shoppers, but Harry claimed he was too tired and cold from having just returned. They ordered takeout and cuddled up on the couch instead, putting on some comedy on Netflix that had them both in stitches. They relocated to the bedroom when it started to grow dark, where they engaged in a heated makeout session. By the time they fell asleep entangled in each others’ arms, Draco had managed to forget about both Yaxley’s visit and his nightmares. He felt more lighthearted than he had in days.
Potter cut him off with another laugh. "I'm just saying, it's not really up to you to tell me what's good for me, is it? Unless you can read my thoughts, in which case maybe you really are mental," he said. "I can decide for myself whether or not liking you would have consequences."
For the most part, their lives returned to normal. Draco hadn’t survived this long without picking up some ability to act, and he put those skills to good use. When the slightest noise made him jump, he passed his fright off as having seen a mouse or a cockroach. When Draco wanted to reassure himself that Harry was still alive and safe, he manhandled his boyfriend into a lengthy Netflix marathon and buried them both under layers of blankets.
to get up and leave now that he’d gotten his answers? Draco hardly dared to hope. He drummed his fingertips against his thighs in search of a distraction from the anticipation swelling in his chest.
Harry smiled. He pushed himself off the bed and crossed the room until he was standing in front of Draco. Taking Draco's face in his hands, he pressed a soft kiss to Draco's lips.
Despite his concern for Harry, and the anger he felt that someone could have reduced the boy to the nearly catatonic mess sitting on Draco's bed, Draco had to concede that he had a point. Draco couldn't very well expect Harry to reveal the details of his past when Draco himself wasn't comfortable returning the gesture.
He realized the moment Harry caught sight of the tattoo, as a sharp intake of breath echoed through the room. Tentatively, Harry reached out with two fingers as though to trace the ink. His fingers hovered uncertainly above the decorated skin until Draco pushed his arm up to meet them. They began following the patterns that curved around Draco's arm, though Harry's movements were still slow and hesitant. Draco shivered at the sensation, goosebumps rising on the affected flesh, and glanced down to watch Harry caress his arm.
"Um. Thanks?" Harry said. His eyes flickered to Draco's, a plea for help spelled clearly within them. Draco just turned his gaze to the table and snickered.
"You're Harry Potter, aren't you?" one of the girls enthused. "From the Pride and Prejudice drama!" She barely waited a moment for Harry to gesture in a vaguely affirmative manner, some combination of shrugging his shoulders and half-grimacing that left Draco stifling a chuckle, before continuing. "You were so good! I mean, most child actors are so stilted, or it's really obvious they don't have the experience older actors do, but you acted so naturally! Sometimes I totally forgot it was just a show, you were so realistic."
“I never asked you to!” Draco shouted back, matching Lucius’ intensity with his own. He strode deliberately forward, too, meeting Lucius halfway. “I don’t want an empire built on the backs of innocents, an empire that only exists because the people within it fear you. I won’t spill more blood than I have already. If I spend my whole life making amends, it won’t be enough!”
“At least tell me why you didn’t trust me,” Harry continued. “Or is that also too much to ask? Where did I fuck up so badly that you decided our time together meant nothing? Don’t I deserve to know at least that much, if you won’t tell me anything else? I want answers, Draco. I want to know where I stopped being enough.”
Yaxley led Draco to a car idling in the street, where he opened the passenger door and motioned for Draco to enter. Draco saw no choice but to step inside. The door slammed shut behind him before he’d even sat down, pitching Draco off balance. Yaxley settled into the backseat soon after.
“What is the nature of your relationship with this boy?” Lucius asked Draco.
"Yeah," Potter said absently, fiddling with the hem of his shirt. Draco filed the information away, just as he had been doing during the time they had spent together, despite knowing he likely would have no use for it in future. "I had fun with you," Potter said finally. "In fact, I think I'd like to take you out sometime," Potter said finally.
So, that's a wrap. Happy holidays!
“You can’t just shut people out every time you get scared, Draco!” Harry said suddenly, nearly shouting in an effort to reach across the distance Draco had put between them. “You’re not the only one who had a stake in this relationship. You don’t get to decide for me how things end, or how I’ll feel in the future.”
He took a deep breath, focusing only on the sounds of physical combat emanating from the speakers, and held it for a long moment. When he exhaled, he let the tension seep out of his muscles until he was once more draped loosely against Harry’s side.
He swallowed the lump building in his throat and his pride with it, and said, “I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry you got mixed up in my feud with my past. You were never supposed to be a part of this. My fear of my past and present colliding is why I was so hesitant to date you in the first place, and why I didn’t tell you the truth after Christmas. But you drew me in so easily and made me feel like I deserved happiness for once. I thought my father would leave you alone if I made it clear you had nothing to do with my decision to leave the Death Eaters. I thought…” Draco paused and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter what I thought. It wasn’t enough to keep you safe. I’m sorry for that.”
Harry laughed and shoved both his hands into his pockets. "I seem to owe you a favor," he said. "How about lunch? It's about that time, anyway."
As a result, Draco made sure to keep an eye on Harry as much as he could, and he made a concerted effort to keep both Harry and himself out of situations where they could be targeted. It was an easy task. After all, he knew how Lucius worked nearly as well as Lucius did; in turn, he knew how to preemptively counteract his father’s potential attacks.
He was brought abruptly to the present when Potter clasped a hand around Draco's left forearm. Draco's eyes flew open and he pulled away sharply, shrinking further back into the couch before he fully processed the situation. Then he stiffened, wondering how Potter would react.
He didn't bother looking back to see if Yaxley was following him. The man may have been two decades Draco's senior, but as Lucius Malfoy's son and heir, Draco enjoyed a position of authority second only to Lucius himself. Despite having left in the manner he had, Draco's command still held.
Draco was shaking his head before Harry had even finished speaking. “It was nothing,” he said. “Just a bad dream. Certainly you’ve had those, too?”
He had stormed toward Draco as he spoke, his steps even and purposeful, his cane nothing more than an accessory. A façade. Draco was so sick of facades, had spent his whole life crafting one for himself only for it to turn to rubble anyway. Lucius traded in facades, in masks and caged hearts and secrets and lies, and in him Draco saw everything he would rather die than become.
in flames, I’ll happily help,” he snarled. “There is so much you don’t know about me, Harry, so much that you don’t
That was the night the nightmares started.
Still, Draco understood where Potter was coming from. He inclined his head in acknowledgement. "We all have our secrets," he agreed. His own were largely encapsulated by a stupid mistake, burned forever into the flesh of his left forearm and symbolizing a stretch of Draco's life he was glad to have left behind him. He and Potter were silent for a stretch, caught up in old memories.
Draco scarcely dared to breathe. “What are you saying?”
But maybe the euphoria of the holiday season was wearing off on Draco, for he caught Harry's wrists and encouraged him to undress Draco, cooperating as Harry swept the shirt over his shoulders and arms. He paused just once, when the fabric was bunched around Draco's elbows, and glanced at Draco with a questioning gaze. Steeling his courage, Draco pulled the shirt over those final few inches himself and dropped it to the side. He brought his arms down.
Weasley's animosity seemed only to grow when, a week later, Draco rolled his suitcase through Harry and Weasley's front door. If looks could kill, Draco mused, he was sure the intensity of Weasley's gaze would have flayed Draco's skin from his bones the second he crossed the threshold. The redhead fumed silently from where he stood angrily, arms crossed and shoulder stiff with tension, in the kitchen.
He had let his walls crumble, and what did he have to show for it? A broken heart, and fear eating away at his mind. Well, he could rectify that mistake now, could encircle himself with barbed wire to keep outsiders at bay. What did it matter if he couldn’t leave, so long as no one else could enter and hurt him again?
I'd also like to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who has commented or left kudos on this fic. I appreciate you immensely; I can't believe there are still people out there interested in this dumb story haha.
Draco choked back a distressed cry at the thought that his mother had interfered on his behalf. He swallowed against the lump that had suddenly taken up residence in his throat, burning the back of his throat with each breath. Unlike Narcissa, Lucius was neither kind nor forgiving; Draco could not even imagine the lengths to which his mother must have gone in order to give him this second chance.
So he continued repeating the maxims his father had ingrained in him since birth, a reminder that Potter couldn't possibly be real. Something had to give.
“I was going to pop out and pick something up before you came back, but I ended up sleeping in,” Draco said with the appropriate amount of chagrin.
“Is it because you showed me your tattoo?” Harry asked at length.
with is none of your business,” Draco said tightly. “Besides, he’s a friend, nothing more. There was no need to involve him.”
The new term started a few short days later, preventing Draco and Harry from revisiting their argument. Draco wasted no time in moving back to his dorm. Relief washed over him as he put the last of his things away, the outcome of knowing he would no longer have to wear a permanent mask. Yet guilt twinged in his chest as well, flaring sharply each time he remembered the hard line of Harry’s mouth as he delivered his ultimatum, or his hurt expression after Draco had flung accusations at him.
, he thought to himself. He turned away to unlock his door.
"Are you calling me mentally deficient?" Draco cried, outraged. "I will have you know-"
Before Harry could accept or deny anything, though, Draco needed to actually apologize first. He began planning his words as he walked, letting the process distract himself from thinking about his Mark.
Potter looked at Draco skeptically. "So tell me the truth," he prompted. "I doubt it's really as bad as all that. Come on, you're interesting, you're witty, you're attractive. At least give me a chance."
The doorknob rattled then, pulling Draco out of his thoughts. The door opened a moment later and Harry stepped through, gently kicking the door shut behind him. “I’m back,” he called unnecessarily. Draco stepped into the room to greet him and found himself immediately pulled into a tight embrace.
And all the while, Draco was left waiting. Waiting, and planning, and preparing. He refused to admit defeat. He refused to return to the Death Eaters and be his father’s pawn once more.
A handful of Death Eaters milled about behind Lucius like bodyguards, all of whom had their Dark Marks exposed. The visual reminder of Draco’s shared connection with these criminals and murderers sent a shiver down his spine. He assumed they were similarly armed. After all, Draco was a hostile force as far as Lucius was concerned, a renegade who may need to be subdued at any moment. Draco was painfully exposed in comparison, and goosebumps prickled along his arms.
As he took in Harry's disheveled and flushed appearance, Draco thought to himself,
A knot of horror supplanted the anger Draco felt, growing more potent with each second. But Draco didn't let his uneasiness break through his facade, focusing instead on regaining control of the confrontation. "You grow bolder in the absence of my father," he noted coldly. "As though you forget that I, too, am a Malfoy." The reminder cowed Yaxley somewhat. At the very least, he stopped smirking, which Draco counted as a small victory. He let his words hang between them for another minute. "Tell me, then, why Father believes I will change my mind. Tell me why he cares so much to send anyone at all, or why I would come with you when I have made my feelings clear."
Draco, at a loss for words, said simply, “Alright.”
"Because I'm begging you to," the man said rather unnecessarily. He glanced over his shoulder, and Draco heard the sound of nearing footsteps. "Look, I'll owe you one, I'll buy you a meal or something. Please."
"Thank you," he whispered against them, his forehead resting against Draco's, their breaths intermingling until Draco couldn't tell where his ended and Harry's began.
Draco burrowed closer and said nothing, his silence a death knell ringing loud and clear.
In the end, Draco was little more than a self-serving creature of caution. So he pasted a smile on his face, forced his body to relax, and said, “It’s just a few nightmares. I’m sure they’ll go away soon.”
Potter laughed nervously, shifting his weight from side to side, and said, "Harry Potter." He held out his hand to Draco.
But he couldn't go back. Though he knew she would face harsh consequences for his disobedience, he would not allow Lucius to use Narcissa like a bargaining chip. It would only reveal that she was one of Draco's weaknesses, allowing her to be used again and again in the future.
When Draco arrived, he knew immediately this would not be one of those afternoons. Harry’s expression was stormy, and his lips curved in an angry frown.
"Quite the celebrity, aren't you?" Draco said drily, hoping his voice didn't sound as hoarse as he imagined it did.
Draco let his hand drop from Harry's back when he felt certain that Harry would continue moving without Draco's guidance. His hands clenched into fists as well, mirroring Harry's, as anger washed over him anew. This wasn't the Harry he knew. This wasn't the Harry who had coaxed Draco out of his shell with promises of happiness and freedom. This was a Harry he had only glimpsed once before, and that, too, for scarcely a split second-when he had asked Harry about the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.
“Yeah, see you later.”
“Ha! Looks like you can’t get it right either! Who’s dumb now?” Harry was enjoying the fact that even though he didn’t get right, Malfoy did just as bad.
“Oh yes, the Yule Ball.” Draco replied, sitting down next to Harry on the sofa. He took the green blanket at his feet and draped it over his legs. “You know, if I wasn’t so hellbent on seeing you stumble around hopelessly in front of everyone I might have actually helped you.”
“Okay, that’s actually kinda mean. I should try it on you some time.” Harry got up, standing in front of Draco. “There’s gotta be
Both boys took a deep breath in before ducking under the water, Harry twisting open the top of the egg to reveal the sounds of singing voices.
“Ha! Serves him right!” Ron laughed out, almost tripping on his shoelace.
“Can’t have been. It’s gotta be a bloke from that kind of guilt, guessing he’s from another house if we haven’t figured out who yet.” Dean replied.
“Damn, Harry! You really got some action!” Seamus said, only quieting down when he received a death stare from Ron.
“Fine.” huffed Harry, but sensing that this could be a trap, didn’t cast the spell.
“Okay, okay. Fine. But I still think you’re hiding something.” Hermione said before leaving for the girl’s dormitories.
“Ah, yeah. Girls.” Harry replied, his mind drifting back to Draco. Was he okay? Did his sudden panic upset him? Harry felt like there was a wet blanket coating his mind, weighing down his thoughts. He should talk to Draco, see if he’s okay. Harry shook his head, pushing those thoughts to the side. Shouldn’t invade his space.
“I play Quidditch with Fred and George,
, I don’t have much of a choice. I’m the saviour of the wizarding world whether I like it or not.”
“Merlin, Luna. It’s Friday, why are we going into deep conversations?” Ginny sat up, an absurd amount of loose grass sticking to her bright red hair.
Hello lovely readers! This might be a slightly shorter chapter but I wanted to update you how things are going. I use a map to keep sure the narrative flows smoothly and often plan multiple chapters in advance. I'm reaching the end of the map so far, so I've been working on extending it. The next few chapters will be a bit shorter, they're all filler chapters as the big finale is about to come, but that doesn't mean it's the end of the story, for when one year ends, another begins.
“He’s not lying, ‘Mione. We should leave it be.” Ron interjected, saving Harry from the heat of Hermione’s integration.
“There’s something else you’re not telling me, I can feel it,” Draco whispered quietly. “Is it bad? Is that why you won’t tell me?”
“Merlin! What are you doing in here, Myrtle?” Harry said, looking at the ghost.
“Can’t sing above the ground.” Harry pondered to himself. “Draco, what creatures live in the Black Lake besides the giant squid?”
the pipes in the school, Harry. I can go to any bathroom I would like.” Myrtle replied, swinging her legs into the water without really touching it.
“But why are you in
“And why were you at the library after curfew? It closes long before then.”
Harry twisted one of the golden faucets, lavender scented bubbles coating the surface of the water. He dipped his hand in for a moment, testing the water. Satisfied with the temperature he began unbuttoning his night-shirt.
“What’s wrong? Do you need a mannequin to practice with?”
Harry noticed that Draco had suddenly become very quiet. He squeezed his hand and pulled him in closer. “What’s on your mind?”
And so the boys stepped onto the Hogwarts Express, walking down the train in opposite directions. Draco paused for a moment before shouting down to Harry.
“If I don’t what? Do tell, Potter. What are you going to do?” Malfoy cut Harry off, happily watching the boy reach his limits.
“A beautiful end to a beautiful day.” Ginny lay back into the soft grass, watching all the various shaped clouds float by.
Draco fell quiet once again, resting his head in the crock of Harry’s neck. For the first time he felt that he was enough, someone loved him for who he is, no more or no less. He didn’t want to dwell on the bad but rather enjoy the peace that Harry brought into his life (quite ironically since he seemed to be a Dark Magic magnet).
“Oh, so our DADA professor back in first year had Voldemort’s soul attached to him, the basilisk was what prettified all those students in second year, and it turns out the Sirius Black was my Dad’s best friend but was framed by their other friend, Peter, who gave away their location on Voldemort. Oh, and he was also Ron’s pet rat.”
Harry walked through the school grounds, searching for a particular head of dirty blonde hair. Even though he had patched everything up with Ron he still had other friends he liked to talk to. Harry eventually found the person he was looking for, also noticing a familiar red-head.
“I had the cloak, I was trying to crack the clue from the First Task.” Harry chewed the inside of his lip. Ron seemed to fall for it but Hermione was still unsure.
“If the answer is snogging someone I shouldn’t be then you’re 100% correct.” Harry replied, hiding his face in his hands.
“I can go through
“Oh, come on Potter. Forgotten the spell already. Well, I’m not surprised, I don’t expect anything of use to stick in that thick skull of yours.” Malfoy jabbed at Harry, waiting to get a reaction out of the boy.
“It is if you take too long to find it.”
to take a date.” Harry grumbled, neck deep in a grey blanket.
“Oh, good afternoon Harry. Ginny and I were just talking.” Luna smiled at Harry, sending a jolt of warmth through his body. She was always kind and welcoming, a certain sparkle in her eyes showing the purity of her soul.
“Was it Cho Chang?” Seamus piped up, earning a right slap from Dean.
“So, you remember the plan, right?” Draco asked, himself and Harry walking to Hogsmede station.
“If you trust her then I do too.” Draco's warm lips lightly brushed against Harry’s damp skin as he talked, causing both boys to feel sparks travel along their necks. “You weren’t lying in first year when you said you can tell the wrong sort of person for yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco softly stroked Harry’s cheek, sensing the pot of bubbling emotions Harry was feeling. Sadness, guilt, fear, he was on the brink of breaking and Draco truly didn’t want that to happen.
“Look, you’re overthinking this.” Draco stopped both of them, music still quietly playing throughout the room. “How about we swap, give you an idea of how you’re
“Look, I’m really sorry that I caused you to fall out with Weasley, you shouldn’t have to lose your best friend all because you wanted to defend me.”
“You’re on thin fucking ice, Potter.” Malfoy hissed from between his teeth.
----------
“Having that wizard murder you parents in front of your eyes only to be forced to live with the worst uncle and aunt in history!” Harry slapped his hands over his mouth. He didn’t mean to yell, he didn’t mean to say that, not to Draco.
“No. It’s just that waltzing by yourself feels awkward after a while.”
“Okay, thanks, Myrtle,” Harry replied, turning to the ghost. “Draco and I would rather be alone, but I can talk to you another time if you want.”
“I...I can’t, Draco.” Harry whispered, trying to escape Draco’s gaze. “Not...not now. I don’t think I can tell you, I’m just not ready.”
“But looking at you is awkward.” Harry replied, looking up to meet Draco’s grey eyes.
“Look, we don’t have time for this. Go over there so we can start the lesson.” Hermonie jabbed Harry in the ribs, becoming irritable that this was cutting into her class time. Harry just huffed in response, walking to where Malfoy stood.”
“Not a clue.” Harry swam back to the ledge of the tub, putting down the egg before making his way back to Draco. “The most important thing is that I know where the next task is and what I’m up against. I don’t think it’s the end of the world if I can’t figure out what’s taken in time.”
“No, you’re right. I know you’re not mean enough to refuse helping me.”
“Please, just, don’t tell anyone?” Harry asked the three boys in the room with him. They all nodded.
“No. I think I’ll just get turned down. I’m planning on asking Luna anyway, she’s a good friend that won’t judge my questionable dancing skills.” Harry replied, taking his hands away from his face to look at Ron.
“All that in the span of three years?”
“Well, it’s rude not to look at you when you’re talking.” Harry subconsciously moved closer to Draco, feeling the warmth of their magic radiating off of his body.
, this should be easy for you, unless you’re dumber than you already look.” Malfoy continued.
“Well, what are you talking about?” Harry asked, picking at the grass next to his feet.
“About what?” Harry asked, genuinely confused as to what his friends would be so desperate to talk about. Was it the Second Task?
“Oh, that’s so unfair.” Harry said. “I need some pointers. And if you don’t then I’ll force you to tell me.”
“Scared Potter?”
“If that’s what you say you were doing. But I don’t like how you’re so secretive and sneaking around. Please don’t tell me you’re breaking the rules.”
rules but his personal ones? Harry felt like he had broken every rule he had made for himself.
Bit of a shorter one today but we're bringing the angst and emotions.
“Hi Ginny. Hi Luna. What are you guys up to?” Harry asked, sitting beside the girls on the bright green grass.
“Yes, yes, I know. Youngest Seeker of our generation.” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “Now lift your arms into position.”
“It’s entirely possible.” Draco swam closer to Harry, pushing aside bubbles as he did so. “An hour to find something that you’ll miss, do you have any idea what they might take from you?”
“No, I might. Fred and George are always looking for test subjects anyway.” Harry replied. Hermonie could only sigh in response as the trio entered the Great Hall.
Draco was stunned to the point of silence. There was a storm brewing in his chest, a combination of sadness, guilt and untamed rage. He had been treating Harry like crap for so long, not even realising the true extent of his pain. His own family didn’t love him and the only ones who did died because of it.

Here it is everyone, the chapter you all knew was coming. It is time, ladies, gentlemen and all those in between, for the Final Task.
Draco was right, there
“It’s okay, I trust her.”

“No, of course not.” Harry replied in confidence. That wasn’t a lie, he wasn’t breaking any
“Real nice of you to give me the password, Potter.” Harry found Draco standing outside the entrance to the Prefects’ bathroom, arms crossed across his chest and foot-tapping impatiently.
“It’s okay. I’ll go talk to her now.” Harry went to stand up before he was pushed back into the mattress by Ron.
“Oh.” said Ron. “Well, we don’t have charms until next Monday. You could ask Fred and George for one of their Fever Fudge prototypes.”
“I would try putting that under the water if I were you,” Myrtle said. “That’s what the other boy did.”
“Well, you gonna take them to the Yule Ball next week?” Ron asked, purposefully avoiding the gender of the person in question because, unfortunately, he believed that Dean and Seamus might be on to something.
“I managed it on my second try. How about you, Harry?” Hermonie turned to the boy who had been oddly quiet since they left the classroom.
Harry and Draco both swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. Who had also snuck into the bathroom to catch them together? The answer was a glum young girl, sitting cross-legged on one of the taps.
“Lots of things, I assume,” Draco replied, calmly treading the water. “If this is a creature that sings then it must be human-like. Humans are the only beings that are able to sing.”
"Obviously," Harry said in full seriousness. "It's only right."
But we made it through! Things get worse before they get better, but they do get better eventually. Thanks to the people who have left encouraging comments <3 It genuinely means the world to me.
“Would you believe me if I said sorry?” Draco asked. He was immensely proud of how collected he sounded. Harry floundered for a response, and Draco used the momentary silence to push on. “I told you that very first day that they used to call me the Ice Prince. You didn’t listen. You never even asked why.” He laughed, a single, humorless bark. Malfoys didn’t feel emotion. Malfoys played their cards close to their chest. Malfoys didn’t expose their weaknesses. “Well, this is why. I’ve learned how to reckon with my emotions, Harry. How to shut them off, how to use them to my advantage. I’m not going to exhaust myself in a desperate attempt to placate you, only for you to lose your temper the next time I refuse to let you read my diary.”
Draco shook his head. "Not for a few hours," he replied, and immediately Harry jerked him forward, pulling him along such that he had to either match Harry's pace or be left to trip over himself gracelessly in an effort not to go sprawling to the ground.
When Draco reached the correct floor, he paused for one more brief moment, squaring his shoulders before turning the corner and coming face-to-face with Potter, who was sitting at the same desk Draco had been sitting at when they first met. Draco strode forward and sat at the other chair pulled up to the desk, presumably by Potter since Draco didn't remember the desk ever having had a second chair any of the numerous times he had used it. Neither boy said anything.
Draco laughed involuntarily. “The Draco you wanted is already dead,” he replied, “and his blood is on your hands.”
Wow, college has been kicking my butt. I'm so sorry to have left you all hanging, I haven't had much time to work on ACOMI recently orz but never fear! I have the next few chapters written and I'm working on the rest so you will get an end to this hell eventually! Thank you so much to everyone who's stuck with me this far.
Or he could lie, and protect himself, even if it meant losing Harry in the process.
The trek to his dorm was a blur. By the time Draco stumbled up to his door, his anger had been supplanted by exhaustion, and he fumbled his key three times before managing to slot it into the lock. Tears of frustration welled in his eyes; he let them fall as he entered, kicking the door shut behind him and sinking to the floor in one motion.
"I'm only a phone call away, Harry," Weasley said loudly. With a quick glance thrown towards Draco, and a valiant attempt to lower his voice that fell just shy of success, Weasley continued, "You know you can stay with us, yeah? Mum wouldn't mind one bit."
Draco opened the door to find Potter holding up a six-pack with a hopeful smile. Draco sighed again and walked away from the door without bothering to check if Potter followed, tossing a "Lock the door behind you" over his shoulder as he did. He curled up comfortably on his couch, tucking his knees underneath him, and held out a hand imperiously for a beer.
He withdrew further into himself, unwilling to give Harry any indication of just what was inspiring such terror in him. When Harry snuck into the shower with him in the mornings, wrapping his arms lazily around Draco’s waist, Draco shrugged him off under pretense of not being able to move and steadfastly ignored the hurt expression Harry bore as a result. When Harry brought back takeout from Draco’s favorite Chinese place, Draco couldn’t taste it through the guilt and fear clogging his throat. He barely remembered to thank Harry for the kind gesture.
Decision made, Draco pulled out his phone to message Harry, only to find a notification for an incoming message already blinking on the screen. Curious, he opened it. It was from Harry. “We need to talk. Can you come over?”
Harry's mouth split open in a wide grin when he realized what Draco was saying. "Just pay me in kisses," he told Draco. "I think a thousand ought to cover five weeks' rent."
Draco bristled. "I'm not scared," he spat out, glaring at Potter. He tried to dissuade Potter one last time. "You're right that it won't last long, though. I'm broken, Potter, I don't think that's made it through that thick skull of yours."
“He’s told me nothing but the truth,” Draco retorted. “Which is more than I can say about you, Father. You could have simply asked me to meet you. Instead you lured me here with lies and threats, kidnapping someone I care for to use as leverage against me. Pathetic.” He sneered, the confident expression masking the fear that paralyzed him.
"I'm sure we can find another ice cream shop," Harry placated, relief that Draco didn't actually regret going out with him evident in his tone. "It's not the end of the world, honestly."
The final chapter will be out by Christmas!
to know. You think that just because you kissed me a few times, just because I stayed with you, you’re entitled to demand answers I don’t wish to provide?”
“Why don’t we start over?” Harry said. He stuck out his hand. “Harry Potter, former child actor.”
The door opened scant few moments later, but Harry wasn’t the one standing on the other side.
"You could have built a fairly successful career using that as a starting point," Draco said to Harry. "It was phenomenal."
Unsurprisingly, he struggled to pay attention to the lecture over the sound of the blood rushing past his ears. He was acutely aware of every stroke of ink engraved upon his skin. He half-expected one of his peers to whip around in the middle of the lecture and direct an accusatory finger his way, declaring, “That man bore witness to families losing their livelihoods without saying a word! That man has blood baked into every line of his hands!”
Draco glanced once more towards Lucius. Sure enough, the man wore an expectant expression, with both hands resting lightly on the cane planted directly in front of him. He looked utterly composed. Draco didn’t understand how he looked so serene, especially when Draco’s own heart threatened to drill straight through his ribcage. Lucius gestured magnanimously in Draco’s direction, as though telling Draco to get on with it.
Sure enough, Dolohov pulled up to another drab warehouse, its façade nearly identical to the others that lined the block. Draco climbed out as soon as the car came to a standstill, taking a brief moment to orient himself and take stock of his surroundings. Then he moved toward the entrance, not waiting for Yaxley and Dolohov to catch up. They may have brought him here, but he didn’t have to be delivered inside by them.
Harry chewed nervously on his lip. “It seemed like there was more behind it,” he said. “You were really thrashing around.”
"Not even for your parents?" Harry pressed.
Draco felt like he was in hell for the rest of the day. Every sudden or loud noise sent a jolt of paranoia through his body. He had to force himself not to check over his shoulder every time he saw a shadow in his periphery. He took to avoiding his own reflection, knowing he would only find bloodshot eyes and gaunt skin staring back at him if he cared to look. He turned the television on briefly, hoping the Christmas spirit would take his mind off his worries, but he turned it off just moments later when the bright cheeriness and blinding optimism was too jarring for the unease that still lingered in his mind. Somewhere in between, he managed to send Harry a text saying “Happy Christmas!”, the cheery words at complete odds with how Draco really felt.
He stayed like that for a minute, letting himself wallow in embarrassment and self-recrimination. His words from the previous night barrelled through his mind, making it difficult to think straight. Then he dragged himself out of bed and headed to the bathroom to transform himself into something resembling human. He returned to his room to wallow some more and then, having done a suitable amount of that, to organize his thoughts regarding Potter and figure out how to proceed.
Then Harry tried to pull the shirt off by prompting Draco to raise his arms so he could slide the fabric up them, and Draco panicked.
"That's a bit pot-kettle, isn't it?" Potter said mildly.
From his angle on the floor, Draco could see a t-shirt lying in a crumpled pile beneath his bed: a soft cotton v-neck that Harry must have left behind before the winter holiday. He fished it out, eyes widening in surprise when he noticed it still smelled a little like Harry. In a flurry of movement, he stripped off his own long-sleeved sweater and pulled Harry’s shirt on in its place. He curled his arms around his waist, burrowing into the shirt and ignoring how pathetic he must look.
