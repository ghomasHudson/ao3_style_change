Ok so as the chapter title says, I am discontinuing this book. I started this book for fun, but know I just have no motivation to write this anymore. If someone wants to adopt this or something, they are more than welcomed to. I really hate how this turned out and this story just straight up sucks dick. I'm really sorry if you actually liked this and wanted me to continue, but I just can't. I really don't know how to explain my distaste for this story, but I just feel like I have to explain it.
"Get up fatty, or your going to be late!" My father yelled, as I slowly drifted back to reality. "Yes father.." I slowly get up, wincing at the pain of my lower rib."Merde" (shit) I mutter under my breath. When I get up, I adjusted my black beanie and brushed off my green hood and my black ripped jeans. I wiped the blood off my face and walked out the door.
"I'm fine" I watch as he moves away, wrapping his arms around himself. I stare at his arms, remembering the cuts from the train. They looked to real to be consider fake, the only explanation is that he cuts himself. Whether for attention or not, I know that it's dangerous and I should probably talk to him about it. "You cut yourself." He looked up at me in panic. Great job Harry, now he thinks you're a noise bitch!
The welcome back fest was going great, and I actually felt happy for once. Well...before I eventually left so that I could purge the little food I did eat in the bathroom....
Me and Ali nod our heads as we got our wands out. Mother smiled as we apparated to the train station.When we got there, I started to get some looks from some wizards and from the first year muggle-born muggle relatives. Usually, the muggle teenagers and some older Hogwarts students give me,what my sister calls, 'The Look' Or, when they start looking me up and down and liking their lips
"Ok see you later dray, love you" Alex said smiling "Love you too" Malfoy mumbled as he walked away. She looked at him sadly then looked back at us. "Well, I got to go! Bye guys!" She said, but before she could leave, Ron asked, " So you're...with Malfoy?" (A/N They think Draco and Alex are dating) Alex turned around and gave him a confused look. "I mean, you are really nice and polite, but then Malfoy is a total git! OW!" Ron yelled when Hermione punched his arm.

"But why would the slytherins need to feel welcomed. They are the house of evil and cruel." I wondered out loud. "In cause you have failed to notice Potter," Snape started, walking towards me. "The slytherins are children, just like the rest of the student body. Labeling an 11 year old as 'evil' is flat out cruel and unrealistic. Have you ever took a second to wonder why slytherins went to Voldemort's side during the war? Maybe it's because of their parents? Or maybe its because of people like you who assume their all evil and terrible people that they actually become what you say they are."
"It really is a shame, I hate to ruin your beautiful body." He breathed against my ear. "Do whatever you want to him Dustin, I am already paying you to break him." The girl started rolling her eyes. The boy, Dustin, turned back to me and smirked, "You are going to love this you slut." He growled, flipping me over.
Alex looks at the train and says "We should find a compartment before all of them get taken." She looks back at us, and we all nod. We get in the train and put our bags away. We sit in an empty compartment and talk as we wait for the train to start moving.
I smiled back at he and said hello. Luna and I became friends while she was prisoner in the Malfoy Manor. When no one was there, I would bring Luna and Ollivander food and blankets to keep them alive. During that time, Luna and I started to open up to each other a lot.
"Well... Ginny said she saw him with Parkinson, Zabini, Nott, his Mother... and a blond girl" Hermione said. Just then the compartment door opened. Ginny Weasly and Luna Lovegood came inside. Luna was holding a letter. "Hello Harry, Headmistress McGonagall wanted me to give you this letter." Luna said as she handed Harry the letter. In red ink, he read   To: Harry Potter   From: Minerva McGonagall
From the corner of my eye, I could see a bunch of red heads gathered together. I looked over and saw Ginny Weasley staring at me in disbelief. I offered her a small smile, as I pushed myself off the hard cement. I looked away from her and continued to talk to my friends.
"I-I don't kn-know father..." I try my hardest not to start crying, because that would be very hard to try to hide it from Alex and my mother. My father looked at me in disgust, then he kicked me in the ribs. I bent over and stared at the ground.
"I also need to tell all the eight years a few things. You guys are all eighth years, right?" She asked looking at Ginny with a puzzled look on her face. "Well we are." Hermione said pointing at Harry, Ron and herself. " But Ginny's not." She said looking at Ginny and smiling when Ginny blushed slightly.
"I can't believe McGonagall (Don't know if I spelled it right) is making us redo 7th year!" the redheaded boy exclaimed. It's been 3 years since the war ended, and McGonagall had fixed up the school and invited the Hogwarts 7th years back. Of course Hermione forced Ron and Harry to go with her to Hogwarts. Harry was lost in thought until he heard Ron yell, " WHAT!!! MALFOY!! THEY CAN'T DO THAT!!"
I AM ALIVE!!! unfortunately haha.... Anyway, I'm sorry for not updating I'm shit I know. As y'all should know I am not 'She-who-must-not-be-named' therefor, I do not own any of these characters except for Alex and my other OC's that I am going to add. This story is on Ao3, and fanfiction.net if you are wondering. And I also have a few things on my tumblr (deefuckingsays) for this story and another story I am planing on working on.
When Alex saw me, I tried my best to hide my face,but she grabbed my chin and forced me to look her in the eyes. She gasped, and handed my mother a note she had in her hands. "Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a fait? On dirait que vous êtes tombé dans une flaque de sang."(What did he do to you? You look like you fell in a puddle of blood.) She whispered softly. I tried to laugh, but I ended up in a coughing fit. Alex took out her wand and mumbled a few healing spells. She was obliviously not a professional healer, so all she could do was stop the bleeding. "Thanks Ali" I say, giving her a small smile which she returned.
"Ron, it's fine! I don't like Harry anymore " Ginny hissed as she tried to pull Ron back in his seat. Ron rolled his eyes and looked at his sister, "Of course you didn't! You are just saying that so Harry wont get mad at you!" Ron shouted. The whole Great Hall went silent.
I stopped listening after I felt someone gently elbowed me. I look over to Pansy, as she was the one who hit me, 'What?' I whispered. She continued to stare straight ahead, so I follow her gaze. My eyes widen as I look at a table that was parallel to the one the Professors use. Hanging on top of the table, was what seemed to be the face of a badger, with a snake tail, lions mane, and the wings of a bird.
When Alex and my mother shut the door, my father raised his cane and hit my head. I felt something wet dripping from my forehead. But before I could raise my hand to confirm the logical explanation of it being my blood, my father punched my already-bruised neck and I fell on the floor. "I told you to be down the stairs in EXACTLY, five minutes!" My father hissed, "And you've been up their for how long Draco!" He spit.
"No reason Dray" Alex smiled at me "And I'm fine, I knew you guys would be fine with it." She looked at the gryffindors when she said 'it'
Father has been beating me ever since I was 3, so even if it isn't new it still hurts. Father walked up the stairs and into my room. I tried to stand up straighter so he doesn't get mad at me. He looked me up and down as he licked his lips. He took a step closer to me, I closed my eyes expecting to get hit. But father didn't hit me, all he did was whisper in my ear "Strip for your daddy" He slurred. I stepped back and looked at him, I just froze 'This can't be happening! I'm to young! He-he wouldn't- he can't, can he?' I thought to myself.
"Oi, watch where you're going next time ferret!" Ron barked. Malfoy muttered something about Ron bumping into him. That made Ron furious! Ron grabbed Malfoy's arm and pulled him back. Malfoy winced, but that only made Ron's grip tighten around Malfoy's wrist. Malfoys friend (Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini and Alex) noticed this and and tried to push Ron away from him.
From the corner of his eye, Harry could see Pansy Parkinson whisper in something to Draco Malfoy. What ever she said, it made Malfoy Blush a bright crimson color, and hide is face in his hands. Harry didn't realize that he had zoned out until he felt a sudden gush of wind hit his face. He fell on his back, he could fell a cool liquid dripping onto the floor, then a burning sensation above his cheek. He felt like a scoop of ice cream on the sun.
"Thank you.." I look up at Draco and just stare at him. I've never noticed how pretty Malfoy's eyes are, or how soft his hair looks. I wonder how soft it actually is I reached my hand up and-
The first two times, I was in first year. I tried to hang myself twice, but Pansy Parkinson and Alex just so happened to be sneaking into the prefects bathroom and found me before I let go of the chair that was underneath me. The second time, Theodore Nott found me in the slytherin common room, again, I was hanging myself. Then two more times in second year, once in third, twice in fifth year, and three times in sixth.
I watch silently as Draco rolls up his sleeves with an uncertain look on his face. "If you don't want to, then its fine." I reassure him with a small smile. Draco shakes his head as a determined look takes over his face. I can tell he doesn't want to say anything, so I take his hand and draw a very sloppy butterfly. "Are you sure you are not a professional artist? Like Pablo Picasso who." I hear Draco mutter sarcastically
Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Alex and I sat at the right end of the table. Pansy and Alex were sitting by my left side, and we had our backs to the professors. Blaise was sitting across from me, and Theo sat on Blaise's left side.
“I wanted to attempt to transfigure a cushion into a...cat of some sort. To keep me company.” She still wasn’t talking so Draco kept going. “A pet would definitely help my restlessness, and if I were to solely provide for one it would teach me about responsibility, and I wouldn’t bother you as much -I know how much you hate it when I talk too much- and it would really be a challenge for my transfiguration skills.” He rambled.
Thinking fast, he cast a spell on the door, causing it to violently fling back into place, nearly hitting the intruder. Using that as a distraction, Draco jumped out from behind the drawer and ran at the intruder, pinning them to the wall with a wand at their throat.
Greg snorted. “The only reason Draco uses last names is because he thinks it sounds cool.” He mocks lightly.
“Like you’ve been shagged.” Theo popped in. Draco refused to look him in the eye and flushed a deep red.
"It's S.P.E.W, and as a society we intend to abolish all house elf slavery being used by freeing elves from their masters and allowing them to live their lives properly, without waiting on hand and foot for someone." She smiled proudly.
Draco pursed his lips. “I wasn’t really struggling with a spell per say, I was um, attempting to create a spell?” He tested the waters. Aunt Bella grinned wide so he elaborated. “I was testing how I could discover a more permanent version on Conversus Animalis.” Aunt Bella clapped her hands.
There was a staircase to the left of him, and he presumed someone was walking down it. He turned his body around as much as he could and spat the wand into one hand to hide it quickly.
Draco filled his satchel with his half of the care package, including a newspaper he elected to read later. He pulled out a couple of sugar quills to pop in his pocket. Those would keep his boredom at bay, as he saw that his first two lessons were Arithmancy and Care of Magical Creatures.
“I was joking, Merlin you’re wrapped up tight.” Blaise turned to girls. “Hello ladies! Pansy, you’re looking spicy tonight!” He bounced his eyebrows. Pansy crossed her arms.
"Right you are Drakey-kins! My amazing, strong, handsome love of my life!" Blaise burst of laughing, followed by Vince, Greg and Octavia.
First years Draco didn't know continued to be sorted into Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff in that order. The time it took to sort seemed to vary on the person, such as for Seamus Finnigan, who took over a minute to be sorted into Gryffindor. Most of the children stayed smiling, so Draco imagined that the hat wasn't overtly reading their minds. It didn't do much to quench the nervousness that pooled in the bottom of his stomach.
"Well, with feet that size, hard not to," he commented, calling himself to attention, though he feared giving a piggy back to Via may have ruined the effect.
“But baby,” Blaise reacts to the nickname by practically melting, “you said you were comfortable with it. Would be a bit mean now. Wouldn’t it?” Theo asks, that damn pout. For once Octavia hates the puppy dog eyes with a venom.
At first many people thought that the people were trapped in the box using muggle elek-tree-city, but Potter said that wasn’t how it worked, and it was like a longer version of an animated photo. That did clear some stuff up, but also confused some kids further.
She went up and sat down on the stool primly. Professor McGonagall rested the hat on her head. Everyone in the hall seemed to be holding their breath for her, causing a slight unease in her stomach.
“Just chatting about Potions homework.” Theo interrupts with a smile. “Thanks for the help mate.” He slaps Blaise on the back and passes Octavia in a slight hurry. Octavia smiles back with nothing behind the eyes.
So when she found out that not only was he smart, he was confident, funny and sensitive. It only made sense that she developed a crush on him.
"You'd be better off running along. Don't want them to know you have Granger with you?" He nodded his head towards her.
As they rose from the bench, Viktor leaned over to ask Draco a question. “Vill you be entering the tournament, Drako?”
If he went to one of Slytherin’s secret nook or crannies, he was eventually found by either a couple trying to shack up or a determined first year trying to map out of every square inch of the dungeons, (
Another piece of parchment propelled by flames flew from the goblet, landing in Dumbledore’s hand once again. He squinted as he read it out.
As for my Big Blue House: I am focusing all of my energy into Double Trouble because it’s what I’m feeling more, but as soon as I am done with the first book of that, I will be rewriting a Big Blue House to be better because I think it could improve.
He ran through the halls, racing in and out of students, trying to find a deserted area. He made it into a deserted and dusty Defence classroom and shut the door. He shakily rose his wand and set a weak silencing charm around the room, blocking any sound from making it out.
The kid then kneeled down on the bed and reached pathetically for a pillow. His arms were still tied awkwardly, but then he managed to grab the pillow and hold it. He closed his eyes in focus and his brows furrowed. Sirius raised an eyebrow.
“Oh no! I refuse to let you use amateur magic on your eyes! Go and ask your brother or something!” Octavia was hesitant.
After Martha was done combing through Octavia’s hair, she asked Octavia to do the same for her. The roles didn’t switch exactly though, as Martha still continued to word vomit while Octavia listened. She didn’t mind. Draco always going on about Potter had gotten her well used to just sitting back and listening. Besides, Martha’s stories were far more interesting.
He looked over to me boredly, having been shifting through a jean rack. He shrugged. "Looks okay, try it on in the booth." He jerked his thumb behind him to a curtain, which I guessed was the "booth".
But she then noticed a small movement in the lake. Some unusual ripples. They were difficult to make out in the dark, but she didn’t have to try too hard as they began to grow larger and larger, until they appeared as a large whirl pool.
His half of the room was as tidy and immaculate as he seemed to be, a place for everything, and everything in it's place. This made my side of the room look even more like a pigsty, and I was almost embarrassed.
With all the force he could muster, Draco rose his freed legs upwards and kicked Sirius square in the face. Using the force from that, he got shoved onto his back harshly and the wood of the chair crackles. He swung his shoulder into a wall with wild abandon to get rid of the rest on the chair and binds, and the wood crackles and breaks into pieces, letting the rope free Draco. He thinks he sprained his shoulder in the process, but he ignores the pain. He pulled out his wand but before he can cast a spell he’s punched in the face by a very angry Sirius. Fuck.
By the time we'd gotten to Hogsmeade it was 11 o'clock. The village was very quiet and the sky was cloudy. I looked over to "Tom", who had pulled the drawstring of his hood a little tighter, lowering his head slightly, eyes darting about. I smiled and tugged on his arm.
Fortunately or unfortunately, however you may phrase it, Draco and Potter did not run out of alcohol. This is because (luckily or unluckily) Draco had kept a small bottle of vodka in his pocket, and they’d been mixing it with pumpkin juice for much of the night.
Back to her people watching, she noticed a slight kerfuffle happening at the Gryffindor table, as Potter made a bit of a scene before storming off.
"What in Heavens name has happened to this shirt Potter. What did it ever do to you for you to feel the need to wear this day in day out, and for you to not to take it out of its misery?" He continued to ruffle through my clothing.
“I was. I let Vince have him. And that’s why I get you.” She prodded him in the chest. “Time for our song.” She pulled him closer to whisper in his ear. “Let’s act.” This made him smirk.
“It was okay. I don’t really remember much of it though. I was drunk.” He excused and Blaise’s face fell.
“I must be drunker than I thought, because I swear I am seeing Harry Potter.” He squinted. Draco pat the drunk boy’s shoulder.
He spotted Greg and Vince sitting next to each other and managed to catch a moment. They’re hands were resting next to each other’s, pinky’s about to link together. Draco caught Vince’s eye and Vince beamed up at him and not so subtly gestured to Greg. Draco gave him a supportive thumbs up.
Draco had been dragging her forward as the game continued, practically, falling off the edge of the box as he watched. There was a quite a bit of drama this game, so Draco was even more hooked. The Veela had a couple of mid game encore performances that ended up distracting a whole lot of people. But Draco was having none of it. Nothing could have dragged his attention away from this game.
“And Vince has been helping Greg with his homework anyway he can. That’s why he’s falling behind a bit more, he’s constantly trying to help out Greg!”
"O-Oh, sorry, sh-she's just someone f-from a fairy tale." He was usually better at keeping in his internal comparisons of people to characters.
Potter pretended to surrender. “Yeah yeah, I know, I’m just saying. The fact that we get on okay almost feels like the last three years of rivalry were a waste.” Draco shifted uncomfortably.
"Y-yeah, no problem." Draco answered and opened up one of the doors. As he let go of the doorknob the miniature eagle spoke.
“You rem-em-berr my name!” He said in awe “It is nice to see you again Drako, how is your mor-neeng?” He asked politely. Draco’s grin smoothened out properly.
So all of them would have to deal with it the old fashion way. With sunglasses, water and mild pain numbing charms. Though you had to be careful with this charm, as if you used it too frequently, it would numb your brain as well.
McGonagall had come to the front of the steps and everyone instantly quietened down. I muffled a snicker at everyone's unfathomable respect for her, although deserved. If everyone didn't already appreciate and/or fear her, then the stories of her in the battle of Hogwarts ought to have done it.
"Yeah mini Malfoy! Go quidditch! Woohoo, Ireland!" The two boys who looked like twins cheered, encouraging the others in the family to join in. Octavia wasn't sure whether or not they were twins, as all of the ginger family looked quite similar.
"Uh, what are you doing in here?" I asked her. She waved me away in favour of gasping for air. Her cackles were interrupted by a low groan coming from Malfoy's closet.
He began to nod. “Yeah, you’re probably right. Just another overreaction. I just hate Granger.” He convinced himself and Octavia nodded.
"Via!" Pansy's attention turned to her. "It's been far too long since I last saw you! I can't believe you're joining Hogwarts this year, we're going to have so much fun!" Pansy turned her constrictive hug onto Octavia. Draco knew that Pansy was a bit like an older sister to Octavia, spending a lot of time at the manor and being one of the only girls she'd interacted with. It really spoke about how much Octavia cared for Pansy that she smiled after nearly being strangled. Then Pansy turned back to Draco.
Once he'd made it he peered through the window. The two boys inside were sitting on a pile of sweets and were exchanging chocolate frogs. Draco never liked chocolate frogs much. He didn't like food that moved, and was never one for collecting cards. Harry just laughed at something Weasley had said, and Draco couldn't help but feel bitter about it. He stomped those feeling down and entered with a blank face.
“I mean, the biggest issue seems to be everyone thinking that you wanted this, and are being a smug little bitch about it.” Potter scowled. “Which you obviously aren’t being!” Draco defended. “But that’s the story going around. To stop that misconception, you’d have to be
Once he made it back to Neville's carriage, he saw that Hermione was in there as well, looking to be chatting his poor ear off.
Every head in the room turned silently to face the fourth year sat at the Gryffindor table. Octavia glanced at Draco. His eyes were wide and stuck on the boy who lived, focused like never before. He had an oddly blank expression, one where his thoughts could be racing or quiet and slow. No one could tell.
“I am certainly not pretty!” Draco spluttered when he was greeted to a large arm being swung round his shoulder.
Which we should be doing as well boys, you're going to miss the train!" He turned around to see a group of redheads coming over to the Platform. There were four boys, all with trolleys, a little girl, and a plump and bright woman, who he assumed was the mother. The oldest boy looked confident, while the one closest to Draco's age looked a bit nervous. The middle children looked to be identical twins, and both wore unnervingly similar mischievous expressions.
”Hello Harry!" An airy and delighted voice greeted me from behind. I leaned back over the back of the sofa to see Luna smiling at me sweetly, knitting needles and wool in hand.
At the group's questioning look, he explained. "My siblings and cousins prefer to write a letter each." Terry looked into the sack. Oh sweet! Sugar Quills, my favourite!" In that bag alone, Terry probably had double the amount of letters Draco would get from his father in his lifetime. At the thought of his father and letters, Draco quickly checked the air for any owls that looked like Pluto.
“Professor Karkaroff vill be clucking soon, ve should all return to the ship.” Viktor gestured to the group of students to hustle them along.
Hopefully, if they all played it off and acted cool, they could present the sunglasses as a new motif for their gang.
Blaise leant towards Draco. “Who ever said anything about eloping? Our ceremony shall be loud and proud.” He embraced Pansy and rested his head on hers.
"Uh, Hermione? As much as I like listening to you two talk about libraries, We kind of need to get to History of Magic in 10 minutes." Neville told the bushy haired girl.
"- And as it turns out, they haven't even recorded all of the possible secret rooms and passageways in the castle, and that new ones are discovered and kept secret as each school year goes by, so there's a good chance that we could find one. Of course, I won't have the time, as I'll be learning as much as I can about the wizarding world. I need to know the laws, it's full school curriculum, how it transfers to the huma- I mean the 'muggle' world. I want to know the origins of wizardry, and how you've managed to keep it so secret. I'm guessing there's a memory spell, because you can't keep an entire world a secret without making some slip ups, right?"
He tried to move closer to whatever he was leaning on to block out the pounding in his head, but that only made the giggling louder. He scowled.
"Calm yourself Potter. Besides, it's probably time for bed. I'm absolutely exhausted, for one," and he began swishing his wand about to unpack all of his bags, Virgo resting on his unarmed arm. I agreed with the decision, and began to unpack my things aswell.
"Welcome to Hogwarts." Mcgonogall's voice broke through the chatter. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room." This whole talk was simultaniously making Draco feel more excited and more nervous. He would be in Slytherin, and his father had already explained the way the dorms worked and how he would be at the top of the class hierarchy because of his family's wealth and prestige.
Octavia was pretty sure Draco had died three times over from both shame and embarrassment before he went to bed. She wasn’t surprised though.
"Awww," a coo interrupted them. "So sweet. I'm glad you two have made up. At least now there's another person who knows about the 'muggle' world in our group. Neville doesn't even know what a microwave is!" Hermione said.
"Well what was I supposed to do? You were acting suspicious, and in the end you were up to something!" I pointed out.
Moody went on to review their previous years, and how they were very behind on curses. At that, Draco heard some Slytherins scoff. Their tight knit group all had access to their many mansion’s libraries, all filled to him with text on curses and dark magic. Sure DADA helped in practicality and mindset, but little with teaching them spells they didn’t already know. Many already had a step above the other houses. No doubt the Ravenclaws did as well, but they probably weren’t as familiar with the Dark Arts as Slytherin was. Something to do with morality and whatnot.
"You've never cared about your hair before mate, and then you've gone and bought a girl's shampoo? Are you a poofter or something?" Before I could defend myself, Malfoy has swooped in and snatched the bottle from Ron's hands. He took the bag away from Ron, but the bottle back in and tossed it behind him, where it landed right side up beside the armchair. He bent down to eye level where Ron was sitting, a somehow calm yet angry look on his face, an expression that made everyone feel off put and uneasy.
“Well...it definitely cant be those last two,” with a quick glare from Draco, Blaise put his hands up in surrender, “I’m sorry but its true. That’s where you get most of your laughs from. Where your creativity shines. Your incredible and witty insults.” Draco rolled his eyes but felt secretly pleased. “And what do you mean you have too much to do?”
“I know about sex, Draco.” He spat out his water, causing Pansy and Blaise to burst out laughing. Greg and Vince didn’t, however, and instead looked at Octavia with similar horror.
Draco was bored. “Oh. All that transfiguration so you could dress as a muggle. Good to know my work was put to good use.” He walked into the now free bathroom to change.
"Well if isn't Pansy, Draco and lil' Octi." He ruffled her hair. She scowled up at him and smoothed down her hair. Draco heard her mutter 'I'm not lil' and muffled a laugh.
“No need for a reminder, I only wanted to see if you needed help.” He bowed his head and her coos heightened in pitch.
"Uh huh, sure, and I'm the Queen of England. You're not as quiet as you like to think you are Potter, that invisibility cloak doesn't cover up sound you know." He said conversationally. By this point my face must have been bright red as I pouted.
The mother and the daughter looked to be bickering slightly, while the twins appeared to be 'consoling' the nervous boy, not very well by how his expression was growing more fearful.
Blaise waggled his eyebrows. “Filthy in the good way, my friend.” Draco gagged in disgust as he waved the other boy away.
"Oh yeah, you're that Pureblood kid who was meant to be in Slytherin. My dad says that every single Malfoy has been a Slytherin since the beginning. He also said that they've all been ponces. That's pretty rough buddy." Michael didn't seem to be saying any of this with malice, just a bit of pity.
"Well, if you were to wear green then it'd have to match those eyes that everyone's always going on about. And this is only dark green, and your eyes are emerald green, so it just looks tacky," he circled me like a shark. "And furthermore, this shirt isn't even your blasted size, it's far too big, and is practically falling off of one shoulder, even though this material is supposed to be form fitting. Let me check the size." And in an instant he was behind me, tugging at the back of the shirt for a label.
“You do tend to go overboard.” He dug into his pocket and pulled out a sugar quill, which he then snapped in half. “Here,” he offered her one half, “to the Malfoy siblings.”
Through her maddened giggles, she just pointed at the sofa. “My stupid brother’s canoodling with Harry Potter!” She exclaimed, maybe sounding a little bit like a loon, but Martha started giggling with her. Even Danny joined in when he saw, but he seemed to find anything affectionate hilariously disgusting.
“That’s not a girlfriend/boyfriend nickname, thats a childhood one.” Draco points out and Pansy pouts.
"I'm Octavia Malfoy, and I'm guessing you're Harry Potter, huh?" Octavia asked the speccy git, raising an eyebrow.
He also had a developed curiosity. He wanted to know how everything worked, he wanted to know the answer to all of the biggest questions. What was the meaning of life? How did we get here? Why are humans social creatures? Is God real? His favourite questions often referred around the forbidden topic; Muggles. They were strange creatures.
“It clicks.” She agrees. She groans again. “He’s so into Potter it hurts. And so into Viktor Krum too!”
"Horrible. Well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are the worst, though. I wish I had siblings." Harry looked envious of Ron.
Viktor snorts. “Please, I doubt any of you have ever tried some good rakia.” He tells them. “Our country’s’ speciality. Tastes better if you brew it at home. Or at school.” He smirked and Draco listened with wide eyes.
“Are you certain ve should? If she is close with Harry Potter, she might not vant to help another champion.” Viktor held his hands uncertainly. Draco waved it off and breathed in again.
“Is that ungratefulness I’m hearing?” Aunt Bella smiled threateningly. Draco shook his head rapidly. “I thought not. My little Draco, I have given you the privilege of not needing to deal with the hardships of life. I keep you here to protect you. I stole you away out of the beauty in my heart, knowing you’d be far happier with me than if you were raised with your disgusting traitor parents.” She spat the last word with venom.
“That’ll be the hangover. First one?” Draco asked jollily, as if he didn’t experience his first proper hangover earlier that morning.
“Not you lot.” He walked back into the middle of the stage with his microphone. “Anyone in first, second and third year will now be moved back to their rooms. Snape is probably out of it, so as long as you’re relatively quiet, you can continue to party. Watch the things you watch on your black boxes, play dress up with each other, go in each other’s dorms, I don’t care. But you can’t stay here.” He announced, trying to regain his dignity.
"We were just doing a spell to get back Neville's pet toad." Draco explained. He then turned to Neville. "Can I move into your carriage? Some people in mine are rather...rather rude." Neville's face lit up.
After a lot of shrieking, Greg finally let Octavia down from his shoulder and everyone sat down in the carriage.
The other people in the box heard her, and turned to see the hilarious situation. The three weirdos started laughing as Ludo Bagman said "Now we can't have that! Someone slap the referee!" Sounding amused.
It was almost 7pm and Aunt Bella still hadn’t returned from her rounds yet. Apparently she was collaborating with some other death eaters to take down some nay sayers. Her plan had really reached it’s penultimate stage, and they were incredibly close to allowing the Dark Lord to be reborn. They were putting together a Regeneration Potion and desperately needed Harry Potter’s blood. They had not yet captured him, and were growing very desperate.
“Promiscuous girl, wherever you are. I'm all alone, and it's you that I want.” He pointed to her again and this time made an hourglass shape with his hands.
Draco didn't care about his bleeding arms. He could not let another book fall. He had just barely managed to steady himself and the books and held on to them with a sigh of relief. Until Lucius stepped in.
"I guess I have more self control than those nitwits. And they're not that pretty." He shrugged, and Octavia agreed.
He didn’t know why he had these moments, these breakdowns. He’d read a pamphlet or two on PTSD, but shook it off. He wasn’t traumatised, he was FINE. It was all fine. He was just dramatic.
Where they truly got to excel though, was when muggle elec-torn-iks became part of the party, with the films and music. It confused so many people, and Octavia felt special to have Danny to explain things to her personally. It was very interesting and complex and only made her feel all the smarter.
On another note, don’t you think it’s a little rude that Potter is his arch nemesis, but Draco isn’t his. I mean, because of all that Voldemort stuff that’s going on, Draco’s probably only his SECOND worst enemy! Can you believe it! After all he goes through the make Potter’s school years living hell, which he never fails at every single day, making sure Potter knows how much he hates him through snide comments and well designed pranks, and suddenly the Dark Lord or whatever swoops in at the end of the year and takes all the credit for ruining Potters school life! At most it was a “team effort” but Voldemort didn’t do shit. Especially last year, Draco thinks something else weird and traumatising happened to Potter at the end of third, but it’s hard to keep up. Especially when you’re sporting a wound like Draco was.
And it isn’t weird to know a lot of facts about Potter! Such as his entire timetable, or that his favourite subject is Defence Against the Dark Arts, or that his favourite food is treacle tart, or that he’s allergic to strawberries, or that his favourite colour is red, or that his middle name is James, or that his wand is a holly Phoenix feather core, or that he enjoys long walks on the beach, or any of that! It isn’t weird! It’s called *knowing your enemy* and it’s perfectly reasonable considering he’s Draco’s arch nemesis. Keep your friends close, stalk your enemies closer and all that.
"Draco, that was incredible!" Hermione said to him, eyes shining. "That was the most impressive magic I've ever seen! You were only suppose to lift the feather, but you lifted the desk! And no one got hurt at all!"
“But you know what else Potter gets?” Blaise unceremoniously interrupted the three, looping Potter’s other arm with his, causing a four person chain. “Karaoke. You were brilliant at Backstreet Boys songs, we’ve got to do that again sometime! I’m thinking Christmas.” Potter smiled awkwardly.
"Go. To bed." Draco was cut off. He flushed and looked down, walking into the tent. Octavia followed him.
“Drako! I-I-I- ‘ave failed! I am no longer a man!” He let out a soft sob into an extremely uncomfortable looking Draco’s chest. Draco pat the boy’s back awkwardly and averted his gaze anywhere else, with the faraway look of someone who desperately wanted to dissolve into the tiled floor.
After many twists and turns around the castle, we'd reached the classroom. I sat down on a seat in the back and Neville sat next to me, tucked into the corner. Miss Lou Freebush hadn't noticed us walking in, and kept her back to us while scrawling on the chalkboard.
"You are excused to study your new books. I have shown you mercy this time, the least you could do it gather any intelligence or common sense."
Definitely share this with anyone you think would enjoy it so I can bask in that sweet sweet attention. I didn’t write way too many words for nothing!
“Okay, I won’t tell anyone.” Blaise crossed his heart and Draco nodded again satisfactorily. “You wanna know a secret about me?” He asked.
“The uh, the person is awake...” the boy tells him. Sirius looks at him sleepily and then turns to Draco. His eyebrows raise.
After they both ate their ‘barely acceptable but not worth killing Kreacher over’ soup, Aunt Bella went right into birthday talk.
“I also have a couple of ideas for a Halloween party. One very important one being alcohol.” Blaise bounced his eyebrows and Draco bopped him on the head.
“Who are you, and what are you doing here?” Draco grit, struggling slightly to keep the person there. The intruder met his eyes and Draco couldn’t help but feel like he recognised them from somewhere. The person was taller than Draco and had grey eyes, with long black hair tied in a loose ponytail. They were wearing a leather jacket and large black boots that kept on trying to step on Draco’s feet.
"Hold on a minute, that lad's Malfoy? What's with the glamour and black hair?" Dean questioned confusedly.
Draco chuckled. “I never cursed Potter, Moody just thought I did. That’s why he transfigured me into a ferret. And Octavia did threaten to curse Moody, my knight in shining armour.” He lifted his head up and smiled at he and she blushed happily.
They continued to walk with the golden trio, the atmosphere very awkward and stilted. Draco was trying to pretend they didn't exist, while Octavia was interviewing them one by one. Then she got to Potter.
"Malfoy?! Out of the way Arthur!" ordered a cold, curt voice. He felt his Stupefy being lifted, but before he could enjoy being able to move, he was dragged upward by his pajama top by none other than a Mr Crouch. Draco froze in fear. "A Malfoy, huh? I don't suppose you know anything about the Dark Mark that appeared here, do you?" Draco grimaced and stayed silent. "DO YOU?!" He was shaken by the shoulders and yelped at the painful grip.
I tumbled out of bed and onto the floor blindly, the sun streaming through the window not helping one bit. From the carpet I grasped at my dresser, squinting angrily when I couldn't locate my glasses. I heard a soft snort from across the room.
According to his father they were nothing more than insects. They were dirt to be stepped on, and Muggleborns were no different. But why don't Wizards communicate with Muggles? Is it for the Muggle's safety, or for the Wizards? Why is it so bad if a Muggle discovers magic exists? Muggles have survived for so long without magic and yet they seem so advanced. Does this mean that magic is potentially a crutch for Wizards to stop them from reaching their full potential? And they must be special to be able to birth magic children without being Pureblood. Does this mean that they are like wizards? Or are they a descendant of a squib with magic still in their veins? Why does this exclude Muggleborns from being as important as Purebloods? Why the inequality?
“Hello Potter...” he reclaimed his headspace and smirked again. “Do you remember Margaux?” He presented the girl, “she was the Beauxbatons girl I was, according to you, Weasley, ‘wasting my time talking to’.” At that, all 12 girls turned to the weasel with annoyance or disgust.
“Thank you, Malfoy, so much, for painting me that amazing picture. It’s a wonder you aren’t a motivational speaker.”
I walked through the door and a little bell jingled above me. I looked around the shop to take the small space in.
"Definately! As long as you think I won't crush you..." She wiped away the tears that hadn't fallen.
"Well, at least now you know what to focus on! Your intention. The object more than the spell. And you've got the spell down perfectly!"
He figured that was safe to tell them. If he didn’t answer any questions they might become a bit mad, and the shield wouldn’t hold forever.
"No time children, gather your belongings." Narcissa ordered them, and Draco immediately packed his satchel. He packed his favourite clothes, his green hat, his Viktor Krum poster and chucked his shoes on. He saw Octavia do the same, prioritising her books over anything else. After they threw on their cloaks, Narcissa dragged them outside the tent, out to the screaming and crying.
After using the hair care, bodywash and what must have been far too much warm water, I stepped out of the shower. I wiped at the fogged up mirror to look at my reflection. My hair was still wet, so I couldn't really see any of the results. I looked down at the pile of clothes I dropped on the floor.
“That’s enough. We had a truce.” Draco rolled his eyes as far as they would go and crossed his arms.
"For your information, Weasel, I bought that for him. I bought all his stuff because we went shopping together today. And I did that, not for an evil plot, but so that Potter can feel good about the way he looks. So we bought clothes and hair products to tame that mane of his and it was all bloody fine and dandy. So forgive me Weasel, I must have missed something, you see, because I cannot for the life of me comprehend how that makes your best gay." He said this all in a monotone yet condescending voice, staring Ron in the eye the whole time. Ron's eyes had begun to shift away from looking Malfoy in the eye, but Malfoy was persistent.
“Are you going to do anything with your hair...” he began to ask and trailed off as he realised Potter’s hair looked the exact same as it usually did. Potter nodded with his realisation.
"She couldn't come with me to King's Cross. Too many people. I said goodbye to her at the Manor." He would miss her so.
“Well I’m not the one who sang karaoke with Blaise.” Draco threw back smugly. If you squinted you could probably see a dust of red on Potter’s dark skin.
He opened heavy book again, and tilted it away from Potter slightly, before opening the smaller one inside so it couldn’t be seen. He wasn’t going to let Potter interrupt his reading.
As suspected, it was a boring class. Since it was the first lesson of the year, it was merely a recap of what they’d learnt last year, with sparce activities. Draco remembered everything from last year anyway, and so burnt through the work assigned. He took out one of his sugar quills and chewed on the end of it absentmindedly, doodling on a sheet of paper. In the doodle, he was flying on his broom against Victor Krum. He then the charmed the paper to make him do a Wronski Feint. He folded it into a paper crane.
"Snape took 5 points from Terry for handflapping." Terry began to look sad. "Which isn't your fault! I cast a containment charm around the potion and you were quite far away from it. It's not your fault that Professor Snape is a grump. You can handflap anytime you'd like." Terry grinned brightly at Draco for this. "But, maybe not in Potions class. Next time the potion sounds annoying, we'll get you some earplugs." Terry nodded with this.
“As it turns out, no.” Harry’s face fell. “I’ll explain in a bit. But first I gotta get this guy into the house and secured.” Harry’s gaze flittered to the side car and he jumped back slightly.
He made the clicking sound with his mouth again and Cushion obediently walked back over to him, wand in mouth. They jumped back up on his lap and Draco, grimacing slightly, craned his neck to take one part of his wand between his teeth. Cushion let go and Draco finally had his wand back! He nearly whooped in excitement.
He fell onto his knees. In the middle of the room. He felt small, like a speck of dust, ready to be blown away. He heard the door open up through the ringing in his ears, but all he could do was let out a sob. The tears kept welling up and falling, weighing heavier on his cheeks. He curled into a ball and wept, gripping tight, digging his nails into his legs. He bent his head into his knees and sobbed, the floodgates opening.
“And are you not the ‘smoking hot’, ‘breathtaking’, ‘incredibly spicy’ and ‘kissable’ Blaise Zabini?” Draco’s fingers hurt from the overuse of quotation marks. “So are you not going to march up to Nott and get a dance with him? Are you not going to do this confidently and proudly while in that stupid red leather costume I transfigured for you?” Draco ramped up. “Are you going to do that, or are you going to deflect the issue and hide away from your problems like an emotionally constipated toddler?” Blaise snorted at that and Draco grinned.
If he had to choose anyone to be his wife, it’d be Pansy. He hadn’t really fancied any girls, and an evil little voice in his head told him he was broken because of that.
Potter looked even more confused as Draco shoved some alcohol into his arms. “Malfoy, what are you-“
"Tell me about it." Draco mumbled, trying to hide his dread. "Hey, uh, would you two like to see what the library is like at break? I haven't seen it yet and want to see how it compares to the one at the manor."
“Um...” he tried to stall, but Potter had reached over already and was grabbing for the actual book. “Hey!” He tried to bat him away, but not before Potter reached his novel and opened it.
"All my family was in Slytherin, so I have to continue the tradition. Many people mistake Slytherin for being the 'evil' house, because You-Know-Who was in it, but I don't think that's fair. It's not Slytherin's fault he decided to become a crazy psychopathic murderer. His ambition just happened to revolve around taking over the world."
"I hate it when Father has to be such an arse-kisser," Octavia whispered in Draco ear, and Draco had to clap a hand over his mouth to stop himself from laughing.
"Even if I was, it wouldn't matter, because you're coming with me to Hogwarts after holidays. So I can bother you aaaaaaaall yeeeeeaaaaaarr." He teased her resting his arms on her head and she wasn't that short goddamit!
I took out all my anger and frustration at her. I screamed and shouted at her. I ended it all then and there. I made her cry. I packed my bag the same night and spend the last week of summer at Grimmauld Place, tucked up in my room thinking about everything.
"Look, Pansy, I didn't know it would turn out like this! I didn't remember my hair being like this!"
“I have only just turned sixteen, so I am not el-ee-gee-ble yet. I vish I vas. S’e goblet is a great honour.” He looked ashamed.
"As amusing as it is to see you wearing Slytherin colours, Potter, that's the wrong shade of green."
“Language.” Draco admonished out of instinct even though Octavia wasn’t there. “And they won’t kill you if they never find out. Here, take this.” He handed Potter the last hangover potion. Potter eyed it wearily. “I’m to trying to poison you, it’s a hangover potion. It’ll help with the pain.”
“This song is called ‘Promiscuous’. I’m sure you’ve listened to it before.” He could remember some parts, yes. “You sing the parts in blue, I sing the parts in yellow, and we both sing the parts in green. Got it?” He nodded. She smiled. “Try and keep up. We’re going right into it.” She tossed her hair and looked to the screen as a beat began playing.
Octavia nodded. “It’s okay.” She agreed calmly, keeping her excitement contained. Danny’s smile dropped slightly, so Octavia turned back to the glass to avoid his sad puppy eyes. Then she jolted.
“Oh shit! Vince is right, we do! We missed breakfast!” Draco yelled. The entire dorm groaned in disappointment. “AND WE HAVE CLASS IN TEN MINUTES!” The entire dorm jumped out of their beds in a panic, some falling on the floor, and immediately began getting ready.
He dressed in his quidditch shorts and poster-shirt, brushing his arms of some fallen glitter but ultimately making it worse.
“Granger,” he began, “I would like to call a truce with you too.” He offered an open hand for her to shake. She eyed it with contempt.
They left the room deep in conversation, leaving me to pack my school bag alone. I grabbed an inkwell and a quill, some parchment, and the textbooks for the classes I would have that day, before double checking my schedule. DADA for the first two lessons.
"Oh no, this is far too much, this is. It's fine, 'onestly!" Hagrid tried insisting, but Draco insisted more and shoved the coins into a large open hand.
"Can we go pay now, my arms are tired of being your personal shopping bag and holding all of this up," I nodded to my arms packed full of stuff. He nodded and grabbed my arm once again to lead me to the counter, nearly causing me to drop everything.
Pulling himself away from his awe, Draco focused on what that actually meant. He wasn’t in London anymore.
"Great idea duckling! We can bring Andy some fairy cakes! Oh you are so sweet!" She clasped her hands together in excitement. Oh Merlin.
“She is very...dedicated to her studies, as you put it. She’s the top of our class. Right in front of me unfortunately. She good could probably help a great deal with our studying.” Viktor looked at him with apprehension, his large eyebrows furrowing.
The second film they were watching was worse. It was a moving picture, and apparently souls weren’t even connected to them. The faces completely ignored anyone who tried to talk to them, just going on like an actor with a scene.
A they continued, the camp site continued to take on a greener theme, until it was completely covered in green and Irish themed decorations. Octavia grimaced.
"And I intend to! Once I leave Hogwarts I plan to go right to the Ministry and demand to speak to whoever's in charge of Magical Creature Welfare!"
"You have 30 seconds to get to a less populated area before my message plays." Lucius' commanding voice played out. Even in letter form, Draco could sense his anger being held back. The enveloped palyed a counter on it in black ink. Draco clutched the letter and sprinted out of the hall, leaving his breakfast behind.
Everyone seemed to be paying most of their attention towards the champions, even the unofficial one. Which made sense, but little else seemed to be happening apart from swooning over them all. Octavia wondered distantly why Cedric Diggory had been chosen for Hogwarts’ champion. She didn’t really know him, and she highly doubted he was chosen for his fantastically sharp jawline.
They set off where Danny lead them, past the passages to the second year dorms, a couple of lefts then a right, tapping a snake statue on a head with a wand, and turning through a more slimy passageway that opened because of it.
"Draco? Can we go with them?" Octavia asked him quietly. Granger still managed to hear her and turned the three around.
"I might as well have, I didn't want your father to hear about this, did I?" I carried on teasing lightly. He groaned and hid his face in his hands as he leant back onto his bed.
This startled the boy, as did the round of applause that came from the Ravenclaw table. McGonagall took the hat off the boy's head and pushed him towards the Ravenclaw table. He was now in Draco's view and Draco saw his expression grow into a slight panic as he flapped his hands some more. Over the noise he sounded to be clicking his tongue fastly, and his eyes darted about. The boy, Terry, made eye contact with Draco and Draco tried giving him a small smile. The boy bit his tongue and the flapping softened as he sat down. Draco focused his attention back to the sorting.
Draco clasped his hands together nervously, but followed after McGonagall, staying right behind an eager Hermione and right before an anxious Neville.
"How to get onto the Platform?" She asked kindly, the understanding face seeming to be her default. Harry nodded. "Not to worry. All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between Platforms 9 and 10. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous." She turned to Draco. "How about you do it first." She said. "You look smart enough to be an example for how it works". He smiled happily.
"Ah, so nice to see two siblings have wands with something in common. Usually a sign that their bond is very strong." Octavia beamed.
“It’s called offering an olive branch, Potter. Paint it as pity if you’d like, but I need hep getting these bottles back to Slytherin.” He explained snippily. “Are you gonna follow or not?”
With his wand gripped tightly in his hand he began walking. He quickly whispered a muffling charm on his shoes so he could be quieter, but kept his guard up. He walked past some classrooms, but stayed glued to the corners, blending in with the darkness.
Draco Malfoy was in the worst shape of them all, as he’d elected to drink as if he wanted his organs to fail right in front of him. He drank like he was having his arm chopped off and it was the only way to numb the pain. He drank like he had a large infatuation with Harry Potter and wanted to forget all about it.
"It's also supposed to have many ghosts to wander the castle, but the book always described them as adding character to the place rather than being scary. It's all quite medieval, and hasn't really changed since the original Hogwarts House leaders."
“Drako, we ‘eard that you were ‘aving a party with...Sly-the-reen. For the ‘Alloween? No?” Aleksander asked. Draco’s eyes darted to the trio. Granger was looking at him with slight judgement, Weasley with amusement, and Potter with anger. Or, not anger at Draco. At...Dobromir?
At around twelve o’clock he organised himself lunch, purposely avoiding telling Kreacher. He did not feel like talking about anything with that dingy elf. He thought the elf was in the cellars anyway, three floors below. He was a nostalgic old elf, and a cruel one at that. It was his idea of a little joke to take a whole day to clean the cellars, a joke against Draco. ‘It was only right’ that he would, since ‘Master Malfoy would be spending plenty time down there after Mistress Lestrange was done with him’.
Regardless, he opened a scroll of parchment and began to dot down some ideas to how he could use transfiguration spells for torture. That would please Aunt Bella.
"Or drinking that potion! I heard it tastes disgusting!" He shivered in disgust. They grinned at each other in a shared understanding of intelligence and I could just tell this wasn't going to bode well for me nor Ron. Nor anyone else for that matter.
“I won’t tell a member of staff as long as I can attend the party.” He poked a bottle Draco was holding. Draco pulled he bottles he could closer to his chest.
"Ooh yes, like a fashion show! Show us what you have Harry!" Luna joined in excitedly. I sighed long and hard at the knowledge that there's no way I'd be able to get out of it now.
While the seventh and sixth years were at all different stages of absolutely wasted, the fifth and fourths had managed to keep their alcohol intake under better control. Most of them.
His legs are were getting tired so he manoeuvred himself and Blaise onto the floor, hidden inside one of the castle’s many crevices. The music from the Yule Ball was still blasting loudly. Blaise was humming to it.
Leave a kudo, a comment on your feelings, how you’re doing this spooky month, any constructive criticisms, or any prompts! I am very open to prompts!
"Well then, now that I hope you've made it to a more private area, let's talk Draco," Lucius' controlled voice echoed around the room. "I got the oddest letter from that disgusting half-breed 'Professor' Flitwick. Do you know what it said Draco?" Draco clenched his fists and kept his head down. The letter floated above him, talking down to him. "It said that you displayed a great show of magic. That you lifted a desk with 'Wingardium Leviosa' on the first try, instead of a feather. It said that the half-breed would like to personally tutor you in charms. To use your 'potential'. But you know what the most horrific thing that goblin told me?"
She found herself in a large room with four separate beds, each with green bedding. It was then that her exhaustion hit her. Two of the four beds were already taken, so she took the one closest to the corner. One of the girls in the room was Martha Robinson.
They were all becoming rather popular, which was an odd experience by far for Octavia. Martha seemed to be used to it, which made sense since she was so likeable, but Danny tended to shy away from any eyes. Which was rather difficult when his map making gained a rather occult following of students, even some second years.
“I don’t think that’s how fate works. And even if you could affect fate, how does dropping Draco in Potter’s arms do anything?” Blaise shrugged again, that infuriating smirk becoming more infuriating.
“You don’t tell me what I will and won’t do.” She hissed at him and he nodded sombrely. At his somber look, she tapped him on the head. “Don’t look like that Draco,” she stretched the ‘o’,” I’m not the bad guy.” She pinched the same cheek she slapped. His cheek felt like it would soon bruise. “I shall be pitiful. I’ve always had a soft spot for begging.” She smiled and Draco tensed. “Gravibus Artus.” She cast and immediately Draco’s every limb felt twice as heavy. Even keeping his head up seemed like a struggle.
"I'll help you find him then. I'm Draco, what's your name?" Draco asked, holding out a hand for the boy to take.
"Mother, how about I walk you to your room." Draco offered his arm. She took it happily and leapt from her chair, her nightgown flowing in the breeze. The rain had stopped by now so he clicked his fingers.
"Like sugar quills you will!" The cart laughed, encouraging Draco to continue. "I'm serious! There's no chocolate frogging way you'll be using blood lollipop damned swear words in that mother-fudgeing school! You hear me?" Octavia couldn't stop giggling, making Draco smile. Draco put his head back on Pansy's lap.
He tried to do it subtlety with Greg and Vince, sending a small jinx towards Greg so that he’d wake up without being embarrassed. He gave them some awkward privacy before deigning the both of them with hangover potions.
"Nonsense! I'm sure you are! First, let's check your pronounciation. Tell me the spell name." Draco go right down to business. On the other table, Hermione sat down and began practicing it herself on heavier items.
"Why did you take the blame for it? I know you wouldn't have made that mistake, so why subject yourself to Snape's wrath?" Draco asked him, Anthony and Terry nodding to this.
"Microwaves aside, we should probably go to Transfiguration." Hermione said, packing away the book she was practising with.
She wasn’t very sporty, so she never played. That got rid of those losses. She didn’t play many games either. She was careful not to commit too much to her school work, and seeing Dumbledore’s favouritism from day one, she prepared herself for the inevitable House cup loss.
"Gah!" Neville yelled out suddenly as a toad flew past Draco and into his face. "Trevor! Don't run - or I guess hop - off again! I couldn't find you for forever! How did you get out of your box?" Neville scolded the toad on his face. Draco nearly snickered at the display, but kept it in.
"Ha! I wish I could do that with one look! I'm glad you think I'm persuasive though, that's how I'll become Prime Minister," she laughed.
“Aw, thank you Greg! You’re so sweet!” Greg flushed light pink and Vince scowled slightly. “But you forgot that we now have our local fashionista with us. She’ll be able to make you look gorgeous for whatever event it is. Won’t you, Via?”
Draco pondered these questions often. He searched the mansion's library for answers time and time again, but always came up naught. His only hope was Hogwart's course of Muggle studies. He should probably prepare a list of questions to ask the teacher. School was in less than a month after all. He should ask father when to go shopping for his supplies. He needs enough time to pack and prepare his things.
“Blaise you idiot, what the hell? That wasn’t funny, that was painful and dumb and rude et si irresponsable, pourquoi avez-vous pour moi un tel co tout le temps, je me fiche de votre flirt, mais cette fois c'est allé trop loin. Alors arrêtez d'être un tel diable spawn pendant cinq minutes pendant que je suis arrivé à l'infirmière, s'il vous plaît!” He yelled at Blaise, the boy still grinning like a motherfucker next to Octavia. Potter was still staring at him. “You can go now Potter. Blaise will only try and drag you into something else stupid.” The boy flushed and nodded, speed walking in the opposite direction.
"They looked creepy. The faces wouldn't stop smiling. I was just trying to eat and this man in Shoulder pads came up to and tried to chat. It was weird and he wouldn't leave me alone. Luna didn't help!" He narrowed his eyes at her. "She was just watching with a smile on her face. She tried to give him my number!" I glanced at Luna and she shrugged with a smug little smile.
“Pfft, okay.” He did! Every time the book turned to a sex scene he just flicked through uninterestedly until it was over and back to romance. He admittedly did love romance novels, especially the enemies to lovers trope. He adored the slow burn, but hated the characters obliviousness. Like come on! It was so obvious they have feelings for each other! Just kiss already!
"If you aren't wanting to put in that much time and effort, then I would suggest a small File Department heist. This would include changing the laws from the very inside. It would be done by stealing a key from a lower class worker of the Ministry who's in Silver Law Paperwork, breaking through the advanced safety wards with a tiny bit of dark magic, using Sinseng worms to rid the House Elf Silver Law of whatever you don't like on it (by eating the strong magic trace), and using a quill to simply fill in the blanks with whatever you prefer."
“I’ll tell you another time. Right now, I have a question for Draco.” Draco looked at him with a look that could kill. “How did it feel to be wrapped up in Potter’s big strong arms? Did it feel safe?” He batted his eyes and leaned over Draco, while Draco now looked like he was ready to kill Blaise with his own two hands, his face blotched an embarrassed red.
The picture movie was called ‘Scooby Doo on Zombie Island’ and had a talking dog. It was really weird, and Potter was getting oddly invested in the drawings. For all he knew about the tely-vision, he didn’t seem to have used it that much.
"But sir, it was me who had that job. I didn't do it well enough. I'll take her to the nurse." He lied to Snape's face.
Octavia debated with herself with a few seconds before deciding to go after him. She had a lot of questions about him. He was becoming friends with her older brother, she better at least know that he’s not going to mess. Or that if he does, he knows he’s going to get the hexing of his life.
“What?” He spluttered. “Martha’s doing it!” Octavia turned around and sure enough, Martha was already drooling over the students.
"Hey, uh, I'm Michael, and this is Anthony," a tall boy gestured behind him to where another boy stood. "These three are having a bit of a tiff over dorms so can we share with you guys?" He asked Draco and Terry. Draco peaked behind the other boy to the argument going on. Looked really annoying to get in the middle of. He gave a questioning glance to Terry and watched as he gave a thumbs up in response.
" I kind of like the idea of dating someone who's your opposite but understands you. It would at least give you some interesting conversations." I nodded along.
“No talking for a minute please, Auntie’s had a rough day at work.” A tired look went over her. “And of course I will be needing to shop for more food soon, around disgusting ministry lovers, oh shite.” She hissed.
Woah I am so sorry I honestly thought this would be out sooner. I started writing the chapter but it came out way longer than intended (because at first this chapter was supposed to include the Halloween party) so instead I’ll post that next week as a gift.
“Who is that?” Viktor asked, pointing ahead of him. Draco turned round to search for the target. His eyebrows raised in shock when he saw them.
"And so in conclusion Potter," Malfoy titled his head with a tight smile, his face coming closer to mine. "YOU ARE THE RICHEST MAN IN ALL OF BRITAIN!" I was not expecting that exclamation.
Her smiled politely as Neville and then turned her eyes onto me. Her gaze was strong and piercing and made me want to shuffle in my skin. My lowered her eyelids and grinned predatorially.
“What happened to your dreadlocks?” Draco asked, pointing to where one seemed to be heavily frayed and ripped. Blaise (
Once they got there, Madame Pomfrey diagnosed him with a broken leg and a possible concussion, all while cursing about
first of all, id just like the apologise for not updating right after trying to establish an update schedule, that was stupid.
They both spoke at the same time. They turned back to each other before rushing out the door to meet them.
He doesn't stop running until he gets to a clearing and sees some tents. He can hear many mothers calling frantically, but then he hears his own.
The group were discussing the charms homework that Draco had already done, so in his boredom he looked up towards the Gryffindor table. Potter and Weasley were looking at some homework.
“Did you jus’ call me Drake?” Draco asked him, slurring slightly. Blaise loosened his hand in Draco’s grip.
“Yes, that, so you cant summon him. And it’s considered very rude to just summon the dead out of nowhere! The dead who can be summoned all had pretty traumatic deaths, so I wouldn’t bother them. Purgatory is far better than you kids wanting a scare!” Greg continued to scold the kids. The girl who’d raised the board tried to hide it inconspicuously behind her back.
“You wouldn’t be saying that if it were Viktor Krum trying to get in your pants.” Draco nearly kicked Blaise off the bed and his face darkened.
“Oh...brilliant...just what I wanted...” Potter says, only making it more difficult for Draco to conceal his laughter.
I laughed. "Yeah I'm doing okay, although I'm being forced to buy a new wardrobe in Hogsmeade by Malfoy here," I answered, gesturing to where Mlafoy was stood awkwardly behind me. Seamus broke the embrace to gape at Malfoy.
Gale and Rowan were regarded as some of the best known Wizards in 11th Century France. Gale excelled in charms and Rowan excelled in potioneering, both helping the muggle community secretly while in La Rochelle.
Taking my eyes off him, I went over to my wardrobe to pick out an outfit. I grimaced slightly while looking at the ugly small pickings. Even after everything, I was still scrawny enough to fit into some of Dudley's old clothes, sometimes to the point where they could still hang off of me. I picked out a red shirt that was nearly sliding off my shoulder and a pair of grey joggers, taking advantage of the new ability to wear casual clothing around the castle. I put on a pair of black trainers and grabbed my hoodie from where it was curled up in the corner of the wardrobe.
“Absolutely plastered. How much alcohol did you drink?” Blaise asked him. Draco hummed into his shoulder.
Draco had felt on edge since the Quidditch World Cup. And he didn't like it. It felt wrong for him to be this worried all the time, constantly having to know that Octavia's fine and isn't going to be taken to Azkaban because of some thing their father did. And he kept imagining what it'd be like to have the Dark Mark on his arm, the disgusting symbol a dark contrast to his pale skin, so clear, so obvious...
“Shhhhhh, yes you are darling, now be still while your incredible girlfriend Pansy works her magic.” Draco had no choice but to give in.
“Take a look at the paper Weasley,” he snatched it out of Blaise’s grip to brandish it, “your dad has a front page feature.”
He looked to the cat in the sidecar. It was as pink as the pillow had been, and the fur looked a bit matted. It had a squashed face and lazy eyes, and the triangles that were supposed to be it’s ears were too big for it’s head.
“That’s what Ron said.” Draco sneered in disgust at the thought of having anything in common with Weaselbee.
"However, you seem confused at my request. But I can't see how that could be. I specifically remember ordering you to memorise all 25 of the Pureblood laws. Completely. In and Out. Back. To. Front. And if you can't recite them backwards, then are you saying that you disobeyed me? That you enjoy disappointing your parents and your heritage? Is that what you are trying to communicate through those Abraxas forsaken stutters?" He circled his son, his cane raised threateningly, daring the boy to breath out of line.
“A lot of practice and research. We’re nearly there. I’d try a Lumos.” They lit their wands to guide them through the darkened passageway, the eeriness feeling truly Halloween.
“Magic.” Draco answered shortly, causing Potter to snort. “And it’s my turn to ask the questions. Why are you here?”
“Trust me, I’m not very desperate to shake your slimy Mudblood hand either.” He said, flinching as Potter gasped next to him.
“A truce.” Potter sticks out his hand at Draco and Draco stares at it. He feels a strange sense of deja vu.
He rolled his eyes and sat down on one of large velvet green chairs that lay in the common room, shooing away the nosy Slytherins. He spotted Amanda Green writing frantically in her large pink fluffy book, a book she dubbed her personal ‘Gossip Column’.
I’m sorry if I haven’t picked your prompts, just keep commenting to remind me rip I am sorry 😭 I will get round to them eventually. I hope you have a nice day and stay tuned for the next chapter of Double Trouble!
They were currently showing off things that looked like books, but had no pages. All plastic. They had weird covers on them that the fourth year, Abi, was explaining. They were apparently ‘Videos’ and scary ‘movies’. Whatever they were, they drew in quite a crowd, and any muggleborns who knew about them were clamouring to decide which one they would put in the ‘DVD Player’. It was all very confusing to the many purebloods who watched the scene with poorly hidden distaste and curiosity.
After I put it on, I threw open the curtain to pose to my bored audience. As soon as he saw me awaiting comments, he started snickering.
"The Potter family riches ring any bells?" I thought back to my vault full of gold in Gringotts. Sure, it was a lot of money, but it didn’t have 250 thousand Galleons. So I said as much.
He chose Hogwarts Houses And Their Meaning to read next. It was rather compelling, and he got bit distracted from what he was looking for as he read over the Founders' lives, trials and tribulations, and how they chose their animals. After he'd gotten to the 79th page he realised there wasn't a whole lot on if the sorting hat were to make a mistake, and was more focused on the house trait origins instead of how someone is sorted. Another unfortunate dud. At this point it was getting rather late in the night but Draco powered on.
Draco looked scandalised. “I thought you didn’t actually read it!” He hissed. “That’s a grown up book!”
“This is why I didn’t talk about her, because you’d butt heads! Now go away! Leave me be!” Via told him, trying to push away by his back.
“Let me see the news, wont you?” Blaise scanned the front page and then let out a laugh. “Have you seen this? The Weasleys are at it again. Particularly Arnold Weasley...isn’t he the dad?”
"I've liked Quidditch since I was a baby, because of Diana always needing someone to play with. She's the oldest so we all do what she says. I have 4 brothers, 4 sisters, and 6 cousins who stay with us, so now that Diana's gone there should be the perfect about of people for a game of Quidditch, but my brothers are always ruining it. They do every penalty they can, Blatching, Blurting, Haversacking, and Quaffle-pocking. The only reason we haven't done any Stooging is because I balance it out. I'm fairly certain my cousin Barnie invented a type of cheat where you hit the Bludger into the Snitch before the Seeker catches it, breaking the Snitch and their arm," he rambled on in an odd monotone. Draco listened with fascination. He'd never known somebody could have so many siblings! And cousins too!
The week after the Quidditch World Cup was...weird. Narcissa had become quite paranoid and over protective, checking on both of her children every couple of hours to know that they were still in the manor. Octavia tried not to blame her mother, but it was becoming quite suffocating.
Speaking of, Potter really ought to eat some more. He’s terribly skinny and thin all the time, and he comes back from the summer holidays looking practically starved. Makes Draco wonder what that muggle family are feeding him. Or maybe he just has a high metabolism like Draco, and Draco isn’t one to judge something that he has. He’s many things, a fashion icon, a Slytherin , a bully, a star quidditch player, the heir to an enormous fortune, a bitch, but Draco is not a hypocrite.
“Perhaps not, but I can throw my charm! Speaking of,” his voice lowered, “‘Ow are you, pree-tee boy?” It took Draco a second before he realised that the comment was aimed at him. He immediately felt his face going red.
“Okay so if you see here, the most common first tasks that have been held are ones including large magical creatures. They are usually held in Durmstrang or Mahoutokoro due to their extensive Care of Magical Creatures curriculum, but it wouldn’t be that surprising for Hogwarts to indulge. So while we do more research, I believe you should focus on your offensive magic, maybe some darker defensive spells, and larger displays of- are you listening?” Draco stopped his lecture as he noticed that Viktor was looking past his book at another side of the library.
"Yeah, Malfoy took one look at my wardrobe and took me shopping. I think he's trying to give me a full makeover, because he bought hair products and makeup as well." She tilted her head curiously.
"It's called improvising and being creative. Not all students get a new adventure or mystery to solve each year, so to entertain ourselves in the Slytherin common rooms we'd have competitions of who could make up the best insult, or threat, or who could collect the most abstract thing from one of the houses dormitories."
“That would be okay if I trusted you, but due to you doing nothing that would ever make me believe that you wouldn’t go off tattling to your kidnapper-“
“I’m going to, ah, go. To the common room. Now.” He told the group before grabbing his bag and leaving.
“Well I should expect so, I brewed it.” Draco bragged slightly, pleased with the surprised look Potter gave him. Then Potter snickered.
"Hey there, the name's Michael! Herbology expert and bad boy extrordinaire!" Michael introduced himself to Neville with a completely straight face. Anthony snorted out a laugh.
He was so busy he even forgot to worry about the upcoming DADA lesson with Professor Completely Effing Mad!
“Excellent!” He called out over the great hall in delight. “Well, we now have our three champions. I am sure I can count upon all of you, including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster. By cheering your champion on, you will contribute in a very real-“ he cut himself off. Or, rather, the goblet did.
"Okay then, we can leave the warmth." He agreed reluctantly, with a hint of a whine. I tried to get up to grab my satchel off of the edge of my seat when I realised that Malfoy was still grabbing my hand.
The way to go that Draco always thought about was jumping off his broom. He’d take it onto the quidditch field at night, fly it high into the clouds, and then he’d fall off. He thinks that’d be a nice way to go, to get to fly one last time. If he fell back first then that meant that the last thing he’d see would be a starry sky at Hogwarts.
“I think calling me Octi is bad enough.” Octavia rolls her eyes. At a concerned look from her boys Greg and Vince, she takes it back. “Not from you two! I don’t mind when my favourite brothers call me it. Just when it’s these three awful ones.”
“Sure, you do that.” Just as he took another bite of toast, Viktor Krum sat next to him and Draco nearly choked. He was definitely not used to Krum being in school. Definitely not.
“It’s too early to do anything.” He looked across the room and saw that he was one of the first awake. Theo had fallen asleep on Blaise’s lap, both of them hogging the armchair. Pansy was snoring into a sofa cushion, legs bent at an angle Draco didn’t deem normal. Greg and Vince were leaning on each in other in a manner Draco hoped wasn’t similar to how he had leaned into Potter.
This one moment where Potter is ever so carefully holding Draco’s face in his hands to try and get his glasses back, and his thumb has gently (and probably accidentally) caressed Draco’s cheek and his pine eyes are squinting and Draco is blushing while wearing those stupid specs, feeling embarrassed but also never more cared for and loved and cherished them if he can have that one stupid little moment then Draco will be happy.
But he had to admit, it didn’t look half as bad as he thought it would. But why was Blaise walking backwards?
"It's only a little bit further," she pointed to a red, green and white flag fluttering a ways away, "and I remember the path back to our tent."
He thought he heard a noise, like a footstep, near the Gryffindor entrance and assumed McGonagall. He spun round in fear, gripping his wand tightly. After a quick check around the area and not seeing anyone, he continued on his way.
Thank you for making it to the end I am so sorry for the wait! The next chapter is all planned out, I’m even constructing a playlist (90s songs yay) so I’m getting back on my feet.
Immediately stars of all different sizes filled the ceiling above my bed, now having more than Malfoy did previously. I mumbled a "thanks" and watched as he nodded and returned back to bed.
In the hallway of the train, Draco walked. He wasn't looking for anything or anyone, he just wanted to get away from that awful Weasley. So lost in his own thoughts, Draco almost fell over a student who was crouched down on the floor.
"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can." Draco caught her glancing at Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear. Instinctively Draco went in front of him and immediately starting smarting him up, refastening his cloak properly, and smoothing out the creases. He'd had practice from Narcissa's many questionable fashion choices over the years so he was adept at making Neville look more suitable. Hermione watched all this with a smirk.
“I made them up. I actually had a pretty boring summer, so I wanted to make up something to sound more interesting...so I lied.” Blaise stared intently at his lap. Draco cocked his head.
He tried to coax Draco out of his hideaway space, and with unfortunate success. Potter lead him out from his enclosure and into the main body of the library with the desks. Where Granger was.
So that was how I spent my evening. Modelling my many items and clothing pieces for Luna and Hermione. Well, when the other option was getting in between Malfoy and Ron's stubbornness and bringing up our various issues, I was more than happy to go with the safer and less emotionally draining option.
He felt lightheaded and heavy at the same time. Every word had hit it. His brain felt like a hailstorm, words like pebbles of rain racing around his mind, battering against the walls of his head. He faintly heard someone knocking at the door of the classroom but he didn't care. He couldn't breath.
“No no no, it is not that, I just thought it’d be nice to have a pet, like a normal child-“ that was the wrong thing to say, that was the wrong thing to say-
"Are you alright Mother?" Draco began looking her over slightly. She nodded and handed him an ice cream.
Getting sick of only seeing things through a sack, he awkwardly twisted himself to tear the sack off using his feet. Cushion the cat jumped on his lap as he contorted himself. After a minute off struggling it was torn off and he was greeted to his surroundings.
“Yeah, my older brother Draco. He’s in fourth year and really good at magic. So, you know, he can help me.”
"Oh, uh...talk to you tomorrow!" Octavia ignored the girl, and turned towards the wall. She had plenty of time to make friends, just not right now. In her little cut off section she changed into her pajamas. She slipped her trunk under her bed and fell onto her pillow.
After more peaceful Transfiguration lesson, there was a couple of hours before dinner. All of the study group (except Harry who said that he'd have to go with Ron, much to Draco's chagrin) slipped their matchstick-needles into their pockets to practice with in the library. All against Hermione's better judgement and fear that they'd get in trouble for stealing. Draco rebutted that they'd already stolen the feathers, and what was a couple of little matchstick?
I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Boy was this a longer one! Ha, that's what she said. Anyway, this chapter did include some Snape hate. So you're going to have to deal with that. Also, sorry if any Americans are confused with the way I spell some things, it's because I'm British. AO3 doesn't see it that way unfortunately.
“Just don’t corrupt Via.” He walked over to her. “Go to bed soon.” He kissed her on the crown of her head and walked off as an indignant blushing mess.
“Maybe the problem comes in me not being a confident slut like you, and if people were to think I shagged someone, they’d assume it was Pansy since she was my date last night.” He shivered. “I do adore Pansy with all my heart but I would never go anywhere with her, ever.”
It was a flash of bright purple, wedged in between some plainer, more subdued tones of fabric on a rack. Like a moth to a lamp, she was drawn to it, grabbing Draco's wrist and dragging him to the rack.
Octavia snorted and crossed her arms. “You do realise that you’re the only one who really cares about that, right?” Draco stuck his tongue out tiredly at her and shakily rose to his feet, a heavy pounding in his head.
“Well it certainly isn’t a Samhain ball.” She squeezes his side. “But doesn’t this seem more fun?” She turned his head to the dancing and singing crowd of kids and his scowl faded somewhat. She squeezed his cheeks. “See you in a bit, I need a drink.” She disappeared through the crowd, leaving Draco a bit confused and feeling awkward. He nearly rubbed at his left forearm again, a stupid habit he’d picked up as of late.
Draco, priding himself in his intelligence and problem solving ability, often struggled with change. Especially a problem he couldn’t solve. Happened when he went to Hogwarts and wasn’t adored constantly, happened after the World Cup after being confronted by Aurors and not knowing how to fix it, and happened when he was very young and Octavia was born. It seemed now was another one of those times. He just could not figure out what was going on with the boy who lived, and this being a great passion of his, he wasn’t handling it.
Narcissa finished quickly, finalising some of the cupcakes with icing butterfly wings which were charmed to flutter. She then set them all up meticulously on a butterfly plate, and carefully carried it outside. Draco fumbled off of his seat and rushed to get an umbrella out of an ugly gnome umbrella stand. She opened it up and held it up above an oblivious Narcissa as she opened the back door.
"No thank you, I am fine." Draco said. His face and voice softened a tad when he saw Harry's expression. "I'll see you when we get to school. Maybe." He looked to Ron. "Weasley." He managed to make it seem like a greeting, a farewell and a slur at the same time, with a careful derision he was rather proud of. He heaved his suitcases out of there and closed the door behind him, his trousers now covered in chocolate stains.
Blaise had helped him eat something occasionally, he even drank some water, which was massive progress. He wouldn’t do much else thought. His entire body felt numb.
The Leprechauns did their bit as Octavia tried not to watch. She was rooting for Ireland, sure, but Leprechauns creeped her out a bit. It didn't stop Draco from whooping and cheering for them, only ignoring what he knew were fake Galleons sprinkled down on the spectators. The Leprechauns went to sit for the match and Ludo continued once again. It was getting to the good stuff.
. “And for what you call my perversion, which is really just my incredible charming skills, I think I’ll keep them around for now. There are many foreign students in need of seducing after all.”
"I don't know about you three, but I'm beat," Michael yawned. "I think I'm going up and going to sleep."
“Hey bros!” She greeted them all. Greg and Vince both looked up at her it’s an elated grin at being referred to as her ‘bros’. “Pansy,” she greeted the girl, “slut.” She greeted Blaise, shushing her brother before he could go off about ‘language’.
“Why are you helping out Potter anyway?” Pansy asked him, dragging the two from their odd little conversation.
“A strong one.” Pansy added. This caused some of the first years to look at each other happily and conspiratorially. Draco narrowed his eyes at the group.
“I am a real grown up!” Pansy whined. “I just said that I am becoming a young lady! I am a lovely young lady right now!” She stomped her foot. “Don’t you want to be grown up?”
The rest of them were scattered around the room, all completely plastered. The room was a complete mess and Draco sighed tiredly.
Octavia scoffed. “That’s my thing. We are way too old to be doing the sibling double act. Get your own idea.”
“No!” And with a snap, Draco felt himself grow back to normal. At least, he hoped it was normal. He tried to right himself but his leg felt like it was sprained. Octavia helped him up and he go to his feet with a wince. He felt like every square inch of him was bruised and he hissed through his teeth. His hair was all over the place and it was then that he realised how many people were around, staring at him. A lot of them grinning. He felt his face grow hot and kept his gaze on the ground, Octavia’s arm awkwardly stretching round his shoulder to keep him upright. He didn't dare look at Potter. He quickly wiped at some stray tears and tried to walk away, but his bad leg gave out on him.
Pansy had gone home for the holidays, and and selfish as it had been, Draco couldn’t stand returning to Malfoy Manor so soon. Even for mother, everything was too painful, and he didn’t want to spend the holidays having panic attacks and living it all in a blur.
"Yeah, besides, Draco's the best at it anyway. His desk was practically touching the ceiling of the charm's classroom." Anthony pointed out. Draco flushed.
“I thought it was nice.” She argued, but she didn’t really. It wasn’t really much of anything. It was just two mouths. But she was grown up now and grown ups did it all the time.
"Potter, do shut up. I am trying to be a good person, and as usual, you are making it difficult. And please, when we get to Hogsmeade, do not call me Malfoy. Call me . . .Tom or something. I've been out of the public's eye for a while now, and don't plan on hopping back into it. So I beg of you, don't be an idiotic Gryffindor and waste what is a fantastic disguise." His poncy voice still rang true and Malfoy, and I nodded in agreement with him.
“Ugh, shit!” He yelled in pain. He pushed upwards on the filthy ground to get back onto his feet. It was then that he heard a yell.
"Oh, alright then, we'd better go! I want a seat at the front. Goodbye Draco, I'll see you in Charms!" Hermione waved him goodbye as she rushed off to class. Neville waved behind as well as followed after Hermione, at a bit of a slower pace.
"Can people stop calling me that! I'm not mini! I'm the average height for my age!" She told them crossly.
"Remember Draco, you are a Malfoy. Act like it." The letter burst into flames and dropped to the floor in a pile of dust.
"Would you like to be in a dorm with me?" Draco asked. Terry made eye contact for a second before looking away.
"Hah, she looks like a mini you! Except, you know, a girl." Octavia's scowl deepened, and her fists clenched tighter. Just at it looked like she was about to punch Weasley, Draco held her hand back.
. "Ron - Hermione -Harry - are you alright? Mister Malfoy?" He questioned, which Draco presumed was being aimed at him. He would have faced Mr Weasley, but he was in the unfortunate predicament of not being able to move.
“I always think about going to a potions shop in Knockturn and taking a whole bunch of sleeping draught vials.” She’d said. “They wouldn’t care, they don’t balance amounts. Then I’d go back to my flat and drink them all. It might take days before anyone finds me, no one would even care. My body would be rotting by then.” She’d told him. Then she had started crying. “I think about it all the time. My body lying there on my carpet, dead as Greg. Only if have no Vince to mourn me.” Then she’d started laughing, and Draco took the wine bottle from her.
“We have five minutes left.” Mentioned Greg, ever so helpful. Vince nodded along next to him, trying to brush his hair down.
“Well, if you insist. I suppose that was part of the deal.” After Draco’s done organising his hair again, he remounts his broom.
"If you Ravenclaws were to sit down then maybe I could get on with the lesson." Professor Snape said in an even but threatening tone. They quickly shuffled into four seats that were next to each other. Draco was between Michael and Terry, with Anthony on Michael's right.
"This is the entrance the Ravenclaw common rooms. Right here," she gestured to the knocker, "is your way in. The eagle will ask you a riddle, and if you answer correctly, it will let you in. If not, you have to wait for another person to come along." There was a look of panic that spread across the first year's faces. Meredith smiled at them cheekily. "You want to know a secret about the real way to get in?" The all nodded eagerly, especially Draco, who was ready for any Hogwarts secrets he could get. "You don't actually need to know about the answer that was intended for the riddle. As long as it fits the criteria, and you can defend your answer, the eagle will let you through. We Ravenclaws don't have time to be stuck outside our common room for five minutes trying to find out the meaning of life. 'If the answer is technically true, the eagle will always let you through.' Like this." She gave the knocker three sharp knocks.
"I hate that noise." He said matter of factly, taking a small step away from the potion. "It's really awful. Can you get it to stop?"
