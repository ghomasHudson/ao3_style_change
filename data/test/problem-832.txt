“You’re drunk,” is all he can say, frankly too astounded to come up with anything else. What the fuck is he going on about? The thought of Draco being in love with him is more absurd than the thought of Arthur in fishnets.
Ginny’s grin doesn’t diminish at all. “I was taking a stroll past the cupboard over there and I heard something very interesting,” she informs them, glee evident in her voice.
Eventually, much the same as all the other times, they fell back together so suddenly that Harry can’t remember how it happened. One slip up, one drunken night and it was almost as if nothing had ever happened. Almost. A tiny friction remained, some unspoken regret in Draco’s eyes that Harry had to turn away from lest he get consumed by the pain of it.
He watches Draco take a long sip of his drink, eyes fluttering closed as he lets the sparkling liquid sit on his tongue.
A hand is placed onto his arm, squeezing lightly. He’s seen Blaise be many things; loud, scathing, flirty. Never comforting, not with anyone outside of their little circle. He must really be a mess, to earn the pity of Blaise Zabini.
If he’s being honest, he’s already forgotten what he was going to say. It doesn’t seem to matter, his mouth has already decided what he’s going to say next before he even registers the thought.
He throws the leafy part of the strawberry onto a napkin and lays back down onto his back, stretching his arms up and placing them under his head. Eyes closed, he listens to the sound of the waves crashing against the shore and Draco’s steady breathing. It would be easy to slip into sleep, to run away from doing the thing he knows he needs to do. He can’t, though.
“You’re getting very fast,” Draco compliments him, smiling wide. “I don’t know how your little legs move like that!”
“Explain to me what you think I’m doing here,” Draco demands. His expression is a little clearer to Harry now, confusion written all over his face.
The third time he broke a rule, it took him four years to realise. Four whole years of them falling in and out of various beds with each other and finally,
“Draco,” he utters calmly, reaching a hand up to his cheek and holding it in what he hopes is a soothing move. “You don’t have to be sorry. Breathe.”
“Ginny,” he greets with a nod, trying to act casual. The look on her face is all too knowing and to Harry’s absolute fear, she looks terrifyingly sober.
“Don’t say that,” Harry pleads, getting out of the chair and walking over to Draco. He turns so he’s sitting sideways in the chair, facing Harry head-on and looking like he’s preparing for something. Dropping to one knee on the freezing floor, he takes Draco’s folded arms and pulls both of his hands into his, holding them tightly. He’s sure they look a sight right now. “Please don’t ever say that—It’s not true, and nothing or no one could ever convince me otherwise. You’ve never been less than, not to me.”
Now, it’s somewhere between midnight and one am and they have yet to fall asleep. Harry’s not far off, lying on his side and blinking up at his boyfriend, wondering how the fuck he manages to read like that; with only the dim glow of a lamp between them and the dark of the night. As always, he’s beautiful. Even like this—especially like this—tired and focused on something other than him, hair tucked behind his ear to stop it from falling into his face.
Harry raises a heavy eyebrow at him, challenging. “Who was it that learned how to cook just so he could make me my favourite meal for our first anniversary? Was it my other boyfriend?”
Harry rolls his eyes. Pansy may well be a trained healer, but he will never let that woman near him with a wand. She’s been waiting to hex him for years.
“Of course I do Rosie,” he says, plastering on a smile that really doesn’t want to be there. “Lots and lots.”
They’re both on the defensive, preparing for an attack that neither of them wants to initiate. He’s not sure what went wrong. He’s kind of sick of not being sure. It would be so easy to just say it, to pull the plug on their ridiculous game and finally be free. Uttering the words comes with a price, one he’s not willing to pay.
He shifts, trying to get comfortable, and their cocks touch. “Fuck,” he breathes against Draco’s parted lips, grinding down and chasing the friction. There’s a whimper when he does, the noise going straight to his cock. He needs to move this along before he finishes embarrassingly early.
There’s a tension in the air that he can’t quite place. Draco doesn’t joke with him, or say anything at all. When Harry turns to look at him, all he sees is the white expanse of the man’s back. So this is it, he thinks. The beginning of the end.
, they came out of the war completely unscathed. I don’t really know what happened, I disapparated and then I was here. I didn’t even recognise the place until I knocked and you opened the door.”
Naturally, as they always do, his eyes find Draco. He sits on the back porch, the sliding doors cracked open to let the sea breeze in. Harry goes to the doors without a thought. Curled up on one side of a swing seat that’s gently rocking, his love seems entirely distracted by a book. As usual. Contrary to Harry and the few grey hairs he’s already found, Draco hasn’t aged a day. The only noticeable difference between the Draco in front of him and the one he fell in love with is the hair that now grazes his shoulders. There had been a few tearful conversations when he’d first raised the idea of growing his hair out, initially deeply insecure about the prospect of looking like his father. Thankfully, he looks nothing like Lucius. He’s still the most beautiful thing Harry has ever seen, perhaps even more so now.
He looks to Draco, taking in the pained look on his face. He’s not sure if it’s annoyance at being caught, fear or just plain mortification. Their eyes meet and Harry just shrugs lightly before turning back to the ecstatic bride.
It’s not even really that late, barely even 10 pm, but after hours of small talk and loud noise, he’s done for. Thankfully, he’s managed to find some peace in a secluded corner of the tent. Sat at a table alone with a sleeping Hugo bundled up in his arms, he’s enjoying the chance to breathe for the first time tonight.
After that fateful night, the tension between them at work had lessened. Gone were the spiteful looks and in their place only confused warmth and the occasional teasing banter. They never really delved all that deep into anything, only ever teetering on the edge of polite conversation and something more.
“Mm?” His fingers are tracing over Harry’s scar, something Harry would kill anyone else for daring to do. It’s okay when it’s Draco, the touch is always nothing but completely tender. Somehow it wipes away every bad memory that’s etched into every jagged branch of the scar, even if just for a moment.
When Draco grows restless beneath him, needing more, he moves. One big hand clutching the blond’s thigh, one on his waist, he pulls out just slightly before pushing back in; testing the waters. Draco gasps. Reassured, he does it again, this time driving in deeper.
, he’d called him Harry. The anxiety he feels only strengthens, making it hard to breathe. In all of their years in this limbo, he’s only ever called him that once. It had been one of the strangest nights of Harry’s life. One night, just before they’d fucked for the first time, Draco had turned up on his doorstep; soaking wet and sobbing. Dumbfounded, Harry had helped him inside and sat him in front of the roaring fire, casting all the warming and drying spells he could think of. The sobbing didn’t cease for hours, eventually a murmured ‘Hold me, Harry?’ had broken the silence. And so he did. He held him the entire night, until the boy couldn’t cry anymore. They never spoke of it again, and Draco hasn’t uttered his name since.
“Now who’s staring?” He questions lightly, pulling Draco against him and wrapping his arms around his middle.
Draco just smiles, a teasing smile he’s seen a thousand times before. A smile he could close his eyes and paint without missing a single detail. “No, you don’t.”
He stands there for as long as it takes Blaise to make it back to the tent. Once the man is out of sight, he disapparates with a
Hugo giggles brightly, hiding his face in Draco’s chest. The sight strikes Harry deeply, the sudden thought that maybe this is what it will be like with their own children someday charging at him and threatening to knock him down. Draco is wonderful with Teddy and the Weasley children, warm with them in a way he never would have believed possible ten years ago. They haven’t talked about having their own. Not yet.
“So good for me,” he assures, so much more focussed on Draco than himself. “So tight and perfect and amazing,” he’s not even sure what he’s saying at this point, overwhelmed with the need to make Draco feel good.
“Do you need sorting out?” he asks then, reaching up to wipe a bit of spit away from Draco’s chin with the pad of his thumb.
He spends more of the ceremony than he’d like to admit looking over at Draco. At one point, Hermione sends a very discreet stinging jinx at him when he’s caught staring for too long. His surprised yelp almost sends Ron into hysterics.
“We were friends before I fucked you, Malfoy.” He’s playing into the game now, doing what Draco wants him to do and biting back.
Kreacher seems pained for a second, almost as if he doesn’t want to betray Draco. There’s always been an odd relationship there, Draco’s blood ties to the family meaning that the elf frequently has to stop himself from looking to him rather than Harry. It amuses them both.
Draco looks at him properly, some of the worry seemingly easing now and in its place something that looks a lot like fear. His eyes are wide and disbelieving and so beautiful that Harry almost forgets how to breathe. Inching closer slowly enough to give Draco the option to move away, he brings their lips together again.
The look Ron gives him is far too understanding, pity etched into the small frown of his heavy brows. “Harry—“
Somewhere along the way he had fallen in love and in doing so, had broken the one rule he knew he couldn’t come back from. As quickly as he realised, he decided that he must never dare speak it. He resigned himself to loving Draco in silence.
“Are you close, love?” Harry asks with a kiss to a flushed cheek. Draco can only nod. There are tears welling at the corner of his eyes and Harry’s heart aches at the sight of them.
Ten years ago, amongst war and loss and facing an uncertain future, all he knew was that he loved her. It was foolish naivety, a relationship borne of a need to be part of a family he had already been welcomed into but that didn’t stop it from feeling utterly real. After their inevitable and final breakup, their relationship had blossomed into what it was always meant to be, familial and strong. Ginny became the woman he always thought she would be, getting drafted into the Holyhead Harpies before she’d even finished her NEWTs and proving every day how wonderful she is. Luna had thought so too, their relationship coming out of nowhere but somehow making complete sense. Harry is endlessly supportive of them.
Draco shakes his head, smiling as if his boyfriend is the biggest idiot in the world. Which, Harry concedes, probably isn’t far off.
Harry scoffs. “Easier for who? You?” He questions, voice edging on angry. He’s not even sure himself how he feels, if it’s anger or hurt or just emotional exhaustion. “Break my heart without having to see the fallout?”
She giggles her little melodic giggle and then promptly quietens as the rest of the bridesmaids finish their procession.
“I don’t know what you’re trying to say,” he confesses, silently begging Draco to look at him again. Everything hurts a little less when the silvery eyes are on him. “You have nothing to apologise for, if you want this to be over just tell me and go—what were you going to do? Write a letter and then never see me again?”
Cold air hits his skin and he’s surprised to find that he’s sat outside, on the floor. Whoever sat him down at least had the foresight to cast a cushioning charm on the floor and put up a spell to cover them from the falling snow. He turns to the person sitting next to him, expecting to find Ron or Hermione, maybe another Weasley. It’s not.
“Fuck the rules,” he murmurs, stroking his thumb across the flushed cheek, marvelling at how warm it is. “Fuck them.”
Ginny’s grin, impossibly, grows wider. She looks up and down Draco’s frame in a way that makes Harry want to step in front of him and shield him from her scrutiny. He doesn’t move.
“Three years,” he states as if it’s not completely bizarre of him to have purchased a ring when their official relationship was still in its infancy. Ignoring Draco’s shocked expression, he plucks the box out of his hand and carefully removes the ring. “I always knew. Give me your hand.”
Rose grins wide. “He told me to tell you that it’s nearly lunchtime and you’re a lazy git,” she says, sounding incredibly proud of herself.
Too eager to bother with bottles and lids, he murmurs a lubrication charm—wandless—before circling his fingers against the rim.
Bringing everyone to a beach house on the south coast of France had been a last-minute decision. They’d all been talking one night about how daunting turning thirty is and how little time they get away from everything now. Harry’s done being an Auror, was done long before he quit and didn’t even notice until Draco pointed it out, and now spends his days as a freelance defence trainer; training others and showcasing his skills without the mountains of paperwork and the lingering trauma. It keeps him busy and has the added bonus of hopefully leaving him qualified to settle down and be a professor one day, when he’s ready.
“We better go tell them your mission was successful, hmm?” He asks the children, smiling when they waste no time jumping off the bed.
The dinner is a lively affair. A large buffet consisting of foods from all the countries the girls have visited together over the years is spread across one side of the tent.  It’s an experience for all the senses and Harry enjoys trying something from each country.
Suddenly, Harry finds it hard to breathe. With a hideous scraping noise, he pulls the chair he’s holding out from under the table and drops into it, unable to stand with this information pulling him down. He doesn’t want to believe it. If it’s true then he truly has been a fool.
Draco’s hands are cold in his. He feels like he might cry, everything hitting him all at once. All he wants is to fix this, to hold them together and patch it all up until none of the cracks show. He brings one of Draco’s hands to his mouth, pressing a kiss to the knuckles.
Draco freezes, speechless for once. Then, his expression shifts. From shock to something entirely new that Harry can’t decipher. “I’ve loved you for longer than that,” he says calmly, refusing to break eye contact.
Everyone cheers, a few whistles breaking through the noise. He catches Bill downing his glass of champagne and rolls his eyes. Poor Fleur is going to have to carry him out later.
“You should hurry up and put this in me before I go and find that Irish man,” Draco states simply, knowing exactly what buttons to press. It doesn’t have the same scathing tease behind it this time. There’s no truth there, nothing that causes the usual doubt to crawl its way into Harry’s overly-jealous mind. It’s nothing but a joke, an attempt to move things along. “He seemed awfully eager to have me earlier.”
“You were having a panic attack, or something like that,” Blaise informs him. “Thought you could use some air.”
Harry grabs the wandering hand, pulling it up to his mouth and biting a finger playfully before pressing a gentle kiss to it. Draco grins. “I’ve had you on your knees today—and while I wouldn’t usually say no to you and your mouth, it’s been a week since I’ve been inside you,” he explains, pulling Draco into him. “And that just won’t do.”
“What did you think I was going to say? I’ve been hinting for at least two years,” Draco says, exasperated with Harry’s insecurity. “Your obliviousness might be a medical problem, I’ll have Pansy look you over when we get home.”
A cold breeze hits Harry then and he’s reminded that his robes are somewhere in the tent, discarded on the back of a chair. The plain white button-up shirt he’s wearing does little to protect from the cold that shouldn’t even be making it past the charms in place. From the challenging look on Draco’s face, it’s not hard to deduce that he’s fucking around with the spells.
Rolling his eyes at the mothering tone, he squeezes his thigh reassuringly. “I’m perfectly fine. Just content. Plus it’s not like we’ve been sleeping very early,” he reminds him, taking complete joy in the flush that appears on his face.
He sees Draco then. Three rows back sat between a seemingly already drunk Pansy and a bored Blaise. He’s not looking at Harry, though there’s a slight flush on his cheeks that suggests he may have been. Harry curses every person sitting in front of the blond man, obscuring his view of anything but the pretty face and a slither of his shoulders. Even just from that, he knows he looks good. He always does.
They stay like that for a while, exchanging soft kisses and melting into each other. Everything else lies forgotten on the floor beneath their feet. The rules, their fucked up relationship, the fear of what other people might think, Harry’s aching heart; none of it matters when Draco’s walls are firmly down. That is until the sound of heavy footfalls and drunken giggles break through their bubble.
“Piss off,” Harry turns away from the disaster happening across the room to level a grin at his friend, letting him know they’re good. He gets a nod in reply and then Ron’s off, presumably to dump Hugo on some poor unsuspecting Weasley relative.
Harry forces out a laugh, it rings painfully hollow. “Good luck with that, she looks worse than she did at George’s wedding.”
He’s sure there will be moments in his future that will outshine this one. When they finally say their vows, the love they feel channelled into the bonds forever tied into their cores. The birth of their first child, whenever that may come. Seeing that child flourish, being able to give them the childhood that neither he nor Draco got. One filled with an abundance of love and safety, no looming darkness waiting to pounce; at least not any they can’t face together. He’s sure there’s so much more for them, happiness they can’t even fathom. For now, though, this is more than he ever thought himself worthy of.
He kisses back, matching the urgency in Draco’s movements. It’s better than he ever could have created in his mind. The warmth, the taste of something sweet on Draco’s lips, the way his hands are still holding on to his tie like a lifeline, holding him there. It’s all so
They’ve been here for a week now and it’s been wonderful. Days have been spent doing nothing but eating, sleeping and playing on the beach. He may have been sleeping more than he intended.
Harry knows he doesn’t mean it—can’t mean it—but that doesn’t stop it from going straight to his gut. He doesn’t respond. They stay like that for a while, Harry pounding into him relentlessly and kissing every spot he can reach, Draco’s neck arched to give him access. His legs hook around Harry’s back, pushing him somehow even deeper, and the hand not twisted in his brunet locks grips his arm like a lifeline.
When he looks back, he can’t even really pinpoint where it started. Malfoy had just turned up one day, at the Ministry, and hasn’t left Harry’s life since. They hadn’t spoken at first, had barely exchanged anything but frosty glares and the occasional nod, but then something changed. The turning point had been when Hermione, twenty-one going on forty, had decided that everyone needed to get along. She’d organised a party, tearing through Grimmauld Place like a whirlwind setting it up, and invited everyone from their year at Hogwarts and then some. Harry had been powerless to stop it, never one to get on the wrong side of Hermione when she’s set on something.
“What are you doing?” Harry probes again, not backing down but also not daring to make the move into the room, teetering on the edge of the step.
There was the night four days ago where they decided to go out for a meal, alone, and actually made an effort with it. Draco found some obnoxiously expensive muggle restaurant with dishes Harry had no hope of pronouncing and even less hope of identifying and they had their first peaceful, child-free meal of the holiday. It was a stunning venue, with twinkling chandeliers and gold-accented walls. He’d been ready to do it, sometime after their shared dessert that looked inedible and tasted divine, but fate had other plans. Of course.
Draco whines when he presses another open-mouthed kiss to his neck, sucking lightly. “Please,” he begs. “I want that—forever.”
Six months of Molly’s relentless jitters, Ginny’s grumpy outbursts and Luna’s airy indifference later, the wedding day is finally here.
There’s no move to pull off, which is all the answer he needs. A few erratic thrusts later, he’s coming into Draco’s mouth with a shout. He swallows it all.
He sees the moment she gets it, the same pitying look her brother gave him earlier taking over her face. If there were a way for him to erase his entire existence, he thinks now would be a good time to take it.
The most jarring invite to land on his desk, one day six months ago, was Ginny’s. It’s not that he hadn’t seen it coming. He was very aware that she and Luna were serious, had even been part of the proposal plans, yet seeing it right there in front of him in black and white shook him to his core.
Getting a step further than every other time, he’d actually managed to summon the ring, holding the velvet box tightly in his fist. He’d taken a deep breath, opened his mouth and then promptly shut it when Draco knocked his glass of wine halfway across the room whilst reaching for his hand.
He turns back to the man, their eyes meeting. There’s a fire in his eyes, something that tells him they won’t leave this room unscathed.
“He’s right, Gin. Just some good wholesome platonic shagging,” he agrees, fighting everything in him to keep his tone light. He sends her what he hopes is a pleading look that says
“Is that what that was?” Harry replies, stepping closer. “I don’t usually make friends by eye fucking them.”
By the end of the vows, he finds himself weeping along with many others. The brides kiss, quickly but passionately, and leave the tent to a chorus of cheers and well-wishes. There’s a separate tent where they will go and spend a much needed five minutes in each other’s company before the onslaught of congratulations begins.
Harry decides to play along. “And I don’t feel eager to you?” he questions, pulling his fingers almost all the way out, only to push them in again; hard and deep. Draco moans, high and breathy.
Draco laughs. It’s not the usual sweet melody of a laugh, it’s dark and bitter and it twists into Harry’s gut like a knife. “You’re an absolute fucking fool, Harry Potter.”
The praise has him moaning around the intrusion and the sweet pleasure of it courses through Harry’s veins, causing him to thrust slightly into the wet heat. Draco doesn’t gag—something that never fails to get him going—and his pretty grey eyes look up at him, making eye contact before he nods slightly. Permission.
It doesn’t take long at all. Knowing that Draco is going to be unbearably smug about it, he groans in both pleasure and annoyance when he feels the impending orgasm.
The mask of annoyance slips away, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips. “The kind of night where you ask me stupid questions every five minutes rather than go to sleep,” he states simply.
“You’re in love with him,” he says again, this time in a mocking sing-song manner that makes Harry consider if he could get away with murder, being the saviour of the wizarding world and all that. This has to be some sort of cruel joke, some horrible five-year long plan concocted by the three Slytherins to ridicule him. Pansy seems the type to plan something like this.
Draco had apparated home to his rarely used flat in London last night, meaning that they hadn’t had the chance to see each other. Harry had been stuck with Luna and her half of the bridesmaids, spending the evening consoling her as her unbothered facade finally shattered and the wedding jitters poured out.
Harry nods, keeping one hand on his hip and using the other to line himself up. They both groan when he presses the tip in, the tight heat clenching around him. He waits for a moment before pushing in further, marvelling at how perfectly they always manage to fit together. Slowly, never wanting to hurt him even unintentionally, he’s fully in. He thanks God or whoever for the invention of protection potions, can’t imagine having something between them in this moment. It always amazes him how much being inside Draco feels like coming home. Even the first time, when there was nothing between them but newfound amicability and surprising lust, it had felt so much more intense than with anyone else he’d been with. Now, years of laughter and fights and falling later, it’s unfathomable bliss.
listen right now. “I’m going to suck your cock, then we’re going to go back out there and be good guests until it’s an appropriate time to leave.”
The first time he broke a rule was about six months in when he accidentally, whilst under the influence of almost an entire bottle of Firewhiskey, told Hermione and Ron about their situation. They were scarily unbothered by the revelation, only sharing a knowing look that Harry was far too gone to analyse.
"I suppose this is why we need Slytherins." Harry chuckled and wrapped his arms around Draco. “You realize, of course, that this means you are never allowed to leave me.” Harry tightened his hold until Draco could barely breathe.
“You certainly can. But if you do, be sure to add extra lavender flowers roughly equivalent to the mass of what you are losing in stems and leaves. If you don’t try to compensate for the difference, the Flobberworm Mucus won’t react properly, resulting in a weaker Draught.”
,” Harry said, still staring at Draco as though he couldn't quite believe it. “I thought you were leaving.”
But the question was lost when fireworks boomed through the sky. Harry pressed his hand out over the flat stone, brushing his fingers lightly against the edges of Draco’s. Draco curled his pinky finger around Potter’s, and pressed their knees together.
“Draco, your heart rate, it's--” Draco felt himself getting heavier. He felt himself falling back onto his mattress with his legs still curled, as stiff as though they were still hooked over the edge of his bed. “No, no, no,” Granger said, leaning over him. She murmured a series of healing spells, but none of them did anything at all. “Pull yourself together, Malfoy! If you die on my watch, Harry is going to
Draco felt his wand flinging from his hand as he reflexively reached out around himself, trying to grasp anything to prevent his fall. Then he hit earth and for one terrifying moment he couldn’t breathe while all of the air was knocked out of his lungs. As soon as his lungs began working again, he gasped and groaned, his knees aching, his palms scratched. Potter landed somewhere behind him, and Draco instantly looked over his shoulder to make sure that he was unharmed. Potter sputtered and gasped as Draco looked around them. They were standing in a deep, square dirt pit, empty but nearly ten feet wide and at least fifteen feet tall.
Draco felt his heart clench painfully inside of his chest. This was third year. This was before Voldemort had really risen, before Draco and Harry had gotten swept up in it, and before Harry had fallen in love with Ginny Weasley.
tried to apologize for what he'd said that night he took the Potion of Truth, but he wasn't entirely sure she'd forgiven him.
Draco had marched across the room, stared at Cornelius for a moment over the edge of that damned newspaper, and then snogged him right then and there as if proving a point to himself. Well, he
a way. A compassionate, tender way. And Potter’s cheeks went a little pink, and his hand pressed a little more tightly against Draco’s chest, and his lips opened a little, and Draco suddenly feared that Potter had understood everything Draco had just said.
to children. Draco was probably fine to be himself. Whoever that was. He had never stayed in one place long enough to really find out.
He focused. It hurt like hell, but he managed to lift his finger a centimeter and tap it against the mattress. It was barely a movement. It was barely even a noise. But Granger, clever creature that she was, turned around. “What?” she asked. Draco aimed the tip of his finger at his desk. To his last remaining vial. “You want to take Potion Eight?”
hadn’t involved Harry Potter standing before him in a ballroom, pouring his heart out and begging Draco to...
“What! That’s cheating! Wand should beat everything. I demand a rematch under the pretense of not properly understanding...er...whatever you call them.”
And why was the absent-minded Potter spending so much time thinking in great detail about the room that contained his
? Malfoy rolled over and shoved his head into a pillow. He did not want to be thinking about Harry Potter.
Young Potter sat on his bed and punched his mattress once. Twice. A small snowy owl landed in the window with parchment in its beak. Harry looked up. “I wish Buckbeak had ripped him to pieces, Hedwig!” Harry was back on his feet again, pacing back and forth. “It’d serve him right! Why can’t he just—” Harry took the letter from the owl during one of his bouts around the room, but slapped it on a desk and didn’t bother reading it. He tore himself out of his robes in a violent huff, packed them into a tight ball between his angry hands, and threw them across the room as hard as he could with a yell. Apparently that wasn’t enough, so he pulled one shoe off and threw it against the wall with all of his strength, and then the other. Apparently none of this violence was terribly unusual, because the owl seemed completely unfazed. “I hope he gets eaten by a thousand hippogriffs, for all I care!” Potter yelled, opening a tin and producing a treat. The owl took it, accepted a frustrated pat on the head, and flew off.
"It wasn't my fault!" he yelled at her, frustration bubbling somewhere in the middle of his chest. "I promise you I did not overdose on the bloody Potion! All I wanted, Madam Pomfrey, all I ever wanted was simply to go to bed and
"True, but learning about runic scripts is much more fun than, say, the First Goblin Rebellion of 1612."
"But McGonagall accepted you back, you're on Probation, you're doing your time so I don't see why it's a big deal!"
“Fat Friar, like, did not notice that Godric’s tail moved. He truly believed that Godric was sleep.”
curse unto him as he did in Third Year when Granger emerged top in his year all because he had an A in Herbology whereas Granger had an EE.
Harry blinked and Professor Slughorn's voice was nothing but an echo. He was never good in Potions, the class requiring precise turnings and timings, and the only time he ever did achieve a decent EE grade was in Sixth Year – the one time he came third in class much to everyone's surprise and to the disdain of his professor. First in class was always Malfoy, no matter how good his best friend was in the class, Malfoy seemed to have a flair for the subject. He never broke a sweat even when Snape threatened anyone who did not get an O would not advance to Sixth Year Potions.
Before Harry could reply there was a loud chatter of cheers and they both looked up to find Hermione bouncing on her heels. Looking closely, Harry saw a bright green cabbage perched on her table.
Madam Pomfrey, he had begun to use his nights to good use. Not to study, no, but in cooking. It was how he had discovered that the Room of Requirement was in fact still functional – miraculously – and it was oddly therapeutic.
Once again Madam Pomfrey seemed neither shocked nor surprised – perhaps already used to this – at his list but simply nodded and instructed him that from tomorrow he was allowed to have guests. Only two at a time were allowed to visit him, mind. If any more than two arrived, the wards at the door of the Hospital Wing would not let them pass the threshold. And with that, Harry closed his eyes and fell asleep.

Harry's mind did not have the War fresh in his mind but the crowd of Slytherins sat together on the other side of the classroom. If Slughorn was asking them to partner up with someone from another House, he did not mind, though he would do anything to pair up with Ron, truly. However, he was all for House unity and perhaps it would not be weird if he partnered up with—
Harry chuckled lightly. "I didn't grow up in your world, the wizarding world so it's very interesting to me. Plus, it's taught by a ghost, like, how cool is that?"
Malfoy looked away, his fingers fidgeting together on his lap. "I may not be the… best of options as a… person but if you were feeling the way you felt I… would have liked to know." His Adam's apple danced on the column of his neck.
It was all well and good anyway since he had an appointment with the Mind Healer McGonagall scheduled.
Harry took his cue to leave, not wanting to remain in the awkward presence of Ron, not bothering to take a chocolate frog or two for himself, and headed off to the Room of Requirement for an impromptu cooking session. On his walk to the Room, he decided he was going to make the delicious Broccoli Tahini Pasta Salad which was simple enough as he simply had to boil the vegetables, pasta, and make the Lemon Tahini dressing salad, and
The oven pinged, indicating that his pasta was ready. He removed his baking tray onto the kitchen marble island, letting it cool down for a few minutes before he dug right in.
Harry smiled at Ron. "She's not that bad when you get to know her. You know she gives us a cup of tea and biscuits before we begin class."
The words Draught of Living Death appeared on the board during the afternoon class of Potions. Whilst in the previous class Professor Slughorn had announced that students would require extra ingredients and had to make a trip to Hogsmeade to fetch the ingredients, that was not the case for today. As soon as they were all seated, Professor Slughorn excitedly announced that he had fetched the required ingredients and they would be brewing the sleeping potion in today's lesson.
. He could feel Potter’s nervous breath on his thumb, chest rising and falling against his hand. Draco wanted this. How could he have thought for an instant he hadn’t wanted this? He had wanted this for a fucking lifetime. There was no possible way that some muscled stranger who didn’t even know the first thing about Potter was going to be the last person whispering provocative things into his ear and making him flush tonight. Absolutely not. If he had his way, the muscled stranger would be completely forgotten, replaced only with thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
. Even that awful dig in Wyoming, where they had accidentally unearthed a hatch of man-eating cockroaches, was still preferable to here. He didn’t care about the Fountain of Youth. He just wanted to go… he swallowed the tightness in his throat. Home? Where was home? He didn’t even have a home to go
Harry cleared his throat and stepped forward, taking one of Draco’s hands in his while tucking the other around Draco's waist. And there was that stupid golden heat, burning between their hands. It was maddeningly distracting. The last time Draco had felt that heat, he had been naked on a tile floor with the man who was now so busy
. Something kind of like heat. “But I think I rather liked it.” Draco swallowed. Potter was looking at him in
After a few general announcements, the meeting was over. Before Draco could make his escape, Granger called him aside. “Professor Malfoy,” she said. “Would you be so kind as to join me for tea in my office in an hour? There is a matter I would like to discuss with you.”
. Fidgeting, toe-scuffing students trying to conjure predatory fucking frogs in his fucking bedroom. Bastards, the lot of them. Draco stumbled across the room and practically ripped the door off of its hinges with his wand at the ready, then wobbled until he regained his balance. “I said--!” he yelled angrily into the dark hallway. He blinked. He looked left and right down the hallway and saw no one. But he could have sworn he heard a swishing of robes, followed by footsteps hastening away from his room and down the hall. “And stay out!” he yelled and returned to his room, mumbling something so incoherent that even
“Well,” Draco pushed himself to his feet. “At least tonight you had adult supervision, and I’m not about to let you fall over the battlements.”
“Like hell you can, Potter. You don’t know what you’re walking into. There could be ten Death Eaters out there for all we know, and we’re already as good as dead.”
, too, and all Draco could do was moan helplessly as he flopped his head to the side and pressed his tongue against Potter’s scar, licking along its jagged purple edges, tasting lightning in his mouth.
“You are Harry fucking Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, who cast his first Patronus before he had even snogged a person and you can do anything you put your mind to, you annoying twit. Now cast.”
So why the hell did Draco still want to reach for Potter’s hands in the dark? Why the hell did Draco want to reach out, and
James scoffed and walked away. They avoided each other for the better part of fifteen minutes, pacing on their respective portions of the battlements. Eventually, Draco settled in one place, casting a warming charm and leaning against the cold stone. Potter always claimed he was on patrol on nights like these, but he also walked with such thoughtful, determined purpose that Draco often wondered if there was more to it. He walked like a man with the world on his mind.
Granger sat behind a large desk, scribbling something onto parchment with an elegant quill. Her hair, still frizzy and wild, was pulled back into a loose ponytail. He'd heard that she married Weasley, but either they had gotten divorced or she had kept her name, because a metallic placard rested on her desk that read “H. Granger,” and he certainly wasn’t about to ask. She looked up at him.
having Potter eyeing him in the Faculty Room, and falling into his bed from magical doors in the ceiling, and saying ambiguously flirtatious things. But when he had blurted truths to Victoria and Weasley, they had been mostly hurtful. Oh, and there were so many, many, many hurtful things he could say to Potter. Scrolls of hurtful things. Endless hurtful things that he had been composing his entire life. And once he surrendered to the potion, once he started saying those hurtful things, he wasn’t certain he would be able to stop. And he didn’t want Potter to hear any of it. Because even Harry Potter wasn’t
Draco pushed open the door to their room and stepped inside. Behind him, Harry was saying, “Yes Ron, I’ll let you know if I need anything. Yes.” It took all of Draco’s willpower to not tell Weasley to bugger off so he could have Harry to himself for five seconds.
Draco was growing aware of Potter’s precarious position. On top of him. With the inability to move. When Potter had fallen, Potter’s hands, hiding deep within his too-long pyjama sleeves, had been on either side of Malfoy’s head, and now they were pressed tightly together behind Draco’s neck, bound at the wrists. Potter’s legs were also bound tightly together from thigh to ankle, and….
like that should be it. Still not trusting his legs yet, he summoned his research journal and quill and began to report what had happened so far. The Fountain of Vermouth had clearly been a result of Potion 3, which explained its alcohol characteristic. Potion 1 was still a giant question mark.
and I didn't even..." Draco huffed. "Well what about last night, mm? You were pretty pervy yourself.”
. Draco both loved it and hated it. Granted, he was also quite content to tease Harry right back whenever possible. Draco rocked his hips, trying to push Harry deeper inside of himself, but Harry pulled his cock just out of reach. Draco felt himself pouting.
“We’re agreed then!” she said, grabbing Draco’s robes and pulling him down the hall before he could protest. She pushed Draco and Harry into a large, empty room with wooden floors and tall windows. The room had a slight, cool draft and a scent of old wood that pleasantly reminded Draco of the ballroom at Malfoy Manor. Lily flicked her wand toward an old gramophone against the wall and a crackling tune trickled into the room. “Waltz!” she commanded, rolling out a dusty old tapestry like a picnic blanket against the wall. Settling herself on the tapestry, she pulled out Charms homework and made a show of studying. Despite the fact that she was holding a Charms textbook, Draco could
Relief floods through his body, the panic attack he was teetering on the edge of subsiding for now. “Thank fuck,” Harry exclaims, holding a hand to his frantically beating heart. Draco laughs at him, the sound thick with the tears that are now pouring thick and fast down his beautiful face.
There’s something in Draco’s voice that Harry can’t decipher. He doesn’t know if he wants to pull it apart, wonders if maybe it would be best to ignore it.
“What are you two little monsters up to?” He questions, reaching out to tickle Hugo, earning him a delighted squeal. “What have you done with uncle Draco?”
The scribbling stops. Wide, panicked eyes turn to him. “Get out,” he says as if it’s his kitchen and he has any right at all.
They climb back into bed and slip under the covers in silence, this time gravitating towards each other rather than to opposite ends of the bed. Draco settles in his arms like he belongs there, head on his chest.
With one last look between them, Ginny takes her leave. The silence left in her wake is unbelievably thick. Nobody seems to have heard any of their conversation, he notes with great relief. The party continues turning, as does the anxiety within him. Across the room, Ginny is prying her blubbering mother away from Luna’s side, handing her off to an amused Arthur. Once Molly is dealt with, she sits beside Luna and presses a lingering kiss to her cheek. The easy affection they have leaves a bitter taste in his mouth, something he immediately feels guilty for.
Spread out next to each other on a blanket in the slowly dipping evening sun, on the beach far enough from the house that they can’t hear the argument Hermione and Ron are having about Ron’s incessant need to tinker with stuff at the table, they’re content.
His eyes find Draco quicker than he means for them to. There’s a small smile on his face, the one he’s only ever used for Harry, and it spurs him on. Somehow, he tears his eyes away before he continues. “Love isn’t something I ever really understood—watching everyone couple up after the war, I thought you were all a bit mad,” his voice is teasing and everyone chuckles. “I thought I was missing some crucial piece of information, some reason that I just couldn’t see,” he looks at Draco again before turning back to the brides. “I get it now. Love isn’t just about not wanting to be alone, it’s so much more than that. I see it in the way you talk about each other, in the way you still love each other so deeply even when you’re fighting and I have to deal with Ginny bursting my floo open at stupid o’clock in the morning—“
Harry had forgotten why he’d ever gone to the bathroom in the first place, instead sitting on the closed toilet seat and watching the other man with great interest. They’d talked for over an hour about stuff Harry can’t entirely remember, the party winding down whilst they forgot that anything outside those four walls still existed.
After that disastrous attempt, he considered more understated moments. When they were taking a bath together after a long day on the beach, when they took the kids to a park and Harry watched as Draco watched them, filled to the brim with fondness, when they sat with Ron and Hermione one night long after bedtime and Draco almost started the third wizarding war over scrabble. Every time his fingers itched to clasp the ring, to hand it over and beg for his hand. Every time he chickened out.
Even with his eyes closed, he can feel Draco’s smile. “Should have kissed you years ago,” he whispers. “You talk far too much otherwise.”
Somehow, he looks even more beautiful than he did an hour ago. The tightly laced waistcoat is gone—probably banished once he got sick of the feel of it—and Harry longs to put his hands on his waist, to feel the warmth of his skin through the thin shirt. He’s leaning in the doorway, all long limbs and elegance, and it reminds him far too much of the first night in his office. The memory tastes of something all too close to regret.
“I just think you don’t have a clue what you’re talking about,” he says, a hint of anger seeping into his tone. He doesn’t mean to let his anger get the best of him but at this point, it’s anger or hope. Hope isn’t something he needs, knowing it’ll only be ripped away from him. “He doesn’t feel anything for me, he’s never even fucking
“Speaking of dinner—“ Hermione appears suddenly, none of them having noticed her coming towards them. “Everyone else is making their way to the tables, in case you haven’t noticed,” she tells them with a pointed look between the two men that Harry might have to tell her off for later if he finds the courage.
Resigning himself to his fate, he pulls himself up and sits against the headboard, reaching a hand out to fumble in the drawer at the side of the bed. He finds it quickly, pulling the box out and holding it in his hands awkwardly. It’s a stunning emerald green velvet with a silver clasp, the box itself worth more than he’ll ever admit. Draco looks at it as if it might bite him.
He can tell that Draco knows the night he’s talking about, feels it in the way his body almost flinches. It’s something he needs to know, has spent far too long wondering about. He never understood why Draco came, why he called him by his name that one time and that time alone. If they want to stand a chance at moving forward, he needs to know. No secrets.
“It’s your name,” Draco says with a leer that can only mean trouble. “The Chosen One, The Boy Who Lived, Harry fucking Potter,” he pushes off from the door, moving further into the room. Towards him. Every step feels calculated and Harry can’t tear his eyes away. “Have I not earned the right to say it? Or is that just for the people you actually
“You’re—“ He wheezes, attempting to calm down, a hand pressed to his chest. If Harry weren’t so horrified he’d find it hilarious. “You’re fucking—“
“Sentimental bastard,” he replies, scrunching his nose at him adorably. “I have a reputation to uphold you know.”
“And yet you’re still coming to bed with me,” Harry points out, taking Draco’s hand in his and leading them out of the room.
“I’m sure he’s just fine,” he answers with an eye roll, though Blaise doesn’t dignify it with a response, already strolling away from him.
He reverses the amplifying charm and sits back down just as Ginny stands up to call out to the crowd, “Now let’s party!”
“I’ll take you out later and find you some pastries or something,” Harry promises. “Satisfy your raging sweet tooth.”
Harry isn’t sure Draco really has that many. They walk through the old house together, not saying another word. Through the long hallways, up the creaking staircases and past all the rooms filled with things Harry can’t bear to look at until they reach the room at the furthest end of the hall on the second floor. Harry’s bedroom.
“I hate you,” Harry declares with a groan before grabbing the blond man’s collar in a tight fist and pulling their faces together, all but smashing their lips together. Draco whimpers into his mouth and it tastes a lot like victory.
Draco laughs, softly and sort of out of it. “I told you you’re getting old,” he chides, though it’s flat; missing something.
. They don’t sleep, not yet. Simply existing, basking in the knowledge that maybe things will be okay after all, they stay awake. Content. It feels like hours before one of them speaks.
He doesn’t need to ask anything else of him now. He knows the next part of the story. Lucius is fine, living out his days in a dementor-less Azkaban. Narcissa is even better, thriving these past few years after finally seeking help and accepting the many invitations sent her way by Andromeda for tea and reconciliation. Harry sees her often, their relationship one that still makes little sense to him but he’s all the more grateful for now. There’s no doubt in his mind that she loves Draco fiercely and always will.
Quickly, they’re down to their underwear. Harry’s already hard, he finds. He grips his clothed erection, desperate for some friction. Draco tracks the movement, licking his lips.
“I’ll uhh—I’ll take my leave,” Ginny murmurs awkwardly, running a hand through her short hair. “Should probably go rescue my wife from Mum before she drowns her.”
With one last kiss, he pulls himself away, disconnecting their bodies. He fumbles about for his wand before muttering a cleaning spell and flopping down next to Draco with a groan.
Harry, having the honour of being Luna’s best man, stands to the side of the altar next to the blonde woman herself. Her dress is long and flows beautifully, every inch of it covered in tiny stars he knows Molly spent days embroidering by hand. Her waist-length hair is loose and wavy, bright white flowers only slightly visible against the platinum strands. She looks stunning.
“I didn’t say anything,” he replies with faux innocence. “Anyway, I’m not sure how smart you think Rose is but I assure you she’s not that smart.”
Draco climbs onto the bed, laying himself in the middle of it. His pale skin against the white sheets is a striking image and all Harry can do is stand there at the end of the bed, looking at the way his hair fans across the pillow. He’s sliding a hand down his own body, keeping an eye on Harry to make sure he doesn’t look away, and taking a hold of his own prick. It’s not as thick as Harry’s, but long and flushed and looks far too tempting in Draco’s slowly moving fist.
They were gone for maybe half an hour, Harry thinks, though his perception of time when wrapped up in Draco is incredibly unreliable. It’s somewhere around eleven if he’s correct, and the party is still in full swing. Pansy is flirting with a tall blonde woman in the corner, both of them amusingly drunk and gesturing wildly as they speak. All of the Weasleys are in varying states of intoxication, from Molly who is openly sobbing on the shoulder of a very stricken Luna, to Charlie who is sat on top of a table conjuring dancing visages of dragons for the few children who haven’t been tucked away in a corner to sleep. Hermione and Ron are swaying together on the dancefloor, steps completely out of time with the fast-paced lively tune that is playing. It seems that nobody missed their presence too much.
For the first time, they fall asleep holding each other. Lips pressed to the top of Draco’s head, the blond’s pale arms hooked around his middle and their legs tangled together, the last thing he thinks before he succumbs to sleep is
Ginny is standing at the top of the aisle, all eyes on her. Arthur is holding onto her arm, beaming with pride and love written in every line on his warm face. Everyone in the room is entranced by her. The long lines of her dress are sharp and clean, the structured bodice accentuating her lean form. Her short hair frames her face perfectly and every freckle on her skin looks placed there by some higher power. He flicks his gaze to the side to look at Luna, smiling fondly as he takes in her expression. Her pale blue eyes are shining with tears, the look on her face a special kind of magic. This is what love looks like, he thinks. It strikes him deep in his core that the look on her face watching the love of her life walk down the aisle towards her mirrors the way he feels when he looks at Draco.
“Slytherin green is your colour now?” The blond man asks with a raised eyebrow. Harry very much wants to kiss him. Right now and always. He can’t, though. Not ever.
He once again doesn’t get an answer. A hand grips his bicep and suddenly the world is turning and he lands on his feet in what seems to be a broom closet, a very smug Draco pressed against him. He hates this man.
are you?” one asked, raising his wand toward Draco’s throat as lingering guests continued to scream and scurry toward the doors.
, Harry.” Draco adjusted his weight further onto his elbows and tried to impale himself on Harry's tongue.
“Are you fucking serious?!” Potter was on his feet and pacing toward the center of the room, his hands wound tightly in the hair at the back of his head. “Here we are again, hmm?” Potter said, turning back to face Draco, the pink flush drained from his face. “What the fuck

Later that night, the world spiraling with firewhiskey, Draco kicked off his shoes and removed his shirt, and was about to remove his trousers when he could have sworn that he heard movement outside of his door. If that group of delinquents attempted to conjure predatory frogs in his bedroom this time, they had another thing coming. There was a light knock. Delinquents of the most deviant sort. Trying to get him to open the door first, and
He would come back after he had composed himself. He would find Harry when he was alone and accessible, and tell Harry everything he wanted to say. If Harry rejected him, he would go to Cairo like he had originally planned. He would retreat into his work and keep himself so busy that he would never have time to think about Harry Potter again.
“Yes. I was going to say...I was going to say," Merlin, why was this so difficult? Draco had been wanting to say this
“I didn't know if you still wanted to... Er..." Potter cleared his throat. "Do you still need help with your potions? I mean. I can leave. If you want.”
hard. He didn't quite manage to point at his desk, but he did get the very tip of his finger to twitch. With what lingering brain activity he had left, he was about to try Legilimency to communicate, but it seemed like Granger was already reading his mind without it.
A sadness eased its way into Harry’s emerald eyes and he nodded, his eyes falling to Draco’s bare collarbone.
“Only a quick game, Mr. Potter,” Draco said. “As a bit of an experiment, you see. Your father wants to see if hatred for the opponent improves your skills.”
It felt like such a personal thing to confess, but he murmured, “Hebridean Black,” against Harry’s neck.
He would play nice for as long as he needed to, until he was able to learn what he needed to learn, and then be free of the wretched place.
, Potter.” Potter whimpered softly into Draco’s left ear, and his right hand tightened on Draco’s waist. “There are some things I have been
...But then he slowly pulled back out and away. Draco growled his frustration and bucked his hips. "Tell me, Draco." Harry lined himself back up to Draco's entrance but lingered there, agonizingly still. "What am I?" Harry urged.

“You said you wanted to thank me. For what? You saved my life—you saved me from Fiendfyre, you saved me from Voldemort, you saved my family from Azkaban. I should be thanking
He sank onto the bed and slid his hands down his face, trying to breathe. Eventually he would have to actually
Healer Victoria fled from the room. Draco stood and ran after her into the hallway. “Victoria, come back!” he shouted after her. “What’s wrong?”
"One. Two. Three." Granger remained beside him, watching for any sign of change as she continued to cast diagnostic spells. "Four. Five. Alright, that's it. We're going to the specialists at St. Mungo's."
“Potter!” Draco snapped as he marched down the hall after the meeting had ended. Potter spun around, looking at him curiously. “We need to talk.” Draco clenched Potter’s robes in
Potter snorted into his pint. “Malfoy. She only wants me for my fame. I’ve told you. To most people I am a conquest. They only see my scar, not
he felt it. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s chest and the golden light surged through them, almost unbearably warm and pleasant. He could practically feel it restoring Harry's strength.
The Hogwarts term was ending early that year in honor of the fifteen-year-anniversary of the defeat of Voldemort. The term was ending a whole
James shrugged. “I’ll say I read it in the newspapers. Can I see it?” James asked, nodding toward Draco’s forearm.
when we were James’ age, but he doesn’t want to listen. He's still a little dementor-drained this morning, it would seem. Woke up in an awful state.”
Eventually though, Cornelius discovered that Draco was a former Death Eater and it had all gone up in smoke. He didn’t even give Draco the courtesy of a break-up note. When Draco woke up after their first night together, the caravan was empty. Cornelius had taken his things and apparated to who-knows-where. Draco never saw him again.
Draco traced his fingers across the gentle rolling muscles of Harry’s chest, over his shoulders and down his arms, afraid to close his eyes in fear that this would be his only chance to see Harry this way--wet, naked, and dripping. He was afraid that if he closed his eyes, Harry would remember all of the reasons for his anger and disappointment the night before, and disappear.
I hope you enjoyed this fic as much as I enjoyed writing it! I don't know about you, but I needed some sweet, sweet Drarry escapism. I figured it was time to pull out this old fic, brush off the dust, and finally post it. It certainly hasn't been doing anyone any good by hiding on my computer for the last two years.

have been. He had never once been allowed to call his father “dad,” as Harry’s children did. It was always, “yes sir,” or “no sir.” They had never once talked of love. He had been overjoyed if his father had so much as smiled at him. And yet, despite all of that, he loved his father. He knew that, in his own way, his father had loved him. There had still been rare moments when he had witnessed his parents break down and
Potters? Bloody hell, Potter and Female Weasley had been busy, hadn’t they? The real question was: had they shagged immediately after the war, or before?
found plenty of dried ancient potion ingredients. But he also found the Tomb of Hannu, which contained the largest collection of ancient texts referencing the Fountain of Youth he had ever seen. It was in the hieroglyphs on the walls. It was in the papyrus rolled in jars. Not only did the texts contain a partial list of ingredients, but the texts indicated that it had been
“Honestly, Harry, the Manor hasn’t been my home for a long time. We can turn it into our holiday getaway or something. A museum. An orphanage, if you like.”
“Come on, Malfoy,” Potter said, straddling Draco's hips in the dark. The dark--thank Merlin for that. Potter was standing over him in the middle of the night wearing an almost identical outfit as the fated morning of the door incident.

When Draco stepped out of the cafe to explore the streets, nearly everyone he passed was excitedly talking about the grand events at the palace. Apparently there had already been a majestic, coordinated flight of hippogriffs and an excellent opening speech by the Minister that morning. The grand guest of honour was shaking hands with the citizenry in the Grand Throne Room. (Draco laughingly wondered if Harry would finally shake his bloody hand if it was his civic
"A pain in the arse," Draco said mindlessly, wriggling his hips to try and urge Harry's fingers deeper. Harry was a delight in the arse, really, and that was the problem.
“So did I,” he admitted, although his voice cracked with the effort. “Water.” Granger returned with a glass of water. She helped Draco to a seated position and pressed it to his lips, since he still couldn’t lift his limbs. The water helped dramatically, and he could already feel himself coming back to life. He was even able to roll his wrists and wriggle his fingers.
; it wasn’t like he couldn’t handle himself. But Draco was still worried. He hated not knowing where Harry was. He hated not knowing whether or not he was
Draco stared at the fountain, waiting for something to happen. Waiting for the house elf to return with someone to heal or scold him. Waiting for the first potion to...well,
.” Oh no. He was Professor Malfoy again. “When I asked you to find a volunteer, I most certainly did not mean a house elf. You need a fellow faculty member--not a house elf or even a student--you need someone who is competent enough to deal with the unexpected and has at least some basic knowledge of potions or healing spells.”
"Maybe," Harry conceded, his arms tightening a little around Draco. "But I'm still glad you were so obsessed with finding it. It led you back to me."
Similar to the time Draco had extended a hand in Hagrid's old holding pen, Harry just stared at it. Instead of taking Draco's hand, Harry leaned forward and brushed his lips against Draco’s mouth. It was soft, brief, and just as delightfully unexpected as their first kiss had been; in fact, it was even better because this time Draco knew there were no potions were involved. “Take care of yourself, Malfoy.” When he reached the door, Harry audibly opened his mouth as if to say something else, but then stepped into the hall and quietly latched the door behind him.
been to try and settle down—especially not with his former archenemy, of all people. He knew all that.
Witches and wizards had been whispering about a Fountain of Youth for hundreds of years. It wasn’t some mythological fountain like existed in Muggle folklore. No, it was real. It
“Ha, ha, Potter,” Draco said flatly, slamming the trapdoor closed with his foot. “It’s good to see you’ve matured.”
“Or you could be a Gryffindor about the whole thing and just accept that you and I are brilliant without over-analyzing every little detail.”
The absolute last thing Draco had ever expected was for Potter's children to invent creative ways to get Harry and Draco in the same space. If Draco didn't know any better, he'd think they were actively
“Oh dear!” A small old woman exclaimed, shuffling by them excitedly as she hastened toward the palace. At first Draco thought she might be reacting to
The truth was, he already thought about Potter far more often than he would have liked. He often wondered how Potter was doing, but he refused to ever try and find out. He thought about those wonderful times he had grimaced at Potter, insulted Potter, tried to be better than Potter, disliked Potter, despised Potter, hated Potter, hated Potter,
Harry Potter, so Draco didn't want to discard the possibility that he could still be around somewhere. Draco had no desire to run into Harry and give the Death Eaters the opportunity they desired.
Malfoy’s stomach turned, and no amount of Harry Potter brain compartmentalizing could help him now. The giant that had been sitting on the Potter box had run away, the nails and sticking charms had come undone, and his Harry Potter emotions were now oozing all over the inside of his brain cavity.
Eventually, everyone else left the table except for Harry, Draco, Granger, Weasley, and the children. They had repositioned themselves so that they were all sitting a little closer to each other, and Weasley was telling some ridiculous story about something that had happened during a Quidditch game that year, but Draco wasn't really paying attention.  With a good meal, a good bourbon, and the Ministers’ compliments in his ears, Draco settled back and watched Lily lead her brothers and cousins in a game of Exploding Snap. With Harry at one side, his new friends on the other, and the children laughing across the table, Draco felt like he was part of something. Something important. It wasn’t important in the same sense that being a prefect or winning a Quidditch match or winning a seat in the Ministry was important. It was better. It was important, because for the first time in a long time, he felt
Draco shrugs, jolting them both lightly. “I don’t know,” he answers. “I saw you and it just felt right, I knew I would be safe with you.”
Pushing himself up off the ground and on to wobbly legs, he suddenly feels a lot older than twenty-seven, aged horribly by the events of the day. He watches as Blaise gets up far more gracefully, not a wrinkle in sight on his pristine jet black suit. He grips Harry’s shoulder firmly in what he thinks is another reassuring gesture before dropping his arm and looking towards the tent.
Harry’s hand twitches on the table, itching to reach out to the man. “Why?” He asks. “What have I ever done that would suggest otherwise? I’ve never treated you like you were less than anyone else.”
Harry curses under his breath, pushing himself up into a sitting position right as a little body collides with Draco’s, almost knocking him over. He watches as Draco wraps his arms around the excited child, pulling him into his lap.
Another week at the beach house passes with so many chances and always something getting in the way. He’s ready to scrap it all, to throw away the ring and just hope that Draco doesn’t leave him for never proposing.
The man is strikingly beautiful, leaning against the tree he’s now realising they’re sat against; further away from the tent than he remembers walking. The light of the full moon bounces off the snow, illuminating everything in an eerie white glow.
Rose shakes her head, curls bouncing. “Both mummy and daddy said it was okay because you are one,” she beams.
Unable to stop himself, he plants his hand next to Draco’s head and lowers himself down to capture the man’s lips in his own, hips still pounding into him. They kiss urgently, a messy clash of lips and teeth and panting breaths. It’s all too much, the warmth engulfing him, their tongues sliding against each other, Draco’s hand coming up to thread into his hair.
Smiling politely, he places a hand on the small of Draco’s back. “Do you mind if I borrow Draco for a moment? We have something to discuss.”
“You try doing all the work for once,” Harry retorts before a yawn surprises him. He’s tired, the stress of the day hitting him all at once.
Blaise takes in a few more gasping breaths, finally calming down. He grins at Harry, teeth sharp. Fucking Purebloods and their perfect teeth.
It’s not what he intended to say, and by the stricken look on Draco’s face, not at all what the other man expected.
Harry really doesn’t think he should be concerned about wedding etiquette right now but he thinks he better not mention it. “And then what?” he asks, the end coming out a little strangled when Draco gets a hand into his trousers and starts rubbing his half-hard cock through his boxers.
Draco blinks up at him. Harry wonders if he slept at all, the bags under his eyes a deep purple. “Come back to bed,” Harry begs. “Whatever this is—it’ll still be here in the morning. You look like death.”
“It’s been what, five years?” Ron asks. Harry just nods, not seeing what that has to do with anything. “You’ve been sleeping together for five years, he’s at Grimmauld basically every night—he comes to Sunday dinner Harry.”
Draco’s answering smile is pressed into Harry’s chest, awakening the butterflies that have lived there for far too long. “Me too.”
He gets an eager nod in reply, laughing as he almost gets headbutted in the process. They stay like that for a while, Harry fucking him slowly with his fingers—trying to prepare him. Draco revels in it, whimpering little moans falling past his parted lips. They exchange lazy kisses, a soft sort of heat behind them. He wants more, his cock aching to replace his fingers, but hurting Draco is not an option.
Draco sighs, looking down on him with something like pity shining in his tired eyes. “You deserve more than this—than me.”
“Don’t be silly uncle Harry, you love us lots and lots,” Rose says very matter-of-factly. His heart clenches right as Draco’s face drops, he catches the sour expression before the man quickly masks it. Well, isn’t that fucking great.
“Of course I know, Potter. Likely before you did,” he says cryptically and Harry can’t decipher what
Draco looks down at the offending fabric and then at Harry’s robes and groans loudly. “That’s deeply embarrassing, Potter. Go change.”
in his voice is enough to break Harry’s resolve, unable to hold back any longer. He pulls his fingers out completely, satisfaction blooming in his chest when Draco whines at the loss. The hand still clamped around his cock eases off, allowing him to wrap his own hand around it. With a fresh lubrication spell, he slicks himself up, surprised at how close he feels to the edge already.
Draco audibly gulps, eyes flicking between the two of them. “We’re friends, we have needs, we satisfy those needs together. That’s all.”
Overwhelmed, he pulls away and buries his face in Draco’s neck, nipping at the spot where the long line of his neck meets his collarbone. “You feel so fucking good,” he groans, muffled. Draco tugs at his hair gently. “Think I could stay inside you forever,” he confesses.
The snow is falling thick and fast when they apparate to the back of the tent, not wanting to risk being seen coming out of the closet together. Throwing up a charm to protect them from the flurries, they find their way around to the entrance, previously untouched snow crunching beneath their shoes.
There’s a small sound of annoyance at being interrupted before the blond man closes the book, placing it gently onto the bedside table. “So it’s going to be one of those nights?” He asks, turning towards Harry with a raised eyebrow.
Blaise snorts. “As much as I’d love to, I think that’s your job,” the way he says it is oddly gentle, as if he’s worried he might scare him. “You should do it. Soon—before it’s too late.”
In truth, they are both far too gone for each other. They bicker and tease and actually argue often, but most people can’t stand to be in a room with them for more than an hour or two. More than once, they’ve had to be reminded that other people exist; too lost in each other to acknowledge anyone else. If someone were to tell him at the start of all this that this is where they would be so many years down the line, he’d probably have hexed them into oblivion. He wouldn’t change a thing, knows Draco wouldn’t either no matter how much he protests.
. It would probably be very difficult to explain to whomever occupied the room after him, but he had grown kind of fond of the silly thing. Maybe the next occupant would too. Draco wasn’t sure he would even be able to sleep anymore without silk pillows and the sound of trickling vermouth at night. He would find out soon enough, he supposed. He slung his dragon-leather satchel over his shoulder, took one last look at his rooms, and made his way outside.
want me to, do you? Aren't I supposed to stay here for the next 24 hours?” he grinned. “To assist you? For science?” Potter eagerly leaned forward again, but Draco held out his hand to stop him.
“Lay off the mead, Potter.” Draco stepped into his quarters and turned abruptly. Potter was still grinning at him like a childish idiot. Draco slammed the door in his face and leaned his back against it, groaning. “I am in hell,” he muttered. And it must have been true, because he felt impossibly warm.
Draco gulped air and glued his eyes to Potter’s face. Beads of water kept dripping from his hair onto his cheeks and damn it all if Draco didn’t find himself wanting to lick them away. Merlin, he had to
, said nothing about helping with Draco’s potions experiments that night like he had promised, and hurriedly shuffled off without a word as soon as the meeting was over. He supposed he would just need to find someone else for help with his potions work, if there was anyone else left who was willing to volunteer.
Draco grunted incoherently, his head falling backward between his shoulder blades as his fingers spread flat and wide against the shower tile. Harry swirled his hot tongue in teasing circles around the tip of his cock and Draco stared at the top of the wall behind him, seeing stars. The golden heat, swirling pleasurably around his cock beneath Harry’s tongue was almost too much.
wanted to kiss that mouth. And Potter, his eyes still dark and glossy and undoubtedly staring at Draco’s lips, tilted his head up toward him, his eyes almost pleading. Although it may have started as a game, Potter's reaction was most certainly not pretend. The room began to spin, although Draco wasn’t sure if it was from the alcohol or the fact that he had Potter so close, where he
.” Potter’s voice sounded strained, like he was struggling to find the balance between casual friendship and genuine concern.
“During my time in Siberia--and at several other dig sites, in fact--I found reference to an ancient potion that I would like to learn more about. My studies finally pointed me toward ancient Egyptian ruins, but the ruins had already been explored by wizard and archaeologist Havartus Carter. Carter, as it turns out, donated most of his findings to two locations. I believe the potion, as well as additional texts about it, are now stored here at Hogwarts somewhere. I was hoping to obtain your permission to search the grounds for them.”
Pale blue light shivered from the end of his wand and slithered into the air like a river. And then it was growing. Widening. Gaining legs. Gaining wings. Draco watched as a small Hebridean Black dragon, roughly five feet high, gracefully flew toward the dementor. The dementor hissed in protest, screaming in shrill whispers. There was a flash of light, and it was gone. The dragon landed on all fours, its wings upright and outstretched, its long neck and even longer tail snaking gracefully behind it. Draco smiled, suddenly wanting to cry as he held out his hand to it. The dragon pressed its nose forward and through his fingers, then turned its head. It brought its face to Harry’s chest, nudged, and then faded away.
Granger allowed Weasley to carry her back toward the door from which they came. “See you at breakfast, Harry!” she called as Weasley pressed his mouth to her neck and slammed the door closed with his foot.
“Mmm.” There was a pause as Harry shifted, burrowing a little deeper into the curve of Draco’s chest. “It suits you, I suppose. Mysterious. Aggressive. Pointy. Enjoys torturing stags.”
Potter flushed and Draco stared into his glass, but they didn’t move their elbows. Potter had tried going home with a
Potter laughed. It was a tight, breathy, almost angry sound, but it was an improvement. “He did, didn’t he? I’m glad he wasn’t the one to carry me back to Hogwarts after he killed me, or I think I might’ve—”
they would be staying at an upscale hotel. After all, he was in the company of the Golden Trio: the grand celebration’s guest of honor and two honored guests. Of
“Morning, Draco,” Cornelius had muttered without even looking up. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you about--” Draco had stumbled toward the door and out of the caravan as if Cornelius had come down with dragonpox. He ran into the forest without a morsel of breakfast and couldn’t even be bothered to care.
? He was faced with two members of the Ministry--one of whom even remembered his father--and there was no talk of Dark Lords or Death Eaters or Dark Marks or past mistakes. There was no judgment, no suspicious glares. Had enough time finally passed? Had he finally rebuilt the Malfoy name? He must have, because he was being praised for his merits and research, rather than being judged for his past. He was being
Now that his life was in real danger, he couldn’t believe he had actually entrusted a house elf with this task. Or anyone else, really. Potter was useless at potions; there was no way he would have been able to whip up any sort of antidote even if he'd wanted to.
to fill the time.” Draco finished the spell and a rope ladder unfurled itself down one of the dirt walls.
“Potter!” he called a little edgily. Potter stopped a few feet away from the bar, looking questioningly at Draco. Draco closed the gap between them, flattened both of his palms against Potter’s chest, and
“Crimony,” Weasley smiled, still standing in his undershorts, his eyes glistening at Granger. “You just scolded Malfoy like he was an eleven year old boy.”
"Yes, Potter," Draco rolled his eyes with a smile, "Don't I look it?" Draco finally looked Potter in the eyes for the first time since he'd arrived and his stomach clenched. Potter was wearing well-fitted navy jeans and a white long-sleeved jersey knit that fit him more closely than Draco would have liked. He could see the lines of muscle beneath the shirt at Potter’s arms, the way it followed his waist. Draco looked instead at Potter’s neckline, where he could see a wide V of skin, Potter’s collarbone, and a thin tuft of dark chest hair. Nope. That wasn’t helping either.
Draco stepped out of the Faculty Room, relieved to be free of it and hoping he wasn’t in any sort of trouble with Granger. Potter was leaning against the wall just outside the room with his arms folded over his chest, and Draco hastened past him down the hall.
, and he had only just walked beyond the palace gates. The sun had already set, and he was beginning to worry that he wouldn’t be able to catch Harry at the grand feast.
He did not have time to speak as Malfoy stood up, muttering a small goodbye to his friends, and walked out of the Great Hall, Harry hot on his heels. Outside the doors of the hall, Malfoy turned and demanded him to explain himself.
"Don't look so shocked!" Malfoy stated. "Did you honestly think you were not going to get it right under my tutelage?"
