"What do you want, Potter?" He asked, his inflection on his surname as though it were a physically sickening disease, very much copied from Malfoy's patented drawl. Harry ignored him, however, making eye contact with Draco and allowing a small smirk that was neither too enthusiastic nor too nuanced.
win out, making her just as bad as him, if not worse?
"Ok… thanks, Draco." He said finally, his voice a little scratchy. The mercurial eyes met his green ones, tired and hollow and scared.
The logical part of her brain agreed, of course. They were neither prepared for nor familiar with a hostage situation. They didn't know what to do with Draco, what would be the smartest way to play their newly acquired advantage, if that's what it was. But they also didn't know what the Order would do to him, other than get any and all information out of him by any means necessary.
“I need to talk to you…somewhere quiet. I don’t…want anyone else around.” He said. Another flash of fear, and Draco seemed to be instantly wary of his friend, stopping in his tracks.
Harry’s true self, or so he thought at least, felt like he was watching through a thick layer of clear ice, seeing everything but lacking the strength to break through. He wondered if Crabbe was feeling similarly…or Draco, for that matter. Perhaps he’d made himself somewhere safe to go in his mind, where he couldn’t feel the pain in his body. But…judging from the truly anguished sobs coming from Draco, it seemed he was all too present…
He didn't fall asleep for a while, still hyperaware of his partner's breathing and muscle tension in case he was needed again. Instead, he looked around the room from his position on the sofa bed, holding Draco close and stroking his slightly damp hair. He memorised the cracks in the walls' plaster, the little mouldings that ran along the edge of the ceiling and around the light fixture.
“Hermione...thanks…” he said softly, still sniffling.  She smiled and hugged him back. Then she had an idea and grinned.
“Zey are such beautiful creatures! Elegant and fierce: ze perfect woman, non?”
"Easier said than done." He said, and he didn't know how right he was.
The budding bromance the whole school is talking about takes a turn.
"At.. at least then it was my doing, I had control over it..." He said quietly, sitting down on one of the stone benches lining the wall to pull his socks on. The bottoms of them were dirty, despite Draco owning at least 3 pairs of expensive slippers. The storm-cloud eyes were perpetually downcast, shoulders tensed and high around his neck, like he feared an attack at any moment.
“Harry, we’re heading back to the castle. The snow’s getting worse.” Hermione called from across the shop. He turned and nodded. He bought the beautiful little brass sculpture that turned and played a very pretty lullaby-like song, vaguely planning to give it to Fleur for Christmas, and they left, thanking the shopkeeper as they went. The snow was heavier now, the wind picking up as well, and they bundled themselves up for the walk back. They were just heading out of Hogsmeade, the walled road stretching out whitely before them, when Harry spotted a gold and black shape moving past out of the corner of his eye. He turned his head and saw Draco Malfoy walking further into the village, alone, his white hair shining like a Golden Snitch. The surging need to catch it filling him, his Monster waking up instantly.
“Why…are you here…? Why did you come in? You must have asked the room to open.” he asked, eyes narrowing slightly. Harry cleared his throat nervously and shrugged.
'What
Mrs Weasley was her usual gracious self, cooking for them all hours of the day, ‘fattening Harry up’ becoming her personal mission when she saw him.
He went to bed, warm and slightly drunk, after a couple more shots with the others, barely recalling what had happened in that shelter it was all such a painful blur, and fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.
“What list would that be?” he asked in a sneering sort of way, having no idea what to expect. Harry looked at him and smiled.
"And Harry's a labrador or something."
“I don’t know, Harry, I’m sorry. I assume going to the Room of Requirement with… people, gets rid of his symptoms?” she asked, clearly still embarrassed they were discussing it. Harry sighed and nodded.
“I don't deserve her, Hermione, I don't deserve anything! What I did to Draco, he's
"Good night, Draco." He said gently, getting into bed. Draco paused, heart racing, before almost running across the room and joining his friend in bed. He folded himself up, burying his face in Blaise's warm neck.
The Malfoy boy was close to fainting when they finally arrived at the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching ballet to his trolls. They didn't met anyone on the way, thank God; he would have had no explanation for such a strange scene.
to spend time with you, mad as that sounds…” he said, adding the last part almost to himself. Draco frowned at him. “Anyway, its bloody Christmas,  you're supposed to spend it with people you'd rather not spend time with.” he sighed, then grinned. “There's a chess set here, if you fancy it?” he asked with a chuckle, pulling a large box out from under the coffee table. Draco sighed dramatically and returned to sit down, crossing his legs and glaring at Potter.
“Not to mention starting your NEWTs prep.” George added with a chuckle, to which Hermione nodded gravelly without the slightest trace of humour.
"No manipulation, Professor, from either of us. It's… more of a mutual benefit." He said, his cheeks flushing hot. "Plus, weird as it sounds, we actually quite like each other." He added, smiling and hoping it didn't come across as arrogant.
This time, Draco screamed. His fingers scrabbled fruitlessly against the smooth cubicle wall, crying out for Harry to stop, begging him. The Monster thrashed gleefully inside Harry as he pulled out, revealing his slightly bloodied cock. Harry watched what he could see of Draco’s bony back shiver and tense as his insides were ripped apart, his head bowed low as he sobbed, the Monster beginning to fuck him with a strength Harry, himself, did not have. Draco collapsed at some point, unable to hold himself up on quaking legs. Harry watched him as he fell against the wall, but the Monster simply held him up as it continued the use Harry’s body to rape Draco Malfoy. Harry vaguely registered how utterly disgusted he was with himself, how much he hated what he was doing to Draco. The Malfoy looked so fragile like this, so thin and in pain… But he couldn’t stop. The Monster had full control now.
Harry sighed, looking down at the list in his hands and was horrified to find it very long and double-sided. He looked at Draco, who was staring at him, eyes wide, waiting for him to attack. Harry ignored the rush of muddled feeling he got when he saw the fear in Draco’s eyes, and went over to the desk, selecting a pen and an inkwell, as well as a portable writing board, and went into the store room to begin this truly inane and tedious task. There must be magic for this sort of rubbish…
“No, Potter…don’t go…” he said softly, blushing a very delicate pink. Harry faltered for a moment, surprised and delighted.
“What is the meaning of this?” Dumbledore was striding into view from dinner. Blaise met the old man’s eyes as he looked up at him, his jaw tight, but he never moved his wand from Potter.
He dreamed of Draco, screaming, covered in blood. He dreamed of Harry Potter turning into a dragon, and burning Draco alive, then crunching on his charred bones, the blackened shards raining down around Blaise as he stood, paralysed in his own subconscious. He woke up panting, his back drenched with sweat, and he felt sick. Goyle was sitting up, wearing his pyjamas, frowning at Draco’s empty bed.
He read it quickly, though it took a moment to get used to the loopy mindfuck that was Narcissa Malfoy's handwriting.
“Do you know why you are here, Vincent?” Snape asked, his voice teachery. Crabbe shook his head. “You are aware of Draco Malfoy's...difficulties recently?”
“Professor...” he said, his voice weak from lack of use, not moving towards him. Dumbledore strode over to him, his face finally visible. He was smiling in his gentle way, half-moon spectacles perched on his crooked nose, his presence relaxing Harry as it always did.
them they can't treat you like that."
The Malfoy boy choked on a scream, wrapping his arms around Crabbe’s thick neck as he was pushed, bodily, against his friend with the force of Harry’s thrusts. A fresh trickle of blood made its way down his inner thigh when Harry pulled out almost all the way, the Monster loving the shock of dark red against the pale skin. Harry vaguely wondered what Crabbe was thinking behind his frozen eyes. What was he feeling as he watched? Angry Draco was being hurt? Scared he would be hurt too? Aroused? The thought made the Monster chuckle.
“Get away from me.” Draco hissed after a moment of deafening silence between them. Harry didn’t move, unable to understand what he was saying, what had happened. He had watched it all, watched himself do this through a frosted window, but yet he had no idea how. Harry reached out a shaking hand to touch Draco’s shoulder, but as soon as their skin touched, Draco flinched like he’d been burned and turned to look at him with the most hateful expression Harry had ever seen.
"You have to admit Heathcliff is sexy."
"Can we go to your dorm?" He asked, thinking of the closest place with a bed. Draco whimpered, clutching Harry's jumper.
“It’s ok to forgive them. I know you want to.” He said. Draco glanced at him and nodded stiffly.
“Why…?” he asked very softly, his eyes half-lidded as he stared at Harry, his lips looked dry. Harry stared back for a moment, then sighed, looking down as he shook his head.
He was with Blaise Zabini, sitting side by side in an otherwise empty booth and looking very cosy together. He looked good, not as thin as he had been at his trial, and actually
Their journey back was less straight forward than Blaise's expedition had been, the Headless Hunt had set up some kind of tournament in the corridor they were heading down so they had to detour a longer way, their hands clasped tightly together the whole time. Draco was panting by the time they finally reached their dormitory, his recent history and current recovery making him easily winded, but otherwise he seemed alright. They crept back into the dormitory, finding everyone else still asleep, and prepared for bed themselves. After a few moments of silence, Blaise looked at Draco.
“You can sleep if you want to…” Harry said, thinking Draco probably needed more sleep. Malfoy glared at him, defiance and mistrust in his colourless eyes. “I can leave if-” but to his surprise, Draco’s eyes widened before he seemed to be able to stop it, and he looked down.
He was awoken by voices, laughing and jeering, and opened his eyes to see the wall opposite him, where the bricks were usually all there was, had become an ornate doorway, and several 7th year boys were filing through it.
He noticed the pale skin of the other boy’s neck again, and pressed his lips against it. It was soft and cold, trembling. The thing inside Harry roared in pleasure, begging him for more, its hunger growing. He felt Draco go tense again, and he opened his mouth against his throat, licking it, tasting it. He brushed his teeth against it, then nibbled, then bit, hard.
…” he finished, feeling extremely awkward. At least Ron wasn’t there.
"Did you hear about Malfoy and Harry?"
“I’m…I’m going back inside, it’s too cold out he-” The Monster jabbed Harry’s wand out and made Crabbe seize Draco’s arms before he could turn away. Draco let out a yell of shock but Crabbe’s ham of a hand covered his mouth, dragging him into a small stone shelter nearby. Draco struggled and tried to scream, but the wind had picked up and took the sound before it got anywhere, and Crabbe was obviously far too strong for him. Harry followed them quickly, his Monster writhing excitedly.
Harry parted with his friends in the Entrance Hall as they headed up to the Common Room, and he went down the steep stone steps to the dungeons, and Snape’s Office. He waited there for a couple of minutes before he heard voices approaching, Slytherins on their way to their own Common Room, he assumed.
“He…he’s been attacked…” Pansy said, looking at Draco for leave to tell the truth. He closed his eyes tiredly, and nodded.
Even so, he managed to meet Blaise's eyes and keep his gaze. “Library, yeah?” Blaise asked gently, eyebrows raised earnestly, and Draco forced himself to nod. “Ok, let's go.” He said with a smile, trying to keep his tone casual. Pansy had stayed out of it, trusting Blaise to handle things, and instead focussed her energy on trying to kill Potter with her mind. He'd waltzed in, cool as you like, and had hardly even glanced at Draco and his friends.
There are good days and bad days. Good days meant he can get out of bed, eat two or three meals without even thinking about chewing and swallowing. Good days let him talk and laugh and think about the future, do his homework and sleep through the night next to Blaise. Bad days stopped all of that. He could hardly open his eyes and stretch his legs without the sensation of true, debilitating dread and fear filling ever fibre of his being. Bad days could even start as good days, then something will happen that sent the good spiralling away like it was being flushed down a toilet, never to be seen again.
“It…the room let me in…” the Potter boy sort-of lied, leaving out the fact he’d tracked him down and waited for him for over an hour, then begged the room to let him in to check on his nemesis. “Are…are you ok…?” he asked. He could see that, even from a distance, Draco was trembling, and his skin clearly beginning to bruise in places. But the Malfoy didn't seem to be listening. He leaned back on one elbow, curling his body to the side, perhaps attempting to stand up. His movements were slow, like he was fighting some invisible force, and he looked feverish. He let out a small, almost inaudible, whimper as he shifted, his hand gripping the rumpled sheets beneath him.
“I won’t, I promise… But I’ll do the work, ok? You just relax, I’ll look after you.” He said. Draco looked at him, stormy eyes wide, like he wasn’t able to believe what he was hearing. Harry smiled and kissed him deeply, rolling them over again so Draco was on his back. Harry grabbed a thick pillow and lifted Draco’s hips, placing the pillow beneath them so as not to strain his back. “Nice and gentle, ok?” he asked, genuinely wondering what Draco preferred, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck.
“Really? Um…what for?” he asked slowly.
Harry watched them moving slickly in and out of Draco’s hole, marvelling distantly at the tightness and heat. It didn’t seem real, it was like a dream…a nightmare… It reminded him vaguely of Nagini attacking Mr Weasley…how Harry had felt her rage, watched the strikes through her eyes, but he was distanced from it all… He tried to stop his hand moving, concentrating with all his might, but nothing happened, like he was completely paralysed, fighting against a barrier he couldn’t see, only feeling it’s strong, cruel presence. Yet someone was using his body, moving his fingers, his hand, without his permission.
betraying him.
Virgin. The Monster hissed excitedly, and Harry felt himself nodding as he slid his fingers through the blond hair and tightening them around it, tugging him closer. Draco winced and obeyed, shuffling closer still across the damp bathroom floor.
Draco was still mercilessly hard, the come glistening on his skin and his lust-clouded eyes making him look beautifully obscene. “Fuck…” Harry muttered again, his glasses steaming up completely so he took them off and dropped them down on the bedside table. Then he leaned over Draco, bracing himself on one hand beside Malfoy’s waist on the mattress while the other positioned his cock at Draco’s entrance. “R-ready…?” he asked, panting, the hot, twitching hole against his tip was very nearly too much for him to handle.
Harry did everything he could to help Draco, their activities lasting well into the night until they were both satisfied but completely drained, curling around each other after Harry took care of their cleanliness.
“I...I'm going back to my dormitory now…” Draco said decisively, finally getting dressed properly. He needed time alone, sleep in his own bed, take a
“Don’t be sorry, it’s ok. It’ll get easier, I promise.” He thought for a moment, before making a decision he never thought he’d need to make. “My, um...my mum was raped.” He said softly. He felt Draco inhale sharply and look at him with wide eyes.
All was well. Until it wasn’t anymore.
The Monster seemed to have an exciting idea because it made Harry grab Draco by the hair and push him over to his friend. They stood before Crabbe, Draco’s half erect cock hanging indecently from his trousers right in front of his friend, his pink and crying face clearly visible to the paralysed boy. Harry stroked Draco’s cock some more, making it flop and dance in front of him, trying to get it hard enough to leak a little, maybe even make a game of getting Crabbe in the face.
He sat down on his quilt, slowly picking up the blanket that Mrs Weasley had knitted him for his last birthday. He looked down at the bright squares of wool, feeling the soft strings between his fingers. And then he was sobbing, loud and despairing, as the reality of what had happened dawned on him.
Christmas went by happily, then New Year’s Eve with all the fireworks Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes could supply, then before anyone knew it, they were on the train back to school. Harry glimpsed Draco on the platform at King’s Cross, looking somewhat healthier and almost happy, saying goodbye to his mother with a hug.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Do you regret killing those people? All those people you can't count?" Ron asked. Draco opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. He took a deep breath, then forced the words from his chest.
Crabbe got up to go to the bar, ordering another pitcher of the cocktail. Harry wondered if they planned to get drunk, since it was a Friday. The Monster, however, saw an opportunity and forced Harry to get his wand out. Crabbe was right beside him, it was perfect.
It was nearing April when Harry was finally able to block the spell most of the time and had figured out a way to lock his thoughts away as Snape suggested: imagining everything in his head contained as the cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive, every aspect of himself becoming an object or feature inside his childhood dwelling. He changed it up sometimes, making them a chess board or a Quidditch match to see which was easier to maintain, but he always went back to that oppressive, degrading hole his aunt and uncle forced him to sleep for the first 10 years of his so far fairly short life. It was a place of hate and loneliness, but also comfort and escape, and he used that to his own advantage.
His parents were likely begging the Dark Lord to save their son from certain destruction, their (second) worse fear of him falling into the hands of Potter and his lackeys realised. Voldemort, who had made it clear that the Malfoys were no longer held in high stead, would be unwilling to waste resources on his sorry life, but would be concerned about Draco spilling his secrets.
"If we take you to the Order, they might be able to help." Harry said slowly, all of them looking at him now. He exchanged a look with Ron, then sighed. "But you will need to give them something in return." He said.
He watched himself be flipped over, could feel pillows suffocating him as he held the fabric between his teeth, and was driven into again. He felt the Bite as Greyback came, faster than usual. He hadn't been allowed to bite him before, but he'd seen it coming, hence the potion.
"I don't need Potter…" Draco muttered, upset he couldn't protect himself. Pansy held his hand and squeezed, sympathetic but firm, before letting go.
with Potter.
"Any time." He said softly, and kissed him again.
"Is this a
“Concentrate on your breathing, ok?” he said, looking at him and only him. “Don't look at him, look at me. Look at me, Draco.” He encouraged, turning slightly to face him. Draco did as he was told, tearing his eyes from Potter's flushed, smiling face, to look at Blaise's soft eyes and dark skin that looked really nice and rich in this lighting. “Good, now think about your breathing. Every breath in, every breath out. Which one is harder?” he asked, expecting an answer.
"Make sure he eats something afterwards." She added, just before the door closed and disappeared. Harry sighed, turning back to Draco on the bed.
"It's ok, it's ok, just breathe." He said gently, sitting down on bed beside him, not too close. "Does this happen a lot?" He asked. Draco took a deep, trembling breath and nodded.
“Usually?” She shrugged, her eyes lighting up as they always did when she got to explain something complicated.
“It will get better, Draco.” He promised. Draco smiled slightly and nodded.
Hello! So, in this chapter, Hermione will be discussing the similarities between the Death Eaters and the Nazis, how Draco's upbringing and the Hitler Youth are similar, how the idealism of a fascist family/community can mean the children of said family are part of said fascism and whether that means they are complicit even if they are children and brought up that way.
"Blaise..." he all but sighed, shoulders dropping from their tense altitude. "W-What time is it?" He asked, voice shaky.
The black suit Draco had been wearing that night, shirt buttoned high on his scrawny neck, had hidden the hundreds of bruises and scars he'd endured since fleeing Hogwarts. He could feel every single one as he stared into Harry's swollen face, and knew it would only destroy his humanity completely to expose the Golden Boy. He was not like them, he was
She held grudges and hurt people who hurt her friends. Draco had hurt people to protect his family. If in his situation, could she claim pacifism? Or would her own inclinations, which sometimes verged on
“They…disintegrated…” Draco muttered, sounding vaguely annoyed. Harry frowned, and sighed, pulling off his own robes to drape over Malfoy. The blond looked at him, about to be offended by Harry’s pity, but seemed to check himself and accepted the sheltering, covering fabric, still warm from Harry’s skin. He sighed and lay down, his eyes closing by themselves before he forced them open.
"Doesn't mean he's not sexy."
“Yes. We are investigating the incidents, and trying to find witnesses.” He looked at the Crabbe, it looked like he was reading a book on his face. Crabbe felt too hot, his hands going pink, and his eyes felt like they were moving too fast. He didn't want Snape to see his dreams in his eyes. “We believe you may have witnessed one of these incidents. Do you remember anything involving Draco being harmed?” he asked. Crabbe looked at him, his head buzzing, trying to think of a lie.
Blaise held him tightly as he sobbed into his shoulder, feeling his bones through his clothes. He glanced over to see Pansy walk around the bed, and she sat beside them, tears in her eyes as she joined the hug, stroking Draco’s hair gently.
“I’m sorry, Draco…I’m so sorry…” then tears were falling down Draco’s cheeks, but not from Draco’s eyes, which were closed. Pansy shoved Blaise away, hissing about waking him up, and gently wiped Blaise’s tears from Draco’s skin. Blaise’s chest was burning with sobs, surging in his lungs, and he had to almost run from the Hospital Wing before he could let it out, not wishing to wake Draco.
"What about Potter?" Crabbe asked, rather out of nowhere. They all looked at him in surprise, eyes wide. Pansy and Blaise looked at each other, then at Draco, eyebrows raised in question. Draco frowned.
"You little piece of shit, we should have let them keep you-" Ron spat, fighting against Harry's hold, wanting to beat the shit out of Malfoy. The raised voice and sudden movement had Draco back in his defensive position, arms over his head and face, legs protecting his torso. Harry tried to subdue Ron while Hermione and Luna just… watched.
“W…what…?” he asked, his blood running cold.
“Why are you asking him? I’m a woman, Crabbe, I’d be a much better person to ask.”
Harry saw Draco nod almost imperceptibly and slid the letter, unopened, into his pocket. Harry pretended the confirming exchanged hadn't taken place, seamlessly returning to the table's conversation on their favourite cereals, which was inevitably becoming Muggle vs. Wizarding.
Draco stopped them at a space of blank wall and, with all the authority he could muster, said “Triskaidekaphobia.” The wall then fell away to reveal a passage into the Common Room.
“Hey, mate, you alright?” he asked, seeing Harry's tear streaked face, but Hermione grabbed them both by the hand and they practically ran down the corridor. They went all the way down to the Entrance Hall and out into the misty, rainy afternoon where they'd won the match.
“Hi, fancy seeing you here.” Harry said, feeling stupid. Blaise huffed a laugh, nodding. There was a pause, and Harry thought about running.
He gently moved Draco to lie on his back. He looked down at the boy beneath him, his flushed cheeks and long eyelashes, and realised how fond he was of him. How odd that they used to hate each other… At that moment, he could barely remember why. He just wished their first kiss, every kiss they'd shared since, had been shared when they both wanted to. He couldn't remember that either, their first kiss, it had all been such a blur.
“Put it in your mouth.” The Monster snarled, and Draco’s eyes closed as he obeyed, his thin pale eyebrows trembling in a frown as he let the hot stiffness into his mouth. Harry’s hips moved forward, the Monster holding Draco’s head still. Draco’s eyes widened in alarm, trying to push himself away from the intrusion. “Suck.” Harry stared down at him, watching him begin to suck, his eyes squeezed shut. Harry let out a shuddering moan as he felt the hot wetness around his cock, velvety tongue tentatively making contact with the underside. Draco let out a small, voiceless sob when the Monster pushed Harry further into his mouth, his hand opened and desperately trying to remove the hot, thick organ before it went down his throat.
"Fine… fine. I'll speak to Potter." He said, feeling the coin in his pocket that connected to Harry's Muggle one. It had only been two weeks since their time in the Room of Requirement together, but tonight would be a good time to 'summon' him. Dinner was served early on Sundays, then anyone who wanted it could have supper in their Common Rooms. The corridors would be empty. He just needed to wait, and work out what the hell he was going to say. God, this was going to be humiliating...
“Draco… Draco, can I…? I’m going to explode…” he panted, already rubbing the lube into his own aching cock. Draco looked at him, eyes wide and wet with tears, and nodded hesitantly. Harry made an effort to catch his breath, his overwhelming arousal making everything rather difficult. “Ok…” he whispered mostly to himself, kneeling up on the mattress and taking hold of Draco’s hips, pulling them up so his bum was lifted off the mattress.
"S-secret passages. Easier to... get around undisturbed." He practically wheezed, feeling completely bereft of oxygen.
Draco himself, the Draco now, who would never dream of greeting Greyback the way he had, looked at his own body, bent and taken, as Greyback’s bulk covered him and thrust with so much strength. His mind felt far away, disconnected from the whole body agony he knew well. The last time he felt it was a little over a week ago, he thought, maybe a bit more.
"We'd love to." Hermione said, when Harry failed to speak. Or move. He was staring at Draco as he spoke, and now couldn't seem to look away. Heat was bubbling in both of their blood.
"Harry, what the
me, and Katie, and Dumbledore. Just because he's
"You… fucking snivelling coward." Ron hissed. "You murdered innocent people to save your evil bastard self and your evil bastard parents." Draco's eyes, not wet, looked into Ron's.
how to do it.” he hissed, adjusting his grip on the wand.
“Yeah…just, you know, seeing you…like this… Being mistreated…” Draco pushed himself up on one arm at that, angry, though his face paled a little at the movement.
He located him eventually, sitting at a table near the bar with Blaise, Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle. Harry felt the rage of his Monster, a bubbling anger in his chest when it realised Draco wouldn’t be alone without some work. Harry sat down at the bar near their table, hopefully out of the way so no one would sit on him.
OK, I hope I've explained myself well so, now, please enjoy!
Harry chuckled the Monster’s chuckle, another heated wave of rage and lust filling him, his cock bobbing excitedly at Draco’s sobs. He grabbed the scruff of Draco’s neck, dragging him up and slamming him back into the cubicle wall, the metal rattling around them with the force. Harry ripped open Draco’s white shirt, revealing his chest, just as white, very slender and toned from Quidditch, with pale little nipples. Harry’s hand moved over his chest, feeling the ribs, slow but not tender. Still panting and coughing, Draco looked at him with utter terror in his eyes.
He and Pansy sat down at Pomfrey’s desk, silently waiting. There were murmurings from behind the curtain, it sounded like they were asking Draco questions, but his replied were too soft to hear.
The next morning was a blur of questions, stares, and scathing, biting rumours. The whole school knew about Blaise loudly confronting Harry Potter in the Entrance Hall, and that it had something to do with Draco Malfoy. Rumours included use of the Cruciatus Curse or some other awful torture spell, Harry attacking Draco with a poisoned knife, and the two of them having a duel that ended in Malfoy’s death – though lots of people seemed to know Draco was in the Hospital Wing, and was alive.
Harry pulled on his own discarded boxers, gathered his own gifts and went to sit in front of the fire, laying the bundles on the coffee table he didn’t recall being there before. “I’m starving…” he said, with a happy sigh.
Harry let out a soft hiss at the contact, Draco’s hand was cold against his hot, hard cock. Draco stared at it in fear.
“Do you remember anything?” she asked him. She and Blaise had done some research into the spell Draco said Potter used;
“Now, now, Draco…we mustn’t talk to our superiors like that.” Draco looked even angrier, the Malfoy instinct telling him to deny being inferior to anyone, when the Monster grabbed a handful of his blond hair and threw him to the floor with such force that he ended up at Crabbe’s feet. Draco scrambled to right himself, using the bench and Crabbe himself to get up, but Harry swooped down on him, grabbing him by the neck and pulling him to his feet in front of Crabbe, whom he could see was fully conscious and watching through his paralysis. His eyes couldn’t move, couldn’t blink, but it was clear he could see it all, unable to stop himself. The Monster thrashed excitedly, stretching its muscles, preparing, like it were about to go for a jog. It was really going to enjoy this.
"I killed them to protect myself and my family. The Death Eaters kept us alive because we were an amusement." He said, through clenched teeth. "I regret having to do it, but I would do
Anything could be useful, the Order  will know what to do with it." Draco's eyes were wide with panic, shaking his head.
“Potter…? What do you- H-how did you get in?” he demanded, looking between Harry and where the door usually appeared, now blank wall once again.
They were in a large, firelit bedroom, the walls stone, the huge windows showing the grey, storm-darkened countryside. There was a neat desk, neat bookshelves and potions equipment, a cauldron heating over the fire that felt somehow cold, a meticulously made bed. A second Draco Malfoy, the memory version of him, was sitting on the emerald-coloured duvet. His face was distorted somehow, amorphous, like there was a smudge on Harry's glasses that wouldn't wipe away.
"I had no idea." She said, though she didn't seem at all surprised.
She still looked unconvinced, and he sighed, stepping closer to her and lowering his voice. "Speak to Snape, tell him I said you can know. It's for Draco, to keep him safe, and Snape's in on it. We've got it worked out with Draco's mum." He almost whispered, looking into her eyes. She looked surprised, but quashed it and nodded. "It needs to stay quiet. We're trying to keep it inside the school only, but Snape will help if it gets back to, you know… them." He practically breathed the last word, a cold chill running down his spine, and she nodded.
Short update after a long wait - sorry! But things are happening and change is in the air (both in the story and IRL!).
“She’d just killed Sirius, the only family he had left, right in front of him! All Malfoy does is insult him, he’s never done anything like that-” they both looked up when the Portrait Hole opened, Ron’s sentence dying in the air. Professor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore stepped inside, then Harry behind them.
He’d gone out for some flying, out of practice as he was, trying to get back into it and to clear his racing mind. His place as Seeker, not to mention Team Captain, was under speculation, he knew, and Quidditch practice had yet to restart after Christmas. Flying had felt good, right, able to focus his mind on just the wind in his hair, the cold rain stinging his face, and the feeling of weightlessness. He'd been soaring until he suddenly lost concentration, his mind wandering back to all the awful things he'd done under Voldemort's control, how his own arrogance and unwillingness to accept Snape as his teacher to the point of stopping Occlumency classes had made him vulnerable to it. The problems in his mind weren't getting any better, the nightmares and sudden feelings of hate and anger not entirely his own ever present, and yet he refused to swallow his pride and return to Snape. Even if what he did wasn't his fault, why it happened certainly was.
The Monster made Harry’s face grin, and grab a fistful of Draco’s hair to pull him away from Crabbe. Draco made an almost whiny noise, trying to hold onto his friend’s cloak, like it would stop it hurting.
"First, how many Muggles and Muggle-borns have you murdered, personally? Half-bloods, non-wizards, creatures, blood traitors?" Ron asked, tone flat and sharp like a dagger. Draco swallowed thickly, his eyes darting towards Harry only to remember Ron's command and stopped himself.
“Harry!” Hermione cried, breathlessly, and Ron stood up. Harry barely glanced at them.
“Yeah, I definitely get that…” he said with a sigh, thinking of all the things he’d put his own friends through over the years. “So…it has to be sex? Have you tried…blowjobs? If it’s just cum it might-” but Draco was shaking his head.
Draco woke up panting and freezing, like every night, and like every night Blaise felt his sudden movement, sensing his distress, and stirred beside him.
“Are you leaving?” Harry asked, turning to look at him over the back of the sofa. Draco looked at him, frowning slightly.
Then none other than Draco Malfoy stepped around the corner just ahead, not 10 feet away. Instantly, a wave of hatred washed over Harry, making his skin hot and jaw tight, stopping in his tracks. He would have shouted at Draco, just for someone to take his rage out on, and who better, but Malfoy spotted him first. He turned to face Harry, smirking.
They finally arrived at the Slytherin common room, Draco having whispered ‘agoraphobia’ to a blank wall in the dungeons, which then dissolved to reveal the passageway. They went in and Draco quickly grabbed a discarded Slytherin robe from a chair.
“W...what...?” he asked breathlessly. Blaise looked at him, his big shiny eyes, and smiled sadly.
Sunday breakfast was a much more casual affair to other meals, only half the school even attended and it went on for longer. Lots of people with friends outside their own houses (usually Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, but occasionally a Slytherin or two will mix with the others), took the opportunity to spend some time with said friends over the meal.
“Come with me.” She said, grabbing his hand and pulling him back along the corridor. She stopped at the Fat Lady, telling Harry to wait there while she said the password and went back in. He stood there, fighting the anger in his belly at being left, she was probably avoiding being with him, sick of his whining and- Red hair appeared through the portrait, not Ginny, thank Merlin, but Ron! He looked worriedly at Harry. He was holding a bottle of Firewhiskey, about a third of it gone, and he was a bit bleary-eyed and swayed slightly on his feet as he stepped through.
on the Muggles as well, must have gained their trust enough to feed them the potion. Maybe it was forced down their throats when they couldn't fight back.
by these boys. His last rambled words struck a cord deep inside Harry's chest, the same as he'd felt when he saw how truly damaged Draco was, and he gently took the glass from his tight fingers, moving it safely aside and pulling the boy into a hug.
“He ate a bit of dinner last night, I made him.” Blaise’s deep voice said, trying to defend Draco, but Pansy just sighed loudly.
“Crucio.” He hissed, an impulse he’d never felt before taking over, the unknown wrath consuming him. Draco screamed, staggering another few steps before collapsing, curling in on himself on the stone floor, convulsing horribly. Harry stopped the spell as soon as he realised what he’d done, his own heart pounding and his stomach churning as Draco twitched and sobbed on the floor. How could he have done that?! Harry thought, disgusted with himself.
“My mother buys excellent gifts...” He said softly, fingers sweeping over the metallic red paper. Harry watched him for a moment before speaking, hoping he wasn't out of line.
“Your…your shoulder’s bleeding…” Harry said, almost like it made his point.
“What was that, dear?” Madam Rosmerta asked Crabbe. The Monster obviously understood the Imperius Curse much better than Harry because it made Crabbe say his order again and she nodded, going off to fill the pitcher, none the wiser. When she brought it to him, the Monster made him pay, and return to his seat like nothing had happened. Harry was confused, feeling himself being pushed back in his own mind as the Monster settled into his skin, eyes staring fixedly at Draco Malfoy.
“Whoa, mate…sorry, didn’t mean to scare you… What the bloody hell happened to your face?” Draco was still staring at him, grey eyes wide, but he seemed to calm himself down, letting out a shaky breath. Pansy rushed in, glaring at his bruised cheekbone.
He crept in, unsure if he should make an effort to be heard or not, and quickly spotted Draco. He was sitting in the huge tub full of water, looking absolutely tiny in the massive space. His long skinny legs were drawn up to his chest under the water, arms crossed over his knees and head resting on them. Blaise thought maybe he was asleep, so decided to make as much noise as possible to wake him up without actually touching him. He closed the door as loudly as he could without slamming it and cleared his throat, the sounds echoing through the room and over the water.
"Too many people...! The Room-" he cut himself of with a small sob, his knees buckling. Harry held him up, understanding what he meant, and hightailed it upstairs to the Room of Requirement as quickly as he could, practically carrying Draco.
He took a deep breath, and spoke again. "I- I tested it on the people the Snatchers brought in. The Death Eaters thought it was poison but it was modified wolfsbane, of sorts. I wanted to know the effects, if it protected them. It worked well, they even said it made them feel better, but… they never lived very long once Greyback got hold of them. The point was: those he didn't kill, didn't turn." He admitted this new insight in a torrent, like he just wanted it out. "I started taking it myself whenever he-" Draco's voice caught, his breath hitching and gasping out of him. Harry's body reacted before his mind could tell it not to, moving to sit on the Draco, leaving a cushion between them for his comfort.
Harry felt the sting of it needing to be shown, but he understood.
“No, I have… other help now, thanks.” he said, hating how weak his voice sounded, how weak he
When Snape finally returned at 6 o’clock, he found both boys bore very clear signs of a physical fight. Draco even had bruises around his neck, like Potter had strangled him.
One day, they were sitting together in the library, doing their Charm work, when a ruckus attracted their attention. Potter and the other Gryffindors were celebrating, they'd just won the Quidditch game by the sounds of it. Potter had been allowed to stay on as Seeker, and captian, despite those Slytherins in the know fiercely refuting his right to keeping his Chosen One privileges. Draco couldn't stand the thought of going to games now, the crowds and noise and people chanting Potter's name would be more than he could stand, so Blaise stayed with him while the matches were happening. He'd never been interested in Quidditch anyway, and enjoyed the time alone with Draco. They could talk properly in the mostly empty library or Common Room, and sat closer together than they usually could.
“Potter…Potter raped him… Apparently it’s happened before, a couple of times.” He said, feeling numb. Goyle’s jaw clenched tightly, wringing his huge hands, his expression dark and sad.
When they arrived at the castle, the two Slytherins went straight down to the dungeons. As soon as Draco was out of Harry’s sight, the Monster went back to sleep, and Harry had to sprint to the closest bathroom to vomit. He thought he’d reached the pinnacle of how disgusting he could find himself after last time…but this was too much. He curled up in the bathroom stall under his cloak, and sobbed. A second year even came in, but was frightened off by the disembodied crying. He sat there for what could have been hours, sobbing and thinking about how he’d left Draco in a very similar situation just week before…and now he’d involved another person… He thought it would never happen again, he would have rather died…yet here he was.
“I...I'm scared..” He admitted, needing to get it out despite how childish it sounded. It had felt amazing the first time, arms wrapped around him with nothing but gentleness, and yet he was afraid. Blaise nodded and offered his hand, which Draco accepted after a moment's hesitation. His grip was lax at first, then tightened around Blaise's hand like it was an anchor.
“I’m sorry…” he said softly. Draco made a small whimper-like noise, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry sank lower, closer, kissing his neck as he manoeuvred his clothing to pull his own erection out. He huffed against Draco’s skin in relief, struggling not to let himself come. Their bare erections finally touched and Draco bit down on his own lip hard, apparently catching himself before he lost it again. Harry pressed his thumb into the blond’s mouth to stop him hurting himself, then kissed him again as he moved his hips, causing the most incredible friction between the hard cocks. Draco’s hands found Harry’s thick hair, fingers tightening almost painfully when he came again with a stifled scream.
What do we think? 😁 This isn't over yet, not entirely sure how many more will come but at least one I think. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has left kudos and comments, subscribed etc.! I was nervous about posting this story at all, it's a lot of angst and violence but I'm so pleased people are enjoyed it and complimenting my writing, it means the world! 💕
“Potter! Malfoy!” a voice behind them snapped, making them both jump and turn to look at the door. Snape stood there, looking angrily from the broken glass and spilled truffles, which, even in the wizarding world, were expensive, and the two boys. “Detention, both of you. Come back here on Saturday and take an inventory of all ingredients. And clean that up.” He snarled, sweeping away again. Harry let out the breath he didn’t realise he’d been holding, and looked back at Draco. He heart hurt, but his Monster wriggled happily.
"No problem." He glanced around, then tacked on something he knew would set the school's gossips to work. "Harry."
“How long do you think Snape will make you do this inventory stuff for?” Ron asked Harry, having read the note over Harry’s shoulder. Harry sighed, shrugging.
Instead of just hearing Draco's voice, a scene materialised in front of them, emerging from the ink. It was similar to being in the Pensieve, the three of them there but not there, but also like when Harry accidentally rebounded Snape's attempts to teach him Occlumency. A strange, uncanny quality made it feel more like an illusion, something being fuelled, everything overly smooth and lacking in natural texture or tone, like the Muggle airbrushing of photographs.
He was in such a state of hysteria, however, that Snape had forced a sleep tonic down his throat and his vision of the very office his Monster had committed it’s final assault on Draco Malfoy rippled into darkness.

"Deluded maniac."
The pub was warm and fairly crowded with students, teachers and villagers alike. Harry felt himself skulk between tables and people, his Seeker eyes searching for the white blond hair of the Monster’s target, his Golden Snitch.
"They never really went away…" he said after a few minutes of counting breaths and soothing his aching lungs. Blaise looked at him sadly, but it was so nice to know he was listening. His mother didn't, it was too hard for her. "They've, um, got worse." He said, feeling stupid because obviously they had. And they were awful before. Blaise just nodded, and extended a hand towards him. Draco stared it for a moment, at the open palm he remembered being so warm, how nice it felt on his lower back or shoulder, and took it. It was the first pleasant human touch he could remember feeling in a long time, before the war even, and he smiled gratefully at Blaise when he squeezed gently.
Potter? What can he do?"
Harry watched memory-Draco grip the book he was trying, and failing, to read. A thought entered his head, in Draco's voice: 'they must have had a bad night…', and he felt their shared heart sink. The 'they', he somehow knew, meant the Snatchers. And Greyback.
Draco faltered. He forced himself to sit up, drawing his long legs up and pulling Harry’s robes to cover himself. He moved a shaking hand to messily smear the small trickle making its way down his chest, coming from what could have been a bite mark, or a blade’s. He looked at the red on his hand, frowning at it. “Did you want that?” Harry asked him. Draco looked at him, then sighed, wiping the blood on Harry’s robe. He looked down, his expression sad. He seemed to think for a moment, then spoke.
“Why didn’t you wait inside…?” Blaise asked Crabbe accusingly, putting his arm around Draco, who looked like he might faint, and sat him down on the sofa right by the fire. It took every ounce of willpower Draco had not to wince as he sank into the soft cushions. Pansy handed over one of the numerous blankets they had in the Common Room, since the dungeons got so cold, and Blaise replaced Crabbe’s cloak with it so he was, at least, dry. “Give me your hands…” he said, and Draco obeyed. Blaise pulled off his gloves and placed his wand just above both his palms. “Calidumus.” He said, and Draco’s frozen hands and down his bruised, hidden arms surged with comforting heat, making him smile weakly in thanks. Even so, he continued to tremble, his strength completely gone from the walk back, which worried his friends.
“I just wanted to get you alone.” Crabbe said. Draco looked up at him, a flash of fear in his eyes but he seemed to suppress it, quirking a slender eyebrow.
“What? What’s wrong?” he asked, scared Draco had gotten worse while he was gone.
“Was it fucking Potter?!” she demanded, her raised voice making Draco flinch. Blaise noticed and pulled Pansy away from him, calmly sitting on the edge of the bed.
Finally, Ron stood up, rather menacing as his height dwarfed Draco's sitting position. Then he gave a nod, speaking to Harry.
The gift from Narcissa was a beautifully illuminated tome of potions, dating back centuries, which was completely perfect, and a set of crystal and copper measuring apparatus. Obviously his mother knew potions was his passion, and he seemed pleased by the items, but the sadness and slight anger he felt was clear as day.
“P-Potter…!” Draco gasped, almost managing to sound firm through his panting and shaking and jerking hips. Harry nodded and pulled Draco’s trousers and underwear down to reveal he was rock hard, unsurprised to find the green silk briefs sticky and wet.
He was moving on, healing slowly but surely, and no longer relied on potions to sleep. He was, honestly, ok.
“Um…I- he…i-it used some spell I don’t know…Surenshia or something…?”
“Christ, Malfoy looks awful.” Ron tried to whisper, making several heads turn towards the Slytherin table.
good at organising." He added, teasingly, making his boyfriend grin and roll his eyes, kissing him back.
"We'll go tomorrow." He said, before leaving the room. Luna excused herself as well, rather overwhelmed by the proceedings, but not without taking Draco's hand and squeezing it gently. Such a small gesture, but it warmed him.
All that was clear, vividly, horribly clear, was the mouth. Overly large for the otherwise featureless face, a wide grinning maw full of sharp, brown teeth and an enormous tongue that hung like a panting dog's. Terror flooded Harry's body, both Draco's and his own, and could only watch in paralysed suspension as the infamously savage werewolf strode into Draco's bedroom.
Draco pushed himself up on his elbows and took his wand in a shaking hand, gripping it weakly before pressing it to his own entrance, which made him twitch and shiver.
This chapter is more graphic in terms of sexual violence and overall horribleness, but it's not particularly explicit. Read at your own discretion - Archive warnings very much apply.
"Yes, we're very careful." He assured her. She nodded and straightened up to her full height.
"I was bitten, yes, by Greyback." He said shakily, pulling the jumper up to cover the raised moons of tissue, one waning and one waxing. "He wasn't transformed, and… I had been developing a potion that would - if  ingested soon enough before being bitten - render the Bite noninfectious." Hermione thought for a moment, then frowned.
“Worried…?” he asked slowly, like the concept itself completely baffled him.
“We don’t know what happened. All we know is that Dumbledore and McGonagall brought Harry up here last night, he took a bag of stuff, and they left. That was the last time we saw him, and he didn’t say a word to us.” He said, barely looking at his sister.
“Close your eyes.” He hissed at Harry, who obeyed mostly. He caught a glimpse of a pale, bony shoulder and the profile of a hard little nipple as Draco swapped Harry’s robe for this one. The robe, and his socks, were then placed into Harry’s hands, and Draco told him to leave before ducking out from under the cloak.
He felt trapped, knowing how this would end, how it always ended even if he wasn’t feeling the need for their company. It had happened a few times, despite his defensive and somewhat destructive magic. Whenever he hurt one, they hurt him back. They’d just decided they wanted to use him, practically carried him to the seventh floor and kept him there for hours. The most it ever did was reset the time he had before another attack hit him, but the experience was 1000 times worse when his body wasn’t begging for it. Then it was just
“Finite Incantatem.” The Monster hissed, aiming Harry’s wand at Crabbe, whose eyes cleared of the slight mist the Imperius Curse had caused, and he looked around, confused. He looked at Draco and frowned, about to ask what was wrong, or perhaps where they were, when the Monster said “Immobulus.” And the large boy went completely still, his eyes wide and staring, the pinkness in his cheeks and nose from the cold draining completely. Draco stared back at him, panting with fear, tears in his eyes.
“Can Granger keep a secret?” he asked after a moment. Harry nodded enthusiastically.
“Ok.” He said, and Malfoy glanced at him. Harry noticed again that he was trembling, despite the warm cloak over him and the fire-heated room. “Are you…feeling ok? You’re shaking…” Draco sighed, ignoring the question.
Thank you so much for reading and sticking with this story all the way to the end. I hope you've enjoyed it, and thank you for your amazing feedback and support! Please leave a comment, and kudos if you haven't already, stay safe and remember - there is always a dawn. 💕
specifically, but there are spells that can affect someone’s body… It’s dark magic, Harry, not to mention totally evil to do to someone.” She added, almost warningly. He looked at her, seeing a worry behind her embarrassment. “Why do you want to know about it?” she asked.
“Jesus Christ, Draco…” he gasped. Draco looked distraught, like his world was crashing down around him, and Blaise couldn’t take it anymore. He moved forward and pulled Draco into a tight hug, rubbing his back. He was very tense for a moment, and Blaise thought he might try to struggle, but he soon began to relax, and then he was crying.
“Ok, so, you know last week when I didn’t come back to the dorm. I said I’d gone to the Shrieking Shack to clear my head?” he asked and she nodded that she did recall. “I lied. I was in the Room of Requirement with… with Malfoy.” He said. She looked surprised, but listened intently as he told her everything Draco had told him about Voldemort and what he has to do to keep himself healthy.
Harry sighed, wanting to share it with someone, and he knew he could trust her with this secret, even though it wasn’t his. He leaned forward over the table, and she did the same so they were close enough to talk quietly. He cast a Muffliato spell around them for good measure, he knew Draco would be rather die than let anyone find out about his condition. Hermione stared at him, somewhere between alarmed and intrigued
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sat up as they kissed, one hand on Harry’s chest while the other reached behind himself to grip Harry’s already rehardening cock. Harry’s mouth followed the blond’s, leaning up on his elbows to keep the connection, moving one of his hands from Draco’s hole to grip his insatiably hard cock. It must be painful, he thought, judging from how Draco flinched at the contact even as he bucked into the touch.
“We are keeping Mr Potter separate from the rest of the students while we…investigate these claims from Mr Zabini.”
“It’ll be ok, Draco…” he said, rubbing his arm gently, holding him close.
“You’re eating!” Pansy said with a grin as they sat down beside the bed. He nodded.
“See you at 6 o’clock.” Was all the Potions Master said before locking them in again. Draco went straight into the store room, picking up his list from Snape’s desk as he went. Harry did the same, and they settled back into their monotonous task
The Monster laughed when it realised Draco was starting to harden under Harry’s hand, gripping him tighter until he groaned in pain, begging his assailant to stop, to leave him alone.
“Harry…please…” he whispered, his voice hoarse from the spell and intrusion, his pale face tear-stained and pink with emotion.
"She… wants you to stay good at Potions…?" He tried, feeling like he'd missed something quite big. Draco groaned in frustration.
"Will you be able to get all the way upstairs like this?" Harry asked Draco as they remained huddled together. He took a deep, shaking breath and nodded, pointing towards a tapestry.
“Now then, Harry... I’m sure you will be relieved to know that Mr Malfoy will make a full recovery, given some time.” Dumbledore said. Harry let out the breath he hadn’t realised he'd been holding, one that was threatening to burst his lungs, and nodded.
"I think we should take Malfoy to the Order." He said finally, face thin with determination. Harry frowned, confused, and Hermione started nibbling her fingernails.
“Is in here as nice as the Slytherin dorms?” he asked. Draco looked a bit surprised by the question but sighed.
“Potter-” Harry punched him in the stomach, cutting him off before he could insult him yet again. He grabbed Draco’s wand from the folds of his robes, shoving it into his own pocket so he couldn’t attack back.
"It's alright, Malfoy. Just tell me what you need me to do." He said softly, mouth close to the blond boy's ear. He leaned away when he felt Draco tense, worried he'd startled him, made him feel unsafe like those boys had. But, when he looked at Draco, he saw a distinct blush on his high, pale cheekbones. "Sorry." Harry said with a smile, grey eyes meeting his cheerful green ones, and a smile slowly spread over Draco's lips too. "Do you have a plan?" He asked. Draco let out a breath through his nose and nodded.
"Yeah, you've read it?" Draco frowned at him.
“Potter?” Harry startled at the voice and looked back at the table he was pretending he hadn't noticed. Draco and Blaise were looking at him, almost smiling. Harry forced a surprised smile back, waving to them, and came a little closer.  He saw the way Blaise tightened his arm around Draco, and how Draco rubbed his hand soothingly where it rested on the table, wandless but ready to protect or attack.
The one who had spoken, Anthony, was in front and, when they reached him, he grabbed Draco’s shoulder almost forcefully. Draco wanted very much to slap his hand away. “We haven’t seen you recently, you must need our help by now, right?” he asked, grinning, the others leering at him too. Draco swallowed his gear and tried to speak in his usual, slightly bored tone.
“Wow…you must be grateful for such good friends…” Harry muttered, trying to sound happy. Draco smirked.
“He’s so c-cold…” she whispered, tucking his hand under the blanket. Blaise stood at Draco’s feet, staring at him. He thought about what Draco had said, that Harry had hurt him like this before…twice. How had they not noticed Draco was in so much pain? The first time must have been so…unbearable. He wondered when it had happened. In a bathroom, Draco had said… It must have been the day Draco came back to the Common Room quite late, having missed dinner. He’d said he’d been studying late in the library but the knees of his trousers had been wet and he went straight to bed, looking completely exhausted. But that had been, what? Over a month ago…had he really been dealing with this for that long? Blaise wanted to scream and cry and never let Draco out of his sight again. He moved closer to Draco as he lay, motionless and broken, on the bed, leaned down, kissing his forehead gently. He moved away slightly, looking down at the soft, porcelain-like skin and fine features.
do but...nothing else can change.” He said softly, his fingers barely ghosting over the smooth inked drawings on the crisp, though aged, parchment. Harry sighed and leaned over, taking Draco's hand and squeezing it. The blond looked at him, and Harry smiled.
"The Order can protect you, Draco, as long as you help us." Hermione said, firmly. A balance was necessary, she decided. She would continue to be kind to the Malfoy boy, provided he did nothing to antagonise her.
“Only bits… I've been having dreams but I don't remember much. Don't think I'd want to remember…”
"I could say the same about you. The amount of pressure you must be under…-" he seemed to catch himself before saying any more, standing up too. "Well, I'll see you on Monday then, I suppose." He said, brushing past him to get to the just-appearing door. He opened it a crack, peeking out to check the coast was clear.
“I’ll come with you.” Pansy said, standing too. The Monster hissed in impatience at her.
Harry avoided people the next day, not going down for any meals. On Monday he put his head down and barely spoke during lessons, much to Ron’s disdain.
“Right, Malfoy.” Harry growled, advancing on him. Malfoy looked shocked for a split second, then turned his head, searching for Crabbe or Goyle but, remembering he was alone, returned his wide grey eyes to Harry. The Potter grabbed the front of his robes and shoved his back into the stone wall, hard, making him gasp as the air was knocked from his lungs. He looked at Harry in confusion, seeing the rage in his green eyes.
“He could charge money and I'd pay, literally.” It wasn’t until they were letting the door close, his mind fogged by sleep, that Harry realised Draco wasn’t with them anymore. He could hear them making dirty, sexual comments as they walked away down the corridor, nudging each other and laughing. Suddenly Harry felt a pang of worry for Malfoy, realising what they’d been doing wasn’t to further Voldemort's cause...it was to have sex! Four older boys...what if they forced Draco? What if they hurt him or worse?! Harry leapt the doors, but too late, his fingers scrabbled at the increasingly smooth stone until the doors appeared to never have existed. Harry swore, and restarted his pacing, his thoughts racing with one sentence, over and over.
“There you are! We thought you’d be back before us, what took you so lo-”
Harry had never seen Malfoy so…vulnerable. He didn’t have any witty, snake-tongued comments, no insults to hurl at him… It was like he’d lost all of his fight…and Harry didn’t like that. “Do you need anything? I can run and get Madam Pomfrey if you’re hurt-” Draco glared up at him, eyes flashing like steel.
“Look at me, Draco.” She said firmly, and he tried to. “It will be fine, your father won’t find out unless you want him to.” She said, and he nodded, taking deep breaths. “You’re in so much pain, Draco…let us help you, please.” She begged, her expression desperate. He looked at her, then at Blaise, startled to find the same concerned expression. He sighed and nodded.
"Right? I've always thought Draco would make a good cat. A Siamese, or a Persian maybe. Something posh."
Blaise knew when it was a bad day, seemed to be able to see it in his eyes, even if he was pretending it was a good day. He knew when to take Draco out of a situation, when to talk or touch and when to not. Blaise was his rock, his anchor. He didn't know if he loved Blaise, or if he was simply the only person he could stand the sight of. Either way, he was there and always close and warm and never hurt Draco.
“Crabbe…was there one of the times…the second time, in Hogsmeade. Potter used the Imperious Curse on him…I think when we were in the Three Broomsticks. After we left, he used Crabbe to…to grab me and take my wand and…and then he made Crabbe sit down and…and watch… He took off Imperio and cast Immobulus so Crabbe...saw everything, even if he doesn’t remember it.” He said, looking at his friend. Blaise looked shocked, and angry.
Harry kissed Draco deeply, his hand in the blond’s hair, thrusting as deep as he possibly could, pushing Draco’s hips up off the mattress, his spine bowed. Draco screamed into the kiss, his insides tightening impossibly around Harry’s cock, and Harry felt himself plunging into the deepest, purest pleasure he’d ever felt, like electricity in his blood as he pumped Draco full of his cum, moaning into Draco’s mouth.
“Crabbe…l-let go of me, please… Why are you doing this..?” he implored, still desperately trying to escape. Harry heard his own voice laugh. Draco froze instantly, his hollow cheeks, pale pink from the cold, draining of colour as he searched for the source. Harry moved forward, his hand reaching out to touch Draco’s neck through the cloak, making him flinch, barely suppressing a stifled scream. “W-who’s there...?!” Draco demanded, his voice shaking terribly. He fumbled for his wand, but the Monster made Crabbe grab his wrist, twisting it until he cried out and dropped his only means of attack or defence.  It then made Crabbe pick up Draco’s wand, slip it into his own pocket, and sit down on the hard bench in the shelter.
“Attacked…?” Goyle asked, still staring at the immaculately arranged bedding Draco spent that morning before breakfast perfecting. Whenever he’d asked Draco why he put so much effort into making his bed every morning, Draco would say he just liked the way it looked, clean and tidy. Draco always liked to be clean and tidy…
to keep himself and his parents alive
Blaise felt the sting of that on Draco's behalf, knowing what those memories did to him every day. He looked at Draco to see his eyes wide and pooling tears, the tendons in his jaw tensed and grinding. Blaise was about to place a hand on his arm when he stood up suddenly, walking quickly towards the door out of the Common Room. Blaise swore and followed him, leaving Pansy and Goyle to reassure Crabbe that it wasn't his fault.
This chapter is dedicated to Bridgette_Hayden, who left the nicest comment ever on the last chapter! Thank you for reading - just the epilogue to go!
“Yes...given the option. You can't blame him for-” he immediately regretted his choice in words when Draco sent an icy look his way.
Harry thought, amazed and very aroused. It almost felt primal, like a dog reacting to a bitch in heat, it was so natural and yet so cruelly unnatural. He removed Draco’s shoes, socks, trousers and pants, discarding them onto the floor.
“I wasn’t mistreated. Don’t you understand? I wanted this.” He said, but his eyes betrayed him. Harry looked at him a moment, then sighed.
It was Sunday, so they went to visit Draco, taking his homework along in case he wanted something to do. He was sitting up in bed when they arrived, looking pale but his bruises were pretty much gone and he didn’t seem to be in too much pain. He was eating a piece of toast, which they were very glad to see.
Ron grabbed the footstool and dropped it in front of Draco, sitting down so he was directly facing him, their knees less than a foot apart. Draco stared at him, startled.
The day of their detention came, an owl arriving at breakfast on Saturday to inform Harry to head straight for the dungeons after eating. He looked up from Snape’s spider-like handwriting to search for Draco, whom he quickly found, reading a similar note. His eyes were gliding over the words, his jaw tight, cheekbones and eye sockets shadowed compared to his ivory skin. Goyle appeared to ask what the letter was, making Draco jump before putting his Malfoy mask on again and shrugging, muttering something as he folded the note up and put it in his pocket. When the others’ attentions weren’t on him, however, the mask shifted and Draco looked like he wanted to scream. Harry felt another wave of awful, crippling guilt, which was quickly consumed by his Monster’s delight.
"I know… I'm so sorry, Draco." He said, hesitant to touch him.
"Draco, Ron's just going to-" Harry started but Ron interrupted.
Hermione went with him most days, sitting quietly in the corner to observe and help if needed. Snape had sneered at her pressence at first, when she said she was there for moral support, but thankfully it had made him far less outwardly cruel towards Harry. Whenever Harry freaked out over not being able to block the spell, Hermione was apt at calming him down and getting him back on track. Encouraging and hard-nosed at times, she made the sessions easier for everyone and Snape eventually started greeting her more civilly.
Just under a month after their time together, Harry saw Draco with same group of 7th year Slytherins heading upstairs. It was during dinner, Harry running late after falling asleep in the library finishing a Potions essay, the corridors empty. Draco, though not short by any means, looked tiny in the midst of the huge Neanderthals he was with, his eyes uncharacteristically down as they passed, one of the older boys' arms around his waist. Harry fought the urge to follow, to stop them going into that room and treating Draco so badly again, but he didn’t, couldn’t.
“N-no… no problem…” he replied, before smiling. Draco frowned for a moment, confused, before he let out a soft laugh, and then they were both laughing, then kissing again. Harry removed himself from inside Draco, making them both gasp, and roll them over so he was on his back with Draco on top of him, legs still either side of Harry’s hips. Harry’s hands found Draco’s arse as they kissed, and then his fingers found the heat of his hole, leaking come and still twitching, the muscles soft and extremely inviting. It didn’t seem to matter that they were Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, they were just bodies that wanted each other, chemicals in need of reactions.
“Is that the Protean Charm?” Harry asked, and Draco nodded. He gave the 10p back to Harry, before squeezing the sickle still in his own hand. Instantly, Harry felt the 10p heat up and vibrate softly on his palm. “So if you need me...call me?” He asked, biting on a smile. Draco nodded and placed the sickle in his shirt pocket, not getting the muggle reference, nor noticing Harry's giddiness.
“We just bought a flat actually. Moving in tomorrow.” Blaise said, hugging Draco close. It was a small gesture, but meant a lot:
“But now he's
Harry watched as the head of his own erect cock pressed into Malfoy’s arse, slowly disappearing. It was instantly too tight, Malfoy letting out another, louder moan of pain as his unwilling body was forcefully penetrated. Harry let out a shuddering gasp as he was enveloped in the impossibly tight, impossibly hot passage. The Monster felt his pleasure as well, gripping Draco’s hips in a bruising vice, and slammed Harry completely inside his protesting body.
"Snape knows. She wants me to know she's got bloody Snape involved, so he can manage any information that gets back to
Harry made his move just as Draco was reaching the last staircase of his ascent, the coast clear all the way to Barnabus the Bewildered. Flying past the others, he rushed from the Common Room, grabbing a plate of sandwiches from the buffet, and headed for the Room.
“We’ll see you soon, Draco.” Anthony said, smirking at the Malfoy arrogantly, before he and his friends sidled off, in the opposite direction to the younger Slytherins. Draco's oldest friends were quickly beside him and, seeing he was flustered, Goyle patted his back almost gently.
“Oh...good, I’m so glad...” he said, eyes stinging. He couldn’t imagine what Draco was going through, both physically and mentally. He must be in so much pain. Snape looked like he might spit acid.
Later, Snape told Crabbe to stay behind after Potions. Goyle had frowned at him, Draco had gone pale and looked between Crabbe and Snape. Blaise had touched Draco's shoulder and made him leave with him, Crabbe thought maybe they were together now; they'd been spending a lot of time together since Draco left the Hospital Wing, plus the whole sharing a bed thing...
“He can’t help you, Draco… No one can.” Harry’s voice hissed, making Draco jump and his eyes once again search for his invisible attacker. His hand slowly moved away from Draco’s mouth once the passers-by were gone, tears now falling down his cheeks, his eyes angry.
actually forgotten, using the balustrade to lean on. She cast a quick ink-drying charm on it with a wave of her hand and stowed it all away again, nodding once. They were alone again by then, so she replied softly.
By 2 o'clock, the weather had turned again so they attended Sunday lunch as usual at 3, eating at their respective tables since it was too busy for them to pile onto each other's. Both Harry and Draco were disappointed, sending each other not-so-covert glances across the room and blushing every time. Both sets of friends noticed and teased them fondly.
Harry and his Monster watched together as Draco Malfoy shifted closer on his knees, white hair ruffled and tears rolling from his storming eyes, and slowly reached up to take Harry’s cock in his hand. Harry’s head felt clouded, like he was sleeping walking. He had a vague sense that he couldn’t control his own body, his own thoughts, like he was dreaming. But he felt Draco touch him.
Draco looked around, holding the bedsheets up to his chest shyly. Harry understood and picked up a shirt from the floor, passing it to him. Draco took it hesitantly, thanking him, and pulled it on. He did up all the buttons before standing up, the shirt reaching his mid thighs so he was fully covered, but pulled his underwear on too. He went round the bed to join Harry, half-heartedly looking through the items on his side.
“I really needed that…” he said with a laugh, looking at the bottle before passing it on to Ron, leaning his head back and opening his mouth to drink the rain instead. The Monster was undetectable, hiding in its dark place as it felt joy in Harry for the first time since taking up residence inside him. Hermione grinned and so did Ron.
"Fine." He said, looking up at Harry specifically. "But I need you to promise that the Order will try to help my parents, Potter. Please. My mother cannot be there any longer." He said, the only real colour in his countenance was the pink that rimmed his shining eyes. Harry knew he was powerless to resist this request, so looked at the others for their input.
“Draco,” Crabbe said in the Monster’s words “can you help me pick a present for my mum? It’s her birthday tomorrow and I dunno what to buy.” Draco frowned at him, while Pansy looked livid.
The Dark Lord almost certainly knew this, his spongey little follower, but would he attempt to have Draco rescued, or murdered? The latter was most likely, as his life held no real benefit now other than something to play with when bored. He was, very much, disposable.
Harry liked the feeling. His trousers felt tight again, and his Monster had an idea. He pulled the fingers out Draco’s mouth, wiping his saliva on Draco’s robes, which he then pulled off him in one fluid motion, before turning him around again forcefully. Draco looked at him, hatred and fear in his eyes, his lips moist and pink.
Harry’s pace from then on was deep and slow, letting them feel every inch of each other as he moved inside Draco, who was able to regain some energy from the gear shift and recommenced his exquisite moans of pleasure. It was a very satisfying pace for the both of them. Draco came twice more before Harry, and after a break they were at it again. Three was Harry’s limit, but Draco’s fever seemed to have been quelled for now. The blond boy lay on the bed after casting his clean-up spells, completely exhausted and already mostly asleep, and Harry was more than willing to join him under the covers and pull him in close, falling asleep the happiest he’d been in a long while.
and couldn't think of anything worse than what he'd already been through. Other than Death or the Dementor's Kiss, she couldn't imagine inflicting more pain on him than he'd already suffered. The Draco Malfoy who had done all those awful things at school, and since, had been thoroughly kicked into submission. Now, they needed to act with more control and establish whether or not he was still a threat.
"Hi!" Harry said suddenly, feeling slightly hysterical. "What are you two doing here?"
At breakfast on Sunday, Draco sat down beside Harry, joined by Pansy. Blaise and the others were at the Slytherin table, monitoring the situation carefully. Except Crabbe, who was diligently trying to read
"I'm going to ask him. If he regrets what he's done. If he feels any remorse. If his actions were justified." He said, walking deliberately towards the living room. Luna was on unofficial guard duty, sitting on the sofa Harry had vacated, Draco on the other. He was just waking up, sensing something was happening.
Blaise waited outside for Pansy to join him, and they walked back to the Slytherin dungeon, both sniffing covertly. They both went to bed as soon as they arrived, parting with weary words. Blaise got to their room and collapsed onto his own bed. No-one else was there yet, thankfully, and he was able to cry some more before getting ready for bed.
Harry was finally let out of the strange room he'd been kept in. He had absolutely no idea how long he was in there for, but it felt like days, though he was only given five meals in all. A toilet had appeared when he needed it, disappeared when he was finished, and there was hot water and a change of clothes when he woke up.
He slowly reached out towards the blond boy, brushed his wrist with the soft tips of his fingers, then gently lowered his arm with the tiniest bit of pressure against the crook of his elbow, and the wand was at his side quickly. Draco just stared at him, a single tear balancing on his lower eyelid, caught on his pale eyelashes before it could follow gravity’s will. Blaise moved in the tiniest bit closer and carefully pressed the flat of his finger, between the second and third knuckles, just beneath his eye to catch it, the bead of water finally bursting and running over Blaise's dark skin.
“What do you ask for?” Harry asked Draco, panting.
“Lubrico.” The Monster hissed, pressing the tip of Harry’s wand into Draco’s tiny pale pink hole. Draco gasped as cold liquid spurted inside him, a completely foreign sensation, letting out a tiny whimper as the wand pushed further inside him. The hand around the back of his neck let go, and returned on his arse cheek, spreading it away for a better look at his hole. Then Harry dropped the wand into his pocket, and the Monster plunged two of his fingers inside the virgin hole instead, all the way to the last knuckle, and revelling in the muffled sob Draco let out as he bit down on his own arm. “No need to keep your voice in…” the Monster whispered, toying with Draco’s insides with Harry’s hand.
"I have… something serious to discuss with you, Potter. I apologise if my sending you a signal was misleading, but my friends convinced me it was  an urgent enough matter." He took another bite, exasperating Harry. He chewed and swallowed again, then put the sandwich down and brushed the crumbs from his hands. "As you are aware, my... condition has forced me to seek help from several of the Slytherin 7th year boys." He said, and Harry nodded. "Well, there was an incident today that was… rather concerning, and I'm afraid I may need your help." He spoke with such a business-like tone, it would have been easy to miss the tremble in his expression and hands.
“I accidentally nudged Malfoy and made him drop a jar of truffles, so now we both have to come back at the weekend and take inventory.” He said, lying so they didn’t question why Draco was scared of him. Hermione sighed angrily, shaking her head, Ron rolled his eyes, and the matter was put to rest as just another example of Snape being a twat.
“I told you to shut up!” Harry bellowed, making Draco flinch. Harry pulled out his wand and whipped it in a circle above them. “Muffliato.” He hissed, and all other noise around them stopped – the dripping of the taps, the creaking of the old pipes. It was silent except their own breathing, their own hearts beating fast and loud in their own ears, and no one else could hear them. Draco looked profoundly terrified now, and he tried wriggling again but Harry put the tip of his wand to his throat and he froze. “Don’t even think about it. You know you can’t escape.” He hissed.
Harry woke up very early in the morning, before Draco, feeling surprisingly refreshed and happy. He’d never really woken up beside anyone before, except Ron, and on one occasion when he and Dudley had been forced to share a bed...but never like this.
“Are you tight again, Draco?” the Monster asked with Harry’s voice. Draco tensed, swearing at him angrily. “We made quite a mess last time…I hope we don’t ruin your darling protector’s rug…” Harry felt confusion in his foggy mind. Snape was Draco’s protector? Since when? “I wonder how his Unbreakable Vow will be affected when I rape you on his very own desk…” the laughter was high and cruel. What on earth was an Unbreakable Vow? Harry didn’t even understand the words coming out of his own mouth.
“Um...full disclosure, I told Hermione about your situation when you first told me. I thought maybe she knew anything about it but…” he sighed. “I'm really sorry, Malfoy.” he looked at Draco again and saw he looked slightly angry, but not as much as he'd expected.
“My duty, Potter. Honestly, you really are stupid.” He said. His insults were barely there, but Harry was too angry to care, incensed just by Malfoy’s arrogant smirk and nonchalant stance.
“Sorry...” Blaise said gently, his own wand appearing over the basin and he whispered ‘frigida minimus’ when he saw Draco’s hands were pink under the crystal surface. Draco withdrew his hands after a moment, the water feeling too cold again. He dried them on the dark green towel, and looked at Blaise with sad eyes. Blaise smiled sadly back, carefully taking his hand, skin still hot from the water but rapidly cooling, and was glad when Draco didn’t pull away. They went back to Blaise’s bed and Blaise got back in, holding the quilt open for Draco to join him. Draco looked nervously at the inviting space on the mattress, wanting so badly to be comfortable and warm but afraid of the body already there, even though this body had never hurt him. He'd vacated the same space only moments ago, his skin crawling with unspoken horrors, even a single slightest brushing of skin against the boy beside him in the narrow bed made him want to scream, yet he missed Blaise's presence and warmth immediately.
“Now?” he asked, obviously displeased.
“I was raped my first time.” He said finally. Harry stared at him, horrified.
Finally, the ornate doors appeared, and Harry rushed them both inside. It was the same as before: the same bed, the same fireplace, sofas, and rug. Harry took Draco over to the bed, and lay him down on the mattress, where he curled into a quivering ball. He looked so uncomfortable, feverish and desperate, Harry’s heart ached… but so did another part of him. Seeing Draco so undone, hot and (dubiously) willing, turned him on more than anything ever had before.
It had been two weeks since Potter returned to normal school society, much to the Slytherins’, those in the know at least, outrage when Blaise woke up to darkness, his head aching from not enough sleep. He sighed and picked up his watch from the bedside table. He strained his eyes to see the slightly flowing face, finding the time to be 2.30 am. He groaned softly and sat up, putting his watch back and picking up his glass of water for a sip. As he drank, he glanced over at Draco's bed, his concern for his friend always heightened at night due to his constant nightmares. To his surprise, however, the bed opposite his own was empty. Blaise put his glass down and got out of his warm bed, padding over the Draco's bed in socked feet. Their dormitory was carpetted but the cold stone beneath always won out.
“He’s never been much of an eater, but recently he’s been much worse.” he said. “We’ve done our best trying to get him to eat but he just cringes at it most of the time… We were trying to get him to talk to you about it…before this…” he muttered, letting out a sharp sigh.
Hermione was smiling at him and glanced pointedly at the book in Harry's hands. Draco took the hint, grateful. "This is a horror book, it's really rather good. The author's name is a pseudonym, a House Elf wrote it." He glanced at Hermione again, her face lighting up in fascination, and gave a smile that felt easy. "I'm sure Granger would enjoy it as well. Quite political, actually, if you look at the subtext." He added, having only just realised this. He knew about her stupid SPEW organisation and... supposed it made sense. Still, they were excellent servants.
, Harry could feel every eye him. Ron, in particular, was openly gaping at him.
“You can always talk to me, Draco. I obviously don't want you to kill Potter, and I know you won't... There are much better ways of coping, trust me.” He said sincerely. Draco smiled at him, nodding.
“P-Potter?! What- Where- Why are you-…!” he trailed off, completely baffled. Harry sat up, clearly showing himself to be fully dressed, and put on his glasses.
“Of course he meant it!” Draco snapped, almost hysterically. He was holding his wand tightly in one hand. Since everything that happened, he'd been particularily obsessed with having his wand to hand at all times, and refused to let anyone touch it. “Wouldn't you want to have those memories taken away? I see them every time I closed my eyes!” he sobbed, shaking with emotion. His body had healed from the torturous events, while his mind felt like an open wound, infected and draining him of life. Blaise took a breath and nodded.
"We have Bellatrix's wand, and Griphook, we can go to her vault-"
"Blaise! I'm sorry, I didn't-" his breathing ragged and voice hoarse.
He sighed once he’d swallowed, drinking the rest slightly more desperately. He put the glass back, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, and Harry could see him watching him out of the corner of his eye. Harry then realised he was standing over Draco somewhat ominously, and he moved away to sit on the end of the bed. He looked around the room, thinking it felt similar to the Gryffindor dorms.
"What will happen now…?" He asked. "My… my parents are in danger, I don't know how to h-help them…" he said, a large part of his anxiety wholly dedicated to them. His blond hair was flopping out over his forehead, free to explore the world, feel the air, so unlike his usual combed-back and restrained style.
“You can’t believe Blaise! Him and Malfoy are doing this to f-”
"From your mother?" He asked softly. Draco nodded, hands trembling slightly as he traced Narcissa's immaculate cursive, and his eyes rose to find another pair of eyes watching him.
“Look at the proud Draco Malfoy, Crabbe…don’t you wish you could fuck him until he cries like this?” Harry’s voice asked, laughing in Crabbe’s paralysed face and his floppy cock hanging from his trousers. “Think about all the times he’s ordered you around…look at him now…” Draco was very quiet for this, leading the Monster to believe he was trying to be strong, especially in front of Crabbe. So, still holding Draco by the hair, it pulled his head all the way back to rest on Harry’s invisible shoulder, and forced him to raise one leg, bending it at the knee to reveal Harry’s disembodied cock ramming into his body with staggering force. Blood was trickling down the inside of his planted thigh, his shackled hands trying to cover himself as Harry fucked him mercilessly, pulling his green jumper down over his exposed genitals. The Monster wanted to give Crabbe more of a show, so it pulled all the way out to reveal the full bloodied length of Harry’s certainly-not-small erection, rubbed it against Draco’s thigh for a moment before ramming back in, all the way to the hilt.
“Fuck?” Draco supplied viciously with a scoff. “I'm not like you, Potter, I don't need people around me all the time, I enjoy my own company…” he muttered.
Two piles of wrapped presents sat there, one for Harry and one for Draco on their respective sides. After realising it was, in fact, Christmas morning, Harry felt a hot flush over his entire body. The house-elves… the house-elves had seen them in here together. They knew. Harry went over to the Christmas presents slowly, as if scared they’d attack him, and picked up a small note from his own pile.
“Shut up, Potter...” Draco muttered with a very him eye roll, then sighed. “If...I require your assistance again...I might ask you to help me again. Do you have any coins on you?” he asked. Harry frowned slightly, not expecting this turn of events, and grabbed his trousers from where they’d been laid over the sofa. He pulled out a handful of coins, both muggle and wizarding, and showed them to Draco. The blond then selected one 10p and one sickle, waving away the rest. He then cast a spell over the both of them, Harry recognising it as the same spell Hermione had cast for the DA coins.
He wondered how on earth he could manage such a journey in the condition he'd found him in on Christmas Eve, and wondered if he and his old group of brutes always moved themselves all the way up the entire castle to get to their designated place, or if they did it elsewhere instead. Harry pushed down the thought of Draco being locked in the 7th years' dorm room, a green and silver coloured dark, cold version of the very room Harry himself sat in, waiting for the right time to leave.
!” He snarled the last word through clenched teeth, spitting his anger out like it was venom. “I hate what happened so much I want to die, I think about it every second of the day, it's KILLING ME!” He shouted, Hermione tried not to jump. He felt like a child in her arms, young and helpless as he trembled with too many emotions for one person to comprehend. He was a child, they all were. She had had enough of seeing her friend in pain. She grabbed hold of his face with both hands and stood to look into his eyes. There were tears in both pairs, doe brown and despairing green.
They all stared at him, struck by his words. Then Harry let go of Ron, feeling the fight go out of him.
“Well… that’s a tad embarrassing…” Harry muttered to himself, rubbing his hand over his face, wanting to laugh and burn the note like it never happened.
They had been delighted to see Harry, and had soothed him and made gentle jokes as he sobbed, wishing to jump through the frame and hug them both. It was a shame no-one had ever painted a portrait of his parents. They had more modern photos, Lily being muggle-born, but they didn't contain their essence the way portraits did. Harry supposed it was for the best. The men he'd come to think of as beloved uncles,
No-one had told him much about what happened to Draco, what Potter did to him, but he was smart enough to work out most of it. The problem was that he couldn't remember if the dreams had started before or after Draco went to the Hospital Wing and Blaise tried to kill Potter in the Entrance Hall. He knew they were the same thing, dream and real, but he didn't know why he was seeing those things. It felt like he'd seen them before, like dreams but when he wasn't asleep - he just knew he shouldn't be seeing that stuff. His mind was full of it, those things, and made it hard to talk to or even look at Draco without the cold, cloudy thoughts coming back.
Blaise walked into the 6th year boys’ dormitory, and found Draco curled up on his bed, fully clothed, apparently asleep. He knew his friend hadn’t been sleeping much at all recently so this would have been good to see, were it not for the dark bruising across the pale face. Blaise was instantly angry and stormed into the room, shaking Draco’s shoulder. The grey eyes snapped open, panic filling his very pale face as he jumped away from his friend. Blaise backed off quickly, his hands up to show him he wasn’t going to hurt him, deeply concerned by the reaction. Usually, Draco would just moan at him, or tell him to fuck off, but now he looked terrified. He had been quite jumpy recently, more so than usual, but this was much worse.
The Christmas holidays arrived with snow. Hermione was going to Lapland for a skiing holiday, and Ron's entire family were going to visit Charlie in Romania, so Harry had decided to stay at school and have some time alone, which he was rather looking forward to.
"Oh, there's-" he started, getting up too quickly, making the other men jump and move defensively. Blaise went for his jacket's inner pocket, his other arm in front of Draco, who had flinched backwards. Harry remembered then his right to carry a wand had been suspended for five years following the trial, as a condition of his parole. "Sorry! Sorry… I-I just saw Ginny..." Harry said, feeling his own face heating up. He stepped out from the booth and away. Blaise glared at him but stopped reaching for his wand, his eyes moving Draco. The blond man shook his head, taking a breath.
“Make yourself useful then…get my wand…” he said, his voice wavering slightly. Harry nodded and obeyed, going around the bed to retrieve it. He found it quickly, though had to get on his knees to reach under the bed for it. He went back round to give it to Draco, who was slowly and shakily trying to push himself off the bed. Without thinking it through, Harry took hold of Draco’s skinny bicep in an attempt to assist him.
Harry leaned over Draco, who had a hand over his mouth to muffle his own moans, and kissed him again, gently moving his wrist away. He made a decision and slowly pressed one of his own fingers inside Draco. The Malfoy moaned into the kiss, his whole body jerking, his insides twitching and tightening. It was very hot inside him, and very tight despite the generous amount of lube. Draco withdrew his own finger, the sensation becoming too much for him to handle, and Harry replaced it with another of his own, then a third, sinking them as deep as they would go, twisting and stretching. Draco came again as Harry fingered him, his insides clenching around Harry’s digits incredibly, and made him instantly want to be inside him.
“What’s the alternative? They serve a purpose, they’re willing and I’d rather a few hours with them once or twice a month than going completely insane, thank you very much.”
"Draco!" Blaise cried, panicked by the intensity of his fighting, the volume of his begging and crying. His voice was strained and hoarse, just as it had been when he first greeted Blaise at the front door with a weak smile and nervous tug of his collar. "Draco, wake up!" He persisted, resisting the urge to hold him down to stop him hurting the both of them. He stepped away and lit the candles with his wand, vaguely concerned the house was being watched for illegal magical use. Probably why they didn't have house elves anymore. "Draco, it's me! It's Blaise!" Finally, he woke up, sitting up and away, back pressed against the wall. His eyes were wide as he looked around, then they rested on Blaise standing in the soft orange light, and relaxed, slumping slightly.
“Just…just cold. Let’s go.” He said shortly, fixing his coat and hair quickly. Crabbe nodded and they left together, Harry following closely. The wind had picked up in lieu of the heavy snow, almost pushing Draco clean over. Crabbe grabbed his arm when he started to wane, frowning at him.
"Draco, owl." Pansy said, nodding towards the flurry of post. Xerxes, his beloved eagle owl, was swooping down towards them. Draco caught the letter he dropped effortlessly, and threw a rasher of bacon up for him in almost one movement, the owl catching it in his beak with an appreciative screech before turning about and flying off again. Blaise, who was sitting opposite Draco, regarded the correspondence with interest.
"No… they didn't hurt me. They asked if needed their assistance and I said no, lied about it getting better. And, well, Anthony - I'm sure you know him, former Chaser on the Quidditch team - was rather persistent and- luckily Pansy, and Crabbe and Goyle were there to-" he cut himself off, taking a shaky breath before continuing. "A-anyway, I realise you probably don't care, it's really my own problem, I-I got myself into this… But, nevertheless, I can admit that it
Anticipating
"Why are the muffled?" Harry asked, frowning. Ron looked at him like he was the dumbest person alive.
"Yeah… yeah. After everything ended, I finally received a letter from Snape's last will and testament. He left everything to me, which wasn't a huge amount but… he left me all of his research. His Potions work was
The first night Blaise stayed over, he slept on a second bed in the spare room Draco was using. He didn't say why he no longer slept in the bedroom that had been his since he was born, but Blaise could guess. Sometime that night, Blaise had woken to the very soft, sadly familiar sound of someone crying. It had been a few years, but his body reacted automatically. He got out of bed, the room feeling very cold, and went over to where Draco lay and suddenly it was like no time had passed and they were in the Slytherin dormitory again, gently waking Draco up from a nightmare with a careful shake of the shoulder. But it was worse now. The Malfoy gasped awake, fighting against his friend's hands and screaming.
Draco glanced up at the Gryffindor table and, almost immediately, Harry looked back at him. They swapped minuscule nods, agreeing today was the day, and returned to their respective meals. They had a free period that morning, so most of their year group headed for the library after breakfast, their workload beginning to ramp up.
“Some spells will last as long as the wand that cast it remains intact, even if its owner is dead. I've read about a few very rare spells that last forever, and there’s certainly ones where their
He stretched out on his bed, the one he’d slept in since first year, and, for the first time in a long time, relaxed.
Hermione nodded her assent. Luna watched Draco with both suspicion and sympathy. Perhaps she, of all people, could understand Draco's relationship with his parents, their roles within that house of horrors.
“The seventh-years usually…sometimes people from other houses… Blaise on occasion…” he said the last part quieter, knowing Harry would be…upset about it, though he wasn’t sure why, or why he should care. He glanced at the Potter boy again, finding his expression stony. “Only if I’m really desperate. He’s not gay, he says it’s more instinctive anyway. Goyle’s helped me once or twice as well, but he’s too big…” he said with a shrug.
defeat Voldemort, and he wasn't even 18, hadn't even sat his N.E.W.T.s., and yet he was expected to kill the most powerful dark wizard of all time.
“I guess so, Dumbledore took Potter to Snape…maybe they’re gonna see if it’s true…” Goyle nodded slowly.
“Show yourself, you fucking coward.” He snarled, his voice filled with venom.
"I… h-hate this…" Draco whispered, teeth chattering and eyes squeezed shut. Harry felt a pang of sympathy. He thought he knew what it was like to have no control after so many years under the Durselys' collective boot, but this was far more than that. This was the autonomy of his own
(See the end of the chapter for
“Silencio.” Harry said with the flick of his wand. Draco kept saying the words, his lips moving but no sound coming out. He looked horrified, then tried again, his lips forming words, but he still couldn’t make a sound. Then Harry’s Monster grabbed the front of his robes and pulled him close, Harry’s own mouth whispering “Get on your knees.” In a harsh tone that made Draco seem to shrink and he obeyed, looking exceptionally beaten. The grey eyes stayed on the floor, his head down and to the side as if he were attempting to ignore his captor.
Draco was walking down the corridor, on his way to the library, thinking about how tragically excited he was to just sit down and do some homework. After the strangeties of the Christmas break, it would be nice to just get back to (his) normal as best he could. He rounded the last corner, trying to decide between Potions or Charms as his first essay of the day, when an obnoxious bark of a voice made him jump.
They got Draco to the library and Blaise helped him get his homework out and found something he could focus on. Despite Potions being a place of bad memories now, the processes were a great comfort for Draco. Analysing and explaining a complicated potion recipe and the context behind it's creation and use was perfect after such an encounter. They stayed in the library for most of the day, sitting in comfy seats and by a crackling fire. Pansy and Blaise got on with their own work, though they both kept an eye on their friend. He seemed better, even speaking up on occasion to join in on whatever they were chatting about, or to tell them something interesting about the potion he was studying. It wasn't good yet, but it was better.
was written in surprisingly neat pencil.
“But-”
he thought, trying to work out his current feelings. He was worried, anxious, but also aroused and eager like before. Whatever magic was affecting Draco, Harry was sure it was affecting him too, maybe it affected Blaise as well.
“I can assure you, Mr Weasley, that Mr Malfoy is in no condition to be doing anything close to what you are implying.” She said, almost angrily, and he went quiet, looking at Hermione, whose eyes were wide.
Harry was just walking back from Christmas Eve dinner, intending to grab a book to read before bed, when he noticed someone leaning against the wall a little way along the library corridor, sort of hunched over like they were in pain. Being who he was, Harry went over to them, hoping nothing was seriously wrong. As he got closer, he saw it was a boy, and he was shaking terribly, his pale hand tense on the cold stone. Harry glanced around, seeing they were alone in the hallway, the castle being practically empty at the moment.
"Alright." Draco said, voice only cracking a bit. He cleared his throat, still focused on Ron.
Ginny stood by the window seven floors up, her arms crossed. She'd watched her brother, friend and…whatever Harry was, screaming at the top of their lungs in the rain, and now they were sitting on the floor passing a whiskey bottle around.
"Well… school is a good place to start, homework, stuff like that. Maybe… books we've read. I have some Muggle novels I think you'd like; they're incredibly melodramatic and dark." He said, grinning when he got another Look from the blond boy. "Ever read Wuthering Heights?" he asked. Draco narrowed his eyes and turned away again, that was all the answer Hary needed. "Perfect. That's a good place to start. I'll give it to you on Monday, before Charms." He said and stood up, moving to leave.
"That's such a good comparison!"
“What is the meaning of this?!” Snape demanded, having pulled Harry out of the storeroom. Draco was leaning against the table like he was in a lot of pain, and Potter’s glasses were broken and his face was just as bruised as Malfoy’s.
Draco was crying silently, his pale eyes looking anywhere but at what was in front of him, like if he ignored it, it would go away.
He was surprised to the find the room much smaller than usual, about the size of his dormitory. A fire was crackling merrily in the hearth beneath a carved mantelpiece, adorned with roses and thorns, and there was a thick rug on the stone floor basking in the warm orange glow. Two large sofas lined one corner of the rug, the well-stuffed pillows facing the flames like sunflowers.
“Crabbe didn't mean what he said, Draco, he just doesn't think-”
Harry was shocked. Draco had come twice already in the last 5 minutes, and once downstairs… it was incredible. “Draco… how much do you usually need before you feel better?” Harry asked him, not sure how much the blond’s body could take of this constant orgasming. He’d be completely exhausted in no time if this continued.
The bed itself wasn't in its usual perfectly made self, something Draco did as soon as he got out of it, the sheets rumpled and to one side like he'd gotten out of bed in a hurry.
“What happened, Vince?” Goyle asked, shaking Crabbe’s shoulder. Pansy glanced over to where Draco and Blaise were sitting at one of the study desks, Draco helping Blaise with his Potions essay. They were looking over too, a certain tension in their appearances, anticipating, dreading. Blaise looked like he wanted to get up, go over to Crabbe and
, he thought with a dull sense of satisfaction that felt almost familiar, watching them both wincing and desperate for it to stop,
All four of the teenagers present watched his movements, tracking him like cornered animals. The feeling of being unable to escape invaded each of their minds, feeling wandless even and utterly helpless despite the stolen items in two of their possessions. They must have confiscated Draco's wand, only allowing it back when there was a threat nearby, or Muggles to torture. And there was no way he could outrun someone more wolf than man, they all knew that instinctively.
. If they're gone, it won't hurt anymore…! I'll be able to
He sat, pretending to read the book, incidentally a very dull volume on magical property laws in the 18th century, for a while until a bubble of rage had him lobbing the tome across the room, sending up a cloud of dust where it landed, and he began  pacing the room. The carpet was old and not very soft, the walls had ugly green and gold wallpaper that reminded him of Grimmauld Place, but with none of it’s nostalgic, home-like qualities.
"I don't… I don't know." She said softly. Both boys stared at her. "You're right, Ron, I've been blinded by how bad Draco looks, how different he is now." She said, frowning deeply. "On one hand, he was brought up to believe in the hate Death Eaters and You-Know-Who spout. He's always been on their side, it's
"I think… anyone is capable of terrible things. No-one is better or worse because of their blood, it's…" his hands curled against his own chest, half protecting and half clawing at himself. "it's their souls that are bad." He said, head down. "It's got nothing to do with magic." He finished in barely more than a whisper.
“I-I don’t need your pity… Get out…!” he tried to shout, sound angry, but his voice came out shaky, and weak with pain. His hair fell over his face, but Harry could swear he saw a glistening track slowly making its way down his cheek. His jaw was clenched, shoulder blades stabbing out from beneath his skin as he hunched over, tense.
"We need a good balance, not too obvious but good enough to get the message across. They're stupid, but not
"I know what
"I'll look after him, I promise." Harry told the Slytherins, then dug in Draco's pocket, apologising when it made him twitch and shiver, and produced the Protean-charmed sickle coin.
Most of their stuff was packed away in the fabulously handy magical chest graciously loaned by Blaise's mother, including the furniture. Just the TV (they had fully embraced the Muggle lifestyle since Draco wasn't allowed to use magic) and the sofa bed remained, as well as a tea mug and plate each, a few books and research materials on the lonely chairless desk. They appeared in the almost empty living room, arms wrapped tight around each other.
His past crimes, for now, were shelved for later use. His most recent crimes required reparation, and this was the most mutually beneficial way to do it. They got what they needed from him as an insider, and he was left alive and unharmed. A 'win-win', as the Muggles said. He just needed to agree. If he didn't, they would have a problem.
? He's an absolute prick!"
"I did what I had to do. What would you do to protect your family, Weasley?" He asked, his own tone almost matching Ron's, almost his old self.
Enjoy!
“If…if Snape does Legilimency on Potter…h-he’ll see everything…” he said, his voice shaking. Snape…and probably Dumbledore seeing what Potter did to him… He was just being sucked into a blind panic when he felt warmth around his shoulders. He looked up to see Blaise, his arm around him as he sat on the edge of the mattress. Draco looked at him, eyes wide, and Blaise returned his gaze, steady and calm, calming. He slowly looked down, letting out a shaky breath, relaxing into him. Blaise looked at Pansy, who looked very sad.
Leave some kudos and a comment! ✨
“You may think something else occurred at the time. Something in Hogsmead, perhaps?” Snape said. Crabbe's mouth fell open, the sickle finally dropping.
He looked at Draco to see him doing the same, his hand absently touching the soft fabric of the quilt.
, were good company, even just on canvas, but to have pale imitations of his parents would likely have driven him insane, as the Mirror of Erised had done to so many.
He’d probably rather die than look at me ever again, after what I did…
Draco was sitting folded up on the floor under the shower head, long legs drawn up and arms folded over his knees, still fully clothed besides his boots. Even in a panic spiral, he had the wherewithal to not ruin the suede. His white shirt was soaked through, his skin colour barely perceptible where the fabric clung, his hair stuck to his forehead in a sheet as the water flooded over him, back against the wall.
"I know that, mate, I have eyes." He said, his voice both soft and firm. "Those bastards have completely fucked him up, obviously, but that doesn't absolve him of anything. He's been living their way of thinking since he was born, and he's never once tried to escape or ask for help. He's still one of them, they've just made him their whipping boy. Hermione, you know I'm right." He said, entreatingly. She didn't quite look at him, her brain obviously working away. Harry tried to defend Draco again.
“Will I be able to go in?” Harry asked.
“On the desk, sir.” Harry said. Snape turned to pick them up, looking over them both, then gave a curt nod.
"I'm going to speak to Malfoy." Ron said finally, marching to the back door.
“What else am I to do?” he asked, pulling on his trousers. Harry sighed.
“POTTER!” Blaise shouted, and all the chattering and milling about stopped, like time had ceased passing. Lots of people turned to see who had shouted and a confused, excited chatter recommenced, until Harry replied.
"Draco, it's freezing, get out!" He cried, making Draco jump. Blaise went around the gaping tub to where Draco's pyjamas and towel were strewn on the floor. He picked up the towel and held it out to Draco, staring at him incredulously. "Please, Draco..." He said, softer. Draco let out a breath and stood up slowly, eyes fixed on Blaise like he expected him to attack. Blaise held his gaze, resisting the very human urge to look at his nakedness. He wrapped Draco in the towel, then helped him up the steps of the huge bath. Then he hugged him, feeling his shivers and the chill of his skin even through his own clothes, and was again reminded of what he knew now to be the second time Draco was raped.
The day ended agonisingly slowly. They decided to brave the Great Hall for dinner, having only eaten when they had lying around in the Common Room all day. A hush came over the bustling dining room when the two appeared, most notably sans Potter. Then a cacophony of whispering erupted, angering Ron almost to the point of bolting, but Hermione had gripped his wrist and pulled him to their usual place at the Gryffindor table, her nose in the air imperiously.
Draco looked at him in shock, the blush instantaneous as always on his pale skin, and allowed a small smile of his own, feeling Harry's large, warm hand on his back. He glanced up at the teacher's table to see Snape and McGonagall sitting beside each other, as usual, and speaking hastily, which was unusual. God, this was overwhelming, his face almost unbearably hot.
“Just wondering…” he said, glancing at her. She was looking at him suspiciously and he sighed. Why did she always know when he was lying? “I…I’ve heard of some… sexual curses…?” He saw Hermione blush instantly, but didn’t look up at her for fear of doing the same. “Um, like ones that… make the person feel really unwell and stuff if they don’t…
“Y-yes, please- do something…!” he breathed, his knuckles white as he gripped the fabric of his own robes tightly.
“I'm starving…” he said to Blaise as they took their seats, slightly shocked, and the black boy grinned at him.
This was the first place they lived in together, about six months after Draco was let out on parole, and they'd been here ever since. Draco had stayed in the Manor at first but hated every second, keeping mostly to one small sitting room he shared with his mother to avoid the rest of the vast mansion.
He'd got better at blocking him out, able to resist the Charm two or three times in a session now, but every time he felt his head invaded, the images were a jarring mixture of happiness and utter horror. Snape often had to call a stop himself, his own constitution unable to take seeing these things so very much, but a certain rage-fuelled protectiveness spurred him on. Harry frequently wanted to ask about the Unbreakable Vow, how he and Malfoy were connected by this magic, and how what had happened effected the teacher.
“We had a little breakthrough last night, I suppose.” Blaise said, Draco smiling at him, their eyes meeting for slightly longer than usual.
“Goodness me, bring him in.” she called to them, moving to the bed closest to her office. “What’s happened?” she asked, helping Blaise get Draco settled on the bed, his whimper of pain very clear.
“Is this true, Potter…?” McGonagall asked slowly, her voice tight, almost tremulous. Blaise turned his head to look at Harry when he saw him nodding, and he was surprised to see he was crying, tears rolling down his cheeks.
them!!” Draco cried, looking at him with true despair in his eyes.
They fell silent again, each one mulling over his own thoughts. Then Harry looked up to see Ginny walking into the pub, still dressed in her Quidditch gear, and looking around for him as she strode confidently to the bar.
“Will he be alright?” Pansy asked. The matron smiled wearily and nodded.
is our plan here? Not just with Malfoy, with everything. We don't know where the next Horocrux is, and now we basically have two prisoners, a goblin and a
“What else can I do...?” he asked softly, sad. Harry stared at him for a moment before making a decision.
Harry woke up in an room he didn’t recognise, lying on a slightly uncomfortable single bed, his glasses sitting on a table beside him. He quickly grabbed them, putting them on as he sat up slowly. He felt the familiar groggy confusion that comes from with sleeping draughts, a dizzy ache in his head and a stiffness in his muscles, but he was used to that by now. He’d been dosing himself with various sleep tonics for weeks now.
“Please leave Draco alone, Harry, for both your sakes.” She said in his ear softly. He nodded.
“And your current mental state? How is that doing?” Dumbledore asked, dunking his own biscuit into his tea with a small smile. Harry sighed and shrugged.
and it took him over two weeks to heal last time, even with Madam Pomfrey’s painkillers and healing tonics he took after lying about a Quidditch injury.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dr…Draco…?” Harry gasped, watching the blood and come pooling horrifically on the ground beneath him. Draco’s hands were still against the wall, his head down, his knees having buckled and brought him to an almost prayer-like position.
They finished their dinner and played a game of wizard's chess, Draco winning as always. As they set up the next game, Blaise repairing the destroyed pieces, the blond boy looked troubled for a moment before sighing.
Greyback stood in the doorway, thick muddy water seeping into the once lush green carpet of Draco's childhood bedroom. His face, too, was distorted; like Draco couldn't quite remember what he looked like. Or himself.
Draco’s mouth made contact the head, a bead of precum sticking to his bottom lip when he instinctively moved away from it. Another harsh tug of hair stopped him, bringing him right back and forcing him to take more of the salty flesh into his mouth. Harry moaned along with his Monster, being a virgin himself, he’d never felt the heat of someone else on his cock. It felt good. He didn’t need the Monster to encourage Draco to use his tongue, knowing that would feel better. The grey eyes flicked up to his face, then back down, and he obeyed.
“You mean...Gryffindor tower? Or the Room of Requirement?” he asked.
“To my office, please, Blaise. And you, Harry.” Dumbledore said calmly, walking past them all. Blaise broke his staring contest with Potter, and followed the teachers. He vaguely heard Potter’s friends asking what Blaise had meant, but Harry just said he’d see them later.
He knew it was ridiculous for that to be the thing he was shocked by, after he'd spent Christmas Eve being fucked by Potter within an inch of his life, but this felt by far the strangest turn of events. He'd never considered how Potter must feel, dealing with all this ‘Chosen One’ nonsense; being the only person in the world who
Harry was up before Ron was, grabbing his shoulders before he could lunge at Malfoy and forcing him back into his seat.
, jumping at any unexpected sound and touch, even worse than their last years at Hogwarts.
. Blaise was saying something that made him laugh, looking at him with a softness Harry was surprised any Malfoy was even capable of.
Across the room, green eyes watched. His smile had been uncomfortable for a little while now, since the adrenaline waned after the match. The others were still high on their victory, but Harry didn't feel their joy the same. His head hurt, his eyes were sore from his frequent sleeplessness nights,  as were his muscles. Flying was his way of coping, training hard, long hours in any weather to be everything he could be, everything he would be. He had a talent, and he clung to it like a broom hovering miles and miles above the ground, the only thing keeping him from plummeting.
Harry glanced over at Crabbe, amused by his wide, frozen stare as his friend was assaulted by less than a ghost.
Hermione hadn't wanted to stop Ron attacking Draco, she hadn't felt that impulse, but she was glad when Harry did. She knew she had a vengeful streak inside her, ever since year 3 when Olivia Crisp called her the N-word on the playground, though neither of them really knew what it meant other than it was very mean to call a black person it. Hermione had put a frog in Olivia's book bag and had revelled in her screams. Magical life had been no exception, in fact making it easier and with more creativity; from deforming Marietta's face for betraying the DA, to blackmailing and keeping Rita Skeeter captive as a beetle for printing lies about them all.
?" Harry asked, looking between him and Hermione, who shrugged.
Crabbe had Draco pinned to the wall, his hands completely swamping his chest, the blond boy clearly panicking. It was all too familiar, all too terrifying, and this time it was his friend.
“I…I really liked it with you…” he said. Draco looked at him, silver eyes wide. “I mean…it was my first time, so I have no frame of reference to compare it to,” he laughed nervously, realising that was too many words, and took a breath, “but it was…incredible.” Draco seemed to wince at the admission, though he seemed to have known because he didn’t comment, just nodded slightly, before sighing deeply.
“You know why, Harry. You can fight him, you've done it
Draco seemed to decide not to cry, setting his jaw and his eyes becoming steel once again. He grabbed another jar of truffles and walked past Harry, out into the classroom, head held high. Harry sighed, and repaired the jar, cleaned up the truffles, and selected a jar of doxy eggs, returning to the classroom. Draco was back at his table with Pansy, who seemed to be trying to question him, but Draco wasn’t responding, his jaw still clenched.
"Anytime." He said, grinning, and they both chuckled. "Excited about tomorrow?" He asked, always looking up and forward for hope and good things to come. Draco smiled and nodded, glancing around them, then back at Blaise.
“I dunno, maybe. Or he’s just a sick, perverted sadist… Either way… spending that time with Draco made me realise. He’s been through so much horrible shit, it’s no wonder he’s such a prick really. Imagine living in a house full of Death Eaters, and then being…-” he stopped himself saying any more, it made him want to scream. She was nodding, looking down. “Is there any way to break a curse like that? Without killing the caster?”
"Is it…?" He asked, seeing the adorable flush Draco had been wearing slowly become the teary, frightened expression he had seen at Christmas. He should have realised it was almost a month since then. It was time, again.
“Yes, dear, he will be able to leave in a week or so. You’re his friends, I take it?” she asked them both, and they nodded. “He will need you. You need to be there for him…” she said seriously, looking into both of their eyes. They both nodded, tears forming in Pansy’s eyes again, Blaise’s jaw so clenched his teeth ached. “For now, the best thing we can do for him is let him sleep.” She said, then seemed to think for a moment before speaking again. “He’s very thin…has he been eating?” she asked them. Blaise and Pansy looked at each other, then Blaise shook his head.
“There’s a rumour going round that he’s been put into isolation. No-one’s seen him, and Granger and Weasley only came down for dinner... Dunno what they’ll do with him…” he said with a sigh. Draco looked down at his hands, chewing his lip.
At lunch, the hottest topic was
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” Harry demanded.
Dumbledore cleared his throat before continuing, bring Harry back from the brink. “When you feel a strong emotion, he takes over at least some of your mind. His influence is what made you do these…things to Draco Malfoy.” Dumbledore said calmly, his expression a little sad. McGonagall wasn’t looking at Harry at all, while Snape was almost sneering at him, hatred in his eyes.
Harry opened his present from Mrs (and Mr) Weasley, finding a wonderfully expected knitted jumper. It was a nice earthy red this time, almost orange, with a silvery stag on the front. He grinned and pulled it on over his bare torso, smelling the warm comforting fabric happily. He looked up to see Draco watching him almost longingly, but when he realised Harry was looking at him, he frowned.
They hadn't spoken much since the trial, the occasional owl letter with an update of their respective lives despite the other's hand in it. Harry knew Narcissa had more or less abandoned the Manor and was living close to Tonks’ parents, having rekindled her relationship with her surviving sister. Teddy lived with them too and was already fond of his great aunt, Draco had mentioned his little cousin warmly.
“W-well, um..." she cleared her throat, then took a nervous sip from her water bottle. "I have heard of things like that. Not
This turned out very long and a bit meandering, bare with me! Having a little bit of a sad time so be nice 😘
OK, this chapter got away from me a bit but I hope it's building well! It's been quite fun to work out how the original Gringotts heist could be improved by literally any adult supervision.
He wasn’t sure how he got into the Common Room. He didn’t remember walking there, he didn’t remember giving the password, or climbing into the warm room he loved so much. Now Hermione and Ron were in front of him, covered in white powder, just like everyone else in the room.
. The thing that plagued his life, made it a living hell before Potter stumbled upon his sorry state and offered to help. He realised he'd been feeling it since this morning, even before Harry looked at him with his green eyes and sunny smile. Since he woke up, if he thought about it, but he was too consumed by his growing attraction to Harry fucking Potter to see it for what it was.
“It's not about that, I'm not asking you because you're my only option. I
Harry was just falling into a deep sleep when he heard Draco whisper something that dominated his exhausted dreams.
He wasn’t crying, but he wanted to, Harry could see that, plain as day. “He owns me…” he said softly, looking down. The moment the first tear fell, Harry darted forward and pulled Draco Malfoy into his arms to hug him. Draco didn’t even try to resist, crying into Harry’s shoulder. He was almost completely silent, his tears only apparent when Harry’s shirt became damp under his head. He hugged Draco tightly, rubbing his bony back through his own robes.
Draco nodded, and Harry slowly pushed himself forward. The tip of his erection disappeared inside Draco, the tight heat around it making Harry gasp, almost collapsing on top of him. Draco let out a long, loud moan, punctuated by a scream when Harry impulsively thrust himself all the way inside Draco, his back arching almost inhumanly as he came yet again. Harry stayed still, marvelling at this and not wanting to overstimulate Draco, but the Malfoy’s hand found Harry’s supporting arm and held it as tightly as he could.
"Next time you have a nightmare...get into bed with me. You'll be warm, and we can talk about it...or not, it's up to you. But just know you're...more than welcome." He said with a smile. Draco looked at him, taken aback by the invitation but mostly surprised by how inviting it sounded. Waking up with only his mind to tell him he was safe was awful, always doubting himself in the aftershocks of horrific nightmares that felt so real it made him want to scream even hours later.
“N-Not… until… s-someone comes inside me… a f-f…few times…” Draco ground out, every muscle in his body shuddering. Harry swore under his breath, realising how much of a toll this would have on someone. No wonder he usually came here with three or more people… it must be so draining to do this every month, if not more. It also struck Harry how invasive this curse was too; what if Draco wasn’t gay? What if he didn’t enjoy bottoming, or found it painful or, most likely, traumatic? It didn't matter at all, he’d still be forced to go through it, or else go insane with this insatiable need. Harry held Draco tightly, overcome with emotion and adoration for the boy he used to have such hatred for.
He wished he could do something to help his situation. If only he was a better wizard... He wondered if even Dumbledore would be able to erase Voldemort's curse. Harry let out a sigh of frustration and headed into dinner.
. The cleaning spell had done it's best but it didn't compare to a nice hot shower, few things did.
“She tries to make up for it...like gifts will help… I know it's the only thing she
Pansy looked up from her book and followed Goyle’s distracted eyeline to see Crabbe walking in with a dazed expression on his face. Pansy frowned, watching the large boy lumber over to them and collapse into the armchair opposite.
Blaise made his sneaking way upstairs, avoiding any sounds or slight glow that connoted the presence of a spirit, and finally made it up to his destination, passing Boris the Bewildered's statue, the stone man jumping slightly at his voice when he said the password. The door opened and Blaise went in slowly, suddenly concerned about what he may find beyond.
Draco let out a strangled yelp, summoning enough strength to push Harry away. Harry, not expecting this, flew back into the other wall, tripping over his own robes. He looked up at Draco, who had one hand on his already bruising neck, and one hand reaching for the cubicle’s lock. Harry quickly pointed his wand at the door and said “Colloportus,” Draco’s hand snapping away from it skittishly.
“We'll meet here.” He said, business-like. “And Potter,” he said, Harry looking up at him to meet the steely grey eyes looking at him seriously, into his soul “don't tell anyone. About any of this.” Harry nodded automatically,  then felt a pang of guilt.
"Not even once?" He asked. Draco let out a shaking sob.
“Where are we going, sir?” He asked after a few moments, vaguely registering their direction was aimed downstairs.
After another couple of hours, Harry heard Draco stand up and walk past him into Snape’s office. Harry found his feet following him, his Monster stirring in his chest again, his own thoughts becoming fuzzy. He heard the bathroom door close as Draco went in, and his Monster compelled him to methodically move everything off the surface of Snape’s desk, carefully placing each item on the table behind it, memorising the original layout. He waited patiently for the Draco to return, leaning against the wall beside the bathroom door.
on top of everything?" Ron demanded, Harry shushing him to keep his voice down. Ron had returned from his walk to find everyone very nervous, his two best friends meeting him outside to discuss. Hermione had dug out as many books as she could from the house and her bag, Luna finding some as well, on werewolves, and was in the process of studying them. Draco was still napping, unaware of their discovery, and they wanted to keep it that way for now.
, making a feeble excuse and escaping out the portrait hole. Bushy brown hair soon followed him.
The taller young man raised his hand to Draco’s sharp cheekbone, gently wiping at the wet streaks with the soft pad of his thumb. After several moments of heavenly bliss, their lips parted and Blaise opened his eyes to look at Draco. His brow was more relaxed, no longer knotted together with despair and, though tears were still swimming in his eyes, the sadness seemed less present. Grey eyes met brown as they stared at each other, both panting ever so slightly.
Draco was standing there, staring at the jar on the floor, looking like he was about to cry. He looked up at Harry with wide, shining eyes, the fear he felt when he realised he’d be alone with Harry was so obvious. Harry stared back at him, completely at a loss for what to say or do. He didn’t want Draco to be afraid of him, he hated it, but he didn’t know how to erase what he’d done.
“I…I assume so, I can’t really remember much of what happened… I didn’t hear him say Obliviate but he may have done…” he said softly, looking at Blaise with his big, storm cloud eyes. “Have…have you heard anything about Potter?” he asked, looking down again.
“Get rid of these
He returned to his friends, telling them it was just the signature, and told them the whole story later.
“Don't
Ron and Hermione followed Harry over to the far right of the Great Hall, doing their best to seem nonchalant about this bizarre turn of events. He sat down, confidently, beside Draco, while his friends took the bench opposite. The usual whispering started up again, but they became exclamations when Harry smiled and leaned into Draco to kiss his cheek.
When he saw Draco, he was surprised. Then confused. Then suspicious all over again. He didn't look flushed or sweaty, or at all like the sorry state he'd been in before.
again!” he cried, squeezing his eyes shut.
He didn't look up when the door burst open, though the others did. The smell of earth and blood hit Harry before his brain could put the image into a word.
Meanwhile, Harry was being swallowed by guilt. Of course he'd seen Draco's reaction to seeing him, and the look of terror on his face where there would have been a smirk and a rude comment thrown his way, almost in greeting. He'd been grateful to Blaise for handling it so well, getting Draco away, and even Pansy hadn't blown up at him like she'd obviously wanted to.
Once situated in their usual corner, Draco extracted himself from his friends and wandered over to Potter and his horde. Harry looked up at him brightly, smiling, and, to their credit, Weasley and Granger tried to smile too. Ron was less convincing, looking more like he had a stomach ache than anything else.
“Yes, of course there are. There are lots of different kinds of all magic.” She said. He nodded slowly, trying to think of a way to ask her that wasn’t incredibly obvious.
He eventually pulled out Crabbe’s cock, soft despite the rigidity of his body. Harry wondered if there’s a spell for erectile dysfunction…almost certainly, created by old wizards who couldn’t get it up… Penis Erectus seemed too obvious, but it didn’t need to be fancy. Harry abandoned this musing when his own voice ordered Draco to suck Crabbe’s cock, which, though flaccid, was really rather large. “Be a good boy, Draco, or I’ll have Crabbe rape you as well… He’d probably rip you in half with that thing…and I’ll cut his throat while he’s cumming inside you.” The voice hissed. Draco let out an angry growl and in a flash he had a wand in his hand, either his own or Crabbe’s no-one had time to notice, pointed right at Harry.
“P-Potter..-” Harry slammed him into the wall again, his anger spiking at his voice.

He took a sip of his pumpkin juice, wishing it was wine or something even stronger, and tried to calm himself down. It was irritating how much of an effect Harry had on him these days, where he used to only feel distain for the 'Chosen One' now he felt a coil of molten metal in his stomach, heating every inch of his insides and skin. Today, it seemed even worse, unrelenting and throbbing.
"Sorry, petal, but you do. For this, you do. And you need us. And we need you." She said with a smile. He looked at her with a huff of a laugh, and smiled back.
The final chapter.
a problem now."
bad. He would survive this war and come out the other side absolved, having sought his revenge by protecting Harry Potter.
"Draco." She said, but he only moved enough to see her. "Do you still believe that non-magical people, or wizards with non-magical blood, are inferior to pure-blooded wizards?" She asked, calmly. He stared at her, then glanced at Ron and Harry who were frozen in a half-wrestling stance. Draco slowly lowered his arms, and took a deep breath.
“He used the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange less than six months ago, Ron!” she cried, fighting tears now.
“When I was about 14, it was her husband at the time. She...she got really depressed and didn’t want to do anything, like just being alive was hard enough but...she got through it. I helped her as best I could, it...scared me to see her like that. She started going to a doctor, a muggle one where you just talk - it sounds stupid but she got better, eventually. She still hated him, always will, and so will I. But she got past it, it got a lot better… He’s dead.” He said matter-of-factly. He never went into much detail as to what happened to all his stepfathers, but that was enough to explain it for now. “Obviously don't follow that example.” He said, trying to chuckle but mostly failing. Draco stared at him through the barest of light, his mind blank.
This wasn't just embarrassment, or whatever Potter made him feel by those touches and smiles, this was…
They didn't need to talk about why he craved cold water after an episode, it was just something he needed to do. Blaise was there to make sure he didn't stay cold long and, in many ways, the ritual brought them closer to each other. That's not to say their relationship wasn't strained at times but, as with anything difficult and ongoing, there were good days and bad days.
