“That’s useful,” Joey remarked, and Harry felt strangely happy when he realized that she was impressed. “
“True.” Draco took a long drink as well, his grey eyes looking from the table and wandering about the room in a wary sort of way. He looked a bit uncomfortable, to Harry’s dismay, but it wasn’t surprising. The noise of the area, the scores of observers around - they had ever only gone out to be alone together, and the atmosphere felt almost oppressive.
Draco wondered why the witch didn’t just hand the mask to Ray. Unless, of course, she had a good reason not to touch it…
“Fine. Merlin’s beard, Malfoy.” Harry grabbed his rolled-up Invisibility Cloak, resolving to go to Hogsmeade by himself anyway.
“Muggle fighting is so barbaric,” Draco said with a sniff - Harry was elated to see that his disdain was intact, if not his energy. “Can’t imagine why - mmph!”
“Where d’you want to go?” Ron said, his stroll leisurely as he contemplated the free hour before them.
Harry watched the butterfly glide down a ray of morning sunlight. He thought of the blue in Draco’s eyes, an icy ring that he could only see when he was close. “Er, no. Just…blue.” Out of politeness, he added, “What about you?”
Pansy dangled the pages tauntingly. “Thought you’d be interested in how badly your precious reputation has been dragged through the mud.” Draco didn’t answer but laced his fingers with Harry’s in defiance. Harry felt a swell of pride and squeezed his hand. Pansy’s nose wrinkled, and she opened her mouth to throw another insult.
Harry tried to imagine thirteen-year-old Draco, all bluster and arrogance, gingerly handling a hollow-boned skeleton and having the foresight to magically protect it. The scene was difficult to picture.
“Malfoy,” Lestrange interrupts, clearing his throat, “I thought only the Dark Lord himself can give the Dark Mark-”
Harry chuckled under his breath, and he raised himself slightly to look his lover in the eyes, “When’d you get so lush, Draco?”
from this morning. Thought you might be interested.” He handed it to Draco, his other hand dipping back into his pocket.
Harry moved faster than he thought possible, plunging his hand into his robes. Next to him, he felt Draco mirror his actions, and in less than a second, twin hexes flew through the alley. Pansy deftly ducked, and Henrietta leaped to the side, yelping. One of the spells hit Anaya square in the face, and she fell to the ground, wailing as slimy tentacles began to sprout from her cheeks.
The gouge in the Toyota. Red, pink, and white reminders of a stupid, pointless holiday. There’s plenty to send Harry into a funk, but the remedy isn’t something he’s tried before - ditching work to take a train out to Montauk. He scribbles and doodles in his journal for the first time in years on the steps of an old, peeling-paint beach house.
The sharp noise of a whistle broke two struggling figures apart. “Warning to Laurent,” announced the wizard monitoring the session. “No blows to the head.”
“Can’t let her get you all to herself, now, can I?” Draco asks coyly, pulling the front of Harry’s shirt. “Thought I lost you for a second.”
“Let’s check out the new sweets,” Ginny suggested, and Harry followed her to the wall of glass drawers that held all the different kinds of candy.
Teddy’s eyes went owlish, and a blush of pink scattered the scarlet. “No!” He said emphatically and immediately shut his eyes tight.
Then the violet eyes flashed. The glass within them shattered, and a dark, hateful brown spilled into them.
“That works,” Harry said hurriedly. The possibility of seeing Ron and Hermione there nudged the back of his brain, but he shoved it away.
“Hey!” Harry shouts as she bends to kiss Draco’s cheek. He runs towards, them but the couple is lost in their own little world, in each other’s arms. The distance between Harry and Draco lengthens with every step he takes.
“Yes.” Joey tilted her head down, just slightly, like the way her aunts did when they commanded respect. “Do not doubt us.”
Draco glanced down at his forearm before slipping on a gray button-down. The wicked tattoo did not appear. It hadn’t for nearly a year; he’d learned to tamp down the emotions that accompanied its appearance - irrational anger, misplaced frustration, the feelings that Draco associated with his father.
The rain continued through the night and into the next morning. Draco’s hair was damp with it when he returned to his and Harry’s cabin after changing Joey’s wound dressings.
“Can’t you be a bit nicer to my friends, Malfoy?” Harry said sternly as the blond sped up his pace, so they walked in tandem.
Hands firmly looped a scarlet-colored tie beneath a crisp white collar. Two men linked arms and Apparated to an extravagant, polished dining hall that was reserved for a private event. They joined the small crowd gathering beneath glittering chandeliers and stern, moving portraits, finding chairs standing before enchanted plates.
Draco shut his simmering frustration behind a door of cool indifference. This was supposed to be an in-and-out mission, suitable for juniors, not a wild goose chase across an entire continent for a cure. “Shall we put it to a vote?” He suggested.
“But why? You just got here,” Potter went on, “I know it’s weird adjusting to…all this. Especially after dinner last night. But the Weasleys will-”
The sky grows brighter in the late morning when Harry finds a bus to take him back to Ashfell. Hands in his pockets, he waits at the stop, a breeze in his hair and gravity drawing his gaze to the ground. Then, something green and pink catches his eye – Oh, great, he thinks, him again. But there’s something not entirely unpleasant about this colorful stranger, who recognizes him, and waves. Harry nods back, wearing an artificial smile, unsure how exactly to approach this man who seems his age and yet infinitely younger.
“Overbearing?” Harry’s attention is a bit divided – he hopes Draco didn’t see him blushing when he called him attractive. Something is very wrong about today, but the pink-haired stranger seems to be the only thing right about it.
“People who act like I don’t exist.” Joey frowned. Her hand clenched into a fist, but she forced it to relax.
Draco looked down his nose at her, his expression so purposefully, pompously pureblood that Harry almost laughed. “And why would I want to do that?”
“I’ll never leave your side.” He won’t break the promise. Not this time. Now, Harry adds another condition. “Anyone could take you to the ends of the earth, and I’d bring you back.”
Plenty of people, mostly Bangkok’s locals, gave Joey a double take. She ignored them; she never could get used to those stares, as if they’d never seen a black girl before. Which, she considered, they probably hadn’t. Joey instead looked around for anyone focused on all three of them. But either their tail preferred the cover of darkness, or they knew how to hide malicious intent.
“Sunday afternoon, then,” Harry murmured as they walked past the head of the Slytherin table. A few of the students sitting there gave him their customary glares, but he was too occupied with his thoughts to notice. Valentine’s Day with the seemingly cold-hearted, arrogant Draco Malfoy; things were bound to get interesting.
Draco whimpered in anticipation as Harry’s hands worked at his belt buckle, his teeth and mouth leaving marks on pale skin. Heat built between Draco’s legs as Harry picked apart his buttons, leaving a trail of kisses down his chest. A clink of metal, the buzz of the zipper.
…No. Pansy was trying to get into his head. Harry was worth more than his accomplishments and friends. Being with Draco had taught him that. “Walk away, Parkinson,” Harry said, aiming his wand at her. “You don’t want to make an enemy of me.”
One night, Harry stands near the pullout couch, both hands resting on the windowsill. It must be past midnight; he spots only two cars, on either side of the intersection, soon pulling out of sight, their headlights dim in the blur of snow.
“All right, all right. No need to fuss.” Harry tugged on the gloves, which were surprisingly soft on the inside.
Balmy wind carried the salty trail of the sea as Harry, Joey, and Bennyson Carraway stood on an unpaved road a little ways from the ocean shore. They’d arrived in a tiny village minutes away from Nice, dressed in undercover Muggle clothes. Harry patted his upper arm, feeling for the wand holster hidden by long sleeves.
Harry’s expression darkened; he shook his head. “Voldemort is dead. He’s irrelevant. You matter a million times more.”
They followed her through a small gap in the crowd, where the pressed bodies and cheers and limbs made room. Harry could feel the energy here, like magic, coursing from the band up front to the listeners spread through the hall. Ginny began to move her hips and hands to the rhythm, smiling as she let the music take control.
He knew how flimsy that phrase was, how vague and uncomforting. But his cuts were healing, and the urge to reopen them had passed. Draco had spent days in his childhood home, curled up in old sheets as his thoughts flew back and forth like a doped Seeker. He put on a cheerful façade for Teddy, then cried on the floor of the bathroom. Andromeda had been a gift from gods, making Draco eat, walking with him in the garden as he rambled, not asking questions. She’d found a potion for him, too, a calming draught with Celtic Spinning Lavender to alleviate symptoms of anxiety.
“Don’t get cocky,” Draco replied, raising his hand for Professor Slughorn’s attention. The potioneer lumbered over, plaid stretching over his stomach, thoughtfully brushing his walrus-like mustache.
“Behold, the fruits of your labor!” She cried, eyes wild with happiness. “This was thanks to all your hard work, everyone! Savor it!”
Both Pansy and Henrietta paled, watching the wand with fearful expressions. Though no one but the girls and Harry had heard Draco’s threat, the people nearby fell silent at the exposed weapon. Except for the whispers - the whispers began as they recognized a Malfoy, and some older wizards began to draw their wands as well.
“Up ’til sixth year, you had…hmm, let me see,” Luna began to count on her fingers, “Gregory, Vincent, Pansy, Blaise, Theodore, Henrietta, Anaya, Marcus, Fuller, and Harper. Were you friends with Mafalda?”
“Face your fears,” Professor Dahlia said dramatically. She flicked her wand at the wardrobe, and the door began to creak open.
“I was under the impression that magic wasn’t allowed,” Joey said, voice understandably irked - Draco felt similarly, still antsy from the absence of his wand.
“Lovely morning, isn’t it?” Ron greeted all of them loudly. His broad grin didn’t fade even when he noticed Theodore. “What a surprise! Nott, is it?”
the Chosen One, after all, and he was doing much better in class than merely scraping by. Harry worried about Draco; what if the Ministry decided not to accept him after all and had only given him hope to snatch it away at the last moment?
Draco let silence fall then, which was a bit concerning. Then, looking over Harry’s shoulder, he sighed and said, “Oh, no.”
“There are some changes in staffing this year. Rubeus Hagrid has resigned from his post in order to pursue his passion as a dragon-trainer in Romania. He will be replaced by Professor Robert Quentin when he returns from his sabbatical in October.
Vietnam’s coast appeared on the horizon in the late morning, after a storm had come and gone. The sun’s rays were cruel in the absence of rain, and most people stayed in their cabins, anticipating arrival to Vung Tau, the port town that served as the threshold to Ho Chi Minh City. A two-hour bus ride and the Aurors would be in the heart of it, searching for Faraday.
“I’m fine, Potter,” He snapped, and at Harry’s hurt expression added, “But thank you for your concern, or whatever.”
“Harry.” A wave of dizziness suddenly rolled over Joey, and she swayed in place, watching stock-still, slightly perplexed at the hazy scene several hundred feet away. Two gray uniforms were huddled around someone’s fallen body.
Draco swatted at him, half-heartedly, then grew still, his eyes sliding closed. Harry smiled, leaning against the trunk of the lemon tree. Malfoy Manor stood at the top of the slope, so he could some of Wiltshire’s countryside, peppered with expansive roofs of expensive houses, leafy trees, and stone-walled courtyards between them. The sun had nearly touched the edge of the horizon.
“Do you think we did the right thing?” Draco asked, and his hand moved to rest on his forearm, clothed as usual in a long-sleeved button-down. “Not telling Joey everything about me?”
“True.” Harry quit moving his hands and instead clenched them together in his lap, so tightly that the brown skin became several shades paler.
“Gather ‘round, everyone,” Ginny said. She cleared her throat and flipped to the second page of her clipboard. “Chasers: Willow Amara, Danny Cliffe, and me. Beaters: Richie Coote and Eleanor Hicks. Keeper: Quinn Winters. Congratulations, kiddo.” A shy but agile wisp of a girl stepped forward and received claps on the back from the others. A third-year, she was the youngest Keeper for at least a generation. “Seeker: Harry Potter. And that, my friends, is your 1998-1999 Gryffindor Quidditch team. Practice starts at five next Tuesday. See you all there!”
“Yes,” Hermione replied, a faint blush dusting her cheeks. “Um, if that’s all right with you, Harry? Just the two of us?”
find out I told you anything, they will hunt me. They will hunt us both.” He made intense eye-contact with his former enemy. With a start, Harry realized that the ice blue he had come up with as his favorite color was the precise shade that ringed Draco’s inner irises. “Do you understand?”
Once the bell rang for lunch, Flitwick instructed the class to place their pieces on a table in the center of the room. Moving their bowl slowly, so as not to spill water and send the swans tumbling over the edge, Harry and Draco were one of the last pairs to finish and exit the classroom. Spotting Hermione and Ron just ahead, Harry headed for them, Draco walking close behind.
The boy beamed, and Harry smiled at the familiar scene. He missed those more carefree days, before Voldemort’s return when Remus and Tonks and Sirius were alive…Harry cleared his throat and ran an absent hand through his untidy black hair. No. He had done his mourning.
“You want to know the best part of this?” Lucius says with relish, still holding his son’s arm. “He can make it disappear and reappear at will. Go on, Draco. Try it.”
“‘As you like it?’” Ron said, indignant at the way his girlfriend was so willing to let the Slytherin into their inner circle. “Hermione, this scumbag called you a- a Mud…No, I won’t say it.”
Harry turns, spots Draco’s naked, sleeping form tangled in the sheets, face relaxed and turned towards the window. Harry can’t pin down his grin, even as he realizes it’s been a full year. He recognizes this scene, the one repeated over and over in the few days after New Year’s: hands and mouths frantic with desire, clothes tugged and torn without thinking, the pent-up affection of the year prior releasing in a flood of wanting.
“Thanks.” Ron kept his head bent as he flipped to the table of contents. He seemed to be more focused than usual on his studies - though Harry suspected that studious tendency came along with Hermione being his girlfriend.
As they watched the lanterns fade into the night, Harry felt the tight knot within his chest unravel. The guilt, the regret, all flowed out of his eyes without him being able to stop it. The pause they’d taken from the bustle of life, to remember the dead, had finally melted something within him, a coldness in his heart that he hadn’t even realized was there.
” They shouted to their companions. Swift as a lightning bolt, the other two abandoned their fights and clutched at the robes of the dog-masked wizard, all three Disapparating in a shower of gold sparks.
“I’m looking forward to demolishing the other houses in Quidditch and winning the Cup,” Ginny proclaimed.
“It’s good to have you back, Hagrid,” Harry replied, giving his friend a hug. Hagrid patted him on the head with so much force Harry’s knees almost buckled. Draco let out a quiet whimper of alarm.
look awfully nice on him. Out of spite, he grabbed a black one with shiny, gray abalone buttons, instead. “Do me a favor…” He began, meaning to say,
“Blue,” Harry replied immediately. His own wand, limply gripped, lay next to him on the stone floor.
Malfoy blinked and shook his head, the lovey-dovey expression on his face replaced by his normal stern one. "I…" He began, glancing at Harry. "Oh, sweet Merlin. Did I really say all those things to you? And hold your hand?" Draco's porcelain-pale cheeks flushed a deep red, which Harry found quite gratifying. "Sorry about that. I'm so embarrassed." The other students were making similar apologies to their partners, and everyone's skin was tinted in varying shades of pink.
“I want to show you something,” Draco said in a low voice, and Harry, still distracted, blushed, an idea of what the “something” could be popping into his mind before he could stop it.
“Don’t speak too soon,” Draco replies, nervously gulping down mango. “I’m surprised it’s worked so well for this long.”
Ron organized the other, spilled books into a neat stack before reaching for his own plate. He waited for a few minutes for Hermione to say something, but she only continued to turn pages with her left hand, munching the sandwich with her right. These days, Ron reflected, Hermione seemed to be throwing herself more into her schoolwork - and subsequently spending less time with him.
In fact, he didn’t say anything at all as their shoes crunched through the half-frozen grass. Harry did nothing to break the silence, which was both a blessing and a curse; he needed the lack of conversation for a bit to calm down, but halfway to the dungeons, Harry found his mind wandering to his affection for Draco. He cared for the Slytherin nearly as much as he cared for Hermione and Ron, which was incredible considering how much time they’d spent hating each other’s guts. Perhaps the line between love and hate was razor-thin, after all.
“I’m sorry.” To his embarrassment and Draco’s surprise, tears began to fall into Harry’s lap - he had bowed his head, unable to look Draco in the eye. “I d-didn’t know what the spell did, I didn’t mean to…”
“I admit I’m not familiar,” Faraday mused, “But it seems to be working.” She hid the Dark Mark once more, and Draco immediately retrieved his wrist, redoing the buttons.
In the warm darkness of the dorms, Harry was able to get away from his friends’ questions. The only sound rippling through the silence was Draco’s breathing, which sounded slow and even. Though Harry doubted that the Slytherin would fall asleep that quickly, especially so early, he still kept quiet as he got dressed.
, before you interrupted me,” Amélie shot back. “I’m quite envious of her if you must know. She partnered with Andreas during our exercises,” She grumbled.
“Maybe.” Draco slid over Harry’s mug of steaming, jasmine tea. He pulled over two chairs from the dining room with his wand, then transfigured the legs to better suit the higher counter. “A lot of people are getting married these days,” Draco commented, taking a sip of his drink.
“M’lady,” Ron spoke in an overly posh accent as he offered his arm to Hermione. The trio made it to the bottom of the steps, joining the crowd below. A few of the eighth years waved to them, and Harry waved back.
“I suppose not. But seeing as I know no one else here,” Draco holds out his hand. “Let’s start over. My name is Draco Malfoy. I just moved here from England.”
“It’ll be fine,” Harry reassured his former rival. “Draco is going to be sitting with us this week,” He pronounced to Ron and Hermione. “Look, I know we always haven’t had the best relationship with him, but I think we can all set aside our differences with some effort. The other Slytherin eighth-years sort of…abandoned him during lunch, so I thought we could give him our company for the time being.”
“Yes, I’m… I’m bi,” Harry looked between her and Ron, who was grinning. “What are you two smiling at? You aren’t mad?”
“Merlin’s third leg,” Harry tutted as they started slowly down the stairs. “Thought you’d remember to drink something, at least.”
It didn’t feel much like familial love to Joey. It felt like an indentureship. Which, apparently, Caroline had experience with.
Harry was going to miss the Weasleys. Sure, he’d make a point to Floo every holiday, but he couldn’t predict the future. Being an Auror, even in-training, would take him around the country - around the globe. Not to mention the danger involved - he could
Her words didn’t help Harry feel any better. He and Draco hadn’t spoken since studying for Potions two nights ago, which could be a coincidence. But he couldn’t help but worry; had he accidentally said something to offend him? When Draco touched his necklace, did the coldness of it bother him somehow? So buried was Harry within his own thoughts, Draco had to call his name three times before he turned around.
“Thanks,” Harry breathed, and he didn’t move for a moment, heart racing. The image was still burned into his brain: the two of them in a whirlwind, each fighting for the other’s last breath. Prophecy? Or more likely, a paranoid thought caused by stress?
“Latifah,” Joey murmured in response, eyes still closed. Her friend, not one to be deterred, removed her comforting touch and gave her a hard pinch in the arm. “Ah! What was that for?”
“If you must know, we’re just fine.” Harry left it at that, and stiffly raised a glass of orange juice to his lips. In reality, he spoke only half the truth.
“Wait.” Harry stops the mechanical movements, taking Draco’s hands in his own. Draco breathes hard, with lust and a little bit of fear. Harry recognizes the hint of distrust that still lingers, the instinct that tells Draco he’ll be fucked and tossed aside in a blink of an eye. “Come back to mine.”
“Hold on, Harry,” Luna said suddenly. “There’s a reason I came to talk to you,” She murmured, tapping her chin thoughtfully. Under her breath, she sang a quick strain of the same wordless tune she had been humming before. Apparently, this refreshed Luna’s memory, and she stated, “Ginny and I are coming out today.”
A tear finally makes it down Justin’s cheek. His hand twitches, as if to wipe it away, but he lets it glisten, pretending as if it’s not there. “You know,” he says despondently. “You wanted it done.”
“It’s all a bit new,” Ginny said sheepishly. “She’s…” She sighed, a faraway, dreamy look coming to her eyes. “Well, you’ll meet her later. I should probably go; I’m supposed to be explaining away a gnome attack to Hermione’s cousin. Her parents are the only ones who know Ron’s a wizard, so we can’t use a lot of magic until the reception.”
Hermione bit her lip thoughtfully. “Red robes…Traditionally worn by east Asian wizards, the same way Europeans wear black and north Africans wear yellow.”
Narcissa had whispered an idea to him when there were two minutes left; it seemed preposterous, far-fetched. But she was desperate - and so was Draco.
Harry scrambled to his feet, Luna jogging to keep up with him as he skidded to the door that had appeared in the wall. Without wasting another second, Harry turned the knob and threw it open.
Theodore gave him an address, some hoity-toity street in London, and the pair walked back inside. In the time they’d been gone, Luna, Ginny, Cass, and Ron had finished and chatted near the entrance with large, paper bags emblazoned with the shop’s logo. Draco wandered back to the shirt rack he’d been browsing, wavering between the options. He chose the black one in the end; silver simply didn’t go well with his complexion.
“That’s great!” Hermione said with a smile, but it faded as she noticed Malfoy. The Slytherin had only just melted out of the shadows behind Harry.
A delicate, gray-blue peeks through winter blanketing the sky. It takes a moment for the scenery to become familiar to Harry. Lush trees, their leaves in shades of orange, yellow, red, and green rustle in the autumn breeze. Birds chirp among the branches, but Harry can hear the telltale sounds of a city, too - cars honking, the footsteps of pedestrians.
” Harry cried, seemingly on accident, since he looked furious at himself moments later. Draco slashed his wand upward, blocking the spell effortlessly.
Staying in halls filled with magic and bonsai trees, sleeping in one place, and eating Thai food sounded tempting. But England, the apartment, their old life, waited. Draco knew they were so close to going home.
Draco lets out a high-pitched laugh, uncontrollable, and presses a hand to his mouth to keep more from coming out. “Christ, Harry, you can be so - so selfish! No, I…” He shakes his head, taking a step back. “No, I shouldn’t get mad at you. You don’t know anything, after all.”
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes was in clear view at the end of the street, exploding with even more color and energy than the rest of the shops. But Harry noticed, tucked between the open stores, that a few of them were closed and shuttered. Some windows had shattered completely, and no one had bothered to fix them, leaving the shadowy shells behind empty.
“Something better than nothing.” Joey waited for a few long minutes, but the drip-accompanied quiet yielded no answers. She sighed, hand sliding down her chest.
“Harry Potter.” The amplified voice sounded like that of an older female. “Harry Potter, we wish to speak to you. Unarmed.”
A line formed on Draco’s forehead. “Yes. But I can’t…think of anything. Nothing happy enough, anyway.” He seemed genuinely distressed, his voice trembling and wand dipping in defeat.
A small object lay in front of the grate, so unobtrusive that Harry missed it the first time he glanced hastily around the room. It was a mask made of intricately carved wood, one of its edges charred, black, and appearing soft. The mask took the form of a snarling wolf, with two eye-shaped holes. The design, fearsome and familiar, was unmistakable.
On Monday afternoon, Harry’s eyes were watering over the cramped handwriting of a mission report he was supposed to be interpreting when Antigone herself arrived at his and Joey’s office space - the Auror Carraway still hadn’t made an appearance.
“Malfoy,” McGonagall said sternly, and Draco left his place at the planter - Harry saw him visibly swallow in apprehension.
“Away where?” Joey had known different houses, cities, and time zones for the past five years. Any place was “away.”
“Er…yeah,” Harry stood up as well, though he made no attempts to improve his appearance - his hair would appear messy no matter what he did to it. Before turning the doorknob, he paused to look at Draco, who worriedly fidgeted with his hands. “Hey, Draco. Don’t think you were making me do that, by the way. I wanted to.”
“You do.” Harry brushes his thumb along Draco’s cheek, and is only half-surprised to find a tear. “Christ, Draco, you deserve more than I could every give to you.”
Harry knew she was bluffing; they hadn’t been able to contact England in months, but he played along. “Whoever you are, do you seriously think you could take a hundred Aurors?”
Draco lowers himself until they’re nose to nose. Harry could count his eyelashes. “I don’t know how I dealt with you for two years.”
Cursing under his breath, Harry mounted his broomstick and rose through the trees, unable to shake the feeling of eyes on the back of his neck.
Harry was almost afraid to follow. He took another breath of the heavy air to prepare himself and Apparated to the foyer.
The memory of this strange voice from above pulls Harry into The Raven and the Mushroom. The bookshelves, the small tables, the homey, nature-themed décor turns into a blur, and Harry focuses on the cash register.
“You don’t have to say anything,” Harry says, unknowingly closing the distance. Whiskey and lavender and silver eyes ensnare him. “Whatever it is you want to tell me…it’ll come.”
he thought, not disappointedly, but as a simple observance. Light brown skin, not without its imperfections, startling eyes, the scar branching across his forehead, black hair that he’d given up on trying to press flat long ago. It stood up all over the place, as usual, and Harry ran his hands through it, trying to at least make it appear askew with
“You don’t have to tell me everything,” Draco soothes, and then his lips are there, just beneath his ear. “Even though I do.” The pout in his voice is apparent.
“But when I got there…He was with this girl that I’d never seen before. And…” A lump grows in Harry’s throat at the memory, whose edges are already bleeding into this one. “He acted like he didn’t recognize me.”
“I thought it would behoove me to inform you four of this latest…” Kingsley’s deep, soothing voice paused as he refilled his tea. “Development. On the Following front.”
As if sensing the Seeker’s intent, the golden sphere gave a whirr of surprise and flew upward, making Harry abruptly jerk his broom. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco’s blond head turn, then his figure moving quickly towards him.
Wavering guitar chords ring out into the tiny apartment. Pansy hums along and wanders into the kitchen.
“You may want to get better sources than one Miss Amélie Vernier,” Antigone scolded, and Harry grinned sheepishly. “But whomever she heard that from wasn’t entirely wrong. It’s a similar brand of magic, drawing from the knowledge of all your skills to decide which people you’d work the best with.”
Harry’s hands removed themselves from the buttons. His fingertips hesitantly reached forward, brushing Draco’s skin. It was then, in the dim light, that he glimpsed the pale, slightly raised lines.
Utter blackness met him at the threshold. A shiver ran through Harry as he realized that beyond it, the sunlight didn’t pierce the shadow, as if the entire Room of Requirement was filled with unmovable ink. “Draco?” He called cautiously, reluctant to step inside.
“Hm.” Draco lifted himself up on his arms and looked at the sliver of moon that had joined its bright daughters in the sky. “We should go home.
“Not personally. It doesn’t matter.” Something tugged in Joey’s stomach. A hunger. She clenched her fist, then relaxed it.
“Wait a moment.” Draco placed the ingredients on the counter and slid over his textbook, brow furrowing as he thought of something. “Cut the licorice into slivers, Potter. As thin as you can.”
“Maybe it’s because…” Harry shrugged. “I’ve always gotten a lot more chances than you have. And you sought me out first, after all.”
A flicker of movement caught the two young wizards’ attention. The giant squid had made an appearance, gliding slowly by the window. Its soft skin appeared dark red, with flecks of orange around its tentacles.
“Thank you,” Harry replied, and he meant it, though his eyes were scanning the crowd spilling from the stands. Who he was looking for, he couldn’t be sure.
Narcissa tilted her chin. “Perhaps not.” She lowered her voice so Hyacinthe would not hear. “You’ve done well with my letter. I did not expect the Ministry to help you. How did you persuade them?”
“The door, get to the door, the door!” Draco screams as he clutches Potter’s body as tightly as possible to keep from falling off. Tears, elicited from the stinging smoke, inch down his cheeks, but can’t bother to let go and wipe them away.
Only Draco Malfoy would use “the former” in casual conversation. Harry almost cries, but he throws his arms around Draco instead, burying his face in his green cardigan.
“Thanks.” Harry hadn’t quite gotten used to having her around, but he wasn’t about to object to having another friend. He took the parchment and unfolded it:
Neither man spoke as they emerged onto the snow-glazed street. Draco strode away, cursing to himself, and Harry had to jog to keep up. They reached a small glade a little way from The Three Broomsticks; bare-branched trees and Hogsmeade buildings sheltered them from the busy road, and it was only until he was sure that they were out of earshot from anyone else did Draco shout in frustration.
The six students settled in a secluded corner of the room, the presence of a Slytherin having spooked a couple of nearby younger Gryffindors away. Ginny and Luna sat close together, and after a moment’s hesitation, Ginny took her girlfriend’s hand. There was no outward reaction from the other four, though Harry exchanged a meaningful glance with Luna as Ginny began to speak.
Draco nodded. He leaned down, pressing his lips against Harry’s forehead, feeling him melt slightly in the closed gap between them. Every feature of him was close, his locks of mussed hair, soft lips, brown skin interrupted by the jagged slash of the pale scar. But Draco valued Harry’s words and the heart he spoke them with more than anything else.
“Simple yet effective,” Harry replied with a grin. A drop of water slid down his temple and dripped off his chin, pink from the blood smeared on his forehead. “Let’s go.”
“She means Joey,” Draco said, nudging him. “Joanne split from us a while back to rescue a few innocents in a possible battle zone.”
Draco would have kicked him if he could. “Don’t be sour.” Then, to Joey, “It’s not your fault. Whoever poisoned you - they might have been working with that wizard in Manila. Someone’s out to get you.”
Hermione chuckled and shook her head. “You’re a terrible liar, Harry. He got him to remove it for you, didn’t he?”
“But I haven’t had this in years!” Ron sighed, tearing off a chunk of pastry. “I’ve missed this. Reminds me of the good old days, when we met Harry, remember?” Ron guffawed at the memory. “You nearly bought out the whole cart!”
Feeling a little awkward, Harry looked to his left at the few rows of empty chairs. He wanted to imagine that Fred was sitting in one of them, that his spirit had not yet left.
But Ron and Hermione only feigned support when they thought Harry’s crush was some innocent, faceless girl, not the merciless and cruel Malfoy heir. Merciless, ha. Harry wished they’d at least stayed, on that blustery Saturday morning, to hear him out, to see Draco through his eyes.
The mirror, the closet, out the door to the parking lot – the route that Harry has taken many times before is marred by an ugly gouge in the gray metal of his Toyota, deep and straight  in the side. “What…” He mutters, looking around the rows of cars, but there’s no one nearby. He glares at the ostentatiously violet low-rider next to him, which looks suspiciously close. Harry kicks its tire, which is no solution at all, and settles for a murmured “Asshole,” before slamming the damaged door of his car and heading for the train station.
The common room grew silent. A pair of fourth years brought their Weasley’s Wheezes firecracker to the floor, listening intently.
Someone was running to them across the grass. Both Joey and Draco glanced up, but Harry, his face buried in his hands, did not react as Antigone Connors drew near, her usually stern expression struck with grief as she saw the fallen.
“Yes, please.” As Harry walked away, Draco took several deep breaths. It was fine. The flickering light of the fire and the darkness outside, coupled with the random flashes of fireworks, would certainly distort shadows and shapes. Harry surely wouldn’t notice anything.
Draco rested his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Their gazes met for a moment, and Draco managed to convey in a single look,
“Also…before we leave, visit the armory and get a couple of grappling hooks, flares, and smoke bombs,” Joey instructed. “I have a feeling this will take more grunt work than we’re used to.”
“I can’t Apparate?” Joey’s disbelief broke her voice. “Is it because I’m injured? How can I gain back the ability?”
The office hadn’t changed since she’d last been in it, about half a year ago. A fireplace flickered with heatless flames, the large desk and gold nameplate upon it was polished to a high shine, and the enchanted window showed the same, timeless view. The carpeted crags of the Mbe mountains rose high over a small hut, its chimney eternally trailing with smoke. Joey had never seen this place in person, but her mother’s many sisters had described the mountaintops, the surrounding trees, the weathered mud of the house’s walls. The ancestral home of the Obianagha bloodline - Joey’s mother’s maiden name.
“What?” Harry peers around the kitchen opening to see a cassette tape by the door. It sits atop a thin, clipped-shut manila folder. He figures it must have gone through the mail slot and was unknowingly pushed aside when they came in. “No, I haven’t seen before.”
Harry rose high above the pitch, watching the players as they weaved around each other like dancers. He smiled to himself, looking forward to what would surely be a violence-free, easy school year.
“You’re not gay,” Ginny said, raising an eyebrow. “You’ve kissed me before, I can tell you’re definitely into girls.”
“Hey, you’re with me now, aren’t you? On a date with a half-blood,” Harry pointed out, and Draco started to smile.
“I should have known this would happen again.” Luna hears him, but Justin seems to be muttering mostly to himself. He turns, finally, eyes hollow. When he speaks to her, his voice is faraway, placing her out of arm’s reach. “You’ve loved her already. It was stupid of me to think you would stop.”
As they emerged from the forest, a bit of sunshine nudged its way through the blanket of clouds. The rain didn’t slow, so Draco and Harry pulled up their hoods again. The light turned the drops golden, making the dewy grass sparkle, and at certain angles, Harry could see hints of a rainbow in the atmosphere.
. Glad to start the day with a challenging class!" He gestured widely to the potion-making stations, each equipped with a large, heavy-bottomed cauldron. "Pair up, everyone."
“Well, Padma just got engaged,” Harry reminded him, nodding at the wedding invitation in their haphazard pile of mail. “He could be riled up because of that.”
“I still have questions,” Joey said, ignoring what had just happened, “Starting with, why did you join a pureblood terrorist group?”
It wasn’t long before the voices of their fellow eighth years began to leak through the door to the classroom. Hermione rocked back and forth on her feet a few times. “Should we let them in?”
“Call me Ollie,” Corrected one Hufflepuff boy, his grin full of lime-green braces and a ballpoint pen poking out from behind his ear, nearly covered by a mop of dark hair. Harry guessed he was Muggleborn. “Valdez, sixth year. Harry Potter, of course. And it’s Malfoy, right?” He spoke rapidly, sticking out a sun-dark hand for two hasty shakes from each young man.
Draco’s insides twisted, and from Harry’s suddenly tight grip, he must have been feeling the same way. “Joey. Joey, we need to go
Potter turns to look at the place where Draco sits, and a look of confusion crosses his face. Draco rolls his eyes and leans close so he can whisper without detection.
“Shut up!” Draco cried. He felt the bracelets that were supposed to be dulling his magic shudder, responding to his anger. It took all of his willpower to not strangle Lucius right then and there.
“You really think they’re faking that?” Hermione asked quietly as Harry sat down a little way from them, and Ron knew she must have been watching.
“Ow, Gavin, stop it!” Padma protested, trying to wriggle free from his grasp. Her expression had shifted rapidly from exasperation to fear. “You’re hurting me!”
The sixth ward of Ho Chi Minh City hadn’t known silence in decades. The chirps of frogs and cicadas, drowned out by roaring engines, footsteps, and laughter, filled Draco’s ears, and he focused on the steady clicks and hum of the payphone, watching Harry’s hands as they slid in quarters, pressed numbers, and brought the receiver close to their faces.
“I agree,” Harry said, and he turned to his companion, whose brows were knitted together in worry. “Ron and Hermione will be fine with it, sooner or later. Ginny was.”
As I mentioned before, it’s absolutely spectacular. (Unfortunately, it is, as cultural icons often are, a product of its time, and includes an unironic use of the f-slur by Winslet.) Reading this fic before watching the film will probably lead to a couple of spoilers, but it’s a great watch nevertheless.
“Your mother would have accepted my decision. Being stubborn, seeking your own version of justice, even compromising safety of others. That is a choice your father would have made.”
Draco approached slowly, as if trying not to startle her, and sat down on a chair next to the bed. Narcissa reached out and touched his cheek, the faintest hint of affection in her gaze. Her blonde hair turned whitish-grey at the roots - it was the oldest she’d ever looked. Draco was alarmed to see that her wrist was bony, her limbs and face almost emaciated.
Both Draco and Harry hesitated, giving each other one of those glances that Joey had no hope of decrypting. “What are we waiting for?” She demanded.
Smirking, Draco raised a finger to his lips. If they hadn’t been dueling, he might have said something like,
When Draco slips his tongue between Harry’s lips, something electric arcs between them - Harry realizes, suddenly, how badly he’s wanted this very moment. Draco seems to come to the same revelation; his hands echo with it, gripping Harry’s collar. Somehow, they stumble to the nearby alleyway, and Draco unzips Harry’s jacket, fumbling with his belt…
Suddenly, Harry’s expression changed, eyes widening, and he nodded. “Transgender,” he echoed, “I remember now. Hermione mentioned that in her essay.”
A light drizzle had begun to fall when the spectators filled in the bleachers of the Quidditch pitch. Harry, fully dressed, nervously tugged at his gloves, glancing from the overcast sky to the crowds of students settling into their seats, from the dewy grass to the other six members of his team that milled about near the dressing room. Ginny spoke with the other two Chasers, Willow and Danny, tracing golden play patterns in the air with her wand. The Beaters, Richie and Eleanor, stretched out their arms and practiced swinging their bats while chatting. Quinn, the Keeper, stood close by, watching the goal hoops with such intensity one might think she was trying to set them on fire by sheer force of will.
Harry considered this. “Hermione and Ron haven’t seen him. Andromeda said…” His face lit up. “Actually, she was rather vague about it; I asked if Draco was there, and her letter only said ‘I’m sure he’s fine,’ he’s probably….” He leaped to his feet, buttoning his cloak. “I’ll see if I can-”
“It’s quite fun, you should join,” Harry told her, then realized that was a stupid thing to say. “I mean, er…I guess you’re leaving Hogwarts, so…”
“Saying that proves your remorse,” Harry pointed out. “Besides, you were raised to be a Death Eater. You’re not fully responsible for
Too vague, maybe? Not realistic enough, perhaps. Imagining a fantasy wouldn’t do Draco much good. Him being an Auror against his will wasn’t likely to change, so he would make the best of it. Study what interested him, work alongside Harry. The Dark Mark probably wouldn’t go away, either; it would always be writhing, just below the surface. Well, fine.
Besides the cloud of distrust that surrounded the outsider, dinner passed with its usual chatter. Ginny told a story about seeing Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, getting a bucket of water dumped on it by a pair of brazen Ravenclaw sixth years, to her family’s great amusement.
Overlooking a couple of romantic liaisons, Harry didn’t notice much of a difference. When they were alone together, Draco let his guard down and show his emotions more. But on the surface, he seemed to be the exact same sardonic, snarky, and pragmatic boy he’d always been.
A bird suddenly flew through the walkway, diving just a foot away from Harry’s face and landing on a tree in front of them. The two friends paused to watch it hop between the branches, flutter its brown wings, and tilt its head playfully.
, he realized and gulped down lemonade to calm himself. It wasn’t death he was afraid of; he’d already experienced it. Harry glanced across the kitchen counter at Draco, who stared off towards the garden, silver eyes lost in a daydream. No, death didn’t scare him. He was afraid of what would happen to the people he left behind.
“Who?” Draco’s voice is staticky; Harry glances at him, at his blurry outline. His features disappear for a second, leaving a smooth, pale expanse where his face should be, then everything reappears. Harry, a bit sick to his stomach, looks away.
“Shh.” Harry rested a hand on his arm to stop him, and they both came to a standstill. Luna continued forward, palming a chunk of bloody meat. She hummed, soft and slow, and Harry recognized the tune.
Draco purses his lips and gives an indecisive shiver. “Yeah, all right,” He decides finally, and briskly walks over, sliding into the warmth of the car. “There are less interesting ways to die than being murdered by a stalker,” He says casually.
No word in any dictionary could describe how awkward the following silence is. Harry stares straight ahead, but out of the corner of his eye, he sees Draco down a full swallow of whatever caramel-colored alcohol had just been in his glass.
Resisting the urge to turn around and face Draco, who dutifully took notes a few seats away, Harry folded the parchment and slipped it back between the pages. He tried to squash his grin as he copied the diagram for transfigurative wrist movements.
“Wait a moment, Harry,” Professor Dahlia said, waiting for the other three to leave before continuing. She scrutinized Harry with deep brown eyes, giving him the x-ray feeling that Dumbledore’s stare often had. “You are…extraordinarily compassionate towards Draco Malfoy.”
The Slytherin stepped close enough so that Harry could see the torchlight reflected in his pale eyes. Draco’s lips parted, and for a wild second, Harry thought he was going to kiss him. But Draco’s pale fingers reached out instead, gently brushing Harry’s neck until they looped underneath the invisible chain. His hand grasped in a fist around what looked to be empty air, feeling the stone. Anxiety past in a flash across Draco’s face then disappeared. He dropped the necklace back into Harry’s shirt and stepped back casually.
Copious amounts of golden steam rose from eight different cauldrons, making everyone’s eyes water. Throughout the dungeon, each pair of students squinted through the shimmering haze, carefully mixing the ingredients of nearly finished Annoyance Draught.
me. I mean, I…” He stammers, still reeling. “What am I supposed to with that? He’s given me nothing to work with.”
“Got any pesos on ye?” Charon asked as they stopped in front of a food stand. A couple of ducks and chickens, stripped of feathers and not yet beheaded, hung limply from meat hooks. Slabs of roasted pork sat behind smudged glass, while an enormous rice cooker emitted steam nearby. Joey couldn’t see a single vegetable.
“Hey.” Harry walked over to him and pressed a swift kiss to Draco’s lips before moving to his own bed, gently tucking the Nimbus beneath it. “How was your day?”
“I’ll be sure to tell the Ministry everything,” Arthur said once Harry had finished. Next to his father, Percy had managed to scribble down notes on Harry’s account. “This is handy information, Harry, thank you.”
No one spoke for a long while as Joey slowly sat up straight, posture unfurling like a growing fern, lips parted, and jaw clenched. Afraid to break the silence, Draco said nothing and shook his head sharply at Harry when he opened his mouth. A different kind of magic, not emanating from the Aurors, nor even Faraday, charged the air. Draco shivered as a strong feeling of foreboding stole over him, as if some malicious, demon-like thing was about to emerge from Joey’s chest.
The gnome took the opportunity to bite Draco with its razor-sharp teeth, and the wizard gave a cry, dropping the creature. “Son of a…” Draco inhaled sharply as crimson blood dripped from his hand onto the snow-covered ground. Shaking away the pain, he read the address on the letter, eyes widening in astonishment.
Harry tells himself firmly that he doesn’t want Draco. And he certainly won’t when he does the erasing.
Draco eyed the towering, haphazard structure with a mix of criticism and bewilderment. The Weasley’s abode was vastly different from his own family’s lavish estate, and Ron detected Draco’s instinctual disdain at once.
“Look,” She said, and that was all it took to get Draco’s and Harry’s attention, and they both stood, following her gaze.
A dark look passed over Draco’s face, and Harry flinched, worried that he had gone too far. “My parents taught me that marriage was a sacred bond between a man and a woman.
Draco didn’t answer right away, which Harry found annoying. The blond lazily turned a page, refusing to look at Harry as he spoke. “I haven’t the foggiest idea what you’re talking about.”
Draco snickered and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, bending his head until their mouths were scarce inches apart. “All right, I get it, Potter.”
The thought stops cold. Justin had promised himself he wouldn’t think about it. He needs to get out of here, to let February slap him across the face.
Harry lay down on the bleachers, one leg propped up on a bench. His emerald eyes took in the pale void above, his mind drifting through the emptiness and the silence.
"I'd like to be left alone. If you don't mind." Ginny's voice had a muffled quality as if she was speaking from her pillow.
Slughorn checked the golden pocket watch hanging off a chain on his waistcoat. "Shouldn't be more than five minutes more. As long as your partner
“Athena’s getting wet again,” Draco fretted, peeking into his robes at the owl loosely wrapped inside, hooting pitifully.
“Me neither.” Harry’s words are robotic, following a script. He needs to get through this memory as fast as possible. Draco’s lips look terribly, terribly soft, and if Harry’s not careful, he’ll miss him even more. “Ever thought about having kids?”
"How're you holding up, mate?" Harry said quietly to his best friend. Ron wasn't openly crying, but Harry could tell he had been earlier.
“But say we give an account,” Draco said worriedly. “My mother’s letter is bound to come up somehow, and we’ve probably broken Ministry regulations reading it…”
But the words have left Harry, too, for Draco slides a freezing-cold hand to his face, fingertips tangling in his hair.
“I know.” Draco opened his eyes again, watched as tears slipped down Harry’s cheeks, unbidden. Harry made no move to wipe them away. All these years being battered by the world, and he still wore his heart on his sleeve. “I know you can take care of yourself, Draco. It’s just hard for me to let you. I… I blame myself for those around me that fall.” Harry drew near, spreading his hands, the ones that could fill with power. “It’s stupid. I shouldn’t.”
As if sensing his presence, Potter looked over his shoulder and met Draco’s eyes; the Boy Who Lived wore an open and friendly expression on his face. “Hey, Malfoy,” Potter said as Draco neared. A look of disgust flitted across Weasley’s face as quickly as lightning, but the Slytherin didn’t miss it. Granger, however, gave him the courtesy of a nod.
“Fine,” Draco relented and continued as the Auror poured caramel-colored liquid into the cups. “Firstly, I’d like to know when and if my parents are going to Azkaban.”
Now, she knew better. As the sun drew gold lines upon the surface of the water, Joey clenched her jaw and admitted to herself that she was itching for a fight.
“Hold on a moment,” Joey said, looking up sharply, “Are there wards up around here?” She paused to take the offered food. “Can’t risk anyone listening in.”
Draco ran a hand through his white-blond tresses, noting that they’d gotten a bit frizzy after being away from the shower for so long. He looked forward to getting home, having that wank, and a long hot bath. Maybe pop in a film if he felt like it.
By the time Draco had finished, the Great Hall had been filled, and the food cooled. The mist outside had dissipated somewhat, and morning rays of sunshine streamed into the castle. Other students at the Gryffindor table glanced at the lone Slytherin within their midst, but no one dared to approach.
Usually though, those people are either his friends or girls he sleeps with. Harry knows he has no real need to sort Draco into either of those categories, but it also bothers him that neither fit.
“My mother used to wash my hair every night when I was little,” He said softly, and Harry fell silent, listening. “She didn’t tell me that she loved me very often. Not in so many words. But this routine was her way of caring for me, telling me that she’d always be there for me.” Draco gently washed at Harry’s roots, then worked his way to the ends, noticing how long his hair was when it was wet.
“Just like old times,” Ron said happily, draping an arm around Hermione’s shoulder. She leaned into him on instinct, and Harry couldn’t help but admire their relaxed dynamic. Secretly, he looked forward to their wedding.
The two Seekers and their scrimmage teams hovered on either side of the field. With a few expert waves of her wand, Ginny caused the Bludgers and the Quaffle to float in the center, letting the Snitch flit freely around the pitch.
Luckily, the nearest classroom stood empty, its door ajar, so Draco slipped inside as Potter followed. Draco closed the door and thought about locking it, but he didn’t want to give his friend the wrong idea.
Draco inhaled sharply, but the light came back as suddenly as it had gone out, and Faraday continued.
A flurry of gray feathers and incessant hooting showered upon Harry as he entered the castle. Spluttering, he spit one out of his mouth and looked wildly around as Athena landed on his shoulder. “Oh - hello.” Athena head-butted Harry affectionately, her talons uncomfortably digging into his skin.
“Yup.” Theodore looked slightly amused at being addressed with such affability but shook Ron’s and Hermione’s hands.
“Come.” Ray held out his arm, and all three Aurors grasped it. With a twist of darkness, the early-morning buzz and smog of the city disappeared.
“Such a flatterer. I’m blushing,” Draco said, deadpan, but his pale cheeks did seem to darken a bit.
“You won’t find tea like this anywhere else,” Danjuma said insistently, already floating a stout ceramic thermos and two teacups onto the desk.
Reddish-golden light shone through the trunks of trees in shy beams, illuminating their faces. Harry touched Draco’s face, turned bronze by the fading sunlight, and found himself sinking into his eyes again. He had a sudden thought to take Draco into the woods, drag him to the ground, expose every inch of skin, worship his body with his hands and lips until he felt perfectly all right again. But the thought was just that, a thought, and Harry decided he would let it be.
This answer seemed slightly more satisfactory, but the man’s trepidation was not assuaged, and he continued to examine her passport with aggravating slowness. Joey must have been annoyed to hell, but her voice was even as she said, “I’m with those two.” She turned to gesture at Harry and Draco.
“No problem. Now go before I have a heart attack from your politeness.” Justin waves her off. As the door closes, he kisses Luna gently on the nose. “Just you and me, princess.”
Bruising pain enveloped his limbs and body as Harry rolled off his broom, his right hand clutching something for dear life. Cass inhaled sharply as they scrambled apart and to their feet; she was limping. Harry opened his hand, and the Snitch fluttered cheerfully.
“It was not their turn to die.” McGonagall’s voice broke, and Harry felt a lump form in his throat. “Our children may have been of age, but they were taken too soon - not by fate, but by death, unjust and merciless. We cannot forget our brave friends. We
“Oh…I thought that might be a path I’d follow, someday,” Draco said, self-conscious that he’d revealed a former aspiration. “Before…you know…”
“Perhaps we’d better sit down.” Draco nodded to the window seat. A bit reluctantly, Harry left his arms and settled upon the cushions as Draco placed his satchel on the floor.
“Draco, it’s okay,” Harry lay a comforting hand on his arm. “Ginny and Luna know already. They can keep a secret.”
The sound of the gymnasium door creaking open makes Harry turn his head. A familiar blond head and pale sloping shoulders sends a stab of regret through him, especially as the figure slumps on the bench just outside.
“Harry, could you say that again?” Hermione said timidly. A gust of wind caused her hair to partially obscure her face, but she didn’t move it out of the way. “I don’t understand.”
“Uh…” Dahlia leaned over to peer around Hermione, giving her friends a curious look. “Yep. Indeed I am. What are you all doing here?”
Harry walked surrounded by his friends, the candlelight dimly illuminating their faces. Gravel crunched beneath their feet as they reached the shore; boats upon boats were docked there, ready to push off. Hermione clambered in first, helping in Harry, Draco, Ron, and Henrietta. The vessels filled quickly and cast off automatically, heading for the deeper parts of the Black Lake.
Harry chuckled and pulled him close. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, his chin nestling in the crook of his neck, his eyes sliding closed in exhaustion and relief. “Good, I see you’re back to normal,” Harry joked. Then, quietly, in Draco’s ear, “I love you.”
Harry let Draco take a shower first once they made it back to their room. Draco didn’t reach for the soap for a long time, allowing the water to fall from the rain-styled showerhead and leaning his forehead against the tile. There was a tightness in his chest like he was about to cry, but no tears came. He blamed it on exhaustion, on the aftereffects of the panic and action of the night before. How different this moment was, from hardly a month ago when he’d just finished exams.
“I know!” Harry snapped harshly. Startled, Draco stopped abruptly. The look in Harry’s emerald eyes was far from furious, but their fire reminded Draco of when they were fourteen, always at each other’s throats. A small part of Draco thought anger was somehow an alluring look on Harry, but he mostly felt annoyed. Harry Potter might have been the Chosen One, but he lived in fantasy land if he thought he was the perfect fighter.
Childhood came back to the seven young adults in a flurry, their joyful screams echoing through the winter afternoon. For a few minutes, Harry completely forgot about all the teenage drama and the threat of new enemies - and judging by Draco’s rare grin, he felt the same way.
“I want what everyone wants,” The attacker said in a cryptic, honeyed voice. “Freedom.” They slashed their open palm towards Joey’s floating body, shouting, “
, Draco,” Potter said fiercely, “And if not theirs quite yet, then mine. It might sound crazy, but I have your back now. I care about y-”
Joey’s eyes were used to the dark, but she couldn’t discern tree from shadow more than a hundred feet away. “Latifah?” She called as loudly as she dared, not wanting to wake her aunts sleeping in the other house.
“Could be an Animagus,” Harry murmured warningly, but the cat seemed utterly disinterested in the three wizards and disappeared from sight.
“She has a point,” Draco put in, and Ginny blinked at him, surprised they’d agree on something. “When I was...well, popular, I had lots of friends. Not many close ones, but it was still useful to have multiple people to talk to for all my problems.”
The swelter sent the Muggles swarming to the lower decks, which had shaded porches and a tiny ice cream parlor. Harry wandered aimlessly, checking in on Joey, who seemed reluctant to do much of anything, and Draco, who was determined to “get through at least one skin routine, it’s been ages.”
“Er…Sorry, Professor. I thought one might be the password. We wanted to talk to you as soon as possible,” Harry explained.
Too soon, in Harry’s opinion, they broke apart. His hands had found their way to Draco’s neck, and he let them linger, a nervous heartbeat fluttering beneath his palms.
Draco’s breathing grew shallow. For all of his adult life, working in the porn industry, he’d been advanced upon more times than he could count. Handsy actresses, sleazy video directors, even his own father to some degree - they’d comb their greedy fingers through his hair, grope him when they thought he was asleep, give him sloppy kisses on the cheek that he hadn’t asked for. And yet, here was Harry Potter, named the “king of sex” by Vanity Fair, asking for permission. Draco had never gotten turned on so easily by mere words before.
“We can talk to Danjuma,” Harry said, referring to the head of the Auror department, “Convince her to lessen the twenty years to-”
Draco chuckles a little, almost to himself, but it’s more derisive than gleeful. “Better. We’ll leave it at that.”
Three little brown birds, which Draco recognized as sparrows, swooped overhead, chirping and dancing circles around each other as they headed for the trees. The silhouette of their tiny figures against the bright expanse of the sky suddenly reminded him of something.
As you can probably to tell, I adore writing holiday scenes. I realize I'm spending a lot of time on the Burrow, but home is a place where characters show their true colors - so the reader can understand their motivations better. And of course, plot things!
“It’s okay.” A smile, small, reserved for moments like these. Moments that Harry wishes he could have a million of. “You’re plenty for me.”
“Nothing that’s any of your business,” Draco replied, letting his wet hair partially cover his face. Harry’s gaze drifted to his bottom lip, which was busted open.
Occasionally, Harry takes time to pause and breathe, taking Draco’s face in his hands and asking, “How much do you remember?”
“What I wouldn’t give for Point Me,” Draco muttered. Wordlessly, Harry took one side of the map, standing beside him, and as they conferred, Joey looked around.
It was hard for Draco to feel uneasy after eating a bowl of the most delicious soup he’d ever tasted. Warm, translucent broth flavored with hoisin sauce, crunchy basil and bean sprouts, and a dash of lime juice surrounded thin, translucent noodles. Draco knew he shouldn’t be letting his guard down, but beneath the fluorescent lights, the hum of the restaurant’s refrigerator, and a full stomach didn’t make him alert - he wanted to take a nap.
Draco stopped at a room at the end of the final hallway, opened the door, and peeked inside. He hesitated at the threshold, not pushing the door open more than a crack. “Aren’t we going in?” Harry asked. The Slytherin shifted from foot to foot uncomfortably.
“Come on,” said Joey, and no one argued. The Patronus moved at a steady pace down a wide street, passing through moving cars and motorcycles as if it were made of smoke. No other pedestrians paid attention to the massive silver elephant - Draco, Harry, and Joey followed it closely, weaving through the crowd as fast as possible without drawing attention to themselves. Luckily, the Patronus took its time, occasionally glancing around its broad shoulder to ensure that the Aurors were coming.
He seems to be studying Harry, and not in the way most girls eye his body, but much like Hermione pores over a textbook. His eyes rest on the scar on his forehead before flicking back to attention.
“I can still be your friend, Harry. I think I can allow myself that much. But until I properly, really make amends…”
“That’d be nice,” Henrietta said wistfully. The hostess caught her attention, and she paused the conversation to point out the table her classmates sat at. “See you later,” Henrietta nodded to Harry and Draco before skirting away.
“I think it’s realistic,” Hermione said reasonably. “We’ve been through a lot; there’s no use in denying it. But in the end, we have each other. We do our best with what we’ve been left with.” She looked up at the candles floating above their heads. “‘Ash spun to silk.’”
“Just because I’m bi doesn’t mean I throw myself at every man I see. I adore Luna, if you must know.”
He saw her now, barreling towards him, arm outstretched. But Harry was closer; he would make it. He had to.
This thought gave Joey pause. Even after residing in Cambridge for six months, she’d never really considered it home. Home was the sisterhood. Home was she and her best friend sharing muffins on a cold New York morning. But now she had Draco and his careful brilliance, Harry and his protectiveness, their twin shares of stubborn loyalty.
Fork freezing over a barely eaten pile of mashed potatoes. Green eyes widening. He turned to the voice.
Draco only nodded, shoving his hands into his robe pockets, not something he did very often: a clear sign that he didn’t want to talk.
They arrive back at Draco’s just as morning begins to trundle along in full swing, the streets filling with commuters and parents taking their kids to school. The noise of cars replaces the sound of the cassette tape as Harry takes it out of the console, then rests a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Hey. We’re here.”
This was news to Harry, who did a poor job of disguising the shock on his face. Draco scowled. “Anyway, that’s not important. The Minister would be the last person I’d tell.”
“Yeah.” Harry exchanged a look with Draco, knowing he felt the same way he did: safe, among people who hopefully wouldn’t judge them for secrets yet to be revealed. “I think we will.”
It would have been easier for Harry to push Draco away and leave him to his own devices. Perhaps, Harry wondered, he’d be better off doing so, as Draco would forever be a living reminder of the enemies that made his childhood a traumatizing quest against evil. But Harry knew that mercy was an option. There was always mercy and hope and forgiveness. “It’s okay,” Harry whispered, refusing to let go. “I’ve got you.”
“Five!” Harry shouted. His fire, like Draco’s own, had gathered into a spinning wheel, roaring with loud but harmless flames sputtering slightly in the rain. “Four! Three!” He flung his fire forward, aiming right for the dueling pair. “Two! One!”
Sunlight receded slowly from the space between them. Twilight was on its way. Draco watched the shadows on Harry’s face; he slid his hand over his jaw, rough and unshaven.
“Voldemort,” Harry finished, and Draco shuddered. “You could still do it,” Harry continued quickly, glossing over the tense moment.
“I’ll look closer at this,” Ray said, indicating the poison. Draco could hear it sloshing about. “It may take me a few days. You are all welcome to stay; we have many rooms for visitors. You'll be well-fed and cared for.”
One of them, with great effort, opens his hand, green flames dancing along his fingertips. The pair’s faces are illuminated, the hopelessness and fear reflected in both the emerald eyes and the dark ones. The woman’s face remains stoic, struggling to keep her panic under control. Helpless tears soon streak down the man’s face, and he lets out an involuntary sob, extinguishing the fire.
At Lockhart, the receptionist, Luna Lovegood, beams up at Harry. Today, her earrings are made of painted clay mushrooms. “Hello, Mr. Potter. How are you this morning?”
Without thinking, Harry raises a hand, and his fingertips brush Draco’s forehead as he pushes the hair back into place. The silence that follows between them is louder than the crowd. Draco’s eyes flash in anger, then surprise, then his lips part.
Throughout this treacherous train of thought, Malfoy had subtly shifted so his right thigh pressed slightly between Harry’s legs, and the Slytherin smirked. “Seems like you’re into the idea, Potter.”
,” and Harry felt a bit of his heart melt just at that, at the breathiness of his voice, and his tongue slipping between his lips.
“I cannot understand Irish people,” Draco tutted as they followed Charon out of earshot. “What the bloody hell is a wain?”
When the candlelit lanterns disappeared, the stars came out, glimmering warmly above the fog. Eyes cast to the heavens, hearts full, hands supporting, the students of Hogwarts found peace in one another for the first time in a year.
That was different. Harry crossed his arms over his chest in an apprehensive gesture. It almost sounded like Draco had betrayed his father in some way.
Their evening practices did help a little. Professor Dahlia had been pushing the class harder than ever in nonverbal dueling, and except for Draco and Hermione, no one met her standards. So Draco had taken it upon himself to help Harry improve on his combat magic. They’d spent hours in the Room of Requirement doing their homework all week, sparring, then, if they weren’t too tired, talking. Draco could tell Harry wanted to use the time together to get Draco to open up: about what exactly, he wasn’t sure. His life outside their happy, hidden bubble, his time as a Death Eater, maybe even his childhood.
“Ah. Well, nice to…” Harry stops. The bartender places his glass on the counter with a glance and vanishes again. “Not meet you, but…you know.”
Draco slipped into the gap between Harry and the Ravenclaw girl. His thin frame fit comfortably, but his thigh still pressed up against Harry’s, making the Gryffindor blush.
“Shut up,” Harry snapped. Finally, he would get to see Malfoy writhing and helpless before him, with gratuitous fucking on the side. Harry had been wanting to have sex with someone, male or not, for quite a while - he was a horny teenager, after all.
Harry dropped his wand, buried his face in his grimy, blood-flecked hand, and sobbed. Draco sighed, lost for words of solace, of reassurance. He only followed Dahlia’s gaze and let his own helplessness join the rain as it slipped down his cheeks.
“Then I will take my leave.” Connors waved her wand, and the protective bubble dissolved. The rain came hard and fast, drops pattering down upon their shoulders. The ground would be turning to mud out there, Draco realized, and he wished for an Anti-Slip Charm to cast on his shoes, but no such thing existed. He heard Harry mutter the spell he used to make his glasses water-repellent. “Good luck, Aurors.” Connors turned with a sweep of gray robes and ran into the clearing to aid her fellow wizards.
“Muggles don’t like them, either,” Hermione continued. “I think I might write my extended essay on LGBT history. For Muggle Studies.”
“Stop punishing yourself. Look,” Harry turned to face him, and Draco thought he was going to take his hands, but he only reached out with his words. “If you really want to break up with me, it should be because you don’t love me anymore. Not because you’re pushing me away for the sake of it.”
“So you use a ‘business’ language, eh?” Caroline asked wryly, brow crinkling. She sat heavily into the armchair behind her desk. “Make your poor auntie stumble through her words.”
“You’re right, I am your leader. And as such, I’m going to ask you both a question. Who would work together better, me and one of you, or you two?”
is right,” Rabbit corrected. Harry tried to move closer, wand still raised, but they swiftly stepped to the side, blocking themself again with the fountain.
“It goes without saying that you two will be doing this mission without Malfoy.” Antigone finally looked over at the man in the corner, who was balancing the handle tip of his wand on his pointer finger. “Auror Carraway will take it from here.”
“Don’t you remember what Sirius told us? Once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. Still applies when You-Know-Who died. And he still has the Dark Mark.”
Harry was about to agree when he spotted a flash of ruby red across the arena. In a terrifying instant, the Chosen One remembered the animal-masked attackers from only a month before. The color red hadn’t bothered him until now, but seeing it here, outside, where Death Eaters had once stood and where other dangers still lurked…At that moment, Harry felt his underlying trauma rise to the surface and hold him in its cruel, senseless clutches.
“Resistance comes in the small acts,” Narcissa murmured, still looking at Lucius. “You are no hero, Draco.” The words were accurate, but they stung. “But you can still choose to be.”
” He said, pointing his wand at the leaves, and they promptly minced themselves. Draco carefully poured the mint into the vial of potion, then hastily shook it. The liquid changed from a smooth caramel color to bubblegum pink. Draco eyed it nervously, but it’d have to do.
Draco scarcely had time to nod before Harry began to thrust, right away, at a frightening pace, his hands wrapped around Draco’s waist. Tight and loose, filled and open, one after the other, prostate hit over and over - “Fuck!” Draco gasped, his fingers trembling against the glass. He leaned forward, pressing his hips back to match Harry’s rhythm, back and forth, merciless, unyielding.
Draco stepped into the semidarkness of the prison cell. The foul scent of stale breath, dried urine, and unwashed hair made his eyes water, but Draco schooled his expression, forcing himself not to wrinkle his nose. If his mother, a proud and classy witch of the house of Black, could stand being in here for years, then by Merlin, he could handle it for a few minutes.
“Anymore.” Joey forced the word into the empty space, turning to face him, and Harry cringed at its presence. “He’s not part of a terrorist group
Cosmic music is too magical a concept for Harry to accept, but he humors Draco’s words for a moment, watching the heavens like a rapt audience member. For a moment, he fools himself, and imagines a stringed symphony playing in a silver-fretted chamber.
Draco pressed his hands to his face, covering his eyes. Then he peeked through his fingers. Then he shook his head. “Oh, my god.”
“We didn’t go as far as Thailand,” Hermione said, then gave their teacher a curious look. “How did you know about the Horcruxes?”
“Oh, my God.” It’s the silky tenor that startles Harry, carrying the unmistakable inflection of south England. “Harry Potter?”
“Piss off,” said Harry automatically, but the gears of his brain were turning over an altogether different idea.
Draco sinks into the bubbles. He lives in a five-story house, lavishly decorated, complete with a room that’s all his own to play in. He has two parents who only want the best for him: the best education, the best adulthood they can prepare for. “
The fog had thinned out somewhat, but gray clouds signaling a coming rainstorm gathered in the heavens. Harry could at least see the castle ahead, a dark, blurry form. He longed to call for Draco to join him and the others as they walked, but he trusted him to approach Harry when he was ready.
On a whim, Harry slipped his hand beneath Draco’s shirt and rested it on his waist, pulling him closer. As they broke apart, Harry let his hand linger, fingers tingling at the feel of warm skin.
” Draco wailed, hyperventilating with the effort of trying to stop the tears that spilled down his pale cheeks. “I ch-checked it, and there it was,
"She knows what you mean," Hermione reassured him, but even she looked unconvinced. "Harry, why don't you…" She tilted her head towards the direction of the stairs.
Draco’s hands continued to apply dittany where needed while his mind tried to process what he saw. Joey had never struck him as particularly manly in the months he’d known her. He’d met girls with chests just as flat, with broader shoulders. But he was pretty sure he’d never met a girl who literally did not have breasts.
“In a minute.” Hermione scrawled a conclusion, then tossed her thick hair out of her face. “All right, give it here.”
“We need to descend,” Harry said presently, and before Draco could figure out how to do that, another force tugged the dragon, and them, out of his wand’s control. The scaly mass landed lightly upon the ground, and Harry and Draco slipped off, weapons up in preparation.
Pansy turns the knob, and the monitor hums with increased power. “Gotcha!” Justin exclaims triumphantly. The screen shows a multilayered diagram of a brain, covered in green splotches; as he taps a key, one of them turns red. “One down, about a gazillion to go.”
The conversation’s buzz rose to the loudest volume yet: the Chosen One, his ex-criminal beau, and the mysterious new girl. A powerful trio, maybe, but exactly how well would they work together?
The woman smiled. The light pulsed even harder, throwing her face, pale and sculpted, into shadowed relief.
Harry told his boyfriend what Ginny had heard. Draco’s brows knitted together, and his face sank into his hand as he listened.
Joey only nodded in response. She’d warmed up to Harry and Draco well enough over the past few weeks, but their school friends were another matter. Ron, in particular, seemed to sense this and said:
Harry tuned out the spiel he’d heard and given many times before. He looked up to the bleachers, where a small crowd of fans had gathered. Sitting apart from them, Draco appeared as an all-black figure with a shock of blond hair and a stripe of green about his throat. Harry knew precisely how meticulously the scarf was tied, and somehow felt pleased to be aware of that detail.
Latifah’s neck arched gently over the sand as she lay back. Joey stole a glance at her friend, a content smile curving her lips.
With a deliberately dramatic sweep of his coat, Malfoy stormed away to the dorms. As soon as he left, Harry crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow at his best friend.
A ray of sunlight, reflecting off a bit of metal, drew Harry’s eye to a statue. The stone figure, its arms outstretched, appeared to be Jesus Christ. The sight made him realize just how rich in history this city must be; he knew Hermione would have loved to be here, on the other side of the world, exploring different cultures and histories. Harry wished he could be sure when he would see her, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Max, and Amélie…They all felt a lifetime away.
“That’s stupid.” Harry sighed and tilted his head, trying to stretch out the knot that had formed in his shoulder.
“In our native Thailand, we have a similar ruthless government. But they need no twisted leader to make them evil. They burn entire villages to the ground, murder children, and rape pureblood women in the name of preserving wizardkind.” The venom in her voice was unmistakable. “My people are tired of witnessing this injustice, so we come from across the sea for assistance. What say you, vanquisher of the Dark Lord? Will you help us?”
“I will,” Harry gave his friend another hug before he and Draco pulled up the hoods of their cloaks. “’Bye, Hagrid.”
“Careful there, sweetheart,” Draco muttered as his boyfriend steadied himself, and though Harry knew the endearment was said sarcastically, he smiled beneath his hood.
“A what…!” Draco’s hand, grasping in Harry’s, lifted, turning him in place. Surprisingly, Harry managed not to make a complete fool of himself. As he finished the spin, he nearly stumbled, but Draco steadied him, laughing.
“All right, mate?” Hands land roughly on his shoulders. Piercing blue eyes, a shock of red hair, a thin face split by a wide grin.
“Alright, make sure you’re ten steps away from your partner,” Dahlia instructed. “For the next couple of days, I’ll be teaching you spells that change your opponent’s spatial and temporal perceptions to disadvantage them. These particular hexes are pretty benign, as hexes go, but they’re relatively obscure and hard to perform, so you can bet that outside of a classroom setting, your opponent won’t be expecting them. The first one we’ll try is called the Deceleration Hex. Say the incantation without wands first:
“Can I come over to yours?” Draco murmurs, silver eyes half closed. “To sleep?” And there it is again, but only now does Harry register it, the blatant advance that borders on romantic. Yet there is no love, no lust, that blossoms between them. If Draco had been a woman, Harry would have kissed her beneath the light of the stars. But Draco’s a man, unusual though he may be, and Harry seizes this friendly question with all the strength he can muster. He wants to know him.
The Burrow, snug after the midwinter chill, was comfortably quiet when Harry walked in. The house’s magically supported timbers sighed and creaked with every slight gust of wind. A dying fire glowed amber in the living room’s grate, a weary equivalent to the lively bonfire outside. Harry hung his coat up on the many-armed rack nearby, unwinding his scarf and slipping off his borrowed leather gloves before heading upstairs.
Malfoy gritted his teeth, his frustration turning Harry on even more. “Fuck me faster,” He demanded. Harry only slowed in response, succeeding in making an angry blush creep up Malfoy’s neck. “Fine!” Malfoy shouted, “Faster, please, I’m begging you, Potter-”
Dahlia grinned impishly. “Albus Dumbledore’s portrait told me after my interview. While I’ve got you here, Harry, do you know Draco’s whereabouts?”
“Water.” Harry tossed her a plastic bottle full, procured from his bag - Joey just barely caught it. “And Draco’s got a strengthening potion…” He took out a glass flask of purplish liquid, then hesitated as Draco glared at him, “Which I will not throw, of course,” He added sheepishly. Harry handed the potion to Joey, who took a small sip. Immediately, relief spread through her muscles, tingling from her limbs to her chest. The world seemed to come into focus, though she still felt a weight in her stomach, as if she’d swallowed a ball of steel.
Before long, rice bowls, topped with meat in Joey’s and Harry’s case, were handed out to the young Aurors. Charon declined nourishment, taking a swig from a flask within his dark robes, leaving behind the faint scent of amaretto.
Many nights of peaceful, dreamless sleep had blessed Harry lately; he could hardly believe his luck. So, naturally, it had to end with a loud bang and the acrid scent of smoke.
“Let’s go look.” Harry slipped his hand into Draco’s, tugging him to the back door. “You can show me all your old hiding places.”
“So?” Harry’s hands drifted towards Draco’s waist, so close he could feel the heat from his palms, but he didn’t make contact. “I won’t even touch you unless you agree.”
Dinner was served with great pomp, three deliberately healthy courses that leaned heavily on protein and vegetables and skipped dessert entirely. Nothing but the best for England’s magical defenders. Next came the mingling, the conversation between fighters, healers, and friends, all apprehensive for their teacher’s speeches to come.
Harry yearned to take Draco’s hands. Instead, he tried to reach him with his eyes as he spoke sincerely. “Keeping us a secret…it hurts. Doesn’t it?”
Something warm was draped across Joey’s waist. The blanket, thin but sufficient, moved as her bedmate tried to shake her awake.
“My Death Eater crimes are stacked against me, Potter. The only reason I’m not in there now is that I agreed to spend another year at Hogwarts. After that…I don’t know. Parole, if I’m lucky.”
“Hey, Ron,” Harry said casually, though adrenaline zoomed through his veins. “Yeah, I’m fine. Yep. Must’ve, er, fallen asleep. Ginny pushed us hard today.”
“Someone we already know…?” Hermione raised an eyebrow and looked pointedly at the Slytherin. He remained quiet so far, to Ron’s surprise, and did not wear his usual mask of arrogance and malice.
White-hot pain seared from his scar to his calves, squeezing and tearing at flesh, his tendons feeling as if they were about to snap, his bones splintering. He must have been screaming, he must have been screaming bloody murder, but all he knew was the excruciating feeling of being torn apart from the inside out. No blood oozed, but Harry could feel his veins rushing with adrenaline, every cell pulsing with agony…
“I reckon Mum wants us to help with dinner,” George said, and the other Weasley children mumbled in reluctant agreement. Brushing the snow off their clothes, the Hogwarts students headed inside.
“Oh. Er…” Harry pondered, caught off guard by such a standard, almost menial question. He supposed his favorite color used to be red, but recent events had lowered its status. “Ice blue, I suppose.”
Joey could deduce enough from what he and Harry had told her on the ship to know he referred to himself. Unable to think of an appropriate reply, Joey pursed her lips and stared ahead.
is told chiefly through Harry Potter’s perspective, so I had to take Draco Narcissa Malfoy, once a post-preppy femme and now a rainbow-haired, indecisive extraordinaire, and view him through rose-colored glasses. Combine that with the late 2000s small town setting, and the story became a bit of a challenge, at least compared to the southeast Asian, gore-lined Auror quest fic I’d been (and still am!) working on.
Harry watches the fork go round and round in circles. He doodled Draco, the food, the salt and pepper shakers, in his journal later that night, along with an entry.
“All right, then!” Dahlia waved her wand, sliding her desk back into place. “Since we’re finishing up our Patronus lesson today, I thought it might be interesting to-”
"Thanks, 'Mione." Harry reached for the letter and carefully opened it, pulling out the sheets of parchment inside.
Luna Lovegood. Two years ago, she was nothing but an angel, unattainable, in the arms of another. Justin counts himself lucky every damn day to be with her now.
Hoping the situation would go in one direction, but trying to stay professional, just in case, Draco stammered, “I - that was a complete accident, I assure you, I had n-no intention of-”
“What?” Harry’s jaw dropped, his eyes widening. “No way. I can’t believe this!” He ran both hands through his messy hair in mock-distress. Draco arched an eyebrow, trying to look stern, but the unconcealable grin ruined the effect. “You? A
Hermione and Ron immediately found a station, as did Dean, Seamus, Padma, and Parvati. Harry caught Malfoy's eye and gave him a questioning look. Glancing around and finding that they were the only pair left, Draco shrugged and crossed the room towards him.
“If I’d known you were this eager to shag me, I would have asked a lot sooner,” Malfoy remarked, shrugging off his outer robes and tossing them in a corner as Harry did the same.
“See you.” Harry sped off towards the dungeons, slowing slightly on the slimy steps so as not to slip. He took careful note of the number of chimes, hoping to make it to class before the ninth. Professor Slughorn gave out tardy-related detentions as unpredictably as his mood changed.
Golden threads of sunlight pull Harry’s limbs from earth. For a moment, he’s weightless, in wind that carelessly tosses spring and summer as if they were interchangeable. Then he finds purchase on shifting ground.
"When we're alone," Hermione admitted. Ron planted a kiss on her cheek, and she giggled. "Oh, you little flirt."
“That’s fine,” Harry said, but he was barely listening. He stopped his pacing to gaze through an enchanted window that showed the grounds above the lake. Outside, freezing sleet poured down in unforgiving sheets. Doubtless, the strange, masked wizards wouldn’t attack in this weather. They must have retreated. Or maybe they were close, biding their time…Harry strained to peer through the heavy precipitation for a bit of red, but he couldn’t see a thing.
An abject cloud of misery hung over nearly every person she saw, plodding along in worn-out robes, most hands empty of wands. Their faces were gaunt, eyes yellowed and continually moving, searching for any sign of danger. Only the children, sparse in their numbers, seemed to hold hope, their gazes upright, wondering at the life above.
“All right, we deserved that,” Ron said, raising his hands in surrender when he realized Harry was at least half-joking. “Bottom line is…I’m really sorry, mate. We should have treated you better.”
Lucius raised his head and opened his steel-gray eyes. Every muscle fiber in Draco’s body tensed, anticipating a blow out of instinct. He took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down.
Next to him, Draco squints into the shadows. A smear of gold glitter paints his cheek - Harry resists the urge to rub it off. It’s hard to tell if he’s put it there on purpose.
Even a few weeks earlier, Harry hadn’t been sure if Draco could have come back here so soon. To the vast dining table where Nagini slithered across, the kitchen where Lucius had thrown glasses at Narcissa. To the bedroom that became Draco’s only safe haven during the war, where he secretly collected news about the Chosen One, hoping with all his might that he would end the terror once and for all. Draco had told Harry everything about those months, and the years before, about the childhood filled with screams and running through the garden and bubble baths and slaps and family banquets. They’d spent a week at the Weasley’s after Ron’s proposal, plenty of time for Harry to learn about Draco’s past, and love him all the more for it.
“I’m transgender,” Joey said with difficulty, and it was difficult because no matter how much she knew it was true, she’d grown accustomed to what came next. The confusion, the outright horror that accompanied that word when other people heard it, the names and poisonous labels. Her eyes had dipped to the table despite her best efforts. “I had every right not to tell you, but... I’m telling you now.”
The hours-long drive is tense and silent. Pansy watches the town, then the dark countryside pass by. Draco’s eyes are fixed on the road. Pansy manages to retrieve a page, torn at an edge, covered in someone else’s scrawl, with a sketch of two people lying down, holding hands, gazing at the heavens.
An interruption swooped over them in the form of a flock of owls. A small, tawny one landed in front of Hermione. The
Joey’s back ached from sitting for so long; bracing herself against a few heavy bags of rice, she stood to survey their surroundings.
He voices Harry’s own thoughts of doubt. Harry shakes off the words, but he doesn’t let go of Draco. He won’t let himself be taken away from him, not matter how much Draco’s cynicism stings of truth.
Once he’s done, Draco beams proudly and slides the parchment to his tutor, who looks over the labels. He sighs, pinches his nose. “Okay. Let’s go over this
“Ray Chulanont. Faraday sent you, no? We must go immediately.” Draco instinctively trusted Ray; he had that sort of voice, accented, deep, and soothing. His eyes were the color of dark chocolate, melting through Draco with a glance.
“Mhm.” Ginny smelled of blossoms and sweat - similar to Draco, Harry realized, and he figured he must have a type. For a fleeting moment, Harry wondered if she still had feelings for him, even if she didn’t realize it. But Ginny’s touch held no sensuality; she was only helping out a friend. Perhaps last summer, Harry would have found this disappointing, but it pleased him to find that he didn’t care anymore.
Harry licked his lips and smirked. “Yes, sir.” And all of a sudden, he pulled pants and trousers down in one fluid motion, bending over Draco’s crotch.
“I see you’re having trouble sleeping as well, Potter,” Malfoy said at the sound of Harry’s barefoot footsteps.
Draco’s mouth fell open, and he looked incredulously at Harry, who felt his face warming from more than just the fire.
Joey, Draco, and Harry - still sore about being useless for the entire fight - sat huddled in fresh clothes around a cooking fire. A girl, no more than sixteen, stirred a pot of creamy, white fish curry over the flames. She’d introduced herself as Chanlina and let them in when she saw they’d gotten rid of the spirit.
The crowded streets of Hogsmeade provided cover for Harry’s and Draco’s entwined hands. They moved, invisibly connected, through the oblivious groups of students, a handful of teachers, and the occasional hag or goblin. Padma and Gavin didn’t seem to be around - neither, Harry noticed, relieved, were Hermione and Ron. Though he supposed the chances of running into them at the Three Broomsticks were high enough.
“Nope.” Harry sat up, stretching languidly. “We’ve got to start planning while the information’s fresh.”
Professor Dahlia nodded, tucking a lock of blue hair behind her ear. “Coolio. Also, not to impose on your language, but ‘lesbian’ is an adjective, not a noun. Why do you ask?”
“I dunno if he was attractive or not. We were both blokes.” Ron took a long sip of his butterbeer and put his arm around Hermione’s shoulders. “Anyways, ‘Mione, we’re all dying to know how far along you are on your essay.”
Blooms of heather and fields of herbs sprawled across a hidden landscape. His hands caressed Draco’s tearstained cheeks, lips moving next to his ear, forming words for the first time:
Draco smiled then, the second real smile he had shown that day. Harry meant to glance down at that entrancing smile but discovered that he continued staring at the other’s lips long after the smile had faded.
It’s a sense of honor, and not loneliness, Draco tells himself firmly, that causes him to Apparate invisibly to the site of Fred Weasley’s funeral. Amidst the sea of redheads, he spots Potter’s untidy black hair immediately. Taking care not to bump into anyone, Draco walks about the edges of the crowd and waits for everyone to get settled. Potter, per Draco’s instructions, sits near the back, next to the oaf, Hagrid.
Missing from what? Us? Pansy wants to interject, but she holds her tongue, letting the silence seep into the seats, spill across the windshield. Her knees are curled to her chest; her head rests against the window. She hasn’t been entirely honest, so how can she expect Draco to be?
The same, tiny, tufty-haired wizard that had presided over Dumbledore's funeral rose and took his place at the podium. Next to him, there was a plain wood casket covered in bunches of forget-me-nots. Harry stared at the coffin, wishing with all his heart that it was the last dead body he would be near in his life.
“Uh…hi.” Pansy frowns as he turns away, running a shaking hand through his pink hair, leaving her to close the door. “Jeez. What’s up with you?”
"Honestly, I'm starting to think that Draco is serious about turning over a new leaf," Hermione shrugged and slid her wand into her robes. "I say we give him a chance." Before Ron could object, she continued, "We ought to hurry. We have Potions first class, and I think Professor Slughorn's favoritism towards Harry will have worn off by now."
using any kind of derogatory slur, I promise you that you’ll spend the rest of your afternoons this year scrubbing toilets.” Professor Dahlia’s stern, McGonagall-like gaze swept over her class, briefly resting on Pansy, who looked more angry than embarrassed. “Is that clear?”
Draco’s hand reaches absentmindedly for Harry’s – whether to push it off or hold it is unclear, and he comes to full consciousness before Harry can tell. “Oh…hi.” Draco pulls his hand away and blinks in the sun. “Christ, I’m tired,” He mutters, stretching, and the green jacket slides off his chest. “Do you have work today?”
Draco made himself lie in one of the room’s beds when the time drew close to midnight. Sleep was a long time coming, but it found him eventually. And so did England, easing into his mind through tendrils of fog.
After a moment’s hesitation, Harry reached forward and took his hand. Draco’s fingers gripped Harry like a lifeline, and his shallow breathing deepened slightly.
Laden with merchandise, the group headed for the Three Broomsticks, which was so packed that the crowd spilled out the back door and into the adjoining alley. Madam Rosmerta and her employees had worked double-time to accommodate, transforming the cracked cobblestones into a soft carpet of grass and duplicating tables so people could sit outside. The eight students were seated immediately by a young waiter who seemed as if he’d just been hired and looked astonished upon seeing The Chosen One. Draco wondered if he’d read the
“Sounds interesting,” Harry said truthfully. Both of them had been staring absently at the chocolate squid, which caused it to show off by making various shapes with its pale brown tentacles.
Rows of chairs, scarcely enough for two dozen attendees, stood on either side of the lilac-lined aisle. Draco stiffened when he noticed a group of people staring at him. It took him a moment to realize, with a shock, that they were Muggles - bewildered at the sight of his dark green dress robes, no doubt. Draco ignored them, taking a seat in the second row on Ron’s side.
Joey seemed to soften. “We’re going to need your potions for backup, Draco. I know you have ideas for what to bring, so let’s hear them.”
Harry seemed too flabbergasted to speak. He flipped his chair around and sat, so he was facing Joey. Feeling as if she’d laid all her cards on the table, Joey waited.
“Commander Connors?” Draco panted disbelievingly. He arrived just as Connors slashed through the ropes binding Harry. The cut on his forehead was bleeding; Draco was sure it hadn’t been before.
“Not to me.” Draco sounded firm, and Harry was about to argue until he said, “But fine. I trust you. What’s the plan, then?”
An electronic beep sounds, and Harry is transported to a street in downtown Ashfell, to a business so tiny and unassuming that it’s no surprise he’s never seen it before. Lockhart Inc, in gold letters, shines in the middle of the upper window. The manila card in his pocket, Harry walks inside.
“Harry, Ron, Hermione, so nice to see you all,” She said, beaming, then her gaze fell upon Draco. Though the Slytherin had surreptitiously tried to hide his face in his scarf, but the trademark Malfoy silver eyes and platinum blond hair were unmistakable. “And you’ve brought a Death Eater into my establishment.” Madam Rosmerta stated, eyes narrowing.
Antigone raised a prominent eyebrow and chuckled. “At ease, Auror, this isn’t the Queen’s military,” She told him, and Harry sat, a bit flushed. “And you, Auror Malfoy?” She asked Draco, who bowed his head politely.
A warm brown gaze looks up, unsure, untrusting. The bedsprings whine, yet its occupants are near silent. Harry fucks her without feeling, without seeing. He tells himself he loves her.
“Ah, the tattoo thing.” Draco withdrew slightly, his piercing eyes meeting Harry’s. “Yes. I’m trying to catch up on all your little inside jokes.”
Fuck, it…” He groaned and screwed his eyes shut. “Can…can you…” His uninjured hand opened. An invitation. “Please. It’ll -
“Copperhead,” Draco said at the stone door, which slid open with a muted grating noise. The sound of music, laughter, and chatter immediately drifted out, and the two young wizards exchanged a look. “Party time,” Draco said tepidly, and they walked into the vibrant common room.
It’s ridiculous, an impossibility, but Harry knows his own voice, his doubts - he recognizes the sighs of impatience and regret, the pauses where he wonders how something that felt so right had gone so wrong. It’s close to how he felt about Ginny. Unnervingly close.
. I believe the fic’s universe, a mixture of JKR’s imagination and mine, speaks for itself. That’s something I’m allowing myself to be proud of.
“I know this information, Joanne,” Caroline said wearily. “I have examined all my Aurors’ files in great extent.”
Harry squinted into the darkness, back pressed against the wall. A figure melted from the shadows, shoulders draped with a plum-colored cloak. The stranger raised a wand, shouting a gleeful incantation, and the fountain came to life, its stone tiers flowing with a liquid thicker than water. Harry held his sleeve in front of his nose as the coppery scent of blood filled the air.
Draco pursed his lips, then immediately regretted it, getting a mouthful of dust. He spat on the ground and began to clean off with a charm, the slow, methodical magic calming his racing heart. “Are you sure?”
“Gone for weeks,” Ron said, shaking his head, thumping Harry on the back, “Not a single goddamn letter!”
“Yeah, sure.” Harry grabbed a too-small knit sweater from inside his trunk and tossed it to his best friend.
“Here.” Harry placed a plate laden with an over-easy egg upon fried toast in front of him. Just the way Draco liked it.
Suddenly, the shouts are drowned out by a roaring, crackling noise. Both Weasley and Crabbe run down the aisle to their comrades, a fiery orange glow emerging behind them.
“Draco Malfoy,” Joanne repeated. “You’re in a few of my classes?” Her voice hesitated, tilting between a question and a statement.
A handful of seventh years wove through the hallways with their noses in a book. Not entirely strange, since they were Ravenclaws, but they collectively read identical, massive volumes. Their intense perusing caused multiple student collisions, with more than one bottle of spilled ink staining the flagstones.
Ray smiled graciously, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “Of course. I prepared exactly what you need.” He smoothly reached back, pulling on one of the cabinet drawers, and took out a slim vial of pale yellow potion.
“That good-for-nothing Slytherin,” Ron growled, and it took Harry a second to realize he was talking about Pansy. “Your relationship is not her bloody business.”
“Draco Malfoy. Yes, I remember his case. Suffice to say that Mr. Malfoy was not happy in his current relationship.” Patil says the sentence with a stale empathy, as if she’s said versions of it many times before. “He wanted a way out.”
Draco shook his head, cutting him off. The Slytherin shed his black overcoat and forcefully pulled up his left sleeve, willing the Dark Mark into existence. It glared blackly, and Harry’s eyes widened.
me in weeks.” Draco stands up straight, accusing, stalking towards Harry as steadily as he possibly can. “I told you what I wanted when this all started. I need intimacy. I need
Droplets pelted the flyers as they rose into the air, the flow growing steadily heavier as Madam Hooch raised the whistle to her lips. Harry watched the Snitch disappear into the far reaches of the arena, and with the piercing chirp that signaled the game, he immediately sped after it. The wind whistled sharply in his ears, the blurred colors of scarlet, yellow, and black moving around him as he flew. Adrenaline pulsed through his bloodstream, his heart racing; in the air, Harry felt alive, and free, and untroubled.
Draco, a young Draco that Harry has never seen before, stitched from imagination, nods. “Win this one for me,” He says again.
I'm pretty sure this is the shortest chapter so far. I couldn't resist digging around in Draco's mind at least a little bit; his character has so many layers that can't all be discovered within the span of one fanfiction. I also put a bit of a sinister spin on the Room of Requirement - after all, people have died in there...
will never print,” Hermione remarked, “I did hear about that, though. Finally, some steps in the right direction!”
“We’ll do a practice round first,” Joey said, picking up her cards and fanning them against her hand, out of view of the others. “I’ll explain as we go.”
“You’re welcome, my darlings.” Lily tousles their hair affectionately while Harry’s grandmother nods, smiling. They fade away, perhaps back to the kitchen, but Harry’s childlike mind hardly registers it.
Somewhere between now and 1995, riddled bodies lay abandoned in the mud, the survivors bleeding as they sprinted out of reach. The children that ran were defenseless.
” With a scraping noise, the mug flew back onto the table, undamaged, and the spilled liquid vanished from the rough wooden planks.
“I’ve got him,” She reassured Harry, guiding Draco to sit on the nearest cot. Still, Harry stuck to him like glue, remaining by his side as Madam Pomfrey dashed off, likely for healing potions.
“Thanks for having me along,” The Slytherin said stiffly, gathering up his clothes. Hermione gave Ron a sharp nudge, and the redhead cleared his throat.
Then, Harry realizes that it’s not just him that’s shaking, it’s the entire street, cracks in the pavement, nearby buildings crumbling, trees creaking and groaning before they fall over. “Please, Draco!” He cries urgently. “It’s all falling apart!” This could be my last chance, he thinks desperately. If I can fix this now, then…
Their hands brushed on accident at first. An urge came over Harry, and before he could talk himself out of it, he interlaced Draco’s gloved fingers with his. The Slytherin tensed at the sudden display of affection, but he didn’t pull away until they reached the door.
, always happen. Heartless people with enough power figure that anything they can take is theirs, that anyone different who can be silenced should be silenced. I see it everywhere.” Her jaw clenched. “It makes me sick.”
“I’m sorry, for everything that happened. I feel like we could have been friends, maybe, if I hadn’t…”
Harry lunged forward and pressed his mouth to Malfoy’s and was nearly caught off guard by how quickly and passionately he reacted. Their lips parted after only a moment, allowing their tongues to clash rather sloppily. Despite Malfoy’s height advantage, Harry quickly gained dominance, pinning the Slytherin’s arms up on the wall as he kissed him furiously.
“Simple!” Draco sighed dramatically, brushing one of the swans with one pale finger. “As if it’s easy to transfigure a flower into an animal.”
Harry and Draco both got through much faster. It didn’t take Harry two seconds to figure out why. He would have felt sorry for Joey if he thought she’d want his pity - and, of course, if she hadn’t threatened Draco.
Leaves spun gaily on the shimmering surface of the water, which filled a crystalline bowl to the brim. A couple of white blossoms, pebbles, and small twigs lay on the desk next to the bowl, petals fluttering slightly with every breath taken.
(c. September 2020) I want to take this time to thank everyone who's kept up with WTSC so far. It's been nearly a year since I started publishing! It's harder to work on this fic now that I've started the IB, but I'll do my best :)
noise. “No. My magic is good enough.” Something warm settled on Harry’s shoulder, and he resisted the urge to turn. “Nervous?”
Harry’s demand was louder than necessary, echoing across the white marble floors of the hotel. He and Draco, still dressed in their dirty uniforms and sagging with fatigue, stood out like sore thumbs among the extravagant floral arrangements, glittering chandeliers, and smooth, modern furniture. They’d caught a few fitful hours of sleep after dawn, but Harry couldn’t properly rest until he knew Joey was okay. And neither could Draco.
The silence that accompanies them to Harry’s apartment is a strange one. He blushes every time he meets Draco’s eyes in the rearview, but for the life of him, Harry cannot understand why. It isn’t the first time he’s had people over at his apartment. He’s not a child, for Pete’s sake.
Draco squeezes his hand, and it feels like something between hope and desperation. “I have a few ideas of where we can go.”
“Okay.” Joey uncorked the potion, steadying her breath, thinking of the courtyard at Cambridge Academy.
“Yeah, Quinn’s very talented. Actually, she’s a decent Beater, too, Ginny’s convinced her to try out the position a few times in practice…”
“I forgot,” Harry said apologetically, blushing furiously as he straightened his glasses. “You want to take things slow.”
Two bright-haired students, wearing light robes appropriate for summer, and nervous expressions, sat with two others, whose faces were striped in red paint.
“Hello, Mr. Potter.” Luna smiles dreamily, leaning against the receptionist’s table that has somehow squeezed itself into the small room. “How are you this morning?”
Draco fell silent, but he kept his senses primed as they strolled leisurely around, looking for all the world like a couple of foreign college students on vacation.
Joey had just unwrapped her plastic fork when a scuffle broke out not far down the street. Two people tumbled out onto the sidewalk, apparently thrown from the doorway of their home, and their attackers soon came into view. Robes, the color of fading night, were pulled up to the wizards’ faces, so only their bright and dangerous eyes were visible. One of them pulled up their sleeves, baring dark arms and a thin, ash-colored wand. The people on the ground, adults dressed in Muggle clothes, cowered.
, which sets Harry to wondering, as he rummages in his closet and heads for the bathroom, if Draco is being flirty on purpose. Part of Harry hopes that’s just his personality. Another part is warming up to the idea that Draco could, in fact, be interested in him. It’s nice to be wanted, even if he can’t want him back.
Horace Slughorn sauntered gaily into the Slytherin common room, bright green robes flowing like sea currents around his feet. The students present looked up from their schoolwork, each already guessing what announcement he was about to make and listening attentively.
Harry began to say something, but Draco didn’t hear - a sudden wave of wooziness overcame him, and he swayed, clutching Harry’s shoulder for support. His vision grew dark and fuzzy at the edges, and Draco took several deep breaths as Harry’s concerned voice came back into focus.
Harry did so and ambled cautiously into the room, taking a seat on the edge of the quilt-covered bed. “What are you working on?” He asked amiably.
Anubis blinked slowly. “We did a headcount of the whole city. Each sector was swiftly evacuated before the fighting began.”
“Are you sure you want to stay here, Harry?” Hermione asked as she wrapped herself up in a knitted scarf. “We could meet up at Honeydukes later if you like?”
“What happened?” Harry questioned, sitting next to Draco on his bed. The blond scooted a few inches away from him, keeping his distance.
As she talked, Draco raised his tankard to his lips, shielding his face from the couple across the table. He gave Harry a questioning glance that clearly said,
In the absence of their teacher, Draco slouched slightly on the stool, propping his head in his hand. “I think,” he said dryly, “He’s a few bottles short of a full cabinet.”
“What do you mean?” Draco said, running two hands exasperatedly through his hair, mussing it. (A gesture which Harry for some reason found immensely attractive, but that was beside the point.) “Don’t tell me you didn’t notice the loud, obvious quarrel that you were a part of…”
Harry found it strange, yet refreshing, to hear that from a former rival’s lips. It was refreshing to have Draco’s gratitude passed so quickly to him. So trustingly.
Dahlia’s expression softened. The lines around her mouth smoothed, and her face became blank. Unreadable. “Maybe once,” She admitted, “I was too young to know of love.
He didn’t have any memories of a time he went without magic; even as a toddler, he could do simple things like multiply bath bubbles or create small gusts in the garden. To suppress his magic was to suffocate a part of himself.
“Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” said Draco Malfoy, and the sight of him, the smirk curving his lips, his hand lingering, rendered Harry speechless. He was dressed in nearly all black, save for shiny, silver buttons and his robes’ hem, which slowly turned to gray as the fabric neared the floor. Despite the casual elegance of Draco’s clothes, Harry couldn’t help but notice everything else: the exposed collarbone, the muscles in his neck moving as he talked, the skin of his wrist as the sleeve fell away, and his eyes…Merlin, his
“Is it hard?” The question felt sincere, a genuine inquiry, and from the nervous look on Theodore’s wan face, Draco realized what was going on. “I mean…how did you come out without being a complete disaster?”
Ron vanished from the curtains, casting Harry into darkness. Draco waited until he heard the door close before throwing the hangings aside and removing the Invisibility Cloak.
“Um…” Harry looks Draco directly in the eyes, but there’s not a smidge of recognition. Damn, he’s good. “I…”
“Too early for that,” he said amiably and took Harry’s arm. “Let’s go, then. I’ll teach you how to dance properly.”
“That’s two presents from you and none from me,” Draco said, frowning. “Trying to get me to owe something, Potter?”
“Oh - well, it takes a lot of concentration. We’ve tried it in combat before, but it doesn’t work very well. Still, we’ll improve with practice.”
In the brilliant light of the enchanted scenery beside them, Auror Commander Danjuma explained. Draco’s eyes grew wide at first, and his instincts rebelled. For too long, he’d been a servant to a higher force. He didn’t want to go back to that.
Draco left with more questions than he had started with. Hyacinthe opened the door for the young man, and Draco slipped into the hallway. His head whirled with confusion, wondering…Would his parents really go to Azkaban? If so, when? And what about Draco himself?
A sudden flurry of wings startled them. The dragon had begun to stir, its scales darkening to jet black. The crowd of wizards started to exclaim, standing back and whooping in hesitant delight. Harry dissolved the Muffling Charm; all three Aurors grasped their wands. Joey looked at her partners, each moving at synchronized speeds, Draco’s hand reaching for the sedation potion, and Harry creeping forward towards the dragon.
The muscles in Draco’s jaw worked as he met her gaze. Harry frowned, resting his hand comfortingly on Draco’s thigh beneath the table, and Draco seemed to relax slightly. For the life of him, Harry couldn’t pinpoint why Joey bothered Draco so much. He made a mental note to ask him about it later,
“It’s a chore just being around her,” Henrietta sighed as the party in front of them was led to their seats, and the multitude shifted forward.
“You worry too little,” Draco replied, though there was no real venom in his words. He snatched the parchment from the air and gave it a once over, muttering under his breath. Harry looked up from his book and watched him fret, twirling his wand between his pale fingers as he did when in deep thought.
, darling,” Luna chirped, then leaned forward and kissed Ginny straight on the lips, as naturally as breathing.
Nothing a drop of dittany wouldn’t fix, but Draco hated having any sort of blemish mar his pale skin. He’d grown to accept his Sectumsempra scars, more or less, though he still covered them up when he could. Anything else bothered him to the point of teeth-grinding frustration.
“I shouldn’t,” Draco said softly. He reached up and squeezed Harry’s hands, and it felt too much like a gesture of goodbye for Harry to stand. “You don’t need me.”
Joey chuckled before she could stop herself. “Nothing that hasn’t been going on my whole life, really.” She paused, the incoming words making her feel warm and uncomfortable as if the pub’s lights were heat lamps.
It took Harry less than a second to realize what it meant. “Ron!” He gasped excitedly, and Ron shushed him.
“Stop me if I get something wrong,” Harry told Draco. “During the holidays, Draco received a letter from Narcissa Malfoy…”
The stone walkway turns to smooth tile. A clatter sounds as Draco hurriedly drops the handle of his suitcase. This must be when we went to Philadelphia to visit Dudley, Harry realizes. The train station’s monitors for departures and arrivals flash aberrantly, from white to green to red.
“It’s so cold,” Ginny said, already shivering. “Why don’t we get some brooms out and - oof!” A giant snowball had hit her in the stomach. Across the yard, George put on his best innocent expression and put his snowy gloves behind his back. “Oh, you wanna play that way, huh?” His sister threatened, pulling out her wand.
“I ought to have asked Ginny more often,” He grumbled. “Look, can’t you let us in this once? You know us!”
“Ah, yes,” Draco turned to face Harry and leaned casually on the fence. “Quidditch, and how Slytherin’s going to make a comeback and win the Cup.”
“It was kind of interesting,” Ron admitted. “All right, fine. But if he stops being Nice Malfoy and calls you names, I’ll hex him.”
“Yes,” Ron agreed. “Merlin, what a freak show. Straight to the common room, yeah? Nature’s not particularly agreeable at the moment.” He lowered his gaze, presumably to eye the grass, but came face to face with a beaming person instead.
“Who’s good with children?” Draco asked. “One of you two can do it. I’m a terrible authority figure.”
,” Draco spoke the word like a curse. “It’s been a whole week! There’s no way he hasn’t gotten the letter by now.”
“Anyway, the Aurors stationed here have taken it upon themselves to aid the citizens caught within Sin Pax’s clutches. We had the perfect plan in place until one of our undercover operatives reported that Sin Pax planned to launch an attack on the Muggle world above - which would be a disaster, as you can imagine.
.” Draco’s whisper, next to his ear. Harry saw him in his mind’s eye, hand outstretched, tears pouring down his face. He’d managed a wand from Dao, who’d dropped them in the explosion, but Harry felt energy sapping from Draco as if their bodies were one. A wand wouldn’t help him keep the dementors away. Even after all this time, he couldn’t do it, couldn't cast a Patronus; the sound of shattering glass, ricocheting spells, his father’s knuckles bruising his face was too much to bear. In his desperation, Draco had reached out to pass along a final message.
The precautions were necessary; Harry understood that. But he couldn’t help but feel a stab of regret as Draco parted from them to go to the dungeons, without so much as a friendly wave.
Harry pads over to the couch and kneels. He touches Draco’s face, gently, fingers caressing the curve of his cheek.
“Herbology? Not required for the Academy, but it’s appreciated all the same,” As Dahlia spoke, she sifted through a pile of pamphlets and handed Harry a white, maroon-titled one. “As you know, you won’t be taking N.E.W.T.s this year - they won’t require it. But your end-of-term paper will be looked at more closely as a result.”
“You’re joking, right?” Max asked, tilting his head. “I can never tell when you’re joking. But no, I’m actually surprised that you and Harry aren’t joined at the hip as usual.”
Draco opened his hand, and Harry leaned in to peer at the oddity he had retrieved. A few tiny bones and a miniature skull that looked slightly human lay on top of a broken piece of china. “Fairy bones,” Draco said quietly. “I found nearly a full skeleton in third year. It’s still in good condition, see?” He tilted the plate shard slightly, and Harry gave a start as he looked straight through the skull’s eye sockets, through the hole in the base, to see the smooth porcelain beneath. “I put a Preservation Charm on it.”
Perhaps it was that philosophy that kept Joey from shedding tears for a stranger, no matter how precious her life had been.
“I’m fine.” Draco’s gaze turned to steel. “I’m simply not used to this kind of thing. Unless you don’t want to be seen with me,” He added.
“Sure.” Harry felt a slight twinge of guilt at deceiving his friends, but at least after today, they’d all be in on this particular secret. “Er, Luna, before you go…Is Ginny mad at me?” Ever since she found out about him and Draco, Ginny had been decidedly chilly towards Harry. She was civil enough to him, especially during Quidditch practice, but had seemingly avoided talking to him any more than she had to.
The next morning, the day before Christmas, the Burrow bustled with enough activity to keep everyone busy. Percy, Luna, and Xenophilius Lovegood all arrived to stay for a couple nights - their presence in addition to George Weasley’s meant Draco was forced to move into Ron’s room. Ron himself was not entirely pleased about it but managed to keep his mouth shut for Harry’s benefit. Though Harry was too busy being frustrated with and confused about Draco to care.
Harry must have picked up one of Draco’s unnoticed tells because he placed a hand on his shoulder, squeezing him in comfort. “It won’t be too long. You can do it.” His lips curled into that stupid but gorgeous smile of his. “It’ll be interesting, won’t it? To see how Muggles travel?”
Draco sighed, his ordinarily cool demeanor melting slightly as he pulled his knees to his chest. “I don’t know. I wish I knew.”
Harry frowned as his hands rested on Draco’s torso; he could feel his ribs plainly through the stretched-thin flesh. “Oh, Merlin. You haven’t eaten since Saturday, have you?”
“I’m fine,” Narcissa said airily, and with a muffled grunt, she stood up, swayed slightly on the spot, and walked over to the curtain. Draco followed hurriedly, ready to catch his weakened mother if she stumbled.
The Patronus’s light bathed them in a small pocket of warmth as they moved past the prison cells. Cobblestone and thick metal doors separated them from the victims inside, but Draco could still hear their muffled moans and sobs of despair.
“To be perfectly honest, I think it would’ve been more fun if you were there.” Harry’s head spun, but whether it was from the alcohol or the fact that Draco’s sleeves were rolled up, he hadn’t the foggiest idea.
Draco was so close Harry could see the pale, icy blue that ringed his irises. “You think we’re falling for each other?”
“Take off your mask, so at least I know who I’m speaking to,” said Harry presently, and Draco glanced nervously at him. He wasn’t sure he wanted to see what was underneath.
“Our friends, family, and classmates fought hard against the invasion. Many sacrifices were made, and eventually, Voldemort and his army were vanquished. Tonight, we remember the brave warriors who fought for their families, their friends, their lives. We remember those who perished in battle.
Harry spotted Draco glaring at the notes as he sliced tiramisu. Commander Antigone Connors had given the highly confidential notes to Joey, the mission’s designated leader, and it obviously pained Draco to see them spread tantalizingly in his own home. Draco stabbed the cake a bit too viciously, getting a bit of cocoa powder on his pale hand. Harry wordlessly passed him a napkin.
“So…” Ron glanced around, but they were the only ones in the Gryffindor Tower’s bathroom. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, velvet box.
When he was only a toddler, Draco used to squeal and wriggle his way from the bath as best he could every night. But in his more sophisticated years, he asks himself how he could have ever been so foolish. Cleanliness is close to godliness, Draco remembers, just as his Auntie Dromeda used to tell him.
“Thanks. But I don’t think I’d like being in the thick of it for a career. Probably something in the similar, though. I still want to help people.”
“You want to be an Auror,” said Professor Dahlia as soon as Harry sat before her. It was a statement, not a question, and he nodded for confirmation. “There are lots of people wanting to be Aurors this year,” She continued conversationally. “Minerva said the same influx happened around twenty years ago when You-Know-Who rose to power.” Dahlia retrieved a file from a pile on the desk and flipped through it. Clipped to the corner was a portrait of Harry, taken in sixth year. The boy in the photo gave a forced smile for a moment, but his face fell immediately, eyes troubled with his uncertain future. Harry watched his younger self as Professor Dahlia looked over his latest transcripts.
“We’re allowed to go to any house’s common room before curfew,” Hermione piped up, “So long as we know the password.”
Mapping out the logistics of the mission was one of the most time-consuming things I had to do for this fanfiction, so I figured the characters would have a bit of trouble planning for it. Action is only enjoyable if it makes sense, I believe, so it'll be worth it!
Harry controlled his breathing. He was overreacting. Why would Dahlia be in contact with the Following? If that’s who the envelope was from, which, again, seemed like a coincidence. But she
“Hm, really?” Draco stepped closer. Harry could see every tiny drop clinging to his pale lashes. “Something awful? Like…that I used to be a Death Eater?”
Fate’s hand had succeeded. Draco had no idea why the return of the masked wizards scared him so, but the fear was there, prickling into his heart. He stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Harry, and the nearness of him made Draco feel less alone.
“No!” Harry lurched forward as if he could sprint through the stunned crowd and save them - Charon caught both his arms and forced him back with surprising strength.
“Oh, very well, see you later,” Percy said airily, and after a quick kiss on his mother’s cheek, Apparated away with a
“I could freeze, and that would be all right. This might be where I die, anyway. And what better place than this?” Harry throws up an arm, scooping up starlight. As his hand falls, Draco catches it, leather glove curling.
“I did think it was strange,” Hermione relented, “But I’ve been thinking…maybe we jumped to conclusions. It would be hard for Malfoy to keep the charade up for all this time. Maybe they just genuinely like each other.”
wear them without knowing they carry a spell. Subtle to the wearer, but it keeps them loyal to their leader. Kayala didn’t exploit it much, but I have no doubt Dao does.”
When Harry kicked off into the air for the second time, all his worries flew away in a gust of wind. He scoffed at himself for getting so nervous for tryouts, though he could’ve been worried about seeing Ginny again.
"Oh, Harry," Hermione frowned sympathetically. "C'mon, let's get some breakfast in you. We're all going to need our energy today."
“Malfoy’s not playing, actually. He told me, when we were in the hospital wing, that he quit the team after his injury.”
, Joey thought bitterly, recalling how her father had kicked her out of the house simply for trying to live as her true self.
Harry shook his head. “No way. That’d be a suicide mission.” At “suicide,” Draco’s eyes darted away, and Harry pressed on, “But maybe there’s someone we can tell. Someone who can take more action than we can.”
Mostly-equal parts of character and plot development going on...Harry-Draco interactions are at the forefront, of course, but we also get a glimpse of how Draco's getting along with the others.
Draco muttered something, and Harry tilted his head, listening. Harry whispered Draco’s name, but he did not reply, turning away in his sleep and rolling to the other side of the bed. Harry took that as his cue to leave.
“M’kay. I’ll just go grab some stuff. Wait here.” Draco opens the door, leaves his jacket on the seat.
Do I want to talk about it? His mother’s bright green eyes meeting his in the rearview mirror, white lilies drooping as she joined her husband in the earth, her sister taking him away to raise him as a good little Christian. The smell of burning bacon, the sting of a slap across the face, his cousin’s cruel laughter as the round glasses were crushed underfoot. No. Harry doesn’t particularly want to talk about it.
“If you want me to leave you alone, stop talking to you… Just let me know. I want clear answers, that’s all.” Justin looks as lost as Luna felt that snowy night, kneeled upon the pavement, wracked with the spaces in her memory.
As the small group traipsed off to greenhouse four, Harry was relieved to spot Draco’s gleaming blond hair bobbing in the sea of students’ heads. The Gryffindor found himself walking a bit faster to catch up; Ron and Hermione, holding hands behind him, were more than willing to let him wander off.
Then it’s over, to Harry’s dismay - he has a slap of irony, suddenly, that he’d enjoy kissing another man this much after being friends with class-A homophobes in school - and Draco sits back, cheeks flushed, but otherwise none the worse for wear.
Some Gryffindor nearby, hardly fourteen, added, “Y’know, that makes a lot of sense, actually. He always seems like he’s got something up his arse.” The friends around him laughed.
“Three,” Luna concluded, putting down seven fingers. “And would you say you’re happy? Compared to three years ago?”
Hermione, who, along with Ron had been watching this exchange with a mix of amusement and interest, suddenly said loudly, “Looks like Madam Rosmerta forgot to ask us what we wanted. We ought to get some drinks ourselves. Four butterbeers, yes? Come along, Ron.” She cheerily dragged her boyfriend by the arm and shot Harry a meaningful look - only, Harry couldn’t discern the meaning she had meant to convey.
“Stop, that’s going to hurt,” Malfoy murmured rather unconvincingly. Frowning, Harry reached down and brushed a broomstick-calloused palm against Malfoy’s cock, which became firm almost instantly.
“I need plants!” Draco shouted into the Room of Requirement. Ever since he’d restored it, he’d felt that there were presences here, an intelligence beyond ordinary magic. Unfortunately, the chamber did not respond. “So, that’s beyond your capabilities?” Draco asked bitterly, unwelcome tears pricking his eyes, “But killing someone is perfectly okay? Fuck, what do I need? Be specific,” Draco muttered to himself. “Mint or heather would be nice!” He called again, growing more impatient and worried by the moment. Harry’s body remained limp, his chest rising shallowly. “Now, you son of a…!”
Draco sighed. “Yes. Let’s start from the ground up. Follow me.” He headed for a door embedded into the wall, and a chill ran through Harry’s blood. He knew what lay behind that door: the stairs, digging deep into the bowels of the house, where Luna and Ollivander’s grimy faces looked towards him for help, where Wormtail’s silver hand clutched around his throat-
The Room of Requirement’s magic had not diminished since the last time Harry had visited. The room was small but cozy, with a fire flickering in one corner to drive away the castle’s chill. A simple, woven rug warmed the cold stone floor. Directly opposite the door was a window seat, covered in red and green cushions, set in an alcove. The view from the tall window would have been impressive, displaying the grounds, but persistent rain clouded the glass.
Reluctantly, Draco lowered his wand, disappointed to know it had failed him yet again. Though it was more likely
“Caroline told me to wait until we were finished. To tell you, I mean.” Latifah tapped her wand nervously against her thigh. Joey didn’t have the heart to tell her to put it away; no one was out and about in Prospect Park this early. Water dripped steadily, leftover from last night’s shower, from the bridge arching over their heads.
“Oh, by the way, Luna’s coming over tonight,” Justin mentions. Pansy immediately runs back, poking her grimace into the living room.
A knock on the door interrupted Harry from saying anything more. Ron slid open the door to greet the trolley witch.
Dahlia pursed her lips as if disappointed. “Well, think about it. Okay, spread out, everyone,” She said, motioning for them to stand farther apart from each other. “I’ve heard most of you already know the Patronus Charm, so today should be review. Think of a happy memory, of course, but don’t just say the incantation flippantly.
In which Draco fears the past isn't done with him yet. Meanwhile, Joey faces an uncomfortable reality.
Pale hands splayed on Draco’s knees, and he stared at them. “Yes. No. I mean…” He glanced at his hawthorn wand, tossed in the grass a few feet away. Draco shuddered, remembering the commanding voice in his head. He thought he was free of it, could finally move on from those dark years under
"You mean the same thing they’re doing to me?” Harry replied, searching for the end-of-year essay in his satchel. “Pretending like I don’t exist?”
Harry made a face as he said, “I suppose.” Draco nodded in agreement. Disgusted as he was, he wouldn’t be a good potioner if he passed up an opportunity to observe a new poison.
“Don’t you start,” Harry mutters, already running, but Draco, despite never being an athlete in any capacity, is too fast. He’s a fairy powered by the wind, sprinting out of reach, and laughs gaily when Harry trips and gets a faceful of muddy grass.
“I…” His dark eyes darted around the shop, though no one else was watching. “Not here. It’ll take just a minute, I promise. Please.”
He thought to himself, almost collapsing onto a bench next to the fountain. Draco hadn’t had a panic attack in a while, but this felt like one, tightening his lungs, eyes filling with fiery panic.
During the last class of the day, Harry opened his textbook as McGonagall lectured about Featuristic Transfiguration. As he flipped through the pages, a loose bit of parchment sticking out from behind the front cover caught his notice. Harry placed the scrap onto his notes, immediately recognizing the cramped cursive:
Rain poured down upon the castle at nightfall, but the students in the Slytherin common room only heard a muted drizzling as the drops hit the lake. The weather did not disturb the sounds inside, the scratching of quills, the crackling torches, and whispering.
They found Joanne sitting alone, abandoned plates and napkins circling the linen. Her chin rested in one hand while the other moved beneath a floating steak knife, spinning it in midair; Harry couldn’t see a wand.
A tall witch, draped in the maroon, uniformed robes of the Academy, hesitated near the threshold. Coal-black curls spilling to her shoulders framed dark eyes that scanned the cafeteria in a calculating manner that struck Draco as very Slytherin. Her hands, the same deep brown as her face, were clenched loosely at her sides. The woman’s gaze met Draco’s for an instant, by accident. Draco felt a tremor run down his spine at the look in her eyes: the intimidating yet hollow stare of someone who has been broken so utterly by the world that they no longer bow to Earth-bound fears. Draco knew that look well. He saw it every time he stood before a mirror.
“Let me see your burn,” Harry murmured, and Draco nodded, letting him unbutton the top of his uniform and dab potion across his skin.
Ginny sighed with relief as the crowd dispersed, players chatting, congratulating, and lamenting as they tromped across the grass.
Snow, thin on the ground where people had trekked through it, still dusted the garden’s greenery with coats of white. The trees standing nearby shivered in the wind, their branches stripped of nearly all their dying leaves.
Justin groans dramatically, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses. “Oh, for Pete’s sake, there’s more? What’d you do this time? Steal his underwear?” A beat of silence passes. “Don’t answer that.”
Harry turned his broom around, and his eyes widened. The Snitch slipped from his grip, and he ignored the people congratulating him from the stands. On the wet grass lay Draco, his broom flung to the side, his body writhing in pain.
Clouds of steam puffed into the dressing room as Draco shut off the water and pushed back the curtain. He could have Apparated home to shower, but he couldn’t stand the feel of sweat drying on his skin.
Pansy fights back her shivers and protests to join him on the frozen river. She gazes upwards but can hardly see the stars for the memorized words on her tongue.
“Draco M-Malfoy here to see you,” The secretary stammered, so softly that he must have been using a charm to speak through the door.
Harry dropped his bag in the corner and walked over to the nearest desk, lifting the chair, flipping it over, and sliding it on top. Then he hesitated, muttering, “We should probably move the desks before stacking them…”
A boyish grin spreads across Harry’s face. He really did miss Draco, despite the rivalry; he missed the cutting remarks, the eye rolls, as bitter as they were. “Nice to meet you, Draco. I’m Harry Potter.”
noise, and they remembered they weren’t alone. Harry blushed furiously, and Draco bit his lip apologetically. “Forgot you were there,” Harry said bashfully.
“Just…” Kingsley made a broad, sprinkling gesture with his hands. “Into dust. No trace of the original shape.”
The stranger bowed her head. “We understand. You should finish your education and think on our offer.” She stood with a rustling of crimson fabric. “But we have faith that we will meet you again. Even if fate’s hand must drag you.” She put her hands together, palms facing inward, held them to her chest, and bowed deeply. “Farewell, young one.” The witch knocked twice on the glass to alert her colleagues, and all three of them vanished at once.
His fist grabs the loose, unmade sheets. He waits a beat or two. That’ll be enough time for Draco to let himself out.
too late,” Dao simpered, her voice harsh. “Too late for you, at least. Too late for Dahlia.” She glanced at her Patronus, its tail swishing agitatedly. “Shame she couldn’t be here to share this moment with me, eh, Rabbit?”
“At least, I think it is. Truth be told, I’ve never met a Harry. I’m not making fun of you, by the way.” He talks like rain, fast yet soothing. “Christ, I couldn’t do that, could I? Not with a name like Draco.”
“I don’t doubt your beau will have similar questions,” Connors said gruffly. “Take this while I revive him.” She handed Draco a pink vial of Energy Draught.
Part of Harry wanted to leave the matter alone, but the jarring image of Malfoy’s carved, red-lined skin had burned itself into his brain. Propelled by a strong curiosity, Harry hurried out of the classroom after his arch-nemesis, ignoring Ron and Hermione’s shouted inquiries.
“If you doubt me so much,” Luna said, swirling a goblet of pumpkin juice, “Why don’t you come see them with me?”
Clever. Inside, the place was comfortably furnished, with a few fur rugs decorating the floor further inside and a couple of tall bookshelves against the wall. The glass cases separating the baristas from the customers held rows and rows of cakes, cookies, and small loaves of sweet bread. “Draco would love this place,” Harry said with a wistful smile.
Hermione watched this interaction with a sort of affable curiosity, then turned away pointedly to give them privacy.
Draco, hanging back, told Harry with his eyes to speak. “Professor, how strong are your ties to the Ministry?” The Gryffindor questioned.
“Shut up,” Harry muttered, but Draco’s grin was infectious, and he smiled as he added, “Don’t do that again.”
“I lived with Muggles as a kid, too,” Hermione pointed out as she slid a group of desks against the wall with one wave, “You just get lost in your own thoughts sometimes, Harry.”
“Sorry, but I promised Dad I’d be back before dusk,” Luna said dreamily. “We’re going to clear the Nargles off the plums.”
Her house will be crowded with boxes for a couple weeks, if not more. But soon the records will find new homes, in the curious hands of the people they should have belonged to in the first place.
Draco dropped the potion, stomach turning with dread. Harry deftly caught and corked it, then gently took Draco’s hands, ignoring the deadly ink. “This doesn’t define you,” he said firmly, “It will not take over.” Sweet, well-meaning Harry. He always knew the right thing to say; even if, Draco was pressed to admit, it wouldn’t make a difference.
When the interview is finished, the scene melts, and Harry sits in a chair similar to a dentists’ in a smaller room, lined on two sides with all sorts of equipment; mostly computer screens and dials and other things Harry can’t name. Dr. Patil straps a blood pressure monitor to his arm.
“How much of that did you hear?” Harry muttered to Draco as the three boys hurried down the many flights of stairs.
waiting, more likely. The instant he’d walked in, the Welcoming Witch had grimaced so horribly he knew the staff wouldn’t make his visit easy.
"Here," Harry handed him the jar of pickled viper tongues. Malfoy immediately opened it and set to work, pressing the juices from them.
Laughter suddenly drifted towards Harry from outside, and he was jolted out of reliving a nightmare. Bursting forth from the Shack into the freshly fallen snow, Harry took deep, gulping breaths. A few hundred meters away, Ginny and Luna were giggling as the former sprinkled snow over the latter’s blonde hair.
“Too fast,” Draco agreed, and he flung himself back onto the sofa in a breathless fashion. “You’re so…” He muttered, and the last words were indistinct.
A hot wind kicked up sienna-colored powder from the ground. Joey lifted her arm to shield her eyes, and when the breeze stopped, she spotted something down the street. A cold, blue glow, almost undetectable, appeared to emit from a source hidden behind the pharmacy. It could have been a street lamp or a sign of some sort, but it definitely hadn’t been there before.
“I almost want to stay here.” Draco looked up at the chandelier, then to the painting, the sofa, the kitchen with all its gleaming surfaces. “It looks like it used to. Happier.”
The lines worn in Harry’s young brow had deepened when he returned with news and a box of chocolate wafer twists. “Something’s been terrorizing the village for the past week,” Harry said quietly as they exited the convenience store. He tore off the cardboard top and wordlessly offered twists to Draco, then Joey. “It comes at night, and it hasn’t killed anyone yet, but everyone’s been shutting up their houses when the sun goes down.”
“Right…” Harry stretched out his arms and looked down at Draco, lying still on the hospital bed. The Slytherin’s face seemed peaceful, softer now that it wasn’t carved into a marble-like, angry expression. Draco’s chest rose and fell, his cheeks rosy from the wind. Harry almost felt sorry to leave, even though it was for Gryffindor Tower, where his friends would be cheering for him. But he also knew he would be back because Draco was his friend now. And as he had proved time and time again, Harry would remain loyal and supportive of his friends.
Draco nodded quickly and rummaged about in his robes. The dragon extended its neck, snarling, its vicious teeth mere feet away. Cursing, Draco pulled out his wand instead, summoning the bottle of green potion. “Get it to open its mouth!” He cried, uncorking the bottle. The dragon was scrabbling to stay on, inching forward. The whole roof was shaking - Draco knew they didn’t have much longer before it collapsed. He dimly registered screaming and running footsteps below them. People in the building must have been escaping; Draco hoped that they’d all get out in time.
“Harry, come quickly,” The woman urged, beautiful features scrunching in fear. Joey’s blood ran cold; they definitely hadn’t mentioned Harry’s name in front of her. “I need you.”
Joey pointedly cleared her throat, and Harry and Draco followed her gaze to the man standing with his hands in his pockets, surveying the moving crowd with his back to the portal - an attempt at being inconspicuous, Joey supposed.
“Er… It’s not,” Harry said. Percy looked up from his pie, and Mrs. Weasley paused her scooping of the vanilla ice cream. “They boarded the Hogwarts Express this afternoon.”
Outside, the wind began to die down. Snow fell less thickly that it had before, coating the ground in a soft layer of white.
"N-no, thank you," Harry stuttered, taking a step back. "Er…Professor? How long until the potion wears off?"
This is necessary, he tells himself. He doesn’t need a photo to imagine Draco, at least having the decently to wear regret as he stands before him. “You did this to me first,” Harry spits, though in the real memory, he hadn’t spoken aloud. “This is your fault. I’m taking revenge on you. How does that feel?” The phantom Draco does not reply. His silver eyes are filled with glimmering sadness.
Harry looked down at his pancakes, pushing away the unwelcome memories. He wanted to focus on the bright present, the unscathed people in front of him, the new friend who sat innocuously by his side.
“HE’S NOT A COWARD!” Harry bellowed, and Ron flinched. The magical gales blew in earnest now, surrounding the trio like a tornado and prompting Hermione to stuff their possessions back into her schoolbag with her wand. “When will you two realize that he’s not a Death Eater anymore? Stop living in the past! The war is over. It’s like you
Startled, Harry and Draco immediately turned to the sound, at the end of the nearest alleyway. Three girls wearing black robes stared back at them, expressions in varying states of shock. Henrietta’s eyes were wide, limbs slightly akimbo as if she’d been walking and suddenly forgotten how. Anaya Rosier had clapped a hand to her mouth, dark eyes showing more emotion than they ever had before. And in front of them, her jaw dropped, fists clenched… Harry’s heart sunk like a chunk of granite thrown into the Black Lake, sinking down into cold depths with no chance of reemerging.
“If I must,” Draco sighed, taking out a spare bit of parchment. He wrote down the seven classification levels as Harry looked on. “Here. Kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.”
As they busied themselves, Joey unslung a bag from across her chest - the black of it stood out so starkly against her pale blue shirt, Harry wondered how he hadn’t noticed it before. As he boiled water, Joey unclasped the bag and - Harry was reminded forcibly of Hermione - pulled from it a stack of parchment sheets that couldn’t have feasibly fit inside. She spread the seemingly blank pages across the counter, pulled out her wand, tapped the center one, and murmured a series of numbers. Immediately, information and a map bloomed across the parchment.
Draco abandons his prim manners as the soup dwindles; he picks it up and drinks from it directly. “It happens in every relationship,” He replies after a gulp. “It happened in all of mine.”
After only five minutes of pages turning and quills scratching, Hermione let out another sigh. “Oh, Harry. You’re only on number four?”
“All right, it probably won’t be easy. But we’ve spent three years training for this. And you, practically half your life.” Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s temple, and the headache began to subside. “What exactly are you scared of?” He asked quietly.
“Come on, up you get,” Draco sighed, holding out his hand for Harry to take. Harry clasped Draco’s forearm and stood up as well, secretly pleased to see that Draco’s face had taken on a pink tinge.
part of the series. The next oneshot will be available, I hope, within the next week or so. If you were asking about smut in this particular series, I’m going to say no. I don’t mind sexual scenes, but when they get too graphic, it tends to ruin the more serious tone of the story that I’m going for.
“Nice one, Parvati…” Professor Dahlia said as she looked about the room, “Seamus, keep your wand more horizontal…Hermione, that’s great work, see if you can do it wordlessly now…”
“We’ll put dittany on it later,” Draco promised. “Gavin lashed out at me, too.” He touched the darkened spot at his temple.
Abruptly, and perhaps with a bit more force than necessary, Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s. His cold hands gently caressed Harry’s face. Once Harry got over his surprise, his arms encircled Draco’s waist, and he felt his pain melt like snow in the summer, his worries about Ron and Hermione pushed resolutely from his mind.
“Oi!” Ginny yelled to Harry, who walked towards the Quidditch pitch, entirely lost in thought. “Where’s your broomstick?”
“Pansy,” Henrietta chided weakly, but she didn’t step forward, still eyeing Draco and Harry as if they were about to explode.
“Keep your friends close, Harry,” She told him. “Don’t ever let them stray.” She sounded so like Dumbledore that Harry suddenly felt a lump form in his throat as if he too was on the verge of tears.
“Got it.” Draco disappeared behind the deep green, and Harry blinked himself to full consciousness before rolling out of bed.
“Have a seat, Harry,” The Ravenclaw said in a pleasant but commanding tone. Harry did so, folding the Invisibility Cloak in his lap. “I know this must feel quite new to you,” Luna said, sitting next to him. “And it might be hard, seeing your former girlfriend with someone else.”
Ginny noticed this and walked closer to him. “Let me,” She said, pressing her thumbs into the sore muscle. Their pace slowed as Ginny massaged Harry’s shoulder.
Running footsteps came down the hall, and Harry skidded into the doorway. “Draco! Merlin, I thought I heard something crash,” He said worriedly, kneeling by his boyfriend’s side. “What happened?”
Despite not thinking he’d need them, Harry kept the borrowed leather gloves in his jacket pocket; they’d come to act as a token of affection from Draco, and Harry simply felt better having the garments with him.
Two students, one lanky, redheaded, and pale, the other short, bushy-haired, and darker, walked down the corridor side by side. The girl’s arms strained against a pile of books, but the boy’s hands were in his robe pockets.
“Please,” The woman whispered, tears suddenly rolling down her cheeks. “I don’t know where I am. A sweet boy like you can help me.” She appealed to Draco, widening her eyes and pouting.
It was a thrilling feeling, being in Draco’s arms, sliding a hand to his slender waist as his fingers tangled in messy hair. Harry realized just how long it had been since they’d kissed,
“Come see,” Draco replied, looping on a white facemask that stood by his workstation. Another one suddenly appeared by the cauldron, and he handed it to Harry.
Harry blinked. “Er, you knew that I talked about going to live with my godfather, but you didn’t know that I lived with Muggles for seventeen years?”
“Hey, mate,” Ron said from the couch. He and Hermione leaned comfortably against each other on the sofa, she reading a book and he writing on a piece of parchment pressed against his leg. “Malfoy.”
Joey pulled off her black boots, set them neatly by the wall, and gave her curly hair a quick fluff for good measure. “Cozy,” She remarked as she walked into the apartment, giving it a once-over.
Draco still hadn’t regained his composure, looking as if he was trying to magic himself into his chair. “Three years last February,” Harry replied, discreetly wiping his mouth with the back of his hand - the kiss had been sloppier than he would’ve liked.
“Well…it’s okay if you do most of the talking. I’m a better listener, anyway.” Ginny used to go on for hours, and Harry never minded.
Although, that wasn’t entirely true. Draco recalled two nights before, the warmth of the kitchen, Harry’s hands around his waist. He’d built joy out of his mess of a life. That had to count for something.
Flickering torchlight lit the staircase, whose banisters were draped in emerald, scarlet, blue, and yellow cloth. Harry didn’t spot Draco just yet, but as the foursome descended, a burst of yellow suddenly sped toward them, and Ginny laughed as she caught Luna in her arms.
Then, Lily, rich auburn hair matted with death’s sickly stench. The beautiful eyes that hovered over his crib, by his side after a football game, in the driver’s seat, stare like lifeless jewels.
Joey’s gaze flicked again to Draco’s photo. He couldn’t have been older than seventeen, his eyes hollow, pleading. She wondered how long he’d had that look in his eighth year - when the war had finished, but its wounds were fresh.
“We don’t need him fully conscious,” He hears Lucius say. “The potion will do its work well enough…” Everything goes black, and Draco passes out for the second time that day.
“Um…” Ginny gave Luna a glance, and an affectionate smile crept across her face. “Yeah. We are. For about…how long has it been?”
Nothing more than an echo down a nearby alleyway. Harry stops for a moment, listening for more, but the crowds of people, the snap of firecrackers, and passing cars are deafening.
Harry started to open his mouth to ask what Draco was doing, but it was crystal clear what he was doing: playing with his hair. His fingers moved with exceeding gentleness, twirling and stroking almost absentmindedly. Draco hadn’t looked up from his book. Harry closed his eyes to the pleasant sensation, smiling - and he knew that even as he was blinded by the sunlight glowing against his eyelids, his boyfriend smiled, too.
“Well, I’ll read through these, then,” Harry sighed, “Can’t miss any fine print. And I know it’s no great American novel like you’ve brought me,” He reached beneath the top of the desk, and Draco heard a drawer slide open, “But here’s a contract for my side.” He handed a thin packet to Draco. “If you see any discrepancies, let me know. And, please - feel free to distract me. I have a feeling we’ll be here a while.”
He takes the pills, and artificial exhaustion overcomes him, soaking like shadow into his eyes. Harry leaves the top button of his red silk pajamas undone, crawling into bed just as sleep dims his mind.
“Does the window open?” Harry wondered aloud, and as he said it, a handle appeared next to his hand. He pulled it, and the pane swung open, letting in a considerable amount of wind and water, plus the owl, which was swept unceremoniously onto the rug.
Draco, who was not used to being addressed thus, flushed red. He opened his mouth to argue, thought better of it, and pushed past Hyacinthe to enter.
“I nearly punctured their bollocks with my shoes and ran the hell away, that’s what I did,” Malfoy spits, “And don’t call me that. We’re not friends.”
“Whatever happens,” Harry promised, “We’ll get through it together.” He held out his hand once more.
Draco, to a conniving, single-minded tempter? “He’s not trying to get me on his side. There are no sides!” Harry stood, trembling with rage from head to foot. The rushing in his ears was not flowing blood - the very air itself whipped into gusts around him, but he didn’t realize. “Voldemort is dead! The Death Eaters are weakening, Draco has no reason to join them!”
“Potter,” Draco said warningly, but he couldn’t help but smile when Harry tried and failed to stifle a giggle.
With a wet snarl, the krasue lunged faster than Joey could register. Still nauseated, she didn’t react fast enough, but Draco did, shouting, “
“Of what?” He cups his face, fingers brushing against dark stubble. “Harry, love, you can talk to me. About anything.”
row with Harry. Ever since the beginning, Ron had couldn’t entirely trust Malfoy for cozying up with who was supposed to be
“With all due respect, Minister,” Hermione chimed in, “Are you sure you want to be telling us? Surely this is sensitive information.”
“Potter, darling, please shut it,” Draco muttered. Ray, whether he’d heard or not, did not bat an eye.
“Merlin, Joey, I’m his husb- his boyfriend!” Harry clammed up, cheeks rosing, and meekly righted his chair as if he hadn’t been yelling a moment ago.
He could pretend. Instead, he refocused on reality and on the orange and blue streetlights outside. The late afternoon lull had disappeared, replaced with the busy thrum of nighttime.
“I’m surprised, I thought we’d be getting more attention,” Draco remarked as his hands wrapped around the warm mug in front of him.
Joey did know it. The world was full of pointless villains like him. The name was fading from her mind already, but not the deeds: kidnapping children, draining them for blood magic. His soul had already shattered anyway, so all they did was the same to his body. Joey didn’t know how he looked in his final moments, as he wore a mask, smooth and steel-gray. Masks seemed to be the trend these days, imitating some dusty Dark wizard an ocean away.
“Well…Draco got through to us,” Hermione said, smiling, and turned to him. “Could I give you a hug?”
Luckily, most of Hogwarts still attended to breakfast, and their trek remained uninterrupted all the way to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey, spotting a feeble student in the doorway, immediately rushed from her office to aid them.
“Very well. Off to bed.” Headmistress McGonagall stepped back. The Slytherins were the first to move.
A weak, pale blue haze bloomed in a semi-circle beyond Harry. He hoped it would be enough to throw the masked wizards off their trail. Before he could spur himself to fight instead of run, Harry ignored his instincts in favor of his training and followed his partner to hide.
Joey gave Harry, who had just told her this, a questioning glance. “Why? We’ve got nearly an hour to go.”
“For the past few years, Manila’s underground wizarding population has been largely run by a crime ring that goes by the name Sin Pax.”
“We still have a lot of time left. And we wanted to wait for our leader,” Harry smiled warmly at her, but she didn’t have the energy to return it.
“Yeah.” Justin loves when Luna gets like this, all starry-eyed and passionate when she talks about tech and science.
As the minutes whir by, Harry’s story unfolds. He met Draco at Salisbury, where they fast became rivals and got along horribly. The Harry on the tape expresses regret at this - he curses himself for not trying harder to get through Draco’s shell, for extending a friendlier hand to him.
Draco’s hand rested on Harry’s chest for a moment longer than was necessary, and his silver eyes glittered with mischief as he finally released him. He knew exactly what he was doing.
“Draco has guessed this already. It shouldn’t be a big deal, really.” Joey held Harry’s and Draco’s gazes in turn, determined not to study the knotted patterns in the wooden table.
Also, the last section of this chapter is heavily based off of the canon scene in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, so if you notice JKR's dialogue, that's because some of it is! I'm claiming unoriginality for that bit. The only difference, of course, is that it's from a Draco Malfoy-focused third-person perspective.
“So my mother’s sisters took me in to teach me how to hone my magic the best I could, without anything to channel it. They taught me and other young witches non-magical skills, too.
