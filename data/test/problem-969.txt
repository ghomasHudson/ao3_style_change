mark caused. It felt nice to have one more thing in common with him, a scar from Voldemort himself.
I stood, reaching out a hand for him to take. I led him over to a clearing next to the blanket. I stood behind him and placed my hand over the one holding his wand. Raising his arm up, I made sure he was in the proper position.
"Ow," looking up I noticed it was his pointed shoe that poked me in the side.
The kitchen was all prepared for today's Christmas extravaganza, well at least a small corner of the kitchen was. The only way to spend Christmas-Eve-Eve is baking like there's no tomorrow.
I accepted and quickly, as he had done earlier, retracted it. I felt vulnerable now. It had felt good to finally tell someone what had happened between me and Ginny, but I wasn't sure if Draco was the person I should have told first. Either way, I don't think it mattered much in the end.
That made him uncomfortable, I could tell. I didn't really care though, how could we overcome this stupid pettiness if we called each other by our last names?
I couldn't help but notice things about him. He looked sickly in the light. I hadn't noticed it last night. The bags under his eyes were probably darker than mine in fifth year and he looked exceptionally bony. His skin was paler than normal, something I would have thought impossible. All in all, he was obviously not ok.
Bending down, I explained to her the situation, "Hello! My name is Harry. If there's something you need you can ask one of the other workers, I'm afraid I lost my hearing and won't be able to know what you're saying."
"Well, maybe at one point I did, but I don't think that's true. We had a really big falling out during the breakup."
"I was alone, so alone this year. It was terrible, but you wouldn't know that. Everything was so dark and you had just left with practically no explanation. I thought we were through for a while. I needed someone to help me forget everything. I- I cheated Harry. I'm terrible and now you probably hate me."
he started,
"I-I just don't think I'm ready yet. It's all too soon and we just started dating and I-I can't yet." I felt my eyes turn glassy. I took a deep breath and relaxed slightly. I've handled much worse before, it's Draco that should be more upset.
----------------------
I chuckled at his theatrics and started down the long steps to Hogsmede.
Can you kiss me again... please? Just in case that's true." I was so glad he asked.
He took my hands in his. "I'll have you, isn't that enough protection for the world?"
I don't know why I suspected they were getting along now. I was the one that reached out to him, not them. They probably thought he hadn't changed and I was just trying to be nicer.
I reached my hand across the table. He looked at it skeptically and hesitantly reached his hand out.
-----------------
Merlin, where is this coming from? "I understand that!
And so, it began. We found ourselves nestled between two other people working the canned food station. We would box up ten cans per person and then would hand them off to the families that wanted them. It was hours of work, and since our hands were occupied the night was spent in silence.
After my fight with Ron, I've been trying to keep things with Draco very quiet. I don't even want him to know let alone anyone else. Dean recommended I told "mystery man" sooner rather than later, but part of that may have been he just wanted me to stop coming to him for help.
printed in silver.
She took my upper arm and pulled me back to a seated position.
And so, I did.
I was slightly started when I looked over to see him already settled into the chair across from us. Is he really that fast?
I planted my feet on the ground in front of him. He held his stance, unbothered by the proximity. "
I have to sit by Draco in front of all my classes, so we can see the interpreter, therefore I knew instantly something was off.
We didn't know it at the time and if I could I would have given up so much more for him not to go through what I did after that attack. I didn't even know I was hit and I don't think he did either. I don't know about you, but when you're in the middle of killing the Dark Lord hearing loss isn't your biggest issue.
Reaching out, I tilted his chin up. His eyes were glassy and I felt something clench in my gut. He looked so broken.
When I walked back over he was reading again, except this time he was reading the journal, not
she pointed to my scar.
I didn't catch the titles of the others, but I did get one. In big gold letters on the front of the top book stated clearly.
I signed.
"PLEASE HARRY"
" I clasped a hand over her mouth.
I reply
and with that, she left, leaving Ron's mouth agape.
There it was, an admittance of something he wouldn't have said in any normal situation. This was anything but normal.
Well, that was oddly kind of him.
We walked for a while in silence. I found it extremely awkward, but if he did too he showed no signs of discomfort. He was still close and out shoulders brushed with every step. He continued to look forward, seemingly oblivious to my inner turmoil.
We settled into a corner far away from the working elves and feasted on bacon sandwiches and coffee. Draco seemed a tad uncomfortable with the friendliness of the house-elves here, I doubt he had seen much of that in his time at the manor.
I don't know Dean, I've never felt like this before. I flopped down on the bed with a slight bounce.
When I made it to our bedroom, it was well past dinner time. I hadn't realized I spend the entire day in the infirmary. My hand stilled on the doorknob, I almost thought it would be best to sleep on the couch. I ultimately decided to suck it up and walked in.
He can read me so well, always has. "
"These kinds of relationships are slightly different than, well you know. They just don't last, plus they probably don't even like me back." I furrowed my brows.
I readjusted my scarf in the warm shop,
You can't apparate in Hogwarts and I knew no human alive could run
He laughed and wrote out,
Draco sent me a stern look.
"I- uh, that's fine." I'm such an idiot, he gave me a worried look then covered it.
Trust me, there is a lot more important news to be reporting.
His eyes trembled slightly and were glossed over with emotion. I knew he was almost over the mental wall of panic.
He nodded and we threw out the wrappers on our way to the curb. We walked to find an empty alleyway to apparate back in, it was easier than earlier.
"I'm ok. I'm not going to hurt you," I whispered aloud, "do you need anything?"
My brows furrowed, "I mean, I hope so. I just feel like we have nothing to show for it. We have no books, no ideas, and no help."
Instantly, his hand flew to his left forearm and I moved closer. He searched my face as I reached out to brush my hand over the fabric of his sleeve.
His hands found mine, pulling them away from their position. I peeked at him, "You really think you can just mess with me?"
He seemed to come back to reality as he took his hand back and loosened up his body.
Steady slow beats the race,"
I laughed, he did have a point.
"Hey um, thanks again... for everything."
She always wanted to know everything, and I understood why. I just thought this would be better if kept wrapped up.
there it was again, the pink tint in his cheeks. He looked away and I thought it was better to drop this concept before it got too personal. He had shared enough I guess.
Seamus looks around, like a detective from a cheap Murder Mystery. See, one the one hand you have people ready to sucker punch you around the corner because they think you take it up the arse now. On the other hand, you have people who are bloody peeing themselves to get a look at the schools first gay couple.
When we reached the entrance we agreed that I would go to dinner, and he would stay in the dorms to "recover" from his Dragon Pox.
Soon I would be home.
I sent her a look, "Thank you list?"
"No! You should have kept quiet or not continued reading or something! This is not my fault," I wasn't sure how loud I was being, but I honestly didn't care. It's not the first time one of our fights has gained attention.
I felt slightly tingly and when he nodded at his work I noticed it was another cleaning charm. Stuck-up prat.
His eyes became distant. "
People are very different in their views of sexuality these days. I didn't want to potentially cause myself harm over something that I wasn't entirely sure was true.
"Thank you, Harry."
Ron looked absolutely dumbfounded that I had not only saved Draco but gone out of my way to do so.
"Oh, do you see that man over there? He's the one who put it together. If you want me to thank him I can, he also can't hear things."
We stopped outside the door and glanced at one another. I inhaled deeply then knocked on the door.
I pushed it out of my head and started dating Ginny, she was the only future I could ever see myself realistically having.
I thought it was our compartment so I went to open the door. What I found was Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zambini, and none other than Draco Malfoy. Pansy and Blaise both snapped there heads towards me, to door probably creaked when I opened it. Malfoy stayed gazing out the window. He looked much calmer than I remembered, he also looked less broken, freer. I saw a hand wave in from of my face and when I looked over it was Pansy. She had her hands on her hips and it looked like she was trying to tell me something. Probably asking why I was here.
I rolled my eyes at his cockiness. Some things never change, though now I had a hard time finding it as a bad thing.
Ron quickly responded.
"Very funny," he rolled his eyes and they were off.
she responded while pointed to Malfoy. Did Pansy Parkinson, the Queen of Slytherin, just offer me help on behalf of my rival of 8 years to learn sign language? As if she could read my mind she responds with, "
She sat on the floor and wrote something.
When I found him, he was sitting behind a column in a dim hallway. He looked almost scared with his hair blocking his eyes and arms around his knees. Slowly, I walked towards him.
I instantly had my answer clear as day, I needed to go back to Hogwarts. For everybody who had put faith in me, my friends,
"Explain, please. If I die... I want to know." I could feel the water in my own eyes threatening to spill. This was not how I was intending it to go.
I sigh leaning my head back. I'm not as good at signing as I am reading it so it was fairly easy for me to understand what she said. Ron didn't even bother, but he already knew what happened so I didn't really care. I'm pretty positive that if he knew what really went down that day, saw what she said, what she had done, he would be more on my side. I couldn't tell anybody though because I knew she would just tell everyone the real reason we broke up and I wouldn't be able to handle that. I trusted her, that was going to be my biggest mistake if I wasn't careful. I closed my eyes so they couldn't talk to me even if they wanted to, which they probably didn't.
He signed smugly.
I signed, looking at Ron.
I blanched before averting my eyes.
(Just go with me here, it's for plot purposes, I know Ginny isn't "feminine" in the books and is presented as more of a tomboy. I don't really like Ginny so we're changing things up)
"HERMIONE. My dorm. Now," I panted, resting my hands on my knees.
That was a sentence I never thought I would say.
Mr A's face fell almost instantly, he stood up to place distance between us.
his feet shuffled the ground as he walked.
Damn it.
Shit, this isn't going to end well. In order to do this, I'm going to have to stare at Draco's lips for over an hour, and as nice as that might seem, it's going to be extremely difficult.
He waved over Madam Pomphrey and she made her way over, it was the first time she had moved in the past half hour. They spoke in hushed voices, making it impossible to understand what they were talking about.
I didn't know where this was coming from. "
"What do you want to do?"
He looked over to Hermione, signaling it was too much for him to sign. I sat down across from her and read her movements. "
Ron had been asking for a few weeks to go out.
I had just gotten to the office when I saw somebody leaving it. As I got closer I noticed who it was. "Hey! Mr.A," I called after him. When he turned I gave him a wave and he returned with another closed mouth smile. His dark eyes seemed lighter and pale skin seemed to almost glow in the dark. What really caught my attention was when he turned his stuff fell out of his bag. I noticed some books and wen to help him, but he pushed me out of the way. He looked up and his eyes seemed to say an apology. "It's ok," I said. He nodded and put the books back in his bag. He swiftly turned around, robes billowing behind him.
Draco motioned towards me. I breathed, taking in my surroundings. This was a familiar place, with a familiar person. I could say what I wanted, it would be ok.
---------------
charm. It read 8:45.
He ducked out of the way and flashed a smile,
He covered his chest like he had been unaware of its presence this whole time. Dean took the pillow next to him and hit me with it.
Wait... a person?
"May 22, 1998: The Battle of Hogwarts"
I asked, nodding to the store, Harrods, in front of us. I had never been allowed to go into Harrods myself, the Dursleys thought it too good for me and the only other time I had been to London was with Hagrid and he certainly couldn't have taken me.
Trust Draco to be able to come up with a plan only the same day I had told him what had happened.
Right Side: Theodore Nott, Zacharias Smith, Neville Longbottom, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Seamus Finnigan
The dragon curled up by his hip, and it slowly faded in the brisk night air.
I brought my four fingers up to my chin and moved them away from myself. The little girl turned to Draco and put her tiny fingers to her chin and extended them towards him. I think I saw a tear threaten Draco's cheek.
And with that, he handed us a notebook.
He had rolled his sleeves up to the elbows, seemingly he was getting warm. I guess he was used to the emptiness of Malfoy Manor where nobody would judge him for it. My breath hitched as I gazed at the black skull mark on his left arm.
I swear I could still hear that drawl through his hand signs.
He was very red but still reached for the quill.
I inhaled the smoky scent once before running off to find somewhere to eat. Draco was hot on my heels, and I decided to make a competition out of it. He inched closer, but I knew I was faster. He may have had longer legs, but I had the advantage of years of running away from people.
Left side: Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, Blaise Zambini, Dean Thomas
OK, so we didn't break up. (Not officially anyways) We did, however, go one WHOLE week without talking to each other. (It was a lot to us at the time) It would have gone longer, had someone not intervened. Back then I was furious, but now, I will make sure to thank them again.
I took out the book and write,
What just happened?
she signed. I was shocked that she knew sign. Her question wasn't offensive. It wasn't super common in the muggle world let alone the wizarding world. Why would she have bothered to learn?
"You really care? Fine then, it was Anthony." She looked almost smug now.
He was wearing that damn smirk again. Two can play at that game.
"Hey! Oh,
This made him laugh. If you have never seen Draco Malfoy laugh, I would recommend it. It will make you forget about your stupidity and go right along with him. He looked genuinely happy for the first time ever.
"It wouldn't matter," I said with a false calm, "It's not true."
I hopped up on to the counter and popped a gumdrop off my door to eat. He looked at me like I had just killed someone.
Nothing, that is until I awoke to a paper being thrown at me. For the first time, it was Draco who woke me up.
Out of his pocket, he procured the small vial of glowing, Colbolt liquid. I watched as the magic swirled within the glass, it amazed me. I handed it to Draco, he too seemed intoxicated.
Mr. A provided a closed mouth smile and we nodded towards him in acknowledgment.
I shook my head and went over to the table on the far right side of the room, behind Gryffindor. Keeping my head down until Hermione tapped my shoulder and pointed to McGonagall at the front of the Hall. I didn't understand what she was saying, but I figured it was the usual speech. I decided to see who else had come back. They had sent letters to everybody, though it seemed a lot of them didn't want to be back and I couldn't blame them. I saw Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zambini at the end of the table. It was weird not seeing Crabbe and Goyle with them but after Crabbe... I couldn't see Goyle coming back. Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass also sat by them, keeping some distance. Almost no one from Hufflepuff came back, it's not like I knew many of them. Every Ravenclaw from our year was there, which was only about 12. Then there was our trio, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Pavarti.
"I thought you were looking for presents?" Draco inquired.
One thing I did know, I really did enjoy kissing him. I only hoped he felt the same. I know he likes me too, why else would he ask me out? It's still hard to comprehend it, I had never thought about it before.
A brush on the shoulder.
It wasn't a bad feeling, on the contrary, it was the best feeling of being alive I could ever ask for. The mand across from me matched my emotions ten-fold.
My eyes lingered on Malfoy. He obviously wasn't paying Mcgonagall much attention either. I didn't get a good look at him before. His pale blonde hair was falling in front of is face and his face was sunken in.  It looked like he hadn't slept in months or eaten either. I knew I didn't look much different. The only thing that stood out as the same from all those years ago, was his eyes. They were still the same stormy grey I had hated from that one time in Madam Malkin's. They were no longer set into a glare, his lips no longer a typical smirk. He looked up from the table and met my gaze. I thought for a split second I could see color drain back into his pale complexion. A light dusting of pink on his cheeks. The food appeared, and the moment was lost.
I suppose me being gay made sense, it was like something finally clicked. It would explain my nonexistent love-life, my strange feeling of attraction throughout the years, and everything that's been going on recently. I looked back to Draco, I hoped he would be fine, for his sake and mine.
I picked up a lot of candy, and some biscuits too. I had only ever gotten candy if I stole some from Dudley's Halloween pile, so some of this was foreign to me too.
I've never put much thought into my clothes before, but I felt like this mattered more for some reason.
Now I saw why Draco mentioned it earlier. It all made sense, but just with no reason behind it yet.
I honestly wasn't shocked to read the letter. I knew they would ask us to come back because
I really couldn't understand why he was giving this to me. Shouldn't these things be kept private? Then, my mind wandered to my thoughts just a few hours ago and I had to shake them away.
Easy answer: you don't.
I walked through the barrier to King's Cross Station. The bustling of the crowd was just loud enough that it sounded like low ocean waves. I looked at the large train, not thinking I would ever see it again or miss the sound of the whistle. I tried looking around to find my friends. I found the Weasleys and Hermione a little ways away. It wasn't hard to see the sea of red hair amongst the other wizards on the platform. I didn't go over to them though. I felt awkward being around their family. It was my fault they were so broken. If it wasn't for me Fred wouldn't be dead, George would be happy again, and Ginny wouldn't be pissed at me.
I asked. I thought it was weird she didn't ask Ron to come. I guess he was still sore over the bus ride or something.
After breakfast, we headed back down to Hogsmede. This wasn't technically a date, in fact, we weren't even going to be with each other for most of the trip. I wanted to get Christmas presents, and Draco wanted to leave the stuffiness of the castle, so this was a good solution.
One thing that was the same, Draco was still sound asleep in the next bed over. I never really noticed how little sleep he got, but I knew his schedule wasn't what was recommended.
When we came back up I smiled a little wider. "So, what does this mean?"
why he was here. Apparently it wasn't to get a job like everybody else here. I may not have an idea, but I knew I was going to do something. He thought he wasn't going to be able to get a job? He wasn't really a Death Eater, if he was he'd be in Azkaban right now.
I flopped back on the bed, I just had to tell her at this point. "Th-they're a boy, 'Mione. I just don't get it."
Hermione shot me a look,
I lost many things that day, but I would give up a thousand more for everyone else to continue with their lives normally. I had no one to lose, which is why I never had a problem with risking my life. When I saw the lives around me fade away that was when it sunk in. Even though I had nobody left, I had nothing more to be taken, that wasn't the case for the hundreds of people there that day.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and nodded for me to ask.
His eyes gleamed, "
He plopped a large book onto the desk and muttered something. It flipped open to a section that had medical reference books listed.
This was officially the longest staring contest I had ever been in. We were both extremely stubborn, there's no doubt about that.
He tapped his chin twice,
I read the note from Ginny three times before it sunk in. Draco had read his and he obviously didn't enjoy it. It reoccurred to me that I was still planted a meter away from the table, unmoving. I signed a quick
"You going to just go and die then?" She called after me.
Speak of the Devil, there he was. I noticed the soft glow coming from his wand across the table. I picked my head up only to look at the sight of Malfoy, sitting across from me, and reading a book. His hair fell in front of his face and the mixture of moonlight and magic made it glow. His eyes reflected the same blue light and seemed more vibrant. He looked calm, at ease.
Everyone's mouths shut and eyes were pulled towards me. It kinda felt like fifth year.
Adding in the fact he was a guy now, I found it didn't change my mind. I was made up, Draco had made me so happy when I thought that was impossible, why wouldn't I go along for the ride? I would have to tell him yes when we were out of this forest.
Then it happened. The day I'll never forget and I felt the slight shift in the tilt of Earth's axis. I opened a new chapter in my life. This chapter wouldn't be told in the tales, nor in the history books. Who would want to hear this side of the story? Most would find this aspect of my life boring or may say it paints me in a bad light. I might have become weaker or lost things that made me who I am, but I am more myself than I have ever been.
Hermione waved me over, as tired as I may have been, I settled in between them.
He looked up at me and I felt my cheeks burn hot again, I hadn't realized I was staring. He quirked an eyebrow but said nothing more. He went back to reading and after a few more minutes of simply pondering why he wasn't moving, I reached across the table and took the book from his hands.
After what felt like hours and seconds all at once he looked back at me. That was the Draco I became friends with, not the one from years ago.
I just wanted a good relationship for once and apparently, my heart was set on the one person who would be impossible to get. Unless he made the first move, there would be no first move. I think I'm ok with that, maybe then it will all go away.
I must say this was really testing my patience. Hadn't I just said he changed? Maybe he wasn't really mean, but his attitude was still just as strong.
Draco sat on his bed, the curtains apart, and staring into space. He didn't notice me until I crept over to his bed. I tapped his shoulder,
I stopped in my tracks. Ron and I were on the way to dinner and I hadn't given much thought into last night.
I tended to look at the whole being deaf thing as an outsider. I had only had my hearing loss for a few months and we were still determined to get it back. I knew deep down that there was a way to fix this. I still continued to learn BSL because I also knew that it would be a while before that would happen. Hermione was extremely good at it and I wouldn't be surprised if she had already known a lot of it. Ron was... trying to say the least. The only other person I had seen this summer was Ginny, but she didn't come over much after the breakup.
I felt someone nudge my seat. It was Seamus. He took the book peaking out of my bag and opened it to a blank page.
I didn't realize he was paying attention to my sleep schedule, not like it mattered when I got back.
Ron pointed at me.
His lips fit perfectly into mine and his breath was minty and cool which contrasted with the warmth of my own. He made me feel safe and calm like he was feeling the same way I was. It was extremely reassuring to not feel alone in this.
———————-
It was sloppy, almost distracted, but I understood what he meant.
this bastard.
Ron asked, distancing himself from Blaise.
He faltered at that.
After we finished eating the schedules were handed out. Everyone around me had gotten one so I was worried when I hadn't. It was then, I looked over to Hermione to ask her what was wrong.
She frowned slightly,
I sat on the bed across from him while putting on my shoes.
." He flinched and backed away. We both were unsure of what our next words would be.
"Boys," she mumbled closely as we walked out of the back gate.
I knew we had... kissed... or whatever, but did that really mean anything? I mean it did to me, but I couldn't really... go out with Draco, could I? I mean he's a guy and that would make me gay or something. This is confusing.
Could this have something to do with Harry Potter speaking on Draco's behalf this summer? Will Harry come forward against these acts? Could this be all a distraction of something much more sinister?
We were in the entrance hall a little way down from the library. Draco walked over to one of the tall windows and pulled the curtain back. He waved me over.
When I had checked the room to see if anyone was hiding around, I ushered her to the bed. After five paces in front of her, she stuck her foot out and tripped me. "What was that for?"
The library owned ten books that included anything that would help to cure magical deafness. The fact that they were all gone was more than coincidence. Did someone know his plans? Were they going to sabotage him? Had Malfoy gotten them first?
After they insisted on changing the original groups, they also didn't sit together at lunch, so I sat with Ron and Hermione instead.
Two doors to the right I found Ron and Hermione's tensely staring at each other on the same bench. Ah, young love. I cleared my throat and they both snapped their head towards me. "What's up?" I say out loud, trying to ease the tension.
I could almost hear the door slam shut behind him.
I shook my head and backed away, wanting nothing more than to wipe the tears from his eyes that threatened to fall. The clock kept ticking. "Draco, I can't..."
I dabbed some of the buttercream onto my finger as well and then proceeded to smear it on his nose. After going slightly cross-eyed, he glared down at me.
It wasn't until I was out of the library I thought to dig in my pocket. Inside was a small note, written in the neatest script I've ever seen.
I dragged my body off the hospital bed and decided it was too late to stay longer in the infirmary. My feet slugged up the millions of stairs to out dormitory. It all felt so useless.
Who was he to say he had an easy life? I had been forced into a life I never wanted. I was pressured to be something bigger than I am. Some higher power was always giving me a new task. I was forced to hold up one specific image, not being myself. Everyone would jump from siding with me to hating me faster than I could keep track of. I witnessed people die left and right and never had a family that loved me or was alive.
He turned around and yelled something to the bed behind him, I could only catch "Harry" and "Talk".
Did he like any of the good classes? Plus, I wasn't sure if I wasn't even qualified for an advanced class.
11 minutes
Did he not hear what I just said?
I blinked those thoughts away as he waved a hand in front of my face.
My face heated a little so I quickly went back my own shelf about cooking herbs. When I was sure he wasn't pining me with his eyes anymore I chanced another glance over.
Ron and Hermione seemed concerned. Ron wasn't in the class, but Hermione had told him what she saw. They didn't even mention Draco though.
"I mean you could always sign too-" She was taking too much time, so I grabbed her arms and ran back towards the dorm.
I moved my lips, I was close enough for anyone to be able to read them. "You need to trust yourself. I don't hate you anymore, I've only ever truly hated one person. Become comfortable in your own skin, then push me away. Are you corrupting me?"
I manoeuvred my way over to my usual seat across from my friends. Sitting down, I piled a small helping of food onto my plate. "Thank you for today, I needed to get out of here."
Something stirred beside me, and I looked down to see Draco's eyes flutter open. His cheeks flushed, and in an instant, he was sitting straight upright. He coughed, looked at me sideways, and then quickly averted his gaze.
Out of his wand erupted a miniature Hungarian Horntail. The silver whisp of a creature encircled us, I felt breathless. Draco was thrown back with momentum and landed flat on his arse. His eyes reflected the glow, he truly was beautiful.
He had that knowing look in his eyes.
I looked over to Draco sitting beside me. During the course of Mr A's story he had slouched closer to me, our hands' inches apart. He looked scared, about what I couldn't discern.
My whole life I had never been a huge fan of change. Draco seemed like a part of that routine I couldn't get rid of, no matter what.
"No, it's not why we dated. I only dated you so I could be normal again. I hate being different! It's been like that my whole life. Can't you see why I needed to date someone? People might have suspected."
He was asking a lot about if I liked Cho, and at the time I wasn't sure. He came up with ten signs that you like a person and we eventually concluded that no, I did not like Cho.
I dragged my trunk over to the people loading the train and got on board. I wondered who else was coming back? That only made me think of Malfoy again. I really didn't want a repeat of the sixth year. I could only handle so much of an obsession. I walked down the aisle and noted the people in the compartments. Hufflepuffs normally sat towards the front, I assume it's to greet people when they come on. Then it's the Ravenclaws by the emergency exits, they do this so that they can tell people how to leave in case of problems. The Gryffindors sit next, not much reasoning there just kind of what was left. Then at the very back of the train was where the Slytherins were located, probably to isolate themselves from the other houses. I tried to find our normal compartment, but I ended up walking into snake territory.
I rolled my eyes and leaned in slightly, "Are. You. Corrupting. Me?" He put his hand on the desk behind him and looked around the room before responding.
He was probably just going on a walk or meeting with somebody else. I remembered the map was in my cloak. So, I headed back to the library.
The sky itself was just starting to dim, and Moonbugs had just started to glow blue around us. He held it up to the sky, it blended in perfectly. He looked over to me, with a grin spreading across his face.
I officially hate being Harry Potter.
When we had reached the hospital wing, I couldn't help but wonder why we were called in the first place. If Madam Pomfrey had needed us, it seemed strange she had never done it before.
I dropped his hands, and with it, I felt my heart drop as well. "Draco..."
I saw him search my features before he let out a breath that swept across my face. He stepped back.
Leaning in I pressed a small kiss to his lips. It wasn't like last time, there wasn't that built-up tension or want. It felt needy, raw, different. Like he was afraid to let go. No tears fell from his eyes though, like with every second the need to do so vanished.
--------------
he replied curtly. I didn't feel the need to press him. He hadn't pressed me, so why should I? "
he squeezed my hand.
I didn't notice Ron's face, but there was some slight hurt in Draco's when I used his last name. I'll talk to him about that later.
—————————-
What do you get for someone who you've only been dating for a day, but have wanted to date for months?
I made the note,
He made a face that I was sure could have killed me if he tried, so much for the calm. I wasn't sure which was better, this new Malfoy that didn't want to stir trouble, or the old one that I had known for years.
The way he said it made sense, I am Harry Potter, why couldn't I do what I wanted?
I laughed as I gathered my things.
His eye roll didn't go unnoticed, but at this point, I couldn't care less. I just wanted to see Hagrid again.
I turned towards the castle and set off, we matched in pace. "Oh, I did. They just aren't with me."
Shit.
Then we spiralled into the darkness.
"I have absolutely no idea...," he stared into my eyes intensely. "Tell you what, go to Hogsmede with me? We'll go with our friends and everyone will think it's just because they wanted to hang out or-or that we were wanted to get out of the castle or something. That way it won't be a big deal...," he trailed off.
Shaking his head he got out a small pot and set the milk to warm. I can't help but think that this is the most relaxed he's been all week.
His eye darted from wall to wall, trying to find any clues.
He paused to examine my expression, which was probably pretty embarrassing.
Parkinson popped up first,
My mind reeled with thoughts. How could she know? Why was she dictating my lo-personal life? And why didn't she believe that he had changed? "
There was one person though, that after everything, understood what I've gone through in a somewhat different light. I had never expected it to happen. I didn't want it at the time by any means. But, when the world dies down you have to spice it back up a bit. I still can remember that day when I died, correction, almost died. I escaped the inevitable, again. When I fell I heard the yell of this person and he came running, I didn't know why. He would later claim that he yelled to me because I was his only hope, his only sense that something so terrible could have a shred of light. When he ran, out of the grasp of the embodiment of death, he too was hit.
I reached out to grab his wrist, but he tugged away. I figured if this wasn't a good time to talk then I would let him go his own way for now. I wouldn't avoid this forever though. Whether I liked it or not, Draco was a part of my life now.
The room stilled slightly when I entered, I could almost hear the noise level drop. They didn't seem that interested though.
I snatched it out of his hands.
Missing
I made my way down to the library, it was after sundown so I had to sneak in with the cloak, but it's not like that's anything new.
he replied with a grin, "
I stood up, leaving him a flustered mess on the floor.
The next three weeks passed in a blur.
, he wrote.
I entered the Hall and was hit with the severity of what was going on. I would never forget this. My life was short, Trelawney had always said so, but it wasn't 'til now that it sunk in. I was going to die. My only thought was I have to tell Ginny before it's too late.
I apparently didn't look away fast enough because he was quickly on his feet and tugging his shirt down to cover the mark.
He gave a small laugh,
She sent me a wink and shut the doors behind her. We looked at each other. I shrugged and walked to our table.
I rolled off the mattress, falling onto the person who had caused this mess. His face was an even brighter red, contrasting wonderfully with his pale complexion. I propped myself onto my elbows and stared down at him.
The headmistress's lips moved and the man interpreted what she was saying with BSL. Oh, that's why he was here.
"Goldstein?"
I cut his words off with my hands over my eyes.
If he was ever going to prove that he had changed this was the way to do it.
So, did I like him? Obviously, I had been consumed by that thought for weeks now. Did I want to date him? I don't think it would be that bad, to be honest. It would be like what we had been doing lately, just slightly... more?
"You did what?!" I was shocked. At the time I know it was wrong to be this upset about something like this. She wasn't handling it horribly, but my anger has always gotten the best of me. "If you weren't happy we should have called it off earlier! Merlin knows I didn't want to date you!"
He seemed conflicted about what to say next. I didn't miss the brief hints of shock and relief in his face. I had felt the same when I found out about him. There is something about knowing you aren't lone that's strangely comforting. Eventually, he decided what to say.
Ever since the war ended, people have been doing nothing but bashing those on Voldemort's side of the war. It's all well deserved, but the Malfoy's lay in a totally different sector. The media may like to write their tabloids, but in the end, the switched sides.
He slowly rose after being shaken for a solid three minutes. He yawned, pulling the curtains fully away as I got dressed.
This surprised me. What on Earth could he have to ask me about? Almost all of my life was printed and published for the world.
It had been three months of absolutely nothing. I sat in Number 12 Grimmauld Place and thought back on my summer. I should have known it would have been too much to ask for one relaxing break after finally leaving the Dursleys'. It wasn't all bad and at least I got to met with Ron and Hermione a few times a week. They used to come over all the time, but now they seem too caught up in themselves. Call me selfish, but I really needed somebody there and they rarely were these days. When they did come over it wasn't the same.
I felt a shift in the mattress beside me, Draco tapped my arm. "
I reached out to touch his arm,
Hermione sat up straight.
" His eyes had a sheen in them, I couldn't stand it.
Ron motioned for the quill.
she sent another one of those all-knowing looks that made me wonder how she truly did know so much about everything.
I was hit with much more than just a spell that day. The realizations and experiences that would put my life on a much better track than they had been for years also came. These would start as problems and would morph into the most amazing things that could happen to me. I needed that constant in my life. The edge of always being imperfect and different.
his mind was obviously not on the same path mine was.
He had already begun unraveling his scarf.
"I do too," he seemed to lift up a little, "tell you what. We'll go to Hogsmede this weekend and see how it goes. I swear though I will take you out for real one day, you can count on it."
He just made a low laugh and hung his head. "Yeah?
I was absolutely over-the-moon about last night. Nothing could change the fluttering feeling in my stomach on the walk back to the dorms and my smile as I fell asleep.
Draco reached up and put his palm on my cheek. "You know you can't do that, think realistically."
he turned to Hermione who glanced at us then quickly looked away. "Well, then let's be off Granger."
A million thoughts were whirring in my head the main one being: Oh shit, fuck, I just kissed Draco Malfoy and liked it, a lot. What on Earth had just happened?
He collapsed into a seated position and leaned against the shelves. I took out my wand and cast all of the books back to their places.
I couldn't believe it, what was in that note?
With a story a big as this one, it is important to have eyes everywhere, and it's a good thing we do. One of our esteemed reporters was stationed in muggle London, just out of the apparition point. Little did she know that two unsuspecting boys would appear and give her the biggest scoop in months.
----------------
With a sigh, he moved over towards our bed.  He sat on the edge and clasped his hands together in his lap.
He softened slightly, it was a beautiful sight. The sky was a murky grey, and the feel of people brushing my arms on the street made sure I knew I wasn't alone. It's times like these I really miss the ability to listen to my surroundings. My ears picked up a faint hum, but nothing more.
The leaves crushed under our shoes as we walked through the forest. We had no clue where we were supposed to be going, we were hoping for a sign.
he replied,
He took the package gracefully and began to unwrap it. I wasn't quite sure what to get him, I was pretty sure he had everything. Then I remember back when we were picking our classes, and he had a strange want to take Astronomy. So I went to the glass shop in Hogsmede and made up the perfect gift.
I headed down to Glenda Grizwald's Glassware, where I would spend the better part of my day.
he waved me over.  We were about a foot apart now, he leaned in a little, more like half a foot now. Slowly, he said, "Can you read them?"  I nodded.
And so, we read.
The article read:
You know, that might be awfully romantic. You crack away and leave-."
We sat close on the bench, no one was really out at this time, just dog walkers and couples on strolls of the city. A wind blew by, Draco put his arm on the backrest behind me, I leaned into his touch.
He crossed his arms and stood up. The two boys sitting in the room left us alone with a sideways glance.
I reached towards him and held his hand. "I'll be here all night if you need. Just say the word, and I'll never leave."
Shaking his head, he moved to the door.
Christmas Eve's plans don't start until late that night. I asked Draco to meet me in front of the school, he has no idea what's in store.
He was getting fidgety and I knew why. There was a lot that happened to both of us that we wouldn't want to talk to people about. I was kind of trying to answer those questions from earlier, but I didn't want to make him uncomfortable.
All other remains of the previous headmasters had been removed and the room was fairly empty. I noticed a desk and two chairs in front of it. In one chair sat Malfoy, his head resting on his arm as he waited. I sat next to him, across from McGonagall and a man I had never met.
We walked in comfortable silence for another half-hour or so. Then we saw a faint blue glow coming from ahead.
Draco waved us along.
We were seated like any other night. Across from each other in a familiar aisle of the library. Yet, the atmosphere had never felt more different.
The little girl then proceeded to place her hand over her heart, and her other on top of that. "
I looked up to Draco.
He must have seen something I didn't, because his expression soured quickly.
(I proofread this as I went, so sorry if there are any mistakes)
My hand. He was touching my hand. Oddly I didn't mind it as much as my mind was telling me to. Oh well, it's fine.
I signed after the initial shock had worn off,
He sat in silence as I finished reporting what I had seen in the forest. "
I noticed some people were already asleep. It seemed lucky that Seamus and Dean were at the end so they could easily sneak over to each other in the night. Not many people knew about them, the 90s were not a very supportive era, even in the Wizarding World. G-..... Some people had made that
I cringed at his choice of words as I wrote back.
Draco and I sat across from each other at our usual spot in the library. It was well past midnight now, it had taken quite a while to get there and come back.
I really wasn't that late, but to him, it seemed to be like I had just compromised the most dangerous mission of his life. And I
"Hey, Ron! Care if Malfoy joins us for class?" I didn't turn around to see his expression. "No? Ok great," and then I hoisted Draco off the ground and walked towards the classroom.
That's how I found myself desperately roaming the perimeter of the Black Lake, a map in one hand and my gift in the other. I was glad I had gotten him something small, my arm was already growing tired.
I looked over to my right after getting up off the ground, to see green curtains closed around a bed. I ripped them open and tried shaking Draco awake. He sat up and gave me one of those half-hearted glares. I shrugged my shoulder in return and went into the bathroom to get ready.
"I'll look forward to it." He leaned back and I noticed the fatigue from earlier set in. "But first, we need to get you to bed."
"Hey, it's ok. I'd love to go to Hogsmeade with you even if we don't know as what yet. I like you, like a lot." There I said it, proud of me?
"It's about Voldemort," she grimaced, "I need to go into the forest. Before you can stop me, this isn't up for decision, I just felt like you deserved to know... in case... you know," I trailed off.
--------------------
perceptive as always, "
We had to be careful because the backroom doubled as sleeping quarters for Madam Pince.
---------------
If I didn't know any better I might have said he asked just to make sure we really had broken up. I really was beating this thought into the ground, but I can't be the only one seeing this right?
I get that it was kind of required, but charms? Surely he had something better than that up his sleeve.
His fingers nimbly reached around my neck and tied the two pieces of leather together. The snitch hung down by my collarbone and glinted in the moonlight.
Muggle Studies was a mess.
this intrigued him.
Draco asked as we walked to Muggle Studies.
Afterwords Draco took his notes and duplicated them. He handed them over after making a small comment about how mine were impossible to read, then swiftly left me standing in the hall.
He obviously had no clue what we were saying, but he probably was predicting the worse.
We stared at each other, unsure of who would break first. The tension was so tangible I could have cut it with my fingers. Then a single tear fell down her face.
Though he was pureblood and fancy like that. Maybe it was customary or maybe he hasn't had much experience with writing letters to friends? No, that can't be right. He's definitely written formal letters before.
Draco signed back as he tried peering over Mr. A's shoulder.
It was very unclear as to what the boys were up to, but it was clear that foul-play may be involved. Although the interaction seemed harmless, it was anything but. In the image below you can clearly see the boys participating in explicit homosexual activities (BOTTOM LEFT). As we have covered, the-boy-who-lived most definitely shows an interest in the opposite sex, so why would she turn down this abnormal path?
pissed at him. I get that he would want to know, but surely he understood that this was a very private topic.
Draco nodded and resumed his stance. This time he stood completely still, mind fixed in concentration. His body seemed to move before his mouth, and I watched as he screamed the words out. "EXPECTO PATRONUM!" I could almost hear it if I tried.
I rolled my eyes.
"Ladies first, Malfoy."
I wish I had been right.
He stepped closer and his face was almost as red as his hair.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "
She was starting to look concerned and I didn't want her to freak out so I started small, kinda. "I think... I think I might, possibly, slightly, just a tiny bit like someone."
"Just take it." He looked up at me, eyes big at the moon, "Please?"
Back in fifth year, Ron and I made a list. (What can I say, it was a boring year.) Recently, I've been thinking about it more often.
I couldn't believe what she was saying. "And who might that have been?"
I shook my head.
So that was four out of the ten books that I couldn't find. Before looking further I decided to ask Hermione what she found. When I got to her I looked over her shoulder at her list. All five books were crossed out. She turned to me and asked the question I had been going to ask her.
He stood up and brushed off his pants. It was the first time I got a look at him, and I hate to say it, but damn he looked good.
I was getting a little frustrated, but I had to remember she really didn't know what happened.
I walked over to where Draco was crouched and sat back on my knees in front of him. He still looked shocked so I repeated my questions. When he shook out of his daze he sent me a glare. I didn't take it to heart.
He waved for me to go on. I think that maybe, sorta, kinda I slightly like this one person.
Thanks again. It means a lot," he nodded in agreement and I threw the book onto my pillow. I headed down to the common room. I had
No resources, no help, nobody....
It was a little weird though to have to sit by him and the front and watch Mr. A the whole time. His hands moved so fast I couldn't keep up half the time.
"Oh," he saw her die. She died at Malfoy Mannor, why didn't I figure that out. He didn't want to take Muggle Studies because he had to witness the old professor die, not because he had a simple grudge against muggles.
Funnily enough, I think I knew the reason.
he rolled his eyes.
Wait. If I can see the sun... then that means...
"Keep it down! If someone around here thought the same it would be chaos when this is over. You can't yell things like that in this era."
her gaze lingered on me,
I took my wand and snuck over to him. After poking him in the sides three times, he bolted upright and gave me the strongest death glare I had seen in years. I noticed Ron had left the room after shaking me awake. He probably was forced to wake one of us up and couldn't wait for food any longer.
We met up again around mid-afternoon. Draco didn't buy anything, but I guess I technically didn't either.
Mr. A didn't scare me, not in the slightest. He seemed like a kind guy who just happened to have some extreme features. He may have been tall, had dark eyes, and never smiled, but that didn't mean I would cower in his line of sight. This just felt weird, maybe I didn't know him as well as I thought?
after his name.
So, it was Ginny in the library. And she had seen everything.
I nodded, gesturing for the journal and quill.
He didn't laugh, "
Apparently, Blaise is extremely quiet, according to Ron which isn't saying much, and the only thing they had in common was quidditch which caused a very lengthy conversation. His main takeaway from the encounter was that his mom had had just as many husbands as he has siblings. Let's just say Ron didn't hate this conversation.
He tore part of the roof off, dripping with melted frosting and sprinkles, and bit into it. He made a face in between admiration and disgust.
Speaking of, I'd have to mention that to them. Then a thought occurred to me, "
We stopped at a park, much farther away than intended. Resting my hands on my knees panting I watched as Draco strolled past and touched one of the gates.
The box I was handing them felt so small, even though I was meant to be helping I felt terrible. With trembling hands, I passed the box to them. The mother gave a curt nod and silent thanks, then went back to her children.
"Oh, come on Ron! You know full well why I asked him and not you."
I didn't know how he would react to this.
I reached into my pocket and pulled out the map. After looking around I saw him walking towards the front entrance.
I took out Draco's old journal and quill and wrote to them.
I walked her over to Draco who was standing up from crouching by another box. He looked at me confused and I shrugged. I felt her shove the piece of paper into my hand.
Mr A translated for us. We would have been earlier, but we were held up slightly.
Ten minutes later he handed it back with a sigh, a new line written on it.
"I-" she gulped nervously, "I did. Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry." She turned to leave, but I caught her wrist.
liked that person or when they were in a relationship. Sure I'm friends with Draco, but that's it. Just friends. Not even great friends considering how new a development this whole thing is and our large history.
he looked around awkwardly.
He gestured to the middle of the page. There were the books we had been searching for, all in a row, all checked out on the same day by the same person.
I can remember that day clearer than any other in my life. It's ingrained in my soul and has defined me in more ways than one.
she signs, easing some of my confusion.
His hand found my cheek and I leaned into it. It was slightly awkward, but so were we so I think it fits.
I stood and reached out my hand to bring him up. He accepted and quickly retracted it, wiping his hand on his trousers. My hand gets cold now, like it was missing something.
Draco didn't seem upset. I had snuck up behind him and he was more amused than anything. I let go after a few minutes.
Almost everyone knew, better assumed, that Draco was in fact gay. Like I said earlier, he's fancy and pureblooded, so if he was gay, he would have had to hide that fact. The last thing we both need is for the
She laughed at my stunned expression.
The news of Fred's death had just happened, and I knew this wasn't a good time to be bringing up my inevitable death too. I was only telling the people that needed to know and my girlfriend seemed like one of those people.
And that's the story of how Draco and I broke up.
"It doesn't matter if you hate me or not, it doesn't change the fact I didn't want to tell you about it."
I sighed, this was never going to be easy. Think what you want, I'm going to bed.
I know I told Draco not to run from his past, but how do you run from a feeling.?
After a while I noticed Draco getting heavier, his eyelids drooping. I pulled back slightly, "Do you want to go back?"
They saved us, even though they had the opposite intentions.
Shit, today really wasn't going as planned.
"So, your mother is actually completely fine? Why would the media lie like that?"
He reached into his leather bag and brought out a short, thick blood-red book. On the front in stunning, monograms were the initials
There was one thing I knew. Mr. A was fast. He was probably middle-aged and he didn't seem like the runner type. I was running at full speed, going corridor by a corridor and didn't even see a hint of him being there. Hogwarts is a huge castle, so it's not like he could have left.
Operation "Make Amends with Malfoy" seemed impossible at this point.
So it was top-tier or anything, but it's always the thought that counts. After we finished eating, in silence, I decided to speak up. Sign-up? Anyways.
We had agreed to tell McGonagall to change Muggle Studies to History of Magic. She didn't have any problems with it, nor did she ask why.
I looked back over to him,
"Are you sure about that? I remember someone who you wouldn't shut up about all sixth year while we were together. I bet you fancied him instead."
Draco paused and tapped the quill to his chin. Then very quickly he wrote again.
What about you?
"An honour... from the famous Harry Potter, I'm touched." He snickered, I elbowed him back just as hard. He took the bag of chocolate chip biscuits without complaint.
I threw down the paper and rubbed my hands in my hair. I was livid. Draco saw my expression and ripped up the paper before spelling it away. He took hold of my hands, rubbing the knuckles gently.
I pointed to my ears and said "I can't hear what you said. I lost my hearing during the war," Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look. I couldn't read lips very well so I knew this conversation would be pointless. I was about to turn around and leave because the atmosphere became very tense. I couldn't help but wonder why Draco hadn't turned around yet. I would have thought he would love to torment me about this even if I wouldn't have been able to hear it. Pansy seemed to notice I was staring again and took a deep breath before gaining my attention and raising her hands.
"Slow and steady wins the race," I mumbled after him. He wouldn't have heard me even if I had yelled it.
Draco strode over to the bedside table, bumping my shoulder in the process. He picked up the potion and turned it around in his hands. I thought, in that moment, it might actually drink it. Instead he walked back over to me.
I sign back. I have to maintain eye contact but I glance over at Malfoy one last time before signing,
I turned onto my side when all of a sudden a hand slipped through the curtains. Inbetween the slim fingers, rested a folded piece of parchment. I was puzzled, of course, I knew the hand belonged to Draco, but why is he slipping me a note this late at night. Carefully I read it.
With a pained face, he signed, "
I rolled my eyes and tightened the cloth around my neck. It smelled like mint and was warm, maybe I would leave it on for just a little bit.
I have no problem with being gay. I mean I get it, well no, not like that. I mean, I understand why someone would be gay...  that doesn't make a lot of sense. I can see why someone would be attracted to men. They're attractive and much easier to understand and talk to. I've always found them more interesting than women. That doesn't mean I would date a guy! Maybe as a last resort... but I don't know where I was going with this thought.
We packed boxes up until our legs felt sore, and our hands were blistered. It was almost closing time, and the family from earlier was still sitting by the radiator and playing with the other kids from the centre. It wasn't until I saw one of them coming our way, that I noticed there were only four of them left.
That was it. If I had only taken that back, then nobody would have known.
-----------------
Her hair bounced as she shook her head. "
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. His eyes locked on mine and then down to his watch. In one fluid motion, he stood up.
I took a step forward, "You know what I mean."
