“We just got here.”
know that. That seemed like a pretty fucking large piece of information for him to not know.
“He wants his dog back,” Draco sighed, kicking his feet up and narrowly missing the lump of damp fur curled on the carpet next to the coffee table, heaving slightly. She’d been there since Draco had come down from his bedroom that morning, apparently having been let in by Pansy moments earlier to get out of the wretched weather. “Which is understandable, I suppose, but for now I’m using her as leverage.”
“I highly doubt it.”
At first glance, the clearing looked empty, save for an old splintered shed and an odd wooden structure that looked sort of like a miniature version of the house, shingled roof and everything. But then, as they drew closer, a figure appeared at the top of the porch. There was a flash of blonde, and then Draco’s view was obscured by another tree. Greg’s steps faltered.
“They’re just so precious,” Luna cooed, clinging to Neville’s arm to steady herself.
“Oh?” Draco asks, drowsy.
“Harry,” Hermione said again, lowering her voice. “What’s going on? You can be honest with me.”
“It’s good to see you,” she said to him, her voice now somewhere near his shoulder, and Draco was panicking. Panicking harder than he’d ever panicked before. Greg and Theo were staring at them like they’d both grown second heads.
Draco tipped his head back. “It’s more complicated than that.”
“I do. I don’t know how, but I do.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said through his teeth, stepping around an overturned lawn chair and coming to stand at the bottom of the porch.
The front door was almost completely closed by the time Harry lurched across the room and stuck his hand in the frame, stopping Draco from shutting it all the way. “Wait,” he said quickly, breathlessly feeling his stomach dip as Draco looked and reattached to his gaze. “Sorry, I just—”
“We hooked up twice,” Draco said, trying not to blush even though Pasny probably wouldn’t see it through the darkness. “That’s not—being
It was silent for a long moment, the room completely still. Then, soft enough that Harry had to strain his ears, footsteps sounded from somewhere in the apartment.
“No, no,” Pansy said, catching her breath. “I’ll stay back and use my own
“I’m already wearing a jumper under them!” Harry protested, holding his thermal-clad arms out. “And these are my
“It does,” Theo said. “Dogs who live around wizards can pick up on magical footprints pretty easily. Maybe she’s just been doing some exploring, or something.”
He slipped out of bed and pulled on his flannel trousers and his heaviest black jumper, sleeves falling far past his fingertips. His hair was a nightmare, but he didn’t want to waste time trying to tame it back, so he just grabbed an elastic hairband and pulled the longest locks out of his face.
“Do I mind,” Draco repeated senselessly. “Do I
“Hey!” Harry tried again, stumbling as his feet landed on the cold wood floor. “Phoebe, you daft dog, wake up! Intruder!”
“We haven’t seen him,” Hermione cut in, sitting up on her elbows. “I did see Phoebe wander off in that direction a few minutes ago, though, and knowing her…” She trailed off, pointing past Harry’s shoulder to the northernmost part of the orchard, where the red streamers and string lights narrowed down into a path that veered off into the surrounding woodland.
“I just…” Harry’s thumb was resting on Draco’s cheek, fingers holding to the back of his neck. He moved, brushing the pad of his thumb up Draco’s cheekbone. “I can’t really believe this is happening. That you’re letting me do this.”
Draco slid the card towards him. “This is happening.”
“Not my problem,” Harry told her before trying to sneak another swipe at his drink, but Hermione pulled it even further out of his reach.
“Clearly,” Malfoy said, and Harry’s shoulders tensed.
There was a sharp intake of breath, and Malfoy’s face hardened like marble. “No,” he replied, low, through his teeth. “Unfortunately, it’s only the four of us including Pansy, not that a reunion wouldn’t be an absolute treat. Perhaps you should arrange one? I’m sure McGonagall would be pleased to host.”
“Fine,” Harry spat.
Harry’s mouth twitched up. “That it was.” Except he didn’t know what to do next. Should he open the door? Should Draco open the door? Should they both go for the handle and see who gets there first?
“Harry,” she began to chide, but then she didn’t get a chance to finish her thought because, like an angel descending from heaven, a sleek black cab slowed to a stop in front of the curb and the driver’s window rolled down.
Luna reached a toe out and poked at the lump of blankets. Nothing happened.
Jaw unhinged, Draco picked up the card. Sure enough, a brief, noticeably informal dinner invitation requesting was scribbled in orange ink across the postcard. In the corner near the signature was a small, crude doodle of what looked to be a frog in a bowtie holding a serving platter, no doubt drawn by Lovegood herself. “Merlin’s balls,” Draco said.
“Straight people,” Harry agrees. He drops his hand and blinks weighted eyes at the ceiling above, the weathered boards above their bed white-washed and sagging towards the middle. “I think she and Ron spent the night before their ceremony together, though. So we’re not that radical.”
Harry was at the sink, rinsing the dishes from dinner so he wouldn’t have to the following morning. A plate clattered as he dropped it into the metal basin, and he tried focusing on that instead of the waver in Malfoy’s voice. “About what?”
“Okay,” says Draco. Harry can’t get enough of the tenor of his voice, the tangle of his accent so early in the morning. “It’s in the countryside. Scotland, maybe, or Ireland if you’d prefer. There are willow trees in the front yard and a long driveway that goes uphill, far away from the main road.”
“Huh,” Harry said. “Never been to Ireland.”
“No,” Hermione said quickly, seeming to sense the panic in Harry’s voice. “No, nothing like that. There’s more nuance to it. I was thinking of it more like a magical parallelism—your life and Draco's life have been running alongside each other for years, but you’ve been separated by a vast gap of time and circumstance. Phoebe was acting as a bridge to that gap. Does that make sense?”
“Even if there was a way, do you honestly think they’d listen to us?” Theo had challenged, holding his arms out. “We’re not exactly friendly faces over there.”
“I absolutely can, and I absolutely will.”
There was an alley right around the side of the bar—the same one that they’d Apparated into not two hours earlier—and there was also a long, open strip of wall that Draco found himself pressed against in the blink of an eye. And then there was cool brick against Draco’s lower back, then more heat, more hands, more lips, and he tried with all his might to get green eyes and cherry stains out of his vision as his head tipped back and his eyes slid closed, but still the name clinging to his tongue was one that certainly did not belong to Theo.
There was a collective groan, followed by a deep sigh from Potter as he folded Granger’s letter in his hands and stuffed it into his back pocket. Something strange and hot writhed in Draco's chest—something that made him want to get up and apologise to Potter—but he didn’t know what for.
Harry stepped forward onto the bottom stair, gaze now fixed steadily on Draco. His hand was gripping the railing, knuckles painted ivory, evidence of his present anxiety. “There’s always been an ‘us’, Draco. You know that,” he said quietly, and now he was the one who was wrong, because Draco certainly did
“Is nothing our business?” Harry asked him tiredly.
“Brilliant,” Potter said, and then he was gone again, disappearing into the kitchen, leaving Draco and his friends to the painfully earnest faces of Lovegood and Longbottom.
The sun-soaked warmth of the wood beneath Harry’s legs began to spread, seeping up to his chest and outward towards his fingertips. “Draco.”
Phoebe simply stared at Harry, tail swishing back and forth.
All Harry could think of was Draco.
“Far from it,” Harry mumbled to the table.
“Forcing, actually. I gladly won’t do it if you don’t want me to,” Harry offered.
The only other time one of them had shown up without an invite had been the week before the previous Christmas; Harry had heard a faint knock on his front door and opened it to find Hermione standing on the porch, cheeks smudged with wet mascara, arms wrapped around herself.
“I—yes, I remember you.” Theo swallowed and dropped his hand, drawing it close to himself as if he’d just touched dry ice. “From Hogwarts.”
Then Harry saw him.
“No. But I’d still like my dog back, please.”
Draco frowned back. “You’re the only one not back at the house.”
“Is Phoebe coming?” Luna asked from her place in the passenger’s seat, twisting to look through the rolled-down window.
“I’m done with this one,” she said to Harry after a while, breaking the soft tune and climbing back down her ladder, basket already half-full. Harry shot her a thumbs up, then watched as she picked up one of the apples from her basket and bit into it thoughtfully.
He looked the other direction, feeling wild and on-edge without his wand in his pocket. The only thing he saw was the small, speckled dog running towards him, seemingly unbothered by the noise, stick hanging out of its mouth all lopsided and dragging in the grass. Draco thought that dogs were supposed to be terrified of loud noises like that, but this one didn’t seem to have a care in the world other than what was in its mouth. Which was a good philosophy, he supposed, if you were an animal that walked on all fours and didn’t have opposable thumbs.
“Are we going the right way?” Draco asked, bending a rogue branch out of the way so it didn’t slap him in the face.
“See,
his mind whispered.
“As far as I know, yeah,” Harry confirmed through a mouthful of pomegranate and feta salad, plate balanced on his knees. He was sitting in his favorite velvet armchair, Luna on the couch, Neville in front of the fire. They always had to have a fire.
“Meaning that there are wizards living next door?” Draco asked, tilting his head back to look up at Theo over his shoulder.
“Oh,” Harry said, blinking, realising that he hadn’t seen Phoebe since he’d woken up that morning. “Yeah, she can. Let me go check the house really quick. Nev, can you get the car running?”
“Stop! Stop
Harry felt a smile tugging at his lips as he watched them. He wasn’t sure if he decided to love them, or if he decided to love Ron and Hermione, or Ginny. It wasn’t a decision, he didn’t think. Not a conscious one. But, theoretically, if it
With a dull pang in his chest, Draco figured that’s how they’d refer to everything, now. Not horrible, not spectacular—just nice. Liveable; manageable.
There was no possible reason. None.
“I was!” Harry exclaimed. “Until I saw bloody Malfoy playing fetch with my bloody dog on the bloody property next door.
“She agrees with me,” he informed Luna over his shoulder as she came back out holding Phoebe’s ceramic food dish filled with kibble.
The kettle began to sing its high-pitched song, and he turned his attention to it and started fixing two generous cups of tea, adding a load of milk to his own while leaving Luna’s untouched because, somehow, she could stomach it plain. Mugs in hand—one dotted with little hand-painted daisies, the other shaped like a curling head of cabbage—he bumped the screen door open with his hip and came out onto the porch, calling for Luna to come and get hers.
Somehow, every other triumph of the world seemed to crumble into ash with those words.
Without anything more to say, Harry bit the fleshy part on the inside of his cheek and turned away, nudging Phoebe along with him as he opened the back door. It wasn’t raining anymore. Goyle stood at one end of the porch with his watering can tipped into a window box of drooping tulips. He glanced up, then immediately back down, his entire body tensing as Harry passed him; there didn’t seem to be any liquid coming out of the watering can.
The next part could be easy. It could be so
“Phoebe!” Potter called suddenly, voice pitching up a whole octave, and the dog jumped up and barreled towards the window.
Hermione gave him a look. “This really couldn’t have waited until tomorrow?”
“You’re being weird,” Harry told him. “Like, extremely weird.”
“It’s nearly three.”
“I had a crup when I was younger,” Theo replied. “Same thing.”
“Right,” Harry jumped in suddenly, realising that this was going to be disastrous if he didn’t say anything. Drawing himself up, he stepped away so his back wasn’t facing the Slytherins and started again. “Right, um, sorry, I hope neither of you mind, but I sort of invited them along because your owl came when we were having dinner, so it seemed kind of rude not to—”
“Did you feel that, too?” a voice called over Draco’s shoulder, and he turned to see Theo pushing through the back door and coming out onto the porch, forehead creased with concern.
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry repeated, slow and scathing, “stole my dog.”
be wizards and
Draco didn’t want to talk about this. “It’s complicated,” he said again, firmer this time before changing the subject. “Do you have any wine? Red, specifically?”
“You’ve been getting the letters, too?” Greg had asked Draco tiredly, the bags under his eyes making him look shadowed and bruised.
Harry felt sick.
The ceremony was small, the reception even smaller; only immediate family and close friends stayed behind after the festivities to eat dinner and cut into the tall, wobbling wedding cake that Molly had insisted on baking herself. The lawn was dotted with mismatched tables and chairs, some of them shoved together to make larger tables; fairy lights and dark red streamers of tulle draped from tree to tree and along the banister of Harry’s porch, cloaking the whole evening in an effervescent sort of dream. Harry’s job as best man was to float from table to table making small talk with the guests, which wasn’t an issue given that ninety-five-percent of the guest list was made up of Weasleys. The Slytherins had also secured invitations, but fortunately enough, Harry didn’t have to worry about them getting into spats with any select redheads because Luna and Neville managed to keep them occupied the entire time.
“Hello,” she said in that floaty way that only she could, smiling, shallow dimples creasing her pale cheeks.
“I—yes.”
“I love your hair,” Parkinson said after a still beat, smiling as she did so. “How do you get it to braid that way?”
On the contrary, she had everything to do with it. “Your wards?” Harry asked.
As he walked, dry leaves and broken twigs crunching under his feet, his wand quivered in his palm and swung a bit towards the East, guiding him down an even smaller branch of the overgrown trail. He wasn’t that far from his property yet—he could still see the dark panels of his French-style farmhouse through the trees—but he was far enough that the canopy was thick and dark above him, blocking out the light. Sheer frost blanketed every tree and bush, cold wind tumbling through the papery leaves, brushing Harry’s skin, making him shiver.
That didn’t mean Harry liked it. He hated it, really, but he was trying to come to terms with the fact that this was out of his control. That the Slytherins were part of his life now.
Harry exchanged a look with Luna; she met it apologetically, her brow creased and creating a small dip down the center of her forehead. “Yeah,” Harry responded slowly, leveling his gaze back on Malfoy’s bowed head. “We didn’t either.”
Harry nodded. “The goddess of light, I think.”
“You have to get through the hard stuff to get to the nice stuff,” she pointed out gently. “You should talk to Draco.”
“Hey!” Draco protested, then stopped himself when he realised he had absolutely no qualms about his cherries being stolen. Taking his pause as an evident go-ahead, Potter grinned and popped the chemically-enhanced fruit into his mouth, teeth flashing white in the shifting low lighting. Draco snorted at him. “Those are artificial, you know.”
“No, not yet,” he said, peeking into the open hatch. Inside, a small puddle of soft, yellow tufts wiggled around, their tiny needle-like beaks poking skyward. There were four of them, two mottled with specks of brown, the others with white highlights running down their backs. “Do you have any in mind?”
“Kettle’s all yours,” Draco said, waving his hand.
At the bottom of the slope was—to his slight surprise—a river. Or, rather,
“Probably.”
“I feel like I should start charging you rent,” he told her one hazy evening after the Slytherins had said their goodbyes and stumbled out the front door, Malfoy’s arm around Parkinson’s shoulder, Theodore Nott humming “Pinball Wizard” off-key under his breath.
“No, I’m not. Why the fuck does it matter?”
“Elaborate?” He felt Neville’s shoe poke him in the shin, and he lifted his head reluctantly. Took a breath.
“Yes, well, my mother was quite set on me being a housewife,” Parkinson replied, rolling her eyes skyward and sinking back into her chair. “I think she was even hesitant to send me to Hogwarts, let alone university. She didn’t want me to be ‘indoctrinated.’ A witch’s role is in the home, after all.”
Harry blew air through his nose. “Yes, I do, just—not right now.”
while thinking of Luna, then closed it again after reading the words, “Go on with what your heart tells you, or you will lose all.”
He sat up stalk-straight in bed, pieces of his dream falling apart in front of him, the back of his head banging into the mahogany headboard and making his vision go a fuzzy shade of grey. “Christ,” he cursed aloud, raising a hand to rub gingerly at the base of his skull and blinking the dark blotches from his eyes. It took him an admittedly long moment to get a grip on his surroundings; the wavering image of his bedroom swam in the bright liquid light of the morning, the windows across the room glowing yellow and overexposed.
“I can leave if you’d like. I just woke up early today so figured I’d come meet you early, too.” She fell back on the bed, mattress bouncing again, and rolled her head to look at him. “Aren’t farmers supposed to wake up really early?”
“We think it’s got to do with our wands,” Theo had said, rubbing his eyes and sounding twenty years older than Draco had last seen him. “The Ministry’s been tracking us. The letters have got to be from them. Ministry workers.”
“You’re even worse than I am,” Harry said into his ear, astonished, to which he received a valiant “fuck off” and a sharp twirl that nearly sent them flying into Bill and Fleur.
And he did. He took the rest of the weekend off, slipping into his favorite pair of slouchy joggers and making a nest of blankets on his sofa where he could burrow for hours at a time. It felt strange not to work on pruning the orchard or re-fertilising the soil in the herb garden, but the idea of doing either of those things was daunting even despite the strangeness.
“I thought so.” Luna turned again, gaze re-settling on Draco. Nothing in her expression shifted, while Draco could feel his entire body tense, bracing himself for the worst. Maybe a punch in the nose, maybe worse. But all she said was, “Draco Malfoy,” tipping her head slightly in greeting.
“Well,” Draco started, clearly trying to think of something to say that wouldn’t end the evening on an awkward note. “I guess this is it.”
Draco scowled as he shucked his jacket off, flinging it over the back of the floral-patterned couch before collapsing onto it. “He’s come to terrorise us.”
“Try a spell.”
you to tell me. Please. Or I might go do something incredibly stupid.”
“So my offer still stands.”
he thought.
“Oh my god,” Harry said, head thunking against the mattress as he let it fall back. “I'm losing my mind.”
They’ll survive without you, I promise.”
Pansy’s hand stilled, then she put two fingers under his chin and lifted it so their gazes met, serious and shadowed. “Then don’t let it.”
As he was turning back to continue staring probingly out the window, something small and round pinged sharply off the glass. He startled, jerking backwards so his back hit the bedpost, startling the dog as well and making her head lurch up. The noise came again a moment later, so Draco approached the window and looked down to see Potter staring intently up at him, a collection of small, dime-sized pebbles clenched in his hand.
Harry was stunned. “Are you saying that Draco and I… are, like, soulmates?”
“It’s possible,” Harry said, though he wasn’t sure how interesting a bunch of overgrown bushes could be. When he said this out loud, Neville gasped in offense from the backseat.
“Come to bed,” he says after breaking away and landing delicate kisses on the corners of Harry’s mouth, his smile lines, the space between his eyebrows. Harry lets him, content to lean back and lose himself in the warmth and familiarity of it all. The homeliness.
“They should be standard.” Malfoy eyed the array of runes distastefully. “I can’t believe they’re this small. The Manor had an entire room dedicated to wards.”
“Of course it’s your business! Phoebe certainly seems attracted to them.”
The tip of his wand lit up silver, and he slowly began to trace a small diamond shape against the dimpled brick, restoring the faded rune and making it pulse brighter than the rest. “There,” he said when the chant was finished and the diamond was whole, pulling his wand away. “That should’ve done it.”
“Harry,” Luna said for the fourth time, but he brushed her off.
“It will if you try hard enough.”
“What?” Harry said blearily, reaching up to touch his hair absently. Sure enough, a couple of dry, crunchy leaves were caught in his wild nest of curls, clear evidence of his trek through the woods and his hasty, uncoordinated Apparition. “Jesus Christ,” he said, closing his eyes and trying with every muscle in his body not to lose it.
They moved back to England the next day.
Then—out of all things that could
“Yes, but—”
to them.”
Luna stood. “Harry,” she started.
“No, no, get down,” Draco hissed, trying to swat her away. “Down!”
.” Draco propped himself up on his elbows, glaring pointedly at Pansy. “We’re about to spend an entire evening at a nightclub with Potter’s friends, all because of you. It would’ve been so easy to not say anything, but you just
“Call someone,” Harry suggested with fake politeness, then pointed at the door. “Out.”
Someone bumped into Theo, forcing him forward into Draco’s space and making their feet knock together. They were almost exactly the same height. “You heard me,” Theo said, pitching forward to speak directly into Draco’s ear. His breath was hot and damp and all too familiar. “You look good tonight. Like, unfairly good. I was hoping I could coax you into a round or so with me, for old times’ sake.”
“I am.”
“Do you have any idea what time it is?”
“A few times,” Malfoy answered, ducking his head and blinking against the thin purple haze of the bar. “We spent some time in Dublin a year or two ago and went out nearly every night. Irish nightlife is surprisingly exuberant.”
He thought more than once about going downstairs and reopening his Floo for the first time in months so he could call Luna and ask her to come over. She would know what to do. She would help talk him down and stroke his hair and tell him everything was going to be okay, and he’d believe her. He also thought about calling Hermione, but calling Hermione would mean calling Ron, and Harry couldn’t talk about these things with him. He couldn’t talk about boy problems.
“Would you like to go back to sleep?”
His house felt suddenly quiet without their voices. Suddenly cold. The windows outside were completely black, lying in wait.
Malfoy didn’t look away, even as his pale hand slid suddenly into the dusty locks of Nott’s hair and let his head roll back further. Even as his legs shifted and a strained noise echoed off the dull brick. Even as Harry’s limbs turned to jelly and his heart started beating out of his chest.
Legs feeling like jelly, he sunk down to the ground and sat roughly on the curb, all his weight lumped against the base of the lamp post. He couldn’t handle this. He was drunk, his stomach in knots. He needed to go home.
had been the only line. No address, no signature.
Malfoy straightened up, and his head got caught in a wedge of light cutting in from over the top of the slanted roof, and his hair glinted like it thought it was a pearl, or a diamond, or—or something else obnoxious and sparkly. A disco ball, maybe. An annoying, pointy, pale-faced disco ball that was
.” His knuckles were flushed reddish brown. He wondered if his face looked the same.
“None of your business,” Malfoy stated, attempting to emulate Parkinson’s cold tone but falling short.
Harry lifted his head, unsure if he’d heard her right. “Sorry, did you say engaged?”
“Yes,” Draco replied, blinking and feeling deeply unsettled. He steadied himself by grabbing onto the bottom post of the porch railing. “What in Circe’s tits was that?”
“You should really be thanking me,” Pansy sing-songed, unfazed by Draco’s harshness. “You’re going to get to see him drunk, after all. Isn’t that, like, your number one fantasy? Getting him drunk?”
“I know.”
Draco’s stomach fell so fast he could almost hear it thunk against the ground. All around him the atmosphere tensed; the wind seemed to stop blowing, the birds seemed to stop chirping.
Over the bridge, there was a slight fork in the trail where an even skinnier footpath led up into what looked like a rocky cove surrounded by oak trees, but Harry’s wand swung in the other direction and took him even further along the stream, away from his house. He would have worn his hiking boots if he’d known he was going to hike this deep into the woods. He must have been walking for a solid fifteen minutes by the time he came upon a dilapidated, moss-covered fence, half-sunken into the springy dirt and overtaken by plaited ivy. Still, his wand urged him forward, so he placed one hand on the top rung and vaulted over, feeling the cold tingle of wards slide down the back of his neck as he did so.
Malfoy wet his lips, then looked away. “Yes.”
“It’s fine.” Harry lifted their clasped hand and pressed his lips to the back of Draco’s. “Don’t apologise.”
For now, that felt like enough.
“Phoebe?” he called into the yard, squinting his eyes against the weather, but there was no response. He tried whistling after that, drawing further towards the center of the clearing, but it was no use.
“Multiple times.” Pansy spun away from the mirror, feathery earrings swinging wildly around her cheeks. “How do you like this one?” She brandished her arms down her dress, black and thin with a silvery belt cinching the waist and long, belled sleeves.
“Sounds good.” He stopped, propping his own ladder against one of the bigger trees. It was skewing towards the end of the harvest season, December looming dark and chilly right around the corner, so the branches weren’t as heavy with fruit as usual. They were still plentiful enough to fill up a couple of crates that could be shuttled to the farmers’ market in town, but the bulk of the orchard had already been harvested earlier that month—with Neville and Luna’s help, of course. Harry couldn’t imagine picking the whole crop on his own.
,” Harry objected, even though he absolutely had been. “And nothing’s going on there.”
Harry smiled back. “I’ll do my best,”
don’t break anything.”
Draco opened the bottom drawer next to the fridge. “Oh, just the fact that you’re living alone on a huge piece of property while selling apples for a living. That doesn’t exactly scream ‘I’m poor’ does it?”
Draco rummaged loudly through the drawer, pots and pans clanging together. “That’s none of your business.”
Draco considers. “No, no fence. Just trees and grass and maybe some flowerbeds, if you ever learn how to garden.”
“For fixing our wards.”
Potter’s eyes blew wide, as did Draco’s. “We are?” Draco found himself asking, voice pitching much higher than necessary.
Luna and Neville understood—of course they understood—and told him graciously to get some rest, to hydrate. Luna also sent him a container of vegan noodle soup and a small bottle of mint essential oil, instructing him to use it in the bath to relieve any headaches or congestion, because she was the best person Harry knew.
river that ran alongside the main road and had runoffs all over the area, between the hills and through the clumps of forest. This particular stream was barely three yards wide, clear and bubbling over the jagged riverbed, white and foamy around the edges where it splashed up against the rocks. Down the stream was a rickety-looking bridge made of dark, damp spruce, stalky water reeds sticking up through the slats, and Harry silently cursed himself for never exploring this part of the property.
“What—” Potter began to ask, but was cut off by the noisy arrival of Theo holding a clinking platter of more drinks, as if they needed more to begin with.
“Why should I?”
“Was that—?” he started, then shook his head. “No, nevermind.”
Harry closed his eyes and tipped his head back for a fleeting moment, willing his pulse to slow back down. When he opened them again, he had to blink to adjust his eyes to the bright, rising light of the morning, then remembered faintly that he had glasses that would help with that. Dropping his wand back onto the nightstand, he fumbled around for them, hands trembling slightly as he jammed them onto his nose and waited for the blurriness to slide away. When it finally did, he refocused on Luna—or, rather, the intruder.
played loudly in the living room.
Harry blinked. Half past six in the
The lump remained motionless, content to keep on snoozing. Harry wanted to scream at her, but he knew that would draw attention to his bedroom, if his bumbling footsteps hadn’t done so already.
"Are you sure?"
“Why the fuck would she go to him like that?” Harry asked wildly, slumping down in his dining chair and feeling his jumper ruck up against the wood uncomfortably. There was probably going to be a red crease across his lower back later, but he couldn’t muster up the strength to care. The sight of Draco Malfoy had knocked it all out. “Why—how fucking long has he even been there?”
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. “She’s been ‘assisting’ me by wandering into the Slytherins’ yard for the past three months?”
“Agreed,” Harry said emphatically, digging his nose into her neck and squeezing her so tight she squealed a little. When she pulled back, her grin spread even wider.
There was a long, cumbersome beat of silence, broken only by the slosh of wine Longbottom began pouring into an array of empty glasses. It was awkward. Incredibly, painfully awkward, so much so that Draco wanted his seat to open up under him and engulf him into a black hole—one that took him far, far away from this living room.
fucked up, is it?”
Malfoy’s face darkened, and he rolled his shoulders back so his chest puffed up. “Not in the ways that matter to you, apparently.”
Harry put his hands over his face again, like he couldn’t bear to hold his own head up. “I don’t plan on it,” he said, muffled.
Harry blinked. “It—yeah, it is. She’s the goddess of light. The actual Phoebe, not my dog.”
It’s not that he was trying to notice those things—it just sort of happened. And then it kept happening, so much to the point where Harry just had to ask.
“Nice place,” Harry commented, and Malfoy shot him a glare before fiddling with the handle of a skinny door off to the side of the room. It took him a moment to get it open, the eggshell-colored paint sticky and unyielding, and he nearly stumbled into Harry once he finally got it unstuck.
“Okay,” Draco repeated. “Just this once. Outside. But make it quick.”
It wasn’t his fault, really—yes, maybe he should’ve stashed the spare key somewhere other than under the doormat, and yes, maybe he should’ve put better wards up around the house, but honestly? He couldn’t be bothered. The house on its own felt as secure as a prison—except it wasn’t like a prison at all. Not even a little bit. Quite the opposite, really.
“Can we have a dog?”
Cold fingers tug at the hem of Harry’s thermal, brushing his hip bones ever-so-slightly. The graze of a metal engagement ring ghosts the skin of his stomach. “Come to bed.”
And yet—somehow—someone managed to break in.
Harry couldn’t decide whether to stare at his dog or at the three nightmares from ages past sitting at his table. They were all looking at him as though he was a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at any moment.
Luna bobbed her head in agreement while Harry looked at Phoebe anxiously, her chin resting on Neville’s ankle, dozing lightly.
“Just a small one.
Theo shook his head, cutting Draco off. “I don’t know. I doubt it, but I don’t know. Could you go check on her, just to be safe? I want to walk the perimeter and find out where the wards broke.”
“I know!” he burst out, lifting his head. “I know, you’re right. I just—I don’t know how to ignore him. He’s like a parasite in my brain that just won’t leave.”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it again. He supposed Malfoy hadn’t been too horrible as of late, but he couldn’t be sure—spending so much time with the git could’ve warped Harry’s brain and made him think that Malfoy was being normal when he was actually just being a dick. Harry couldn’t trust his own judgment anymore. “I don’t know,” he settled with, slumping down on the end of his bed and nearly startling his half-asleep dog. “I don’t know why I’m asking, really.”
“And even if she isn’t your familiar, you do have a way with animals,” Ron jumped in, and Harry couldn’t help but feel disconcerted with the fact that he and Hermione had clearly discussed this topic between themselves before. “You form bonds with them that are, like, unbreakable. Hedwig and Buckbeak could’ve easily been your familiars, too.”
“I know, I’m sorry.”
“So,” Harry echoed breathily, mouth twitching a bit.
Theo raised his eyebrows as he grabbed his dark blue hooded jumper off the hook next to the door. “You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco cut him off, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “Really. I promise.”
“We broke up,” she’d said, voice cracking, and then Harry had enveloped her into his arms and stroked her hair, tight braids feeling course under his fingers.
“Yes,” Malfoy answered, unmoved. “We haven’t done anything illegal, so don’t get your pants in a twist, but we don’t want them to be aware of our whereabouts. We’ve been moving through different parts of the country for a while now, and Bedfordshire happened to be our next stop. That’s why we’re here.”
“Yep,” Potter confirmed, unlatching the window and budging it up to let a small, tawny-colored bird flurry inside. “Hermione’s.”
“After four fucking years.”
On Saturday, he woke up and decided that having to endure an entire dinner that evening with Draco in attendance would be the worst possible idea on the planet, so he sent a note to Luna and Neville telling them apologetically that he was under the weather. Reluctantly, after about an hour of staring at a blank piece of parchment, Harry copied the note and sent it to the Slytherins via owl, then felt immensely relieved when it returned to his window empty-handed. He didn’t think he could handle seeing Draco’s handwriting telling him to “get well soon,” or worse, making some snarky joke at his expense. He couldn’t handle it.
“Where’s Neville?” Harry asked after a stretched beat of silence, eyes fixed on the chipped paint of the door through the wire screen.
“Oh my god,” Draco choked, stumbling to steady himself on the trunk of a nearby tree so he didn’t get a faceful of dirt.
He didn’t think of Draco. Or, rather, he didn’t purposefully think of Draco. Somehow Draco still ended up at the forefront of his brain, his name stuck to the roof of Harry’s mouth like warm honey.
“Yeah,” Neville agreed, mouth turned down in a frown. “Me neither.”
Of course, it hadn’t been easy. Back when he’d bought it off a haughty-looking real estate wizard, the slumping groves and old, fragile house had seemed unappealing at first glance. But then—almost by accident—Harry had fallen in love with the place.
“I’m sick,” Harry said slowly, fingers tightening around the doorknob. “I sent you all a note. And why is it only you?”
“You’re still a piece of shit.”
“Right, because you’re so financially unstable,” Draco said disbelievingly. Then, “Where are your saucepans?”
“This cannot be real.”
Lovegood waved her hand to beckon them into the hallway, so Draco sucked in a breath and followed her into the next room, Pansy close behind him. Greg and Theo had yet to say a word, and now that he thought about it, Draco could barely hear if they were breathing or not. He wouldn’t be surprised if they weren’t.
Phoebe barked in the distance, and it wasn’t the kind of bark she did when she was nervous, or angry, or protective; it was her friendly bark. The one that she only ever used around him.
Potter’s eyes were villainously bright. “Am I?”
Draco’s shoes clicked subtly on the bare floor as he walked through the adjoining hallway, slowly taking in the drab beige wallpaper—faded and chalky, peeling towards the bottom—and the trampled carpet, patterned with stoic and sad-looking flowers. Somewhere ahead of him in the kitchen, a leather bag thumped against wood and a chair scraped loudly.
He held to the tree for stability, fingers digging into the bark and splintering his palms.
Malfoy squinted and bent closer, standing almost directly behind Harry. The smell of sage was overly pungent, like a thick, invisible cloud enveloping around Harry. “I don’t know what the last symbol is,” he started, “but I assume the first part says something ominous like
Harry knew what he meant by that.
“Is that Shakespeare for ‘no Apparating’?”
He walked to the end of the block, focusing only on his steps and the way his feet hit the solid pavement, afraid to think about anything else. Anyone else. Because if he thought about anyone else, he would think about Malfoy, and he didn’t want to think about Malfoy or the way his eyes flashed and his breath stuttered in the darkness.
He stilled. “What?”
He stopped, taking a breath.
“Do I have to?” he asks, unwilling to move from Draco’s arms.
“Yes!” Luna sat forward. “Last time I was here, their eyes weren’t open yet. They’d have opened by now, wouldn’t they?”
Pansy’s dark eyebrows sprang up as she pedaled her arms and moved closer. “I certainly haven’t.”
Harry snorted at her and shook his head lightly, not quite believing that this was his life. Now that he was fully awake, he could appreciate Luna’s energy in a way he couldn’t before; she seemed to light up the yard like she did every Saturday when she visited. She was about as welcome to the house as the fruit was to the trees; the walls brightened and the floorboards curved upward in a smile whenever she came around, as if the house was happy to see her. Harry didn’t blame it, even if she could be a bit much at times.
Harry blinked. “You what?”
“She probably did,” Harry reasoned. “She likes to let me figure things out for myself, though.”
“Right,” Potter said, breaking eye contact. “Right, yeah, of course. Sorry. I just—it’s clicking for me, now.” He glanced back up, almost furtively. “For what it’s worth, Hermione and I thought that rule was preposterous. Especially for juveniles. It’s on her political agenda to get it repealed, I think.”
“He left for a lecture,” Luna said quietly, waving her hand to float the barely touched cups of tea towards the sink. They clattered as they dropped in, and Harry abruptly felt bad.
“Draco from Hogwarts was a git,” Harry reminded him kindly. “But you’re right. Harry from Hogwarts didn’t exactly picture it either.”
“Half past nine, I think.”
“I know,” Pansy replied, “but you know how he gets. He can’t control it.”
“What the fuck have you been doing?” he demanded as he climbed down his ladder, his dog strolling towards him through the grove, ears perked and paws once again coated in mulch. It was a quarter past twelve, and Harry was attempting to be productive and prune some of his more troublesome trees. It was Monday—both Luna and Neville were busy with work and school—so he was on his own for the day.
“I know.”
A pause. Then, “I’m not giving your dog back until our wards are fixed.”
“I know.”
But Harry wasn’t worried. Together, he, Ron, and Hermione had been through worse. So much worse. He knew that no matter how secluded Harry’s life got, he would always have their backs, and they would always have his. That’s how they worked.
“Two...”
He looked back at Theo. “Someone would’ve had to Apparate to tear the wards, wouldn’t they?”
“I have no idea,” Harry said. Neville’s appearances at the house were a lot more sporadic than Luna’s, who came at least every Saturday, sometimes staying the night. Neville just tended to show up whenever he felt like it. Not that Harry minded; he was a huge help with the orchard and the gardens, always teaching Harry a new trick that would help his squash grow faster or his apples stay ripe longer. Harry picked up Luna’s mug and swished the now-lukewarm liquid around. “You still want this?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” he’d asked later on after guiding her inside and making her a cup of cocoa. She shook her head, so Harry let it be and went upstairs to make up the guest bed. She’d stayed with him for a full week, and Harry was happy to have her, but she wasn’t exactly in the right state of mind to be entertained; she’d just sat in front of the fire most of the time, staring at it, spaced out, some Muggle game show playing on the television.
“Well, not like dementors or giants or anything like that, but she could be getting at poisonous plants or berries, or something. There tend to be a lot of those in woodlands that aren’t regularly maintained. It’s probably worth checking out.”
whereabouts,” Pansy had corrected.
“Very much so.”
“Did I wake you?” he asks softly as the muted smell of citrus folds in around him.
Then the hand that Harry wasn’t using to steady himself on the railing was touching Draco’s wrist, but Draco didn’t know how it had gotten there or how long it'd been there. It felt like forever.
it whispered lowly, slithering through Draco’s train of thought.
“Absolutely not.”
Luna giggled, sunny, like a wind chime. “I saw her sniffing around the kitchen when I came in. I think she woke up before you did.”
“Home sweet home,” Draco agreed.
“I can do that,” Harry said, lifting his chin. “Draco.”
It was, in no uncertain terms, an evening to behold.
“Is it?” Potter asked, grinning wider when Draco scowled at him.
“You started it!”
“Jesus,” Harry said, rolling his eyes before hooking two fingers under Draco’s chin and planting a firm, silencing kiss on his stupid mouth. “You’re so lucky I put up with you.”
from you during your sentence.”
“You’ve lived here for two years, correct?” Parkinson asked him at one point, sounding just shy of genuine. There was something about her thick eyeliner and catlike expression that made him skeptical of her tone, even though part of him desperately wanted to believe she was being authentic.
“He’s being nice,” Parkinson cut him off suddenly, putting a hand up to stop him. “We invited ourselves because we haven’t gone to a pub in about half a year and he was too nice to tell us no.” She stuck her hand out amicably. “Nice to see you two again. Been almost five years, hasn’t it?”
“It just does!”
“Very weird,” Luna agreed. “Do you think she’s found some sort of undomesticated colony of pack dogs somewhere in the woods? That would be
He didn’t have a plan, of course. He never had plans, not ones that worked in his favour. But he knew he needed to be here. He knew it more than he’d ever known anything.
“Great, let’s do that then,” Potter resolved. “That way no one can use it. We could even bury it in the backyard, or something, maybe grow a tree.”
“Will come back at lunchtime like she has every day for the past week,” Harry cut in with a snarl, then immediately felt bad about it. He rubbed his eyes again, but the ache behind his brow bone was pulsing bigger and bigger with every word he spoke. “I’m sorry, Nev, that was rude. I just—I genuinely cannot believe this.”
“Oh my god. You did not just say that.”
Harry lifts his head and glares at Draco’s sleek, Cheshire smile. His skin is glowing slightly in the pool of pale, mottled light streaming through the bedroom window. “That must be why I’m marrying you, then.”
“Your dog,” Goyle clarified, sounding somewhat shaky. “Luna—er, Lovegood said she was the goddess of something. Her name, I mean. It’s Phoebe, isn’t it?”
Draco felt his lips quirk up as he replied shakily, “That’s a hard record to break,” but then Harry’s cold hand was on the back of his neck and they were kissing, and Draco’s words died on his tongue. Their noses bumped clumsily, Harry’s glasses digging into Draco’s cheek and definitely leaving a mark, but Draco had never cared less about anything in the world because Harry Potter was kissing him.
“But—”
“Clearly it is, if you’ve been playing musical chairs all over the country,” Harry disagreed. “Is that why you aren’t doing magic?”
to. And for what? What could you possibly think is going to come out of tonight?”
it was, I would just prefer it if you didn’t set me on fire, you dick.”
“Ugh,” Harry groaned, slumping down in his seat and letting his head loll back dramatically, hating that she was right. He wasn’t
The dog just stared at him, tail wagging slowly.
wild.”
“What’s going on with Draco?”
“Owl?” inquired Lovegood after setting a blue card on the top of the towering pile in the center of the coffee table.
good at fetch, and he would never be good at fetch. Not in a million years.
“I don’t
Harry couldn’t, so Eva had stood up and crossed the room to sit next to him on the dark grey couch in her office, looking earnest. “Harry,” she’d said, making eye contact. “I need you to know that I’m proud of you. And I’m sure your friends and family are, too, even if you don’t hear it often. I know they are.”
“I mean, children withdraw from their parents when they go through puberty, and she’s kind of like Harry’s child. You know?”
“Was that scripted?” Ginny asked him curiously from across the table after he’d sat back down, her chin in her hands, bright hair falling in ringlets around her face.
(for trigger warning) mentions of death threats are located below the page break after the sentence, "before he could stop and change his mind, he wound his arm back and threw it." a good spot to pick back up is at the sentence "for the next two years, the four of them lived like nomads..." hope that helps!
Pansy shrugged, sliding the note closer with her stiletto-shaped fingernail. “Read it yourself. It looks like it was written by Lovegood—there are hearts above the i’s—but it came from the address next door. They suggested this Friday.”
? Honestly, Potter.”
“No one said it had to be awkward,” Greg said, as if making that declaration would guarantee it wouldn’t be awkward.
A dark, disbelieving eyebrow quirked. “She’s perfectly fine, thank you. How’re your wards?”
“It’s not?” Pansy asked, eyebrows arching. “Whose is it, then?”
Not sure what else to say, Draco grabbed the first subject that popped into his mind. “How’s your dog?”
“You didn’t know?” Malfoy asked incredulously, sitting up in Harry’s favorite armchair. “How in Salazar’s name did you not know? My parents talked my ear off about university every chance they could. They were quite set on me studying economics at Oglidreth after graduating from Hogwarts.”
“You—” Draco’s heart jumped, something hot zinging up his spine. He could see the booth from where they were standing—more specifically, he could see Potter. But Potter wasn’t looking at him. Not that Draco was expecting him to, or anything. But. But what? “Okay,” he decided abruptly, pulling back to look Theo in the eye. Draco’s whole body was warm, warm, warm.
She didn’t elaborate, leaving Harry to contemplate that nugget of wisdom on his own. He sort of understood, to an extent—he loved the song, too.
“That’s… believable, actually.”
“Almost,” Hermione said faintly, reaching out to shake Pansy’s hand limply. Ron looked like he was on the verge of passing out next to her. Harry watched them carefully, terrified of the very real fact that this interaction could either make or break the whole night. Malfoy and Nott were both standing very still behind Parkinson, their faces bleached white amid the shifting electric light.
Now, he felt like a destination.
“I know.”
The handle was cool, coated in dust. Draco felt eleven years old.
Harry’s heart thumped. He felt dizzy all over again. “So soon?”
“Are you saying—Draco Malfoy lives next door? Is that—is that what you’re saying?” Neville stumbled over his words, sounding flabbergasted.
“Rendezvous in five?” Ron suggested, standing up after Hermione.
Harry was terrible at goodbyes. He’d been saying them all his life and he still didn’t know how to do them right. “I guess so.”
“I promise.”
“Yeah,” he told the cabbie a bit shakily. “They’re with us.”
Luna’s mouth twitched sadly. “You’re welcome.”
“You’re the worst,” Draco informed him. “And I love you, too.”
He felt something nasty flare up inside him. “You waited an entire week to return my dog to my fucking property?” he snarled, whirling to glare at the first Slytherin his eyes landed on, which happened to be Malfoy, because really, who else would it be?
“Yes,” Draco hums in his ear, voice low in the still hours of morning. “Prat.”
“Lame,” Theo grumbled from his place on the couch, then immediately lit up when he realised it was his turn. He slapped one of his last remaining cards down—a wild card, at that. “Aha! Uno, fuckers!”
How had she known? How had she turned the right corner in the middle of a thick, wild forest and found Draco waiting for her on the other side? And how had she known to keep going back?
Blood rushed in his ears. He was doing this.
She waved her hand. “Irrelevant. Have you come to save me from my damsel-like distress, o’ brave knight in shining armor?”
“Oh,” Harry said, mildly surprised. Phoebe didn’t usually wander off unless Harry was by her side, leading her through the winding rows of apple trees or down the packed dirt lane to the river at the bottom of the hill. She was a “grounded spirit,” according to Luna, one who went places and did things deliberately. Harry just thought that meant she was clever.
Confused and a little shocked, Harry stopped in the shade of a curving tree and drew close to it, unsure if he was trespassing on private property or not. The place looked abandoned at first glance, but when he squinted, he could see a thin clothesline swaying in the breeze, weighted with white linen sheets and patterned towels. He could also see a meekly gurgling fountain shaped like a mermaid not far beyond, nestled among tall patches of yellow-ish grass. Scattered pots of herbs and tomato vines dotted the yard, creating a short, wide path up to the back porch, one that looked nearly identical to Harry’s, furniture and everything.
“Wait.” Granger slid in suddenly, putting her hand down on the varnished table and interrupting them. “Hang on. Tell me again what happened. Phoebe started wandering off every morning right when they moved in?” At the word  “they,” she waved a limp hand at Draco and Pansy, still refusing to look at them head-on.
Another beat passed, this one much longer and much, much heavier. Harry didn’t know how they’d switched gears so fast, but that happened with Luna. You always started somewhere with her and then ended up on an entirely different planet.
“Good.”
“Merlin, Harry.” There was a scrape of ceramic against wood, signaling that Neville had stood. “I saved some of that tart for you, in case you’re still interested,” he said, suddenly sounding exhausted.
“Yeah, I think.”
Harry looked down at Draco’s hands, like he was surprised they were there. “Oh,” he said faintly. “Right. I am. Do you mind?”
“It is,” Draco agreed, propping his elbows on the windowsill. “You do realise that you could’ve fixed the wards about eight times around since you’ve been out there, don’t you?”
“People don’t tell you they’re proud of you very often, do they?”
“For forcing you to go with them to see Potter.”
Potter was standing with a stack of plates piled high in his arms, back arched slightly to keep them from slipping. Longbottom scoffed light-heartedly at the sight of him, dismissing his statement with a whimsical wave of the bottle opener. “Completely untrue. You asked us to be here.” He looked over his shoulder at Pansy and Draco and repeated, quieter, “He asked us to be here.”
Hermione gave him another look, her gaze dangerous and testing, so Harry let it go. She stood up from the fireplace and disappeared from the room for a moment, her footsteps retreating down the hall and most likely to their bedroom, then she returned with her arm wound around the waist of a half-conscious Ron. Harry felt horrible—waking Ron up was like waking up a sleeping dragon, and someone was bound to get a mouthful of fire.
“Yeah,” Draco said, nodding, then repeated it as if to reassure himself. “Yeah, I can do that.”
“Hello,” Harry replied, shaking his head slightly to reorient himself, but he couldn’t quite shake all of the haze away. “What time is it? How did you get inside?”
“Will people be mad at us if they find out we spent the night together?” he asks offhandedly, reaching out to trace the dip of Draco’s temple.
“Half past six,” she corrected kindly.
“So?”
“Thank you,” Theo said earnestly. “If there’s anyone here, I’ll find out. I swear.”
For the next two years, the four of them lived like nomads, travelling from city to city, house to house, never staying long enough to be recognised, never using magic. They worked at any and every place they could find, taking jobs as busboys and cashiers and grocers, scraping together their savings to pay their rent and keep their stomachs full.
“Sure,” Neville said, catching the lanyard of keys Harry tossed his way before he turned and half-jogged back up the hill, eyes peeled for his troublesome pet.
“Luna’s.”
“Why are they here?” Harry demanded, tearing his eyes away from Malfoy and staring at Luna instead. “Did you let them in?”
That’s the problem.”
“So, it’s settled,” Pansy jumped in suddenly, slapping one of her cards on top of Lovegood’s triumphantly. “We’re all coming.”
Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) no one from the dynamite trio of Gryffindors danced with them. They all stayed rooted to the booth, laughing and chattering loudly over the pulsating music and bending their heads together. When Draco looked at them, he hated them a bit, but only because their magnetic closeness reminded him of school. Not because they’d done anything wrong. It was hard looking at them, though. It only reminded him of how horrible he used to be—how he used to hate the three of them with every burning fibre of his being. And not just pretend hatred; real, actual, blood-boiling hatred that made him sick to his stomach to think about.
Luna considered, moving her delicate fingers to the other brownish chick. Her nails were painted orange and cerulean, chipped and mismatched. “Tyche,” she said decisively. “And the other two can be Paean and Circe.”
“She will,” Luna nodded, putting her feet up on the dash of the passenger’s seat. She was wearing socks today, thank Circe, ones with little multicoloured dinosaurs all over them. “She’s a clever dog. That’s odd, though, that she would be over there again. Do you think she’s found something interesting?”
“Because we didn’t know any better,” Pansy had sighed wistfully, her hair fluttering in the wind.
“Every day,” Potter said. His gaze flicked to Draco for a brief moment—so brief Draco might’ve imagined it.
Neville patted his shoulder sympathetically.
Sure enough, a young woman with long, coiling blonde hair and a floor-length cardigan was standing on the steps of the porch, looking very much like a matured version of Luna Lovegood, one hand shading the slanted afternoon sun from her eyes as she peered in their direction.
Feeling unsteady, Harry continued slowly down the thin brown path until it opened up onto a dipped clearing surrounded by elm and laurel trees, all bending inward towards the centre where a house not unlike his own came into view. It was two-storied, made of sun-bleached stone and stained clapboard, the roof slanted and stark against the soft curves of the rising hills. The windows were large and coated with chipped yellow paint, timeworn and sticky-looking, and there were clusters of ivy crawling up the sides and engulfing the building in dark shades of green.
“Not even a little bit, but your dungarees look much less horrendous,” Malfoy answered, folding his own arms against the cold. He was only wearing a thin collared shirt now, unbuttoned at the neck and slightly wrinkled around the shoulders.
He spun around, wand raised protectively, mouth open and beginning to curve around the word
“The house belongs to the Parkinson family,” Nott added after taking a curt sip of tea and setting down his mug—
He turned to find Goyle staring after him intently, stubby fingers as white as snow as they clutched the watering can. Harry was afraid he’d crush the thing if he gripped any tighter. “Sorry?”
me to pay you?”
“That’s exactly why I can’t. It won’t answer to me.”
“I thought he hated us?”
After at least fifteen minutes of walking, the path they were following began dwindling down into a barely-trampled line of greenery snaking through the overgrown underbrush, unused and wild. Whoever lived next door must have not liked hiking, either, because this part of the woods seemed to be completely overrun with weeds and serrated ferns.
Draco’s grin stretched, wicked and wide. “I’ll be right down.”
“Ready,” Neville confirmed, smiling and nudging a dreamy-looking Luna away from the chicken coop. He exchanged a look with Harry. “At least, I am.”
“And you sell your apples at a market? A grocery store?”
“Your magic,” Potter said, looking almost uncomfortable with the question. His fingers flexed around the chair. “Is it—are you not using magic because of your wand?”
,” he exclaimed, swiveling around and fixing Harry with an even more outraged scowl. “Warn a man, will you?”
“I don’t have to explain myself to you.”
“Yes,” Harry answered, giving up and slumping back in his seat. “It’s only, like, one guy though. I think his name might be Erwin. Or Edgar? Something with an E.”
“I, um.” Harry wobbled, and all at once his body decided that sinking back down onto the bed was the best thing to do in that moment. He loved Luna wholeheartedly, but it was far,
“I don’t want it either.”
“No, we didn’t have a motto,” Nott assured, stretching his leg out and kicking Malfoy in the shin with light reprimand. “He’s making that up. And rest assured, if we did have a motto, it would be far better than
his brain reminded him.
As Harry sidled up to the counter to begin fixing himself a pot of tea, he peered out into the backyard and took quick stock of the landscape. He spotted Luna just beyond the porch bent over the splintered wooden structure that housed Harry’s small collection of chickens, her yellow-blonde hair a beacon amid the deep greens and browns of the apple orchard. She was nearly hanging off the side of the henhouse, both arms reaching down into the hay-padded interior, one leg lifting behind her to keep her balance. She was still barefoot even in the wet, spongy grass. Harry felt a smile tug at the corners of his mouth.
Granger’s eyebrows arched, but there was something light in her expression that made a flare of hope spark and sizzle in Draco’s stomach. Something that might be mirth. “I don’t know, I’m rather enjoying this.” She turned to Potter. “Are you enjoying this?”
Draco flicked Harry’s knee as he pulled back, face a shade pinker. “I’m aware.”
“They’re inviting us out for drinks next weekend,” Potter relayed after pulling out a neatly-handwritten note and scanning it over quickly, fingers still stroking the owl rhythmically. Draco definitely wasn’t staring at that, either. “Friday, at a Muggle place near the university. We’ve been there before.”
Hermione shook her head. “Don’t apologise, you’re always welcome to pop into our fireplace. You should do so more often, really.”
“Harry Potter?” Theo asked from the kitchen, spoon clattering into his bowl of cereal.
Harry’s stomach dropped. “What? Why?”
“Those aren’t washed, you know,” he pointed out, ducking his head under a thick branch so he could see her better.
he thought, then did a mental double-take. If she wasn’t in the rain, that meant she had to be inside—with Malfoy. And Nott, and Goyle, and Parkinson, the exact people Harry did not want to talk to.
Nott’s chair scraped as he stood. Goyle followed, but stopped to nod awkwardly at Luna. “Thanks for the tea.”
he thought. It was real, and it was tangible, and it was more than Harry ever could have expected.
“That’s alright.” She propped herself up on her elbows. “I could make myself busy for an hour or so. Does Phoebe need a walk? I could take her around the orchard.”
“No,” Neville said slowly.
“Everything’s fine,” Draco assured, lips twitching up as Harry immediately reached for his hand and slotted their fingers together. “I needed some air, is all. Your ridiculous animal just happened to follow me out here.”
Harry dropped his arm like a deadweight, relief crashing over him. “Jesus
“So am I, and my answer’s still no. You shouldn’t have wards up if you can’t do magic.”
“Oh my god.” Draco thunked his head on the table, then lifted it to look pleadingly at Granger. “Can you make him stop? I feel like you’re the only one who can make him stop.”
Hermione set her purse down, falling quiet for a long moment. Harry glanced at her, then back at the bar where everyone else was still crowded. Everyone except—well. He looked back at the pavement and pinned his gaze on a small chunk of loose asphalt near his shoe.
“Are you sure you want it?” the real estate wizard had asked, frowning as he looked up from his odd little clipboard. He’d shown Harry the property more out of obligation than anything else, since Harry’s only request was that he wanted to be “out of the way”, and Eastern Bedfordshire had seemed to fit that requirement quite nicely.
Harry honestly didn’t know, but he trusted her. “Sure,” he said before taking a sip of his tea. He swallowed and pointed. “What about that one?”
Harry still didn’t know what was going on here. He did know that something had changed, though. Something significant, if not monumental. Something that had the potential to change the tides and sweep Harry down another channel.
They stared at each other a moment longer, the stirrings of a challenge brewing in the space between them. Stirrings that were both familiar and unfamiliar—charged with energy Harry recognised, but laced with something deeper. Something more intense.
Then, “I just knew.”
“Yeah?” She returned the grin. “Me too.”
Phoebe made a high-pitched whining noise that probably meant yes and shook herself excitedly. Harry squinted slightly and noticed a layer of dirt caking her paws and the tips of her fur. He frowned and bent down to get a closer look.
Draco blinked.
“Sorry.”
“You’re wrong.”
“Yes, but—”
Frowning, Draco took one sip, decided he hated it, then took another.
“I know.”
Draco must have felt it too, because his cheeks were dusted with pink when he lifted his head and met Harry’s gaze. “If that’s the case, we should probably start calling each other by our first names.”
Luna nodded. “You don’t need to explain yourself, I understand. But it’s been years—you shouldn’t turn them away that fast. Aren’t you curious why they’re here?”
But there was nothing there except swaying linen and rustling trees; the same ones that had been standing there since Draco had moved in almost a week ago.
Draco tripped.
“No,” Harry said.
Luna laughed and patted him again, this time on the forehead. Her fingers were cold and smooth to the touch. “Go to sleep, Harry.”
“This whole thing is a bit ridiculous,” Potter informed him.
“It worked,” he declared, opening his eyes to find Malfoy staring at him with hawk-like intensity. It was a bit startling—so much so that Harry accidentally noticed that Malfoy’s eyes were the same silvery color as the runes.
“So?” Potter challenged, sucking on the bright stem then discarding it into his napkin.
“What—does that even mean?”
“Hm.” She rolled back. “I suppose you’re not like most. You still want to go apple-picking today, don’t you?”
He also didn’t look Harry in the eye once, even though Harry could feel his gaze almost the entire evening like a white-hot laser on his skin, silently searing into him.
she was going, but he let her go anyway. It’s not like the Slytherins were harming her in any way, and no matter the conditions she always came back.
Potter’s mouth pressed into a thin line, his top lip sucking in. “I don’t know,” he decided after a beat, shoulders slumping. “I was just wondering. And I’m trying not to argue with you.”
“I would hope so,” Pansy said feelingly, coming to plop next to Draco on the sofa. “How long do you think he’ll stay out there?”
She looked up at Draco again, eyes bright. “Yes, exactly.”
