Harry smiled sadly, “Yeah. I’m actually going to miss you too.”
Harry wasn't sure what response he was expecting from Draco when he told him that Scorpius was with Astoria, but climbing out of bed and heading to the kitchen in search of a liquor cabinet wasn't it.
Harry groaned and put his head in his hands, "We're getting along worse than ever. I think she's starting to hate me, and I'm honestly so frustrated by her. And I'm just feeling so guilty, I would never have done what I did with you if I didn't think I was getting a divorce."
“Hermione! They just said they’ve tried everything else already. They wouldn’t be asking to do this if they didn’t think it could heal them. Just let them do their jobs.” Draco turned to the healer before him “What do you need me to sign?”
I've tried a different formatting on this chapter to make it easier to read, I'll go back and edit the first chapter when I'm able. This is my first story, so please let me know if it's not easy to read.
“The damage to the hippocampus damaged his memory. He’s been remembering little bits and pieces the last two days, but he says it’s fuzzy. His memory is clearer back when he first started to be given the potion.”
Draco opened his mouth to respond but before he had a chance his mother sailed back into the room, a house elf trailing behind her with a tray of tea and biscuits.
Draco finally settled on stopping by his office. He had paperwork that needed to be filled out, and it would keep his mind occupied. Draco quickly walked to the Ministry and headed up to his 3rd floor office, trying to avoid seeing anyone. He settled into his desk and pulled out his notes, quickly falling into the rhythm of case briefs and letting his personal life fall deep into the back of his mind.
“None. Apparently the case has been completely hushed.” Claire said.
Harry looked away sheepishly, “Maybe a little.”
Harry looked up at Hermione, “So you two aren’t mad? That I like Malfoy? That I’m gay?”
Harry walked Draco over to the bed, pulling down the covers and softly pushing Draco into the bed before answering, “I’m not sure, but you need to try to get some sleep. You need to stay strong for him right now. He’s with his mother, and the Aurors are going to find him… and when they do he’s going to need you to be okay. So get some sleep.”
Draco stopped to consider for a moment, “I hadn’t really thought about it. I’d planned on at least one, to be the heir, but I’d never really planned any farther than that.”
Ginny chewed her lip fretfully before looking up at Harry, “I don’t like it. You going off and me being stuck here with the boys, worried about you.”
Draco turned on the couch, climbing up on Harry’s lap and straddling his thighs, “well you see, I think he might be a bit uncomfortable if I do something like this.” Draco bent down at that, his lips grazing the corner of Harry’s lips before slowly moving his mouth towards the pulse-point on Harry’s neck.
"How's everything been here?" Harry asked nervously. He was very confident that if Draco had made Ron privy to what the two of them had gotten up to the previous week that Ron would not have greeted him so casually, but he was still a bit anxious about it.
They sat there quietly for a few minutes, both lost in thought. Harry kept thinking about his family, about seeing his boys again. He was excited, he had missed them a lot. He thought about seeing Ginny though, and he just got angry. He didn’t know what she was doing, and he hated feeling like she’d been trying to manipulate him. He wondered what she would have done if he had signed the divorce papers, if she would have just accepted it or if she would have tried to talk him out of it. He wondered what Ron could have possibly done to convince Head Auror Robards to send him home before they identified the mole in the office. Harry had known that once they identified the mole he was going to be switched out, probably put on an every other week rotation, but now the thought of leaving Draco was harder than he had imagined it could be. He was scared that changing him out now, before the mole was discovered, could put Draco at risk. Harry swallowed hard, pushing the thought out of his mind and thinking about the next morning, switching out with Ron and then getting to see his boys again.
The next morning, sitting on his desk, was an entire case of Ogden’s finest, along with a note.
Harry looked at Draco, startled, "I. I think I am though. Gay."
"I get it," Draco said gently. "It’s a lot to process going from getting a divorce to having a baby."
Draco narrowed his eyes slightly, his voice dropping, “Well there’s some things I just enjoy with you that I don’t think I’ll want to be doing with the Weasel.”
Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and squeezed it, “Anytime Harry. Get better. I’m going to give you two some time to talk and Ron and I will be back later.”
Claire smiled brightly, “I did nothing, it was all Harry. He's brilliant”
"How'd it go?" Ron asked anxiously.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “That’s soon. Don’t the solicitors still need to negotiate the contract?”
“They don’t really know. They said it was an unknown potion, but that he’s been using it for at least three months and was going through sever withdrawals when he was brought in. If you’d like I can sign a release so the doctors can talk to you about his condition. It’ll be invalid as soon as he’s in control of his facilities, but until then it should suffice.”
“Now Draco,” Narcissa stared as she seated herself in the lounge, “What happened between you and Astoria?”
“It matters, because he went to the bloody press calling this a witch hunt by a disgruntled ex-boyfriend.” Krones shot back as he threw the morning’s prophet at Draco.
Draco's smile immediately dropped, “Do you know how long the delay is likely to be?”
Draco closed the door behind him and Harry let out a groan of frustration. He couldn’t take this, waiting around in a very small safe house. Knowing that he could take twenty steps and be in that room, see Draco. He knew Draco would let him touch him, knew it would feel amazing to put his hands on Draco’s smooth flesh. Harry’s skin still felt the promise of more that he had felt when Draco had moved against him that night. Though he knew he made the responsible choice, he couldn’t get over questioning what would happen if Draco hadn’t fallen. How far would they have gone?
Draco sat anxiously in the waiting room. He had considering going back to work but he wanted to make sure he was nearby in case the healers needed something else from him. Hermione was still angry with him, and had left briefly to pick up some books on potions addictions and withdrawl before coming back and transfiguring a coffee table into a desk. Ron was pacing around the room with Rose, occasionally checking on Hermione to see if she needed anything or chatting with Draco. Draco felt like he was going crazy from all of the waiting, and he was about to challenge Ron to a game of chess when Astoria walked in.
Harry quickly put his hand on Draco’s arm, “No. No. They’re not giving up. Sorry, I thought Ron would have told you.” He said in a breath. “They think they’ve found where Astoria is hiding. They think they’ll be able to bring her in and get Scorpius back to you within the week.”
The fire flared green and Harry perked up with anticipation and relief. He was expecting to see Robards or another familiar face, perhaps even Ron who was on desk-duty for the six months after Rose had been born but who had been called into to help process the extra paperwork from the raid.  Instead, an unknown wizard with a bright red mask lept out of the fire, wand drawn. The unknown assailant fired off a quick stupify which Harry jumped up and countered.
“You. Fucking. Bastard” Harry’s face was red, and he was livid “You’re getting MARRIED, two months after we broke up? We were together for over two years Draco, did it really mean that little to you?” Harry was practically hissing at this point “Did I mean that little to you that the only time you had a second thought about me was when you were getting me suspended from work and my boyfriend arrested?”
“Yes, but I’m sure they have it there right? Fire whiskey, scotch, pumpkin juice? The drinks won’t be that different right?” Draco asked.
Ron shrugged, leaning back on the couch. "So did you guys get your stuff moved back in?" He asked absently.
Draco shook his head, “I still don’t understand. What happened to Harry’s memory?”
“Like you’re one to talk, you married another pureblood right out of Hogwarts!”
They passed the rest of the afternoon is pleasant company, and by the time Draco headed home he had almost forgotten about Harry’s letter.
"Not me," Blaise said with a grin, "But I think you might have a good chance. This," Blaise slowly started stroking Draco's dick, "hasn't gone down since Potter walked in. In fact, I'd say it's even harder."
Draco breathed in before nodding his head curtly, "Well. I'm gonna head off to bed then. Thank you for your concern but it was misplaced." Draco turned and put his hand on the door.
"Yes, Zabini. Why shouldn't Potter go? Been dreaming of having the chosen cock up your ass and finally think this is the right opportunity?" Draco spat.
Well, it appears from the comments on the last chapter that everyone is really mad at Harry right now. I wish I could say he's about to redeem himself with one of his normal acts of heroism but that would be a huge lie.
Harry lost all control, grabbing at Draco's hair and fucking himself into Draco's wet mouth. He finally let up with a long groan as his cock emptied into Draco's waiting mouth. Harry watched as Draco swallowed before pulling off Harry's cock and turning.
“I’m not involved, but neither is he. They told me they didn’t currently have any evidence against me, but now I’m suspended during the investigation and Jacob is sitting in jail.” Harry’s face started to crumple, the anger dropped off and he said quietly “Why don’t you just move on and let me be happy?” Harry turned and left the room, leaving Draco leaning heavily against the wall, feeling completely and utterly alone.
Harry looked thoroughly cowed, “So you don’t wanna marry me?” he asked.
“I know.” Draco whispered, “I know.”
Harry hesitated, “Well. Sort of. You won’t have to stay in a safe house but you’d have to stay in the United Kingdom. Until Astoria’s been found guilty and you’ve filed the custody case.”
Draco stood, opening his door for Astoria, “I’m sorry. I just can’t.”
“Of course not son, your father was only joking” Narcissa put her hand on Draco’s arm and guided him to the couch, “Now what help can we offer our favorite dragon?”
“Not ill, no. I just think I could use some help.”
Draco let out a soft sob, his eyes clenching shut as he let out of minuet nod. His shaky hand reached out and grabbed the ring in Harry’s hand. Harry breathed a sigh of relief and hit down on the button that would take them to the safehouse.
“That’s ridiculous” Draco wanted to set the article on fire. It was so unlike the Harry he knew, who had worked hard to keep his personal life out of the newspaper. That he had been willing to out himself to the press, confess his relationship with Draco, and talk about his new boyfriend was crazy to Draco, and all over some imagined vendetta. “What do I do to fix this?” Draco asked nervously.
Harry let out a breath his brain racing to catch up to what was happening. He wanted to back up, to go back to the living room and hide. He wasn’t sure what to do, but this was far from what he thought he’d be walking into. He wanted to grab Draco, to pull him towards him and wrap their arms around each other. Harry cursed internally, his resolve wavering as he realized that Draco wasn’t offering what he had been hoping for. Slowly, he felt his legs moving him forward to where Draco sat.
“You know, if you did magically manage to forget something I’m sure Weasley would send it back to you.” Draco snapped as Harry paced back and forth down the short hallway.
Harry continued to stare at Draco quizzically, “Is there any reason that staying in Britain wouldn’t work out for you?”
Harry raised an eyebrow, "I'll assume you know then? About the baby?"
Harry turned and glared at Draco, “I know that” he said, his voice short, “I just want to be sure.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Was that a concern?”
"Oh." Draco's eyes widened, a small smirk on his face. "That's fine too, you know."
Harry frowned slightly, “I wish you got to see yours too.”
Harry eyed Draco guiltily, "Listen. I'm sorry. I'll try and find out what's going on. Just have a cuppa and sit down and I'll let you know if I hear back."
Draco stopped and considered for a moment, before agreeing. He stepped back, threw more floo powder in the fireplace, and came through to his parent’s home. After he shook the ash off of his robes he looked over and was startled to see Harry sitting on the parlor couch, a sheepish look on his face.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment before nodding, “Yeah,” He said, “Anything you want.”
Harry’s face broke out into a huge smile, “So you’re saying yes?”
Draco’s head came back as he eyed Claire apprehensively before finally shaking her outstretched hand, “Nice to meet you Auror Sparks,” Draco said stiffly, “Thank you for getting me out of there safely.”
After a couple of minutes she stood up and walked to the bathroom, and Harry sat nervously. He had no idea what he was going to do. He and Ginny had been fighting on and off for months, and she had filed for divorce, how were they going to have another baby? He loved his children, and he knew he would love another, but this was just an awful situation. His heart started to race as fear set in, he had no clue how they could handle this.
Draco fell silent, his eyes tearing up. “I’m going to go to bed now.” He hesitated at the hallway, looking back at Harry, “Potter… Thank you… For believing in me.”
Draco raised his eyebrows and smirked “What an endearing reason.”
Ron swallowed hard, “Just hear her out first, yeah? Don’t make any hasty decisions.”
Draco shot Harry a withering glare, contempt clear on his face, "I'm not in shock
“That… That sucks Draco” Pansy leaned into him and wrapped him in a hug “Is there any chance of working things out?”
Harry's felt his heart drop through his stomach, "Ron." He said cautiously, "You've known we've been fighting. She doesn't want me back if I'm not willing to leave the Corps."
Harry smiled lightly, "Thanks Gin. I am sorry I was gone so long, and I'm sorry I didn't write. I missed you and the boys a lot, and I was always thinking of you."
Harry stared ahead at the beige house before him, scouring the windows for any sight of Draco’s bright blonde hair, “It’ll be soon. Once we see Malfoy we give the signal to the rest of the teams and we immediately go and take him. As soon as we see him we’ll be too busy to worry about anything, and before you know it everything will be over and we can go home and go to sleep.”
Harry smiled and closed the gap between their mouths, pressing his lips against Draco’s and kissing him thoroughly. Draco sat there hesitantly as Harry wrapped his hands in Draco’s hair, and started nudging Draco further into the kiss with his lips. Suddenly, snapping into motion, Draco grabbed Harry around the waist and opened his mouth to the kiss.
Harry tried to remember the feeling of Ginny kissing him. Tried to think of her soft pale skin under his fingertips, the way she would laugh in his ear when he kissed her neck. His mind kept changing the image though, Ginny’s neck would change to Draco’s neck and her laugh would deepen into his voice. Harry felt another sharp pang of arousal and knew he needed to stop thinking. Harry laid down on the coach, hoping to fall asleep into a nap. His mind started supplying him with daydreams, and he knew he could never stop and rest when just a room away Draco was pleasuring himself in a way that Harry very much wanted to help with.
Harry’s head shot up and he gave Draco a bewildered look, “Four?” He repeated dumbly, “Malfoy, that’s three years away.”
Ron looked at Harry as if about to argue before shrugging and returning his attention to his plate, "Do what you want Mate. Merlin knows what good it'll do you though."
Draco exhaled softly, “Well, here’s hoping.”
Harry felt the firm press of Draco’s erection against his own, and he bucked his hips up to gain friction. Draco quickly responded, firming his stance above Harry and rubbing their bodies together as they continued to kiss. Harry’s hands found themselves traveling lower, until his hands were firmly over Draco’s round buttocks. Draco moaned softly in Harry’s mouth before pulling back.
“We’ve never gone out for a pint just the two of us. We’ve gone just the three of us, but never just you and me. Where’s Hermione?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“I’m talking you once again showing just how little you cared about me!” Harry yelled angrily, shoving the morning’s prophet into Draco’s face.
Draco's head shot up, "What?! Are they giving up? What about Scorpius?!"
Draco looked over cautiously, “I can’t ask that of you. You’ve been here enough, and your family needs you”
The fight went out of Draco almost immediately and he slumped into a chair. Running his fingers through his hair, Draco starred helplessly at Harry “do you have any idea what it feels like to have your child out there somewhere, but to have no idea where? I don't know if he's safe, I don't even know if he's even fucking ALIVE. I just feel so useless.”
Draco raised an eyebrow concerned “My date sir?”
“I should go lie down.” Draco declared after a while, lifting his red rimmed eyes and blinking owlishly at the light around him.
“I mean look at my fucking life Potter!” Draco angrily gestured to the sky, “I tried to be better. I married a girl whose family stayed out of the war. I was committed to raising my son better than I'd been raised. We were going to have a family, and raise a child to think that he wasn't any better than anyone else just because of his blood status. Then I find out, that lovely witch I married is part of an underground group hunting down muggle-borns before they get their Hogwarts letters and massacring their ENTIRE FAMILIES.”
. Happy? But it shouldn’t have happened, and I apologize for my lapse in judgement and I will make sure to never do it again!”
Ginny hugged him back before looking up at him, biting her lip and seeming to want to say something. Finally, she shook her head and smiled “Thank you, Harry, for being here with me. I could not have handled this alone.”
“Next year?” Draco’s eyes bulged, “It’s June! That’s eighteen months! That’s longer than Scorpius has been alive! Are you saying he’s going to have his first birthday party trapped in a one bedroom safe house that’s being shared with one random Auror or another?”
Draco looked up, carefully, at Harry, “I love you too Harry. I always have.”
“What?” Harry asked, his eyes bright as they tried to focus on Draco.
Scorpius was standing in his crib, cheeks bright with anger.
Draco shot Harry a scathing look, “oh sure. A ten month old boy is missing and the home he was staying in was burned to the ground, and all that constitutes is a bloody letter.” Draco stood and approached Harry menacingly, ice raging in his eyes. Draco shoved Harry into a wall, getting right up into his face. “Tell me Potter,” he spat, “do all missing children receive this level of disinterest or only the children of ex Death Eaters?”
After his shower Draco checked out of the hotel, and tried to decide what to do for the rest of the day. He stopped as he realized he had no place to go; for the next five hours he was essentially homeless. Draco didn’t want to go to buy furniture and decorations until he’d seen his new place, and it seemed silly to go to the grocery store when he didn’t even have a kitchen to cook his meals in. He could always go to the manor, but he was trying to avoid telling his parents about his and Harry’s separation until he’d settled things a bit clearer in his mind. He hadn’t actually wanted to tell Pansy but necessity required it.
“Yeah, well, the boys were missing Scorp, and I was missing you.” Harry said with a big grin.
Harry put the letter down with a sigh. Ten days. A week ago the house elf had sent them fresh clothes and books, but Harry had never imagined that they’d be trapped together for ten days. On their second night in the house Harry had transfigured the large king-size bed into two full-sized beds, which he begrudgingly thought wasn’t as comfortable as that first night where he’d accidently cuddled with Draco.
“But you never told me you felt that way. You never told me that the way I was acting was hurting you.”
“You had my new boyfriend arrested, do you call that moving on?!” Harry exclaimed angrily.
Draco looked carefully at everything other than Harry, "I may have overheard you and the Weasel. Congratulations.... You know. On the baby."
Ginny pursed her lips but didn't respond, and Harry went over to the Floo. He arrived at Grimmauld to find the house dark, and quickly turned the lights on in the kitchen so he could pour himself a drink. Draco found him half an hour and six shots of whiskey later.
They’d settled into a bit of a routine, Draco would usually wake up first and shower and get ready, and then he would cook breakfast while Harry got ready. After breakfast they would usually receive a request from Ron or Head Auror Robards asking for some information or on one occasion some of Draco’s hair. Then after finishing whatever they needed to work on they would read or write or make stilted conversation. They tried to reminisce about Hogwarts days, but unsurprisingly they didn’t have many memories that were positive for both of them. Quidditch was a safe topic, though Draco seemed to have caught on early on that discussing Ginny’s team was not a good idea. Harry tended to make lunch, and afterwards they would play wizard chess or a card game. They would trade-off on making dinner, then usually they would receive a report for the day from the Ministry and Harry would work to write-up his report. His reports were short and repetitive, but it helped to remind him that this was just an assignment and not his new life.
“Harry,” Draco pants, “Harry, I’m not going to last long.”
Harry stuttered as he felt Draco's large hand wrap around his cock. Harry moaned, clenching his fists, “I pulled you out to talk. Not… Merlin's beard,” he cursed as Draco twisted his wrist and pulled.
“Ginny,” Harry tried to be placating, but he knew his tone was too rough, “I didn't mean to upset you. I just mean I think too much has passed for us to just go back to how we were. I still love you, but I think once we're both working again the fighting will start again. I can't go through that again. But that doesn't mean I don't want to be here now, taking care of the kids.”
“You did do that to me Harry. The potion didn’t give you any new emotions, it just made you react to them. You still thought I was capable of orchestrating a witch hunt against your boyfriend and having him arrested on trumped up charges. You thought I didn’t care at all about you when we weren’t together.”
“Thank you for taking such great care of them. It was so hard to have them be sick and not be able to comfort them.”
“Crystal clear sir. You can count on us.” Harry said reverently.
“He’s having a rough go of it, don’t be a prat to him.” Harry said seriously.
“That sigh must mean we’re saved, right?” Draco asked, walking in from the kitchen holding two plates.
Harry awoke the next morning with a pounding headache to Scorpius wailing. At first Harry tried to ignore him, figuring Draco would see to him in a moment, but after a couple of minutes he made his way out of bed to check on the boy.
Draco breathed and rubbed the bridge of his nose “To end you randomly accosting me to yell at me? I’d do pretty much anything” Draco stood and walked into his office, motioning Harry to follow behind him. He pulled his pensive from the closet and put his wand up to his temple. Draco flicked the memory of the deal offer into the pensive and motioned to Harry “Go on then. That’s everything.”
Harry looked at Draco hesitantly before turning and immerging himself into the memory. Draco looked at him for a moment before turning around irritated and heading for the kitchen. If he was going to be awake early on a Sunday morning he was going to have a cup of tea with him.
Harry opened his eyes in shock, his eyes meeting Draco’s, “What?” he asked, confused.
Meeting baby Rose went much better than Draco had feared. Though there was an entire parade of Weasleys, apparently Draco had managed to visit after Harry had left. Hermione looked exhausted, but she gave Draco a hug before allowing Ron to proudly show off their new girl. After extracting a promise that Draco would come visit after work on Monday, they allowed Draco to head off so they could get some rest.
After two months apart, Draco runs into Harry in a very unexpected way
Draco’s two weeks of vacation time ended abruptly Monday morning with a floo call from Head Barrister Krone’s assistant telling him he was needed in as soon as possible. Draco threw on some clothes and headed into the office, a feeling of dread firmly set in the pit of his stomach.
I'm now realizing that my note on yesterday's chapter saying this one would be more "cheerful" might not have been the right word. It should be a bit illuminating at least. I'm hoping that the next two chapters are going to answer a lot of questions, though they'll probably create some new questions too.
Harry smiled, “Anytime Malfoy. I think it was very brave of you to give us the information we needed to help save those families.”
“That's not what I meant.” She said, her voice quivering, “What if you moved back here, permanently?”
Harry frowned, “I'm sorry you're so unhappy.”
“Not yet, but we’ll get to know each other in time.” Draco muttered defensively “I know I can tolerate being around her, I know that she’s been raised to follow the same traditions as me. I know that she’s got enough decorum that I doubt she’ll ever spill a bunch of one sided drabble to the press. We’ll come to love each other, just like thousands of witches and wizards have done before us.”
The waiter brought Draco a menu and Daphne and Pansy chattered quietly in the background as Draco decided what to order. Draco noticed Adrian kept staring at Draco, and it was making Draco quite nervous. Though they had played Quidditch together for a few years back at Hogwarts, Adrian was not someone Draco would normally sit down and have lunch with.
“I was happy. I just didn’t want them to turn our love into something it wasn’t. You know what they do, they would take the fact you were a death eater, and that I was the bloody chosen one, and that we hated each other in school. They would run columns wondering if I was under the imperious, or wondering if I was turning dark. It would be a circus and it wasn’t any of their business. I just don’t want to be in the papers, I don’t want to be the Boy Who Lived anymore. I just want to be Harry Potter, Auror extraordinaire and boyfriend of Draco Malfoy, the best damn barrister the Ministry has ever seen. I don’t want to open my life up to their commentary.”
Harry smiled lightly at Draco. They didn’t say anything else to each other as they sat waiting for the clock to strike eight, but they also didn’t release each other’s hands.
"That the kind of welcome you wanted me to give him Blaise?" Draco said seductively before darting his head around to realize Blaise was nowhere to be found.
“Don’t ever apologize for your past Draco, we both have them. I just… Make sure he stays in your past will you?” Astoria asked carefully.
“Fuck” Draco moaned before attacking Harry’s neck, biting down where he felt Harry’s pulse. “Can I touch you?” He asked, his voice high pitched with need.
Draco glared at Harry, “Maybe I want to just be a friendly bloke that can smile at people on the street? Maybe I want to have a career where whenever I express a dissenting opinion no one says ‘Oh look, you’ve upset the Death Eater?!’ Maybe I just want to be able to fall in love with someone I want to fall in love with, instead of marrying a pureblood witch who my parents arranged for me to marry in order to have a pureblood baby and be miserable knowing that my wife is a murderous, adulterous nut job and I never wanted to be with her in the first place!”
“Well for one, your solicitor appears to have taken out the clause about children.”
Harry’s head shot up, “You’re ready? For what part?”
“Nothing was wrong.” Harry interrupted, “We were happy Draco.”
“Great. Once that comes back clear we can go ahead and move forward with the contract. I’m thinking we could plan on getting married this fall?”
Draco looked at Harry and spoke slowly, like he was explaining a concept to a young child, “It’s not like we can stay in Britain. It won’t be safe here. We’ll have to leave, go someplace where Astoria’s group can’t follow us, where they won’t realize Scorpius is the son of a death eater and a murderer. We’ll start over, when all of this is over.” Draco sighed wistfully, “It’s funny. Really. Even though I did my duty and had a son, the Malfoy name still ends with me. Ironic don’t you think?”
Harry laughed lightly, “No, you’ll be good. At least you’ll finally have someone who can beat you at chess.”
Draco looked at Harry pleadingly, “Were we? I keep wondering, if we were really so happy why was it so easy for you to believe that I didn’t care at all? Why was it so easy for Jacob to convince you that he loved you more than I did? Why was it so easy to go to the press and say all those terrible things about me when you wouldn’t even go into wizarding public with me for fear that the press would see us together?”
Draco pulled Harry’s hair tightly, a small prickling in his brain tell him this was a bad idea, which he promptly ignored. Tightening his grip in Harry’s hair slightly, Draco pulled Harry’s head up as he lowered his own until their faces were just centimeters apart. Finally, Draco licked his lips slowly before lowering his head slightly more in a tentative kiss, touching his own lips to Harry’s.
Draco paused to pour himself another drink and downed it before continuing. “So then, I go to the Aurors. I know I can't let my son be raised by a blood purist murderer. I've lived that childhood already. I know he needs to be better than I was as a kid, so he needs to be raised better. And now what's happening? My son is missing. She took him and,” Draco’s voice wavered and he put his drink down, “And now I don't even get to see him grow up. I…. I tried so hard to make sure I was going to be raising him well, and now I’ve lost him.” Draco physically shook at his statement before tears started coming down his face, he buried his head in his hands.
Draco rolled his eyes before plonking down on the chair by the couch, and folded his arms behind his head, “So what does he want you to find out?”
Draco breathed slowly, closing his eyes. “I’m sorry, Potter. I just want to be happy. Surely you can understand that?”
Draco panicked, his decision to try again with Harry was still so new that he hadn’t told him parents that he’d made it, “Who’s it for?”
“Not awful, no” Draco sighed, massaging his brow, “but I'm living in limbo. I can't start my life trapped here, I can't take my son to the park, or work, or forge friendships. I'm just here, biding my time, watching my son grow up in someone else's house. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy our time together but it has to end eventually. I thought it would be next week.”
Harry nervously rubbed at the back of his neck, “He recommended I should do something to show you that things had changed, and that I was going to make an effort. I figured what better way to show things were different than by showing you that I want to commit to you completely. And since you were going through the betrothal process with Astoria, I figured that was the way you wanted to do it, and if I initiated it, you’d realize that I was paying attention.”
Draco gave Harry a sad look, “But what if they don’t? At what point do they decide they need their best teams elsewhere? That they can’t have their top Auror holed up in a house with his childhood rival? That they can’t have their top teams out chasing a 24 year old woman and her infant son and instead need them solving crimes?”
“Do you really have any complaints? Are you telling me you want to marry me because you’ve fallen deeply in love with me and can’t imagine a day without my smile?” Astoria asked wryly.
Draco continued to glare at Pansy, “I never said that. I just think that what Astoria and I have decided is our business, not yours”. He said through gritted teeth.
Draco rolled his eyes, but took the quill and began writing.
Harry’s eyebrows raised, “Oh yeah? What kind of going away present?”
Harry blinked up at Draco for a moment, uncomprehending. "I can't drink on the job." He said flatly, repeating his earlier sentiment.
Draco was touched by the concern of his boss, “Of course Sir. I’ll try to fix this.”
Draco circled around him, crouching down towards Harry’s side and placing his hand on Harry’s lower back, “Straighten your back,” Draco said quietly as he pushed his hand into Harry’s spine, his mouth close to Harry’s ear.
“Attention.” Head Auror Robards called, “I need everyone to focus; we have an important job to do tonight and we need to do it right. In the past two months, three muggle families have been slaughtered, each with a child whose name appeared in the
Draco deadpanned towards his mom, his voice like ice, “I didn’t know you had company Mother. This can easily wait for another time.”
“You can be assured, I will never be enough of a masochist to want him back in my life.” Draco stood and offered her his arm, walking her to the floo in the lobby before returning to the waiting room.
Draco finally released Harry’s cock and laid his head down on Harry’s thigh, his heart beating out of his chest.
Hesitantly, Harry looked over at Ginny, “You know even when I go back to Grimmauld I'll always be here when you need me, right? You don't have to feel like you're alone, if one of the kids is sick and you need me to care for them, or the other two, I'll do it with no problem.”
“Is that so?” Astoria asked teasingly, raising her voice slightly “Does that mean I should tell my father to go ahead with the bethrothal contract?” Before Draco had a chance to even think about giving her an answer Astoria pulled Draco into an intense kiss, wrapping her arms around his neck and moaning lightly. As she released him from her kiss she moved her mouth to his ear and whispered “The press is watching, say yes”
Draco walked through the door of a dimly lit sushi restaurant right at noon and headed to the back. The restaurant was mildly full in the front and by the sushi bar, but as Draco headed further back he saw the area was much more secluded. Looking up, Draco was surprised to see not only Pansy but also Adrian Pucey and his wife Daphne, Astoria’s older sister. Pansy gestured Draco to sit down next to her across from Daphne.
"Oh," Draco said in mock shock, "I'm so sorry Potter, does the Dark Mark make you uncomfortable? I'd take it off, but it's kind of attached to my arm."
I've been trying to post 1 chapter per night but the next couple of chapters need to have some formatting fixed on them and a final  read-through done, and I somehow got roped into doing Yoga on Bicycles (Did anyone know that's a thing? Cause it seems super unsafe) tomorrow night and then kayaking the next two nights after that, so I don't think I'll be able to post them. On the bright side, if I survive the yoga biking (my expectations are very low) postings should resume on Friday and finish up early next week. Please let me know what you think so far! I might write an alternate ending depending on how people are feeling after this chapter.
Harry lowered himself down carefully, folding his legs across each other and putting his hands down on his knees. “So how do I do this?” He asked, his voice sounding pouty even to his own ears
“I missed you every moment Harry, but I needed to work. I thought you understood.” Draco looked up and glared defiantly, “But I was never unfaithful to you! When we were together I never even thought about anyone else, that was just you. What I do, or who I marry, now that we’re not together really isn’t any of your concern.”
Draco paused, eyes flickering about the room before looking to the ground. “She may be staying with her lover.” He stated quietly, jaw clenched.
“Malfoy, wait!” Harry exclaimed, racing after Draco as he looked around.
Astoria stiffened, “So are you opposed to having a second child?” She asked icily.
Harry let out a billowing laugh, wrapping his arms around Ginny in a tight hug. “Will do. Now, off to bed.”
Harry tried to shake himself out of his lust-driven state. Finally, blinking, he stuttered out, "Sorry. I'm sorry. I should go."
At the bottom were apparition coordinate and the name of a restaurant that Draco vaguely thought they might have gone to before. He wrote back a quick agreement to lunch before heading upstairs to get ready for work.
Harry heard a brief pop right after he landed, and saw Claire staring at Draco happily before putting out her hand, “Auror Claire Sparks at your service sir, and I believe you’ve met my partner Auror Potter. It looks like we got you out as planned, and as soon as we receive a floo call that they’re ready we can floo to the ministry. In the mean-time, have a seat. Would you like any tea?”
Before Harry or Ginny could object Lily was gone and the house was completely silent. They looked at each other slightly bewildered.
“So you missed me too, eh?” Harry asked with a grin, running a possessive hand down Draco's back and cupping his ass.
Harry shoved his glasses onto his face and looked up at Hermione’s voice, but it was like he didn’t see her at all, just saw past her to the mop of golden hair behind her. “Draco” Harry whispered.
Harry approached Draco, placing his wand up against Draco's chin, "I just abandoned my partner, possibly let her die, to protect you." Harry's voice has dropped lower than Draco ever heard it before, more a hissed whisper than anything else, "That floo was only accessible from the Auror department of the ministry which means either the department has been compromised or this is all just a set up orchestrated by you. Until I know which, there's no way you're wandering loose."
Draco threw some bills on the table “Terribly sorry, I just remembered I have a meeting starting in a few minutes. Nice seeing you all again.” He said coldly before standing and making his way out the door.
“Well,” Harry started, standing up and stretching his arms out, “I think it's time for me to hit the hay. I could sleep for a year.”
Draco’s forehead creased with concern, “The one about having two magical children? I had asked them to change that part. What’s your intention if we have multiple squibs? To just keep having more children? When would that end?”
Harry put his chin up, trying to cover the embarrassment in his tone, “Well. I wanted to show you that I was serious. That I was committed.” Seeing Draco’s thunderous face, Harry looked down and mumbled, “It was Ron’s idea.”
“It's good I'm not willing to try to make it work with my wife? Good I'm not willing to see if I can make it so my kids grow up in one house, with both parents?” Harry slurred out, his voice rising.
Harry looked up blankly, "And it's definitely mine then?" He cringed as he asked, but a small voice in the back of his mind wouldn't let him not.
“Then what exactly did dearest Ronald say Harry? Be careful, your next sentence could determine if sweet baby Rose gets to grow up with or without a father.” Draco’s eyes shined like venom as he spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry squeezed her hand gently, “I'm sorry, Gin. Truly, I am. But I can't go back down that road.”
Harry groaned in frustration before throwing his arm over his head, trying to figure out what sort of mess he had gotten himself into.
Harry stood up from across the table, and slowly walked towards Draco, approaching like he would a wounded animal. When Harry arrived by Draco’s side, he knelt down on both knees and pulled Draco’s hands into his, bringing them to his lips for a kiss. “Please Draco, please give me one more chance and I promise you I will work every day to make sure that you never ever have to doubt that you are the most loved man on this earth. Just please, say I still have a chance”.
“Could Astoria have gone there? To stay at Daphne’s home in America?”
“Hi.” Draco responded quietly, not moving from his spot at the doorway even as Hermione came and sat in a chair by Harry’s bed.
“Ron and Hermione asked Harry and I to be their baby’s godparents when they first found out they were pregnant. I hadn’t thought about it, but I would have assumed that would have ended with Harry and I’s relationship”
Claire bit her lip and nodded, trying to calm herself down but her eyes giving away the excitement she still felt, “Maybe we’ll get to do some real good.” She said passionately as she pushed open the door.
“None.” Draco smiled. “Now I should probably get back downstairs. I appreciate you coming here, I apologize for missing our lunch.”
Astoria glared at Draco, “I already made my decision. I’m marrying you, and we’re going to have children and eventually I’ll forget Marc and you’ll forget Harry and we’ll be happy.”
“Hey,” Draco said, opening the door and inviting Harry inside.
“Odd.” Draco said.
“I’m so close, Draco” Harry whined.
Draco shook his head, opening his mouth lightly and blowing a cool stream of air onto Harry's heavy erection before pushing forward and swallowing Harry back to the root.
Draco looked up, his eyes searching Harry’s face wildly. “You mean it? They’re bringing him home?”
“I asked, What. The fuck. Is wrong with you?” Draco annunciated, fire flying out of his eyes.
“Harry doesn’t abuse potions!” Ron started in outrage, “He won’t even take dreamless sleep because he was worried about getting addicted!”
Harry slowly started kissing his way down Draco’s body, stopping to lick at his nipples and bite lightly along Draco’s ribs, “I wouldn’t let myself think about never being with you again.” Harry said as he mouthed at Draco’s hip.
“Hey. You look amazing.” Harry said, handing Draco the box of chocolate as he walked into the flat. Harry looked around, eyeing the style and missing the sophisticated grace Draco’s taste had added to their shared apartment.
“Hello Mother. Not exactly.” Draco said as he walked in, “I just took the day off to do some thinking and thought I’d come and visit you.”
Astoria huffed, “It’s not like we’re likely to have a squib. We both come from powerful magical families, it’s just outlined in the contract to avoid confusion later on.”
Doubt flickered in Draco’s eyes, and sensing it Harry put his hands on Draco's arms, pushing him backwards while also running his hands soothingly over him. “If I know the Auror Corp, they already knew he was missing and have every available unit out looking for him.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “I accept your apology Potter. Though, it is my fault that your marriage is breaking up in a way. If I hadn’t asked for you to be guarding me that day, you wouldn’t be the one stuck here with me and your wife wouldn’t be upset.”
“Whiskey, neat. Thank you”
After a few hours of wallowing, Draco shook his head and floo called his parents, asking if he could come over that evening for dinner. After confirming his plans, he headed for a shower and then a shave. At 6, Draco pulled on his favorite jumper, one given to him by his mother the year before, and stepped into the floo.
Draco sat down on Harry’s bed, “You’re an idiot” he said flatly.
Draco released his breath, "Thank you, Potter."
Harry snorted, “I don’t mind. No.” He gripped Draco’s waist tighter, pulling their bodies tight. His hand came up Draco’s side to the back of his head. He clutched into Draco’s hair, pulling him into a rough kiss. He was intoxicated with just the scent of Draco against him, needing to feel him.
Draco looked at Harry carefully before lowering his arms, his posture straightening, “I don't know much. Astoria, well… We weren't as close as we could have been. She spends most of her free time with Daphne. Her family's doesn't have many properties, though she still has access to all of the Malfoy vacation homes if she was willing to risk that.”
Draco smiled sadly, “I’m not sure. Can we try going out tonight as just friends? I’m still not sure how I’m feeling about…” Draco gestured hopelessly, “well, about anything really.”
Harry's head jerked up, and he started at Ginny in confusion, “What? Why?” He asked.
Harry started at Draco in horror, all thoughts of sleep pushed firmly from his mind “Draco, I'm so sorry,” he started, but faltered unsure of what to say next. Instead of speaking, Harry scooted closer to Draco, pulling Draco against his shoulder in what he hoped was a soothing manor.
Harry’s ears turned red, “Not exactly.” He muttered.
Draco hummed as he took Harry down his throat, reveling in the heat of Harry's erection. Draco put his hands on Harry's hips, pulling Harry further down until Draco's lips were pressed against Harry's soft curls.
As if sensing his exhaustion, Harry squeezed lightly on Draco’s shoulder before nodding his head towards the hallway behind him. “There's nothing else we can do right now. Let's get some rest, and I'll wake you as soon as I've heard word.”
Harry bit his lower lip nervously, “Sometimes” He started reluctantly, “I feel like you don’t care as much as I do. But it’s not all the time and I usually realize that I’m just being insecure and you show your affection differently than I do.”
Thursday-
Harry walked up behind Draco, “I don’t blame you. I’m not mad. I was just…” Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose for a moment carefully, “I was just surprised. I know that none of this” he gestured around the safe house, “is your fault.”
Harry closed his eyes briefly when he finished the letter, sadness overwhelming him. He looked over at Draco, noted the pale tint to his skin, and quickly folded the letter so he could tell Draco the news about Theo. No matter how much he wanted to deal with his home life, he knew he needed to push it down and focus on helping to find Draco’s son.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked.
Harry snorted, "I'm sorry. I should have written. I just... You were so angry at me, I thought if I wrote to you if would make you more angry."
Draco rolled his eyes as he finished Harry’s letter. “Just like the prat to turn a simple letter about Teddy into a chance to reminisce about us” he thought.
Draco glared over, “It’s different with you.” He said flatly.
“So there’s no reason not to proceed I suppose?”
“I’ve got something for you.” Ron said, reaching into his bag and pulling out a small ring. “It’s a portkey. It’s set to take you back directly to your house at 9:00. You’re to go in, and not leave again for a week. Even mum and dad can’t know you’re home, they think you’re off in France. Gin is waiting for you, you need to talk. If they find the mole before the end of seven days then orders might change, but for now I’m here for a week and then you’ll swap back in. 8 am this time next week. Until then, DO. NOT. LEAVE. YOUR. HOUSE. Robards is going to stop by tomorrow morning and debrief you. He sent this letter” Ron again reached into his bag, pulling out a letter that was sealed with the Head Auror’s stamp. “None of the other Aurors can know that you’re home. Not even Sparks.”
Draco stood up, his movements flowing and soft. “Come sit down here, cross your legs.” He said, gesturing to the pillow on the ground he had just vacated.
Astoria looked up at Draco, glaring, “She can’t have children. That’s why I need to.”
Ron grinned at him and pulled his traveling chess set out of his pocket. “I always fancy a chance to beat you.”
“Please” Kathryn sat down with a smile. When Draco had handed her the tea she took a sip and then sat back and started “I’m here about the Parsons case. My client wants a deal, and I was told you’re the prosecutor in the case”
Harry glared slightly, “I’m sure.”
“I didn’t do this on purpose Auror Potter. Now, I understand that you are upset right now, but if you don’t release me immediately I am going to have you arrested for this.”
"Wait!" Harry exclaimed, "What about you?"
Thank you all for reading! We are almost at the end. There's only two more chapters left! Thanks for sticking it out with me!
Harry turned to Draco, concern etched clearly on his face. "Malfoy, you're in shock, and you're exhausted. Let's draw you a bath so you can warm up, and I'll send in some tea."
Sorry for the very long wait.... I had forgotten that I hadn't finished uploading this. I'll try to have all the chapters uploaded by the end of October. Just going through and editing the other chapters.
Harry grabbed a book at random, throwing himself onto the couch and opening to the first page.
Draco sat up at that, “What? I hadn’t realized we were still looking. I know we hadn’t spoken about that, but I assumed we were going to wait.”
Harry frowned. "I might still need to figure that out with him though."
Draco started to move his mouth up and down quickly, one hand gripped firmly on Harry’s thigh and the other hand fisting his own cock. He hummed lightly, eliciting a groan from Harry, before he pressed himself down as far as he could go, taking Harry’s length into his throat. By the time he started to pull back up his eyes were watering with the efforts, but he could feel Harry breaking apart in front of him and it spurred him on. He quickened his pace even more, racing to the finish line.
“You’d better have a damn good reason Barrister Malfoy. I have a feeling we’re going to need all of our barristers and investigators on this one. Internal Affairs has already been called in, and the Minster himself has asked for daily briefings.” Head Barrister Krones was a gruff man, short but with a commanding presence. His face was red, and he was giving Draco a glare that would have terrified any man who had not had to spend a year living with the dark lord.
“Brilliant. If you tell his doctor what was in it, it could help. They’re having too much trouble stabilizing him right now, this could really help him!” Draco exclaimed.
Harry growled, “I don’t even know. I’m going to guess she sent the divorce papers to scare me into coming home and now that that didn’t work she decided to try a different technique”.
Harry's smile brightened, "they're good. Al got so big, and he's crawling like crazy. Won't surprise me if he starts walking soon. And James, he's so smart. I almost think he's able to control his accidental magic, he turned his Lima beans into jelly beans last night."
Harry nodded, checking to see how much time he had left before the portkey took him home. “How’re Gin and the boys?”
“Your two month old daughter won’t stop crying and you leave her with Hermione and head out?”
Harry looked up at her. “You still want me there, then?”
Draco shot Blaise a scathing look, but excitement was racing through his blood. Draco walked over to Harry and slowly knelt before him, mouthing at the hardness in Harry's trousers before looking up, "Tell me no if you don't want this."
Draco pulled himself up softly, “I’m sorry Astoria. I can’t marry you. It just doesn’t feel right.”
Draco turned his head and pulled Harry in for a kiss, wrapping his hands around Harry’s neck and pulling Harry down on top of him. He ran his fingers through Harry’s wild hair, moaning as he felt Harry open his mouth and nervously meet their tongues together. Draco pulled Harry closer, suddenly remembering he was shirtless as he felt Harry’s body press against his own, Harry only clothed in his pants.
Draco glared at Harry, “She may have, though I imagine if the infamously oblivious Auror Potter could have come up with the idea right away she probably realized it wasn’t a safe hiding place. She may have gone to Argentina, to stay with an old family friend. She may be in Russia, avoiding extradition. She enjoys skiing so maybe she’s in Switzerland, though she’s also fond of sailing so maybe Greece instead? You don’t get it do you? She’s a young, beautiful, well-connected, rich witch who hasn’t burnt every social bridge there is to burn. She could be anywhere. My son… he could be anywhere and I may never find him.”
Ron hesitated, looking down at his hands, “You should ask her that question, mate. I know she’s anxious to talk to you. Pretty lousy not sending her a single letter while you’ve been here.”
Harry smiled back, “Of course Gin. There was no question, here with the kids is where I want to be.”
Draco looked up at him for a moment, “I will miss you, you know.”
“You never told me how much it hurt you that I didn’t want the press to know about you.”
Draco’s face softened, “It was the only option. For my son, and the life I want for him, he needs me to be an example for good.”
Harry smiled lightly, “I get it, Malfoy. Do you think I would be upset that you trusted me? I know this outcome isn’t what you were expecting when you asked. I’m glad you knew you could trust me enough to keep you safe. It wasn’t always like that.”
Draco laughed dryly, his eyes dark, “Who would have thought ten years ago that you and I would be stuck living in a safe house in seclusion together?”
Draco rolled his eyes before standing up and wandering through the kitchen, “Yeah. We’ll talk then. See if this fit of crazy has moved on by then. Till then, let’s just worry about lunch.”
Harry awoke the next morning with a splitting headache, the artificial light from the hallway seemed so bright under the bedroom door that he thought it might blind him. He rolled over and groped for his wand, casting a tempus and seeing that it was nearly noon. Carefully, Harry sat up, feeling his stomach rebel with every movement he made. His tongue felt like sandpaper, but the thought of drinking water made Harry even queasier than he already felt.
Ginny glared at him, her face sour. "Yes, well, since you didn't want to talk to me about whatever I had to say I'm assuming you don't care. But at my pre-game physical two days ago the mediwitch discovered I'm 6 weeks pregnant."
“Draco, two visits in one week my dearest? Are you ill?” Narcissa floated through the parlor to wrap Draco in a light hug as he exited the floo.
The head Auror laid out the case, and assigned the teams to their positions through the raid. “Potter, Sparks,” Robard’s called to Harry and Claire, “You’ll be in charge of apparating our informant out of harm’s way. His testimony is what is going to put these arseholes in Azkaban. It is imperative that you extract him cleanly, before any crazy spells start flying.”
Ginny looked up at Harry, her eyes thoughtful behind her thick lashes, “What if you didn't go back to Grimmauld?” She asked cautiously.
Draco sighed and took a sip of his wine, leaning back against the cool comfort of the couch “I don’t know Pans. I thought we were good. I thought we were happy. Suddenly, I come home and he tells me I didn’t miss him enough or love him enough and he’s moved on with someone else.”
"Really?" Blaise taunted, "Because I think Potter wants you."
Harry laughed a dry laugh, his soul feeling a deep sense of contrition, “So many reasons Malfoy. I’m me and you’re you, and we spent our entire teen years hating each other. No matter what state either of our marriages are currently in, for the time being we’re both married. I’m the Auror that’s set to protect you, it would be completely unethical for me to be in any way, shape, or form involved with you and I could lose my job. And lastly, we’re not bent.”
Narcissa frowned at her son before chastising him, “Harry and I have a bond that goes far past your two’s relationship. I saved his life once, and he saved the most precious thing in the world to me. If he would like to come over for tea he is always welcome.” Standing and walking towards the study, “Now since you’re here you can help me and your father figure out how to tip off the Prophet to the fact that you are not in fact going to marry Astoria.”
“That's not what I meant,” Draco soothed, “I just meant good as in I'm glad. I'm glad because it means I can still have you.”
“Of course I came. What happened? I thought he was suspended from work?” Draco snapped. The thought of his idiotic ex being able to get severely injured even without evil wizards throwing curses at him was rather aggravating to Draco.
“Your hands feel good.” Harry slurred, his inebriation level obvious.
Harry glared over at the blond, “Everything is the matter. Ginny kicked me out, again.”
Harry walked over to the bookshelf, trying to see if there were any interesting books to read that he hadn’t read yet. As Harry was skimming through books, he heard a soft moan come from the bedroom. Harry froze a sharp bolt of arousal running through him.
“So, did the boys really miss Scorpius, or did you just miss me a lot?” Draco teased.
This mantra kept repeating itself over and over again in Harry’s head. The day before the mantra had included
"Oh." Harry frowned slightly, "yeah, I guess it was."
Astoria’s face steeled over, “It’s a tradition. On my mother’s side. She passed away when I was young, but I’d still like to honor her traditions. Are you really opposed to having two children? How many had you wanted?”
Harry choked, “You. I want you” He pressed forward again, capturing Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth. Harry bit down, gently, before releasing his teeth and swiping at Draco’s lip with his tongue. “I want you so fucking badly Draco.” He moaned.
Being around Draco wasn’t as awful as Harry would have imagined it to be. Though neither were good company, Harry was proud that they were both getting along fairly well. They squabbled and had minor disagreements, but it was obvious that they’d both grown up from their schoolboy ways.
Draco shot Harry an incredulous look before returning to his shower, ignoring Harry as completely as he could.
"I KNOW THAT RON!! I don’t know what to do! We’re trying to talk it out, get it figured out!"
"But. But what about all the bruises? The fingerprint ones on your arm and the bright ones on your hip." Harry asked, continuing to stare at Draco without even a sidelong look of acknowledgement to Blaise.
Harry looked at Draco quizzically before responding slowly, “Malfoy… Of course we’ll keep searching for him. If they find her and not him he’ll be a missing child and there will be tons of Aurors looking for him. Why would you think they wouldn’t? Do you… do you not want us to find him?” Harry asked, trying to mask the revulsion he felt. Harry had spent the past ten days wanting nothing more than to hold his boys, he couldn’t imagine not wanting to get them back if they were missing.
Draco huffed and rolled his eyes, “I trust you. Okay? I asked if you could be the one to extract me because I knew you wouldn’t let the fact I was a Death Eater stop you from saving me.”
Draco let out a laugh, "That's great! I'm glad you got to see them." He grew quiet for a moment, like he was trying to build up courage for his next question. "How’s the wife?" He asked quickly, his eyes darting away.
Harry looked up at Draco dizzily, “what question?”
“Draco. You deserve more than a wife who’s with you because you’re rich. I’m not saying don’t marry her mate, I’m just saying talk to her.”
“She’s my baby sister, of course it’s my business!” Daphne exclaimed.
Ginny scoffed, "you know how Harry. Same way as the last two came about.”
"Oh." Draco took a step back surprised.
“Draco, darling, what are you doing calling in the middle of the morning?” Pansy asked surprised as Draco’s face illuminated her grate.
“That’s why I called the best” Draco smirked. “Could you send a house-elf to go pack up my things from my old flat? I’d prefer to avoid taking one from the Manor and alerting my parents that something is amiss.”
“Draco” Pansy started gently after a minute, “We just want to see both of you happy. I know that right now this seems like a good decision but I really don’t want to see you two make a rash choice that you’re going to regret later on.”
“Maybe you do.” Astoria sneered. “And maybe, there should be a magical contract in place so that when it’s three am and you’re snoring and the babies are screaming and I’m tired of the dull pureblood-wife life than I won’t cave in a moment of weakness and head back out again.”
Draco smiled grimly, “It is though, and I’m sorry.”
Blaise laughed lightly, "You know Potter, I may not give the best blowjobs in the world but I'd like to think they don't actually count as torture."
Draco sat there in silence, unsure what to say.
“I'll be back soon.” Harry replied, nuzzling his forehead against Draco's. “It's been almost a month. One more month and I'll be back to keep you company till the trial. Things have calmed down with Lily, she's sleeping more, I can come by more often.”
Harry smiled cautiously at Draco, “I can. I hope, no matter where you end up, you find happiness.”
Draco took another sip of his drink, trying to remain detached, “He’s certainly shown me a side of him I’ve never seen before. I’m almost relieved though, maybe if he understands he’ll leave me alone.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “You’re sure?”
“It looks like they were trying to create a cheaper version of Felix Felicis, one that could be used more often than the current potion and be easier to mass produce. Their notes show so many different alterations to the recipe though, it’s hard to tell what version they were dosing Auror Potter with.”
Draco let out a full laugh, deep in his belly, “no” his hand curled in Harry’s hand, pulling slightly. Draco’s cheeks, already flushed with drink, flushed brighter as his eyes lit up, “there’s lots of ways a man’s hands can make another man feel good.”
Harry let out a sigh of relief, “Thank Merlin Draco. I’ve been so scared.”
Draco’s head went up and he stared at Daphne confused. “What do you mean I can’t marry your sister? Why?”
“What do we do now?” Ginny asked, extreme confusion written over her face.
Draco gulped “I was engaged in a domestic romantic relationship with the partner of one of the suspects. We lived together for over a year, and it only ended recently, with help from the suspect” Draco’s face tried to flush in embarrassment, but he forced his breathing to remain steady.
Harry’s head shot up, “Astoria is getting arrested in the raid?”
“I’m sorry Harry.” Draco felt tears welling into his eyes and he blinked them back. “I’m so sorry but I don’t think we can”.
Draco gave Harry a bitter smile, "First one's on the house, no payback necessary."
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes burning holes into the other’s skull, “You were going to end this though… It wasn’t some one time mistake?"
“That… That should be sufficient. How many names is he willing to give us?” Draco asked.
Astoria straightened her back, her face hard, “Draco, I’m still your best choice. Don’t throw this away. Please.”
Ron turned to face the door, wand raised on alert. His mouth turned into a soft smile when he saw Harry before he quickly replaced it with a cold look. “The moon looks very round today.” He said loudly, using the identification phrase that all Aurors knew.
Draco sighed and walked with her into the study.
“Alright?” Ron asked when Draco returned.
5/11/2006- (2 months later)
Draco’s eyes narrowed dangerously, “Harry. Who?” He spat out.
Draco laughed lightly, “Probably not. I think if I beat you again it’s just poor sportsmanship.”
“You’re right. I just wanted to make sure that you knew what you were getting yourself into.” Draco smiled softly.
What if he wasn’t? He could walk over to the desk, sign the papers, throw them in the outbox and go join Draco in the bedroom.
Draco looked at his mother in confusion, “Is that a normal part of a betrothal contract?”
Draco opened one eye and glared, “Is the news that you finally convinced Father to buy that villa in Milan and that you’ll start scheduling your visits weeks in advance instead of surprising me at five thirty in the morning?” He growled.
Draco laughed, pulling Harry closer, “I’m saying yes.”
“See?” Draco exclaimed suddenly, “We weren’t as happy as we pretended to be. We had problems and instead of fixing them we just pretended they didn’t exist”.
Harry looked at the chart cautiously, unable to see the conclusion that Draco was sure he saw.
Harry stared at Draco with surprise, his respect for Draco mounting. Claire gave him an odd look, and he realized he'd made a mistake on not reading the case file past seeing Draco was the informant. “That’s a very brave thing you did then. Turning your wife and her group in”
Draco closed his eyes, drowning in ecstasy as he ran his hands along Harry’s back, clutching the firm body that was so familiar but at the same time felt almost new to him. “I never thought I was going to get to feel you again.” Draco panted as he broke away from the kiss.
“Scorpius!” Draco yelled beside Harry, pulling himself free and running into the hot remains.
Draco hesitated a moment “She’s pretty, very pretty. And smart. She’s articulate. Brunette. She’s funny. You’ll like her. I think.”
Draco chuckled, moving his hands to start undoing the buckle of Harry's jeans, “isn't that what the monitoring spell was for? We just need to be fast.”
So I realize I said that things would cheer up, and I really did mean that. It just hasn't really happened yet. I promise, there's a resolution to this story coming, and hopefully all the angst will be worth it. Thank you for sticking with me through this, and the next two chapters are going to move things along much faster than the last couple of chapters have.
Hermione nodded her head, “But Draco, he did still love you. He does still love you. Even when the potion was strongest, and he was at his craziest. Even in the hours before we took him to St. Mungo’s, he still loved you.”
“How do you know what’ll make her happy?”
Draco shuddered, putting his lips to Harry’s neck and biting gently. “You have no clue how hot it makes me to hear you say my name.”
“I was there at the time of the confession Barrister Malfoy, I know you didn’t do anything wrong, but we need to be shown we’re taking this allegation seriously. I’ll be submitting my memories as well. Just keep your head down and we’ll make it through this.”
“Jacob was putting it in Harry’s afternoon tea. Harry didn’t know he was taking it”.
Harry reread the letter in shock, staring at the page. He looked up at Draco staring at him nervously, and tried to give him a reassuring smile, but with too much teeth showing it came out more like a grimace.
Harry gripped Draco’s shoulder lightly, “I’m sorry, Malfoy. I was just trying to help. Finish your list and I’ll make us some lunch.”
Draco snorted, "I'm no labor law expert, but I don't think they'd have a case against you with all those mandatory break periods you've been unable to take over the past month."
Draco looked up at him, “No. I’m okay… I think, maybe, maybe we should go to bed.”
“It's for my Patronus. We…. Well we may have had a few shots of firewhiskey in us before we picked our codenames for a training exercise in the academy… They just stuck.” Harry stammered, slightly embarrassed.
P.S. We know about Harry, and if you let that stop you from coming I’ll be forced to find you and hit you like no one’s done since 3rd year. Please come.
Draco looked up sheepishly “I was actually out of the country at the time on a case. We didn’t really get a chance to speak frequently enough for me to notice. When I came home it was nearly a month later and we’d broken up. Do you really think Harry’s current condition is relevant to your investigation?”
"With another bloke?" Draco asked, looking at Harry questioningly.
Harry looked Draco in the eyes, “I do.”
Harry blinked at him before answering, "Just thought it'd be good to work with someone new, and you looked free." Harry smiled lamely.
“To our family!” Harry replied, chinking his glass and then taking a long drink.
Harry narrowed his eyes, “You’d do that?”
“My point” Kathryn continued, hardening her voice, “Is that putting away a small potions dealer is hardly worth your time. Not when you could drop the charges and in return he could give you a much larger smuggling ring, and name some dirty aurors who allow this ring to thrive”
Draco laid his head on Pansy’s shoulder and finally let his tears fall. When his emotions had finally drained out, Pansy walked Draco to his new room and tucked him into bed. She laid down next to him and quietly fell asleep.
Harry looked at Draco confused, “Did you used to give head rubs often?” he asked, before quietly beginning to hum in contentment as Draco rubbed right above his ear.
Draco stood quickly and began to start pacing, his shoulders stiff and arms held behind his back. “I just want this to be over. I don’t like being away from my son for this long.”
Draco stood up, fire dancing in his eyes, “Then go marry him. You’re under no requirement to marry me, go marry him and live your life.”
"That's the second time you called me Draco. Watch it Potter, I may start to think I mean something to you, between the random stalking and the being on a first name basis" Draco grinned as he pulled Harry's pants down, exposing his dripping member.
“Are you sure this is what you really want Draco? I’ll admit, when you asked me to lunch I hadn’t expected it to be eaten two floors above your ex boyfriend’s hospital room.” Astoria smiled encouragingly at him, “Are you sure you’re really ready to marry someone else?”
“Why would he do that?”
Narcissa nodded “Yes, which used to be a common part of the traditional contract, but I do not believe I have heard of many couples including it in the past twenty years or so.”
“I appreciate that, but the only thing I need is to get back to work” Draco’s voice started to break, and he closed his eyes, slowing his breath to try to regain control. By the time that Draco opened his eyes again Hermione had left his office, and he looked the paperwork glumly. He hadn’t gotten any more work done by the time he had to head out to buy Pansy’s chocolate.
Draco was touched that Ron had come out to see him, and a big smile broke out on his face. “Alright then, let’s head to the pub.”
“That sounds good.” Harry replied, heaving himself up off the couch. He grabbed his discarded shirt, and walked back to the bedroom, feeling both elated at what had happened and apprehensive of the following day.
Harry’s face paled and he looked up at Draco, “Stress relief.” He said blankly, “Right.” He felt his heart sink to his stomach, not sure if he could stand another few hours of being just one room away from Draco wanking.
Sorry this is taking so long, life has just been so busy lately. I do think that I am going to change the rating on this from mature to explicit. I'm not positive where that line is on which is which, but I would rather by overly cautious than not.
Harry hesitated, his instincts to help a father get to his son waring against his distrust of Draco. Finally, Harry dropped his wand to his side, his eyes fluttering shut as he let out a sigh. "Fine. We'll go get him."
They landed on a dark street in a magical neighborhood, the first hints of sunrise peeking out in the horizon. Harry held his wand in front of him, trying to get his bearings in the unfamiliar neighborhood while Draco got his footing after the unexpected apparition. The air was thick with smoke, and in their disoriented state it took them a minute to find the source. Harry turned slowly and saw the plot behind him smoldering, small flames remaining in the wreckage of what was earlier that night a home.
“Very well,” Draco nodded “Give me a moment to go speak with my boss.” Draco stood and left Kathryn alone in his office. Five minutes later he returned “I’ve spoken with the head Barrister. We’ll drop the charges if we can verify the information he provides. Would now be a good time to speak with him?”
Draco looked up at Harry and glared, "There's no need, remember? You've discovered I'm not some damsel in need of saving, and you can go back to pretending I don't exist."
Harry nodded solemnly, “It would be served well with a cracker and apple slices.” He responded.
Draco took his without remark, heading over to the living room and sitting on the left side of the couch. Harry followed Draco into the room, taking the other side of the couch and beginning to eat in silence. Finally, when Harry had finished he couldn’t take the silence anymore and he turned to Draco and tried to catch his eye.
“Well, you needed to take care of Lil. She doesn't have an immune system yet,” Harry demurred.
, but he pushed it away. He put his hand on the door handle, his heart racing. He closed his eyes lightly, trying to find the power to walk away but instead he found himself turning the door handle, walking through.
"I've never done that before." Harry said slowly.
Harry looked down quickly before looking back up at Draco, “I haven’t taken it off since you gave it to me Draco. It’s one of the favorite things that I own.” Harry looked nervous, “Do you not want me to wear it anymore?”
"What good explanation could there be for bruises?"
“Keep your back straight, and face your palms up.” Draco said, practically purring as Harry complied. “Now close your eyes.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows and gave Ron a knowing look, "Tousled how Harry?"
Ginny started to cry, her face pressed into Harry's chest. "I am angry with you Harry. You left. You just left and it's been weeks."
“He’s not nearly as bad since the war ended. Didn’t even try to hex me when you told him we’d been sleeping together.”
Draco exclaimed happily as her found the whiskey, pulling out a cup before turning to Harry, “am I pouring a glass for you too?” He asked.
“I mean, it appears he’s been abusing potions for at least three months. He’s showing severe damage to his frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex. We can’t get near him to start to heal that though, and we need to get him through his detox before we can even begin to try and heal him.”
Harry knelt down until he could look Draco in the eyes, “Listen. I don’t know where he is, or what’s going on. But I promise, I’m going to find out. But before I can do that, the first thing we need to do is get you somewhere safe.”
“Any clue what the raid is about?” Harry asked Claire as they sped down the corridor to the largest of the Auror’s conference rooms.
Draco let out a laugh and Harry started to smile as well. “So, you never responded to my letter yesterday.” Harry said.
“You keep thinking I’m feeling things that I’m not. You thought I didn’t miss you. You thought I didn’t love you. You thought I was angry enough to want to hurt you. You keep thinking the very worst of me and I can’t keep dealing with it.” Draco’s voice was close to breaking, and he was praying for the conversation to be over.
Draco looked up for the first time since the landed, viewing the area listlessly before giving a very undignified shrug, “Maybe your portkey’s broken. Or maybe it meant to put us at the top of the cliff. Who knows? Maybe this is cliff is actually a house in disguise, and the house is hidden into the rocks.” Each minute that ticked past Draco looked a little more lifeless, and Harry needed to get him inside.
Harry gave Draco a bewildered look, “But we are chasing a criminal. She killed multiple families. They’re going to bring her to justice for that.”
Harry set a quick monitoring charm on the boys and Draco raised his eyebrows. As soon as they were in the library Draco pulled Harry by the hips and pressed up against him.
Harry narrowed his eyes, "And one more thing Malfoy. If this whole thing was an elaborate trap planned by you, and my partner died for nothing, I’ll kill you myself."  Harry tightened his grip on Draco's arm, whisking him away in an apparition before he'd had a chance to respond.
Ginny had joined him for dinner each night, and stayed after each meal until after the boys had gone to bed. They'd had an opportunity to talk about what was and was not working in their relationship. Harry was still unwilling to quit his job, and Ginny was still insistent that he needed to. Leaving the boys with Ginny that morning had broken Harry's heart, even though he knew he'd be back with them in a week.
Draco didn’t say anything for a moment, swallowing harshly before saying, “It’s not that. It’s yours… I had just assumed you stopped wearing it after,” he stopped, realizing this Harry didn’t know about the watch, or what used to be housed inside of it, “After something that happened while you were drugged.”
Harry got a mischievous look on his face, “So are you super excited to live with Ron?” He asked playfully.
room with Malfoy- if they wanted to avoid improper fraternization then they needed to do a better job keeping their Aurors from prolonged isolation with attractive blond gits. No, Harry thought bitterly, he could protect Draco just fine and still be inside of him.
“No, thank you.” The first Auror, Auror Jackson replied tersely. “Barrister Malfoy, I apologize for the intrusion. We’re working on the investigation of the potions smuggler, and we were hoping you could help us out.”
“Deeper” Draco said, his hand firmly pressing against Harry’s sternum.
“Draco!” Hermione exclaimed, “You haven’t even listened to other options!”
What Harry saw was much different than what he had imagined. Instead of Blaise threatening and squeezing Draco so hard he would bruise, Blaise was on his knees in front of Draco, with Draco's pants around his ankles and his hands in Blaise's hair as Blaise quickly released his mouth from around Draco's hard cock.
Harry walked up behind Draco nervously, before putting his hand on his shoulder. “We need to get out of here. Whoever set this fire, they could come back. We need to get somewhere safe.” Harry tried to sound strong but he was anxious to get his charge out of the open and into a shelter.
“I made an appointment for tomorrow afternoon.”
Harry stood up, his hand brushing against Draco’s temple before he wandered to his own bed, “Good night,
Draco pulled off for a moment, looking Harry in the eyes, “Can I do something else?”
Only four months out of the academy, Claire still had a drive to want to complete everything, and by now paperwork was taking her about half the time it took Harry. He considered going over to her desk to see how she had managed to write a two page report on “Mom files missing person’s report on her child, after forgetting to pick him up from his grandparents and wasting an entire morning for nothing.” It’s not that Harry couldn’t write the report, it was just that he doubted Robards was appreciating just how often the word ‘moron’ was appearing in his paperwork lately.
Just then, a ding came from the inbox, and Harry rushed forward to grab it, excited to see what Ron had to say about Draco’s theory. Inside, instead of a small paper envelope, was a large manila envelope addressed to Harry in an unfamiliar script. He opened it slowly, pulling out a thick stack of paperwork, and a letter. He walked over to couch, and sat down heavily to read the letter.
“To kill Harry Fucking Potter.” Draco threw the powder into the grate and called out Harry’s address, stepping in without bothering to brush his hair or grab his wand.
"I miss being a seeker. 8th years aren't allowed on the house teams, so I thought maybe you missed it too."
Draco looked down at his drink “It was a difficult day. It’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about”
On their first anniversary Draco had planned out a romantic proposal, down on one knee with a fireworks show that would go off in the background. During dinner though, Harry and Draco had argued; Harry once again had wanted to go somewhere muggle where they wouldn’t get spotted and Draco had been frustrated by feeling like their relationship was a secret from everyone except their closest friends. Though the fight had ended, Draco had felt it would be best to wait to propose until Harry was finally ready to let the world know about their relationship. He clutched the ring in his finger, filled with regret.
Two weeks had passed before they felt safe having the children all together again. The boys ran to Ginny in relief, and Harry snuggled Lily close to him. That afternoon Harry strapped Lily to his chest and Gin buckled Albus into a stroller and the five of them set off to a park together to play. By the time they got home and had dinner and bath time and Ginny tucked the boys into bed while Harry tried to get Lily down.
Draco nodded, taking in the information. “Well. Hopefully you won’t have to. Thank you, for everything. Enjoy the time with your boys.” Draco said mechanically.
"Hickeys?" Harry asked angrily, his voice raising three octaves to a shrill whine, "Malfoy is appearing covered in bruises and you want to just dismiss them as hickeys?"
Draco walked over and sat on the couch, “what do you think she wants to talk about?” He asked, trying to sound disinterested.
Ginny laughed lightly, “you've got 11 hours. After that we get our little scream machine back.”
“What does it look like Potter? I’m meditating.” Draco drawled, his voice serene.
"Odd?" Hermione asked, "How do you mean?"
Harry growled, he was done thinking. He stood up, walking down the hallway. He reached the bedroom door and steeled himself. The little voice rose up again,
Harry finally spotted Draco on the top floor, “and go,” he signaled quietly as he pulled Claire’s arm to side-along her to right behind where Draco stood. As silently as possible, Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him back towards him, tensing and hoping Draco would remember to be silent. Waiting until the other Auror’s were in place, Harry quickly nodded to Claire before wrapping his arms around Draco and side-alonging him to a safehouse they could use to floo to the ministry from.
“Over here,” Draco called, waving them over to where Scorpius was riding his toy broom around. James and Albus ran forward, and Draco wrapped them both in a large hug. “What a nice surprise.”
Ron smirked at him, “I’ve spent more than half of my life around Hermione, it had to rub off somewhat. I just hope she’s having as good of luck talking with Harry.”
Harry started, his breath catching in surprise when he felt Draco’s kiss before his brain seemed to catch up to what was happening. Suddenly, it clicked how good Draco felt, and Harry began enthusiastically moving his own lips against Draco’s. Draco quickly deepened the kiss, his mouth opening and his tongue probing at Harry’s lip seeking entrance. Harry opened his mouth, a flash of desire running through him as he pulled Draco to him. Harry’s hands slowly moved down Draco’s body, his hand searing Draco’s skin and sending him into action.
Harry exhaled softly before trying to return Draco's smile, though he worried it came out more as a grimace. "Morning. How was your week?"
Draco immediately paled. How could Harry have not changed his medical paperwork in two months, especially with everything going on? He considered not going, but based on the sound of Hermione’s voice he realized something serious was going on. Draco gritted his teeth and sent a memo to his boss before heading back to the Floos.
Harry's mind froze, and he gaped at her. They had agreed to a divorce, recognized that they didn't make each other happy anymore. Sure, the past six weeks they'd been a good team, but they'd both been off work. There'd been no late nights in the office, no emergency meetings interfering with plans, no obligations. Nine months ago these words were all Harry wanted to hear, but now it was too late, right?
Ron and Hermione shared a long look before Ron just shrugged and changed the subject to discuss their newest Defense Against the Dark Arts project.
Astoria hesitated a moment before plastering a smile on her face. “Draco.  I like you. I think you’re going to make an excellent husband and a great father to our children. But I know this isn’t the life you had planned for yourself. If, at some point, you were to decide that you needed… more … than I was able to give you, I wouldn’t begrudge you your happiness. But I would want it to be in a way that we had agreed upon; terms that were being adhered to.”
“What do you mean withdrawals?” Draco asked in surprise.
Ron frowned at that, “You need to talk to her. There’s… There’s something really important that you two need to get figured out. You haven’t signed the divorce papers yet, right?”
As Draco watched his wand sail into Harry's hand, he let out a screech, "Potter, what the bloody hell was that and what do you think you're doing?!"
Ginny threw her arms around him, clutching him close. Her wild red hair pressed against the top of his nose, and he inhaled the familiar scent of her.
Pansy had come by a few times, and Draco had lunch with Astoria again. He tried to keep the topics light, refusing to answer questions and not telling them about his visit with the Aurors. Inside, though, Draco was in turmoil. As much as he tried not to think about it, he couldn’t help but wonder what in the past few months was Harry being Harry, and what was the potion. He tried not to think about what if’s and questions, but on Friday morning he came home, locking his floo, and poured himself a whiskey, intent not to have to think again till Monday morning.
Annoyance flashed on Harry's face, "Ginny. No. I haven't gotten to see them in a month."
"Malfoy, I mean it. It was an accident. I'm sorry."
Harry nodded his head seriously, taking the case folder Robards handed him. Skimming it over quickly he looked up puzzled, “Draco Malfoy has been your informant,” he asked incredulously.
Draco bit down on Harry's clavicle, and Harry felt his brain shutter to a stop. His hands moved of their own accord and began opening Draco's trousers, pulling out the hard cock within. Draco moaned into Harry's neck, batting Harry's hands away and pulling both of their cocks together into his own hand.
“Because she’s been happy! She’s been so happy the past few years, and I don’t want to see her give it up to marry a man she doesn’t love just to fit some stupid pureblood ideology that should have died out generations ago!”
Harry breathed a sigh of relief, “that sounds like a good idea. Get some rest.”
“Do they?” Astoria asked in an almost pouting voice “I was thinking maybe we could negotiate things out and save them the trouble. We got the paperwork back from your solicitors today and they seem to have made some odd changes.”
"No." Harry said firmly, "I didn't save his life in the room of requirements just to watch people hurt him now."
Harry found himself closing the distance between them, his hand reaching out for Draco’s arm. “It hasn’t been all awful, being here.”
Draco sat down and Harry finished re-setting the wards before he sat down on the armchair situated nearest to Draco. Harry aimed his wand towards the kitchen, summoning a tea tray for them. The tray flew out of the kitchen and onto the coffee table, pouring three cups. Draco picked up one of the cups nervously, making frequent glances to the fireplace as he awaited the call from the ministry.
Blaise put a hand on Harry's shoulder to stop him from going after Draco, "Give up. You're not going to get anywhere arguing with him when he's in a stint like this."
“Just this week” Harry stopped. “I’m sorry. I should have waited and broken things off with you, but you didn’t have time for us to talk about it and it just sort of happened”
Ron Weasley’s voice penetrated Draco’s deliberate concentration “Ya know Draco, Nothing says let’s celebrate this engagement quite like spending hours lighting things on fire”
The Aurors left Draco’s office with him still staring blackly ahead in his chair. Finally, Draco closed his eyes in pain and put his head down on his desk.
"It's fine Potter." Draco replied gruffly as he headed into the locker room.
Astoria’s face hardened slightly. “You’re a pureblood wizard, I’m a pureblood witch. If I don’t marry you, I’ll have to marry someone else. You’re as good as any other option.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“All yours. Always,” Harry panted, pulling his wand from his bedside table, he quickly muttered a lubing and a stretching charm on himself before sinking onto Draco’s hard cock. “Fuck.” Harry exclaimed, “You feel so good inside me Draco.”
Harry let out a laugh, “It was wonderful, Draco. You were wonderful.”
"Thought it might help," Draco said gruffly, thrusting the very full glass into Harry's hand.
Draco glared at that, his eyes flashing with anger, “I didn’t make you throw away any vows. You chose to come in here Potter, and you seemed to already know what you wanted before you walked through the door. Maybe, if your wife expected you to be upholding your vows she shouldn’t have asked for a divorce.” Draco pushed off at that, walking out of the bedroom and to the bathroom to take a shower, leaving a very confused Harry lying despondently on the floor.
Draco stood up and pulled Harry up with him. Draco put his hands on Harry’s hips and pulled him in for a bruising kiss, trying to convey all his love and passion through his lips. Harry melted into the kiss, the tension leaving his body as he wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck. Finally, Draco pulled away from the kiss and moved back, taking a deep breath and opening his eyes.
Draco snorted, “Well. I guess she’s getting her way.”
Draco dropped the subject, but was obviously still upset. Harry didn’t blame him, but there wasn’t much he could do about it. He’d been honest with Draco, the ministry obviously wasn’t rushing to bring him home and that was a bit surprising. Though he’d never asked for special treatment, he had never imaged that he’d be trapped for two weeks away from his family with his in-laws raising his kids for him.
Harry shook his head, looking quickly over at his bag where he knew they rested just inside. He thought back to the previous afternoon, where he’d been so tempted to just sign the papers. “Not yet. I think I might though.”
As the three settled into the couches, Narcissa looked at Draco expectantly “So I read that you had a difficult case yesterday.”
“This case was brought to me. I tried to recuse myself as soon as I realized you were involved. I didn’t believe that you would be a part of this, but I didn’t want any part in the case against you.”
Harry headed over to the kitchen and immediately pulled the stopper from the hangover potion, and drank it down in one large sip. Almost immediately Harry felt the potion take effect, his head stopped throbbing and his stomach stopped rebelling against him. Looking up, he saw Draco watching him warily. Harry grabbed his sandwich and wandered into the living room, sitting it the chair near the couch. Harry ate his sandwich in silence, apprehension brewing in his stomach. He knew he needed to talk to Draco about the previous night, but he didn’t know what to say.
Draco nodded, “So once I’ve got Scorpius back I can leave?”
Draco stepped through the floo into the total darkness of Harry’s flat, quickly maneuvering his way to the bedroom that used to be his. From the bedroom doorway Draco looked in, “What in Merlin’s name is wrong with you, you stupid wanker?!” Draco screamed.
Harry crouched down to look at Draco, and then started very carefully, “No. I’m sorry. I love you so much Draco, but I’m tired. I’m tired of you not having time for me, of always wondering where I stand with you. I’m tired of nights where I’m on stake-out or out working and I’m missing you and then I come home and find out you’ve been busy and haven’t missed me at all. Then you go away for weeks and I’m just here alone. I’m sorry Draco, but I can’t keep doing this.”
Harry shot up, “Draco,” He said quickly, shaking his head as he tried to wake up, “What are you doing here?”
Draco rolled his eyes again before he stood up, walking his plate into the kitchen to begin cleaning it. “I’m sorry okay? I didn’t expect it to turn into this. I expected it was going to be two hours and then my wife would be in jail and I would thank you and then head away to go pick up my son and you’d be free to continue with your life. I didn’t mean to trap you here with me.”
Harry’s brain stuttered, Draco’s teeth grazing against his neck making him lose control of his thoughts as he groaned. His hands stroked up Draco’s thighs to his waist.
Harry rose and headed slowly to the living room, grabbing at the letter and smiling faintly as he recognized Ron’s scrawl.
Draco rolled his eyes, “That's not what I meant. You know I've enjoyed being here with you.”
Harry stood as well, his face flushed, "You think I don't bloody know that? Yes, it's my family but I shouldn't have to choose! I love my job!"
“Of course! Why wouldn’t I take my mate out for a pint when he’s just agreed to get betrothed to a girl he’s known for less than a week?” Ron smiled cheekily as he slapped Draco on the back.
"I. Uh. Merlin" Harry closed his eyes and gulped, "I want you Draco." Harry's denial wouldn't make it through his lips as he saw the blond beneath him.
“Yeah, sure, cause those are easy to come by. It’ll be super easy to find a Secret Keeper while I’m here pretending to be under arrest.”
Draco shuddered softly in mock horror, “That’s completely intolerable. That’s what I can do! I’ll create a scotch distillery in America. Drauphnir’s Distilled Spirits. Has a bit of a ring to it right?”
“I… That’s what you meant by stress relief?” Harry asked standing at the door dumbfounded.
Harry set a quick monitoring charm on Scorpius and then went up to check on Draco. Guiltily, he worried that Draco might have started drinking when he came back from his walk and would be somewhere passed out. Each room he checked, his alarm grew worse and worse.
"I am glad you're safe." She said eventually.
“We think there’s a chance he could have been taking one of the new drugs they were working on.”
"Sorry Malfoy, looks like it's just something from Ginny. I'll just go deal with this in the other room..." Harry trailed off, the stack of papers feeling suddenly more heavy in his hands. Breathing deeply, he stood up on wobbly legs to head to the bedroom. Finally, closing the door behind him and sitting down on his bed he set the letter aside to see the stack of paperwork behind it. His eyes immediately drew to the top of the page, and his breath whooshed out of his lungs.
Draco grimaced slightly before nodding his head “Well then, fancy a game of chess while we wait?”
Harry moaned around Draco’s cock one last time before pulling up, “Not like this,” He panted, catching his breath, “I want you to come inside me.”
They sat in silence for a moment, Harry staring Draco down.
Harry turned red, muttering “oh course” while examining his hands. “Well, if you could make a list of all of your properties, I can pass that along to Ron.”
Harry gave a soft smile, “At least I'll be back before then. We'll have some more time together before you leave.”
Draco nodded his thanks and they grew silent again.
Harry hesitated before he closed his eyes nervously. “Now what?”
Harry’s eyes narrowed, “I’m serious, Ron. His son is missing and he hasn’t seen him in a month. Think of how you would feel if that was Rose. Cut him some slack.”
“Mine.” Draco responded back, pulling Harry closer, “All mine.”
"Shit. Shit. You okay?" Harry asked worriedly as he scrambled off of Draco.
Harry shook his head lightly, "No Malfoy. I'm not leaving you alone here. My family is fine. Gin and I have been having problems since Al was born, this might have been the catalyst but it's not the origin of our problems. The boys are fine. They're surrounded by family who loves them and care about them; I miss them but I'm here for you. Soon you'll be reunited with your son, and I'm get to go back home and see mine. Till then I'm here for you."
Draco rested his head on Hermione’s shoulder as she gently rubbed soothing circles into his back. Finally he nodded, “I’ll go. Let me get dressed and we can go.”
An hour later and the empty bottle of scotch sat on the coffee table in front of Harry and Draco, who were sprawled haphazardly across the couch. Draco wasn’t sure how they had ended up in the position that they were in, but he was much too comfortable to move. He was sitting on the side of the couch, body up against the armrest with his feet up on the long edge of the couch, his blonde hair splayed against the back of the couch. Harry rested sideways on the couch, his legs hanging over the other arm rest and his body laying back taking up a full two cushions, and head rested gently on Draco’s thigh. When Potter had first flopped down Draco had tried to push his head off, but instead Draco found his hand gently petting through Potter’s dark hair; it was softer than he had thought it would be.
Draco stiffened “I tried love. It didn’t work out. Now it’s time to try something else. I’m ready to be the man you raised me to be. I thought you would be happy”
Harry felt his blush flush all the way up to his ears, "I see. Well... I'm sorry for interrupting." Harry turned to run before he was suddenly halted.
“Theo’s been out of country for over a month, so it looks like your theory has some merit. Do you know any of his known associates? Someone who might not be obvious on paper but who he might turn to?” Harry asked.
Afterwards Harry rested his head on Draco's shoulder, breathing in his familiar scent and allowing his heart rate to return to normal. Finally, he shoved himself back into his trousers and went to take a seat on a chair.
They ate in companionable silence, finishing the bottle of wine in record time with their meals.
“What if they find her and not him?” Draco said quickly, “What if she stashes him away with some distant relative? Will they stop looking after they’ve found her?”
Draco looked up to see Harry biting his lower lip, eyeing Draco and Blaise appraisingly, his trousers tenting obviously.
“Probably less of a workaholic than the woman who's due date was two days ago yet is still here at work”
“Can we be completely crazy and have a bottle of wine with dinner?” Ginny said conspiratorially, her eyes sparkling.
"How dare you?!" She sobbed, pointing her wand at Harry angrily. "How dare you imply I would cheat on you Harry Potter? I have done nothing but love you, and care for you, and take care of you for years. I haven't even thought about being with another man since I was fifteen years old. I wait here every day for you to get home from saving the world, and you think I’m off sleeping with someone else?"
Ron had begrudgingly agreed to check on Draco every few days to make sure there wasn't anything he needed. Harry felt guilty he hadn't had a free moment to check in with Draco himself, but knew he needed to focus on his kids at the moment.
Harry let out a bitter laugh, “Ah yes, you can have me. Don't worry Draco, you have me. I’m so ridiculously into you, in love with you, and you're going to leave me in a month. Glad you can be happy I'm not reconciling with my wife because it means you can enjoy another month of fucking me.”
Draco snorted lightly, "No. But it does make you dumb. You can't get a divorce while your wife is pregnant unless you can prove it's not your baby."
There was another letter from Head Auror Robards, giving most of the same information as Ron’s letter, but as an official command. Harry read it over briefly before turning his attention to the letter from Ginny which had come with Ron’s letter.
Finally, desperately, after checking every other room in the house, Harry made his way to the boys  bedroom. Draco was not there, but sitting on the nightstand next to the gliding chair lay Draco's wand. Harry sat down, trying to go back through hazy memories to remember if he'd seen Draco with his wand or not.
Pansy rolled her eyes “That’s fine. I’m going to go find you an apartment. Meet me in my office at 4 and I’ll take you to your new home.”
Harry walked over to his own fallen broom and picked it up, walking slowly to the locker room behind Draco. When Harry arrived Draco was already in the shower, and Harry walked over to try and apologize again.
“You understand correctly. It’s time to move on. I want to move on.” Draco’s grip on his drink tightened but he forced his face to stay cool and collected.
Harry ran to the hallway from the kitchen, a pot of noodles still clutched in his hands, “What are you talking about?” He asked.
Draco stared at the contract in confusion. “I’m not getting married to have an affair later on, I want that out of here.” He thought for a moment, “And so what if our children are squibs? I don’t want to just keep having them until we get a magical child, that’s ludicrous. Take that out please.”
“Should we move this into the bedroom?” Draco asked, pulling his lips away to start nibbling on Harry’s jaw.
Harry nodded his head in agreement, the sudden though of Draco getting hurt seeming to sober him up a bit. The moment was broken, and though he wanted to kneel back down and kiss Draco again, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Instead, Harry reached a hand out for Draco to grab onto, and after a slight struggle they were both standing. Harry kept hold of Draco, slowly walking him into the bedroom.
“Father,” Draco glared, “I’m not going to stoop to poisoning my old lovers no matter how annoying they act”
Draco took a deep breath, his eyes twinkling. “I want to give you a going away present.”
Harry stood up, stretching his arms over his head he sighed and headed to the door; there was no way the report was being written without some caffeine. As Harry reached for the door handle the wood slammed forward and Claire ran in, face flushed and slightly out of breath.
“I dunno. I’m not sure what they have planned. But I’ll try. Do you… Do you want me to try to come back?”
After hours of flying Draco was sore and hungry, and since he had skipped breakfast he decided it was time to find some food. Touching down outside of a village, Draco shrunk his broom and shoved it into his pocket before searching for a restaurant.
Harry woke the following morning earlier than normal, and was done showering by six. He wandered into the kitchen, intent to make Draco breakfast like Draco had done for him so often. He pulled out the ingredients for blueberry pancakes and bacon, and quickly got to work. By the time Draco awoke, the entire house smelled of breakfast and Harry was just finishing plating their meals.
Harry was shaking, his entire focus on the wicked things Draco was doing to his cock. He tried to hold his orgasm off, but he couldn’t. He stuttered to Draco, telling him he was close with barely enough warning before he felt himself explode in Draco’s mouth. Draco swallowed him down, keeping Harry’s prick in his mouth as his throat filled with cum. He gave himself a couple more strokes, until he too was shuddering his release.
Harry’s head went up at the mention of his partner, “How is she?” He asked anxiously.
“Draco.” Narcissa started at Draco walked in the door. “Were we expecting you?”
Draco smiled, “You want to clear your mind. Breath. Just inhale in, and exhale out. Let go of everything else and focus on your breathing.”
Harry smirked, thrusting upwards again, “Is that right Draco?”
Harry stood up suddenly, “I apologize, Narcissa, Draco, but I should be off. Thank you for the tea. We’ll talk more about meeting in Saint Malo at another time.” Harry walked to the floo and immediately left, before either Draco or his mother could respond.
“4 it is. I’ll bring you some of those chocolates you like as a thank you for arranging everything…. And to show appreciation for your discretion at this difficult time”
Draco continued to stare at Harry incredulously, before finally clearing his throat, “Well, thank you, Potter. I’ll consider it.”
Narcissa pursed her lips, trying to look apologetic while actually looking happy, “It’s for Harry.” She almost whispered.
Harry felt his heart drop through his stomach, of course that’s why Draco was acting so peculiar. When Ginny sent over the divorce paperwork the night before, they’d been waiting for a response to Draco’s theory on who was helping Astoria. Draco must have been driving himself crazy knowing there was a letter waiting for Harry while Harry was sleeping. Harry felt a large missive of guilt as he walked to the inbox, and lifted up a letter from Ron.
“So tell me dearest, what happened between the last time I saw you and this morning that necessitated this large of an adjustment.”
“You’ll be safe, right?” Ginny asked after Harry informed her he had to go out for a case.
Draco sat quietly for a minute before asking “The Ashwinder egg. That’s used in almost every love potion out there. Could the potion have been used like a love potion?”
“She’s not a baby.” Draco scoffed. “She’s a 24 year old witch who’s allowed to make her own decision.”
“Still no word.”
“I wish everyday could be like today.” Ginny mused, a delicate smile playing on her lips.
Draco’s eyes glinted, his hand reaching out and moved his rook, “check” he smiled, blinding Harry with the brightness in his look.
“Drugged. Like, against his will?” Draco leaned back in disgust. He’d tried his hardest in the past day to not think about what could have caused Harry to start abusing potions, tried to push Harry out of his mind even while he was waiting to hear from the doctor how his condition was. The idea of someone intentionally harming Harry hadn’t even entered his mind. “Do you have any idea what the potions were meant to do?”
Draco’s head dropped to his chest and he took a deep breath, “What if you get tired of waiting?”
Draco tensed underneath him, 100 what if situations flitting across his brain.
"Well. They could be hickeys." Ron said cautiously.
Draco’s eyes turned dark, “What’s so wrong with Harry?”
Harry smiled, keeping his voice as neutral as he could. “Take care of yourself, yeah?”
“So before we go, I just have to ask,” Harry hesitated, “is this a date? Or are we just going out as friends? It’s fine, either way, whichever you want. I just want to know so I don’t make any mistakes.”
Harry nodded her way before turning back to Draco. He waited until Hermione had left before starting, “I’ve missed you, Draco. I’m so sorry about everything that happened, but please know I would never willingly put you through that. I love you.”
“I told Draco about the potion.” Hermione told Harry.
"No," Harry replied, his voice so quiet it was practically a whisper, "he rolled up his sleeve and he had a set of fingerprint bruises on his arm. It looked like someone had dragging him. I think this is worse than I realized. People are actually hurting him."
"WELL FIGURE IT OUT FASTER!"
After distributing out small bouquets to everyone in his office, Draco sat down to write Harry a note.
Harry pulled out some yogurt and a banana for Scorpius, and summoned a hangover potion for himself. Once Scorpius was eating and Harry was feeling human again he cast a quick tempus charm and noted with alarm that it was ten in the morning.
“So you’re really excited to get Astoria home, throw her on the bed and have wild and crazy newlywed sex the moment your vows are finished?” Pansy asked.
Harry looked at Draco, his eyes full of panic, “listen… Malfoy… we should… we should probably talk about last night.”
“I’ve missed you every moment we’ve been apart Harry, every day. I’ve loved you every second of every day; from the very first kiss I’ve been entirely yours.” Draco’s voice started to break and he took another deep breath “I’m sorry it wasn’t enough for you. I’ll send a house-elf for my things”
When Draco finished speaking he stormed off, walking out the front door and heading down the block. Draco’s eyes started to prick as he kept walking, and he tried to speed up to calm the emotions storming through him. Draco broke into a slow jog, his bare feet hitting the pavement as his pajama pants tangled around his legs. He finally stopped and ducked into an alley, leaning against the wall and letting out a wail of despair.  “I can’t. I just can’t do this anymore” he muttered to himself.
Harry smirked, “I never said great… Though I might if you get me a refill.” He held up his empty glass, his eyes slightly glassy from the already consumed scotch.
When Draco flopped down onto his bed Harry sat on the edge, “How’s your head? I’d offer to heal you but I’m not sure I’d be steady enough with my wand.”
Draco,
Friday-
"Figured you didn't." Draco said dismissively, turning his face away from Harry.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Whatever for? I thought you were just there helping with the kids.”
thank you for tonight.”
Harry kept looking at Draco, his brows knit together. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”
Harry finally looked over at Hermione like he was seeing her for the first time. “Thank you. Thank you for getting him here”.
Alright, here is the second to last chapter. Hope everyone enjoys!
Thank you all for reading so far! Please let me know what you think so far down below!
Draco looked at Harry cautiously, “Listen. Potter. It’s okay. It didn’t have to mean anything. You’re stressed, I’m stressed. It was just some stress relief.”
“Draco, mate… do you even really know her?”
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table, trying to catch Draco's eye. When Draco finally looked over, Harry smiled at him. Draco looked around confused before grimacing at Harry.
Astoria laughed and kissed Draco again, holding him close as they heard the click of cameras beside them.
Draco's eyes hardened, “More time living in your hospitality unable to start our lives.”
Sorry this is taking so long to upload, thanks for everyone sticking with me through this!
They met in the kitchen, Ginny pouring them each a large glass of wine.
It started, unexpectedly, at the engagement party of Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry Potter, long time best friend of the couple, decided to bury the hatchet and buy a drink for Draco Malfoy, the coworker with whom Hermione had been working closest in recent months. It started as a simple way to put bygones aside, and ended with a tumble into bed aided by two bottles of champagne and one of Ogden’s finest. One night of amazing sex quickly turned to multiple nights, and by the time of Ron and Hermione’s wedding Harry and Draco were spending nearly every night in each other’s arms.
Harry eyed Ron strangely, "you guys didn't talk at all?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck. Please Draco,” Harry cries, “please come. I want you to fill me up.”
Despite his assurances, Harry was getting nervous about the length of time they had spent waiting to hear from Robards. He wished he could risk floo calling, but knew that if something had gone wrong he could put Draco at risk by contacting the ministry. As time continued to pass, Claire slowly drifted off on the side of the couch while Harry and Draco stared ahead blankly.
Harry pulled him closer, “I love you Draco, and I’ll wait forever if you need me to in order for you to trust me again. I promise Draco, Forever.” Harry whispered hoarsely.
Draco put a soft smile on his face, “I’m glad you’re able to see your family.”
“It’s perfect. The best choice I ever made.” Daphne beamed, “I’m so lucky I got to marry the love of my life, it really makes every day better knowing that no matter what happens in the outside world I get to go home to my Adri every night.”
“Can’t it be both?” Astoria asked coyly.
"I dunno." Harry said, "Like maybe he'd been in a fight or something. I just worry that maybe someone's been bullying him. He's mostly alone except for Blaise and Theo, and he was a death eater. I just worry some people might be trying to pick fights with him instead of moving on."
Draco’s voice turned bitter, his nostrils raising in a snarl. “I promise. Things are over with Harry. I don’t even recognize the man he is right now. I’m realizing now that I didn’t really know him at all.” Draco spat.
“Oh Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, “Was it actually?”
Harry’s head shot back, “What? No. That was a drunken mistake and we can never do that again.”
“Have you seen the healer yet?” Astoria asked as she sat down, her eyes flickering to Harry’s letter in his hands before narrowing slightly.
“What are the side effects?” Draco asked.
Harry's heart soared as he and Draco faced off on their brooms. The familiar adrenaline raced through Harry's blood as he let his competitive side take over. The two of them had always been able to fly circles around each other, both hyper aware of the other's position in a way they just
Harry walked over to the door, opening it behind Ron to shout back at him, "WELL I GUESS YOU THOUGHT WRONG!" He yelled after Ron before slamming the door again and placing the required locking charms on it. Harry stormed over to the couch and threw himself back against it, his whole body trembling in anger.
Well, thank you everyone for reading my first fic! I hope you enjoyed it, please feel free to leave your thoughts and critics below.
Harry let out a snort, “I can guarantee if someone had told me back then that this would be our lives now I would have checked them into St. Mungo’s.” Harry paused thoughtfully for a moment, “Though I suppose it’s not all bad. You’re a lot better than you used to be Malfoy.”
“Not at all. I’m perfectly fine. Harry has decided he wants to see other people and that’s where we’re at. Can you get me sorted or should I call someone else?”
The portkey landed in a wooded area next to a high cliff, with the wind blowing harshly against them. The faint light was barely bright enough to make out where they were, and Harry quickly lit a lumos on his wand, lifting it into the air to get a sense of their surroundings, confusion slowly dawning on his face. Harry kept on glancing nervously at Draco, who stood almost lifelessly beside him, as he searched for an indication of where the safehouse was.
Draco looked up with a glare “The beginning of betrothal negotiations is a far cry from an engagement Weasel, something that most pureblood wizards would know” Though the words were harsh they were said with none of their old bite, and an almost affectionate smirk played upon Draco’s face by the end.
Draco looked up at Harry cautiously, “Well. That’s… That’s good for you right? You’ll get to see your boys.”
Draco narrowed his eyes, straightening his spine he pulled out a note pad. “That’s a very serious charge. I assume he has some proof?”
Draco looked like he'd been punched in the gut. “You're drunk,” he said stiffly, “You don't know what you're saying. I…. I need to get out of here. I need a walk.”
Draco stared at Harry furiously, "I don't have to explain my sex life to you Potter, but if you're really that concerned I can assure you they were all received while I was an eager participant."
Draco quickly walked to the elevators, snapping his hands impatiently as he waited for the lift to arrive. “I edited to my wards to not let through any mail containing the words Harry or Potter.” He said sheepishly. “So you don’t know if this is poison or plant damage?”
“Why’d you come in here?” Draco asked, his eyes slightly unfocused.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, Draco slowly sipping his scotch and Harry writing a quick recap of the day for his report. Draco smiled at Harry, “I wonder what the scotch tastes like in America.” Draco mused.
Harry crawled along the bed to where Draco was sitting, coming up behind him and wrapping him in a hug. Harry dropped his mouth to Draco’s ear, “I’ll wait for you, for as long as you need.” He swore.
“Daphne’s married, correct?” Harry asked.
Draco stared at Harry, his eyebrows furled together in confusion. “I…. I couldn’t ask that of you.”
Head Barrister Krones stared at Draco in shock. He looked like Draco had just told him he liked to murder kittens in his spare times. For the six years Draco had worked in the Ministry Legal Department they had never discussed their personal lives. “Thank you for informing me Barrister Malfoy. I can remove you from the new case which your original case has created, but I need to ask you if you are able to stay impartial in the original case long enough to appear before the judge to enter the plea. You already signed the paperwork, and if we try to assign a new prosecutor now he has to write a new statement and provide new memories.”
Draco gave a derisive laugh, “Oh, I know. The ministry needs to get their golden boy home soon. I’m surprised they’ve managed to go this far without having to call you back for some crup and pony show”
“Decided to join me?” Draco asked calmly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I take these off?”
I’ve know you for almost 20 years, you’ve never called me Draco before.” His voice was sing-songy in his taunt.
Draco swallowed, staring at the line of Harry’s neck. “I could show you.” He said gruffly.
, but the more Harry had stared at Draco the less that either of those had meant. Though Harry wasn’t sure exactly where he stood on attraction to all men, after his dreams the past couple of nights he could confidently say that he was at least attracted to Draco. He felt like a cad, he’d left his wife and children for work one evening and now it had been over a month and he hadn’t come home and he was having to remind himself to not molest the man he was in charge of keeping safe.
“Good,” Draco purred, putting a possessive hand on Harry's back.
Harry nodded, “Well, hopefully they’ll find Scorpius tomorrow and we won’t even have to think about it. I just wish you could leave here too.”
“They need their father more than the world needs its savior. You’re the one who wanted a family so soon, stay home and be with them and leave saving the world up to someone else for once.” Ginny pleaded, her face contorting into a pout as she pushed away from Harry and walked across the room.
Ron frowned, "I've made do. Read a bit, kipped on the couch mostly. I tried the crossword in the Daily Profit but I'm no good at it. The ferret's stayed in his room most of the time, though he's came out and cooked us each food a couple of times a day, so I'm pretty sure he's still alive. I'm not sure how you kept sane here for an entire month alone."
Harry nodded carefully, “I hope so. It sounds like they’re close.”
Draco crumpled the letter into a ball and threw it onto the counter, his eyes burning.
Harry’s room was bright; stark white walls and ceiling on top of white linoleum. Harry sat at an incline in his bed, a light blanket pulled up to his chest, twirling his glasses in front of his face. He didn’t even bother to look up when Hermione and Draco first walked into the door, just continued fidgeting with his glasses while he said “I’m still feeling fine and you can let me leave anytime now.”
The next morning as Draco was getting ready for work he decided to indulge Ron and sent Astoria an owl asking her to meet him for lunch. As Draco sat down at his desk he began to take out a case folder when he was met with an otter patronus “Draco, I’m sorry, but we need you to come to St. Mungo’s immediately. You’re still Harry’s medical power of attorney and they need you.” Hermione’s voice sounded distraught.
Draco groaned but followed his mother anyways, resigning himself to an evening with his parents.
Draco’s lips curled into a smirk, “Don’t be sorry. I enjoyed it, in fact I think it would be a nice little outlet for us to both let off some steam while we’re trapped here.”
“I know.” Draco gave her a hug, “Don’t worry so much mother. I asked for this”. Draco smiled at her reassuringly.
Looking around frantically, Harry finally found a small hole in the cliff face, that when he put his hand inside turned into a door that he could pull open.  "Finally!" Harry exclaimed in relief, his high voice startling Draco out of staring blankly at the ground.
“That’s right. You and your date who you are madly in love with and completely devoted to. You are going to be seen dining together, dancing together, and you will dote on them so completely that no one there could imagine you having any lingering feelings for anyone else. Do I make myself clear?”
Thank you all for your comments and kudos! I've only got two chapters left to write, and they're already outlined, so hopefully I'll be able to stick to this two chapters per week posted till it's done!
"I'm just saying, that sounds like an odd place for random bruises Harry. I think there's probably a perfectly good explanation for this and it's likely none of your business." Hermione snapped in exasperation.
Harry’s face flushed and his mouth opened but no sound came out.
Narcissa pursed her lips “No. I have seen a provision for having at least one child, or to continue having children until they have a boy, but this agreement seems peculiar to me.”
Harry started morosely at the letters, trying to figure out how to respond to Ginny. He wasn't shocked that she'd moved his things out of the house, they'd been fighting non-stop since Albus was born. A part of him wondered if this just gave her the excuse she'd been looking for to leave. Harry folded up Ginny’s letter and out it in his pocket. There was nothing he could say to her that wouldn't make her angrier, and there was really no point in responding. He had his orders, he was stuck in the safehouse until they knew who in the Auror Corp was helping Astoria. He couldn’t leave now, even if he was willing to quit, not knowing they didn’t have another Auror to come and protect Draco.
Harry looked at Draco for a moment, considering the offer before smiling tightly, “It wouldn’t be too weird. I can stay in here.” Harry briefly considered transfiguring the bed into two twins before deciding he was too tired to attempt it and instead got into bed and putting a hand on Draco’s arm, slowly rubbing his hand up and down in an attempt to lure Draco to sleep. It must have worked, because quickly after lying down Harry heard a faint snore come from Draco’s side, and he smiled and quickly fell asleep himself.
"I told him about Auror Muldoon. He asked a couple of details then went back. What's there to talk about really?"
“I don’t know?” She looked up at Draco, her normally confident and carefree exterior completely shattered, “If I don’t marry a pureblood, my family’s pureblood line dies.”
Harry groaned, his patience thin, “I’m sorry Malfoy. Just know that they’re still working on it.”
Draco stared at the letter while he drank his morning tea. He considered responding, but nothing had changed. At some point, they would let Harry know what happened and when they did he would decide if he needed to reply. Instead, he folded the letter and put it aside to open the next piece of mail he’d received that morning.
Draco pulled his head out of the fire and starting dusting off his clothes. Looking down, he realized it might be time to clean up a bit. Draco pulled off his clothes and lay them on the bed, he then took out his wand and de-wrinkled his outfit, then cast a quick cleaning charm on them. Finally, Draco walked into the bathroom to take a shower, clean his teeth, and try and organize his thoughts.
“Mr. Weasley. There is no question that Auror Potter is facing severe damage from regularly ingesting a currently unknown potion for a long period of time. The only question here is if Mr. Malfoy is willing to give us permission to put him in a medical coma and have the best chance of healing him or not.” The healer said angrily.
Moments passed by, and Draco didn’t realize he’d closed his eyes until he felt Harry take his hand and squeeze it. “Draco,” Harry said, “Draco I’m so sorry I ever hurt you. You were the best thing in my life as well, and I will kick myself every day for ever throwing that away. I love you”
Harry smiled lightly, “Right, thanks Malfoy.”
“Currently they scheduled it seven weeks from the original date. So. About eight weeks from now.” Harry said apologetically.
3 weeks was a long time to be away from home. Draco had been away arguing at an international hearing on the statute of secrecy for the Ministry, and was excited to finally be back in England. Between the time difference and the long hours working on his case, Draco had only been able to speak with Harry twice and he was itching to have him back in his arms; it was even better that he’d told Harry he wasn’t coming home until the weekend so he would get to see the surprise on his face. Though they’d moved in together nine months into their relationship, between their heavy work schedules Draco and Harry would often be forced to spend time apart. Draco had accepted their separations as a fact of life, but there was really nothing like the sense of contentment that Draco felt when he and Harry were both home together.
“I’ll be fine. I think I could use some time alone.” Draco reached around and put a hand on Pansy’s shoulder, squeezing slightly. “Thank you for finding this apartment. It appears to be the perfect place to wallow and move on.”
Quick as he could, Draco began tugging Harry’s shirt up over his head and flung it back over his head. He began kissing down Harry’s chest, his hands caressing the firm muscles. Slowly, Draco slid his way off of Harry’s lap onto the carpet beneath. He looked up at Harry, biting his lip and resting his fingers on the waistline of Harry’s trousers.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment, his breath hitching. He looked at Draco, pupils dilated, his hair rumpled, kneeling down in front of him. He let out a breath, “Yes.”
“What was I supposed to think when you spend three weeks away and only call me twice? What am I supposed to think when it’s only two months later and you’re engaged to someone else?” Harry asked. His voice dropped glumly “I’d never even heard you mention her name before Draco. Were you seeing her when were still together? Do you love her?” Harry tried to catch Draco’s eyes, but they were firmly looking towards the ground, “I didn’t even know you liked women Draco, I thought you were gay.”
“I wasn’t sure I was either. I needed some time to process everything”. Draco finally started to walk forward till he sat down in the chair next to Hermione.
“It has been a bit lonely. I've considered replacing an entire wall with a window cause I'm so tired of being inside this house." Draco replied, beginning to nibble his way down Harry's neck.
Draco immediately moved his queen forward, “checkmate.” His smile was huge, his whole face bright with laughter.
Your Goddaughter has finally made her appearance into the world. Rose Weasley arrived at 7lb 3 oz at 4:32 am. Hermione wanted me to tell you that she knows you have the day off and expects to see you before visiting hours are over.
“Staying with Daphne, Astoria’s sister. I wanted him to stay with Pansy, but Tori insisted that Daphne wanted to spend the weekend with him. I didn’t want to tip Tori off that something was wrong so I agreed, but I didn’t realize how hard it would be being away from him while his mother is getting arrested.”
“He has logs of transactions, as well as a vault number he’s been transferring money into for the past six months. He’s willing to write out a statement to be verified under Veritaserum, and provide memories for the pensive.”
Draco breathed a sigh of relief that his clue had possibly led them somewhere, before his eyes shuttered close as his thoughts began to overwhelm him. He wanted to be relieved, excited, but this was just another missing person to add to the list. Now not only were they looking for Scorpius, and Astoria, and the mole in the Aurors office, but now they were also looking for Theo. Draco exhaled slowly before opening his eyes, “Lisa Turpin, she was a Ravenclaw in our year, and Ernie McMillian, a puff. They were all family friends back when they were children, I’ve seen them together since we left Hogwarts too. I don’t know that Ernie would help Theo if he knew what was going on, but he might if he didn’t know the reason for it.”
Draco took a step back, “I do not love you!” He hissed. “And you don't love me either. This thing between us, it's sex. It's fun, it's convenient. Call it stress relief, or exercise, or something to pass the boredom, but it's certainly not love!”
Harry looked thoughtfully at Blaise for a moment before nodding. “Right. Thanks for that.” Harry said before taking off after Draco with a sprint.
Draco didn't reply, but his lips definitely twerked up. Turning back to Scorpius, Draco called out, “Scorpius, look who's here!”
Harry took a deep sip of wine and leaned back into his chair, “It has been great. I'm glad the boys are finally feeling better.”
Harry’s jaw clenched, and his eyes narrowed. He looked up, not even trying to hide the thunderous look on his face, “I’m fine here. Thanks.” He said angrily.
Claire shot Harry a quizzical look but Harry minutely shook his head, he could explain any questions she might have after their job was done. Harry hadn’t seen Draco much since the war had ended; they had exchanged pleasantries in the lift on the occasion that their paths had crossed but neither had sought the other out. Harry knew that Draco had gotten married, and he knew that Draco and his wife had a young son near Albus’ age. Though Harry wasn’t looking forward to spending an evening babysitting Draco in a safehouse, he was confident that they could be civil with each other for one night.
Ron let out an exasperated sigh, “Alright. I promise. Tell Gin I said hi. And promise you’ll give her a chance to explain. She’s having a rough time of it too, okay?”
“Crystal clear sir. I’ll just head into my office now and get to work on providing those memories” Draco started to turn to leave the office when Head Barrister Krone’s voice cut in, softer this time.
Harry tried to avoid grimacing as he murmured his thanks, and the two wandered over to take a seat.
“I will send it over first thing Monday morning.” Narcissa stopped for a moment and looked and Draco intently, “Please remember my dragon, you do not have to marry her. People pull out of negotiations all the time, you do not even need to have a reason. If this is not what you want to do just say the words and I promise we will put a stop to these proceedings. All your father and I want is for you to be happy.”
“Trust me Draco, no one wishes this baby was here more than I do, but until she comes there’s no reason for me to be at home worrying instead of at work being productive” Hermione rubbed her stomach absentmindedly “So does having you home mean that we have one more for dinner tonight, or are you and Harry taking a night together?”
“I need to be recused from this case” Draco was in Head Barrister Krones office, standing upright with his hands clasped behind his back, forcing his posture to stay steady and upright.
Ginny summoned a bottle of wine and some glasses and the two overfilled their drinks. “To our family!” Ginny saluted, raising her glass to Harry’s.
Harry grabbed Draco's shoulder and focused all his magic on the anti-apparation wards he had earlier placed. The second he felt the wards begin to crack he pulled Draco and himself past, hurling them from the safehouse and into the darkness.
Harry raised his eyebrows amused, “Inside? Like I’m supposed to break it with a hammer like the muggle magicians do?”
Hey everyone, thanks for sticking around this far on this! If you've noticed this chapter and the last are written a bit differently, it's because my computer broke and I lost everything and had to rewrite all of what I'd had. So, I have the next two chapters re-written, but I think my writing style has changed a bit just based on the amount of time between writing the previous chapters and these new ones plus doing these on my phone instead of on a computer (unfortunately I live in an area that I haven't been able to get the computer repaired for the last 7+ months due to a combination of a family emergency that had us traveling long-term and then as soon as we came home we faced lockdown due to Covid. So thank you everyone for your patience in how long it took me to start updating these again, and hopefully you still enjoy it!
Harry stood up, squaring his shoulders as he faced Draco, “Why are you so afraid to admit it?! You talk with me, help me raise my kids, trust me to help care for your kid, ask me about work, tell me stories from your childhood, play chess with me. We've seen each other at our most vulnerable, and cheered for the other one at their high points. You get jealous at the thought I could consider getting back with my ex-wife, which is ridiculous because she tried to touch me and all I could think was how much I prefer your touch! This is what love looks like, Draco, and you're just afraid to admit it because if you do you might be tempted to stay!”
"I. Uh. It was brilliant." Harry said, his voice clouded with wonder.
"Oh." Harry responded lamely. "I. Uh." Harry sat on a desk, lost for words. "I didn't mean for that to happen."
“It’s Nott Potter! Nott must be the one helping her.”  Draco said frantically, grasping Harry’s hand and drawing him closer to the chart. “Look at this, it’s the only information that makes sense. These dates, the ones where I know she was with her lover, he was one of the only pureblood male within twelve years of our age that I can never account for. He has business or homes in each of the countries she’s been tracked to. He’s always has a soft spot for her, they grew up together. He’s the only one who makes sense.”
“That day that he broke up with me, I kissed him. I was so angry, and hurt, and I grabbed him and kissed him and immediately he just fell into my arms like none of the past ten minutes had happened. I thought, afterwards, that maybe he had still loved me at least a little. Was it because of the potion?”
Draco was looking forward to a pleasant lie in on Saturday morning, but instead he was met with an enthusiastic Hermione Granger-Weasley walking into his bedroom at seven in the morning and shaking him awake.
Harry looked at Draco confused “What are you talking about?”
Harry snorted, “Right, well, the door’s right there. Obviously I'm not worth sticking around for.”
Draco looked at Hermione for a moment before speaking, “So why did he take it?”
The two sat there kissing for few minutes before a gentle coughing broke them apart.
Draco thought for a moment before standing “Well, if she’s free this Saturday then I don’t care how unsuitable she is I’d like to take her out. Who is she anyways?”
“I appreciate you arguing my case for me.” Draco smiled at her.
“Here,” Harry said quickly, “I’ll help you. I don’t… I don’t think you’re supposed to drink that much when you’re tired.”
Harry had a few hours before the raid was set to begin, so he quickly floo’d home so he could explain his absence to Ginny and gives the boys a kiss goodnight.
Draco rolled his eyes, "I'm in a fideloused safe house hidden inside of a cliff. How much safer can I get?"
"Draco, how about you show Potter just how welcome he is here." Blaise said firmly to Draco.
“Draco, look who I ran into earlier? What a coincidence right? I invited them to join us, you know I never get to see Daphne enough anymore now that she’s living in Hogsmead.” Pansy’s smile was just a bit too bright, and her tone overly enthusiastic enough to make Draco narrow his eyes. He was positive that Pansy hadn’t spoken to Daphne since her wedding seven years before, and he was rather suspicious that she magically appeared at lunch with them less than two weeks after Draco and Astoria had been announced to be negotiating a betrothal.
Draco moaned as he felt the wet heat of Harry’s mouth surrounding his cock, pulling at Harry’s hair to make him take more of Draco. Harry hummed lightly as he put his hands on Draco’s hips, pulling Draco closer into his mouth until he was swallowing him down his throat.
“Anytime. Brunch on Sunday? I’ll invite the whole crew”
“Sounds lovely.” Draco squeezed her shoulder one last time and turned to walk into the bathroom to get ready.
>.> So like, no one's going to murder me for this chapter, right?
"That's ridiculous," Draco almost moaned out, "I don't want Potter."
"More than your children?" Ron was near shouting now, his eyes bright with fury.
Harry rolled his eyes, "yeah, I'm sure there's not a single thing you two could have discussed this whole week."
“Incendio” Draco pointed his wand at a howler and watched the red paper burn, the sound of a voice screaming at him for hurting the beloved Harry Potter melting away. He opened his wards again and another fell out and began screaming, before Draco lit that one on fire too.
Harry knocked on Draco’s door, holding a box of chocolates and looking more nervous than Draco had ever seen him.
Astoria laughed, “It was probably the biggest wave I’ve ever made of a first date before.”
“You came.” Ron looked a little surprised.
“Draco!” Harry exclaimed “you’re home!” Harry quickly scrambled off the bed and clutched the blanket to cover him. Jacob looked up fearfully and apparated out of the room, not even bothering to stop for his clothes.
Harry caught up with Draco as he stood looking wildly around what used to be Daphne’s grand home. Harry quickly cast an augmenti, and set about dosing the remaining flames as Draco searched through the wreckage, hope and fear waring through him with each step he took. When Draco was far enough away, Harry cast a quick
“So you just want to stop being together?” Harry asked angrily.
Draco snorted, “Speak for yourself there Potter. Just because I married a woman doesn’t mean I have any interest in them. Though let’s be honest, I don’t think that you would have reacted the way you did last night if you weren’t at least a little bent too. And as for who we are, we’ve both grown up, I’m not the same teenage death eater that you knew, and you’re not nearly as annoying of a git as you were. And the only reason I’m still married is because my wife ran off, I have every intention of filing for divorce as soon as I’m not holed up in a safe house with you waiting daily to find out if my child is still alive, and your wife sent you divorce papers. Your job is the only possible reason this could be a bad idea, and I’ll tell you what, if you’re that morally opposed to doing something unethical with your job, I promise that as soon as we’re done being imprisoned here you can tell them you can’t protect me anymore. Problems solved.”
Draco laughed lightly, “Oh me too.” He looked up at Harry softly, “So once you’re there on the outside, are you going to be working the investigation?”
Draco surged forward, unbuckling Harry’s jeans and pulling them down. He started mouthing at the head of Harry’s cock, licking the very tip. Harry’s legs clenched, and he reached down to thread a hand through Draco’s hair. Draco opened his mouth wider, wrapping his lips around Harry’s shaft and slowly working his way down.
Ron sighed, “She’s been released from the hospital. She’s on bedrest at home though. She’s been good about not letting anyone know she’s been injured, and we’re pretty sure nobody doubts the story that you two are in France still.”
Draco was quiet for a moment before saying softly, "I wish I could go back and change that for you. But I can't. All I can do is promise I’ll back off and leave you alone."
“Because I love him! I would have still married him if he were a muggle”.
Draco sneered, “No, you were only willing to tell the newspapers about me when you were telling them how I ruined your life and vastly abused my position with the ministry. You made me a pariah all over again, because you couldn’t be honest and let the world know about me.”
“That’s not exactly word for word, but you seem pretty amazing to me.” Draco smiled down at her indulgently.
“You look pretty nice yourself,” Draco smiled.
Harry snorted, "Yes, yes. So much has changed in the last month and a half. At least you only have a few days left."
Hope y'all enjoyed that fluff back there. Buckle up for the hot mess express that this fic is about to become.
Harry was completely confident in his plan up until the moment he put his bag down on the other side of Malfoy's table.
Ron turned around in anger, grabbing his bag roughly off the ground and storming to the door. As he turned the handle he glared back at Harry, "I thought you were better than this." He said coldly before slamming the door.
They tried everything; swaddling, letting her be uncovered and able to move, white noise, silencing charms around her room, rocking her to sleep, singing to her, bouncing her, bouncing the bassinet, pacifiers, and even enchanting the ceiling above the bassinet. Harry was just about to begin looking into using sage to get rid of possible demon possessions when Hermione came through the floo on Friday after work.
Harry followed her, trying to give her a kiss before she turned her head, presenting her check to his lips instead, “I’m sorry Gin. We can talk about it tomorrow but tonight I have to go. I love you, I love the boys, and I’ll see you in the morning.”
Monday evening Draco received an owl from Hermione.
“You sent my parents a betrothal contract?” Draco asked.
“That's assuming she doesn't drive Ron and Hermione bonkers before that and they return her at midnight.” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
Draco raised his eyebrows “We’re going out to celebrate? Just the two of us?”
Draco’s head rose up quickly like a snake striking its prey, “Of course I want him back!” He exclaimed, fire burning fiercely in his eyes, “I want him back more than anything in the world. I’ll never stop trying to find him…. It’s just… What happens if some the Aurors think it’s better that a Death Eater not be the one who raises him?” Draco stopped, his voice catching, “What if they think he’s better off without me?”
Ginny came out of the bathroom and turned to him, her expression blank “I’ll go get the boys and bring them to Grimmauld. I’ll bring dinner by tonight and we can talk and figure stuff out once the boys are in bed, yeah?” She said evenly.
Draco had just finished his first sip of tea when Harry slinked in nervously “I’m sorry Draco. I hadn’t realized what happened.”
"Oh." Harry said, "The Hogs Head then?
Draco bit his lip while he looked at Harry, before slowly nodding yes.
Draco chuckled throatily, “It’s been a long time since the last time a man said that to me, Potter.”
As court adjourned, Draco turned and exited through the side door which lead to the court holding cells, hoping to avoid the throng of press that he knew would be looking for a statement. As Draco turned a corner he was grabbed and pulled into a dark room, a wand shoved up against his chin and his back was pushed up against a wall.
“You could have asked.” Draco responded bitterly. “You could have asked instead of attributing feelings to me that I didn’t feel. Again.”
Draco nodded stiffly before turning to Harry, who was busy spelling the anti-apparation wards back on across the safehouse “Potter.” He said curtly, “Thank you.”
Lily was a fussy baby, there was no doubt about it. She seemed to not believe in sleep, and would wake up every half hour crying. Harry and Ginny would trade off on halves of the night so each got at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep each night. Molly continued to watch the boys each day so Harry and Ginny could try to get naps in.
Draco continued to glare, “They’re my cousins too Harry. I could easily take Teddy over to see them.”
Draco knew when he went to bed that he was going to have a problem when he woke up. He expected to wake up to his mother fluttering through his room in a frantic storm, or maybe Pansy sitting on his bed waiting to yell at him. Part of him expected a fire call from Hermione, telling him his services as Godfather would no longer be required the following Sunday. What Draco did not expect was to be shoved awake by Harry.
Finally, the fear that Harry had refused to think about came crashing down. Last night, after they'd fought, Draco had left without his wand to get some air- and he'd not yet come back.
"Thanks." Draco looked at Harry for a moment, "It doesn't mean you're gay you know. If you're worried about that."
Harry let out a dry laugh, before raising the glass in a mock salute, "no arguing with you. Cheers then" and he tipped the amber liquid down his throat. After Harry finished his drink, he looked up at Draco sadly. "Ginny filed for divorce."
Harry smiled shyly up at him, “You knew that a long time ago though.”
“Well, I guess if you’re still here in a week then I’ll be back.” Harry said with a sad smile.
“You. Should. See. Your. Face.” She wheezed. “I’m sorry, I just had to let him in. It was so sweet.” She continued to laugh before looking up at Draco again, “He left a note.” She fished it out from behind her desk and handed it to Draco.
Harry threw his head back, his veins on fire with arousal, “Fuck… Yeah, I can see where he might not feel comfortable with you doing this.”
“He’s still my godson. Since I’m not working during the time period I really think it would make more sense for me to take care of him.”
Draco looked over at Harry, “I can write you?” he questioned.
Half an hour later and Harry had calmed from extreme anger to melancholy before he heard the bedroom door slowly open. Draco tentatively walked into the living room, sitting delicately next to Harry's feet. He waited until Harry uncovered his eyes and looked at him before shooting a tentative smile.
Draco smiled grimly, “Small favors I suppose. It’ll be weird being here without you.”
Hermione put her hand on Draco’s shoulder and slowly pulled him into a hug. Gently, she said “I don’t think it matters what you say to him Draco, but I think he needs to hear from you. He’s scared, and he’s hurt, and he’s sad. Please just come talk to him.”
Three ales later the game was over and Draco was still no closer to going to see Harry. Instead, Draco paid his tab and headed outside, walking off into the distance until he was sure no one would see him and apparating to Malfoy Manor.
Harry closed the gap, his arm going behind Draco’s back and pulling them together. They kissed in a way that Harry was quickly becoming addicted to. He felt Draco conform to him, his arms going up around Harry’s neck pulling their faces together. Draco’s tongue invaded Harry’s mouth, and he felt his body tense in arousal.
Draco found a little pub and made his way inside, ordering some fish and chips and an ale before looking around glumly. The pub was dark, with loud muggle televisions playing muggle sports. Sometimes Harry used to watch those, trying to explain the games to Draco while Draco made sarcastic comments about how much better the game would be on brooms. He sighed, knowing at some point he needed to go see Harry and tell him things were over. It was just so unfair, he thought, he shouldn’t have to tell Harry it was over after Harry had broken up with him.
“Draco! They finally got Jacob to confess. They know which potion was being used on Harry and they figured out what it was doing to him.” Hermione pulled Draco’s covers away even as he tried to cling to them, his head burrowing into his pillow.
Harry walked over to the couch, sitting down hard upon it. His brain kept processing the word 'pregnant' over and over again, like it would suddenly have a new meaning.
Harry’s head shot up, his eyes immediately seeking Draco’s, “What?” he asked, quickly.
Harry scowled, "I suppose you heard then?"
"I've been so scared, Harry. I thought I'd never see you again. I wondered, even, if you had died and Ron just wasn't willing to tell me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Was it that you’ve been in love with Draco Malfoy since we were 11 and that’s why you can’t stop following him around?” Ron asked grumpily as he reached for breakfast.
Draco headed off to the shops, getting the things he needed for his new place and then came home to arrange his flat. By Saturday afternoon he was feeling collected enough to fire call his parents and inform them of his new living situation, expertly brushing off their questions and promising to come by the following Friday for dinner. When brunch on Sunday arrived Draco was able to talk about the breakup without his voice breaking. By Monday, Draco’s calm and collected mask was finally firmly in place, and he was ready to plow on with his new life.
The Auror looked at Draco with pity “We don’t know. We’re sorry, but we don’t know. We have our top potions master working on it right now, and a whole crew of Aurors trying to break the suspects. As soon as we know more we’ll let you know.”
Though Harry intended to try to visit Draco more, that Monday Albus developed a small fever. Though the fever was not high enough to need a healer, it did necessitate extra ice lollies and attention. Lily was still much too young to risk getting sick, so Harry isolated himself and the boys together while Ginny cared primarily for Lily. By the time that Albus had healed James had a slight fever, and they had to continue in their isolation.
Ron rolled his eyes, “Yeah, yeah. Don’t aggravate the ferret. I hear you.”
“I’m sorry.” He blurted out, “My marriage breaking up isn’t your fault, and I shouldn’t have gotten upset. I know I instigated what just happened.”
As Harry’s hand reached the hem of Draco’s shirt, Draco tried to flip around on top of Harry but over-reached his leg, rolling over Harry and pulling them both down off the couch onto the rug beneath. Draco’s head hit the floor and they both stopped for a moment, startled. After a few seconds, Harry reached his hand over to Draco and said dizzily, “Oof. I wasn’t expecting that. Are you… Are you alright?”
Draco closed his eyes and took a drink of his beer. “I’ll do that. Thank you, Ron, you’ve been surprisingly insightful.”
“I can stay on the original case until he testifies to the judge as per the plea agreement. After that, I’d like to request to take two weeks leave while the investigation continues.” Draco swallowed “I think it would be best for me to be out of the office during this case.” Draco closed his eyes thoughtfully, “I am having a lot of trouble reconciling my previous partner with the accusations in this case.”
Harry nodded, walking into the kitchen and pulling out a frozen meal from the freezer. Quickly, he spelled it ready and served it up into two plates, levitating them over to the dinner table.
“If you had asked me three months ago I would have said we could work them out Harry, but at this point… At this point my parents are in the middle of negotiating my betrothal contract and I’ve got a new life and I don’t think I could go back to you and pretend that none of this happened. Pretend that you didn’t leave me for a fellow Auror who you felt you could show off to the press”.
“He was arrested for smuggling frozen Ashwinder eggs, a negligible offense really. Barely even illegal” Kathryn took another sip of her tea before continuing and waved her hand as if waving aside the charges, “Unfortunately, he has other charges on his records. This could count as a parole violation and land him in Azkaban for years”
“You asked for me? Why?” Harry’s eyes narrowed as he watched Draco’s mind race.
“Harry. I'm sorry. I get it now. Your job is important to you, but so are we. I really think that after this, after seeing you could put us first...I think I made a mistake.” Ginny said softly, grabbing Harry's hand in hers.
Draco stood up, stretching his arms up over his head and leaning, exposing a small piece of flesh on his left side where his shirt rose above his trousers, “right then, I’m just going to go back to the bedroom for a while. Engage in some stress relief. Do be sure to call me once dinner’s ready.”
Draco grimaced, “That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about… Was that genuine or was that just for the press?”
“Did you like your present?” Draco finally asked, looking up at Harry.
Draco shook his head fiercely, “There’s no other way. And besides, this’ll be good. I’ll get to start over. Just me and Scorp. We can be whoever we want to be.”
The next couple of chapters are a bit fluffy (don't worry, the angst'll be back to hit you like a brick before you know it) so I added some smut to this one! It's at the end and if you don't want to read smut, you can pretty easily just skip to the very end of the chapter once things start heating up!
The next afternoon Draco canceled his healer’s appointment and instead floo called his mother, dreading the conversation that he knew he had to have. “Mother,” Draco called, “I need to speak with you quickly.”
The two worked the rest of class in relative silence, Harry continuing to make furtive glances at Draco's arm and Draco pretending not to notice. Draco's mood continued to darken through class, and when their potion was finally done he pulled his sleeves down and started throwing things in his bag. "Well, this was certainly a fun experience Potter. Maybe we should try working together again in another 7 or 8 years." Draco growled.
“I did think about it Harry!” Draco raised his voice angrily and began to pace “I planned on asking you whenever you got around to deciding you were ready to come out about us to everyone. I was waiting, I was ready. YOU WEREN’T.” Draco breathed slowly for a moment before continuing “If you don’t believe me check your fucking watch. Perform a lumos while pointing your wand at the second hand of the watch, tell me what happens”
Harry dropped his wand, his voice shaking “Why Draco. Why couldn’t you just let me be happy?”
"Hello?" He yelled tentatively as he walked through the empty living room.
Harry gave him a weird look, “I image it gets worse the farther you get from Scotland.” He said finally when he realized Draco wasn’t going to continue his thought.
Lucius stared to stand “If that is your wish than we are happy to help you achieve it son. Now, let us head in to dinner and your mother can tell you all about the new villa she wants to purchase in Millan.”
“It’s not. I can assure you, I wouldn’t trade my sister for the world. I’m sure our children will feel the same.”
2 years later- 3/8/2006
“Barrister Malfoy, a word please” Barrister Kathryn Combes, a court appointed public aide barrister, stepped into Draco’s office. She was short and thin, with long strawberry hair and a sing-song voice. Her feminine and sweet demeanor made many underestimate her, but Draco knew she was a force to be reckoned with in court.
Ron immediately broke into a grin and ran and embraced Harry, his arms coming around him like a giant bear.
“You expected us to find you a bride in three days Draco?” Lucius asked with a laugh “Were you hoping to be married by the weekend?”
Draco laughed, “Like teenage you would have ever met a muggle.”
“I must admit, I expected them to go with a much less traditional contract than they went with. The contract looks to be almost the same one that your father and I used back when we got betrothed almost thirty-five years ago. They are very insistent though that you go in for fertility testing before proceeding with the negotiations. They even asked that we do not use our family healer, and instead ask that you make an appointment with a specialist at St. Mungo’s.”
Harry hummed in a sort of agreement, his head falling heavier on Draco’s lap, his eyes closed.
Ginny bit her lip, deep in thought. “Should we have dinner first?” She asked.
“Not married no, but I need a date for the Gala on Saturday and I’m at a loss at who to ask”
Thinking she was referring to Draco being there, Harry rolled his eyes. “Grimmauld is my home now. The kids are perfectly safe there, Malfoy won't even be there that much longer.”
“Draco! I went to your office when you didn’t show up at lunch but the secretary said you’d been called away. I hope you didn’t mind, but I thought I would come and meet you here.” Astoria looked nervous, like she wasn’t sure if she was allowed to come by.
"Yes, Potter. I'd tell you. Now I'm fine, I'm going to get back to my shower and then I'm going back to my room. Have a nice night."
“Astoria. I’m so sorry I forgot about lunch. There was an emergency with Harry and I needed to fill out some forms.” Draco said hurriedly. He looked around and Hermione had looked up from her books and was glaring at them, while Ron was eying Astoria suspiciously. “Can I buy you lunch from the Cafeteria? I would like for us to talk.” Draco pleaded.
"Lost Potter?" Malfoy asked.
They landed with a thud on the cold forest ground, the force of their landing pulling them apart. Harry jumped up quickly, pointing his wand at a disoriented Draco before Draco could even process their landing.
“I need your help Pans. I’ve returned home and suddenly find myself in need of a new place to live. At least two bedrooms, with an office, preferably on the top-floor of a high-rise with no neighbors beside me. Open floor plan, and at least enough space for a 6-person dinner table. There’ll be a bonus if there’s a dining nook in the kitchen as well. I’d like to move in tonight.” Draco quickly started rattling off his list.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Fine.” He said nastily, “If that’s the way you want it, that’s the way you’ll have it. But, I happen to think I could use some stress relief, so if you’re not going to provide that I’m going to go to the bedroom and have a wank.” He stood up and walked towards the hallway, before turning looking back at Harry who was steadfastly refusing to look Draco in the eyes, “If you change your mind, feel free to join me.” He said before walking off into the bedroom.
Potter. My son is missing. I don't want a bath. I want Scorpius."
"I’m sorry, but yeah, that’s probably for the best. And I know we can't change what happened. Honestly, I can’t even bring myself to regret it." Harry growled out, "I just. I think at this point I'm still going to get a divorce. Does that make me a right arse?"
Draco glared over at Harry, “Your first day out of the hospital and you come to visit my mother?”
“Fuck.” Draco panted, enthralled with the sight of Harry’s mouth pressed up against Draco’s curls. “Fuck Harry, I’m so close”.
Draco nodded, before turning away back to his book. Harry took that as his signal to leave, and slipped out the door with Ron right at his heels. He got to the front door, and looked over at Ron.
Draco got up from the table flanked by Theo and Blaise and headed up the doors to leave for Hogsmeade. Harry quickly stood and raced after Draco, catching them if the courtyard, "What time are we meeting up for that drink today?" He asked breathlessly.
Ron stood up, his voice noticeably louder, "So leave! Quit the job Man! This is your family!"
“Don’t be silly Draco, I was just speaking with Harry about Andy and mine’s upcoming trip. Take a seat and I’ll go and get the house elves to make us some tea.”
"Depends what you want from him." Blaise said with a shrug.
Draco took a deep breath and nodded, before turning to Harry cautiously, “I’ll try to get some sleep…. It’s just…” He started, “I don’t really feel like being alone right now.” Draco hesitated, “and there’s only one room, so it really only makes sense for you to sleep in here too… As long as it’s not too weird for you.”
The relief on Draco’s face was palpable, and Harry wrestled with guilt that he may be giving Draco false hope. Harry wrote a quick letter to Ron, detailing Draco’s theory and asking for any information that might help to assure Draco they were working to get him reunited with his son.
“I’m sure your healers will be very happy to know that.” Hermione said, her voice dripping with disapproval.
The next morning Draco awoke in a funk. He was angry at his conversation with Harry the previous day, knowing that he should turn Harry in for his completely unprofessional behavior. More than angry through, Draco was hurt that Harry thought he would abuse his position so much just to see Harry’s lover imprisoned.
"Satisfied?" Ron asked Harry as soon as they'd left the classroom.
Draco let out a soft laugh, and the sound lifting Harry's heart considerably. "It was very quiet. How're the boys?"
“The problem is, we’re not sure exactly what was in the potion. We’ve got samples, but the suspects aren’t cooperating and it appears they were working on some dangerous things.”
Harry frowned, “Sorry. That’s how the informant relocation program works though.”
Unfortunately for Harry, there was little to distract him from his thoughts; which he noticed were more and more focused on Draco. He thought about the conversations they had had; the stilted conversations at the beginning of their confinement and the open, emotional ones of more recently. Harry thought about the affection he saw in Draco’s eyes when Draco talked about his son. He thought about the way Draco bit his lip while he was focusing in chess, or how he would blow his hair out from his eyes while reading instead of moving his hands up and pushing the hair out of his face. Most disturbingly of all, Harry found himself thinking of the way that Draco’s lips had felt against his own.
Draco again rolled his eyes and poured himself a large glass of scotch before walking over and sitting next to Harry on the couch. This was the first time Draco had drank since their first morning in the safehouse, and Harry was holding his breath worried about how it would go. He was relieved to see that Draco was slowly sipping his drink, instead of binging like he had the last time. Harry caught himself staring at Draco’s throat as he swallowed a sip of scotch and quickly turned away, blinking hard.
Harry’s expression quickly changed to one of pity, “Malfoy…. That’s not…. No. I promise you, I won’t stop looking until we have Scorpius back. I… You… You’re not a Death Eater.”
