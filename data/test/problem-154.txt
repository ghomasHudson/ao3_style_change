It was a miracle. A miracle Draco thought would never happen. Ever. He almost didn't believe it when he felt his fingers clasp around the golden ball, and it took a moment before he could gather himself and before he could hold the snitch up, with a huge shout of, "yes!"
The lesson was a light one. Meaning, by Draco's standards, not much happened, and he could relax and not have to worry about potentially getting killed. And while Bowtruckles could surely be dangerous if you threatened their tree, Draco figured just standing there would grant him safety. This helped, because he found himself paying such little attention that anything much bigger than the bowtruckles would kill him easily.
"I told him to fuck off because he tried to 'talk sense' into me, and I wasn't having it. If you're asking about that because I lost us house points, then tough shit sweetheart. Prepare to lose more from him."
What had he done? Damned his father to god knows how long in Azkaban - most likely the rest of his life given the evidence against him. And Draco knew it was the right thing, when looking at  the big picture, but that was still his dad. With a sudden jolt in his stomach, Draco turned and left the Hall.  In his hurry he didn't see Hermione pushing Harry, trying to get him to go after him, and he was out of earshot before Pansy stood up on her bench, and yelled.
In the next Potions class that Draco had with the Gryffindors, Draco 'accidentally' found himself in the last remaining empty seat, which happened to be next to Neville Longbottom. They were revisiting how to make a potion that Draco was particularly practiced in making, while Neville... not so much. If Draco remembered correctly, the last time they had tried this, Neville's potion was amongst the worst, with disastrous results with lasting effects.
Draco plastered on a wide, hopefully patronising grin, and turned on the bench to look up at his Head of House.
Before long, they were called out onto the pitch, met by the usual unfair boos by 3/4 of the school. But Draco kept his expression calm and collected, determination still raging, but inner conflict invisible. He took to the air with his eyes anywhere but the surrounding crowds. Of course, their eyes were on him, even if Draco wishes they wouldn't be. He guessed he was easy to spot however. Maybe blue ahir was not the best choice.
On top of this, he'd been hearing constant complaints from his Quidditch team, who were still salty that he'd ditched the team. But the fact of his victory kept them at bay from hexing him - he was still getting congratulations for that one. So perhaps it shouldn't have been a surprise of the relief he got when he realised he had to wait until the end of the week before his next course of action. By then, he wasn't being bombarded every minute, and it at least meant he was able to walk across the Hogwarts Grounds in peace, save for only a few glances from Pansy. Draco couldn't comprehend why she looked so sad, for Pansy rarely got sad, but neither said a word to one another. He had to admit it was sort of weird though. Both walking to the same place, yet several yards apart, and refusing to be caught looking at one another. Pansy was many things that Draco had disagreed with silently over the years, but she hadn't known that; she'd had no way to know that. But despite it all, she had always been his best friend. Crabbe and Goyle had rather been goonies than actual friends, considering they didn't really say much and were positively horrific at holding a civilised, and interesting conversation. But Pansy could do that, same as she could also prat around, and it was with her that Draco had had some of the best times of his life. It was with her he'd spent countless late nights just talking, curling up together on the sofa at 3am, and just venting anything and everything they needed to to one another. Draco was certain he knew most, if not all of Pansy Parkinson's secrets, and she definitely knew most of his. It was in neither of their best interests to expose the other however, so Draco could be sure that even if they never spoke to one another again, she wouldn't tattle.
And that seemed to be something of a trigger, though Draco couldn't pretend to be sure for what exactly. But Pansy suddenly burst into silent tears. She didn't sob, or sniffle, but tears streamed down her face, and when she spoke, her voice was breathless.
But Draco blurted out before Harry even had a chance to finish his sentence, "I kissed you because I like you. Because I've liked you for years to the point of bordering insanity. Because all I've ever wanted was to be able to call you my friend, and to do that I knew I needed to change."
He came across nobody on his way back to the Slytherin common room, as dinner had not long since finished, most would already be back. Draco couldn't even bring himself to be disappointed that he'd missed dinner, because I'm truth he didn't really feel all that hungry. Or maybe it was just the fear that if he ate, the stench he'd endured for the last few hours really would make him puke. Either way, Draco wasn't upset, and was still smiling to himself when he entered the common room.
As it turned out, Pansy's methods were not as traumatic as he had expected. The whole of the Slytherin table immediately fell silent, and without a quarter of the noise, many of the other tables quieted too, so there were still large amounts of people talking but it was quiet enough that those who had shut up were bigger in numbers, and had their attention trained solely on Draco. Draco, meanwhile, was looking up at the staff table, where he saw his father looking stone faced, and still, sat next to Snape, but also Ron's father who looked a mix between excited and impatient. Draco didn't have to guess too much to understand why he was here, but why they were
Granger nodded, "Draco. Far as I'm concerned, it's forgotten. I won't hold it against you, if you're really trying to change."
"Well, for one, that not all Malfoys are walking stereotypes, and that some might actually want to change and mean it," Hermione nodded to him with a wider smile, so he turned his attention pointedly at Ron, "While some, like my Father for example, are worse than you could imagine, and just so happen to keep a stash of dark objects under the library in Malfoy manor. A stash that if someone - let's say, a Ministry worker - found, would get him into a lot of trouble."
Hagrid looked down, raising his bushy eyebrows in an expression that looked something between relief, confusion, and the realisation that it was something he still had to deal with.
"Fuck you!" Draco finally roared, anger radiating from his body in waves at the fact that he'd been ignored in comparison with Snape's pathetic arguments.
"You're such a git Malfoy. Why are you doing this? What do you hope to get out of this bloody charade you're playing?"
"-do you really think it wise to leave behind the protection you have simply by having the name Malfoy-"
He fell asleep to the far away sound of his housemates' celebrations, and thoughts of appreciation for nothing more than his flying abilities.
"Well, I thought maybe... only, I took this out," he held up the book - she hadn't noticed it before, "and I saw that you're the only other person to have taken it out. You must like it."
Harry couldn't help but laugh at that one, but went redder when he remembered Draco was still there.
The wind nipped harshly at his exposed skin, and the rising moonlight cast silver patterns across the grass as it moved. In the distance, even just the sight of the pitch black lake, it's murky abyss almost waiting for someone to freeze to death in its depths, was enough to make Draco shiver. But none of it could win against the warmth he felt anyway. Deep somewhere inside his chest. It felt like perhaps he was going to vomit, but it was still a pleasant feeling, and one that was hard to explain. He remained with a smile on his face, and although his fingers were painfully numb by the time he reached the castle, he thought maybe this was one of the best days he'd had. And it would be even better once he got a shower.
She bit her lip, and looked quite sheepish, and still had that sad, sad look about her. And Draco decided that he didn't like it when she was sad.
It was strange how much it suited the boy, not that anybody would admit that. This was going to be one of those topics that nobody in his own house spoke about, and the Gryffindors would probably keep quiet too. As for Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, they would likely just not care, and that was fine by Draco. In fact, he reckoned the sooner the stares stopped, the better. Of course it would take a while, but it would hopefully be worth the wait. He felt like Pansy Parkinson would spare him the spreading of gossip about it, if only to save her own skin. He didn't fancy himself likely to see much of her anymore.
Thankfully, he didnt have to worry about information on basiliks now. In fact, the book he was reading wasn't informational at all. It was mere fiction; a good choice for what he had hoped to be a relaxing evening. That, of course, was not what he got.
“I came to… well. I know it won't exactly mean much, and I completely understand if it means absolutely nothing to you but… I came to apologise.”
Through his thinking, Draco almost managed to miss the perfect opportunity that presented itself to him, in the form of Granger leaving the Great Hall without Potter and Weasley flanking her. Draco waited anxiously for a few moments, before grabbing his thinks and following her, though being sure to make his pace leisurely so as not to make it obvious that that was what he was doing. He had to admit she walked fast though. Once out of the Hall he had to speed up considerably to catch up. Amazingly, the Gryffindor didn't hear him coming, until his footfells fell in time with hers beside her. She almost tripped in shock.
Maybe he hadn't thrown up, and that was good, but Draco thought hyperventilating still wasn't exactly what he would have opted for but apparently he didn't have that choice.
And of course, he'd only had to go and make things worse. Through petty bullying and show-off tendencies. But to also go as far as straight-up discrimination. Calling Granger a Mudblood - that was when he'd truly earned the Malfoy name... but lost any chance at redemption at the same time.
A murmur of agreements ran through the small group, and Draco forced a small smile, though it was weak.
Draco nodded again, "Yeah, I guess. We don't really talk to each other, but- and they do it in our common room too."
"Even if she had been... unpleasant," he chose his words carefully, and Draco wished he wouldn't, "I know she's trying. That you both are. Change can be hard, especially if it's sudden."
They worked right up until dinner, and Neville didn't seem as eager to rush off as Draco had imagined.
The two laughed for a moment before silence fell, and the Gryffindor seemed to realise again who she was talking to. Her smile faded, though didn't completely disappear, and Draco was thankful for that.
"And she'd been isolated so long she barely understood any modern advances." she nodded enthusiastically, "Yeah, I liked that - funny. However, my favourite bit was probably the part with that huge rock fall."
Draco felt his cheeks warm up, but barely paused, telling the other boy his plan. It was quite simple really, and he trusted Neville to not tell anybody - they were comfortably at that point now.
None of this, of course, was said aloud. In fact, Draco pretended he hadn't heard them at all. Why cause more trouble? Besides, ha had enough of thag coming his way tonight when he went to see his godfather, who would surely have a lot to say. Draco hadn't even bothered to plan an excuse. What was the point? Snape would find a way to debunk it all. He wasn't actually sure which bothered him more. The fact that Snape seemed to be the only Professor bothered, or the fact that some of the Professors seemed to even appreciate his sudden change of demeanour literally overnight. But it wasn't anything particularly unexpected. He'd known from the beginning that this was going to be tough. Now it was just being proven.
here was the apparent mystery. But right now, that was not his main issue, and the longer he stayed hovering by the entrance of the Great Hall, the more people were turning to look at him, and it wasn't the most pleasant feeling, having most of the eyes in the room trained on you, so with another forced breath, Draco put his plan into action.
"You wouldn't happen to have a copy of the Quibbler on you would you?" he held out a few coins to her, and she smiled just a little wider, pulling a copy from a thick pile she had stuffed in her bag.
Draco had to bite his tongue to keep from saying that he hadn't done anything in Merlin's name. That would only get him in more trouble. It was even harder to not simply day 'I dyed it', since Draco had thought it to be obvious. It took a lot of willpower not the blurt that one out.
He'd heard a few whispers. Why had a Malfoy dyed his hair? Why blue? Was that intentional? Well thought out? Or just a random colour choice? Was he rebellion, and how serious of a rebellion was it? He'd heard a couple of seventh years on his way of the great hall after lunch. They were Ravenclaws, and he couldn't help but dislike them as soon as be heard them questioning each other in hushed voices on why the colour wasn't coming out when exposed to certain counter-charms. Draco seethed quietly to himself that they had no right to subject him to any magic without his consent, and the fact that they had tried to do as much proved that it had been a smart choice to use muggle hair dye. It had been easy to obtain, fairly easy to do, and saved him from the hassle of dealing with stupid Ravenclaw students, who apparently thought it was perfectly okay to mess with his personal choices, even if it meant violating him magically.
Ron's face softened again, and he almost sighed, giving a small smile that Draco almost thought was a trick his eyes were playing on him.
Could he call him that? He had called him Draco but... he wasn't sure if it was a two way sort of thing at this point? He had just very randomly kissed him.
Something about the way Neville said it made Draco think he was missing out on something. And suddenly, Draco was even more nervous.
Draco made a point of being anywhere but the obvious places when he heard news that his father had arrived to Hogwarts the next day. He had sent an owl to his mother than morning, and gotten a rather swift reply, reassuring him that she would be out of the manor when the ministry officials arrived to search the premisis. After that it was just a case of waiting. But he didn't want to see his father. No doubt he would have some lecture prepared, and right now, it wouldn't matter in Lucius Malfoy's head if he had to wait until after dinner, because he was in the dark with everything regarding Draco's plans. He just had to make it until then. After that, it would be fine because whatever he had to say right now would be replaced in the light of what he would do. Besides, if all went well, Lucius wouldn't have much time after that before the ministry came for him. And Narcissa had already told Draco that she would happily expose what she knew should the ministry ask her about the dark artifacts they would no doubt find soon enough. Draco had smiled at that; he couldn't help it. He would stand by his mother.
And just at that moment, the Gryffindor trio came round the corner, jabbering away about something or other. Or at least, Ron and Hermione were, Harry was strangely quiet.
"I already sent a letter to my dad." he interrupted sharply, clearly thinking Draco was trying to back away.
Didn't they say the first step to recovery was accepting that you have a problem? Well, couldn't the same be said for change? He accepted he'd done wrong - and lots of it. Could he now try to change?
"Yes. I love it." She paused for a moment, chewing on her lip before regarding him with a careful gaze, "What did you think of it?"
"For a lot of things actually. Calling you a- a- a you-know-what. For berating your love for knowledge; it's obviously not a bad thing. Just for being a tosser basically. But I'm also sorry for coming up and randomly starting a conversation as though those things didn't need to be addressed. Common interest in a book is an interesting thing to talk about - but not so randomly to a person who would want nothing to do with me, and I wouldn't blame them."
"Yeah, of course. It'd be my pleasure. Any times specifically? I can do pretty much any time, any day that isn't class or after curfew."
Draco snapped his book shut, and stood, making Pansy jump. Turning to face her, grey eyes glaring, Draco couldn't help the anger burning bright and deep in his chest. How in Merlin's name had he managed to keep his sanity, spending so much time around her?
It might have been the laughter that brought over the trio, with a furious looking Ron Weasley in the lead.
Granger shot him a confused look, but her eyes still blazed with shock so he knew the apology was still needed. Though he had known that before the look she gave him.
"Speaking as your friend," Pansy began, "You just need to get over yourself and go do it. Because if you don't, you'll chicken out, and miss your chance. And wouldn't that be a disaster?"
A first year coloured in the cheeks as he shyly added, "I didn't get bothered even once by the purebloods in my dorm after you did that."
To Draco, it looked very much like some creature droppings, but like Hagrid, he couldn’t begin to guess what had left them. It certainly hadn’t been left by anything they had studied in class, so Draco figured he was already not much use here. But still, it seemed a perfect opportunity had once again presented itself to him, and at this point, who was he to deny it?
Draco nodded absentmindedly, "Alright. Then how about right after classes, we meet in the library? That'll give us more time than if we did it after dinner, and-"
His gaze flickered between two spots continuously. Or rather, two people. The first of course being Pansy, who looked about as miserable as he did, staring into space or watching her bowtruckle with a sort of empty fascination, as though she might have found them extremely interesting had it not been for the metaphorical grey cloud that seemed to stretch and hang above the two of them. Maybe if it rained, things wouldn't look so bleak, but Draco wasn't really in the mood to summon actual temporary storm clouds. He didn't need any more attention on him, and not from Pansy. He didn't want to make anything any worse.
"It was strange actually. She grabbed me as I was heading back to my common room, looking really quite jumpy. Told me where you were really quietly, and just mentioned that you were probably really bored."
Taking a deep breath, and steeling himself for the stares he was going to get, Draco ruffled his hair, shook himself a little, then reluctantly approached the great hall.
And it was settled. The two got on with their potion, Draco guiding Neville, and keeping a watchful eye as he made the potion. Draco did barely anything to actually make the potion, leaving Neville to simply follow his vocal instructions. The result was a potion not quite to Draco's usual perfect standards, but it was not explosive or corrosive, and was actually just a little beyond satisfactory - though Snape would never admit that to him. Neville was so overwhelmed with relief, and pride, he didn't say a thing when Draco walked out with him at the end of class, and walked beside him until they reached the steps up to the rest of the castle.
"Well, I payed for the books, or rather my parents did, and they're quite happy to let me scribble all over them so long as I can prove that it helps in my learning. As for the tips, Potions is just a forte of mine," he reddened slightly, not wanting to seen like he was showing off, "That, and Snape is my Godfather. When I was younger, if I ever had to stay with him for any reason, I'd always bug him to show me how to make Potions, or let me read his books."
"Only I keep catching you staring at me, or staying behind after I've spoken to one of your friends. I'm not going to bite, or attack once their backs are turns. I had my fair share of time as a ferret."
Once he was the last student in the area, he made a point of clearing his throat quite loudly, though shuffling from one foot to the other awkwardly. Hagrid turned slowly, looking confused, but the expression quickly melted to shock when he saw who it was standing there. Maybe he suspected Potter.
Pansy slipped suddenly into a sly smirk; the kind that radiated mischievousness, and Draco was struck by a sudden flash of fear.
Draco frowned. “It really wasn’t you?” He asked, running a hand through his hair, looking suddenly awkward. “I thought you’d sent it to be polite, hoping I would just ignore it, or even just to be a dick, or maybe you were hoping— I didn’t know what to think… It never once occurred to me that
But she rolled her eyes and whatever it was he thought he’d seen in her face dissipated. “He’s apprentice to a Sports Healer, that was his
He turned, and his heart dropped. There, on the other side of the beach, Harry saw his mother— along with Mrs. Weasley and Harry’s godmother Mary MacDonald— greeting two new arrivals, a young man and an older woman, both blonde and pale and delicately beautiful, like white roses in the heavy sun. His eyes were immediately glued to the figure of the young man, who flashed a quick smile at Harry’s mother, reaching out to take her hand in greeting. Harry would recognize that smile, that elegant bearing, that head of white-blonde hair anywhere.
“And then?” She prompted. She’d pulled the brush out of the little bottle again and was doing a second coat. Her hands were shaking slightly.
And with that she turned to enter the Great Hall, and Draco turned, smile on face, to go back over to sit beside Pansy on the staircase outside.
"-and your father's too. Even something as simple as dyeing your hair could be mistaken for a full blown rebellion on your part-"
"That's not true. You started changing without the expectancy that anybody would care. You changed for you, and when people began to catch on, it just made you more confident to try harder. But you did those first few steps completely alone. That's definitely worth a chance."
"Well, yeah," Harry scuffed the toes of his shoes against the floor, "I figured if I was going to be a pawn in your plans, I might as well have fun with it."
Without the distraction of the crowds enticing him, Draco's attention remained completely on the game. To the point where he wasn't even paying attention to the score, which allowed for a pleasant surprise when he realised that Slytherin were in the lead. Of course, this was usually the point where Potter would catch the snitch and win the match anyway. Thay is, until, for the first time he could remember, Draco spotted the glint of gold before Potter, rather than becoming aware of it's appearance by the dash of scarlet. He checked where the Gryffindor was, almost unable to believe his luck when he saw he was too far away to really be paying attention, before shooting off.
I'm so sorry that it's so short but I'm uh, drunk and I have other stuff I need to write. I hope you enjoy it anyway though. My plan in spent now, so if you guys have any ideas on how you want this to carry on, I'm open to ideas. Otherwise it may just be something random to finish it up you know? So let me know of anything you may want. As always, I hope you enjoyed!
Snape was quiet for a moment, his dark eyes trained pointedly at Draco, who stood strong, his grey eyes blazing with anger, glaring back at him.
"Ah-" he raised an eyebrow, "Supporting fellow students on one side. And on the other side, don't knock it til you try it. You'll find it doesn't deserve the whack it gets from people. And it's interesting."
He had to keep his intense gaze on Ron for a long moment before the boy realised what he was hinting at, and he visibly calmed, his mouth falling open in shock, his ears remaining red, but this time in what seemed like embarrassment. He tried to stutter something out that sounded like an apology, or an understanding, or something but eventually had to give up. He paled, and stammered a quiet 'got to go' before hurrying off. Hermione snickered, and hurried after him, but Harry lingered for a moment. He was looking right at Draco, a confused expression on his face as though he still couldn't understand why Draco was doing this. The Slytherin blushed under the attention, but held Potter's stare until the boy realised what he was doing, shook his head, and hurried off after the other two.
But when the game rolled round, Flint kept his insults to himself. Because Draco was radiating with burning determination, that seemed to rival the whole of Slytherin's team put together. They left him to his own devices, which before the game was simply sitting in a corner, doing last minute checks of his broom, and pushing bright hair out of his face.
Draco shut him up with a hand that curled up over his jaw, his thumb pressed firmly over Harry’s lips. They stood there in the water as Harry’s eyes widened and he watched Draco, waiting for him to say something, to explain the interruption, but Draco couldn’t find the words for why exactly he’d panicked, why he needed Harry to stop talking for just a moment.
“Is it alive?” Draco asked, tentatively reaching out to touch it and then jumping back when it swung.
There was no response from Draco, who pushed her hair back and cast a spell on the old phonograph, producing the crackly tune they’d been using to practice.
Thankfully, when Draco finally stopped, the wave of nausea stopped, and he didn't have to worry about throwing up all up in the corridor. But it was in this moment that he realised that while the shock of his father being taken away had been a sudden crashing feeling weighing on him, he couldn't bring himself to regret it. Did that make him a bad person? After everything he'd done to try and be a better person, and change who everybody thought he was, was it now ruined because he wasn't feeling guilty for condemning his father? Shouldn't he have felt bad? Shouldn't good people feel guilty for another's unfortunate fate, even if they maybe deserved said fate? He wasn't sure, but the fact of the matter just happened to be that he couldn't change it. That was it, and everything was over now. He had no other specific people he wanted to change the opinions of in regards to him, and he had seen the end to his ideas, without getting slapped, but now he had no idea what he was supposed to do.
Slowly, the two calmed, and their conservation became more like those that usually occurred at 3am, and as tears dried, smiles widened and before long the two were laughing and giggling, and joking around as before. It was 4am before either thought sleep would be a good idea, and Draco made a point of hugging Pansy tightly before they headed towards their respective dorms.
A forced huff of breath left Draco's lips as he closed his book. This was now the third time he had finished it. For the mot part, this was because he had really enjoyed the book, and not reading it again to find foreshadowing hidden by ignorance seemed like a crime. But there was also a small part of him that knew it was because he was scared of what he'd planned to do when he'd finished it.
He thinks he sees Bill (Ron and Ginny’s oldest brother and the White House Head of Security) dancing with a French supermodel.
“I know,” Harry sighed, plopping down next to her on the bed to rake his hands through his hair, “I didn’t invite him.”
“Of course it is,” Harry says, rolling his eyes but grinning widely. He reaches over Ron to pull Hermione into a side hug, “Well done, Hermione. You’ll make an amazing civil rights lawyer.”
“Without causing an international incident, not to mention a presidential dressing down from Aunt Lily? Uh, nope.” Ginny responds blithely.
Harry pictures the photograph in his mind, zoomed out: the guests looking on in horror, the Prince of England and the First Son of the United States tangled up like brawling teenagers and sprawled out in a puddle of shattered glass and spilled champagne.
Harry stood, propped up against the tree, for a good several minutes after Draco had left. He eventually looked up and caught sight of the small, sunny window overlooking the beach, and his heart sank.
“He’s just gotten out of a meeting with Lockhart,” Hermione says, briefly glancing up from her screen.
“Oh, the blond guy,” Ron says at last. He wrinkles his nose, “With the pointy face. Yeah, he’s a dick. He sorta looks like a ferret.”
“But, Ron, get this,” Harry continues, “Apparently the idea of you and me being in a romantic relationship polls really high with Gen-Z, so if the fancy strikes you…” Harry wags his eyebrows flirtatiously.
Ron makes a noise of recognition. “Oh yeah, the one that looks like Edward from Twilight!” He snorts. “Pity he hogged all the good vampire genes and left Ferret Boy with the ferret ones.”
The next day is a trans-Atlantic blur. It’s an eight-hour flight, the first half of which Harry and Ginny largely spend tossing peanuts into a snoring Ron’s open mouth while Hermione frowns disapprovingly. When Ron wakes up, (after choking on a mouthful of peanuts), he and Harry start a
“What do you think?” Harry demanded, glancing up from the Omnioculars to gesture to the figure of the man—tall, handsome, and proud-looking with sharp grey eyes and shaggy black hair.
“Why?” Ron asked, still trailing the four men through the Omnioculars. “How did she describe James, then?”
Hermione slapped him admonishingly with the diary, but Harry rolled his eyes and forced a grin, trying to quell the disappointed feeling. So what his dad wasn’t the man his mom had been head-over-heels in love with? That didn’t mean anything. His father was still here, and Harry was closer than ever to finally meeting him and finally knowing him— and finally knowing himself.
“Wait,” Harry says, recognizing the sheepish tell of an overachiever. “Oh my god, you’ve already taken it! Go on, what did you get?”
Ron wiggles his toes in Harry’s face and Harry makes a show of waving his hand in front of his nose to dispel the smell. “Second of all,” Ron continues, “
Then, as if sensing Harry’s eyes on his back, the newcomer turned, his hand falling out of Lily’s, and Harry was pierced by those sharp silver eyes that seemed to see right through him.
Malfoy just sighed. "You do think that, don't you?" Harry asked angrily. Malfoy appeared startled at his sudden change of attitude.
Malfoy sat up. "There is no one else, Pans. There can never be anyone else. Just him. Always him. But I more of a chance of spontaneously becoming straight than I do of getting him to go out with me."
He tried the window, which opened, but it was hexed to prevent humans from leaving. There was nothing of note outside, only a hill and a couple of trees in sight. At least it was brighter with the weak light of the winter sun. Draco sat on the bed, bored but alert with anticipation. Either his kidnapper did not know he had arrived, which was unlikely considering they would've felt him enter the wards, or they were making him wait. It was a common Slytherin tactic, almost expected, and it was used to drive victims to crippling boredom or even madness so that it was easier to break them.
Everyone was still shocked. "I think it's great, Harry. Ron, we should be doing the same thing with Zabini, I'm sure we'll find he's not that bad either." Neville said evenly. Harry shot him a grateful smile. Ron didn't.
"I still don't understand why I couldn't have done this in bed," Harry grumbled from his spot on the couch. He was stretched out, head tilted back on the armrest and eyes closed, looking for all the world like he was fast asleep. Unfortunately for him, the noise of the common room kept him from drifting off.
Harry ran back to get his broom and then made for the Owlery, sprinting at full speed. He enlisted a plain brown school owl to help him, giving it a blank sheet of parchment and telling it to seek Draco Malfoy, feeling hope as the bird took off. Harry mounted his broom and went after it, mentally cursing how slow owls were.
Draco turned to Potter. Potter was still at the stand, looking thoughtful. Draco approached him, but as he neared the other boy, Potter suddenly turned and headed for the door. Draco wanted to call out to him, much like how Potter had called out to him in the Forest that day. But Draco didn't. He didn't want to call attention to himself. And greeting the Savior like they were no longer enemies would surely call attention to both of them. So he simply watched as Potter walked away from him, out the door, and back to his undoubtedly busy life.
Nearly two hours later, Harry sincerely regretted his plan. His thighs ached, and his fingers were stiff with the strain of gripping the wooden handle. His eyes were tearing up from the wind, and even continuous warming charms could not prevent the chill from settling into his bones. The owl flapped on ahead, seemingly impervious to the gusts of wind that buffeted Harry about.
Magpies are one of the most intelligent species of birds, and they can even recall the faces of people and remember whether those people are safe or harmful. Magpies often mate for life.
"Huh." Harry frowned. "I never noticed that." Draco sighed in utter frustration. "You were a seeker, Harry. To be honest, most Quidditch players have those kinds of muscles. Beaters more so than others."
"Ugh! I hate how they think I'm too incompetent to realize when I'm being manipulated! It's like they think I'm still an ignorant child that can't make good choices, and Draco's the best damn decision I've ever made! And how dare they say I defended him because of this as if I would even be with him if I didn't think he was redeemable. Who are these students anyway?" Harry ranted, eyes flashing once more in righteous anger. Draco hadn't seen that look in a while.
"All the answers are in chapter 3, of course. Some are in the first section, and all the rest are in the third. Don't bother with the second section, it'll just confuse you." Draco informed him, taking out some parchment and a quill. Harry groaned. "I've been looking in the second section the whole time. Figures. Thanks, you're a lifesaver."
Seamus cleared his throat. "So I take it the rumors aren't true?" At Harry's suddenly incredulous look, he quickly leaned back, saying, "Of course, mate. Shouldn't have even asked." Then he got up and practically fled to sit next to Dean.
After he had regained the ability to walk - tricky thing, really - he made his way inside, feeling vaguely nauseous. As Draco passed through his bedroom, something felt off, as if someone had moved his furniture ever so slightly out of place. The impending sensation that he was about to vomit prevented him from investigating further, however, and he lurched into the bathroom just in time.
Harry nodded, chewing on his quill again. Draco tugged it out of his mouth, mumbling something about bad habits. Harry cleared his throat. "Yeah. When Nagini attacked Snape, he gave me some of his memories, thinking that he was going to die. He really can be so dramatic. Did he really think I wouldn't do anything? Anyways, I healed a couple of the wounds, then brought him back to Pomfrey. But then I rushed to Dumbledore's office and put the memories into his Pensieve. Among other things, there was a memory in which Dumbledore asked Snape to be the one to kill him when the time came. He was already dying and was worried about the purity of your soul." Harry told him quietly.
That night, despite trading celebrations for his bed, after telling Flint, in no uncertain terms, that that was his last game, Draco couldn't stop the grinning, his hands locked over his stomach, listening to his own heart, and soft breaths. He had not a care in the world in this brief moment.
The Slytherins alone managed to cheer over the polite cheering from the other houses. Draco was crowded by his teammates, who tugged at his robes, ruffled his hair, knocking him this way and that in their overwhelming excitement.
It was soft - too soft - and his fingers simply slipped right through. He'd been hiding behind this stupid stature for the best part of ten minutes now. He'd miss breakfast at this rate, and he needed to make his entrance now. If he just turned up to lessons, by lunch news would have spread, and it wouldn't be shocking anymore, so much as it would be everybody craning to get a look at him.
And thus a routine began. Every day after classes, the two would meet and work on Potions. Before long, the two had taken to working for a few hours at weekends as well, and as they finished looking through notes and textbooks, so they moved out into the courtyard where possible, and began working on the practical side of things, making some of the easier, or shorter Potions. Within only a matter of weeks, Neville was beginning to show impressive improvement in classes, to the point where Snape was getting confused when there were nowhere near as many negative things for him to point out about Neville's potions. Draco simply gave him discreet smiles and thumbs up in these situations, and Neville always smiled back. Always.
Harry appreciated the compliment, but at the moment, he was far too worried to even contemplate joining the Aurors, and thankfully, Wilson seemed to realize that.
Harry ignored the last bit. Draco wondered if he had selective hearing. The black-haired boy averted his eyes shyly, saying, "I thought you might just be physically attracted to me."
Their lips moved in sync, hungry and insatiable. Harry wondered, with increasing awe, why had he wasted a second not kissing Draco when it was so obviously what he had been made to do? He wound a hand into the hair at the nape of Draco's neck, the other pushing against the ground to support his weight.
When they had eaten their fill, the plates disappeared, and McGonagall dismissed them. They all stood, ready to get to their common rooms and beds for a good night's sleep. Ron and Hermione were no longer prefects - 8th years were not allowed to be prefects, head boy or girl, or part of the quidditch teams. Harry understood. Technically, they weren't supposed to be there at all, so it made sense that they should not be allowed to hold positions that they wouldn't have held if they had been able to graduate. In any case, Hermione and Ron no longer had to lead the first years to the common room, which was good since that was no longer their common room.
When Alina returned with the book, he accepted it gratefully. Then, mentally readying himself, he adopted a disappointed and slightly pained expression.
"Sure you do, darling. Blaise, will you pass the turkey?" Pansy ignored him. She was used to this sort of behavior.
“Oh yes,” Jasmine says conspiratorially. “I said we should make him a MySpace, but he won’t do it. Then I said that if he doesn’t make one we’ll have to watch the cinematic masterpiece Spice World and he said that he doesn’t have to do either of them because he’s my boss. But he’s wrong. Eventually, I will wear him down, and I will win, and Spice World will triumph.”
“Hello, then,” Draco replies, leaning on the counter and watching Harry like he’s supposed to make the next move. Harry can’t remember any conversation ever feeling more like chess.
Draco unbuttons his shirt to reveal a medically clean undershirt, and meticulously folds his discarded button-down to place on one of the shelves. Harry, watching Draco unlace his loafers, kicks his own tennis shoes off. Harry feels with deep certainty that they both know how ridiculous they look.
“That’s incredible, Luna,” Harry replies and she smiles like she already knows. She tells him about how she can’t prove causation, especially without looking more closely at outside forces, but Harry thinks she’s brilliant anyway.
“Just like,” Draco shrugs, looking through the windows instead of at Harry’s face. “You aren’t under qualified to give talks. I’m not sure if you know how good you are at that sort of thing.”
“That hag,” Harry says bitterly. “Dara won’t tell. She says that her favorite great-aunt is the baba yaga, and I think she’s being serious.”
Harry’s fingers ran affectionately over Draco’s back, almost like he didn’t realize he was doing it. “This is so fucked up.”
Draco is outside when Harry stops by, watching the sky like it might fall onto him, and he doesn’t notice Harry until he clears his throat to make himself known. Draco’s still not wearing gloves, a beanie perched on his head but barely covering his ears.
Harry watches the place he’s vacated with amusement and brings his fingertips up to his lips. When he pulls them back, they come away red.
“You’re not too broken to be wanted,” Draco said, his voice muffled against Harry’s skin. Harry almost thought he wasn’t supposed to hear it or that he was supposed to pretend that he didn’t.
“No,” Draco chances, knowing already that it does not sound believable. He is dumb. He is so dumb. He may be the dumbest idiot to ever exist.
“I want-” Harry said, words almost beyond him. He buried his head the crook of Draco’s neck, trying to even his breaths as Draco rocked against him, driving him into the velvet soft ground. He wished he could feel Draco’s skin, wanted to feel Draco’s hands on his cock but didn’t want to stop long enough to ask.
The forest darkened slowly and for a panicked moment Harry thought that the forest was about to wash them away from each other once more, but she only hummed a low song that sounded like a lullaby.
“Don’t take this the wrong way, but is there any chance you might, maybe just a little, like her?” Hermione asked pointedly, startling a laugh out of Harry.
“Draco! Shield us!” He yells, and a shield bubbles up to enclose them, muffling the disorder of the atrium so all he can hear is Draco gasping for air as they lean against each other. Harry doesn’t expect that he has more than ten seconds to cast, and he glances over at Dara and Ron to make sure they can see what he’s doing.
That was how he justified it to Hermione afterwards, when he found himself intervening in the hallway. He didn’t even recognize the Hufflepuff boy who had tossed the ball of paper at Malfoy’s back, but he didn’t even think before taking the boy firmly by the shoulder. He hadn’t said a word to Malfoy all year, not even during the sterile summer drag of the trials, but it seemed like the only option in the moment.
“It did go so well last time,” Harry replied jovially, teasing a laugh out of Parvati. “Sorry, again, truly.”
“It’s a bit much,” Harry says, resting his elbows on the table. “Enough to think she’d tamper with the potion?”
“Yes headmistress,” Harry said, everyone but Draco echoing it back. Harry turned to look at her, finding her face irritated and closed off.
“Why I am convinced by this?” Draco asks, letting Harry slide his hand over Draco’s and then moaning into his shoulder. “Merlin, alright, very strong argument.”
He almost asks what Draco’s doing, but thinks maybe that he already knows and doesn’t have the energy to stop it. Draco puts a hand on his shoulder and tugs him closer, between his legs so his waist hits the counter.
“I’m actually trying to do my job. You may have heard of it? The Aurors?” Harry asks with perhaps a little more venom than is required, mostly because he had, successfully, brought Draco back to his flat, and now they’re here, in the rain, having this horrible conversation.
Harry’s looked at him, the alarm fading out of his eyes as the forest stayed the way it was, lazy lightning bugs and soft comfort. It smelled immediately of treacle tart, so cloying that Draco almost choked on it, and Harry’s expression turned to wonder.
Looking at Draco was confusing and stupid enough without knowing exactly how his body tensed when he came and how the twisting beautiful signature of his magic felt when it pushed against Harry’s. He tried to tell himself that nothing that happened in the forest mattered but the refrain sounded hollow even in his own mind. It mattered, it mattered more than it should and Harry was panicking even as he tried to calm down, felt his heart jackhammer as every reality snuck out from between the branches and found him.
“I’m not just helping you, it’s a case,” Harry says, though he’d camped out in Head Auror Johnson’s office wheedling until he’d been assigned it, taking on two leadless robberies in the process. He’d convinced himself it was to protect Draco’s privacy, but he knew at the end of the day that other Aurors would have done that. It had just seemed like the right thing to do. “We can’t have sixty four werewolves out and about in London. You were enough.”
He peers into the window, finding Draco at the counter in a navy blue jumper, a hint of a smile resting on his face. There’s something calming in his movements and Harry likes watching him organize the desk space and push his sleeves up when they fall down.
“Fair, I’m not sure your small brain can handle so much new information at once,” Draco said kindly, patting Harry’s knee.
“Pansy says you’re sleeping better,” Blaise mentioned to Draco as they walked to class the following morning, his dark eyes curious. Blaise had an ear for gossip just as dangerous as Pansy’s, even more so because he kept things to himself until they became interesting.
“Quite,” Draco said, fussing at his robes. “Quite alright.” He had a soft rosy flush to his cheeks, and it gave Harry no lack of joy to know that that probably meant that real Draco flushed when he was embarrassed too.
It took close to thirty minutes for Harry to transform her stumbling mess of a turn into something Draco begrudgingly admitted was fairly good. In the meantime, Blaise and Hermione had blundered into them in the spirit of good natured fun, Ernie had managed to overturn a desk over by the wall, and Draco’d had to deep breathe for a solid twenty seconds after Harry had stepped on Draco’s toes.
“I’m not chickening out,” Draco says, setting his emotional support boner cushion on the floor. He is standing up. He is setting his glass down on an end table. He is crossing the carpet and he’s crouching in front of Harry and then he’s staring into Harry’s appallingly green eyes and he is going to kiss him, in front of all their horrible, horrible friends.
Harry, who stood on the opposite bank and was still learning to trust the forest, tried to make out the shapes across the pond. He couldn’t discern much but for the obvious trees, a few scattered rocks, and logs toppled over into the lake.
It’s not a real choice, safety or staying. It’s not a real choice but sometimes Harry wishes Draco had made it, just so someone would.
“At first having to dance with other people felt like I was being punished, like it was already ruined and it had to be ruined more,” Draco said with a sigh that made the window fog.
Draco has an odd little expression on his face, something between stricken and how Neville used to look any time he tried to answer a question in class. When he speaks, it’s urgent and careful in the quiet of the archives. “I don’t believe any of those things anymore. I know you’re giving me a second chance, and who knows if I deserve it, but I’m really trying to be better.”
Draco walks over in his black tailored pants and bare feet to stand near Harry on the mat, his pale eyebrows disappearing into his hair. “Are you done?”
“I should probably get these out to suppliers,” Harry says, shifting the box to his hip so he can give a little wave. “I’ll let you know if there are any updates on the case. It was great to meet you, Jasmine. See you later.”
As the brutality unfolded, he watched Draco. The handkerchief was silken violence around Draco’s neck, caught with a pin. He was watching Draco with a different face, staring at the luminous disaster he’d created, eyes limned with a cold and endless fury.
To be quite frank, I suspected you and my son shared something quite a bit more meaningful than a friendship. Draco is exceptional at concealing information from all but his mother. But, Mr. Potter, I fail to see how you are at fault for his disappearance. It seems that you and Draco made your plan together and only because of that insufferable poltergeist. It is the reporters' fault for insisting on nosing about into the lives of people who rather deserve privacy after all they've done for our world. And, if you had had the chance to consult me for advice, I would have suggested a similar approach - controlling the flow of information is the most critical thing when confronting news outlets. You could not have anticipated the outcome, so I do not blame you.
I don't know if you've heard yet, but his kidnapper was a woman by the last name of Biello. Would you happen to know anything about her that could help find Draco if he didn't escape and was sent somewhere else instead?
"Draco?" Harry said, shocked. "You were the one tearing my bag?" He quickly grew angry. He thought they had moved on from their childish feud. They had made a truce for Marlin's sake!
This time Blaise patted his hand sympathetically before offering him meaningless platitudes. "Sure, Draco, whatever you say." Draco almost opened his mouth to express his feelings for Potter once more, but Pansy shoved a croissant into his mouth. He glared. He really needed to make sure this didn't end up as a recurring theme of their mealtimes. Draco spent the rest of breakfast silently ranting about Potter in his head, because clearly, no one else would listen, and not looking at Potter. Not once. Not even that one time.
Draco shook his head. "We're finishing our animagus potions today, remember? I can't possibly skip!"
Walking home was exceedingly pleasant, which was why he insisted on doing it every day, even though Draco would rather he apparated. Harry whistled as he approached their little house, a two-story brick thing with plenty of room for the three of them.
Draco got up swiftly, and with a swish of robes, he exited the cell. It would not be said that he went to his doom without style and grace. After being prodded down a long hallway, Karchumbara pointed to a door on his right and grunted, gesturing for Draco to enter, so he did. His father was already sitting in the chair, the chains wrapped securely around him to prevent his escape. Draco made his way over to his mother, who was already sitting on a bench where they would watch the proceedings and await their turns.
Harry hesitated again. "But how...how did you...?" Ginny smiled at him softly. "How did I know I was gay?" She asked him. Harry nodded. She sighed. "It wasn't really any one thing, in particular, Harry. I've always loved looking at beautiful women. And after dating a few guys - you, Dean, Michael - I realized that boys didn't really hold the same appeal for me as girls did. And then I saw Luna after a few months and saw how beautiful she had gotten...and well the rest is history." Harry was suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to hug his beautiful, brave ex-girlfriend. She had struggled with this alone for who knows how long. He was unmeasurably grateful to have her by his side now.
"Excellent," Wilson said. "Unfortunately, the spells probably won't work if his capturer is anything more than completely incompetent."
Harry pointed in the direction of the house he had seen. "There's some kind of a building over there. I'm certain he's inside."
Draco resolved to do as his mother asked of him. He was worried for her. This would be her first year completely alone, so if there was anything he could do to make her feel better, he would do it without reservations.
"I don't mind that everyone will know," he finally responded. "I'm more worried about what your rabid fangirls will do to me."
She had to. What was life without Draco? They had been together for so little time, and already Harry was dependent upon that flawlessly perfect git. Hermione and Ron had each other, but Draco was all his. His to laugh with, his to protect.
Focus on one particular feature of your form. For your first attempt, you must pick something that the animal has in common with humans. Do not attempt to grow limbs such as wings, tails, extra arms/legs/heads, etc. You must only pick something to change. Smaller, less obtrusive changes will be easier than larger, grander ones.
"Transformation Magick for the Transfiguration Master?" Alina asked. "Whatever could you need a theory book for? You won't be able to practice magic if that's what you mean to do," she said, looking suspicious.
Pulling back just enough to speak, Harry said, "I missed you too, you know. It makes me anxious when I don't talk to you for too long."
"Then, why didn't you?" Draco asked. "I saw you were looking at me throughout the day, but you never came over. I thought you weren't speaking to me for some reason." He looked sad at the thought.
On the other hand, magpies are risk-takers. They are not afraid to tempt predators, earning respect. If you see a magpie, you are not afraid of taking a chance.
"Don't say it if it's hard right now," Harry murmured against his lips. After a moment, Draco pulled back slightly.
The door opened. The Auror that had been in charge of making sure he didn't run away came in. His name was something like Kachamba. Kachumbar? Kachamblur? He was a big man, portly, but surprisingly fast. He had his wand out and ready to cast in case Draco decided to make a break for it. "It's time," was all he said, in his oddly squeaky voice that really was not at all suited for an Auror.
The other boy pulled back, watching Harry intently. "Someday, you're going to tell me what it is with me whispering your name that makes you blush." Right on cue, all the blood rushed directly to his face, though some diverted in a more southern direction. Harry shook his head, emphatically. There was no way he would ever reveal his erotic dream to Draco, especially considering it happened before they had ever kissed. "Never," he insisted. Draco smirked. "Is that a challenge, Potter?"
Should he add that they had intended to tell her? Harry didn't want to come off as mannerless or make her think that they didn't value her opinion, because he really did. It may seem irrational to wish for the validation of the wife of Lucius and the sister of Bellatrix, but she was also the cousin of his godfather, the great-aunt of his beloved godson, and the mother of the man he loved. She was an important figure in his life merely through association, but Narcissa was interwoven throughout his most valued relationships in a way that only pureblood inbreeding could achieve. Harry needed her to be on good terms with him if only because it would affect too many people that were dear to him if they were not friendly.
Draco couldn't resist joining in. "He sure does, Pans. I think he must've tripped like usual - his face is all red, especially his lips. Oh look, they're even swollen." The both of them were laughing outright now, Blaise ignoring them and scowling.
They were silent for another moment. "Should we be concerned about that?" Harry asked him. "Oh, definitely. The whole school will know by breakfast," he informed the brunet.
He slipped between the trees and journeyed far enough into the forest that no one could immediately spot him from the edge. He stopped when he reached his favorite clearing.
Pansy came out looking like she had been awake for hours and promptly dragged them off to the Great Hall. They had sat down in their usual places. This time, to their mutual surprise, Bulstrode and Nott sat down next to them. After the initial shock and ensuing greetings, the additional Slytherins had been integrated into the conversation seamlessly. Draco felt a pang of sadness for his former friends, Crabbe and Goyle. Crabbe had- he had...and Goyle didn't want to return to Hogwarts without his ever-present counterpart. At times he missed their idiotic non-conversations and their nonverbal answers.
She rolled her eyes. "What do you want me to ask? You don't need me to analyze his words to see if he likes you back or not. Clearly, he's a good kisser if you kissed him more than once. I can't help you with asking him to be your boyfriend since you've already got that covered. You haven't even slept with him yet, so we can't discuss whether he's good in bed or not. You don't need me," she said matter-of-factly.
"Good morning," Blaise greeted him. Draco just groaned, pouring himself a glass of pumpkin juice. Blaise turned to Pansy and raised an eyebrow. She just shrugged in response.
The breathing stopped for a moment before Draco heard a whooshing sound that he took to be Harry whipping off his cloak. Draco opened his eyes, smirking in triumph, and turned to see the Gryffindor looking very sheepish and slightly miffed.
Draco looked inside the envelope and saw that there was indeed another piece of parchment. He resisted the temptation to sneak a peek at it, out of respect for his mother.
Draco looked angry now. "Leave it, Pans," he hissed at her. Then, he tugged her away into the Great Hall without so much as another word. Zabini, who had been watching all this quietly, gave Harry an apologetic look and followed his friends.
"What's wrong, Harry? Lost your touch? Is this what Gryffindor's prized Seeker has been reduced to?" Draco laughed mockingly at him and flew in circles around his head, hair streaming behind him. He looked so happy. Harry couldn't stop staring at him, not even noticing when Draco abruptly pulled his broom up, flying high into the air. He did, however, notice the little fluttering slightly above the other boy, and was horrified to notice that he hadn't even been looking for the Snitch. Draco caught it easily, whooping and coming down to gloat. Harry smiled fondly, and his discontent vanished like magic.
"Maria! I came as soon as I could. Where is the dragon?" His voice wavered uncertainly on the last word as if he were uncomfortable saying it.
Harry was still unsure. He didn't really want people obsessing over his life again or knowing so much private information about him. They already interfered far too much for his liking. He just wanted to be normal. Writing a book about his life would be certain to deny him any sort of normalcy for the rest of his life.
Draco pouted. It was adorable and just made Harry start laughing again. When he finally regained control of himself, he leaned in to kiss Draco's pout away, still smiling. Draco stubbornly kept frowning.
"Draco," Harry said, very throaty and rough. The sound shot straight to Draco's crotch, and he had to hold back a groan. Harry leaned closer again, but this time his mouth found a new target. When he felt the heat of Harry's tongue searing his neck, Draco really did moan. Encouraged by the noise, Harry continued his assault rather vigorously.
Harry searched the rest of the room thoroughly and then carried his finds to Wilson. At the last second, though, he remembered that Draco was unregistered and would undoubtedly not appreciate Harry giving him away. So, he quickly changed course and went to find McGonagall.
He glanced down in panic, only to see the material damp and dark with the metallic substance. Draco looked around frantically, but there was no one within miles he could go to for help, that list being limited to his mother, Pansy, and Blaise, and he never apparated whilst drunk. It was just asking to get splinched.
Draco was not convinced. But, he was tired, so he bade Pansy goodnight and walked off to his doom - dorm, I mean.
Draco awkwardly patted Hermione on the back, holding back a sigh of relief when she let go. "It's wonderful that you're safe," she said. "Harry was inconsolable without you. It was heartbreaking to watch."
Narcissa smiled ever so slightly. "You're very welcome, Mr. Potter, do come in. Truly, you convinced me at 'I missed Draco.' I'm sure he'll be pleased, he's been quite poor company thus far." She ushered him inside, plucking the pie from his hands. "I'll have to thank Mrs. Weasley for this," she said thoughtfully, more to herself than Harry.
But Draco knew, he just knew that he could never escape that easily. It wasn't in Harry's nature to just let him go. It was why the incident in their sixth year had occurred in the first place. And that was why, when he felt the hand grab his wrist, Draco only sighed with resignation.
He finally spotted the wild, brown hair and looked in the immediate vicinity of the girl. A few feet to the right, his gaze was caught by another pair of familiar, green eyes watching him. And Merlin, Pansy was right, Potter had gotten hot. The dorky lenses had been upgraded to still dorky, but more fashionable frames. The hair was still a mess, but it was longer, so at least it looked like it was messy on purpose. And Potter had finally filled out, the scrawny build becoming the strong, lean body that all Seekers possessed. But no Seeker could ever come close to matching Potter's looks. Draco swallowed and pushed all the feelings that had risen in him down to the depths of his soul, where no one could ever find them. But he couldn't break the staring contest he had with Potter. Because, as with everything between them, this was a competition, and Draco simply had to win.
"Yes, I think that might have been the problem," Draco admitted to her. "There is a possibility he was touching the bottle they were in for an extended period of time." Madam Pomfrey shook her head. "Foolish boy," she said, and it sounded almost fond. Draco blinked in shock. Then it was all business once more.
"Here!" he shouted, trying to get the others' attention. In the back of his mind, he heard a shrill scream and the crashes and thumps of a fight. Then, one of the other Aurors - Johnson or Smith - rushed beside him. He dimly registered pleading for them to help and their apologetic voice saying they didn't understand what he was doing enough to assist.
Harry lurched to his feet, the long table the only thing separating him from the spot from which Draco had disappeared. Hysteria clawed up his throat, threatening to render him useless in his panic. But no, he had to stay calm. He had to. For Draco.
The second thing he noticed was that his head was stuffy like he had been crying. Then he remembered that he had been crying. He almost cringed at the memory of being so helpless in front of Draco, but the warmth soothed him back into his relaxed state. He drifted for a while, content to lay there in a half-asleep state.
Harry sighed. "Nothing suspicious," he half-answered. He felt like it would be betraying Draco's trust if he told them about the Animagus attempts. "Okay?" Hermione said, confused. Harry never missed an opportunity to discuss Draco's behavior.
Harry approached the professor without fanfare, trying to stay discreet. He quietly explained his theory to her, supplying the necessary details to convince her that it made sense.
Blaise smirked. "More like who's the target. I've already got everything figured out." Draco smirked. "You know, just because Harry and I are cool now, doesn't mean we can't play a friendly joke every now and then."
"It's really quite entertaining," she went on with quiet amusement. "You see, they very much hate each other, or, at least, they insist they do."
Harry smiled as he recalled finding Draco in the Forest that day and the pleasant things that came after. But now, he had to focus on the book. Draco's nightly project, the task he had been working on nonstop for weeks into the early hours of the morning, sometimes with Harry as his sleepless companion.
Harry tried to play it off, just like Draco. It was hard being around the other boy all the time - the dorm, classes, the common room - Draco was just everywhere. Those damnably beautiful, yet piercing gray eyes, the soft, sexy blonde hair, and the ethereal angled features were everywhere he went. He wondered if it would be so bad if Draco was planning on using him, as long as Harry finally got to kiss Draco.
Harry turned to Ron, who rolled his eyes and said, "He hasn't even bullied the first years. He's changed, mate. We all have."
"It's not easy. It's never easy. But I figure they wouldn't want us to forget them. They would want us to tell their lives and stories if only so the next generation has access to quality pranks. We dishonor them more by staying silent," Harry said with complete conviction in his opinion.
Parkinson sighed. "I know, honey. But there's always a chance. Please try to sleep now. We have lessons tomorrow."
Memories....hmmm, there was an idea. Harry contemplated the possibility for a while and grew more and more pleased with it by the minute. Working on it would also serve as a distraction, so Harry got started immediately.
A few days later, it was the weekend. Draco and Blaise were sitting in Blaise's empty dorm. Pansy was, unfortunately, quite ill.
It was very possible that there had been a burglary in his flat. The first thing Draco did was check the door. Surprisingly, it was still locked and bore no sign of having been forced open. Still, that didn't rule out theft. It just increased the likelihood that the robber had magic on his side, a suspicious occurrence for a muggle neighborhood.
Harry's heart melted, just a little. After all, he would give anything for the Weasleys to accept Draco, and for him to like them in return. Harry resolved to make every effort to please Narcissa because it's what he would want from Draco.
"Erm...well," Harry hesitated. He wasn't ready for this, but when would he ever be? He didn't have any plausible excuses either...
Harry was taken aback. This was not what he had expected. "Thank you, Kingsley, but right now, I think I've had enough of dark wizards for a lifetime. Is there truly no way to enter the trial?" He asked one last time to make sure. "I'm afraid not, Harry," was his answer. Harry nodded. "Then, I must be going. I will stop by sometime to visit, though." Kingsley clapped him on the shoulder and then guided him back to the entrance hall. "I must leave you here; I have some urgent business to attend to. I wish you luck on your way out." Harry thanked him and watched him leave. But Harry himself had no plans to exit, not yet at least. An idea was forming in his head. Because when Harry Potter made up his mind, he followed through. And because half-baked plans are what Harry does best.
He and Gin had had a talk the previous summer. Harry simply didn't feel like he could be with Ginny any longer. He knew that something inside him was fundamentally not the same. Harry was not the guy he was before walking into that forest, and Ginny didn't deserve to be strung along when Harry knew he wouldn't be able to be a good boyfriend to her. Ginny deserved better than him, a boy who carried far too much baggage from the war. And Ginny, being the wonderful friend she was, understood. She had let him go, and after a while, she thanked him for it. If she hadn't broken up with him, she had told him one night, then she never would have discovered her feelings for a beautiful, blonde Ravenclaw. And now, Luna and Gin were dating and perfectly happy. And Harry was glad.
Ron looked slightly queasy. "Can we please not talk about Malfoy's prick? It's making me uncomfortable." Harry laughed and Hermione rolled her eyes. She really was the best. Harry didn't know how he would survive if he didn't have her.
"I know that is what you wish, Your Highness, but you have a responsibility to the kingdom. You cannot renounce your title as you tried a week ago. It is simply not done," the man informed him calmly, removing his dark sunglasses. His face was plain, forgettable, with absolutely no defining features. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and pale skin, but not too pale - he was utterly average in terms of appearances.
