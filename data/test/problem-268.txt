, Harry thought. Just as he had this thought, he felt the sensation trailing down all the way to his half-hard erection. Harry braced himself and, just like he expected, the invisible lips reached the head of his cock and
He chanced another glance at Draco and found him bouncing slightly on his broom, flying around agitatedly. This was going to be good.
"Yeah, I'm fine" Draco replied breathlessly. He looked at Harry then, seeing his raven hair tousled from the wind and his eyes gleaming brightly behind his glasses. He looked so earnest that it was difficult to stay angry at him for long. "Thanks Potter," Draco added as an afterthought.
Draco huffed impatiently and ran a hand through his hair. Of all the times for this to happen, it had to be now. He shifted from one foot to the other, alternating between staring at the fluttering Ministry memos above his head and checking on his potions. At least there was nobody stuck with him. That would be so awkward, especially if it was someone he knew in passing at Hogwarts. He shuddered to think how he may have been stuck with Harry Potter. He knew from the Prophet's incessant reporting that Potter was an Auror, and it really wouldn't do to be stuck in a sodding lift with the righteous, bespectacled git.
Harry Potter knew he didn't always have the best of luck. His parents died in a car accident when he was just a baby, leaving him in the care of abusive relatives until he ran away from home at the age of sixteen. To top it off, he pretty much had a non-existent love life, and a small part of him longed to meet someone keen on a serious relationship, no matter how far-fetched the idea seemed.
Draco and Pansy shared a laugh and headed inside.
"OW! What the fuck, Malfoy!?"
, Potter!" Draco glanced at the camera quickly, before looking back to Harry.
Harry gently stilled Draco's hips and turned him around. "I'm really sorry, love. I still have a lot to do before the meeting. When I get back, I promise I'll give you the fucking of your life." He kissed Draco long and hard, and when the blond moaned and rubbed against him, he knew he had to pull away.
"Alright, I'll send you a memo.
that nipple so much.
Speaking of which, the man behind him reached around to wrap his beefy arms around Draco's waist, indirectly squeezing his stomach, and Draco gave a shudder. Yes, he really needed to pee right now.
"Um, my friend told me about it. Her cookies were amazing so I asked her to give me the recipe, and she showed me your videos."
They laughed happily, glad that their best friend finally found someone to love him back. And if any of them noticed Harry's heated glances or Draco's slight limp, they were kind enough not to say anything.
"Ahh!" Draco shouted, feeling more of his blood rushing south.
Sure enough, when Draco's hand closed around the Snitch, the pressure in his bladder finally let up. Harry watched from below, fascinated, as he saw a wet patch growing from the seat of Draco's trousers. The patch slowly became bigger, staining the wood of the broom and dripping down the legs of his trousers. Draco was peeing his pants again!
"So that you can challenge him to a duel? I don't think so."
"Don't distract me, Potter. I'm trying to find the Snitch," Draco rolled his eyes, making a show of turning his broom 360 degrees to try and catch a glimpse of gold.
"That's
The only thing that was annoying him, Draco thought, was that he had no chance to go to the bathroom before the game started. Everyone was too caught up in the moment and Terry Boot had all but dragged him around to go find other people to play for their team. After so many glasses of firewhisky, wine, and whatever alcohol he could get his hands on, Draco was feeling quite full, and though the game proved to be fun, the Snitch was elusive.
"At least it's better than the Slytherin dungeons," Harry snapped back. He watched Malfoy raise a tiny eyebrow at that.
"You all right?" Harry asked.
Hermione looked at Harry strangely. Harry had to fight the blush showing up on his cheeks.
username on the screen!
Suddenly, Draco thought of a plan. He smirked to himself and quickly turned around so that his arse was pressed against Harry's crotch. "Just one more time, before you leave?" He began rubbing his arse against Harry, smirk widening when he felt Harry harden.
Harry rushed through the hallway, almost tripping on his robes. He was late to his first class of the day - Transfiguration. He cursed under his breath, remembering how Ron tried to wake him up but he was too tired from the previous day's gruelling Quidditch practice. He hadn't even had breakfast.
, he tried to reassure himself, but today seemed to be his unlucky day. The lift was just too cold, he was shivering, and he couldn't help the second trickle of pee that escaped him. Draco could feel it soaking through his underwear, and more of it trailing down his thighs.
," she smirked knowingly.
If Draco hadn't been so distracted, he would have noticed the lift changing directions. It went sideways and instead of going down to the Department of Mysteries, it went up.
Draco attends his class reunion and joins a friendly Quidditch game.
Just as he was about to round the corner to the Transfiguration classroom, he bumped into someone and his books went flying. The impact sent Harry sprawling onto the ground.
Draco makes a delivery to the Ministry of Magic.
Since then, they'd been on several dates, where Harry had thoroughly pampered Draco and made him feel so loved, he felt like the luckiest man on the planet. All those times, he had been the perfect gentleman and they'd done nothing but kiss and hold each other, but Draco saw the way Harry stared at him sometimes and wondered when Harry would finally crack.
Draco was so lost in thought, he started when the lift gave a jerk. Hastily glancing at his potions to make sure nothing toppled over, he looked back and realised the lift wasn't moving.
Needless to say, the Muggle club won.
"Doyouwannagooutwithme?"
Fuck, who knew a simple task like baking could become so
Draco raised one eyebrow but did as he was told, slipping his apron on and tying the strings together.
"Harry!!" Draco squealed, unable to help himself as he felt a ticklish sensation on his foot. Whatever Harry was doing, he was using some sort of feather to stroke his arches and in between his toes. It was unlike anything Draco experienced before. In the past, his ex-boyfriend used to tickle him lightly, and he wasn't restrained or anything, but this time round he was totally helpless. Draco tried to kick out at Harry or the feathers. Whatever it was, he needed the tickling to stop.
Draco didn't know how far they had walked. They'd taken short breaks along the way, but they must've walked quite a distance as there were less people along the beach now. To make things worse, his baby kept moving inside him, putting pressure on his bladder.
Draco turned back and rolled his eyes at Harry. "Brute."
"Will do, sir." The line cut off.
As Draco's hole clenched tightly around Harry, Harry felt the throes of pleasure overtake his senses as well and and he started releasing spurt after spurt of come inside Draco's arse.
Malfoy was about the length of his wand, with silvery dragonfly wings and a faint glow around him. He was dressed in a short tunic made entirely out of shimmering material. Harry thought he looked rather cute.
"For someone so angelic looking, you have quite the mouth on you," Harry remarked, moving his finger in and out of Draco's hole and enjoying the feel of Draco's tight heat squeezing around his finger. When the blond was moaning and begging for more, Harry added a second finger, scissoring in and out slowly.
"Ow!" Harry felt the pain shoot through his body and made to get up, at the same time the other person said "Watch where you're going, Scarhead!"
pregnant), Harry always tried his best to cater to his moods and cravings.
"Where are we going? Will you just
If possible, Harry turned even redder when he realised what happened and avoided all eye contact.
He grimaced when pulled apart his robes and saw a wet spot staining the front of his trousers. Muttering a cleaning charm, Harry went into the toilet to wash his hands and splash some water on his face. He looked at his reflection and sighed. His hair was even more of a mess than usual and his glasses were askew. Harry waited for ten more minutes to ensure the curse wouldn't start again before he went back to his meeting.
Before Draco knew it, Harry had maneuvered him so that he was lying on his back. The brunet was gazing down at him with so much love and adoration, and any retorts Draco thought of were quickly silenced.
"Well go find Parkinson to give you a massage. I don't have time for your shit," Harry made to pick his books up, only to find himself shoved to the ground again.
He dropped his phone in shock.
At this thought, Harry squeezed around his erection and moved again, so fast his wrist ached. He came with a powerful intensity, just as he imagined Draco begging for more of his cock and the delicious moans coming out of the blond as he fucked into him. Harry was so exhausted, he fell asleep right after that.
But there was still a lot of planning involved for the stakeout, and Harry was hoping that the Aurors would finally catch the elusive wizards that were cursing Muggles to lose their memories, then robbing their homes. And Harry knew if he and Draco had sex, his mind would absolutely not be in the mood for work after that.
"I'm going to get Snape!" Malfoy said angrily, and Harry started laughing because his voice was pitched higher than before. "It's not
Draco pushed open the door of the only toilet in the diner, only to find the lone cubicle occupied. There was nowhere else he could relieve himself. He had no choice but to stand outside the cubicle to wait, bouncing up and down on his heels nervously and crossing his legs together.
Draco pretended to consider this. "I want to play against you," he finally said, smirking at the taller man. "Scared, Potter?"
But today was his lucky day. He won the contest!
Draco looked away. "I... Someone asked if I was going, so I thought I would see how everyone's doing." He pouted. It was a lame excuse, and Pansy wouldn't buy it at all. Worst of all, stupid Potter was standing in a corner, laughing and talking to the other two members of the Golden Trio. He had ignored Draco the whole day. What was the point of asking Draco to go if he wasn't going to talk to him at all? Stupid Potter.
Draco's eyes blinked open and he raised an eyebrow. "For a pervert, you seem to be quite the gentleman," he laughed and leaned down to place a chaste kiss on Harry's lips. "The answer is yes, I've been single long enough to- mmmph" Draco was cut off as Harry kissed him again.
"In fact, I'm going to bring him out this Halloween. He wants to go trick-or-treating," Harry said happily. "He wants to dress up as a bear, can you believe that? So I'm thinking of dressing up as another animal so that we'd match. You can come along. It'll be fun!"
Harry would rather prefer to see Draco naked, but this was good enough. His eyes greedily took in the pale expanse of skin, admiring Draco's lithe body and seeing his muscles flex as he mixed the flour, sugar and eggs. When Draco turned to the side, Harry caught a glimpse of a pale pink nipple, and he could feel his erection push angrily against his pants. Gods, he wanted to lick and suck and
"I...um.. just have to go to the loo. I won't be long," Draco stammered. Harry looked concerned but told him to go ahead, and soon the blond was out of his seat and headed to the loo as fast as he could.
"I... Thanks, Potter," Draco ran his fingers over his first wand. "My parents moved to France; we had to sell the Manor to repay the Ministry for our part in the war."
"No way, I'm
? With his alcohol addled mind, he couldn't remember how much exactly he'd had to drink, but it was probably a lot if it meant he was out here, drunk and dancing shamelessly and grinding his arse against the man behind him.
The sexual tension between himself and Harry had been around ever since they first met. Draco wouldn't admit it to anyone, but he had wanked himself raw over the black haired man the past few weeks, sometimes with his fingers inside of him, imagining it was Harry's cock fucking into him instead.
, he thought desperately and pressed the emergency button again.
"You were in such a deep sleep when I got home, and I couldn't bear to wake you up. I thought we'd have some fun together," he replied.
, he smiled to himself.
Harry looked up in confusion, only to be met with a fairy instead of a slug.
"You never have enough time for me," Draco whined petulantly. It wasn't fair, after this meeting, Harry would be off catching Dark wizards for at least one whole week. He knew it was childish of him. The safety of the wizarding world lay in the hands of Harry and the other Aurors. Draco's job was more flexible, he was a potions maker which allowed him to brew in the comfort of his own home and take care of their son, James.
, baby," Harry groaned, lining his cock at Draco's entrance and pushing in in one hard thrust until he bottomed out. He moaned at the sensation of finally being inside, moving in and out slowly in order to give Draco time to adjust.
Harry took "all these" to mean the entirely too tight fitting clothes and the arse swaying, but he wasn't one to complain.
Draco groaned when he realised how much water he'd had to drink. He dropped the bucket of shells and held on to his stomach, trying to will the little one to stop kicking.
Draco stopped the kiss to pull Harry's glasses from his face. "They're digging into my skin," he complained and Harry laughed. The dark haired man started to pull off his T-shirt too, and soon both items had landed somewhere on the floor.
"Let's go," Harry said, although he would rather stay there and kiss Draco for a longer time. The two Seekers flew back to where their classmates were waiting for them.
"Love you too," the sated blond replied, slumping bonelessly to the floor. Harry followed, pulling out of him once they were spooned in a comfortable position on the hard floor. When he glanced down to see the come dripping out of Draco's hole, he swiftly inserted a finger inside, massaging his come inside and making sure that nothing else leaked out.
," he said in between bites as Hermione went to offer Ron some cookies. Ron too, bit into his cookie and instantly reached for 5 more. "When did you learn to bake so well?"
Harry started to imagine rubbing his cock against Draco's covered arse. He would get the blond so worked up, Draco would whine and beg for Harry to take him right there. Harry would unzip and pull down Draco's jeans roughly and, with his spit as lubricant, push into Draco's tight hole.
Since Draco was too pregnant to bend down, he offered to hold the bucket containing all the seashells while Harry stopped to shovel at the sand, hoping to uncover more treasures.
"Please...please excuse me," Harry stammered, before his boss could add any more scathing remarks. He turned to Ron, quickly telling him to cover for his presentation if he didn't return by then.
"No! It's not what you think Hermione. I just want to-" Harry thought quickly. "-return his wand! Yes, that's it. I want to return his wand!"
"Hi, how may I help you?" a woman's voice sounded through the speaker.
"I recently reached 100,000 subscribers on this channel. Thank you so much; it's a great achievement for someone new like me," Draco drawled. "As a giveaway, I will be inviting one lucky subscriber to bake with me."
- staring back at him from the screen
Draco nodded at this, and took a sip of his tea. "I was thinking of baking treacle tart for our video. What do you think?"
Draco made to rub his eyes, only to realise that his wrists and ankles were bound to the bedposts by silk ribbons. Momentarily panicked, he struggled in his bonds; even though they were just silk ribbons, there was no give. It must be held up by magic. Draco's first thought was that Harry had come home, but he listened carefully and all seemed to be quiet.
"Yeah, this super gay bloke on YouTube who bakes stuff," Ron piped in between bites. "I have a feeling you'll like him, mate," he winked.
Sorry for the wait guys, I wasn't satisfied with the initial draft for this chapter but it should be good to go now. Enjoy!
"Not yet, just give us a few more minutes, sir. Maintenance is repairing it right now and it should be ready in no time."
But to Harry, Draco was not "just another bloke". He was Harry's angel, and he would also become Harry's undoing.
Harry then launched into how he and Andromeda had been trying to make Teddy's costume. Draco listened half-heartedly. He was interested; he had never been around kids but he always wanted to have a sibling. It got too lonely in the Manor. But Draco's bladder kept reminding him of more pressing needs, and he felt it was impolite to interrupt Harry mid-conversation, especially when it was about Teddy. The man's eyes lit up whenever he mentioned his godson.
Draco laughed at that, the sound making Harry smile as well. "Don't worry about me, Harry, nobody gets past Goyle. He's the security guard and one of my best friends. Even though he's a bit slow sometimes, he does have good intuition when it comes to people."
Draco jumped and whirled around to face Potter once more. He couldn't believe his bad luck. "Potter," he nodded at the dark haired man, hoping to keep the nervousness out of his voice.
Harry saw Draco racing towards something on the ground. He quickly turned his broom around and caught sight of the Snitch flying near the trees. He cursed and flew after the blond, but his broom was an older model and was not as fast as Draco's. Nevertheless, Harry crouched lower and tried his best to maneouver the broom towards the trees.
In spite of his friends' teasing, Harry was curious. "What YouTube channel?" he asked, then quickly added "I want to try baking too, if that means I get to enjoy such delicious cookies all the time."
"Harry! You're back early," she exclaimed. "And who may this be?" She looked at Malfoy, who sneered at her.
"Draco... baby... love you" Harry panted and kissed the back of Draco's neck, inhaling his unique scent as he rode out his orgasm.
"Yes! Oh god, Harry! Harder!" Draco screamed and threw an arm over his eyes as Harry started pumping in and out harder, lavishing little bites all over his neck and collarbone. He could hear the obscene squelching sounds echoing throughout the kitchen and feel the rhythmic slap of Harry's heavy balls against his arse. Harry gave him a particularly hard bite on his neck, and Draco moaned loudly at the fact that he'd be wearing Harry's marks for the next few days.
"More, Harry.. oh gods," Draco gasped, gripping at Harry's arms, and Harry added a third finger in, moving his fingers faster in anticipation of what was about to come. "I want you, I want you so much," Draco sobbed.
"Hi, Flora," he greeted the receptionist, levitating his potions to an empty desk. Flora had been a few years below him in Slytherin. Her family was also linked with the Death Eaters and she was trying hard to restore her family name, much like Draco was.
That was
"Harry?" Draco stuck his head into Harry's study. "Aren't you going to have some lunch?"
(See the end of the chapter for
, Draco throught, trying not to salivate when Harry paused to roll his sleeves up so he'd be able to get at his food better. He could see the play of muscles beneath Harry's jumper and he had to suck in a breath.
"What?" Draco blinked up at Harry, but before the blond could process this further, Harry went with his instincts and pulled Draco onto his lap.
Harry was now at their apartment, sipping some tea with Ron while Hermione baked in the kitchen.
Draco thought in horror. He wrinkled his nose and turned to wash his own hands, making sure to hit himself with another cleaning charm where the man bumped into him for good measure.
"Speak for yourself, Malfoy." Harry bunched up and shrunk Malfoy's clothes, laughing and dragging the struggling fairy off before anyone could see them.
When he was about to switch on the TV in order to have
"You should do whatever you love, Draco." Harry answered. Feeling bold, he let the back of his other hand brush against Draco's cheek. "I'm glad you're making videos on YouTube now. Your recipes are interesting and I love watching you bake. I couldn't believe you picked me."
"That's for bumping into me!"
He tried to cross his legs together, but it was hard to do so with the man dancing against him and bumping into his arse. Draco gave a whine as he felt a bit of pee trickle out, wetting his briefs and trailing down his leg. He crouched down, holding his crotch in desperation, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.
"No thanks, I'll join Boot's team." Draco said huffily. He was still annoyed at Harry for ignoring him and only coming over when he needed him. "Aren't you playing Seeker too, Potter? It must've escaped your miniscule brain, but one team can't have two Seekers."
"Harry, what..?" Draco trailed off, unable to see anything with the blindfold.
"It's so hot," he couldn't help whining, wiping his face with a towel and holding out the bottle to Harry, who took it gratefully and drank it as well.
was going to meet his favourite YouTuber, Draco in real life and bake together with him.
"Tell me your safe word if you want to stop, love" Harry reminded him gently. Then, out of nowhere, "Rictusempra!"
"...You caught me right there," Draco laughed, and Harry leaned in to kiss him. "But really, I don't mind taking things further if you don't end up being a creep. I didn't expect you to be so hot, although your hair reminds me of a rat's nest." His hands tugged at Harry's black curls.
"What the fuck?" Draco glared up at his boyfriend.
"It's alright, Draco. You caught the Snitch and beat me for once, didn't you?" he couldn't help teasing the blond.
"What's so funny?" Draco pouted.
"Er.. nothing. I mean, Ernie said that he had seen him around the Ministry lately. I was wondering if he got a job here."
Contrary to what Harry feared, things were less awkward between them after all that happened. Draco was content to sit right next to Harry, leaning into him with his legs draped over Harry's. Harry, in turn, sifted his fingers through Draco's hair, and was delighted to discover the strands were as silky as he imagined. It was surprisingly easy for Harry to talk to Draco, and they spent the rest of the day telling each other more about themselves and discussing the video.
Harry looked up and saw Hermione holding a tray full of cookies. They smelled delicious. He thanked her and took one.
Draco seemed to have read every lewd comment on his video (some of which were from Harry himself) and responded to his fans' requests. This time round, he was wearing nothing but an apron and form fitting jeans, claiming that the weather recently had been too hot and he "didn't want to get his clothes dirty, anyway".
"Harry?" he called. There was no answer.
Harry thought in glee. At this point in time, he didn't care if McGonagall found him and took a hundred points from Gryffindor. All that mattered was Malfoy getting what he deserved.
The feathers were at Draco's feet for what felt like hours, even though it could only have been minutes. Just when Draco thought it would never stop, the feathers started to travel upwards, towards his calves, in between his knees, towards his thigh and cock. He screamed with laughter as some feathers travelled up and down the length of his erection, coaxing pre come out of the tip. Draco felt frustrated at his helplessness, but he also couldn't help feeling a bit aroused. He kept thrashing around on the bed, even as more feathers assaulted his balls and hole. He was sweating already, tears were leaking out of his eyes and he was pretty sure he was drooling too.
When they got to their hotel room, Harry didn't hesitate to show Draco how much he loved him all over again.
Harry reached for another cookie and closed his eyes in bliss as the flavour of lemons and white chocolate exploded in his mouth. Whoever this guy was, he was an angel if it meant he could bake so well. Harry nearly fell off his chair when Hermione showed him the YouTube channel.
"He doesn't seem very well-behaved," the Fat Lady remarked.
"Are you alright, love?" Harry asked him, wrapping one arm across Draco's shoulders and pulling the blond to him.
"No problem, Malfoy," Harry replied easily.
"Well, I think you need a taste of your own medicine,
" Draco screamed. Harry was hitting his prostate so hard, he could feel his vision blacking out at the edges. Soon enough, after a few more thrusts, Draco was screaming and coming against the counter, Harry's name on his lips.
Harry Potter was standing at the other side of the doors and - Draco loathed to admit - looking quite fit in his Auror robes. He gave Draco a once over and his mouth was open wide as he took in what must be a very embarrassing scene. Draco could feel a deep blush spreading across his cheeks and down his neck.
"I brought him to the Burrow," Harry said.
"I'm fine, Potter," Draco managed a weak smile. Harry didn't need to know all the details, though Draco was blushing furiously at the fact that Harry remembered what happened that fateful day. "That man was so disgusting, though. He was playing with his
There was an awkward silence that followed. Draco cleared his throat.
Malfoy tried to fly off, but Harry was faster and pulled him back by the wings.
, and Draco certainly couldn't see what was so interesting about that small, rectangular device.
More feathers started attacking him, going from his crotch to his belly and sides, although the onslaught on his cock and hole didn't stop. It was then that Harry, the traitorous monster, joined in, his fingers digging mercilessly into Draco's belly. Harry's tongue even went into his belly button, causing Draco to curse and try to slap his face away with his belly. Harry just laughed at him, tongue poking into his belly button once more, when the feathers and Harry's fingers continued tormenting the poor blond.
"Have you fixed the lift yet?" Draco ground out from between his teeth. He could feel more pee threatening to come out.
The most intense thing about Harry, Draco thought, was his eyes. It was such a bright shade of green, just like grass in the summer, and it felt like Harry was able to gaze into the depths of his soul. Draco sighed dreamily.
"Hey Flora, I'd like to borrow Malfoy for a while," Potter's eyes darted between the two of them.
"Golden Snitch." Harry spoke the password, shooting an apologetic look to the Fat Lady, who huffed angrily.
Draco whimpered, now nearly dancing from one foot to the other.
The blasted lips had actually made him
Harry blushed at that. He used to date Ron's sister Ginny at school, but they broke up amicably when Ginny had to move overseas for work and both of them weren't keen on a long distance relationship. Since then, Harry realised he preferred the company of men, but due to his lack of social life, the most he'd got was a bunch of one-night stands at the club he frequented.
"Oh, Ronald," Hermione shook her bushy head fondly, leaning in to kiss her boyfriend. "You know how Harry is. Once he's obsessed-"
Draco jerked up in surprise when he felt some pee leaking out. His eyes widened and he looked down. Sure enough, there was a small damp spot on his trousers. Draco blushed and averted his gaze.
"Er, no. I'm just curious, is all," Harry smiled sheepishly. "Can you.. can you let me know if you see him again?"
Meanwhile, Harry was most definitely not able to concentrate on his meeting. He didn't know what was happening to him.
"There...there was one over there," Draco pointed in the direction they came from, cursing himself for not going earlier. Now that he looked back, the restroom seemed like it was miles away. Apparition was out of the question too; his Healer had strongly advised against Apparating while pregnant.
Harry sighed in happiness. This weekend was all about lazing around and spending time with his best mates. After graduating from university, he got himself a well-paying job, but it came with consequences. Such as not having much of a social life outside of work. Ron and Hermione were also in this predicament, but at least they got together during their time at school. They now lived together and had each other for support. Harry sometimes felt like the third wheel in their relationship, but Ron and Hermione assured him that he would never be intruding in their couple time.
"I f..feel so dirty..." Draco sniffled, trying to bury his face in Harry's shoulder. "And so... useless... and f...fat..."
When Harry bit into the cookie, he couldn't help moaning. "Fuck, Mione, this is
Just then, Draco felt a trickle of pee coming out and soaking his underwear. He gasped and stood at the corner, not daring to move. He could already feel the blush spreading across his cheeks at the thought of wetting himself like a child.
"No, Malfoy. Did I not tell you? This hex wears off after an hour, so you should be free to go then. Same as when you were turned into a slug. I don't know why you became a fairy this time."
"I babysit him a few times each week, when Andromeda has to run errands. He's really cute and he's a Metamorphagus, you know? Just like his mother. We didn't know till recently, when his hair started changing from brown to turquoise. Andromeda and I, we were so delighted, jumping up and hugging him. I'm sure he was wondering what the fuss is about," Harry laughed.
"Draco," Flora smiled at him. "How's everything?"
Moments later, Harry flew up to join Draco.
Harry managed to type out. He re-read it a number of times, before deeming it decent enough to hit the send button.
The next time Draco met Harry, it had been at one of their impromptu Hogwarts class reunions, organised by none other than Seamus Finnegan.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other and smiled, then Hermione took her phone out to start finding that particular channel.
Harry didn't know whether to feel angry or relieved.
"Sure, why not? He usually comes over on weekends. You can meet him too, if you like," Harry replied.
"Alright, if you promise not to fly off," Harry shrugged. He let go of Malfoy and watched as he slowly spread his iridescent wings, bobbing up and down in the air. He had to admit it was mesmerising. Harry had never seen a fairy up close before, and he loathed to admit that Malfoy made a very pretty fairy. The golden glow around him accentuated his white-blond hair, making him look almost ethereal.
Draco shook his head, shuffling along in the sand and holding onto Harry for support, trying to focus on the sand in between his toes and Harry's presence beside him, anything except the fact that his baby kept kicking him and he
Draco glanced up in horror as the lift doors opened to reveal none other than his schoolyard rival.
A younger Harry would've laughed in Malfoy's face, but Harry liked to think he had matured and put the past behind him. That and Malfoy wetting himself was kind of hot. When the blond walked out of the lift, Harry realised he had missed the cleaning charm on the back of his trousers, but Malfoy was too fast and Harry was sure he wouldn't appreciate a spell hitting him from the back.
"Okay, baby?" Harry asked. He had stopped and was pouring the lube over his fingers again. Draco leaned up on his elbows and stared unabashedly at Harry coating his huge erection with more lube.
in hell he would admit to wanking over Draco.
Harry found it disturbing his best mates knew his taste in men so well.
"Jamie! How have you been? Have you missed Daddy?" Harry carried his son and ruffled his messy black hair.
Draco took a deep breath, and waved his wand to cast a silencing spell. He felt so dirty doing this, but just as he was having second thoughts about relieving himself on the floor, his pee gushed out of its own accord. Draco blushed as he saw the dampening of his trousers and pee trailing down his legs and into his shoes. The white tiles were also not spared, and there was a huge puddle of pee on the floor. The splashing sound of pee hitting the floor was liberating.
Draco woke up from his nap, feeling sated. It was rare to have this kind of opportunity to get a lie-in, what with having an energetic 3 year old around him at all times. It didn't help that his husband, Harry, had been off catching Dark wizards for the past week. Draco had finally gotten a well-deserved afternoon nap after feeding his son and tucking him into bed.
"Gonna make you come so hard, love" he growled. He undid the bonds on Draco's ankles, held his thighs up and slid into the blond easily. Draco's addled mind thought it was magical, how Harry seemed to have a knack of finding his prostate easily. He moaned as Harry began pounding into him hard. Within a matter of seconds, Draco gave one last scream and came, pearly white streaks of come landing on his belly, some drops of come even going so far as to land in his hair. The sight of Draco coming undone caused Harry to come too, shouting Draco's name and emptying load after load of come inside Draco's tight hole.
The feather at his hole went deeper and deeper, and it must be his fucking husband that made it breach his hole slightly. Draco shrieked. He did want something in his hole, but the feather tickled so badly! He wanted to claw his insides out but he couldn't even move his limbs except to strain uselessly against his bonds.
Harry took a moment to admire his husband's flushed cheeks and lips, but they were interrupted by a loud yell from the living room, then a crash which seemed like a plate falling to the floor. "Papa!!" Harry and Draco could hear James shouting.
"Come on," Harry said, cutting off Draco's thoughts and attempting to unbutton the blond's shirt and trousers. Draco complied, helping him with the buttons, and soon it joined the pile of clothes on the floor.
"Draco, everything okay?" he asked. "You didn't have another accident, did you?"
Silver eyes widened as Draco opened the box and took out his hawthorn wand. "You kept it all this time?"
"Malfoy? Are you there?" Harry said mockingly, turning over layers of clothes to look for that infuriating bastard-turned-slug. "Malfoy?"
As the mystery lips lavished light kisses on his nipples, Harry was very sure he felt the wetness of a tongue darting out to lick at the sensitive nubs. He groaned internally. Merlin knew his nipples were
“Alright,” Draco said, unable to hold back his knowing smile. Now this
"Oh?" Harry said, raising his brows. "I should go say hi then."
“Did he tell anyone?”
“He’s the one who took
“What kind of hieroglyphs are these supposed to be?”
“Nope. I mean, we could just move the due date a little further. Won’t hurt anyone.” A mischievous smile escaped Harry’s lips.
when your father was born. He was my evening star."
Harry looked at the stick figure. Its neck was almost as long as Larry's.
"No matter. Let's go."
"Good evening, ma'am. Good... good weather."
“Ron came to get you?” Harry said. “How did he get in?”
"I'm not the one pushing people away here."
“You’re the one who pinned me against a wall though”, Harry said and poked Draco on the chest, where a very faint Sectumsempra scar was still visible. Before Harry could pull his hand back, Draco had grabbed him by the wrist and in one swift motion, straddled him and pinned him down on the bed.
"Will you do it?"
Draco chuckled.
“Like they always do,” Harry said, pulled out his wand from his coat and flicked it. The words didn’t disappear. “Strange. I did have to ask Theodore to wait until tomorrow. Scamander took a while and then I had to inspect the body since they’re taking it away tomorrow afternoon.”
“Ah, but that’s old news now, isn’t it," Ron said, giving a grin. “No but seriously - I don’t want to end up an old geezer who keeps boring his grandkids to death by telling the same story over and over, about how he once did something important in a war like a hundred years ago.”
The click of the latch being pressed inside the lock interrupted Draco. The drawer opened.
“The Prophet is publishing my essay!” Hermione said and looked like she was about to burst in excitement.
"Moved on? Bha! No family, no kids... And according to the St Mungo source he had been on Calming Droughts for at least two years straight before he died."
"You have married the killer of the Dark Lord?" Her voice remained calm as she gave a small chuckle. "I didn't know they allowed such… unnatural unions in Great Britain."
Draco chuckled.
“Well, not really.”
Potter didn’t answer, but Draco could tell from his appalling, pitying smile that that wasn’t the case.
Harry smiled. It felt like a small forever had passed since they had been stuck in that elevator together at St.Mary’s. The memory made Harry think about what Draco had said about his leather jacket when he had been high on Amortentia. Harry pushed the thought away and started going through his bag, trying to find a book or a paper or something that had to do with the exam.
Harry learns a few things about sex that his teachers at Hogwarts had failed to mention. He also finds himself accommodating two unexpected visitors, and it turns out Theodore Nott isn't the only one who read the article about Harry and Draco on the Daily Prophet...
“It isn’t looking good for Scamander so far,” Harry said as they turned a corner. “He has a very good alibi, and that makes him look all the more suspicious. And who’s to say he couldn’t have killed Toadsworth on his way out and just ran back to McGonagall’s office?”
"No one really… I mean, I read about it when Umbridge found out about Dumbledore's Army and what you were doing. I sort of, just, didn't want you to know a spell I didn't. But of course I couldn't do it - none of the memories I used worked."
Hermione’s smile faded a little, and Harry knew her well enough to know that she was considering how much information to give out.
“Indeed.”
"Why not? And why are we whispering?"
"No, see - you need to stop doing that."
“Correct. As I’m sure you’re aware, the rumour that the position is cursed lives on. It’s a rather slim pick, whenever I am forced to make one. A tragedy like this will only add fuel to the fire, I’m sure.” The Headmistress rubbed the bridge of her nose and removed her reading glasses, placing them on the desk in front of her.
"Honestly, I don't know what it is with straight boys," Seamus said, wiping the corner of his eye. "They're all
Drool was dripping down on Potter’s cheek. Draco frowned and pushed him, not forcefully enough to hurt him, but surely enough to wake him up.
"Then he made it. He lived," Draco said. "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people just exist."
“The leeches are the worst part," Draco said. “And I had to touch four of them! Merlin, they make me sick.” Draco pulled out a notebook from his bag. “I swear, if it doesn’t work again I’ll dump the leech tank into the Thames so at least they’ll have to find replacements before the professor can bother me about it again.”
“Do you remember what you saw?”
It wasn’t as if Draco hadn’t changed, too. He had become nothing short of best friends with Hermione Granger over the years, and these days he was proud to say he was more than tolerant of even Ron, who often asked Draco to be his practice opponent before important tournaments. Naturally, these games were played on Ron’s chess board that had once belonged to his grandfather. Draco had told him to get himself a new one for years, but Ron didn’t want to hear it. In fact, it was Draco who had given him the idea of going into Wizard’s Chess more seriously, and it was Draco his mother sent tarts to every time Ron moved up a rank in the national - or international - listings. At his current rank, the winning rewards were enough that he had been able to quit his part-time job at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and throw himself into chess completely. Over time, he had become esteemed enough as a player that he had even given a few inspirational lectures at Hogwarts at McGonagall’s request. For this, no one was more excited than Hermione. For her, seeing Ron so committed to something that he was willing to read books with barely any pictures in them, had apparently awakened such a deep attraction to the man that she had had no choice but to have a baby with him.
“It’s pretty hot.”
“Yeah," Harry said, already drifting further into his thoughts.
“Don’t be so dramatic," Granger laughed. “We’re not kids anymore. Besides - Harry talks about you a lot. About how you’ve changed, and I don't think the way we were as teenagers should determine the rest of our lives, do you?"
," Harry said. “We’ve talked in class and spent a little time… a couple of times, outside of class too.”
“Maybe you’re allergic to something in here?”
Neville’s cheeks flushed.
"I may have."
Not much later Harry found himself sitting in Magical Injury, listening to professor Skepperus ramble on about the correct method in which bones were to be mended. Harry stared at his general direction, not really focusing his eyes on anything in specific. As much as he had tried to, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this was going to be one of his bad days. The thought provoked more fear in him than he would’ve liked. The idea of it, everything, slipping away from his grasp until Merlin knew how long, terrified him.
“What happened - why are you crying?” Draco asked, leering around the hallway as if he was looking for a culprit.
“Ah, probably around the fourth time Dean and I had made out," Seamus said. He made a smug face. “You thinking of hopping over to the dark side?”
Harry almost walked into Larry the Giraffe’s portrait before he realized he had arrived to his dorm. Perhaps shy to talk to Harry after Draco had threatened to graffiti over his portraits, the animagus remained in his animal form as Harry said the password and was let in.
Something about the way Granger looked at him made Draco feel like she now knew exactly what had happened.
“I believe a less forceful approach may be of the essence in this case. Something, how would one say…” The professor tilted her head, inspecting Draco with her piercing gaze. “Gentle. Yes?”
“You’ll have to ask Harry. He’s the Grand Investigator, not me.”
“Goodbye, Draco. Give Neville my regards, should you run into him up there.”
“Oh?” Hermione tilted her head and then nodded, encouraging Harry to continue talking.
“What?” Theodore said, staring at Draco like he had suddenly grown three spare heads.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re referring to,” Harry said with a smile.
“It shouldn’t be normal to anyone," Hermione huffed.
Out of curiosity, Harry tried checking out the “no” as well. Another text appeared, overlapping the previous one.
“He's not a- he never wanted to be part of that! Besides, people change. He's different now, he's-”
Draco smiled and turned his attention back to the sketch. “I won’t say. Don’t want you getting too cocky and starting to grin before I finish this.”
“It went fine,” Theodore repeated, looked quickly at Draco’s eyes and then down again, as if the eye contact had been simply insufferable to him. What on Earth could have made him so angry? “And you can piss off, for all I care.” And with that, he stormed out through the main entrance.
"Harry," Remus said calmly, "do you need me to talk to professor Toadsworth? I'm sure she'll let you try again."
Molly, as usual, showed a brave face and rushed to pat their backs and kiss their cheeks, somehow holding three grandchildren at once, but it wasn’t enough to hide the fact that even she was tense. All the children then ran to greet Harry and Draco (who they all called uncles, which gave Draco a mild quarter life-crisis every time), and once their interest in them had expired (this didn’t take many minutes), they ran off like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons, or whatever it was that McGonagall had once said. It was only then that Draco noticed how grim everyone looked.
Someone knocked on the door.
Draco and Harry turned to look at each other. Neither of them moved.
“Harry," Draco sighed. “That wasn’t the apology. That was me saying sorry I woke you up in the middle of the night.”
"Something like that," Draco said. "It's not as good as it sounds, believe me. If I had known better, I would have destroyed it when I had the chance."
“I mean that when it comes to things such as inheritance and connections, I’m not exactly considered a Malfoy anymore.”
Longbottom returned inside, not waiting for Draco to answer. Unable to come up with a reason to refuse, Draco followed him.
“Harry was crying because he likes me?” Draco said. Not that he didn’t understand. Draco would have cried too, had he been in Harry’s position.
They stumbled to it in the darkness, their steps muffled by the thick rug that covered the floor, and opened the doors. It was obvious they wouldn’t fit inside very well.
“What?” Harry’s shoulders tensed.
The two stared at each other for a few seconds. Weasley, as usual, looked reluctant to exist on the same plane as Draco, and Draco had a feeling he hadn't come to see him voluntarily.
(See the end of the chapter for
Despite Harry being extremely worried that his next encounter with Draco would be filled with weird tension and awkwardness, things seemed perfectly normal when Harry saw him in class the next day. Actually, he forgot all about his conversation with Dean and Seamus when Draco sat down next to him and started talking about how difficult it was to make Polyjuice Potion.
After Draco had left, Harry walked Remus back to the main building where there were fireplaces for Flooing. They were taking the long way, strolling slowly and reluctantly as there seemed to be too little time and too much to talk about. Tonks was covering evening shifts that week so Remus would have to be back home early.
“Unofficially, yes. His office got a report last Tuesday that a Russian man has been walking about Knockturn Alley, asking questions about a Wadjet.”
“Did you get an owl, too?” Was the first thing that Arthur Weasley said to them.
“Why are you being nice to me?”
On that particular morning Harry felt relieved that Ron had to retake a charms class from the first year, leaving Harry alone in Treating Magical Injury. Not that there was anything wrong with Ron, but he did have a nasty habit of complaining. All the time. Harry wondered if he had always been like that. Then again, Harry hadn't been exactly fascinated by studying in Hogwarts either. But things were different now. Harry got to study the very anatomy of dangerous magic and how to deal with it, and so far he had loved every minute of it. He wondered if Hermione had felt like that about classes at Hogwarts.
“Looks like just papers," Harry said.
“You’re joking, right?” Hermione laughed. “He was practically begging for your attention at Hogwarts. I swear not a single class went by where he didn’t try to pull some stunt to get a reaction out of you.”
“He means to ask if you’re using protection”, Dean said.
“There’s all these stereotypes about what bottoms are like and what tops are like and so on”, Dean continued, “but they’re really not true most of the time. If they were, then every top would be tall and dominant and masculine.”
“I’m not gay," Harry said, frustration building up inside him. “And don’t you bring Ginny into this. What happened between us is none of your-”
“Sorry. This place is a mess," Harry said as he picked up the pile of clothes that was covering his only chair, and threw them into the corner of the room where his trunk was.
“But that was a lie! Because you did know. And - no, listen to me - if Bellatrix, or Voldemort, or whoever had killed me right there and then, we would’ve lost. So you needed to be there.”
"I really wasn't," Harry said. "But now that you mentioned it…"
He didn't have time to say much, though, before one last student entered the classroom.
"Right! So you could call me Ron."
Draco glanced at Harry, but his expression remained unchanged.
“Well, what’s important is that you don’t have an STD”, Seamus concluded.
“Maybe the one who killed her emptied them?”
“But how- I literally
Each time, there was a moment when the energy shifted, when the playing and bantering suddenly turned urgent, wanton, non-negotiable. This time, that moment came precisely now as with a small nod, Draco told Harry to sit up, stripping his upper body rather unceremoniously, letting the clothes fall over the edge of the bed to a space that at the moment, no longer existed to either of them. More removing of clothes with fumbling hands followed, and then a spell (Draco used
"Then again, I'm grateful for the sun but I don't want to touch it."
“What about your mother?”
"Well, I'll have to be on my way," he said apologetically while waving his wand. The cardboard box that had been empty only moments ago now levitated out of his old room, full of miscallenous stuff he had left behind.
"So, I- I'll see you later," Draco said. "And good. That, that you like the book, I mean. Or love it, whatever. I mean, not whatever, but - fuck." Draco looked as surprised as Harry by his sudden stuttering. "I'm going now, okay?"
“Uh," Ron said, clearly not having expected everyone to have their eyes on him like that, “is it because it has to blend into its surroundings?”
The article was from a Russian newspaper that not so humbly called itself “The News”, implying that the events of the local wizarding society were the only news worth printing, or reading for that matter. The article itself declared that mournful events would soon cast a shadow on all of Moscow, as Adrik Malfoy, head of the esteemed family, was close to dying. Though the article referenced his adopted son numerous times, a name was never mentioned nor was he interviewed - instead, all comments were from who else but Grandmother Yana.
Harry searched his shoulder bag for a mock-up Ministry form he knew he had been handed in class at some point in the semester, and after pulling out three crumpled up receipts from Muggle coffee shops, a quill he was pretty sure wasn’t even his and a few napkins with abandoned pieces of gum folded inside, he was starting to feel so annoyed at how much useless stuff was in there, that he flipped the bag over, dumping everything onto the floor.
Harry let Draco’s words hang in the air for a moment.
"Prat."
“It’s more comfortable”, Dean said, crossing his arms. “That isn’t the point. The point is, people are always being nosey, wanting to know who’s who in a gay relationship, but it isn’t that simple.”
“Not the whole world," Harry said. “I failed to save some of the best parts of it, in fact.”
now," Toadsworth's voice said from outside the tent after everyone had left. “Good luck, Potter!”
“That was nice of her," Harry admitted.
Despite all this, Harry had found himself feeling simultaneously happy and awfully restless after every time he had spent time with Draco lately, and he couldn’t quite grasp why. Today the feeling had taken over him while he had still been
“Ah, you’re not Neville after all,” the woman said with a wide smile on her face. She was quite young, and she had a dark complexion that made her skin glow like satin. She wore her hair up, wrapped in a patterned scarf, and her robes were very colourful.
"Year... two..." Harry said as he wrote. "Right. Broken arm, a couple Bludgers to the head, Umbridge's black quill... That's about everything that matters, right?"
“Why did you kiss me?” He asked.
Draco gritted his teeth. If there was one place he didn’t want to be at Christmas, it was Hogwarts.
“Everything," he then said with a voice that didn’t sound quite like his own.
Harry nodded.
Soon enough they were standing in front of St. Mary’s Hospital.
“Besides, you’re one to talk when it comes to having galleons in the bank.”
“Just an idea," Draco said. Harry’s heart jumped a little when he noticed Draco had a devious smile on his face. It quickly faded when Draco noticed how Harry was looking at him, and Harry quickly turned to look at his notes. He realized he had never seen Draco smile before, not unless he had been jeering at someone.
Draco let out an unamused laugh.
"Hundreds," Neville sighed. "I'll be lucky if I ever finish one."
Draco tensed up a little as Harry started talking.
“Very well. We take our leave then,” Harry said.
“Oh, he does," Draco said. “He writes everything down in that ruddy book of his.”
“Does the mask give him some kind of magic powers?”
“Merlin - okay, calm down! I didn’t see the mirror that well, alright? Harry was in the examination tent for a couple hours, right, and then we saw red sparks coming out. We all ran to see what was going on, but there was no one in the tent except a mirror, and the next thing I know is professor Toadsworth walks
“Professor Toadsworth was here to discuss the Defence Against the Dark Arts position, yes?”
“Exactly," Hermione said. “Kings and queens have been buried with their same-sex lovers for millenia and yet in history books it is always described how 'they must have had a wonderful friendship'.”
“What-”
"Do they know I'm here?"
“Actually," Harry said as the idea hit him, “we have to write a paper where we interview someone we consider a hero.”
That’s exactly when Harry saw Malfoy make a beeline from the dorms into the main building.
“I’m not drinking anything," Draco said. He handed Harry two one pound coins. “Go get yourself some tea and come sit down.”
“I’m two seconds away from losing my temper," Draco said and walked up to the professor, “so tell me - did you or did you not send Potter into the Mirror of Nemrot?”
“What do you mean?”
“Oh? Well, aren’t you a horny boy today- mnh-”
Then someone opened the door and looking up, Harry saw a blurry figure with ginger hair disappear into the corridor.
on your nose again," Malfoy said. For a few seconds he hesitated, looking as if he couldn't quite decide if he should say what he was thinking. "Besides... The right people stopped being the right people after the war. Things changed." He ran his slender fingers along the spine of his notebook.
"His friend, are you? I am under the impression that Mr. Potter returned to his dormitories."
“Yeah," Harry said. “I mean - it says I
"I don't want to make it worse for you," he said. "Between you and your family."
In that way, Draco was still the same. He wasn’t particularly fond of children, he wore carefully chosen black turtlenecks and the same swept-back haircut he had sported for years, he was reserved, easily jealous and enjoyed life most when he had a good book in one hand and Harry pressed against his side. It was work papers instead of comic books that Harry read now, but this habit of reading together was one they had managed to hold onto over the years.
“Now for the tricky part," he said. “Who can tell me why it has those ridges on its back?”
“We don’t need to have this conversation right now," he said as he closed the drawer.
“What the hell did you ask me out for then?” Draco laughed. “Aren’t you like, supposed to have some kind of plan first?”
“I suppose there was nothing on them in your books?”
Mrs. Weasley glanced at the snow storm behind her guests and gave an awkwardly high chuckle.
Harry’s lips parted, but only a tense exhale came out at first. “Because I wanted to?”
Without warning, Harry pressed Draco against the wall, perhaps just to interrupt his teasing.
“You’re blushing, Draco.”
“Well," Harry said, thinking of the way Malfoy had smiled at him in class, “he doesn’t think Muggles are trash anymore. That’s something, isn’t it?”
“Yeah," Harry said, feeling a familiar wave of anxiety burning in his gut. He felt bad for lying and pretending he had been listening to the conversation, but what was he supposed to say? Ruin everyone’s mood by saying he had been dissociating all morning? Again? It wasn’t as if anything they said was going to help, anyway.
"But what if I haven't got it anymore? What if-"
"I warned my son against that Black girl, you know. Good family, he said… ha! I heard they even have a werewolf these days. Is it true?"
Harry lifted his head to look at Draco as he came in. His eyes were swollen and red and he had stray hairs sticking onto where tears had trailed down his cheeks.
"An apology, I guess. And a thanks. He did save you that day."
And when the ruthlessly hot August comes and reminds Narcissa of a summer she spent in Vladivostok with Lucius, the sun blazing her skin and long dresses flowing against her legs in the wind, only to be hiked up by wandering hands in the cool hours of the evening, she receives word that Draco has indeed returned to Darthorn. Narcissa doesn't know where her son has spent the summer, and it seems none one of the letters where she practically begged him to join them at their Moscow home have changed his mind about going back to live with Muggles and the most common and uncivilized of wizarding folk.
Granger raised her brows as if urging Draco to continue, but it wasn’t enough to hide the fact that she was blushing.
“Yes.”
“What do you mean?”
The giraffe animagus in the portrait knows of a secret and can't keep the information to himself any longer. One can only hope he will tell the right people about what happened...
“No. He was the one who opened the fridge that morning, remember? He heard us talking.”
Hermione tilted her head.
“Ah- I’m already hard,” Harry said, the first words coming out a moan as Draco grinded against him, not leaving any room for guesses as to what it was he wanted.
“Maybe I should go back," Draco said out of the blue. He had a strange look in his eyes. It was as if he wasn’t even trying to focus them on anything in specific. “Pansy will be worried.”
Neville's brows raised.
Harry was not sitting up straight, nor was he unbothered by the situation. His hair was all over the place, his now-boyfriend (the thought made Harry's heart beat so fast he thought it might jump out of his chest at any minute to do riverdance in between the cereal boxes) was sitting next to him looking unfairly put together considering he had woken up after Harry, and across the table, snickering at him was Remus Lupin, his… Uncle? Not through blood of course, but still, such was their relationship these days - and he looked as if a flood of all kinds of clever comments would burst out of him any second now.
“Why would that mean we’re dating?” Harry huffed. “Besides, I’m not gay. If someone told you-”
“This is not of importance. Go now, and tell Mr. Weasley that I am expecting him. He is late for his exam, and I would not have the mirror left in the hands of my assistants for longer than is necessary.”
“But this is different," Draco said. “Don’t act like it isn’t. Every wizard in London would be on your case.”
Harry took the file from under his arm and opened it, pulling out a newspaper clipping. Draco immediately recognized which paper it was from, though he hadn’t seen one in years.
After a confused lag, Draco felt irritation take over him. He started to fumble for his wand. He didn’t find it, but Potter’s wand was conveniently tucked under the pillow on which Draco had slept on. He grabbed it, and as silently as he could, got out of the bed and crouched over the sleeping man on the floor, pointing the wand at his throat.
Remus’ voice faded as his eyes fixed on Draco who, much like Harry, was in the bed in his boxers, staring at Remus like a deer in the headlights of an oncoming car.
"What are you doing?"
“That bad, was it?” Draco said, even though in that moment he detested the man so much he could have jinxed him on the spot. The worst thing was, of course, that it wasn't even his error that had upset Draco.
Draco, still have affluence in civilized places. If you’d just-”
Harry decided to go see if Dean was in his room. He was an art major and into men in more ways than just aesthetic, so surely he wouldn’t think Harry was out of his mind for thinking Draco was kind of… bewitching to look at? Harry passed through the hallway and knocked on Dean’s door. He heard the sound of someone getting out of bed, but it was Seamus instead of Dean that opened the door. He was in sweatpants and a T-shirt and essentially looked like he was enjoying a day of doing absolutely nothing.
“Yeah. Good. And stay there.”
“See, if it was something like
“It’s just my complexion, I’m sure,” Draco said and gave a formal nod. “I’ll be off then, professor Wataida.”
Dean burst into laughter, and Harry was looking at him, but in his mind he was also still snogging Draco and mildly panicking over how intriguing the thought was.
“Yeah," Draco said. “Although, you don’t read much, do you? I only saw comic books in your room.”
“Are you really not tired of asking questions after today?”
“Yeah. He always tried telling me I had a choice though. Only made me hate him more at the time because I knew he was right.”
“Harry was there too," Ron’s voice said, and Harry realized he was being looked at.
“Shall we, then?” Draco said and held out his hand. Harry took it.
He started walking towards the main building. Harry went after him, smiling from ear to ear.
“Like studying. Or like, when Harry came looking for me in the library, I was writing my article on Amortentia for the Daily Prophet”, Granger said. “Listen, I’ve known Harry and Ron for ten years now and it’s pretty much established at this point that they fight no matter what I do.”
“Really? How?”
Ron stared into his cereal and didn’t say anything for a long time.
According to professor Skepperus' instructions, Harry wasn't wearing his Auror Trainee uniform that consisted of black, well-tailored clothes that had embroidered details in black thread that didn't reflect sunlight. Instead he had lazily thrown on a flannel and some jeans and figured that made him look enough like a Muggle. He was also wearing a beaten up, brown leather jacket that had once belonged to Sirius. He still hadn't gotten a haircut, and Ron had teased him about it at breakfast.
Harry felt something sharp rubbing against his thigh and checked his pocket. He pulled out the postcard from Luna, the one Hermione had given to him on the same day he had kissed Draco. The latter probably had something to do with why Harry had forgotten all about it. He looked at the picture - it was of a Flobberworm that squirmed as the picture moved - and turned it around. The backside was covered in tiny handwriting, and Harry had to move the card closer to the light so he could see what it said.
“Well," Hermione said, tilting her head, “
“Well, my friend, as the name would suggest”, Seamus said, turning to Ron, “a bottom is the one who
Harry wheeled around to look at Theodore, squinting.
Draco crouched in front of the grave, stuffed his gloves inside the pockets of his coat and started brushing away the wet sand. It got under his fingernails and under the cuffs of his shirt, and as the rain pounded against his face, he felt Harry’s presence behind him and was taken over by an unexplainable fit of annoyance.
“Potter," Draco whispered. “Potter!” He quickly placed Potter’s notebook on top of his head. He startled awake and caught the notebook in his hands just in time before Skepperus stopped in front of their desks.
"Your father's letter," Remus started as the laughter settled, "I got the feeling that he wanted to somehow reach you through me."
"But it's so- doesn't she ever think about the future? What if they do break up, will she just go to write for the Quibbler instead of doing what she loves?"
"Poor old bugger... Last time I interviewed him must've been three years ago. Other foot in the grave already back then if you ask me."
“Tickling?”
“We don’t even have our wands.” Malfoy tried to pace around and when he realized he couldn’t, he said: “Fuck!”
“It’s okay.”
"No, that's- yeah!"
“I overheard him say the password. One of those portrait doors.”
“You’re lying. There’s no way Pansy would have succeeded at brewing Amortentia.”
"Maybe she really loves Scamander," Harry said and rubbed the part of his nose that his glasses were always pressing on. He didn't really know why Hermione was so heated about Luna dropping out. It wasn't like the two had been best friends.
“What was your impression of Toadsworth?”
"Ever heard of a haircut, Potter?"
“He means
"Why are you dressed like a mudblood?" She asked, her voice light and gentle.
“I think you know why," he said instead.
“God, I’m so stupid...”
“Got it. Let’s go?”
“Do come in, Neville,” a woman’s voice said in an accent Draco didn’t quite recognize, though he liked to think he had become decent with accents after working at a pharmacy for so long. “As you very well know, I don’t bite unless prompted.” Perhaps Zimbabwean? Or Nigerian? Definitely African, either way. But that was besides the point, because the woman inside clearly thought Draco was Neville, which was a misconception he quite wanted to correct. He stepped inside the classroom.
"What are you looking at, Potter?" Malfoy said without taking his eyes off the front of the classroom. He spit out the 'P' in Harry's name in an all too familiar way.
Today was supposed to have been that day, but it was already a quarter past five and the cottage in Fort William, reluctantly funded by Gringotts, was lacking one of two spouses.
"I don't think I want to come."
“Merlin’s beard, Draco, think about it! You’re an Alchemy major. It would have been easy enough for her to steal your key to the lab and just take some.”
“She could always transfigure it to say something else.”
"Sure," Dean said and gently removed the quill from Seamus' hand. "Let's eat something, yeah?"
“What? How?”
“Nothing, I’m fine," Harry said and quickly wiped his eyes. “Honestly.”
Later, after Draco had convinced Harry that he could handle Theodore Nott, Harry followed Draco to the door, not really knowing how they would manage a parting with Remus waiting in the kitchen, pretending to be very interested in the ceiling.
“And it was… addressed to him? To Neville?”
"Ron?" Hermione said.
My apologies for the delay of this chapter!
And before Draco had thrown his last look at the snow outside, the room stretched and distorted and pressure hummed around him, and then he was in Harry's room. It was empty - Harry had no doubt gone looking for him. But where?
“No," Hermione said. “He said he couldn’t. He said you made him promise not to tell anyone.”
“Of course there’s spells for that - Merlin, how are straight wizards doing it then?”
“Why, hello you,” she said, clearly surprised to see Draco there. “Merry Christmas!”
may be used to all the publicity, but that doesn’t mean Draco is.”
“Now then, boys,” she said as they stepped over the threshold, “I’ve got a fresh batch of mince pies in the oven. We better get you two to them before the rest of the clan catches a sniff. As soon as Fred and George get here, we can get started on setting the table. You two look like you aren't eating properly - now, say what you will, but one of you is going to have to learn how to cook!”
"We," he said, "we were going to eat something."
“Really?”
The lecture was brilliant. Charles was funny and witty, and spent the last thirty minutes talking about his personal favourite species of dragon, the Hebridean Black.
“I did,” McGonagall said, “though I didn’t tell her that. I said to her I would owl her that same evening. That’s why I was surprised to find that she hadn’t yet left by the time I was done talking with Mr. Scamander.”
"I don't look that bad, do I?" Harry said and gladly abandoned the chore of folding his clothes that he had, as usual, stuffed into his trunk only when he had already been a little late for the train. "I know I need a haircut."
“It’s really none of your business, Potter.”
“What? No, you’re right - let’s go find the elevator.”
Granger looked down.
"Maybe you could visit Dora at the Ministry one of these days," Remus suggested. "She could tell you about what it's really like."
“Alright," Granger said and turned to leave.
"Different, yes," Remus nodded, "but the same where it mattered most. They were kind people, but I'm telling you, for most of what time we had at Hogwarts they drove each other mad with that endless bickering and competing... But when they were together, it seemed that for them, no one else existed. Only them. And even so, I'll admit, when Lily told me she was expecting, I was terrified for the baby, well, you, because I knew what James could be like - but when you were born, being a father seemed to come naturally to him. Of course, I understand that part a little better these days, but back then… I suppose if it had been Ron in the kitchen instead of me, seeing Draco give you that book, he might have felt the same way."
“It will take us all night to find it if it’s on one of those shelves," Draco said.
Harry thought about it. No, he had never had a problem where he had found himself thinking of Ron all the time. But surely that alone didn't mean that he was into guys?
"Actually, I think I get it”, Ron said, swallowing down.
"You're like that," Draco said. "Like a lake."
"But why? What if they break up, what then?" Hermione huffed.
“I was just dissociating," Harry pointed out. “It’s not the same thing.”
“Even if he doesn’t, it’s still okay that you like him.”
Harry glanced behind his shoulder at the giraffe in the portrait.
To that, McGonagall shrugged.
Why was it that midnight seemed to slip further away into the future even though the clock ticked on? Every time Harry thought that surely at least half an hour had passed and looked at the watch, he started to feel more and more like it was mocking him for being so impatient.
Draco didn’t know what to say. He stared at his shoes.
“Good. I’ll come up with a plan by lunch. Let’s do it tonight.”
“Is it because I’m kneeling like this?” Harry said, a wry smile lingering in the corner of his mouth. “What are you thinking about?”
Draco pressed his ear against the door and listened. Through the silent hum of his own blood flow he could hear muffled, throaty weeps.
“Tell her what?” Harry said, still flustered.
"Me neither," Harry admitted.
“What the hell are you doing?” Harry said, too confused to even laugh. Draco climbed in and practically fell to Harry’s arms as the broom escaped his grasp. Water was dripping from his hair, which to Harry's surprise, looked dark when it was wet.
Just as it was getting a little too hot under the blanket, there was a knock on the door. That immediately informed Draco it wasn't Weasley, and for that he was relieved. It was enough humiliation for the week that Draco had lost a game of chess to him.
“I didn’t lie to her," Malfoy said. “I told her I didn’t know if it was you.”
She sits and thinks about what she should do - Lucius refuses to even speak of Draco anymore, he is too disgusted after seeing his son's hand being taken by the Potter boy. He keeps snarling at Narcissa, telling her she should've let Draco go to Durmstrang and none of this would have happened. Narcissa knows this. Again, her will to keep Draco close, to pamper him and spoil him, has made things worse for him. Narcissa remembers her fear of Draco forgetting how to speak English if he only spoke Russian at school, and scorns herself. Foolish woman, there are worse things to be afraid of, she wishes she could tell her past self.
"Apology accepted," Granger said. She turned to look at the main building, and looked as if in her mind she was looking at another place entirely. “You know, I remember the way you’d look at Harry in class."
Harry watched as Draco pulled from his pocket an amulet that hung on a long, golden chain. It swayed back and forth in the wind, revealing itself as an eye of Horus symbol on a triangular base. It resembled a stained glass window with the eye being formed by translucent, colourful pieces of glass or crystal set in a gold frame.
“Maybe we should ask Hermione," Harry said. “She's brewed it a couple of times. First time was in year two, although that time it didn’t work for very long.”
“How do you expect me to help him if you don’t tell me what happened?” Draco growled, and the Weasley took a step back.
This caught Draco a little off guard.
“I’m bloody surprised our whole year hasn’t been in therapy,” Neville huffed.
“You ever been inside one of those before?” Draco asked.
hard to understand it. How it all worked, because all I ever learned how to do was keep up appearances and take advantage of people, and the way that you guys just seemed like you… were
"Did Adrik do… what Grindelwald did?"
After making it to the other side of the gate they walked for a bit. Harry didn’t really see the point in asking where they were going as he was going to find out soon enough anyway. Draco was walking pretty swiftly and his pace gave Harry some reassurance. No one walked with that kind of intent while they were upset.
“No,” Arthur said, “nothing like that. They sent one to everyone who has children at Hogwarts.”
“Exactly," Hermione said. “I think he bullied you because he was trying to make himself look better after what happened before we went into the Great Hall. On the day we all first met, remember?”
"I want to not care. I just want to… I want to be normal."
"Like hell I am - and how would you know, you don't even have your glasses on-"
deaf.”
"Year two," Ron said, stuffing a handful of crisps into his mouth, effectively sprinkling the crumbs all over his sweater.
“I suppose he’s very busy with work a lot of the time.”
"Calming Draught would help."
“Well, I - I used to read about Muggles sometimes in the library at Hogwarts. Never told anyone about that, actually.”
Ron turned to look at him.
And it was actually on that very day when the bee came flying in that Draco was finally starting to feel better again. He hadn't realized until he had made a snarky comment about something and Harry had smiled at him in a soft way that was different from his usual smiles. It wasn't the mischievous smirk that belonged with his awful dad jokes (that always made Draco laugh, despite how awful they were) or his lewd comments that he hadn't sprinkled around as abundantly lately. Draco knew it was probably out of some kind of respect for his feelings or whatever, but he was actually slowly starting mind it.
“Especially you,” Neville continued. “And Harry, but, well… That goes without saying.”
“I mean it decided to retire from the lifting business," Harry said, inspecting what buttons he had left to try. He tried the one with a bell on it. It let out a buzzing sound, but nothing happened.
“And it didn’t ever occur to your one and a half brain cells that I never asked for your help, did it? God, Potter, you probably get some sick pleasure from having people praise you for saving them. No wonder you want to be an Auror.”
"How did you…" Harry was perplexed as he turned the pages, looking at moving pictures of famous - and not so famous - Quidditch players, photographed as they had been interviewed for the book.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good. Did they give an estimate of the time of death?”
Laughing, Draco quickly put an end to Harry’s false attempt at getting up, which resulted in Harry once more being pinned against the mattress by the wrists.
“Actually, you already have," Harry continued. “At your house, remember? You didn’t tell Bellatrix it was me. Voldemort could’ve killed me that day, but you-”
“I will," Hermione said but didn’t look like she was planning to move just yet. “Harry - if you
“Good.”
"I don't want you to be just anyone," he mumbled against Harry's back.
"The blame for our late arrival should be placed on me," Draco said. "There was an errand I had to tend to before we could come here."
“I’ll read the article when they publish it," Draco said. “Really, I don’t think I could’ve come up with anything to make it better.”
"Thank you. I appreciate it."
"But sometimes, what at one point seemed impossible to obtain becomes normal. And we start to take it for granted. That’s just human nature, right? Or I should like to think it is," Draco said, "because if not, then I am surely as wretched as I am ungrateful."
“It is not a word I use to belittle someone, Mr. Malfoy. In fact, the opposite is true - I feel Mr. Potter has done more for our cause than perhaps any other wizard of the past, present or future can ever hope to achieve. I would see him live a peaceful life somewhere, planting potatoes, were it up to me.”
Harry gripped Draco's thighs and prised them wider, plunging in and out faster. "Oh yeah. Scream harder, love. Let the neighbours hear you," he teased as Draco cried out on every thrust. "Let them know what a slut you are for my big, fat cock..."
Draco just smirked at Harry and waved a hand towards the sofa. "Go on then, make yourself comfortable. I'll be just a minute."
much? Was he feeling this because Draco reminded him of what he was missing out on during lunch earlier?
Draco nodded. He almost drooled at the sight of Harry's cock, the head an angry red colour, standing up proudly among a nest of black curls as messy as the hair on his head. It was bigger than anything he'd ever had, and Draco could see a drop of precome forming at the tip. He moaned.
Oops. Harry forgot that nobody outside of him and his friends knew about their little adventure in second year.
"Shh.. it's okay, love," Harry peppered his face with kisses, and Draco felt the wave of a wandless cleaning charm aimed at him which vanished the uncomfortable wet feeling immediately.
"I've always dreamt of fucking you on this counter," Harry's pupils were so dilated, the green almost swallowed up by black as he took in the sight of Draco clad in nothing but his apron.
Because -
stopped the tickling and pulled the dildo out.
"Daddy! Up! Up!" James held up his tiny hands towards Harry.
Unfortunately, Draco got a shock when Harry carried him without warning. Coupled with another kick from their baby and the amount of pee he was holding inside, Draco finally lost control of his bladder, sobbing into Harry's shoulder as he felt pee wetting his swim trunks and upper thighs, and splashing onto the sand below.
The next few weeks, Harry spent all his free time watching Draco's Baking Delights. At least he now had something to look forward to other than the rare times he was able to meet with Ron and Hermione.
"Fuck me Harry, fuck me so hard I won't be able to sit for one week straight," Draco pulled Harry towards him, giving his boyfriend another kiss and burying his face in Harry's neck. "Fuck me with your thick cock and let the whole world know I'm
"So, Harry..." Draco began, sitting himself elegantly on the sofa, "I think it's best to get to know you better before we start. How did you find out about my videos?"
When Draco decided to start a YouTube channel, he wasn't sure if anyone would bother watching his videos. But it turned out he worried for nothing. His natural flair for flirting in front of the camera put him at ease, and he also had something to occupy his hands with while baking.
Whoever this Draco was, he was definitely something special. Harry couldn't remember the last time he felt so strongly about someone. Not only was Draco easy on the eyes, he was also witty and quite sweet. At 25, Harry had always thought himself too old for Internet celebrity crushes, but he didn't know about Draco back then, did he?
"Watch out, Draco!" That was Harry's voice. Draco looked around just in time to dodge a stray Bludger, groaning at the sensation his bladder made.
The next Friday, Harry hurriedly left the office and made a beeline for his apartment. He opened his YouTube app and was excited to see that Draco's new video had been uploaded. Draco was baking a lavender infused ice cream cake, but Harry was too nervous to concentrate on Draco's arse this time round. He anxiously scrolled towards the end of the video, praying to all the gods in the world.
"Oh..." Draco smirked. "Well, care to explain why I'm all tied up here?"
"You wish."
"Congratulations to Green Eyed Monster! Please send me a message!" Draco said, smiling as the comment in question was shown in the video.
Back in their apartment, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley were also watching this new video.
Harry's eyes narrowed. "Don't try to act coy, Malfoy. Seems you remember it just fine," he said, seeing the realisation dawn on his husband's face.
Ron looked like he was about to ask Harry a ton of questions, but thankfully they were in a meeting and he couldn't do that. Harry shoved his papers at Ron, and almost tripped on his feet while trying to stand up when the lips started sucking on his cock again. He clutched his stomach and hightailed it out of the room.
"Wait!" Harry reached out and made as if he wanted to touch Draco but wasn't sure if the gesture was welcome. Draco raised an eyebrow.
"Oh Merlin, I'm sorry Malfoy."
"I didn't know you were so urgent," Potter whispered in his ear, kissing his cheek tenderly. Secretly, he found it hot watching his arch nemesis lose control of his bladder and having a full-blown accident in public.
, he thought, tapping his foot impatiently.
"How do you know what the dungeons look like?"
"There's no restroom around here," Harry looked around, frowning. Draco just groaned again, holding on to his stomach.
he thought.
"The lift's not moving and there are no lights," Draco said.
"You mean on a date?" Draco blurted the first thing on his mind, then mentally slapped himself for sounding so desperate.
"Come on, let's go," Harry said, guiding Draco in the direction of the restroom. "Unless you want to have a go in the sea? Or the sand? There's no one around anyway."
wasn't moving, and his bladder wasn't cooperating at all. If anything, he felt hungry and he needed to pee even more. What he needed was a bit of distraction. Draco started pacing around the perimeter of the lift, checking his reflection in the mirror. He frowned at the dark circles under his eyes and made a mental note to moisturise and have a good rest once he got home.
"What do you want, Potter?" Draco hissed once they were out of earshot. Harry noticed the fetching blush spreading across his high cheekbones and smiled.
"No, Malfoy. Look, I'm really sorry," Draco looked as Potter swallowed nervously. "Why not I bring you back to mine, get you cleaned up proper and make it up to you?"
"I still don't understand why you want to come," she said, sipping at her Firewhisky and gesturing to the rest of their ex-classmates mingling with each other in Seamus' home. "You're not even on speaking terms with anyone here except me."
"I told you I needed to
Harry almost laughed out loud at that. He must be really sex deprived if the sight of a bloke's nipple got him so horny.
"Are you sure? Do you want to fly around Hogwarts yourself? Maybe become owl fodder?" Harry asked him sweetly.
"Sure, anything for you," Harry replied, then mentally cursed himself for sounding so cheesy.
"S...sorry. Having a bit of stomachache," Harry fibbed.
"Potter, if you don't mind -" Robards began.
"Is this okay?" Harry asked, finger still hovering teasingly at his entrace. Draco rolled his eyes.
"What's happening?" Draco's eyes grew wide, when he realised he forgot to press the button for Level 9 again once the lift was repaired. Instead, the lift was travelling to another godforsaken department in the Ministry! Draco desperately pressed the button for Level 9 to no avail. This time, his poor bladder couldn't take it anymore. Draco bent down, whimpering as pee escaped him. He looked down to see his grey trousers and shoes completely soaked through, and there was no stopping it. Pee formed a big puddle on the floor, and coming to his senses, Draco quickly cast a levitating charm on his tray, just as the lift chimed and stopped.
"Fuck," he sobbed out, pressing the heel of his hand harder into his crotch and not daring to breathe.
"Your comment stood out from the rest," Draco looked up at Harry, a small smirk playing on his lips, and Harry felt the urge to kiss it away. "I just had to pick you. And I'm not disappointed."
"So, as we were saying..." Head Auror Robards gave him a funny look and continued on with whatever he was talking about. Which Harry had
"Since when did you care about them?" Pansy raised an eyebrow, following his gaze until she saw Potter. "
"I love you too, Harry," he said in a small voice, and Harry captured his lips once more.
Harry was just about to reach his destination when the Snitch suddenly flew upwards. Harry saw Draco flying in the same direction and knew his old broom couldn't make it. But he kept his eyes trained on Draco's arse, just in case.
"Honestly, Harry. Do you think Malfoy of all people would sabotage his potions and drag his name deeper into the mud? Anyway, he's changed. I see him sometimes when he's delivering potions to Flora, and we talk a bit too."
Draco's stomach hurt from holding his pee in for too long, and he really wanted to knock on the door and tell the person to hurry up, but as a wizard of good upbringing, he thought it would be terribly rude to do so. He felt his pee pushing against his bladder, trying to leak out, and he decided to just screw it and let go. He didn't know if the person inside had dropped into the toilet bowl, but he'd rather not risk waiting and putting the strain on his bladder even more.
"What do you mean? Hey, the camera's facing the wrong direction," Draco frowned. Instead of facing the kitchen counter directly, the camera was angled sideways.
"Lighten up Draco, it's just a friendly game," Harry poked at his side. Draco batted Harry's hand away and flew higher up.
To be fair, his videos attracted a lot of lewd comments, and he was grossed out by some of them. But he knew that sex sells, and he
"I'm not dreaming," Draco drawled. "Have you set up the camera?"
Harry held the phone with trembling hands, video paused at the moment when Draco flashed Harry's username on screen.
There was no noise from the cubicle and Draco silently cursed. Was this person playing with one of their horrendous Muggle contraptions inside? He certainly saw a lot of such people around the restaurant. Even children were using them. Harry had referred to their little contraptions as
Draco was starting to breathe harshly now, burying his face in his arms as Harry reached under him to fondle his balls, driving him on the brink to insanity. "H..Harry..." he sobbed. "Please... Need you..."
Harry smirked to himself. He wondered if Draco needed to pee. He remembered seeing the blond drinking a lot before the game started. He felt bad for not talking to Draco just now, but every time he tried to make his way towards him, he somehow got stopped by excited ex-classmates who wanted to catch up. He knew it was a perverted thought, but right now all he wanted was to see Draco pee his pants again, the Snitch be damned.
and peered at the buttons. He wasn't familiar with lifts at all. There was one that looked to be an emergency button, and he hesitantly pressed it.
"Hmph. Whatever. I'm tired of being manhandled by you. Can you change me back??"
Draco smirked, cradling his stomach protectively. Harry had gotten him pregnant in what the
Draco pressed his hand harder into his crotch and looked up. They were not even halfway to the restroom. He whimpered again, stifling a sob. He felt like crying so badly, and right now it seemed his baby was showing no mercy to his already weak bladder. Harry brushed his hair away from his face, and suddenly, he picked Draco up bridal style and made to carry him the rest of the way.
Harry took that as an invitation and his wandering hands reached the waistband of Draco's jeans. As he made to unbutton it, he felt his hands being pulled away.
"What exactly did you
They were only interrupted when the waiter brought their food and drinks. The food Harry ordered for Draco was good, and the hot chocolate that accompanied it was amazing. Draco loved it so much, Harry ordered another large mug for him, but not before shooting him an indulgent smile.
"Aww, what's wrong baby?" the man asked, reaching lower to grab boldly at Draco's arse.
All of a sudden, the lift jerked and started moving again. Draco almost sighed in relief, glancing to make sure his potions vials were all right. It wouldn't be long before he could drop off this tray with the receiptionist and quickly hightail it to the nearest loo.
"Please..." Draco whined, not sure if the man heard him, but he probably didn't. The man spun him around so that they could grind their clothed erections together. The movement made Draco's pee slosh dangerously inside him, threatening to spill out at any moment.
"Do you..erm..wanna go out with me?"
In the middle of their conversation, Draco suddenly felt the urge to pee. He didn't dare to interrupt Harry, who was telling him all about his godson Teddy Lupin. Draco had never met the boy before, nor had he met anyone from his side of the family. And since Teddy was technically Draco's cousin, he wanted to find out more.
"You okay?" Harry stroked his hair tenderly. "Want to sit?"
Harry felt a bit guilty at that. Ever since Draco had James, their sex life had dwindled a bit. The toddler really had a lot of energy and seemed to have a knack for getting into trouble (much like his other father, Draco always said), and most times Harry and Draco were too tired at the end of the day to do anything but sleep.
??" Malfoy whined. "Stop pulling my wings!"
Harry's hips stilled and he pulled out of Draco.
"Careful," Harry steadied him, gazing into his eyes. "Long time no see, Draco."
Draco wanted to say yes, but he remembered the childlike joy in Harry's eyes as he played in the sea and picked shells. He couldn't find it in his heart to tell Harry he just wanted to sit for a while. So, he shook his head.
Draco's collaboration with Harry turned out to be a success. Their natural chemistry shone through in the video, gaining Draco many new fans and subscribers.
Harry wondered if he should tell Ron and Hermione about his luck, but decided against it. They'd probably tease him about his YouTube username and call him obsessed, and Harry didn't think he would be able to handle that now.
"Er... Let me help you," Potter aimed a cleaning charm on his clothes and the floor, vanishing the pee instantly. "Where are you off to?"
"You consider this a date?" Harry asked, smirking back at the blond.
"Sorry to disappoint you Potter, but I don't put out on the first date," Draco smirked, obviously trying for a snarky tone but he ended up sounding breathless instead.
"Here, have some of these," Hermione interrupted Harry's musings.
"What was that all about?" she asked suspiciously. "You and Potter were getting awfully close up there."
, Potter?" Draco spat out, his wand hand trembling slightly trying to keep the tray of potions aloft.
"Whatever, Malfoy. Nobody asked you to start a fight. Let's leave you like that for a while. See how you like it," Harry poked Malfoy in the chest.
Instead of heading for Transfiguration, Harry decided to skip the lesson and go back to his dorm. He was thankful that most students were having lessons and there was no one walking along the hallways.
At first, Draco was hesitant to go, but all it took was an owl from Harry asking if he'd like to join. Draco didn't dare admit it, but he missed Harry badly. The raven haired man had been busy with field work and thus, Draco had not seen him on his weekly trips to the Ministry.
"But we're not friends, Potter," Draco smirked.
Almost.
"More," Draco moaned and clutched at Harry's back, nails clawing into the sweat slicked skin.
Harry didn't realise he was following so closely behind Draco, longing to get his hands on that arse, when Draco suddenly turned around.
"This is only open to subscribers in London, and you have to come to my place so that we can discuss and film our video. In order to take part, comment to say why you'd like to bake with me! I'll pick the best answer, and contact you again. Good luck, and thanks for watching!" Draco blew a kiss and ended the video.
Harry had taken to collecting beautiful seashells along the shore. Draco indulged him. He knew of Harry's past with the Dursleys, and to see his husband enjoying the simple pleasures of life made Draco happy too.
Harry licked his lips (another action that did not go unnoticed by Draco, who was sure his eyes had darkened with lust) and launched into the basics of Auror training.
Scrolling back, he rewatched the parts he missed. And he was glad he actually bothered to watch the end of the video.
As Draco began to lean against Harry's chest, the dark haired man cradled Draco possessively, and started to massage the blond's sore wrists. He wouldn't trade Draco for anything else.
"Did you... er... have an accident?"
It felt like a pair of lips on his body, except of course there were definitely no lips whatsoever. The lips started with light kisses on his nipples. Harry thought that it was his imagination, because all he felt was one soft kiss, then nothing for about 5 minutes, and then another kiss. Did he miss sex
"No! As friends, I guess. Or whatever. Just for lunch? I have the rest of the day off."
I happen to see him." Hermione finally agreed.
The best thing he got out of it? A boyfriend.
Draco stuck his nose into the air. "I don't need to use it any more."
"Alright there, Malfoy?" Harry finally caught on to Draco's discomfort.
