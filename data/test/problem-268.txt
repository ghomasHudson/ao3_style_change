Harry wasn’t surprised, really. Even if Arthur had gone ahead and gotten the tickets for the top from whoever had given them to him in the last life, his family likely would not have wanted to go. It had only been a few months since the incident, after all, they were likely all still in mourning.
All of the dark tar finally flaked away, revealing a three centimeter long nugget of pure gold in its place. Nicolas reached forward with a hand, which was now covered with a dragon-hide glove, and picked up the small piece of gold. Reaching for a petri dish, he then let the nugget fall into it, and set that onto the table between them. Waiting only a moment, Harry curiously leaned forward, watching as the sun’s light from a nearby window hit the gold and made it glimmer.
“Harry-Harry Potter, is it? Wonderful, absolutely wonderful to meet you. This is the-yes, this is Harry Potter… the boy-who-lived? You know of him, I’m sure.” The minister tripped through his words, reaching for Harry’s outstretched hand as he stood to greet both of the men. “Yes, I-um… it’s a pleasure to meet you officially, Mister Potter. This… this is-”
himself over his desk as he grasped for a quill and parchment. He didn’t have physical proof, but knowing Tom it wouldn’t be long before the man started making ripples in an effort to regain his forces. It seemed necessary now to close in the walls around Harry Potter as well, especially now that Albus’ head was free of the obstructions the hex bags had shrouded him in.
Slowly sitting up, Harry listened as ice cracked across his body, the thin sheet on his skin cracking and splintering in an effort to stay frozen.. He took his time sitting up, slowly dragging himself to the connected bathroom only to set the large bath to the hottest setting. He contemplated if it would be considered clingy to try and fire call Draco that morning, or perhaps Nicolas had things planned for breakfast and didn’t want him wasting any time on trivial things like fire calling people he had seen just the other day. He glanced into the mirror as he undressed, observing his waxy skin that seemed almost blue from the ice and cold that it had been subject to. Sinking into the scalding water, Harry sighed and closed his eyes, imagining that Draco was there with him, and instead of water, the other boy was the one causing the warmth that surrounded him.
Lucius nodded, signing his full name at the bottom of his own letter with shaking hands. “Yes, I completely agree. Shall I write to Sir Flamel and see if he is willing to concede to such an arrangement?”
Draco rubbed at his face tiredly, picking up both of the letters and stuffing them away into his pocket. He had known for some time now-several years in fact-that his father was untrustworthy in regards to his inheritance. He had stopped questioning the man about it at this point, preferring to go to Harry or-whenever he was particularly desperate-his mother for help. This had worked well enough for the year, though he could admit that it was not an ideal situation, all this considered. It also concerned him that Harry had shown no outward signs that he was unsettled by his father’s actions, though that was understandable considering that Harry was… well, Harry. It was a bit hurtful that Draco had to learn about it through Miss. Delacour’s letter, though he couldn’t be sure that she was not over exaggerating Harry’s own feelings or just lying outright.
Harry stopped in place, his eyebrows furrowed as she turned back to look at him. “Do you mean to say we should just… wing it?”
She could ignore the itch for now, while they were at her home and safe. She could ignore it while they were sitting out in this little patch of field where the garden meets the forest beyond, sunbathing and relaxing and living in the way that they deserved to do.
Climbing down from his perch, Draco’s mind swam with thoughts of these mysterious books that Miss. Delacour was offering to him, and the questions that he might finally get answered inside of them. Would it be a wasted effort to try and meet with the woman when he was in France? Harry likely wouldn’t find issue with it, but Draco was loath to attempt to leave his soulmate’s side during the short few days that he would have him. Would such a meeting even be worth it? He didn’t know, though perhaps if he wrote the woman a letter asking his questions he would be able to see if she was genuine or just full of herself. Harry certainly seemed to trust her, which gave him a positive outlook on any future correspondence between them, and her letter was-while rather blunt and to the point-very effective and pleasant enough.
Harry bit his lip, suddenly feeling a sense of foreboding. He still didn’t understand why the girl’s letter made him feel so unsettled, so unnerved, but that feeling shouldn’t stop him from ever picking up another envelope again, right? It wasn’t like Luna would write to him twice after all, especially since he had yet to respond to the first one. It was probably from one of his other friends, or maybe a random person. It was his birthday, after all, it was hardly odd to get things for his birthday, right?
She noticed rather quickly that, much like the way Hermione Granger walked—though the girl didn’t seem to be present; Luna passingly wondered if she really had been shipped off to France—the man hobbled along on a limp. She decided very suddenly that he had to have a missing leg, but… but he couldn’t!
“I didn’t want it to go like this, Dray. You understand that right?” He mumbled, eyes trained on the vague outline of Draco’s loafers. “When I first got the letter, I was going to go straight to you, but…”
fact could have possibly flown under his nose for so long. But he stopped himself, reminding himself forcefully that this was the year he would
anything that could bring relief. He didn’t know what he was searching for, if it was in his own mind or outside of it, but he tried to reach out—find some sort of comfort or peace away from the agony clouding his every thought.
“Ah, just a moment.” Thrusting the rather obnoxious pile of clothing in Sirius’s unexpected hands, Harry turned swiftly to his left to find Fleur Delacour and her younger sister standing just a few feet away. He smiled in a way that was more indicative of a grimace, glancing down at the tiny girl who looked like she was about to burst in excitement.
Harry repeated the statement in his mind a few more times as his mentor placed the jar back onto the table and pulled a phial out of a rack on the table, inside which was a blood-red liquid that immediately caught his attention.
Harry smiled, a tired, relieved smile. “I was going mad, you know. Had a bit of a meltdown and everything. Though, that had to do with other things as well and… anyway.”
be his friend. And Blaise had realized that as long as he could say that, Harry’s personal secrets didn’t matter a whole bunch. The boy clearly had a good reason for keeping them, and Blaise was completely understanding of why that might be. They all deserved to keep personal things, well,
Malfoy. Harry, this is such a huge title, and you’re being handed it on a silver bloody platter, do you
Marvolo broke out into a dead sprint, jumping over the hole he had created in the floor in the present and stepping on the back of Lord Riddle in the past. His memories supplied him with the next movement, and in perfect synchrony with his past self, he raised his right hand, the resurrection stone gleaming cruelly in the morning sun as the sickly green of a killing curse was expelled from his hand. In the present, it bounced harmlessly into a decaying wall and dispersed, magic expelling itself out into the surrounding air as if nothing had happened. In the past, however, the first Tom Riddle tripped mid-stride, already dead as his body toppled through the air and slammed hard into the stone floor beneath them. Marvolo, half-mad and deliriously delighting in his little charade, forgot himself in the throes of false victory, yelling out in delight as he played out the next new moments fully in the past.
Harry’s eyes ripped open, and he whipped around to find… an empty halfway, void of anything but him. Harry felt half in his mind as his head whipped around the hallway, his eyes skating over every little thing as he searched for the voice. It had sounded so
He sighed, leaning back till his head hit the cushion of his chair. It always seemed to be about his image. What would be good and what would be bad. Couldn’t he just be left in peace to work?
Blaise eyed the trunk curiously. He couldn’t help but wonder why Harry hadn’t left it on the train, but he also knew there was very little likelihood that he wanted anything to do with it.
“I don’t think his character over the past few years really makes a difference Luna. He still did what he did.” Theo’s matter-of-fact tone disrupted the pleasant thought, and she bit back a rude quip in regards to his mood as of late before pinning him with a sickeningly cheery smile.
“Are you sure? He seems awfully… well…” Draco started, being unable to finish his sentence as Harry grabbed him around the wrist and started tugging him towards the man. “Harry-blimey, you aren’t really going to bother the poor bloke, are you-?”
Edit: If you can't see the drawings I have an imgur with the same username (hoboheartache) where you can see all of them, as well as the past drawings.
“How is it different, Harry?” Came the quiet reply, so sharp and distinct that he nearly reeled backward in shock. He could practically
Just a little warning here because it's honestly kinda funny (if mostly cringey) but I understand if it's not something a lot of readers are here for, but if you don't feel like reading my medication fueled ramblings you can skip over the normal text in between each drawing and just look at the pretty pictures. There is a liiiiiittle bit of lore analisis thrown in there somewhere but it's mostly just me talking randomly about thoughts that each drawing brings forth from my twisted, evil little gremlin subconscious, so you don't have to worry about missing anything important if you just skip over those.
Harry laughed as Draco shakily stood, using the taller boy’s shoulder as support while he looked around for Perenelle. He spotted her wiping her mouth a few yards away, a thoroughly assaulted bush next to her having gotten the brunt of her half-digested dinner. She stumbled slightly, before righting herself and reaching into a pocket in her blouse, pulling a handkerchief from the folds and dabbing around her mouth with it.
It seemed that he could stand there and contemplate millions of possibilities, but there would be no way for him to know for sure what his father wanted from Harry, or if he wanted anything at all. He would, of course, tell Harry about his father’s wish, and then he would make sure that Harry didn’t do anything
Blaise got the distinct feeling that he shouldn’t have asked, not completely sure if the emotion racing through him was curiosity or unease.
“Portkeys.” Perenelle muttered, brushing down the thick wool of her skirt before looking back at the two of them as if nothing were amiss. “I must admit, portkeys don’t appeal to me very much. I’ve had them stolen a time or two and have been stranded because of it, so I tend to prefer flying, really.”
Hello again! Whew, it's been a while, but I'm back again with a particularly long chapter for you all. Cheers!
explain how you managed such a feat as this, and when.” The man set a firm hand on his shoulder, his eyes filled with a familiar mix of curiosity and concern that had been rampant in Draco’s face for much of the last week that they had seen each other. The look was genuine, if strained.
“I…” He gulped thickly, glancing between the three people furiously as the woman finally finished resetting his joints and stood back, her face falling back into the dark of night once again.
They walked through the circular doorway, the taste of something vaguely spicey in the air assaulting his senses immediately upon entrance. He squinted, feeling some sort of tingling sensation in his nose, eyes, and ears as Tom coughed. “What in Merlin's name is that?”
Nicolas bit the inside of his cheek to stop the sarcastic quip that was threatening to bubble up from his throat. “I am here to see Olympe on her request. I suppose you are here for the same reason?”
“Hadrian, just because muggles do not have magic of their own, does not mean that they can not live without it. A magical human does not die if they lose their magic, just as a muggle can exist without it. Just because a ‘soul’ is thought to be someone’s life force, does not mean that it is actually someone’s
Before he could so much as reply she was out the door, her footsteps already fading as Harry finally let out a strained little laugh. Draco settled back into the couch with a thump, rubbing at his chest as the feather brooch vibrated along with Harry’s chuckles. He hadn’t been paying the slightest bit of attention to it for the past several, utterly perplexing minutes, but for some reason it felt more pronounced than it had been over the past few weeks. Was distance a factor in the charm’s strength? Shaking the thought from his mind, Draco glanced Harry’s way with unfamiliar caution. The brief hug they had shared before hardly felt like anything considering how long they had been apart, and the distance between them now felt completely unacceptable. Something inside him was cautious though, as if the usual comfort he enjoyed with Harry needed to slowly return after the long time spent apart.
"Donc, tu es l'amoureux de Harry Potter?" She questioned immediately, her expectant gaze holding no small amount of spite. Draco’s nose seemed to scrunch in distaste before his entire demeanor seemed to shift from casual to one far more… haughty? Harry glanced between the two of them, momentarily caught off guard.
“Yeah? And how do you know anything about that? Did you sneak off to France to spy on him from the bushes?” He teased, snorting as Draco’s face erupted in a quite lovely shade of fuchsia.
Hermione Granger’s soul, and there was a place very distinctly missing where her leg should be. The piece of her soul that had been in that leg had receded back into her body over the months after her leg had been removed. That was how it
that she was being forcibly reminded of those old dreams again. How long had it been since she dreamed those dreams? Two years now, she thought.
However, even then he found himself annoyed with the nonsensical nature of the estate. It didn’t help in the slightest that there were so few windows to let light in either, as Duncan had also
you bastard.” He muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose and Crouch gasped for air, sputtering and shaking as he attempted to burrow further into the wall.
He swallowed thickly, the feeling of unfamiliar magic itching at his skin making him feel as though he needed to scratch. In a sudden, inexplicable action, Harry swiftly moved forward and pushed the stone out of the sun’s reach, making the feeling recede as the room fell back into its normal colors. They stood there in silence for a moment, before Harry silently shook his head.
“Well, we might have to cut you off at the knees, just so that your head doesn’t disappear into the clouds.” Harry nodded again, mostly just because he didn’t have much to say in response, before kicking off the wall and settling in step with his godfather. They were, hilariously, dressed rather similarly, though Harry’s normal leather jacket was a tad more form fitting than Sirius’ and had far more decals to it.
“Not now, Hadrian.” She muttered, before the noises of vomiting filled his ears again. Draco realized that it was probably the woman herself, before another bout of nausea washed over him and he screwed his eyes shut, groaning pitifully as Harry crouched down next to him, his other hand reaching down to brush the hair off of his sweaty brow.
Tom took a cautious step forward, bracing himself on one side of where the door had been to peer down into the blackness that was the connection. There was no difference between the empty space below or in front of him. There was no floor or ceiling or walls in sight. He stepped away, not wanting to fall in and see if there ended up being a floor after all, or if he would just fall forever through empty blackness.
This is a shorter but very important chapter, since it not only has the first Pansy POV (lets go lesbians!) but reveals the plot that will be following Theo through over the next few years!
It was quite simple really. She was at the lowest rung on the tree, as she was not a ‘true’ Parkinson and therefore didn’t have any chances of becoming the heir, even if both of her brothers were out of the running. Her youngest brother Carrick came next, as he was well respected in his chosen field as the owner of a moderately large potion ingredient producer and had a sizable income to match. That didn’t immediately mean that they were almost equals however, as he hardly considered her anything more than his mother’s mistake and ignored her every chance he got. Pansy was certain she hadn’t had more than three conversations with him over her life, and didn’t particularly want any more.
Perhaps she was responsible for Nicolas waking up early that morning. She seemed like the only one who would be sadistic enough to force him into this kind of… scenario.
it open. The door somehow didn’t break under the force he applied, managing to only creak painfully before making an ear-piercing booming sound as he slammed it into the wall. The man inside the small cell scrambled back, his eyes wide with terror as Harry stalked inward and grabbed him around the collar, lifting him up so that they were eye to eye. He didn’t know how he looked, didn’t particularly care either, but could tell that Crouch was terrified beyond terror.
Speedy French swam through the air around him as Perenelle and Fleur enthusiastically discussed what Draco assured him was mostly just potions-related academic study. Draco himself was sitting beside him on the couch still, making a point to slurp his tea obnoxiously in Gabrielle’s direction, the girl taking every instance possible to make rude faces and gestures in his direction as well. Harry watched it all distantly, feeling utterly separate from the chatter, and not only because of the language barrier that had been put up. He just felt… far away. He felt as if he were watching the party from the window. An outsider looking in.
He laughed, following behind Tom as the man led him down to the chamber. “So what’s the issue then?”
There was a great lurch, and for a moment he felt the memory begin to drift towards him from the aether before it was ripped back again and he was thrown backwards into a shelf, cursing as books rained down onto him. Scrambling to his feet, Tom watched with horror as the darkness surged forward and into his mindscape, attempting to grab for the books before he reacted and sent his own wave of magic towards it. Recoiling, the darkness slowly slunk back into the hole, fortifying and solidifying until it turned into something resembling a slowly moving wall of shadows.
The first is situated at the ministry, and is as clean and spotless as any high-ranking office at the ministry ever was. The walls are bare, with nothing but a single, imposing portrait of the man himself situated right behind his desk. When one enters, they would expect to find a spotless room with a spotless man sitting behind the spotless desk wearing a spotless sneer across his spotless face. It is the office that Lord Malfoy uses the least, though it is the one that all of his professional associates know the most. Anyone who works with or under the man, be it in investments-his favorite pastime-or in the Wizengamot, only saw Lord Malfoy in that hideously spotless office, and he preferred it that way. Spotless was blameless, after all.
away towards the carriages and their ghostly steeds. Blaise almost chased after him, before a large hand settled firmly on his shoulder.
He stood completely still, gaze locked onto the area of space directly between his old apprentice’s nose.
“The Favorite?” He still felt out of sorts after what had happened, a feeling of betrayal washing over him as the panic and shock began to subside. His grandfather had
“Tooommmyyyyyy~! Let me out of these chains, Tommy! Don’t let mean ol’ Tom boss you around anymore, alright Luv?”
He watched every twitch of his eye and clench of his jaw as he slowly, methodically, read through the letter. Harry’s bedroom was silent spare for the tapping of his shoes against the wooden floor and the distant noise of crickets outside his window, the darkened night sky giving no assurance that they would see the morning anytime soon. Harry almost wished that the morning would never come, because if that happened they would have to somehow return to their lives as if Draco’s wasn’t falling down around his ears.
More sobs broke out, this time from the Hufflepuff table. Luna also ignored them, eyes still pinned to the Slytherin table. Harry seemed to know something about that death as well, though she couldn’t help but turn away from him and towards another, less familiar soul. Blaise Zabini’s clouds of blue were in turmoil, spinning about like a tornado as the writhing green tendrils gripped them suddenly, spitting and hissing in a nearly serpentine way. Luna rather thought that the green of his soul was pleased with itself.
“Hello Mr. Lovegood, I’m so very sorry for dropping in an hour earlier than agreed.” His voice came out muffled due to his cheek still being pressed into the floor, but the man didn’t seem to mind, as he simply took the trunk from where it had landed on his back and placed it onto the floor where it belonged.
Tom fell into another coughing fit, curling over his stomach as he sporadically cursed about the sting in his eyes. Harry cautiously drew closer, his eyes suddenly focusing in on a stream of bright red blood flowing from Tom’s ear.
“Please enjoy yourself tomorrow Hadrian, for your own sake. Leave the worrying to me, please. I have the age needed to bear the brunt of it, and I desperately want to. For you, just this once.”
It didn’t take him long to find the man, but at that point Sirius was well and truly in the thick of it, merely handing several articles of clothing to him wordlessly before moving further along a wall of dress shirts. Harry rolled his eyes, feeling like a glorified coat hanger as he was handed a long turtleneck and two pairs of skinny jeans that looked so small that even Draco couldn’t manage to slip into them.
The room fell into silence. Oppressive, mind-melting silence. Harry sat back down on the couch, staring at the floor as the silence bore down on him, and as Draco slowly padded over to his side and sat down beside him, their arms and legs brushing and Draco’s head just barely resting on his shoulder. The silence seemed to soften the sharpness slightly, and Harry sighed softly, reaching over to grasp Draco’s hand. He squeezed it tightly, almost smiling as Draco squeezed back in return.
Harry, halfway up in his chair and preparing for an argument, suddenly stopped and stared at her. Her expression was confused, or perhaps contemplative, but her eyes were knowing. She had played him right into her hand.
let her make pivotal decisions on the structure of the home. In the end, the only windows that had been added to the manor during the original construction had only gone in because Duncan’s wife, who’s name had been long since lost to time-likely due to the mistress’s eternal ire-had insisted that each bedroom on the top two floors have at least one window. As it was, Duncan’s mistress had lived much longer than the forgotten Lady Nott, and had convinced Duncan to remove many of these windows as he increased in age. At least, that was what many were told, and it was what the grimoires and family documents stated. Theo always thought that there was a rather large likelihood that there hadn’t actually been a vampiric mistress, and that Duncan just had an obscene hatred for sunlight.
“Good morning, Hadrian! And happy birthday.” She replied, slowing to a stop before turning to look at him. They stared at each other for a few moments, before she smiled in a very gentle, concerned way. “Are you alright, dear?”
That had been precisely twelve minutes prior to the present, and now Harry was sat at the messy dining room table, tangled in two thick blankets and with a near-scalding cup of tea in his hand, as the two immortals stared at him with identical looks of scholarly fascination painted across their faces. He took a slow sip, savoring the subtle taste as Pernelle’s finger began to tap impatiently against the table. Neither of them had been considerate enough to explain how or why they had been in his room so early in the morning, but Harry could only assume that Nicolas had been wanting to start on the work for the day earlier than normal, and had decided to wake him. Either way, they had found him in a rather compromising position, that being ice cold and without a pulse. He wondered if they had noticed he wasn’t breathing first, then moved to touch him only to see how cold he was. Harry was certain that their first, and likely only, reaction was to use the elixir of life, which was clearly ineffective in the very least.
Riddle Manor was very different to how he remembered it being on his one and only trip to the place. The once white outer bricks were now stained a deep charcoal color, and had what appeared to be various accounts of muggle vandalism all across the town-facing walls. The years of disuse had not been kind to the once stunning estate, and Marvolo couldn’t help but gleefully contemplate what his disgraced father might think of that particular fact. It was, after all, his death that had made Marvolo into a horcrux, so perhaps the bitter irony that he was now here, with the intent of using the home as a base of operations until a more suitable estate was found, was slowly dawning on the dead man, wherever he may be.
Straightening, he cautiously moved away from the fortified door and towards the east wall, the circular entrance into Harry’s mind revealing itself quickly through the stacks of books. He quickened his pace, not wanting to leave the blatant breach in his mind alone for too long. Nearing the door, he let out a throaty hiss as it swung open, his intentions focused on waking Harry in the only way he knew would work now that the boy slept like the dead.
“This is your fear of death, then?” That was what the booklet detailed, at least. It was the fear-fueled ramblings of a soul that desperately wished to continue living despite the non-life that it existed in. The horcrux across from him clenched the tea cup in his hands tighter at Tom’s words, his face twisting from the infuriating calm that had been there through the entirety of their conversation into something more emotional. Something angry.
“What about his soulmate then? Do you really expect me to believe that Harry would ever hurt the Malfoy heir?”
Draco’s eyes didn’t hold the same heavy look of incomprehensible panic as before, but he could still see the uncertainty, the pain.
Harry watched dully as the Bulgarian Minister delivered his first English line of the day, sending Fudge into a familiar rant as the Irish team finally finished off their victory lap and entered the top box, the lot of them causing the place to go up in a tizzy again as they crowded around Fudge, who handed them the massive Quidditch World Cup trophy while leveling annoyed glares at the Bulgarian Minister.
He hadn’t quite known what to say to that, but had made an effort to keep the conversation onto common ground. Despite his efforts however, both of his companions seemed insistent on asking random, inconsequential things about the Flamel household. He could only assume that, having been a part of the French magical community for so long, that the pair had garnered a reputation not dissimilar to celebrities, or-from the peculiar looks Fleur was giving him-meer folk legends.
“Oh, what a delight! It's been a while since the gods gave me a name, you know. The last time was a year ago, actually. Almost exactly a year ago. This handsome young boy-I would tell you his name, but client confidentiality is very important to me-had a rancorous demon kicking around inside, and needed an equalizer to keep him steady. Poor lad looked all out of balance, so I sent him on his way without charging him a single knut. I do hope he managed to keep that thing under control, or at least didn’t have to use the equalizer that often. It does horrible things to the complexion, you know. Now, how are you, Theodore Nott? You look of better sorts than he did.” She prattled on, her hand still gripping his wrist as she led him over to a counter, on which sat countless strange artifacts and random stones, all laid out haphazardly and seemingly without cause.
Harry sighed slowly, fiddling with the long chain of his pocket watch as it continued to tick obnoxiously. It was just as loud as the girl it used to be. He smiled idly, caught daringly between amusement and hysterics as the ticking went on and on and
“Blast it all.” He had very little knowledge of this modern age, and while he was aware of himself growing more knowledgeable and powerful through the years, he had not personally been privy to any of the knowledge or memories that the younger horcruxes had formed. If he had managed to get the diadem on his side things might be different, but the horcrux inhibiting it was more of an obsessive scholar than a tyrant, his need for societal power temporarily having been abated through his search of physical and magical power. It was a damning step backwards, especially considering that it was very likely that the Failure was that much closer to absorbing the diadem horcrux and getting that much closer to achieving his self-sacrificial goals. If the Failure managed to get to the diadem, then it was only so much more time till he overpowered the maniacal locket and then he would be able to easily absorb the cup. Where would that leave Marvolo? Mostly likely in a stalemate in which he was both outgunned and the underdog. No, he needed to keep a low profile, keeping to the shadows as he formed a better idea of what resources he had available. Then, when he had every piece on the board exactly where he wanted it, only then would he strike.
She could ignore it for the summer, because they both deserved to keep this bubble of paradise for as long as possible.
“Yes, this is-have I said that it is wonderful to meet you, Mister Potter? Yes, it really is wonderful, I would love to set a time for us to meet more professionally, have you considered politics at all, Mister Potter? I’m sure you have. Might I ask, I hope I haven’t gone and gotten my dates mixed up, you are fourteen, are you not? Yes, well you seem to have grown beyond my expectatio-”
death is not one that can be toppled off his throne by something as simple as a revolution. Be careful, dear Favorite of our messenger, and try to decide if his rule is something that would save or destroy us all.”
The Wendigo was likely one of the more enjoyable drawings I've done recently, just because it is a lot different from what I usually do. I may really love writing gore, but it isn't very often in life that I find myself drawing anything actually
Harry looked down into his teacup, swirling the lukewarm liquid around as the leaves clumped up at the bottom. He stopped the movement, watching the whirlpool-like movement through the tea continued without his interference, before slowly crawling to a stop. The leaves swirled around indecipherably for a moment, before settling back to the bottom of the cup, motionless. Harry watched distantly as they settled, contemplating the last year of his life with steadily growing cynicism. He felt as if every action he had made embodied one of those tea leaves, and it was churning away in one big teacup, being thrown about a stormy sea.
Sorry for this being a day late, I got a stomach bug over the weekend so my updating schedule was pushed back a day.
Luna did know why she trusted Harry, but such an admittance would surely make issues for the both of them. Luna didn’t want to admit how she had her own sets of dreams to combat Theo’s. She didn’t want to tell him or her daddy how her broken eyes showed her far more than souls. She didn’t want to tell him how some days, she would turn around and suddenly see a woman with shockingly red hair and freckled skin, and how the woman’s eyes seemed right out of a familiar old dream that she didn’t want to remember. She didn’t tell her daddy about the woman, and she didn’t want to tell Theo about what the woman would whisper to her some nights, when it was just her and the moon outside to lead her through the darkness, and the bright cruel eyes would look down at her from a beautiful face and the woman would tell her things that Luna was absolutely certain no other human on the planet knew of.
Daphne fell silent. Even Draco didn’t seem to know what to say to that. Blaise, in direct contrast, felt rather giddy.
He stared up at the ceiling, body utterly drenched in sweat as adrenalin raced through him. Sucking in a sharp breath, he scrambled up into a sitting position, eyes wide and vulture-like as he looked around for any sort of danger. Draco didn’t know what woke him up from the nightmare, Harry’s emotions seeping through the bond or his own fear. Maybe it had been a mix of both.
Harry clenched his eyes shut, very nearly shouting with glee as he was yanked through space at an incredible speed. He clutched tightly to his trunk, wondering sparingly how Crouch was fairing before his attention was immediately pulled away by the sight of fireplaces and hearths screaming past his vision. It was incredible, really, how any sort of motion sickness he had gotten previously had all but vanished. Harry didn’t really know if it was because he didn’t have a functioning stomach or if it had some other explanation, but he was hardly going to complain about the change.
His screams of pain turned slowly into hair-raising cackles as the pain abidated and was replaced with
“And where are you off to?” She called, causing Blaise and Harry to both stop suddenly and turn to look at her. Harry blinked at the both of them blankly, as if he hadn’t been expecting anyone to call him out for going the wrong direction, before he sheepishly shrugged.
Seemingly sensing his gaze, the boy turned to look at him, face lit by candlelight and green eyes narrowed with blatant revulsion. Barty stumbled slightly, taken by surprise by the unfamiliar expression as it became unmistakable to him. Those eyes… they were similar,
Perenelle tilted her head, quizzical, as she removed one of her legs from underneath her in order to throw it over the arm of her wicker chair. The movement caught his eye, so blasé and without a care. He felt a lump in his throat for a reason he couldn’t discern, an envy that had no reason to exist. Harry wondered if he would ever experience life in the way that she did.
“Alright love, it’s alright. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to… well I don’t really know what I meant to do, but it wasn’t meant to upset you, I promise.”
“Do you reckon we should set up our tent first?” Harry questioned Perenelle, his hand still rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s back. The woman hummed, looking as though she was considering the thought for a moment before shrugging. Draco was about to interrupt that they most definitely
Luna opened her eyes, brilliant colors of light and magic erupting all around her. She sighed, a faint smile painted across her lips as she looked down to the blank piece of parchment, and with a steady hand, dipped her quill into the inkwell.
Barty felt whatever that had frozen him in place suddenly thaw, and in a daze he stumbled forward, body and mind and soul pulled towards those eyes of green upon green upon green. The shamble turned into a sprint near-instantly as a different green, a far more familiar, insidious green, lit up the air around him, illuminating that scarred face and sinful green eyes with its glow. He reached out, fingers grazing against death itself as he gripped tightly to the man’s shirt, practically collapsing as shock sent waves of adrenaline through him.
Nicolas willed his feet to start walking again, shortening the distance between them in a few quick strides. Not taking his eyes off of Albus’ face, he walked past the man and to the large door behind him, rapping against it thrice, and sat back to listen to the punctual echoes off the hard wood that the knocks had made.
He almost shouted out to the man, instinctively jolting back up again before stumbling back, the ear-piercing screams of the crowd around him returning as the familiar man disappeared out of the entranceway and the world swarmed forward to meet him once more. Barty threw his hands over his ears, eyes squeezed into slits as he stumbled forward on barely functioning legs, following after the large man on instinct as the crowd of rowdy onlookers shoved him one way to the next, not realizing that they were shoving nothing but air in their desperation to see the quidditch stars walking in the same doors the large man had just exited.
Draco rolled his eyes as Nicolas tripped over himself to articulate a reply, looking teasingly offended as Perenelle continued to laugh. looking away from the flirting pair, he immediately glanced up towards the vague direction of Harry’s bedroom window, his eyes seeking out the familiar form of his soulmate in the glass. He managed to spot it just as Harry walked past, nothing but an imposing blur of black in an already shadowy room.
It was a brooch. Or, more specifically, it was an incredibly beautiful, and obnoxiously expensive, brooch. It was likely pure silver, and was carved into an extremely ornate feather, which itself was embedded with small diamonds that covered the entire surface. The feather itself was carved so that it curved dramatically around the middle, creating the illusion of movement through the entire piece. For several moments, all Draco could do was turn it around and around and watch it glitter beautifully, his eyes blown wide and an invisible, primal force inside of him keping all of his attention on the glittering mass of diamonds and light. When he finally decided to tear his eyes away from it, he was overcome with a sense of dull confusion that overplayed the awe. Since when has he become so obsessive with jewelry of all things? Sure, he wore his fair share of rings and he still had in the matching earring that he and Harry had, but he had never been inclined to blatantly stare at something reflecting light so obsessively. Was this his inheritance growing stronger? Was that also why he had developed a need to climb around in trees all of the sudden?
The heart that was beating out of its chest was not his, it was Barty Crouch’s. It never was his, and never would be. The stinging across his knuckles was his though, and he could hold onto that for as long as he needed to.
“Barty? That’s… an interesting name,” she replied, her voice sounding slightly strained as she spoke. The quiet conversation between his lord and the unknown boy also ceased with his reply, and Barty had to force himself to stay still as those green eyes fixated on him once more. In a moment of acute foolishness, he looked upwards once again and held the gaze, caught halfway between terror and glee as his lord’s attention returned to him.
Heeeey... so I got food poisoning (salmonella) early last week, which is why I didn't update (I was too busy vomiting up my intestines) but I'm all better now and officially terrified of eggs. Anyway, I felt bad about all that, so I decided to change some things and take something from the next chapter to put into this one, as well as add some more depth to make the chapter longer and more interesting.
There was no one there in that hallway with him. He was alone. Tom wasn’t there. Hadn’t ever been anywhere but his mind. Harry stood stiff, staring at the spot that he had been
Draco looked between his two companions, letting go of the chain as his eyebrows furrowed. Perenelle nodded along to Harry’s words, also letting go of the chain as the awkwardly tall boy fiddled with it.
“Yes, Potter, distracting. What with the… hands.” His sarcastic response tapered off as Harry leaned forward, and without a single pause, landed a searingly cold kiss on Draco’s forehead. He froze, feeling more than seeing as Harry pulled away before pressing another kiss to Draco's temple. The contact sparked, crackling as their differences in temperature collided. Harry’s hands, still pressed into his cheeks, crackled and sizzled as well, though not in a painful way, he hoped. Harry certainly didn’t move, didn’t even flinch as their body temperatures fought an unending battle.
How. How! How was that even possible? It seemed that each potential situation he considered only led to the conclusion that it was an impossible crime. The only situation that made even the slightest amount of sense was if Lupin had indeed escaped his warded room and killed the girl, but Albus had been the one to free the man early that morning, there was no way that he was the killer!
She shook herself, turning to look at the girl walking next to her with concern. “I’m sorry about my brother Tracey. I don’t think Nigel ever really figured out the concept of manners.” The other girl nodded carefully, turning to look at her in a way that made Pansy think that they were both well aware that her oldest brother certainly would have remembered the etiquette lessons of his youth if Tracey was not who she was. Sadly for both of them, it seemed that her blood wouldn’t be changing anytime soon.
to never speak to me again if they don’t like something I’ve done. You, however, have to stick around no matter
Harry grit his teeth, staring at the warm oak shade of Draco’s bedroom door. Not yet? What kind of-?
“That’s completely different. For one, I didn’t go there just to spy on Daphne from the bushes like you.”
Luna stopped, breathing heavily as she stared down at a blank piece of parchment, quill poised in hand as she slowly sank into her chair.
Draco took a deep, shaky breath, before exhaling with a laugh and a few traitorous tears. Harry seemed to be having fun, which was certainly a good thing. Though Draco wished he could be there to actually see it, instead of just reading the likely extremely filtered version through the other boy’s letters. He could readily admit that the loneliness had gripped him many weeks ago and had refused to let go, and that he was suffering through it, if only just. Draco could admit, if only to himself, that he had been fantasizing about what it must be like there as a way of coping, and had been spending hours contemplating what Harry might be doing throughout the days. Draco had been allowing himself an unnecessarily large amount of time to contemplate what Harry must look like down in the alchemy lab that he had described in his past letters, with his arms free of their usual long sleeves and the heat from melting metals causing sweat to drip from his brow. He couldn’t still be wearing that leather jacket, could he? Certainly not in the sweltering weather and certainly not around a burning furnace. Does he wear that one white muggle ‘tank top’ with the thin straps that were sure to show his shoulders and curve of his spine through the thin material? Or does he forgo a shirt altogether? Does he wear those black slacks that he always insisted on or something lighter? What was he wearing to bed-?
that Lupin was innocent, but all other attempts to come up with a reasonable explanation for the death resulted in such an absurd thought train that any other explanation was utterly absurd. It was an inescapable scenario for him, in which no matter what he said, there were only two options: either Lupin be convicted for a murder that he did not commit, or for Albus officially come forward and explain why Lupin had to be innocent. Even worse, since he himself was the one who had freed Lupin that morning, if he were to try and do the second choice, it was all too likely that people would start to doubt if he was not somehow directly involved in the death as well.
As I said last chapter, I want to get caught back up on the chapters I hadn't been able to post in the past three weeks, so I'll be updating daily until we reach chapter 10, and then we will be returning to weekly chapters until I get a summer job and my schedule is more certain.
“You know, one wrong updraft and that smog could destroy the entire forest.” He remarked idly, ripping off his overshirt as the sticky potion concentrated on it. Scratching at his less-damp tank top underneath, he threw the overshirt into the nearby fire, watching as it crackled and sizzled angrily for a moment before the potion and smoke residue started burning off into harmless ash.
Perhaps the heat wave was starting to dry up all the ponds and lakes and they were all turning into puddles under its heat.
“Won’t Harry still be in France on the third?” Luna finally questioned, seeming flippant about the whole thing. Theo worked his jaw for a moment, before finally nodding.
It was obvious that she was stalling. The international floo connection would be open in no less than ten minutes, and would stay open for no longer than five. If he had been counting the seconds accurately, then his father would be leaving for the convention a mere hour after the fact. It was painfully obvious that she was trying to keep him firmly in place for as long as she could, though he couldn’t bring himself to be more than passingly annoyed about it. Draco didn’t want his mother to be distressed by any means, and wanted her to be happy and comfortable at every second of the day, but really, this was hardly grounds to be so stiflingly clingy.
It was a precise shade of green, the shade of green that was embodied in Harry’s eyes. It was a shade of green that he utterly adored, a familiar one interwoven with speckles of gold and, as he had noticed in the past week, now laced with shocking lightning bolts of deep, blood red. He didn’t understand the development of the red bolts exactly, or why they had appeared all of the sudden, but he hadn’t thought to bring it up because, well, Harry had never made any mention of them, and seemed just the same as always. Now though, those shocking lightning bolts of deep, blood-red stood out like a splash of red paint on a white wall.
“I suppose it would be fun to meet your other friends.” Luna’s calm voice broke him from the thought, and he glanced away from the smiling faces of the portraits towards the girl, who was pouring bright yellow wax out onto the letter. “I’m sure Mr. Zabini would be fun to meet, if I ignored the fight in his core.”
No sane human, no matter how angry they were-no matter what sort of inheritances they had that might change them biologically-would be able to do that to someone else and live with themselves afterward. He wouldn’t excuse Harry for mutilating that poor girl to the point that the body was nothing but torn meat and bones, and he wouldn’t be backing down from his position, no matter what Luna or anyone else had to say on the matter.
been the right thing to ask, as Draco jolted up with a start, eyes wide and furious as Harry’s own eyes creaked open, his gaze icy as he leveled a silent glare in Blaise's direction. Blaise blinked, momentarily taken aback before he groaned with exhaustion.
Marvolo gazed out at the rising sun, frowning as he walked farther and farther away from the hovell that he had been confined to for decades. He would not be so foolish to go after the soul shard or Hadrian Potter before he had gained back any followers that the man had left for dead, which was sure to take time and energy that was unavailable to him in his current situation.
Where had the god gone off to? Was he just biding his time until Blaise got to a certain age or was there something more going on? Was Blaise faking his ease and was he actually suffering?
“Of course, Favorite. You aren’t misplacing anything.” Hummed Xenophilius, the man’s tone carrying with a certain dry lift that made Theo think the man was simply humoring him. Stopping short, Theo closed his eyes, breathing in sharply in a wasted effort to calm himself.
“This is getting me nowhere.” He stood back from the shelf, letting it disappear into the darkness as he began to walk a well-traveled path towards the entrance into the library. He knew that even more research wouldn’t help him with the issue of Harry, but the action in itself at least made him feel a bit better about his powerlessness in the situation.
Harry winced, reaching out to take the outstretched hand in a companionable shake. He had seen himself growing steadily over the past few weeks after eating Ginny, to the point that he had been magically lengthening his pants each day so his ankles wouldn’t show through. He was a tad bit scared to get out a tape measure and see if Sirius’ guess held any water, but nodded sheepishly anyway.
new things, if they weren’t an issue last night.” She remarked, almost teasingly. Harry smiled softly, letting his head fall forwards again so he could level an exasperated look at her.
the ever-impassable fortress of passivity that he was, in this way, Draco was certain that it couldn’t be good. With a jerk, he took a step inside the kitchen, eyes locked onto the stiff form of his soulmate as his heartbeat drummed through his ears. He felt something clawing at the inside of his chest, hot and furious as Harry nervously fiddled with the handle of a teacup.
The troubling occurrences in such an office aside, Lord Lucius Malfoy was rather proud of all three of his offices, though in regards to the second he held a far more smug sort of pride, one of a man who was in an extremely satisfying marriage with an extremely capable and… flexible woman. However, one thing that he had overlooked about the last of his offices, was the fact of lineage that it carries. You see, dear reader, Lucius Malfoy is not the first Malfoy lord to take up that exact office as his own, and it indeed has a bit of a lineage issue behind it. The Lord Malfoy before Lucius, that being his father Abraxas, also took up the office as his own, and his father before him and on and on until you go so far back that Malfoy Manor hadn’t even been built yet.
Harry stared out the window, watching as a few hummingbirds zipped to and fro from one flower to the next, sucking up all the nectar they possibly could from the garden. The sun was just barely rising from above the treeline, and the sounds of morning and life were slowly overtaking the whispers of the night. Harry watched it all with growing detachment, eyes trained on the hummingbirds as they whizzed from one flower to the next.
speak that name in my presence. Do you understand me Theodore?” The older man towered menacingly above him, his gloved hand still held up-as if he was preparing to strike again. Their eyes met, and Theo slowly lowered his own hand, the stinging in his cheek overshadowed by the calm rage creeping up from his stomach.
I did take some liberties with the Veela's coloring with this drawing, because it's really supposed to be all white, but I was struggling to make that look cool so I decided to emulate a falcon's coloring instead, just to add some texture. To be completely honest I really like it. (I used to know how to draw wings really well but that was in the 6th grade and I'm a senior in high school now, please forgive me for the shitty uneven feathers that look like they're one bad brushstroke away from looking kinda like dicks).
The man took a sip of his tea, before setting the cup back down on the table between them. Tom watched the motion with narrowed eyes, unease trickling down his throat. “Now, I do believe that this conversation has veered off of the beaten path, so let's get back to the discussion of our own soul, hm?”
There was a murmured hush, and within seconds the entire great hall had gone startlingly silent. Luna stilled, eyes skating over to Harry despite her gentle thoughts against it. His soul was darting about more erratically than usual, as if waiting impatiently for something. Luna couldn’t help but feel that he was thinking of something completely different from the three student deaths the year before.
did he say to you, Harry?” Draco hissed, his fingers digging deep, biting pale crescents into Harry’s hand as his lengthening nails sank into Harry’s skin. Harry shut his mouth with a click, suddenly without words as Draco looked at him with
“-that sounds about right, I had always thought that Durmstrang would be an opposite of Hogwarts, instead of being balanced like Beauxbatons.” Harry’s voice broke him from the thought, his feet moving on their own as he started getting pulled along towards the stadium, Krum falling in foot beside Harry, nodding along and smiling as if they had been friends for years. Draco grumbled, and tightened his hold on Harry’s hand.
“Lucius darling, do you know anyone who might write your father a letter?” She read over the name Abraxas Malfoy a third time, turning to look as her husband shakily stood. “Lucius? Are you quite alright?”
Draco shook his head, staring up at him with a familiar mix of affection and annoyance. Harry couldn’t help but smile at the expression.
The problem arises, as it always seems to do, when rather unsavory people rise from the dead and decide to write letters to their equally dead friends.
The door came crashing down between them, silencing Tom along with his worried shouts. He would deal with the man later, when his mind wasn’t overflowing with other issues and he could actually
He narrowed his eyes, finding himself torn between annoyed and grateful that the situation wasn’t in the real world, or they would likely have a few issues.
Theodore, and Xenophilius is the most crazed of the bunch. Everyone knew the Lovegood name was doomed once he married that suicidal madwoman-what was her name, Pandora?”
Theo sighed, waving Blaise’s letter around haphazardly through the air as Luna carefully picked up the glitter-soaked letter and folded it up, where it was then unceremoniously shoved into an unassuming envelope. “Blaise-one of my friends that you haven’t met yet-invited me to go school shopping with him, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis, and said you’re welcome to come along. Do you want to? You’re father...
He mused, skipping up the stairs quickly as Luna’s voice started to become audible. He faltered for a moment, straining his ears to hear what she was saying without any luck. He stood cautiously for a moment, before starting towards the room with near-silent footfalls. Nearing the door, he slowed to a stop outside of it, knocking cautiously as he realized that the noises he was hearing was the girl
Blaise nodded enthusiastically in agreement, sparing his sleeping friend another confused glance before he settled onto the seat across from the pair. Harry had… well, calling it a growth spurt felt like understating it. Harry had to have gained nearly three stones in pure muscle over the summer, and a good foot or so in height by the look of it. Blaise didn’t know how to even react to the change, so used to seeing his friend as a tall and almost
For a moment, Harry wondered how the twins were fairing, before letting the thought fall away as he settled down in the chair Draco had shoved him towards, eyes trailing up and towards the seating opposite of them.
“I… I like it, yes but-but Tom I don’t like these chains. You know I love to move around and-and it really isn’t fair to do something like this to your brother, you know that, right?”
Harry bit the inside of his cheek in an effort not to hold the phial of blood any closer to his nose, pointedly handing it back to the man as soon as he was willing to take it while making a ‘ah’ noise.
It had been an idea that he had brought up months before-during yule, or at least sometime near it-and it had taken months of patent prodding over letters and long winded reasonings for his grandfather to eventually agree that it might be healthy for him to spend the summer in a place with a little more life to it. Of course, it had taken quite a bit longer for Theo to convince him that the Lovegood household would be the most lively place for him to go, but the man had eventually allowed it on the condition that Theo stay the first week at home first. He still thought that the old man wasn’t happy about the arrangement, as he had been rather frosty towards Theo over the past week, but he didn’t care. They had already decided and made the proper plans after all, and nothing that his grandfather ever said would manage to change his mind.
With a start, Luna practically leaped out of her bed and ran to her desk, shuffling around for a quill and parchment. She had to write to Harry, or the woman was sure to be back soon, but about what? She could ask how he was doing, maybe, or see if he wanted her to come visit for his birthday next week. Sure, the international floo expenses would be grievous, but perhaps her daddy could manage to get them a discount?
Standing there silently, watching the two strangers and his lord stand there, waiting for the seconds to drag on towards an unknowable future, Barty got the forceful urge to move forward, to disrupt the chanting and take hold of his lord’s arm, to turn the man away from the two unknown people and get a first good look at his master’s face for the first time since his imprisonment. With a jolt, he started towards the trio, his steps panicked and forceful as the woman continued on, her idyllic chants broken unceremoniously by a shriek rising up behind him.
The point being, those who were so unfortunately out of the loop about the most recent passings of great lords in Britain, might be so untoward as to send the late Abraxas Malfoy some post through the owl mail, and poor Lucius Malfoy might be so unfortunate to be the one it is delivered to instead of his beloved father. Of course, in most instances this is not so troubling, as Abraxas Malfoy had a selection of...
“I can see you are confused, yes?” He nodded, eyebrows furrowed in thought as Nicolas set the jar back down next to its now identical counterpart. “I understand how you would be, but I assure you that that is no ordinary blood. In fact, it is now quite dangerous to attempt to find in this day and age.”
He turned away as the butterfly settled onto his desk, wings slowly opening and closing as he tapped his foot anxiously against the hardwood below him. He had also, through some tricky guesswork with his stolen time-turner—which he had gotten Blaise to mail back to him, since he had left it in the other boy’s care before the school year ended—had managed to
Tom sighed with relief, his forehead thunking silently against the cold iron as he rested his entire weight against it, feeling utterly expended. He had tried to shut the door on his own, truly he had, but it was quite difficult to manage when one was as preoccupied as he had been. He could have been able to manage it early on in the day if it had not been for all the magic he had been using just to keep himself alive, but after hours of fighting there had been absolutely no hope of closing it himself. It had, quite frankly, been a feat in itself for him to have managed to speak with Harry at all, considering what all had happened, and even more remarkable that he had managed to keep his voice so level while nearly getting mauled.
“Oh my, and who might you belong to?” Xenophilius muttered, pulling Theo from his thoughts as the unmistakable sound of a window opening filled the empty space that his halted pacing had left. At the window was a familiar eagle owl, its distinct orange coloring matching the bizarre decor around it surprisingly well. In its beak was a single letter, signed with nothing but the initials B.Z. in a familiar jagged handwriting.
“No offense,” he started, causing the both of them to look his way. “-but why the hell would you make a priceless artifact like that into a portkey?”
Her eyes followed the group as they meandered over to the Slytherin table, missing a particularly important piece to their puzzle that Luna couldn’t help but notice.
The tar-like substance writhed and shook, before it suddenly went limp in the container, and began to shrink. Nicolas grasped another tube of unknowable formula, which was instead clear like water, and dripped a single drop of it onto the blackened, shrinking form.
“Didn’t see you over Christmas.” Harry tries to make his voice sound casual. “Did you go back with your Mum in the end?”
The cupboard under the stairs in Grimmauld Place is different to the cupboard under the stairs in Privet Drive.
Harry peered into the water next to him, and the water stayed still, barely rippling despite the January breeze. He was reminded of the eerie silence in the Forbidden Forest on Christmas Eve, as if even the animals knew that something terrible had happened.
Draco flexes his toes in Harry’s lap. Neither of them were the best at dealing with feelings; they hadn’t said the L-word yet.
Predictably, Malfoy doesn’t answer. He turns away from Harry and lies flat on his back, fingers entwined on his chest, over what Harry knows is scarred flesh. Harry wonders if it still hurts.
Harry doesn’t argue, but he doesn't continue talking either, instead just stares at the fire as the flames begin to dwindle. Malfoy likely doesn’t notice; his eyes are still shut and he was breathing evenly. Harry’s certain that he’s asleep, or would make a very good actor.
Hogwarts has been such a constant in his life ever since he found out about the Wizarding World that he almost can’t imagine not boarding the train every year. It’s an oddly scary thought, that the last year is flying by as fast as a snitch, and neither of them have long left.
Draco’s pulling papers from the mess on his desk, however Harry’s not sure if he’s actually doing anything. He keeps his back to Harry, and it hurts, because Harry knows it’s a dismissal.
“Draco?” Harry tries. The name is uncomfortable on his tongue, the vowels and consonants sounding forming something that felt wrong, but Harry doesn’t care.
Because there, at the other end of the aisle, Harry is certain he can see Vernon Dursley. He’s not looking at Harry, hasn’t noticed them. Yet.
He pulls on the new jumper Molly had knitted him for Christmas, tucks the map under his pillow and then trudges down the cold stone steps. He spots Malfoy immediately, in the small room it was impossible not to.
Harry pauses, one hand on the handle, and watches Draco scribble on a bit of parchment, and it looks just like that, scribbles.
“It’s this way.” Malfoy turns in the opposite direction to the one Harry was about to step foot in. Harry follows Malfoy out, and catches him when he stumbles. For someone who knows the forest, who used to be so graceful, he’s surprisingly clumsy. They are both silent on their way out, but at least when they’re moving it’s bearable.
Done nothing. There was nothing he could have done to prevent Draco from doing it that first time. But even so, the thought that somehow so many other people knew and he didn’t infuriated him.
Malfoy snorts then, discarding his book on the arm of his chair, his face twisting into a familiar sneer, and it’s like Harry’s gone back in time.
“But I can feel it. Something awful is going to happen to me. I felt it at the end of fifth year, and then at the start of sixth. And I knew when you followed me into that bathroom something awful was going to happen - I thought I was going to die then - do you know I was almost relieved? I don’t want to die - but I wanted to stop existing that year. And I can’t even blame anyone else.”
Gentle was not a word Harry ever thought he’d use to describe Draco Malfoy, but his touch is soft, and runs his fingers across the scar on the back of Harry’s hand.
It’s a blatant attempt to change the subject as Harry’s ever heard, but he’s suddenly not in the mood to press. Hermione wouldn’t be likely to tell him, and if he badgered her about it she’d only feel guilty about it. Even so, it makes him feel left out, that Hermione’s keeping Malfoy’s secrets.
“Do as he says,” She says calmly over the sound of Draco’s hysteria. She gently manhandles him from the room, and even after the door has clicked shut Harry can hear crying.
Draco shakes his head, looking awkward and out of place in his own bedroom. He wrings his white hands together. “You alright?”
“No, it’s not. I think that maybe some of my teachers in primary school may have suspected, but they had this perfect middle class family in a suburban paradise image. They told other people that I was just badly behaved, that I was a problem child. I was for them.”
“Want to come?” Harry knows the answer before Malfoy has even opened his mouth, but he hopes he’s wrong. He’s not.
Malfoy doesn’t move when Harry steps towards him. He doesn’t know he’s there, Harry realises, doesn’t realise that he’s been found.
“Okay.  Are you… Do you need anything? Tea? One of those Chinese take-aways from that muggle place? A tub of my ice cream?”
“Liar.” He mutters, clear enough for Harry to hear. There is only a sliver of the usual bite in it.  “I just like the quiet, that’s all.”
But still, irrational as the thought was, Harry couldn’t stop his mind from thinking about it. What if they had succeeded in hiding his magic from him, and had just kept him in the cupboard like some human house elf forever? What if he had never been magical, and they were cruel for the sake of cruelty? What if he saw Vernon again, and he raised his hand to him?
Malfoy’s up to something, Harry thinks to himself as he watches through the frosted window as a waif-like figure with striking white-blond hair disappears into the Forbidden Forest. It’s just before breakfast, and it’s the second week of the Christmas Holidays, just a day before the twenty-fifth.
Harry wishes he had a piece of string now. It's becoming more and more tempting to turn and run back in the way he’s certain he came. It suddenly seems ridiculous, running into the Forbidden Forest half dressed in December.
Harry watches Malfoy’s throat bob as he swallows heavily, and then brings a hand up to his mouth, his other arm curling around his stomach. “Oh,” He mumbles. “She never… never mentioned that.”
“Sorry, you were saying?” He says, shovelling too much food into his mouth. Hermione raises an eyebrow at him, and he gives her an apologetic look while trying not to choke. She leans towards him and starts whispering.
Harry wakes, cocooned in a nest of warm blankets, and blinks at the darkness that surrounds him. He looks to the wall, certain that he should at least see a slither of pale moonlight, or the gentle flutter of curtains, but he can see even without his glasses that the wall is smooth.
I'm not sure exactly how long this is going to be but I'm thinking around 20k, as I'm writing the last chapter for it now.
“I’m sick in the head. I think I always have been. I’m not… there’s something not right in me. It was alright before, because I didn’t care, but I know there’s something wrong with me. It’s always been
Malfoy is curled up in an armchair by the fireplace, his hair unusually tousled, and clad in a pair of pyjamas and a dressing down, his socked feet tucked under him, a box of matches on the arm. Harry hears the soft flick of a page, but can’t make out what he’s reading.
“Yeah. And my Aunt Petunia and my Uncle Vernon. They weren’t…” Harry lost the words. He swallows, mouth dry as a desert.
It was a stupid idea in itself. Vernon was a cruel man, but he was no child snatcher, and he certainly wasn’t going to abduct Harry and lock him in another cupboard.
flickers out as soon as he shuts Draco’s door, but on his way back to his room the darkness doesn’t bother Harry one bit.
Harry reaches the tree in three short strides, and when he sees Malfoy, he wonders how he ever thought the boy was up to anything at all.
Good. Harry doesn’t feel like talking to her right now. He still can’t figure out how she had known immediately after the holidays, and it took him months to figure out, but he feels like he won’t know unless he asks her. And he won’t. Not yet.
Vernon Dursley is out there somewhere, Petunia too, somewhere close to Harry, and there isn’t a thing he can do about it.
Harry had never truly been scared of the Dursley’s when he was living with him. Oh, there had been times that he had been frightened, times when he wished he could become invisible or run away, but truthfully, Harry had grown used to the way they treated him. Try as he might, he could not remember his parents when he was small, and even now he only had a few fleeting memories of them, most of them given to him by other people.
Harry feels empty. He’s an Auror, striving for justice is something he does, and has done since the war, but there is nothing to be done this time. There’s nothing he can do but just sit there, and dwell in his childhood.
Draco shrugs. “Dunno. Poppy gave me something. I had lots of expensive plates too. I can probably find a teacup plate to match your teacup so it wouldn’t be out of place, I can’t stand it when things are out of place. I hate the other teachers watching me, and the bratty first years who clearly all think I’m about to fling myself down the stairs or start throwing about Avada Kedavra. Which is funny because I don’t have a wand and was never able to cast one anyway.” He gives a little hysterical laugh.
would be the honest answer but, for all Harry’s social awkwardness, even he knows that that wouldn’t go over well.
The Slytherin, along with the Ravenclaw that wasn’t now groaning at Harry’s feet, is nowhere to be seen. Clever lads.
And Harry knows that someone has given him that bruise, that someone has hit him, and he also knows that Malfoy won’t willingly tell him who it was. Him and Malfoy have gotten into their fair share of physical spats, but this was different. Malfoy, wandless with his thin frame, was as good as defenceless. It was why Harry unconsciously took to keeping an eye on him at the start of the year, why he looked for him out of the corner of his eye without himself realising weeks into the term. And when he had realised, he didn’t exactly stop, but he tried to tone it down a bit.
Hermione’s gaze flickers to Malfoy again, and then quickly back to her book. She plasters on a fake smile. “Did I tell you about this? It used to be my favourite when I was little, and my parents remembered! This is a new edition.”
They walk out of the Great Hall together, and as they pass through the grand doors Draco’s hand brushes across his elbows, as if the Slytherin is checking that he’s still there. The featherlight touch sends a tingle up his arm, and he has a stupid grin on his face as he leads Draco out of the stone building and onto the school grounds.
once to relight the fire, and glances at the box of matches on the arm of Malfoy’s chair. Harry hadn’t even thought about it, but of course Malfoy didn’t have a wand to light the fire. He didn’t even want to think about what that must be like for Malfoy; Harry had known a life without magic. Malfoy had made his entire identity of being a wizard and a Malfoy, and then he had lost that. With Malfoy senior in Azkaban, the remaining two Malfoy’s had been disgraced, Draco lost his wand and Narcissa was on house arrest for the foreseeable future.
It’s said so quietly that Harry almost misses it over the sound of the flames. One of Malfoy’s bony hands snakes up to tug at his hair. Harry wonders about that some more.
(A very lewd image of Draco shirtless, his pink lips pouting, and his long fingers beckoning Harry over, suddenly thrusts itself to the forefront of his mind, and in the dark Harry flushes and shoves the image back behind a locked door in his head)
It also has the slight musty smell that many old lived-in houses have. Unlike Privet Drive, a gentle flow of magic washes through the house, and when he curls down in the cupboard its warmth envelopes him like a blanket.
He tosses his wand on the desk in frustration and leans his head on his hand. It’s hopeless today - he may as well just go back to bed.
Draco fiddles with his blankets some more, and it’s Harry’s turn to get the hint. “If you don’t want me to stay, I can go? You don’t have to invite me in out of politeness.”
A magical letter then, since it didn’t have his full address, but one sent by a trusted owl, since it knew where it was going. He glances down at the small scrawl at the bottom corner of the envelope.
“She’s taken a year out. I think she wanted to get away from it all, after,” Harry’s throat went dry, “Fred. I don’t think she could stand coming back here straight away.”
“Hey, McGonagall said that something happened with Malfoy,” Ron starts, and Harry thinks that’s not the half of it. “Hermione’s not very well, she would have come with you otherwise.”
Waiting in that empty white corridor with the white floors and the white walls and the white ceiling, Harry becomes hollowed out. He’s legs are weak, and he doesn’t think he’ll be able to stand even if he tries, and he just stares blankly at nothing.
Draco’s eyes are unfocused again, staring past Harry, and he gasps and rolls over, his thin back facing Harry.
“I don’t know. It’s just easier for me to think. I know you hate the dark, but it’s sort of comforting. It shouldn’t be, it’s weird and stupid that I find comfort in something like that, but… I just sort of
Harry interrupts her before she can get the wrong idea. “No! No, it’s nothing like that. It’s just, when you were away we, uh, talked. Sort of. And then I didn’t see him until now. He probably just went home to his mum, but when we talked he seemed a bit, um, doesn’t matter really. I just was sort of worried about him, I suppose.”
“Does this have to do with that man in the Tescos yesterday?” Draco asks. Harry swallows again around the lump in his throat, and his vision blurs.
It’s the early hours of the morning when he jerks awake with a sharp intake of breath, the image of Vernon Dursley, red-faced and spitting with fury crystallized in the forefront of his mind. The sweat-soaked sheets are choking him, and he stumbles from the bed, almost collapsing to the floor.
A couple of first years bump into him, and then gasp when they realise who he is. One of them, a girl with curly hair in pigtails whispers: “Wow, it’s Harry Potter!”
Time had passed almost normally (or as normal as it got for Harry) after that. He kept a close eye out for Vernon, and sometimes felt like he was being watched, but as he never saw the man again he put it down to paranoia. He went back to that same Tescos, this time Draco dragging him along, but although he kept a sharp eye out the whole time, he didn’t catch sight of Dursley.
Another nightmare wakes him in the early hours of the morning, leaving him gasping under sweat-soaked sheets. Through his window all Harry can see is a black sky stretching on for miles, but he knows he won't go back to sleep. Like most of his sleepless nights, he opens up the map once he has his breath back. And to his surprise he finds Malfoy not in his room, but in the common area shared by the Eighth Years. He’s alone, and Harry’s grateful for it.
“When I was small…” Harry starts, and then stops. He didn’t know which words were right in a situation like this, did he only tell Draco the gist of it, or did he unload everything from his god awful childhood at once? How could he even form the words for something like this?
“No! I want you to stay. It’s just… You don’t have to sit over there. You’re tired, we can swap if you want. I was reading, I won’t sleep tonight.”
Despite the nightmares that chased Harry down to the common room in the first place, Harry finds that their talks are often the best part of most days.
There is no sign of the other boy at breakfast. Harry isn’t particularly worried about his absence. He knew from his…
He stands for a moment more, getting his bearings before deciding which way to head in. It is as he is doing so when he hears a soft sound, like a heave of a heavy breath. It’s only for a moment, and then an unnatural silence fills the air around him.
Draco is pinned into a chair, hands bound behind him, a sharp line of red running across forehead, blood slowly dripping down his face, some of it running into his eye. He only vaguely recognises the boys, one is Gryffindor, two are Ravenclaw and one is a Slytherin. Draco looks wildly between them, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.
He stumbles over to Draco’s bed, and Draco makes room for him and then tucks the covers up to their shoulders. There’s a moment after when he just stares silently at Harry, before he blinks and picks up his book.
Harry’s fine with those terms, in fact he’s glad of them. Unlike Draco, Harry likes the idea of someone else between him and the end of the bed.
And then there was the matter of him and Ginny. Harry had loved her, he really had. But after the Killing Curse ripped through him and his body survived, he felt like something had sliced him open and hollowed him out, and all that was left was a dreary, morbid being in the shape of a boy. Ginny had been waiting for him, but she would not wait forever, and Harry just didn’t think he could marry her.
Draco flinches at the name, and then a full-body shudder passes through him as he wakes properly. He stares at Harry’s wand, still casting
“Well. I was going to say that even my father wouldn’t have done such a thing, but he probably would have.”
Harry half-sits, half-collapses into Draco’s desk chair. There’s ink-stained parchments spread across the wood. He doubles over until he can breathe again, and suddenly there’s a glass in front of his face. Harry takes it and gulps it down gratefully. He places it on an unused coaster when he’s done.
Draco flexes his long fingers. “It’s fine. I didn’t say it last night before I - Thanks. That was… Kind of you. And that was quite powerful magic.” He says the last part almost like an afterthought.
Draco comes to a sudden stop in the frozen aisle, his trolley neatly parked next to him. He has his hands on his hips and is staring determinedly down at the tubs of ice cream inside the freezer. What exactly he was determined to do, Harry isn't sure, but he knew that face when he saw it. Harry joins him, and slips his hand into his.
“So it’s illegal amongst muggles? Your muggle Aurors, wouldn’t they… couldn’t they arrest him?” Draco’s brows are furrowed in confusion.
Vernon had caught a glimpse of what Harry could do, and it had probably scared him off for good. Good riddance. Though, a small part of him couldn’t help but wonder what would have happened if he saw Vernon again. But it was such a small part of him that he could live without knowing.
Harry nods, his nose bumping against Draco’s pyjama-clad shoulder.  Draco slips a bookmark between the pages and then flicks to the beginning.
Harry nods, not even feigning denial. “I wish you wouldn’t. Everyone’s staring at me and pretending they aren’t. At least Poppy’s honest about why she keeps calling me to her office.”
And then there’s a flash of lightning that lights up the sky, and Draco jumps, and ducks his head to rest under Harry’s chin. Which was, in all likely, what he was going to do anyway. The bolt of lightning, surely, had nothing to do with where Draco’s head rests. No matter the strangely titillating images that flit through his mind. Harry must be going mad, he thinks.
His side profile is much the same as Harry remembers, huge and mean-looking, except now his hair has more shades of grey than brown. He has the same pudgy fingers, and is now using them to shift through boxes of frozen ready meals instead of balling them into fists aimed at Harry’s head.
Harry stares at him blankly, the words washing over him like a gentle wave washing over soaked sand. Ron pulls him close, and Harry rests his head on his shoulder, and crumples.
The rest of the holidays he waits to see a head of white-blond hair flit past him, but it never happens. He spends hours watching the entrance to the forest before he accepts that Malfoy has probably just gone home.
Draco moans around a whimper. Harry feels sick, and it has nothing to do with the smell seeping up from his robes. Madam Pomfrey was like an immovable rock, she had seen it all in her service to the Hogwarts students, and seeing her so frantic makes him want to ask desperately, if Draco Malfoy is actually in
The rest of the morning passes in a blur. Harry isn’t even sure how he gets to each class, but somehow at lunchtime he ends up alone in the entrance to the Great Hall. He does remember Hermione telling him to go to lunch without her, and still Harry isn’t sure what he’s done wrong, but she disappears before he can gather the energy to call out to her.
Draco’s room is at the very end of the corridor. The other rooms are clustered together, the doors next to each other, but it seemed like Draco’s room was added on as an afterthought, secluded and isolated from the other students.
Blinking away the tears, he finally got a good look at the door as Tom started to speak. “Because the horcrux and I have the same magic, taking down the physical and magical wards that I place on the door is easy enough for it. That’s why I need your help.” He took the hand off Harry’s shoulder, using it to rub the water out of his own eyes as he continued. “If we combine our efforts it will be much easier to keep him out for long stretches, and we might even manage a permanent solution if given enough time.”
“Bloody-” he let out a low groan of pain, unused to feeling anything physical at all, much less pain itself. The only thing that could injure him in his own mind was himself. How was this doing him in? “What is
She frowned at him, trying to come up with a better way to put her thoughts into her own mouth so that he might understand her in a planer way. “Theo, do you know what it is called when you see only the surface and nothing below that, and you refuse to try to understand any further depth than what you want to see? Do you know what that is called?”
Not nearly enough, it seemed, though Harry wasn’t about to admit something like that. Draco didn’t seem to believe his half-hearted attempt anyway, and sighed, before pulling the curtains around the large window shut and bathing the compartment in darkness.
Nicolas nodded, turning from his notes to level a stern look at Harry. “Remember this, Hadrian. Never try to correct for the unknown. Instead, expect the impossible and branch off from there. If I have learned anything, it is that the universe has a very funny way of making things happen, regardless of if you want them to or not. If it has happened once, more than likely it will happen again.”
The diadem horcrux looked at him warily, his eyes dimming in what Tom thought might be unease, or perhaps it was just a trick of the light. “Do you truly care that little for humanity?”
“Oh dear, you’re right. Where does it hurt, sir?” She questioned him gently, poking and prodding at different parts of his arm with skilled, nimble fingers. “Side-along portkeying is a horrible idea, you know. Have you dislocated anything?”
Voices quickly came back over him again, arguably louder than before, but he was gloriously saved from it all, held back and away from his senses by his mind as it worked furiously to hide away from the unfamiliar scenery. He couldn’t focus on anything. His ears were dulling, the voices and noises falling away into low, muffled background noise. His eyes stayed unfocused and indistinct and he couldn’t help but watch with idle enjoyment as blurs of quidditch players flew past. His eyes were focused on the vague place in front of him, not the players, but he could still make sense of what they were doing. It was strange, he could tell. The scope of his vision—the way that his eyes were taking in the world around him—it felt unfamiliar to how he had been allowed to see for the past decade. It felt almost... fallible.
The last week of summer had passed by so fast that he barely had the time to comprehend it all, the vast majority of his focus instead set on wrapping up the last of his alchemy training despite the seemingly thousands of tiny little things that he had to deal with alongside it. And he had done it—completed the training that is—if only barely, and Nicolas had tearfully exclaimed that Harry was now perfectly capable of creating and managing a philosopher’s stone of his own. All he had to do now was forage the ingredients.
A shift in the air made him whoop, and he opened his eyes wider, feeling more than seeing as he started to slow down. Feeling the sudden stop seconds before it happened, Harry kicked a leg out, feeling it plant onto solid ground seconds later. He pushed forward instinctively, the purple flames quickly falling away as a familiar, bustling platform crowded his vision. Platform 9¾ was
Nicolas hummed lowly as he picked up the cracked beaker the black liquid had been housed in, pulling out his wand to mend the fissure. “One would need an obscene amount of magical ability and a great deal of focus, but yes I am sure that it is possible. Such a thing has been credited to the alchemist Medusa from ancient Greece, who was quite accomplished in her own right before that unfortunate curse befell her, but that is a story for another time.”
The bloody ponce had the gall to snort at him! Draco bit the inside of his cheek, and as Perenelle bent over to grab one of the many pastries lining the table between them, turned slightly and swiftly kicked Harry in the leg. The taller boy jerked in surprise, before laughing and whacking him in the arm in retaliation. Draco swatted the arm away, annoyed and embarrassed and incredibly fed up with himself.
“Alright, everyone settle down.” Her frown deepened at the headmaster’s voice, and she glanced idly in his direction as a hush fell over the crowd of students. “As you all can see, Alastor Moody here—a very dear friend of mine—is joining our staff for this year. Please give him a warm welcome, for he will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from this moment onwards!”
“No use contemplating the thought when I can just try it.” He muttered, stalking forward with a curious gleam to his eye. The locket froze, its bloodshot and bleeding eyes wide and confused as he gained ground.
Harry didn’t think that either of the Flamels could be hypocritical on the basis of murder, considering where their own immortality came from, but there was so much more to his situation that he wasn’t completely sure they would even believe. How would he be able to explain how he had come into his creature inheritance in the first place, especially when Nicolas had done such an intensive deep-dive into the Peverell family in order to research the Deathly Hallows? He would, in the very least, have to tell the pair that he was already the Master of Death, though there was no possible way for him to explain how he had come into contact with all three of the Hallows in order to meet Death in the first place, especially since he hadn’t even considered retrieving the resurrection stone for another few years, and Nicolas was under the assumption that neither of them knew where the hallows were located. And if he did manage to get around all of that without a single mention of time travel, then how would he explain the creature inheritance in the first place?
Harry sighed, and reached for his letter opener. He tried to be as delicate as possible in tearing the envelope open, having felt the vague texture of something not quite parchment sitting inside, but despite his best efforts, various colors of glitter forced their way out of the paper confindes, spreading all across his desk and making him curse harshly.
his magic. Poor lad really shouldn’t have expended his core so egregiously, though I suppose it couldn’t be helped.”
He threw the powder into the flames, watching as it turned purple instead of green. The color took him aback at first, as for some reason he had been expecting that it would be the same color as normal, despite the international floo powder being a completely different potency to intranational floo, and thus needing a completely different color to discern the two. He reached for his second trunk again, sparing one last glance backwards at his parents before stepping into the purple flames. His mother looked stricken, but also strangely relieved, as if she was glad he was leaving and staying far away.
It was without the sulking Black that he turned back to the two, apologizing for cutting the rather disjointed conversation short. “My godfather is... rather lacking when it comes to manners, I’m very sorry Miss. Delacour.”
Albus sighed, setting down the quill and momentarily gathering himself. He needed to have a plan before he did anything more. Tom was hardly one to be trifled with, especially if the man was newly risen and out for blood.
“No matter what your body and mind may think to say about you Hadrian, you are human. You are not an impenetrable fortress designed to withstand all forces, you are made of breakable bone and tearable flesh and blo-well, bone and flesh.” He snorted, shaking his head at the absurdity of his life as Perenelle let out a sigh of self-defeat. “My point is that Hadrian, you have every right to be upset, or angry, or frustrated. I have the feeling that you expect much higher things from yourself than you should, and I dearly hope you come to understand that expecting to be capable of things that simply cannot be done at the stage of life that you are living in, is not a kind way to treat yourself.”
“Many modern alchemists, those who have formed their own perceived notions of equivalence, have attempted to place laws around how equivalence can be reached. The first law, of which they title ‘alchemy's first law of equivalent exchange’ states that one cannot gain anything without first giving something in return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost.”
she had to have had some sort of vision. You heard how she was screaming, right? It's the only explanation!” He muttered, mind racing as he watched his own feet pace back and forth across the old floorboards. One of the blasted things kept creaking, likely due to being loose or unstable, but Theo couldn’t bring himself to stop pacing or try to adjust his path through the kitchen. The room was small enough that there was barely enough room for him, the kitchen island, and Xenophilius as is, so it would be difficult to try and step around the creaking board. It was horribly annoying though, and was starting to grate on his patience.
The words came tumbling out of his mouth before he could even contemplate them. So fast that he couldn’t even filter the agonizing emotion from the pure, impartial truth.
“Bloody hell… that's brilliant.” Tracey’s voice pulled her away from the thought, and Pansy glanced up to watch as the other girl ran ahead towards where the treeline stopped and they were suddenly in open fields of the greenest grass she had ever seen. It had just rained the day before-a delightful summer shower that had brought with it a great deal of humidity and bugs.
It had been built at a time that wizards tended to take themselves very seriously, and took that pompousness and attempted to incorporate it into their family homes. Because of that, the late Duncan Nott-who had been tasked with designing and building the family home-had decided to take several rather unnecessary liberties. The man had decided to ‘honor’ his family by building the home in twisting and nonsensical patterns not unlike a, well, knot. Some tried to argue that he had done this to attempt to confuse invading forces, just as how the founders of Hogwarts had done, but everyone who lived in Nott Manor knew the truth.
“Yes.” Tom found himself replying, and he stretched his own hand out to meet the blue-eyed man. “And I suppose you will be forced to have a name now, won't you?”
“Good to see you too, Harry.” Blaise chirped, smiling as the unnaturally tall boy sent him a withering glare before his eyes creaked shut again, presumably falling back asleep immediately. Blaise sighed slightly, falling down across the seating with a groan. “Merlin, you two are painfully dull today. What’s got your pants in a knot?”
Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing, failing rather miserably as Perenelle made a particularly unpleasant face. Dissolving into muffled snickering, he set the cup back down again and slapped his hands over his eyes, his snickers quickly turning into full-blown laughter as he slowly lost all sense. His shoulders began to shake as he continued to laugh, and Harry slowly lost sense of the laugher as he reached up towards his hairline and grabbed fistfuls of his hair, curling in on himself as the laughter continued. Harry couldn’t stop it. He didn’t know if he wanted to. It felt so good to just…
Theo blinked. Then a second time. Then a third, before the old crone standing in the doorway raised an amused, if slightly annoyed, eyebrow at him.
With that, the door was opened and shut with a resounding thunk, and Harry was left to the fumes he couldn’t smell and the potion no one but him could brew. After realizing the true extent of Harry’s immortality, the Flamels had gleefully tasked him with brewing all manner of dangerous and otherwise lethal potions that had never been made prior, as no one had ever survived the brewing process long enough to see if the potions even worked as intended. Of course, the first two potions they asked him to brew had simply blown up in his face, singing of his eyebrows and making Harry wonder if it was so much trouble to give him a bloody mask to wear, if only to protect his poor hair from any explosions. However, this one seemed
“Oh my.” Perenelle’s voice made him glance in her direction, and he watched as she held the velvet-covered, tastled program of the event up to her eyes. “There’s going to be a display of the team’s mascots before the game begins. What are the teams playing? Bulgaria and Ireland?”
“Blasted thing.” He muttered, giving up as the woman on top of him pushed his fumbling fingers away in order to do the job well enough herself, apparently being of sound enough mind to manage such a thing. Lucius let her do so, his inebriated state making him far too inattentive to stay on one task for terribly long. Letting his wife do quick work with the confusing undergarment, Lucius let himself admire the show, leaned back onto his elbows as his still-soaked collared shirt strained around his elbows.
Barty hissed a groan, the ear-splitting sensation only growing stronger as the crowd screamed all at once, bombarding his eardrums with tortious noise until it was all he could focus on. His ears rang, the agony tripling by the second as blurry forms of people flew past his vision, disrupted only by the people around him, crowding up and towards him. There was so much. Too much. He couldn’t
Harry blinked, before his head snapped to Perenelle, accusation in his tone as he clutched the small stone protectively to his chest. “This is the portkey?”
“You’re going mad, Harry?” He questioned, trying desperately to mask his confusion and mild panic with boredom as he awkwardly stretched across the chair. He shifted in place slightly, still studying every slight movement from Harry as the other boy seemed to slowly relax, settling further back in his chair as his shoulders fell.
The echo was back to Tom’s voice, the familiar voice reaching back up from deep inside his mind. Harry wanted to breathe, to sigh or cry or scream. Instead, he rubbed a slow hand down his face as the stale air around him began to warm again, the frost melting back to condensation as he settled himself back into barely-contained fury.
Hearing the words come out of his own mouth made Theo realize something, and he began to focus more onto what they might convey. Who was this demon? He had a sneaking suspicion that he already knew.
All through the first half of third year, it had been blatantly clear to her that Blaise was being affected by…
new consciousness, it is simple enough to realize that the different sides of our own soul’s full consciousness have been personified in each horcrux.” The man leaned back in his seat, eyes still trained onto Tom, who shifted uncomfortably. “Marvolo, as he is a consciousness bred from a time in which our soul was very angry and cruel, has of course embodied a consciousness that is malicious and blood-thirsty. I was created when our soul greatly desired knowledge in every form, so that is the drive that I embody. Any time before or after my creation is unnecessary for my personal consciousness, which is why I do not hold the maliciousness of Marvolo, the insanity of Slytherin’s locket, or the paternal drive that you yourself have embodied for over a decade. Each consciousness has been created from the same soul, but that one soul has changed so much over the years and had so many different goals that each consciousness varies wildly in motivations, character, and principles. Even for you, who was created in a very odd situation and was imbued with the desires of outside forces, embody the wishes of those forces as well as our own soul’s to the letter. Even though you do not embody the desires of our soul at the time of your creation, you still were created with the desires that you were, so that makes you a piece of the whole.”
He let frustration and anger overtake him for once, lashing out against the inanimate stone wall until his knuckles were scraped raw of skin and his bone showed through underneath, pale and harsh against the low candlelight. The stinging sensation was thrilling though, tantalizing in a way he couldn’t quite describe, and Harry couldn’t help but throw one last punch out towards the rough stone, feeling alive for the first time in
Harry glared at the door, annoyed with the man behind it and the entire situation that had led him to this point. He hadn’t wanted to speak with Tom for at
“I sincerely hope you’ve stopped growing, Potter. You look absurd enough as it is.” He remarked, almost without thought to the other person in the room. Harry’s grin widened, and he straightened his posture and leaned closer, looking as though he was about to say something particularly biting. Draco’s eyes widened as he found his head slightly craning back as Harry seemed to grow by just sitting there. He bit the inside of his cheek, his eyes stuck on the sharpness of his soulmate’s grin. Had Harry’s teeth always been that sharp?
Daphne had originally been concerned that he might get homesick at some point, or might just miss the Italian sun, but he seemed to be having the time of his life. His schedule seemed incredibly erratic though, which concerned her somewhat. He would wake up at any time between five in the morning and two in the afternoon, so there was no telling if he would be awake before her or would sleep through lunch, and each day he spent as much time outside or exploring the estare as physically possible. She knew that he had been confined to his bedroom for months the previous summer, and his mother had made his life hell over the yule holidays as well, so she could only theorize that he was trying to allow himself as much freedom as physically possible while he still had the means to do so.
He opened his eyes slowly, breathing out the deep breath as he blinked at the distant gleam of candlelight on the horizon. He squinted at the light, watching as the silhouette of a large house slowly came into view, some of the windows lit with soft greetings of warmth and luminescence. His eyes wandered slightly, watching the large form of his lord as the candlelight illuminated the man’s face, revealing the angular-yet-young features he hadn’t been able to properly make out before. Harry Potter’s face made him look like he was just barely a teenager. Maybe fifteen or sixteen at the most. If it weren’t for his stature, the boy would have difficulty passing as anything but a child. As it was, Barty had been assuming he was much older just by the way he walked and his height. Perhaps he had been considering the child’s body as his lord’s as well, if only subconsciously.
“You won’t ever leave, right Harry? Not even if you'd die if you stay?” Draco whispered, sounding so small and fragile that it nearly made Harry break down again. Instead, he steadied himself, pulling Draco closer somehow as he rested his chin on the other boy’s messy blond head. They had both been reduced to something less than themselves that day. The least he could do was stay steady as Draco fell through the cracks of his own mind.
“You’re going mad, Harry?” Draco remarked, almost casually, as he languidly stretched across the nearest chair. Harry found himself watching the movement, feeling like Draco was acting oddly… odd. He felt a spike of panic race through him. Had Draco gotten a letter as well? Did he already know?
It seemed almost cruel then, to force that kind of experience onto those hypothetical children of his.
Her eyes immediately lit up, and she set down the juice, leaning forwards with excitement. “Well, when you put it like that, I would be more than happy to help you with anything that you have concerns or questions about.”
“I’m Theodore Nott sir, your daughter invited me over for the summer?” He stumbled to his feet just as the man let out a low hum, returning to his side with what looked like a damp cloth.
How Fate Intended reached the 4000 kudos milestone yesterday night, which just completely blew me away. I want to thank each and every one of you for the support you've given me, in both this story and with Earthly Heavens. I never would have expected to have gotten this far when I first started out writing, and I am positive that without every single one of you being there, reading and reacting and loving this story, and then going the extra mile and giving your unyielding support in me and my nonsense, then all of this would not have grown into what it is today. So, thank you, thank you so SO much!
“I’m a… helper, of sorts. The gods give me the name of a creature that is struggling or will soon struggle and I show up to help them-to ease their burden, so to speak. Though, sometimes they don’t want the help and leave empty-handed.” She replied with a shrug, patting his hand as she settled him at the front desk, finally letting go of his wrist before rounding the desk to stand across from him.
He could slowly feel the wind-his fingers flexing as his muscles and bones and nerves lit alite with life. He was
He had noticed it over his last week of third year, and had decided firmly that he would worry about the apparent lack of dreams at a later date. It was hardly much of an issue in the grand scheme of things after all. At the moment, Harry was aware that he was asleep. At least, he was aware that his body had stopped moving and that it was getting cold to the point of his skin gaining ice crystals on it as the water particles in the air came in contact with him and his natural body temperature slowly froze them onto his skin. Harry was aware of all of it, but knew that he was supposed to be sleeping right now, so he didn’t open his eyes. He was unsure if this even counted as sleeping, or if it was some sort of self inflicted suspended animation that was brought on by his creature inheritance. He could only hypothesize how it worked, but could assume that during summer months, wendigo probably went into a hibernation of some kind to avoid the warmer weather that he now knew was incredibly unpleasant for him to live in, if the-logistically, quite mild-French summer heat was any indication. He mentally hummed, contemplating the thought with disjointed curiosity. He wasn’t nearly as concerned about the lack of dreams as he was with the lack of unconsciousness, knowing that while it was plausible-if moderately uncommon-for perfectly normal people to not be able to dream, his specific breed of ‘sleep’ seemed far more magical than was typically safe.
about the sudden change of atmosphere, if only to get his thoughts about it out onto paper. Blaise had written back with palpable concern, though there was a familiar undercurrent of mischief and teasing that Draco had been surprisingly thankful to feel. It felt like he hadn’t seen much of Blaise in the last year, the first half of their third year having been rather strained for all of them, and the second half having been simply distant, as Blaise had been off with Greengrass and generally distracted by her… girl-ness.
“I need some tea.” He muttered to himself, slowly backtracking to his bedroom, intent on hiding the letter away for now.
He couldn’t say no. He shouldn’t say no. Every reason he could possibly come up with before was pointless now. Saying no would do irreversible harm, not good.
The tar-like substance from the beaker attacked the molten rock with vigor, eroding away at it as if it were nothing but chalk on pavement.
Tom hummed, waving off Locket’s concerns as he fixed the doorknob back into place. “I don’t know, Locket. I think some meditative stillness would do you some good. The cup is always so good at sitting still, why don’t you try acting more like it?”
Locket strained against its chains, gnawing the air with cracked teeth as blood vessels burst in its eyes. It writhed unnaturally, thrashing and screeching as it tried to get the chain around its neck off by biting uselessly at it.
She scoffed at him, pointing at a nearby plate of toast with a firm expression. “That burnt piece of toast right there is more of a lady than I am, Mr. Potter. Do watch your tongue.”
He reached up to rub his face contemplatively, but recoiled once he realized that there was still glitter covering his fingers and palm. Groaning, he reached for his wand again, muttering another scourgify with slight aggression. Most of the glitter vanished off of him and his desk, only a few pieces remaining on the letter and under his fingernails. Leaning back, Harry rubbed his face with both hands before groaning again. Just what was it about the letter that made him feel so strange? Luna almost sounded… scared. Theo wasn’t capable of hurting her, at least Harry didn’t think so, so it had to be something else. Maybe she had some sort of vision? Theo always got a tad off kilter after a vision, though that still didn’t explain why she wrote to him of all people. Maybe he had been involved in the vision? It certainly wouldn’t have been the first time.
Harry thought haphazardly, slowly standing as well as Draco turned and began to pace through the room, muttering to himself nonsensically as fire danced across his arms and inside his eyes. Harry worked to steady himself for a moment, discombobulated by all the emotions racing through his own mind and towards him through the bond. His heart was aching, or maybe it was Draco’s. If his own worked for anything, it was for being useless. Yes, it was probably Draco’s.
Shouts of protest rose up around her, though Luna forced it all away from her tiny bubble of focus. This was horribly,
Maybe he just had a tendency to run towards danger instead of away from it. It would certainly explain his tendency to fight fire with ice instead of simply letting the fire burn.
Harry sighed, grabbing at Draco’s wrist and pulling it away from the parchment. “Draco, don’t do this. We can discuss what to do over the year, right now you need to-”
Throwing his own trunk roughly into the overhead next to Draco’s, he settled besides the boy and closed his eyes, yawning loudly as he eased back into the plush cushions.
“Sometimes, I think you’ve sacrificed the ability to understand social cues for a stellar intalect, Potter.” He muttered, before pressing closer into the hug, sighing as Harry’s arms wrapped around his shoulders and back.
Well, not really, but Harry wished it had. He wished that a lot of things had happened during the month of August, to be perfectly honest with himself. He wished that he had sorted through all of the loose ends and had tied them off, leaving a few dangling issues to be dealt with during the school year but nothing glaringly obvious or particularly time-consuming. He wished that he had been able to finish a letter to Lucius Malfoy, instead of breaking five quills and spilling ink over the parchment, ruining the entire thing before giving up, only to start the entire process over the next day. He wished he had been able to get an actual, genuine reply from Griphook, who had sent him nothing but paperwork over paperwork over more bloody paperwork that all had to be signed and sent back to Gringotts in order to give Draco the Black lordship without having to speak on the issue with his magical guardian, all in a reasonable amount of time and without tugging out the majority of his hair. He wished that he had been able to do a lot of things over the month of August, but the truth of the matter was woefully lacking in anything but a big heaping mess of delirious nonsense.
But then, as if nothing had even happened, Harry pulled away, and the crackling tapered off into nothingness. Draco sat there for a moment, blinking blankly at the vague outline of Harry’s collarbone under his shirt, before he lunged forward and whacked the taller boy in the side of the head.
“How did you sleep Hadrian? I know you drank far more than a young man of your age should.” She pat his arm kindly as he shook his head, waving away the concern as a glass of cool water casually floated into the space in front of him.
Alright people, I know that this is suuuuper late, so I have been making an effort to get back onto schedule and get us caught up chapter-wise. So, over the next three days, I will be updating daily, before momentarily returning to once a week before my schedule evens out and I am able to do bi-weekly updates again (it's been so long but I'm gonna do it!!). I hope to really get the ball moving again, especially now that I have officially planned out the entire story and have a good idea as to how the entire story will end! I'm super excited to share years 4-7 with all of you, and am super excited to start getting back on it!
“You are Harry Potter! You are, aren’t you? You have the scar and everyzing!” He blinked, glancing up to Fleur with a slightly panicked look as Gabrielle didn’t wait for his answer before leaping forward to hug him around the thigh, as she barely came up to his pelvis.
“I’m fine mother, Dobby packed everything I need, and I double checked that he didn’t sneak in any nonsense.” Draco surmised, holding back a snort as she audibly groaned when he mentioned the barmy elf. Honestly, Dobby had been practically
“Yes, sir.” Crouch nodded wobbly, looking rather faint as Harry stepped away, already turning to leave. “And… and what do we do if there is already someone taking Moody’s place?”
"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!" Roared Bagman, his arms outstretched in a show of overwhelming glee as the entire top box seemed to come to life.
“What are you doing here, Locket.” He supplied it instead, shifting around to lean his back against the circular door that was now keeping Harry’s secrets safe. The locket horcrux was by far the most unpredictable of the lot; a thought only confirmed by the day’s escapades, which had involved a near-constant fight between the two of them, which involved no small amount of blood being spilled on either side. Tom looked down at his arms, wincing at the deep, bloodied scratch and bite marks that had been left there by the locket each time it had managed to get close enough. The two of them hardly got on, especially now that the entire ordeal between him and Marvolo was picking up, since Locket was very clearly on the insane man’s side. This though… this felt more like a fight between archenemies rather than two disagreeing factions of the same soul.
Nicolas coughed again, taking deep breaths of the fresh air outside with clear relief. “I will have to-to step out, however. The fumes will become lethal to me once you do, even with the elixir of life in my blood.”
Tom realized that there was something wrong the instant that it happened, sitting up straight in his chair as an earth-shattering
to be covered in something, including the floor, ceiling, and walls. He was honestly shocked that the kitchen seemed to be exempt from this rule, with the floor and its creaky boards being almost completely spotless. The shelves and counters however, were much the same as the rest of the house.
Theo frowned, brushing the thought away as he quickly slipped into his bedroom and grabbed the two trunks sitting next to the door. What Harry had done was so much worse than what Blaise had, he was sure of it. For Blaise, there hadn’t been any pain for the victim, and Blaise’s reasons were much more dire than Harry’s had been. Theo didn’t know much of the specifics for either situation, but he knew through a few deep-seated feelings that it had been a life or death situation for Blaise, and that he never would have done it unless his life was on the line. Harry however, clearly did it because of some sort of vendetta against a girl that-from what Theo could infer-just had some sort of crush on the taller boy. Sure, Harry had a soulmate, and that in itself was grounds to garner him some sympathy, but mutilating the girl the way that he had… Theo stopped, gulping down the rising bile as the memory of the body inside the great hall rose back up to the surface.
Harry paused his observations of the gold to look at Nicolas quizzically, before shrugging to himself and gingerly setting the petri dish back onto the table. “Well, thank you for the demonstration. If I may ask, however, I’m quite curious about the nature of that black liquid. What exactly is it?”
“It’s not very priceless, really, just a fun little novelty. It hadn’t been made with enough… well, ingredients. It can’t do much besides shine prettily, so Nicolas made it into a necklace for me as a fourth-anniversary gift. It was a matching set with this bracelet.” She explained, holding up her wrist, wherein sat a similarly styled bracelet with a slightly smaller stone dangling from it. “This stone is the second prototype, if you’re curious.”
Was Tom’s only advice, and Harry hadn’t been able to do much besides distastefully agree. He had contemplated the morality behind draining the blood of ten thousand muggles, mulling over if it was morally despicable or not. He had concluded that it certainly was, obviously, but he was willing to make it happen for Draco’s sake. The only question he really had was… well, if the entire ordeal was even possible to pull off without him getting into several incredibly inconvenient situations. Ten thousand people couldn’t just up and die from the same thing without a great many questions being asked about it, after all. Hell, Harry couldn’t even come up with an efficient way of going about the entire thing, knowing that it was all too likely he would get caught by the muggle or magical authorities at
Now that Harry had inadvertently saved them from revealing Lucius’ plan to Marvolo, Tom could focus on getting the blasted thing out of his mind. How it had even managed to break through the door was worrying enough in itself, never mind the fact that Harry’s loved ones could be in danger because of the breach. He would try to figure out how it had happened once he had properly fortified the broken door, healed himself, and fixed the mess that was his mind after the hours-long fight that had ensued because of it all.
Luna didn’t pay much mind as the rest of the school trickled in, though she did spare the tiny little first years a quick glance. Their souls were so fickle; small and quivering. They were all shaking like leaves in a thunderstorm and looked rather faint. Luna watched them warmly, thinking back to her first day at Hogwarts with a fond smile. She hadn’t been terrified—not in the least—though she had been quite curious about all the fantastical sights and sounds all around her. She distinctly remembers making Harry quite incensed as well, though she couldn’t recall exactly how. She remembered how his soul had reacted though—still as stone and coiled, held taught along a thin wire. She remembered thinking that it was a beautiful soul. That had been before his shattering, of course, when his soul had still been nothing but a black hole of potential. She almost missed those times. They were simpler.
Perenelle’s voice cut through his thoughts as she sat down next to him with a glass of orange juice in hand. “Nicolas never seems to get up before noon, so you’ll just have to bother with my inane ramblings until then.”
His grandfather cut him off, suddenly storming forward and gripping Theo’s shoulder in a painfully tight grip. “That entire family is a
He turned a corner that was more oblong than was normal, coming upon a fireplace that stood directly in the middle of that hall for no particular reason. Surprisingly, his grandfather was there to meet him, the old man’s arms crossed behind his back and a third, much smaller, trunk resting at his feet. They looked at each other for a moment as Theo set down the suitcases in his hands, before his grandfather seemed to slump slightly.
“But you’re the only person that survived a Killing Curse twice. I tried to ask the Bloody Baron, but he wouldn’t tell me.”
Harry sinks to the floor next to him, deciding not to comment on the matter-of-fact tone. Harry tries to let the words come naturally to him like Hermione said, but now, faced with Draco finally, he still has not a clue what to say.
It’s meant to come out as a joke, but it’s humourless to even his own ears. His voice sounds hollow, the empty feeling from before returning full force. Hermione returns to her own work wordlessly, and Harry gets the feeling that he’s wronged her, but isn’t sure how.
Draco nods slowly. “I don’t think we should do it again, though.” He turns back to his parchment as disappointment races through Harry’s veins.
Malfoy sighs resignedly, and takes the proffered hand. His own hand is cold. Harry pulls him up, and then rights him when he nearly stumbles over. It feels like he weighs almost nothing. (For some reason it occurs to Harry that the last time they touched, Malfoy was screaming and holding onto him so tightly it hurt. That seemed like a lifetime away from now).
curious. Dudley could wait; Harry had a ridiculously expensive cup of tea and half a tub of ice cream to consume first.
and Harry recognised that book as one Hermione had read. Draco frowns at the pages at several points.
Harry wonders if Malfoy thought like that too, but finds that his Gryffindor courage isn’t enough to make him ask.
He’s saved from thinking about it further when Draco twitches in his sleep. Harry can barely make him out, the only light seeping in from under the door, but he feels the lump next to him move.
Draco’s rambling, and Harry’s struggling to keep up with each thread and tie them together in a way that makes sense to him.
sitting idly on his covers. Such an intense look passes over his features that Harry almost takes a step back (but he couldn’t anyway, as he was still sitting, and the most he could do without hitting the wall was a pathetic shuffle), and Harry recognises it as envy.
The fire isn’t lit, and without any light shapes begin to form in the corners of his vision. Something that could have been a bookcase transforms in the dark into the silhouette of a man, and Harry hears a whisper that could have been the wind or could have been a high voice, and he legs it back up the stairs to the boy’s dormitories.
Harry knows that Draco wasn’t allowed a wand, obviously, he’d been there when the sentence was handed to him. But without really seeing it, he never appreciated how difficult Hogwarts classes are without a wand.
this chapter took me forever for some reason, and I actually had to split it. The next chapter will probably be a bit shorter, but I promise that i did plan the plot to this and it is going somewhere!
Harry is trying to distract him the whole time, holding up different foods and asking what he likes. He already knew, of course, it was him that cooked most often, but it was a blatant attempt to get Draco to stop worrying about the muggles that were surrounding them, and Draco knows it too. His face is pale under the fluorescent lights, his hair and skin the same shade of alabaster. His initial fascination has worn off fast, but the nerves have stayed. Maybe this was a mistake, Harry thinks.
Draco shuts his eyes, and lets his head fall back against the railing. With each exhale a small puff of air slips from his pink lips, no longer tinged with blue like that day in the forest, and Harry watches as it dissolves into the black sky.
“Is it?” He whispers back through the side of his mouth, aware that McGonagall’s eyes are somehow closely watching all of them at the same time. “I’m Harry Potter, who cares if I fuck up my exams?”
“I don’t think it’s weird. I mean, after the war, I lived in the house where a mass murderer slaughtered people. My mother still lives there. It’s not any weirder than that…”
“Why are you staring at Malfoy? This isn’t going to be like sixth year again, is it? I know you were right last time, but believe me, I really don’t think like he’d dare do anything now, not after everything.”
He should leave it. Hermione’s sick, and if she hasn’t come to classes she must be really sick, and he needs McGonagall
(Some of the Eighth Years had decorated their doors with signs that made then stand out, but Draco’s stands out because it had a new coat of paint to cover where someone had written
He has a pleasant Christmas alone. He gets plenty of presents, some from complete strangers, and he writes letters to those he cares about. Apart from tea with McGonagall in the afternoon, he spends the day by himself, and he finds it refreshing.
This is easy magic, he could do it on any other day. He just can’t think, not when Draco keeps pressing closer and closer, as if he’s about to snatch up Harry’s wand and run away with it.
. He defeated the Dark Lord at the tender age of seventeen, and here he was, paralysed by the thought of an uncle he hadn’t seen since he was a teenager.
“I know what you mean - they all look like babies. We were just kids, and I can’t remember being that young either.”
“Don’t compare yourself to them, Draco. You were nasty and spoilt, but you were never anything like the Dursleys’...Well, when we first met you did remind me of Dudley, but not because you were very scary, you were just really annoying.”
He puts it back and picks up another and another, and sure enough Draco is hoarding empty Dreamless Sleep bottles under his bed.
And then Draco follows his eyes and snatches his hand away, yanking down his sleeve, and the moment is gone.
On those nights, he pulls out the map and watches Malfoy pace. It’s a good thing they don’t have to share anymore, Harry is certain that any roommate would be driven away by Malfoy’s sleeping habits, or rather, his lack of them.
Draco makes a small noise, and his face twitches, but then his expression relaxes and Harry knows that he’s gone back to sleep.
Harry grabs a plate and serves up a mountain of food onto it, and then shoves it quickly  into his mouth to keep himself from saying anything else. Draco goes back to staring at his food, shoulders more hunched than before, clearly feeling the weight of the stares. Harry feels awful. He only wanted to keep Draco company, and he hadn’t anticipated the silent staring of the rest of the school. Luckily for them the younger years, who hadn’t seen much of their former rivalry, quickly get bored of the silent observation, and go back to their food, starting their own conversations and diluting the silence.
And Draco… Harry had alluded to his childhood not being the greatest. Draco, like him, had his fair share of horror stories that took place in his childhood home, but they mostly came from the war, and even though Draco had left Lucius to rot in Azkaban Harry knew Draco held a few fond memories of the man close to his heart. And he had his mother, who he still spoke to, who was slowly coming round to the idea of her son being with another man. Even Draco wouldn’t quite understand.
Draco is wearing his silk pyjamas and one of his dressing gowns, the sash tied loosely around his waist. His hair is tousled from sleep, and he has his wand stuffed in the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
Unfortunately, whoever was spreading the rumours seemed to always know when Harry was around, and he never got to hear the rumours in full. He only ever manages to hear small snippets, like tiny pieces of a puzzle that were slowly connecting to make an unpleasant picture in his head.
A near-silence settles over the room, the only noise the clink of tea cups and the crackling of the fire. They didn't often bring up the past, but their shared history was something that they had always been conscious of, it was impossible not to be, but this was new. Harry had never spoken of this with anyone, not truly, and if he had not seen Vernon, or any of them again, then he likely never would have. They had been a bitter memory that he had shut inside himself, locked away with countless other moments of his life, until it had been pulled to the surface. Harry longed to drown it again, but he has a feeling in the pit of his stomach that it's not going away any time soon.
Draco's voice has a natural storytellers lilt, and despite the depressive subject matter of the book, he reads with a calming tone that wouldn’t be out of place reading stories to children, and Harry falls into a blissfully dreamless sleep before the end of the first chapter.
of someone tip-toeing down the steps, the sound getting smaller and smaller until the occasional crash of thunder is the only sound to keep him company.
. Harry still doesn’t really know why. By all means he should hate Malfoy, but whenever he tries he just pictures Malfoy’s tearful face on the Astronomy Tower, lowering his wand a second too late.
Harry rubs the remainders of sleep from his eyes and finds that he actually feels refreshed, and not like he had just played Quidditch for twenty hours straight and been hit by no less than ten bludgers.
Harry opens his eyes. A peach-coloured china teacup sits on the desk. He looks to Draco, and in his eyes there’s something like yearning.
Him and Hermione sat in a corner in the common room or the library most nights, when they weren’t on a floo call with Ron, but Harry didn’t mind being alone in the evenings.
“Ouch,” He rubs the spot on his head. There is the sudden sound of footfalls above him. He freezes, hand on his head.
any?” Harry asks boldly, feeling strongly that something wasn’t right, but also feeling wrong-footed because he couldn’t quite figure out what it was.
There’s a sharp crack that shatters the humming. His ears pop, and suddenly Harry's being pulled in ten different directions at once. His vision whites out and he almost vomits.
a shorter chapter but I needed to get to the end point. I sort of view this story in two parts, and this would be the end of part one.
When Harry walks into Transfiguration that morning, he immediately notices that Hermione isn’t in her normal seat at the front. A cursory glance around the class tells him that she's not there at all.
He stares at the white door, hand hovering over the handle, listening as the cries die down to murmurs, until eventually there’s silence behind the doors.
Dreamless Sleep was meant to induce drowsiness, and then, as the name suggested, a dreamless sleep where the drinker would rest without being disturbed.
Harry closes his eyes. Someone pulls up something soft and warm over his chest, and the sensation is what he imagines a child would feel being tucked into bed.
“I don’t know why I said that. I just need you to know I still have it. It’s in my room on my desk, and I don’t use it because I don’t want it to get stained because it’s precious now. I had lots of teacups at home, some of them ancestral china cups, but the other Death Eaters used to smash our family things and I don’t know how many are left. I haven’t been able to go back and count. I think I will when the holiday starts. Or maybe I can ask Mother to count them for me.”
quiet. Eerily silent except for Harry’s heavy breaths and Malfoy’s shallow ones. There’s no gentle padding of deer or birds, no leaves rustling as the wind blows through them. Like the Forest remembers what took place there.
Given that so few Eighth Years came back, it was decided that they would be allowed to have their own rooms if they wanted. He knew some students had refused, the Patil twins had insisted on sharing, but the majority of them were enjoying the newfound freedom.
Malfoy was like a ghost. A pale trembling, twitching ghost that said nothing when someone shoved him or sent a leg-locker curse at him. Harry had stood in the shadows in those moments, retaliating with wordless stinging hexes and a
Something had cracked that Christmas Eve when Harry followed him into the Forest and Draco asked about dying, and something new and precious had begun to form from the ashes of what they had been, like a Phoenix. Yeah, Harry thought, that was another good metaphor, Hermione would be so proud.
They Apparated in the middle of a muggle supermarket. Surely, someone must have seen it. Harry sits up fast, and his forehead smacks against a broom.
They settle near the lake, not far from Hagrid’s hut, and Draco kneels on the dock and stares into the water, his hair once again falling over his face, his pink lips pouting slightly. Harry is suddenly thrust into a memory from primary school History class, when they had learned about Narcissus, a man who fell in love with his own reflection, and the painting they had been shown. Harry had thought that the man was pretty, however when he said it out loud his teacher had stared at him oddly, before pointedly ignoring him the rest of the lesson.
thank you for reading! you can find me on tumblr as dracopetal!! this was originally going to be what i wrote for the drarrymicrofic prompt 'surbubia' but then it got a lot longer and i ended up not even using the prompt word.
“It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenburgs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York. I’m stupid about executions. The idea of being electrocuted makes me sick -”
Malfoy’s stumbling away before he can stop him, and Hagrid’s hand on his shoulder makes Harry let him go.
Malfoy opens his book back up after the conversation tapers off, and for a few minutes the only sounds are the flicker of the flames and the gentle
The sight of it stops him, and for several moments he’s too tired to even recognise what’s wrong. And when he realises, he simply stands there blankly.
Harry tries to follow the words over Draco’s shoulder, but without his glasses the pages and text blur together in a grey mush.
The Ravenclaw isn’t aware enough to be worried, still blinking owlishly at them all, but real fear passes through the Gryffindor’s face and gets stuck there.
He doesn’t know how long he waits while he gets nothing but silence from the other room; there’s a ticking clock somewhere nearby but he can’t lift his head to look. Eventually, after an eternity, a Healer in bottle-green robes slips quietly out of the room.
himself. He never thought he’d miss the spoiled, nasty boy who had a barely-hidden cruel streak, but this quiet, mouse-like Malfoy who looked like a mild wind would knock him over, unsettles something in him.
One of Draco’s pointy toes nudges Harry’s bare leg. Harry knew the meaning behind it; when Draco was remembering something awful he couldn’t stand to be touched. Harry tugs the hem of Draco’s pyjama bottoms until Draco moves his foot onto Harry’s pillow. He squeezes Draco’s ankle.
Malfoy huffs a laugh. “Confusing. It’s a children’s book, but the characters aren't normal muggles. I don’t really think it’s helping me understand muggles. It’s not awful, though. It’s… I like it.”
if he had of come any closer I really would have killed him, and I didn’t even mean to. He’s here somewhere, he must live close, and I haven’t thought about him in years. But I saw him for the first time since I was seventeen yesterday and now I can’t stop bloody thinking about him.”
Harry lays on his own bed in the light of the morning sun and wonders about the empty potion bottles under Draco’s bed.
He scans the the map for his name almost religiously, and even tries lurking outside the Room of Requirement, but the wall remains unchanged every time. It's not stalking, he tells himself, it was just pure concern. Which was not something he ever thought he’d feel for Malfoy, but stranger things had happened.
It’s not like Privet Drive, but a cupboard is a cupboard. It’s enough to let him think. And as he does so he comes to the conclusion that there is absolutely nothing that he can do.
Harry holds onto Draco’s hand long after his skin has healed, pretending to inspect it for any trace of burns, knowing that there won’t be any. Draco lets him, and the tension has drained out of him.
Harry dares to press a little harder on the scars as he traces them. There seems to be an infinite amount, so much more so than what Harry remembers. Draco doesn’t stop him, and is now following his fingers. He brushes his own fingers across the one that cuts through his nipple.
Hermione notices that he’s not paying attention, and she glances in the same direction before letting out a quiet sigh. Harry jumps, and turns back to her.
“I lived with my aunt and uncle. You know, they were my only relatives who could care - take me in. I had a cousin.”
“Oh, sure. I’ll go, I’ve got some… homework. Hermione’ll kill me if I don’t get it done, it’s an important year and all that.” He rambles, grabbing his wand off the bed going over to the door.
Draco looks awful, but no more awful than usual. He’s alone in his own corner, empty chairs surrounding him, hunched over his parchment, his white fringe falling in a curtain to hide his face. It’s a mirror image to how he is whenever Harry sees him in the Great Hall.
Harry had never told anyone of what truly happened at the Dursleys’. He knew both Ron and Hermione had been able to deduce the gist of it, and though both had asked on a few rare occasions, Harry had always managed to change the subject. The closest he had got to telling Ron was when they were pissed as sailors just after the war, and out of his mind with drink, Harry had told him some story about being locked in his cupboard for a week. There had been a joke in there somewhere, Harry knew at the time he had found it funny, but Ron hadn’t laughed.
Harry falls, rather than sits, next to him. The cold earth penetrates the thin fabric of his pyjama bottoms, and he’s immensely glad that he can cast as many warming charms as he wants. He studies Malfoy’s side profile. He’s still staring blankly ahead, eyes locked on something Harry can’t see, and occasionally he sniffs. Malfoy’s lips are still blue, but there’s a tinge of colour returning to his cheeks.
Draco is seated at the end of the table, in the same position as he was in Transfiguration, except his hair is tucked back behind his ears. Harry assumes it’s so it doesn’t get in his food, but it makes the bruise on his chin stand out starkly on his otherwise pale skin.
He shivers, and Draco glances at him. Harry casts a warming charm over them both, one that should last until the end of lunch.
Harry isn’t really angry with her; Hermione coped with stress by lecturing. However the lecture lasted for over two hours, so Harry decided that he wouldn’t be pestering her about it again.
The room is surprisingly empty, the other Healers having slipped out without him noticing. Draco is curled on his side under thin baby-blue coloured sheets, knees curled against his face, one hand picking out strands of white hair, one after the other. Pick, pick, pick.
“Nothing - we just wanted to mess with him, that’s all. We cast some stinging hexes at him, that stuff, and then we gave him some dreamless sleep, just so he’d pass out for a bit and would freak out when he woke up. We didn’t do enough to bloody kill him!”
There are multiple empty chairs dotted around the classroom; the Eighth Year wasn’t as large as the others. Harry can sit anywhere, but there’s only one place where he wants to sit.
“Don’t bother,” He slurs, hand coming up to dab at the blood seeping from his forehead. “He’s not … worth… not… my head hurts”
Apparently when Northern Lights was originally published, it was only released as The Golden Compass in the US, which is a very useless fact that I found out when writing this.
“Dunno. Didn’t read it. It’s still in the kitchen. Funny though, there wasn’t a full address, and it was in the kitchen and not the post box, so he must have delivered it the wizarding way. Which could imply…”
He floats around Grimmauld Place that evening, constantly moving from room to room like a restless ghost. Draco watches him do so. Harry knows it's driving him insane; Draco hated pacing and nervous fidgeting. Yet he says
What is he doing with Draco? They were friends now - they had to be. He was unused to thinking of his former rival in such a way, however he struggled to reconcile the boy curled up next to him with the cruel boy who had reminded Harry so much of his cousin.
be particularly enraged if I were to put every tub in my trolley? Our ice box thingy isn’t big enough, even with shrinking charms, but I reckon I could place stasis charms on quite a few of them and keep them in the cupboards. Oh, I know Mother would be nauseated if she were to see all of the sugar inside them and would worry for my teeth, but how unhealthy can they be, really? Ice cream won’t make me fat if I eat too much of it, it’s practically a liquid. Surely -”
but there’s another shout, this one higher than the last, and it sounds sickeningly familiar and he can’t ignore it.
“Oh. I dunno. Said she was busy with something. I’ve done something to piss her off.” He admits, and then lays down on the dock. He feels Draco watching him.
The other Slytherin’s are further up the table; to Harry it looks as if they don’t even see him there. Harry doesn’t understand how: Draco Malfoy has always been impossible to ignore.
Draco lets out another demented cackle, and then goes eerily silent. Harry can only hear the soft whistle of the wind, and Draco’s steady, yet shallow breathing.
The anger is still there, and he stares back at the Gryffindor, who is beginning to rise to his feet, and he moves for his wand but Draco holds him back.
Harry notes the advice, and then frowns. “What do you mean, she won’t give you any? That hardly seems fair. If it’s because -”
The last time he had seen the Dursley’s was when they went into hiding, just before he went on the run. Harry didn’t think about them, refused to allow himself to be swallowed by the past. The most he allowed himself was the memory of Dudley’s clammy hand shaking his, and his confession of “
Harry watches him stare listlessly down at his plate as he pushes his food around, and wants to go to him. It’s stupid, they aren’t friends, but Malfoy looks lonely, and Harry knows better than anyone what it’s like to have the world against you.
Malfoy meets his eyes then, and Harry is almost taken aback by the fire in them. It’s only a brief moment before the flames are doused out and he looks away.
Harry has heard some of the whispers about Malfoy, ones that started at the beginning of term but tapered off the first few weeks in, however after the Christmas holidays they had started up again.
Pushing the thoughts of what could’ve been out of his head, and trying to ignore the empty feeling that was crawling its way up from his belly, he rests his head in Draco’s soft hair and closes his eyes.
Harry knows that feeling all too well. Any good mood that had formed earlier had evaporated. He stares at the silent water, and pictures what it would be like to go under and not come back up.
“Because even though you watched him die, you still think that he might be there when you wake up.” Harry finishes for him.
Draco is almost mute. Harry knows that that’s awful, because Draco is only ever quiet when he’s scared, or legitimately worried. Really, really worried. Even when he’s nervous he’s chatty.
The boy pointing his wand at Draco, a Ravenclaw, crumples almost comically, and the others are startled. The Slytherin quickly edges backwards, sensible, given the pure rage crawling up his throat.
sent the curse at me, it was your mother who looked him in the face and lied to him. But before she did so, she asked me if you were alive. She didn’t lie for me, Malfoy, she lied to Voldemort for
Harry can’t quite push the fear away completely, and it sits at the bottom of his skull like a spider that he can feel but not see, and makes the hairs on the nape of his neck rise a little with every step. He forces himself to keep moving, one step in front of the other, until the end of the forest disappears and he is truly surrounded. Harry stops, staring silently around him, realising he’s shivering with cold, having been out in December in only a jumper. His hand is gripping his wand so tightly that it burns him.
Malfoy stares at him, and there’s something oddly child-like in his gaze. Maybe it’s the wideness of his wet eyes, or his pouting lips. “Does it hurt?”
Harry shuffles awkwardly towards it, knowing that he’s being nosy, and then frowns when he sees that it’s just a potion vial holder, filled with empty vials. He picks one up and squints at the label.
Harry blushes, and then goes even redder when he realises. “Thanks, it was, uh, I don’t really know how I do it. Things like that sort of happen to me sometimes. Hermione said something about strong emotional feelings can set it off, but we don’t really know for sure. It feels kind of strange, so I try not to do it too often.”
“Hey, Draco, it’s me,” Harry says, angling his wand so it illuminates them both. “You’re at Hogwarts, you said I could sleep in your bed last night, you’re not there, He’s -
“He killed in my home,” Malfoy whispers without opening his eyes. “In my dining room, in my drawing room, in the ballroom.”
“Stop talking like that. You’re not going to die, you’re going to complete this year and get your wand back, and then… then -” Harry falters, realising suddenly that he has no idea what Draco wants to do when Hogwarts is over. Or even if he wants to do anything.
“When He was in the… the manor,” Malfoy starts, voice cracking on the second word. “He used to come into my bedroom. And. He would wait until I was actually a-asleep, which wasn’t… often. And then he would touch me.”
, so he hadn’t given him a chance to complain. Harry simply grasped his bony wrist and apparated them outside the shop.
Malfoy, still half asleep with only the dim light of the fire, sees a figure standing over him, feels clammy hands on his shoulders, close to his neck, and screams.
I haven’t slept since Father was arrested, before sixth year. I’m so fucking exhausted, but I can’t sleep, so I come down here for some peace and quiet, but then you just have to stick your nose -”
Malfoy runs his fingers over the cover. Flames dance across his profile, and in the dim flickering light he looks much older than his eighteen years. Harry wonders if that’s how he looks sometimes, worn out and frayed at the edges.
“It’s stupid. I went down to the common room, and you weren’t there, and so I was going to go back, but it was dark and I kept thinking I was seeing things out of the corners of my eyes and so I hoped you’d be awake to tell me I’m not going mad.” Harry looks at him pleadingly, and after an uncomfortable few seconds Draco gets the hint.
“I could never stay away from you, Draco.” Harry feels himself pinken, but it’s the truth. Harry has always been…
“That’s not what - you don’t know that! And even if it did - you’d come back from it. You always do.”
Really, it’s not like they’re friends, even though they certainly aren’t arch-enemies anymore, and Harry is sure that he can convince himself that Malfoy can handle it.
He's exhausted. Harry rests his head against Draco's breastbone, and presses his cheek into the soft wool of his dressing gown. Draco, stiff and unmoving, lets him rest. Harry doesn't notice the contemplative look on his face as he drifts off into a dreamless sleep.
Well, if Harry’s already interrupted one of Draco’s reading sessions, he’s certainly not about to kick him off his own bed. But the desk chair is, like the identical one in Harry’s room, incredibly uncomfortable, as if whoever designed them wanted to stop them from studying, and Draco’s bed looks warm and inviting.
Harry can’t think of anything to say either, and for the rest of lunch they lay next to each other with their fingers entwined, and Harry wonders what he’s doing.
Even after the war, after he killed the Dark Lord and saved them all, they still wouldn’t tell him what he needed to know. If he had known, he could have -
“No, it’s just… I thought you’d know.” Hermione fingers the dust-jacket of the book. Harry glances at it,
Draco glances at the gap between his mattress and the floor and then back at Harry, and Harry manages not to look obviously guilty. He chews his bottom lip for a second, and then goes over to his desk. He almost collapses into the chair.
Draco looks away. “Nothing. It’s just… You’re right. Some of the first years, they don’t really know, at least the muggleborn ones don’t, and sometimes I look at them and can’t really remember being that young.”
“Mother wanted me to go back for Christmas. But I can’t. All those ghosts... But then she’s all alone. She’s only in the country for me, she’d be exiled in France otherwise. If I wasn’t here then she’d be able to leave,” Malfoy goes on.
“Is it good?” Harry has never been a big reader, but he’d find a subtle way to ask Hermione for any book suggestions, if Malfoy wanted.
“No, I think it might have. I wanted to be caught, I think. I knew you were stalking me, and I didn’t want to be caught, but at the same time I wanted you to find out and stop me. I needed someone to stop me. But no one did.”
Most students are at lunch, and the corridors are empty, but Harry wishes there was someone else with him.
Harry wants desperately to know what’s going on, to find out what he’s missed. Even Hermione has been no more forthcoming, and had somehow managed to turn his last attempt at asking into a lecture on why he should study more.
Nineteen days after Draco returned from St Mungo’s, and two nights after Draco had left Harry to wake up with fingers and toes like blocks of ice on the Astronomy Tower,  Harry wakes up to a feeling of dread creeping up through his bones.
“Do you want to go? Like, really want to go?” Harry whispers to him. Draco draws himself up to his full height, an inch above Harry, and reminds Harry of a peacock with ruffled feathers when he sneers.
” Another tear slips down his alabaster face, and then another and another. Before Harry has a chance to interject he goes on: “There’s something rotten inside of me - don’t you get it? I’m irredeemable, and you’re the boy who saved us all. I don’t understand why you didn’t just leave me to
He seems to be right, because the next time he finally sees Malfoy is at the feast. Harry’s at the end of the bench with Hermione next to him, a book unopened on the table next to her plate. She’s telling him about Australia, and Harry already knows because Ron told him through the floo only days before, so he doesn’t feel guilty when he focuses on a slim figure sitting alone at the end of the Slytherin table. He’s sitting on the end of the bench, and there’s a visible gap between him and the other Slytherin students, as if there’s some kind of force separating them.
They come out of the forest at the same opening that Harry went in, and he spots Hagrid outside his hut. He raises a large hand in greeting, and Harry returns the wave. Malfoy pulls away from him slightly as Hagrid approaches, and wraps his arms around himself. It reminds Harry of himself, when Vernon used to shout at him.
“No, I don’t… I don’t really get hungry much.” He says just as Harry finishes his plate. He gulps down his pumpkin juice.
Harry recalls briefly studying it with Hermione and Ron. Harry didn’t particularly like taking it; the drowsiness it caused made him nauseous, but he had studied the effects anyway.
He goes into Hagrid’s hut and chooses a seat opposite the window. All the time Hagrid talks to him, he’s half-staring out the window, watching as Malfoy gets smaller until he’s doll-house sized. Malfoy stumbles a couple of times, and Harry wonders what happened to all that grace.
, and the sleeve of his pyjama top rides up, revealing the faded dark mark, latched onto his skin like a parasite. The skull on his forearm doesn’t move, but Harry can’t stop himself looking, morbidly fascinated.
Harry isn’t sure why that particular part of the memory stands out so clearly, but he puts it to the back of his mind while he watches Draco.
He whispers, and the impossibly long corridor is bathed in white light. It does nothing for his frantic heart, if anything the shadows flicker more at the corners of his vision, and every time he shines his light into a corner he’s half-certain He will be waiting there.
of Draco that he ate like a bird on the best of days. Harry decides that if he doesn’t see him before lunch then he’ll search for him on the map.
Hermione keeps talking, but her voice is just a noise in the distance. He can’t help but watch Malfoy. This is stalkerish, he knows, but there’s something going on, and he needs to know what. Him and Malfoy have always been weird about each other, it’s only logic.
He pulls out his wand and kneels down beside him, slowly wrapping his arm around Draco’s shaking shoulders. Draco flinches, but he doesn’t push Harry away, and Harry counts it as a win.
Harry doesn't see Malfoy for the remainder of the Christmas holidays. It isn't like he thinks they're best friends now, or even friends at all, but he finds himself wanting to talk to the other boy. Perhaps it's the strangeness of talking with Malfoy without arguing that makes the prospect so oddly exciting.
