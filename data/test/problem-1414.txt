"He can't actually do that..." Draco mumbled to himself, already thinking of a plan. Maybe this way, he could atone for one of the horrible things he had done in the past. It wouldn't be much, but it was a start.
"It's a hereditary thing so say if one of the parents is a Veela and the other is a Human, and they have a child, that child would be half-Veela," Hermione responded.
"Of course he doesn't! Do you see how wiggle waggle we are right now!" Draco yelled; it seemed like he was always yelling at Weasley and Harry, Merlin, he wished Hermione was here, at least then it would be a balanced amount of stupidity.
he was feeling the way he did. The main emotion that he felt these days was anger... and sometimes sadness, but that wasn't new to him.
Suddenly, they both realized how close they were. Or, at least, Draco did. He didn't think Harry knew, it was either that or he didn't mind. For some reason, Draco's mind thought it was the latter. Harry opened his mouth to say something, his expression softening.
Harry pretended to think for a moment. "Nope." He shrugged. "Eating breakfast is always a death sentence, especially those... oranges." He shuddered.
Draco desperately tried to get out of this death machine the Weasley family called a car, Weasley had broken his wand when they landed in the whomping willow, a final touch to Draco's misery.
Something shined next to her, and she saw her mirror lying next to her abandoned school supplies. She felt dizzy from the blood loss but reached out for the mirror. She just barely grabbed it when she saw
No one payed attention to the Weasley boy's sorting, the only thing that did bring the great hall out of their stupor was when the name, Harry Potter was called. At least that sorting went as expected.
Draco nodded and left the room, he could feel all three pairs of eyes on him as he walked out, the tension in the room still hadn't disappeared, if anything, it had grown while Draco was out, most of it came from Snape.
Myrtle seemed to notice it too, given how she giggled. "The same book that you flushed down the toilet, that was awfully rude you know!" she berated him.
There it was again, the overwhelming need to protect Draco, to make sure he was safe, at first, Harry had thought that he and Draco were just close friends, like Ron and Harry were, but he didn't feel the same way with Ron. Every time Draco complimented him, he felt something bloom in his chest, every single act of staggering genius made Harry bloom.
"The power to turn into a particular animal at will, the animal is meant to reflect your personality in some way and will take the same form as your
Potter waited for a second before answering him, as if he was waiting for Draco to yell something out again, "Just follow me."
"Why can't I change certain things, why can't I tell people that I had a vision?" He asked, looking her in the eye. She laughed softly, opening the door to let him in.
Draco looked back at his friends and waved them goodbye, he was looking forward to next year, he knew he should be worried that his father might disown him, but he wasn't, he didn't care, if Lucius disowned him, he would figure out what to do.
It took an embarrassingly long time to convince Harry that, no, he was not in love with Nott. Hermione was no help, and Draco had no desire to talk to Ron
"Yes, Professor." He hadn't meant for this to happen. How could he have known his fear would have been something so graphic.
Was that what Potter was on about that day, he hadn't been listening, he was too busy with his prophesy work.
"Headmaster-" He started, meaning to ask Dumbledore about that mist that had caused him to faint, but he was interrupted by a small man, running into the room that Draco recognized as Professor Flitwick.
"Professor! We need to speak to Dumbledore." Hermione spoke in a tone that clearly said that this was serious.
It must have been a dream, he thought he had a bad one, something about a cat. Draco looked around the room and was confused when he saw that it had been rearranged and the door was open, had someone come in here while he was sleeping.
"Excellent, Miss Lovegood. You managed to conquer your fear and turned your boggart into something extremely unique. I've never seen anything like this before. Five points to Ravenclaw!" Lupin looked absolutely delighted. There was a spark of curiosity in his eyes; Draco had seen it many times in Anthony's eyes. Now that he thought about it, Anthony and Lupin did act slightly similar.
Except for that awful Zacharias Smith, of course. It seemed that boy just couldn't let go of the fact Draco was a Malfoy. But no matter, he was pretty sure Smith wasn't even in this class. He had heard that bumbling oaf had spilled a potion on him the day before and was resting in the hospital wing.
This was getting ridiculous, he had recieved multiple owls from multiple teachers requesting for him to be in private tutoring with all of them, the only one that wasn't harrasing him was Quirell, and thank the heavens for that, he didn't' know what he would do if bloody Quirell came up to him and wanted to teach him privately.
"Yes, Professor," Draco replied, walking over to the swarm of cotton creatures. He slowly took his wand out and approached the cloud with thinly veiled curiosity. Sure, he was scared to see what it would turn into. But he was also curious of what his worst fear would be. Voldemort? Maybe. Lucius? No; he had few good memories of his father, but they were there.
"I don't understand, what does mudblood mean?" Harry asked throwing his arms out, Draco had clearly done something bad but he didn't know what it was, why was everyone so mad at him!
He stretched on his chair and rubbed his eyes, trying to shoo the sleepiness away from him. But it just seemed to grow by the second. He didn't want Hermione to feel bad that he wasn't listening to what she was saying. He was sure she was saying something important, but he just couldn't seem to care.
, Potter's cheeks pinked again, did he have a condition or something?For some reason, Draco was tempted to put his hand on Potter's forehead, checking his temperature, but that was ridiculous.
He had overheard the conversation between Weasley and Potter, Potter had managed to get through Weasley's thick skull, he was impressed. They would ask him soon, the perfect moment to form a friendship. The Halloween feast was coming up soon anyway, the sooner he got rid of Quirell, the better, he had to preserve Potter's innocence, at least until 4th year.
Draco sat down on the stairs in the hallway. He curled in on himself, put his arms around his legs and put his head on his knees. He didn't have time to do anything else before someone came barrelling down the stairs.
"No! Why would I know who your father is?" He seemed both shocked and horrified at the idea of her not knowing who her father was.
Peter Pettigrew, the human embodiment of a cockroach, was missing. The man who was responsible for something major this year. Draco still didn't know what happened this year, but he knew that it had something to do with the whomping willow. He needed more data.
"Ms. Granger! This is completely unacceptable! You will report to me for detention today at 8:00 pm."
"It'll be alright, Hagrid." Anthony offered empty comfort. Luna looked over at Draco and let out a sigh.
"That's it," Draco said under his breath. He looked over at the Golden Trio; they hadn't noticed and his epiphany they didn't seem to be paying attention to him.
"Thanks, Draco." Harry smiled, it was all teeth. Draco still wasn't used to hearing Potter call him by his first name, yes, Draco did sometimes refer to Potter by his first name in his thoughts, but he only called him by his first name in reality because Potter had specifically asked for it.
Right after Lunch was Care of Magical Creatures. Sadly, it wasn't a class Draco shared with the others, so he met with the other Ravenclaws he had taken to hanging out with: Luna Lovegood, Terry Boot, and Anthony Goldenstein.
"Where're you going?" Terry yelled when he noticed Draco leaving, more confused than angry. It looked like he was cooling down.
He grabbed a book from the shelf and began flipping through the pages, ignoring them all until he landed on the one with a moving picture of a blue rose.
Draco sat in his room, talking to Tom, no one else was in the dorm, so he didn't need to worry about anyone hearing him, Tom didn't like it when people interrupted them, and Draco didn't like it either
A few of the teachers rushed up to help Harry. He was holding his arm; it was clearly broken. Draco wasn't worried about the broken arm; what he was worried about was that Lockhart was the one healing it.
But now? He had a manual. For flirting! He had to admit, Purebloods really did think of everything--
Potter made his way off the stool and went to sit next to his friend, the Gryffindor table took quite a long time to quiet down.
"Interesting." Mr Granger looked like he carried the same hunger for knowledge that Draco did, he loved being able to educate people without coming across as snotty or prude.
"Excellent, Ravenclaw is just full of sharp and clever minds, isn't it. Another ten points to Ravenclaw."
Draco put away his notes and got off of the couch, following Harry, he didn't know where the ghost's party was.
He had explained it to her, how he too, faced prejudice based on his family. But it was different with him, people didn't pity him as they pitied her, they looked at him with hatred, how could you hate an 11-year-old boy?
"Anyways, I have to get to my dorm, I have a lot of homework to catch up on." They all nodded, Draco wasn't lying, he did actually have two days of homework to catch up on, but it wasn't like it was hard, it was first year work for Merlin's sake.
Shortly after he had sat down, the Headmaster came into the room, and all the memories of that faithfull day came back in an instant, the astronomy tower, Dumbledore falling, his stomach filled up with dread almost immediately.
He leaned over to see what they were talking about. He saw Granger's timetable and his eyes widened. It was insane! No one could do that. Sure, he could think of a few ways to do it but all of them, he felt, would be putting to much work into classes. Hermione was already a top student, only under Draco. She didn't need to overwork herself just because she wanted to learn more. She could just ask for a few extra lessons onf the weekends or maybe some extra work over the holidays!/p>
"There are a lot of Wrackspurts around you, Draco. But don't worry! We can fix that!" Luna smiled, and that was how he found himself laughing for the first time in quite a while.
Hermione raised her head to see Draco Malfoy standing above her with a worried look on her face. She scowled, why did he care, he had stood by while Ron had told her off, so why would he care now.
It took a second, but soon, Fluffy was fast asleep, and Draco's lungs felt like someone had punched him in the lungs.
Seamus smiled and led him to Hermione's room. "We're not supposed to be in the girl's dorms, but I don't think McGonagall will mind if you're helping someone out," Seamus told him, and then left.
This time, Tom paid attention to him. "Voldemort is my past, present and future." He smirked and turned around, using Draco's wand to write words in the air.
"Where is the bloody classroom?" Harry asked for the thousandth time. Draco was right next to him, smiling and giggling ever so slightly whenever they took a wrong turn. Sure,
"Make sure you come to me every time you need it, sans you go to a discount potions shop that has absolutely no idea what they're doing."
Draco nodded, his previous anger towards Potter had dissipated somewhat, he knew he was being irrational, but it was normal for him to just blame Potter for things. But this wasn't Potter, it was Harry, and blaming Harry for things wasn't right.
An elf with green eyes appeared instantly, it bowed and whispered in a shaky voice, "Yes Madam Malfoy?"
"Look, it says that spiders will flee from it, and remember the spiders that ran away at Hagrid's hut and at the window. It's a snake, so that explains the whole hissy voice thing in the pipes, and come on, it's a snake!" Ron shrugged.
"You're too nice for your own good sometimes, Draco." He almost laughed at that, no one thought him kind, let alone
Probably not, he didn't have a 'power that they knew not' back then, maybe being a Veela, but that wasn't a unknown power, (well, if you included seduction), male Veela's weren't unheardof, they were just extremly rare.
Dumbledore had made a speech about the Dementors and the twinkle in his eyes had been completely gone. It was the first time he had ever seen the Headmaster look mad. The man always looked composed and all-knowing. At the mention of Sirius Black, all eyes had turned to Harry, who looked confused.
Hermione nodded. She hadn't expected much from Dumbledore, she knew he spoke in riddles. Normally Hermione had a fun time trying to decode them, but right now she really just needed someone to tell her what to do. She didn't want to mess anything up anymore.
He wondered if he would have to go through the same struggles that Draco did, would he do everything the same way that Draco did or would he change because he wasn't Draco, or did he change as well, did Nott's personality change to match the old Draco's, if so, he would be easy to work with, Draco would just have to appeal to his vanity and suck up to him, a small price to pay, as well as a blow to his ego.
Harry looked over to see Ron lying on the floor, blood littered on his face, his wand, that he had just replaced, was on the floor in pieces. Harry's vision was starting to blur, the venom.
He flinched but looked back at Snape who was looming over him, looking at him with an accusing glare.
Draco was sitting with Terry, Anthony and Luna, talking about miscellaneous topics, when Nott entered the Great Hall. Draco knew when Nott entered because Terry nudged him with his elbow (with far too much force in Draco's opinion). Draco looked up to see almost everyone at the Gryffindor and, surprisingly, Hufflepuff table glaring at Nott. It looked like a lot of people cared about Hagrid.
And just like he had predicted, a few of the upper Ravenclaws had started giving him dirty looks, that was the thing, they were all obsorbed in soaking up as much knowledge as they possibly could, they didn't focus on much else.
"Jewlrey." He spoke truthfully, because he saw no advantage in lying and no consequence in telling the truth.
"Yup! We get to cheer on Gryffindor… unless... you don't want to cheer on Potter?" Anthony's face softened.
"Most people don't like having their mind invaded, Godfather." Draco snarled, looking down, that had come out harsher than he had intended, but he didn't care, mind reading was one of his hard limits, he hated it, it made him feel bare, everything that he had ever experienced was open, like a book, and he
of your arse, Weasley, we do have other things to do." Draco started walking forward, Hermione was right next to him, he had to admit that he was curious about what the next thing they had to face would be.
" He trailed off and looked in her direction, seeming amused. That was when she noticed that his eyes had a red tinge to them.
"How are we going to get to Hogwarts?" Harry looked absolutely crushed, no doubt his mind was going into overdrive, and for once, Draco was stumped, how would they get to Hog-
He had met the man who had written the book, and he had helped him, a weird man, but a sweet one. Draco believed his name was,
And so, when the day to go to Diagon Alley finally arrived, everyone in the Malfoy household - even the house-elves - breathed a gigantic sigh of relief. Lucius had given Draco an even larger amount of money than usual. After all, the man had too much pride to simply apologize.
"Well, at least no one on the Gryffindor team bought their way in!" Hermione seemed proud of her insult, and for some reason, Draco was enveloped in rage at that, he wanted to fight back, but he couldn't, it was as if his words were not his own, and he regretted them as soon as they came out of his mouth.
"Your friends are looking for you, Mr. Malfoy, we will have time to ask all the questions we need to when you are in better health, right now, you should go to your herbology class." McGonagall said, she was pointing to the door, practically kicking him out.
"I've seen all the stupid things you've done since first year. Why should this be any different?" Draco mumbled to himself. He gave Harry a once-over and shoved a stern finger towards him.
This certain author specialized in many Seer related subjects, Draco had done a bit of research on her and had learned that she had been rumored to have a seer relative, a close one, that would certainly explain why she had such reliable information on the subject, when Draco had first figured out he was a seer (6th year), he had found comfort in this woman's books, mostly because of how accurate the information was.
Hermione yelled again. Streaks of fire came out of her wand and hit the Diary. The fire stayed there for a good thirty seconds before disappearing. She inspected it, looking for the slightest blemish, but nothing. The Diary was perfectly fine.
"He's been acting... odd lately," Draco said, reminiscing about all the times Harry seemed to look away and the stares he received in the Great Hall. Even when Draco sat at the Gryffindor table, Harry's eyes never seemed to leave him.
before. Hermione was still looking at him with suspicion, Harry and Weasley looked confused, they didn't know how advanced the spell was, there was no way a normal first year would be able to perform one.
"Dumbledore is out on emergency Ministry business today." McGonagall narrowed her eyes, looking at Draco.
." He ground out, looking at Draco, expecting him to apologize, not like that would do any good, he was going to stand his ground.
"Yes, that is why we're here, Severus, we don't believe that the punishment should be too severe, Minerva has already agreed to put them in detention for one week as well as take away 50 house points." Dumbledore smiled.
Narcissa Malfoy sat in her living room, still in shock from the letter she had just written. A part of her was gaping at the fact that she had just granted permission for a
After a few minutes of frantic searching, he clutched the diary to his chest, muttering under his breath. "Sorry," he gasped, "sorry, Tom, I'm so sorry-"
He heard someone clear their throat, they let him go and he turned around to see Lucius Malfoy glaring down at him.
Entering his dorm, he dumped all his books and materials on his bed, the others that were in the room didn't pay him much mind, they were all too absorbed in what they were doing. A nice change to all the nosy Slytherin's.
Draco knew he shouldn't tell inanimate objects about himself, but what would it do, tell someone? That was impossible, no one would get their hands on the book as long as Draco kept it on himself at all times, and having something or
"Breakfast's ready!" Fred called out, and they both left the room, Draco didn't wait long to follow them, he didn't even know where they were but he supposed it would be where the Weasley's lived.
"Yeah Hermione, I got to go to the loo, I'll be right back, alright?" Draco didn't wait for her to answer, he was closing his trunk.
And it scared him. It scared him because he couldn't trust himself to come close to Hermione, Ron or Harry. He didn't want to hurt them, but at the same time,
It started off as normal: the Slytherins were cheating, while the Gryffindors were trying their best not to fall off their brooms. Gryffindor scored most of the time-- the Slytherin Keeper was trash.
If anything, he should be worried about Granger, but no, he was worried about Potter, because he knew his track record, absolutely no self-preservation this one.
" He hissed out the word, his face sneering in disgust as if saying the word brought him physical pain.
That was all he needed to know. He looked out the window and saw watched the Manor become smaller as they rose higher.
"Oh, Potter's got a boyfriend now?" Draco recoiled at the sound of a new voice, letting go of Harry he looked over at the person who had made that stupid comment and cringed when he saw Nott, smirking.
"Trained?" He asked. He had a few ideas as to what she was referring to. But he had no idea why he needed to be trained.
"Why are you here?" Draco rasped, and oh, his voice sounded horrible. That was Draco's voice, but he sounded like a Kneazle who had just coughed up a hairball.
He walked over to where he had hidden The Diary under his desk drawer and pulled Tom out. There was a quill and inkbottle on top of it of the nightstand. He didn't know where it came from, he hadn't put it there.
"So you have chosen to study Divination." She gave Hermione a look, one much different from the one she had given Draco. Her eyes hardened just a tad and her smile faltered the slightest bit. The words that Trelawney had said in the last timeline suddenly came back to him, as well as how much Granger had complained during this class.
Draco nodded and opened his mouth to say something about his father when Ron suddenly broke into a round of uncontrollable laughter.
It wasn't supposed to happen again, what had he done wrong? Was this another fixed point, did it have to happen?
Quirrel started unwrapping his turban, revealing a shrivelled up looking face that was attached to the back of his head, the face of Voldemort, he looked - he looked so weak. He heard Harry inhale beside him, he held his scar again, looking at Draco in worry.
"That's disgusting." He whined, looking at Hermione, then he noticed his surroundings, looking around, he asked,
"Why didn't you use the rooster, you idiot?!" Draco ignored his question and continued to yell at him in a wobbly voice.
, there was limited knowledge on Seer's in general, but it was speculated that the amount of energy it would take for the eye to force the vision's out would be enough to force a prophesy out of the Seer, and that was what happened to Draco, that was why he had felt so exhausted after the prophesy, because it was forced.
They had been hanging out more frequently lately, studying together, where Draco desperately tried to teach Potter how to do the simplest of potions, and he did, of course, fail at that, but he was determined to teach Potter how to pay attention in potions.
"There hasn't been a Male Veela in over a century Mr. Malfoy, you are very lucky to be presenting." Flitwick got a book from his shelf, he breathed out on it and a cloud of dust formed, it looked like a very old book.
"You may not have seen me before. I find that descending into the hustle and bustle of the school clouds my Inner Eye." She gave Draco a pointed look at that. Draco raised an eyebrow in response. Perhaps she was telling him to do the same.
"You were seen by no less than seven Muggles!" Professor Snape lectured them while Draco was still leaning against Harry for support.
"What do you mean you can't tell me?" Hermione held his wrists, she had clearly been thinking about this for the whole time he was gone. Harry and Weasley nodded, Hermione must have educated them about how advanced the spell really was, and now they needed to know too.
"No," Draco said briefly and Nott stopped laughing, looking at Draco with a confused expression, Draco knew what it meant, he knew that Nott was wondering why Draco wasn't being mean to him, and that was exactly what he wanted him to think.
He dodged the basilisk just barely. It seemed to only be going for him and was ignoring Ron entirely. Ron's eyes were closed and he was running the other way. "Ron!" Harry called.
The little bugger bit him. Draco shook his finger and shoved the plant into its pot, he hated Mandrakes.
Harry, Ron and Hermione sent him grateful looks. Draco noticed that many of the Ravenclaws were giving him a thumbs up and even a few Slytherins were sending him hidden looks of gratitude. That would help his popularity.
Harry looked over to see a tall boy with curly dark brown hair standing in the shadows. He was wearing Slytherin robes and was holding Draco's wand. He didn't have to think, he knew who this was.
"Lucius doesn't know, he would done much more already if he already knew." They all knew what Lucius Malfoy would do if his own son was a seer, it was fortunate that he didn't know, otherwise they would have much more trouble.
Draco silently put a hand on her shoulder. He still wasn't good at the whole ‘comforting his friends’ thing. Luna sent him a grateful look. Apparently, she knew this too. He really had to work on his social skills.
He hadn't forgotten the prophecy he had told all the way back in their first year. One day, he would go to the Department of Mysteries and figure out what it was about. The memories of that day were still fuzzy.
Finally, they got some help from a portrait. Sir Cummemberg or something? Overall, he was rather overdramatic.
"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearing, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future."  Professor Trelawney kept on going as her eyes leapt from face to face. Finally landing on Draco, she gave him a smile.
"Draco, mate, dear friend of mine..." Terry started, "Why exactly do you want us to break a rule that would almost surely get us expelled?"
Snape looked at him, he was mad, but he didn't deny it because he knew that it was true, and so did everyone else in the room.
Potter, but he had come to regret that, and even then he hadn't felt such rage towards him. He had wanted Potter to hurt... but now… he wanted to
"I want you to make sure Hagrid doesn't get fired and that the Hippogriff doesn't get executed," Draco repeated, a fire in his eyes Lucius had only seen in the most stubborn of Gryffindors.
They entered a long tunnel with statues of snakes lining the sides of the hall. Their mouths were open and their fake tongues were out, hissing at them. The floor was decorated with a checker pattern; all in all, it was pretty fancy. A bright light shone at the end of the hall.
The twins started snickering and winked at Ron for some reason, who winked back. Draco groaned; this was turning out to be quite a day; to think that just moments ago he was laying down in the soft grass, contemplating his existence, but the Weasley's just
"You wound me! Betrayal! By my own friend!" he wailed. The Ravenclaws around them rolled their eyes in fond exasperation. It was often joked that Terry belonged in Gryffindor with Fred and George Weasley, but everyone knew his drive for learning new things was that of a Ravenclaw. Terry himself often mentioned how the Hat had said that he was a perfect combination between a Gryffindor and a Ravenclaw. It was less mentioning and more bragging.
"Draco." Someone called out his name again and he shut the book. He looked to see who it was and surprise, surprise, it was Hermione, that fucking
"What! And you're just going to forgive Weasley? After everything he's said to you? I mean, I get Harry, he's a great person, but
Tom turned to a statue of Salazar Slytherin and began to speak, but this time his words were slightly warped and had a hissing edge to them,
"Draco!" Harry, Ron and Hermione were running up to him, well, Harry was running up to him, Ron and Hermione were running after Harry (when had he started referring to Potter as 'Harry'.)
"Take your soul?" He asked in a small voice. It sounded so vulnerable that Draco was brought out of his reverie as he stared at Harry in concern. Had the Dementors affected Harry this much in the last timeline?
Draco looked at her, a hand on his face, desprately trying to keep himself from bursting into a fit of laughter.
"Hmm..." He drawled, ignoring his question yet again he looked at Draco, who was still in Harry's arms.
All of their uniforms changed. The red lining changed to blue while the badge that proudly presented the Lion of Gryffindor changed to a thoughtful looking Raven. Hermione didn't know how a Raven could look thoughtful, it just...did.
For some reason she blamed Draco for her detention, as if it was his fault that she decided to be a good friend, but forget about that, he had to tell her that Weasley and Potter were actually planning to try and make up with him, she would either be happy for him or start telling him about how much of a trash human being Weasley was.
"Yes! He's friends with a muggle-born, what do you say to that, you said he was just like his father, would his father do that?"
She wanted him to keep it? Just five minutes alone with it had given him such a strong vision. What could prolonged exposure do? Was this dangerous in any way? No, it couldn't be; Professor Trelawney wouldn't give it to him if it was. Well, he always did like a challenge.
Strangely enough, Nott and a few other Slytherins that were in his year had started talking to him, it wasn't like he talked back much. He spent most of his time with Lovegood nowadays, she didn't care about the gossip that went around the school, and, of course, Tom.
"Come on, Harry, let's go, we already did what Hagrid wanted us to do, we found the person drinking the Unicorn blood." Firenze winced at the Unicorn blood, Draco felt much the same way and had to steady himself while thinking about it, Unicorns were so pure and light that the mere thought of hurting one made him sick.
"That was how he did it!" Draco yelled, Potter put a hand on his mouth, muffling Draco's speech. Oh, that absolute prat, if Draco could talk to his Potter, he would ring his neck.
Draco got up onto the stage, walked up to Harry, and bowed. Harry hesitated for a moment before bowing as well. He clearly didn't know what he was doing.
"Mr Malfoy, I am pleased to say that your son has become one of my favourite students in all of my year in teaching, he is exceptionally skilled and I am sure that one day he will make an extraordinary wizard. His friendship with Hermione Granger is also helping Miss Granger's grades in my class, they made a terrific duo, Headmaster Dumbledore shares my expectations for them."
"You were given the gift." Firenze stated matter-of-factly. Harry was looking him again, but this time, he came closer and positioned himself in between Firenze and Draco.
He knew why the Eagle was changing its riddles, and it wasn't because he had answered the first year's riddles. Maybe the others knew it as well, but it wasn't likely, they weren't exactly above average, the most above-average Ravenclaw he had seen was Patil, and she wasn't a match for Hermione, he always did wonder why she didn't make it into Ravenclaw, perhaps because she was as loyal as a Gryffindor, or maybe because of her bravery.
He couldn't put the lives of so many people in a child's hands. Potter already had enough of a burden and Draco couldn't add to it, even more so now that he knew how little self-preservation he had. As well as the situation with the people he was forced to go back to every summer.
She looked at Draco (who looked paler than a sheet of paper). His eyes were wide and clouded with fear and suspicion. They had a glassy look to them, and his mouth was open slightly. He was taking shallow breaths. She glanced at Harry and Ron, who were standing on either side of her, and saw the despair on Harry's face at seeing Draco look…
"But, it seems that I have points that I am to award." Dumbledore quieted them, and here it came, Dumbledore would give the Gryffindors points, and they would win, yes, his house wouldn't win either, but it was better than Slytherin winning, he didn't exactly have much house loyalty for them anymore.
The covers were yanked off of him, and he was hit by a rush of cold air, he was awake now. Looking over at the person who had so rudely woken him up, he was ready to chew them out, ready to make a scene,
"...Harry?" Draco's voice sounded so much smaller now. When Harry let him out of the hug, tears were streaming down Draco's face. Harry faltered.
Dobby's eyes widened with fear, he looked at him and then at his hand, he resisted for so long that he started to shake, Draco knew he wouldn't resist for much longer, he just had to be patient. Dobby took something out of his sack, a
Harry whispered, but his voice had a sort of ethereal tone to it, a different, quieter voice alongside Harry's in the background. Harry said a few other words after 'Don't' but Draco couldn't understand them... well, he could, but they didn't make sense. They had an element of hissing to them, but they sounded like random words strung together; gibberish.
He grabbed a quill and some ink, he should write in it, yes, he would write in it. He opened the book and wrote on the first page,
"It's eleven!" He yelled, his eyes going wide and his mouth dropping open, they had missed the bloody train.
Nott scowled and mumbled something under his breath that sounded distinctly like, "Blumbering oafs got lost."
"Oh, Merlin, I think I broke him." Potter mumbled, that was nice, Potter was using Merlin instead of 'God' as he had used to do.
They should've gotten rid of it. Should have thrown it into the forbidden forest and let it be eaten by the creatures that lived there. Maybe that would've done it.
"What? We can't be there already,” Hermione said, looking around. Draco looked up from his book, confused. This had happened last time, he was sure of it.
Dumbledore spoke as he sat down at his desk, the old wizard looked over at the teachers that were standing on either side of them, they had a hidden conversation with their eyes, and Dumbledore's expression sombered up.
Harry glanced at said book that was resting on the small table next to the Hospital bed. Draco couldn't bear to look at the book for longer than a minute. All the things he had told Tom, all the secrets he had divulged, and for what? Because he needed someone to talk to. He let his feelings cloud his judgement and that would
"My family managed to get out safely but... I'll never forget that day..." Draco watched in horror as Paulene began to break into silent sobs.
"You're always saving our arse, Draco." Ron said, but he didn't see how that was true, this was the first time he had saved Ron and Harry from any life-threatening situation.
"Are you sure you're all okay?" He asked for what felt like the millionth time. Luna only gave him a quick nod before going back to her lesson, waving her wand, trying to turn the mouse into a book.
They continued to walk through Diagon, they were just getting near Flourish and Botts, when they bumped into Hermione.
Dobby nodded and disappeared leaving a stunned silence behind him. Draco seemed oblivious to the tension, however, and he turned back to Harry with the same small smile on his face.
Draco glanced around him, it was nice to be with all of his friends again. Being in Ravenclaw hadn’t made it easy to hang out with them.
"You don't want to go home on the holidays. Don't think I haven't read about how some muggles react to magical children,
Ron waited for a moment before gagging as well. "Oh," he moaned, and ran into another stall, shutting the door as well.
"I want you to smuggle Harry out of the castle for the trip to Hogsmeade," Draco repeated himself, looking far too pleased for someone having a psychotic break.
"Hey, Dray, Hermione, Ron and I wanted to tell you this after we got rid of the dragon, but you know.." He trailed off, but Draco got the idea.
Hermione interrupted him, "Draco, I know that you're close with Snape, but he's not who you think he is, I didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew that it would hurt your feelings, but you have to believe us."
She hesitated for a moment before nodding and putting it over her. "I'll be right behind you," she muttered, and they nodded at where they thought she was.
"What?" Draco asked. Yeah, he was blushing. But it was out of embarrassment. What else could he be blushing about?
The tears fell onto Harry's wound and they burned for a second, but only for a second. Then, the pain that was flooding his veins started to fade. It was so quick that Harry had to get his bearings. His ears were no longer ringing and he could hear someone yelling.
But Lucius wasn't killed by magic, that would elimate any chance of him making it back, but maybe he still found a way, his paranoid mind wouldn't let him be at rest, to many things had come unexpectedly that he couldn't not think of everything.
"One of us has to be calm. Harry'll freak out as well if I start," Hermione whispered back, making sure Harry wasn't able to hear. Draco admitted she was probably doing the right thing and Draco should do the same thing. But he just couldn't fight the sense of foreboding that had seemed to make itself home inside him.
Why did he say that? He didn't want to, but he knew that he was going to, why didn't he stop himself from saying that? It was like someone was forcing the words out of his mouth. Draco scoffed, like that explanation would hold up against Hermione, it didn't make sense to even himself.
"Don't worry, it's okay." Draco continued to rub circles on Harry's back, it was a tad bit awkward, but he could get through that.
"Of course, Headmaster, if you hadn't called me down, I probably would have come here myself. Speaking of coming here, I had a question.." Draco let himself trail off and looked away, seemingly nervous (he was, but not about what they were thinking).
This was one of the few classes Draco had with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Draco sometimes had DADA with them but those classes had been horrible lately. DADA had always been a horrible class. The only exception would be this year. As much as he hated to admit it, the man was a competent teacher. They had actually learned things in his class, and they had been
, Draco was already so far behind with the whole Diary thing. She knew that he needed his sleep, but he also needed to
She had tried everything! Most of her day was spent trying to destroy the bloody thing. She worked on it so much that the Gryffindors were used to hearing her scream
Harry looked at him in confusion but Draco just shook his head, asking Harry to trust him and was surprised at how willingly he complied. Draco pushed through the crowd of people who were now buying their own books and made his way over to the Weasleys and the Grangers.
He wobbled to his feet and staggered to his trunk, picking it up as Harry and Ron chased after the car, apparently it was going into the dark forest.
"Because there's something wrong!" Harry yelled at them again, they hadn't believed him for so long that he was exasperated.
"There's just one problem." Hermione interrupted, looking slightly put off. Harry's stomach did a little flop.
"I must commend you on your courage, Mr. Potter. If it wasn't for you and Mr. Weasley, Mr. Malfoy wouldn't be here with us right now," Flitwick said sincerely.
"Remember, the match, we had asked you to come but you had said that you were busy?" Harry looked confused.
Right when he was about to knock on the door, Flitwick opened it, and Draco started at seeing how happy the man was, yes, it was normal to see the man in his usual happy mood, he had never seen the man this happy and excited.
"Thank, Hermione." He nodded. Then he looked over at Ron and Harry who were still on their arse's, did they need someone to tell them to get up, or did they just want to fall asleep here because Draco had absolutely no objections to that idea, let it be a lesson for making him bust a lung while trying to lullaby a three-headed monster to sleep.
"I'm telling you Harry, I've searched the whole library and I can't find a single book that mentions hi-"
Draco quickly lost that train of thought. He wouldn't think about that disastrous year until the mysteries surrounding this one were gone.
"Thank you!" they both yelled at the same time. Draco shuddered to think what would happen if they teamed up with the Weasley twins. Total anarchy. Anthony and Terry spent their spare time coming up with prank ideas, ‘just in case.’ They had a whole portfolio filled with pages upon pages of pranks. Good thing they were too lazy to actually go through with them.
The older girl looked shocked. She had mocked him about how long he spent in the library, she had dared him to bring her a book that hadn't been in the library for quite some time, he had found it in a chamber in the school, it was quite close to the library, how it got there was beyond him.
"I tried," Harry said as they walked out of the store, they were in Knockturn Alley, as twelve-year-olds, amazing.
"Dobby!" He called, his suspicions were confirmed when the elf didn't appear immediately, and when he did, he was frantically shoving something in his clothing.
. But magic alone will not help you in a fight with a boggart. You must imagine something funny and you must imagine that your fear is turning into something that you can laugh at. Something that isn't so scary anymore, just a faded reminder of what that thing once was."
Draco hesitated before raising his hand again, McGonagall seemed frustrated that he was the only one participating, probably because he was getting everything right. She sighed before she called on him once again.
"What have you done to my godson!" Snape yelled at them and Harry's train of thought did an abrupt one-eighty.
?" She tried to mock him, but Draco was getting unreasonably mad at her, he knew he shouldn't be, but why was he. If he stayed near her for much longer, he would yell at her, and he didn't want to do that, he had to getaway.
He wouldn't think like that. He knew he shouldn't judge others for what they couldn’t controll. It was the person that mattered, not what they were. From what he had seen and heard, Lupin was the nicest DADA professor they had had. But... he still couldn't get the image of Greyback out of his head. The way he had stood above the houself as she screamed and begged and he cackled as his teeth sunk into her jugular. When he had seen Draco watching with a look of horror and grinned evilly at him.
Hermione rushed to help him but was stopped when Harry yelled, "No! Don't move, don't forget, we're still playing." He looked calculating, for Merlin's sake, it was just one more move, there was nothing else to even think about, there was no reason to be making such a big fuss.
Luna walked over to the wardrobe with a smile on her face. It didn't take long for the boggart to come out.
Draco sat in front of Professor Trelawney. He still hadn't had a single vision since the beginning of the year. He had given it a bit more time, but it was now November, and he still hadn't had one. Asking Professor Trelawney was the only option he had left.
Harry whined again, Draco wasn't talking to him, and by the looks of it, he didn't plan to for quite some time. The thought hurt Harry, he wanted Draco to
Professor McGonagall whipped around, her lips pursed. But what worried Harry the most was how... less cheery the Headmaster looked. The twinkle in his eyes was gone and his normally mysterious smile was replaced by a deep frown. Harry knew something was wrong.
"Fascinating." Dumbledore breathed out, he whipped out a peice of parchment and a quill and started writing with it.
"They're definitely going to get together." Draco nodded. But it probably wouldn't happen until Sixth Year, and even then, there had been that awful relationship with Lavender Brown. He couldn't stand to see those public displays of affection. He could probably identify Weasley's tonsils by now.
A pop sounded and the elf appeared again, holding out a letter with shaky hands, Narcissa grabbed it and showed it to Lucius, who started reading it out loud.
Harry looked at Hermione, maybe she had noticed that something was wrong with Draco too, she was looking back at him, and he knew that she noticed it as well, he didn't bother looking at Ron, because he knew that he wouldn't have noticed, Ron wasn't that perspective.
This last week had been hectic, with all the schoolwork as well as writing down his knowledge of what happened this year. He couldn't let a repeat of last year happen, that had been a major screwup.
And as always, Harry would frown but nod and would look away but shoot him looks, worry obvious on his face. Hermione and Ron had gotten closer over the summer and were currently talking together but Hermione did ask how he was feeling while Ron would poke at him about using his fireplace to call their house.
Now, Hermione rushed over to help Ron. Harry looked over at her, "You help Ron, Draco and I will stop Snape." He spoke gallantly, Harry was really working himself up. Hermione nodded and continued to try and help Ron, Harry tugged him along and they made their way to the door, slowly creeping in.
Draco thought. He knew that Severus would show his affection in different and subtle ways. Sometimes, you would have to look into his every action and pick them apart looking for his ulterior motive. Severus never did anything on a whim. It was odd to hear about him doing something so forward. Where the reason why he did it was just so glaringly obvious.
He swung the sword at the basilisk, just grazing the its head. It wasn't strong enough though, it wasn't deep enough. He needed to cut it deeper, he needed to get a direct hit in. He couldn't do that when he was just seconds away from slipping from this statue.
"I don't know, he fainted after something hit him in the head, Snape gave us these potions to give him." Ron showed Hermione the potions.
When his father checked his phone a few more times than he was supposed to during family dinner, he knew he would have to stay in his room for the rest of the night.
"But, I really am sorry for what I said at Madame Malkins, Potter, I was just being a brat then and I don't have an excuse for that." He bowed slightly, god he would have to start doing that.
Before he knew it, Halloween came around, and he wasn't going to attend the feast, he would rather be in his room, reading and talking to Tom, nowadays, he didn't even need to write, he could just talk to Tom, and read what Tom wrote back.
Draco was just getting ready to leave when he heard Ron scream in fear, he looked over at him and saw a red envelope in his hand.
Suddenly, something glowed in the distance. It was close, just close enough for Harry to get it. He didn't know what it was, but he had a feeling, and that was the best he could do right now!
"Because I've answered all the other ones I think, they are fun though." He tried to remain as childish as possible.
Terry kept quiet, a serious look on his face. If Anthony was being truthful, that scared him. Terry was always the one to lift the mood whenever something like this happened. But now, that job was up to Anthony. And that scared him more than his old bully at St. Peter's.
"I have to go ask Professor Snape something." He gestured to the head table where Snape's chair was clearly empty. Draco knew Severus would be in his lab brewing the Wolfsbane potion for tomorrow.
"Here you go." Flitwick dropped a bundle of books in his arms, he had requested a few from the man, and it looked like he delivered, many of the books were about Veela and Seers, and just a few were for his own pleasure reading.
"Now, enough of the Dementor talk. I'm going to get you some nice chocolate cake and you can tell me what you did over the summer, hmm?" Draco started to get off the bed when he noticed Harry wince out of the corner of his eye. Draco turned back to him with a raised eyebrow.
"We should probably get back to our dorms." Potter looked like he wanted to say something, he opened his mouth and closed it repeatedly, looking like a fish, that made Draco think of a fish with Potter's face, making him smile, it was a bit childish, yes, but Draco didn't care, it was nice to laugh at such small things.
Speedwalking over to Potter, Draco started to do what he thought would calm him down, rubbing his back and whispering in his ear, like his mother had done for him when he had nightmares,
"Come off it you two, listen Draco, I know you've got a thing with Flitwick soon, we'll come to you when we need your help, alright?" Ron asked him, and it wasn't alright, Draco wanted to ask them about Snape, had his own Godfather really tried to murder Harry, no, that couldn't be true because he was still a teacher in the original timeline! It had to be Quirell, but how had they managed to fuck that up.
, they needed to keep going forward. That was also a part of Divination: looking past what others told you to see, and deciding for yourself what was real and what you could really
The smile came back onto Terry's face soon, though. "But hey! If this person really is messing with you, we'll show him that he never messes with us Ravenclaws! That's what friends are for!"
for breaking the international statue of secrecy!" Draco smacked Weasley across the head, and despite the circumstances, Harry snickered as Ron frantically jammed a silver button.
They entered the castle, it was weird seeing it so empty. They were so close to the great hall when they were stopped by the squib, "Oh dear, we are in trouble."
As soon as he entered Herbology, the three of them, Harry, Weasley and Hermione surrounded him. Before he had the chance to say anything, Hermione asked him,
He didn't have to be close to see it: Lockhart had fucked up in some way. From where he was sitting, he couldn't get a good look at it, but something was wrong with Harry's arm.
Hermione was panting. Her face was drained of colour, her eyes blown wide. Adrenaline was running through her veins and her heart was hammering in her chest. She had barely heard Ron's question. "It-It was Draco. Something's wrong with him--the book."
McGonagall was so stunned that she didn't even call out the next name until the Headmaster called out her name.
He walked over to Anthony's bookshelf. Anthony had been rather interested in flower language ever since he had started wooing Luna. Luna absolutely loved the language of flowers so he had many books about them. It wouldn't take too long to find the meaning of a blue rose.
Harry stopped in his tracks when he saw Draco standing next to Mrs Norris, the cat wasn't moving, and something was clearly wrong, given how pale his face was. Ron and Hermione stopped when they saw Draco, Hermione was looking at the cat while Ron was looking at Draco with his eyes narrowed.
His face was paler than ever. His hair wasn't tied in his normal ponytail, instead being draped on the floor. Everything about him looked dead.
Just so you guys know, I've found an amazing Beta, so I'll be revising some of earlier chapters. Chapters may take longer to come out, but that does give me ample time to write further chapters.
"I have no need to go to Hogsmeade. I could stay with you if you needed me to." Draco offered again.
Professor Sprout started talking but Draco wasn't paying attention, right now he was only thinking of the prophesy he had predicted and what it meant, he was suddenly aware of the massive headache he got whenever he thought of it, he would need to think about it later.
Potter was looking at him, and Draco was suddenly aware of how unnaturally green Potter's eyes were, how much pigmentation did the boy have? Draco felt his cheeks getting hot, but he didn't know why, he wasn't embarassed, was he? Draco cleared his throat, trying to break the awkward eye contact.
"Arthur." Lucius drawled, and Draco snapped his head back so fast he was surprised it didn't make a cracking noise.
Harry whispered again. This time, the snake obeyed and turned away from the Hufflepuff completely. Snape chose this moment to act and vanished the snake.
"The blue rose, a flower of the genus Rosa and family Rosaceae, symbolizes hope for an unlikely or unrequited falling in love. In this way, it can also signal someone waiting for a miracle. In short, it means falling in love..."
He rembered how little Draco had confided in his Godfather that he wanted to be in Slytherin, it must have come as a surprise to him when he started chanting 'Not Slytherin', but if it worked for Potter, it would sure as hell work for him, and it did, even though it did consider Gryffindor for a moment.
Draco opened his mouth to say something before closing it and taking a deep breath. It wouldn't do good to lecture Harry without a cup of tea first. He would need it to hear what he knew would be an absolutely ridiculous story.
Draco yelled out in frustration, Dobby would continue taking his mail, how would he talk to Harry. Harry was a fragile boy, he overthought the smallest things and didn't think other things through, he was frustrating, but Draco had to protect him, and that meant keeping Harry happy, or at least, as happy as was possible for him.
"Mr. Malfoy, this must be a tough time for you, but we have to ask, what do you remember from your vision?" Dumbledore asked, and Draco actually did have to stop, because what did he remember? He remembered flashes of things, most of them were jewlrey, except for a cup, Potter had mentioned something, but Draco couldn't remember, he barely remembered anything Potter had said, it was if the memories were leaving him, and he didn't like that.
Hermione was all over him in an instant, snatching the potions from Ron, who had taken them back, not giving Draco any time to think about what was happening before she was shoving potions down his throat.
He swallowed and tried to ground himself, pushing the thoughts of Draco out of his mind, he focused on Tom "....The mandrake draught will be prepared in a few hours. Everyone who's been petrified will be back," Harry said in triumph.
, the Nicolas Flamel who was the man behind time travel, that Nicolas Flamel? How had he been involved in the golden trio's lives? Did he play an even bigger role than Draco had thought?
Malfoy didn't seem the slightest bit put off by Davies hidden insults or his accusations, he remained calm.
Draco glanced at the book on the desk, he knew that there were things that he didn't know about Veela, and he was excited to learn about them, if he didn't know about the ability of fighting the Allure, he could only think about how many things he could learn from that book.
"And you didn't even tell a teacher! What if you had died in there?! They wouldn't even be able to find your corpse, you know why? Because no one else is a
Draco recognised the author, he had passed away in his timeline in Draco's 4th year, a sad sight, but Draco hadn't known him then, perhaps he would be able to meet him now, perhaps.
"I know. Despite what you and Hermione think, I'm not completely an idiot." Harry laughed but Draco could see something serious in his eyes.
Draco was sitting with Anthony and Terry. They had been dragged into this 'duelling club' that Lockhart had started. Draco hadn't wanted to go because Lockhart had asked them to come (he liked Lockhart as much as Snape liked Harry Potter, which is to say, not at all). But when he had mentioned extra credit, Terry agreed right then and there, dragging Anthony and Draco along with him.
Harry collapsed. Ron's eyes widened as he caught him just in time. Harry tried his best to stay quiet but he couldn't. Ron swore under his breath and led them both out of the room. Harry saw Lockhart entering the room through his blurry vision and faintly heard him say, "What did I miss?"
Harry startled, looking at Draco. He shot both of them an apologetic smile and said something to the girl before running over to Draco with his luggage.
It didn't take long for Draco to recognize the man as Remus Lupin. The werewolf. His prejudice towards werewolves hadn't gone away in the slightest. But that was to be expected when you had Fenrir fucking Greyback in your house for a year.
"I was really looking forward to this class," she moped. It was odd, seeing Luna in such a down mood. Normally, she was the one who offered comfort, no matter how odd it was. She was always the person that made you feel better or made you laugh when you needed it. And half the time, she wasn't even trying.
"It wasn't him, he was fighting something, it wasn't him." Hermione would put her hands in her face if she could.
Looking at Draco's face right now, though, reminded him of the small moments where his friend would reach out to him in his own way.
"Figure something else out, until then, you will not yell at him, we will find a solution." Narcissa's words held a tone of finality, this conversation was over and Draco was excused, he should leave.
"Not you too," Draco sighed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had been acting this way as well. It was getting annoying and quickly. Draco didn't like not knowing things. He wasn't used to it!
Ron nodded, "Yeah, I mean, we might not have Draco, but you're bloody brilliant. You'll figure something out, and we'll help you. Maybe I was wrong about Malfoy..." Ron trailed off, looking guilty but thoughtful.
The flood of relief that overwhelmed him when Draco opened his eyes was like nothing he had ever felt before, even though the pain from the bite was rapidly spreading, it seemed dull in comparison to the happiness he was feeling right now.
"I don't know." Draco tilted his head slightly, thinking it over in his head. If he remembered correctly, Harry hadn't gone to Hogsmeade last time. He grimaced at the reminder of his first Hogsmeade. That was a weekend he would never forget, if only for the sheer embarrassment that had accompanied it.
If you're confused on how I described the bowing, it's much like how they used to bow in the past centuries, it's a gentleman's bow and a lady's curtsey.
Didn't Hagrid hold a shindig for the students at his hut? But that could be one of the things he had done in Draco's time. He still got memories mixed up sometimes.
"Jeez, Malfoy, we get it, you're smart, no need to rub it in." One of the boys who was in the dorm looked up from his book, the others were all looking at him weird, but he was the only one who said anything, Draco thought his name started with a E.
Potter turned towards him and whispered in his ear, slowly, Weasley's expression changed, he looked horrified. He looked back at Draco with a look of pity.
Draco cringed, he couldn't let that happen, yes, he hadn't been close friends with Nott, but from what he remembered, Nott wasn't a complete prat. Another theory popped into Draco's head, would Nott feel the same way Draco had felt, did being a fixed point mean that he would feel the same way the previous fixed point was meant to feel, did different people affect the timeline itself-
He had been having weird interactions with Potter, it seemed that Potter couldn't get over his shyness around him, he was rather bipolar, sometimes he didn't talk at all and looked as red as a tomato, and other times, he was telling everyone about how smart Draco was.
It made him feel... inconsequential. Like Draco would rather run back to his other friends than spend any time with him or the other Ravenclaws.
the Weasley's. His father sneered and scoffed every time he saw the familiar ginger hair in the fireplace but didn't comment on it. Sometimes, Draco thought Lucius might feel guilty of what he did. Sometimes, Draco found that he didn't give a fuck. Other times, it was nice to see him actually showing remorse for something.
"I should let you know that Mr Malfoy is already meeting with Dumbledore right now," Professor McGonagall said as she stepped onto the staircase with them. Hermione's ears perked up at that.
He had asked Hermione, hoping for answers, but she had just laughed and patted him on the back, giving him a look. Harry was never good at figuring out what Hermione's looks meant. Harry remembered the shows that he had seen when he had peaked a look at the telly, stories of a woman and a man falling in love, maybe it was the same with them-
"Come on, let's get the rest of our books." Draco started to say when he heard a very familiar drawl, and froze.
, a true seer, that would explain the advanced magic. But what the boy had said sounded terrifyingly close to what Sybill had said.
Luna giggled. "The Lovey Doveys have been talking with the Cupid babies about this, you know. They've been very excited. It's so rare for them to see a courting that they actually approve of."
"Tell Mr. Malfoy's friends that he's still in the Headmaster's office, please, Poppy." He politely asked Poppy.
"You can't stand not knowing things, and you do anything to make sure that you know the truth, but the flaw is that you don't trust anyone but yourself, well, you did trust me before, but that was broken when you realized that I had secrets, so, you use Legilimency to get the truth." Draco answered, there was no point in holding back, he was mad at Snape, Draco wasn't an eleven year old in mind, he knew that he was allowed to have his own secrets.
Either that or he was drunk, and that was rather ridiculous considering the fact that he was twelve years old, but Potter always was a notorious lightweight, Draco had mocked him for it multiple times.
"Draco!" Hagrid called out. The giant slowly came into view. But instead of the normal cheery grin he wore, he looked dejected. By the looks of the redness around his eyes, he had been crying. Draco didn't know the half-giant that well, but Harry must have been rubbing off on him, because he felt inexplicably worried about him.
"Yes, they were found on what would become Azkaban island. On the island was a fortress where an insane man lived. The creator of the Dementors. The only human that the Dementors never tried to kill. He died, but no one knows how." Draco said. Harry was slowly inching closer to him, like a child that was being told an interesting bedtime story.
"Imagine you making friends with a Malfoy, Weasley, better yet, imagine your father and my father being friends. Right, disgusting. Now, my father isn't exactly.. lenient when one dishonors his family name."
"Yes, he could do better, but look at this letter his Charms Professor sent, Draco has been getting private tutoring lessons from him." Narcissa handed her husband another letter.
"I don't know! If you were there then you would see! It's not our Draco--" Hermione stopped short when something occurred to her: they had left Draco in his time of need. Yes, he had called her that word, but he was her friend; she should have given him a chance to explain himself.
The sink shifted, it responded. Once the sink was out of the way, you could see a long passage going almost straight down into what felt and looked like nothing; like a slide. You couldn't see the bottom of it, it was pitch black. All except for the faint drop of water echoing around the space. The slide itself looked smooth, a stark contrast to the jagged rocks that lined the walls of the slide.
Harry looked at him in praise and astonishment, his glasses were crooked and his hair was more ruffled than normal. He was just about to say something when someone lifted him up,
Hermione's face brightened. "Yes! It is! Come on." She ushered them out of the room, but before she closed the door, she looked back at Seamus.
, everyone was, his father didn't have that look in his eyes, that defeated look, one that bordered on complete insanity. Mother looked like her old self again, she looked a thousand years younger, like she had before the war, before everything had gone so horribly wrong. And Draco, Draco was happy, he was
"She. Is. Sensitive!" Draco yelled and made his way towards the girl's bathroom, Potter and Weasley folllowing close behind him.
"Normally, a Dementor would suck out the soul of any human being it came across. But his soul was so tainted that not even the Dementors wanted to take it." Harry's already pale face drained of what remaining color it had left as he gave Draco a look.
Ron stopped and spun around, terror on his face, "Harry! I told you to bring it. How are we supposed to get past the
Once they were all gone, Snape and McGonagall both leveled him with a look, Snape's was clouded with suspicion while McGonagall's had an hint of fascination and amazement, and just a bit of fear, why? Draco couldn't fathom.
"Dobby, we need a rooster. You should keep one with you, and when we call for you, bring it with you." Draco ordered in a high and mighty voice. It was odd, hearing him like that.
He didn't know if he had hurt the basilisk, but he knew that it was still chasing him. He didn't know what to do, he only knew a handful of spells!
This wasn't Draco. But that was impossible, they had separated the Diary from Draco. He hadn't been writing in it, so
know. He tried to figure it out but he didn't know why he said what he did, maybe he could tell Flitwick, but he would just think that he was making an excuse, but maybe he would believe him.
"I have to do something, I'll be right back." Draco smiled at them and left the room with his trunk in hand.
"Draco," he heard someone call. He looked over, expecting to see Trelawney or someone but instead, he saw... Harry?
"Hey! Leave him alone!" He whipped out his own wand, he knew he couldn't beat him, but it just felt right.
He had forgotten about that man too. He didn't know much about Sirius Black, only that he was a relative of sorts and wasn't guilty. His father had said multiple times that Sirius Black was definitely not a death eater.
"But I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances to the future." Hermione was gaping open-mouthed at her now. Both angry and humiliated.
"Draco, did I say something wrong?" Harry asked, despite the circumstances, Draco laughed, even now, Potter was still a self-conscious idiot, how had he changed so much over the years?
"We're taking the egg to Ron's brother, Charlie, we have to take the egg to the Astronomy tower and give it to Charlie." Hermione answered him, Draco cringed at the mention of the tower, terrible memories had taken place there, and the simple thought of going there made him sick.
"I understand that you must have questions but you must understand the reason as to why I did it," Dumbledore started.
Draco was touched, really, he was. Granger had gotten a detention defending him. Originally he had become friends with her because it would bring him closer to the golden trio, but the more he got to know her, the more she actually grew on him, she wasn't a know-it-all like everyone thought her to be, she was a really sweet and bright girl.
When he couldn't understand how he had stopped the glass from hitting the floor and his parents were looking at him in horror...
"These grades are satisfactory at best, I don't see why you're showing me this, Narcissa, he is still in Ravenclaw." Lucius ground out, and Draco scoffed in his head, he would never be satisfied, Draco hadn't tried his best because he didn't want to look like a prodigy, he liked the attention, yes, but too much of it would get in his way.
Also, I'm sorry that all my chapters are unbeta'ed, my Beta is, of course, in Quarantine and we only ever Beta our chapters together.
And there was the whole Veela thing. He had to talk to Professor Snape about potions. He couldn't brew them in his house without suspicion and he couldn't brew them in the potions lab for the same reason. He already knew Snape was giving Lupin Wolfsbane. When his Veela side fully matured on his fourteenth birthday, he would need a few sets of potions. Just a few to keep the Sleazes away.
"Not like we'd let anything get close to you," Draco said matter-of-factly. The Golden Trio had been alive and kicking in the last timeline; why shouldn't they be able to make it through this one? Besides, they had him as well. Nothing bad came out of having an extra the second go around.
"Oh, I'm sorry, do you have your own way of saying hello, do you bow?" Mr Granger did a very sorry excuse for a curtsey.
He looked back at the flower on his bed, why would someone leave this here? He walked over, carefully inspecting it. The thorns had been charmed so he could grab it just fine.
He was used to being able to figure everything out. He knew things before they were going to happen. Both because of his knowledge of the future and his visions. It was weird, not knowing what was going to happen. It was a feeling he hated. The last time he had felt so...unaware was last year.
In this case, Nott took Draco's place in the remembrall incident, meaning that he would most likely take Draco's place for all other instances that needed to happen, why Potter had to become a seeker, however, he did not know, perhaps it had to do with the fact that many things happened to Potter on the Quidditch pitch, a fixed point always helped protect another fixed point.
Hermione and Ron were there as well, but they were too busy insepcting the egg, he still didn't know why he was here.
Draco opened his mouth and tears began to blur his vision, his voice came out in a whisper, "I'm just so tired Professor, I don't get visions anymore, my eye's blocked, the words came out, I knew what I was going to say, but I couldn't stop it, I was just so...angry." By the end of the sentence, he was in complete tears.
Severus however, looked anything but amazed, he looked sad, and scared, a rare look on him, any emotion besides anger or disgust was rare on him, but fear was one that topped the list.
"Just because you can't understand it by spending days in the library doesn't mean it's ridiculous," Draco snapped, the tension from the day coming out.
He could see changes in himself already, his eyes had become more blue, like the sky on a sunny day, his hair had become more white and fine, and when he raked his hand through it, it felt like he was touching a cloud, his skin had become softer, like silk, and his teeth had become as white as paper.
Harry made an offended sound and Draco turned to him last, "And excellent job saving me, Harry." Harry's cheeks pinked at that, but it was true he had saved him, he didn't understand why he was embarrassed.
Hermione looked over at the door, " You put the key in the door to unlock it, Harry." Hermione snickered, apparently, Harry hadn't noticed the big, and locked door. Harry looked over at the door and sighed, walking over to the broom.
But the ring, what was the ring, all he knew about the ring was that Dumbledore couldn't wear it, he couldn't.
Speaking of Veela, he had to buy those surpressants soon, if the eye had already adjusted, his Veela inheritance should be coming soon as well. And to think that he had actually thought that it was gone, foolish, he would never be rid of the curse that was being a Veela.
Draco was awake now, he lifted his head to glare at the person in question, only to find the twins standing above him and the room lit up with sunlight, how long had he been sleeping? And why did his pillow have a heartbeat?
Potter's voice sounded far away, miles and miles away, Draco didn't care about what he was saying, he only cared about what the mirror was showing him.
"I saw, myself, any my family, happy." Draco stopped at that, there was no reason to elaborate, he would let Potter come to his own conclusions, that would be best.
"Draco." He wanted him to look him in the eyes, he wouldn't, he would never let anyone invade his mind again.
romance, Hermione." Harry rolled his eyes, seemingly mollified. Thank Merlin, it had taken him a good half hour to get that through his thick skull. But it had managed to take his mind off of Hogsmeade.
"That's fine, Luna and I are going to hang out with Terry, you can come to join us if you want, today must have worn you out, I mean, seeing someone who had been your best friend... doing that." Draco's head snapped up, and he nodded.
Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley stood on Platform 9 ¾. Harry was looking at them, hope in his eyes.
"Everyone out, except you, Mr. Malfoy." Snape comanded, Hermione and the other immediately started arguing with them, but they were silenced when both Snape and McGonagall glared at them.
"Draco?" Draco turned around so fast that Harry was astonished his head didn't fall off, he looked scared, his lips pursed.
A strange warmth filled his chest, he always did like when Harry complemented him, but for some reason, his heart sped up when Harry did it, it didn't speed up for anyone else, just Harry, maybe he had a heart condition.
"I find myself curious. Why exactly are you in possession of a Diary from one of my older students?" Dumbledore asked, his smile faltering a bit as he read the name inscribed on the bottom of the book.
"Now now, I believe we should leave Draco alone. The boy deserves to rest after all he's went through." Dumbledore raised his hands and pointed towards the exit. Flitwick and Dumbledore left while Harry and Lucius stayed behind.
"Y-Yes, young Master?" Dobby stuttered, and Draco narrowed his eyes, he didn't see what he had shoved in his sack, but he knew it was something incriminating.
"But it's impossible!" Ron started. Draco sighed, they were going to get into an argument. He rolled his eyes and turned his attention to Harry who was looking off into the distance. The Dementor attack had left them shaken.
"If we are not meant to know it, we will not know it, but, prophecies can be a bit, bendy with their rules, if the boy wants us to know, we shall." Albus spoke, a tone to his voice, this conversation was over.
Draco mirrored his expression. He remembered his first Hogsmeade. He still blushed from the humiliation.
"Draco's with him?" She wondered why Draco would be there; well, she had an idea for why he would be there. Maybe Dumbledore really did know about Draco's predicament.
Lupin quickly waved his wand and the boggart turned into a little dancing moon. Lupin forced the boggart back into its closet before turning back to the class. They all looked traumatized and Draco's friends were looking at him with clear horror and worry.
He hit the wall and all his luggage went flying, all the muggles surrounding the station looked towards them, and one of the ticket-takers started walking over to them, "Sorry sir, lost control of the trolley." Draco sent him away with a sheepish smile.
"Albus, this boy, he is powerfull." The fear in Minerva's eyes was clear, she was thinking of the boy she had once known, she was not scared of the young Malfoy that layed in front of her, she was scared of who he reminded her off.
"An omen of death, Harry. The worst omen of death." Draco's voice got smaller as images of Harry in various encounters flashed through his mind. What if he had done something that would make this year go different? It had already happened last year.
He knew he was dying. He was going to die. But he had saved Draco, he had saved Ron, he had saved his friends, just like he had said he would.
Draco yawned; he had had trouble sleeping yesterday. He couldn't help but feel like he was forgetting something. Something important. His memories of the past timeline were a bit harder to access now for some reason. And he hadn't really been privy to the Golden Trio's secrets before, so what he knew was mostly limited to the gossip that went around Hogwarts from time to time and the Daily Prophet.
That did make sense, he supposed. Lucius didn't exactly come off as loving at first glance, and sure Draco held a lot of resentment towards him. But that didn't mean he would just let people make these assumptions about his family.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. He didn't see how he could say no. He didn't even know what she wanted, but from the look on her face, he didn't think it was anything good. But Trelawney was always harder to read than most people. She always looked far away, like Lovegood.
"Oh, Harry. Ron and I have something we need to do together, will you both be fine alone?" Hermione said but she didn't wait for an answer before dragging Ron away and leaving them both alone.
Draco let out a sigh. He knew what would happen, but there was always that nagging feeling in the back of his mind: what if this time was different?
"No, I don't think you understand how amazing this is, Mr. Malfoy, you did a non-verbal spell on your first try, the Headmaster must know about this, but I have a proposition for you, I want to privately tutor you for charms."
Draco's housemates all cheered for him, even the upper years, it looked like he was accepted now, he smiled and looked over at Harry who was giving him a thumbs-up, looking elated.
Harry looked around. They were in the hospital wing. Hermione was laying down on one of the beds, frozen with a mirror in her hand and her eyes wide in terror. There was a large bandage on her left leg; it was clearly wounded.
"Come on!" Draco yelled at Harry. He was dawdling behind talking to that Weasley girl. There was that same prickling feeling as the one at Diagon Alley. He didn't like it. The Weasley girl was blushing every time Harry said something and was standing far too close for it to be just casual. He wondered what they were talking about.
Hermione sat on a chair at Hagrid's crying her eyes out, Hagrid handed her a tissue and she blew into it, a disgusting sound coming from it.
Draco looked at the doorway; students were slowly coming in. It looked like they were one of the first ones. He should have enough time to talk to whoever Luna wanted him to.
He made his way to the boy's dormitory, the common room was empty, Ravenclaw's didn't spend much of their time in their common room, Draco actually liked that, the common room was a nice place, and having it all to himself gave him another space to think comfortably.
Draco would be lying if he said that didn't make him feel warm. It seemed this person was actually doing their research and not just starting off with a red rose like a moron would. It wouldn't hurt to see where this went, would it?
"Petrificus Totalus!" she yelled, and was surprised when her voice came out clear despite the fear that was engulfing her.
"A new path shall be set for the equal, the prophesied shall meet a prodigy, born as the sixth month flourishes, two friends, once foes, shall carry the power to vanquish the one who has tainted their lives, one carries the power other's shall never know, nor shall they ever understand. So mote it be."
"Your hair grew at an abnormally fast rate. You have the shine that all Veela normally do, but it's dulled enough so that you can't see it unless you look closely. You're obviously not a full Veela. I'm assuming less than half as well. The magic is focused on your hair and face," he said in his usual drawl.
Harry didn't waste time. The fang that had bitten him lay on the floor and he picked it up, saving a quick glance up he saw Tom running towards him, worry on his face.
But that also meant telling Severus about his Veela heritage. His father had always been... less than amicable when it came to Veela. He had said a few choice words that had led to him wisely hiding his heritage from him. Unfortunately, Veela had been something his mother had agreed on with his father. So the only person he had left to go to was his godfather.
Dumbledore and McGonagall chose that moment to burst in, "Severus I know you're upset, but-" Dumbledore stopped in the middle of his speech as he noticed the lack of Professor and the unconscious male in Harry's arm.
The boy was born so close to the seventh day of the sixth month, a day that would have flourished, as the young Malfoy put it, he was the child from the Prophesy.
Draco had done a little bit of digging. He was a curious child after all; and had looked into a few Ministry files. He had seen that the man hadn't even been given a trial. There was no way to determine if he was guilty or not, but he was sure that the trial, or lack thereof, was unfair. Sirius Black had either confessed and felt so guilty that he had requested not to have a trial, or he had been wrongfully imprisoned.
“What?” Draco had zoned out. “Oh, yes Professor.” Draco grabbed his books and left the library, leaving Snape behind.
didn't send him to hell. He surely wasn't in heaven, and his hell would be much worse than this. Maybe it had to do with the fact that the familal magic had recently settled fully on him, that he had become a full blooded Veela, but that scared him.
"Yeah, that awful Nott stole Neville's remembrall, you should have seen it, mate, Harry caught it right before it hit the ground!" Ron seemed more happy that Harry had gotten on the team than Harry himself.
"I'm a Veela." Draco breathed out, as if testing the sentence out, as if trying to convice himself this was real.
Professor Sprout was teaching them about Mandrakes, he absolutely hated the little buggers, they bit. She gave them earmuffs to wear when they pulled them out of their pots only to put them back in.
"Now-" Draco was cut off when the car started wiggling and the invisibility shield came off, Ron looked happy and fearful at the same time as he jammed the button again, only for nothing to happen,
Was there something wrong with him? Was he just destined to be mean no matter what? Could he never change?
Hermione gave them a nervous look and touched her new necklace for some reason. It didn't take a genius to see she was hiding something.
There it was, Draco stopped for a moment and got ready to run into the entrance, Ron however, did not stop and kept on going forward.
"Wha-" Draco said groggily before the first potion was shoved down his throat, Hermione had chosen the red one first, and then the blue.
"Mate, I know that you have a crush on him or something, but he was clearly leading you on!" Ron shook Harry, trying to snap him out of it, but Harry put his hands on Ron's and made him stop.
"Someones going to take the Philopheser's stone tonight!" She yelled, and McGonagall's papers fell out of her hands, she looked at them in shock.
Luna didn't even look up from her magazine, but Draco caught the faintest hints of a blush. "The Lovey Doveys tell me I should."
He turned back to Draco, "You are excused, we will call you if we have other questions." Draco nodded and left the corridor, probably going back to his dorm.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "I am putting flobberworm puke in his hair gel," Draco promised.
"These two idiots managed to give him a concussion!" Snape scolded them as he came out of the back room with a few potions in his hands, one was blue and the other was red.
He knew some others wondered how he had gotten into Ravenclaw. He wasn't above average when it came to book smarts but he wasn't dumb either. He preferred more practical uses of knowledge because he could see how it would help him. It
"Harry, those muggles seem right awful, I was wondering, what exactly are they like?" Draco kept his tone gentle, not wanting to scare Harry off or something, he knew how sensitive he was.
"Wanna walk to class together, It's the one class we have together." Hermione smiled at him, looking hopeful, it had been a bit of time since they had spent time together.
Speaking of sleeping, he didn't feel energized at all, he felt more tired. He yawned again, looking for the diary, it had been moved as well, who had come in his room? He grabbed the book from where it was now resting at the windowsill.
. He had decided to go for the book on dangerous magical creatures. Turning back to the Diary, she got ready to yell another spell when she heard someone whimper.
He opened his eyes and saw a hunk of metal hurtling towards him at a terrifying speed, he tumbled out of the way as it came to a stop right in front of him.
"Besides, didn't you see the faces Nott was making? He pretended to faint and everyone at the Slytherin table found it hilarious!" Harry yelled, face getting red. Either from humiliation or anger, Draco couldn't tell.
"Come on, Draco. We know you don't come to the Quidditch matches, but you have to know about the Slytherin vs. Gryffindor match today!" Terry sat down next to him.
"Draco, I know about him." She glanced at Dumbledore. She had planned to tell him what was happening, but Draco had talked to them, he had asked them why they were there. Yes, it was only one sentence, but it was a whole lot better than when he was avoiding them like the plague. He had made the first move; maybe Hermione could talk some sense into him and make him come forward on his own.
He shook his head, he didn't have time to think of such trivial things, he had to focus on the task at hand.
Maybe he acted out of ignorance; ignorance could be fixed. He could teach Tom. Teach him to respect those of different blood.
"How are you going to take two classes at once?" He asked. He had already thought of a way. Splitting the class time in half and then taking the rest of the class out of someone else's memory and studying it in a Pensive. Or maybe just splitting class time in half and getting extra work depicting what had been done in said class.
He could hear the chatter of the students, but they sounded far away and warped. He was worried. He didn't think he'd ever been this worried before. He was worried about Hermione, but he was
Draco made a noise of disgust before quickly vanishing the horrid smelling puke on the floor and backing away. He hit something, or, someone.
Hermione put her had on her mouth, she clearly felt guilty, she had promised him that she would never ask him about his father when she noticed how it made him feel. It hurt him to see her feel guilty for something that wasn't her fault, but this was the only way he could keep his secret, he would tell her when she was older, when she could understand it.
"That's what they feed on. Human souls," Draco answered. He knew how awful it sounded to anyone who hadn’t grown up hearing the stories. The Muggleborns always paled whenever they talked about them.
Finally, the boggart seemed to settle on something, Draco raised his wand and was greeted with a sight of—
Harry looked over at Draco who was currently riding with Ron and reading one of his books. He was seeing the boy in an entirely new light now. If you really looked at his hair, you would see how shiny it was, how it perfectly framed his face. How it seemed to fall into place without any insistence. How he seemed to glow in the sunlight.
He felt someone touch his hair and looked behind him to see Mrs Granger admiring it, "You have to tell me how you get your hair so good, it's absolutely wonderful, how do you get it so long at such a young age, is it a magical thing?"
Narcissa, try as she might, could not help them get over it. However, much to Draco's relief, she did
"Even if you don't know you want it, it'll show it, you probably see your parents right?" Draco smiled, he thought Potter had told him what he wanted, but Draco had been so focused on his own desire, that he didn't pay much attention to Potter's words.
Lucius ignored him completely, frozen when he saw the book that was lying on Draco's side table. It was a rare crack in his normally calm demeanour: his eyes were slightly wide and his jaw very narrowly hanging open.
"Very well, sit down, Mr. Malfoy." And he didn't even have house points taken away, wow, McGongall must have been feeling generous.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't want to ask in front of everyone else," he mumbled under his breath, eyes getting a distant look in them.
It was Draco, standing in the mirror, the older Draco. Behind him stood his parents, his mother and his father, Draco's left sleeve was rolled up, and so was his Father's, both their forearms were blank, there was nothing ingraved in them, it was just skin, no dark mark.
He shrugged. "You should try it." But Draco knew how unlikely that would be, it was clear that Trelawney wasn't exactly fond of Hermione and the feeling was clearly mutual.
Draco couldn't believe it. His father had tried to kill him. Sure, he was friends with Muggleborns and Blood-traitors and he knew that his father was going to be mad. But trying to kill him? His only heir?
He said it again, this time louder, and Draco could make out the smallest hints of a voice, "What?" He asked again, and Ron sucked in a deep breath, getting ready to yell as loud as he could.
Just as Draco entered his dormitory he noticed something peculiar. A flower had been left on his bed. A blue rose that would look well with the purple flower he already had. He knew it was some super special eye opening flower or whatever but it looked pretty, okay? And who was he to argue with a little bit of redecorating around this drab place.
"You would have been fine. You had us with you. Weasley would have scared them off with his atrocious fashion sense," Draco said in a tone of absolute conviction. A trait he had picked up from his mother. A tone that left no room for argument.
"There we go, now, all we need to do, is find the Hogwarts express." Ron was clearly nervous, given how breathy his voice was, and Draco was already doubting his plan.
The basilisk sprung forward again and Harry jumped, falling towards the water. The basilisk hit the statue face first, disorienting it for a moment. Harry got onto the floor once again and got ready.
Before Hermione and Ron could leave, Dumbledore spoke up. "There is something happening with Mr Malfoy," he stated.
Opening his eyes, he saw the goo on his arm and knew that he had been bit, but looking at the basilisk, he knew that it was dead. Or, at least, close to being dead. The sword was lodged right between its eyes. There was no way it would survive that.
"Be back before dark," was all Lucius had said before he abandoned Draco in the middle of Diagon Alley with nothing but a pouch of gold and a list of what he needed for the year.
"You seem off? Do you like Hermione or something?" He asked. There was a prickling feeling at the thought of him and Hermione snogging each other. It had to be disgust.
"Draco, so glad you were able to join us." Dumbledore threw out his arms, the familiar twinkle brought a reluctant smile to Draco's face.
He ran over to Draco even though his legs felt wobbly and were starting to go numb. Ron lay next to him, unconscious but not dead.
He thought he heard a gasp when the writing vanished almost immediately and new writing took its place.
"Draco!" Harry's face beamed at seeing him, and Draco's anger momentarily disappeared at seeing his face, but he shook his head,
"What are we doing, and why did you stuff me inside a dusty old classroom?" Draco was slightly annoyed, and he made sure it spilt into his tone.
"Nonsense, we must make sure this person is absolutely perfect for you. At least 3 O's in their classes, right Luna?"
In hindsight, he should have predicted this. Gryffindors had no common sense. Look at Weasley: he was on a hospital bed as well, sleeping. He had made the unbelievably stupid decision of fighting a miniature
"Wake up, Malfoy! You bloody wanker!" Another called out. And Draco thought the voice might have been male.
He dug into his backpack, looking for one of the books he had bought from Flourish and Botts. It was a new theory about Prophecies from a former Unspeakable, Arianna Smith.
"Let the lovebirds have their moment, Ron, no one's forgetting you." Hermione whispered so that only they could hear; she knew how defensive Harry got when someone mentioned his obvious crush on Draco.
"It looks like a trip to the Headmaster is due." Snape spoke, Draco started, ready to object, when his godfather lifted up his hand, and Draco stopped.
"She told me to give you this, a gift, for her forgiveness." Lucius handed him a book, a black leather book, it looked old and tattered, Draco opened the book only to find it empty.
"Draco Malfoy," someone called, and he was saved of the horrible fate of wandering around Diagon Alley all alone looking for someone he knew. He looked back, expecting to see one of his friends, maybe Ron or Hermione. Probably Harry. He was the one who normally got lost.
With one final cry, Quirrel turned to dust, and Harry turned back to Draco, a smile on his face, and Draco gave him a thumbs up while holding up the stone in his other hand. But the happiness didn't last long, a mist started to rise from Quirrel's ashes.
"I have to show you something." Draco was fully awake now, if a bit groggy. What did Potter need to show him?
"To Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage." Draco zoned out, not wanting to listen to something that he had heard before, he only paid attention when he heard his name again.
"Headmaster, don't wear a ring in the future, just dump all the ones you own." Draco said spontaneously, Dumbledore chuckled but nodded nonetheless, he would have to keep an eye on the jewlery this man purchased.
"Hagrid, what's wrong?" Draco asked in a soft voice. Terry and Anthony were looking at Hagrid with similar looks of concern while Luna was tearing up a bit.
Draco threw the letter on his bed and collapsed onto it with a pounding headache, he could really use one of his visions right about now.
Draco shoved the door closed and flinched away as the keys made holes in the wood, barely there, but noticeable.
"How long will the polyjuice take?" Harry looked at Hermione and knew that it wasn't going to be a good answer given how she looked at the floor and scratched her head.
When Mom spent a bit too much money on some unknown card, he knew he should visit Miss Catalina next door.
Across from Ron's stall, Hermione watched as her hair flattened out, slowly becoming blond; her eyes lightened from their normal hazel to silvery-blue-grey.
Draco stopped what he was doing, why would Potter want to call him by his first name? They weren't nearly that casual yet, it was a stretch to say that they were friends, but he supposed that he didn't see anything negative coming from that.
Did she scream that, looking around, she definitely did, Draco was looking at her with a smile on his face. Even McGonagall was stumped, this was her chance.
"What? Yes, I'm fine. Just thinking," he whispered, moving to stand beside Luna and the others as Lupin prepared to show them the boggart.
"Well, it appears your teachers truly weren't lying when they spoke of your prowess. Ten points to Ravenclaw!"
The four of them were in Draco's dorm, on a school night, as Hermione had put it, it was 'absolutely inappropriate' to be in anothers dorm on a schoolday, but she had to admit that she was excited to see the book, to see who Nicolas was, it had been eating at her.
Poppy looked at the floor to see the young Malfoy, her jaw dropped, but she shook her head, she could ask questions later, right now, helping Mr. Malfoy was more important.
"Tell me about it, he levitated a cake over our guests and dropped it on her, and then, he made it seem like it was
Lucius was looking around the shop and Draco didn't have a chance to hide as Lucius' eyes locked on him.
The Queen moved forward slowly, and when it finally reached him, it lifted its spear and swung it into the knight, causing it to break into millions of pieces, Weasley collapsed to the floor.
He didn't know how, but he got up. His legs felt like jelly. He couldn't control them, but he knew that he was closing the door and putting a locking charm on it. The panic was starting to decrease, the hands around his neck not as tight now, but breathing was still a problem.
"We're thinking about what you said, you know, with Snape." Ron whispered, but Hagrid still overheard.
"The day we discovered your origin, Severus came to me with a request. He asked me to Obliviate him. You see, Lucius is one of the few people able to get past Severus' shields. Back in their school days, they would practice on each other's minds. Your father knows how to get into Severus' mind, and he didn't want to take the chance of Lucius finding out and jeopardizing your safety. He knew he wouldn't be able to Obliviate himself, as I'm sure you know how dangerous that is, and so he asked me."
Draco could only mourn the fact that he hadn't paid that much attention to Pettigrew in the old timeline. Most of what he heard of Pettigrew from his father and a few scattered rumours were only about his cowardice and how he was a filthy half-blood. Tolerated, but nowhere near accepted. No one had mourned his death.
"No; Draco and Harry have this thing. Harry knew that something was wrong before any of us even thought of it. He's always been different when it comes to Draco. We can go to the library and find out what's been petrifying all the students! If we defeat whatever's in the Chamber, then Draco'll be fine!" He seemed proud of himself for coming up with such an idea.
Draco wasn't a fool. He knew that Scabbers was an Animagus. In fact, he knew exactly who Scabbers was: Peter Pettigrew.
Draco sat down and pushed himself up against Harry, wanting the cold feeling to go away. And Harry pushed back, probably wanting to feel the same. They both dug into their chocolate, Hermione and Ron slower than them.
"Yes, I am sorry about that, but I figured it would be better to talk to you when half the school wasn't laughing at you, wouldn't look good for either of us if we were found talking with each other."
"Things have been changing, with me, my hair's softer than ever, my eyes are more blue, even my skin's softer, what's happening to me?" All three of their eyes widened and Draco had to suppress a smirk, they had connected the dots.
A large man came bursting through the door and Harry jumped off, Draco caught him but so did the man, "Petunia, he's escaping!"
Opening the door to his room, Draco made his way inside, the room was full of books, ones that he himself had chosen to decorate with. Some were ones that you would expect to find in a first year's dorm, some weren't, but those ones were well hid, he was far from an idiot.
Hermione and Ron looked at him, happy that he agreed with them, and Hagrid made them all a nice cup of tea.
Like Draco, Harry, shot up and started panting. His eyes were unfocused as he tried to ground himself. And then, to Draco's horror, he threw up right in front of him. Almost
Oh fuck it, the future was at stake, plus, becoming friends with a Weasley would surely make Lucius disown him, the quicker that happened the better.
Dumbledore had a habit of not asking people questions and just thinking of the answer himself, although he supposed this Dumbledore could be a bit different from the Dumbledore that he knew, Merlin he hoped he was, but at the same time he hoped he wasn't, Draco didn't handle change well, it messed him up, he had learned that about himself when he had found out that he was a Veela and that he was a Seer.
"Then how will I-" He cut himself off, realizing that he had just been about to tell her he was from the future, he looked at her only to find her smiling.
There was a small part of him that knew that he wasn't dying, that this was most likely a panic attack, but that was only a small part. The other parts were completely convinced that he was going to diediediedie--
She fist-bumped Anthony and did a weird series of hand movements towards Terry, which he mimicked. Once she was done greeting them, she turned back to Draco and looked above his head, frowning.
This year would be difficult for him, Draco remembered how people turned against him in an instant, as soon as they found out that he was a parseltongue.
was wrong, something more, something that Draco knew, but couldn't put his finger on, the frustration started to build up inside him, and he grabbed his hair, desperately trying to remember, pulling at it, remember
And then, another vision, this time of Quirrel yearning for power, yearning to prove himself better than those who had mocked him, yearning to be taught by The Dark Lord, to achieve the level of power that he had.
"We need you to help us, we already went to Hagrid, and he let slip something about Nicolas Flamel."
It had taken Draco an embarrassingly long time to figure it out. Nonetheless, he had connected the dots. Many Death Eaters were aware of exactly who Peter Pettigrew was: a Gryffindor coward. But more importantly, he was an Animagus. A rat one. Fitting for someone like him.
Draco's head throbbed again, and he whimpered. He couldn't do this alone. He knew that he couldn't do this alone. He always knew. It was Tom who made him think otherwise. It was Tom who made him do this. It wasn't him.
"Shut up. The only stone currently in existence belongs to Nicolas Flamel, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday! That must be what you both are looking for." Draco spoke while he closed the book.
He kept his answer short, not wanting to say more than he had to. Lucius noticed what he was doing - he wasn't an idiot - and narrowed his eyes, he was angry.
"Where did they go?" Draco tilted his head, and Hermione's hairs stood on end. That was not Draco's voice. It sounded older. It only barely resembled Draco's drawl, but the voice itself could never be Draco's. His voice sounded...mean..uncaring. Draco sometimes sounded mean, sometimes he sounded uncaring, but there was never any truth to it, there was never any heat behind his insults. This voice was different. There was a small undertone to it, Draco's voice was hidden beneath it.
"Draco! Did you find what you wanted?" Draco shut the book instantly, he didn't need others knowing about this book, it was
"....Pardon me?" Lucius Malfoy asked his one and only son. The light of his life. The child he had spoiled. The perfect Pureblood heir. And the son he had almost killed, but they would get past that eventually.
Professor Trelawney, who had disliked Hermione the moment she had entered the door, gave her a look that was filled with equal parts pity and dislike.
"But aren't people all over Veela normally?" When Harry was staying at the Weasley's Charlie had mentioned something about Veela and how everyone seemed to love them. A lot of Quidditch teams liked to use them for their introductions and half time shows.
Voldemort started saying something, but Draco wasn't listening, suddenly, pain exploded in his head, and visions of a boy, a boy who looked like Quirrel getting harassed by his peers for being quiet, he was an easy target, they had said.
Draco was sitting at his table, talking to the new girl, Luna Lovegood, as well as Anthony Goldenstein, they both made lovely talk, Draco was interested in Lovegood's theories, the others didn't love her because they thought her abnormal, but Draco didn't see anything wrong with being a tad bit different, even though the old Draco had made fun of her, he wouldn't do that this time though.
Draco had long since finished the lesson. McGonagall, had, of course, given him a quick small smile. He didn't want to risk pressuring his friends into telling him anything. They were entitled to their secrets, just as Draco was entitled to his own. And he couldn't exactly find anything out about the situation without asking them. That would just be an invasion of their privacy.
Draco walked into the classroom and sat at her desk, she sat down at the other side, looking at him.
The Slytherin table erupted into applause when they learned that they had won, but Draco was smiling, knowing that they had not won.
"Chocolate. Eat the whole thing." Lupin smiled but there was a hardness to his eyes, and he stood ramrod straight. He moved to give everyone else some chocolate as well, but Harry and Draco got the biggest portions.
"I have to go ask Flitwick something!" He lied, not wanting to explain to her why he was going to see the divination Professor when they didn't even have divination until third year.
"You see a boat filled with people. You look again, but this time you don’t see a single person on the boat. Why?"
Draco shook himself out of his thoughts. There would be plenty of time to think of that later. Right now, he needed to get back to the Headmaster’s office. There was something that had been bugging him all day. And he intended to get answers.
Hermione knew what was going to happen, and the mere thought shot ice into her veins. She had to think.
Draco did as he was told, but the other didn't sit down, had Snape made him sit down because he thought what he was about to tell him would be too much for him? A silly thought, even as an eleven year old he wouldn't think he would have, what,
All of Terry's life, ending up in situations where he couldn't predict how people would act had always ended with him getting hurt. Whether physically or emotionally.
"I have to say, what you did in class today was absolutely extraordinary, Mr. Malfoy." Flitwick said as Draco sat down.
"Class is dismissed. Mr. Malfoy, stay behind please." Lupin spoke in the strictest voice Draco had heard him use.
"Draco!" Hermione yelled as she ran up to him. Draco only had enough time to take a single step back before a body collided into him. He suddenly found himself being crushed into a hug.
He saw Harry's face soften. "I'm so sorry, Draco. We've been awful this year, but we won't be anymore," he promised.
Almost everyone expected the sorting hat to yell out Slytherin, but strangely, it didn't, it was almost like the hat payed attention to what the young Malfoy was saying, even headmaster Dumbledore seemed stumped, no one knew what was going on inside the young Malfoy's head, what he was saying, but whatever he was saying, the sorting hat was definitely listening to him.
Draco didn't have time to think about, he was suddenly being squished by three eleven-year-olds, apparently, he was supposed to hug them all at the same time, it looked like that had been taken care of.
"Thinking you could keep me away from my dearest Draco. Really, I don't know why he even deals with you in the first place. Oh wait, I do!" He laughed.
They all put their things in the back of the car and Ron took the driver's seat, much to Draco's dismay. Draco had to sit in the back with the owl, while Ron and Harry sat in the front, and before he knew it, they were taking off.
But, he had expected this. They had been friends for three years. This was where their friendship would either fall apart or stay together.
, a major change in the Seer's life or major disruption in the Seer's magic would cause their eye to promptly close, making it hard, near impossible to get vision's or even listen to the stars.
In the corner of his eye, he saw Dumbledore stop his movements and try to look him in the eye, trying to get into his mind. Dumbledore breathed in sharply.
"Harry Potter." The Centaur's voice brought him back, they both spun around to look at their savior (the irony of the savior being saved was not lost on him).
Hermione chuckled behind them. Harry relaxed just a tad and Ron sighed in relief. Draco, however, still had his doubts. He didn't remember much of the Golden Trio's adventures in third year. The whole year overall had been mysterious. That year had left Draco with questions, mainly because of how elated Potter had looked by the end of it. But that did give Draco hope for this year; something had happened in the last timeline that had brought joy into Potter's life. And Merlin knows this Harry needed something to pick him up.
Draco had enough experience dealing with creeps before he had presented, and being a Veela didn't exactly help to ward any of them away.
Draco's jaw dropped. Was this boy really disregarding the fact that someone tried to kill him mere minutes ago to the fact that he had freed some elf? An elf that had tried to mutilate him with a bludger (Draco still hadn't forgiven the little bastard for that).
"Hermione, Harry's probably talking to Draco, right?" Ron said once they were out of the Headmaster's office.
There was a light shining from the hallway next to them. It was a faint glow that came from McGonagall's office. They could hear silent muttering coming from the office. Harry looked at Ron, warning him to be quiet. Ron rolled his eyes but nodded.
Draco smiled, it was all working out. Draco walked into the charms classroom and took his seat next to Patil, they were learning
“Hermione!" Ron and Harry rushed up to a frazzled looking Hermione. She had just burst into the Gryffindor common room.
"We're not idiots, Hagrid." Draco told him calmly, they couldn't avoid his question now, they would have to answer.
"Yeah, and he apologized for that, I accepted his apology for Madame Malkins, you need to get over it."
"You think I haven't noticed? You wear long sleeves even in the summer. At first, I thought you were... self-harming.  But then I saw the bruises. They look like hands, Terry." He let that sink in.
"Alright," he said, even though he had no idea what she meant. But then again, most of the books he read were always so confusing on the subject of seers. It was hard to put into words just what you felt when you had a vision or compare the feeling of a prophecy to something else. Perhaps he would have to reach into his imagination.
"Yeh didn't hear? Classes er canceled. I'm the only teacher to be fired on thr firs' day!" Hagrid blubbered, getting more and more worked up. Looking around, it was true that there was no one else around. How had he not noticed that? Apparently, Terry and Anthony were more distracting than he had given them credit for. They should be spies...
Harry shot him a beaming smile and Draco's heart did a little stutter (he would have to look into that later). He opened his mouth to say something but was cut off when the door suddenly slammed open and someone came in hollering.
Harry shrugged, shooting Draco a sheepish look. Draco couldn't fault him for his lack of magical knowledge, he hadn't even known he was a wizard until he was eleven for Merlin's sake! He would really have to educate him if he wanted to stand a chance in his upcoming years without pulling all his plans out of his arse.
"Alright, keep the boy here, once he wakes up, give him this." Poppy handed him a white glowing potion.
"I know how shit your relatives are. If you need to run away again, you're coming to my house. I'll give you a portkey at the end of the year." They were normally regulated by the Ministry but he could pull some strings.
Draco could feel his cheeks getting warmer, he always did like when people complimented his intelligence, it was something he and Hermione both shared.
"Here it is." Draco put the huge book on his bed, he had taken it out of the library to study Seer's, Nicolas was a great man, he had done research on almost everything, and Seers was one of them, and he did want to study up on Veela's just a bit.
"Hermione, that's a load of bollocks. How could a book possess someone?" Ron laughed despite the withering glare Hermione was giving him.
He hadn't been paying attention to the conversation, but for some reason, he started paying attention when Hermione started talking, it was as if he couldn't control why he was listening,
"Eureka!" Draco yelled, and then slapped a hand on his mouth, he couldn't help it, he yelled it out when he got excited, it was an embarassing thing to do, but he just couldn't help it.
She smiled, Harry was listening to her, he had given Draco the flower that she had recommended. She sighed... lovebirds.
The stands around him let out a cheer. Terry started bouncing up and down while Luna grabbed Anthony's hand-- most likely crushing it, given how Anthony's face screwed up in pain.
That made them both pause. "Didn't Hermione say she was going to study with Draco?" Ron asked, horror slowly creeping into his voice.
"A Portkey is an object that can take you to a specified location. They're either activated by touch or vocal commands. If you wish to go back to where you came from, you just touch or say the command again," Draco elaborated.
"What Quidditch match?" A boy next to Anthony laughed. It took a minute, but Draco eventually recognized the boy as Terry Boot, one of Anthony's friends.
She readied another spell but didn't even have time to cast the wand movement when she was suddenly overwhelmed by pain. She tried to scream but her voice wouldn't work. She fell to the ground, she couldn't move but she could see the blood oozing out of her left leg. There was a huge gash on it. Hermione couldn't think, she was blinded by pain. She struggled to breathe.
Harry Potter was walking down the hallway with his friend Ron Weasley when he heard some strange noises that came from across the hallway. He decided to investigate it, he ushered Ron to follow him.
He fell on top of Harry; scratch the part about being okay. They both groaned in pain but Harry knew that Ron couldn't possibly be as hurt as he was. He had a human pillow to cushion his landing after all.
You stood there while that awful Ronald Weasley told me off in front of everyone!" More tears made its way down her face.
say anything towards you, a Malfoy child is expected to act like a brat. I didn't want to compromise anything in case I did get into Slytherin."
As soon as they were out of the room Harry fell to the ground, muttering under his breath, "No, no, no." Tears sprung to his eyes, he wanted nothing more than to curl in on himself and cry.
The Professor had been nothing but kind to him. She had been someone he could actually talk to, about everything! She had listened and offered insight, had even offered to tutor him! He wasn't just going to stand by and laugh as people defamed her subject. Just because they were either frustrated or too full of themselves and decided taking it out on her was the right way to go about it!
"You've been sorted into Ravenclaw," Lucius spoke once he had finished his dinner. Draco had been expecting him to bring it up sooner, but he had waited a whole week before bringing up his sorting.
Malfoy looked over at Potter, with a slight smile and a calculating look on his face, his eyes were narrowed slightly. The great hall may have quieted down but everyone still payed attention to the young Malfoy, this was a sorting no one would forget soon, least of all Lucius Malfoy.
"You have just come from Divination, yes?" she asked a good handful of the class. The answering murmurs were all mixtures of,
He was panting. His hair was wet, and Harry was unconscious next to him. It took him a moment to gather his thoughts but once he did, he grabbed his wand and did the same thing Hermione did to him.
Severus cleared his throat, causing Draco to look over at him, he was mindful not to look him in the eye, it would be rather confusing to him why he couldn't break through a '11 year old's' occlumency, 11 year old Draco wasn't even remotely good at Occulemcy, even with Severus helping him.
Luna scurried back over to them. She didn't look as composed as she normally did. But she looked better and nowhere near as terrified as she was before, so that was a good thing.
"Actually," Anthony put his quill down. Terry smirked knowingly in the background as Anthony avoided eye contact.
He had been there for her when she hadn't been able to make a single friend, he had been there for her when she was crying all alone in the library. He had been there for her! And what did she do in return? Leave him when he needed her most.
Harry and Lucius glared at each other for a minute before finally following the Headmaster's orders. Lucius was quick to leave while his elf lingered behind. Harry, who had taken to notice of the elf until he stared directly into Harry's eyes was understandably shocked at seeing him.
Harry was looking at Draco, his worry increasing as he noticed how pale the Malfoy looked, his eyes had bags underneath them, but what worried him most was the fact that his normally perfectly kept hair was all over the place.
And there Draco stood, with no idea of what he was supposed to be doing, where he was supposed to go first, or where his friends were.
"My family is not, happy, often." Draco looked away, that was a lie, at least for this year, their family was a happy one, at least until fourth year, that was when everything went downhill, but Potter didn't need to know that.
Hermione launched into an explanation of the charm and how it affected Dementors. And that was when Draco tuned out.
Lucius made a sound of absolute fury, spinning around to face his wife, "I told you! We should have sent him to Durmstrang, Dumbledore has already started to corrupt his mind!"
"Do you have any idea how serious this is?" He put down the newspaper and glared at Draco in particular, Draco looked back at him, or at least, the one that he thought was him,
Harry didn't want to go, he'd rather stay and see why Snape wanted to keep Malfoy, but when Ron started tugging on his arm, he gave in and left, but he would definitely figure out why Snape was keeping Malfoy, he'll ask him tomorrow.
He opened the door to Myrtle's room, made his way to one of the stalls and threw the book in the toilet, he was right about to flush it, when the voices came back in his head.
Tom continued to compliment him every time he did even the slightest thing right, and Draco found himself growing fond of Tom, he helped him with the homework and they talked, they bantered over points that they disagreed on, and Draco soon learned that Tom was
For some reason, Draco had been hanging out with Harry Potter, even Ronald Weasley, although most of those conversations ended with the redhead yelling bloody murder. They were with the two of them right now, she had been paired with Ronald for a Transfiguration project, and Draco had been paired with Potter.
Draco wasn't really walking towards Luna; he was being dragged by Terry while Anthony was bouncing next to them, blabbing about something. He learned two things right there: Terry was abnormally strong and energetic, and Anthony couldn't stop talking for more than two minutes.
Hermione thought for a moment. "You could still court him. But once the year is up you would have to ask
"30 points from Ravenclaw for bullying another housemate, and you will be serving a week's detention with me." Thirty points was a bit much.
'A new path shall be set for the equal, the prophesied shall meet a prodigy, born as the sixth month flourishes, two friends, once foes, shall carry the power to vanquish the one who has tainted their lives, one carries the power other's shall never know, nor shall they ever understand. So mote it be.'
Weasley was a self-sacrificing idiot, they had to play chess to get to the other room, Draco wanted to tell them what to do, but
Draco cringed at the analogy he had made, had he just referred to himself becoming a Veela much like the sexual education teachers had taught puberty to them?
"Hermione!" Hagrid greeted her, and she joined them in Flourish and Botts, which was unexpectedly crowded, more so than normal.
"The most difficult of all magical arts." Hermione scoffed at that. Trelawney - who had obviously expected that - said nothing in response, even though she obviously heard it. Hermione's face flushed; it was clear she hadn't meant to say anything out loud.
"The boy is allowed to have his secrets Severus, and perhaps he didn't know he was a seer, it is not a gift he would have realized unless he had taken divination, which is not available until his third year."
"Oh, Malfoy?" Finnigan questioned before looking between the two of them and Harry's panicked expression. His expression changed into one of mockery as he shot Harry a look Draco couldn't decipher.
Harry turned around, his eyes wide, looking around for the source of the noise, but he couldn't see it, he could only hear it.
"I appreciate your opinion Davies, but the hat has spoken, are you questioning a thousand year old magic hat that was charmed by the founders themselves, do you find yourself a better judge of character than the brightest witch and wizards our society has known?"
"You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, and I won't breathe a word of it to the headmaster,"
"Malfoy, what did you do to the cat?" Hermione was poking the cat, it wasn't moving, she was looking at him in horror and fear, and Draco smiled at her, an evil smile.
"Can someone tell me what's happening?" She asked in a harsh tone, but she was really honestly scared, it had been a long time since Albus had asked her to heal a student in anywhere except the hospital wing when they were actually able to get there.
She looked around and paled when she didn't see anyone in sight. No one was around to see anything. She looked back at whoever it was and glared at them. She knew she couldn't fight them, but she would definitely try.
"But you also know that your father is an accomplished Legilimens." Draco's confusion slowly gave way to understanding.
"Of course they do. No one cares about Zonko's anymore, they're all using the Weasley products." He could only imagine the look on his father's face when he learned that not only had he been pranked, he had been pranked with a
Maybe... maybe there was hope for him after all. The thought made him giddy with happiness. Could he really steer his father away from the dark? Sure, he would never really atone for all the things he had already done. But maybe, just maybe, Draco could stop him from digging a deeper grave.
"Well, it's in a few hours, so until then we can hang out with Luna." Terry snatched his arm. Draco barely had any time to grab his book before Terry started dragging him where he assumed Luna was.
Hermione absolutely loved learning about magic, others didn't understand, they thought she was a know-it-all, that she thought she was better than them, but she didn't.
Hermione, however, wasn't backing down, "It is! How are we supposed to get good grades in the subject if we can't study?"
"We must be getting close!" Ron smiled, but Draco looked behind him and all the colour drained out of his face as he saw the Hogwarts express right behind them.
That had always just been a part of Anthony's life. The knowledge that the authorities wouldn't do anything. His parents had tried to keep him away from these types of things. But it was hard when he heard them talking over the phone about the kid they had failed to keep away from the arseholes who were their parents.
He turned to Hermione, they had an argument concerning Draco, Harry thought that they should at least listen to him, but Hermione was dead set on ignoring him, and Ron wasn't exactly much help, Harry missed Draco, and he really just wanted this all to be done with.
"No bodyguards this time?" Harry made a show of looking behind Nott and looking confused. And it was true, there was no Crabbe and Goyle lumbering over the smaller boy anymore.
Why were they blaming Harry already? That wasn't supposed to happen until the duelling club, and he had already made preparations to make sure that didn't happen, he would have to scrap those now. Oh god, what happened-
"I know, I was shocked too. But it worked." The whole guilt complex thing had been a huge gamble, but it was the plan with the least risk. And it wouldn't damage his already precarious relationship with his father. In Draco's mind, the plan had seemed foolish. To his surprise, it had actually worked.
"No, Professor! Don't look that way!" Terry tugged on her sleeve. He had been distracting McGonagall for a full hour and he had learned far too much about Transfiguration. It was already his best subject! He had an E in it!
"Sorry, Hermione! We were in the library—he disappeared." Harry looked noticeably dishevelled; he must have run all the way to the Gryffindor common room from the library.
Dumbledore blinked, for a moment looking uncharacteristically surprised before slowly melting into grim realization. If there wasn't enough proof before, Dumbledore's expression was all he needed to confirm the harsh truth.
"You see, the Umgubular Slashkilter's normally buzzed around hurt people. Either inside or outside. They buzz around you a lot, Terry." Luna looked away holding her book tightly, Anthony was sure he could see her knuckles turning white.
Everyone in the great hall looked on in horror, some in amazement, and some in confusion as the heir to the Malfoy family chanted 'Not Slytherin' while being sorted. A quick glance at the Slytherin table would tell you how the Slytherin's felt about this.
As soon as Harry touched the broom, all the keys started swarming him, "Which one do I get?" He yelled in panic.
"Please excuse him, Professor. You know how teenage boys are. He's just turned thirteen. Perhaps he should
"Well, it's not like the Dursleys are going to be signing it any time soon. The bloody bastards." Harry's voice was muffled from where he had collapsed on the couch.
"No! No Hermione! I don't want your help! I don't want anyone's help!" Draco's voice sounded distorted at the end, and he slapped his hand over his mouth. When he retracted his hand, he was looking at it in horror. He was looking at
"Herbology is my first class, how long have I been out?" Draco asked, he was a tad bit worried considering the fact that it looked like the sun was rising.
"Well I still think--" Before Anthony could continue Draco slapped a hand over his mouth. "We're here!" He announced.
"Draco! What did you two do to him!" They were greeted by a very frazzled Hermione when they entered the room, the common room was empty except for her as the rest of them were sleeping.
"You should really learn to respect your superiors, Potter." Tom completely ignored his question. It seemed like a barb, clearly meant to get a reaction out of him but Harry wouldn't let it get to him. Even if his insides really were burning with hatred.
"You can take the Dragon there, I'll be on guard duty." Hermione seemed confused, but she didn't protest, she merely nodded, and since they were all there, Draco decided to voice another question of his.
"Draco, I know yer father probably took yeh ter as a kid, but I'm here to tell yeh that it's not right, you shouldn't be mingling with those folk." Hagrid faced him and gave him a whole speech, his arms crossed.
"Let's go!" Ron ordered the twins, and they started to move backwards, the bars came off just like that, they opened the back of the 'car' for Harry to put his things into, Draco was starting to calm down when he heard someone scream,
He flipped through the book and got to the page that focused on Nicolas Flamel, before he could say anything, Hermione had already found it.
Ron sat down on her left, while Harry took her right. Harry put a hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry, Hermione, we'll figure something out."
Potter giggled along with him, even though he didn't know what they were laughing about, perhaps his laugh was contagious. Potter snorted and Draco went into fullblown laughter, Potter followed him soon after, it was weird, not less than half an hour ago, he was crying, and now, he was laughing, but he didn't feel like thinking about it.
Draco, Harry and Hermione walked to the sea of red hair and Draco tapped Molly Weasley on the shoulder, she spun around and instantly let out a sigh of relief at seeing them.
"He always keeps secrets from us. Disappearing at weird times of the day. Or we just find him talking with Potter and the others."
"No." Draco answered slowly, it was weird, everything in him told him to scream 'yes, Potter, of course I'm mad at you!', but he knew that it was wrong to scream at
Draco was at the edge of the grounds, laying on the grass, contemplating, when he heard a freakish roar in the sky.
Flowers were often used in the first stage of courting. If someone wanted to express their love anonymously or make the courting a surprise, it was expected for them to leave a flower somewhere the person would notice immediately.
"Oh my god, Draco, I'm sorry." She hugged him, it looked like Harry and Weasley wanted to as well, but they weren't that sure.
"I have to head back to my common room," Draco said, getting up. It wasn't a lie, per se. Curfew was fast approaching and Draco didn't want to risk detention, but he would have to implore the help of a few of his housemates if he wanted his plan to work.
I'm thinking of making a new story. How would you guys feel about a Draco meets the Avengers story. Probably dimension travelling. He would become an Avenger. Just tell me what you think about it!
"Of all the stupid things you've done, Potter, this takes the cake.  You ran away from home when you know how dangerous it is. And at night, no less! Do you know how embarrassing it would be to find that the-boy-who-lived died in a stupid muggle car accident!?"
"Harry!" Hermione and Ron followed him down the corridor, he started running down, because he knew that something was wrong, he could feel it, he just didn't know what.
Filch came running in, but when he saw Mrs Norris, he stopped. He looked at Harry in rage, "You...You killed my cat." He was shaking with rage.
"This is completely optional, but I would like you to read this book, it focuses on Male Veela." He handed Draco a maroon colored book, in big gold letters, it read,
"We're here!" Luna smiled, looking at the air. It probably wasn't the air, maybe another creature she could see. Draco would have to ask her about that later. Her creatures always fascinated him.
"Well, he probably hasn't presented yet. It's like puberty, Harry," she said matter-of-factly. Harry blushed, still feeling a bit awkward discussing those topics.  But it didn't even amount to that time Hermione had started going off about sex charms.
Really?" Draco hissed, Harry was covered in soot, if Harry had managed to ruin Draco's hair along with his, he would kill him.
A horrifying thought occurred to her. What if Dumbledore was going to expel Draco? She didn't know what she would do then, and she didn't like not knowing things. If Dumbledore really did try to expel Draco, she might yell at him. No, she would yell at him. She would
It took a lot of strength, but Draco grabbed the Diary and gave it to Harry. "An elf can only be free when his master gives him clothes." Draco smiled softly. It took a minute, but Harry's face lit up when he realized what Draco meant.
Draco awoke on a hospital bed, his head was throbbing and his entire body ached, but he noticed one thing immediately, Harry, Ron and Hermione were standing by his bed, and Dumbledore was standing at the head of it.
Just to think, yesterday, he was a 22 year old man, standing over Severus Snape's dead body, he had fought well, but everyone who fought against him died eventually, and it was Severus' time. He still didn't understand why the
"Students, come up, come up, pair up and fight! Harry, come up here, let’s show everyone how it’s done, yes?" Lockhart forced Harry up onto the stage, and Draco suddenly remembered the Parseltongue incident. He wondered how that would happen now.
Dead bodies. There were dead bodies everywhere. Faceless dead bodies— and the scene in the room had changed. There was no longer a classroom in front of him, but a battlefield. A battlefield that showed the story of something terrible. And all Draco could think was that he had
"We were trying to floo to Diagon, Hagrid, but Harry here doesn't know how to pronounce the simplest of words correctly." Draco levelled Harry with a scathing look, and relished in the way he shrunk back slightly, but seemed dead set on proving his innocence.
Speaking of Veelas, he was showing even more now, his hair had been growing and was now resting at his shoulders, he knew that in a week or two, it would be at mid-length, he would probably tie his hair into a ponytail when that happened, it was one of his favorite styles.
Draco hesitated for a moment, he probably shouldn't tell Tom that he was a time traveller, he should wait until he was back in his dorm, but what could happen, he should tell Tom now.
Draco walked to the field with Harry, Ron and Hermione, Ron and Harry were in their Quidditch uniforms while Draco and Hermione had plans to relax on the field while watching them play, Hermione didn't like flying.
Draco wanted to say more, but he knew that even if Harry did promise him, he wouldn't be able to keep it. No promise was better than a fake one. Draco gave up and put his head on Harry's shoulder, mumbling 'idiot' repeatedly.
"Well, if you continue being a prodigy, I will also tutor you privately, there is a lot of potential in you Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall smiled slightly.
He had glanced at the Gryffindor table a few times, only because he thought he felt someone looking at him, but every time he looked at the table, Harry was looking somewhere for some reason, Draco had caught him looking at the ceiling several times, not to mention that his face was always red, he had to get some pepper up for him, Draco was starting to worry for him, maybe he had a cold.
"Well, we snuck out of our dorm to duel Nott, right? And we kinda bumped into a three-headed-dog." Harry's voice got softer as he went on.
The summer that followed was... horrible. There was no other way to describe it. There was clear tension between father and son, so much so that even the house-elves (who normally tried to keep out of their master’s business) noticed. Draco kept himself cooped up in the family library while Lucius was out doing who knows what, who knows where. And frankly, Draco didn't care what his father was doing. The feelings of rage and stinging betrayal were all that accompanied thoughts of his father nowadays.
He thrust the fang right into the diary, black goo spurting out of it. He heard a yell and looked up to see Tom screaming in agony as bright yellow light burst out of him. The light originally burst out of where Harry had hit the diary, but then, it spread.
"Harry, Draco, we had hoped that you'd only gone one grate too far." Molly wrapped them both in a hug.
"Draco's our friend and he's entitled to his own secrets. Just like you've been keeping from us." Maybe Anthony shouldn't have said that last part. Terry's face paled a little too quickly. He was sure he had read somewhere in a book that that wasn't good for you.
"She's just...nice once you get to know her." The anger started draining out of him, quickly being replaced with exhaustion. The whole day had tired him out and that little vision hadn't done much to dispel it. It was odd, his head hadn't been pounding like it normally did when he had a headache. It was more like an itch he couldn't scratch because it was in his
Draco swallowed, he was just a tad bit afraid, even though he had thought of every scenario and had thought of every appropriate response to it, but he was still nervous, his mind was just like that, starters like
It was a Grim. An omen of death. Something all Pureblood children and Half Bloods had been taught to fear all their lives. The ultimate omen of death.
"Enough!" Hagrid interrupted them, "Let's get you both to Diagon." Hagrid led them both up the stairs, exiting Knockturn.
"Those are Nimbus 2001's!" Ron gasped, looking at the brooms in jealousy, while Draco was looking at them in confusion as well as curiosity, his father hadn't bought them for the team this time, it looked like Nott really was the replacement Malfoy this time.
Some of the people that were in Charms with him, laughed, at least they weren't making fun of him, but he supposed that would stop when the news got over te school that one of the first years performed a non-verbal spell on his first try.
"So, Harry, tell me about muggles." Arthur ended the conversation and turned to Harry, Draco cringed at the thought of those horrible muggles who had put bars on Harry's windows, but other than that, he tuned the conversation out and focused on slowly eating his breakfast.
That relief was shorted lived however, when he heard someone clear their throat, he was reminded of Umbridge and he whipped out his wand and pointed it at the toa-
Grabbing his hairbrush from his nightstand, he brushed his hair, fortunately, he had stopped using gel on his hair, that was an atrocious look, what little him was thinking, he couldn't fathom.
"'Arry! Ron! Why's Hermione crying?" Hermione looked up, trying to explain, but just ended up crying harder, she put her head on her knees and continued to sob.
He whipped around, wand already pointed, and came face to face with Remus Lupin. That didn't do anything to calm him because all he could think was
She slapped him on the arm, but at least she wasn't freaking out about the detention anymore, best not to mention that word in front of her anymore though.
"No, it's actually for me," Draco answered, the admission feeling somewhat unreal. He still couldn't understand why someone would give him a rose if it wasn't just for his looks. Was that it? Someone just liked the way he looked and had a decent knowledge of flowers?
"Harry Potter." He breathed out and snatched Harry away from Draco, who didn't even have enough time to comprehend what was happening.
"What are Dementors?" Harry asked when they were finally in the common room. Draco had asked Professor McGonagall if he could go to the Gryffindor common room instead of his own just this once. She must have felt bad about the Dementors because she agreed, although with a few strict assurances that if they did anything wrong, they would have detention for a month.
He still didn't like going there for his supplies every year. But that was obligatory. Even then, if he really wanted it, he could just ask one of the house-elves to go get him his things. Or one of his parents. But he didn't want to go just to have fun. Besides, there were plenty of things he and Harry could do in Hogwarts while most of the teachers were out playing supervising the others. Most teachers would let them have more free time at the castle because they were missing out on Hogsmeade anyway.
Wait, had Hagrid just revealed how to get past that three headed dog, Draco would need to remember that.
"Yeah, no," Terry refused. "I'm not just going to blindly trust you with my education. Do you know what my parents will do to me if I get expelled?"
"I think that the Allure will present during your fourth year, you will need to be careful then." The smile momentarily disappeared from Flitwicks face and his eyes darkened, Draco didn't interrupt but he knew what he was going to say.
"Draco." Luna got up and hugged him, Luna always hugged him for some reason when they met; she didn't do handshakes.
Speaking of Veela, Draco had decided that he wasn't going to take his suppressants anymore, they always made him feel horrible, like he was locking away a part of himself, like he was shaving off all of his hair and tucking it away in a drawer and putting a lock on it, it made him feel bare, naked, and he hated it.
Potter beamed even more, Draco had to admit that it was nice to see when he was still innocent, even if Draco knew that he was going to lose it eventually.
Draco looked at Dobby and then at the letter, he wanted to be angry, but he knew that wouldn't be the right thing to do, "Dobby, why are you taking my mail?"
"And I'm George!" Another one chimed in, they both started snickering, that would be hell, figuring out their names.
"He probably has a concussion, what were you thinking about, using the flying car to get to Hogwarts, how did you even miss the train?" Hermione hissed at them but was still looking at Draco in pity.
Hermione finally let go of him and Harry walked up to him, a bright smile on his face and a look of utter adoration in his eyes. The simple look made his cheeks heat up. No one had ever looked at him like that. Like he was the most precious thing in the world.
"Draco, please listen. I'm sorry, I knew it wasn't you. I know that something’s wrong. Please, just let us help you." Harry rushed to get all the words out as if he was scared that Draco would run away. He probably would.
Professor McGonagall's frown deepened and she led them into a secluded corner of the library where the other students couldn't hear them.
"Divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare. And Professor Trelawney..." she trailed off once more and Draco felt another swell of indignation. It was true that Divination had never been a branch of magic that had gathered much favor. But it was only because so many people were offended when they realized they would never be able to learn a specific branch of magic that they'd rather make fun of anyone who could!
The only thing that he could make sense of was that he missed Tom, and he didn't know why. He knew that Tom was most likely the reason he had called Hermione that word; but was he really that bad? Maybe Tom was like him, a boy who had thought that he was above others because of his blood. Maybe he could convince Tom that he wasn't above them?
Hermione gasped, "I think I'm going to be sick." She gagged and ran into a stall, shutting the door.
"You shouldn't get lost in your Inner Eye for so long, child." Everyone heard, gasps ringing through the crowd. Hermione gave him a look and Draco found himself inching away from her; she looked at him not unlike she looked at a new book.
Terry and Anthony were saying something, but their voices sounded warped and far away. He pushed Anthony away and ran to his dorm.
"Don't worry, I got this thing, it's super cool, just put it on and no one can see us under it." Draco's train of thought crashed and burned at Potter's statement, what type of magical device-
"The troll-" Speak of the devil, he stopped right in front of the girl's bathroom and saw that the troll had already gone in, he could Hermione yelling inside.
"Harry!" He heard Ron call after him, but Harry didn't care. He was going to save Draco and he wouldn't let some scary slide get in the way of it.
Draco sighed. Oh well, the fun was good while it lasted. They cracked open the door to find the room decorated in purple and a few shades of red. It was a familiar sight. One that brought a smile to Draco's face. The rest just looked on in slight surprise; none of the other teachers dared to decorate their classrooms like this. Trelawney, however, had never been like other teachers.
She stood up and faced the others, all their eyes were still locked on Mr. Malfoy, like they were trying to figure him out, especially Severus, Poppy had never seen emotions so visible on his face, it scared her.
The older Draco was smiling, a real smile, not a smirk, not a fake smile, but one born of real happiness. His hair was long, like his father's, but more
Hermione rolled her eyes and went back to her food, pointedly not looking at him. Draco resisted the urge to do the same to her. Instead opting to pull out a book from his bag. The Malfoy family library had quite a bit on Seers and Time Travel. Merlin knows no one in the family actually read them, though. They were merely there for display, just as much of the house was.
Hermione sniffed and wiped her nose with her sleeve. "Yeah. Okay, step one, we have to talk to Draco--"
"Harry!" Ron called out as Harry desperately tried to hang on for dear life, Ron tried to grab him but was stopped when Draco slapped him, "Eyes on the clouds!" Draco moved to the front of the car and reached out for Harry.
"Welcome to Divination," said Professor Trelawney, swooping into the room. Her bead necklaces moved just a bit as she opened her arms. The class gave her a look, a few mocking while others (mostly Muggleborns) looked at her in awe.
She smiled and nodded, and with that, he left the room, keeping in mind the new rules that came with being a Seer.
Harry gulped but stood his ground, "When we landed in the tree I think it hit him in the back of the head, it did break the glass." Harry looked at Ron,
He thought he heard Professor Trelawney say something to Neville about his grandmother but they seemed far off, their voices muffled in a way. That was when Draco realized he had yet to come back from his post vision haze. It was something he always went through; the bigger the vision, the longer it took to regain his senses. He took a deep breath and calmed his mind. Occlumency was extremely helpful with things like this.
No one noticed how Harry started hugging Hermione when he opened a letter that, strangely enough, had the Malfoy seal on it. The tension in his shoulders had faded completely and the nervous expression was replaced with one of complete happiness.
"See, all it took was one trip to Draco and he figured out what we've been trying to for months!" Harry looked at him, now he was the one who was starstruck, and Draco couldn't help but blush, he loved compliments.
"That's horrible Harry, but for what it's worth, I don't think you're a freak." Draco slowly wrapped Harry in a hug, he didn't hug people often, let alone hugging Potter, but he felt like he needed one right now, and Draco wasn't
Harry felt himself filling with dread as he saw the group of people in the library. He pushed through the crowd, Ron behind him. All the teachers, as well as the Headmaster, were standing at the front of the crowd.
He gasped as a figure came into view, a person, standing over a dead Unicorn, such a magnificent creature, dead, the sight hurt him, but he was too focused on the figure in front of him, someone covered in a cloak. He felt like he recognised him, his mind was screaming at him to remember, but it wasn't letting him remember-
The simpler thought made Draco light-headed. Distantly, he saw Hermione get up with an angry look on her face.
"You can be part Veela?" He asked. He knew about Veela but he didn't know that much. They just hadn't seemed that important. And unlike Hermione, he didn't research magical creatures for fun. Sure, he was interested in them but not overly so. Just another creature to file away into the 'That exists?' department of his brain.
"Well, imagine a rich man, who's friends with the President, and the President is a bumbling man who can't think for himself and is easily manipulated by this man, that's who my father is."
Lucius and Narcissa were not abusive. If anything, they were too loving when he was growing up. All of his faults were, while a product of his upbringing, at least partially his fault. It was always his fault.
And now, here he was in the hospital wing, Harry sitting by his side even though Dumbledore had called him to his office. Harry had explicitly said that he wasn't going to be leaving Draco any time soon, and Draco had no intention of letting him leave before he had properly berated him about all the absolutely
Rage filled Harry. He began to shake as he got his wand out of his pocket; he pointed the wand at Tom and was about to say--
Harry looked confused but could tell that something was wrong, he looked at Ron and then back at Draco, he opened his mouth to say something but was stopped by Ron, he shook his head and they took off, following Hermione.
Harry's train of thought - or lack thereof - crashed and burned at the simple prospect of marrying Draco. Draco Malfoy, his husband. Making goddamn vows? Buying a little house? He wasn't a hopeless romantic by any means - no matter what Ron said - but all that sounded really,
Harry looked furious, more furious than usual. And his face was flushed red. You could even call it Weasley red if you pushed it a bit.
" Draco yelled. He was still incredibly pale but some of his body warmth was starting to come back. He was so close.
Draco didn't know why, but he had to find something in his trunk, his mind was nagging at him to get something from his trunk. Once he was sure no one could see him, he ripped open his trunk, he didn't know what he was looking for, but he knew that he
his favorite student, he was so eager to learn, more eager than any of the other Ravenclaws, and applied himself in all subjects, he was a generalist, not a specialist, and he respected that.
Lucius internally winced. He knew what Draco was doing. Bringing out his guilt from what happened last year.
It was no secret that CPS was awful in their town. The police cared more about drug busts and other things than the lives of a few kids. So it was always up to them to help each other. And they did. Anthony had used that house for this same purpose a few times before. But it had never been this intimate. The people in the neighborhood had just known the house as a small safe space. Adults weren't allowed to go in without permission from his parents (who were in on it too.) And police weren't allowed in if there was an adult inside. It was why they always kept a nanny there. Someone who would just check in to make sure there were no new arrivals.
A loud hiss was heard from the depths of the water that was in front of them. The head of what was most likely the basilisk drifted out of the water. Harry closed his eyes immediately.
But, the telly had never shown a man and a man falling in love, he had never seen it in real life either, was it even an option, or was he just a
Hermione hadn't reacted well to the overflow of letters he had been receiving, she had tried to be happy for him, but her jealousy had shown threw for just a moment, but he knew that she would get over it, that was just Hermione.
"I can't move!" Ron yelled, struggling against the plant. A closer look at it and Draco knew exactly what it was,
his Dad came in asking what all the noise was and he saw us in the fireplace and he got this look on his face but he didn't say anything!" Ron said in a rush, giggling in the middle of the story.
It was littered with rubies that shone even in the dim light of the cavern. The blade looked just sharp enough. It was worth a try; it was better than trying to fling an
"Does it have to do with your father?" Harry asked, he looked shy, but then again, he always looked shy.
"Good, you are not seriously injured." Draco chucked, the man had a fondness for him that Draco returned.
"Sorry, we doubted you mate." One of the beaters said, but Draco wasn't listening, questions were running through his head, he didn't understand, he was confused.
"It's on his trunk, Ron," she said slowly, as if she was speaking to a stupid child. Well, it was Weasley.
"Good thing you're here. McGonagall told me you have to head over to your common room now." Finnigan said, completely ignoring what Draco had asked.
He walked back to his own dorm, he was slowly building a friendship with Potter, and even if that didn't work out, he had Granger as a backup plan, she was better than Weasley anyway. Speaking of Weasley, didn't something happen with the youngest one and the chamber? Oh well, he would pay attention to that when it was important.
"I am talking about how you chanted 'Not Slytherin' under the hat, Lucius has heard about that, and as you can imagine, he didn't take it well."
"Professor, I appreciate the concern but my parents love me very much. And that has nothing to do with my boggart." Draco crossed his arms.
"I knew you had it in you! Was this your plan all along, get close to the mudblood and then break her filthy little heart, good job!" Nott came up to him and patted him on the shoulder, his sentiments were echoed by the rest of his team.
Potter and him weren't exactly 'foes' anymore, as the prophesy had put it, they weren't friends, but then again, prophecies always were a bit off on the details, they didn't exacty have a big vocabulary, did they?
A few people thought it was useless, he was a Malfoy, he would, of course, be in Slytherin, like so many before him.
There were still so many things to do, so, so many. If he really was in the past, then he could change so much, he could prevent so many people from dying, and making some others death's speed up, wormtail would need to be disposed of as soon as possible.
"And who might you be?" He addressed both of them as he sat down at the head of the table, Draco was appalled at the amount of talking, at the manor, they didn't talk nearly as much, or at all unless something had to be said, they did, of course, exchange pleasantries.
"I've told yeh, Snape had nothing ter do with this, he doesn't even know how to calm Fluffy down, he never did like classical music!" Hagrid seemed dead set on defending Snape's honor, while Hermione was still trying to keep him quiet, she never did know when things were hopeless.
"Harry Potter, you must leave here, you are in great danger." Firenze addressed Harry this time, but his eyes never left Draco's. Harry opened his mouth to say something, but Draco grabbed his wrist to stop him.
"Oh, you seem to have it all wrong, Potter. Killing mudbloods is of no use to me now. For many months now, my target has been you." He pointed Draco's wand at Harry and another surge of anger overwhelmed him.
"Draco, are you okay?" Potter seemed concerned, causing Draco to calm down, of course he said that out loud, him and his big mouth, but still, Potter had basically recaped his whole life to him when Draco was getting ready to leave, but he couldn't tell him that he had an invisiblity cloak that basically gave him the ability to do anything at all, well, perhaps the fate of the wizarding world was a tad more important, but-
"Yes, the courting process normally takes about a year or so. It's traditional, and you know how traditional Draco is," she reasoned.
Since Nott had taken Draco's place for this fixed point, the next one that involved Malfoy and Potter would be replaced with Nott and Potter, Nott would become this timeline's Malfoy, but that meant that Nott would also take the dark mark during his sixth year.
"It's policy, Ron. Harry cannot go to Hogsmeade without his permission slip." Hermione flipped a page of her book.
"This vapor." She pointed to a purple flower on her desk that looked oddly familiar. Now that he was paying more attention, he could see the small green puffs of smoke escaping the flower. It was honestly kind of mesmerizing.
"Where did you even get a Dragon Egg, Hagrid?" He asked the half-giant in shock, they were illegal here, but that didn't bother him, what bothered him was that Hagrid's house was built out of wood, and fire and wood didn't exactly combine well, he had grown to actually like the half-giant and his horrible baking skills, he didn't want to see him standing outside his burning house one day, weeping.
"Have your parents given you the talk, Mr. Boot? Oh, Severus, why doesn't Hogwarts include a course like that? We should talk to Dumbledore about it!"
Harry looked at him, and then looked back at Quirrel, with a quick glance at his hands, he threw the stone at Draco and put his hands on Quirrel's face.
Draco had to stop himself from running away. He wasn't ready for the conversation with his father right now. And how was he meant to tell his father that he knew that he had actively tried to kill him? Draco knew he had to feign ignorance, but he wasn't too sure Harry would, given how the boy tensed up when he saw the man.
Draco suddenly felt the urge to laugh, and so he did. He laughed and let himself really enjoy it because Terry was right, he fucking deserved it.
He didn't know if Draco was dead, Tom had never told him. He grabbed Draco by his shoulders and began to shake him, "Draco." He chocked out.
"I have a favor to ask, Severus." Draco cut to the point. Severus hated it when people wasted his time.
Potter however, was starting to confuse him, he was looking at him differently, and he was acting all shy, Draco was confused by his behavior, and he didn't like being confused, he would have to add 'find out what's wrong with Potter' to his to-do-list.
In response, Hermione only slightly loosened her grip, letting Draco breathe again. Was it his imagination or did Harry look a bit jealous? Said boy was looking away with his arms crossed and... was that a pout?
I just wanted to say that I love you all, and this story has received so much more praise than I had ever thought it would, I've been rewatching the movies to make everything a bit more accurate, and I just want you all to know how much I love you.
He opened his eyes when he heard a screech, looking up, he saw Fawkes flying towards the basilisk with something in its claws. It attacked the basilisk, aiming for its eyes he sunk his claws into its eyes, blinding it.
knew exactly what would happen if Terry got expelled. His parents would secretly be overjoyed but also be extremely angry. Which would just create an unpredictable mess when he came home. Terry hated unpredictability.
"Thank you! Hermione was already working herself silly trying to figure out a way to stop them from killing Buckbeak. We didn't even think about asking you!" Harry gave him a quick hug. So quick that Draco could still feel the arms wrapped around him even when they were gone.
They didn't pay him much mind after he aplogized, and mere minutes after he had yelled it out, the word was forgotten. Draco looked back at the book, at the page that had made him so excited, he had figured it out, he had learned why he was having trouble with his visions.
"Mr Malfoy, I'm sure you know what this is about, I have seen the way Ms Granger's performance has dropped, your words really hurt her." Flitwick was looking at him with pain in his eyes.
"Of course I will." Draco took the book and wished he had his bag, it was a weird thing to like, but he liked it when he had a bag full of books in his arms, he liked the weight of it pulling him down.
?" He spat the word. It left a vile taste on his tongue. The simple thought of those creatures never failed to make him ill.
"The Philosopher's stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers, it'll transform any metal into pure gold, and produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal." Draco spoke.
Draco realized that he was really tired. He looked at Harry, yawned, and rested his head on Harry's chest, dozing off.
They were just getting ready to settle down when they heard some ruckus going on behind then, Hermione and Draco turned around to see the Slytherin Quidditch team, as well as the Gryffindor team, arguing.
He could play this off as a seer vision, couldn't he? He opened his mouth to tell her that it was, but the words wouldn't come out, he could say anything else, but not that it was a vision, he tried, but they wouldn't come out, why wouldn't they come out?
Dumbledore chuckled. The tension slowly left the air as the dreamy smile came back onto his face. "He asked me to, Draco. You know that Severus is a master Occlumens, yes?"
Everything he had done was for nothing. He could never deny who he really was, just a failure. Someone who was destined to be an enemy of a savior. The prophecy itself had, the one that Draco himself had foretold labeled himself as nothing more but a foe, someone who needed to be defeated.
Sure, he had a fear of failure but this boggart wasn't even fully grown. If this was what his fear looked like now, what would it look like with an adult boggart?
Draco still had the book in his hand, he ran through his dorm. Where could he get rid of the book? The bathroom, no one used Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, that was why Draco had gone there so much in his sixth year. He could get rid of it there, maybe he could flush it down the toilet? Crude, but it could work.
"Surely you've heard the rumors about him excelling in all his subjects, now we know how he does it, he is magically gifted." Albus chimed in.
The word echoed inside the young Potter's mind, and he started to hyperventilate. Draco stopped, he no longer heard the sound of footsteps behind him, he looked around and saw the lamp that Harry was holding on the floor, he was breathing much too quickly, and Draco hated to admit that he was worried.
And Anthony would get his book. He sighed dreamily just thinking about it. That book cost a few hundred galleons for no good reason other than its new release. But this was Ravenclaw, a book written by such a famous wizarding author was bound to be the talk of the house and he was
"Read this, tell me if you feel some of the symptoms in this." Draco looked down and cringed, it was a book full of disorders, the most prominent one was Multiple Personality Disorder, did he have it? No, he couldn't, he knew what he was going to say.
"Apparently, a house-elf was stealing my mail." Draco dropped his book, what did Dobby do now, and how did Harry find out about that?
"No, it's fine, Draco." Harry scratched the back of his neck, and Draco wanted nothing more than to be swallowed by the floor.
Where was this coming from? He shook his head again, it started to ache for some reason, he would really need that pepper-up.
Some looked at him with fear, and that was even more stupid, they were both 11 for Pete's sake, how were they going to do anything towards them, just because his father was a prat it didn't mean he was as well. But Hermione had to admit that sometimes Draco could be cruel, but that was only towards the people who were mean towards her, like the Slytherins.
"Don't you two read?" Hermione looked at them as if they were idiots, and Draco couldn't help but feel the same way,
And yes he had done what no one else had and had done a non-verbal spell in his first year, but they didn't need to talk about that, there were other things that Flitwick liked about him, he was nothing like how his father had been in school, and while he tried to keep himself from prejudice, he couldn't have helped being surprised at the young man's attitude towards everyone.
