"The secrecy is hard on you," Harry realised. Perhaps harder even than it was on Harry. It was so far removed from what he had believed that he didn't quite know what to do.
Harry nodded as Malfoy's jaw worked as though he was stuck between a number of reactions and finding it impossible to settle on just one.
~o0O0o~
"I am so sorry, Mr Lynch, I find myself unused to such large gatherings," Harry said in response to the man's expectant expression. "I find myself so easily distracted by the noise and the crowd."
"I don't know what to do," he said, embarrassed. Embarrassed for himself, for having Malfoy see him in this state, for Kirke who was little more than a slave to rich men's desires. This was humiliating, all wrong, nothing like he had imagined. He had never wished to see Malfoy on the other side of the room with another man pulling at his perfect clothes.
He saw triumph fill Lucius’s face.
“Be discreet, Draco,” the man himself said, sing-song. “Yes, I know, Harry.” His smile though grew and his demeanour calmed.
Blaise looked at him, evenly. “I know you’re upset, Malfoy, but if you insist on being a boor I shall say goodnight.”
"I didn't know that," Harry retorted, though he'd had a notion. "And I have also met both of your parents, if you recall, and they did not exactly look kindly on our acquaintance."
Harry was prepared for that one, and disinclined to cut Lord Malfoy any slack at all. “The honourable gentleman makes mention of that provision, to which I would indeed ask the committee to turn its attention as there is no adequate definition of ‘similar’ nor indeed is the limitation on what may be ‘reclaimed’ defined.”
Harry watched him storm off and sighed inwardly. He did not have the energy for another of Draco’s tantrums; there was too much to think on now, too much at stake. And it would be ever thus with him, Harry knew: Draco did exactly as he pleased every moment of the day and simply could not understand that Harry was not built that way. Harry had been raised to do his duty. He might falter, he might be selfish at times, but there it was.
Harry slumped into a chair as the door closed, leaving he and Hermione alone.
"Harry," Draco said, oddly uncertain.
Harry nodded into Draco's chest, unable to look at him. "I want," he said, but he could not finish.
Ginny did not deny it. "Will you not sit down?" she said instead.
"Lovely names," Hermione said gently, touching his shoulder.
Diggory closed proceedings for the day after that; Hermione sat with Harry a moment while his guards were called for to transport him back to his cell. “That wasn’t a bad first day,” Hermione mused. “It’s suggestive but that’s all. Nothing there to really damage you in the eyes of the Wizengamot.”
At this Lucius’s mask slipped; the smirk was replaced with a furious hatred. “Do not presume to lecture me about my own son! What could you, a half-blood, understand about the obligations of the Sacred Twenty-Eight? I have raised him to be a Malfoy! We are but caretakers of the name for the next generation and I will not see it destroyed by the whims of a gal-boy!”
“I am sure I’ll find out,” he managed, smiling weakly at Ernie before he made his own escape.
August, which was also her mother’s birthday.
Lucius waved his hand grandly. “You already know what I want, Mr Potter, and your course of action is entirely up to you. I will confine myself to remarking that if you insist on continuing this dalliance with my son, I will be forced to resort to all means at my disposal to separate you.”
“So you can imagine – well, Pansy won’t let me go anywhere near the men she’s dated, never mind if I were actually her brother! Ugh, that woman has harangued me no end about how disrespectful that kind of thing would be to her. You’re lucky Ginny is a more reasonable sort of girl.”
"Lord Potter," Lucius responded sardonically. "The title still sits a little ill on your shoulders, is it not so?"
“You have to take it back!”
"Dumbledore told me– it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live." Harry's voice was gentle now. "When did you last speak to your mother?"
“Entirely understandable,” Burke chipped in from his seat behind the Minister.
That night, Harry could not sleep. The quarrel with Ginny weighed on him; she wanted him to be nicer to her mother, she wanted him to show more genuine interest in her and their family, she wanted him to show her more understanding. But Harry was
“You think he intends to make our relationship public?”
Harry sighed. “I do have to go. It would not look good to miss the first day of sessions. But perhaps you could meet me for lunch?”
"It's beautiful, Harry," Draco said quietly. "Thank you."
Draco looked towards the bedroom door and turned his body toward it, smirking back at Harry over his shoulder. As he walked to the door he slid his waistcoat and shirt from his shoulders, revealing the rippling muscles of his back as the clothes dropped to the floor. Then he was through the doorway and out of Harry's sight, though the sound of rustling fabrics still reached Harry's ears.
"I've never been so famished," Harry said around a mouthful.
o0O0o
"I prefer stories with happier endings," Harry said. "The stories we tell the children are like that."
"And here I offer you the opportunity to change their minds," Draco stormed, pulling his trousers up his legs, "and you dismiss it out of hand."
“Is there anything I can do?”
Lucius kept his face straight though Harry could feel a smirk emanating from him. “Minister, in light of this witness’s refusal to answer questions, I ask that he be recalled under
Harry knew instinctively that if he were to follow where Malfoy would lead, his life would never be the same. It would be far, far safer to decline politely, return home, kiss his wife's forehead and know himself forever as a man who had denied what he wanted not from any righteousness, but because he was a coward.
Terry looked at Draco for a minute before his eyes widened. "Holy hell, Harry's single."
Spelling's was on Knockturn Alley, and Harry folded up the collar of his cloak lest he be recognised. Draco looked at him in amusement.
Harry swallowed hard. He didn't dare move. He didn't know what was happening to him, only that there was a terrible danger here that he couldn't see, couldn't understand.
"Oh?" Harry said, hoping his voice didn't sound as unnatural to Aberforth as it did to himself.
Draco. “But you wanted me to believe it was from today?”
"Those days are such a blur," Harry confessed. "Always something to do, some threat to my life or someone else's. Ginny would say I couldn't see past my nose." A flash of discomfort at the thought of Ginny, as always, but Harry let it pass.
Harry frowned. "What makes you say that?"
"My dear, you are exhausted. Come on, in you go, nothing to be ashamed of."
Harry did not want to, Lord how he did not want to. He thought of his own father and how he'd done everything he could to make him proud even though he was gone. He thought of Lucius Malfoy striking his son with his cane and calling him a disappointment to his face.
Harry folded his arms firmly across his chest to keep the lancing pain the thought of losing Draco caused from tearing him apart.  He looked Sirius full in the face and said simply, "I love him, Sirius."
"I will see you soon," Harry said, his voice too heavy for the public place and the mid-morning air. He could think only of the pleasure to come and his relief at having managed to arrange things so well in so short a time.
Harry's jaw tightened. "The charm they were talking about could be used to torture people, Draco, or at the very least humiliate them."
"That is very kind," Harry said automatically. "I confess I find myself at a disadvantage; I have been here for a fortnight but this is the first time I have encountered anyone familiar. I had not thought to find company at all."
He was so hard, harder than he had ever been and all he wanted was to touch the rest of Draco's body, all lithe and pale and stretched out for him to
Kreacher bowed again; Harry didn't stay to watch him.
Draco laughed at this, and reached for the buttons on Harry's waistcoat.
"Harry," Sirius said helplessly, squeezing his shoulder. "She isn't going to die. She's going to be fine, they both are."
Lucius got to make his opening remarks first. He stood slowly, his catlike grace reminding Harry of Draco so strongly that he had to close his eyes against it for a moment. “Wizards and witches of the Wizengamot,” he began. “The case I will make here today is quite simple. Harry Potter solicited other young men into acts of gross indecency. Some may say this is wildly out of character for a man so renowned for his heroics and indeed, it may at first appear so. But Harry Potter used his fame and the rumours of his abilities to both encourage and even extort indecencies, as you will hear from our witnesses.
," the glass Harry had smashed came back to a whole. Harry passed him the decanter, then poured his own drink, sitting opposite Draco as he reached for the cigarette case.
Harry hesitated. "Blaise Zabini."
Instead, Harry nodded. “I rather thought you might.”
"I am tired, Harry," Ginny said quietly. "It is pleasant to have nothing to worry about beyond resting and I am sure that it is terribly dull for a man of your position…"
"The idea is so disgusting to you?" Draco's tone had been angry, laced through with hurt. "Is the thought of being so very close to me truly nothing but repellent?"
"Were you really such an innocent?" Draco wondered aloud, equal parts incredulous and amused. "I wondered – I wasn't sure…"
The abrupt jerk of the carriage rounding a corner forced them apart.
"In any case," Lord Draco went on, reaching into a pocket, "here is my card. It is never too late to form an acquaintance. Good evening to you, Mr Potter. Lord Black."
Harry raised his hand to his brow, rubbing his fingers across his forehead. He was starting to wrinkle there, he could feel it. "I know, Sirius, I know. But with Ginny's health still being what it is, and so many people expected to attend a presentation…"
Draco looked at him. "You will not take me."
Something nasty flashed across Filch’s face but he returned to his chorus of “sirs” at once as the boys filed in.
” and all at once Harry was bound in ropes.
At the last moment, though, Draco pulled away, coming in a stream over Harry's face and down his chest. His aim wasn't perfect and some spattered onto the couch. Harry, his eyes watering a little, looked up at Draco a little reproachfully but Draco was already on his knees again, leaning forward to inhale deeply.
"If it causes you distress I will not speak of it," Draco said softly. "I thought it would be but an enjoyable story. I do not think of these things as you do. Seeing you with Kirke - I thought you made a beautiful tableau. It did not give me pause."
Crabbe Senior hovered behind Lord Malfoy, a grim smile on his face. Another Death Eater who had dodged Azkaban by the skin of his teeth and the application of considerable gold and influence. Harry eyed him for a moment before turning back to Lord Malfoy. "Quite."
"But she only invites me for your sake; Remus and Teddy she will invite in any case."
“Oh yes?” Sirius frowned.
"Indeed the journey is long. Your wife needs her rest, I think?"
. But he couldn't break the kiss, couldn't stop touching Draco's face, and his hips jerked involuntarily forward.
“Pending the results of the initial enquiry.” Diggory gave him a sympathetic look and clasped him on the shoulder. “Look, Potter, I know you’re a good sort and you did what you could for Cedric back when. I won’t forget that. But the Ministry feels that it might be as well for you to take a few days while we sort through all the mad accusations, what? Most likely it will all come to nothing very quickly and you can get back to normal. In the meantime, it’s a good chance for you to visit your wife. See the youngsters and all that.”
No, not forever.
With a new baby, Harry was excused from socialising for a while.
Malfoy seemed to genuinely enjoy the opera. Harry could not really follow it, his attention all for the side of Malfoy's face illuminated by the stage light.
"It does appear like a dream," Draco admitted, "all the details dulled to distance, yet somehow distinct and oppressive; unmistakeably reality."
Malfoy looked at him. A shaky laugh escaped from his lips, lips Harry had bruised with his mouth.
He sighed and turned to look at Diggory. “I don’t suppose it was much of a defence, really. But it was what I needed to say.”
"I can imagine."
Molly didn't seem to know quite what to say beyond, "Lovely to have you, Harry dear." She nodded at Sirius, who pressed a kiss to her cheek. She stepped back as Sirius straightened, and Arthur slung an arm around her shoulders. The four of them stood there, looking at one another.
“Pansy!”
A small hurt sound from the other end of the parlour had Sirius whirling to shout, "Not even Regulus, Kreacher!"
Harry looked at Malfoy, then Nott, then back to Malfoy.
"Blaise," Lady Malfoy said reprovingly.
"They don't have to," Harry said fiercely. Ginny looked up at him, startled. Whatever she saw in his face caused her expression to soften.
Concentrate, Draco. “More something I want to talk about,” he said, choosing his words carefully.  “You know how the world gossips.”
"Brandy? I think you need it, my boy!" Sirius said, giving that barking laugh of his.
A gentle hand on his arm made Harry look up, startled. "Are you determined to alienate all those who care for you?"
Sirius was still looking at him, expectant.
"I told you no, Hermione," said Harry firmly. "No, you do not know what happens between Ginny and I. You and Ron have your own children and your lives to attend to but I had barely seen you for months before this happened and with Ginny so ill and everything focused on the children, I was lonely."
"Right," Harry said, as though it made any sense in the context of what had happened. "Er," he forced out another syllable. It made Lord Draco's expression turn positively sardonic. "Good to see you again, Malfoy."
Mercifully, Potter chose that moment to step in. “Malfoy, in my office. You can’t assault a citizen here of all places! Baddock, sorry, Applebee will take your statement now.”
"Charming lady," Narcissa said.
"Shall we sit, then?" Narcissa said.
Malfoy shook his head, his smirk never fading though Harry would have sworn there was a spark of anger in his steel-grey eyes. "Go back to bed, Potter," he said as he walked past Harry and to his own disappointment, Harry let him go.
Kirke had freed Harry's cock from his trousers. Where Bertram had licked and teased, Kirke leaned forward and in one motion swallowed Harry's cock to the root. Harry's hip jerked and he gave a small cry, catching Malfoy's attention. Harry's hands curled into fists at his sides as he forced himself to concentrate on the exquisite sensation of a willing mouth on his body, something he had never dared ask his proper wife to do. He forced himself to look Malfoy in the eyes as desire overcame them both. Harry was panting, Malfoy moaning. He took in all the details of Malfoy's body and desperately ignored the realities of what they were doing there. Then, in another moment, he no longer had to wish away the world.
"You look very handsome, my dear," Ginny said. Her confinement had left her with a pallor which went beyond even the fashion for pale skin, but her red hair was still gloriously bright and her eyes the soft hazel he had always found comforting. Harry felt a pang of remorse for the distance which had existed between them and swore to himself for the hundredth time since her recovery that he would do nothing to risk hurting her. It meant so much to him that she could stand by him now and tuck her hand into his elbow, that she would be at his side to greet even Malfoy – and if this thought disturbed Harry a little it also strengthened him. Even Malfoy would not dare create a scene at an event such as this with his father in attendance, surely?
"Malfoy," Ron spat again. "I had hoped that we would never have to deal with him again.”
Draco looked at him with scorn. "Curtail my freedom? For what! I can barely even get it up for a woman so what would I do with a wife?"
The members of the Wizengamot were silent, all looking right at Harry. The public gallery was full again but now had additional guards to keep the peace.
Remus smiled kindly at Harry. "Do you truly believe that this is the best thing for you at this time?"
"Oh," Harry said stupidly.
“It’s Auror Weasley,” came a familiar voice. Harry laughed his relief; he had wondered if an old enemy would take this opportunity to take him out permanently or, worse, if some misguided former DA members would try to break him out, making everything worse.
All three stood and bowed. Lucius exited on one side of the courtroom, Harry and Hermione to another followed by the ubiquitous guards.
Harry honestly couldn't decide which of the women was the more unsettling: Lady Malfoy in her strict adherence to decorum or Kore Zabini, looking at him as though he were something to eat.
"Would you let me see them?" Harry asked, hating himself. "If they don't… If one day I'm free again. Would you?"
“The Department of Mysteries has already been tasked with the latter, so I must assume the learned gentleman is rather preoccupied with the former,” Ernie added.
“You do love to gossip,” Charlie said, his mouth set in a straight line.
Ginny sighed and thought for a moment. Then, "Can we go to the Quidditch match at Holyhead? I think the Harpies are playing the Prides, if I remember my fixtures."
"I fear it," Harry acknowledged at last.
"Has he been accepted?" Harry asked. "You mentioned that he was hoping to train as a Healer."
An excellent question. It felt as though about a year had passed since Lucius had handed Harry his card in the committee room.
and a range of slurs. Diggory was shouting, trying to restore order and Hermione was looking down at Harry in horror.
Harry had not pressed, knowing that to do so would only give rise to questions he would not know how to answer. He merely steeled himself as best he could against the inevitable encounter, and concentrated on planning.
"I was just thinking about you," Draco whispered when Harry pulled back. "I was just lying here and thinking about you and I felt myself begin to grow hard." He caught Harry's hand and brought it to his groin by way of proof. Harry squeezed gently, and felt Draco's cock grow from half to fully erect.
“You were always good at fighting for your life, though. And this is every bit as serious.”
Harry did the only thing he could think of, reaching out as he had wanted to do since Draco had entered the room. His wand was still clutched in his right hand so he reached out with his left, grasping the back of Draco's neck and pulling him closer. He kissed Draco to quiet him, just a touch of lips, and then pressed their foreheads together, breathing in Draco's scent and feeling the heat of his body so near.
“We call our first witness, Mr Edgar Simpson.”
"See, Malfoy?" Zabini raised a cool eyebrow.
Half past four, and Draco was feeling no pain. Three out of three competitors diverted, giving him a clear shot at getting into Potter’s pants.
At once his mind turned back to that day at the Hog's Head. Malfoy had been kind, that was what Harry remembered. That was what had surprised him. Malfoy had not been rough with him, had not shouted at him or reacted badly when Harry had called him names. Malfoy had forced the issue, certainly, but he had not in the end pushed Harry further than he was able to go.
The evening drew on and darkness fell. Harry smoked and sighed and caught up on reading the papers which would be considered at committee over the next few days. Eventually, though, he tried again to knock on the door.
“He could not do that without exposing himself to ridicule. No, Harry, he is far more subtle than you can conceive. Because of all the many things you are, subtle is not one of your qualities.”
"Draco, were you about to tell me a story of you with another man?" Harry knew his tone had grown sharp but he couldn't help himself.
“Thank you Minister. Now, esteemed members of the Wizengamot, I have been through the whole of this case. I have pointed out to you its strength, and I have to ask you to do your duty in regard to it. I have already spoken to that appeal which my learned friend made to the past heroism of Harry Potter. With that we have in this case nothing whatever to do. He has a right to be acquitted if you believe him to be an innocent man, be his lot high or low. But if, in your consciences you believe that he is guilty of these charges – charges, I am obligated to point out that he had admitted in his own words – well, then you have only one consideration, and that is to follow closely the obligation of the oath which has been laid upon you.”
“You can’t do that! You—”
“Draco!” someone snarled through the fireplace, finally loud enough that Draco fell out of his bed, awoken for just long enough from the crippling hangover which appeared to have taken over the left side of his skull to tumble to the ground.
"Yes, yes, Father, I know what 'becomes' a Malfoy," Draco sneered.
"Did you agree with them?"
"Draco…" Harry groaned, but he had brought it on himself.
"Every moment," Draco echoed with a sardonic smile which didn't quite hide the fact that he meant it. "I was so bored. And Nott kept trying to get me to go on the most asinine outings. 'Malfoy, there's a new play at the Royalty. Malfoy, there's a
Harry found himself rather less able to defend himself on that score. "I have not been bombarded with invitations," he said and while it was true it was little excuse. Between themselves there had never been much formality.
"It came on so suddenly!" Harry burst out, relieved at last to be able to speak of this. Perhaps it was by telling a dear friend even part of the truth that he might lance the boil, deprive Malfoy of his power over him. "I was not looking for any such thing, Hermione, I swear it, but now my thoughts, my dreams, everything is changed and I do not want to, I
“Mr Kirke, how do you know Argus Filch?”
Draco raised his eyebrows. "There is the rest of tonight. Even tomorrow."
Harry was already shaking his head. “And your father would permit that? Would leave you alone when you still have not supplied him with an heir to your name?”
"Most operas are," Harry said. “I did not know that you cared for such things.”
"About my criminal infatuation with my own sex?" Draco shook his head; Harry felt the movement though he could not see it. "Even I did not know until later."
Draco did not answer.
"So in fact between school and such visits, Miss Granger as was spent barely any time at all with her family even before she left them behind to spend her life in our world. Well and so, one cannot live forever with one’s loyalties divided and of course she would want to leave the Muggle world behind! But by her very existence, she has exposed our world to an entire Muggle family, who perhaps have friends, who in turn have acquaintances..."
As they took their seats, the house elves arrived with the tea service.
With that in his thoughts and Draco in his arms it was impossible to say anything other than, "I will, if you ask it. But Draco, are you sure this is a good idea?"
Harry hoped rather than believed him to be right.
Draco did not speak, but he took Harry’s hand and squeezed his fingers gratefully.
"Including those we cannot predict?" Nott chimed in.
Draco nodded slowly. He reached into his breast pocket and said, "Terry, have you seen one of these?"
“Where on Earth did you pick up that obnoxious phrase?” said Pansy. “Still watching those repulsive Muggle television shows?”
Blaise visibly forced himself to relax. “I suppose I should have expected that,” he said in his usual sardonic tones.
He winced even as he said it. Definitely time to listen to Pans about those television programmes.
Nine hours of pacing and shrieks later, Harry was holding a tiny bundle of pink tinged with red: his daughter. Wrapped in white lace, she was hideous and beautiful as only new-born babies can be; Harry held in her in his arms and adored her.
Draco didn’t much care for that type of girl, the nice girl-next-door-who-has-lots-of-sex. Even though he wasn’t an affirmed cock lover in those days, his female type had been, well, Pansy: a femme fatale who’d make you pay for every inch. Draco did love a challenge, no matter the plumbing.
Harry took a deep, shuddering breath. "We cannot allow him to run our lives.  We
“He…” Kirke trailed off. “He duelled me. He is far stronger than I. If I were a better wizard, I would hardly be in my line of work.”
The words flicked through the air like a whipcrack. Harry looked up, stricken by the tone of his voice, the expression on his face. “No, Draco, no, of course not.” He hauled Draco into his arms. “If it’s not something you can countenance then we shall have to find another way.”
"Please, do watch," Malfoy said as Bertram leaned forward and took Malfoy's cock in his hand, guiding it to his mouth. Malfoy's eyes grew lazy, pleased. Obscene wet slurping sounds filled the air as Bertram worked Malfoy's cock. Harry writhed, uncomfortable as his trousers grew tighter.
Malfoy was there with Zabini and his other usual companion, the man with the protruding teeth. Malfoy himself was dressed in powder blue and looked as luminous as ever. It seemed he was in the middle of losing a great deal of money at the card table; Harry took a deep breath and crossed the room, telling himself that this time, he could not falter.
s before slumping into bed beside him.
"Of course, Harry," Hermione said at once.
There was a long silence. Then at last Draco's voice said, "Come in."
Harry turned to leave the room but stopped when Ginny called, "Harry?"
And on and on. Harry was not, it must be said, enthusiastic about his entry into politics. He would frankly rather have been on a field facing down a Dark wizard with only his wand in his hand. For a moment he speculated on how a duel between himself and Lucius would go, wondered if it was worth suggesting such a thing despite its illegality in order to resolve this matter once and for all.
An immaculate Blaise Zabini was not who he had expected.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he went, green powder in hand. At the other end, a butler was waiting to greet him with a "Good evening, sir!" and Harry passed him his cloak and top hat, privately thinking how ridiculous it was to wear such things just to take a Floo journey.
Sirius' eyebrows rose. "I did not know you were acquainted."
Sirius left him and Harry was glad of it. His head was still swimming with the strange things Madam Pomfrey had said – something about water breaking early but labour not beginning, something that had soaked the bed sheets with blood and caused his brave, strong Ginny to scream in agony, something that had probably been caused by the carriage journey she had not wanted to take. Harry slumped backwards against the banister. Ginny had been suffering and she had told him she had been suffering and Harry had ignored her. Harry had resented her.  Harry had gone to a bawd house with a lust for a man spiralling through him while his wife and third child nearly died.
“Mmph,” came out before Draco’s brain caught up and he started to kiss back. Potter’s hand clasped the back of his neck while his other hand rested on Draco’s clavicle. The hard planes of his body, lithe and muscled, pressed against Draco from groin to chest and Draco sat back on the desk so he could wrap his legs around Potter’s body and pull him closer.
Ginny nodded slowly. "That does have a certain appeal. Harry, what do you think?"
“Is that a joke? He had hundreds and an Auror on the payroll. Harry,” Draco walked around him to impress him with the seriousness of his words, “we can’t beat him. He has friends everywhere, fingers in all the pies and he is an aristocrat. You… you think too middle-class.” Harry made a noise at this but Draco persisted. “You do, Harry. You are a hero to many of course but you have not played on that or leveraged it and that was fine when you wanted to live quietly but if you want to face down the Establishment you cannot do it from your current position.”
"I needed you to come back to me," Draco replied.
The words curled around Harry in unmistakable invitation, the heat of Malfoy's breath on his face turning Harry hot all over. He looked up to see gleaming grey eyes, challenging and defiant, daring him to action.
“To ask a favour?”
Lucius. Harry had been anticipating this; he had already been invited several times to meet but had carefully declined, citing prior engagement after prior engagement. Apparently Lucius had grown tired of waiting, and he, too knew which hotel Harry and Draco resided in. He had been waiting in the sitting room when Harry arrived, dressed in silver brocade robes with the air of someone who could easily wait a year and enjoy every moment.
Harry closed his eyes against the rising tide of lust. His body was shaking already, he could feel it.
"Indeed. How often now does she see her family?"
Lucius’s eyebrow twitched. He held Harry’s gaze as he nodded, just slightly.
Harry's arms gave out at last and he collapsed, clinging to Draco whose body still shook, his panting breath hot on Harry's cheek.
August had come and so the ball was to be held outside, in a quiet corner of St James' Park which would be warded against non-magical visitors for the occasion. Sirius had insisted once again on footing the bill, which must surely have run into hundreds of galleons.
"I'm no longer playing this hand, Draco, if you recall." Zabini looked at Harry. "I could instead look after our new friend."
Hermione frowned a moment before her expression cleared. "Oh! A love potion? And you a married man, Harry! What kind of woman would do such a thing?"
Draco would normally have scoffed and said something abrasive but he just couldn’t this time. “Blew my mind,” he said. “Literally. Can’t think.”
“Standard three-stage misdirect,” he said. “Can you help with initial distractions?”
“Hm,” was all the warning Draco got before Potter swallowed him down, sliding his mouth down to the base of Draco’s cock and pressing gently behind his balls with his fingers. Draco gave a gurgling cry and
Harry would not fear him, but he now better understood Sirius' words: Lord Malfoy was a skilled orator, articulate and convincing as he made arguments that ran counter to everything in which Harry believed.
“And you credit Draco Malfoy for this?”
Harry and Ginny had barely taken their assigned seats before Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy arrived, wearing robes much finer than the occasion warranted. Lucius was dressed entirely in black, as was his wont; Narcissa entirely in ice-white. Harry wondered for a moment if that was why Draco insisted on bright rainbow colours before he found himself nose to nose with the father of his lover.
"But you want to be," Draco probed.
"Not finished yet."
In three abrupt strides Malfoy had crossed the room, walking so close that Harry could smell his breath, full of mead, and the faint scent of soap emanating from his warm skin. "Do you think I don't know why you came with me, Potter?" he said, leaning even closer, far too close for comfort. "Do you think me too naïve to see what you make so clear?"
“Lord Malfoy,” Harry returned coldly.
Harry nodded sharply and moved to the next item on his mental list. “Ginny,” he said to himself. “What do I say to Ginny?” Even thinking about it made him flinch.
She looked tired, Harry thought. Tired and pale. Unhappy. He knew it.
Padfoot squirmed a little before whining his acceptance.
"I want to," Draco said simply. "I want you to be mine and only mine, to forget about everything in this world other than you and I."
“You think this would not follow me there?”
"Indeed, yes," Sirius said. "I should write to him to finalise the details." He clapped Harry on the shoulder. "But not this evening. This evening, I think you and I should attend the opera!"
“I thought you weren’t coming,” Potter breathed as he broke the kiss.
At once, Harry realised what was going on. "Then of course you must call me Harry," he said and she beamed at him. "It was most kind of you both to include me in a family occasion such as this one."
Ginny was right; Harry had no knack whatsoever for subterfuge.
Harry reached up and stroked his thumb along Draco's jaw, gently pushing him onto his back. Harry looked at him, all muscle and sinew. There was no spare flesh on his body; he was sharp angles and the steady thrum of passion beneath porcelain skin.
"So tell me," Draco said, his breath tickling Harry's ear. "What tribulations did the day bring?" His hands came up to rub at Harry's shoulders, soothing the tension from his body.
"Pansy?" Harry persisted. "Blaise? Any of your friends?"
Draco moaned low in his throat and looked up at Harry, anguished. "That is what I most desire and you know it. But Harry, I can't, not like this. I would only hurt you."
“Last time a renter tried to blackmail me I
"Sirius," Mrs Bones said warmly. "And Mr Potter, of course. How do you do?"
Harry’s hands balled into fists.
“I’m sorry I let you down,” he whispered into Sirius’s ear.
"Mother, please let Mr Potter alone, he is here to support his wife in regaining her strength," Zabini said in exasperation.
"Exactly," said Sirius.
"Of course he was."
"Kreacher, what…" Harry began but then all at once Dobby appeared next to Kreacher and Harry was ushered into the house at once.
Harry sighed deeply and sank into a chair. “We could talk this through for ever and I doubt I’d grow closer to seeing a way out of this mess.”
“You always choose everyone else instead of me,” Draco said, soft and self-pitying. “And you’re going to do it again.”
Ginny shifted slightly, holding out her hand to touch their daughter's delicate fingers. "I had some ideas," she whispered. "But now I see her, none of them are quite right. What is your opinion?"
"I can sleep when I'm finished," Draco snaps. He can't afford to lose concentration, can't afford to lose a single drop of the liquid.
Teddy shook his head. "Sorry, Uncle Harry, I don't remember receiving it – how rude of me not to reply!"
"There is," she said hesitantly, "a condition."
"No," Terry said at once. "No, he'd never cheat on Wood, he's much too loyal."
"I believe young Malfoy to be trouble," Sirius said flatly. "If you are wise you will not allow him the opportunity to prove it."
“Perhaps.” It occurred to Harry, not for the first time, that he barely knew anything about his wife’s state of mind these days. “She is I think much improved, fully recovered from Lily’s difficult birth.”
Harry managed a watery smile at Ginny, frantic for her to believe that all was well even as his own heart raced.
Teddy beamed. "She is still very young but I believe that there may be an understanding growing between us."
o0O0o
Sirius had not enjoyed the hunting trip one bit.
“Mrs Weasley, any objection?”
“You aren’t,” Draco said simply. “That is all Father’s doing.”
"Can you?"
Tea at Malfoy Manor was not precisely the kind of event Harry would have attended of his own free will. Draco had dressed in black, which was as sure a sign of tension as the pinched shape of his lips. Harry was far from relaxed himself: this was an incredibly risky move on his part he knew, but if there was the slightest chance it would help Draco then he had to do it, pure and simple.
He is dead, Draco thought, willing it to be otherwise, willing the whole world to bend and make his desire reality. Who am I now is who he called me into being; he brought me to life though he may despise us both for what I become. He will always be a hero but when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of who he really was, who we both were, will speedily vanish.
"Well, of course I was in Slytherin house," Lord Draco said. "We did not often fraternise with the other houses."
"Good day, Potter," he snarled.
Draco’s glazed expression cleared a little in shock. “You want me to…”
~o0o~
But tonight he could not sleep.
His wand shook as he cursed Weasley, watched him fall to the ground immobilised. Billowing hatred swelled in him; he remembered breaking Potter's nose when what he'd really wanted was to wank off on his face. He didn't break Weasley's nose, though he couldn't deny the urge to touch himself. He couldn't touch Harry now, not now, not ever again.
“I brought you this,” Sirius said quietly, offering him a phial of turquoise-blue liquid.
It was the first time he’d been here and it appeared rather plainer than he might have expected. But then, Diggory was not a man given to ostentation and Harry could easily imagine there had once been gold inlay and fabulous artworks which he had seen fit to remove.
"Potter?" Kore repeated with some interest.
Harry frowned as another thought struck him. "Is that why—"
“Er,” said Harry.
"Kreacher." He looked past him into the corridor. "Are you here alone?"
That gold, that distinctive glowing gold, could have been nothing but Malfoy's robes, and even as Harry chastised himself, he was turning to look again.
Harry had thought he might feel better after taking such an action – and indeed he did, but not for very long. His imagination was still running wild. He had never been very good at disciplining his thoughts, always behind in Occlumency lessons. Harry knew who he was, knew his flaws and now his habit of running on pure instinct was threatening to cost him dearly.
At that, Draco stilled.
"I am gratified to hear it," Lord Malfoy said smoothly. "Family values are so important. A pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter."
An elf cracked into existence and bowed. “Yes, Master Blaise?”
"Thank you," Draco whispered and celebrated by fisting his hand in Harry's hair, devouring that mouth all over again. Everything subtly different but all of it feeling so right. Harry here, right here, separated from Draco by nothing but fabric. Draco gasped between frantic kisses, startled by the coldness of the tongue which met his own.
Draco made some terrible incoherent sound as Harry ran his tongue along the rim of his hole. Fingers scrabbled at the table edge when Harry did it again, licking and tasting that most secret part of his lover. His beloved. He could think it now, even though he said it but rarely; saying the words felt too much like putting his soul into Draco's keeping, more even than when the two were connected in the most intimate of joinings.
"I remember thinking before, though," Harry went on, "that Ginny would like to have a girl. We are thinking of Lily, perhaps, or Molly."
He was somewhat relieved when Madam Pomfrey came to him a few hours later to say simply, "It's started. Your wife is having the baby."
"You were the one adamant that you needed no such break.”
Sirius nodded.  "Propitious timing. My cousin Nymphadora fell pregnant.  The young man in question had departed for overseas and as she was unmarried, the scandal would have damaged the family for years."
Harry rolled him over more fully, pulling at Draco's buttocks with his hands until he was open for Harry to view. There it was, pink and perfect and beautiful as Draco's mouth, and Harry couldn't resist lowering his mouth to taste it.
,” Draco said, but his hands were trembling. Harry took them in his, held them tightly.
Draco came on an all-but-silent gasp and after a moment's recovery he stood up, smiling his half-smile half-sneer inches from Harry's face. "Harry," he replied, and then they were kissing. Harry could taste himself salty on Draco's tongue and he would have expected to be revolted but instead he felt a fresh bolt of lust.
It was a silver sickle smoothed flat on the reverse side with green enamel forming the shape of a leaf. Surrounding it, an engraved statement of purpose.
"Have you thought yet of what you will do for Christmas?"
"You know I cannot resist you," Harry gasped, wrenching himself away, "but I must go, I must!"
"Just let go," Malfoy whispered. "I know what you want. Just let go."
to do, but not quite yet."
~o0O0o~
Draco says—"
The pregnancy had been hard even before the scare for Ginny's life. Harry had hoped that with some time she would be again the Ginny he remembered but it seemed that was not a reasonable expectation after all.
When Hermione arrived she took one look at him and burst out, “Oh
“Excellent notion in principle, but I would rather not await its arrival.”
In his shock, Harry could say nothing,
When he returned to the other room, Sirius was laughing with Arthur. Almost the entire clan Weasley had assembled, and there in the corner by her brother Charlie was Ginny.
When a loud
In the morning, he washed and dressed, and headed first to Gringotts to convert some of his Galleons into sovereigns, and from there to the hotel to make a payment on his bill. He thought about giving the suite up entirely, but he knew what Draco would make of that and he honestly did not know where they could go from here.
Harry smiled and bent to brush a kiss over Draco’s mussed hair where it hung over his forehead. “And what excitements will your day bring?”
known but hadn’t thought it through, as was so often the case when it came to Draco. Would this be seen by others as a kind of declaration? Harry despaired of himself. Why did he never think anything through?
"Would you like that, Potter?" Malfoy asked Harry with the tone of one laying down a challenge.
Harry lifted his teacup to his mouth. He had meant only to visit in passing, but Sirius had been so happy to see him; he had again been deprived of company in recent weeks, what with Remus being busy at Hogwarts and Harry focused on Draco. Sirius had few friends, though he was received by all the best families.
Harry nodded. “I suppose it was too much to hope that this might be quiet a little longer.”
“Seriously?” Draco straightened. “You don’t think she’d want to have another crack at Potter herself, do you? I mean, I could definitely see that Blaise wouldn’t mind a little ménage…”
After they had finished, Malfoy had pulled out his wand and cleaned them both up. Now he stood watching Harry dress.
Draco scoffed.
“No,” Draco lied.
"Lord Potter, Lady Ginevra," Narcissa said. Her tone was not quite as snide as her husband's but there was definitely the disdain of a Pureblood looking down on the blood traitors and half-bloods in her midst. Harry wondered just how furious she must be that he would inherit her family title.
Meanwhile Sirius kept giving him curious glances and asking if he were well. The whole situation was intolerable.
Draco's mouth curved. "But where shall we go?"
Kore looked only slightly disappointed. "In any case, we should be going or we shall be late for our treatments this morning and Mr Urquhart was
The day before had shocked him to his very soul. He had been so ready to believe that Zabini had been right to warn him off, that Draco had turned on him out of fear of his father, perhaps, or spite, or heartbreak… Draco lashed out, certainly, but Harry knew him and his absence – that wasn’t who Draco was. If he wasn’t here to either rub Harry’s face in his indifference or try to save him, it wasn’t of his own doing.
"Perhaps he does know," said Draco.
But that night it was Teddy's wet skin Harry saw in his mind before he fell asleep.
Then it was gone.
Harry felt the door fall closed behind him.
February?”
“And how did you respond?”
"Anywhere," Harry said with a small shrug.
"Finish?" Harry said before he could stop himself.
o0O0o
“Yes, Minister.”
At once the courtroom filled with the sound of hissing from the crowd.
Ginny was exhausted but she was smiling as she lay back against the pillows, so strong, always so strong.
Ron looked well, the warm sun beginning to paint even more freckles on his face. Hermione's hair kept escaping from its elegant knot and Ron kept reaching out to straighten it for her the way he had in school. Harry's chest ached a little at the easy affection between them. It had been that way once for him and Ginny.
Zabini's eyes widened in mock-innocence. "We are merely asking Potter whether he agrees that one should be expected to accept responsibility for all the consequences of one's actions, whether intended or not, whether anticipated or unexpected?"
Harry understood.
Frantic, then. “I am. I’m sorry, Draco, I received a shock last night and I’m afraid I became rather inebriated.”
Blaise sighed. “Potter, I really do not have all day.”
Harry eyed him speculatively. “Do we have enough time to—”
“A migraine,” he replied.
“I don’t appreciate being made to feel like an interloper in our home.”
Harry kissed Draco's mouth again gently, stroking his hands over the lines of Draco's chest. "I wish-"
"Marriage involves hard choices and sacrifices," Remus ventured, watching Harry's face closely.
“It’s all true!” Kirke snapped. “I’ll take
“You routinely cleaned the suite in which Mr Potter resided?”
“She is growing well,” Ginny said. “I did not know you had developed a friendship with Draco Malfoy.”
~o0o~
be permitted to ruin my life. Our life,” Draco replied as he tugged at Harry’s shirt.
"Ginny dear!"
nothing but stare at the closest living man he had ever had to a father, and wonder what Sirius must think of him now.
“Draco is… not available,” Lucius said flatly.
It should have been him, shouldn't it? If he was going to love a man, it should have been Ron. Harry could have lived with that, even knowing that it would never be. Harry could have understood it. He didn't understand Draco at all and likely never would. Beautiful, yes. Complicated and intelligent but still shallow and selfish. Harry knew all of that but it changed nothing.
This was it, at last, then. “You would make him miserable. You have shown him no love and you would destroy it where he finds it.”
"Yes," Draco said quietly.
Draco whimpered and Harry realised he must have said part of that at least out loud. He bit down on Draco’s throat causing him to shout out. The drag of herringbone robes against Draco’s pale skin, the tension and fury of Harry’s desire, all of it culminated in Draco spilling over Harry’s fingers with a cry.
He did not know why until he found himself looking at the Black family tree. Without meaning to, Harry located Draco Malfoy and ran his fingers over the name and face, which smirked with almost as much fire as the subject. Harry traced the curve of those lips and remembered how watching them had made him feel, first that night at the Bones' when he had merely looked and wondered and then today in Diagon Alley, the sight of Malfoy's tongue knocking the breath from Harry's body. Something long-suppressed abruptly flared into life, dancing on Harry's skin, making him ache to experience the delights that mouth might yield. He wished he had been that boy in that filthy alley, with Malfoy's tongue in his mouth and hands on his body.
“And what would you have me do, Draco?” Harry shouted. “Kowtow to him? Sell out the last of my principles so that you can hold on to yours?
"It must not be!" Draco screamed and at last the lightning swelled and burst free, crashing out in all directions, filling the whole room with light and electricity and sending Draco tumbling away from the body and away from consciousness itself.
~o0O0o~
Harry grimaced, an expression which felt far more natural than a smile. “I have had occasion to learn much in little time.”
Harry had faced death and hiding and torture and torment but all of that had been for a discernible greater good. What was this all for? The sake of a man who barely looked his way any more?
Sirius nodded. "The Boneses only receive him because he retained his place on the Wizengamot. His family is among the darkest. The Ministry have been trying for years to confiscate their library of dark texts but somehow the Aurors are never able to find it when they search."
And then, right around the time Draco was beginning to pay attention, to wonder if Potter really could be that good, to wonder if it would be worth pursuing…
The door opened. An unhealthily thin, rodent-faced man stood there dressed in a suit he clearly believed to be fine, but looked far, far cheaper than anything either of his guests would have considered. "My lord!" the man said. "Come again – and with a friend. Do enter."
"So he'll think…"
As Harry moved to turn away, his attention was caught by a stranger who had evidently caught him looking. A man about his own age, blond and lithe, was looking at him as one might look at a plate before eating from it. Discomfited, Harry looked away.
Harry washed himself quickly and left a note for Sirius in the library asking if he might come for dinner soon. He then Apparated to the safe spot in the park by the hotel and was back there by ten o’clock in the morning. The suite was deserted and Harry feared for a moment that Draco had panicked and gone to search for him. Or slipped out to Filch’s. Either would be terrible.
Diggory didn’t look at Harry this time when he came in to take his seat. “Thank you. Mrs Weasley, do you have any witnesses for the defence?”
The first meeting of Committee for Muggle Relations took place a mere two days later. Harry had tried to put his encounter with Lucius from his mind, along with that plaintive warning from Draco, but had found it exceedingly difficult.
At last they were making their goodbyes and returning through the Floo to Grimmauld Place. Standing back in the parlour, Harry felt as though he could breathe again for the first time that night.
Harry had not had reason to debate anything more serious than a visit or the hiring of a servant since leaving school and the twists and turns of this debate were taxing him. He was learning more from observing the parties involved; Lady Longbottom had long given up any pretence and was frank about her distaste for some of the others. Lord Prewett was not a skilled speaker, but he was sharp and often asked questions that cut to the heart of the matter. Blishwick had an air of begging for favour. The other members of the committee he had not heard enough from to make judgements. Lord Malfoy, however…
"I am attempting to plan for the future while I recover my strength!" Ginny snapped. "I am sorry it is so boring for you."
“Fuck’s sake, Blaise,” Draco snapped. “I was so close! He was hungry for it like you wouldn’t believe and now he’s decided that his wife is more important!”
“Potter. I will forgive your state of battle-readiness if you forgive the early hour and the unannounced arrival,” he said as he breezed past Harry and into the rooms.
Harry took this in for a moment. “I do not like that you tried to deceive me. But I shall think on what you said.”
gone at last?” were Draco’s first words when Harry stepped back through into the bedroom.
Harry felt as if he had been struck dumb, the curious horror of the evening overwhelming. Malfoy turned to him, flicked his eyes up and down Harry's body. "What's wrong with you?"
Some emotion flashed in Malfoy's eyes too quickly for Harry to identify it. For a moment it seemed as though Malfoy would say something else but Harry was not stupid enough to wait for the madness to overcome him again; he pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way and yanked open the door, storming out and almost straight into Ron and Hermione.
," Draco spat.
Sirius nodded. He looked so tired, Harry registered. Perhaps this had been weighing on him every bit as heavily as it had been on Harry himself.
“I thought I’d join you for breakfast,” Ginny said brightly. “It has been too long and I have missed you.”
“No.” Goyle reached out a meaty paw which clutched a piece of paper. Harry took it mutely. It was a letter, in Draco's hand.
Draco took a chance on the latter. He could hardly turn up uninvited at the Weasley family home after all, but if Charlie was taking some of the kids to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes then Draco would have every reason to be wandering along Diagon Alley and just ‘happen’ to ‘bump into’ him.
Fawley and Smith were standing to one side, waiting for them to finish. Harry almost wished they would tell him to stop, pull him away, so he wouldn’t have to decide for himself when the last time he would hug his friend for two years was over. But they didn’t, and eventually he had to let go.
Sirius shrugged. "No doubt another invitation to something. Which reminds me, Remus should be able to make it to town next week. He'll be staying with Ted and Andromeda rather than here." Sirius' voice sounded a little odd when he said that; Harry knew that the premature death of Nymphadora, Sirius' cousin and Remus' wife, still preyed heavily on both their minds. It would be good for Remus to spend a little time with his in-laws, Harry thought, though it may be painful.
There was his answer, then.
Sirius returned to town on the Wednesday as he had indicated, by which time Draco was safely ensconced at the hotel suite and the dining table had been the subject of more than one rather intense
And it was Ginny. The woman he had pledged his life to
Harry was shaking so badly he could barely walk from the room. He did not dare Apparate, certain he would splinch himself, perhaps beyond saving, and he had not the presence of mind to find a Floo gate. Instead he ran blindly out into the streets of Hogsmeade as though a hundred Dark Lords and Death Eaters chased him and kept running even as others on the streets stared, some even calling out to him. He had no thought in his mind at all except to outrun the terrible thing inside him even though he knew it to be utterly futile.
Harry briefly fantasised about setting it all on fire.
It was utterly over the top, bordering on the vulgar – which seemed in tune with Draco's choice of companions and amusements if not his dress. Moreover, it was by Paddington Station, well away from Charing Cross Road and the entrance to Diagon Alley, or the Ministry at Whitehall. It was in all respects perfect.
Harry hated it but he could see the sense. He had missed a full day already but went back the next to attend meetings and committees. Lucius Malfoy behaved as though precisely nothing had changed, as he always had and most likely always would.
But it was moments like these when Draco fully appreciated the genius of Pansy Parkinson. “Potter?” she said and gave a burst of genuine laughter. “Potter as fashion icon? Gabrielle, darling, I think all that alcohol has pickled your brain.”
"Prudence is always the best course," said Molly, a long-time proponent of this particular virtue.
"I quite agree," Harry said. His fingers itched for something to do; he longed to tug at Draco's clothes, to pull at his hair. He forced his fingers to stay clenched around the gloves in his hand. "Should I send an owl to let you know the particulars?"
Harry closed his eyes, and forgot himself a while.
"I'm fine, Dobby," Harry said as he walked into the foyer. "If you can just let Sirius know I am here?"
Ginny has every right in the world to hate me, he thought. But still she came.
"Shall we indulge?" Draco chirped.
Narcissa frowned. "This topic is most indelicate, Lucius dear."
Harry knew the answer, of course. "I wanted a family."
Then Ginny saw him and turned, meeting his gaze with a real effort at a smile.
“Wonderful. How was your morning?”
"You are mine," Draco echoed, his smile pure victory.
Harry gave an answering smile, though he knew that would never be possible. "This way it is as though we have our own world," he said, running his knuckles along Draco's cheekbone.
"Does it seem like something I would want?" Harry said, vaguely incredulous.
~o0o~
"Then what did you mean when you said I was yours?"
A soft “Harry?” startled him.
“Mr Potter? We’d like to speak with you down at the Ministry,” Dawlish said.
The Atrium was full of reporters and photographers. Questions were shouted at him as flashes went off again and again; it was all too much. Harry did his best to hold his head high but every instinct was telling him to shrink down. Then they were through the worst of it, to the area cordoned off which only condemned men walked through.
"Again?" The word slipped out before Harry could quite catch it.
“No, of course,” Draco said, waving his hand as though dismissing the unimportant. “You know her much better than I do, of course. It’s just that, well, women can be a little strange about their ex-boyfriends, you know?”
Harry’s jaw clenched.
“Yes, it was. Today hasn’t started well either,” Draco said, voice hardening again.
,” said Harry and at once Kirke legs locked together. He fumbled for his own wand but Harry merely flicked his once more. “
It was Draco.
Harry rubbed his face. "I do not know, Hermione. I know our separation is making her unhappy but I cannot guarantee that things would improve between the two of us were I to return to her. She is no longer the girl I married."
“But Harry—”
"You think I speak out of turn, Lady Potter?" Lucius said though his eyes didn't move from Harry's face. "I am sorry to say my son is well on the way to becoming outright notorious."
Ron handed Harry a glass and filled it from the ladle; he then waited until Harry was raising it to his lips to speak.
“Say it!” Harry snapped.
One night after everyone had gone to bed, Sirius found Harry sitting against the door to Ginny's room, tired and drawn.
"I am healthy," she said. "You need not fear."
Sirius, bless him, merely showed Harry to the room he usually stayed in and told him he could reside there as long as he wanted.
"I didn't like it," Harry said at once.
Another cheer, another call for order from Diggory. Harry sank down in his chair. It was going to be a long trial.
“Coming?” said Draco.
It took a while before Potter could rouse himself enough to withdraw from Draco, a while longer before Draco wanted him to. By then it was well past going home time for the Aurors and Draco wondered idly how many of them had an idea of what had gone on behind their boss’s door.
"Why are you bothering Harry?" Ron demanded. Harry turned slightly, his eyes finding Malfoy's in alarm.
"What do you wish?" Draco asked, his expression of triumphant joy never changing. "I am in quite the good mood just at the moment and so I may grant it, if it is in my power."
Harry stumbled as he entered the visiting room of the prison. As the door closed behind him, he looked into the one face he had been so desperate to see.
” Don’t trust a gift from an enemy.
Though Harry stayed by Ginny's side through the day, he still slept apart from her. He had thought that perhaps he had put all his strange conflicted desires from his mind until he went to sleep one night with the spectre of Malfoy's mouth hovering at the edge of his consciousness. When Harry woke the next morning, his sheets were wet as they had not been since his teenage years. He closed his eyes against the bitter sting of tears and wished again for this terrible need to just leave him in peace.
Sirius grimaced as he stepped into the dark corridor. "Lucius Malfoy has been trying to obtain a seat. So far he has been blocked but he is a powerful man, buying considerable influence. As long as we have Eldritch Diggory as Minister for Magic, his influence can only extend so far. Good man, Diggory."
Harry smashed their mouth together so violently he almost expected to taste blood. Draco gasped and swiped his tongue along Harry’s. His body was all but shaking.
“Yes. And I’ve got some bills now, you know. Had to get a potion to heal those bruises after you sent me flying. Another for the bump on the head.” He looked at Harry meaningfully, and Harry cursed inwardly.
“Oh,” Draco said. “And you are upset?”
“So you went to live at what Filch has described as a boarding house?”
When Harry came back to himself, it was to find himself half on top of Draco, half slumped against the edge of the dining table, which was now covered with Draco's semen. His breath still filled his ears, harsh; his heart still pounded.
"Until the presentation, anyway," Sirius said, nursing his brandy.
Harry did not know what to say.
following the next witness.”
gossip,” Charlie said dryly.
"I wish I didn't have to go," Harry told Ginny during one of her rare periods of waking.
Harry looked at him in disbelief. "Is it too late…"
"Lily Molly?" Ginny wrinkled her nose. "How droll that sounds." Harry let out a huff of surprised laughter: Ginny used to make him laugh all the time but it had been so long, he had all but forgotten.
"I shall be in the public gallery," he said, and moved to the door Sirius indicated.
“Draught of Peace,” Sirius said when Harry made no move to take it. “You will do your family no good if you wear yourself out fretting.”
With his hand covered in his own come, Draco brought it to Harry's face, painting a line along his cheekbone. "You understand now?"
"Quite." Harry remembered him now. He had been thin and sarcastic and had taunted other students; Harry had not developed friendships with such people.
"Hallo," he'd practically purred, and Harry had gone to kneel by his side, kissing him thoroughly. Draco had arched up against him, sliding a hand into Harry's hair.
“Am not,” Draco said at once, sitting up on his elbows to take in the details of Harry’s body again.
Draco did not come back. Harry dined in the hotel, eating quickly, and returned to a room still empty. He took a long bath thinking of the day before when he and Draco had shared it.
Harry's arms tightened and he took a long, shuddering breath. "What now?"
"Perhaps," she said softly.
"Forgive me, I have several business matters to attend to this day. A pleasure to see you again, Lord Draco," Harry said tipping his hat, turning to the lady to repeat the gesture silently. He was aware that he was essentially running away. He didn't know how he dared do otherwise.
Remus led him to the Leaky Cauldron and paid for a private booth; Harry winced slightly at the flash of gold, but supposed Sirius must have given it to him. He winced again at the thought of the task of speaking to him being delegated to Remus, imagining he and Sirius discussing it.
That could not possibly be good.
"Ah," Harry shifted uncomfortably. "Well, a man who walks to the gallows under his own power is much more to be respected than a man who is forced there, is it not so?"
Harry nodded. “I’m going to need an advocate.”
"Sirius devoted his life to other things," Harry said, compelled to defend his godfather.
“I doubt it. That was just leverage. It is me he wants to destroy.”
The thing which had disturbed Harry for so long came to his mind now. "Do you not worry that it is unnatural?"
"Not long," she said, returning to her usual brisk manner. "I will begin immediately if you would be good enough to watch Rose?"
“I rent rooms in London to young wizards looking for work.”
Harry chewed his quill as he had in school. There was so much to say, it was hard to know where to begin.
Lord Malfoy stood only a moment wondering what had happened before he turned to Harry, furious, and reached for his own wand.
"It is a room for fantasies," Harry said.
The next shop but one was Quality Quidditch Supplies and Harry gratefully stepped inside. He had not played much in recent years, but the place always brought back some of Harry's more pleasant childhood memories and it was a pleasure to sink in once again to the smell of leather, the feeling of hard wood, the tense excitement of a game reaching its climax.  It was a rare luxury to have time here alone, and Harry took his time browsing the newest model brooms and leafing through photographs of the latest team line-ups.
“What stuff?” Draco tried. He hadn’t… He couldn’t have…
"Not as much, I think, with you as with some others," Ron said.
"I am doing nothing, Father," Draco was insisting mutinously.
“It is proof positive of Mr Potter’s nature, and I ask that the court see it. I had hoped to avoid this as it will hurt someone dear to me, but I see now that without it, no action can be taken.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep, steadying breath. It was easy to forget that Draco’s experiences and the expectations placed on him were radically different from those Harry faced.
"I am quite well, mother," Ginny insisted, and though Harry knew it was as much bravado as truth he also knew Ginny well enough to understand that it was important to her to be seen again as strong.
"I'm dead."
in the way most people would regard their parents. It was in here that Sirius had explained all manner of things to Harry as his father would have. The talk on the rights of a husband had been particularly memorable.
Malfoy's petulance caused Harry's ire to rise. "She is in a delicate condition and there have been some complications. The Healer is worried about her."
He did not speak until he had taken another two full glasses of the spirit. Finally, he began in a more quiet tone, "Be that as it may, Remus and I have sense enough not to flaunt who we are in front of the peerage!"
Harry reached out to cup Draco’s cheek, his fingers caressing the tips of his white-blond hair. “It’s a fantasy, Draco. You know it. Lucius would come for you.”
Lord Malfoy responded in a way Harry would not have expected; he raised the cane he always carried and swept in front of his son. In another motion, he had cracked it full force into Draco's body, winding him.
Hermione stood, confused. “Yes sir, I submitted the witness list before trial commenced as you requested.”
Yes! Draco crowed inwardly. “Is it too little time?” he said sounding worried.
~o0O0o~
Ginny's words were far from prophetic. Ron had apologetically declined their invitation, citing an unusually high caseload and so it had been Molly alone who had come.
“That’s a relief,” Potter said.
looking forward to seeing us there."
“It is, rather,” Draco agreed with a languid shrug. “But you know, business.”
“Sorry,” Charlie said to Draco. “I have to…”
Draco was still talking. "We shall both need new robes, of course."
"Why would you?" Draco said, and then he reached for Harry and all conversation ceased a while.
"You certainly never saw
"And how am I supposed to react to this tender confession?" Malfoy said, though it sounded as though the words were being torn out of him. He still wouldn't turn to face Harry, still wouldn't let Harry see his face. "Am I supposed to melt into your arms? Am I supposed to mutter 'oh Harry' like some virtuous maiden?"
"Sometimes," Draco replied, "but not now."
“You’ll remember this time,” Potter said, and with that, he drove deep into Draco’s body.
"Yes, well now you know how I felt the first time we arranged this," Draco said with a hint of bite in his tone. He tugged at his gloves, methodically pulling each finger loose in turn before pulling the glove free of his hand. "Aren't you lucky I'm letting you make it up to me," he said as he repeated the motion with the other glove, and dropped both on the floor.
When they were finally called back through, Harry felt as though his every nerve had been shredded. Hermione looked no better.
"Ah?" Lady Malfoy scanned Harry from the tips of his dragon-hide boots to the top of his stubbornly messy hair. "Well, such a meeting as this may allow for conversation, Mr Potter, despite the lack of introduction. Tell me, you are here with your lady wife?"
Thus reassured, Harry kissed him frantically. “You were beautiful,” he said between kisses. “Magnificent.”
Victoire took it and giggled when it started to hiss. Once the children were safely distracted, Draco turned his attention back to Charlie. “I have a confession,” Draco said. “I came looking for you.”
Harry sat for what felt like hours in that sterile cell. There were bars and wards everywhere, and everything was painted grey. Harry tried not to think of Sirius in Azkaban or his experiences with Dementors in the past. He instead thought of a shining silver stag and wondered what memory could bring such a creature to him now.
Harry looked into Sirius' eyes.  He had never seen it before, the kindness in him that was so like Remus – that perhaps he had even learned from Remus over their time together.  They had been separated for years and never ceased to love one another.  Harry feared that if he left Draco alone for more than a month the man would disappear into the arms of a rent boy and never emerge.
Harry frowned. "How then can discoveries be made?"
Harry felt himself go slack-jawed. "I gave up so much to be here with you."
So Harry took them to the back room where Sirius had installed a Pensieve. Harry had never had cause to use it, but it was not secured – being in the house was surely security enough to Sirius’s mind – so it was the work of moments for Blaise to pull a silvery thread from his head and place it into the water for Harry to see.
"Yes, of course," Draco said. "It helps. But it doesn't… I'm so angry. Angry and anxious. There's this terrible fury within me."
"Draco," he said at last, "do you always agree with your father?"
Sirius frowned. "I do not know if it is something which can come from reason, Harry. Either one sees others as people with value, or one does not. In this regard I fear you are far better than I. I disregarded the feelings of my servants in my younger years and it took you to show me that I should treat house-elves just the same as I should treat a wizard or a goblin or a Muggle." Sirius' lip curled. "They can damage or elevate us just as well as our friends or families.
"I wonder indeed," Lucius said, eyes boring into Harry's and then all at once he was benign and amused again. "My apologies, my dear, you are perfectly right. Let us not dwell on such things. Lord Potter, I will see you at the Wizengamot." And with a small bow that was in truth the merest nod, Lord Malfoy took his wife's hand and led her to a seat. Mercifully it was on the other side of the box.
"Thank you," Draco said, entering the room. Harry followed and the door slid closed behind them.
Harry had grown inured to Death Eater venom during the war; he did not react to it now. "It was not my intention to eavesdrop. And if a gentleman is expected to discipline himself, I do wonder that Lord Malfoy chooses rather to discipline his grown son in public. Good evening, Mr Crabbe."
Regardless, "Draco, I cannot attend such a party, you must see that."
Her eyes narrowed, as the clockwork in her brain considered. “I imagine he is going somewhere with this, to be certain. But I cannot see how he intends to accuse you and leave Draco out of it.”
"Will you come to the Manor for tea that day?"
"I'll get the potion," Draco said at once.
some part of him wanted to know and Harry felt his mouth twist into an unhappy shape. The chiming of the clock brought him back to the present and gratefully he reached for the Floo powder.
Hermione opened the door herself – she had Views on house-elves, even if she and Ron could have afforded servants. She was startled by his appearance but said only, "Harry! What a surprise, do come in. Rosie's sleeping at last; I could do with some adult conversation."
“Then I shall order an additional pot and cup. Would you care for anything else?”
This, Harry had dreaded, more so even than seeing Ginny again. He knew he should not feel such a way about his wife but he felt certain that he could survive the loss of her much more easily than the loss of Ron or Hermione.
Sirius made a face. "We're not all made for family life. Sit down, sit down."
tell me that any of what happened with you should mean more to me than that."
"I had perhaps desired men before," Harry acknowledged. "I do not believe I was aware of it at the time – it is only in retrospect that it seems clear to me."
Harry watched Draco curl his hands around the table's edge just before he gave in to the instinct overwhelming him and snapped his hips, pulling back and bucking forward with barely a thought. Draco's whine urged him to do it again, and again, to fuck him furiously as Draco clutched and cursed and grunted. Harry watched all the muscles of Draco's back move under his skin. He wanted to reach forward, sink his teeth into that shoulder blade, but he was too far gone to change the angle, to risk any movement more than the inward-outward thrust of his cock into Draco's greedy hole.
"Whatever did you do with your days before?" Harry asked one afternoon when they had yet to rise from bed.
“Steady on, Potter,” muttered Ernie Macmillan, one of Harry’s few supporters on the committee. “One objection at a time.”
"Lady Potter, it is so nice to have an evening out, is it not?" Narcissa Malfoy was saying. She was always more outwardly polite than her husband but there tended to be a sting. "When the children are small I know some mothers find it hard to leave them at home, unfashionable though it may be to admit it."
The day of the ceremony had dawned warm and bright. Harry dressed with particular care in the special robes he'd had made. The ceremony would be held on the grounds of Hogwarts, by the white tomb which marked the final resting place of Albus Dumbledore. There would be speeches and silence in equal measure. It was also, Harry thought with a twist of his mouth, one of the social events of the season. There were adults now old enough that they had started school after the horror of the war was over and while the occasion was always solemn – many had still lost family, after all – they were memorialising that which they had not lived through. They could not imagine the horror of the school cracked open and broken, the bodies of their classmates crumpled on the ground.
The two devoured the breakfast supplied by the hotel, eggs and toast and bacon all consumed.
"Harry," she said and her voice was perfectly even. "Harry, it may be a shame and a scandal but if you will not live with me then perhaps we should think of a divorce."
The thing speaks for itself.
Draco's flat tone brought a frown to Harry's face. "Did your father want you to..."
Harry took the slight; he deserved it.  And yet, "Remus loved <i>you</i>."
Harry had never been good at dressing up what he wanted to say, not really. He had to hope that direct would be good enough.
He was folding the last of his robes when the door opened – no knock. He called his wand to his hand instinctively and whirled to face the intruder.
Irrelevant. “Continue. What was the nature of the fight?”
~o0O0o~
Harry slid his thumb and forefinger beneath the bridge of his spectacles and rubbed his face where they pinched him. "Kreacher, please do not mutter like that. You know it upsets us."
As the clock struck eleven and the appointed time arrived, Sirius paused by the fireplace. "Harry, are you prepared for this? Truly? For if you wish it we could simply remain here. There is not much in the way of a roast dinner available, to be certain, but I am sure Dobby would be delighted to whip something up for you."
"I love you," he told her over and over again, fiercely trying to imprint it on her so that she would be certain of him in the way he had always been certain of her. "I love you."
“Did anyone else see the letter at the house?”
"Ginny," he said at once, forcing himself to be gentle as he took her hand. "We are not being kind to each other. You know we are not. Let us give one another room to breathe. You are right – you have changed and I have changed and I feel we must each of us confront the changes within. Then, perhaps, we will be better able to take pleasure in each other's company."
"I know," Harry said. "I know, but… it is still too soon, I think."
Hermione countered with questions about the number of beds and places to sleep in the suite, the possibility of a friend drinking too much to get home, and whether the girl had ever seen “improprieties” with her own eyes; she had not.
The summary defiling of his childhood haven had left Harry with a bad taste in his mouth. He had planned to visit Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour before returning home but now desired only the quiet and solitude of Sirius's study.
"Do you?" Malfoy repeated, eyes glittering, his body's heat mere inches from Harry.
" Draco cried, the full force of his will and his love and his pain crackling through the word.
"Lord Draco," Harry responded quietly. "I will be departing for town on the morrow. I wonder if I might ask you to call upon me while I am there, as we discussed?"
Harry made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron. There was a queue of people waiting at the fireplace, chatting and showing off their purchases. Harry, impatient, walked around them and beyond, out into Charing Cross Road. He shook himself slightly and turned to walk to Covent Garden when he thought he saw a flash of gold from the corner of his eye.
“How do you know—”
. "I cannot know. But I believe I would pay any price to have you."
He handed her a velvet box. “Happy birthday, my dear,” he said as he handed it over.
Too many revelations! Too much gossip! Draco didn’t know how to take it all in! “Oliver…?”
Hermione nodded. "Bring them tomorrow," she began, but the end of her sentence was cut off by the fireplace roaring.
Unable to speak, Harry closed his eyes and waited for whatever came next to begin.
"What are you doing?" Harry cut him off.
"Indeed," said Harry. He shifted uncomfortably; there was no way to avoid it. "Have Ginny and the children arrived?"
Draco met his gaze with a whine. Harry wanted to say something about how good Draco looked when Harry had him held down, but instead found himself kissing Draco again, shifting forward until he went from kneeling over Draco to lying on top of him. Harry still had on his trousers and he knew he would have to remove them or ruin them with an unexplainable stain, but for now he instead slid a leg between Draco's parted thighs and slid against him, pulling more desperate groans from Draco's mouth.
Ginny nodded. "You wish for an occupation," she said, reiterating something that had been discussed repeatedly. Harry might pick Ron's brains for more tales of his work with the but he himself had a great deal to do in the coming seasons.
"Potions, perhaps?" Harry said, trying to elicit a smile.
A long shaky breath helped steady Harry. “You are right, of course.”
"I mean it," she said, seeing his face. "If you mean to turn away from me and the children better you do it completely. If you were taking a holiday from us you would keep in better touch. I know not what you have been doing and, while my thoughts have run quite wild, I do not allow myself the luxury of dwelling overlong on speculation. I merely ask that you do me the courtesy of being honest about your intentions."
Draco rolled his eyes. "He tells me not to be idle but everything which might occupy my mind is deemed unworthy of a Malfoy. I am good with potions, and I have done some research into blending certain exotic ingredients more effectively, but it came to nothing in the end. And so, having failed, I was not permitted to continue."
"Mr Potter," a voice said, interrupting his thoughts. He turned to face Malfoy's dark-skinned friend from the opera. His breath stuttered.
"I did," Harry replied, fascinated by the sensitive spots on Draco's neck which made him shiver.
A veritable army of house elves had answered the doors, their feet pitter-patting on the black Italian marble. They took their cloaks and showed the two men to the drawing room.
"I don't need to hear what you thought," Harry snapped. He grabbed a team shot of the Harpies, and did the same for Puddlemere United. "Just these, thank you."
Harry had rarely been afraid during the war. He was afraid now.
He tore his cravat away from his throat. Draco had in his impatience undone the waistcoat completely and tugged now at Harry's shirt. Harry discarded both items behind him and was rewarded at once with Draco's hands on his skin. He groaned as those hands roamed over his body, watching Draco's greedy expression and wondering how like it his own expression might be.
Draco arrived promptly, a rare occurrence indeed. He smirked at Kreacher and moved to kiss Harry the moment he saw him, uncaring of the servant's eyes.
"It enables you in thinking some people below others because of an accident of birth."
Harry sighed inwardly, disappointed that Sirius' response did not offer him any solution. But what had he expected? Sirius fought the symptoms, not the disease.
"It has been but five months, Padfoot," Remus replied, but the reluctant tugging of a smile at his mouth told of his pleasure at hearing he was missed.
"It must be hard," he said, taking a precise bite of the pigeon pie then reaching for his wine. "To divide your time so. But of course the thrust of politics waits for no man." And then the bastard
Harry took a moment to compose himself, forcing himself to inhale slowly, trying to still his blood.
"Forgive me, Lady Malfoy," Harry stuttered. "I am acquainted with your husband and son, but I…"
All at once, Harry could no longer bear it. He stood without consciously deciding to do so, brushing Bertram away.
"Oh, Potter," he gasped, crumpling further into Harry's body, his fingers running through the mess he had made. "There, I have marked you and now you are mine."
Draco hasn't slept in days. He hasn't eaten, hasn't washed, hasn't done anything but sip water when he remembers and relieve himself when his body insists. He must smell, he must but he can't tell anymore. The vaults below the manor have always smelled slightly, damp and sweat and human suffering; now the air is stale with decay.
(See the end of the chapter for
"All right, mate?" Ron asked, reaching out to clasp Harry's hand in his own.
Harry had pulled Draco back from death once. He was the master of death even then, long before he'd even heard of the Deathly Hallows. He sliced Draco open from throat to groin and watched him bleed for a while into the water on the bathroom floor. Then he'd sealed him back up and made it like it had never happened, except of course for the scar which Draco would always bear.
The pressure of his hand around his member made Harry gasp and his hips jerked to thrust into his hand before he could stop it. It felt so good, too good, to lie back and touch himself, thinking of that mouth, that luminous skin. At first Harry tried to keep images of Ginny at the forefront of his mind as though he could ameliorate this sin, but hazel eyes kept turning grey, red hair to blond. Harry tightened his hand around the head of his cock and imagined Malfoy's fingers on him the way they had been on the boy in the alley. He came immediately, all over his hand, with a shock of disgust hard on the heels of the pleasure.
"I am sorry," said Harry, willing Draco to believe him.
Draco shrugged out of his smoking jacket and let his shirt slip off his shoulder. “You could start by coming here.” Harry turned to look at him more fully only to see Draco shrugging out of his shirt and collapsing languidly to the bed.
“I’m sure,” Hermione said, unmoved.
“You are jealous of her and jealous of my children despite the fact that I largely ignore all four of them for your sake,” Harry snapped. “I have changed and changed and changed all to make you happy but it is never enough. I must also change my politics to suit your father’s, I must threaten renters who try to extort me—”
“Can you tell us in what way?”
Harry could still see him, the rich green of his waistcoat lending a depth to his slate-grey eyes, their colouring startling even at distance. This was insane, he
~o0o~
Lord Malfoy's mouth curled into the same cruel smile which on Draco's face made Harry's neck flush. On his father it rather made Harry's hands turn clammy.
Harry had seen glorious houses before, but Malfoy Manor was something quite apart from his experience. The entrance way was all marble, but the hall they walked through was sumptuously decorated with portraits of Malfoys from as far back as the time of William the Conqueror glaring down on them.
“Forgive me if I do not weep for the Purebloods.”
He saw now how much sense this new knowledge made of his feelings of isolation and detachment, why his marriage had not truly fulfilled him, why certain of his reactions had mystified him. He understood now that Draco had not made him a sodomite. It had been in him all along. He was an invert, a nonce, and he couldn't even hate himself for it because admitting it was like breathing after being held underwater for agonising hours. His lungs were filled with air at last and he loved Draco and he loved Ginny: somehow this impossible life seemed to be working and he would see Draco tomorrow.
"You loved her," Hermione said, perhaps trying to remind him. "But it is not just Ginny you have cut off, you know. You have not made time for Ron and I, nor have you visited Molly and Arthur here."
“And I you,” Harry told her, taking her hand in his.
"Sirius," Ginny returned, smiling. She was obviously tired; even with Harry's assistance she stumbled a little as she stepped down from the carriage.
Then Draco said the cruellest thing he possibly could have: "I do love you, Harry. But I just… I can't… I have to. Please?”
Harry had to take a moment to ready himself, his breaths growing longer in an attempt to calm himself until he finally said, “It is true.”
“Take this to Draco Malfoy,” he said quietly. “Wait for an answer.” Marble always looked serious by virtue of being a long-eared owl but he looked exceptionally so now as he hooted softly and spread his wings.
Harry missed Draco but had no idea what to say to him. His head was so full of contradictions that he could barely think, and the Draught of Peace had done nothing to soothe his anxiety. Perhaps he had taken it so often before that he was now immune. Or perhaps this was simply the worst it had ever been.
At one particularly brutal thrust, Draco's arm shot forward, knocking over a candlestick on the table. Mercifully the candle went out; Harry doubted he could have stopped even if the whole world burned about them. Draco was keening now, so close, just from this – Harry had not touched his cock at all since turning him over. Harry wondered if he was hurting Draco. He wondered if Draco had been fucked by other men since Harry had been gone, and the thought set his teeth on edge.
"Thank you, no," Draco cut him off, distaste writ large on his face. "I have no desire to hear about your marriage bed."
"I tell you this, Harry, for you must know that the risks you take are not worth the price," Sirius said gently.  "I of all people understand the pain of this kind of love, but to flaunt it is to court disaster."
"Graphorns," Sirius said bitterly. "Bagman wanted the hide for a coat and thought he could make some money selling other parts of the beast off for potion supplies."
“I would like to be able to live with Remus,” Sirius said. “Teddy is grown up now. The villa is big enough for all of us. It sits by the lakeside, with a view across the clearest water you’ve ever seen. On a clear day you can see all the way to the Dolomites on the northern shore. It is temperate and charming. It would be a nice place for the children, Harry.”
Harry had been real once, complete in all his perfection and imperfection. Too soon he was borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.
"What have you known of responsibilities wearing the soul out?" Harry heard himself retorting. "You never married, you never had children – why not? Was it perhaps you who was afraid?"
The public gallery was full. Most were familiar faces who smiled at Harry, or did their best approximation. Neville Longbottom had come from Hogwarts, Dean Thomas was there with Seamus Finnegan, Luna Scamander gave him a little wave. He was touched and smiled. He already knew that Ron could not be there because it would be seen as a conflict of interest. He knew deep in his bones that Ginny would not be there either, but he’d still hoped. The only representatives of the Weasleys were Bill and Fleur; the French had quite different attitudes to cases like his than the English and perhaps that had been enough reason to make a show of support. He assumed the others were either going about their business or, he hoped, taking care of Ginny and the children.
Harry had never been one for dwelling on decisions once made. At heart he was a man of action.
The words hit him like a body blow. He was going there after all, to be drained of all the joy in his life, to become a husk of who he had been. The cries from the gallery grew louder until Diggory was shouting to make himself heard.
He couldn’t bear it. Silently, Harry crept from the bedroom into his dressing room, leaving Ginny curled on her side facing away from his side of the bed.
Footsteps moved away and towards the marquee. Harry composed himself for a moment, then emerged.
Harry woke a little too early the next morning, in his old room, with a monstrous headache brewing. Some kind soul – most likely Dobby – had placed some restorative potions by his bedside and Harry gratefully drank them at once.
“Ye-es,” was all she said and Harry kicked himself for being naïve yet again.
"Only you," Harry repeated, catching Draco's jaw and turning Draco's face towards him. "You know there has been only you."
" Draco tapped it with his wand again and the voice stopped.
He shifted on the hard floor.
"No," Draco said. "But… It might be nice to make him proud for a change."
Hermione didn’t even look at him. “Minister, my understanding was that it is the accused’s right to choose their advocate. Is it not so?”
o0O0o
In his fantasies, he had touched Draco from ankle to neck, from the hair beneath his arms to the soft flesh of his earlobe. But he could not, now; it would have to wait. There was so much more of urgency than finesse in him now.
“Do shut up, Pans,” Draco said, thinking quickly. It was nine in the morning, and a Thursday. Potter would definitely be in his office until around five.  Assuming that none of the other three would be well enough informed to go down there during working hours, he should have enough time to turn each of them in a different direction and claim Potter for his own before any of them realised what had happened.
“Do you not think that if I went back to Godric’s Hollow…”
Harry always knew how he was expected to react to an introduction by the tone in which Sirius delivered it. On this occasion the tone and expression clearly spoke of a man too influential to be given the cut direct, but nonetheless not someone whose acquaintance could be considered desirable.
"It is not fair," Harry acknowledged.
A rushing sound filled Harry’s ears. Kirke got up and ran, having landed his parting shot which had indeed struck true.
Harry smiled vaguely and crossed the room to kiss her goodnight, on the forehead as had become a custom.
“Am I not?” His eyes gleamed.
~o0o~
Harry spent most of his time on long walks through the countryside. There was a thriving wizarding social scene to be found but Ginny eschewed it at Molly's insistence and Harry felt uncomfortable without her. It was London all over again, Ginny essentially indisposed and Harry left whiling away the time.
Pansy’s eyes narrowed even as Gabrielle crowed, “I knew it! Why?”
No. He slammed down the thought at once. Teddy was his godson, the son of a man he respected beyond words and Harry would never even consider betraying his trust in such a way.
"What?" Draco stammered. Damn, Boot was sharp.
"All your ancestors?" Harry asked.
Harry reached into his pocket and blindly passed the man a handful of galleons. “A room, those five and for the love of Merlin, some gin.”
"A fine idea, and one which you can see I share. You keep yourself occupied in the mornings? That is well," Lady Malfoy said, without waiting for a response. "If a gentleman neither shoots nor writes letters nor does anything to see to his own occupation then he is nothing but an intolerable nuisance to the ladies of his household."
Draco looked at him with a sardonic curl to his mouth. "Yes, and that is of course why Father would not approve of our relationship."
Ginny brushed the back of Harry's hand with her fingers. "I am glad it is you, sweetheart," she said.
~o0o~
He was almost ashamed of having sent the letter at all. Sirius had a good plan and if Harry were sensible, he would write to Ginny, convince her the break would be good for all of them and thank his lucky stars.
"Harry has never lived as a bachelor," Remus pointed out quietly. "He married almost immediately after finishing school."
Harry thought of how many times over the last year he had told himself that same thing, how many others had said it, how it had seemed so impossible for so long.
"We never have," Harry pointed out softly.
Draco snorted. "It seemed to have quite the effect on you at the time."
"You do realise that it is rather the upper half of your face which people recognise?" he drawled. "No matter, Spelling's is very discreet." As if to prove his point at once, Draco knocked on an unmarked door. A panel slid back and a pair of dark eyes was visible for a moment.
"Oh, no, the better for drink!" Nott chimed in.
Harry did not need to see more, although Blaise had not seen fit to end the memory there. With a roar, Harry pulled himself away as Draco opened Blaise’s trousers.
” he said sharply and the ropes released their hold at once, despite his wand being on the other side of the room. Draco made a strangled noise and flicked his wand again; a jet of red light shot from his wand and Harry only just managed to dodge it. He flung out his hand to summon his wand and in a moment he and Draco were facing one another like duelling partners, both breathing hard, uncertain of what might come next.
Malfoy looked well this evening, dressed in black robes, white shirt and an emerald green waistcoat. The very sight of him made Harry's entire body run hot.
"She nearly died," Harry snarled, squaring up to Malfoy now. Their bodies were so close but for the first time Harry wanted to punch him more than he wanted to caress him. "She nearly died when I was with you. Don't you
Harry looked between the three of them. Something was happening here that he did not understand. "We are responsible for all the consequences of actions we make," he said finally.
"It's settled then," Sirius said, his tone brooking no argument, and in short order he and Harry were sitting down to tea. Remus was a morning person, so Harry was not surprised that he at least was fully dressed.
“Excellent idea, Minister,” Harry managed. “I think I’ll do just that.”
and he thought for a mad moment about fighting them all and disappearing.
"What shall we name her?" he asked Ginny softly.
“If I may, Minister,” Lucius interjected, rising from his chair again. “Is Mrs Weasley an authority on law?”
Harry found the letter on the desk and read it quickly: Sirius apologised but had been dragged away to go hunting by a head of department.
The moment Draco’s cock stopped pulsing, Harry put his hand, still covered in spend, over Draco’s throat. “I will give you what you need. Only me.”
"Hm?"
“I don’t know,” Harry admitted. He took his glasses off and rubbed his face. “I won’t become his puppet.”
"Lord Malfoy has done much to try and discredit my father," Ginny said, frowning. This was news to Harry – he knew that Arthur had faced some opposition at the Ministry but he had not known until this moment that Lord Malfoy was behind it.
"Happy Birthday," Lucius said as an afterthought.
"When you're with me," said Draco, tone still sharp. "And when I know you're coming back soon. Not when you're about to leave, or when you've been gone for weeks with barely a word."
"The Wizengamot will return to session after the Season is over," Sirius had told him. "I must take my seat - perhaps you should come and observe? And of course there is the matter of the property in Hogsmeade and how it should be administered – I know it's tedious, Harry, but it must be done. Just learn about it once and then turn it over to a manager as I did!" Sirius had patted his shoulder and grimaced in an odd kind of resigned contentment, but Harry could not imagine living life as Sirius did, always rattling around in Grimmauld Place with only the occasional visit to a friend breaking the tedium of routine. No wonder Sirius was always desperate for a visit from himself or Remus.
Then Neville called, “We’ll get you out, Harry!”
“You don’t know him!”
Harry frowned. “I hardly think—”
~o0O0o~
So, I missed a couple of posting dates. My apologies. The ups and downs of lockdown hit me with a really big down. But I'm back and posting is almost complete! Hope you enjoy the penultimate chapter.
"Harry, thank Merlin," Sirius said, throwing off his hat for Dobby to catch. "Where on earth were you? I looked everywhere before I came."
"Yes," Harry said. "Yes, and I think your father knows it. He says things to me that he should not."
Remus did not seem convinced, but he let the matter drop as was his wont; Sirius began to chatter about all the diversions London might offer with the winter season beginning, and if he seemed relieved that Harry was not about to become a semi-permanent house guest, Harry did not wonder at it then.
“I know enough, Harry!" Sirius roared, slamming his glass onto the table so that Firewhisky slopped everywhere.
Hermione smiled. "Perhaps your new addition will be a daughter."
"Indeed not," Draco acknowledged, though he continued fidgeting. Harry reached out and caught his hands to soothe him, but touching Draco always seemed to lead to more touch, more intensity. Always more.
Harry followed him toward the lift. The Wizengamot rooms were all on the second floor of the Ministry and comprised some ten courtrooms, two assembly rooms and various and sundry antechambers.
"It isn't my intention," Harry said, startled.
Harry stilled. "You wish for me to attend?"
“I did not realise,” said Harry, “how far from myself I had grown until I came back to myself armed with new knowledge.”
"Oh, please," Lord Draco said with a bright smile that sent unease spiralling through Harry all over again, warring with the odd warmth his presence had elicited. "All my old school chums call me Malfoy." At that he reached out and shook Harry's hand.
"Harry?" Sirius had to prompt him.
"An excellent speech, Mr Potter," Lord Malfoy offered. "It is well to remind us all of the importance of the choices we make."
It was only half past ten when his patience was rewarded.
There were many rooms in the club, most filled with card players, another with men talking. Harry followed the soft sound of piano music to a room at the end of the corridor. A man was singing there, a German aria. Harry took a place by the door, opting to allow the music to fill his senses in lieu of trying to make conversation. The air in here was cleaner and Harry breathed it gratefully. His brandy was empty; another seamlessly took its place and Harry drank that too, his nerves steadying. He had thought earlier that he had caught sight of that other friend of Malfoy's, the stringy looking fellow, but he had not seen him since. He was relieved to think he might have been mistaken.
Sirius stood abruptly, forcing Harry to let go of him.  "After that it was quite simple.  Remus and Nymphadora took refuge in the country.  She miscarried."
Harry came right down Draco’s throat with a shout. Draco managed to pull back just as Harry’s legs gave out from under him with the force of his orgasm and he slid down the wall to the floor.
~o0O0o~
"It is my birthday in a few days."
“Muggle lives, Harry!” Draco cried. “How would that be relevant to you and me?”
"The robes are lovely," Harry said, because he was supposed to. The fabric was a dove grey, appropriately modest for a wife and mother though the neckline was still fashionably low. The sleeves were trimmed with
"Then you should join us for cards tomorrow night," Zabini said. His teeth caught the light as he smiled. There was something of amusement in his expression but Harry did not have enough time to dwell on it as on turning back to face Zabini, his eye lit on the window into the hotel's reading room.
She bit her lip. "It has been so long."
"I try…" Harry began, but Draco wasn't listening.
“Do I not?” Lucius seemed amused. “And yet, there are often reshufflings and changes in structure and I know precisely what to say to whom in order to ensure that at least half of that family, who were so kind to you from such a young age while your godfather struggled, are reduced to penury.”
Damn the bint.
"Quite right," Lucius said, nodding.
," and with that Harry surrendered, pitching forward to grasp the hair at the back of Draco's neck tight as he came, hot and furious, deep inside Draco's body.
"Ah, there you are Harry!" Sirius said as Harry hastened through the foyer of the Ministry of Magic. He was dressed in the purple robes that signified him as a Wizengamot member, and as various staff and visitors hurried past him, they each in turn gave him a small bow of acknowledgement.
“Indeed. I have a memory I wish you to see. However, I do not wish to be long parted from it. Do you have access to a Pensieve?”
Sirius hesitated, and Harry saw the truth in his face. “I think if you do, whatever misfortune Lucius has planned for you will end up involving your wife and children, if it doesn’t already.”
“Oh, yes, him,” Draco said, remembering a certain athletic enthusiasm which had made for a very interesting long weekend, and a certain incorrect name blurted out at an inopportune moment. He scowled. “It wouldn’t get back to Boot straight away, would it?”
"Lord Malfoy," Harry forced out as Lord Malfoy and Crabbe brushed past him.
"What are you…" Harry began, but then Draco had moved his mouth and Harry felt his testicles being licked thoroughly, first one then the other. It was an utterly new sensation and it made his whole body jerk with pleasure until Draco pulled away all together.
“Not long at all,” Sirius promised in his rash way.
"In any case," Sirius went on, "we should be going. Arrival times are precisely worked out, you know. You remember the Floo address?"
Blaise’s eyebrows lifted in surprise, or perhaps it was resignation. Harry couldn’t tell. “Very well. I tried.” He reached for his wand with exaggerated slowness, and pulled his memory from the Pensieve, returning it to his head. “I think it best I be on my way, then.” He hesitated another moment until Harry gave him his full attention. “I know you’re used to a great deal of trouble, Potter, but I don’t think you’ve had nearly enough practice dodging it.”
Harry sighed. "I'll get my cloak."
"He said they are too powerful to be given such a direct cut," Harry responded, just as quietly.
"Come," Draco said, spreading his legs invitingly. "Sit with me."
Draco took a moment to read it and his eyes flew at once to Harry’s.
“The question before the committee is as follows: Should the bill be presented in its current form to the Wizengamot for debate? Ayes to the right, nays to the left.”
"I will try anything," Harry whispered, exhausted beyond measure.
For a moment Harry could not believe that he was hearing her correctly.
“Lucius—” Narcissa began, distress writ large on her lovely face.
Malfoy made an impatient noise. "I told you I knew why you came," Malfoy said, fanning out his fingers to idly check his manicure. "And you knew, too. Wasn't this what you wanted?"
Harry sighed. “I have never been very good at any of that, Sirius.”
“All right, Pansy, you have my undivided,” Draco said. “Potter and Wood have gone splitsville?”
"Good. Now for Merlin's sake, let us put an end to this. If you embarrass the family tonight it will be in front of the entire wizarding world, Draco, and that will be the end of you. Is that understood?"
The Malfoys had, however, been invited to the festivities celebrating Lily's birth.
Sirius had told Harry so many of his truths that Harry could only do the same. "I cannot be without him, Sirius.  It is as though he owns every part of me, body and soul.  I am completely his, to do with as he wishes.  I would do anything for him.  Anything at all."
"Just tell me, Harry," Hermione said, her voice now full of trepidation, "what could be so bad?"
“His dog?” Fawley repeated. “I was unaware that Harry Potter had a dog.”
Harry would once have been mortified to hear someone speak of him so. These days any number of indignities had been heaped upon him, and he could no longer bring himself even to flinch. He was, though, capable of gratitude when Farley snapped, “Shut it, Smith. You wouldn’t smell so hot either if they wouldn’t let you bathe.”
"Marvellous," Lucius said. "It was the greatest regret of my life that Narcissa and I were able only to have the one child."
Now was the time to tell him. Harry mutely handed the card over.
Sirius laughed. "You do not think you chose Ginny? Your best friend's sister, part of a family you so dearly loved? No, Harry," Sirius said, slapping him on the back. "You chose wisely indeed."
No reason to bother. Because Draco didn't want to hide this: he wanted it to be all right to display it to the world, Harry knew that now.
Harry looked at him and thought of all the responsibilities he had weighed against the sense of fulfilment he longed for and found himself denied. "Yes," he breathed into Draco's skin. "Yes, let's do that. Let's do exactly that."
Draco smiled at him. He seemed to be almost in a trance, but quite a different state from the silent, withdrawn creature who had accompanied Harry home from Malfoy Manor. “You, Harry,” he said, and the hint of triumph was back. “You, just like this. You, taking control of your pleasure and mine. Only you.”
"Malfoy," Harry rapped out when it seemed that Malfoy was going to go to his bedroom without registering his presence.
Hermione snorted again. "If you can consider equal rights for women anything but the commonest sense!"
"I know we spoke only this morning Harry," Remus said, "but I hoped you would join me for luncheon."
“He will not,
Harry had never felt less worthy of praise. He swallowed hard and forced himself to look into Ron's face and smile and nod his agreement.
Draco said nothing for a long moment.
Harry didn’t know what he intended to say until “It’s not true!” burst out of him. “You cannot expect me to believe that all of it, more than a year, was nothing more than a revenge plot!”
"Caning?" Harry repeated.
"I am the Mirror of Erised for you," Harry said earnestly. "You look at me and you forget everything that's real."
Filch squirmed. “Different types. Valets. Groomsmen. That sort of thing.”
Ginny did not ask the obvious question, though the slight frown remained on her face. She instead came directly to the heart of the matter, a trait he appreciated in her. “The boys have been asking for you. All the time – they’re longing to see you.”
Then Draco bit at Harry's throat and Harry ignited at last, coming in a shuddering explosion of heat and sound. He gasped, he groaned, he screamed, he didn’t know what sound he made, only that he felt it torn from his throat and Draco's grip on his body tightened in response just before he followed Harry over the edge.
Kirke was balls-deep inside Draco when Harry flicked his wand. “
Harry acknowledged the point and sipped from his glass. "It was not something I knew within me."
"No," Harry said. "No, we could not." He had destroyed that.
Having delivered the gin, Bertram knelt at Harry’s feet and gave him what must have been a much-practiced coy look. “What can I do for you tonight, sir?”
Did Harry want that?
“‘Loved those of great ambition’,” Draco quoted with a smile. He downed the port all at once and crossed to kneel before Blaise, who opened his legs. Draco placed his palms on Blaise’s thighs. “I’m going to have him, Blaise.”
Draco had to reach over his head to grasp the edge of the desk or he would have lost his very sanity. He smacked his wrist into the edge once, twice, the sharp bloom of pain giving him enough clarity from the haze of pleasure to blurt, “Inside, want you, inside.”
“I had hoped we could have a chance to speak, Mr Potter. It has, after all, been too long.”
In the centre of the assembly room stood Lucius, Lord Malfoy. His hair gleamed in the light, and as he turned, Harry felt a mental blast as steel grey eyes met his.
The Wizengamot was in session, part of the requirement for Harry to remain in town. That, rather unfortunately, did mean he occasionally had to make an appearance. Harry dressed himself carefully while Draco watched and threw in the occasional comment about his tie and his colours.
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Hermione was saying. “We’ll fight it. I will do everything I can to find grounds for an appeal and we can maybe even get Draco on the stand…”
Draco had thought of what it would be like to kiss Potter many times. He’d considered factors such as raw passion, relative experience and desire. He hadn’t realised that Potter would kiss like a man starved, like he was tugging Draco into his very being. He hadn’t known that lips and tongue could do more than act as interesting prelude but could be used to make him want to beg, plead, just keep touching me, yes…
Harry flushed again as a boy he could only assume was Kirke stepped forward with a sly smile. Another titter ran around the room. Harry felt himself flush.
“And you thought that gave you carte blanche to disrespect him with impunity?”
Harry pulled back. “On your knees,” he ordered. Draco sank down before him at once, awe on his face. Harry switched their places to lean back against the wall and was abruptly reminded of the five mostly-naked renters in the room.
More gasps. More half-truths. No way to tell the truth without bringing Draco into it, which would not save Harry.
~o0o~
Smith sneered at him. "You've a visitor," he said, reaching for the chains around Harry's wrists. Farley stood close behind him, as though Harry could have summoned the will to break for freedom.
“Draco Malfoy,” she responded, her brow furrowed in the confusion. She looked sharply towards Harry. “I didn’t expect you to have guests so early – I came to bring you some letters which have been collecting at home.” She smiled tremulously. “You know, the hand-delivered ones to the ‘chosen one’ himself.”
"I always defer to your opinions in such matters," Harry said, causing Ron and Hermione both to laugh. He smiled back, glad that they were there, then began urging them into the house. Ron grinned at Dobby, who grinned back. Most people walked right past their house elves but Dobby had always been different. The other house-elf, Kreacher, tended to skulk around muttering to himself all the time.
"When did you last sleep?" Harry went on and his voice broke. "Draco, you look awful and I…"
Malfoy wrenched himself away, tension in every line of his body. Harry swallowed hard against a rising tightness in his throat as Draco deliberately put a distance between them.
"But it seems I have worried you. And so," he concluded, "I am come here. I know, Sirius, that you have been continuing on the duties of the Potter estates as well as those of the Black family and it has been a great kindness, leaving me free to focus on family and friends, but I am a man grown and I should now take the reins myself."
“You want me to support a law which would ruin perhaps thousands of lives?”
"You say you cannot resist," Draco countered, "and yet there you are, all but fully dressed." Draco himself was naked and golden in the morning light, wrapped partly in a blanket to guard against the cold but the effect was far from demure. His mouth, vulnerable, hinted at the delights which might be found in the coiled spring of his muscles. His eyes were full of challenge and demand.
"Do not," Harry forced out, "even
"Who did you expect, boy?" one of the portraits snarled; Harry kept his mouth shut after that.
He would never have had his children, though. And he would never wish their lives away. James and Albus were growing up fine, and though he had barely seen Lily he loved her. Thinking of them simultaneously relaxed and pained him. But there was no world in which he could have everything he wanted and Harry knew that beyond doubt.
“Mr Filch, it is true is it not that you are a Squib?”
“He’s probably right. They’ll try something else.” He looked at Sirius. “Lucius Malfoy had Percy dismissed from the Department Head position.”
“So it wasn’t just a drunken accident?” Harry said, still uncertain.
"Weasley," came the drawl and Harry closed his eyes against the reality of the four of them in this room. "What a delight to see you again." The voice dripped sarcasm and Harry saw Ron's jaw tighten.
The measurements and bank visit had taken until three. That only left Draco 2 hours to do something about Terry Boot and get to the Auror office.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment. "Of course."
"Ginny, I fear I will add nothing to your time here and will in fact detract from your pleasure. Sirius still has the running of the Potter estate, but it is well past time for me to assume that responsibility and I therefore should return to town."
“I’m not a child, Potter,” Draco said haughtily in the tone that meant,
Draco did not speak.
Harry closed the door behind him and with a whispered charm, locked it firmly. "What exactly was that about, Malfoy?"
Sirius had sat down to breakfast before Harry even made it downstairs. Kreacher poured Harry some tea unprompted and Harry thanked him quietly.
Harry looked away. "I'm risking a lot to be here with you," he said softly.
Draco turned fully towards Harry. "Politics? We are dressing for dinner and you wish to further discuss politics?"
"Anything I can do for Harry Potter!" the little elf said, excited and Harry smiled despite himself. He was glad he had insisted on obtaining the ingredients; there were one or two which were quite rare and expensive and if he had not bought them himself, Hermione would never have asked him for repayment.
“What?” Baddock began. “No, I…”
“Into the afternoon, certainly. The committee reshuffle should be announced today. I expect to be appointed to the Committee for Conjuration based on what Sirius told me, so that should at least be a meaty one.”
"Not by me."
"What on earth, Harry?" she demanded. "You tell me you fear you are under a love spell and when we find that you are not, you abandon your wife and children?"
"Zabini actually; but of course we are not formally acquainted," Zabini said. He pulled a fine silver cigarette case from his pocket. "I would offer one to you but I see that you are already indulging. Perhaps you would like to try one of these presently. They are imported from Italy, very fine indeed." He lit the cigarette.
"I see – so you did not write to me from school?" Harry asked, his heart pounding.
Harry shook his head and sipped at his mead. "In any case, it was a little unpleasant."
"Mr Potter!" she cried, racing down the stairs at once. "Thank goodness!"
"Ever the hero," Draco said. "You shock me."
"I do," Harry said.
When Remus arrived, the whole greeting party became occupied, Sirius with his dear friend, Ginny with Andromeda who always loved babies. It afforded Harry the chance to speak to Teddy, for which he had been most eager.
Harry touched his face, already thinking that the hours until seven would pass slowly beyond all comprehension.
The elf continued to mutter as he stomped from the room.
Harry had missed something; the Wizengamot as a whole was bursting into life. Some booed, others shouted objections, a few even seemed to be in support but were largely drowned out by the others.
"Not precisely an incentive," Draco said and Harry could hear the smirk.
“As far as I can see,” Sirius said, “your only remaining option is to do as Blaise suggested and flee.”
Harry didn't know what to do.
“Well, I left a note,” Potter said with a shy smile.
"But becoming a parent is an amazing adventure, is it not?" said Lucius with a shark's smile.
Draco Malfoy sat there on a brown high-backed leather chair, his pale skin luminous in the lamplight. Harry swallowed as his throat felt tight. Malfoy was sitting with one leg draped over a chair arm, arrogant insouciance evident in every line of his body. Harry remembered his determined passion in the carriage and in the Hogs Head, his defiant posture as his father tried to bend his will.
“Objection – leading the witness!”
"Thank you, Mr Potter," she returned a little impishly.
“What?” Draco said. “Just… what? Potter-“
~o0O0o~
In the suite itself, Harry began methodically packing his things into a trunk much larger on the inside than the outside. He had half-expected that Draco would have destroyed everything he’d left behind but instead everything was exactly as he had left it.
It was true he’d hurt Kirke for daring to do what he and Draco had asked, just because Harry had changed his mind. He had brought this on himself firstly by going to renters and secondly by hurting them.
I have ruined all their lives, Harry thought, not for the first time. Ginny, James, Albus, Lily – they shall bear the shame of my actions for the rest of their lives. And the others, all the other men like me, I've ruined their lives, too.
"I could have, I suppose," Draco went on, his voice dull. "Perhaps I should have when I was younger. Found someone suitable and done my duty. But I knew it wasn't what I wanted and I saw no reason to bother."
"Of course you do. It is not the most exotic blend we have available here but I would be no kind of host if I could not make my guests comfortable." The final word dripped with disdain.
"It is hard for her, with her daughter so young," Ginny said. "And I think, if you will pardon the indelicacy, that there may shortly be another."
This was Harry’s nightmare come to life.
Draco looked down at himself again. He was looking ridiculously sexy today, if he did say so himself. “I rather think I have.”
Draco’s rentboys, Harry thought, sickened. In their place. In their home. And it all pointed to Harry being the one frequenting them.
"Hermione," Harry burst out as she sat down, "Hermione, I need your help but I must first ask you to promise that you will tell no one about this."
Sirius blew excess air out from between his lips. “And what do you say?”
"Yes, my Lady," Muffy squeaked before she disappeared.
"It allows you to ensure that the people we actually want to see get here first," Harry had pointed out dryly.
Harry did not often let himself really perceive the gulf between himself and Draco but he could hardly ignore it now. He swallowed hard and stepped away from Draco to run his hands through his hair.
"Harry," she said in response. "Charlie, would you excuse us?"
Draco’s smile was a little sardonic but he accepted the gesture and indicated that Harry should take a seat.
"Ah, is that what brings you back to the city so promptly. Your elf's cooking?" Draco raised an eyebrow. "Very well, elf, lead on. This must surely be something to taste!"
Harry shook his head. He and Hermione had been through this. It might be possible to show that Draco had been pursuer rather than victim but that would hardly clear his name. He had been in a sexual relationship with another man and it was against the law, no matter the circumstances. The most pursuing this line would achieve would be to drag Draco down with him.
Harry's eyes flew open when Draco's tongue went rigid at the head of his cock, gasping with pleasure. He saw then that Draco was lying next to him but his position was inverted; his mouth was on Harry's cock, his own in front of Harry's face. Draco's erection seemed to surge towards him, desperately seeking entrance and Harry took it in his mouth at once, their earlier conflict completely forgotten.
“I must say, Potter, I was delighted you decided to accept my invitation,” said Ernie.
Draco’s voice was odd when he said, “Do you really think he will permit that? In his mind you have added insult to injury. He will see no alternative but to take you off the board.”
Harry was still trembling a little as they left the building, Malfoy joking with the renters all the way out. Harry pulled his cloak about him tight as Malfoy bid the boys farewell; he did not speak.
“Our life,” Harry echoed, delight suffusing his body. He felt powerful, immortal, beloved, and as he dropped to his knees to take Draco’s cock in his mouth, the musk and hardness of him irresistible, he was overwhelmed with a sense of how lucky he was to have such a love.
Malfoy did not speak. His eyes caught Harry's, focused and determined as Harry was sure his own must be wide and fearful.
Draco’s face snapped shut like a door to a debt collector. “Father,” was all he could manage.
With no small relief Harry and Sirius were able to excuse themselves to greet Remus and Teddy; as usual Sirius fell into immediate conversation with his oldest friend while Harry looked at Teddy.
Harry closed the door softly behind him.
Cries of “Oh!” and “Shame!” filled the air; Diggory cut them off with another silencing charm.
Harry smiled. "Perhaps it would behove you to pay your respects to Bill and Fleur Weasley?" he said, teasing a little for the pleasure of watching Teddy's face flush with colour.
of Harry Potter’s reputation. I ask only that you hear the evidence. For you will not appreciate the strength of the case until you hear this evidence. The facts can and will be corroborated. Harry Potter is a predator. Thank you.”
The words seemed to bring Draco up short. He studied Harry’s face for a moment and whatever he saw there convinced him to nod. “I won’t. Never again.”
Ginny Weasley didn’t, no. But Potter’s next conquest did: the older, wiser, prettier Katie Bell.
“Oh, Harry,” he whispered. “I would give up anything, anything in the world except you.”
Perhaps distraction would be just the thing. He had barely left the house in a week and while it had meant a great deal of time with James and Albus, it had nonetheless felt claustrophobic.
Harry caught Ron's eye and for a moment they agreed perfectly: Hermione without a cause was a Hermione neither could imagine.
"You are right," Harry said faintly.
At length, Sirius had calmed himself enough to speak. "You are right, I did not marry. I did not take on the responsibility of a wife or children. You did. I have duties of my own which come with their own joys and demands. You have many demands upon you and you must find your own joy in your duty. We are English, Harry, and first and foremost an Englishman does his duty."
him, for Harry to touch and explore as he chose.
Pansy glared at him. “Draco, I have been calling you for a solid ten minutes,” she hissed. “I am attempting to share privileged information with you, and you… are you naked?”
"Something called
“You work now?” Charlie said, confused. He was distracted by a tug on his hand. “Yes, Victoire?”
Draco nodded and tapped it with his wand. "
“Is that so?” Harry said again, his whole body tightening as he made ready to spring into whatever action necessary.
"I don't think Father much cares." Draco shifted. "I might have liked to continue under Professor Snape's tutelage longer, but of course he was lost at the Battle of Hogwarts. Besides, he was only a half-blood and it would not have been fitting."
Draco's words stayed with Harry, however, and not long after he asked Draco, "Have you not visited your father since we returned to London?"
Anyway, that was hardly the point. The point was the exclusive piece in the
He took a room at the newly opened Great Western Royal Hotel.  It was lavish and modern enough to satisfy what he had deduced of Draco's tastes in such things, the façade was accented with detailed carvings in each pediment. In the morning light, the white sandstone gleamed, the jewel of Praed Street. Inside the furnishings were rich and ostentatious – the lounge boasted a series of landscape friezes on the walls which seemed to Harry to have come from all four corners of the globe.
"It must," Draco said simply. "Until then I ask you please, will you make the effort with my father?"
"And a cigarette, I think," Draco mused. He stroked his fingers over Harry's hand before he stood.
"Yes sir," Goyle replied, and with a crack of the whip they were away.
“Relevance. Again,” Hermione said flatly.
"What? Oh - yes," Harry said, recovering himself, but not quite quickly enough. Sirius appeared to notice the slip but chose to see it as mere distraction at the thought of Christmas.
"Indeed." It was Hermione; Harry hadn't heard her coming to join them and had rather counted on her being caught in Molly's effusive embrace for a few moments more. Harry took a fortifying sip of the wine.
After, Harry reflected that he couldn’t see how anything, even that, could have made the occasion worse. Narcissa was all charm and grace, as usual. Draco obviously doted on her but she was inclined to treat him like a fretful child.
“Better by far that I compromise myself again. Yes, of course,” Harry said bitterly.
He was not going to deny it then. Harry took a long breath to steady himself. “I could use some of that,” he said, indicating the decanter.
"You need to let me go," Harry whispers.
Harry knew he had hurt Draco by refusing to run away with him. Was that what Blaise was trying to push him towards? Was it as simple as wanting his friend to be happy?
"What is the matter?"
"Perhaps not," Harry said. "I may not stay. Please, can you let Sirius know I'm here."
To change the subject, Ron asked Harry, "Was there anyone else from school there?"
Lucius' mouth tightened. "Perhaps."
Harry felt as exhausted now as he could ever recall. “You did your best for me, Hermione,” he said quietly. “But I had to do my own best, too.”
The proceedings snapped back into focus dramatically when a man to whom Harry had never spoken before smirked a little and said, "Mr Potter. We meet at last."
"It had been three years by then.  But it was a secret, always a secret, until Regulus found out."
He lay down that night to sleep with a quagmire of feelings churning within him: tension, confusion, frustration, the terrible fear of discovery, but for the first time he felt hope that perhaps the madness would be fleeting. Perhaps since he had not been able to shake this desire with sheer will he could conquer it now with the application of knowledge.
"Is it over?"
Trying to keep his voice gentle, Harry asked, “Do you have something to say?”
“Hot like dragonfire,” Draco muttered. “Didn’t know he was in the country.”
“Yeah,” Charlie said, utterly unconvinced. “Reasonable.”
“Mr Potter is very busy,” said the receptionist, bored. “Name?”
Harry had earned his reputation as one of the bravest wizards of his generation. But that courage, so typically Gryffindor, always seemed to desert him when he had most need of it. He merely stood there in the hotel corridor, his eyes fixed on the gas lamp illuminating the fine patterns of the wallpaper.
"I'd best go inside," Harry gasped out and turned, stumbling back into the house.
Harry pushed himself up and looked into Draco's face. He raised his body to let Draco shift the angle. Draco's cock was only half-hard but still beautiful and Harry rubbed his hand over it, feeling it begin to stir.
“Minister, I move that the witness be regarded as hostile and be given
"Absolutely," Narcissa said. "Children are so important to one's happiness. Which is why we're so pleased to celebrate your birthday, Draco dearest."
It never would have worked on Smith, but Fawley sighed and put his wand away. “All right, he can see the dog. But you need to stay back there.”
Kirke had come back. He knelt down in front of Harry and reached out to touch him; Harry shied away. Kirke frowned and reached for him again; this time Harry caught his hand.
He shifted his weight all at once so that he was on all fours, crawling towards Harry as his eyes burned. "You cannot leave," Draco said, his mouth wetting his lips as Harry stood, transfixed. "Not until I am finished with you."
The day was therefore set for precisely five weeks after Lily's birth – 11
“I am sure I can find a way to amuse myself,” he replied airily. It did not fool Harry, though, who could see the way Draco was twisting the sheets in his fingers.
Draco snorted. "Of course not. But nor does that mean that I am completely opposed to his political stances either."
Harry might be a little slow on the uptake sometimes but he was not stupid. "I told you, they are my wife's team," he said coldly. "I do not believe that would be at all appropriate."
Draco turned, his face livid. In his hand was a letter; Harry frowned and looked to the window. Sure enough, there was an owl perched on the sill.
"So, Potter," Malfoy spat. "You will not meet with me or even acknowledge my letters but when that boy asks to see you, you do not even hesitate to answer his call."
"You were longer than I expected," Draco said.
Harry bit his lip. It wasn't missing his wife that troubled him, that caused him to toss and turn and wake each morning hard and horrified. Every time he spoke with Ginny she had some new minor ailment to complain of; Harry was not unsympathetic but it made conversation one-sided at best.
Harry shifted uncomfortably. "No, I cannot recall that we did."
“I want you inside me,” Harry let himself say.
Harry frowned at this even as Diggory asked, “How so?” It didn’t make sense.
“It’s true, isn’t it,” she said, looking away from him – not from shame but to spare him, he could tell. “That’s why you were so sure there was a love spell involved and why you found it hard to walk away from.”
"It's too warm," he remarked when Teddy frowned in confusion at the aborted gesture.
"Thank you for taking such good care of me," Ginny whispered to him softly one morning, sending him spiralling into shame all over again, wondering what she would say if she knew what he had done, how he had betrayed her.
Given the compromises made in their marriage, three is all there would ever be. Harry reached out and squeezed her hand gently.
Draco dared to look and there it was, his most magnificent creation, Harry sculpted in scarred flesh, his eyes the colour of the Resurrection stone, the symbol of the three Deathly Hallows burned into his forehead, the whole thing shot through by a bolt of lightning.
Draco’s face looked pained. "You interrupt an evening with my friends…"
Harry looked up. He had spent the day with Sirius looking into the finances of the Black estate and had not anticipated an evening excursion.
It was quite the other way around, Harry was beginning to realise; Harry could not come between Draco and Lucius, not for long. Crabbe’s words so long ago now seemed like a kindly-meant warning rather than a threat.
Though the door Harry went, hat and cloak in hand.
"That—" Harry couldn't think of a word bad enough.
“And what employment do they usually undertake?”
“Yes, Harry, yes,” he babbled, becoming less coherent as Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco’s cock and started pumping. He was hard in his own trousers now, of course he was, but this was not about him. This was about proving to Draco once and for all that he might have made Harry his, body and soul, but that it went both ways. Draco belonged to him and Harry was going to claim him.
"I wish I could," Ginny replied, her voice a little tart. "We all have our crosses to bear."
Draco looked at him for a long moment. “You cannot have everything. It is simply not possible. And when you finally accept that, it may well be too late.” He rose from the bed then, naked but for some crumpled underwear, and pulled on his outer robes.
"Fuck me!" Draco said again, begging this time, no longer demanding but reduced to pleading with his lover to take him, make him his once again.
Lord Draco Malfoy was walking up to the darkest corner of the alley. Harry frowned, his vision adjusting to the gloom. He could just make out a figure pressed against the wall, Malfoy leaning and pressing his long fingers on the front of the crotch. Harry's eyes widened as his vision grew clearer – it was a
"Will he be joining us?" Harry asked.
“Why would I bother?”
So it really hadn’t been Baddock who’d left the mouth marks on his thighs? Good to know. Also, perhaps in front of 20 curious Aurors was not the best place for this conversation.
Harry paused for a moment. He knew Draco to be capable of much, many terrible things, but this? “No.”
Blaise returned to his seat with his cigarette and his port. “I see. You intend to make a nuisance of yourself until he – what, takes pity on you? Or throws you a fuck so you’ll leave him alone.”
had warned him.
He could feel Harry’s smile against his skin. “So you’re going to keep me?”
Harry reached through the bars and Padfoot ran across to greet him, licking his hand and letting Harry pet him and hold him close.
It took the better part of a fortnight to make the arrangements for the presentation, and longer for Ginny to feel ready to be included. The prevailing wisdom had it that this was still much too soon, but Harry was desperate to get away from London and Ginny had almost matched him in this feeling.
Sirius took one look at him and said, “That will be all, Kreacher.”
” said Potter, producing a wand from somewhere and waving it towards the door. “
"Too long," Sirius asserted firmly and Harry was inclined to agree.
"I'm sorry, I meant to but I found the NEWTs took all the time I had. And then, well," Teddy blushed. "I know she's still a little young, but… Victoire Weasley is very nice, isn't she?"
~o0o~
“Actually,” said Draco, “
“So,” Potter said, fiddling with his trousers.
Harry's eyes narrowed at the thought of all the men Draco must have done this to, to be able to lie there so casually and say something like that. He redoubled his efforts at once, sliding his finger further into Draco's body and when the response came again it was not, this time, so unexpected. Harry kept his head back just a little so that his mouth was never more full than he could bear. Draco's hips jerked back onto his finger, forward into his mouth. Draco's breath was hot on his lower body but he could not seem to catch his breath long enough to resume his ministrations; Harry had made him come undone and all at once his mouth was flooded.
Harry did not know where to look, what to think. His mind was no longer awhirl: rather it was almost completely blank. Some seismic shift had happened deep within him and he felt wiped clean, exhausted and confused and almost like weeping.
“Him, Weasley, Granger-Weasley, and I think Girl Weasley.”
"For the Yule Ball at the Manor," Draco said. "Did I not tell you? It is by far Mother's favourite event of the year. Everyone must wear white or palest blue, most of the Ministry will be in attendance, and the finest families in the land are all invited."
“Cold mutton! Indeed, how you malign our glorious Majesty. I hear rumours of six-course dinners every night and were it not specifically forbidden, I am certain we Malfoys would have been afforded the opportunity to discover the veracity of this first-hand!”
Let me know what you think?
Mindlessly, Harry pushed Draco back onto the dining table. Draco laughed a little. "We'll make something of you yet, Potter!" he said before Harry's teeth closed on his shoulder and he elicited a deep, throaty moan.
Zabini's eyes gleamed. "Ah – well, society comes alive after dark, as is its wont in any location. There are a few of us here from town. Myself, Nott – Malfoy, of course."
"You're here," Harry said stupidly, his wand forgotten.
“I don’t…
o0O0o
"Malfoy," Harry said, trying to remember. "The name is familiar."
"Er," Harry said when mercifully he was saved.
"Draco," Harry hissed as the house elf closed the door behind itself.
Malfoy stilled. For a moment Harry had hope that he would let go, walk away. Harry knew for certain that he could hide from Malfoy, stay away from him, stay safe that way for a lifetime but the moment Malfoy touched him, he was lost.
Harry had tried for the gentlest tone he could muster but some of his horror must have shown through, as Draco jerked away from him at once. "No, I do not see that. Why should that be?"
of them. It had been a long, long time since there had been anything that all three of them couldn't share.
Wind whipped through the vaults, improbable, impossible. The Elder Wand glowed bright and brilliant, lightning shooting out of it and directly into the body on the slab. The force of it was trying to push Draco away, trying to break the connection – Harry was screaming something but Draco couldn't hear him over the rushing in his ears.
Draco made a terrible sound. "Yes, yes, marry, have children. Have an heir, Draco, it's your duty, Draco. You're such a disappointment, Draco. You're a child."
"Do you intend to end our marriage?" she asked bluntly.
Malfoy responded by kissing his throat and tugging more insistently at his clothes. Harry thrust up hard and felt Malfoy's cock just
"Merlin's beard, Draco, more clothes?"
“Can’t it wait?” Draco managed, clutching his head. What in blazes had he done to himself last night?
Potter smirked at that and finally, finally undid his own belt and let his trousers drop. Draco tried to reach for him while he stood there for just a moment in ridiculous red underpants which didn’t make Draco want him any less, but Potter batted him away.
"That is just what I think," Draco said quickly.
~o0o~
. There is so, so much still to show you."
Blaise lit the cigarette hanging from Draco’s mouth. “You always were good at detecting those interested in the Greek perversion.”
Teddy had seemed more confused than anything by what had happened at the time, but what if now that he was older he had made sense of it and wanted to confront Harry? Or what if he wanted…
Harry doesn't answer him. Not the body on the slab nor the spirit in the corner.
"Nothing like that!" Harry reassured her at once, cursing his own stupidity in scaring her so badly. "Not at all, no, much more like…" Harry bit his lip. "You remember Romilda Vane?"
"Tell me you're mine," Harry heard himself demand in a voice he barely recognised.
"Like this," Draco whispered. "Just like this, so that I can watch you."
"Is that so?" he said quietly, and his tone must have been dangerous because Zabini and Nott both looked at him sharply, the humour fading from their faces. "I beg you will excuse me."
Yet the words lingered in Harry's mind. He knew that no one could possibly understand or support this relationship, but he had allowed himself the luxury of choosing not to think on it. He was aware, however, that their time together was stolen and that the world they had created for the two of them could not last forever.
There was some undercurrent here that unsettled Harry still further. He felt as though he had been glued in place by the door but Malfoy stepped right in to his admirers, reaching out a hand to one in particular. The boy smiled up at him with something terribly coquettish in his expression and Harry realised with a surge of nausea that he was looking at the boy Malfoy had been touching in the alley. Now, Malfoy smiled as though genuinely pleased to see him and ran a casual hand through the boy's hair. He turned to Harry and as he did so, the way he touched the boy seemed to change, turning from possessive to inclusive.
"You've been hiding," Ron was saying.
Zabini shrugged. "I thought you would be. Draco is so tiresome these days – I had rather hoped that you would be able to divert him." The tone in which Zabini said the last two words made Harry's hackles rise.
“That is so, Mrs Weasley. Mr Potter, are you happy for Mrs Weasley to act for you in this matter?”
“Get out!” he snapped at them as Draco fumbled with the lacings on his trousers. They all scrambled to obey, even Kirke who was rubbing his head as though the fall might have hurt him. In the moment Harry couldn’t bring himself to care about the dark look the other man sent him, as Draco had found his cock and brought it to his mouth. Harry let his head fall back with a groan and cupped Draco’s cheek in his hand. He could never remember wanting it so badly and Draco met the challenge, lucking and sucking, bobbing his head until Harry’s cock bumped the back of his throat. Harry’s fingers tightened. He brought his other hand to Draco’s head and began to fuck his mouth in earnest. Hot, wet, needy,
Draco, bored, said, "There's all manner of things you can't do without a body." He slipped his hand down the swell of Harry's arse and slipped a finger inside him, just enough to let Harry know he was there, made him gasp and his eyes flutter open.
Harry stilled. "As in, to have tea with your parents?"
"I think you need the corpse, the instruments of life, the right elixir…"
The evening was warm, and Harry had found it pleasant before, but all at once it rather seemed suffocating. Harry stepped further into the gardens, telling himself to stop thinking of Malfoy even as he wondered why he had not yet arrived.
“I’ll tell her as soon as you’re formally charged,” Hermione promised. “I can pass on any message you want.”
"He will hear by the end of the month," Remus said. "But speaking of Teddy, I must get back to him and the others."
Kirke nodded. “It’s beautifully written you know. Golden beauty and so forth.”
It was Percy. Not a day after Lucius’s threats, Percy lost his position at the Department of Magical Transportation. He was not outright dismissed but rather shuffled to a lower position in a different department – a better outcome than Harry could have expected for him but no doubt intended merely as a first step, to demonstrate Lucius’s sincerity.
