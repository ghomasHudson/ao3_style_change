You left all your things, even the letters from when we were children. It seems like another lifetime ago we wrote those; Hogwarts, Voldemort. Green ink smudged over your hands, and wonder in your eyes. You saved me - but you already know that, don’t you?
Harry sighs. Changed or not, Draco’s still bloody hard work. His fingers slide unconsciously under the string around his wrist, worrying it back and forth. “Are you happy?” He regrets the question immediately; Draco’s fists clench and his expression turns incredulous. It’s the most animated Harry has seen him since...
The heavy door is smooth, cold under his hand and always surprisingly pliant to his touch, swinging open on soundless pins with no resistance nor complaint.
The two envelopes, successfully passing the myriad of detection spells Harry instinctively casts when presented with mail from unknown owls, are unremarkable at first glance. Thick yet plain parchment, nondescript in the extreme and bearing no telling marks other than his own name and address in black ink on the front, and an unbranded red wax seal to the back. One, however, Harry notes with as much interest as one can muster over envelopes, is decidedly plumper than its sibling and bears the number II delicately scribed above its seal; the thinner, the number I.
pseudo-Draco's hands on him, have the steel links of whatever's clinking draped across his body, revel and bow under the weight of restraint whilst the blunt end of a cane carves rivers of blood across his back.
- running, only running, tears falling unbidden as he wove his way through unfamiliar streets, the sound of Harry long lost behind him, now only his own fear and self-loathing and
I survived the Dark Lord; I’m sure you’ll find sweet irony in the fact your absence is harder to weather.
to align; the former hardly appearing the type to dabble in the darker shades of copulation. Harry has been wrong in the past, of course - learnt the face one wears for day has no determination on the one worn after dusk or between the sheets - yet contrary to whatever fantasies his heart conjures on the matter, his mind rejects the notion that the man Harry pursues through the glossy pages of the tabloids would have any inclination whatsoever to
; if Harry's attire of dark jeans and a simple white t-shirt seems disgustingly blasé when compared to the exotics this man apparently drapes himself in. The scent of lemons grows closer, tinged with the earthy smell of sweat, and a low clank of chain against chain.
He nods once, impressed with himself. It's all complete shit, of course. He hasn't courted anyone in centuries. Since Camille, in fact, which shows how utterly naive Harry is in asking him for advice. Still, the opportunity is far too good to miss, and he almost believes himself he's so convincing.
," Draco interrupts, the awed hush of his voice soothing upon Harry's skin; for a moment he forgets himself, preens and
Draco pulled his head away from Harry’s shoulder, leaning back so he could study his face. “Isn't this why you left? What you ran from?”
Potter got to his feet a little unsteadily, bracing a hand on the concrete wall for support. Draco followed suit, jumping when Potter wrapped an arm around his bicep and pulled him close. "Its been a while since I did this" Potter muttered, furrowing his brows.
There's something in the sound of his tone. A familiarity which grates along Harry's subconscious, an articulation his mind insists he should know.
weeks. More the feeling that this is his last opportunity. His one and only chance to grasp the lifering, or sink forever beneath the murky surface.  It’s a hard leap to take. So easy, to simply let time pass him by, an observer rather than the participant everyone expects him to be. A watcher of the world, unbiased and without opinion. So when he does eventually find himself back on the platform, awaiting that final train, he’ll be able to move on. For good, this time. Without fear of being needed again - the thing which pulled him back. Before.
and conquering every inch of himself until he's reduced to nothing more than the sharp cut of bitter and only a flicker of what it meant to be Harry.
Your cock is hard and flushed. You've drawn this torturous prelude out far longer than usual. Wanting Harry begging for it; wanting your audience desperate themselves. It's all part of the game. You, Harry, on display for whoever has found their way to the room that night. Oh, you enjoy it - there's no doubt about that. Revel in the eyes fixed on your every movement, the hitched intakes of breath, the slap of palms against cocks, the knowledge that it's you and him they're jerking off to. That's where it ends for you, however. Flattered ego and narcissistic delight, yet nothing further profound. But
It was fine. But I'm back now. This is where I’ll wait, despite the pain. Every footstep on the landing is yours, every owl bears your letter, every gust of wind is you sighing my name. It hurts, but I know it won’t be for long. I hope.
Iniquity has taught him much over the past seven years; he'd unearthed himself within the shadowed haven it offered, unknowing until then he'd needed to be found. It was in their alcoves where he discovered what he needed, what it meant to want something different than others. What it felt like to bend until he broke and then be rebuilt whole.
Harry abruptly lurches forward, displacing an affronted-looking Chairman Meow in the process and pours himself another 1897  scotch, gulping the spirit back with no heedance to its vintage. Magnus decides yes, he probably could muster the strength.
He sensed, rather than saw, Harry stand. A hand was placed cautiously on his arm, but he shrugged it off. If it had stayed, he would have broken.
You've been with men since that, of course. The nameless bodies used to sate an itch; relieve the tension. None have ever come close to this: this intensity and need which leaves the room heavy with a palpable urgency.
The floor groans under the man's muted footfalls. Harry tracks the movement around the room, hearing the squeak of what sounds like PVC clad thigh against PVC clad thigh. He can only wonder what the other is wearing if he sounds like
"Don't move." The voice is closer this time, stricter, a command. Even as hand inches closer to wand, Harry can feel his will crumple against the directive in the unknown man's tone. It's definitely a man, there's no mistaking the low tenor and rasp as anything but, and even though on some level Harry knows it must be his elusive partner for the night, his fear is a visceral foe. "I'd stop making for your wand, if I was you," the voice comments, still closer, gaining on him. "Of course, it won't do much in here, but it would be ill-advised to anger me this early on in the evening, wouldn't you agree?" A pleasant threat, dangerous all the same. It's what Harry signed up for, after all, isn't it? Submission and dominance and no-holds-barred, complete abnegation for an unknown stranger behind a mask; he hadn't factored on not having his sight, however.
“What if I don't want to tell you, Harry?” All of a sudden Draco was tired, his body weighted down as if tied to rocks, and all he wished to do was sink under the water to oblivion. “What if I don't want to relive the past? You can't compensate for me; repent for me with your blood. I'm not one of your lives to pay for.”
He feels exposed. Under scrutiny. The centrepiece of some convoluted art installation, waiting to be declared unworthy or inspired by the fortuitous roll of the dice.
Ron. The first, from the very first platform. Who’d risked his family to go; came back to one less. Harry can’t blame Ron for wanting to move forward. His past holds nothing but Fred.
“Potter”, you manage to choke out stiffly once the silence becomes unbearable. “Harry,” you amend, and the name feels foreign on your tongue.
You’re nearing where he’s stood, back pressed to the wall, cheeks still flushed from dancing. His friends crowd him as you approach, the two which complete the trio, and a fissure of jealousy shoots through you. Not at the girl but at the boy. The man. The one always privy to his secrets. The receiver of his affection, who basked in the glow of his fame.
When he was twenty two he learnt acceptance. How the events of the past faded over time, and whilst they never disappeared, one could begin to live with them. Even though one had once done wrong, it didn't mean they would forever be wrong. What his body craved didn't make him less - a deviant, an abomination - and it was okay to give in to the free fall, because someone would catch him.
His coming breaks the strain of your audience. Unintentionally, unthinking, you seek out pale blue and orange hair, knowing one or the other will be breaking - squandering your will to the perverse need to witness twin uncome by twin. He's looking right at you, connect in a second. You watch, helplessly lost in the feeling of Harry and the sight of George, as he stiffens, hands tangled in Fred's hair, and empties himself into his twin's mouth.
"Fuck, Potter. Are you drunk?" Draco asked, smelling for the first time the stench of alcohol beneath the general stink of filth.
The visit with his mother had been brief, just long enough to assess that she was okay and being looked after, before he had fled as fast as he could. It wasn't that he didn't want to see her - after going five years with no contact he ached for her with an intense longing found only between mother and child - more that he was afraid of the questions he knew he had to ask.
"A what?" he asks, momentarily distracted from the earth-shattering revelation of Draco's affection.
"You're in my bed, Potter, and I'm close to passing out." Potter made no indication that he had heard Draco, continuing to obsessively stroke his wrist, so he threw caution to the wind. If Potter had wanted him dead, he would have been dead, and Draco was long past caring what others thought of him and how he chose to survive. Instead, he shuffled over the compacted dirt floor and collapsed beside his once-enemy, pulling a smelling blanket over him to ward off the cold. "You don't flinch when you see me. People normally do."
You clutch the firewhiskey tighter in your hand, the condensation that rolls down the tumbler and over your pale fingers the one saving distraction in this room. This room, which is too bright, too loud. Too full. Of
Harry's gagged. He knows that much, is familiar with the stretch and clamp and taste of a ball-gag lodged firmly between teeth. His response is instinctive; the aftermath of days and evenings spent like this in this very club, although never under such pretences. Never with only his taste and smell to guide him through a scene. His arousal is a potent swirl of lust and apprehension, the lick of intoxicating stimulation at the base of his spine. Harry's sure he can smell it, pheromones on the air as if he's suddenly a werewolf, sure that his dick must be swelling, his toes curling. He wants to cry out, shudder. Bend and twist under the misinstrations of an unknown man his mind cannot help but mould into Draco. It's not. He knows it's not, he wouldn't, couldn't, be that lucky. Is positive his body would know somehow, even without a face to guide him. Yet here in this blankness, the stranger's unknowingly given him a gift: the prerogative for fabrication. Unconditional allowance to pretend.
, it's simply less of the terrified sort, and more toward sheer bloody mindless urgency to get pseudo-Draco's hands on him.
A disturbance in the air pulls him from his reverie. When he returns, Draco has moved away, toward the frozen lake the path he’s on encircles. Harry watches as Draco lowers himself to the stonework along the water's edge, legs dangling free over the ledge. One un-gloved hand trails aimlessly through loose snow, the other he tucks between his thighs. He’s wearing robes today. Warm ones, Harry assumes, although he would have sworn they were more suited to a gala, than the wet banks of London.
You made me feel whole. So broken I was, scarred and marked, unknowing of what normality meant - unprepared for a post-war existence. It was you who brought meaning back into my life, taught me how to breathe when the crowds jostled closer, pulled me back from the oblivion I so perilously craved. You, who sat beside me, night, after night; your fingers in my hair the only thing keeping me sane.
His companion's quiet, long enough Harry doesn't think he'll get an answer. It's understandable, expected, not as if Harry's offering up his own; yet. There's something about the voice he can't shake, though, an insistence on familiarity niggling from some deep corner of his mind. Harry wants this man, in false illusion and not. What he's offering, promised. Fear of recognition, however, toward both him and his opponent, is not easily overcome, even in the midst of the moment.
For a fleeting moment, you let yourself imagine what it would be like if you let yourself submit. Just once. Just for the night. To bite down, and feel the smooth rubber of a ball gag lodged between teeth. The burn of raw wrists which have fought against course rope, the ache in your shoulders from having them bound above your head for too long. Feel the trickle of blood as it runs over clammy skin. The pull of the cuts it originated from, put there in pain and lust; begged for with a whimper which couldn't be denied.  Know what it felt like, to stand bare before a mirror the morning after, fingers skimming over the weals made by another's hand, feel the hitch in your breathing and know that tonight, you would plead for more.
Today has been one of the worse since you left. This facade of sanity is hard to maintain, and I don’t know why I persist.
He glares at the mug, which has - to add insult - managed to stay intact despite its collision with the wooden floor. On impulse, he sends a quick ‘
Harry just grinned, and Draco looked down to see two perfect lighting bolt cuts on his thighs. A fitting end, both having given something that had been forced upon them a new meaning.
"Draco Malfoy wasn't that great to be." He breathed out. "And trust me Potter, I deserve everything I got."
Draco obliged, taking the man's verminous cock into his mouth. Hollowing his cheeks, he sucked; rhythmically alternating between deep swallows and teasing licks, his tongue tracing the vein that ran along the underside before swirling around the head. They were all the same to him. Just another dick to blow, to jerk. To have shoved up his ass. It had stopped being violation long ago. Now it was just a means to survive.
“Narcissa was right, Draco, when she said you weren't alone. I promise, we will do something about her situation. We just need some time.” Harry’s voice was gentle, muffled against his hair.
So lost to the intricacies of his skin, you jump when his hands come to land on your chest, pulling determinately at the clothing which has now become an offensive barrier between you. A sharp tug and your robes are falling. Another, and your shirt is gone. You notice the moment he sees them. The moment two plus two equals four, the loss of the undefined expression which is replaced by contrition. You growl, force his gaze upwards, hands tangled tightly in his hair so as to force his mouth on yours. A distraction, from the pallid cicatrice of sectumsempra. The lasting testament to the broken boy you had been.
"You're telling me, Magnus," Harry says slowly, finding his voice. "That to land Draco, I need to wear a ridiculous hat?" His tone is low, somewhat strangled. Breathy.
. Now, in the endless cycle of day and night, he weeps for the children they had been. What they’d had, gullible to the belief it could never be lost. Hope. Purpose. Drive. The conflagration of emotion. Each other.
"You fucking cunt." The man's fist connected with the side of Draco's face as he tried to right himself, sending him sprawling back onto the damp concrete. A kick landed to his ribs, followed quickly by another to his chest leaving him winded. Curling into a ball as the blows fell, they rained down across his huddled form. Pain. Draco was used to pain. Used to the sweet sickness, the battle between his body's need to protect itself and his mind’s steely determination to never show weakness.
What follows could only be described as a lesson in endurance as he proceeds to kiss every inch of your body, lips ghosting over tacky flesh, tracing the planes of your hips and back with his tongue - an amazing, abhorrent tease. You writhe; clenched hands and goose bumped skin, and it’s wrong, so wrong, that he can do this to you. Make your body react with just a brush of lips, make your head tilt back and make you scream, make your toes curl. Make your body a prisoner to his persuasive assailment. Make you want to beg.
“Look at what that survival cost you. And I don't mean the whoring. You lost your wand, your life. Everything that you had even known has been stripped from you. Yet you're standing here telling me that I didn't do wrong?”
It's the fairytale ending, his happily ever after, El Dorado and Eden and pots of gold at the end of rainbows. Unattainable. Unreachable; the entire sub-section of un's witnessed over the course of 7,852 sunsets to sunrises and points of the meridians. It would be far too many silver linings for Draco's and his own predilections when concerned with the art of
“There isn't anyone good left. That’s what the war achieved; the destruction of anyone pure. They shouldn't have died in vain.”
He is fire and ice and everything in between; numb, hypersensitized. The constant scent of citrus is his only alleviation from the utter ruination of mind and body, the single thread of sanity proffered to navigate the callous, cimmerian maze of sensation. He longs to cry out, would plead on bleeding knees if his voice could utter anything more than broken whimpers.
“How is it possibly your fault, Harry” Draco bit out. “Did you leave me wandless? Did you disinherit me? Oh, wait. Let me guess. You were Polyjuiced, and impersonating Dolohov. In that case, was the sex good?” Sarcasm dripped from his tone.
When he was six he knew fear. How it licked through his body; the paralysis that took root in his limbs and kept him frozen like a marionette, just as much a puppet on a string. Curled fetal-like in a dark corner he cowered, head hidden and eyes shut as his father yelled words that he couldn't distinguish. If only he was brave enough to protect his mother; courageous enough to do something other than fervently wish he could close his ears as easily as he could shut his eyes. Even in the safe clutch of darkness, fear found him. Although, it wasn't the threat of the boogieman which made him sleep hidden in his closet, blanket held close.
He turns to leave and Harry panics, hand darting out to clasp Draco’s bicep. He flinches but Harry doesn’t let go, tugging him gently so he’s forced to look at Harry. “When are you coming back?”
Your fingers tremble as they trace the boundaries of his visage, unsteady under the growing certainty it is indeed him. Unidentifiable, your ass; it's not easy to veil features fantasised about since youth now you let yourself look.
Magnus waves the question away with a flamboyant twist of his hand. "It's tradition, darling." Now he thinks about it, the napkin rings do sound familiar re. courting etiquette, although they may be more symbolic of
His cock is hardening, arousal stirring heady in the base of his spine. The wall is cool under his touch, polished stone or worn wood panelling. He rests his cheek against the surface. Stifles a moan as his dick grazes it.
There’s comfort in familiarity. It was this familiarly that called to him, when seconds or minutes or hours later, his home - his sanctuary - appeared before him. His hideaway under the overpass, blankets ratty, threadbare, grimy but
His muffled groans when he finds what he was looking for; as if that tiny, tight hole of debauchery and musk was ambrosia, straight from the Gods.
You hold him like that, and you wank him – clumsily, fervently, certainly not your best  – but that’s all it takes before he’s coming, head thrown back and arse constricting around your dick, smearing the mirror with streaks of cum. He’s beautiful like this,
This new before and after grows with every tick of your parent’s clock on our wall, and all I can think about is my response to your promised forever. I meant what I said: I'd follow you anywhere; life, after life, after life.
"Does it matter why?" Potter asked, turning to stare at him with eyes that were still impossibly green.
figure. Not the man he’s waiting for, the current purpose in his life. He’s too unlucky for that dream to come true, and Fate has once again proven her superiority, by giving him
The rarely used parlour - Hermione’s pitiful, unwilling stage. The location where she’d stood more than once, desperate appeals falling on deaf ears, Ron fidgeting on the settee whilst Harry stands in stoic silence. Dust sheets cover the aging chesterfields, although who put them there is a mystery. He can’t remember the last time he was in there; the last time people were over. It’s a soothing thought.
"Of course," Harry repeats somewhat sarcastically, but Magnus continues, undeterred. It's sound advice. He can remember a number of delightful hats worn over the course of his life; usually discarded in a frenzy by some saucy minx. Hats pull. It's proven.
The words left his mouth unbidden. “I would rather be here with you, Harry, than living in a world you refuse to inhabit.”
"Wonderful, Mr Potter," The Manager says with a bow of his head, the scroll disappearing from under Harry's hand abruptly. "Business is such a bore, isn't it, my chap, although demand of us it does. Gustavo will escort you to your room now - private, as you stipulated in your questionnaire, and your paramour for the evening will be with you shortly." The door opens and Harry turns to see a young man waiting, clad in the usual Iniquity uniform of a few scraps of leather and not much else, all plump lipped and doe-eyed and fire-burnt hair throwing reds and golds under the candlelight.
The wall is subtly textured, slightly roughened. Harry finds the brackets, curls his hands around the grooved bars. Lets his head dip forward. Inhales. Exhales. Tries not to tense. Fails.
When he was seventeen he found out that the worst pain, the worst fear, the worst rejection, came from within.
"I didn't know anyone could fall as low as me, and I've been falling for a long time. What happened that pushed you over the edge, Malfoy?"
Harry wants to take a step closer. Curl his fingers around Draco’s wrist. Prove to both of them the other is actually there; stop the possibility of the other man fleeing. Instead, he repeats, “I’ve been waiting for you.”
Of course they do. You're you, and he's him, and it's no secret, the past you share. They believe the tales told of your youth, the half-truths and the rumours, the stories that are spread. Like sheep they accept fiction as fact, dutifully following the examples of others, never bothering to question. You're the wolf, and they run scared.
You made me feel whole. So broken I was, scarred and marked, using liquor as a crutch to get me through the minutes till I could cut again. The satisfaction that control gave me was nothing compared to the intoxicating awareness you spawned. You pulled back the shutters; blew the dust off my decaying eyes. Now, that's gone.
Blankness settles, and although I know it's the last time I’ll be doing this, you're here with me in spirit, and it gives me strength.
He answers with a coy grin. A batting of lashes, come-hither eyes, and suddenly you wonder how many others he's been with, for he’s clearly no unskilled innocent. How many others he’s worshipped with his tongue; the people he’s fucked and taken and screwed and
When he was twenty two he learnt that it was okay to be happy in a world which was broken. Happiness didn't mean someone, or everything, was better. More that they had clutched at a bright spark in a sea of darkness and held on. The sharp sting of pain, the hypnotic crimson of blood - they were fundamental to the contentment that he now felt; fundamental to his happiness. He learnt there was only so far one could repent, before it was time to move on.
"Better," the voice concedes, and Harry remembers with a jolt that although he cannot see more than the light-speckled black veiling his eyes, the other man can. "The sooner you learn your place for the night, the sooner we can begin to play." He sounds like a cat stalking his prey, this other man, addictive and heady, toying with Harry before going for the kill. He can feel the air move around him, the electric caress of another body stood just out of range. If he reached out a hand, it would connect with the others.
It was painless the first time it happened, forgive me for wondering if the second will be the same. At the heart of it all, I'm selfish, Draco; this is the only guarantee I’ll get what I need.
Draco’s lips twitch, the smile he manages to eventually produce so destitute it near ruins Harry. “I can’t answer what I don’t know, Potter” he replies softly. “No one’s promised the end of day.”
Then there’s Draco. The boy who had not exposed him, nor readily acquiesced to a desperate tyrant, drunk on fictions putrid and sweet - willingly naive for an illusory ending.  Instead, he’d walked away. A boy, who, in the end, had been
Yet the illusion holds. The figure walks closer, platinum hair a halo against the obsidian sky. Their face is cast to the ground, stride heavy and forlorn, betraying none of the grace Harry knows it can hold. Feels, on some primal, base level. He’s almost certain it’s Draco. The rival from school. The shadow on the street. The flicker that haunts his nights.
Harry knows this exterior as an old friend. Has walked the path of pale stone too many times to count, the crunch of pebble underfoot now synonymous with the crack of a cane, the hiss and rub of rope, the smell of sweat and blood and cum, this anonymous stage for base needs and primal instinct.
I'm in your room; on your bed, and it smells of you, wrapping me in an embrace which, if I close my eyes, lets me pretend you're here with me. A stolen, forbidden moment, that's all I got, when my lips met yours.
- utterly charming when sporting feathers of cyan, navy and teal, and he'd only charmed the bird in the first place due to its reluctance in preforming it's fucking job and returning Harry's questionnaire response. Apparently, Iniquity takes no chances, however, with their avians. Once owl two -
Harry jolts, or thinks he does; there's the sound of scrambled purchase against wooden floors. He doesn't have time to acclimatise to the sudden onset of sound, however, before another crack of leather slices past his other ear, close enough this time he can smell the worn musk it leaves in its wake. Harry gulps in a breath, his inhale sharp in the otherwise quiet of the room; hears the jagged pant of his breathing, the slight rasp at the end. How long has he been like this, vocal for his companion yet deaf upon his own ears? What else has his body betrayed whilst locked in a cage of nothing? The thought warms his cheeks. He can only guess how he appears to faux-Draco, gasping and moaning and whimpering and fuck knows what else from the smallest of olive-branches the man proffers. Harry hasn't even been touched, yet he's already at the point of begging. For what, he's not sure.
scratched chicken-hand into the porcelain under the sink. Found one day in a fit of cleaning, and pondered for many more, he still doesn't know exactly who they stand for. Who made them. Why they’d hide it. Menace whispers in the confines of this room, a nefarious ooze of
“Draco” Harry sighs in way of greeting, relief evident in his voice. To say he hadn’t been worried would be to lie. Multiple times he’d convinced himself Draco had been nothing more than a dream. Or, worse, a once-off. Unwilling to meet again. He turns to the man who occupies his every waking moment, and intrudes upon his slumber. Draco’s face is the colour of bone, cast in shadow and unreadable, gaze averted to an invisible horizon.
His body trembled, hands clenched in a futile attempt to control the storm of emotions threatening to seize his body.
Harry's lamenting lulls him, heat from the fire calling his subconscious down the twisted paths of abstract thought. When did he become so jaded? At what point had Harry decided they were close enough to warrant unannounced visits at 11 pm on a Thursday evening? If Magnus could be bothered warping time to erase that particular moment?
Harry Potter: dirty and grimy, who stunk as bad as Draco did, looking and sounding like he was dead inside.
The black moon sends anamorphic light dancing across your naked flesh, the eerie glow washing out already ashy skin, distorting the jutting planes of your body. In contrast, he's shrouded in caliginosity, eyes dark and unreadable as they map up your arms, over your chest, down the line of pale hair that runs from navel to groin. They linger there, your cock jerking as his eyes seem to burn through your slacks. Hunger undeniable, as he steps forward out of the shadow revealing pants taut and straining.
in the body as familiar as your own. You tilt your hips up, stifling your own grunt as you inch impossibly deeper into intoxicating
? He thought of Harry, of the lust in his eyes, and the other emotion, the one filled with promise, and trust, which Draco now understood as Harry’s own fucked up version of
Mind drifting whilst feet instinctively trudge the familiar streets, it comes as a shock when Ron and Hermione’s house looms before him  A millennium since he has walked the path intentionally, yet his body knows this journey as well as it knows the one to his own home.
Harry jumps, dropping his thankfully-yet-not-surprisingly-empty tumbler (although Magnus still winces as crystal meets carpet), and whips his head around comically. Draco's standing in the doorway, elbow supported casually against the frame, a smirk playing on his lips. To be fair, Magnus can see the attraction: fair hair framing fair skin, sharp lines of his body highlighted by skintight pants and a vest Magnus would swear were dragonhide.
"I can't believe you're asking this of me," he gripes dramatically. "But fine, you've twisted my arm. If only so I can free up my nights for young men not bestottled with blonde hair."
"Of course he did," Draco answers, interrupting whatever denials were on Magnus' tongue. "Any self-respecting warlock would. And I was sent by Blaise to retrieve the sweater he left." He holds up an olive cashmere jersey; Magnus suddenly finds the top of Chairman Meow's head very interesting. He can feel the smugness radiating from Harry's direction. "So, Potter," Draco near-purrs, his change in tone startling both Magnus and Harry, if the latter's jump is anything to go by. He drops Blaise's sweater and stalks forward, demeanour cat-like, a suggestion of sway to his hips. "What was this I heard about you, gothic renaissance, and fabulous Raven hats?"
Harry’s not; it hurts to think back to a time when he was. The last time. The Forest of Dean, perhaps, the Golden Trio against the world. Fatigued bodies, weary minds, perpetual fear - of failure, of what was behind them. What was coming for them. Of
it, when you decided to bust out of the Manor. Then, my father refused to get another, and once he had disinherited me, I didn't have the means to replace it.”
Draco needed to get home. Or, to the pathetic pile of blankets which offered the only sort of solace within his pitiable excuse for an existence. Panting, he pulled himself to his hands and knees, his aching body protesting from the beating it had just taken. Beaten. That was the word he would use, and not just from that man; he was an abandoned carcass left to rot, ostracized from not only the wizarding world,  but shunned by muggles as well. No matter where he went, he would never be more than the disgraced Malfoy heir, abhorred by his once-acquaintances, eschewed by old contacts and desecrated by the very people on which he relied to survive.
“Teddy, yep.” Neville nodded. “His hair’s been blue for a while now, but when he was younger it was always purple.”
EVERYTHING GETS MORE FUN AFTER THIS I PROMISE, but sometimes we need these downs to build ourselves back up!
His stomach tightened. While he might have seen Ron more recently than he would have preferred (He had made the mistake of popping by Pansy’s flat once, right as they were dropping off the children for babysitting) he hadn’t seen much else of his graduating class. What if he ran into someone who still hated him? Or who had lost someone in the war?
Neville stopped every few feet to direct people towards the cake stand. “Yeah. Harry’s been helping Andy since he got out of Auror training, and after a while I started to help, too.”
“Third year,” Potter said again, and Draco thought he could smell mint and something sweet, like honey.
Below the hanging streamers were what must have been at least a hundred partygoers. Following Neville through the crowd, Draco saw no less than ten heads topped with copper hair and wondered for a brief moment if Gin and Pansy were in attendance. He also noticed Ron, full plate in hand, a sauce-shaped mustache staining his face. His wife, Hermione, was only steps behind, holding hands with their youngest.
When they had first started playing, Harry had found the waiting to be the hardest part. He was a man of action, jumping into situations without thinking. Now, though, he relished the silence, the calm before the storm. The way his Master’s eyes felt trailing over his flesh, deciding which part to explore first.
Neville continued to show Draco multiple ways to safeword if someone couldn’t be vocal; whether they were gagged, or under a speech restriction, or any other element that might hinder sound, a secondary hand motion or signal could be exhibited to end the scene.
“Not true,” Potter spat back as their surroundings became filled with wet witches and wizards scrambling for cover.
“Send Neville my love, will you?” She said with a smile, before Draco drifted through the Floo and back to his own flat.
She looked so much like Aunt Bella that Draco would have sworn he saw a ghost. As he weaved his way through the masses of people, however, he started to notice the differences: her hair was lighter, more brown than black, her curls loose rather than tight and springy. It was her face where Draco noticed it most of all. Her curious brown eyes were so strikingly different from the horrid black scowl he was used to seeing. As soon as they connected with Draco, her entire face lit up, a smile spreading from cheek to cheek.
He had to admit she was right. Even now, flying was still so exhilarating, but it was partly because of the underlying fear, kicking off the mound, feeling your lungs tighten as your body began to rise.
“No, I— I really have to go. Previous plans.” Draco said through gritted teeth. “Owl me, Potter. If you want,” he added, hopefully. “I’d, uh, love to hear about that train.”
But that was it, the only reminder of the war. The castle looked fine, every stone tucked back into place, every torch happily lit. It was as if nothing happened.
His husband’s eyes were still focused on the floor, but Harry could see a faint flush begin to colour his cheeks. It encouraged him to continue. “The lace, the perfect green bow, would rest right at the top of your thigh, so milky white against the black lace, and you’d look so utterly delicious.” He palmed his swollen cock. “I’d take you just like that and throw you onto the bed, kiss every inch of fishnet I could.”
“You and your lion pack,” Draco sighed from the other end of the line. “Never could leave each other alone.”
His Master withdrew his fingers and ran them lightly up and down Harry’s thighs. “Perfect, perfect Potter,” he praised, before casting a Cleansing Charm on his hands.
A big disclaimer here: the chapter above is a failed scene. Lots of things go wrong. Safe words are used. Please proceed with caution.
So he had washed himself, scrubbing his own potion into his locks and tried not to imagine what the boy next to him was doing. What he was wiping off of his own chest, maybe with his fingers, maybe bringing each one to his lips to lick them clean before letting the runnels of water wipe off the remnants of desire.
“Communication is important, of course, but having some insight into both your partner and yourself will help make your play even more impactful.” Neville glanced across the five students crowded around him. “Let’s try an example, shall we? Consider it a warm up.”
“That bad, hmm?” Pansy pulled two tumblers out of her cupboard before pouring a finger of scotch and a splash of water into both. She handed one to Draco, and took a seat next to him at the table. “Talk to me. Parents?”
Pansy looked at Draco, surprised. “She’s spanked me, flogged me, sent me into such a deep Subspace it took almost thirty minutes for me to come back to her, but I wouldn’t call that ‘hitting.’”
That Harry was gripping him as sturdy and strong as he would the tip of his broom. That he was licking his lips and looking intensely at Draco as he pulled upward along his needy length.
my voice into the mic, and everyone with a Wireless can hear me?” Harry had asked incredulously just three months before. Of course he had a vague idea of how the Wizarding Wireless Network ran, but when Lee had contacted him out of the blue to run his own show, Harry was rightfully confused.
“And that’s all the time we have today thanks for joining tune in next time, bye!” Harry rushed his exit before hissing into the mic. “What the fuck is wrong with you? I was being nice!”
“The other day at the, erm, club...you said the second task, the lake, was the first time you noticed me. During Fourth.”
“When I came out, she asked me to do what every other Parkinson before me had done; keep my bitch out of my marital bed. She still expected me to marry, to breed, to produce more purebloods, to deny my truth.”
He heard the pulse of the shower turn off, the sound of cotton dragging over wet skin. The sound of a shower curtain being yanked backward as Harry made his way to the sinks.
“Let’s go,” Draco said, his voice low as if not to carry, even though the bar was so loud he’d have to scream to be heard.
“Would you let me help you?” Harry tilted his head so his lips rested right against the sensitive tendons in Draco’s neck. “Thread the ribbon through each hook and knot it so securely right...here?” He grazed the small of Draco’s back with his knuckles and felt him shiver.
“You play beautifully,” Harry said, wincing as he heard the words leave his mouth. “I mean, you’re way better than you were in school.”
He didn’t even try to hide back his laughter. “Glad I never took up the saxophone, eh?” Harry continued. “We have a special guest in studio with us today! Everyone give it up for this week’s star Quidditch seeker, Draco Malfoy, who not only absolutely eviscerated the Kenmare Kestrels, but also broke a decade-long record by catching the Snitch in only five minutes!”
He tried to stare Draco down, tried to get him to answer the question that hung in the air, but Draco kept averting his eyes. Finally, Harry had to verbally say what he wanted. “Where are they, Draco?”
Neville continued to pump his hips, sliding his length in and out of Theo’s mouth so slowly and reverently, his hands squeezing Theo’s in syncopation. Theo’s eyes were closed, his lashes fluttering as he was reduced to just taking, swallowing down what he could, at Neville’s mercy.
The slick slap of Neville burying himself into Theo’s hole filled Draco’s ears as he imagined filling Potter’s hole, ramming himself into that wet heat over and over, being the reason Potter was crying out his name in pleasure.
Harry’s cock was aching, thinking of Draco all dolled up underneath his clothes. He found his way to Draco’s backside, aligning his chest along Draco’s spine, and pressed him into the edge of the table. Nipping at Draco’s ear, he said, “Wearing stockings makes you feel pretty?”
“Sounds like drunk you,” Potter answered, before letting his gaze leave the crumpled parchment to drag down the half-naked body in front of him. “You don’t look drunk now, though.”
“Like heaven,” Pansy grinned. “Sometimes, like hell, too, but it’s what I crave. It’s what I need, and after, when Ginny’s holding me...” she trailed off with a soft smile. “I’ve never felt so safe.”
He saw something flicker across Draco’s face before the stone mask that he so often wore at work and around the Ministry took over. “I-” Draco started, before busying himself with more silverware. “I do not know what you are talking about, Harry. It’s nowhere near Christmas.”
It felt softer than he had expected. The skin surrounding the lightning bolt felt so soft instead of calloused, like the edges of his own scars inflicted by Sectumsempra. It made something in him snap; a bitterness that he hadn’t expected, knowing that Potter’s branding was even better than Draco’s own.
Draco started to panic. He knew he had two choices; either stay like a coward in the shower stall until Potter left, or pull his towel back around his waist and strut out like he hadn’t a care in the world.
“Really?” Potter raised an eyebrow, before adjusting the parchment to eye level. “Let’s read it out loud, shall we?”
Draco watched, wide-eyed, as Neville’s cock filled Theo’s open, hungry mouth. His fingers dug into the soft skin of Theo’s forearms when he leaned forward, pushing himself farther and farther down Theo’s throat. At first he thought the motion was to hold Theo immobile while he was forced to take it, but then Draco noticed Theo’s hands.
“And what would that be?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows as Teddy scurried away after Luna and Rolf.
that control. And he couldn’t ask Potter to give up his own control, to force him into an arrangement he didn’t want, didn’t need.
“What if I’m already hard?” Harry shifted in his seat, pressing his hips up so that Malfoy could feel just what his words were doing to him.
Wasn’t that the rub. Doing everything you could to please others, and still falling short. Still finding, at the end of the day, that you’re a failure.
“No demands,” Draco shook his head vigorously. “No orders or stipulations. I am providing an option to salvage our evening or to end it. The choice is yours.”
He thought about Theo, the metal chain that was twisted to add pressure to his throat, that was tugged to guide him to new positions. His mind easily slipped to Potter in the tub, but this time his hands weren’t just gripping the edge. They were knotted there with silky green ribbon, twisting up from his wrists to clutch along the muscles in his biceps, holding him still, holding him steady.
Draco's trying to overcome some deep-rooted thinking, so there's a bit of a shaming vibe. Please note that Draco is working on it!
Despite Draco’s several recent visits to the club, he had yet to see anything close to penetrative sex. He knew the mechanics, of course, but had only tentatively stroked his own opening. Which he was unable to see, unless he had magicked some mirrors. That thought hadn’t occurred to him until he was staring at his friend’s puckered entrance.
Harry shuddered at the praise and focused on staying still, staying silent until his next command. Finally, he could hear the distinct tapping of his Master’s hand on his leg.
Malfoy paused, before giving him a quick nod. “Suppose it wouldn’t hurt. My next match is Thursday, so...Tuesday night? Would that work?”
But he couldn’t do any of that. Not just because they were in public, at a children’s zoo where his cousin was who knows where, but because Potter didn’t want that. He had left the club. He had left the lifestyle that Draco found to be his anchor.
“Yes, Sir,” he responded after a beat, and Draco couldn’t help but draw in a breath. Seeing the reaction, hearing the tone, how different it sounded from the Theo he’d seen so many years ago. This Theo, even though he was grovelling on the floor, sounded stronger. He sounded
“Actually, name’s Harry Potter,” Harry said, before giving Draco a small chuckle and flying back towards the ground. Draco watched, stuck in the air, as Potter walked back to the castle, broom in one hand, and his snitch in the other.
“Not Ron, no, no one is coming.” Harry took a deep breath, and forced himself to speak slowly. “Where...are the stockings?”
Harry checked the next morning, both confused and surprised to see the stockings still in their hiding place in the back of the drawer, untouched as far as he knew.
“Do I look pretty?” Draco asked, his voice still tempered with nerves. He arched his spine, accentuating the long lines of his body, and Harry couldn’t wait any longer.
There were perks to running his own Wireless show, after all. And one of those perks was messing with his old nemesis.
The stockings weren’t in the drawer; they weren’t in the next drawer below, or behind the dresser, or under the bed or in the wardrobe. They weren’t in the bathroom cabinet or between the cushions of the couch or in the spice drawer. And they certainly weren’t in the bookshelf or shoved between his Order of Merlin, First Class award and Draco’s Lead Master of Potions Certificate.
“Oh, perfect timing, love.” Neville grinned widely. “Everyone, this is my partner, Theodore Nott. He’s going to be helping me with today’s lesson.”
“Thank you.” Neville squeezed his shoulder one more time, and then relocated his hand to the base of Theo’s neck. Draco watched as he rubbed tiny circles into his nape as he continued to address the room.
Neville shook his head. “That’s true, but you were also sending Harry into subspace in the middle of a crowded classroom.”
“So what did you think? Did Neville give you the checklist for you to highlight what you want?" Pansy grinned. "I had a lot of fun filling that one out."
Instead, he pressed his chest into Potter’s own. He knew Potter wouldn’t move, wouldn’t back down from a threat, not when it was Draco Malfoy trying to force him into a corner. He wasn’t scared, no. Potter was never scared.
He could feel his magic burning under his skin, ready to ignite with the tiniest of sparks. Draco stood, angry that the feeling had returned, angry that he was facing his demons yet again. He rushed to the exit, but Neville got to the door before he could.
“Yes, Sir,” Theo answered automatically. Neville let out a little groan at that, his smile broad and confident as it stretched across his face.
A big thank you to everyone who is continuing on this journey! We have ten chapters to go, and I'm so excited for the wonderful stories that are yet to come.
Draco thought back to the night before, to the room through the looking glass. “I wouldn’t call a fully strapped Dominant beating the shit out of some redhead no one.”
Draco began to tug at his own length in time with Theo, imagining what it would feel like if someone was moving like that on his own length, slipping in and out of warmth and tightness, using his cock to chase their own pleasure.
But it didn’t feel anything like usual. Draco couldn’t recognize the familiar touch of his own slender fingers as they wrapped around his cock. He couldn’t feel the twist of his wrist as it pulled along his length.
Draco tried to instantly divert. “So, you’re my cousin’s godfather.” Not the most subtle transition.
Thank you all for your patience while I finish out the rest of this story! I really appreciate all of you for reading along, and for enjoying it as much as I've enjoyed writing! Thank you all for your kind words.
“Besides, your lists may change as you immerse yourself deeper into this lifestyle and you push your limits and boundaries.”
His walk to the office was short; he lived right above Weasleys Wizard Wheezes, in a smart flat with a tiny window that faced Carkitt Market, so his walk to Slug & Jiggers was barely five minutes. He could apparate, sure, but he enjoyed feeling the crisp morning air on his face before he was confined to a stuffy room with only bubbling potions to keep him company.
“Words, bear,” Neville said, and Draco heard the difference; Neville was commanding him, his voice stern and direct as it filled the room.
“Wait!” Harry reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s wrist, but he just glared at him before tugging himself out of Harry’s grasp. “I- I don’t know what you like in bed!” Harry yelled in a pathetic last attempt.
A younger Harry would have instantly assumed that these were from a past lover, one whose memory had somehow infiltrated their home. A jealous rage and an angry floo call would have followed, leading to accusations that were unfounded and unjust.
He rolled his hips again, letting Draco know just how much the thought of helping him look pretty was turning him on. Dragging his fingers to either side of Draco’s slender hips, Harry gripped him there before running his palms down Draco’s legs.
Notes about this chapter: spanking is involved, also mentions of spousal physical abuse (slapping across ones face) and family abuse, Draco remembers some unpleasant family memories and has to recover from that.
“Knowing my Theo Bear’s background allows me to understand him better,” Neville continued, giving Theo’s shoulder another squeeze. “For instance, I do not punish my boy in the traditional BDSM sense. Instead, we talk about his naughty behaviour, which leads to better communication between the two of us.”
“Myself!” Draco said. “Sometimes, when I’m feeling…” he threw his hand up in the air and flicked his wrist, “you know, a bit podgy or pale or...old...” Draco made a face of disgust. “I like to wear something that makes me feel pretty.”
He woke, sudden and hard the next morning, resentful of the boys around him snoring and breathing, at peace, without the images of Potter covered in sticky substances running through their minds.
Yes, Draco nodded to himself as he combed his hair in front of his gold-encrusted mirror. Things were going great.
“Harry! Draco! There you are!” Teddy came bursting through the exhibit with Luna and Rolf on his heels. “You’ll never believe what I saw!”
“My dear Draco!” she called, extending her hands out in his direction. “Neville owled to say you might be popping by, but I didn’t want to get my hopes up.” Her eyes watered as she looked Draco up and down. “So tall! And so handsome. My, you look just like Narcissa.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. At least Draco was admitting the existence of said stockings. “I know,” he answered. “I looked everywhere.”
“Yes, fuck, please,” Harry cried. Every touch, every sensation was spreading over him like wildfire, so strong he could barely breathe, but he also felt more alive than ever.
He wished he was in his stark black robes with his slicked-back hair, and not mostly naked with tousled locks and bare feet. It was so much easier to feel confident and sure when he looked the part. Instead, he threw on his snidest smile, rolled his eyes, and responded.
“You do not have to apologise.” Neville looked deep into his eyes. “We all have faults, and we all have greatness. This is what makes us who we are.”
Eighth year had started like any other; the train picked them up at Kings Cross at the same platform, all of the students wearing black robes and pushing their carts and carrying their pets. The train wound its way through the mountains and over the rivers and finally made its destination. The castle lit up the sky as the first-years got on boats and the rest of the classes got into their Thestral-drawn carriages.
. It made something in Draco pulse with need, the urge to push Potter to the ground throbbing beneath his skin.
“Not yet.” Draco paused before releasing his grip. “If only we had...oh gosh, what’s it called again? Oh, right. Magic.”
Harry heard his Master sit in the wooden chair right behind him. Harry could practically picture him there, trousered legs spread, a crisp white shirt bound tightly across his chest, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. All held together by thin, black suspenders for Harry to grip or hook himself onto.
Neville situated himself between Theo’s open thighs and kissed the nape of his neck, the knot between his shoulders. He worked his way down Theo’s spine, whispering words that Draco couldn’t decipher in between his kisses. He wasn’t even sure Theo could hear them; his eyes were closed, relaxed, almost as if he were asleep and not about to have intercourse with a bloody Gryffindor.
Draco had never considered himself lucky. Lucky people don’t end up with the Mark on their arm, and scars etched across their chest, and carry a name like Malfoy. So he certainly wouldn’t be lucky enough to find what Neville and Theo had.
“Guess we have to kiss now,” he smirked, so close to Draco that he could smell treacle tart on his breath.
Suddenly, he heard the tap turn off, and quickly packed all of the clothing back into the drawer, slamming it shut as soon as Draco entered the room.
The next chap gets worse, but it all gets better in the end! I wrote it this way, because I really feel like sometimes we jump into things we're not prepared for. We rush, because we think we know enough, that we can handle it, and we make mistakes. Some of those mistakes can really mess with us. Luckily (spoiler) Draco and Harry find their way through it, but please note the next two chaps are not...best play practices. If you want to skip chap 22-23, please feel free. Chap 24 & 25 are in good form.
Draco had followed Potter into the showers, mumbling about studying the next night, no time for parties, but he couldn’t look away from the long expanse of skin above Potter’s knotted towel, the glisten of spunk splattered across his tanned and toned skin. He watched as Potter wandered into the closest shower stall, throwing a wink back at Draco before pulling the curtain taut.
Draco snorts. It is an undignified noise, something Harry couldn't imagine the Draco of Hogwarts emitting. But they aren't the children they were at school, are they? Harry's existence is proof of that. Even more so is the fact he’s standing here with Draco under the anamorphic light of a waning moon, and Draco isn't running. Isn't throwing curses.
Kreacher’s door. He stops with a fond smile. A linen cupboard-turned house elf abode he doesn't dare invade. Kreacher's the one constant in his life, the only constant he doesn't resent. Guiltily, the mess he left in the kitchen comes to mind, before he decides the decrepit elf will probably relish a change in routine, and leaves it be.
"No poems," Harry says, choked, what feels like hours later. His face is bright red, unable to meet Magnus' arched look, and he's muttering something that sounds an awful lot like 'his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad'.
Harry's staring at him. "I'm not sure they are, Magnus," he says. "Unless you're hanging out with some very strange youth."
He seems to realise this; takes in the close bodies and the air of menace. Indecision wars across his face, twisting his features, until he ostensibly makes a decision and clasps a sure hand over your forearm.
“You can't. No one can.” The first words Draco had spoken since Harry had pulled his malfunctioning body down the Manor path, apparating them back to Grimmauld Place.
"Reckon you'll survive, though it wouldn't be a loss if you just gave up and fucking died. Better think about who you run that mouth to next time, you little faggot." The man spat at Draco before turning and leaving, his hands thrust deep within his jacket pockets.
She missed a fair amount. I'm wearing one of your sweaters as I write, the soft brown one. Your first, acceptance into the family. I’m choosing to believe it was left by accident. You say Molly’s a second mother to you; don’t make me tell her she’s lost another son.
"Have you been good for me, pet?" the man murmurs in Harry's ear, voice like sex and velvet and all things wanton. Harry can only whimper, high and needy, beautifully depraved and yet disgustingly pathetic; how he's fallen to such levels with mere sound, taste, smell. The stranger laughs lowly, Draco's laugh in Harry's mind. "Look at you squirm. You've been enjoying my game, it seems," he continues, "although for someone chained as you are, you manage to writhe rather delightfully." Harry hears something he can only describe as a licentious purr shudder from his own lips, and the man laughs again. "Utterly shameless, aren't you? I bet I could make you come from nothing other than my voice if I so desired to see you blow your load inside your pants." Another broken groan, the sound of a button pulled through denim, the rasp of fabric moved over bare skin. When faux-Draco speaks again, it's with a tinge of amusement. "It appears I should probably stop talking."
“Two weeks,” Draco repeats. He’s walking away already, managing to merge into the rising dawn despite black robes. Harry wonders, as Draco disappears the same way he did previously, why he doesn’t simply apparate?
Harry moved, and abruptly Draco was pulled into a soft lap, Harry’s arms winding around him to hold him tight against his chest. Draco stiffened briefly before yielding to the embrace, his head coming to nestle in the warm crook of Harry’s shoulder while he was rocked as one might an upset baby. He breathed in the now-familiar scent of Harry, letting the heat which permeated the worn cotton of Potter’s shirt soothe him and dry his tears.
“It was after Father had cast me out. I was moving from shelter to shelter in muggle London” Draco relented with a sigh. “I had pissed off the wrong sorts - the muggle gangs that ran the streets - so I couldn't stay in the same place for long. The night they came, I had just found a new shelter.” A sad smile crossed his face. “They had soup to eat, and I remember thinking I hadn't eaten anything that delicious, ever. Hunger will do that to you.”
To be beaten and bruised. Degraded, destroyed, rejuvenated. Flung into euphoria over and over, a high that lulled the harsh bite of the cane into a soothing caress. A trance that offered escapement; the fogged mind of abandonment. The care that came after the blows had rained down, heady needs fulfilled.
You hold him like that, his gaze locked to yours, unrelenting, primal, base, even as you continue to fuck him in a way you’re sure will leave bruises on him and yourself unable to walk. Hold him like that, even as you struggle to hold
Draco nods slowly. “If I can, I will.” He pulls himself from Harry’s grasp and starts back the way he came. In what feels like seconds he’s lost to the torrent of rain. Before long, Harry is once again alone in the night.
"That's the question we're all asking, isn't it. Where was the tipping edge? What was the point of no return? When was the drop? Because by the time I knew I'd passed it, there was no going back." Potter was crazy. Harry Potter was sitting on his blankets, having some sort of philosophical conversation with him, and Draco could hardly stand upright.
You tilt your hips up, urging him deeper, faster, his face buried between two pale, rounded globes, your insistent hands in his hair insurance that he doesn’t stop. Somewhere along the way, in between garbled pleas and breathy grunts, you realise that it’s him; the Wizarding World’s fucking
Harry paused. Leant forward. Green to grey; it had always been green to grey, even when it shouldn't have been. Breath hot, lips stilled millimetres from his.
Please don't be alarmed when you see me. I'm sure the wounds would have healed by then, although Pansy seems to think they’ll linger. For now, they help keep the image of you clear; your memory tethers me until the time where reality can.
“Draco.” Harry's voice had changed, the name coming out husky, warm. Needy. Lust now burned hot across his features, intertwined with something else, flanked by something equally primordial. “Draco” he said, and it was almost a purr. “Cut me.”
"It's a distance thing, darling." Magnus stretches, the hand not holding his whisky reaching to scratch a relocated yet still put-out Chairman Meow behind the ears. "Easier to keep you at arm's length. Lord only knows the horrors which would occur if you were aware of his true feelings. Spiteful, really. I'd love to have my living room back."
- has established Harry's opening of the Very Important Post, it hoots, daintily dislodges the Obscurity Mask™ from its beak, and, for all sense and purposes, absolutely gaps the fuck out of Harry's bedroom, the location where it had arrived unannounced only several minutes prior.
You can't promise me forever, then leave after only seven. I know it wasn't your choice, but this is mine.
You pull back slightly, gulp a breath, try to take a moment. But his tongue traces along your jaw before he moves to your neck, sucking pale skin until blood blossoms diligently under his advances, and you're lost again.
The smell of magic, near electric, burning acrid through his sinus' in this new heightened state of awareness. The room itself, the hint of dust and residue of cleaning charms, an underlying caress of floral and clean linens. The promise of
"Who sent you?" Draco asked. He didn't know how he had been found, or by which gang, but he had been unable to pay their territory costs, so now he would pay with his life. He found that he couldn't bring himself to care much.
Draco bows his head slowly in agreement, the shift in shadow throwing his cheek into relief and highlighting sickly, discoloured bruises. He realises his mistake as it happens, jerking his face back into gloom. Too late, however; Harry had already seen. How could he
"Eves uncle, what have I done?" Magnus mutters. The boy - young adult, whatever the fuck you called a 23-year-old puddle of hormones, love, and misplaced emotional vulnerability who spent far too much time on Mangus' sofa drinking premium spirits - is still gaping at him like a fish. A bewildered, slightly inebriated fish. "Close your mouth. You look like a stunned mullet," he says, enjoying the look of confusion that accompanies Harry's compliance.
So when with a low growl he tugs your jocks down and engulfs your aching cock in one go, you lose it. Hips buck, hands fist in the sheets. A hiss which distorts into a cry when you feel his tongue tracing the underside vein before delving into your slit echoes through the room, leaving no doubt to the sincerity of your pleasure
The teachers had trouble making eye contact with the three of them as well. Only McGonagall seemed to stomach it, giving Draco a half-smile before giving them new room assignments.
Theo nodded once, and then sat back on his heels, his hands unclasping behind his back until his palms rested flat on his thighs. His stare remained focused on the floor throughout, and Draco cocked his head, wondering if that was a requirement of a Submissive.
“Now?” Draco panicked. He hadn’t kissed anyone since, well since Pansy and that was four years ago and this was Potter and he was so...and Draco was-
With a gulp, Draco admitted to himself, and said out loud, “I’d like to learn more about impact play.”
I really wanted to show the idea that a dom does not have to be 'on' all of the time. That we have a separation from everyday life, and sometimes that separation can be shown by just calling someone a different name, or wearing different clothes, or putting your hair up in a different way. Just like a submissive, a dom needs the chance to step into the right headspace.
“You’ve got it all wrong, you git,” Potter said, and Draco couldn’t help but look at his face. He had expected bewilderment, or even anger. The smile stretched across his face took Draco completely by surprise.
I'm also posting this on Sunday so I can post chapter 24 tomorrow. That way this chap isn't floating out there for too long without its conclusion.
Even twenty years after they left Hogwarts, Draco and Harry could be seen playing pick-up games of Quidditch, chasing the Snitch, and snogging in the fields. He was grateful for every moment that led to that year, no matter how horrible, because it brought them together.
The fingers inside of him sped up, plunging in and out of his tight entrance as they teased him closer and closer to the edge. Harry could only whine, crying out in desperation, hoping he could hold out until he heard
It might not be possible, but Draco pushed those depressing thoughts out of his mind and focused on Neville’s teachings.
“Gorgeous,” Sir growled as he scraped his fingernails across Harry’s sensitive arse cheeks, sending ripples of sensation and pleasure throughout his entire body. His arse flexed, wanting to buck back into his Master’s touch, but he couldn’t. Harry focused on staying still as Sir continued to caress his heated skin.
“What?” Draco whispered, telling himself it was just to hear Potter’s question and not to feel the heat of him against his skin one more time.
His hands were moving on instinct, Draco’s mind only focused on the sounds of spraying water and Harry’s voice, guttural, desperate. What would he do if he knew Draco was there, so close and desperate as well, as one hand tugged rapidly around his need, the other one finding its way to his bollocks, palming them in a fierce grip.
Finally, his Tempus slipped one arm past five, and he was able to hang his dragonhide gloves on the hook for the day. He quickly switched into more casual clothes, a grey jumper and softly pleated trousers before heading across the alley to the Leaky. It had become a bit of a tradition to share a pint with Pansy before she trouped off to her variety of lovers and Draco slunk back to his flat, empty except for his owl and the occasional dust bunny.
“So how was the club?” Pansy asked, settling herself on the other end of the couch. The chair next to her was covered in layers of cloth, several sewing needles weaving in and out as they combined different colours of silk to tulle.
Potter shrugged. “McGonagall let Neville and I choose as a reward for putting the castle back together this summer.”
“Yes, oh goodness, yes.” She gave his hands a squeeze. “I can see her in your eyes. And your skin! I was always jealous of Cissy’s porcelain skin. Do tell her I say hello, won’t you?”
Draco’s toes curled and his cock throbbed in his still-clenched palm when he watched how easy it was for Neville to slide into his partner. He had always thought it must be painful, tight and raw, but Neville had prepared Theo, made his entrance so damn wet that Theo had taken his thick cock with ease.
“Because I’m fucking freezing?” Pansy spat out before she began to giggle. “I thought it was some sort of warming potion. And besides, you don’t always tie me up,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes.
“Great question, Melody. And, class, feel free to ask questions as we go,” Neville nodded towards the girl and gave her a warm smile. “Positions, names, collars or even wardrobe can be important to set the scene. Not everyone wants to be a Submissive at all times. So getting into the mindset can be imperative. Simple commands that are practiced and structured can provide an easy path toward entering the right headspace.”
“Oh, that’s easy,” Theo said. “I’m very good to him.” He threw Neville a wink. “In fact, if you come to the club later tonight, we’ll give you a show.” He winked at Draco as well.
“Her threats are not unfounded,” Draco smiled in response before outlining his ensemble requests. Less than two hours later, he found himself fully outfitted with crisp black trousers, a broadcloth white sleeve shirt, and a six-buttoned tailored black vest that not only accentuated his slim hips but also highlighted his stern collarbone.
“Think you can redeem yourself for your slip-up last week by pretending to be kind, do you?” Malfoy continued, barely pausing. “I played a shite game and everyone knows it! Coach benched me for the next two weeks, and I don’t need you fucking with my head in the meantime!”
“If you insist.” Potter smiled before wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him into a toe-curling kiss.
“Oh, like you’ve got anything better, Malfoy,” Potter snapped, his green eyes piercing into Draco’s own.
“I don’t know if it’s as his date, or as a friend, or Teddy’s cousin, or just to torment him on a Sunday afternoon.”
He woke up hard and shaking. At some point during the night, he must have shucked his joggers, choosing instead to passively pull his cock out from their cotton confines and into the silk of his palm. His hand was already tugging along his length, and, dropping his head back into the safety of his pillows, Draco muttered a spell to lubricate the path of pleasure.
instead of Master or Neville, and he confessed his urge to call me Daddy quickly into our relationship. So we added it to the list of preferred pronouns.” Neville looked down and ruffled a hand through Theo’s dark hair, tugging slightly on the ends when he released the strands.
“Look at you,” Neville said, taking his time to admire Theo’s newly revealed skin. His lips dropped down to Theo’s chest, mouthing at each of his nipples, his hands grabbing at his waist. He lowered Theo’s pants just barely below his arse, exposing each cheek nicely to the clear glass wall.
Despite being blindfolded, Harry closed his eyes and let his Master’s words sink in. It had taken so long for them to get to this place. To overcome their past and whittle down the snark and bite until they were left with their raw and open desires, not just for this lifestyle, but for each other.
Draco didn’t tell anyone about his run-in with Potter the previous evening. Secrets were like currency in Slytherin House, and Draco wasn’t about to let everyone know how many Galleons he was holding with that one.
Not that there were that many left. Three from Slytherin, no more than five from Hufflepuff. At least thirteen from Ravenclaw; they would return to school no matter how many years they added on. And, of course, five from Gryffindor.
“Then who the fuck are you wearing them for?” Harry felt the need to roar, but tampered his volume at the last moment.
Draco didn’t know if he could read anymore. The pathetic drolling of Drunk Draco was too much for him to relive. However, the letter dreadfully continued.
“Maybe we could go?” Potter said, his voice a little louder, as if he wanted to make sure Draco heard every syllable. “Maybe—” Potter’s eyes dropped to stare at his feet, but his lips kept moving, “Maybe on our next date?”
Draco couldn’t say much else before Neville was shoving him out the door, emptying him once again into the bland hallway. The door disappeared in a blink, and in another moment Neville was gone as well, turning in a flourish and heading back down to the training classroom.
“Tomorrow,” Draco nodded into the empty hallway before turning on his heels and walking back into the dark London air.
Draco slumped into the closest chair, trying to process that his flat was vacant of family. That his father and mother had chosen to leave in the brief time he was away, and whether they’d be returning in four more Sundays or not.
How would it feel to have that control, to be able to set his own pace and have someone open up to him like that? Would he ever feel so comfortable with someone else to ask for such a sacrifice? Or would he have to find both: someone he loved and someone that categorized themselves as a Submissive to unveil this type of beautiful relationship for himself?
“It’s okay, Draco. It’s alright to feel scared or confused.” Neville placed his hands behind his back but continued to block the door. “I want you to breathe. Three, two, one, remember?”
“Frankly, I’m a bit impressed. I wasn’t sure Harry was capable of letting himself fall, but it seems you don’t give him much of a choice.”
“Yes, Sir,” Harry said, trying not to clench in anticipation. He heard the air shift before feeling the crack of leather spread across his arse. Harry let out a groan, trying to keep his feet planted on the floor so he didn’t risk rutting greedily into his Master’s thighs.
” Harry pressed a few buttons, and thought he heard the sounds of guitars strumming the intro to the popular rock song. He turned his chair and pulled Malfoy into his lap.
“Always observant, Potter,” Draco responded curtly, trying to combat the blush that was rising to his cheeks.
His hand found its way to Potter’s hip, where it lingered, gripping the soft cotton of his thin shirt. He could feel the warm hardness of Potter’s muscles right below, his hips jutting out, seeking friction as Draco slipped his tongue into Potter’s mouth.
Neville’s hands continued to dip in and out, caressing Theo’s hardening length below the thin cotton of his pants while his other hand twisted on the chain around Theo’s neck, pulling it taut.
Draco couldn’t dwell on his own embarrassment for too long; as quickly as he had glanced around at his surroundings, Neville had pushed Theo onto the bed so his chest was pressed against the mattress and his legs were spread apart. His pants lay in a heap on the floor along with his shirt and Neville’s clothing, and despite being bared for anyone in the club to see, they both looked comfortable, warm. Safe.
Potter wasn’t in their room when he finally made it back from his classes. Instead, there was a note quilled to his door.
Draco watched with bated breath as Theo positioned himself on the bed, one knee on either side of Neville’s thighs. He watched Theo slowly lower himself down, piercing himself with every thick inch of Neville’s cock, Neville’s hands gripping his waist, keeping him steady and connected and safe.
“You fucking arse,” Harry suddenly heard in his ear, and with a grin he realised he hadn’t actually broke the connection between he and Malfoy. That poncy little voice was still whinging away on the phone.
“Oh, man,” Ron continued in between mouthfuls. “His captain, Alders, apparently hooked up with Malfoy over summer hols.” Ron paused, blessedly chewing and swallowing, before speaking again. “Guess it didn’t work out, and the prick told the whole team what Malfoy’s like in bed.”
Pansy laughed. “You’ve been spending too much time with Neville, darling. Now, finish that scotch. Bottle’s ruined now that you took a swig out of it.”
Longbottom’s owl had appeared only moments after he left the shower, flying in the open window gracefully, it’s talons gripping to the mahogany footboard at the end of Draco’s bed.
Much too soon, Harry heard the belt clamour to the concrete floor. Part of him wanted to ask for more, his backside sensitive but still itching for touch.
Neville looked down at Theo, before placing his hand on his shoulder. He gave his boy a squeeze, rubbing into his shoulders with the tips of his fingers. “Do you mind if I tell our new friends a bit about your past, baby boy?”
Potter slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth, pleading with Draco to react, to respond. His hand moved from Draco’s cheek to his hip, pulling him close to his body, and Draco couldn’t help it. He melted into the heat, into the touch, and just as he was about to relax into the moment, Potter withdrew.
, he thought as he focused on his hearing. The buzzing of the vibrator, still cupped in Neville’s hands. Neville’s own breath, heavier than usual. The barest of hums of the temperature charms running through the room.
Taking his time in the shower, Draco tried to wash the previous night off of his skin. The dirt of the club, but also what he saw, the filth, the depravity. He scrubbed his scalp harder than he ever remembered before, filling the bathroom with smells of lavender and orange, but even his favourite scents didn’t calm his nerves.
“Okay, moving on.” Harry shifted in his chair, getting closer to the mic. “This is normally when I mess with Malfoy, I know, but I think we can all agree that he played a fantastic match against the Falmouth Falcons.” Harry had enjoyed listening to the game earlier in the week, trying to ignore how his pulse quickened when Malfoy’s name was mentioned. “That last dive was outright daring, and had the wind been in his favour, he surely would have caught the Snitch.”
“I have it in my trunk,” he finally said, his voice still sounding giddy. “I’ll give it to you later, roomie.”
Then, he usually spent the rest of his air time analyzing the past few Quidditch games, giving props to his favourite players (like Wood and Ginny), and, of course, heckling those who consistently fell behind—in other words, Malfoy.
“Or I can take a hint,” Neville laughed. “Besides, I have my boy waiting for me.” He stood, and as he was passing Draco, he placed a solid hand on his shoulder. “We’re playing in room two. Glass wall if you want to take a peek.” He gave Draco a wink. “Could be helpful, if you’re curious.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco grinned, before taking his hand and lifting it over his head, pushing until his body pushed up against the rough bark of the tree. He leaned forward, finally,
He rolled his sleeves up, admiring how the pressed shirt creased at his elbows. His Mark gleamed, dark against his pale skin, and he flexed, watching how his tendons twisted and pulled.
As was Draco, frozen in place and bare as a baby. He wanted to gather up his robes and slither out of the showers, but he found he was frozen in place.
“Hey.” Neville tentatively put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “How about for the rest of the week we focus on the other Greens and Yellows on your list, and we’ll come back to that one.” He gave Draco’s shoulder a squeeze. “Would that be alright?”
Potter, Weasel and Granger, standing like some sort of fucked-up family as McGonagall separated them into their rooms. Not by house, no, but by random selection. Zabini was shoved with Longbottom and Thomas, which Draco knew he would enjoy. He’d been eye-fucking Longbottom’s bottom since they got off the train. Quite the glow-up, he admitted to himself.
Before he could overanalyze the situation, Potter was cradling Dracos neck with one hand and caressing Draco’s cheek with the other. Their lips touched, soft and tentative at first, and then harder, passionate.
Draco paid Alexsander for the plush clothing, promising to give Pansy a glowing review on his behalf, and made his way through the bricks and back into Diagon with minutes to spare.
“I’m taking him to the zoo next week. Come with me, and you can ask him all those questions yourself.” And with that, Potter ducked under Draco’s charm and was instantly soaked as he headed towards the warm house filled with his family and friends.
As they left the year, Draco and Harry found a flat in Diagon, close to Slug and Jiggers, where Draco was starting his new apprenticeship and just one apparition point away from the practice field of the Appleby Arrows.
Huge thank you to EvA-Eleanor and Malenkayacherepakha for your consistent cheering and betaing!!! All the hearts, friends!
Thank you to my incredible beta, pomponia, and terrific consistency reader, crow! I appreciate you both!
He slept. He breathed. He went to work, came home, and listened to the game on Saturdays, and saw his mother on Sundays. His life had been just fine.
Theo was also in complete pleasure as Neville licked his hole. His eyes were still closed, but his body arched backwards, his own hands reaching around to hold his cheeks apart as Neville continued to ravage him. Draco knew from some of his own experimentation how good some slight teasing around his entrance with the hard pad of his finger could feel, but he’d never thought about how it could be like that; how it could be wet.
His cock was hard. He knew it, just as easily as he knew Potter was hard, breathing hard as well, even as he continued to stand stock still in Draco’s snarl. He didn’t want to stop, didn’t want this feeling to go away. He heard Longbottom’s growl over his shoulder, a warning surely, but he wouldn’t quit.
“Does anyone else see them?” Draco asked, suddenly nervous about being judged on his greens, on his reds.
With that, Draco walked into his bedroom and threw himself across his cardigan-covered sheets, not knowing if he’d rather walk back into company or into an empty kitchen. He yanked off his button down and stepped out of his trousers, choosing instead to replace them with a comfortable cotton jersey from Hogwarts, that proudly reads
“That’s a good boy,” Neville whispered, as he threaded his fingers through Theo’s outstretched hands. “Taking Daddy’s cock so well.”
It all gets better next chapter, and the finale is THE BEST so please keep reading, but if you want to skip this one, the next chap will fill you in!
It only took a few more moments before he could hear the unmistakable panting in the next stall, the sound so close it was ringing in Draco’s ears. He sped up his wrist, driving himself as close to the edge as possible, listening, waiting for that one final gasp.
Pansy shrugged. “Ever since Fifth, it’s been either parents or Potter. Process of elimination, really.”
“If one were to invite someone else out to a children’s outing with animals and other atrocities, could that be construed as a…”
“I don’t want your girlfriend’s seconds,” was the best Draco could come up with amidst the turmoil of thoughts tumbling through his mind.
When Neville reached the base of Theo’s spine, Draco expected him to cast a preparation spell or even a lubrication spell on his fingers. Never in his wildest dreams did he expect Neville to continue on his path downwards, to dip his head in between Theo’s spread cheeks and...lick.
He blinked, then closed his eyes and slowly opened them. No, Potter was still staring. Directly at him. With his beautiful green eyes.
“Do we?” Potter said with a small smile. “You gave me your wand. You wanted me to defeat Voldemort.”
I hope you all enjoyed reading this chap as much as I enjoyed writing it! Only 6 chaps left, can you believe it? Thank you all for coming along on this ride with me!
Letter. What letter? Had he written a letter? When would he have had time to touch quill to parchment? He couldn’t remember much of the night before, but surely he’d remember correspondence, especially to his... old nemesis. It would explain the ink stains, though. And the empty perch. And the bottle of scotch that was just slightly (significantly) lower than he expected.
Thanks as always to my alpha, EvA-Eleanore and my cheerleader, Thunder of Dragons. And Dom!Daddy!Neville.
Draco dreamed that night of playing Quidditch; flying high above the Hogwarts grounds, chasing the Snitch, chasing Potter. How happy he felt, soaring through the clouds, Potter’s laugh as warm as the sunlight on his back as they played.
That was why he was bared naked in their playroom after all. He'd asked to be blindfolded. He knew by the end of the night, he would beg for release.
“It’s not like you didn’t notice me before. We were practically enemies before Sorting even happened.” Potter’s hair was curled at the nape of his neck, and Draco wondered how they’d look cured around his finger. If they’d bounce back if he tugged.
“Thanks for the letter,” Potter said quickly as they crawled into their respective beds. Draco couldn’t even mutter a response before Potter flicked off the light with some silver thing in his hand, rolled over and began to snore.
He’d never actually admitted out loud, or even to himself that his glances had favoured one gender over another. But Pansy was his best friend, and bisexual to boot. If anyone could understand, it would be her.
Neville wrapped his arms tightly around Theo’s back, and pulled him close to his chest. They lay like that for a while, Neville cradling Theo, rubbing his hands up and down his sated skin, whispering things to each other Draco couldn’t hear. Even though Draco had just seen so much of both of those men, he had to look away. Their moment was too precious, too private that Draco felt guilty watching it.
“Oh,” Pansy repeated, but didn’t follow up with any work gossip, her focus no longer on trivial things, and only on the dark-haired git, three booths in and clanking a glass with someone undoubtedly charming and attractive and
“Only that he’s a prick.” Harry scrunched up his nose. “And that he’s been torturing you all season. Is that why you haven’t been playing well?”
Whispering the password at the lamppost, Draco hurried down the stairs. “Hello, Oli!” he said to the wixen at the front.
Pansy’s laugh surprised Draco. “Seconds? Potter’s more into cock than he’s into twats. Didn’t you know?”
“What the fuck was that?” Neville gasped as soon as he led Draco into his office. He slammed the door the second Draco stepped over the threshold, blocking out the bland hallway and locking them into the cedar-walled room.
Harry clenched his arse again, trying to hold onto his Master’s finger even as it withdrew. “Yes, please, anything,” Harry babbled. He wanted, needed everything, anything, whatever he could get.
Neville shrugged noncommittally just as Theo walked towards him. A smile broke across Neville’s face as he tugged Theo into a big hug.
“Why?” Neville asked the expected question so gently, his voice full of curiosity instead of judgement. When Draco didn’t answer, he continued. “Does inflicting pain still make you feel uncomfortable?”
- maybe exerting oneself? I mean Harry already came that night (from another dom) and now he's playing again? Boy needs some better aftercare!
With his own moan, Draco came, spilling his seed as he rutted into his fist. His entire body jerked with his orgasm, flooding his senses with pleasure, but also with realisation.
He’s panting now, arse stuck out and hands splayed against the mirror, breath fogging the glass as he all but begs for your cock. Your fingers hurriedly smear pre-come down your dick, hips jerking as the touch nearly tears you apart, before shamelessly spit-covered fingers are pressing urgently into hot, clenching heat. One, quickly followed by a second, third. It’s intoxicating, perfect, a
, for you. Still would. But you've gone, and the dark that had receded temporarily in your presence is back, its ever demanding hunger even more irresistible, the compulsion to cut, to bleed, a seductive temptress.
Magnus slouches further, making himself comfortable; figures his house, his chair. And it's been an age since he's the pleasure of a good show, despite his apartment appearing to be masquerading as the headquarters for homosexual youths. Does he shed some sort of gay pheromone? He really should start charging.
- carding through Fred's hair as the other twin sucks his brother off. You can hear Fred from here. Whimpered groans dampened by the obstacle of cock, a huff of breath exhaled. It's a mesmerising sight: identical bodies stripped, uncaring of company. You watch Fred. Fred watches George. George watches you. A hedonistic cycle you'd abandon yourself to in a heartbeat, if you could ever bring yourself to leave Harry's side.
You make your way through the crowds slowly. They move for you, step aside, the stigma that surrounds you still evident even after all these years. For once you welcome it. Embrace it, because it means you get to him just that little bit faster.
To know, that it was me that pushed you away, with my obstinate need to be with you. On you. Under you. In you. And with you, in a way I had never been before. The physical longing insignificant compared to the complete perfectness my soul felt when you stood before me, courageous, and giving, and honest, and so quintessentially fundamental in my life, I didn't know how I had survived without you.
"So loose you could fit a whole ‘nother dick in you. Maybe two. Ever had that, whore? Ever had three cocks up that gaping hole? Bet it left you a whimpering mess. What would your mother say?"
“Harry” Draco whispered, and it was meant as a warning. Yet his body betrayed him, and it came out as more of a moan.
You look back to the mirror. He’s been watching you, anything but discreet. A grin settles across his mouth. Your heart skips a beat.
me? Harry questions, sounding exactly like the 13-year-old schoolboy he'd swore just the other day he wasn't.
You know that's what will happen; an altercation that will leave you changed, a paradigm shift of sorts. How are you expected to carry on with the day to day of life, knowing what it finally feels like, to be with him? Every previously held assumption and belief extirpated in an instant, because never, in all your fantasies, did he ever want you in return.
He stays on the pavement long enough for his legs to grow numb and fingers purple from the cold, unwilling to leave the place offering the only tangible evidence Draco was ever there. Defeat is inevitable, however. As black tinges with the pink of a new day, Harry peels himself from the ground with a sigh of resignation, closing his eyes and apparating to an empty Grimmauld Place.
"Or if you're after a more formal tone, something along the lines of-" he delicately clears his throat, before proving his new-found genius for improv with:
Harry Potter: Winner of Tri-Wizard Tournaments, Prodigy of Dumbledore, Killer of The Dark Lord himself.
His voice broke. “And then, to feel so desperate, so alone, so sickened by your own mutilated arm, which, despite their best efforts, still bears the mark, that you douse it with gas and light it on fire. You embrace the pain, the sweet stink of burning, because it means that it's
Him, whose eyes glint inky and dangerous under the black moon as he brings his hand to rest lightly at your waist, heat permeating through the layers of your dress robes.
It’s amazing; the best you’ve ever had. The best you’ve ever felt. But you knew it would be from the start. His and your conclusion was never going to be ordinary.
You’re elated when he motions his minions away; even more so when you notice the way his eyes track over your body and the curvature of his lips when he’s finished. You haven’t thought this far ahead, so use to being shunned that you don’t know what to do next. All you know is that you’re there, standing in front of him, and the only thing you can focus on is the overwhelming need to press your lips to his. Perhaps not the best idea, given the people present.
For a moment, Harry toys with the possibility of rebelling against the unknown sender by opening the letter marked 'II' first thereby making a small yet strong statement about undesired mail from undisclosed sources. Alas, propriety wins in the end, and he reluctantly trades the second letter for the first, succumbing to the enigmatic yet compelling peer-pressure mystically exuded from most ascending sequences, and submits to their unwavering demand for compliance. Furthermore, he doesn't know for sure the letters are, in fact, undesirable, reasoning he can always incendio the buggers if they do prove to be so and clear his kitchen of illegitimate fowl via a soft stinging hex.
Your hand on my knee. The brush of fingers against my back. Breath on my neck, arm around my waist, your warmth keeping me safe whilst we slept. Soft words and even softer lips; your voice. I didn't realise that loving you encompassed so much.
A piece of glass on the bedside table catches my eye. It's the one you first cut me with, the shard of mirror. It's a sign.
Magnus surreptitiously rearranges himself in his chair, deducing that particular train of thought was one best left for when one of the three was not sitting, slightly plastered, in his living room. Or for when all three were. Restraint, admittedly, has never been one of his virtues.
Admittedly and arguably understandably, Harry considers penning a very firm letter to the manager of Iniquity regarding the sanitation of his mask and the myriad of health and safety concerns he's now forced to contemplate after the transportation of said mask in the surely saliva-filled mouth of owl two. Despite the immense satisfaction doubtlessly gained from the writing of such a missive, in the end, he merely flicks a
“Hey.” Harry’s voice is ragged and low, yet it carries easily on the still air, noise ill and out of place in the silence. Draco flinches, head jerking up, body seizing and seeming to curl upon itself. He stares at Harry. There’s an emptiness in his eyes Harry recognises from his own, a dullness he knows reaches to the core. Draco’s hair is long, past the line of his shoulders, tall frame still slim.  He appears well dressed, clothes tailored nicely if not a little lose, although the stark whiteness of his shirt only emphasises the gaunt shadows under his eyes. There’s also a fragility to him. An unseen haze which lingers. He looks as if the slightest wind would break him; or perhaps he’s already broken.
back, try ignore the ache and the burn and the clench of your imminent release. Hold him, even as you sacrifice your balance to snake a hand around his thigh and clasp his aching cock, a cry ripped from his mouth at the touch.
A boundless tempest of citrus battering his body, lemon woven through every mote and dust and flicker carried on the air, permeating in totality the sum of Harry's entire being. He swims in it, could bathe in it, roll himself up in it and wear it as a cloak. Delicate, overpowering, subtle, callous, it tangles and chokes through his olfactory passages, claiming
“It’s okay, Potter. No one expects you to be happy.” Draco’s voice is soft, palm ghosting across Harry’s jaw.
It could have been minutes, hours, weeks, an eternity; at some point between then and now, Harry finds he can smell again. It's sharp, abrasive, a bouquet of aromas bombarding him from all sides. Every mote of fragrance burns his nostrils, and he sucks it in hungrily, headily, desperate for the scent of life, affirmation of the dissipation of naught.
Down the leather curves, attention sweeping from shoulder blades to inner knees, staining the sensitive flesh of his arse and thighs maroon in an instant. The strikes are sharper here, burning. Blood welling just under the skin, broken capillaries unfurling like roads across barren land, a map of the flesh already explored. A beacon for further pain to descend upon.
He's looking at you with an expression you've never seen on his face before, and can’t understand now. Don't have time to, because you're too busy exploring every inch of his uncovered torso. Your fingers slide over muscled arms, grasp shoulders, delicately caress long healed scars, the heat under your hands not a warmth you’ll be forgetting any time soon. He seems to burn, this man stood before you. A smoulder that winds its way through your body and clenches around your heart, melting away the cold that settled during the war.
He is naught. Oblivion. Numb and completely anesthetized, wrapped in a cocoon of blankness, he flounders, cut off completely from everything that gives him life. His mind feels trapped, racing like a rabbit caught in a snare. Unable to move, defend, fight, flee.
Blaise Zabini is sat alone, rear to the ground and back against the wall, legs stretched straight before him. His fly is tented, bottom lip caught between perfect, white teeth. Gaze hooded, he answers your attention with a slight shudder, pushing the heel of his hand firmly to his crotch.
When he was seventeen he learned that the pain of punishment carried far beyond the walls of his home, or even past the dank filth of the streets where he had been cast. That it wasn't contained to the beatings, the jeers of other, the agony of degradation.
When he was twenty two he learnt forgiveness. Of others. Of himself. Actions and consequences of younger selves forgivable, irrelevant in present day. How what you thought you knew wasn't always the truth; simply a façade, a mask worn, not so different from his own. To move on, history had to be released and the slate wiped clean. Bend before you broke.
He's a bloodhound. Scents washing over him in a storm of sensation, crucial clues building the room around him in his head; if he could shudder he would. Perhaps he does, overwhelmed and silently gasping, screaming in his head.
Draco turned back to Potter, who was wearing his now familiar haunted expression. "How long can I stay?" he asked, knowing that he would be happy as long as Potter allowed him long enough to have a proper shower and sleep in a bed.
The weighted-licks land, slipping down his crease, grazing his entrance. "I'm going to fuck you, pet," this illusion of Draco-yet-not promises with a grunt, voice cracking. "And you're going to watch your arse take every last inch of it."
“What is this?” He asks once Harry has finished, holding his palm rigid to inspect it. Blue ink mars ashy white, hypnotic in its illicitness; heady in its taboo.
Draco had survived, but that survival had come with a cost. With no wand and no way to defend himself he had quickly fallen prey to the sharks that ran the shelters, taking more than he should and promising them more than he could give. Consequently, he had been thrown once again to the streets. After payment in the form of pleasure had been taken, of course.
I’m in our bed. On our sheets, safe in our home we built together. If I close my eyes, I can convince myself you’re beside me.
It is one thing to wish for the unattainable. Another to have it presented in a naked, shuddering heap on your lap.
, an exhaustive cross-examination presented all in the name of one supposedly unforgettable night of depravity. A two-hundred-and-twelve-answers-long dissertation of the various ways, positions, soft limits, hard limits, turn-ons and turn-offs in which Harry James Potter resolutely does not hope that Draco Malfoy, in some octuré play of Fate's dice, is a man behind a mask.
"Avian!?" It's a little shrill. "I have a hard enough time with my hair as it is, thanks, without adding hundreds of feathers." Harry crosses his arms, sullen, and pouts. Magnus looks smug.
His body is alive under a ceaseless conflagration. Harry writhes, trapped, fighting uselessly against the biting lines of chain that hold him hostage. Burning, aflame, white-hot and incandescent; surely charred to gleaming bone.
It would have been enough, before. Still probably would be, if this was all he was willing to give. But the irrevocable craving sears carnal and inescapable and oh,
With a strangled curse that has your balls drawing tight, Harry shudders and spills his climax to the floor. His untouched cock smears sweat and fluids on the ground as he convulses on your length, whimpers caught between red lips dragging you to the cusp of your own culmination.
"Look at you, filthy fucking whore. No better than dog shit, certainly smell like it. Well go on then. Suck it, dick pig."
"About the same time I started selling myself just to stay alive" Draco blandly stated, not welcoming the reminder of his past. "Probably round the point you gave up. Now if you’ll excuse me, I'm going to go wash the spunk from the last three years out of my ass."
Guys! I'm back! I am so so so sorry for how long this has taken. The chapter took me a few weeks to write, and then my editor/love of my life decided to live her own life for four weeks.
fuck, you feel like a clichéd virgin when the sheer sight makes you question how you had managed to survive this long without seeing him, dressed in
Privately he thinks Harry should just tell Draco how he feels and go from there. That, or jump him in bed, nude. But his advice for the former has already fallen on deaf ears, and he somehow doesn't see Harry going for the latter. "You need to start with a grand gesture," he says instead, attempting to sound sage. "Something that clearly states your intentions. Something that screams, 'I'm here, I'm queer, and I want to fuck your brains out.'" Harry's brow crinkles, and Magnus hastily continues. "Among other more romantic things, of course. If I were you, I'd start with a horse. Draco seems like a man who'd appreciate a good gelding." Or he had at Ascot anyway, the snobby trollop. "Ride that beast right through his gates and up to the front door. When Draco appears, clearly enticed by your entrance, recite a poem and gift him with..." Magnus flounders briefly, before saying the first thing that comes to mind, "a pair of wrought-iron candelabras. Added points if you can find a matching set of napkin rings for his mother."
When Draco woke, Potter was asleep beside him. He had slumped in his slumber, an arm thrown out and his sleeve scrunched, exposing the patchwork of scarring that laced up the pale underside to the elbow. Fresh cuts were layered upon old, creating a haunting sort of artistry. If it wasn't for the medium, he would call it beautiful.
The chains - manacles, cuffs for all Harry knows - jangle again. He's sure the man is doing it on purpose, a sound meant to put him on edge. It's working, although if it's trepidation the man's after he'll be disappointed. Harry's filled with plenty of distress, a fucking cornucopia of
The leather connects lower, one studded-end a hippogriff's hair away from the fragile swell of Harry's balls. He convulses, hands gripping white-knuckled to the wall. Illegible words ring out alongside the crack of a whip, and it takes him far too long to register the garbled cries as his own. Beyond pain, beyond arousal; all Harry knows is he needs something else. He moves his legs wider, bends lower, exposes more.
“I can't.” Draco's voice trembled, and he felt like he was about to plummet. Standing on the edge of the void, his mind screamed to run, to turn, to pull back. But his body... all his body wanted to do was step off, and embrace the free fall.
Frozen pinpricks on his cock that's softened under solidifying flame, a frigid trail which spreads down his balls, hovers above his arse. It blisters in the way only the cold can do; glacial daggers of brumal heat slicing over his still-burning flesh, pooling in the hollows of stomach, hip, chest.
Harry stands. Draco’s drawing nearer, will pass where he’s hidden soon. The thought of letting him go fills Harry with panic. It’s not the body of hours lost waiting for this very thing, those so very
A spotlight of sorts hangs from the middle of the ceiling, the perfect circle of light illuminating only a small centre of the void where a deep red X has been marked into the floor. Darkness edges the boundary of this out-of-place brilliance; beyond the circle, nothing can be seen, the edges of confinement hidden within infinite tenebrosity. Anything and everything could be held in this adumbration, malignant or benign, and Harry feels the first fissure of fear spark upon his neck. He takes a step forward, the door closing softly behind him, and takes a steadying breath.
"Help me, Magnus," Harry blurts, eyes more than a little wild as he fixes Magnus with an imploring look. It's pitiful, all of it: the semi-pissed, tousled Harry, the endless conversations of Draco; Magnus, himself, and the fond exasperation he feels towards the younger boy. He feels himself thaw slightly and that's it. He's fucked. Despite the resentment he outwardly portrays at somehow finding himself in the position of a rather underqualified therapist slash love-guru, Magnus can't deny he wouldn't be opposed to finally seeing the pair together - he's always been a whore for a gay-ever-after. Indeed, he predicts he'd feel somewhat smug at his hand in the whole thing. Never mind the added bonus of a cease in Draco-related, Thursday eve winging.
“It’s going to pour down,” Draco announces, and Harry realises Draco’s evaded his question. He’s right, though. Within seconds the clouds are opening up, dispersing their pressure in thick, fat drops which shatter loudly against the concrete. Harry’s drenched instantly - Draco couldn’t have fared any better. There’s no point in seeking cover, and anyway, he likes this weather. The cold, bone-deep wetness which seems to seep into his very core, igniting senses even as it dulls nerves to a dangerous point. It's in moments like these, Harry never feels more inconsequential. Mother Nature raging crude destruction, his body alive with his own mortality, it's what he's always desired. What he fights to achieve.  A flash of lightning momentarily illuminates the pallor of Draco’s face and his brows pull down into a frown. “The taste of death, which dance along light,” he intones lowly before shaking himself. “I’ve got to go.” The storm gathers closer to where they stand, rolling overhead . “Lucius doesn't deal well with this.”
, in the dank, oiled smell of worn leather, white smoke-ash of melted wax, fire throwing astringent blooms to the air. The earthy, primal odour of dragonhide, underlaid by the synthetic tang of rubber; the sweet yet bitter piquancy of new alloys.
and any hesitancy, any reservations that you may have been entertaining, are gone. Your hands are desperate as they tug at the heavy dress robes he’s wearing, the offending garment thrown aside without a thought as it comes away, leaving him clad only in black slacks and a silk dress shirt.
. Slumping down, he curled his shaking form into a ball, arms wound tightly around his body, and shut his eyes.
Harry jolted, before turning to face him. “Draco?” he softly queried, taking a tentative step forward.
, across Harry's ears. "Sight. Touch. Sound. Taste. Smell." A breathy pause, a building of anticipation, the moment before the fall. "So I decided, for tonight. I'm going to take them away. And it will only be with your complete compliance that they'll be returned."
You can’t say how but suddenly your hands are on him, pulling him closer, closing the space between you until your bodies are millimetres apart. A hitched intake of breath and your eyes are flicking down – just a little – seeking his gaze, confirmation that you’re not the only crazy one to feel the pull between you. His breath is ragged against your cheeks, and if you press your body a breath closer–
It was Potter stirring that pulled Draco out of his dark musings, mind lost wandering through the desolate bleak paths of memory and crumbling buildings which once housed self-worth. Draco hurried to push his sleeve back down, masking the ruin of flesh with the ever present mark still visible and turned to look at Potter who was peeling crusted eyes open and squinting even in the deep shadows of the bridge.
“The taste of death” Harry murmurs aimlessly, pulling his glasses from his face in a vain attempt to dry the lenses. He drops himself heavily to the ground, uncaring of the wetness which instantly saturates his pants. He feels hollow, wrung out. An empty vessel needing to be filled.  Alive and physically intact, yet held together only by the frailest wisps of twine. Still. Draco had been here. He’d conversed with Harry, and hadn’t looked at him like he was insane, nor pitied him with knowing eyes whilst gently suggesting '
. A glimpse of the boy who had filled Harry’s younger years with the passion he so perilously craves.  “I reside with a psychopath, within the walls another claimed as his own. There is never a minute in which an unforgivable is not cast! I-I...” He stumbles, chokes. Just like that, Draco deflates. Shoulders slumping forward, his mouth a thin, pressed line, outrage extinguished - a flame beneath a hurricane. When he speaks, minutes or hours or years later, it’s with the voice of a dead man. “No, Potter. I am not happy. I rather doubt you are, either.”
When he was eleven he knew rejection. A spurned handshake, a sneered retort. The tracks it burnt in his psyche, unused to the sting of dismissal.
Harry remembers Draco’s ‘nothing’. He’s not convinced. On impulse, he digs his hand into his pocket, rummaging. “Do you have a quill?” he asks, followed by “don’t worry,” as he finds the muggle pen he was after. He looks at Draco. “I suppose parchment’s a bit much to ask for?”
"I guess not." Who was Draco to judge? Potter grunted and then Draco was lost to the sick spinning tightness as Potter disapparated them.
It covers the new scars. I know you've always been self-conscious of your arm, despite what you insist otherwise. Maybe now, some of that discomfort will be relieved. You once told me you loved my ones; the flaws which mar my body your reminder of struggles completed and overcome. I hope you still feel that way. I've acquired a fair few more.
? Hermione asks the same question every time he sees her, yet it hits him harder now it’s voiced from another.  Unsteady, he takes a step forward, Draco’s stare wary as Harry quickly presses an index finger to his shoulder.
"Your magical signature, Mr Potter," The Manager answers knowingly, eyes warming a fraction as he settles himself behind his desk. "You can rest assured your face is quite unidentifiable. Enthralling, isn't it, how the little quirks of nature and fate govern completely the recognition of others." He clears his throat with a low chuckle. "But I doubt you're here to entertain the musings of one such as myself. If you'd be so kind as to sign these, please, then we can get on with the eve's proceedings." The Manager pushes a small scroll of parchment toward Harry with delicate, olive-toned fingers, perfectly manicured nails glinting under the warm light of the room. Unfortunately, as he is occasionally known to do, Harry's overcome by the instinctive urge to be a giant cock and query whether the nails came with the faux-body or if he did, truly, have someone waiting on him hand, ass and foot. He's gearing up to, deliberating whether to mention the owl sanitation issue whilst at it because, really, if he's going to be a prick he may as well notch it up to cunt and make a decent scene, but a ruffle of blue catches his eye and he makes the mistake of looking over only to make rather intense eye contact with an extraordinary owl of azure complexion. The bird hoots, possibly aggrieved, however one can never know for sure. In Harry's experience, one hoot sounds much like the other, so he feels free to interpret hoots however the hell he wants; in this instance as a warm hello to an old comrade.
For a few long moments, Harry thinks he’s dreaming. Either that or hallucinating, a cruel trick of the psyche. A mirage, for surely he’s a drowning man forfeited to the sea. A wayward wanderer, thirsting for water. Mind providing him with the illusion he so perilously craves, for even his sanity has taken pity on the delusions of a broken fool.
"Right you are. You don't have the suaveness to pull them off." It's bitchy, Magnus knows, but Harry could act a touch appreciative for the help. "Let's move on. After the declaration comes the swanning."
It seems fitting to spend my final time in the space that you had hesitantly claimed as your own. I would have given you the world, moved stars,
and he knows these walls have been privy to humanity’s darkest sins.  He doesn’t enter, simply pauses at the door to sweep his eyes over the dingy space before moving on.
Draco let out a strangled laugh. “You think I can beat my father? With no wand? He’s ruthless, Harry. He doesn't give a shit, and doesn't play by anyone's rules.”
The word hangs in the air. Why indeed? Why has Harry sat here for weeks on end, suffering through the bitter cold on the off chance Draco would once again walk this way? How does he even start to explain to his once-enemy how he felt like he had no other choice? That, for reasons better left unexplored, Draco had somehow turned from the antagonist to the protagonist in Harry’s aftermath story? The key to, well, if not happiness, then contentment. The only person Harry thinks will understand. Him. This. Everything.
So gone he almost misses the resonance of his name ripped brokenly from between gritted teeth as he's followed into euphoria.
“I don't blame you, not any more.” Draco's voice dropped. “If you hadn't escaped. Well... I’m not sure what kind of place we would be living in now. You did what you had to do. Can you just tell me-” He pulled in a ragged sigh. “-You obviously don't have it now. What did you do with it? In the end?”
Draco freezes as Harry’s fingers contact pallid skin. His flesh is soft under Harry’s touch, pulled taut over cheek and jaw bones, barely a whisper of stubble to be felt. He moves to see Draco’s entire face, jaw still caught. Purples, yellows, greens emerge as Harry slowly unveils his features, sharp contours only succeeding in highlighting trauma which travels from eye to throat. Rage rushes through Harry, catching him by surprise. How long has it been since he’s felt this? Cared enough about anything, or anyone, to trigger more than his usual idle disinterest? The fury burns intoxicatingly sweet in his veins, and even as he chokes “the fuck, Draco,” past gritted teeth, one part of him is revelling in the onslaught of emotion stirring his anesthetised limbs.
Hard, but not impossible. There are other streets to roam, until then. “Okay. But you will come, Draco?”
Harry’s hands are numb; he shoves them into his coat pockets. “I don’t know,” he finally answers. “Not exactly. I’ll tell you when I've figured it out for sure.”
Harry's cheeks are rapidly turning an interesting shade of crimson. Magnus continues, getting into the swing of things.
Harry regards the new owl, which has retreated to the relative safety of his second favourite candelabrum, possibly to either calculate the exact angle required to shit on Harry's head or as instructed to ensure the preservation of its original colouration, from above the rim of his glasses. He thinks the club is taking the whole owl thing a tad too far. Indeed, Harry himself had found owl one -
He’s no sheep. Maybe he was once upon a time, back when he was a tool wielded by the light, the boy conditioned to save the world. You know what it’s like, to live with the weight of others expectations. To feel as if you have no alternatives. No free will. No ability to deviate from the prerequisite route chosen for you, long before you could have a say. Long before you started to question the side you were fighting for. The one you were so eager to please.
You fist your hands in his hair, letting the deceptively soft strands run through your fingers, marvelling at the contrast of black against white. You resist the urge to pull, tug, force, not knowing how he would react. Anyway, it’s an equal you want, not a submissive.
Harry turns away, looking out across the gloom of slumbering London to mask the smile he can feel pulling at his mouth. A foreign feeling, one he knows Draco isn't ready to see yet.  He’s acutely aware of Draco beside him, wants to turn to him. Look at him. Hold his gaze and bury his face into Draco’s neck for no other reason than to feel another’s skin against his.  Instead, he exhales loudly through his nose, head tilting up when a drop of rain breaks across his forehead.
All too soon Harry arrives outside his own door. He lays his forehead lightly to the tarnished nameplate as he does every morning before sleep, letting the dull metal press into his skin for a moment then pushing his way into what was once Sirius’ room. With mechanical movements, he strips the wet clothes from his body and climbs into bed.
Perhaps it’s because Draco ignites his dormant saviour complexion. Perhaps he’s right to say they’re the same.
I came home today. St Mungo's kept me in longer than necessary, and after, Hermione insisted I stay with them for a few weeks. You know how she gets; easier to say yes. Rose asked for you, something about the two of you being halfway through a book? Even if you’re angry at me, you should go read to her.
George Weasely has claimed a couch. He reclines almost regally, one arm flung over the side, the other -
Your hand is on your cock, spreading oil down the length. Superfluous: Harry's so loose you could fit four dicks up his arse, like the tail of a peacock. Still, it's the gesture that matters. Presage for your quivering audience that the principle attraction is about to commence.
You made me feel loved. I'd never understood, before, the power those three words held. I had thought myself beyond hope; you showed me I’d simply been waiting for you.
“Revenge, I guess?” Ron shoved a full fork into his mouth. “Apparently, Malfoy’s into some pretty kinky stuff.”
Harry’s forearms throbbed in pain as the blindfold was Vanished away. He blinked into the dim light of the room before answering.
However his birthday came and went. There was a party, bigger than Harry had ever wanted, with people he considered his family flying in from all over the continent. He was happy to see them, happy to ring in his fortieth, thankful to have Neville at his side celebrating as well, taking half of the attention and cutting half of the cake.
“Great to see you!” Longbottom clapped and walked over to Draco, “I’m so glad you made it!” He pulled Draco’s hand into his own, rough and calloused from days spent in the dirt.
Yes, Potter was easy enough on the eyes to elicit weeks of wanking material. He had tried to push it to the back of his mind, the thought of the Chosen One against the wall, or on his blessed knees, his mouth gasping, his throat arched, his cock hard and wanton.
The first swat happened quickly, as did the second and third, and soon Harry could only concentrate on the force, the brisk sting, and the loud clap of noise filling the room. His Master’s hand continued to fly, hard and fast across his bare buttocks, and by the time his ten spankings were distributed, Harry could barely hold back the whines erupting from his throat.
, as wet as you were the first time I noticed you. When you breached the black lake during the second task. Gasping for air and so fucking triumphant. I couldn’t stop staring at you, Potter.”
If he had been less distracted by the rain, by the scent of Potter’s mouth, he might have thought of a half-decent retort. Instead, he had blankly shown his cards, practically told Potter he had started wanking to him as soon as he knew what wanking was. Shameful Slytherin move.
“I—” Draco started. He could do this. He could state his needs to the people he trusted. “I want to ask you a question. It’s personal.”
“It’s like a weight, resting right between my shoulder-blades. And, when we play, Ginny lifts it. I...can’t describe it any other way. I can only focus on her, not on all the other distractions.” She smiled, her eyes drifting off to that blank space on the wall again. “It’s freeing.”
How good Potter would look in his own House colours, accentuating the gorgeous green in his eyes as Draco tied him to a chair and teased his cock with his tongue.
“Makes you want to fly, right?” Potter’s face was so close as he continued to whisper, even though the bird was long gone from their tree. His face was flushed, and it reminded Draco of the last time he saw Potter fly, before the war and the scars across his chest. Before everything went to shit.
“Are you hurt?” his mother asked, and while the question sounded like she was concerned, he instead could feel her eyes scanning his frumpled shirt, his rolled-up sleeves, his tight, black trousers. “Did you really go out in public like that?”
A familiar voice to his right cut through the singers. Draco turned to his right, spotting familiar green eyes across the crowd.
His Master shifted in his chair, and Harry could hear the light clink of his buckle. “Now ask me for my belt.”
Harry wanted to groan, his cock hard and nestled between his Master’s thighs, but he bit his lip to stop it, not wanting to make any noise and risk his chance at pleasure. Instead, he closed his eyes again, focusing on breathing through his nose as he felt Sir’s hands rubbing up and down his skin.
His backside was covered by his pants, the same ones Harry had seen day in and day out, a stark masculine contrast to the otherwise feminine look. Before Harry could comment on it, however, he saw the fabric slowly transform into a black lace thong, complete with a final green bow right at the cleft of Draco’s arse.
Draco felt his body tense. He had taken a chance on this whole thing, thinking that some semblance of this would somehow help his outbursts, but Draco wasn’t sure he was ready for an example. Especially considering the submissive was in fact his childhood friend.
Draco blinked, thinking the dim lights in the dungeon were playing tricks on him. No way was Scarhead in a seedy club. He was a fucking Auror, Head Auror at that. Surely
Harry clicked off his mic and kicked his chair backwards. Rolling his shoulders, he stretched before standing up out of his chair. Sometimes, especially when the Cannons were playing, Harry really loved this excuse of a job.
“Oh fuck,” Draco said, rolling his eyes even more dramatically. “I was gone this morning, and therefore so were the stockings.”
But they had been together for more than a decade, married for a year, and Harry knew Draco better than the jagged scar above his eyebrow.
It had taken three days (and quite a few quips from Tom) for Draco to read the scrawled letters from the dozens of owls Pansy had sent. Three perfectly fine days where he was just assuming Scarhead had finally bit the Kedavra once and for all. Three days where he couldn’t sleep, couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe until he finally opened the desperately folded parchment clinging to the talon of her favorite bird.
“Over my thigh, Potter,” Sir growled, and Harry’s cock twitched eagerly. He knew what was coming. Now that he was giving that directive, Harry couldn’t wait until his whole body was alight with his Master’s touch.
After all, what happened earlier was nothing. Some stupid game that went horribly wrong. He hadn’t meant to look at Potter. It had been an accident.
“Does it...” He felt the blush crawl up his cheeks, and instead of pouring more liquid into his glass, he took a swig straight from the bottle. It was barbaric, and it burned a bit, but the warmness building inside his belly fueled him enough to finish the question. “Does it hurt?”
“Draco,” a voice called in warning from behind him, clipped and short. He immediately ignored it. He wouldn’t let go of this power, this control, not of his own volition. He continued.
Draco froze. He recognized that voice, having spent the previous night hearing it over and over in his dreams. However, he was very, very much awake, very close to to the yearning sound, and yet he still couldn’t believe that it was-
“Oli, yes, Neville, we know,” Ginny rolled her eyes but gave Neville a reassuring smile. “Maybe in a minute. Draco, didn’t you have an emergency? Of the…” Her voice trailed off as she raised her eyebrows at Draco.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he woke up with such a need to come, his body working on instinct to bring him the pleasure he seemingly craved. But now that he had, he felt like he could breathe just a bit better, like he was lighter somehow.
A bit of Harry had always been envious about how Malfoy thrived in the limelight. It was always a space Harry was thrust into, not out of want, but out of necessity. Malfoy usually commanded it, brightening under its power. The Malfoy in front of him now, however, was more like a wallflower than a sunbeam.
Ginny sighed. “Well, then you’ll just have to go and find out. If I know Harry, he’ll make sure you know one way or another.” She stood and set her glass down on the nearby table, before turning and holding out her hand to Pansy. “And now, I’m going to show you how asking for what you want works in your favour.” Pansy took her hand as Ginny pulled her off of the couch. “Let’s go see Oli for some Sober-Up, and then I want you naked, bound and desperate for my mouth before my tea gets cold.”
“That’s a good boy,” Neville moaned as he lifted his hips and fucked into Theo’s entrance. “I’ll take care of your hole, baby.”
“I said, why not, Malfoy?” Potter said. He was demanding an answer, Draco knew. He also knew he needed to be honest. With Potter, and with himself.
“No, it’s fine because It’s not a date,” Draco spluttered. “At least, I don’t… exactly know if it is or isn’t.” His cheeks were getting flushed, and his hands were gripping his glass tightly.
Potter let out a noise that almost sounded like a mewl, and Draco finally dipped his fingers under the hem of his green shirt, gripping at his hips while his other hand pushed Potter further against the tree. Potter was caught, tethered between Draco and the hearty bark, and when Draco manoeuvered his hips, he felt the hard neediness of Potter against his thigh.
“That’s my good boy,” Neville praised as he lifted his hips, pumping himself eagerly into Theo. “Daddy’s going to come too, fill you up.”
Draco gasped inadvertently as Neville’s hands continued to tease Theo, his mouth working his way back up to Theo’s throat, to the metal band that cinched tightly around his neck. He clutched the globes of Theo’s arse and began to knead them, exposing the tiniest of glimpses of a furled pink hole.
As Neville and Draco turned past a bunch of Burst-Not Bouncing Bubbles and a herd of children chasing after them across the grass, he spotted the witch who could only be his Aunt Andromeda. Draco’s stomach tightened even more as they headed in her direction.
He couldn’t budge; he felt frozen to the spot as he watched Potter walk slowly towards him, full smile and a twinkle in his eye.
Draco choked on his sip of whisky, flinching at the leathery bite. “Potter? Why would you say that?”
Harry wouldn’t. Instead, he let his fingers dance across Draco’s chest, still covered in clean, starchy fabric. “Do you ever wear a brassiere?” he asked, rolling his hips against Draco’s firm arse.
“It wasn’t great,” Harry shrugged. “As awful as he was to us in school, he doesn’t deserve to be yanked out of the closet.”
Potter nodded, still staring up at the tree, and he gave Draco’s hand a squeeze. Draco felt the thrum of excitement all the way up his arm as he forced his stare from Potter’s ear back up to the creature in the tree.
“If you caught the match between the Appleby Arrows and the Chudley Cannons, you know we were all gifted with yet another fumble by Arrows seeker, Draco Malfoy! Yes, once again, Malfoy failed to catch the Snitch, even though it was less than a foot from his own face.”
Harry closed his eyes, trying to fight the sudden wave of anger that was brewing in his belly. “What if we practiced?” he suggested. “I’ve got this big garden, and the only one who uses it is Neville, and it’s not like I do anything outside of the show except focus on Quidditch and the dust gathering on my windowsill.”
“As if I wasn’t already under enough scrutiny, you had to go and accuse me of not knowing the difference between a Snitch and a-”
Neville hummed in agreement. “But there are other ways to trigger those endorphins.” Pulling out his wand, Neville tapped the item in his palm. It began to buzz, vibrating against Neville’s skin. “The endorphins are what send our partners into Subspace, so if we can’t utilize spanking, flogging, or crops, we have to induce a stressful situation another way.”
Draco clutched at the knot in his silk tie, black stripes with the tiniest glint of silver. Alexsander said it brought out his eyes, and with that thought, Draco opened his own.
Everything in play seemed so safe, so consensual that it was putting Draco’s fears at ease. There were so many ways a Submissive could be hurt, but so many more that they could be safe, if Draco focused, if he learned and practiced.
And yet, he could see Neville’s eyes close as he continued to lick and suck at Theo’s most private area. His cock hung heavy between his own thighs, and he appeared to be more in bliss than in horror.
Harry pulled the platter close to himself, out of Ron’s reach. “No food for arseholes who kinkshame.”
Harry rolled his eyes before Vanishing the platter straight to the fridge. “I’d rather he tell me himself.”
Sliding the comb back into its wooden drawer, Draco glanced at his appearance once again. Not a hair out of place, robes freshly pressed, collar sharp against his pale neck. No one would guess what he was hiding underneath his clothes; underneath his skin. Even he avoided thinking about it most of the time.
“I haven’t even a molecule of an idea of what letter you speak of, Potter,” he said, dripping with as much contempt as he could muster in his current state. “In fact, if it weren’t for sixth-year potions, I wouldn’t even have confidence you could read.”
“I - I think I better head out, Pans.” Draco muttered, climbing out of the comfy couch. “Things to do.”
Draco had kissed someone before, but it had been Pansy, practically like kissing his sister, and it had felt so horribly wrong. This, though, felt so incredibly right. Draco leaned into Potter, crowding him even further into the tree, and even though the bark must have been rough on his back, Potter was soft in his arms, pliant and willing and so very sweet.
Draco opened his mouth, ready to apologise for his tardiness and his clothing choices and the empty table in front of them. He braced himself for the shattering of glass, or the splintering of wood exposing his anxiety that was surely to come.
Neville paused. “Your limits are your limits, Draco. But if you’re curious about something, we can talk about it.”
Draco could feel each fresh drop of rain running down his cheeks as he continued to hover over Potter. “Were you just scared, Potter? That I’d beat you, be a better Dominant, Neville’s star pupil?” Potter inhaled as the rain started to fall in earnest. “Scared he’d like me better than you?”
When he returned the next night, Neville showed Draco how to check his Submissive’s blood circulation, to see if a muscle or tendon was being stretched too taut. They used realistic dummy’s again, and Draco wondered if Neville ever played with anyone else to explore his own green kinks that didn’t overlap with Theo’s.
“Oh, fuck, gonna come all over your gorgeous face, Malfoy,” Harry cried, and Draco finally let himself crest, coming hard and fast, coating his chest with drips of his pleasure.
When Draco looked down, he saw Potter’s fingers firmly clasped around him, pressing gently into his Dark Mark.
“Are you alone, Malfoy?” Harry asked, suddenly finding himself curious who Malfoy might be spending his nights with.
“Oh, honey,” Pansy smirked, “everyone wants to know what we get up to. We had quite an audience. I’m surprised you didn’t see the group.”
“No. Well, technically right now I am, but I haven’t been alone for long.” Draco paused. “And before you ask, yes, my previous partner happened to be a man. But I didn’t want myself outed on that pathetic thing you call a radio show.”
He couldn’t wait to see Draco in nothing but these stockings, laced with green to perfectly match his lover’s eyes.
“Loves you so much!” Neville interrupted with a laugh. He placed a kiss on Theo’s forehead before releasing him, slinking an arm around his waist as he did so.
But he was also used to acclimating to the people around him, posturing in the Slytherin house, conforming to his father’s rules in his own home. Adjusting his traits to align himself with the best possible outcome.
The wall exposed what could have been any ordinary bedroom. Theo sat on a long wooden bench at the edge of what appeared to be quite a comfy bed. His black shirt was unbuttoned, rolled up to the elbows and revealing toned arms Draco had certainly not noticed in school. His chest was defined, soft dips of muscle stretched across his stomach, the tiny buds of his nipples already peaked. Around his neck hung the loose metal chain Draco had glimpsed earlier, and he arched his throat as he leaned his head back.
When Draco did appear, however, it was in his sturdy black pants, the same ones he donned every night, and while he gave Harry an incredible blow job and made him come one more time with their favourite purple dildo, the stockings did not make an appearance.
a bit of wandering around a BDSM club. No scenes in this one, but there is talk of toys and safewords. A brief mention of some past trauma with Draco dearest (vanishing cabinet talk)
“Thwas thddd yhhh,” Potter mumbled something, but Draco couldn’t hear it over the rain. He leaned in, pressing himself closer. Just to hear better, of course. The rain outside of his shield continued to pelt away, but inside it was dry. Warm.
“You’re so good at taking it, my baby bear.” Neville praised as his fingers continued to open Theo up. The position looked uncomfortable, but Theo still seemed so relaxed, as if the opportunity to have Neville’s cock down his throat was more pleasurable than air itself.
“So,” Neville continued, “there are three types of play we’re going to discuss in a power exchange like a Dominant to a Submissive.” He motioned toward Theo. “The first, being demonstrated here, is a glance at preference training.” Neville paused, licked his lips, and commanded. “Position two, please.”
Harry closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, trying to calm the pounding of his heart in his chest. He was not going to let himself get confused; he was not going to easily drop this. He needed this too much. “You...you know what stockings I’m talking about, Draco.”
One of Neville’s burly hands made its way to Theo’s backside, and while his cock was filling Theo’s hole completely, Neville began to tease his rim, adding to his pleasure. Draco tightened his grip around his cock even more, as he felt his bollocks tighten in anticipation.
“Couldn’t agree more,” Draco said, throwing back the rest of his drink. “Well, now that precious Potter knows what I like in bed, I’m sure everyone will hear it on your next segment.”
His cock was practically throbbing in his trousers now, as he watched Neville open Theo up. He could hear Theo’s moans, hear the slick laps of Neville’s tongue. He pressed his palm to the front of his zip as Neville’s hand began to tug at Theo’s bollocks, but between the groaning of his former Housemate and the debauchery of Neville’s ministrations, it wasn’t nearly enough.
Finally, Neville stepped backwards, removing his fingers from Theo’s entrance and his cock from Theo’s mouth. He wrapped one of his hands around Theo’s metal collar, pulling it taut as his head dropped and his mouth met Theo’s once more.
Potter’s hands found their way into his pockets as he stepped back, cheeks flushed and grinning from ear to ear.
He felt Potter’s question, the cool, minty breath on his cheek, more than heard it. He blinked, centering his gaze, and when he opened his eyes, they were filled with green instead of gold.
The rest of the session was spent delving into the trunk, pulling out vibrators and plugs, ball gags and various restraints, including rope, silk, and cold metal chaining.
He opened his mouth to ask his burning question, but then remembered Potter’s request that they stay quiet. Thinking quickly, Draco leaned forward, towards Potter’s ear, and whispered his ask instead.
The angle changes and urgency blooms, Harry's stomach clenched, dick trapped in the overwhelming friction created between their bodies. It's absolutely ridiculous, the notion he's ready to burst again so soon, outlandish with the blanket of torment layering his torso. The man's hands supporting his hips move, curling under Harry's arse, one finger reaching to trace the seam of their unity.
Is Draco a participant in the life around him, or merely spectating? Would he be missed is he was to simply disappear, or would people panic? Search for him? Mourn?
type and such, you'll be off, yes?" He lets his gaze linger pointedly on the tumbler in Harry's hand. "I'd like to retain at least one of my fine spirits."
- he’s already ready; already pleading for you to do it, and you’re definitely not going to question whether it's magic or -
The start of the day for most; the end for him. Still, this collection of hours has been better than most. They contained Draco, and Draco meant
Harry shuffled awkwardly, his feet sweeping dust arches back and forth across the marred floor. “What happened to your wand?” he asked eventually.
Time surely advances, yet for Harry it's meaningless. Unable to track the passing of the clock, calm himself with the sound of breath inhaled and exhaled, be reassured by the steady thump of his heart.
Then the sound of a match being struck reaches his ears, the scent of igniting phosphorus, burning wick, melting paraffin soon following, and the sliver of recognition is abandoned for the promise of "
Draco's eyes smoulder. Harry shudders. Magnus deduces it would be an appropriate time to leave, tightness in his pants be damned.
“I've been waiting for you.” It never crosses Harry’s mind to say anything bar the truth. “Hoping I'd see you again.”
“What's done is done. I can't change the past; I haven't got a time-turner. And anyway, most would say I deserved it, what I got. They certainly did.”
Willowy, tall, pale. Legs wrapped in the shiny clutch of synthetic black leading up to a chest clothed with scarcely more than the mere suggestion of mesh, heeled boots crafted from the muted iridescence of dragon hide reaching to the knee.
So he doesn't. Resolutely so, even as he opens letter II with completely-stable fingers, checks the boxes with his chicken-scratch penmanship next to
, much longer. Still. You force your gaze to settle on the tense crowd, ensuring their enthrallment. Meeting each set of eyes in turn and unable to suppress a shiver at what stares back:
"It's futile, Magnus. He's uncrackable. He's unwooable. He's unimpressible." Cue dramatic sigh. "He's impossible."
It’s him who severs the silence. Him, who pushes away from the brick and takes two steps forward, close enough so that his smell envelops you, woody and smoky and
Harry’s gaze flicked down to his wrists. “It is. But I’d go back. For you.” Draco said nothing, shifting awkwardly in Potter’s lap. “How many are there?”
Draco pauses. Seemingly reluctant, he eventually relents. “Two weeks,” he says, voice firm. “I’ll meet you in two weeks. You have to promise me something, however.”
He is fatigued; eyes shadowed and body weary. Yet an unknown need compels him to the shadows congregating in the far end corner of the yard.  Through the french doors, he watches Hermione. Crossed-legged, ministry robes pressed immaculately, coffee mug in hand. Harry can’t remember her so blithe around him - a time she was so content. The lines which strain her face in his company are missing, eyes free of the worry he unwillingly yet inevitably adds. He stays a few breaths longer; observes as Ron, auror uniform slung casually over shoulder, kisses his wife good morning. Laughs at an unheard comment, steals a sip from her mug.
Fuck it. Let the destruction fuel you. You've come too far now to turn away, and despite the fact that you think you could lie here forever with his lips on your skin, you’re all too scared of losing this one glorious opportunity. Your hands come to rest at his waist and abruptly you push him away, smirking as he lands with an exclamation in a heap on the ground. He can take it, has taken worse. You slither off the bed and crawl towards him, basking in the way his eyes lower and head slumps back, the slight opening of his still pant covered legs. With a predatory leer, you grab them and pull them off, an obscene whine audible as you note the lack of underwear.
One stray, clutching, abandoned and destitute, to another; both lost adrift in an amaranthine storm.
Once, you confided how I’d saved you, too. Gave you a life you’d thought impossible. I told you then, and I’ll tell you now: you’re more than capable of defying fate on your own.
Potter stepped closer to him, and fuck, Draco hadn't been looked at like that for a very long time; like he wasn't just a piece of meat. "When did you get so humble?"
Harry cries out brokenly and Magnus turns, taking in the desperate clutch of Harry's fingers around Draco's hips, the breathy moans, the hiss of dragonhide against denim, the fact that two men were rutting in Magnus' chair and seemingly on the brink of orgasm.
"Sir," The Manager greats in tones of honey and oil and draped velveteen, a voice Harry is occasionally known to imagine whispering instruction in his ear, even if the body behind it does little for his lust. This body, at least, to be more precise; the air around the man undulates ever so slightly, and although it has crossed Harry's mind before to enquire about the need for disillusionment, in time he's come to accept it. The Manager gestures Harry inside, closing the door behind him with a soft click and regarding him with eyes far too sharp in the plush luxury of the room. "Mr Potter. A pleasure to see you, as always. Please take a seat, old bean."
It's the sanest thing Harry's said all evening; one only had to look at Magnus' current company. He resists pointing this out however, painful as it is to hold his tongue. Whilst fantastic to stray from the topic of Draco Malfoy, he's not sure a debate about modern lingo is the topic to do so with. Especially considering Magnus' 'proof' doesn't really do much for his argument. Unfortunately.
