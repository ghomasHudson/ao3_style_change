"Yes, yes, harder, fuck me harder!" Draco groaned thrusting back as Harry thrust forward. Harry pulled out and chuckled at the whine Draco let out. He flipped Draco onto his back and quickly thrusted back in.  Draco wrapped his legs around Harry and pulled him close.  His arms wrapped around Harry's neck nails scratching at his back.
"It seems like your friend is having trouble might want to go check on him." Malfoy sighed turning back around.
It had been three months since Harry and Draco had kissed and even though Draco had tried to talk with Harry many times Harry always found excuses not to. Draco was starting to get fed up. He had thought...maybe possible...there was something there.
Draco scrambled off the floor and quickly climbed on top of Harry. He looked down at Harry's dick and gulped. This was the biggest cock he had come across. He licked from the base to the tip and felt Harry shiver beneath him. He swirled his tongue around the tip a couple of times before taking it all in his mouth and going as far down as he could.
"Yes, any Slytherin could have told you that. It likes to watch people, so it often peeks into the windows." Draco mumbled opening boxes and putting things on shelves. He remembered his first night at Hogwarts, he had been woken up by one of his room mates screaming about a giant eye.
“You look so beautiful right now. I can’t wait to see you in my playroom.” Harry sighed reaching over to the nightstand and grabbing a condom. The thought of being in Harry’s playroom made Draco moan with want. Images of different toys ran through his head, he wondered what type of master Harry was. Draco was pulled from him thoughts when he felt the tip of Harry’s cock probe at his asshole.
“So, are you looking to be a slave or looking to be a master or just curious?” Draco asked, he nodded to the other bartender to handle the drinks for a bit while he chatted with Harry.
“When I was done swallowing…nnnh… all your cum I would sit on your lap and…fuck… and slowly lower my self onto your cock tell all of you was deep inside me.” Draco moaned out, Harry was thrusting his fingers in and out of Draco’s hole, at the same time his other hand was teasing Draco’s dick.
“Kneel.” Harry ordered; the huskiness of his voice made Draco shiver with excitement, would there ever be a day that Harry’s voice didn’t cause Draco to break out in goosebumps. Draco gracefully fell to his knee’s in front of Harry, keeping his head lowered.
“I don’t really know myself something just seemed different about you…you seemed more confident. At first, I just thought you had a good break but the more I watched you the more I knew it was something else. You stopped eating as much at meals you would just push the food around and make it look like you eat some.  Then one evening I was by the Black lake and noticed you walking into the forbidden forest.  When you came back you had a lot of rabbit bodies and you dropped them off at Hagrid’s hut. It was that night where it all clicked.” Draco yawned laying down on Harry’s bed. Harry stretched out next to Draco and trailed his fingers down Draco’s neck.
“I can walk!” Draco said clinging to Harry.
“Stand.” Harry instructed watching Draco get to his feet. Harry walked around him and felt his dick twitch in his jeans. Draco looked so beautiful wearing the collar Harry had bought him. He stripped down to his boxers, letting Draco stand there blind to the world, reacting to every sound Harry made. Harry smiled when he saw Draco’s cock was standing at the ready, a bead of precum gleaming on the tip. Harry silently walked behind Draco and suddenly placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders making him jump. Harry snickered to himself while guiding Draco over to the bed. He laid him down and guided Draco’s hands up so he could attach the wrist cuffs to chains on the headboard. He then cuffed Draco’s legs to some chains that hanged from the ceiling, making it so Draco’s legs where spread open and his hips were slightly lifted off the bed.
Draco gracefully fell to the floor, his hands tucked into his lap and his head bowed. Immediately getting into a slave mindset.
"Malfoy?" Harry called out slowly walking around the bathroom. He heard a whimper come from the very last stall and made his way over.
"Fuck Draco you’re so tight." Harry groaned opening his eyes and looking at where they were connected. Oh, merlin he could cum just from that. Seeing Draco's tight hole stretched around his dick was a gorgeous sight. Harry was beating himself up for waiting so long to talk with Draco.
“Harry…. Close… so close Harry.” Draco moaned out touching his forehead to Harry’s. Harry looked at Draco’s face twisted in pleasure before he leaned in and kissed Draco slipping his tongue into Draco’s mouth. The two came together, Draco could feel the hot spurts of cum shoot between their stomachs, Harry pushed deep into Draco shuddering as he came into the condom. They collapsed onto the bed, panting and red in the face.
“As much as I love your outfit lets get you out of it. I want to feel nothing between us.” Harry purred, stripping Draco. Soon both men were laying naked on the bed. They laid facing each other, kissing, and touching wherever their hands could reach. Pressing their bodies together.
“Harry, I want to taste you too.” Draco whispered licking his lips, his mouth watering for the taste of Harry. They readjusted so Draco lay on top of Harry, his asshole on full display for Harry to see (A/N: this would be a horrible time to fart…) and play with. Draco licked up Harrys twitching cock swirling his tongue around the tip before lowering his mouth around it. Harry was big and thick, and Draco loved it. Harry moaned out loud as Draco kept going lower and lower on his cock. He almost came as he watched all his cock disappear into Draco’s sinful mouth.
“Draco! I was wondering if I got you at a bad time.” Harry said, Draco let out the breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
"In the top drawer of the nightstand." Draco responded with a soft moan as Harry shifted his rigid penis brushing against Draco's.
“I’ve had so many about you aaahhh!” Draco groaned.
Draco led Harry into the pathway. They followed it a bit laughing, and giggle tell they hit the end where Draco pushed on another painting slowly and peaked around to make sure there weren't any students or other teachers around. They hurried into Draco's room Harry not missing the fact that the door was a painting of a Dragon.
"Confirming my suspicions, I'm surprised your friend Granger hasn't already figured it out. Must be too busy helping Weasley not fail." Draco chuckled running his hands through his hair which Harry noticed had grown quite long.
“Good point. I want to find someone that will let me blindfold them, tie them down, and have my dirty way with them. I want to find someone that will kneel on the floor in front of me with their mouth wide open ready and waiting for me, I want someone that I can put a collar on so everyone that see’s it knows they are mine. Does that answer your question?” Harry said getting close to Draco’s face and whispering the last part.
“That is quite enough Miss. Weasley. I do not allow unauthorized use of magic in my school. I have also been informed by several male students that you have been harassing them along with harassing Mr. Potter. Your atrocious behavior will not be tolerated, please follow me to my office where we shall discuss whether to expel you or not. Your parents will also been notified of your pending expulsion, now please follow me.” McGonagall huffed giving Ginny a look of disappointment. Ginny paled and silently followed McGonagall out of the Great Hall.
Draco sat there in shock. Harry Potter was offering to have sex with him, Draco Malfoy the boy who teased and bullied him for years.
Draco groaned when Harry finally let go of his neck and licked the bite. He felt Harry slip from him and missed the full feeling immediately.
“We could have, but then I wouldn’t’ be able to look at your amazing body.” Harry smirked earning a glare form Draco. Draco read through the contract with Harry, they ended up crossing some things out that Draco refused to have done to him and established their safe word, dragon. When everything was said and done, they both signed it.
“It pleases me very much.” Harry said standing up from his chair, the paperwork he was working on forgotten. He walked around his desk and stood in front of Draco.
"I'm glad we decided to be friends.” Harry slurred downing the rest of his drink. Draco nodded his head in agreement pouring them both another drink.
Ginny glared at Ron before she could respond though the doors opened and in walked Harry and Draco.
"Yea..." Harry responded pulling out of Draco making the blonde wince.  Harry casted a cleaning charm on himself and Draco, then the bed. He pulled the covers over them both pulling Draco close.
“What if I want you to lose control?” Draco whispered licking the shell of Harry’s ear. Harry smirked to himself, this boy was going to drive him crazy. Harry pulled out and thrusted a few times at different angles closely watching Draco’s face. When Draco let out a gasp and threw his head back Harry knew he had found Draco’s good spot. He continued to hit that spot repeatedly loving the sound of Draco’s sweet moans.
"PLEASE FUCK ME! RAM YOUR DICK INTO ME PLEASE! I WANT IT SO BAD!" Draco shouted grabbing the sheets below him so hard his knuckles turned white. Harry pulled his fingers out smirking at the whine that escaped Draco's mouth and lined himself up before slamming in all at once. At the same time, he bite into Draco's neck moaning loudly as Draco's sweet blood filled his mouth. He pulled out and slammed back in making Draco groan loudly. He slammed into Draco over and over has he sucked blood from his neck. Harry pulled away and licked at the bite mark to get the last of the blood. He looked down at Draco and almost came at the sight he saw. Draco's eyes were hazed over with pure pleasure. His mouth wide open so little moans could escape. A trail of blood left the fresh puncture wounds.
"So there really is a giant squid in the lake!" Harry exclaimed when he saw a giant eye peering through one of the windows in Draco's office. Suddenly the eye moved followed by some tentacles. Then the window was empty, and Harry could see into the lake.
Harry could hear the beats of Draco's heart. He walked forward tell he was standing in front of Draco looking deeply into his eyes.
“I did what?” Harry asked gently moving his fingers in Draco’s hole.
"Look at you practically begging for my cock. Do you want it, do you want my dick inside you? Pounding into your tight hole tell all you can think about is me fucking you senseless?"
"We're here..." Draco said snapping Harry out of his thoughts. He followed Draco into the room closing and spelling the door shut.
“Time for my lunch.” Harry groaned as he licked up Draco’s neck. He could hear Draco’s heartbeat speed up, could feel Draco’s plus under his lips as he kissed the spot he was going to bite. Harry pulled back as tell only the tip of his penis was inside Draco, then he slammed back in, at the same time biting into Draco’s skin. Warm blood flooded his mouth, making Harry moan. Draco came again when Harry started to suck the blood into his mouth. Harry soon followed, shooting his cum deep into Draco. Harry drank Draco’s blood for a bit longer before pulling away. He licked at the bite mark to help it heal faster and to catch the blood that dripped out. Harry gave the bite mark a small kiss before rolling off Draco and to the side. They laid there in silence as they both recovered. Draco rolled onto his side and smiled when Harry curled around him wrapping an arm around his waist.
“One!” Draco yelled out in shock and pleasure. Harry continued to expertly whip Draco in different spots nine more times.
"I'm going to go say hello." Harry said getting up quickly and walking away before his friends could say anything. He walked up to Draco and tapped him on the shoulder.
“Warn me next time you do that!” Draco glared looking down at Harry between his legs. Harry gave Draco a little smile before he pushed one of his fingers into Draco’s tight hole.
"As much as I would love to have sex with you on my front rooms floor let's move this to my bedroom." Harry gasped between kisses moaning when Draco started to kiss and nip his neck.
"You're wearing too much." Harry growled startling Draco out of his trance.
"So sexy." Harry growled out kissing Draco's neck, grabbing a fist fill of blonde hair and pulling so he had better access. Draco moaned loudly and wrapped his arms around Harry. He felt Harry's fangs graze his neck and tensed his eyes going wide.
“Color?” Harry asked rubbing Draco’s legs.
"Suck." He growled out before going back to licking and sucking at Draco's hole. He felt Draco's lips close around his fingers and his tongue move around them. After a minute or two he pulled his fingers out, he brought to the tight hole and slowly pushed one in.
“I’m sorry for what happened today Draco. I know our relationship is a bit weird, and I know its way to soon to talk about love but…I do love you and I want to be with you…I guess what I’m trying to say is I don’t want you to just be my blood donor…I want you to be my boyfriend too…you don’t have to answer right now… I just thought I should make it clear so there wouldn’t be any more misunderstandings, cause I- “Harry was cut off as Draco kissed his lips.
Harry feels a twinge of anger, maybe even desperation. “Why aren’t you using magic?”
"Yes, darling?" Hannah hums as she brushes through Freya's long, brown hair. It's the only thing about her that's not sick, Freya think sometimes and lets her mother take pleasure in putting up her hair in bows and braids.
Draco couldn't resist dropping a kiss on his head, despite knowing it wasn't much in the way of a punishment, " You're stomach's not hurting anymore, is it baby? You're still taking the potions I'm sending you right, every night after dinner?"
"With her constitution...." The healers are always saying, shaking their heads, glancing at Freya in pity."If she was a beta like you two, it might have been easier but..."
Harry lays his head against the stone wall to stop his head from spinning. He’s had too much yet again and the cold wall feels pleasant against his burning forehead.
Roxanne Weasley is the sturdiest among her cousins, but her drug is the Quidditch field rather than dusty, old books. She’d given up five minutes into the study session, staring longingly out of the window. Now her ears perk up in interest. She points discreetly. “Right there, I think. Between Herbology and Potions. She’s sneaky, to be sure.”
Her parents look stunned.
It was Sunday brunch at The Burrow, and the entire brood had shown up unexpectedly, a long time having passed since they’d gossiped about each other(Harry could guess who would feature as this week’s highlight). The sun was mellow, and the long table set out in the garden shone bright and happy with its pink and white checkered tablecloth, laden with gleaming silverware and sunflowers twined into small glasses. Molly was all a-tizzy, but in a good way. The older kids were playing Quidditch further down afield, and the younger kids were screaming and playing a game of tag that made sense only to them. Al was the exception, sitting by in docile patience as Gabrielle chattered with Fleur, Ginny and Audrey, staring at her with dazed eyes.
"I don't know," a voice sounded cheerfully in the black morning, from the portrait of a man with twinkling blue eyes hidden behind half-moon spectacles, "Seems like we're in for quiet an adventure, aren't we?"
"Hey love, why aren't you inside having fun with the others? Uncle Ron is doing his bit, you know.."
Draco hmmed, "Also, don't skip classes."
"Somebody had a late night," Harry said to Teddy, catching the plate that missed Al's head, snoring away into his porridge, by a couple of inches and promptly settling himself on the last empty seat.
"You didn't answer my question Malfoy are you okay?" Harry asked again subconsciously getting closer to the stall door.
"Yeah, I think I'm just going to go to bed." Harry responded standing up and walking out of the great hall.
“I didn’t realize you could be so cheesy.” Draco giggled as Harry chucked the washcloth back into the bathroom.
“So, I heard you cause quite the commotion this morning.” Draco said not looking at Harry.
"Peeves!" Draco yelled pulling his wand out and flicking the door closed again.
"Wait wait wait..." Draco gasped breaking their kiss.
“Harry is just messing around. He really loves me and is just pranking me or something. I mean who wouldn’t want to be with me?” Ginny asked looking around at the people at the Gryffindor table.
“What is wrong?” Blaise said grabbing Draco’s shoulders to get him to stop pacing.
"Scared Potter?" Draco whispered looking deep into the emerald eyes he loves so much.
“Yeah, I’m okay.” Draco mumbled looking ahead. He didn’t want to admit he had been crying especially if he had been completely wrong about what had happened. When they reached the Great Hall, it was lunch time and students were filling in, but Draco didn’t miss the messy head of hair and the bright green eyes that would searching the coward. Sliver eye’s met green, Harry smiled he knew that Draco would come to the Great Hall to get food so after running the around the castle like a mad man he waited by the Great Hall doors hoping to catch Draco before he went in. Draco slowly walked up to Harry.
“Hey guys...” Harry trailed off sitting down across from Ron and Hermione. He pulled Draco to sit next to him. Ron and Hermione stared at Draco for a moment before Hermione broke the silence.
“Let me go, I need to finish getting ready! You already knew I had the job this was just a meeting to get down to what exactly he would need from me as his TA.” Draco laughed breaking free from Blaise and sitting down in front of his vanity. He quickly put on his thigh high boots over his fish net stockings. He then turned to the mirror and started on his makeup. He lined his with black and silver eyeliner making his eye’s pop, he also added a soft pink lip gloss to his lips that softened the whole look.
"Would you believe me if I said it was because I find you extremely attractive?" Harry whispered leaning in close to Draco's ear. Draco choked on his drink in surprise.
“You guys saw the rest of what happened.” Harry said finishing his story, leaving out him being a vampire, he wasn’t quite ready to come out about that.
“Yes, I did. Ginny and I broke up a few weeks after the war. I caught her in bed with some random guy. When I confronted her about it, she just dumped me and went back to the guy. I went on a trip a few days later. That trip really helped me clear my mind and everything… it also helped me realize that I was gay and the only reason I had gone out with Ginny is because everyone expected us to be together. When I got back, I heard from Ron that Ginny had started to date Dean and I thought that was the end. After school started though Dean dumped Ginny to be with Seamus. Ever since then she has been throwing herself at me trying to get me to take her back. I have been tolerating it because she is Ron’s little sister, but I mostly try to avoid her. What happened this morning was another one of her pointless attempts to get back together with me. I swear Draco that I only see her as my best friends’ little sister. Please believe me when I say that you are the one that I want (A/N: oh oh oh honey).  What she did crossed a line and I will never let it happen again.” Harry said looking at Draco who was still staring at the ground.
“I’m glad to know that you find it so easy to talk to me. I hope over the course that you’re my TA we can become…friends.” Harry said giving Draco a shiver inducing smile that seemed more like a smirk.
“Tell me who you belong too.” Harry said smirking at Draco who looked at him wide eyes.
"...I'll mail Severus, he will make the needed potions tell you can. He can also help you at school. Don’t worry Draco everything will be okay." His father reassured putting his arm around his son’s shoulders. Things were okay. Years went by without anyone figuring out Draco's secret. He even through the war Draco's secret remained hidden, tell now. He had returned to Hogwarts to finish his schooling like many of his peers. The new headmistress had set up a special house for the eighth years. Since there wasn't very many of them, they all got a small room to themselves. Which was perfect for Draco because he could brew the potions he needed in privacy. He wishes he had just stayed in his room and feigned being sick. He shouldn't have tried to go to the ingredient closet. His heat had hit him quite suddenly. He thought he had at least a day left before but he was wrong. When he had felt the first wave coming, he ducted into a bathroom. Unbeknownst to him a green-eyed brunette was taking a stroll at the same time and had seen Draco rush into the bathroom. Worried for the blonde he followed. Now he stood in the bathroom inhaling the sweetest most intoxicating scent he has ever smelt.
"Mine!" Harry growled slamming harder into Draco, pushing deeper and deeper. Draco responded with strings of words unable to make a coherent sentence anymore. Harry grabbed Draco's hips lifting them up a bit so he could go harder and faster. Harry grabbed Draco and pulled him up, so he was sitting in Harry's lap bouncing up and down on Harry's cock.
"Ma...I mean Draco...I...need to go. We'll talk...later." Harry said while gently pushing Draco away and getting up. He made his way to the door. He turned and looked back at Draco still sitting on the floor clothes slightly rumbled.
"Malfoy stop that tickles!" Harry giggled gently pushing Malfoy away. Draco smirked and started to tickle Harry. Draco tickled Harry for a few minutes peppering kisses all over his face. Harry rolled them over, so he was on top he kissed Draco deeply and started to grind their hips together moaning at the feeling of their clothed dicks rubbing together.
"How would you help." Harry whispered dragging his fingertips down Draco's neck feeling his pulse.
Draco must have passed out or something because when he opened his eyes it was three in the morning and Harry was asleep next to him, his arm wrapped around Draco's middle and their legs tangled together.
“Tell me what you want starlight.” Harry mumbled against Draco’s chest grinding his cock against Draco’s, feeling the vibrations from the egg vibrator against his own cock.
“Beg for it. Beg for my cock.” Harry demanded, slapping Draco’s ass.
“We have a huge problem!” Draco said in a panic. He couldn’t believe he had run into Harry here of all places.
“I’ve smelled so many peoples blood, but none have smelled as good as yours. I’ve been craving it all day please be my blood donor Draco.” Harry groaned nipping at Draco’s neck.  Harry trailed his fingers down Draco’s shirt unbuttoning it in the process. He pushed Draco’s shirt open and kissed his way down.  He nipped and sucked at Draco’s nipples.  While his mouth was busy sucking on Draco’s pebbled nipple his hands undid Draco’s pants and pushed them down. The blonde raised his hips up and shivered as the cold air hit his painfully hard penis.  Harry licked and sucked his way down tell he reached Draco’s twitching erection. Suddenly Draco’s penis was engulfed in warmth as Harry sucked as much as he could into his mouth. He ran his fangs gently against Draco’s cock as he moved his head up and down. Harry looked up and his green eyes met Draco’s sliver. He then lowered his head tell he could feel Draco’s dick touch his throat.
Draco glanced down at the hand on his arm before looking back into green eyes.
"God, you look so sexy right now." Harry mumbled trailing kisses down Draco's chest going lower and lower. Soon he reached Draco's swollen member. The head a bright red, veins could be seen through Draco's pale skin. He tentatively licked up a vein gently kissing the tip.
“Bloody hell Draco.” Harry said his cock already hardening again. Draco smirked at him before closing -his mouth and swallowing. Harry suddenly grabbed Draco and pulled him up. He led Draco over to the bed and laid him down on it.
“Yeah, I’m okay…it’s just been a while…and…your so big.” Draco respond giving Harry a reassuring smile. Draco let out a small gasp when he felt Harry’s cock grow slightly bigger.
“What’s wrong love? You’ve been sighing a lot.” Harry asked grabbing Draco around the waist and pulling him into his lap. Right now, they were in Harry’s home office. Harry was looking through papers and Draco was tidying the place up, some how no matter the short amount of time between cleanings Harry always managed to make a mess of his office.
They looked at each other, leaned forward and kissed. Harry was about to pull away, but Draco reached up and tangled his fingers into Harry’s hair deepening the kiss. Draco pulled away for a second to move the food out of the way before climbing on to Harry’s lap and continuing their make out session. After a few minutes Draco pulled away and leaned his forehead against Harry’s looking deep into Harry’s eyes.
Harry suddenly runs past a tree with a wanted poster of him, “wait, no no no no no.” he mumbles grabbing the paper. Alecto and Amycus turn back staring at him as he shows them the paper, “they just can’t get my nose right.” The twins shake their heads and continue to run as he stuffs the paper into his satchel.
Malfoy is shocked, and then all anger drains from his face as quickly as it had come. His scent flattens, his expression shutters and Harry wants to bite his tongue. All of a sudden, he doesn’t look that different from the delicate, glass instruments around them; small, empty and painfully fragile; someone who would break at the slightest touch.
He clambers up into Draco’s lap and puts his pudgy arms around his neck. Draco is surprised and puts a hand against his back to steady him. His hair, Teddy notices, smells like liquorice.
, Scorpius pleads quietly,
Draco resurfaces around six o’clock to fetch himself some food and check on his children when he finds them still on the stairs, Lily lying catatonic on Scorp. Draco furrows his eyebrows and is about to ask them what is up, when the door opens and male voices filter in through the door. The two of them spring up like someone has shocked them.
“I do not!”
"Potter, Scorpius!"
James-13, turning 14
“What is with you and this place? Are you kidding me right now?” Harry yells and watches in satisfaction as Draco Malfoy startles and drops the glass he was holding. It shatters with a loud crash, but Malfoy is looking only at Harry, deathly pale.
"Filth, insects, dirt who dare to taint this house purity!—"
"—and then I zoomed past on my broom, turned back to say goodbye even, the idiot—"
"Mom?"
I'm sorry, the healer says. She's got her wand in a crushing grip, knuckles white. She won't meet their eyes. There's nothing we can do, she says.
"I heard muggle music today," Freya whispers, "And it was so pretty, mommy. And if it's that nice for them, then how does magical music sound like?"
Freya tries to stop the tears from flowing, but they just won't stop. "I'm sorry daddy—"
“Merlin, he’s pathetic.”
She doesn't hear the owl, but she does hear her mother start crying, falling down on the sofa, her hands on her face.
"No," Neville says.
"No honey, that's what you call a clear conscience. He came and met me before class. You two should try it sometime, instead of lurking around me guiltily."
Molly tutts, intent on her Charms homework. “You’re supposed to be studying, Lucy. You promised.”
The baby is still breathing the next day.
She turned to argue with Diamond and look for the floo powder at the same time.
Freya stills. "Mum?"
So when he receives a memo from O’Sullivan with a simple forgotten us already, boss? He admits to getting a little sentimental, jumps up from his desk and addresses Okonedo from the corner of his eye as too many bouts of staring him full in the face makes Okonedo extremely flustered. “I’m taking my lunch break.”
All heads turned to him. Lily stumbled up from where she was sitting cross-legged with Scorpius and Rose, shouted "DADDY!" and promptly bashed herself into his knees. She was five, still in her golden retriever stage, and even though she saw Harry daily, she counted her separation from him in dog years. He tugged at her pigtails playfully.
"I'll do something about it," Harry said quietly. Draco did not reply and merely turned his nose up at him. Andromeda and Teddy smirked. James just looked confused.
Freya finds that being an omega means she's ten times more likely to die now. Her parents hover even more than usual, and her father always looks tired. She used to love her little village of Hogsmeade, but now she hates it, because it means that she's that much closer to Hogwarts and that much closer to never getting in.
It was summer, but the weather had decided to take a turn for the worse and the grounds were muddy with rain. Water lashed against the windows, and Rose stared glumly at the endless grey skies. The air inside 13 Grimmauld Place was thick and stifling, the sort of sticky that only happens with summer showers. Worse yet, everybody was home and tempers were running short so Scorpius and Rose had decided to seek refuge in Harry’s study. Scorp was lazing on the sofa, a book held high above his head.
Fred pulls out the bottle carefully, brows furrowed with concentration. They'd wisely decided on him doing the delicate extraction, because James was as subtle as a dragon in an owlery.
This remark hammers the last nail into the coffin of Scorpius' fears and he laughs, burden free and a happy child once more. Inside the house, the children voices falter.
“Hmm?”
"When will it bloody end—"
Hope unfurls slowly inside of him, like a blossom. "Grandma?"
"I seem him," James replied grimly, peering around the corner to where he could distinctly see a mom-shaped figure across the pumpkin patch, talking to Hagrid.
Freya runs down the stairs, and to her horror, trips. She’s on the last flight, and she scrunches her eyes against the inevitable pain that will come when her body meets the ground.
"I told you to stop doing that! They do this all the time, please knock some sense into them Meda!" James was complaining angrily at Andromeda.
The alley is pitch black, and the only light seeping in is from other streets. Whereas Diagon Alley is blazing with life and people, here all shops are closed except one, a small door hidden inside its darkest corner. Dirty, yellow light shines through the store window and everything is quiet, the noise of the shopping district reaching Harry’s ears as if from far away.
Until she spies a small lady, sitting by a huge, shiny black instrument that looks like a bear and she's creating magic with it, magic so beautiful it stops her in her tracks.
“Oh, I have a simple one in here, its right through that door.” Harry said gesturing towards it. Draco quickly walked towards it before he lost his courage. Once inside he made sure the door was locked before quickly stripping his clothes off. Underneath he was wearing one of his best slave outfits. It consisted of chest straps that framed his pecs and had many places to hook the matching cuffs on his wrists. He also wore the matching underwear that exposed his ass, it covered his cock, but it was so snug not much was left to the imagination. Thigh high sheer stockings covered his legs, and he wore no shoes. Draco took a few more deep breaths; it was now or never. He quickly folded his clothes up and left them on the counter before slowly opening the door. He silently made his way over to stand in front of Harry’s desk. His whole body felt warm as he stood there with his arms behind his back. Even though he had worn far more revealing clothes before, this was the first time he had ever worn it outside of his bedroom. Harry had yet to notice Draco and was still intently looking through different papers and marking things on others. Draco cleared his throat. Harry looked up and dropped the pencil he was holding. He looked Draco up and down, his pants suddenly got much tighter.
Draco sat in silence for a moment.
“Does that feel good love?” Harry asked leaning over Draco and playing with his nipples. He pulled one into his mouth and sucked on it, flicking it with his tongue. The other he softly pinched between his fingers and pulled.
"Malfoy..." Harry whispered against the door as the sweet scent got stronger, "Malfoy are you an omega?"
Draco sat on the end of his bed before answering, "there are potions out there that stop heats and others that can suppress scents, Snap would make them for me he taught me how to make them as well, but he usually did it. After he died though I started to make them. I was on my way to the ingredients closet when my heat hit me. I had thought I had more time before it came but...I was wrong." Draco sighed running his hands through his hair.
*Hours Later*
“No, I haven’t, I’ve been out by my favorite tree…I had a lot to think through.” Draco whispered walking again once Pansy caught her breath.
“What’s this?” Harry asked poking at it and making Draco moan.
“Draco! Come in come in.” Harry said stepping to the side to let Draco step in, “Let me take your coat!” Harry said helping Draco shrug it off.
"I mean for everything....for walking away, for locking the bathroom door, for guarding the door all night, helping me get to my room all of it. Thank you....Harry." Draco mumbled purposely looking everywhere but at Harry.
“Yes, now please use that huge dick of yours and ram into my slutty hole.” Draco moaned pushing his hips back to try and get Harry’s dick inside of me.
"God your sexier than I-" Draco was cut off by Harry slamming his mouth onto his and brutally shoving his tongue into Draco's mouth. Draco moaned loudly and wrapped his arms around Harry's neck.
"Bloody fucking hell! Right there right there Harry merlin your dick feels so good." Draco yelled out when his sweet spot was hit. Harry smirked and pounded away at that spot turning Draco into a mess.
"Yeah. I'll help you get to your room." Harry said shocked that Draco had not only asked for help but had also said please for the third time and had used Harry's first name. He quickly undid the locking spell and stepped back letting Malfoy decide when to open the door.
“What time is it?” Draco asked stretching as Harry put the tray down in front of him.
“Follow.” Harry commanded, Draco quickly stood up and turned towards the sound of Harry’s voice. He saw Harry standing at a bookshelf and went to him. He stood just behind Harry keeping his head bowed the whole time.
“I can do that.” Harry said starting to get up.
“Oh, quite it, you know you like it.” Harry said climbing back onto the bed, he pulled the blanket over both him and Draco. He pulled Draco close to his side and wrapped his arms around him.
“Why yes I am.” Blaise responded sassily.
"You want to become my blood donor?" Harry asked shocked.
“Fuck, please fuck me with your huge dick Harry, please fuck my hole and fill me with your cum, fuck me so hard I can’t walk, fuck me tell my hole takes your shape, make me all yours!” Draco begged loudly pushing against Harry’s hands.
“You.” Draco whispered.
"Welcome to 12 Grimmauld place. My godfather Sirius Black left it to me. Who if I remember correctly is your cousin?" Harry said grabbing Draco's hand and leading him inside.
“Can I get a scotch on the rocks please?” A deep voice asked, Draco got the drink ready and turned to hand it to the person and froze.
"Harry, it feels so good. You feel so good!" Draco rambled not thinking straight anymore. Harry just groaned loudly before burying his face into Draco’s neck. He could feel his stomach muscles tighten, he was close.
“Are you okay love?” Harry asked looking at Draco’s face that had just a hint of pain on it.
"Of course, you would be the one to find me Potter." Malfoy gasped out pushing himself against the stall door praying Potter would just go away.
"The great Harry Potter is a vampire." Draco said stepping into the moonlight. Harry took a deep breath and held back a groan, it just had to be Malfoy. Draco looked more like a vampire then Harry did, with his pale hair and skin...his sliver eyes that reflected the moonlight perfectly, making them look like they were glowing.
"I wasn't runn-" Harry cut himself short...he had been running away, "I'm sorry Draco. You're right I was running away. I was confused, I suddenly felt this strong attraction towards you, and it scared me. I  had a lot of things to figure out and I'm sorry Draco. I shouldn't have avoided you and just told you that I needed time." Harry said slouching his shoulders like a huge weight had just been lifted from them.
"You would be correct. I saw you...at a certain club a couple of nights ago." Harry trailed off looking away from Draco and blushing, “I was wondering if maybe... "
"Yes I am. Can you blame me though? We're both naked and your ass is just too perfect not to hump." Harry sighed grinding his dick between Draco's ass cheeks. He licked a line up Draco's neck smirking when Draco let out a little moan. He thrusted a few more times between Draco's ass cheeks before slowly nudging at his hole.
"Yes...are you?" Harry asked blushing like crazy.
*A few minutes earlier in the Great Hall*
“I’m glad you and Potter finally fucked. All that heated staring at each other was getting old.” Pansy joked earning a gently slap from Draco.
“We’re here.” The driver said pulling up to a decent looking house. Draco paid him and got out. He stood on the street for a moment just looking at the place. He took a couple of deep breaths and walked up to the door before he could knock it swung open.
“Draco? Are you there?” Harry questioned looking at his phone to see if they were still connected.
"Come in." Draco yelled cringing at the horrible handwriting of the essay he just picked up. He heard the door open then close but the person who came in didn't say anything. He looked up and glared.
“I missed you so much Harry! I know your just playing a prank on me and its okay I forgive you. Now come one lets go seat down.” Ginny giggled pulling at Harry’s arm.
“Draco!” Blaise yelled from the other side of the bar. Draco hadn’t realized that Blaise had taken over for the other bartender or that it had gotten busy. He had been caught up in his own little world with Harry.
"Mmi nheed boo cwlean it fbrist" Draco mumbled around Harry's dick.
“I’m going to get so spoiled by you aren’t I.” Draco said standing up so Harry could take off his outfit.
"Hello Draco, how are you doing these days?" Harry asked sitting himself beside Draco.
“This goes over everything that I would want from a slave, it also lists everything that I am willing and capable of doing. I want to go over it and see what you are willing to have done to you, essentially I want to make sure we are on the same page and I want to set up a safe word with you.” Harry said handing the contract to Draco.
“Yes, I am. I’m terribly sorry for being late Professor.” Draco responded moving forward and sticking out his hand.  Harry grabbed it and held it tightly before releasing it.
Harry smirked into Draco's neck before nipping at his ear.
"Yes, but it will have to be in my office. I still have some stuff to unpack." Draco sighed knowing that if he said no Harry would just follow him around until he agreed to talk.
“It was brilliant really. So, she Weasley was hanging on Potter because Thomas broke up with her so he could date Finnigan, so she is hanging all over him and he just looks annoyed. Then out of no where she kisses him,” Draco flinched but Pansy continued not noticing, “Potter just snaps suddenly and starts screaming at her saying that he never actually wanted her and that he only dated her cause that what everyone wanted from him and that he was actually gay and never found her attractive and that she should find someone else to throw herself at cause he was never taking her back then he storms out of the hall. The look on her face as she was left sitting there with everyone staring at her was so hilarious.  Her face turned as red and her ratty hair I wish you could have seen it.” Pansy laughed remembering Ginny’s face.
“Merlin’s dick Draco that was fucking hot.” Harry groaned slamming into Draco.  He grabbed Draco’s long hair tightly making Draco arch his back. With his free hand he started to smack Draco’s plump cheek tell it was red.
"Spit it out Potter."
“Good.” Harry said suddenly pushing a finger into Draco’s hole, “Cause we’re far from done.” He smirked watching as Draco’s softened cock started to get hard again. By the time Harry was done prepping Draco’s hole, Draco was rock hard again. Harry took his boxers off his throbbing cock popping up. He climbed back on the bed and rubbed himself against Draco’s ass.
“Draco, I’m close.” He groaned into Draco’s neck.
“You correctly heard Draco…I did say I love you last night and I had wanted to say it this morning. I’m sorry you got hurt because I didn’t set Ginny straight sooner but please know that I love you.” Harry sighed kissing Draco again. Draco tried to hold the tears back, but he just couldn’t. Draco sobbed and threw his arms around Harry’s neck. Suddenly Draco’s stomach rumbled loudly.
“As you saw Ginny Weasley didn’t take the news too well and even tried to hex me. From what Harry has told me she cheated on him and then dumped him, started dating Thomas when school started but was dumped by Thomas so he could be with Finnigan-”
“We have school tomorrow; I can’t show up in the same thing I wore earlier.” Draco said the thought of wearing the same dirty clothes made him want to gag.
*Back with Draco*
"You...want to have...sex with....me?" Draco asked leaning forward a little bit.
"...I actually want to... offer my help." Draco whispered his heartbeat getting faster.
“Your late.” Blaise sang as Draco rushed into their shared dressing room.
“Let’s have our tea over here. It’s much more comfortable.” Harry said sitting down on one side of the couch. Draco came over and sat on the other side turned slightly so he could see Professor Potter er Harry.
“Don’t say things like that love, you have no idea how good you feel wrapped around my cock, hearing you say things like that are going to make me lose control.” Harry groaned dropping his head on to the bed next to Draco’s shoulder.
"That was... "
“Tell me about yourself Draco.” Harry said putting some sugar in to Draco’s drink.
"Draco…bloody hell Draco I can't hold it anymore I'm going to cum!" Harry panted out thrusting harder and faster into Draco.
“I’m CUMMING!” Draco yelled out cum shooting from his untouched dick onto the bed below him.  Harry kissed the back of Draco’s neck before biting into it again. At the same time, he thrusted as deep as he could go and shot his cum out filling Draco again. After a second Harry let go of Draco’s neck smirking at the second bite mark, he had left.  Draco flinched when Harry pulled his dick out of his ass. Harry whispered a cleaning spell and adjusted their positions, so Draco was laying on his chest. Soon they were both asleep.
"You have no idea how long I've wanted to do this." Draco panted pushing Harry's shirt off and running his hands over the tight muscles.
"Ready for round two?" Harry asked teasing Draco's hole.  Draco's response was to push back onto Harry forcing Harry's cock inside a bit. Both of them were wide awake now.
"I want to like your dick. I want your huge cock in my mouth. Please let me lick your cock." Draco gasped sticking his tongue out. Draco couldn’t figure out what came over him, but he wanted to please Harry, he had never acted this desperate for any of his past boyfriends/fuck buddies. If anything, he was the one making them beg.
“Very funny Harry like you would ever date a Slytherin especially one that was a death eater.” Ginny huffed glairing at Draco. Draco flinched and rubbed his arm that had the mark.
"Not hungry mate?" Ron asked loading up his plate for the third time. Or was it fourth?
"Is that amazing smell coming from you Malfoy?" Harry questioned trying to push the stall door open only to find it locked.
“Are you sure you want to walk in there together? We could walk in separate…” Draco asked stopping just before Harry could open the doors and pulling his hand away.
"Ron it's been five years; we are no longer children let's not be petty." Harmonie sighed sipping her wine. Harry just laughed and sipped his whiskey glancing at the platinum blond that was currently standing at the bar. Not much had changed since school. He still looked handsome almost model like. Harry glanced around and already saw some women and even men looking over at Draco.
"Oh, just shut up and kiss me." Draco gasped lunging forward, smashing his lips against Harry's. Draco didn't know if it was the heat or not, but he didn't really care right now. Harry had just admitted he found Draco attractive, and Draco wasn’t going to miss this chance.
“Hello Harry, I hope things are better now, you seemed quite upset the other day.” Hermione said tucking the book she had been reading before all the commotion away in her bag.
“Good, I’ve got a surprise for you in our room, why don’t you go put it on and meet me back here when you’re done.” Harry said with a smirk giving Draco a quick peck on the lips. Draco hopped off Harry’s lap and hurried out of the office hoping Harry didn’t notice the blush that was spreading across his face from Harry calling it their room. He rushed down the hall and up the stairs towards their room and burst into the room. He looked around and saw the surprise on the bed. Draco slowly walked over to it and shivered. Harry had chosen a slave outfit for him. It had a metal ring that would rest at the center of Draco’s chest. Five straps were attached to said ring, two went over his shoulder’s, two around his chest, and the fifth one went down his abdomen and attached to another metal ring that would rest just above his navel. That also had five straps attached to it. Four went around his waist, two on each side, one went straight down to attach to another metal ring that would fit around Draco’s cock. Another strap would go between his legs and up his back to connect to the metal ring in the middle of his back where all the straps connected. There were also four arm bands and two ankle cuffs for him to wear, two for his wrists and two for his upper arms, all could be connected to his outfit . All the straps were adjustable. Draco noticed that a collar was missing. Collaring could be compared to getting married in the SM world. It was like wedding band to let everyone know that the slave belonged to a certain master, it also let other slaves know the master was taken. Draco also saw that there was a pair of sheer stockings that would attach to a garter belt made of the same material as the slave outfit. Draco quickly put everything on. He debated weather or not he should put his hair up but decided that he would let Harry decided how his hair should be, he made sure to have a hairband just in case. Once he had everything on and adjusted, he made his way back to the office. He gave a gentle knock on the office doors.
Puppy crushes, or pining throughout the ages.
"Grandmother," Neville hisses. Daddy and great granny start arguing,
Scorpius smiles and Harry smiles back. "What do you think?"
"Oh, is that your daughter?" Some women asks, tone soft and pitying.
Teddy-19
"Auror hazing," Andromeda sighed. "I'm not sure I'm fond of it."
Harry drops his wrist almost like it burned him, and pedals back so fast his head hits the lantern hanging behind him. “Fuck!” Harry mutters as he grips his head.
Freya shakes her head mutely.
“The way you go on, it’s almost like you’ve forgotten the wild and colorful moments of your own teenage life, Teddy because I certainly haven’t.” Draco sniffed as he walked away. He was walking rather quickly.
Basic Idea of Draco's robe
“Real music.” Teddy scoffed. “That’s why he listens to her right. Right. Totally. I believe that.”
And the quiet! Oh, the quiet. She watched, in silent delight, the swirling vapours rising from her cup and closed her eyes to the gentle
"Ducky, what's wrong?" He felt his father place his big, warm hand on his neck, gripping him gently, pulling his head up.
Fred springs up, dusting himself off. “ Nah, it’s okay. I should've known. Saw you falling and fashioned myself a hero. At least you’re not hurt right?”
"Honey, I'm coming in." Draco warned as he opened the door to a domain few dared to tread alone. A land of nightmares, unmentionable horrors and unwashed socks...the bedroom of his teenage son.
Scorpius-11, turning 12
"Distinguished," His father added helpfully, carding his fingers through Scorpius' hair.
His musings were immediately cut short when Al, on spotting him, held up a sign to the window.The window was facing Hector's back and the rest of the class was focused on their work. Except for one.
Malfoy doesn’t fall for it this time. He fetches a pan and duster and asks Harry politely. “Do you want to buy something?”
"Fred, are you—"
Rose-11, turning 12
of sugar cubes falling into her tea.
"You can try," Dimple replies wryly, dodging Fred expertly. "But even that can't save you now."
Albus Severus Potter and his younger twin brother were born exactly seven minutes apart, to completely flabbergasted parents. Imagine their surprise when instead of one particularly fat baby, they had been bestowed with two relatively fit ones. Lucius Malfoy often bemoaned the pestilent gene that was the 'Potter Mop,' something that struck without care and consequence for the Malfoy line. He'd sighed in defeat when his second grandchild, too had been unable to escape it but then had proceeded to give a rather unmanly shriek when he'd spied a second baby coming his way.
Harry feels a wave of sadness come over him. The alley now stands empty, and nothing much except his nightmares scare him anymore. The euphoria had washed off long ago, and they were all suffering the effects of the war in their own ways. Harry suffered by completely shutting down. He slept alone, room locked. Ginny had tried, but he didn’t blame her for losing patience. You couldn’t have a relationship with a tightly latched box that refused to open.
Madam Bletchley was playing on the radio but was overshadowed by the cacophony of voices. The scents assaulted him at once, like they always did, but the noise made him wince.
"—and practically by the tail, I was on him so fast," James was babbling at Teddy, who was not even pretending to listen, sitting next to the kitchen table, clutching his head. He was moaning slightly but James did not seem to care, detailing all of his fancy Quidditch moves. Andromeda and Draco were behind it, wands waving as food flew across the room.
"What is he doing here?" Albus hissed, huddled next to James, "It's not even Halloween yet, I haven't even had the chance to do anything. It has to be about you. He got fifteen letters about you last year. Okay, maybe there was this one time, and I've been known to....'course, it can never be goody two shoes Scorp, who couldn't even be bothered to ditch fifth period Potions—"
"Must be your imagination, Potter," Lorcan Scamander replied, rolling his eyes as the class tittered nervously.
“You three.” Molly sighs, scratching her neck with a straggly-looking Quill. Unable to help herself, she follows their gaze and chances a peek. “Oh my.”
"Where did you go?" Scorp snaps a finger into her face, and Freya blinks. She smiles and shakes her head.
"They didn't tell you?"
He smells it, the scent of an omega in extreme distress and his train of thought extinguishes like a candle’s flame. The scent of liquorice overwhelms him, and his head spins like it did when he was drunk but it’s different now, his focus is thrown into extreme relief and he thinks,
Draco is in the middle of hurrying down the stairs, hands laden with all the Potions orders he has to brew before the end of the week when he stumbles upon Lily and Scorpius sitting idle on the steps.
“Everybody’s coming so it was going to be really noisy.” Scorp replies hastily. “I just wanted some quiet, I guess.”
“You were the one who attacked me!” He spits at him, practically vibrating on the spot. “You have the audacity to come into my place of work shouting and demanding answers like you’re God of the Wizarding World or something and then you...you
Fred grins again. “Well then all was not in vain, huh?” He winks and extends his arm. Before Freya can figure out what’s happening, he’s tucking a curl behind her ear and then taking the steps two at a time. “Try the kitchen, I think Scorp’s hiding there!”
Draco runs up to him, “ok, you’re right. You need to protect me from the ruffians and thugs while seeing the lights.”
“N..no, sir!” Harry defended “I..I…” he trailed off as Narcissa brought her hand to Lucius’s face. “I promise it wasn’t me!”
“Sir, in my world, when I was facing off with an evil dark wizard, I walked into that forest alone prepared to die if it meant saving my friends and the people I haven’t met yet. I have made such good and close friends already, whom I would gladly give up my life for.”
Snape scoffed as he rolled his eyes, “Of course you haven’t! And besides, don’t you know wizards have their own culture, traditions, and religion? Like muggles.”
“What kind of tea do you tea Draco?” Snape asks as he sorts through the abundance of tea in the drawer.
“I agree Fred.”
Harry fought the urge to sneer at them before forcing a smile to leave.
The library was huge, more so than the one in his ‘dimension’. Harry sees people he recognizes, but they look far different from the people he is used to. His heart aches at the sight to see people he thought he hated abused in such an inhumane way and people he thought he loved are the causes of the pain and suffering.
“Treacle Tart”
Harry could hear Seamus and George laughing behind him making fun. “Such a girls scream” George noted as Seamus laughed agreeing with him by patting his shoulder.
“He is not Harrison, Lucius please believe me.” Snape reasoned wincing at Lucius’s raised tone.
“The supreme, may be forever reign on us, and the lady’s and lords, your parents were one of them my lord” Nott explained as he shakily took a bite of his chicken.
Professor Potter smiled at the class, “Please sit, and I’m sorry to report that, today will be a boring subject.” The entire class groaned. Lily nodded in agreement. The only reason why she chose this subject to teach instead of muggle studies, was that she believed she can make it fun for these bright young students. After all, history was very important.
His ‘friends’ looked at him strangely. “I..I have homework to do, and his screams are not helping” Harry said with an authoritative tone.
In all honesty, Harry thought if this is how Poppy would have acted in his world, he was glad Alice and Frank were in St. Mungo's. Harry felt guilty for thinking that, but it is something that cannot be helped when the new people he just met are just plain evil.
“I am teasing you...Idiot.” Bellatrix rolled her eyes in contempt before she let out a soft sigh, I can’t bear children anymore.” Bellatrix’s eyes watered as soft tears raced down her porcelain face. “During the first war...there was a really bad battle,” Bellatrix summoned a cloth as she wiped her tears before blowing her nose. “I got into a duel with Molly.”
Dumbledore nodded, “Of course you will do exceptional Harrison, after all, you are your mother’s son.” he chuckled as he popped a lemon drop in his mouth. “I remember your mother coming in and out of this office when she was a student, absolutely terrified for exams. But she did well...top of the class actually.”
Draco’s was sitting down back to a metal fence as his wrists were tied to it tightly. Draco was bleeding as it shown on his head and how it soaked through his rags. Even with the dirt and blood stain on his hair, the platinum still showed through in the sunlight, his pale skin, even though covered in cuts and bruises, Harry wanted to touch, he wanted to heal him, to hug him, letting him know it will be alright.
Nott sat next to him as his hands shook to grab a chicken leg. The pair was quiet as they both ate softly.
Harry tensed up feeling disgusted at her lips that touched his cheek. He slowly got out of her grip giving her a small smile, "Ginn...erva, I am glad to be here." he spoke in a formal tone as she smiled softly.
Harry felt extremely guilty. He knew nothing of wizarding traditions and customs. He always wondered why the Slytherins and purebloods and some half-bloods of other houses never celebrated Christmas, Halloween or Easter at Hogwarts. He now knew why. Hogwarts never celebrated any wizarding holidays or even taught wizarding traditions. They had muggle-studies for the purebloods and half-bloods, but never wizarding studies for the Muggle-borns.
George tosses the picture on the ground a few feet in front of Draco, “here fusty, this is the only way you will see your parents.” Draco warily eyes the photo before reaching out to grab it, but before Draco could George whispers out, “incendio” towards the picture causing it to burst into flames.
“Water”
Suddenly a tall man came into view towering over Harry. Harry looked up wincing at the furious face dawning on him. The man had tan skin with dark hair and eyes. Harry knew he recognized this man, but he could not put his finger on it, as the man bent down scooping Alexander in his arms taking him away.
“Don’t worry love, lets practice it on Ronald’s slave” Fred said, “Will that be ok Ronald?” Ronald looked at his brother smiling, “No worry’s Fredrick, that little nobody is yours”
"Merlin, I'm beginning to think Hermione Jean is rubbing off on you" she teased.
“Because the picture of you and Draco as a baby got ruined and Draco is really upset, so I wanted to give this to him.”
Draco nodded laughing, “it is extremely funny how she chases the red dot and when she leaps at it, her little body does this funny little twist!”
Harry finally stood face to face with his parents. His mother looked beautiful as seen in the pictures.  Her fiery red hair and the brightest emerald green eyes, wearing a long ruby red dress which held as a corset showing extenuating her curves. Her hair was in a braided like a crown as she wore a diamond choker. His dad, stood tall and broad. His raven black hair slicked into a quiff not showing the signature mess of the Potter hair. His eyes were sharp and dark. He wore black pants with a black buttoned up shirt. He was wearing a long heavy cape held together by a chain with medallions of the Potter crest.
“I need to hear you say it Draco,” Snape growled threateningly “I will rather kill you myself.”
Professor McGonagall still taught Transfiguration. She looked like the person when Harry first met her. Tall, severe-looking, with lips thin that pursed together, which made her look angry. She was still wearing her dark emerald robes, her black hair slicked back and tied up into a bun. However, she did not wear her hat.
“You don’t think I know that Dahlia?” Snape bellowed out, tears in his eyes. “It is true. I am a coward. I let my only godson suffer in the hands of someone else without doing anything to stop it. It hurts me every day knowing what he goes through. Knowing I have the power to just whisk him away into the loving arms of his parents and end his torture but I don’t. Because I’m scared Dahlia, if the order finds out I betrayed them, we WILL NEVER WIN.”
“So you can destroy it in his face again?” Lucius commented harshly, “we all know you were responsible.”
Harry looked out the window again to see Dahlia. Her hands were tied in her back with rope as she was constantly pushed around in the crowd. Harry winced as he saw a nasty hex being cast at Dahlia who shuddered in pain as she looked like she was refusing to scream to give them the satisfaction.
Harry gulped hating himself for the words coming out of his mouth, “What are you standing there for fusty, take me to my quarters.”
A bolded red box caught his attention. It read,
Dahlia smiled at her soon to be nephew, “Ok Draco darling, let go of your boyfriend now.”
Snape's face immediately frowns, “I don’t know what you see in him Draco,” he drawls. “He might be good at quidditch, but he is an ok excuse for a wizard.”
Harry let out a sigh as he found a small corner in the library behind some shelves as he slid down the wall landing hard on his butt. Wincing at the sharp pain echoing throughout his body, Harry brought his knees up to his chest as he hugged his legs. He felt so lost in this world, he absolutely had no idea what to do.
Harry seen Draco as he lifted his head up with tears in his eyes at his friend and Harry could see him biting his lip.
Draco’s eyes went wide. “What?”
Theo beamed at Harry’s words, “Oh Merlin, this is so exciting!” he cheered as Harry twinkled with the boy’s enthusiasm.
Harry struggled to breathe, as he felt tears brim his eyes feeling his trachea being crushed painfully. “I..” Harry gasped softly, as his hands went to the ones on his neck. Harry felt the forearm loosen ever so slightly. “I wanted to see if you were going to hurt Draco,” he coughed out.
“The snuggly duckling,” Draco mutters softly as he eyes the quaint cottage. It looked pretty safe, the duckling on the sign is pretty cute. He already named it Steve. He feels Harry’s arm on his shoulders, “this is the best place around, 10/10.” Harry tells Draco.
“That’s Draco’s baby.” Harry finally spoke smiling at the kitten who looks baffled at the new person holding her.
“Oh Harrison, it was just supposed to be a friendly game! What in the world happened,” the bright red haired girl wailed.
“Are you serious fusty?” Fred’s voice boomed as a loud slap was heard followed by a loud cry. “Those are worthless now!” Harry sees a bright red handprint on the pale cheek on the blonde.
As Harry walked to the courtyard he heard familiar voices coming out of a room. Harry racked his head to where he heard those familiar voices. Not wanting to get caught he tried to find a hiding space in the hallway but there were no rooms down this narrow hall. Harry tried to turn around but in the distance, he could see Cho, Lavender, and Parvati sitting down on the benches in the window. Not wanting to go there again, he turned back around stumbling slightly at the sight before him.
“So who died in the war, who got imprisoned and who escaped?” Harry asked as he rushed out his questions.
Draco grabs a brush as his mother sits in the chair. He kneels down nervously as he begins to sing the special song that makes his hair glow and help his mother. He doesn’t understand why it needed to be done every time, but he does it anyway because no one questions Bellatrix.
“I love you, Uncle Sev,” Draco whispered softly.
“I will contact you soon Potter,” Snape says swiftly as he hastily makes an exact out the corridor.
“Me and George want to open up an everything shop, if you want it we got it!” Fred cheers, “don’t we George?”
“So, you all didn’t answer my question, Where is Draco?”
“But in order to do that, you and your friends will need to help me, will that be ok?”
Frank hits her hard in the middle of her back causing Dahlia’s eyes to tear up in pain, “your mouth will get you in serious trouble fusty,” Harry could see Frank mouth the words in her ear they headed inside the castle.
“Cookies are always a classic comfort food”. Harry spoke. Nott looked at him nodding as he took another bite. Harry bit his lip wondering where to go with this conversation. “I also am a fan of chocolate frogs, those little buggers”.
“Thank you,” Harry says as he goes to his private bathroom to take a shower and clean up before getting ready for the day. As he gets out, he notices his Hogwarts robes on the bed. “We still wear the robes?” he asks as he grabs it to put it on.
Hermione Jean shook her head, “Honestly Ronald, you want to be an Auror, and you need NEWT level potions in order to even get considered.”
The King and Queen woke up to their child’s cry as they ran to the nursery in shock with their child gone and the window open.
“N..No m..m..my Lady,” Draco stuttered out gasping shakily trying to get up.
Harry smiled, “cute nickname.” Harry couldn’t wait to tease Theo about his actual nickname. He was not going to let Theo hear the end of it. Over the past months, Harry has gotten closer to the brunette and he was proud to call Theo a brother.
Harry felt so awkward at the dinner table, only making polite conversation when asked a question. He wanted this dinner to end badly, so he can have a proper family dinner with Theo.
Feeling confident with Harry’s recommendation, he walks in before gasping in fear as he jumped into harry’s arms holding tight. Before his very eyes were the ruffians and thugs his mother warned him about. He sees a bunch of red haired people staring at them. They were wearing leather with weapons surrounding them, which caused Draco to whimper and place his face in Harry’s neck.
Theo opened his mouth looking at Harry wide eyes, “uh what?”
“Afternoon Lily” Dumbledore’s voice boomed with happiness. “How are you both?”
Harry held the object in his hand as he stared at the blonde couple gathering up enough courage to ask his question.
Harry grunted out pointing to his mouth again smiling.
Harry tuned out of listening into the conversation when a small boy who looked 4 years old come up to him. The boy was sucking his thumb. He had dark black hair with light skin and bright blue eyes. The young boy was a little chubby, but that was just baby fat. Harry smiled at the young one as he knelt down to his height. “Hi, little one what’s your name?” Harry asked softly.
“Uno is my favorite card game,” Draco says dreamily his silver eyes huge with joy. Harry felt himself get lost into the silver orbs. Throughout these past few weeks, he has been spending time with the blonde. Draco was not like anything Harry could have imagined. Draco was hilarious and always making witty puns, and despite being tortured, starved, humiliated, and deprived of basic human needs, Draco always found a way to look into the positive side of things. Harry grew to respect and admire Draco for that.
Suddenly there was commotion outside as palace guards were coming around the corner.
Professor McGonagall looks at him. “Is something the matter, Mr. Potter?” she asks.
“When we were in the slave quarters” Draco responded fiddling with his fingers.
“Pumkin Juice”
“Mr. Potter?”
Harry shook his head. “Well take me to them Nott.” Nott stared at him with shock.
The tight dress collar around his neck was making him itchy, the robes were too tight around his arms and making matters worse, Ginerva kept putting her filthy hands on him and kissing his jaw.
Harry gave a weary smile and nodded, “You know me….”
“Harrison…well it was…but remember when your own mother taught the history of magic right?” George said looking at Harry confused. “How the entire system use of magic was changed after the war”
Harry rolled his eyes. He didn’t care what this Lily accomplished. “Can I help you sir?” he asked trying to hide his annoyance.
“What about what I lost Sirius? I lost Narcissa, who was always the precious child...and she never had to do any work.” Andromeda screeched waving her hands wildly. “Andromeda stop taunting your sister, Andromeda watch over Narcissa, Andromeda make sure Narcissa is okay!”
Hermione Jean came up with someone behind her. The girl had dirty blonde hair, due to the fact it was barely washed. Her body looked extremely skinny and malnourished like the rest of the slaves. Her blue eyes looked dull and she looks to be struggling to carry the books.
----------
“Where am I?’ He asks, his voice sounding different. He sees someone looking at him with worry. This person had red hair a hard face and hair slicked to the side. What he was wearing baffled Harry. He looked like he was wearing a red and gold cape attached to two metal plates on his shoulders, one a sigil and the other plain. “Ron?” Harry asked in confusion. The red head looked confused.
----------
“Practicing for your finals students?” He asked smirking at the sight of Draco tied up and face scrunching up in pain. Harry shook his head thinking there was no way Remus would ever have agreed to this, but then again this wasn’t his Remus. Harry badly wanted to go home but taking one look at Draco, he knew he had to help the platinum blond and his friends before ever going back.
Lily chuckled at Tom’s glare, “look at the little fusty, getting all upset because Sev betrayed him,” she teased to a laughing Snape. Harry thought he saw a hint of smugness and amusement in Tom’s eye, but it was quickly hidden again by a hard glare.
Harry grimaced at the thought, “I’m not nervous sir…I’m just tired…you know exams and all” Harry lied taping his fingers on the table slowly.
“I’m not sure what you want me to say my lord”, Nott replied softly. Harry let out a small sigh, “j..just tell me what happened with the war that led to this”, Harry said gesturing his arms wildly when he said ‘this’.
“Look...Potter, I know what he did in your world and I know what the other Knights did, but they are completely different people, like how your Hermione and Ron are different from Hermione Jean and Ronald here.” Snape said.
Harry stared at Dumbledore. This is not what he was expecting. This evil old man is the leader of the order of the burning chicken, talking to him about a Quidditch match. He smiled politely already planning to lose this match to Hufflepuff.
“Puuuuuuttttttt onnnnnnnn aaaaaaaaaa showwwwwwwww!” Alecto sang out to a laughing Alexander who clapped his hands with excitement.
“The Supreme, may he forever reign”, Theo mumbles softly.
“Why are you coming with me? And I’m pretty sure I have a backpack for my books” Harry comments looking around the room for a black backpack
Harry snorted, “yes the wonderful world of magic, where science is not a factor.” Harry knows magic is very complex, there is no believable scientific explanation on how wizards and witches had magic, and even how magic was created.
“The Dark Lord?” Harry asks. Theo still shakes his head in confusion.
“Severus??” a loud but hushed voice yelled. Harry stared at the voice his mouth open. He was looking at Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix did not look like the one in his world, with messy and knotty hair, gaunt yellow skin, have a crazy look in her eye. This Bellatrix looked absolutely breathtaking. Her hair was black as night and actually showing the signature Black curls. She was pale with sharp facial features which seemed to bring out her beauty even more. Her dark eyes were sharp with dominance and ambition and Harry would not want to cross her as her stare burned through Harry’s scalp.
Draco’s eyes widened at the sight of food before him staring at Harry. Harry gently nodded giving Draco a slice of pizza. “I think you will like this Draco.”
Remus shook his head and stepped in between the Slytherin and Gryffindor, “come on, we are not children anymore, we should be rejoicing because we won the first battle.”
“Don’t worry Andy, we will get them both back,” Lily spoke out, her soft voice echoing in the room.
. She's not that good at talking, and she stutters sometimes when she meets her, but then she gets to play, and that makes everything alright.
They needed to proceed with damage control, now that things had progressed so far. The sign was seared into his brain.
Draco stepped out of McGonagall's Office, and turned to find his two children scrambling to their feet, watching him with tentative expressions. They had been waiting for him, then.
“Joshua Packton.” Scorpius blurted suddenly.
Rose didn’t waste any time and grabbed Scorp into a tight, long hug. She didn’t need to say anything for Scorp to understand. They’d been together since they were babies.
"Yes. My mum. Al has her eyes, but you're the one that most reminds me of her. You're patient with your brothers, even when they're getting you in trouble. You're a good influence on them, and gentle. You're just as smart as a Malfoy, but you're not arrogant about it. You're different from the rest of us, because you're the perfect mix of us all."
One morning at the Potter household.
"She's been messing around with the portrait, even when we managed to move it to the closet upstairs," Draco sighed and reminded Harry of the long, painful battle they(Harry, Draco, Ron, George, Lucius and Neville) had waged against the portrait of Sirius' mother one summer past. "It fascinates her."
Thankfully, Louis didn’t comment on his habit for casual stalking and seemed rather touched, putting his hand against his chest in a soft gasp. “Tony! Oh my gosh, that is so thoughtful of you!”
“It’s a travesty.” Al kept grumbling as he pulled out the books he’d stashed away so eagerly when he'd returned home. “I shouldn’t have to look at these until the day before term starts. Summer homework should be banned.” He gave a shudder for emphasis.
Her mum watches her like a hawk and always notices when Freya's legs start to tremble, even when she doesn't want her too, even when she hates her for it a little bit.
, if you know what I mean."
Al was in the process of getting up, but wires were crossed. His eyes widened, and his feet tangled up. He tripped out of the chair and into the ground, taking the folding chair along with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fred turns back and resumes wrangling the lock on the door with his pin. They were currently on their way to break into Harry's study, and from thereon into his Firewhisky cabinet.
Teddy flushed. “You’re not above this! I can literally see you walking to the owlery!”
"Bewitch me one more time, eh?" Came an amused voice behind Draco's shoulder that made James freeze in horror and Draco grasp the bridge of his nose in resignation.
“She’s adorable.” Louis giggles. “Mum would approve, Mika.”
Teddy watches in awe from behind a chair leg for a while, grasping it to steady himself. Draco notices him, smiles and Teddy is struck shy. He peers down at his small toes and shuffles.
McGonagall's mouth twitched but her expression remained stern, "I believe some fire incidents, recent monstrous behavior from Peeves, and certain missing books from the Restricted Section can be attributed to one or two of your offspring."
"What on earth?" Draco's surprised voice is razor thin, and slices through the room like a weapon.
magical enough for Hogwarts.
“Sorry.” Rose managed to mumble. “I just...it’s embarrassing.”
"Mum said you had a weak heart, and that you needed a lot of potions to keep it beating," Rose had chimed in hesitantly, eyes just as curious as Scorp's, "But she didn't explain it properly. They always change the subject."
Scorp flipped another page. “Or you could just write the essay.”
"Don't worry Andromeda, it's ritual—"
“Tony!” Louis smiled happily. He was the only one allowed to call him that and get away with it. “What are you doing here? Don’t you have lessons?”
“Josh Packton,he works for dad…. American. You wouldn’t know him, he’s just recently transferred from MACUSA. He’s really cute and Rose has been mooning about him since forever. Sorry we didn’t tell you, she made me promise not to tell.” Scorp said it so convincingly even Rose half- believed him.
“I can’t watch this.” Harry muttered, but his eyes stayed glued to the pathetic displays of his smitten eleven-year old.
With this dramatic declaration, he promptly shut the door in their faces.
"You remembered to take your potion, right?" Scorp asks as he flops his book open. Freya's smile falls a little but she nods. She has to take eight potions a day, strictly on schedule. It's really important that she take them on time, so much so in fact that all the children had to learn her schedule, in case her mother or an adult couldn't reach her on time. Freya had heard Al complaining about it once.
"Tell me sweetheart. Daddy won’t be able to fix it if he doesn't know what it is."
“I want to spell them into staying the same age forever.” Hermione confessed softly into the wind. “They’re changing so much everyday, and we see them so little.”
The children were back home for the holidays. And—
“Really James, there’s no need to incite violence-”
"What, what, what.
James lets out a small shriek that he would later deny vehemently and Fred jumps about a foot in the air, fumbling with the bottle until he crashes to his knees, breathing hard, bottle clutched to his chest in fear.
James laughed and was rewarded with a swat to the back of his head, "Ow! Mom! What!"
"Don't make me deduct points here," Dominique threatened him, her Head Girl badge almost piercing him in the eye with its flash(Fred speculated that she'd charmed it to make it extra noticeable), but as usual, it was an empty threat. If there was one thing that Dominique Weasley got off on more than lauding her power over others, it was being shamelessly biased in each and everything that concerned her House. James didn't think he'd ever seen her cut Gryffindor points.
Harry caught the mug zooming his way and took a sip. He took a sip and nearly spat it out, it was so hot, and looked up just in time to notice Draco turn away in satisfaction. Andromeda was smiling. She mouthed "
So she hides. Her favourite hiding place in the world is curtains; the soft, satin ones in the drawing room, so she can listen to adult conversations without the long pauses(adults talk easier when she's not around, she's noticed); the coarse, blue ones with the white snowflakes in her parents bedrooms, fists in mouth to keep from giggling as her daddy prowls around the room, threatening to eat her; and the small, transparent ones fluttering next to Mr.Potter's second story window seat, right by the stairs and looking into the magical grounds, so she can peer into the children playing below. She knows she can't play, she gets tired too easily and her mother starts getting the pinched turn to her mouth Freya hates.
"I mean, I've just come back from Hogwarts, I'd like some peace and quiet and not to have to see my parents necking every morning, I mean, really who's the teenager here—"
"Don't feed it all to the cat!" Draco said in warning, "Al! Wake up! Lily, where's your plate?" Al mumbled groggily.
" before turning to walk away.
"Scorp, do you wanna go and look at....oh, you're with the squib."
"Watch it!" She barked, eyes flashing, "How many times do I have to yell about running in the corridors..oh it's you."
Draco was striking. People had always turned to stare at Draco Malfoy before he could remember, with or without alpha. In the afternoon light, with his form-fitting, sweeping midnight blue robe and sharply styled hair, he shone like a beacon. James saw some older boys doubling back to look at him and muttered "tossers" under his breath. He turned back to spy on his mother, only to see him steadily staring back at him.
"I told you mommy," Lily's self-satisfied voice trails into the room and Fred curses under his breath.
been only a couple of months and for all his flashy talk, Al was a homesick baby.
Her mother, to her surprise, laughs.
A fierce expression crosses Neville's face, blazing in its intensity, and he takes Freya's face in his palms.
Hannah's eyes are fixed on the cot next to her bed, silent tears streaming down her face. She used to look at Neville in moments of excitement and grief, her little way of reassuring herself. She's not looking anymore.
"Mum?"
“Really Mum? Now is the time you decide to speak up?!”
“Well, at least we know our son’s going to be a gentleman.” Draco said wryly, watching Al nod his head frantically because of some request from Gabrielle. Then she did something that made the group inhale sharply. She bent down and kissed Al on the cheek.
“You do catch that seasonal cold every year, Al.” Rose said consolingly as he plopped himself down next to her.
Draco's eyes flashed.
"Now, for the sake of all that is sane, let's get out of here—"
Harry Potter opened his eyes slowly, and stared at the ceiling. He felt tired, which was nothing unusual, but also a touch annoyed, which he wondered at. Then he remembered.
"—Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww—"
"'Wotcher Harry," Teddy mumbled blearily, "Sorry, a couple of the guys from work, and you know how alphas are like..."
So they had decided to take the law onto themselves and revolted. It didn't matter that the house was empty and their particular brand of revolution was reserved for no one else's eyes but their own; it was the thought that mattered and knowledge, as they say, is power.
"What?" Professor Hector snapped waspishly.
"Too late!" Dimple keeps crooning, grinning widely.
Scorp nodded hesitantly, eyes on the ground until his dad pulled his head up again with both palms, "Look at me, Duck."
"I hate this," Fred groans as he scrambles to his feet, still hugging the bottle."What are you even doing here?! You were all supposed to be out—"
"Forgotten what, Phineas?"
He climbs the steps and turns to nervously sit on the stool. The light is blinding, and it seems like the entire world is staring at him. For a moment, it is too much, and he lets his hair, shoulder length, one thing he is a bit vain about, fall over his face like a curtain, hiding him.
"Do you want my resignation, Hermione?'Cause that's what you will get."
Fred turns to look at Dimple, 'the house-elf', grinning up at them. Dimple was the seventh member of the Potter family, was as old as Teddy, and had grown up right alongside them. Raised on a mix of Hermione's progressive radicalism, his mother's disapproval of said progressive radicalism, staunch hatred for cooking and even deeper incompetency at care-taking, Dimple was an oddity to be sure. He had asked Harry to free him at age seventeen and had left to travel and explore the world. He had recently returned, and was currently serving as potions-assistant to Draco Malfoy. He would often babysit them when they were kids, and their childhood was rife with the memories of games and rivalry.
"Shit, he's found me," Hermione said hastily and all the parchments seemed to drop. Gathering her stuff and dropping hurried kisses on the top of her children's head, she spoke rapidly, "No Hugo, that's a bad word. Don't repeat that. Now be good, both of you. Tell Dad to feed the owls, he always forgets. Harry, you better come with me."
Scorp glances at her in surprise and then laughs, "Drunk a little too much of that potion, have you?"
"Will you die if you don't drink your potion?" Scorpius had asked in a matter-of-fact tone again, and Freya had almost smiled. Nobody said that word around her, a taboo so heavy that it hung around their house like a ghost, and not a friendly ghost either. With the sunlight filtering in through the screen door, the sound of shouting outside and the muffled cursing as Dimple scribbled angrily into his parchment, the word had never felt so flimsy, fear-like feathers blowing into the wind.
"Two of that Potter lot is coming tomorrow. Twins too, Merlin help us. If that James boy wasn't already enough!"
“Mossalina? Mabella?”
“No.” He says, and turns right back around.
"INCOMING!"
“So this is what you do in your room, shut up all day.” Al had stopped laughing and was now ogling the poster’s cleavage. “What’s her name again? Lady Misseli? Lady Mosalina? Maybelline?”
"Thanks Draco, oh yes, now listen here, I told you I was dropping off the kids today—"
"Go back, go back, go back..."
Hiding on the first floor would be amateur hour since James’s friends are over, and they delight in going out of their way to reveal where people are hidden. No sense of camaraderie or loyalty, that boy.
He spotted Louis sitting by the lake, and sighed. Louis was bundled up in a shawl and knitted wool cap with a big, white fluffy pom-pom on top. How could anyone be so adorable? Louis was a proper Weasley ginger, unlike the lighter brand of strawberry blonde his sisters sported. But the deep, wine-red hair was a striking contrast against his pale white skin and dark blue eyes, and anyone who met Louis couldn’t help but stare at him for five seconds before they started talking. He had freckles, but they were light, and they rather enhanced the delicate, fey-like features he’d inherited from his mother. Fleur Delacour’s other two omega daughters were attractive of course, but it was the youngest who was the beauty. Tristan Nott, sixth-year beater for Slytherin, was the envy of the entire school.
"MERLIN'S BEARD" Harry roared and everyone jumped, and thankfully, fell silent. He made sure all of them were watching when he stole another kiss from Draco and grinned at them. "My house, my rules."
Teddy thinks about it for one second, and then puts forth his statement of intent. “When I grow up, I’m going to marry Draco!”
of all the alphas in the world? Tristan thought farting into his younger brother’s face was funny. He was a gremlin of the underworld-a hairy, smelly monster-not fit to kiss the dirt that lay beneath Louis Weasley’s feet, forget his precious lips.
"Blimey mom, I dunno. Her pronunciation's great—"
proclaims the sign in simple, silver font. Borgin and Burkes must have been forced to sell at quite a discount, because their replacement appeared to be unusually modest.
"I know you know that I can hear you Minister—"
"This is something we'll have a hard time explaining."
“Have some scones Teddy, you must be tired from all that running around.” Draco beckons him closer and the lure of food is too great to resist. Teddy goes.
—that remained fixated on Draco. He was an alpha, he needed to know all points of his awareness, but he might as well have been blind, because Draco's ire rubbed at his insides wrong, and he had been able to focus on nothing else.
"I can't wait to be drunk!" James says, vibrating with excitement, "Teddy groans about hangovers all the time and says that everything sounds like a Mandrake. Dad says he regrets it every time. Honestly, it sounds like too much fun."
Blessed silence fell for some time after that, as Al grumbled and cursed his way through his homework. Scorp was the best at theoretical magic, so he gracefully accepted to help him when he asked.
"Yes, that the great granddaughter I was telling you about Jolene," Her great granny interrupts loudly, "A sweet child but rather timid, as you can see and frightfully shy. I'm always telling Neville it's doing her no favours, all this over-protectiveness, if she's going to live any semblance of a normal life she needs to be a little more tough—"
"Here's another curse in Lily's arsenal—"
It's something Freya can't stop thinking about. It must be like....And she would never even be able to hear, because she was too weak, and she would never be able to go to Hogwarts, and she should just forget it. Great granny said so.
Her mother always said that alphas were dangerous. It had terrified her, imagining alphas to be everything from the monster under her bed to big, angry men lying in wait for hapless victims. Hannah had answered with a strange, “No, not like that. I mean that too, but….nevermind.”
"—Better things to worry about," Harry muttered at his reflection, which looked like it always did—messy, windswept hair, face drawn with lines and broad shoulders tucked into untidy robes. Before the mirror could say something scathing in reply, he turned to hurry down the stairs.
?" at him but Harry just shook his head.
"POTTER, INCOMING!"
Fred sprawls on the floor, grimacing. He manages to look up and flash a weak grin at her. “Alright?”
“Don’t stare so hard, you’ll scare her away!” Lucy hisses but too late. Narrow, brown eyes meet Dominique’s own, and the girl’s entire face flushes red. What sounds like a small landslide of books thuds to the floor. The very next second, the perpetrator is fleeing the scene, Mister Vance shouting angrily after her.
"Uh, excuse-you. You couldn't pay me hundred galleons to clean your sorry room, James Sirius. And not even bonded labour is going to keep me from watching your mother hand your arse back to you."
“Oh. But I thought...” Al said and then threw a wounded look at Rose. “Hey, I thought we were best friends!”
"Yeah," James sulked, "Do you mind? I'm in a hurry."
“This is the first time I’ve ever smelled you,” continues Harry’s mouth as Harry’s brain watches on in horror, “You were probably on suppressants in school and...the trial. You smell good. Nice.”
“That will be seven sickles.” Malfoy says.
"Ewwwww—"
“You bastards.” Harry says seriously, and uproarious laughter is his only response. Harry tries to glare at Scrimgeour, but he has cleverly taken a seat which hides him from view.
"And you, my darling," Harry says gently as he takes Scorpius's tiny hands and places them on his chest, over his heart, "have Lily's heart."
"Alright, alright, alright—"
They grin.
“Potter.” He whispers.
"Everyone," McGonagall interrupted, closing her eyes again and feeling her good morning slip away from her. Yes. The Potters had robbed her off that too. "Stay calm, please."
CRASH!
The voice comes an inch from Fred's year and this time, Fred can't control his surprise. He shouts and the bottle slips from his hand, and out of his reach. He watches it fall to the ground as if in slow motion, James on the other side, eyes widening in horror, mouth open to shout as his hands reach uselessly in one last ditch attempt to—
Draco's hair
"I'm going to kill you dead," Fred growls and lunges.
“Why does she even see in you?” Lucy mutters crossly.
Lily blinks innocently up at him. Draco’s eyes narrow but Scorp interrupts with, “She really wanted to stay so Aunt Hermione let her. She made me promise to watch over her, don’t worry.”
"You." James growls, hands still grasping his chest, eyes narrowed at the three foot high monster currently smiling at him, "You little pest. Wait. till. I. get. my. hands. on. you."
“Go on without me.” Harry slurs to the raucous crowd of auror trainees singing merrily and off-tune. “Gonna take a minute.”
She's trying to keep tears at bay, but she feels sorry, so sorry, sorry for herself but most of all, for her parents, who had to suffer with her, even when it was no one's fault but her and her stupid body's.
. Our life would be unthinkably horrific without you so don't you ever—"
Raising his arms, he grabbed their shoulders and pulled them into a hug. James and Al stiffened in surprise.
“-are you doing? I said, let me go!”
“Scorp? Lily?” Draco asks in surprise. “What are you doing here? Weren’t you supposed to be at the Weasleys tonight?”
. It flows around Freya, and says everything that Freya has been feeling, knows everything about her, even the deepest corners of her heart she won't show even to mommy, and spills out her secrets to the world sweetly.
Scorpius did not reply. He turned back to his stick, and started drawing circles in the soil again. He heard, rather than saw, his father sit down before him on his haunches, placing the bottle next to him. The yelling inside the house seemed to get louder.
"No!" Lilly shouts back.
There was chaos behind them, absolute cacophony, three children and one adult going absolute nutters but
So she lets go of Daddy's pant leg, and starts tottering away, avoiding the side-glances and hushed whispers. She's going to sit by the snack table. No, she's going to steal some fruit and sit under the snack table, and eat it where no one can look at her.
Harry remembers being small and terrified, jerking back at the looming, threatening faces of the strangers around him as he stumbled into this place for the first time.
Al was still snoring away.
people looking—
“No.” Hermione shook her head, biting her head to keep from grinning. “No you certainly can’t.”
"It stinks!" Lily crinkles her nose, pushing away.
' at me again," Hermione was narrating savagely to three different quills, and the parchments floating in the air sizzled as the quills tried to keep up with her. She turned just at the right time to catch the steaming mug of tea rushing her way. Hugo cheered.
And, as Anthony had hoped and predicted, Louis bent forward and hugged him.
Secretary to the Minister of Magic, a tiny man with a voice that could make children whimper, and who seemed to have gotten the look of disapproval down to an art. McGonagall would have been proud of him.
"Shut up, Al!"
Harry smiles to himself as Malfoy walks up to the counter, and packages his purchase. The exchange is done in complete silence.
"You've made your displeasure perfectly clear," Harry retorted in irritation, drawing closer, "Since morning you've been—"
Draco blinked.
"I don't care. I'll let you on a little secret. I have on good authority that Angelina's been toying with the idea of a Howler for quite some time now and she might, on my insistence, slip in a few details including Fred and you...
James grinned and pointed at him in challenge, "I'll be back in five!" and ran off. Draco shook his head fondly. Running in, running out. When had he ever seen that boy walk calmly? Sleep was probably the only time he was still.
"Ah. I see."
“Her name.” James gritted out as the crowd tumbled out of his room. “Is Lady Mystery, you ignorant blockhead and I like her only because she makes REAL music but you lot wouldn’t know real music if it hit you in the face!”
So Malfoy’s an omega, and Harry is less chill around omegas than he thought he was. No matter. He’s an auror, he’s being trained to deal with dangerous, life threatening situations. It is some sort of sadistic irony that it is Malfoy who spiked his alpha instincts out of nowhere, but he is just one omega, and his utter distaste built up over half his life for this human being should make this a piece of cake. The thought of dating Malfoy is so bizarre and hilarious he immediately wants to tell Ron.
SCORPIUS' STORY
“It’s a bit too small, James.” Teddy ignored Draco like he hadn’t even spoken, pretending to catch the flying kiss the witch in the poster sent his way. “Reckon you missed a spot, there. That little bit of white wall is still visible, shoddy job on the creepy, worshipful fan shrine mate.”
The Sorting Hat falls over his eyes and there is sweet, sweet relief.
"Told you, didn't I, love? You're a fighter, alright."
Together, they watched from their corner on the porch as Al followed Gabrielle Delacour like a devoted familiar, ready to swoop in and protect her in case she cut herself on the rim of her champagne glass or tripped over an errant weed. Anyone else would have been uncomfortable, but Gabrielle enjoyed the attention, sending Al on little errands, pinching his cheeks and cooing at his ‘zweet eyes.’ Al would have shrieked in outrage if it had been someone less beautiful but alas, now he was tamed, beaming like the sun, leaping to hold her coat and stand next to her chair in what seemed like complete bliss.
“Huh.”
"Yeah. Great. Why don't you gather everyone, make it a true spectacle," James muttered angrily, "Can I please go now? As you can notice, it's an emergency."
, Harry thinks as he stares at O’Sullivan’s red face with grim, dangerous certainty,
"Filthy half-breeds, besmirching the house of my fathers, "Lily replied cheerfully and the room froze as if one. She opened her mouth to say more, but James quickly put a hand over her mouth. She stared at him in outrage.
is what she means.
"No, really! Okay I admit, James and Al do look like me a lot but inside? They're all their mom. James' got that sharp wit, and I'm pretty sure it didn't come from me. Did you know he's been talking back to me since he was two years old?"
"You think I don't know that, Mika?" James snapped and couldn't help groaning out loud when he spotted Lucy next to her.
"That one!"
“What?”
The lady stops playing the black and white keys and looks down at Freya in surprise. "Oh, this isn't magic, love. This is just music. And I'm playing it on the piano."
James nearly dropped his textbook. Jaw open in amazement, he watched his brother try to peer inside the classroom discreetly. This was the third floor and Al was in his first year. First year! James didn't know whether to laud his guts or rat him out to the teacher. Who knows, maybe he'll fetch much needed points in the bargain. Hector did seem awfully testy lately...
"What brought this on?"
Scorpius feels a sudden rush of panic and thinks,
Hannah pauses. "What do you mean?"
The echoes of the glass breaking is so loud, Fred hears it in his heart. He'll continue to hear it years after, waking or dreaming, and cringe in a visceral reaction to get the memory away from him.
“Get out!” James howled, having recovered enough to become angry. He started shoving his snickering brothers out, steering the herd like a snappy sheep dog.
Hugo-5
“-listening?! Hellooo?!”
“You know what mate, if you asked Harry, he could probably arrange for her to autograph your face-”
If Neville wandered across the Mirror of Erised now, he wonders what he would see?
"But—"
"Shut up and get inside!"
"Next to the Veela figurine," Draco added helpfully.
"It's just," Scorpius began, voice muffled into his father's chest, so that it wouldn't sound quite as shameful out loud, "I don't wanna be an omega."
Whispers hound his every step but he ignores them. He already knows what they're saying about him. They're talking about his looks, about his gender, about Al and James, already infamous, and about his parents. It's like they already know all about him, without knowing even a single thing about him.
trigger warning: depression, suicidal thoughts.
"I like it, " Scorpius replies as he lays his head on his father's shoulder. "I like being like grandma."
Privacy was often demanded loudly, and heavy words like "individual rights" and "you're suffocating me!" were thrown about so much his parents rolled their eyes and let him be. But Draco sometimes worried about James drowning in the filthy swamp that was his bedroom floor so armed with a gas mask and a mop(James didn't find his jokes funny; sore, little child that he was), he mustered the courage to cross enemy lines.
James didn't notice. His eyes were wide and all color had left his face. His heart had stopped beating. Some masochist tendency made him meet Lorcan's eyes, who was smirking.
"Stop calling me, Potter," Harry said savagely, now having successfully cornered his omega between the porridge and the scrambled eggs.
"—too many damn Weasleys, and now this—"
“Christ Al.” Draco put a hand over his eyes.
“You’re kind of beautiful,” is what comes out instead.
"Merlin, Al," Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, "It's not even Halloween yet."
Dominique hasn’t noticed of course, frowning intensely into her scroll, ink smudges on her hand and cheek. “What now?”
It was one of those mornings. The ones which started right, not like the ones which felt like they were being dragged out of you. The air was crisp, and the sun fell just so. Her office was gleaming bright, and everything seemed to buzz warm with magic. The portraits seemed to be content as well.
Harry had presented in sixth year, and was generally uncomfortable with everything related to do with secondary genders. He had never felt more like a Muggle than when he was introduced to the new, alien biology that all wizard kind seemed to possess. He would have been happier as a beta, but the universe seemed determined to force him into the spotlight, and so he became almost unbearably popular in sixth year. He’d managed it fine until now.
James stumbles after her drunkenly, paws out in desperation. "You devil child. You sneaky, little monster."
Both were of the same mind in believing themselves ready(for alcohol) and that their seventeenth birthday was altogether too bloody far away. To be asked to wait for three more hellish years (four for James) of not knowing was quite an unreasonable request and moreover, something of a grave injustice in which all parents seemed to sadistically delight themselves with.
Unable to move, like an accident waiting to happen, James watched Draco's gaze brush over the two of them, hold their eyes very deliberately and mouth, "
"—needs to better fortifications, yes sir, we do—
Rose just rolled her eyes, and tossed Al her textbook when he couldn’t find his own. “Merlin, you’re hopeless.”
"Daddy," Scorpius cried and daddy promptly gathered up his arms and hugged him. Scorpius hid his face in his father's neck, smelled the pine and smoke that made him feel safer than anywhere else in the world, and tried to breathe without crying.
“I don’t know how!” Harry shouts back and flees the scene, door falling shut behind him with a loud bang. It is only when he apparates home that he realizes he forgot to pay.
"—and the magical properties of Gillyweed, when studied in comparison to other aquatic herbs can be said to be something on which I'll elaborate...only when James Potter would do us all a kind favor and stop trying to throw himself out of the window."
It was NEWT year, and nothing short of a troll loose in the castle would distract Molly and Dominique Weasley from their studies. They were in the library so much they had practically become one with the furniture, and Mister Vance, the librarian, felt out of sorts if he didn’t spot them waiting patiently by the doors every morning. Unfortunately for young lovers, even the books piled high around their table wasn’t enough for clandestine meetings to escape the Head Girl’s eagle eyes, and only Gryffindors were brave enough to loiter near.
so he grabs the first thing he sees and walks to the counter. He clears his throat. “Please ring this up for me.”
"What's wrong with you?" Scorp had asked her bluntly once to her face as they lay on their stomachs trying to colour a unicorn as it pranced around, avoiding their crayons, while Al and James wrestled over a toy broomstick outside. Rose had been sitting next to them and had gasped, but for some reason, Freya hadn't minded at all.
Scorpius looked away.
"—'d like to submit an application to have my portrait moved down to the dungeons—
"I'm so glad, Ducky. And you're forgetting something. Your mom's an omega too. Don't you want to be like your mom? Your brother must be jealous of you, cause you're the only one that looks like him. You're unique, baby."
. This had been always been the same, and Harry couldn't see it changing. Waking, sleeping, working, ordering, fighting, yelling—there was an undercurrent in Harry, a thread, a
And so it comes to be that not one, but two sons of Harry Potter follow into his footsteps and remember that the Sorting Hat always takes choice into account.
A storm had been raging inside Scorpius' tiny body since morning and he had carried the burden bravely, not breathing a word about it to anyone, not even Al. The sound of his father's gentle voice calling him 'Ducky,' a nickname reserved only for him, proved to be too much, however, and tears sprung to his eyes, spilling down his cheeks without stopping.
"There's no difference," She replies smiling, "For muggles and wizards and witches alike, music is the same."
The Hat sighs, as if resigned but in agreement and the next thing Scorpius knows, it’s yelling out loud-
"What—is that—were you guys sneaking in to—"Harry's voice grows progressively louder and then his eyes zoom in on the broken, pungent mess on the floor.
“I wasn’t this bad, was I?” Ron asked suddenly. Hermione laughed in answer.
James froze.
Great granny's piano is Freya's most favourite thing in the
“Your secret admirer.” Lucy giggles.
Later, when they've hurriedly exited great granny's dinner party and have returned home, Freya asks her mother a question.
“It seems,” Molly was smiling, “That you have quite the ardent admirer, Mika.”
"Yeah, cause I'm better than them daddy!"
"We came back early, idiot. Obviously."
“Does Joshua Packton even exist?” Rose asked anxiously afterwards.
I hate children, he thinks.
MOM IS HERE.
“Shut up, Ron.” Harry groused, downing the last of his Butterbeer. “You have no leg to stand on. I haven’t forgotten fourteen year old you with Fleur. My son’s doing much better in comparison.”
Scorpius, all of seven years old, sat squatting alone in an old patch of dirt behind the Burrow, prodding the ground with a small stick. Head bent, hair covering his face like a curtain, he muttered under his breath, waving the stick around like a wand. Sounds of song and children yelling filtered over to him through the window but he ignored them.
But he could only blame the Potter genes for so long.
"Scorp?"
The backdoor slams open and a child voice wails, "SCORP! I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU! WE'RE PLAYING QUIDDITCH AND YOU'RE ON MY TEAM!"
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I get it, I'm going now," James said hurriedly, shaking off her hold, about to speed walk away when Dominique left him a parting shot, "He was going towards the Headmistress' Office, last I saw."
, Harry thinks to himself.
"—rush the memos at him so fast, he'll never have the gall to say '
"We're not done here, Harry! Ughh, don't strut away from me—No Lily, don't repeat that honey—"
“I can’t blame him.” Ron cackled.
"Yeah, don't go getting any ideas. And Albus? He's Draco's son through and through. Half the trouble James causes, Al tricks him into. He looks innocent, but he's shrewd and competitive, and well, when I was seven.."
She's playing the piano when the letter comes.
"Wow," Rose had said in awe. Scorp had nodded in satisfaction.
"Someone's in trouble!" Lucy sing-songed, "But I guess that's nothing new."
All the blood drained from Rose’s face and her mouth turned to ash. Her miserably, short life of eleven flashed by her eyes, now filled with an eternity of Al’s stupid face taunting, making kissing faces and pretending to swoon whenever his brother walked by. He’d never let her forget, worse,
But the huddled pile on the bed was already moving. "Mum! How many times have I told you-"
"—can't tell you where the Minister is, no, because it seems she can't stick to one place—"
Anthony’s brother was dating the most beautiful omega in the world, and Anthony was nonplussed. It was completely demented. Why would anyone, let alone an omega that graced the world with his very presence, date
And to Draco’s absolute astonishment, quiet, cool Scorpius turns red and giggles in a very un-Scorpius way. He is practically flaming when Picquery takes his hand and kisses it with a hypnotic “pleasure.” Lily; loud, bouncing off the walls, flamboyant Lily says nothing, preferring instead to hide her face in Draco’s leg and when Picquery isn't looking, stare at him with eyes that wouldn’t be out of place on a calf.
"Oh, no," Al whispered and James couldn't help but agree.
"Nothing. Just remembering why I love you so much."
"There's a definite chance that adult persons stand to lose their collective shit if they see us, yeah," Fred agrees and turns to look at James. James stares back.
"They said I was going to die the moment I was born," Freya had grinned, and couldn't help boasting, "And they said it every year after. I'm six years old now and I'm still not dead, am I? My dad says I'm a fighter, that I've been fighting since my first moment into the world."
“Why are you working here anyway?” Harry interrupts. He has a hysterical urge to laugh. Malfoy. Always, at the end of every road and tunnel, no matter where Harry runs, there stands Malfoy, sneering down at his nose at him. Panic simmers in his stomach.
"Already?" Dilys Derwent moaned in distress, "I thought I had time—"
"You sound like a fussy, old codger right now, James—"
Scorpius looked up to see his father staring down bemusedly at him. He seemed to have stumbled upon Scorpius, on his way to somewhere else, a bottle of Firewhisky in one hand.
"It's not?"
"No harm done Professor," James nodded and ducked his head. Hector, now distracted, had forgotten his earlier question. All for the better. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted it again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What kind of magic is this?"
"Professor, I need to be excused."
"Do you see him?"
"Don't encourage her!" Hermione whispered at them furiously from the sidelines, "Nooo, don't put that in there—"
"If you ask me, you're more like a Potter than anyone else in the family."
, and it's about her as usual, and mommy's trying to calm daddy down and he won't listen and people are looking and Freya
Freya Longbottom is born with a whisper of magical fatigue in her heart. She is not expected to survive the first day.
Lucy and Louis collapse into giggles. “Invite us to the wedding!”
All faces snapped to the second to last bench in unison and it shall be noticed that none of them looked particularly surprised. James Sirius Potter, newly thirteen years old, was staring intently out of the window, hands and face pressed to the glass pane. He was tall for his age, wore glasses like his father, and was a ghost of Harry Potter come to trouble the halls of Hogwarts for a second time. "Harry was a sweet boy. James? Merlin, don't ask me," was a comment famously attributed to Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts, but who continued to deny it when confronted. He was a point of consternation and gossip among students, teachers and even ghosts, who rather favored him. Bloody Baron and Nearly Headless Nick did not agree on many things, but James Potter was not one of them. It was rumored, but not yet proved, that teachers held separate meetings solely focused on James Potter and Fred Weasley, with board headers of "Grades," "Games" and "Peeves" followed by an ominous, "What have they done now?" That both of them were Beaters for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team was perhaps the one things keeping the Hogwarts staff from reverting to something Filch affectionately called, "The good, old days."
“What?” Draco stills.
Freya sticks her cold toes against Scorp's shin in retaliation and is rewarded with a satisfactory yelp.
"Where is Teddy." Draco's voice is still even and its freaking Fred. "He was supposed to be here."
Harry fishes out the money. He looks up to say ‘thank you,’ determined to follow the forced, cold civility both of them are trapped inside when he spots a mole on Malfoy’s neck, peeking at him right next to his ear. He’d never noticed it, all the time they’d spent locked together in school.
“Should've’ known I’d find you nerds here.” Al announced as he trooped in. His hair and shoulders were damp with rain. “This household is a bloody dictatorship! Mum won’t let me fly in the rain! I told her that was ridiculous, since we do that in Hogwarts all the time, but he just told me that I could do that when it was my dorm-mates who’d have to stay up all night hearing me cough, not him.”
“If I were you.” Scorpius said, flipping a page on his book. “I’d get down to finishing my homework. We need to write a hundred page essay for Binns.”
But most of all, he loves Draco.
"Gave me quiet a fright when I walked in this morning," Draco sniped as he sent a plate flying to Rose, pointedly ignoring Harry. "You're lucky I didn't hex you."
Teddy loves a lot of things. He loves Grandma’s lavender scented pillows, he loves treacle pudding and apples, he loves Harry’s flying hugs when he swoops him up in his arms and throws him in the air, making Teddy hiccup into laughter. He especially loves the grumpy tabby called Puddles, who barely tolerates him.
“How did it go?” Blaise asked touching up his make up and adjusting his outfit.
“I knew you could do it! Those bitches that applied just to get close to him are going to be so pissed!” Blaise said excitedly hopping up and down.
“Yes! It feels so good Master!” Draco moaned his hips bucking up. He was getting close to cumming but knew that he couldn’t tell Harry let him. Harry slapped his ass suddenly, surprising Draco.
“I’m fine Hermione just thinking about a lot of things.” Harry mumbled pushing the food he had on his plate around.
"Well yeah...and this isn't about your heat or anything, I've found you attractive for a while now and I thought you were an alpha, so I was thinking my brain was fucked up but you’re not an alpha but an omega and a really attractive one at that, but that's not all I like about you I also like how smart you are and.."
“I’m guessing your hungry?” Harry laughed pulling away.
"Where is the lube?" He whispered making Draco shiver.
“Green.” Draco responded enjoying the feeling of Harry’s roughened hands on his skin.
Harry stopped everything and flipped Draco over onto his back. He whispered a spell, and his hand was covered in lube. He rubbed his dick a few times covering it quickly before grabbing Draco's hips and lining himself up.
“Past noon.” Harry said he counted down the seconds tell Draco freaked out.
“…Yes. Do you?” Draco asked seeing that Harry was also blushing just as hard as Draco.
"If you're willing to accept me as your donor." Draco replied glancing away before looking back at Harry.
"Draco...you want this don't you? You want me, right?" Harry questioned looking into Draco's eyes self-doubt apparent in his. Draco looked at Harry pushing past the haze of his heat. He brought his hands up to cup Harry's face and wrapped his legs around Harry's waist pushing tell Harry slowly entered him. He leaned up and softly kissed Harry.
“Shut up Ginny! Draco didn’t have a choose, he had to become a death eater to protect his family. I am not joking Draco and I are dating. I told you yesterday that I’m gay.” Harry shouted getting the attention of everyone around.
Two months had gone by and Draco was going insane. The small touches here and there, the heated looks, and the somewhat sexual conversations at the club had Draco running around in circles. He couldn’t stop thinking about Harry or what Harry could/would do to him. Draco jumped when he suddenly felt his phone go off. The other people in the library glared at him as his ringtone played.
“The…uh…papers you asked for are on your desk.” Draco mumbled trying not to nuzzle in Harry’s chest.
“Remember the code you’ll need it to get into our playroom.”
Draco only had a second to process the word before Harry was grabbing his thighs tightly and lifting him up. He wrapped his legs around Harry and shuddered has he felts Harry's clothed boner rub against his own. He soon felt the world shift as Harry laid him down on his bed. He felt cold as Harry stood up to look down at him.
Harry climbed onto the bed and laid down on his back.
"As well as can be, surprised your even talking to me right now, thought you would be off with the she Weasley having lots of babies." Draco said grabbing his drink and taking a sip.
Draco had sat by the Black Lake for most of the day, but the pain of hunger was getting to be to much. He stood up and dusted his pants off and started to walk back to the castle. He wondered what Blaise and Pansy were up too. Pansy was probably off tormenting some first years. Blaise would be in the library, reading some random book. Maybe he would join Blaise after getting some food and study for a bit. Anything to keep his mind from thinking about Harry Potter.
"I know you're out there. Might as well reveal yourself." Harry yelled looking around. A figure slowly made its way out from behind a tree.
“It’s just through here.” Harry said opening the doors. Harry’s home office reminded Draco of Harry’s office at the university. The desk was a mess with papers everywhere, books were scattered around the room and to Draco’s horror, randomly placed on the bookshelves. Mugs were also scattered around the room, thankfully all empty along with some plates.
Harry nodded; he could feel his face turning red. Beside him Draco chuckled softly but covered it with a cough.
“That was amazing starlight.” Harry panted out brushing a strand of sweat soaked hair out of Draco’s face. Draco hummed his agreement running his hands through Harry’s damp hair and slicking it back.
"Don’t look now but Draco Malfoy just walked in." Ron groaned taking a chug from his beer.
“PAST NOON! We have to leave, I’ve already missed like three classes, oh my goodness what about your classes? WHY DIDN’T YOU WAKE ME UP SOONER!” Draco yelled freaking out, he tried to get up out of bed, but Harry stopped him.
“I bet you were thinking about how much you missed me.” Ginny said grabbing on to Harry’s arm and pressing her chest into it.
"Hmmmm it's too early to be awake now love." Harry groaned pulling Draco close and burying his face into Draco's neck. Draco laid there cuddled up with Harry feeling like he was still dreaming.  Then he felt it. Something was rubbing against his ass.
"Quite all right Mr. Potter, please take a seat so the meeting can start." McGonagall sighed gesturing towards the empty seat right next to Draco. Harry hurried over and quickly sat down.
“Yeah, he yelled at her then yanked his arm away from her. He was pissed. I’ve never seen Potter that anger before. Are you okay?” Blaise asked looking at Draco’s red eyes and nose. Draco looked like he had been crying.
Suddenly there was a commotion by the entrance, and everyone turned to look. Draco's jaw dropped when he saw who was standing in the doorway with a sheepish grin on his face.
“You look amazing, all spread open for me, waiting for my touch.” Harry said standing back and looking over Draco. He went over to the table he had spread all his toys on and thought about which one to use first. He picked up a feather teaser and walked back over to Draco. He looked at his starlight laying on the bed all spread open completely at Harry’s mercy.  He flicked the feather teaser over Draco’s perked nipple making him jump. Harry continued to tease Draco with the feather teaser tell he was moaning every time he was touched.
*Time skip cause its late and I’m tried*
“It means whatever you want it to mean…sir.” Draco said lowering his head. Harry smirked, usually his assistant was yelling at him about the mess in his office, or for not doing something and rushing it at the last minute. This submissive Draco was quite different.
“You’re welcome.” Draco responded sitting down. The two sat in silence enjoying the warm tea. Draco checked his watch and cursed.
“Before you say anything, I have a few things I would like to say. First, I would like to apologize to both of you. I was an arsehole to you both and I said some cruel things and I am sorry for that. I know that one apology isn’t going to make up for all the things I’ve said and done but I do hope you give me a chance to prove to you that I have changed for the better. I’ll leave you guys alone to talk.” Draco said standing up. He gave Harry and quick kiss on the cheek then made his way over to the Slytherin table.
“My cock has been aching to be inside you.” He whispered into Draco’s ear licking the shell. Draco groaned; his hips lifted to meet with Harry’s as Harry rubbed his cock against Draco. Harry reached around Draco’s head and untied the blind fold letting it slowly slid off Draco’s face. As soon as Draco’s sliver eyes met with Harry’s emerald ones, Harry thrusted into Draco. He watched as Draco’s eyes snapped shut and his chin tilted up.
“Y…yes it does, wh…what is your type?” Draco stammered clearing his throat, he pictured everything Harry had said, and he couldn’t help but get a little hot from it. He wasn’t blind, Harry was incredibly attractive and exactly Draco’s type.
"Well...if...you...if you want I could...help you...with your heat...onlyifyouwantmeto." Harry quickly said looking away.
"Do I have your attention now Mr. Potter?"
“Tell me about your most recent.” Harry said rubbing the tip of his finger down Draco’s cock.
"You don’t want to?" Harry whispered tucking a stray piece of blonde hair behind Draco's ear.
“Tell me what you want.” Harry ordered again rubbing the tip of Draco’s painfully hard dick with the tip of the riding crop. When he pulled back a trail of precum connected it and Draco’s cock.
"Yes, I am gay. Why does it matter to you?" Draco asked wondering where all this was going.
“What else love.” Harry hummed reaching down and playing with Draco’s hanging dick.
"No wait, want now!" Harry growled licking along Draco's neck.
“Cum! I want to cum, please let me cum! Please!” Draco begged, he had been close to cumming multiple times but knew that his master would be disappointed in him if he came without permission.
Draco sat there in shock. He must have heard him wrong. There was no way Harry potter found him attractive. I mean they spent years fighting at every chance they got. It was in their last year at Hogwarts when they had made a truce of sorts that Draco realized that he had a huge crush on Harry. At the time though Harry was with Ginny and rumors of them getting married were going around so Draco did what he did best. He buried his feelings deep inside himself and ignored the boy.
"Yes, you should have told me you needed time. I would've understood. I'm sorry as well I shouldn't have kissed you that night..."
"You know," Draco chuckled standing up and stepping closer to Harry, "I realized something our last year of school," he continued taking another step closer, "I realized that the reason I was so mean to you wasn’t because I hated you or wanted to be you but because it seemed to be the only way I could get your attention, and I wanted your attention because I liked you, I liked you a lot." He was now right in front of Harry looking into Harry's emerald, green eyes.
“T…Theo?”
“Now Potter, they will trust you because Severus trusts you. That is the ONLY reason I trust you.” Dahlia spoke her voice daunting. “Theo trusts you, DRACO trusts and I swear to Mother Magic if you break his innocent little heart, you will wish for death.”
“What I mean is children,” Bellatrix chuckled at Harry’s confusion looking slightly amused. “Me and husband, Morgana bless him, always wanted little ones of our own, ever since we held Draco in our arms.”
Harry nodded, “I understand sir, but the basic families I know who are not enslaved would be the Lestranges, Carrows, Dolohov, Bellatrix, Averys, Parkinson's…” Harry trailed off as these were the only prominent families in his world that he knew off.
“If you….if you trust him, Severus, then we will listen.
Ronald gulps, “I...I am sorry Harrison, I won’t do that again”.
“Um yeah, I can only imagine Neville,” he said forcing a chuckle. “Thank Merlin I don’t have siblings.”
“I...I don’t understand sir?”
“The proper movement for the incantation is to flick your wrist, draw your arm back and flick your wrist again saying Lumos,” Harry said. This reminded him of his sessions with Dumbledore’s Army in the Room of Requirement. Harry held back a scoff at the same situation, teaching magic illegally then and now.
“As I said, I am a very skilled legimens and I can tell if a memory is fabricated due to the different chemicals responding to different instances in the brain,” Snape responded calmly.
“M..my parents, uh...they refused to pick a side, my lord,” the girl said staring at the ground. “They just wanted to live in our little cottage by the hillside in peace, but when the war was won, the supreme, may he forever reign, and the lords and ladies thought we were on the dark side…”  the girl trailed off, “it’s been years since I have seen my parents”
