In the centre of the room, a large, red circle had been drawn on the ground, surrounding the package from yesterday. There had never been much furniture in the first place, but what there was had been pushed against the walls: neatly stacked rows of shelving, several small tables, and a single chair. The numerous books that didn’t fit into the bookcase had been piled symmetrically in the corners.
Harry gapes at her, and as the two of them stare at each other—the Welcome Witch with a confusion that is quickly morphing into irritation, and Harry with straight-up shock—it hits him. No one here knows who he is. That, or they don’t care.
And then, Merlin help him, they’d be back at Draco’s flat, locked in his workroom, working together.
Potter unscrewed the lid from the container in his hand and studied the green dust inside. Draco thought that might be the end of the conversation, but just before he turned away, Potter looked up at him.
“I told you: Draco’s not like that anymore. He’s changing. Trying to be different.” The name had just slipped out, unconsciously. He hadn’t planned to say it, but it didn’t feel wrong, either. Weird, maybe, but not wrong.
Potter leaned back against the wall, and his eyes seemed suddenly dull. It was as if all the life had been drained away from them.
But then… this feeling wasn’t exactly new. And now that it was back, he was quietly stunned he had ever forgotten it. He closed his eyes, wincing as the familiarity of it sunk into his skin. It had to be the curse, warping his mind and replacing cultivated disdain with curiosity, but he couldn’t deny that his Hogwarts days had been marked with a similar curiosity. An obsessive, furious curiosity that he really did not need to see start up again in his late twenties.
And not just from their wands, but from their very presence itself. His father had admitted to him, once, during an incredibly depressing night filled with whisky and the shattering of childhood illusions, that it was the avian link between Veela and peacocks that made their presence at the Manor so vital. It was almost impossible to imagine his father had once bothered to care for the needs of his Veela blood, but the memory was there all the same.
Draco made a vaguely committal noise and ate some more of his soup. Potter was right; it wasn’t fair. But when was anything fair?
“When I fuck people, I lose them,” he continued. “I’m selfish. I get bored. I don’t want to do that with you.” He paused. “I want this to mean something, Harry.”
“They’re so confused.” He clapped Draco on the back and shook his head. “It’s unreal. If they only looked down, they’d see you practically punching them, mate. But they fall for it every time just because you smile at them. Disgusting really. How is it that
Draco looked around at the strange walls, remembering all the times they’d commented on how odd it was that they’d appeared inside the curse rather than in front of it.
He tried to keep the edge of anger out of his voice. It was strange… This was the first time he’d felt anything beyond the fog in months. Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw something flicker along the balcony, above the instruments. But when he turned, there was nothing there.
Then, he immediately dropped back on his pillows and pretended to be asleep, not because he was attempting to pull off the charade of drunkenness, but because he suddenly and fervently wished he was unconscious. Why was he trying to prolong this conversation? What possible good could come of it?
Then, the wedding march began to play, and they turned around, pretending not to notice the tears in George’s eyes and the steady grip of Kalen’s hand on his shoulder. Draco felt Harry lean back into him, the steady rise and fall of his breath a soothing rhythm, as the doors opened and the hall was filled with light.
Draco’s eyes suddenly widen, his pace quickening, and it’s all Harry can do to hold on while Draco’s head is tipped back in pleasure and the last of his shudders are still rolling through them both, before spilling over with a moan.
“You are aware that until I can break the curse, we won’t remember anything that happens inside the dream-state?” he asked. “We have to work in complete isolation—nothing new goes in, nothing comes out, not until it’s over. It’s part of the process of confusing the curse and making sure it doesn’t get suspicious and attack.” He took another deep breath, feeling his sanity leaving him the longer he spoke. “It means we have to trust each other completely, Potter, because once we’re inside, there’s no one to help us but ourselves.”
While Draco cast the diagnostics, Potter grabbed a pot of white, iridescent dust and brought it over to one of the remaining cogs that weren’t illuminated. The last of the mechanism around them began to glow, eclipsing the other colours in a light that seemed to make the very air around them shimmer.
Draco’s eyes widened. “I thought they’d stopped!” he said, unable to keep the hint of glee from his expression as he hurried over to stand beside Harry. “I thought they must have triggered the spell while I was in France and then given up.”
“Don’t act like you don’t know,” Draco drawled, draining his glass and summoning the bottle to pour another. “You put them there deliberately, after all.”
Then part of him began to panic—Draco had said he didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to fuck; he wanted to be intimate and vulnerable. All this time he had been waiting for Draco to be ready, and he suddenly realised he had no idea how to do that, himself.
Potter’s eyes widened, confused and surprised, but there was a hint there of what Draco had known he was going to see: disbelief and hope—hope that he meant that much to someone. Draco kissed him again, soft and slow and full of promise.
“We won’t insist on work-talk,” Morgan assured him. “Harry has already told us that it went well today and you’re making progress.”
And then he turned away, because far more than Draco’s living room stood between them, and if Potter could hurt Draco this much without them even being together, he didn’t want to imagine what he could do if they were.
Draco stared at the letter for a long, long time. The string bag of vegetables on his arm grew heavy, and he dropped it to the ground before sinking slowly down beside it. Potter had done it. He’d really done it.
They broke apart, staring at each other. For a moment, Draco thought he saw something in Potter’s eyes—something real. Then it was gone.
Draco snorted, though his heart was racing in his chest. Weasley and Granger were already deep in some conversation about someone or other’s niece, and so he had no excuse not to follow Pansy when she stood up and led him out into the hallway.
“All right,” he said slowly, mind buzzing. “Well, the prophecy. Is the one you’ve been dreaming of the beginning of the curse, do you think?”
He can just hear the commentary now: oh, look at Mr. Potter, he looks so stressed; Harry Potter puts on a brave smile for the cameras, but we can see right through it to the tormented soul within; oh, poor Mr. Potter really needs to take a holiday.
Hermione was quick to jump on board: “That’s right! I suppose you get to see a lot of different sides to him that we don’t when you’re sleeping together.”
Draco ground his teeth together and fought not to give into stage two earlier than strictly necessary.
All three pure-blood children had loved meeting their new Muggle friends, and now the biggest problem was the flustered parents who were busy trying to work out how to use a telephone so that they could arrange another play date.
He was interrupted by a tapping on the window. A large screech owl hovered on the sill, and Draco recognised it as one of the swift birds favoured by St Mungo's. His heart dropped into his stomach.
The way he eyed Malfoy gave Harry no illusions about who he suspected might end up in hospital by then.
“It’s a bit cold in here, isn’t it?” Hermione shivered, looking around the bare room. “I think I might just head to bed.”
“Little warning next time, Malfoy?” he asked, lip curling in disgust as he rubbed his temple. “I’d prefer not to die from fucking stupidity, if I can help it.”
“I don’t think I really want to try toys just yet,” he said, leafing through the next several pages of toys that looked more and more like torture devices in all their wicked styles and colours. Something that was called
Harry hadn’t brought much with him; his trunk was mostly filled with clothing and whatever books and parchment Hermione had nagged him about until he’d stuffed them in, along with an assortment of knick knacks he set up on his bedside table, including the photo album of his parents Hagrid had given him at the end of first year.
There was regret in Potter’s voice, and that hurt, but there was also anger. Which was bloody rich, in Draco’s mind.
“No, we can’t,” Draco agreed. “And why would it be something I owe when you’re the one making it up to me?” He blinked. “Have you worked out how to do that yet, by the way? How to make up for taking my wand? We have”—he glanced at the hourglass—“two grains of sand left before you’ll need to make a grand gesture of repentance. Otherwise…” Draco sliced a finger across his neck.
Harry’s mouth fell open, and Draco lowered down to kiss him, moving his lips gently, giving Harry time and space to move up into him as well. Harry could feel his orgasm building, tightening in his stomach and lower, growing and growing as he pushed up to meet Draco’s steady thrusts, pushing against the dip of his hips, his stomach. Every so often Draco’s cock brushed against his, hard and slick, and every time it did, Draco would moan into his mouth, his careful control momentarily abandoned. Then, Draco took them both back into his hand and slid his fingers up and down, faster than before.
“Thank you,” he said quietly, and something jolted inside him, like a stone that wanted to give away. He felt, for a second, as though an avalanche of rock sat within his ribcage, waiting for the right note to make it topple and reveal the hidden cavern’s entrance, but the stone didn’t fall and the curse didn’t lift and Draco suddenly wanted very badly to go to sleep.
A thrill of hot desire coursed through Draco’s stomach. Merlin, he wanted to. But… something wasn’t right. He didn’t like how quickly Potter had shifted from elation to cynicism to desire.
around the flying visitor. When he had finished, nothing much about the succulent had changed, but the soil was damp around the tip of his finger and the droplets on the leaves glistened in the sun.
Against his better judgement, Draco refilled Potter’s glass. Fortunately, Potter chose to sip this time.
Harry actually brightened a little at that; this was already better than being alone in Grimmauld Place. Pathetic as it sounded, some company would be nice.
Knowing that it would alert the curse to their presence, he gingerly tapped the smallest cog and waited. For a split second, everything stopped moving, like a sleeping animal hitching its breath, and then it started again, and Draco let out the breath he had been holding for several minutes.
Potter nodded, and then directed Draco how to hold the Quaffle to get the right angle, and suddenly they were passing it back and forth without the anger.
“What? Why is that funny, Potter?” Malfoy sneered, and Harry knew he had approximately two seconds before Malfoy got up and stormed away and that was the end of their exploration of sex together.
Three waiters appeared at their side, offering champagne and scotch in crystal tumblers. Soon enough, they found themselves settled on a chaise off to the side, and Draco found himself relaxing.
Draco sat up, rolling his shoulders and shaking his head a little to clear it. “In other news, Pansy is starting to come around to the idea of us dating. At the moment, she’s angrier at me for, as she puts it, ‘thinking with my cock and my heart instead of my head’ than for trying to win her bet. I think she’s actually forgotten about it.”
Someone stuttered in reply, a strongly accented voice carrying into the hallway as they reached the landing and stopped by the open door.
with more compassion,” she said gently. “Even while we’ve been apart, you’ve been changing the way you think about yourself, the way you treat yourself. I can hear a gentleness there—even love.”
their argument, which meant that he was still holding Draco in at least semi-professional regard. And he didn’t look like he had mentioned their disagreement either.
The smile became real, just for a second. “You have Malfoy to thank for that, actually.” He nodded to Draco. “He made it work.”
Potter shrugged. “It’s been that way for years—ever since I borrowed your wand.” He sighed, swilling the last of his coffee around in his mug. “I’ve been studying the dual core, specifically the peacock feather, and my research turned up a complimentary link between the feathers and Veela magic about two years ago. I stupidly—”
There was a pause right before the moment that Potter smiled back at him. It made the moment all the more real, all the more glorious. Draco sank into that moment.
Which was about the least likely thing Potter could ever say, and rendered Draco quite effectively speechless.
“Er, don’t you need my travel papers or something?” Harry asks, running a self-conscious hand over the front of his jeans which are already covered in a thin layer of red dirt.
Draco lifted one shoulder in a shrug and turned away, poking his fork idly at the food on his plate. “I’d like your help nonetheless.”
An ache long forgotten started up in Draco’s chest. “Well, congratulations on changing the future, Potter, but it’s not like you can change the past.”
Finally, Draco’s hand found his cock, and he jerked it quickly, in time with the motion of his prick inside Harry. His vocalisations took on a new urgency. Every now and then, he’d drop down to play with Harry’s balls, squeezing and massaging them in a way that made Harry see stars and drift even closer to coming.
“I don’t want to look in a mirror,” he confessed, staring down at the carpet as the one thing he could trust not to betray him.
Potter’s brows flickered into a half-frown, just for a second, but then understanding dawned on his face.
Malfoy leaned against the bedpost and folded his arms across his chest. “Weasley. Kind of you to drop in. Where’s your trunk?”
Draco’s eyes widened. “You think it’s been modified?” He lurched forward, hunting through the pockets of his toolkit for the magnifying glass he knew was there. “Then there’ll be a signature.”
Eventually, Draco had not only managed to tweak a proposal that satisfied the Ministry’s budget by partnering with the Potion Mastery apprenticeships and using their projects as to supply the program, but he’d managed to think of a way sell it, too.
“I’m not trying to change your proposal,” Draco said gently. “I’m trying to sell it. And, truthfully, it’s better this way. Now, you’ll catch the wizarding families who didn’t meet your initial criteria but still need the help you’re offering. Families with disabilities and illness. Trust me; they exist.”
Potter looked a mess, sitting in the bed with his head tipped back against the wall and his eyes staring, unseeing, at the ceiling. For a moment, Draco was terrified that he’d fallen back into the state he was in before, but then he shifted and looked over at them. A strange emotion passed across his face for a split second—a mix of surprise and fear and anger all at once—and then it was gone.
I don’t know who you think you’re fooling, but I know it’s you. Where are you staying in France? I’ve just arrived.
Until he arrives home one day and falls arse over tit over the couch. When he stands up, rubbing his face where he caught it on the mantle and swearing, he realises the entire room has been rearranged. He stares around, incapable of speech for several long seconds until Draco rushes in.
Maybe there was some truth there. There’d always been something about Potter that drew Draco in… maybe spending this time together trying to fake an outward relationship was messing with his brain. Maybe his pretend flirting was becoming real… it certainly seemed as though Hannah thought so.
Potter pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. It was obvious he was trying to be civil, and since this was what Draco had been waiting for all along, he made himself reluctantly put aside the sarcastic retort that was on the tip of his tongue.
I don’t know how to say this to you, but I’m leaving England in the morning. I’m fully aware that this letter is unsigned and without a seal, and so you may well wonder how you are to know who I am and why you should care. The answers to both of those questions, respectively, are: you aren’t to know, and you don’t care. Simply presume that I am one of your many fans; it is accurate enough, and Lord knows you have enough of them to ensure me some anonymity.
He strolled down the shopping district, searching for a café he remembered from his time here. They’d made an exceptionally good cappuccino, and he was in dire need. Before long, he’d found it tucked away in a little corner of the street, and once he emerged with a steaming ceramic takeaway mug, he felt ready to tackle the day.
The distant lights from the city cast strange shadows on Malfoy’s face, shielding his eyes so that Harry couldn’t quite read Malfoy’s expression. Was he sure? Why wouldn’t he be sure? There were times when he did nothing for days at a time; of course he sat still.
“The first part is complete,” Draco said, running the tiny wand around the cogs to make sure there was no more resistance. “It let me inside.”
Potter stared down into his mug. After a few seconds, his attention snapped up to the coffee pot and then back to the mug with new understanding. “You said I was nesting.”
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco’s waist, and in the stillness of that moment together, Draco knew he had.
Then he was going to give Potter the flat he deserved. He was going to purchase light curtains for the windows and a big, cushy sofa for the living room. He was going to commission artwork for the walls and buy stupid Muggle appliances so that Potter wouldn’t have to use the same pot for every single meal.
Draco sighed and began the slow process of packing up the paper and tape. He tucked the festive present toppers of tinsel and ribbon back into their box, and then stacked the whole thing inside the embroidered footstool by the fire. It was one of the few things he had taken from the Manor when he had moved out. His mother had always hated it, having a particular distaste for tapestry-style artwork that depicted bustling, hectic scenes, but Draco loved it.
Harry tipped his head back and fought back a moan. “I think it sounds like a great plan. Solid plan. I see zero flaws.”
Either way, after an awkward few minutes back at Draco’s hotel where Harry has to convince him that scouring his mouth with steel wool will only cause further problems and possibly hepatitus, Harry books the room next door and the two of them settle into a joint holiday that consists mainly of mimosas and garlic bread.
Draco ran his hands through Potter’s hair, moaning helplessly against his lips as their kiss deepened, each frantically trying to leave their mark on the other, knowing with horrible certainty that this was it, all they’d ever get. It wasn’t fair. The last few days felt like weeks, and Draco had wasted them all. He’d wanted to know more about this strange, bitter version of the boy he’d known, but he hadn’t listened when Potter was practically screaming it to him. His empty flat, his stilted friendships, and the mystery that had drawn Draco back into his life what felt like a lifetime ago—Draco was only now beginning to understand what it all meant, and he was just going to walk away without any clue what he was losing.
“I suppose.” Draco shrugged, gritting his teeth at the barbaric summary but unwilling to argue semantics given the current time constraints. The longer he spent talking to Potter the more he would have to acknowledge how nice the man smelled. “You show all the symptoms, right down to the blue flame flickering in your pupils.” He paused a moment to study the dim reflection that caught the light every few minutes, mixing with the emerald green of Potter’s intense stare. “Quite unmistakeable at that point, even if the other symptoms could be explained.”
“I have to go,” Draco said, a little harsher than he meant to. “Are you coming to Blaise’s party on Saturday?”
Three hours later, his mild frustration had given way to something new. It was an insidious feeling, something faint and barely within reach. The more he read, the more it grew, steadily creeping along his spine until he could feel it thudding in every pulse of his heartbeat and he had to shove the book away. After several seconds of chilling silence, he realised it was despair.
Harry’s stomach suddenly felt full of butterflies, and despite the fact that they were surrounded by people, he found himself smirking back and wishing, just for a moment, that he could kiss Malfoy right then and there.
Potter smirked. It was an odd expression on his face, and one that sent a strange warmth flipping over in Draco’s stomach. “Unicorn hair core?” He shook his head.
from the desk. It flew over obediently and he leafed through the pages with his free hand until he found the one he wanted.
“You’re happy there?” she asked. “The furniture has been rearranged a little since you were here last, so feel free to take any of the other seats.”
Eventually, Potter turned to him. His eyes were still faintly unseeing, like a sheet of muted glass had dropped between them, but he was closer now. Draco thought that if he reached out, Potter would feel solid beneath his fingertips. He hadn’t thought that before.
“After the war, Harry was all over the place,” she said in a hushed voice. “He’d be crying one moment—never in front of us, mind you—and then the next second he’d be laughing hysterically over nothing. We could say the stupidest joke, and he’d be off. We figured he was grieving, so we didn’t want to press him, but eventually it just got…” she trailed off.
Miles blinked in surprise, but covered it quickly by shaking Draco’s hand. It was a distinctly clammy experience. “A pleasure, Mr. Malfoy.”
He felt suddenly awkward, uncertain about his welcome. Uncertain, too, about whether he should be doing this at all.
There would be a tie of fate behind this mess, and Draco would discover it and mark his tally one count closer to the end of what he owed. Then he’d pay the last of it and be free of fate forever. But first, he had to get rid of the fucking curse.
Their lips curved together, warm and soft. The conversation fell away, replaced by the gentle heat of their languid exploration. Harry shifted his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, running his fingers across bare skin and tugging at his waist band questioningly.
Draco stared at the rain pouring down the glass, and he wondered if it had ever stormed so much as it had this year or if it were only that he had never noticed.
“Ah,” he said wisely, leaning back in his chair. “And, like a conscientious mate, you’re willing to prepare your new lovenest to their liking?”
“Several times this month, I’m sure. What in particular have you done that has caused this latest wave of melancholy?”
“What if we didn’t have to stay virgins? You said yourself that sex is probably pretty good. You want to know what it feels like, and so do I, so why not? Why not us try it together and see what we make of it? We’re both new at it, so it’s not like it’d be any more embarrassing than not knowing anything when your partner knows loads.”
Potter looked at him strangely but nodded, stepping back so that Draco could cast a number of charms over the shielded packages and then give him the all clear.
“Oh, the flu’s going around at the moment!” Evie said, turning to the other mum and widening her eyes. “So late in the season, too!”
Stomach sinking, Harry stuffed the parchment into the pocket of his robes and backed away. It must be a new symptom which meant Harry was likely infected, and…
Draco flicked his wand and a tiny vial came racing out of the cupboard. He handed it wordlessly to Potter and waited until the shudders had passed.
Potter shrugged, leafing idly through the book he had just shut. “Well they were only a lead at first, but then the feathers kept responding strangely to me.”
He nodded, and Potter released his wrist, Draco only now realising that he had been holding it all this time. His skin felt cold at the loss of contact.
Embarrassingly, he kept slipping out while doing his almost dance trying to find a comfortable and also decent angle.
Stupidly, and in a very Harry-like fashion, which had got him into trouble many times before and probably would many more times in the future, he opened his mouth and didn’t think at all.
Potter’s fingers brushed against his as he took the paper cup, and Draco felt a rise of irritation at the way it made his heart leap. He sat down in his surprisingly still vacant seat and marvelled at how the strange circumstances of the last three days had led to such an unpredictable moment.
There was a wizarding café not far from here. It was how they got home every night without splinching themselves, but Harry still hated taking the Floo. He preferred to wait until he was sober enough to Apparate.
Draco felt wrong-footed all of a sudden. He’d thought they were going to argue about their old school mates—that there was some childhood grudge to do with Smith that Potter needed to get off his chest. Maybe an ex-lover. And now they were talking about some kid?
Slipping from his bed, he realised something aside from the shock of his dream had awoken him. A steady sound thrummed through his cottage, almost beyond his hearing. Like a pounding, beating drum.
No, I’m not drunk. I just got a really weird letter from Draco Malfoy. Stupid git thinks he’s being anonymous, but I’d know his ridiculous handwriting anywhere. Plus no one else talks like that. Galleons or not? Do you think I need to pack a coat? Is it cold there this time of year?
He heard a sharp intake of breath, but beyond that, there was no response. Harry wasn’t sure where the thought had come from; Malfoy
Draco met her eyes then, and for once the empathy didn’t overwhelm him. He stopped pushing it away and let it fill him instead. He opened his mouth to address everything she’d said, but he couldn’t find the words, couldn’t figure out how to express the depth of emotion he was feeling for her right that second. In the end, all he said was, “Thank you, Pansy.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Sure. Fine. So I’ve been looking into the wards we want to use, and I highly recommend this one.” He pushed a smaller book across the table.
Suddenly, the enormity of what he’d proposed—what had been accepted—hit him, and Harry was overwhelmed with a sense of panic. Was he supposed to make a move now? What was considered appropriate? Should he just launch himself at Malfoy and have at it? No, of course not—that was ridiculous, and probably disrespectful, and, Merlin, now that he was thinking about it, how had he never noticed how good Malfoy looked?
Potter barely even stumbled. Draco was going to have to seriously re-evaluate his opinion of working out if he couldn’t even move a drunk person. Though, surely Potter was sobering up by now—and yet he was still looking at Draco with that oddly glazed, triumphant expression.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. “If he was trying to impress George by trapping him in a box, why is he suddenly afraid to let him go?” he snarled. “Wasn’t this the whole purpose of the exercise?”
But the curse had changed things, reminding him that his relationship to Potter had once been quite different. Once, there had been very little else in Draco’s thoughts but the injustice that was Potter’s existence, and it seemed he needed far less prompting than he would have assumed to go back to that.
Just as he’s getting close, Draco pulls away and mutters a spell beneath his breath. Harry waits for the slickness to appear beneath his legs, but nothing happens, and then Draco is coming closer and sitting down on top of him and it all makes an unexpected and welcome amount of sense. Harry resists the urge to let his eyes roll back in his head and watches instead as Draco guides himself down onto Harry’s cock.
“It’s a mirror ward. Whatever is cast upon it reflects back on the caster. You know what that means?”
“It felt as though everything had just gone away.” His voice took on a dream-like quality for a moment, but then he shook his head and it returned to normal. “I guess I’ve just been really stressed lately. Sorry you had to see that.” He laughed. “At least we won the bet.”
“You’ll pay for that, Potter,” Draco said in a tone that had Harry feeling like he was back in third year all over again.
It turned out that two days seemed to be the turning point for their peers. In that time, they had quickly tumbled through the introductory and settling stages of acquaintanceship with their roommates and blazed right through getting to know each other on a more personal level… in bed.
to be tried out by enthusiastic children. It would have been an insult to the donation if I hadn’t brought them out just in time for Christmas shopping.”
The walls continued to move without stuttering, and Draco decided it was enough time to be certain they were safe. He drew out his notebook from his front pocket, cast a spell with the smaller wand, and began to note down several figures in succession as the spell gave him readings.
“That looks uncomfortable,” Malfoy said with a smirk, staring unashamed at Harry’s growing erection.
He didn’t give Malfoy the chance to respond. He felt awkward and uncomfortable, and so turned on his heel and hurried away from what he was pretty sure was a stunned or maybe speechless Malfoy.
No, it was painfully obvious to anyone who knew him that Draco wasn’t behind this curse, no matter how strategically his presence at the crime might deflect suspicion.
Draco had always known he was attracted to Potter. It was something that had sparked within him a whole lot of grief and self-hatred in fourth year—not because it was a boy, but because it was
Within minutes, it was over. Harry stiffened beneath him and just held him there, his hand clasped around the back of Draco’s neck as he groaned something incomprehensible. The sound went straight to Draco’s spent cock, making it twitch with interest. When the moment had passed, Draco pulled away and let his head fall against Harry’s thigh. He smiled against his skin as Harry’s hand traced idle patterns into his hair.
touching him. He knocked Malfoy’s hand away and replaced it with his own, appreciating the weight of the cock in his hand and the sudden sharp inhale Malfoy made at the contact followed by a quiet, breathy moan as he started moving up and down.
Propelled by something he didn’t fully understand, Harry admitted, “No one was allowed to hug me when I was little.”
“Okay,” Potter said, sounding equally tired, “so that didn’t work. Let’s try to confront the curse again. I nearly got it before.”
As the night went on, without meaning to, Harry found himself matching Malfoy drink for drink, keeping his pace. He wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t like the idea of being drunker than him. He didn’t mind losing a bit of control around the others, but it was the thought of what might happen once they left, what he might say or do, that made him stiffen up and refuse to drink too deeply.
Potter looked up, eyes slightly unfocused as he struggled to put aside the work he was concentrating on. Then, they sharpened, and he sat up straight.
Harry looked over in surprise, and then realised that Malfoy had spoken mostly to himself. The puzzle pieces joined together, and he became aware that Malfoy genuinely thought he was drunk. He wondered what Malfoy was like to talk to when he wasn’t running everything he said through five layers of self-preservation.
At least they’d have to quarantine after this, so they couldn't infect anyone else. Harry was only risking his own health. Malfoy could make his own choices.
“They do,” Potter said, “but wizard clocks monitor a lot more than just time. The Weasley’s clock keeps track of where each family member is, and I’ve seen Luna wear a watch that maps the moonrise. Muggle clocks definitely don’t do that.”
Draco had stayed here for six months or so, not long after the war. His first therapist—the one he’d recommended to Potter—had been back in London. She’d got him to open up, but by the time he was ready to talk about things he was so sick of her saccharinely sweet chatter that he had to leave. He tried a Mind Healer recommended by St Mungo’s, but it had only taken two sessions before he’d had to either leave or punch the smarmy git’s face in. He’d reminded Draco of himself, and at the time that had been the very last thing he’d needed.
“Right,” Ron said, pursing his lips together and looking at the ceiling. “Time for bed before we figure out who it is. Night!”
“Taken care of,” Draco said. He couldn’t find his boxers, so he reluctantly decided to go commando, buttoning up his trousers carefully. “I’ve bought her a disgustingly expensive bottle of wine to go with a disgustingly expensive bottle of perfume from France.”
Their hands were slick now, and Harry knew he wasn’t going to last very long. He didn’t even have the capacity to care right now, to be embarrassed. For the first time, he didn’t feel the need to make some kind of ridiculous competition out of everything, and by the sounds Malfoy was making, he didn’t either.
“My family is in danger, Malfoy,” he spat. “And you’re still spewing petty bullshit. I thought you’d changed. I thought you might have—” he broke off, turning away to run a hand through his hair before speaking again to the wall. “It takes years to become an Unspeakable, you know. And you get to see a lot of shit along the way. My work— My work touches on curses a lot.”
“No wonder it’s spread so quickly.” Malfoy crouched beside him. “We’d better get started. There’s no time to lose, Potter.”
It had been easier to just turn the lights out and trust in the moans of pleasure, hope it was real, but this was different. He knew what Malfoy wanted, knew it from where his eyes landed, the way his breath hitched—knew it because Malfoy had fucking told him, loud and clear, without any opportunity for misunderstandings. And Malfoy knew what Harry wanted too, because, well, Harry was the one doing it. He was showing Malfoy just how he liked it.
“Which one’s yours?” he asked, nodding his head to the crowd that were now standing in a line and practicing the ‘up’ command.
He did look away, though, when Draco jostled him, glaring at him meaningfully until he went about the usual business of unstopping the vial and slicking Draco up. The first press of his finger inside was so much easier than it had been the first time they’d done this. Draco didn’t clamp down on him, and didn’t sound pained at all even as he lubed up a second finger and slid it in alongside the first.
“I’m not sure I do.” Malfoy’s expression had turned suddenly mean, and Harry felt like he’d been thrown straight back to sixth year.
Retail therapy had always been Draco’s go-to. It was enjoyable, distracting, and most importantly required nothing from him emotionally. By lunchtime, his pockets were fall of shrunken bags of clothing, books, an expensive watch that he justified because he’d left home without one, and several pieces of jewelry for Pansy. He’d eyed off a number of ancient texts with Blaise in mind, but he felt he owed Blaise more than a dusty old book, even if the man did go wild for them. He’d settled for a delicate tome on the origins of Herbology and decided to think carefully about something more indicative of the depths of his appreciation.
Few people were out this late on a Tuesday, and the night descended around him in that quiet softness of new snow, making him feel like the only person living for miles. For a moment, he almost turned around and went home, unwilling to ruin the sensation with the sound of drunken revelry, but then thoughts of Potter crept into his mind and he almost ran the last few streets to the Leaky just to escape him.
Draco noticed the hourglass had come to rest on the table between them, its last single grain falling lower and lower.
The last of the curse left him, sapping him of his energy, and he sank to the ground. “What happened?” he asked, stronger this time.
Potter ran a hand through his hair, obviously reluctant to waste a day, but even as he tried to argue it, he was yawning. The bustle of the hospital seemed to grow quiet around them as Potter deliberated. Draco found himself strangely fascinated by the set of his jaw, the small furrow of concern between his brows. It was like he was staring at someone new. He wondered if Potter still confided in Weasley and Granger the way he’d used to at Hogwarts, because he couldn’t imagine the man in front of him confiding in anyone.
Which, as Potter had said, sort of made Pansy’s suggestion to hand him over to Voldemort the smartest. But everyone had been crying too much by then to give that thought much response.
Potter’s eyes lifted to his, and the anguish between them felt distant, like he was viewing it through a pane of glass. How were they going to get out of here? Did the curse show them their worst moments until they broke down under the pain and were no longer capable of fighting back?
At night, they sent each other letters. It started when Draco woke up after a restless night on the couch to a ball of paper hitting him straight in the forehead. He woke with a start, barely having been asleep to begin with, and dived for his wand. By the time he realised it was just a piece of paper, he felt a bit ridiculous but thankful no one was around to see.
“Give it a rest, Potter.” Malfoy’s head tipped sideways, and he glared at Harry from beneath his hair. “You can’t fix everything.”
Draco no longer soared, but the walls of the Manor did fade for his own Sanctuary. Peace filled him, even if it were not quite happiness, and he sank into the knowledge that he had made it through his darkest days and found a safe way to repay Fate for all he had done under the Manor’s roof. People had rejected him, unwilling to accept his clumsy attempts at reparations, but creatures did not. They could not talk back, and he had to repay his debt somehow because Fate required it, and he was his father’s son but he was
Apart from that initial interest hitting him in a rush, it didn’t seem to be physical at all. It didn’t even feel like a lie.
Draco could spot the new faces in the crowd. They were mostly quiet, trying to follow along with the answers a beat behind everyone else. One little girl looked like she was about to be sick.
Draco did, and then he slowed down and pulled back, running a thumb across his lip and glancing down at Harry with a wicked smile. He Accio’d a bottle from his trousers, and held it questioningly in the air.
“Oh, no,” he said wryly, “we still fight. You wouldn’t believe the row we got into the other day, actually. But it’s—it’s good.”
It held the same words as the other two had, but they meant something different to Draco that night. For the first time in weeks, he began to feel hope.
Draco had spent a long time re-evaluating his internal prejudices. Years. You didn’t go through a process like that and come out the other side without noticing a thing or two about the societal cracks you’d been stepping over.
“Well, it was!” Harry retorted cleverly. “Don’t tell me it felt exactly the same for you as when you do it yourself. It was better, right? Different.”
Draco leaned against the rock, forehead pressed against his hands. “I’m not a spy,” he said out of nowhere, needing Potter to believe him.
“Me?” Harry spluttered. “No. Why the hell would I want space? You’re the one who suddenly turned ice cold just because I asked you to give me a real compliment. Was it really that hard to tell me something nice? Surely after everything we’ve been doing, you could pick one thing that you like about me.”
“This is… wow,” said Hermione, sitting back so she was leaning against the armrest and away from them. “I suppose it’s not
“I wonder if Rita will be spying tonight,” Draco mused, mind racing with scandalous rumors they could spread through the pub, tailored for the reporter’s ears.
Professor Staltwort interrupted them, now that everyone had their parchments and a partner or two. “Find somewhere in the sun! It’s a lovely day, we should enjoy it. First ones back who can recite all their partner’s answers without looking get a prize!”
They were in a dark room, lit by a soft, white glow from somewhere Draco couldn’t see. The walls were covered in thick black curtains. When Potter saw these, he stiffened, and Draco unconsciously reached out to run a hand along his back, though he was unsure what had happened.
Well, that had certainly been an interesting way to wake up. Harry could honestly say he’d never experienced anything like it before, and hoped never to again. Just what was Malfoy playing at?
He couldn’t even begin to care about the insult in Malfoy’s words, he was so relieved that it wasn’t going to come to a sudden end. That, if nothing else, was insurance that Malfoy wouldn’t go spreading rumours about Harry’s lack of sexual prowess. Even if he did, Harry had a pretty good idea how to retaliate. And what did it matter, anyways? They’d just end up humiliating and exposing each other to their peers’ ridicule.
“Thanks,” he said, unable to keep himself from flicking a glance down the table to Malfoy, who wasn’t even looking his way. “I’ll… I’ll see how I go.”
The strangeness was still there, evident in the slight fumbling of Potter’s movements, the awkward way he seemed to be unsure of where his body began and ended. Even with the warmth of conversation the two were sharing, Potter seemed absent, like the only moments he was truly here were when they were laughing over the bet. But it was superficial laughter—triumphant and proud, but barely cutting the surface. His eyes kept darting to the door and Draco realised he had chosen the seat against the wall. It sharpened his resolve to end this tonight.
A light breeze swirled through the open window, and the owl ruffled its feathers in simple joy, the mist fading around it. The sun shone through, warm on Harry's bare skin, and beneath fingertips that trailed across Malfoy's chest, he could feel the steady thud of Malfoy's heartbeat. The necessary two weeks of quarantine wouldn’t be so bad now that Harry didn’t have to do them alone, roaming Grimmauld Place like a curse. Now that the world felt a little more reachable, even if he had to put it on pause.
—until he’d realised that he could be attracted to him and still completely hate him, and the world suddenly felt right again.
The way Potter was reacting didn’t make sense. He was so highly strung, so quick to anger. It was like there was something Draco didn’t know, something that was making Potter feel let down or frustrated, but he couldn’t begin to fathom what it might be. And what was all that crap Potter was saying about knowing things, knowing about curses?
“I know you can do this because I know what you’re capable of, Malfoy,” Potter said, and in a voice loaded with meaning, continued, “and I know what you’re not. I know what you went through in that house. I’m sorry that I found out the way I did, but if I had to go back and do it all again, I would, because it got that thing out of me. I owe you for that.”
The fact that Rita Skeeter had just published a riveting exposé on their escapades into Diagon Alley the other day only served to fuel their enthusiasm for the charade.
Harry didn’t say. It wasn’t like he was any more confined than the rest of the professors. And at least he could leave at the end of this.
He swirled the remaining drops of vodka around in his glass and studied his fingernails. His claws only came through under the harvest moon, but his other Veela traits had proven less coy. Small mercy they’d only appeared his sixth year at Hogwarts; it made keeping his family’s secret shame hidden an easy enough task. Few people wanted to date a Malfoy these days, and Draco had even less interest in dating them.
“The headache is temporary.” Draco shot him a dry look. “That’s the good news. The bad news is that you’ve pissed off a territorial Veela, and now we’re both going to pay the price.”
He slides his fingers through Malfoy’s hair and silently promises not to be rough. But then Malfoy moans and pulls Harry closer, wordlessly begging him to take control. He obliges. Slowly, he threads his fingers through the soft, blond strands and thrusts into Malfoy’s eager mouth.
“Potter, if you are for one second implying that I am difficult to manage, then I’ll thank you to recall just the other week when we evacuated these very premises at what can only be described as emergency level haste, for the express purpose of avoiding your confrontation with a past beau.” Draco sneered.
Draco stared at him. If someone had asked him to name all the feelings that were swirling around in his gut right that second, he wouldn’t have been able to. He’d never felt this surge of pride for someone else before—pride and respect and so much warmth it was disgusting.
Draco shut the door carefully behind him and sealed it with a little spell he’d learned from his Aunt. No one was leaving until he said they could. Potter raised his eyebrows at him.
Seconds ticked by slowly. Draco was unwilling to break the silence, not sure what he could say that wouldn’t make it worse but not wanting to leave Potter alone like this. He didn’t know why Potter remained silent, still. Didn’t know why he didn’t just leave or hurl some hex at Draco and turn this argument into something real.
Most of those are just going to filter through the Muggle-borns and half-bloods that we’re trying to reach. It’s just a more long-winded way of doing it.”
Potter’s eyes widened, and Draco was momentarily gratified to see the moment Potter realised he should take this seriously.
“Of course it is,” he muttered, then he took the peacock feather from Harry’s hand and laid it across his wand.
Draco’s stomach did a funny little flip. “He does?” He shook his head. “No, well…” He paused. He hadn’t wanted to voice his fears, but it was true. There was something about this curse that felt off. And if Draco couldn’t identify it…
“No, you bloody haven’t!” Morgan yelled back. “Just give me the box and I’ll let him out back home. I told you not to come near me, Christ, I knew it was going to end up like this somehow.”
The silence stretched, and it was oddly pleasant, until Potter said, “Paying things back doesn’t mean you’re off the hook, though.”
Malfoy grinned, unmistakable delight on his face as he lay back and waited for Harry to catch his breath. After a moment, Harry pulled himself back up onto his elbow and ran his hand along Malfoy’s cock, pushing his hand aside from where he had been wanking himself. The smile dropped away as Malfoy’s eyes fluttered closed and he moaned, soft and ragged.
“You don’t like the Floo either, Potter?” Parkinson asked, rolling her eyes. “Draco says it ruins his clothes.”
The words “we’re friends” echoed around in his mind, and a shiver ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the chill in the air. He shoved it aside; he’d known what was getting into from the start.
“I’m going to—” Harry began, but broke off, burying his face in Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy stroked him through his orgasm until Harry pulled away with a gasp and flopped back against the pillows. “Just a sec,” he breathed.
Potter looked up at him, green eyes piercing and dark with lust, and Draco knew he was gone. He pressed his face into the wall and shut his eyes, gripping the headboard so tightly he could feel the blood draining away from his knuckles. It was barely enough distraction to keep his movements to a minimum, to keep from letting go and just fucking Potter’s face, hard and rough, like he seemed to want it.
“Here with you. There’s this dream…” Potter broke off but met his eye, and flame flickered there, and Draco stopped caring about controlling the curse at all.
“Okay, so first of all,” Potter said, rubbing his head and wincing. “That was not my plan. Christ, Malfoy, what do you take me for?”
Did you know that my mother used to take me there when I was a boy? It was a treat when Father was running errands halfway across the continent, searching for the remains of the Dark Lord. Of course, I didn’t know that until I was much older.
When they realised, George quickly withdrew the product line and began tweaking the samples, muttering quietly to Harry and Ron when Molly wasn’t listening that he was planning on a new range for adults. Under the counter, so to speak.
Except, it turns out that what most people desire is sex—not exactly the kind of thing you want to be experiencing in the middle of a classroom, and particularly not with the additional quirk the product has developed.
Malfoy sighed, the force of the exhalation hitting Harry in a wave of peppermint and gin. “The reason I’m choosing not to take you home is because I’m very, very good at fucking people, Potter.” The words sank into Harry’s brain and made him dizzy. He forced himself to keep listening. “What I’m not good at is everything else: being vulnerable, being intimate.”
Potter grimaced, and something beneath the anger broke free. Suddenly, he looked so completely lost that Draco stopped and simply stared at him.
“I want to make you feel like that,” Draco finished, leaning forward to kiss him again, slow and languid.
. Harry leaned in, accidentally bumping their noses together as they met eagerly, lips parting as they kissed each other like they’d been apart for days.
Harry reached up, this time running his hands along Malfoy’s smooth jaw, and pulled him back down into another kiss.
After a moment of silent arguing in his head, Draco fetched the two glasses and handed one to Potter, sitting down beside him. They drank in silence and lay back on the floor just before everything faded to black.
Eventually, he’d run so far he’d ended up here. He hadn’t intended to keep searching for therapists, but he’d found one all the same. In the middle of a night quite similar to this one, he’d sent up a beacon from his wand. It wasn’t meant to reach anyone—didn’t even mean anything. It was just a bright, golden light full of glittering blue stars, filling a tiny corner of the sky above France. He’d lit up the night for hours, lying on the top of these apartment roofs while confused Muggles crowded below and tried to work out where the fireworks were coming from.
“I want you,” Malfoy said simply, and it was so open, so free of double meaning or confusion, that Harry momentarily lost his breath. Malfoy kept speaking. “I want you spread out in front of me, naked and dripping. I want you on your knees. I want you on your back, my mouth around your cock, and the sound of your begging in my ears.”
Malfoy hugged him. The velvet of his dressing gown was warm as Malfoy slid his arms around Harry’s waist, even through the layer of Harry’s pyjamas, and before he knew what he was doing, he was hugging Malfoy back. He buried his face in the soft material of Malfoy’s shoulders, closing his eyes into the warmth and clean—oddly sweet—smell from the fabric.
“You’re good for him,” she said, giving him a final squeeze before breaking away. “Thanks for seeing what we didn’t.”
Potter reached forward and brushed a strand of Draco’s hair back from his forehead. Draco had never felt more hopeless than he did in that moment where he had everything he so desperately wanted, and none of it in the right way.
—and left the shop, intending to head straight for the Weasley store. He barely made it five paces before the ground shook with a force so strong he had to hold onto the lamp post beside him lest he fall straight back onto his arse. When the smoke had cleared, his eyes fell straight on the source of the explosion, and before he knew it he was already running, shoving his way through the crowd until he fell through the door of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with his wand outstretched.
The way Potter looked at Draco hadn’t changed. The way he hung on Draco’s words, even if he hated them, hadn’t changed. The way he made Draco feel seen and heard and
In all honesty, he felt like he had at Hogwarts, drawn to the golden boy who broke all the rules but could do no wrong. But this time round, it was like the resistance was gone. He was older now, and he was just so tired. Draco recalled the sensation of hating Potter, of needing him to fail and Draco to win, but it was as though someone had just taken that away.
He turned away, staring at the tears in the wallpaper, the way the shadows elongated down the walls as the sun dipped below the horizon.
The casual angle of his lean seemed suddenly deliberate, forced. Draco willed himself to act normal, like he was talking to a wild animal who was about to spook.
Before he had the chance to react, he pushed Draco out of bed, ignoring his indignant squawk as he hit the cold floor and spelled the curtains closed against any retaliatory actions Draco might take.
He remembered that night strongly now—the way Potter had looked as he’d recounted the events of the forest, the way their friends had one by one broken down at the memory. Most of all, Draco remembered the way he’d needed to excuse himself from the room because he couldn’t fucking
“You’re not going to leave well enough alone, are you?” Draco asks, dropping his magazine and glaring at Harry from over the top of his aviators.
Potter laughed softly. “You don’t have to come. Bill and Fleur can find a place for you—somewhere safe, with the Order.”
Potter shifted against the wall, finally looking away from Draco and relaxing the intensity he seemed to embody with every breath. “Terrible.”
“That explains the psychical readings,” he murmured, once he’d noted down the final reading. “Not only does this curse contain a compulsion spell, but it alters your conscious state. It must be why Ron won’t wake up. If it had been part of the explosion, it should have passed by now, but since it’s lingering—”
“Malfoy, if there’s something bothering you, you have to get it off your chest now,” he warned. “We can’t be distracted.”
“Oh,” Draco murmured, too relieved to see with his own eyes that Potter wasn’t in the middle of doing something rash and stupid. Probably. “Forgive me for attempting a little courtesy. Potter, do you really live like this?”
He drew back and added a finger, pressing inside and twisting gently until he landed on the place that made Potter’s face twist into desperation, nonsensical pleas falling from his lips.
At this, Draco huffed a laugh. “I learned how to avoid that one by the age of fourteen. How many of them does she have now?”
Draco didn’t have the brain space available to process this strange new witch, or the fact that Hermione Granger seemed perfectly happy to treat him like an ordinary person, so he turned back to the shelves and began loading up on everything he could possibly need, along with extra.
“You’re just in time,” Potter murmured, staring into some contraption Draco had never seen before. Made of a series of three glass orbs, it hovered in the air between them. As Draco watched, something floating in the central orb caught the light, and he realised each sphere was filled with feathers.
didn’t make sense, because it absolutely made a difference—they could make each other sick. Harry could make Malfoy sick, and the hex could activate before Malfoy found a cure, and what if there
Beside him, Potter was leaning back on his hands and twirling the pendant around in circles. It was maddening.
“Sorry, darling.” Narcissa rose and swept him into a hug. “It’s just been so long. Did you know that Pansy has an exhibition opening in New York next year?”
“What the fuck happened to the furniture?” He doesn’t mean to say it like that, but his heart is racing, and the impromptu date from last Friday has suddenly settled into an awful sort of context.
I don’t know if this is some sort of test or something, but I’m ready for your next letter… Where do you want me to visit next? I promise I won’t hound you to meet me.
The sound of a foot scuffing across the path came from behind the bench and startled him. When he turned to see piercing green eyes staring back at him, for a single moment, he froze in fear. But then everything else faded away and he remembered he could do this. It was only Potter.
Draco waved in his pinboard while they were talking and marked off the final—or ninety ninth, technically—debt owed. A warm pool of contentment settled in his chest; he’d done it. One more to go: just this blasted curse with its notation on his board exasperatingly free of any connecting ties, and he would be free. He would never succumb to the horrifying tuberculosis-ridden end his father had chosen.
I may be a bit clueless when it comes to other people, sometimes, but I do know that. It’s really just about being honest, mate. Not just out loud, but to yourself—for the parts inside that hurt too much to admit.
He stared down at the flowering succulent in the pot below him. A bee buzzed over to the flower, somehow finding it worthwhile to climb all the way up here for pollen.
Draco didn’t recognise the area they landed in. Even if he could have, the snow was falling too thickly for him to read the street sign. They were surrounded by neat townhouses, a little run down, but certainly not dilapidated. Brightly coloured lights twinkled softly from fenceposts and roofs, making their path a little easier to see in the weak moonlight.
Draco took a moment to collect himself in Potter’s absence, glancing around the room to see who was looking his way. Several eyes watched Potter as he left the room, but none of them seemed concerned with where the Chosen One was going. No one made a move to follow.
He found a blank piece of parchment, penned a swift note, and sent it immediately. Then, feeling the effects of all that he had tried to pretend he hadn’t drunk, he went straight to bed.
Blaise’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re kidding me.” He turned to Potter. “Shouldn’t you know better? You’re an Unspeakable, aren’t you?”
“But this is just going to filter all the Muggle-borns and half-bloods through anyway,” he said, tone now confused instead of angry. “Look at these questions.” He slid the parchment back and pointed. “
“Please tell me that’s not work.” Pansy stood up to look over his shoulder. “I may as well leave now if it is.”
Something heated flashes in Draco’s eyes, but it’s there and gone again in a second, and Harry thinks he must have imagined it.
Draco only managed to pay attention to half his meetings that afternoon; the rest of his mental energy was spent on the mystery of Potter.
“Weird good or weird bad?” He finally drew his eyes away from where Malfoy was clenching down on him, little spasms that felt incredibly odd.
Beneath the layers of confusion and rediscovered emotion in Harry’s head, a tiny sliver of understanding began to unfurl. “Continue what it was doing? What do you mean?”
“Don’t let Hermione hear you,” Ron hissed, comically stretching his neck around the door to peer down the hallway, like he expected Hermione to be lurking outside.
After an uncomfortable greeting where Draco tried his best to look as though he hadn’t been five minutes away from strangling their honorary brother, the four of them went back into the workroom.
He shoves the thought aside for a moment and pulls back. Draco is still looking at him like it might be true, and Harry has spent enough time around Pansy Parkinson to know the only form of reassurance Draco responds to.
Heat coursed through Draco as the curse latched onto their blood, thriving as the walls closed in tighter. Blue flame flickered in Potter’s eyes, and Draco wanted to burn in it.
Draco scrubbed his palm across his face and winced, suddenly feeling immensely tired. “Potter, you know I’m the Veela, right?”
Potter rolled his eyes. “Christ, Malfoy. Can you not be a giant git for just five seconds? I don’t know why I even bothered.”
He cleared his throat, trying to work out the best way to begin this. “We need to make them think they have the upper hand,” he said. “No matter how natural we make it, if we act like we’re falling for each other out of nowhere, they’ll suspect we’re up to something. But if we let them think they’ve foiled our attempt at tricking them, but that we accidentally stumbled on something real in the process… well.” He finished his drink and poured another.
As his rapid breathing faded, giving way once more to the silence of the night, he allowed himself one small moment to acknowledge that part of him wanted Potter to ask him out for real. It wasn’t a big deal, just a passing thought, but still… it would be nice.
“We’re setting you up in the Astronomy tower,” Professor McGonagall explained after the table had passed through the basic niceties of people who haven’t seen each other in a long time and who are sort of famous for various reasons.
The girl immediately turned her attention on him, delighted to expand her audience. “It does! It even has ones that Aunty Morgan doesn’t know! She tells the
The pointy git is actually opening up to you, by the sound of it. Merlin knows why, but if you want to make sure he doesn’t regret it and send you packing, you need to reciprocate.
They fell into silence, something between them shifting and changing under the fading afternoon sun, though Draco couldn’t be certain what it was. Eventually, they finished their tea and Potter went back to examining the wards and making a list of everything they would need to install the complex new protection spells.
Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together. “How did you know that?” He shook his head. “Clearly, you spent far too much time in your youth stalking me, Potter. It’s a little sad.” He smirked suddenly. “Maybe that’s why I wrote down ‘dog’ for you—subconsciously I just knew you spent too much time sniffing around.”
“Hang on…” Draco frowned. He’d been so caught up in the shame of his family’s impure bloodline and the fact Potter was somehow now a part of it that he hadn’t registered the enormous leaps of deduction Potter was making. “What do peacocks have to do with Veela?”
Ministry involvement in his life isn’t usually something he has to worry about, these days. Not since he hit the age of twenty seven and told Kingsley politely but firmly that if he had to sign one more piece of his life and privacy away in the name of celebrity, he was going to shove every last sheet of the paperwork involved up Kingsley’s backside. The threat worked for a while, particularly when it had been delivered with calm certainty and a procedurally informative gesture, but had unfortunately lost its staying power in the last six months. All it had taken was Witch Weekly to run a “Savior or Silver Fox?” edition, and suddenly it was like Harry was seventeen again. But this time, he was even less interested in what the media had to say and at least thirty percent more likely to hex someone for winking at him suggestively.
Draco tuned them out as they started down the stairs. He turned back to Morgan, who was looking equal parts relieved and terrified.
“They like it when you dance for them,” Draco murmured, wiping a hand across his face. His voice sounded strange, like the edge of a shriek.
The first night he had come here, he’d been in too much of a state to take it in, but now he was seeing everything for the second time, and it was just as bleak as he’d thought. There was hardly any furniture, and what was there was old and worn. It was as if Potter never entertained at all, and he’d filled the flat with the least amount of furniture he could possibly get by with.
Draco felt a flood of fear course through him as he recognised Hogwarts on the night of the battle. Screams and explosions sounded from all around them, and on instinct he ducked just as a giant’s arm crashed through the window above his head.
If he were to have walked through the door at that exact moment, he would have thought Malfoy was asleep. Somehow, the knowledge that what they’d done had caused Malfoy to look this way made something pleasant tingle in his chest.
“Did you know, Potter,” Draco said, deliberately lowering his voice in a way that would capture attention. “That your eyes are Slytherin green?”
“We’ve got a few new faces today,” Harry said, smiling down at them all. “So we might start back at the basics. Who here has ridden a kid’s broom before?”
For a moment, it felt like they were floating. The world around them was full of shadows, and Draco realised with a sudden rush of euphoria that he was looking straight out into the Ether. Glittering dully in the dim light, broken gears floated upward, some still ticking faintly around, searching for their partner.
She shrieked and whacked him on the shoulder before standing up. “Right then. We’re off. See you lot next week?”
The words were too light, too distant. Draco had the strangest feeling that Potter wasn’t even in the room with him.
“Your angle is too wide,” Potter instructed, after they’d each scored a handful of unacknowledged points by directing the Quaffle to thwack against shoulders and legs. He sighed, dropping his hands, including the one holding the Quaffle, and shrugged awkwardly. “You always did that in school, too. I can show you if you like.”
All Harry could think about was how good he smelled and just how much he wanted to bury his face in Draco’s neck, and suddenly all he wanted was to get back to their room and lock the door.
Even the knowledge that he was doing something so stupid and irreversible as pining after the impossible wasn’t enough to completely ruin his mood, though it was making him more introspective than normal. He wondered if, had he been able to avoid this curse business and live his life with a continued distance from Potter, would he have been able to avoid this realisation? Or was it simply one of those things that had a sinking inevitability to it? Perhaps he had only ever been living on borrowed ignorance, and now his stash had run out.
Inside his tiny, Transfigured room, Harry stared at the walls and wondered where it had all gone wrong. Not the curse—they were all in the dark there—but himself. His brain was… like powder these days. A gritty cloud of meaningless thought. It had been a slow descent, starting well before the curse emerged, but somehow not noticeable until it did.
Draco’s head hurt. He was just a kid; it was clear in every part of his body language that he’d had no idea what he was doing. It was familiar, and it made his heart ache.
Looking at the careful way Malfoy held himself now, he found himself more curious than ever about what was going on inside his head. Had it started back then? It was nearly three years ago now. Had Malfoy been different all this time?
“Well, what does he care?” Weasley spat, still clearly incensed. “He doesn’t care about Harry. He doesn’t know what we—” He broke off.
They stared at one another, chests heaving with adrenaline, eyes too filled with terror to hide behind walls or protections. Just two boys, lost on some shore together—for once, on the same side.
He gave a sigh and scratched the back of his head, staring distantly at the far end of the corridor, where the Weasleys waited.
His head rolled sideways, and he found Potter already looking at him. It occurred to Draco that he was the least appropriate person to be sharing this moment with the golden child of Gryffindor, but as he took in the tired lines of Potter’s face and the overwhelming sense of loneliness that drifted from him in waves, he realised that he was the only one Potter would have allowed. Because Draco was lost, floating completely and utterly adrift from everything he had ever known or believed in.
Potter laughed—a humourless sound that sent shivers down Draco’s spine. “Right. Well. Enjoy your night, guys. I’m suddenly not in the mood.”
Potter regarded him with an unreadable expression. “You don’t think we should try something a little simpler first? Something more casual?”
The moment of silence went on too long before Hermione cleared her throat and began to ask how he was finding it so far. But despite the strangeness, Harry noticed that Malfoy was beginning to relax.
Draco sighs. “You’re no fun to tease anymore. You don’t rise to the bait like you did when we were children.”
Draco gaped at her. He started to nod, trying to think how to tactfully ask her if she was drunk, but before he’d thought of the words she’d pounced on him, enveloping him into a giant hug. After a second, he relaxed, bringing his arms around her waist and resting his forehead against the warm sweetness of her hair.
He realised Malfoy was talking to him, and looked over to see he was gesturing to a sunny spot by the fountain.
“Your classmates will ask you about the Manor when you return, Draco,” his father said, struggling to maintain the authoritative drone that had used to define him. “You will tell them nothing.”
“I like it. You’re right; they’re going to be expecting this. If they think they’ve beaten us to it, they might let their guard down.”
Then, he remembered he was a wizard. He waved a hand absently and their clothing vanished. Harry’s eyes widened in surprise, and then he grinned, turning so that he could shove Draco up against the lockers.
The words broke off as Potter, obviously having had enough, stepped around the corner and caught him in an Incarcerous with ropes that were a deep midnight blue. They wrapped around the startled boy in the corner—he looked about twenty years old, with a head of fiery red hair—and pulled tight.
“Coming!” he laughed nervously and put the thought out of mind as he scrambled to dress in record time. Just like being back at school, he reflected.
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry, the league doesn’t start until October. They’re just doing practice now.”
Malfoy made a noncommittal noise at the back of his throat and glanced at the others. “I’ll see you later on, I think,” he said quietly.
With one hand, he gripped the base of Draco’s cock while the other drew idle patterns beneath, along the curve of his arse, and he stopped teasing. Draco’s back arched off the table as Harry slid lower down, caressing Draco with his lips and tongue, sucking gently at the tip and then sliding back down.
“You know,” he says carefully, tucking the suitcases into his jacket pocket. “Just because your life lacks privacy, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a little fun with it.”
He rounds the corner at the bottom of the stairs and finds Malfoy standing by the sink, looking at the dishes with a perplexed frown on his face. The fading sunlight barely makes it over the ridge of the window, sending scattered light across Malfoy’s face. The sharp shadows formed by the angles of his cheeks and nose compete with the more gentle shade of the leaves on the oak tree outside the window, and Harry can’t look away from the way it softens Malfoy’s features. Orange light glints through the glass, and he feels as though everything is caught in that moment of breath right before a sigh—the moment you allow yourself to relax.
