“Err. No, we learnt practical skills mostly” Draco dismissed.
“What’s your life like Potter? The lifestyle of the rich and infamous.”
Dudley turned and looked at Draco, “How are you bloated? Weren’t you at work?”
“oh..” Draco realised his enthusiasm waning suddenly.
Then an idea struck him. A patsy! Draco needed to merely find another boy about his age and have them disguise themselves with polyjuice potion.
“Where is Harry?”
Harry felt awkward but followed Draco to the bathroom, feeling his throat tighten and his breathing quicken. He was not sure what Draco had in mind, and he was nervous about what this would entail…
“Err yeah, you wanted to see me,” Draco said giving a nod like he didn’t particularly care.
Ok the Rondwandelen concept is 100% artistic license and I took inspiration from the Amish Rumspringa.
Draco nodded and withdrew into the kitchen trying to steel himself. He was Harry, he needed to keep up the charade. As he opened the fridge his stomach gurgled once again aching to be filled. Dudley had certainly ruined him. He removed the box of doughnuts along with a bottle of lemonade. It didn’t take long for the tea to brew. He carried it all on a tray and placed it down on the coffee table. Hermione’s older sons snatched up glasses and doughnuts, while Hermione handed her younger two children the plastic cups Draco had managed to find at the back of one of the cupboards. The three oldest sat near the television still more interested in the video game than their Mum's conversation.
"I did no such thing," Lucius snapped, not willing to admit how right his wife was. It was different, joining the Death Eaters compared to Abraxas' unscrupulous business dealings. But he often thought deeply about what other options he thought he'd had at the time. In retrospect, it was difficult to think of what else he could have done. "But let's drop the subject," he went on, and put a finger on his chin in a thoughtful gesture. "It's high time for the boy to do his
“Yeah.”
Dudley sighed, “Just eat some. Whatever you can’t, I’ll shove in the fridge.” He knew Harry would pick at it and eat less than a third. He wasn’t sure why he even bothered at this point.
“Our clothes will not fit quite right, so we had best go down to our drawers,” Draco said, misinterpreting Harry’s astonishment. Harry averted his eyes and mumbled, “Sorry,” without thinking.
“Find me in the club later. I have a proposition” Draco offered. He stepped back, he hadn’t meant to say that and yet.
“Online? Internet explorer, yahoo?” Dudley commented.
“Just act like a lad” Dudley insisted. “Recording now,” Dudley said pressing a button on the camera.
To be honest, Harry’s desperate orphan heart felt like it could stand a year being mercilessly henpecked by a doting parent. It sounded like balm to his oldest, deepest wounds. And here was Draco Malfoy, offering it so glibly!
Hermione frowned further, “I hadn’t realised..”
Ch 8 -
Draco explained. “But no I’m not in trouble not in the way your thinking. I just need to escape.”
“Here,” Draco said putting his hand on her back the other on her hugely soft stomach as he helped her to the couch. “How was Bulgaria?”
“No, No it’s all good” Frank reassured, “It’s more a social thing? If you wanted to hang out after work tomorrow. Go to the pub? Have a few drinks?”
He picked up his small suitcase and Apparated to central London. He just needed to find the right person for the job… perhaps someone who suffered from the loss of a parent and would benefit from some intensive mothering? Yes, that sounded about right…
Hermione Granger stood there with her arms crossed looking unimpressed. “Hello Harry,” she said firmly.
Harry nodded and cut a chunk of his dark hair off with a pair of nail scissors he produced. Harry unplugged the bottle and pushed the hair in before replacing the cork and shaking the bottle.
Draco laughed aloud at that. “Amusing, Potter. Quite amusing. No,” he reiterated, “this meeting is just good fortune. I haven’t seen you here before.”
Harry sat silently, dark bags under his eyes, his face looked gaunt lips chapped.
“Can’t wait. Ciao bella”
“Yes well Harry did” Draco replied.
“Really?” Draco questioned.
“See you at work tomorrow” Frank replied.
. The list of necessities is on my desk in the library. See to it that only the most simple, plain items are selected, and not a single thing more than is on that list."
“Good” Jacinder pulled on Draco’s shirt. Kissing him firmly. His tongue pressing inside Draco’s mouth and teeth knocking together. Draco let himself be swept up into the bittersweet kiss.
“Indeed,” Draco agreed, and seemed to assert that smug look that was too familiar on his face. “So it sounds as though you accept the terms of this little arrangement.”
Truthfully Draco preferred someone who at least contrasted his figure. But he could appreciate Harry’s painfully thin build.

"It's different, my love," Narcissa entreated, folding in on herself sadly. "Your father did heinous things. You
Draco nodded and walked further down the street, offering a casual wave and smile to Jacinder.
“Frank, He asked me out” Draco smiled.
And Draco had a polyjuice potion variant he had worked on with Uncle Severus (rest the poor bloke’s soul) that permitted its user to have a permanent mask for the entire time patient took a regular dose of potion as a capsule one time per day. It was one of Uncle Severus’ strategies to possibly hide Draco in plain sight should the need arise.
“What’s that smile for?” Dudley asked curiously.
Harry couldn’t help but think to himself - it was at her behest that he was now sitting here, underground, in this secluded place. But he found a tug at his heartstrings as he felt the radiant warmth from Narcissa.
Dudley smirked and leaned over and began to massage Draco’s belly, slow and firm circles. “You have to all that gas out. Otherwise, you won’t have room for more.
Draco considered, a lad. He tried to think of any lads and then he realised act like Goyle.
Draco hoped that would be enough.
Draco pulled away and forced a smile. “I cost you your job.”
and I are co-writing this <3 <3 <3
Draco tugged on the metal bar pushing down on it and feeling it giveaway. He stepped back and a doorway revealed itself allowing Draco to step through.
“Ah. Well I was actually asking about the sign in the window. About a job?” Draco asked.
Dudley had suggested therapy, but apparently, Wizards don’t do that. Which sounded like nonsense, not having therapy is how you get Wizard Hitler.
Dudley nodded, “yeah of course. I work down at the garage. I do other work too.”
“Can’t” was all Draco could reply before he belched again.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Lucius pulled the lever to open the gate. The magical apparatus seemed to know how irate Lucius was - it squeaked open deferentially, permitting Lucius to push Draco out with a single elegant hand. The latch snapped closed again straight after, leaving a teary eyed Draco grasping at the iron bars.
The uncomfortable bubbly feeling of polyjuice started to do its work, and quicker than Harry could have guessed or expected, all of a sudden he saw himself across the room, and saw Draco where his own reflection should have been.
“Right. We’ll drop in a resume and I’ll give it a look. My Dads retiring as his altzimers is getting a little worse for wear. And I need someone more reliable than a high schooler.”
them, in working for the Dark Lord."
Hermione blushed her round cheeks becoming pink. “Should I send an owl to you? I mean Harry?”
Draco laughed, “Please I have a perfect figure.”
Draco frowned, wondering if he had underestimated his mother’s true intentions. Especially if she’d been in correspondence with Harry before all of this went down.
“Blonde skinny.” Draco dismissed.
So, Draco headed to the dark light district where he knew there were a number of gay nudie bars. The right kind of bloke could be found there, no doubt….
“I know you said that,” Hermione said frowning slightly. “But I thought you were going to wait until I had your baby?”
“That’s fine” Draco nodded.
Harry nodded, feeling like his chest was getting tight. Why was he starting to actually consider this fool’s errand? Despite everything, the whole premise of taking over Draco’s life… he was starting to entertain the notion. He must have been mental.
“Indeed,” Draco sniffed, and he reached for Harry’s shirt. “Right then.” He put on the garment and then grabbed Harry’s trousers and slipped them up easily. Harry did the same actions with Draco’s outfit as well, feeling three times more awkward than Malfoy. He wanted to explore the other boy’s body - how it felt, how he needed to adjust his bearings, and all that.
Hermione nodded inhaling a couple of doughnuts impressively easily. Although given her figure it made sense Granger would have a greedy streak.
“That is not something you should be proud of” Draco winced honestly.
“It’s okay” Jacinder teased.
Dudley sighed, “Just try. I told you I can copy these onto tapes that get sent to me. People enjoy this.”
The Dark Light District was located off Shaftesbury Ave, it’s exterior resembled that of west end theatre in between shows. Doors closed off and poster holders empty and white. All of which covered in a healthy layer of graffiti. To Muggles it was nothing.
When Harry walked over he had a pleasant smile. He sat down beside Draco and held out a duffle bag. “Brought you a change of clothes, keys to my cousins place and a few things, and my Glasses” Harry said sliding it over.
Draco waited patiently sipping a vodka soda occasionally stirring the wedge of lime with a straw. Potter did look quite wonderful like that, thin and bony.
The bathroom was dimly lit, but functional. Draco began immediately to unbutton his shirt, and Harry’s voice caught in his chest. He opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say.

Dudley nodded and patted Draco’s belly. “That’s what I wanted to hear.”
Harry nodded seemingly understand. “I thought perhaps you might consent to swapping, you take my place with mother. Let her fuss and spoil you. And I’ll live as you. For a year at most” Draco suggested.
Ch 7 -
“Quite quickly yes. Frankly, he’s obviously got some demons lurking, given how underfed he was. What’s the muggle word that Dudley suggested. Depressed” Draco said firmly.
“Alright then,” Malfoy said, and rolled his shoulders back. “I guess I’ll shove off, then. Take care of my mother, right?”
“Yes,
“Do not worry,” Narcissa beamed, “I can have them all down here for you, too. Now that you know that I know. I love and accept you for who you are, my child - and I have always known you were destined for more greatness than could be contained in your lithe little body. If only because I saw the light constantly dim in your eyes every time your father chastened you for taking even the tiniest step towards indulging your appetite.”
Draco nodded, “Here let me help you up,” he said helping Hermione heave herself to her feet.
“Ah thank you” Draco said smiling at Dudley.
No, Lucius reflected, it was long since time that Draco grew up a bit. The family tradition would be carried out, regardless of Narcissa’s criticism that the practice was cruel on multiple levels. No, Lucius decided - the former Malfoy men were right to insist on the tradition, and Luciusshould never have doubted their wisdom. A boy needs to be cut loose from their mother’s apron string eventually…. *traumatized* or not.  Narcissus was bleating on like a lamb about things she knew too little about. Draco needed to cultivate certainty and courage, that was for certain.
“Please Granger or is it Krum now? Never mind. But that would explain some of your weight certainly, but not quite the excess.”
At least Potter has a roof over his head.
Harry looked uncertain, “won’t your mother notice? Or realise?”
“You’ll make an interesting drab” Jacinder grinned.
The second was well. Hermione looked rather different than when he’d seen her last. She was as round in circumference as she was tall. Her body was mostly defined by an utterly enormous belly. Her bosom was heavy and round sitting pendulously on the top of her gut. While her belly seemingly swelled out from her chest down to her knees. Her face was round double chins and plump cheeks that gave Hermione rounder features, although with her ridiculously curly hair. It almost suited her.
and I are co-writing this <3 <3 <3
“Must I?” Draco groaned. “I don’t think I’ll manage to finish five pizzas.”
Poor Draco wouldn't know what hit him.
If Draco had it his way, he would go off and simply start his own life. He would just get a job and quietly fade out of his parents’ sphere of influence. And then, then! They could not say Boo to him about who he chose to fuck.
“Malfoy,” He said forcing a smile, but his eyes said leave.
“Where’s Harry?”
In the end, though, the biggest point of curiosity was undeniable: what did Draco’s member look like?
“But you said that wasn’t…” Her second-oldest son asked. Hermione shushed him, and they all said goodbye.
Draco explained the Polyjuice potion and the situation with his parents. The Gap year, his Mother’s plea and his agreement with Harry.
“I had rather assumed you had me followed,” Harry murmured.
“It’s deserved,” Hermione said firmly. “I can’t believe you’d be reckless enough to con Harry into this? And what about Dudley?”
Draco understood Dudley’s rules. They were more for his benefit than Draco’s of course, given that Draco resembled Harry in every way. Largely they were to avoid any sexual aspects occurring in Dudley’s films. Draco didn’t quite get the point, after all, eating and being shamed about seemed hardly a lucrative market. But apparently, they were quite popular on certain parts of the internet.
“I’ve been busy,” Draco said. As he pulled the pram inside, her other two children gave brief hugs to Draco which he felt obliged to hug back. Before sitting beside their mother. “Can I get you some water?” Draco asked.
“What on earth are you on about?” Harry asked, carefully looking over the beautiful, well-nourished figure that Draco Malfoy cut. The other boy had sharp cheekbones and perfectly chiseled muscles, and looked like an Adonis… or did he?
Dudley shifted, “Yeah. I record videos of myself and sell them on the internet. Mostly of me eating and playing with my belly” he said quietly. “Harry preferred not to ask. But I figured with a new roommate I should give you the heads up.”
Clearly, Hermione had been busy popping out children with no abandon.
and I are co-writing this <3 <3 <3
“Where is Harry” Hermione said tensely.
Draco slid his bottle across and took Harry’s. “I think we ought to withdraw to the bathroom” Draco said with a mischievous smile.
And so, he set to work - destroying the better part of whole roasted goose, several generous helpings of potatoes, and generous latherings of gravy.
by Quentin_threepwood
“Alright” Harry agreed.
A series of nightclubs, strip clubs, sex shops, and a couple of gentleman’s clubs. It was heavenly, in its way.
“Do you what donate it to those less fortunate?” Draco suggested.
Lucius clucked his tongue but ignored the bait. The boy was far too simple, Lucius thought. Too passionate, too plebeian, too loyal to someone outside the family. It would have been distressing if it didn’t feel like the nipping of a year-old hound.
Of course, he was wrong. Very wrong. It turns out he could fit five pizzas inside him. If they were smalls.
“Мамо, татко иска коремът ти да се нахрани, нали?” Her eldest asked.
Jacinder grinned and pulled out a key. “My place. You and me…us..”
“Don’t know Italian, do you?”
“Yes I did Cousin” Draco nodded feeling his cheeks blush. Potter’s cousin was quite appealing. Although he then remembered he also looked like Harry.
Draco nodded, “I needed a change”
“Well, I suppose I’ll be off then,” Harry said, shrugging on Malfoy’s coat. “You know where to go?”
To be honest, Harry wouldn’t have noticed the frayed appearance of his former rival had Harry not *taken notice* of Draco in the past.
Harry blinked; it was strange not wearing glasses. He could get used to this, though.
“Harry! What is this?” Draco demanded, stepping into the crowded pub. Harry had let him believe this was just going to be a regular pub night with friends, but clearly Draco had caught on to the fact that there were patented Weasley balloons dancing above the table, with a large cake right underneath.
“Harry. I’m glad you could make it.”
His dad’s eyes widened at that, and Scorpius rushed on to explain.
Before he knew it, the Yaake had started, and all the men were chanting and clapping, lifting up on to the balls of their feet and then back down rhythmically. Daneri had explained that the movement with the feet was to emphasize height, and it wasn’t long before Harry realised that he was easily the shortest man in the line, though he was also considerably more muscular than most of the others.
“Nothing new, just dealing with the same old issue.”
Draco sighed, scrubbing at his face before considering Harry again.
Seamus guffawed at that, and Dean and Ginny nodded in agreement.
They decided to walk, and Harry was just enjoying the fresh evening air when Camilla slipped her hand into his. It was soft and small. For a moment, he had a bitter flashback of walking down Diagon Alley with Laura, back when they had still been "in love", but decided to push it out of his mind. Laura was in the past now. He was supposed to be moving on.
Draco's mind was reeling. Here, in his hands, was a sheet of paper, signed by Harry Potter, stating that he owed Draco 300 thousand Galleons. For a moment he had the crazy idea that he should write to Potter and tell him he'd made a mistake. There was no way he could accept so much money.
"Nonsense! You stay here!" she insisted. Harry considered her for a moment, before deciding to accept.
"The people who were supposed to use it cancelled at the last minute, so I figured we may as well. Probably a lot more comfortable than all four of us trying to balance on a hotel bed, and I didn't want to sit in the public restaurant and discuss this."
Harry spent another few days observing the beauty and culture of Nordland, and enjoying the hearty food, before he ran into Camilla again. If pressed, he might admit that he had been thinking about her for the past few days, and had purposely made his way back to the market, but when she asked, he insisted that he was here to buy bread, and what a lovely surprise it was to run into her again. He wasn't sure how he felt about the knowing glint in her eye, but pressed on anyways, asking her to join him for dinner at a beautiful lakeside restaurant he'd found during his adventures the day before. Thankfully she'd accepted, shooing him away from her stall when she started to notice other customers hovering unsurely behind Harry.
"We should be sleeping, must be awake early tomorrow," she explained. Harry nodded; they were usually up early anyway, so he wasn't sure what the sudden warning was for. Feeling like he was ready for bed though, he followed her up the stairs, her mother trailing behind them for some reason. Figuring the whole family was tired, he bid them goodnight and closed his door.
Scorpius was just considering how to respond to that, when their little reunion was interrupted.
“I’m not sure it is,” McGonagall offered. “Anyway, you’re not exactly doing much healing as an Unspeakable. Sounds to me like you’re doing a lot more spying and investigating.”
“I don’t know how to get it into his head that I’m happy to help him,” Harry sighed. “He keeps acting like it’s this huge burden on me whenever he asks for help.”
“Well then,” Harry said determinedly. “I guess we’ll just have to go get him.”
“Did I really sleep until one?” Harry croaked, his throat still dry. Bryan laughed.
He hadn’t had the chance to read it though, as a rather large call had come in as soon as he’d gotten back, something about a house catching fire in a mixed magical/muggle neighbourhood. The clueless wizards living there had started shooting aguamenti spells at the house, not realising that it was a grease fire, started by a muggle spilling her frying oil onto her stove. The water had only served to make the fire spread, making the job of extinguishing it even more complicated, and to cap it all off at least 20 muggles had to be obliviated after having watched their neighbours shoot water out of sticks at a burning house. All Aurors who had been even remotely available had been dispatched to contain the situation, along with a small army of Obliviators and the Head of Muggle Liaison to deal with the muggle firefighters. Scorpius had stayed behind, still minding the emergency floo but also coordinating the whole shebang. He’d been relieved when the overnight Aurors had come in at 5 to take over watching the emergency floo, and the remaining stragglers from the team who’d been sent to the fire returned to the office, allowing him to finally leave for the day. He locked the journal in his desk drawer and made his way home.
“Thank you” Hermione smiled. “Have you heard anything from Ron?”
“Erm, so sorry,
Hermione smiled gently and squeezed Draco’s hand in her fat palms. “He’s being a stubborn git. Harry, I heard you quit your job?”
Frank started Draco on Pizza assembly; he suggested the two glove method. The left glove was the one you used for assembling the Pizza’s while the right glove was if you felt like eating any of the toppings. Draco had intended to resist, but the grated cheese became too hard to resist after an hour or so. By eight o clock, the worst had happened. A pizza order had come in and no one had come to collect it. Draco called the customer desperately hoping he would be relieved of the burden of having to consume the pizzas. But after an hour of sitting on the oven warming, Frank made the declaration. “They aren’t coming Harry, your going to have to finish the pizzas.”
Draco swallowed, but then offered in a very low whisper: “My parents caught me with one of the servants of the *wrong persuasion,* if you understand me.”
Dudley still couldn’t fathom why Harry had wanted to move in. His working theory was Stockholm syndrome. Dudley was absolutely the first to admit, that Harry hasn’t had a pleasant childhood. A children’s home probably would have been an improvement.
“He’s safe Granger. Don’t have a fit” Draco said calmly.
and I are co-writing this <3 <3 <3
“Harry Phone” Dudley called out, he could hear the amusement in his tone.
“I don’t think she’d care” Draco admitted.
“Oh, but I do.” Draco’s eyes penetrated Harry’s with a cool fire that made Harry feel deeply unsettled. “If I am to take on your life, playing at you - I need to be mindful of these kinds of details. I do not want to arouse suspicion.”
“Cool” Dudley nodded as he gestured to an open doorway. “This is Harry’s room.”
“Ow!” Draco protested.
Escape was probably the simplest answer. The truth was Draco didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted away from his family, he wanted not exist without the expectations.
A few minutes later, Harry was also disrobed and in his short sleeves. He studied Draco in furtive glances and did his best to appear as bored as Malfoy did.
Narcissa saw the discomfort and waved it away. “But enough of this maudlin prattle. Enjoy your meal, my son,” she encouraged, and nodded as Harry (as Draco) selected a fork and began to tidily slice at the corner of a meat pie on his plate.
The resulting silence in the conversation was painful. Harry added, just as filler, since why would Draco give a shit…. “I didn’t try to date him or anything. I just wanted him to know. It felt… immoral not to tell him, when I couldn’t get him out of my mind. I was hoping we could have a laugh and carry on as usual. Or at least that it would blow over and we would be able to move forward as friends. But instead he went and ran out and married Lavender Brown. I suppose it scared him - like being gay is catching? Perhaps he actually thinks that. I hope not. But such a reaction… I thought I meant more to him.”
“Perhaps we meet in a weeks time? Get our affairs in order?” Draco suggested.
“I think you can Harry” Dudley. “I think you want more. I think you want to really really stuff yourself.”
“It’s more than it just being about the help, Draco,” Lucius responded, his voice neutral as a professor teaching the dullest subject on earth.
“I wouldn’t mind some tea. The boys can all have a fizzy drink. Viktor won’t mind if they’re spoiled”
Chapter by Quentin_threepwood
He paused and looked at Harry taking him in. Considering, if he wanted to step into his life. “It’s Polyjuice.”
by MollyWeisser11
“I’m at work. Be quick” Harry said sternly.
“To what exactly?” Hermione asked having some understanding of the principle but not the method.
Draco made a mental note to buy a stylish pair, rather the uninspired print pair he cringed to.
“Father, please! I thought last winter you said you wouldn’t force me into this!! I don’t want to…”
At this point in his life Harry was no longer uncomfortable with his sexual preferences for men, but he still felt some kind of way about Draco.
Apparently, the film looked great, particularly the part when Dudley had measured Draco’s or Harry’s belly in actuality with a tape measure. Dudley had spent a few hours edited and putting the strangest music on it. But apparently, he already had customers sending emails insisting they’ll send a VHS in. Which good for him, Draco supposed.
“Hey so if you do something to Harry’s body what happens? Like a tattoo or something?”
Draco grimaced, “that’s not why I’m here.”
“Draco, it takes a month to brew Polyjuice” Harry countered.
“I see,” Harry said, feeling a lump in his throat. Draco probably has no clue his mum knew about all this… and it felt wrong to be the one who was learning all these intimate details about Draco’s private passions.
“Ciao Harry,” Frank said.
Something about stepping into Harry’s body delighted him in a way he found hard to describe.
Draco walked inside, it was simple and pretty obvious that two boys were living there. Draco was aware that he was being watched. “I’m Dudley by the way.”
But essentially Dudley had explained that Draco would be pretending to be a footballer, that needed to bulk up. Draco assumed it made sense, Dudley had unsuccessfully explained what football was to him. Which fine he could do that, although he struggled to imagine if Harry would make it convincing. The narrow thin body, becoming less thin with each passing day. Draco had to admit he was enjoying the soft feeling of his belly that now defined Harry’s frame.
“That’s my good boy,” Narcissa murmured, smiling and pressing a kiss upon his head as he stifled a belch. “Now here is a potion to ease your digestion. Take it and rest, my dear.”
“This already feels ridiculous” Draco sighed.
“Hermione come in please” Draco reassured.
“My father sent me to have a rondwandelen” Draco sighed taking a sip of water.
Harry dressed in elegant robes that probably cost as much as a year’s worth of rent at his cousin’s flat. Or even as much as the Dursley’s whole mortgage. He couldn’t know for sure - but despite the impeccable tailoring, he felt like it was all a trifle too large.
Draco tried not to stare, partially the fear of being caught out by Hermione. Was more than enough to frankly push him close to wetting himself. Out of anyone she was bound to see through his impersonation.
“Striker,” Dudley said. “So you’ll need to beef up”
Yet again he was the center of conflict between his parents. And to be frank, he was rather sick of the both of them: the tough, impassive personality of his father, and the soft, pleading temperament of his mother.

Ch 10 by Quentin_threepwood
Honestly why was breaking up with someone so hard. Draco had in the end said he was going to stay with his mother and it would be difficult to see him.
“Yeah they’re Extra smalls, it works better if they’re tight” Dudley grinned. “Now stand near the door. Act like you think you're in trouble”
Draco shook his head, “not a word. I suppose I shouldn’t be that surprised, you know what Purebloods are like. Homophobia isn’t that different from their usual shtick.
“Thanks, Big D” Harry replied clutching his fork tightly.
“My name is Harry” Draco replied.
No, it wasn’t distressing at all - just a nuisance. It was for this reason that their Flemish forbears must have came up with the *rondwandelen*.
Hermione uncrossed her arms and placed her hands on her wide hips.
Harry, in Draco’s body, found the very idea repulsive, and perhaps this was threatened in his face.
“Cool,” Dudley nodded and switched it off. Harry had barely touched breakfast as usual. But didn’t bring it up. “See you tonight then.”
Draco nodded slowly, he had a thought but the doorbell rang. “What now” he mumbled and walked to the front door and opened it.
“Right. Thankyou, my bag is in the cloak room” Draco said sliding across a ticket. “Now I’ve sourced the potion. Once a week, about 30ml should suffice” Draco smiled. “No last minute grievances I should be warned of?” Draco queried.
Harry looked blankly, “am I supposed to know what that is”
He had tracked down and made the appropriate adjustments to Enough Polyjuice potion to last a year. Although Draco had struggled to break things off with Jacinder. He had attempted twice and both times he felt too guilty and ended up sleeping with him.
Draco walked in and up to the counter and a fat Italian man in his late twenties waddled up, an apron pulled tight around his belly. He wore a name tag with a Frank on it.
Ch 3 -
“And you want me to sit here?” Draco said gesturing to the dining chair Dudley had moved into the front room of their flat.
Her hair began to come slightly out of its coife, and a strand fell in front of her eyes. She pushed it away, and Harry felt keenly that she looked more human in that moment than he has ever seen a Malfoy ever look.
“I’m so full it hurts” Draco pouted.
Hermione frowned, “what? He agreed?”
“Coming” Draco replied. He walked out into the hallway and picked up the receiver the curly cord.
He left the bathroom and slipped the piece of paper from my upper pocket. There was address written on it and the closest train station.
Harry shrugged. “Judge me all you want. I have spent the past several months just trying to feel some semblance of human compassion. If you agree to do this switching up thing with me, you are completely welcome to improve my life in whatever ways you see fit.”
Draco’s eyebrows shot to the roof. “My, my, Potter. That will never do.”
“There we are, my sweet lad,” Narcissa murmured, and proffered his napkin. “Oh, my poor child. Your exposure to the outside world has traumatized you so much that you forget your manners.”
Still none of this reflection did anything to illuminate the current situation. What might Malfoy want from someone - particularly Harry - switching bodies with him?
“Pretending to be me, presumably being indulged by my mother?” Draco offered. “He consented to it.”
“More?” Draco blinked.
Draco slipped it on around His’s neck and tied the string around with a bow at the back. “It’s a bit loose.”
“I’ve had four children Draco.”
“Put some meat on your bones” Dudley nodded. He reached into the plastic bag and pulled out a packet of Battenberg cakes. Ripping it out and offering it to Draco’s lips who chewed it out of Dudley’s hand. “That’s right Curtis, Eat up,” Dudley said forcing another one into Draco’s mouth.
“Then when Harry reverts to his body he would have a tattoo” Draco explained. Draco winced, as he inwardly realized this was one of the few unintended side effects of the enhanced polyjuice potion that Snape had designed. He struggled to remember if he had told Harry about this fact - but he shrugged it off, he could tell him next time they made contact.
Draco smiled and offered his hand to Harry, “So we have an agreement?” He said with a proud smirk.
Draco paled. He was certain that five pizzas were absolutely not going to fit inside him.
“Conditionally,” Harry said, and swallowed firmly. “I need to get back to the lads, though. I would hate to interrupt their artistic process mid-way through.”
"This will never do," Lucius hissed, and as Narcissa tried to take his hand, he scowlingly leaned away. "The boy is far too soft for his own good. He needs to come to terms with his nobility. It does not do for him to gallivant about with fey young things like that."
Harry looked a bit closer and saw, with some surprise, that Draco looked a tiny bit haggard and worn. His eyes seemed a touch glassy and his cheekbones a little bit too sharp. There was something tired in his gaze. He didn’t have that so-smug superiority that Harry remembered from their school days. Instead Draco seemed as if he might have just recovered from a bout of some kind of illness - but was hiding it extremely well.
“What a pig you’re becoming. You really can’t help it can you” Dudley teased.
Draco left and began up the staircase until he found the apartment Harry had indicated.
Draco - or Draco in Harry’s body - was a little rubbish. For a start he could barely see his own feet without Potters glasses on.
“Of course not. You just happened to spend the whole week making moon eyes at him and standing up for him against his friends.”
Hassan shook his head. "It is not common. We prefer to drive, or walk." He gestured out the window, and Harry turned to look. There were quite a few people out and about, walking along the streets. Harry was intrigued by the landscape. Where he was used to green grass along all the road sides, here the ground was mostly dirt, with a scattering of trees here and there.
Harry nodded. Her reasoning made sense, and he was the first one to relate to wanting to get away because everyone was gossiping about you. If she knew it was going to be difficult in her small village, he was really glad she hadn't actually come back to London with him. She would never have been able to stand the publicity that surrounded him.
"I enjoyed it too," Draco said softly. They fell into silence for a bit, and Harry was just feeling himself dozing off when Draco spoke again.
“I’ll make you a deal,” he said, offering her his folder. “I have this case that I really don’t want, and you have that case that you really don’t want. How about we switch?”
Everyone raised their drinks and before long the conversation had shifted to the upcoming Quidditch drafts. Any attacks on the family of the Wizengamot were quickly forgotten by everyone other than Harry. He couldn’t help mulling over this new clue about Malfoy. If he was a supervisor, that might be why he didn't take new patients. As a supervisor, he’d also be in a better position to make shady deals with Unspeakables. But surely the receptionist would have at least been familiar with supervisors in the hospital and how to contact them?
“I think it’s just something we’ve been taught to believe in. That’s why they’ve been trying to invent potions and spells and bonds for centuries, but we’ve never figured out how to recreate true love. It’s a little depressing to think that even dragons can find true love, but I can’t.”
"I... I guess I never thought of it that way," he said slowly. "People are always fawning over me, acting as if I'm some kind of god when really I was just a kid who got lucky, and it gets pretty fucking annoying, so I usually try to avoid being recognised for that."
Draco frowned. “When did you see me going into the Department of Mysteries?”
“Why would he make a less potent Polyjuice potion?” Scorpius mused out loud. “This journal only focuses on the Polyjuice—there’s no other potion recorded here. Half of it is even blank.”
“Why don’t I hold that for you?” Harry offered, reaching for the folder. Draco merely shook his head and walked away, leaving Harry to follow after shooting a nasty glare at the cafeteria witch.
"If you sent a letter, I don't think she'd burn it," Draco said carefully. "I can include it in the envelope with the contract if you want."
Harry continued to glance around as he placed the lasagne he’d brought on the island. There seemed to be only two doors leading away from the main living room. They were both cracked open, and one was clearly a pristine bathroom. The other, probably the bedroom, seemed to have sunlight pouring out of it.
“Was it you who taught him to cook?” Draco asked casually. Harry tried not to grimace. Did Draco also think this casserole was tasteless? If so, admitting that it was him who taught Scorpius to cook would make him look awful. On the other hand, he couldn’t really think of anyone else who could plausibly have taught their son such life skills.
Harry remained in that corridor for a while after Malfoy disappeared through the inky black door, wondering what business a Healer could possibly have with the Department of Mysteries. He kept pondering the mystery as he made his way back up to his own office, fully aware that if he was late, Hermione would once again lecture him until his ears went numb. He didn’t mind her being his boss—if anyone was suited to being head of the Ministry of Magic’s Ethical Review Office, it was her—but he knew she sometimes worried that the other employees thought she was favouring him.
As alarming as that realisation was, the next one was even worse—the thing poking him in the ribs was a limb. A human limb. Taking a deep breath, he opened his eyes again, squinting against the bright light streaming in from the window. He turned his head ever so slowly, wondering who on earth he'd slept with. If waking up in a strange bed with a strange person had been a shock, it was nothing compared to the shock of realising that that person was Bryan.
They sat there for a while, watching the sun set, then rise again not long after, eating all the krumkakes, and sharing a thermos of coffee. They didn't talk much, Camilla asking a couple of questions about him here and there, but otherwise sitting quietly. Harry was really enjoying the sound of the waves on the lake, and the occasional calls from various wild animals. It was rare that he found peace and quiet like this back in London, and he intended to savour it.
“I’ll admit, when I was released, I didn’t foresee us having lunch together. Scorpius had said that you were angry with me, and I kind of resigned myself to believing that I had truly lost you.”
Hassan led him to a small white car, where Harry tossed his rucksack into the back seat and sat down in the front seat. He was surprised to find a steering wheel in front of him, and to hear Hassan laughing from outside the car.
McGonagall smiled, taking a sip of her liquorice fizz.
“Honestly, I’m quite fed up of wondering the exact same thing. Let’s not talk about this anymore—tell me about your work.”
“Evil megalomaniac out to kill me, governments and major media outlets trying to defame me, deadly tournaments. You know, the usual. Now stop stalling, and let’s get going.”
Harry nodded. “I’m not sure how much. All I know is that one of his batches of polyjuice was mixed with my hair, and they used that to get into the Minister’s office, and kill him. Sometimes I wonder if I could have forgiven the fact that he was brewing illicit potions. It can be lucrative, and I know living with a limited income was hard for him. I think what really got to me was the fact that he took my hair. There were so many people they could have impersonated to get an appointment with the Minister. So many ways to get into that office. But they chose me. I was friends with the Minister too. The last thing he saw before he died was me, pointing a wand at him and casting the killing curse.”
If you’re amenable to this idea then please owl me back quickly as there will be much to prepare before the Gala. If you’re not, well, then let's blame this silly idea on the bottle of Ogden’s I’ve been sampling and pretend I never made it.
Harry started eating in a bid to put off having to respond to that. If he was honest, he was still a little angry with Draco for not having trusted him all those years ago, and he was sure that Draco could feel it. But he wasn’t as angry as he’d been a few weeks ago. Spending time with Draco was making him face the fact that he couldn’t spend his life wallowing in his pain. Draco had more than suffered for the mistakes Harry was angry about. Wasn’t it time to move on?
Draco grinned as he turned to face Harry, who was offering him a champagne flute. They weren’t attending the St Mungo’s Charity Gala together, but it had come up during their last date that they would both be in attendance, and Draco had been thrilled at the thought that there would be someone he could talk to here. His work didn’t exactly allow him to make many friends in the healing community, and most of the politicians who attended these events were unbearably boring.
“Who’s winning so far?” he asked, plopping down next to Teddy and stealing the bowl of popcorn he was munching on.
The receptionist bit his lip, shuffling about through the log book as if it would give him answers. Harry was considering asking for a supervisor when the receptionist jumped up suddenly.
He returned to work the next day in high spirits. His dad had still seemed nervous the night before, but the atmosphere in the house was no longer tense. They’d enjoyed dinner together while Scorpius had eagerly complained to him about everything that had gone wrong with the fire, after which they’d settled down to watch crime dramas late into the night with a large box of chocolate biscuits his dad had bought earlier in the day.
Scorpius grabbed hold of his father's hand and with the other reached out for Harry's. He hung between them as they made their way down the hall to the children's activity area. Scorpius seemed to be getting really excited at the sounds of other children playing and laughing, but as soon as they rounded the corner, his face fell.
“No, of course I won’t.”
"No, but I was staying at their house so I don't know if they might have taken them anyway."
“Retired, actually. Poppy just celebrated her 75th birthday, and after a couple of glasses of mead she announced that she was
"I'm Hassan," he said confidently. "Come, let's go."
"Thankfully it was quite easy, Bryan didn't want anything from you and I assumed you don't want anything from him. We've filed the papers, and it's going to take about a week for them to go through. You'll have to stay in the country until then, but it doesn't necessarily have to be in Vegas. He said he was returning to the hostel he has been staying. The poor kid just seemed relieved that his mother wasn't going to find out about this whole affair."
"Honestly, I don't even think it's the fact of being married that appeals to me so much as the idea of having a family. I guess I just always thought marriage would be the first step towards that."
Harry was still thinking about it as he made his way home. Logically, it seemed like the perfect plan, but there was still that bothersome voice in the back of his mind reminding him that he’d never dated anyone before. Not properly, anyway—neither he nor Ginny really considered their brief two months at school a proper relationship.
He resumed his seat at the dining table once he'd collected parchment and ink, and the paper that seemed to have upset Harry so much. Draco flipped it open, curious to see what they'd written about Corner's arrest. He was surprised to find that the article on the front page didn't mention Corner once. He flipped through quickly and found a short article on the fourth page in the business section about how he'd been arrested for fraud. It sounded like an interesting scheme, but Draco couldn't help flipping back to the front to see the article about Harry.
There was a retort ready on his lips, but Malfoy’s smile made it clear that he was the one who was teasing here. Harry chuckled, letting it go as he turned the conversation back on Malfoy.
“Where have you been?” Carol demanded. “We were looking everywhere! We couldn’t find you or Bryan all night!”
“I… that’s not—” Harry spluttered.
“I must admit, it’s usually pretty boring. People think of healing as a glamorous job, but it’s mostly a lot of paperwork. There’s a form for everything. Every appointment needs a report, every potion needs a prescription, every transfer needs a whole stack of forms. There’s even paperwork for when you forget to do the paperwork! I understand that it’s for record keeping, in case something goes wrong, but whenever there’s a need to verify old paperwork, it suddenly becomes impossible to retrieve it from the archives. If it’s not a clearance issue, it’s a supervisory issue, or sometimes it’s even just a problem with the outdated charms in the filing room…”
I don’t think you need to be nervous. You’re a talented actor and a confident man. From what I could tell, Geoffrey was already quite impressed with you, and would never consider Tom in your place (or me for that matter, though I’m tickled that you thought—even just for a moment—that I could do it). The two of you will work really well together, and the play is going to be an extraordinary hit, I’m sure of it. I speak from experience when I say that selling yourself short helps no one.
Scorpius returned to the courtroom the next morning thinking that he had a good handle on his nerves. He’d stayed with Teddy the night before, which had allowed him to spend the whole evening ranting and crying and rehashing every moment of the trial. They’d talked long into the night, and Scorpius hadn’t been the only one to realise that if Draco was going to be released, he’d need a place to stay. Teddy had offered that Draco could stay with him, but Scorpius knew that wouldn’t be a permanent solution. Teddy had suggested telling Harry, but something was holding Scorpius back.
“I’ll have to head out soon,” Draco whispered to Harry, ignoring Longbottom’s description of one of his exotic new plants. “I have to be at the hospital tonight.”
Scorpius shook his head. “Not unless I can prove that the missing evidence would have changed the outcome of the case. I’ll worry about that later though. Right now, you need to get home.”
“We should get you to St. Mungo’s,” Adella pointed out. “I’ll go ahead with Mr. Malfoy, and you two can meet us there. First floor, East wing.”
“That’s fair, since I’m in no way jealous of you now that I have Harry,” Draco shot back easily. He took hold of Harry’s hand as he spoke, giving his knuckles a little kiss. Harry wasn’t sure whether to mourn the loss of the soft blazer under his fingers, or to rejoice in the intimate gesture.
“We do have ethical overview,” Draco explained. “The Department of Mysteries isn’t running completely unchecked. It just doesn’t go through your office.”
“I believe that’s a muggle television, Scorpius,” came Draco’s reply, his voice much softer than his son’s.
Bryan shook his head furiously, clearly embarrassed by the notion.
"It means the egg got stuck inside a stone for hundreds of years, until a few dragonologists found it and dug it out," came a voice from behind them. They turned to find a stern looking witch standing there.
Draco looked up to find pained emerald eyes glaring back at him. Harry could never know why, and Draco would never be forgiven. His heart broke as he heard Scorpius’ feet on the stairs. Harry closed the door, locking their son out.
He was done with marriage anyways. Part of the reason he'd decided to go travelling was to get away from the media storm back home. When Harry had finally reached his limit and demanded a divorce from Laura, she had run straight to the Prophet about it, trying to spin the story so that it made her look like a jilted lover, and like Harry had never really cared. It hadn't been long before he'd been forced to retaliate, giving the Prophet, the Quibbler, Witch Weekly and Quidditch Quarterly in-depth interviews about how they were no longer in love. He'd tried his best to avoid smearing her name, despite everything she'd done to him, but when Draco had started the divorce process for him, he'd written the reason as infidelity. No one was quite sure how the Prophet had gotten ahold of those papers, but when they did, things had really escalated. Everyone had spent about two weeks speculating who had been unfaithful, before Laura's secret boyfriend had decided that he wanted a piece of the attention too and proposed to her, right in the middle of Diagon Alley. When she'd rejected him, playing it off as some random stranger who just wanted a famous wife, he'd retaliated by giving Skeeter an exclusive interview about every single time they'd had sex behind Harry's back. It had enraged Harry even more to see exactly how long she'd been cheating, but not as much as it had hurt to see himself described as an oblivious loser who couldn't even satisfy his own wife. Draco had tried to console him, insisting that this made it easier to prove her fault and therefore prevent her taking all his money, but Harry didn't care about the money. It was the betrayal that had really hurt; he had genuinely thought he loved her, and that she loved him.
"You fight too?" she asked, reaching out to take his hand in hers when he nodded. This really hadn't been the type of conversation he had been imagining when he'd asked her out this morning.
“Agent Phi is the Auror Liaison for your Transfiguration case. It makes sense to me.”
I have some shocking news for you this morning about our beloved Saviour. More recently, you may recognise him as the biggest business tycoon in Europe. So many of us feel safe buying from and investing with him, thinking that we can trust the man who saved our world from the forces of darkness, against all odds. But can we?
Shocked by the abrupt question, Harry shook his head.
“Dad?”
“Can’t be that good at it if you’re telling me.” Harry took a bite of the crême brulée—it
“What nonsense, Penelope, of course he doesn’t want an emergency shift. If someone called in sick, you should fire them because it’s obviously an excuse to take an extra long weekend, and then fill the shift yourself. That
After a few days of nagging, the intern at Alternate Entrance Management had finally fixed the spell that connected Draco’s office at St Mungo’s to his lab in the Department of Mysteries. Draco could do it himself, of course, but as the Unspeakable Liaison to St Mungo’s (or Unspeakable spy, as the Unspeakable spies called themselves) he had more important things to do. Like figuring out who was Transfiguring people into animals.
Harry nodded, sitting down as Draco left again with a swish of his robes. He heard a door close somewhere else in the flat, making him wonder about the layout of the place. Were there many rooms? Did they look like this one? It occurred to him that this might be the perfect time to uncover some information about Draco. That had been his goal, after all, when he’d agreed to their first date. If Draco was in the loo for long enough, perhaps Harry could take a peek around—this flat looked posh enough to have a home office. Someone as neat as Draco would definitely keep files about secret dealings with the Unspeakables in a home office.
But then why had the potion been modified the way it had?
Scorpius couldn’t help glancing toward the kitchen as well, before nodding.
Scorpius nodded.
," Draco moaned.  His nails excoriated the healed line till the entire area was bright pink.  "Gods below, that's better than sex."
He spared a moment to feel flattered that Draco trusted him enough to bring him here, before it hit him that he was
“It feels like no matter how much time I give myself, there’s always someone else waiting to take advantage of my fame, or my money, or some other social benefit that I can offer them, without a care in the world for
“I’m looking forward to it” Draco reassured. “Err I’m hanging up now,” he said putting down the receiver hearing Frank laugh.
“Always skinny. Honestly Harry barely eats you know” Dudley muttered frustrated.
"It is settled," Lucius said, then clapped his hands quickly. The house-elf, Dorky, manifested in an instant and bowed low. "Dorky, please gather the necessary items for Master Draco's
She turned sideways and Draco watched as she puffed and squeezed through the doorway. She really was utterly enormous, he wondered what on earth Viktor Krum had going for him to let herself into this state. Draco stepped back as she lumbered slowly, her thick thighs barely bending as she waddled.
“What’s the internet?” Draco queried.
“Indeed,” Draco uttered, and sighed. “Why else would I be here?”
and I are co-writing this <3 <3 <3
Draco felt relief once they were gone, and amusement at how fat Hermione had become. I suppose she seemed happy, although he would admit he was surprised she wasn’t whipping the ministry into shape. But I suppose the War had left everyone with Scars. He grabbed a can of beer from the fridge and cracked open the tab on it gulping down mouthfuls as a loud irritated hoot fluttered at the door. Sighing Draco opened the door and he recognised as the family owl who deposited a letter on the doormat.
Draco hesitated but suspected if he didn’t fess up, he’d be hexed across the room.
Draco picked up the pizza boxes and sighed, there was no way he was going to finish this.
“Take pity on me, father,” Draco begged, “I swear,  I won’t see Jacinder again. You have my word. I promise you.”
Ch 9 -
“Make-believe? Did you not have to do Drama at your wizard school?” Dudley questioned.
Harry knew what it felt like to have a mother figure in the form of Ron’s mother, Molly. But Molly was too distracted to give any of her children more than cursory attention at any given moment. Narcissa’s focus on him was like a balm that penetrated deep to the depths of his soul - and as he passed her a plate so she could serve him from the veritable feast that magically appeared before them… he couldn’t help but realize that Narcissa had a flower name, like his mum, Lily.
“Urrrrpppp….yes…sir” Draco replied as another cake got shoved into his mouth. Swallowing greedily, as his belly bloated further.
Hermione ignored him, “I will slap you again.” Draco squinted at her. “Fine, I burned myself out. I graduated with strong results in my NEWTS and went straight into a ministry position. It just wasn’t challenging and frankly, it was impossible to get anything done” she huffed. “Ron and I called it quits and I realised I needed a break. Viktor invited me to Bulgaria, things started from there. He spoils me, and I suppose I don’t mind. He’s a good father, he’s supportive and puts up with me, and a big personality”
Draco sat down in the chair and spread his legs and leaned back like he didn’t care. Scratching his balls. “So?” Draco said attempting to look gormless.
Given Harry’s silence, Narcissa began to uncharacteristically fill the silence. “Draco, my boy - I have seen your art journals. Your fascination with… what are those Japanese wrestlers called?”
,” Narcissa breathed softly in French, and then she picked up one of the three forks at the side of Harry’s plate. “Eat, my son. Be hearty and carefree. Do not fret and linger over your bites like your father would prefer. He is not here - and you are free to grow as enormous and round as a cabbage if you like.”
At the end of the shift, he was grateful for Dudley’s apartment being so close by. He belched very few steps, his gut-churning uncomfortably. Draco collapsed onto the couch groaning, as Dudley was leant forward watching football on the television. “Urrrppp”
“I’ll show you” Dudley smiled, “Your fine with Pasta for dinner.”
Frowning he picked up the letter worried his mother might have cottoned on to his ruse. He was relieved when it made no such indication.
“You’re not subtle. I can tell you like the big boys” Dudley laughed. “But you also look like my cousin. So..keep looking” Dudley laughed.
While he was glad to be rid of Laura (despite the chunk of his bank account that she'd taken with her), he didn't see the need to tell Scorpius how horrible it had really been. The poor kid probably heard enough about terrible marriages and divorces, seeing as he spent most of his time in his father's office.
While Potty’s hands mess up his hair
"We got married?"
“Of course, Dad. I love you too.”
“You know I have to keep Papa in mind when I cook.”
“Papa,” he exclaimed, rushing forward to hug his father. His papa’s eyes widened as he approached, but then someone caught his arm and pulled him back. Scorpius whipped his head around to find Adella raising an eyebrow at him.
Scorpius bit his lip as he realised how hard that must have been. He’d be devastated if he had to live knowing that one of his friends died thinking he’d betrayed them.
“It seems you have a lot of thinking to do, Draco. To decide between the man you love and your career is not an easy task.”
"He says that he's
"Here." Harry was handed a cool steel bottle of water, and drank gratefully.
"Don't get married by accident," Draco added under his breath. Harry sighed, but smiled all the same. He was sure that this trip would be perfectly normal.
Harry sneered at him. “With you here? As if.”
"I've heard people say that celebrity is a curse... I guess this is what they mean by it?"
“What makes you think anything is wrong?”
“The photographs presented here are of the defendant’s husband at the time, and his son. On the reverse side of each image are pieces of code, identified in Auror records as a method of communication employed by Neo-Death Eaters. The attackers involved in the assasination of the Minister appear to have coerced the defendant by implying that they would injure or kill his son if he didn’t provide polyjuice potion mixed with his husband’s hair. Hence the code
In the end, the decision seemed rather clear to Harry. He shook his head as he stood up.
“He’s so overprotective because he’s scared of losing you again. He wants to be certain that you’re safe, and looked after.”
"Are you good at water charms?"
"Draco, why don't you eat first? It must have been a long trip, you don't have to throw yourself into work right away."
"Pippy!" he called, once he'd managed to clear his airway.
“But he… I can’t,” Agent Delta said, a note of pleading in their voice.
"Yes. He is not remembering that I am not a baby."
“How about you? Who sent you that love letter?”
Draco frowned at the envelope she offered him.
He led Scorpius over to the plush sofa and picked up the remote. The screen lit up to reveal a channel guide, and Harry quickly navigated to a kids station. Draco joined them on the sofa, and father and son both seemed captivated by the bright colours and the animated characters. Thankfully, the show was just starting, so they were able to understand the gist of the story. Since he hadn’t watched TV in quite a long time, Harry was unfortunately unable to answer most of Scorpius’ questions. When he found that no one really had the answers he wanted, Scorpius started focusing more on the show, and eventually the questions died down.
“I’ll let you know when I get back, and we can pick up our discussion there,” Draco offered. “I’ll see you later, Harry.”
"Papa, I really want to build a dragon," Scorpius said, staring longingly at the new wing piece that the other boy was flapping around happily.
Teddy squinted at him for a moment, before apparently deciding a break was just what he needed. He hauled himself out of his chair and grabbed his cloak from behind the door.
By the time Head Auror Clearwater came by to give him his lunch break, Scorpius had already made it through half the evidence forms. He was itching to get down to the Aurors’ archives and find the physical pieces of evidence, because Smith had done a horrible job of photographing it all. The photos were blurry, cut off, off centered, or sometimes they weren’t even there. He took a moment to rant about it as they were trading off the emergency watch, fully intending to go down to the archives during his break.
“You want me to stay for lunch?” Harry blurted. He’d thought that Scorpius only wanted him to check on Draco and heat up the food. He hadn’t realised he’d be having an entire meal with the man.
Harry gave a large huff of frustration, but he knew he wasn’t going to get anywhere with Hermione right now. They had pub night with Ron tonight—perhaps she’d be a bit more amenable with a few drinks in her.
With a sigh, Harry sat back against the sofa and turned his gaze back to the flames.
Malfoy shrugged. “I was wondering if it could be revenge. The first patient was the daughter of a Wizengamot member. But the second patient had nothing to do with either of them. His brother is an advocate for magical heritage who’s won some high profile cases to protect magical nature reserves, but that’s the only time anyone from their family has interacted with the Wizengamot.”
Draco winced at that. “I hate sun charms. I always have to place so many of them on Scorpius and I anytime there’s so much as a few rays of sun. Something about our genetics makes us burn really easily.”
. So yeah, maybe I’m a little over protective, but what else do you expect?”
"I promise he'll be completely safe with me," Harry insisted.
Ten minutes later, his express owl had been sent, tea had been poured, and Draco was curled up on the sofa in his office and watching the sun rise over the city. Having grown up in the countryside with no buildings other than the Manor visible for miles around, it had been a shock to suddenly work and live in downtown London. The sheer number of people could get overwhelming, which made Draco grateful for the isolation he usually worked in. But as time went on, he’d got used to the bustle of the city and it had eventually become exciting to him.
Before they knew it the show was over, and another one was starting. Rather than animated humans, this show’s main characters seemed to be a group of birds. Before he could get drawn into the story, Harry stood up, and Draco followed him.
Harry shook his head.
Not willing to look too closely at this reluctance, Harry turned his attention back to the Department of Mysteries and what they could be doing with Malfoy. He didn’t trust Unspeakables as far as he could throw them; they always acted so superior, as if nothing outside of their offices was worth their consideration. With all of Hermione’s reprimands, he’d started to relent a bit and not focus so much on what they might be hiding. But seeing Malfoy go into the department had put a niggling idea into his head that something was going wrong at St Mungo’s. He couldn’t shake the idea that they might be experimenting on patients. It was an awful thought. But how would he ever find out if they were?
"Mom look! I found a wing!" He cried gleefully. He ran to the edge of the pit to hand her the new piece, which joined a collection of other pieces he'd found. She helped him dust himself off before leading him to a large table where kids were assembling the fake bones into wonky looking dragons.
“Well, there doesn’t seem to be anything untoward happening down there,” he said, sending a spell at an empty report sheet so that it would record his observations. “Sometimes people feel irritated when their workout clothes are too tight, or when the quality of their lavatory tissue is not so great. If you use spells down there, for cleaning and whatnot, maybe give them a rest for a couple of days and see if that helps.”
“Potter, as tempting as it is to tell the media that you had a sore throat, every Healer in this hospital is bound by strict confidentiality clauses in their contracts.”
Over the last two weeks, when he hadn’t been spending time with Harry, Draco had been obsessing over the Transfiguration attacks. The only thing that linked all the cases together was the weirdly specific attack and the culprit’s magical signature. Draco was intimately familiar with that magical signature by now, having spent hours reversing their magic in an effort to heal his patients. So to feel it here at the St Mungo’s charity ball could only mean one thing—
“He’s been at it for so long the lifeguards have already rotated three times,” Harry chuckled, pulling himself out of the pool. He noticed Draco glancing at his bare chest, and couldn’t help feeling a little self conscious about his body.
“Yes, Mr. Taber, I hope you can. My name is Scorpius Greengrass, I’m here on official business from the Auror department. I’m here to inquire about a recent string of reports from your neighbours, who have been concerned on multiple occasions that you’re in distress.”
Scorpius had never seen his dad speechless until today. Harry opened and closed his mouth about three times, all the while looking like he was about to explode. Finally, he took a deep breath, and although he was still glaring at Scorpius, his voice was calm.
“So you know those pictures I found in the journal? Head Auror Clearwater recognised the words on the back.”
“I asked Teddy to go over the potion for me once I realised it had been modified. It turned out that the changes made the potion wear off faster. At first I thought it had been designed to allow for a tight window of use, but after reading the case files, I realised that Silverthorn, the guy who actually cast the killing curse, hadn’t expected the potion to wear off so soon. Thankfully he didn’t suspect that it had been Papa’s doing, otherwise who knows what his partners would have tried to do to you and me.”
Pippy shook her head.
“Sorry, what?”
Cheers,
“Why are you so insistent on cooking for us?” Harry was surprised by Scorpius’ defensive tone. “You know I have to be careful about what Papa eats! Even the soup you brought us had a lot of salt and garlic, those aren’t good for him!”
Stay strong, my friend.
Harry stepped out of the floo into a bright, open plan living room. The fireplace was framed by a taupe coloured sofa and a matching armchair, and behind the sofa was an island counter and a very modern kitchen.
“Does that mean you want to have another date?” Harry asked, his heart pounding in anticipation. Malfoy seemed to relax again, and gave Harry a soft smile.
"Is this really important right now?" Harry asked weakly. "Draco said he'd be here in an hour or so, maybe we can get dressed and try to find some food before he comes."
“Could you tell us what that yellow soup is? My friend was wondering.”
Draco shrugged. “I guess I’m used to it. My office is fairly isolated so I don’t often have to face what people think of me.”
“I… I can’t. My life’s ambition is to be a Healer. The only way I can do that is as the Unspeakable Liaison at St Mungo’s.”
“Malfoy was the one to heal the girl?”
“Well, I mentioned that I was seeing someone who I wanted to introduce tonight,” Harry said sheepishly. In hindsight, he really should have told everyone that it was Draco he was seeing.
Malfoy seemed frustrated today. He was walking purposefully, his lime green robes billowing out behind him. One thing Harry
“Is he some kind of supervisor at the hospital?” Harry wondered aloud.
“I hope so.”
"With what? Has Laura contacted you again?"
, even if it wasn’t much. I don’t know why he went back to it. Over the years I’ve thought of so many different possibilities, but none of them make any sense. Some time after you turned seven, he started acting distant. He’d be out late every night, and he barely spoke to me whenever he was home. At first I thought he was having an affair. Merlin, now I wish it had been that simple.”
Personally, Harry thought stealing in a hospital was an awful thing to do, but then again, he wasn’t very fond of stealing no matter where he was.
"Harry, this is the fourth time! Merlin, let me guess, you're in Vegas, aren't you?"
Rook agreed with Elderberry. "It's quite possible that this is some kind of odd manifestation of PTSD, but we wouldn't be able to tell for sure until he decides to come in for a thorough examination. Personally, I feel that this kind of things should be at least a mandatory discussion with his general healer, but since he's technically not harming anyone, there's not much we can do about it. If you're reading this though, Potter, I urge you to send me an owl."
Draco shook his head quickly. He took a deep breath before answering Harry’s question.
“You can’t tell anyone, though. Especially not Dad.”
“Really Potter, it’s courting 101. Dinner first, then, if both parties are amenable, sex.”
"Camilla, you won't be happy with me." He could tell he sounded rather cliche, but it was true. He could tell he wasn't going to love her, not the way he should love his wife. If she came with him to London, she would have no one else. But he knew he wouldn't be able to trust her, not completely. Not after what Laura had done to his heart. It wasn't fair, for either of them.
They continued to have fun together throughout the afternoon, moving on from "sailing" to swimming races, and eventually back to the slide, before the three of them flopped down onto the reclined beach chairs along the deck to relax and dry off in the sun. Scorpius kept chattering happily, telling Harry about Priscillia's new kneazle that he got to play with last weekend, and about the cool uniform Draco had bought for him for the charms academy he would be attending next month. The excitement was starting to wear off though, and both men could see that he was getting tired. It wasn't long before he was fast asleep under the warm sun.
And then there was the issue of her parents in the waiting room. The hospital had already been put on a discreet lockdown to keep the press out, with Aurors at every entrance and more patrolling each floor. Having so many watchful eyes around made Draco want to go lock himself in his office, but this was one of the rare instances where he had an actual job to do.
Harry stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk, causing a handful of people around him to grumble about “inconsiderate pedestrians”. Not paying them any mind, Harry searched his memory for Scorpius’ address. Surely his son had told him at some point where he was living? Had Harry already forgotten? Was he already getting that old?
“Oh Godric, they are. It gets bloody annoying sometimes. Thankfully they didn’t say anything about tonight.”
Everyone else chuckled, and Harry felt himself blushing. It was true that he often got himself into frankly unbelievable situations, though it had been happening less often as he got older.
Comforted with that thought, Scorpius finally let his eyes droop closed.
“I have my ways,” he said mysteriously. He glanced around the room, spotting Granger and Weasley standing by one of the ballroom’s massive windows. There were a few other people he recognised around the room but none were nearly as compelling to talk to as Harry.
“The flower is made of fish!” Scorpius explained. “And that one is made of kitty cats!”
“I’d like to invite you to apply for the position.” Well, McGonagall was nothing if not straightforward. Though if Draco was being fair, they both knew that there was no way he’d turn the offer down.
Scorpius grinned, shaking in his seat. Draco had explained to Harry during one of their many meetings that Scorpius started shaking almost uncontrollably whenever he was extremely excited.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take a portkey so that I don’t get sick.”
“Harry,” he said softly. His voice sounded better than it had last time.
"Thank you for taking care of him today," Draco said, smiling fondly at his son. "I know he can be a handful, and I really appreciate it."
Harry was gesturing angrily as he said all this, and slapped his hand down on the table for emphasis. Unfortunately, the puff of air from his hand coming down shifted the folder, which slipped over the edge of the table and went tumbling down to the floor. He scrambled out of his seat to help gather them all together.
"I ask Pappa," she said thoughtfully.
Within 30 minutes, Harrison managed to convince nearly everyone in the room that Draco had in fact thwarted the terrorist group he’d been threatened by. The interview with Silverthorn turned out to be just a snippet from a longer interview, in which he’d rambled a bit about how the Polyjuice Potion hadn’t lasted as long as he’d hoped. Scorpius had been surprised to find out that it had started wearing off before the Minister had been killed. He thought back to his dad’s statement that the Minister had died thinking Harry Potter had betrayed them. This seemed to prove otherwise. Scorpius hadn’t read or heard much about the Minister who died, but he wondered if this Minister had been perceptive enough to notice the changes in Silverthorn’s appearance, and to realise that their murderer was not, in fact, an old friend.
Scorpius was delighted to see his dad’s lips twitch, as if he was fighting back a smile. His expression quickly turned morose again.
He still loved rural life, however. Especially around forests. Which was why, when the owl returned with an invitation to lunch in Hogsmeade, he didn’t hesitate.
He hesitated outside the door as he realised what he was about to do, however. He’d been shocked to come home to his papa sitting on the couch, frantically wringing his hands as tears streamed down his face. He’d explained shakily that his dad had walked in looking for Scorpius, and gotten angry at the sight of his papa. After his dad had left, his papa had called Teddy, unsure of how to reach Scorpius at the shop, and Teddy had gone to talk to his dad.
Harry snorted, feeling beleaguered and hollow. He had been waiting to tell someone the story for ages, and sadly Draco was the first one to actually ask, however casually, how Harry was doing. And so Harry told his formal nemesis, despite his best judgment. “More like miserable and in love with my best mate, who I haven’t seen in six months since I told him I was queer.”
“That was then,” Lucius grit out, his sneer itching to deepen far beyond a noble degree. “This is now. And sleeping with the help has rendered you a *disgrace,* boy.”
Draco smiled, he hadn’t expected it to be that easy.
Harry’s mouth formed into a soft oval of surprise. “So you are one of us,” Harry observed, and he instantly felt more knobby and lanky and unattractive.
