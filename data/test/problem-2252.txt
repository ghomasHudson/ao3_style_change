"Call me Harry." He shook hands with each of them. He'd meant to play it hard, as if any resentment encountered from them, would only slide off indifferent shoulders. But acceptance felt good. Too good not to give in. As each one pumped his hand, he was reminded that this wasn't school anymore. Most of them were professional players, not immature kids who would hold his difficulties against him. They were famous in their own rights, in the quidditch industry, and maybe that's why they forgave him so easily.
The place looked truly real and stunning. She’d done such a good job, it made him reconsider having a look at Grimauld Place before getting her to change it back to the way it was. After dropping off Kreacher, he hadn’t hung around to check it out.
As if practicing obedience, Ash watched the bones hover over the boy's body. As his eyes adjusted, other things came into view. The outline of a eye socket sparkled faintly where the old one had been destroyed. It was a grid, a blueprint. It glistened like blue quarts in all the areas where the body had suffered injury. Clusters of fine, pin-dots, burned bright blue and swarmed around the boy's head. They grew out of his crushed arm and shaped themselves into a forearm, wrist, hand and fingers. Ash also saw them through the rib puncture. They lit up the entire inside of the abdominal wall like blue fireflies swarming inside the cavity. The brighter they glowed, the darker Foster's hovering bones became, until it was clear that the sparks were drawing their power from the bones.
Elan stood waiting. Excitement glistened in his eyes, and said only, “I’ve made some changes.” He stepped aside.
She lost track of her own thought as she saw Harry struggle with his cuffs. Before he hit the woman, he didn’t seem to be aware of the two officers approaching him and he kept shoving Draco off. The movements he’d made, made no sense to her. It was like he was drawing an invisible window that required a fair bit of precision. It had confused them all. The officers, seeing no obvious danger, stepped forward, trying to talk to him. She’d held her breath, wondering what she would do the moment Harry’s magic revealed itself in front of them. Seeing Harry switch his wand to his left hand and draw back to let go with a punch from his right, sent shards of ice up her spine. She did not have a second to wait.
Gamy raised her hand as if to shush her. “I have never seen this precise occurrence before. But I’ve seen magic take a stand. And let me tell you, when it locks the doors, it is trying to accomplish something. It wants everyone where they are. Ours is benevolent, I’ve trusted that all my life. If you try to fight it, you’re going to end up on the wrong side of things. We’ve just had a marriage. An uneasy one. The family dynamics have changed. My guess is, there will be an attempt to smooth all the rough edges between these two, magically. What they can’t resolve, the influence will try to resolve for them.”
Their fight was over within minutes. Most of the creatures ran when they saw it. Those that tried to fight it, were disintegrated by green flames. Emerald made her way through and jumped on the dragon’s back with them. They took off over the landscape of Draco’s dreams and nightmares, leaving his committee behind.
“I thought you said the husband’s family removed all the important stuff. You made copies of their documents?”
He gave them time to notice him, but kept clear of their splashing contest. When their looks clearly expected him to join in, he made it a point to not crack a smile and held to the firm indication that they were having fun all wrong. Pretending he wanted nothing to do with the spectacle before him, he turned his back on them and headed back through the doors. Harry saw through the act, and sent a splash arching over the side of the pool at him. It was borne on magic, and reached him at a volume that smacked him forward, drenching his whole body from behind.
Harry's public appearances had been aided by oversized jackets and the fact his male skeletal structure did not push his stomach out like a woman's. Male pelvises tilted back, allowing their abdomens to remain inconspicuous. His stomach remained mostly flat, which wasn't good for him or the child, who did not have enough room to grow without putting too much pressure and strain on Harry's heart and lungs. Professor Snape's last examination predicted she'd be premature and he instructed them where to go when the time came. He'd blasted Draco with a burst of severe and specific instructions on what to do immediately after she was born, as if he'd known it would fall to Draco to keep them safe. He'd certainly known that he wouldn't be there to help.
A glimmer caught his attention. It might’ve been an onyx, an oval, inlaid with a tiny human profile of alabaster. He couldn’t be sure of the materials, but that’s what it looked like. The edge of the onyx was encircled in the most convincing rhinestones he’d ever seen. Jewelry was not his thing, but the stole and broach combination looked so authentic and expensive that he had to ask.
As if all humanity in him had transformed, Harry threw his father’s touch off. He kept his eyes on Draco and tried to charge forward.
This time, Draco’s mouth opened to him, and a genuine willingness to give Harry what he wanted, came out. Aside from gratefulness and hope, it was a real marital kiss. Their first, as a real couple.
“I thought my daughter was being magically attacked, so I retaliated. I was trying to strike back at the attacker.”
Draco shook his head. “No, this is not good. That’s not my father. That’s his conviction. The person who believes I should stick with the contract. The person who promised my life away.”
She released him to Blaise, who rocked Harry in his super long arms. “That was some epic love, my man. You’re beautiful. If you made me any prouder, I’d be gay. Rainbows and unicorns for everybody.”
That beautiful Malfoy complexion became an equally enchanting oxygen-deprived shade of blue. And though blood vessels stood on the whites of his eyes, Lucius never lost consciousness.
Just then, a flash of brilliant green light imitated streaks of electrical discharge. Spindly fingers sizzled across the sky, vaulting in front of the windows and turning the room green for an instant. Thunder sounded like boulders breaking against the roof. Nothing about that sequence of event was natural, and it silenced everyone in the room.
Readers, I realize that some of you might be too overwhelmed with emotions and knee-jerk reactions, but IF YOU COMMENT:
Gamy’s eyes softened. “As long as we cooperate with the magic, we’re not. It’s not trying to harm anyone. It’s like an animal with its own instincts and nature. It might show you frightening teeth at times, but it’s no more evil than a tiger. Stay out of the tiger’s way, and you won’t get hurt.”
Even if the Ministry cleaned it up discreetly, the incident would be considered a tarnish on Wizarding reputation and her personal ethics. Getting her license to practice would come into question. She might be barred from ever practicing law when this got out. Legalities were one concern, but as survivors of the war and the trials that followed, all of them had upended their reputations and risked investigations that would put them on trial all over again. What they did was illegal as hell. They’d attacked innocent muggles in order to keep Harry from being arrested.
“No!” Harry held tightly, as if his desire could stop eternal forces. “Please, no. It took me forever to find you.” He squeezed his eyes shut and concentrated on the feel of the other in his arms. He heard laughter and felt Draco’s embrace tighten.
He was able to sneak by chattering guests, as they spilled out into various rooms to speculate on what was going on with one another. He smiled, offering the brave face he thought they expected, but kept it aloof enough to discourage talking to him. When he made it up to the landing, the sound of his parents talking in stilted whispers that anyone could hear, pulled him along. They were joined by Lucius’s nasal inflection and he could tell by the speed of their clipped words, they were in full argument.
Harry didn’t know how to respond, but he’d accidentally listened and now he couldn’t be rude about it.
“I wouldn’t be standing here if I thought I was any kind of a target like that. Are there any questions about the lecture itself?”
A series of covert whispers between Greg and a hooded night-creature-person, whose jersey was too exaggerated to reveal his face, got them through a side entrance and down an unlit flight of stairs. The only light, was the wand of a fourth person Harry hadn’t known they were following until it occurred to him that a stranger was guiding them further underground. Jasper took his hand. “Hold onto me.” And Harry followed, brushing figures who blended with the dark. Apparently, there were pockets of crowds lining the tunnel structures that got them to the lowest parts of the building. The floor felt like bare concrete beneath his shoes and when it began to thud with unnerving vibration, he knew that he’d passed some ward that had made the detection of music impossible.
“I said take it.” A deeper voice came from her. Meaner eyes narrowed up at him, like she was scolding her children.
Nobody asked questions. Sirius and Remus knew that it would be too easy to trigger another argument between James and Lily. They kept their heads down and followed orders.
“Is the ward on the family name original, or is it of Gringott’s making? A service they’ve provided?”
It was a signal that they both agreed on before coming into this world. I’ll wear our connection. That’s how you’ll know me if we get lost in this whole human farce. That’s how we’ll find each other again.
“Nothing. It’s only a few minutes. She’s obviously found a loophole. And you’re acting like you can hardly stand the sight of me. What’s it matter if I disappear for a few minutes?”
He lost sight of it at one point, but regained it when the wheel came back down on his left side. It was like a spell circle, symbols glowing, outline on fire, turning in a heavy rotation that might’ve been synchronized with eternity instead of gravity. It moved with iron heaviness, but it wasn’t physical at all. He got the sense that it could speed up if it needed to. It felt imposing, immense and critical. Looking at it unnerved him. It had the effect of seeing raw red guts, which are never supposed to be seen outside the body. He knew that he was looking at something he wasn’t supposed to be seeing. If that weren’t enough, the thing pivoted like a skyscraper threatening to fall. Only it didn’t. Another structure appeared behind it, until both appeared connected in a timeless symbioses that kept them in the same grid and rotation. The magic coming off of them did indeed feel like a generator’s build up, release, and build up again. The energy was cyclical and released every time a cycle was completed.
Draco and Iece had appeared yesterday, surprising him when he stepped out of the shower. He recognized their voices the minute he turned off the spray. Draco used the excuse that he was dropping off the information Harry requested. "She might as well get to see you while I'm here."
Apparently, the rave scene was part of a network of illegal rings that relocated at need. Drug busts were common. Crowds were tied to seedier aspects of hidden nightlife, and the Irish Republic came down hard on club enthusiasts who partied outside the boundaries of their permits. Gang activity, human trafficking, and drug epidemics, fostered government raids that kept gorilla entrepreneurs outsmarting authorities.
Harry blinked. "I didn't think that was possible." If it were, why weren't thieves stealing magic all the time?
“We all have injuries that will bleed for the rest of our lives. Look at what we did to you, to keep you alive. And you think Harry is exempt from this madness? You think we started this? Every decision we made, our only goal was to keep our family together. And we did it. We beat all the odds. Was there trauma? Hell yes! I’d like to see anyone else survive all that without it. You’re the one who brought that boy back from death, and kept him from peace. The most responsible, compassionate thing anyone could’ve done for him, was to let him move on from his torture. No one wanted him to suffer that.”
The events were unpredictable. He couldn't help it if his magic knew how to find Harry, when even his mind did not. Harry himself, owed his ability to defeat the Dark Lord, to very concentrated magic. To very purified blood, strained of sluggish imperfections. Lucius couldn't see it before. But the events have given him a window into Harry's gifts. He's seen the young man's energy, spiraling out from white-hot cores within the vertical axis of his body. He's actually stood over Harry Potter's bed and seen it.
“You didn’t see the man who’s saved me time and time again, strung upside down and stripped in front of the whole school. No one fucking helped him. People kill themselves over that shit. Why did my Dad and his friends do that? If he’s here, let him answer.”
The Potters seldom hosted events that made large-scale partying the norm, but the sound system was a luxury that couldn’t be topped on the days when Gamy listened to her opera by the pool, or Lily tended to her shrubs. It rendered all the world into a theater, tailored to whatever private tastes programmed it. As they stared at one another, every room in their house, and every inch of their property, was drenched in dramatic, burgeoning melodies that corresponded to the keys on a piano.
Harry tried to put his eyes back into his head and keep his mouth shut as Draco's face reddened. Whatever was going to play out, he wasn't missing it.
“Don’t touch them,” she said, looking up at the ceiling. A dark spot appeared where the light had been. “Wait.”
“No. You and I will never have a chance of being happy as along as Mr. Third is around. I’ve heard of three-party arrangements, but I want to be secure with my primary spouse before I wrap my head around another one. You and I need years to become accustomed to one another. We need to build trust. I’m sorry, but I can’t let you keep him.”
Jerard shook his head. “This is her home. If she wants you here, then this is where she needs you. She’ll use the kitchen to help you.”
“What the hell are you doing?” Draco objected. “If you do it, she’s going to think it’s perfectly fine.”
She stood her ground, blanching only a little at the use of her real name, which she had not written on her badge. “Answer the question, Mr. Potter. You’re a war veteran, your every lecture demonstrates your honor. Who is the real father of that child?”
When Dan’s strong thigh muscles locked Tom from the front, Tom pulled out his hands and went behind the back, attacking those cheeks in a way he had not had the gumption as a teen. He slid over the mounds of Dan’s ass, pushing the underwear band down and spread him like he meant it. Dan’s gasp told him how unexpected it was, told him how much he liked it, and told him that the night air, touching him in exactly that hidden spot, was a total shock. When they both registered the thrill of such a shock, they realized this was why they did it.
“Why the bloody hell not?” Ron’s eyes were wild at the thought of the tasks given to him. He didn’t see Draco spin on his heel.
James’s eyes met Harry’s questioning squint. He trivialized the request with half-interested laughter. While Narcissa and Lily concealed their reactions to Lucius’s audacity, no one except Harry saw Draco freeze over into utter stillness.
Wanda was neither impressed nor intimidated. “Yes, you said the little girl quarantined. I saw the chart. She’s gone. We assumed you moved her.”
“I’m not interested in his feelings. Why is he out like this? Do you have an actual medical reason or not?”
Severus’s sigh was reticent. “I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from those who judged me, that a decision comes to everyone, that will not be looked upon as appropriate. No one gets out of it. I do not use their trials to make myself feel superior.”
Gamy’s cane tap, told them to step aside for her. She reached the edge of the circle that formed around the boys, and put her hand to her broach.
Draco nodded absently and mumbled "Sorry," before pulling his cloak around Iece and flooing back to Harry. By then, they'd learned the protection spells that shielded the baby between locations.
When he couldn’t fathom the answers to those questions, he removed the thing poking him in his ribs. He’d forgotten about Harry’s wand. He held it, rolled it between his fingers, and wished to god that he knew how to use it.
, will become chapter 8, as well as remain a one-shot. Readers are missing vital information without it and coming to the wrong conclusions after, Morning After. I didn't realize how much it needed to be a part of the narrative. I'm waiting until the next chapter is ready because readers will think there is a new chapter when I insert it. Thank you.
In this timeless place, it took time to realize that this was his prison. Shifting light and shadow were his only entertainment as his watery atmosphere continually transferred fog-like illusions and shapes from one side of the globe to another. Was he at the bottom of Foster’s waterfall pool? He didn’t know. The silence was so expansive, so dominating over anything seen, he couldn’t imagine anywhere on Earth being connected to this place.
"That's new," Draco supplied his unspoken question. He watched with half-lidded interest as Harry suffered a third jolt.
Beneath the hem of his black tweed coat, Snape gripped his wand and pointed it discreetly. All four saw their wands leave their hands, flying up alarmingly high. Perhaps it was the shock that caused the wands to appear suspended for an abnormally long time. Seconds. The look of disaster had all of their eyes bulging. Muggles were capturing this, the four seemed to say, as they glanced at one another. Their wands came down, scattering on the grass. After clumsily scrambling to reclaim each to its owner, they realized that Harry and Lucius had rolled into the street and Lucius was picking himself up off the bonnet of a car.
No one answered him. Banks was not allowed to follow and Harry looked back, watching the Minister stare. He wore a look of helplessness, as if all his power could not prevent Harry from having to endure this indignity.
Ash stopped himself from touching it, from feeling the back of the cranium to make sure. Instead, he took hold of the sheet and tore it back from the rest of the boy's body.
Draco’s eyes rolled away from him, and appeared to be resigning himself to his surroundings and his circumstances. He was trying not to look at Harry and the bathroom mess at the same time.
No. Harry didn't want to dig into his vaults unless he had no other choice. That was partly the reason he'd procrastinated coming with Draco to apply for a house elf.
Narcissa stretched her hand across the table. “We’re not going to have to tell anyone else, are we? It’s so personal.”
He shook his head. “Thank you, but no. I’m sorry, I have to get my daughter and go. I can’t thank you enough for your help. Are you okay? Did you get out of there all right?”
Harry placed his palms flat on the table and nodded. He understood more than Draco thought. It was all being funneled through a limited connection, but he was trying.
Just when he thought he’d surpassed their expectations, they introduced two more balls. Instead of complaining of unfairness, he understood they needed to know how he performed under pressure. He held his own for as long as he could. As his success rate dropped, his frustration rose. The balls came at him at an unrealistic pace that would never happen in a real game. Even when missing them should’ve brought the trial to its logical conclusion, players were allowed to continue baiting him.
“I keep these in my home,” she told him. “If you pay attention, any self-respecting witch has them on her kitchen window sill, or her mantle. They’ve always been in the family, reporting on whats going on with whom. Plants are the first to know.”
Minutes later, the group recreated the circle that allowed Severus to come through. But instead of Lily wearing the ring, Severus held it to his chest and lifted his head as if smelling a long-stemmed rose. His inhalation triggered the ring to glow. It dimmed upon exhalation, and they were all asked to continue directing their intent to send their magic into the ring.
Lucius blinked himself awake and grimaced. Why wasn’t there a picture of water by his bedside? He specifically requested one. He could snap his fingers and make one appear, but it was the principle of the matter. Those damn elves knew that Harry Potter was here, shamelessly exploiting Draco’s obsession with him. They knew it always tore Lucius’ stomach up and left him waking in the middle of the night, dehydrated and disturbed by what he might hear coming through the walls.
It reminded him that all this feeling, all this gluttonous delight, was about to end. He let his hands go crazy, plunging more deeply into the shadowy recesses of Dan’s hairy ass than he ever had before. A bit squeemish, he’d never had the courage to traverse that dark terrain, but right now he wanted as much of it as he could get.
“Very troubled magic, from ancient bloodlines, want to make a new beginning, and they have, through you. You agreed to come and do this, just as your daughter agreed to come. Just as your parents agreed to come. So many people love you, that at any given time, the spirit world surrounds you and observes you. You have fans in the spirit world. It would be distracting except that you are very focused, in spite of what you think. You can take it. It has never knocked you off course or stopped you.”
For a moment, they seemed to forget the way Harry’s trance state continued to hold him and the fact that his stag towered over the table, aiming a veritable tree of magic over his and Draco’s heads. The creature was still robust and lit, dripping pearls and sprouts of energy over their tea cups, still very much activated. Draco ignored his mother’s touch, saw Harry’s magic reflected in his tea, and lifted his eyes to the threads of silvery power weaving through those monstrous set of antlers. If Harry couldn’t describe what he’d seen in the vision, then neither could Draco. They weren’t exactly the same visions but Draco had no more of an explanation for what happened to him, than Harry did.
The curse was just a battle lost, out of many more that were won. If he’d gotten his arm cut off, he wouldn’t have had any problem holding his head high afterwords. But because he attached so much self-worth to being perceived as a proper man that no one could deny…
Lucius bit back his complaint with that, but puffiness in his expression spoke his true feelings. “As long as your son exhibits the qualities that your documents promise, you may joke your way through these proceedings. Now that they’ve had their twenty minutes of private conversation, shall we find out if they still wish to court their way to a proper engagement?”
He braced himself for the explosion of outrage building behind Foster's eyes. In the two years of their association with one another, they had never broached the subject. Ash wasn't even sure Foster comprehended human desires on that level. All he'd been telling himself for the past four days was, if he did this, if he helped Foster get to the boy, Foster would once again have a reason to sit at his table. It wouldn't be paralysis forcing him to stay under Ash's roof, eating Ash's food, and warming to the friendship he offered. It would be trust. As for the 'something more,' Ash was willing to wait and see if the wizard could allow that possibility.
During the trials, Narcissa got to keep all her assets under the Black name, but lost them under the Malfoy name (They were blood inheritances that she’ll never lose). She didn't go to prison, she was sent to a Siberian Detainment Center in the middle of no where. It was considered rehabilitation. There was nothing but snow and she couldn't leave the property, but she could go for walks, read, and participate in underground greenhouse farming, which sold and distributed food to the nearest towns. It was punishment without reducing her to criminal status, and awarded because she risked her own life by lying to the Dark Lord, saving Harry's life in the end.
Harry stiffened at Mr. Malfoy’s hands on his back. Long fingers sliding up his jacket, stunned his defenses. He tried to turn, to shrug his boss off, but the other man pressed him into the door.
He backed away. Behind him, Draco wept into his hands. Harry rushed to him. “Draco, it’s just a dream. They’re saying things that you tell yourself deep inside every day, to punish yourself. They’re your inner dialogue. You’re not cut off from your magic. Your dragon thrives. Tell them. This is your life and you want out of that damn contract now.”
Laughter erupted in the kitchen. Even Draco, arms folded defensively as he kept an eye on what they were subjecting the baby to, took extra delight in laughing at the reveal.
“Did you come here looking for the sure thing, or to play chicken with boys? Cause if you don’t know, you’re going to be pretty sore if you don’t get a happy ending.”
Maybe it was time Harry resumed his search. Screw the tour. It was just making him sloppy with distraction and keeping him vulnerable to attack. Snape had answers and he wanted them. His daughter’s health might depend on it now. But he didn’t know anymore about Snape’s whereabouts than he did before. He had nothing to go on. Except…
“Did you two get any rest?” James directed his question at Harry, while studying Draco’s reaction. After it was out, he cringed at what it might’ve implied. Lily jumped at the chance to disregard it.
As Harry looked back over the images of his and Draco’s time at school, he fell silent. He knew what pressure was. It was bad enough when everyone loved you, but what about when everyone hated you? They had all misread Draco. They had all believed the act. Fifteen years later, now that this man was his husband, he regretted not knowing what the boy in the photographs had gone through.
Severus was careful to keep all judgment from his face. Harry found him in their library, but the huge black book he held, was his own. This reminded him that Severus could’ve already left. He was the only one with the power to do so. He stayed behind for a reason. He’d promised to talk to Harry in private, before everything went south. Harry was pretty sure that big book had something to do with brushing up on research. Something to do with him and Draco.
The lights went completely down this time. The floor took on the appearance of a world they could fall through. It remained solid, but Draco had to test it beneath him to be sure. He could hear people around him doing the same.
She made an agreeable noise. "Thought so. You have fresh clothing packed in your back seat. Foster won't mind taking your dinner with me then."
When he regained enough control to pull out of it, he turned his head and pushed a fist’s length between them. “We can’t do this. This is fake, this is nothing.”
“You…” It was more of a gasp, as Draco closed his eyes and sank into luxurious warmth. “Oh, that feels so good. I didn’t even realize how cold I was. Thank you.”
“Are you hungry? Thirsty? If you just want to leave, I can let… I can show you out. You’re free to go home if you want. Our bathroom can only provide so much entertainment.”
The real Lucius Malfoy, backed up, appalled to see how his son viewed him. He’d had no idea that he was that larger-than-life and omnipotent to Draco. He knew that he was handsome, by shallow standards, but he had no idea that he was that beautiful in anyone else’s eyes. That was magic, for it wasn’t the components of the looks. It was the way Draco’s feelings interpreted them.
The girl put her hands over her mouth and peered over them with eyes the size of saucers. “Did they kiss?” She went flamingo pink and squeezed her eyes shut when Lily returned her stare directly.
She couldn’t let that child be scarred by Harry’s loss of control. She couldn’t let Harry, in his erratic state, fall into the hands of nonmagics who thought him dangerous. She was shaking as she withdrew her wand. No one was looking at her. All eyes were on Harry. He’d assaulted an officer. A woman. Accident or not, he would not be given fair treatment. He might not even make it to the muggle station alive. He could hardly communicate to defend his actions, let alone explain his behavior. She could see in his eyes that he didn’t even know what he was doing. When she saw the officer hit him, she made up her mind.
Harry took it on the chin. “Or maybe she’s working very hard to cheer you up. It feels like a deliberate distraction.”
He started his interruption of the wizard by saying, “Thank you for staying. I know this isn’t over.”
“If I was you, I’d be thinking about what the boss actually wants to hear, and forget about all this death stuff.”
He couldn't help it if there were scrolls, written in cellular form, in the building blocks of his blood, and the blood of his offspring. Magic traveled by blood. That was real, no matter what trend or campaign for equal treatment denied that reality. It wasn't about sneering at the lesser children of the world. It was about keeping the strengths one had, and making sure successors had something of value to navigate their way through life with. When his money could not take care of him in Azkaban, his ancestors had. Through his blood. Through his magic. And that was where the value of undiversified blood came from.
The thing about having a really powerful wizard in your stone mansion, making love to your son, is that you might as well be living in a muggle matchbox with tissue paper walls.
Foster waited. He allowed Ash to hear the after silence of the question, and what he was really asking.
Credit:  “Plants are the first to know,” is a reference from Seth, a person channeled by Jane Roberts. He put forth the notion that plants are very psychic and always know who’s pregnant. Sorry, I can’t remember which of the Seth books it actually came from. Either, The Nature of Personal Reality or The Seth Material. Anyway, he was pretty magic, and that line comes from him. :-)
“And yet he has already taken them on. You’re objection confuses me. Do you honor this marriage or don’t you? It’s no mere accident that puts your son in this house, in this wizard’s bed, so you must’ve taken great pains to get him here. Beating out all other suitors to join your legacy with his. Harry gets his kindness from his mother, but the House of Potter is more discerning. It does nothing out of kindness. That magic chooses members for their strengths. If it allowed them to marry, then it is a sound marriage.”
Worrisome guilt knitted Draco’s brow, but he held firm. “You’re never to do that without asking us first.”
When it was over, Harry was given a tranquilizer and led away. Humiliation had pushed Draco somewhere very deep inside himself and he’d gone quiet. He kept his eyes on the ceiling lights and felt himself detach from them.
While magic could always be traced, muggle accommodations provided refuge from fame, suspicion, and a world saturated by the aftermath of war. The muggle world was an extension of the wizard wars. It was certainly affected by them. But the way muggles blamed their problems on everyday politics, lack, or just plain bad luck, made Harry look upon them affectionately, as complete innocents. Woe to those who would wake up and learn the truth. Their governments would never admit to knowing the existence of a parallel world full of witches and wizards who knew how to manipulate energy, and so could not be forced into paycheck slavery just to keep warm in the winter, or to travel from one place to another. Such a government would have to admit that dragons, elves, and unicorns were real. And god only knew what else. Aliens? Why not, bring on the motherfucking aliens.
He tried to talk to it. “Your dad. He’s hurt. Can you help him? This is your dad. He loves you and he didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Just as he was about to lean away and go back to the chair, Draco mumbled. He waited, pretty sure it was nonsense.
Severus allowed the reunion to continue for a few more minutes, before announcing that everyone should return to their places.
“And yet I am well acquainted with your family’s particular vein of magic. You made sure of that. That I knew how how old it was. Nearly as old as my own. The blood wants what it wants.”
Note: I didn't even scratch the surface of what I really wanted to say. This will crop up again. It's more about watching an ultra sensitive man cope with unbearable emotions and pleasure. The animal aspect is just another color used to paint a desired effect.
He lay on his stomach. Grass stains perfumed his sinuses with rich earth and chlorophyll dampness. He wrinkled his face in disgust. The taste of salt and metal filled his mouth. He spat an excess of it onto the ground. Bloody strings of saliva appalled him. That’s when he noticed his servant, Millie, watching him closely.
Death was too good for this wizard, yet he couldn’t get sidetracked by the temptation of pouring Harry’s trauma into Collin’s neural synapses and forcing him to feel everything Harry felt that night. No, he was saving that for Lucius. Besides, the sociopath would only be awed by the experience, no matter how painful it was. Harry only suffered to the extent that he did, because he still believed in good and decency. He was still innocent, no matter what Voldemort had put him through. He still saw light in life and in the people around him. No matter what they did to him, they couldn’t take that away. This pathetic wizard knew nothing about innocence, so he couldn’t hurt the way Harry hurt. Those memories would be wasted on him.
He looked around in those memories and experiences like a man searching an old house, going from room to room, doing his best to ignore all the things he couldn’t change. Harry’s screams shook every scene, every room, even areas that appeared to have nothing to do with that night. This surgically removed particle of memory, chemistry, and magic, was an epicenter, affecting all levels of Harry’s holographic mind. Snape saw that even as a child in his crib, Harry as a baby, flinched from the young man’s screams, which were far away in some probable future. In the endless nebulae of the soul, it was all happening outside of time, still unfolding.
“You won’t kill an unarmed wizard. You won’t kill anyone. You’ve yet to prove yourself in that manner.”
The longer they sat, with him being unable to push those words into coherent language, the more he shoved chips into his mouth. They tasted like paper maché, and some part of him knew that nothing he ate was going to taste right. He continued because it seemed important to Draco. And while his mind kept clouding over with a sense of wrongness and urgency, he knew that it was very important to let Draco be in charge until he felt normal again. Until he could talk again. Just being unable to do so, should’ve been terrifying. Whatever Rankar had done, bypassed all of that, giving him the ability to stand apart from his horror. But it took his critical thinking with it, and for the next ten minutes, all that mattered was being good for Draco. That was the key to seeing his baby again. That’s what he was left with.
Harry’s eyes grew large. He saw his Gamy stop. She turned slowly. He stepped away from Narcissa so as not to be caught in any crossfire. His grandmother was so confident, she only kept her wand with her when she needed to leave the house. He knew there were pins in her hair that could get any magic she needed done, accomplished just fine.
Draco’s panting and moans stopped, interrupted long enough to make sure he survived what was filling him. He didn’t protest, but he did tremble and grip Harry through the challenge of it. He had to be reminded to breathe. Once they were past the hard part, Harry plunged in earnest, and Draco had to be held to the sheets.
Jipsy smiled, flashing her tiny teeth. “The Weasley’s came calling. Mrs. Weasley has sent you dinner. Jipsy delivers it in her finest attire.”
“Which is why your company intrigues me so. I saw what I saw. I’d hoped I’d taken care of you well enough to gain your trust in telling me the truth about it.”
“Now, now, that’s not how I meant it. We all heard what you did for Harry. You may not believe it, but I actually had money on you. I told James, no matter what we say about the guy, he’ll not be taken without a fight. I must admit, I looked at you differently after you took on the whole Ministry. Those salaried aurors weren’t prepared. That was the funniest thing ever replayed in the back of the pubs, and you owe it to us for those quick reflexes. We might’ve been asses, but James and I kept you on your toes.”
"She's perfect," he assured Draco a little indignantly. It wasn't her fault her genetics screamed so boldly where everyone else's were subtle. He could either choose to see Lucius spitting in his face through her, or he could see how brilliant she was, in spite of being just as much a victim of the war as any of them were.
Hermione stepped inside the room, her eyes shifting from Sirius to Remus, and back to Lily. “I’m sorry, what’s going on?”
One evening, at dusk, Tom couldn’t take it anymore. He slid open the glass door between his room and Dan’s balcony.
“I saw something. Quite unusual. I’m a doctor, it’s only natural that I have questions. Well, anyone would have questions.”
Harry suppressed the cynicism rising in his gut. The absurdity of expressing anything he felt, died in an impossible wasteland in his mind. He wanted to laugh at the childish assumption that he could simply talk it all out. He felt better about things, but he wasn’t sure he could trust that entirely, now that Mr. Weasley brought the real world back into the cell. How can you explain hate to someone who only understood love? How can you explain revenge, to someone who was so quick to forgive? If he opened his mouth right then, they’d just be speaking different languages. There was no way he could make him understand the level of dysfunction he’d let himself sink to. And he really didn’t want someone as kind as him, to know what that was all about anyway. Just let whatever’s going to happen, happen, he wanted to tell him. Don’t contaminate yourself trying to save me. I’ll be fine.
“I’m laughing at his little henpecked arrangement. He’s got a rent boy that looks exactly like Lily. You dotes! Who gives two flips about his dress?”
“Ron, I’m trying. Levitate her to the ambulance. Get it down the street. Wake the drivers up and let them get her to a hospital. Obliviate them first. And no, we don’t have the wand power, but the Ministry does. If we can quarantine this area, word can’t get out. We can try to use a mass obliviation at least. That will take care of everyone standing in the open looking at us. The Department of Magical Breeches and Damage Control have more powerful spells. All we can do is try, we have to get the baby to a wizard hospital and she can’t go by magical means.”
Hermione blushed, turning to Ron's family. "Sorry everyone, I think we mentioned that Draco is very protective."
All the baggage that came with growing up behind a camera, with a whole other cast of kids, was doing a pretty good job of staying in the past where it belonged. Surviving that kind of fame was like being an honor student, and filled with all the moments that weren’t so honorable, that can never be changed, that deeply affected other people. There was no running away from anything, you just had to keep going. Fans always saw you in those roles. You had to find a reason to stay happy, stay thriving, and stay forward-facing, not backward, and what the hell was he wearing now?
He added, “I’m asking as a friend, not your employer. Discretion is really the key right now. Foster is a wildcard. You never know if he’s going to overreact or ignore a situation completely.”
"Oh, my god. Why don't you two just get married? If Harry signed a Parental Measure establishing you as a primary parent, the law would have to recognize three parental interests, not two."
He didn't mean to lie. He didn't mean to give the impression that he'd been with a man before. It was just that, if he ever had the courage to do it, why let anything ruin his chance to have it be with Harry? If there had to be a first time, who better, than the wizard he'd been obsessed with his whole life? Now was not the time to get all nervous and honest and blow it.
Even though Harry’s touch was gentle enough, the pressure of his grip tightened each time pleasure outran his thinking and took over his muscles. Draco didn’t complain, and rode the momentum. His long fingers curled in the sheets and he bit his lip as Harry ground into him.
Grail didn’t need to be asked for the info. “Something’s wrong with the little girl. She’s freaking out, screaming. He went hysterical. When his friends tried to calm him, he attacked in open daylight. Muggles saw everything. I cast a wall of deflection spells, but they rushed out of their houses. Now there’s police and the Ministry.”
The mouth made him confess that Harry was actually attractive. He hadn't always thought so. James Potter's son always seemed to have a homeliness about him that Lucius had always associated with his father. Maybe it was the glasses. Maybe it was their association with muggles, he wasn't sure. Knowing that Harry had been raised and primarily influenced by that family Dumbledore simply, recklessly handed him to, cinched it. There was no hope for that child after that. Not in terms of pureblood etiquette. It was only when he'd had Harry beneath him, driving into him, that the boy's magic was forced to the surface, allowing Lucius to see what he really looked like for the first time.
The facility was one of a few, hidden within the metropolis of London. On the drive there, Ron sat up front with Hermione, while Ginny and Luna squeezed into the back with an unconscious Harry. Draco’s long limbs curled in on Iece, who cried herself to sleep in his lap. During the thirty minute drive, the car fell silent as uneasiness crackled in the air.
Snape’s mouth went tight. “For a lobotomized wizard, you can still connect impeccable reasoning. One who thinks, doesn’t require a wand in order to be a threat. You’re just as dangerous as you ever were, magic or no. You could be using your magic to stall your death right now.”
“When I couldn’t cry anymore, I performed a ritual. The kind done when a child dies. I sent him off with love. I cremated his body with white lotus flames, like the Chinese sorcerers. I tried to find peace with what I’d done. I couldn’t. I started waking up to crying, to the sound of a newborn. It was hungry and it screamed, and I knew it was him. There was no getting away from it. I missed my classes, I couldn’t focus. I tried self-medicating. I tried potions. I tried magic. Nothing quieted him. Nothing soothed him. Inside of two weeks, I couldn’t take it anymore. I heard him as plain as anyone speaking to me. I decided to kill myself. There’s a famous bridge near the campus. The Kuonen. Famous, because of the annual suicides. It was a sure bet. Only, I took off walking. But by the time I got to the bridge, I’d cleared my mind of all but the screaming. I understood that I didn’t have to go through this alone. I couldn’t leave this world without trying to make up for what I did. It doesn’t make sense now, but it did back then. I went to Kevin’s class. I called him out. I leapt on him in front of his students. I drove my wand through his guts. I never regretted it.
At the time, that was as close to poetry as any quidditch playing, snitch-head, like Potter was going to come to professing what he felt. It was a romantic gesture during a time when there was no time for romance. They were just beginning to realize they only had each other, and a newborn baby, to face the future with. They were beginning to warm to the idea. The broom was going to be used for midnight rides as they left the past behind them. But the past was slow to leave and the gift was relegated to a shelf beside other Malfoy treasures.
He held the photograph until his arm grew tired and lowered. He listened to his vow lingering in the silence. The other portraits were watching him without daring to interrupt his thoughts. His threat didn’t make them hospitable, but they knew who he was and wasn’t concerned about the school’s safety. Just about the threat given to one master from another. They kept their curiosity to themselves, and whispered out of Harry’s earshot.
“And, I’d have to check my notes. Four other wizards were in on it. We came up with the structure together. It was designed for Draco, the counter might not work with Harry. We improvised. There is no counter for him.”
– You know what it takes to turn a blank page into a journey, so comments to the writer are careful to begin with what you
Before it became important to kill Harry, Voldemort offered to hand him over to the Organization in exchange for global resources that would allow him to impress upon the non-magic world how much they needed to cooperate with him. Money is of no value to people behind the curtain of world puppetry. But magic gets their attention. They are not wizards, but neither are they the same as humans. They hide behind official administrations the world over, and are not limited to this planet. Individually, the only strength they have, is the ability to absorb human sentience as a bio-energetic sustenance. People generate emoliates. Emotional life force. The Organization is headed by entities who live for eons off of the calamities of human hysteria. Earth is a farm to them. Masses are sacrificed for their nutrition. Magical people are little more than a delicacy. And the very powerful, are kept alive to be used as expenditures when needed.
Harry was pretty sure that a lot of people, particularly mothers, knew what it did, but he wasn’t stupid enough to interrupt. He sensed that Draco couldn’t find the right words for what he felt. The question he really wanted to ask Draco, had to be suppressed. Feelings first, his mother always said. They can’t be shoved under the carpet like they don’t matter, no matter how silly they might seem. They hide the problem. Get those out of the way, then logic can set in, but not before. ‘It’s a balance, Harry. It takes both reason and emotion to solve human problems. We’re not robots. Talk to me, and tell me what you’re feeling.’
She must’ve read his questions in his face. “You applied for an American visa. You’ve bought land there. The Daily Prophet leaks news of your hotel negotiations every chance it gets. They pay others to spy on your business affairs, you know that by now. Everyone knows it, so don’t look at me like that. Tell me, in your plans to be the most visible and successful Malfoy on the planet, do you see yourself raising a second child? When you dream of a life away from Harry’s problems, do you see anyone with you, besides Iece?”
More than a little distressed, he called for his dad’s attention, jerking his head to point out the unwanted party train closing in. James disentangled himself from his wife and tore away to hear his son out.
While his suit was not as expensive as Draco’s fine Italian ensemble, its cut flattered Harry’s build and charmed the eyes. His family had no where near the money the Malfoys had, and so kept their clothes practical. His father had come into a couple of significant inheritances alongside his jewelry business and did quite well for his family. James Potter didn’t just make jewelry, he customized spells and charms that activated upon being worn. The jewelry could be as whimsical as diet mood rings that abated cravings, medical crystals that worked in conjunction with prescription potions, to wedding rings that ensured fidelity. Financially, the Potters were well off, but it was always the lore of the Potter name that seemed to open doors for them and extended their credit. If money was the bane of muggle existence, then magic was the double-edged sword that gave wizards their wholeness, while at the same time inspiring fears of great loss. Once you have it, you fear to lose it.
“Hush, don’t you dare think this is something you can fix for him. You and he are joined in life now, and your magic knows what to do. It hasn’t let you down yet. This isn’t something he’s doing by himself. You’re both involved. You’re both problem-solving with your magic. Let it do the work, and don’t let the dragon upset you. Don’t wake him. I know you want answers, and I don’t really have any. But if he’s out, it’s because the magic wants him out. There’s no telling what he’s doing from his side of things. Don’t let his sleep fool you. He’s working very hard to make things right. If he wasn’t, your magic would not be feeding his dragon to keep that hole in the sky open. You’re doing this together. The energy between you two, is just trying to restore balance, like any storm. Now get him to a guest room and get him settled. Take Mr. Malfoy with you, and let their little elf do all the work. If anyone can get a doctor in here, it’s that little creature.”
The rejection ripped Collin’s mask off. He bared his teeth, lifted one arm to block Snape, and flung a deflection spell from his defective wand. It misfired, displacing both of them a few feet apart. This gave him enough time to dart out of reach, but before he could apparate, Snape shot a confinement barrier around him, trapping him from magical movement. It would wear off in minutes, but that was plenty of time to corner him.
“The circle is not complete. There’s someone missing.” He paused. “If you come forward, you will be able to help Draco in ways that no one else here could.”
“I’m merely on speaking terms with those who have come before me. It’s where we all get our magic. Even you.”
Narcissa’s long legs split the opening of her coat, to step over James and insert herself closest to her son.
"It changed my body. At school, Harry and I engaged intimately, without knowing the dangers. I nearly bled to death. So I suppose, even though my body is completely normal now, a part of him is still reacting to that huge mess. The war kept everybody running. We never got time to adjust to anything. Changes hit us so fast, and kept coming. Not only is he trying not to hurt me again, there's some people he would like to hurt. But those people are gone and they're not going to pay for what they did. So how do we stop him from feeling all that?"
He used her hesitation to force his way through the door. He opened it onto the doctor leaning over Draco, using both hands to hold something flat in his mouth, while the rest of his body attempted to restrain him with his weight alone.
Before he could assess anything more, Eileen told him, “This picture exists because my mother arranged it. She went behind my father’s back to set it up. She even bought the dress. It isn’t to my taste exactly, but she begged me. That was the last time I gave in.”
Harry nodded. Hope ignited in Draco’s expression. “Because this is important. I should’ve spoken up a while ago.”
In her living room, he felt his reluctance to put his sister down. Hermione's space was exactly what one would expect. Tons of family photos. Cheap paintings of sunrises and animals. The tiny sitting room and dining area were all the same room, partitioned by shelves and books. Books and plants filled every vertical flat surface, fully integrating home and professional life, as if one could not be separated from the other. Pale, laminate floors, gave the place a sleek, modern quality and crisp assurance of cleanliness. But thick, frayed throw rugs, hinted of a Weasley's homemade influence, that Hermione must've been quite at home with.
I cleaned her up. I cleaned you up. I still don’t know how I did all that. If it wasn’t for Snape, I never would’ve made it. You were so angry, I kept her in the other room. When I went to discard all the dirty sheets and vanish the things I thought safe to vanish, it began to dawn on me that my magic had no affect on the things stained from her birth. Your blood came clean. But her amniotic fluids, I guess traces from where I cut her umbilical chord and her afterbirth, and that thing that covered her, couldn’t be vanished.  I threw everything in the tub and tried an incendio. It didn’t work. I couldn’t just toss it in the garbage. We were being hunted, and that just felt like too much information to let loose into the wrong hands. Snape had a working lab in his basement, and a muggle freezer he’d charmed to stay cold. I found bags, sealed it all up, and crammed everything I could into the freezer, just until I could figure out a way to get rid of it.
With a snap, that cellophane resistance released him. He fell back next to Jipsy. He checked over his body to make sure all of him was unharmed. He now had a clearer idea about their limitations of communication. Eileen had offered up her thoughts, but there was too much distortion between her present state and his. Even though some part of her was obviously alive and willing to talk, it couldn’t all be translated through a photograph. He rubbed his head as it began to throb. He had a stronger impression that she held exactly the information that he wanted, and he’d need Thella’s help to get it.
That kind of instinct couldn't be taught. It was a parent's. Fingers-to-mouth was more effective than any spell either of them could've come up with and the Draco from two years ago would simply have been too embarrassed to do it, if it even occurred to him.
That must’ve been the name of their elf. Harry all but rolled his eyes. They couldn’t know Gamy the way he did. If she said no one can leave, that meant wizards could not apparate out, not even with an elf. But he knew he had to let them find out for themselves.
There was the business to maintain, keeping locals in holistic supplies that convinced them he was simply a well-meaning herbalist hidden among them. He let Ash and Reuse run his store, while he concocted solutions the agriculturalists were realizing they couldn’t live without. He kept stores of basic home remedies for the most common ailments that no community could avoid, from colds to venereal cures. His pestles and cauldrons served both muggles and wizards alike, unbeknownst to them, and inventing medicinal improvements was how he achieved any peace from life at all. The rest of the time, he was following Harry’s movements, or trying to, and tracking down the progress of his grandchild.
He was right. Tonks had been a metamorphmagus. A brilliant one. But they both knew it wasn’t the same. He was thinking on this, when Jipsy popped in again. This time, she carried Iece’s little yellow sachet, the one with toys and bubbles inside. The one that Draco had let her carry on the plane. They watched her float it from the foot of the bed, onto Iece’s lap.
“Draco, the Weasley’s are a different sort than you’re used to. Especially her. She uses any handmade thing she can to express how she feels. It’s her nature. Food, especially. That’s what normal family’s do.”
Draco held the phone between both hands and looked at it. He took a deep breath. He knew the train was a bad omen, not just an accident. It was the war all over again. Could Harry not go one freaking week without getting himself injured or killed, or inflicting major drama upon them all? He couldn't take it anymore.
In short, Mrs. Weasley thought she knew what she was talking about. They all thought they knew the big secret, that Harry was the real father of Draco's baby, under the Death Eater curse, the Unbearable. The inbred, incest tragedy miring Draco's reputation, was just one of the many rumors manufactured from a trial filled with nasty revelations. They still didn't know that Harry had suffered the same curse and had been unlucky enough to conceive. The conclusion that Harry was biologically related to Iece in any way, went unverified and unconfirmed.
The sound of disbelief and irony escaped Draco, though when Harry looked at him, he denied any emotion.
Of course he couldn’t deny Harry the right to hide his treasure from harm. He hadn’t realized the pent up emotions that now wracked Harry’s body and shook the bed. He thought that anyone who could shatter a mirror in the faces of his parents, the way Harry did, wasn’t holding back anything. But when Harry couldn’t get himself under control, he knew better. He suddenly felt very selfish for wanting to rush Harry through his pain. The instinct was to make himself feel better. He changed his mind, sidled closer to Harry, and held him through the worst of his shudders.
So he’d already had a child. In the most unfortunate way than any of them could’ve imagined. They were given time to process that. What now?
She felt the change as soon as it happened. Eyes closed, all the molecules in the air rushed past her, forced out of the way. A blast of heated air hit her back, blowing her hair forward. She locked her legs to keep in place. Something punched a hole into the space behind her, and entered. She was so aligned with her wishes, that she felt him step through. Using her sense of him, instead of her eyes, she saw the soft leather of his Italian boots, ankle-high and fashionably level with the hem of his cloak. She saw the swell of his six-two frame swirl into existence, bringing the scent of life, air, water, wild flowers and earth, from a continent away. And magic. He brought power into the room that zipped up her arms and raced down her sides, leaving traces of its touch. She heard the others gasp, opened her eyes and turned.
Now that the tables were turned, and Draco had all the authority, he wondered if he’d always been kind to Draco. He knew he hadn’t in the early years. But he’d tried to make up for it. Especially when he saw how well he took care of Nicee. He owed him, and now that he was dependent on him to get through this, he just hoped that he’d been nice enough, good enough to him, that all this messed up shit, and all the past shit, wasn’t going to run him off. He’d said and done some really harsh things over the years. Things he didn’t mean. Things he wanted to take back. All of it seemed really important right now that he needed Draco to help him, and not lose patience and get up and walk out.
“No, I’m asking you to trust me to keep her safe while you go off on another daring adventure that may or may not land you in prison or kill you. I’m tired of having to discuss it. We’ve tried doing it part-way, your way, it doesn’t work. You’re split between us and whatever compels you to go chasing after a dead man. It isn’t helping her. This time, stay away until you’ve finished whatever it is you’re trying to do. Search the ends of the world for Snape, for all I care. Just get it out of your system so that when you come back home to us, you’re really there for her. Not concerned with anything else.”
“I’ve done my best to prepare him, of course, of your arrival. Mostly, during the day, he is agreeable, and keeps to himself unless the students pester him for details of the war. They want to talk about you and try to pick his brain. He pulls their most humiliating moments from their minds and taunts them until they run away. Shameful, I know, but we can’t understand what traumatic difficulties a portrait carries with them into that nether world, or how long their scars last. They really should respect his wishes to be silent on the matter. He’s given enough.”
Quay wiped at the froth on her mouth. “Every team’s got an asshole, Harry. And Greg’s ours. Let him mope a while, he’ll come around.”
She knew that some of James’s more staunched cousins weren’t leaving until they saw the boys firsthand, themselves. They were only here to get as much information as possible on the merger. The news was causing such a stir that her sister had come all the way from Surrey to be with her. That was quite a morning commute for a housewife with no magic, whose husband abhorred wizards. But Petunia had stood up to him, claiming that, “If my sister didn’t tell me about this, that means it wasn’t planned with any certainty and something’s gone wrong. It wasn’t supposed to be this way, this is no better than eloping. She needs me. I’m going.”
He didn't know how to tell his therapist. He didn't know how to explain it. It was just something he did every once in a while. He never thought it would get out of hand. He never thought he'd be hospitalized or have to sit through months of therapy just because one asshole couldn't take no for an answer. And had brought friends.
Draco shook. Minute tremors moved his hair. He pushed it back from his steaming face and asked Harry again. “I need it.”
Draco heard all of Harry's excuses pour out in the weight of his sigh. Harry dumped them, without giving voice to one. When his shoulders slumped, the only thing Harry said was, "You win. Hire whatever help you need. I trust you. Just don't leave. Not yet. Will you promise to be here when I get back?"
Though he prided himself on being a wizard, there were times such as this that he couldn't deny he was a man. Presented with such bounty, after going without for so long, what man wouldn't slip his fingers into that delicate, skin covered gateway? He made his choice. Because he had not done it in so long, he didn't dare attempt to mount Harry's body. He didn't have to. His fingers sank so hungrily into Harry's hidden parts, causing such a disturbance to sleeping waters, that his whole body awoke to its full potential. The pads of his fingers triggered Harry's reflexes, causing Harry's legs to slam closed and his lower back to arch off the mattress. Muscles that, a moment ago, were slack and unguarded, jerked into contractions that adopted the pulse of Lucius' fingers. Adopted it and met it as Harry's body trembled against the slick charge of Lucius' hand. In sleep, his body voiced its surprise as his head pushed deeper into his pillow and his arms reached to push away a phantom it could not see.
Severus thought about it. Harry could almost hear his mind ticking off a checklist of reasons denoting Lucius as an idiot. “You choose pride. So be it.”
Mouth open, Harry didn’t realize he was panting as he watched. He could practically feel the heat rolling off of Malfoy’s body. The hand moving beneath the denim, was going crazy, and Malfoy’s abdomen and jerking hips told the real story. Harry watched, hypnotically, as Malfoy’s crotch darkened. With his body still shaking, that spot of wetness spread through the fibers. Coin-sized, then going oblong as it drenched the fabric.
“Look, Sir,” she told Draco. “Look through the crayon and you can visit the halls of your old home again. Not the real one, but the one the children live in now. The model that takes up my room. I have these drawings. Each one is a portal, to be placed in your living quarters around the world. That way, no matter where you are, if you need to escape with the child, you can do so using the least harmful of the magics. Draco can stay there in comfort. He can hide if he needs to, just like the old days. The children were very helpful in giving me ideas. When his parents fought, these were Draco’s favorite rooms.”
Hermione, who had never dyed her hair and barely wore make-up, decided that Ginny’s expertise was needed. Ginny considered the adult chemicals she risked on her own hair versus the feather tenderness of Iece’s baby scalp, and brought Luna Lovegood on board for a gentler perspective.
They both tensed as Iece reached for Elsa’s outstretched arms and giggle at them over her shoulder. “Fwy like Esha!”
He stopped talking and looked down. Harry had shoved the whole book through the wall, back the way it came. His signature was written on the first page staring up at Bicksby, in Lucius Malfoy’s blood.
“Don’t let all these labels confuse you. You will be in control at all times. When you say stop, the generator will stop. If we’ve resolved nothing, your current struggles will remain. If you allow everything to play out, the contract improves.”
“It’s just an illusion to soothe people. Only the ones who are so troubled, that they’re ready to let go of harsh ideas, ever make it to this room. They require soothing.”
Well tonight, Harry was looking to swim in it. He was a fucking wizard, what did he have to fear from a grope in the dark?
He wanted to understand her, but he was afraid that asking her anything else would start another round of incomprehensible information that he couldn’t do anything with but gawk at.  So he asked, “Will it help Iece? Since my curse affected her?”
She rushed to make it okay. “Harry, there is no shame in the spirit world, not at your mother’s level. She’s not even your mother, she simply presents herself in a way that you can connect with and remember. We’re all old souls, we’ve done it all. There are no secrets. We’ve murdered and been murderers. We’ve been rapists and victims. Hell, I’ve been a slave owner as well as a slave. How else was I going to learn what it means to those who live it and invent a life where it cannot happen again? Look at my skin. My face, my whole body is my guarantee that I will never forget again that the races are not separate. Like my face, midnight is the demarcation of one phase becoming another, hence my name, Mama Midnight. I’m young and childless, but I want to teach like a mother. I want to teach everyone who looks at my skin in horror or appreciation, what my soul knows about the illusion of control over another. Rape is no different. Same classroom, different subject.”
He couldn’t always apparate to Harry in time. He wasn’t there the night that Lucius’s nocturnal visit left Harry in need of hospitalization on the floor of his hotel room, and front page news.
The thing opened its wings. It revealed a span too great to fit into the room. Skeletal extensions unfurled thick, opaque wings that held an opalescent sheen to them. Harry saw muscle definition pulling tendons to create a powerful airflow as it flapped its wings. Resulting wind blew everyone’s hair back as the creature convinced them of its reality. It thrashed in the sky, roaring on an auditory level that no ear heard, but which caused every heart to stumble off rhythm. It was an intimidating creature, as exciting to see as it was terrifying.
The crime that Draco described, had Harry imagining the worst. This is where Draco’s voice dropped, as if he’d suddenly missed a step. All confidence gone. Harry had to strain his hearing, pressing the cartilage of his ear as flat as it would go against the door.
Harry nodded, thinking. He asked, “Mr. Bicksby, does that mean that you’ve been following me? The fact that you knew and acted so fast?”
Narcissa swallowed back her emotions. "Please make peace with Harry. I want her to grow up with family. I want to be seen with my head held high and to show her off. I want to show the world that we too have come through our ordeal with renewal and blessings. We will not hide our pride just because of one awful night. Or a thousand awful nights. We have a place in this world. We have not abandoned our son and he has not given up on us. The child that people believe to be his, will be seen in our company, for we have survived intact. She will be a beacon of pride, not shame, as so many would like. She will represent our triumphs, not our failures."
At the end of it all, Rankar leaned over the bed and released his restraints as if it had all been a joke to him. “Just a precaution. You had quite a scare. And because I know your history, I know that you are not a threat to anyone. Ms. Grainger feels certain that this will go to court. If I’m called as an expert witness, I can give them my report from tonight. Medically, you show a complete recovery from your stroke, but your body and magic show excessive stress levels. And I’m sure that if I saw my child in the state that you and your friends described tonight, my stress would be through the roof.”
This was the part Harry dreaded, but knew it had to be gotten over with. When everyone was in earshot, she introduced him without preamble. He was grateful for the no frills, "Okay folks, this is your teammate, Harry Potter. He's been cleared to practice with us today."
Sirius walked up to Severus. “Do you think you could just maybe, I don’t know, handle your business?” He gestured to Elan, who held his head even higher.
Delirious laughter spilled out of Draco. “Spontaneous memory. My fucking father, I don’t want to deal with it.”
“I’m going to need to see that marriage contract. His body is attempting to honor many conflicting arrangements. Harry’s wishes take precedence above them all, and it is a shock to his system. He’s adapting to Harry’s magic and many old promises are falling away. But he is loyal to his family.” He looked at Lucius. “He will not let go of old agreements without being properly convinced to do so.”
As he wrapped Draco’s hands in bandages, wondering if the elf couldn’t get a doctor through, another idea occurred to him. What if…
Good grief. If he had not heard it before, he would’ve sworn that the boys were killing each other. It only took storming in on them once, to put a stop to the nonsense, to cure him of ever doubting they were really, sincerely having sex that way, and not just trying to annoy him. He’d seen too much that night. Too much skin. Too much dark tufts of hair, and too much of Harry disappearing into Draco.
As if the thought was too much to bear, his body gave up on that last gut-wrenching sob, and his head went limp again, turning away from Harry.
The child, Iece, is proof of hereditary contracts of magic that unify all conflict and heal all loss. To Narcissa, her new blood not only redeems them but rewards them by uniting with Harry’s magic, which has proven to be superior in the face of Voldemort’s defeat. Who knew? Narcissa is suddenly proud to be related to Harry and can’t wait to rub it in the faces of all who denounced her family.
Draco tried to leave Iece with Hermione on the day he visited her. He returned from the O’Hair Plaza and left reassured that Hermione and his sister needed the time to get acquainted. He thought he could do it. He thought he could make it through the night without her, but he called from his hotel room later that night to say that he’d be picking her up.
“Well, sir, I’m no psychotherapist. I don’t specialize in the mental arts, but neither can I ignore them. I’m trying not to commit to any statement that I can’t prove. What I’m trying to say is, your son is overwhelmed by something or someone. He’s given his power to it. He has his secrets for a reason. All I see when I look at him are layers of self-induced spells to help him cover up or cope. People who do that are usually covering up for someone. They feel it’s an unsolvable problem. Hence, the complexity of it lies with another human being and not simply external circumstances.”
No doubt, those little gears were sending vibrations to the nucleus of his nervous system, and the way he squirmed confirmed it. He whimpered over the physician’s mutterings and the older man gave instructions to place a bite guard into Harry’s mouth. The black piece resembles a thin rubber bar, not the athletic mouthpieces Black is familiar with.
The situation was looked upon as if one of their beloved were having a seizure, and not a single person was disgusted. Harry was out of his mind. He was no more aware of his clothes, or how they prevented contact, than he was of the people in the room. When his father couldn’t, Sirius undid his pants for him. That’s when everyone saw his readiness drip from him, and respected it.
“There was never a moment when I couldn’t take care of myself, Mr. Hastings. To your expertise, my condition may have appeared quite dire and alarming, but I have resources that would’ve seen me mended and functioning irrespective of your treatment, if left alone.”
“Till sunrise. The portals you have opened, will remain open until then. Excessive magic is roaming your environment freely at the moment. It will have to be reeled in. Under normal circumstances, it would hinder your daily life. Already, the occupants around you, find it difficult to leave. In the next hour, you will be able to shape this energy with your intentions. It will become the child you’re asking for. After that, the terms of your contract are set. You always have the ability to go in and change them, but you will do so at the reordering of your life, and expenditure of much energy and resources. It can be easy and effortless. But you’re not ready to let it be so.
"You come from me. You know what I know. You know what I saw, and where I saw it. Take me there. Show me." He stalled. The request felt incomplete. "Take me to where my body really landed in the wreckage."
“Where is this young man? When I was told I would be meeting him, I did a special meditation of gratitude that he and Severus could have this reunion. You are a great man to allow it.”
“He’s committed a series of secret acts that are in direct conflict with, not only your wishes, but with magical agreements put in place by his parents. Not being a virgin, is one of them. It’s an obsolete stipulation as far as the world is concerned but still quite purposeful to families who use breeding to amass magic. Second, having a child out of wedlock, and therefore out of his father’s control. And third,  taking deliberate measures to prevent the very magic that gives him the ability to birth children. He has so many penalties against him, shall we say, regarding promises that were made so that he could be their child, that your magic is attempting to deactivate them. The dragon rose up in defense, no doubt.”
Harry clinched his fist. He wished he had something to throw. “Don’t you dare talk to him like that! You have no idea what it’s like to be human. Sometimes, that’s almost nothing but fear. If he wasn’t ready, he did that kid a fucking favor. You have no right to punish him for doing what he had to do.”
Comprehension widened Ron’s eyes. “She can shock you? Are you bloody kidding me? How’d you teach her that?”
It was 3:00 A.M. before Harry could put the card down without picking it up again. Offended, humiliated, disgusted and awed, his psyche went through a gambit of emotions. He couldn’t get through watching it twice, without joining in, but that was only because it was more sex than he’d had in two years and refused to feel guilty for giving in. All three times. Who was this wizard? And even if he did take the job, how was he going to keep the guy off of him? A wank in the privacy of his own home did not equate to wanting anything to do with person.
“I was just trying to take his pain away. His dragon was so big because he gives it his repressed emotions. He was doing fine until you called him barren.”
Cosmic-Lucius smiled into the room. “First, let me say congratulations to you both. We’re glad to see you’ve made it back. You’ve addressed so much. Your masculinity is avenged. We’re so glad that you dealt with that little hang up. It sucks when you promise to have a child, and then actually go on to live in a society that frowns upon males having children.” He shrugged. “What are you going to do?”
Their strength knew where to flow because he possessed a double helix spinning in perfect unison to the master strands that created it, that nourished it. That structure was a vortex, imitating the spin of galaxies and the energetic aura of every living person on this planet. People, muggles and wizards alike, walked with many vortices creating a maelstrom of power some six feet around their bodies. Some more powerful than others. But his wasn't powerful because it was given that way. It was powerful because he honored it. He maintained it for those who had given it to him, and through it, they fed his magic. Like his ancestors, he grew it and refined it with his life. He raised Draco to do the same. Honor the blood and you will always have the most potent vein of magic, whatever life throws at you. Fortunes can be rebuilt. But don't lose your magic and don't diminish it with the non-magical around you. They're cute, but don't bring them home.
Snot, tears, and smears of Morell’s filth deformed Collin’s traumatized face. He could breathe properly again, but he choked on the stench and his own vomit. His terrified eyes quickly averted from the sight of his colleague’s body reassembling itself, and making the most horrid noises as it did so. Like a meat grinder in reverse. The process took seconds, but Collin was thoroughly green by then and humbled to never attempt to manipulate any magic left behind by Snape.
Harry had no idea what was going on, but his instincts would not let him wait for an answer. He used an invisible sweep of energy to shove the doctor way, and in that same motion, sent a body-binding spell over Draco, immobilizing his involuntary movements. Their parents rushed in behind him. Questions flew like daggers. Doctor Hayatt tried to explain. Magic was no longer working on Draco. Not his, anyway.
Lily found herself chewing on her pinky nail tensely, as she studied a copy of the Prophet her sister had handed her, over the breakfast table. Petunia didn’t subscribe to the paper, but she had secret wizard neighbors who could not pass up the opportunity to make sure that she knew.
Harry stammered and looked down at his slacks and long sleeve button up. This is what he would’ve worn regardless of the past few days. The shoes were yesterday’s new sneakers, but he hadn’t thought it mattered since he’d be standing behind a podium and part of him really didn’t give a damn. They were there to get his experiences, not look at his shoes. Even in his head, Draco tsked.
Harry overpowers Draco. This is a look at one of the most climactic moments of all the movies put together, which is so understated, that I'm highlighting it here. This is more of a PIC-enthusiastic discussion than Fic. But hey, straight from my imagination. My fourteen year-old self is like, 'This is better than barbies!' yes, I played with barbies for as long as I could. Fanfiction is now my barbies. :-)
Somewhere in the middle of that thought, anxiety lunged, real and undiluted. He grasped at the sound of hearing Draco tell Molly that he loved Harry. He’s never even spoken those words to Harry, let alone declared them so openly in front of anyone else. He may not have said them before, but his actions speak them everyday, Harry reminded himself. The bad feeling that came over him, that right now, he knew he didn’t have the faculties to give the statement the appreciation it deserved, made him realize that the spell must’ve peeked. Its effect must be lessening. He owed Draco a decent response to those words, but knew it wasn’t going to happen tonight.
He was just going to patronize her till she got in bed. Instead of lying down, she sat on her knees and put her fist under her chin. “Do you at least want to discuss our new son-in-law?”
"Go wherever the green glows. You have friends there." That statement, from his grandfather, was one of the set pieces that determined his travel to Ireland after his divorce. He didn't know what it meant, only that it comforted him.
He dared to break the silence. “If you’re sick, I’m not going to be able to think of anything else until you tell me what’s wrong.” Surely Draco could understand this. His ears were still ringing from those kicks. “Is that why you didn’t want to undergo any tests?”
This brought him some relief, because it pointed to what was wrong, and what needed to be fixed. He didn’t know how, but identifying the weak spot allowed him to stop searching for a problem and start focusing on a solution. He couldn’t fix Harry, and he damn sure couldn’t fix himself. But he could be an anchor. He could be Harry’s home.
Lily and James silently asked themselves this question. The Malfoys sat across from them, awaiting judgment, according to their mournful faces. Severus held the floor and waited to see who would recover first, so that he could get on with his findings. Elan sat at another table and maintained impressive containment over himself. This was business, so he let Severus take control.
He had no memory of agreeing to that text. Obviously, his image had been magically manipulated the way nonmagics digitally enhanced their photos and films. For some reason, it took the wind out of him and he suddenly felt that if he didn’t put food into his stomach, whether he wanted to or not, he would die on the spot.
He was still scared he’d start thinking and couldn’t stop. He’d find something to worry him. After five years of constant vigilance against this, there was bound to be alarms going off, lying to him about failing and falling for another man.
Harry looked mortified. “Dad, Grandma is drugging my husband. She told him the cakes would make all of this go away, and he opened the door and took one.”
“We would not be forced to such extremes if you’d read our letters or allowed us to speak with you. We tried everything.”
“It’s only one slice, torn in half. I cut everything so that she can do this. That’s why she likes nuggets so well. When you have a tiny mouth and hands, it’s easy food.”
Petunia looked insulted. “I didn’t say I wanted to leave, just that I wanted to send word to my husband so that he doesn’t worry himself sick. He’ll have the police involved by now.”
He’d wondered. Why wasn’t this enough for Sirius? For him, living with lycanthropy, to have someone who actually wanted him and was in love with him, meant everything. Why did Sirius have to be so bold and fearless about everything? He knew that Remus was practical, and drew the line at a lot of things. Number one, the wolf was never allowed in bed. Since that part of him was unpredictable, they engaged in nothing that would provoke the wolf. But Sirius had to always push his luck. He wouldn’t be Sirius if he didn’t.
He saw himself standing across from Eileen, talking to her, understanding her. Then he did the same with Snape.
Draco told him, “It’s okay if I’ve put you through so much, you don’t feel the same way. And maybe when we get out of here, I’ll lose my confidence. But I can still feel him against me, and let me tell you, that’s all I want. To live to be good enough to get to have that back. He must be incredible with love and magic, if he can do that to me. Sour me. So maybe, if something that wonderful came from this body, then it can’t be that bad. I can’t be that bad.”
Her head rocked gently up and down with a kind of slow comprehension. She kept her eyes forward. “You don’t want me saying nothing to him?”
Finally, when Draco discovered that the act made him feel better as well, he didn’t have to be persuaded so much. Picking her up began to feel natural, and not a betrayal to Harry. Draco warmed to the way she slept in his arms, and found out that she gave just as much comfort to him.
“I understand that it’s difficult for you to leave him alone again. Therefore, I ask that you stay in the room with us. You may observe everything.”
“It’s okay, it’s okay,” James soothed in his son’s ear. Harry drove forward, a stranger to all their eyes, like a bull without fear. He had to be held upright or he would’ve dove for Draco without any thought to preparation. At this moment, he was legally insane, and Lucius forgot his distaste for the muggle god and prayed for Draco’s safety.
That man wasn’t likely to be forgiving, even if Ash hadn’t known who he was touching in the dark. As sharp as he was, Foster wasn’t exactly the voice of reason. At least, not when it came to that young man. The feel of Harry against him, the taste of Harry still lingering in his mind, scared Ash into plotting his way around Foster.
Harry made a cutting-off gesture in front of his throat. It was his way of saying he couldn’t go on stage. He shifted his daughter and felt another person gently pulling her beside him. He heard soft words, “May I?” and looked to see Thella, shawl covering her head, as she requested to hold Iece for him.
Instead of waiting for him to offer his hand, she took it, pumping it gently. “Finally. What brings you here, Mr. Potter?”
Impatience and pity crinkled her brow. “I’m being given something very disturbing. We’re talking about world governments hidden behind world governments. Authorities have no authority. When they want to incite people to act, they manufacture catastrophes that inspire helplessness. They try to turn parties against each other to construct more advantageous power systems. They run this planet like a business. Nonmagics are cattle to them, and you must not disturb their cattle. The only way out of their influence, is to cultivate your own love and peace. Millions of people change their minds about taking airplanes and trains, or turning a corner, or switching lanes in traffic, everyday, and they escape the influence. People are not helpless. The same spirit that is in constant contact with your mother, is in constant contact with everyone. How close you are to love, centered securely in it, or raging outside of it, determines how clearly you receive the pure message to switch lanes or to not board a train. This is how we all make our choices.”
“I don’t see how you can,” he said cautiously. He didn’t want to offend her. Her words rang true, but it was all a bit much to start with, and he was losing his way. “Is this why I’m here? Why you asked me into the picture? I thought you had vital information about Snape. This isn’t really about me. I’m trying to help my daughter.”
That gold dawn, it wasn't coming from the sun. It was coming from Draco. A night of first touches, of lovemaking as honey-colored in amber lamplight, as the morning that greeted them. A little shy, a little nervous that they'd onl
Her little body felt rigid against him and he understood that she wasn’t at all accustomed to physical touch or this kind of expression. He tried to make it quick, for her comfort, but he thought of what it would’ve been like to hold Dobby and remembered that he never got to until it was too late. Would he have feel like this? Like some little rubber mannequin, only warm beneath his pillowcase? She was as small as a child, and he just wished he’d been able to give Dobby as much grateful affection as this, just to say thank you for all the times he’d helped. Just to let him know that he’d forgiven all the nasty tricks Dobby had played, that had Harry seriously hating him at one time. He knew he couldn’t use her to make up for the past, so he let her go gently and checked to see if she was okay.
They were suspicious of him. And he them. Ash had not needed to cripple him with drugs to keep him in his home. He learned that some other ailment had the delayed effect of paralysis in the right side of Foster's body. He never got the story out of him. It took days to work out that his puncture wounds were that of a poisonous bite. Many reptiles could produce paralyzing venom. Ash was left to deduce that Foster's tattoo indicated rituals with snakes. A ritual gone badly wrong. Venom that merely limited his movement, would possibly be quite deadly to a weaker person. He was grateful to that reptile. The man needed treatment and lodging. Ash let it be known that his home, and his discretion, were available. He thought he had the upper hand until he awoke one morning to find that Mr. Foster had accepted his offer, in the form of gold coins stacked on his bedside table.
No one missed how her hand wrapped itself around her husband’s as she looked Harry’s family in their eyes. “Those of us who are older and wiser, know what a trifle thing virginity is. Let’s not make it the bane of this courtship. Not when these two are so well matched on paper.”
Though Harry’s immediate reaction shut out everything but his need to survive in those moments, his greater, observational mind recorded who was doing that to him. He lay on the floor, at the mercy of those five wands, and Snape, an observer, was able to trace each wand’s discharge back to its owner. He studied the curse. It differed from the one cast upon him over a decade before. It was signature based, meaning that it could not be affected by anyone not possessing the originating magical signatures. The identities of those wizards were like keys required to unlock in tandem. All five had to be present. There was no point getting his hopes up for that. His instincts told him they were dead or damaged beyond helping him. But if he could find their wands, then their magic lived in some measure. Their identities were still present on earth, if irreversibly compromised. From there, he used his own magic like a dowsing rod, to lead him in the current direction of each wizard. When he followed the trails, he never found any graves, only new grass where bodies had lain before being defiled and burned. Apparently, he wasn’t the only one with a score to settle and most of those wizards got exactly what they deserved.
He listened as best as he could to the Admiral’s appeal over the next hour. All he could think of was gathering Iece and Draco tonight, and getting them to some remote place. Memories of Uncle Vernon rowing them all to a lighthouse surrounded by water, made his heart ache with understanding how terrified his uncle must’ve been.
She did something with her mouth just then. A sort of teeth-biting, lip compression thing that Ash mistook for compliance.
“You’re not in any danger, Sweetie. Please forgive us. We couldn’t go any longer without speaking to you. It’s an important matter. Since you won’t take our owls, we had to resort to this. We had no choice. It concerns the safety and health of Harry’s daughter. Please come out and talk to us.”
“Not every detail. We had our suspicions early on. Your mother dealt with it by dismissing it. I put magic into place to make it more difficult for you. Each holiday visit, I asked you to finish the candied dates, to keep from hurting your mother’s feelings. It’s the only dish she knows how to prepare. They were laced with chastity charms. We didn’t know what birth control would do to you, especially since we’d asked specifically for a child from you. We couldn’t take chances with that. So we were tense throughout your relationship with this Kevin fellow. But your medical reports kept coming back fine. Your doctors deemed you still intact as far as sexual engagement went, so we were pleased that our charms were working. We were pleased that you abstained, whether it was our doing or yours.”
She looked like she wanted to throw her drink in his face. “Ronald Weasely, you could very well have a daughter some day. Do you want her to know that you’re secretly ashamed of all that her body represents?”
Harry knew about the cremation. Knew that, apparently, it was instructed in his will. It fit Snape perfectly, all except for the public display and the added flourish of care that McGonagall inserted between the cracks. No one as fastidious in his public façade as Snape, would've wanted anything left of his body hanging around to be scrutinized or defiled. The number of attendees made Harry proud, and he hoped that Snape somehow could've seen it as well.
“Luna, your left. Ron, everything in Harry’s direction. Ginny, everything to the right. Draco, everything behind me. Now!”
"Listen to me. My father will never get custody of her. If anything happens to me and Harry, it's already fixed that what happened that night will be fully disclosed to the judicial authorities involved. They'll put her in foster care before they give her to that man."
Several audience members shouted this request at the same time. He’d forgotten about questions. “Um, sure, I’ve got time for a few.”
Lucius turned purple with indignation. His throat swelled with venom he was too injured to express. “You, sir, have already worn out your welcome. You have no authority to offer this boy such responsibilities.”
Crushed into his shirt, having no choice but to endure his cologne, which wasn’t that bad, Harry laughed. “We couldn’t have gotten through that, without all this extra magic. I have to thank all of you for that.”
Draco kept his head turned and his eyelids at half-mast, as if Harry were boring him. Harry saw through the act and kissed him anyway. “Don’t wait up, I know you’re tired. Whatever this house thing is, we’ll get it straightened out. She can’t have your childhood ghosts, and I can’t have Grimauld Place getting any creepier than it already is.”
Smiling, she seemed to bat her eyes, imitating something she’s seen witches do, and sauntered over with the tray, placing it at the foot of Iece’s bed. Her walk was a saunter, if Harry had to put a verb to it, but it was utterly practiced and unnatural on her spindly elf legs. It took him and Draco a minute of staring at her to realize she was doing a great impersonation of someone.
“But I didn’t have to make deals with my ancestors in order to get a healthy child. I didn’t have to promise his life for his magic.”
He made himself stop thinking along these lines. It caused his mood to grow heavy, and anxiously wander to the hope of contacting Snape. A tiny thought sneaked in. If he had caught a glimpse of Snape at the train explosion, and Snape was clearly aware of him on some level. Then he didn’t want Harry to find him. He didn’t want to be known and involved publicly.
He thought better of explaining himself. The less he said, the less of a chance he would further confuse Draco. If he mentioned portkeying to America on such short notice, that wasn’t going to go over well. He didn’t even know how it was all going to work, so he had to get moving.
“In essence, you’re going to create a dream that we can all see. But it will seem quite real to you. On the level of symbols, it will be real and have distinct effects. I will send you in, to help you create a dialogue with your committee, and therefore the contract itself. Stand here. Harry, behind him. I’m going to show you a series of lights. They’re actually more than that, but everyone here will see them as lights. You will look into each one and tell your community what you see.”
Harry had questions, but a series of insights left him at a loss for words. He liked the way Jipsy talked. He liked that she could stand up to Draco. He wasn't sure if her reasoning was sound, but at least she had some ability to reason. But things were happening too fast. How had Draco managed a contract so soon? And was she implying that she'd known the job would come to her in a form of precognition?
Petunia scowled at the interruption, but then recognized the wizard and sat up straight, sputtering. “No!”
She sat listening. All Harry could hear were people passing by the tent. “Oh dear. Just asking that, flares emotion in him. He’s very fragmented when it comes to you. Very desperate. He’s not saying anything. It’s obvious that he wants to talk to you, but it isn’t obvious why he does not. Your mother says that his spirit is here to act as a guide for you, just as all of them are. But the fact that his living body knows so much, is allowing it to fear what you might want. She says you should let him have his secrets for now. They have all gathered here to help you. You’re the one who’s under attack.”
“I swear, if I die here, I will do everything in my power to haunt you. I might be mortal. I might be a dumb, magicless muggle, but I believe the spirit survives death and I will do to you in death, what I can’t do to you in life. You’ll never be rid of me.”
Harry came out of himself. He hunched forward. “That can’t be true,” he insisted with head-shaking denial.  He leaned over Avi’s desk, as if the act could’ve given them all better results.
She looked cautious. “I don’t deny it. But magic doesn’t have to obey any rules, Harry. My son was more influential in your parent’s life than you realize. I will let him be the one to share that little sweetheart with you.”
“It’s personal. Very personal. Draco and I have problems because of that curse. It’s not over for us. Our hell is as fresh today as it was years ago and my daughter is suffering for it. She’s being hospitalized right now for what that curse did before she was even born. So I let Lucius know how effective and lasting his crimes are on all our lives. No matter how much time he did in prison, he’s still hurting us. Her. I couldn’t let him get away with that. It wasn’t revenge. It was problem-solving. She’ll never be safe as long as he has access to her. He hates the fact that she exists. She’s a reminder of, of what he did to his son.”
“Where do I get a drink?” As soon as he’d asked it, he realized it might seem naive. This wasn’t exactly a bar. Did people bring their own? How did it work?
Mark whooped, holding his fist out for a bump. She obliged. The sight amused Harry, who had never done a fist bump but knew it was an American show of bravado. “See ya at the bar,” she grinned before leaving. She had a cropped, wedge-looking hair style, extremely dark skin, and muscular definition to her biceps, but she sauntered with rounded, feminine grace that had Mark pointing at her arse and making clawing hands behind her while the others laughed. Harry got the feeling they were a couple, or at least shagging.
He should've been insulted, but somewhere behind is anger, he thrilled to her acknowledgement of what he brought to a room. He took the newspaper with him.
His stomach did somersaults and his hard-on went into overdrive at the memory of fishing around through Dan’s zipper and making him squirm. At the time, in his immature mind, a part of him bought into the whole Dan as Harry mentality. On one level, this really was the special Boy Who Lived and no matter how fake the story was, people treated Dan with all the love and adoration that Harry had earned for himself as a hero. And Tom shared that love, that spotlight, not just because he played Draco, but because Dan really liked him. Dan was really a super cool guy, who let him do this, and who touched Tom back. The best time, when they were sixteen and sharing a trailer, and one night Dan spontaneously turned off their television to lay back and say that Tom could do whatever he wanted to him, had been the best.
Behind Harry, Emerald’s head went back, taking in her surroundings. Mouth open, her whole body turned as she made sense of the  beautiful, but stale hall, and the forest surrounding it. “I feel like we’re in Oz.”
He felt like he was forgetting something, but he had to act fast. The hour he’d given her was provisional. He didn’t know how to contact Thella and even though he knew he could portkey to her country, he didn’t have the ring on that Bicksby had given him. And even if he had it, he’d never used it before, so there was bound to be a learning curve. After debating with himself over whether or not to take Eileen’s photo with him, he decided he really ought to. He hated risking any damage to it, but the detour to Thella felt like it was going to cost him valuable time, and he promised himself to have a wizard copy made and put in his own vault as a precaution.
The question hooked in Draco’s voice. Harry realized he was more upset about this prospect than he was about his father. But he was hiding so much at the moment, Harry couldn’t be sure. Draco’s self-contained movements and subdued manner reminded him of a tightly sealed jar under pressure. He would’ve felt so much better if he would just yell at him. But maybe he didn’t deserve to feel better.
“Since I can’t prove any of that, which far exceed my professional scope, I will have to rely on your compassion to consider what or who has the ability to cause your son to live in such magical confinement. These are the types of cues we see in prisoners of war. Not to exploit his privacy, but there are even celibacy charms forced into place. The name, Concealment Syndrome, actually comes from survivors of the muggle Holocaust, in connection to those they felt responsible for. For many witches and wizards, their magic was drained under the effort of hiding and protecting victims of the war, to the point that they never recovered from it. It doesn’t happen overnight, but it’s the equivalent of magical suicide. The question isn’t who’s hurting him. It’s whom would he hurt himself this much for?”
It helped when she added, “I’m not saying any of it has to happen, because it doesn’t. But when we can’t plot another way out, even if it’s just in our minds, even if it’s imaginary, then we’re locked into an unalterable course. Now, I can imagine a million ways to run an estate without slaves. And I am always certain of my power, which ensures that I will never be anyone’s property again.”
This started another round of loud bickering, and Harry took out his wand. The motion was so fast and determined, that Narcissa flinched and drew hers.
The first pill should’ve shut his body down by now. He wasn’t even sleepy. He took another. There were lots of demons tonight. The way his body wanted what Greg had started, he was afraid he’d conjure another night of paralyzing suffering. He couldn’t let that happen. Damn Greg. That guy knew he was a good kisser. That’s why he’d done it. If Harry knew he could get away with using Greg’s body and leaving him cold, he would’ve done it. But the hate behind an idea like that, left a terrible backlash of images. He kept seeing a skinny, drug addled preteen girl, with white-blond hair, sprawled at a murder scene. Why was his mind doing this to him?
Murmurs of agreement washed over the crowd. It took Harry back, but he exchanged glances with the Minister and had an answer for that. “I was involved in that incident. It’s true. However, I’ve given my statements to the investigators. I’ve even shown them my memories and they’ve been ruled inconclusive, so they’re not going to do much good here. I didn’t see anything, so I don’t have anything to show you.”
Severus found Lily consoling Petunia in the sitting room. Her sister clutched a wad of tissue and dabbed her eyes.
For Lucius, it was all contingent on whether Harry Potter exhibited the value his documented pedigree promised. The Potters were not purebloods, but the most potent strains of magic could be traced to James Potter’s forebears, at least one of which connected him to Lucius’s wife, Narcissa. Her maiden name, Black, could also be found in the archives of Potter’s ancestral vaults. The match between their children was already ordained in greater worlds. The Potters had only to please Lucius’s discerning eye, to make it so in this one.
“So according to Weasley logic, Harry got pregnant because his body was asking for my father’s child?”
Now at twenty-two, Harry and she still shared that connection. Anything she wanted to know, his psyche emitted volumes of signals that her mind turned into meaning. Her ability to interpret what came to her was subject to error, but after twenty-two years, she always got the core of the matter right. And she knew just how much her Harry was intrigued by this new suitor.
It was out of Harry's lips before he could stop it. "Griphook bent the law in hopes of getting his treasure. How do I know there aren't others who would do the same?"
Harry tried to play the love-sick fool. He tried to swallow the insult. But it was one too many. He was trying too hard, and Draco wasn’t trying at all. He realized, he was so terrified of Draco leaving him again, that he was willing to put up with being treated this way. If he grabbed him and shook him, that wasn’t going to put him, lifeless, back downstairs. It wasn’t going to kill him, but that’s the fear he felt.
He wouldn’t be expected to hold back. He’d scream, ‘Fuck you! Get off!’ But he wouldn’t mean it. He wouldn’t have to mean it. Finally, he could let go. Every scream he’d ever suppressed, was allowed to come out then. And oh, there’d be hands that weren’t his, giving him so much squeezing slippage and lip-biting, toying strokes, that he couldn’t be held accountable for what he left on those tiles.
Draco had shaken his head slowly. Gravely. "You haven't touched her. She was born two weeks ago and you're just now looking at her."
Harry tried not to flinch when the pink, scrawny, four pound thing squirmed against him. She was a thing to him, something he needed to face, like a tragic car accident. He might not have liked his circumstances, but he steeled himself not to take it out on her. He had no idea what he was supposed to do with her, and she represented the bleakest part of his life.
Aggressive sex, when done with characters who have souls, is just a variation on the noncon theme. At the heart of noncon, are emotions that want to get out. Please stop putting down writers who need to write this. They just need a place to put their tears and their love. For us, well-written noncon is the sweet spot, and we can finally let ourselves cry for the tragic characters trapped in its ecstasy. Which, by the way, is written to look like pain because, well, think of what people's facial expressions look like when they're climaxing. It's not pretty. So I don't show pretty when I write a noncon scenes. I show intensity. (The best representation I have for this, is Masterpiece – Severus).
Avi Rankar sat on the edge of his cot and rubbed his eyes, waiting on his Keurig to produce a perfect cup of coffee. He had never learned to tolerate the vending machine potwater and gas station public crude, that passed for gourmet coffee, for so many of his colleagues. If he had to spend two-thirds of his life camping in cramped hospital basements, focusing non-stop on cures to alleviate the ailments of the world, he was going to do so with the best cup he could afford. And that was not prepared by anyone else’s hands other than his own. It was his only vice, and he got ill-tempered if he couldn’t enjoy the first cup alone. He missed his large office in Dartford.
Snape’s chin lifted as he directed his words to Morell. “I have two of the five bodies and collected all of your wands, which retain stores of your magic, for the wizard who knows how to use them. Your wand is broken, Collin, but I will wrench as much service from you and those inept fibers as I can get. Give me the recipe of the curse and I’ll lift it myself.”
“Look,” he said, ‘He was a brilliant wizard. I would not put it past him to be alive. I believe what the Goblins told you about his ashes.”
“Did you get the Potter child’s blood this morning? I requested an early analysis to cross-reference with her levels from yesterday. It was supposed to be on my desk this morning.”
The magical creature pranced around the room several more times before streaking back to its progenitor. Harry’s wand tip still glowed, even though the link between it and the animal was no longer visible. He would’ve allowed the stag to dissipate, but the creature seemed too strong, as if it existed with more than the intention to merely be seen. When it walked up behind his chair, he waited to see what would happen. This demonstration was for Draco, so the animal’s behavior might’ve been drawn to Draco. It simply stopped behind Harry’s chair, facing Draco, and steamed the air with illusory breaths. Its antlers wreathed the space above Harry’s head with bark-like points of growths that continued to extend until the antlers curved forward, like jagged, cupped hands around Harry’s chair, particularly his shoulders and head.
His gaze fastened tightly on Collin before turning to the body under the sheet. He spoke to his hired goblin, “Thank you, Grail. You may leave.”
When Snape could do no more for him, he'd ordered Draco, "Keep yourselves here. Stay hidden. It isn't safe for him to apperate again right now. As soon as it is, I want you to take him to a very specific location. You'll be safe there. I'll look in on you when I can. You must not let him leave until I give him the clear."
Lily continued. “That’s about to happen. We hope. We’ve managed to bring in a very ingenious wizard. Some of you will remember my friend, Severus Snape.”
Lucius’s silk, bed attire of grey and burgundy gown, trousers, and robe, were generously referred to as “an eccentric smoking jacket” in one report, and “cross dresser” in another, as viewers pondered over his alabaster good looks and how they were being ruined by all that lost skin drug over the asphalt.
“No you don’t. Not if it’s not really what you want to do. We can hire our own security. Before you protest, what’s the difference between us signing their check or this CIUM signing their checks? Your number one complaint would be the intrusion on our lives, but I’m telling you, there’s a class of security where we’d never see our employees unless we wanted to. They’re not going to be flanking your daughter on her first day of school, but they will have enough access to put themselves between her and any danger. She’ll never know they’re there.”
He thought about it. As he scanned the interior, he sensed that something was out of place. His eyes tracked the disturbance to the very object lit from within a dim cabinet. Behind glass and grill, the locked crystal held its own red illumination. It seemed brighter than usual and gave off a faint aura. Snape frowned. It wasn’t time to bring Ash out of that sphere. The thing glowed as if reminding him of what he banished. He needed no reminding. He would tend to that matter later. Without using his wand, his magic reached out and slammed the doors closed on the crystal.
The villagers had gasped, to see him mistreat their prince so, but he knew what he was doing. He knew this body was not dead. He tasted this man's life and breathed it deep into his lungs, giving it back. And still, Draco would not open his eyes.
That was all the threat he needed to hear, before grabbing Emerald and telling her to stay behind him.
When Collin awoke, his relationship with his body was not the same. He would never walk again, even with magic, even if Snape allowed him to live. However, that information was hidden from him with masking spells that let him think he could sometimes feel his legs and body recovering. He needed to be given some hope, if he was to be cooperative enough to provide answers.
Hermione's street was as neatly lined and partitioned as the muggle sensibilities that had built it. The trees were older than one normally saw in suburban neighborhoods. Their wide trunks grew up through cobbled stones that decorated their bases at each corner. They were spaced between stretches of sensible, wrought iron fences in front of each house. Two, to a bus stop, provided weatherproof canopy as well as old charm to a grid of brown brick townhouses. As an unusual amount of sun created long shadows over her quiet street, Draco thought it didn't look like such a bad place. Although, his stomach knotted at the sight of a perfectly white steeple stretching further down, to the end of her street. He stopped the car, then made himself drive on. People with magic didn't get caught in those trappings anymore. Religious people weren't allowed to harm witches and wizards anymore, but that didn't mean it didn't happen. He got it. Churches were charming and all, they gave nonmagics comfort, but she wouldn't do that to Iece, would she? She'd have to fucking swear to it.
She had the decency to lower her head, but brought it back up defiantly. “Mr. Potter, I’m sorry that you were tortured. But you’re not the first person to ever have sex against your will. In pureblood families, it’s almost a rite of passage, and a matter of familial duty. I love my husband now, but not when I was nineteen and ordered to marry him. I gave my body, so that my family could thrive. And not gladly. Not at first. That came later. Lucius was not a monster and didn’t act like one until he himself fell victim to one. We weren’t trying to scar you, we were trying to keep Voldemort from killing our son. I didn’t know the Dark Lord would order my husband to be so cruel to you. I endured that night because I thought that would be the end of it.”
Harry’s absence gave James time to show Lily the documents. As soon as she understood, her hand flew to cover her open mouth. Balled fists reached for the roots of her hair. “Nooooo!”
Abria barked instructions for the medic and players to dig their teammates out. When the last of the heavy, waterproof canvas had been thrown aside, Harry’s head was the first to pop up through metal and wood supports. Disheveled and bruised, his lip was bleeding but he looked to be in one piece. A flash went off in his face. Abria and the other players grimaced at the photographer before shouting for Greg. They uncovered him, at first unconscious, but waking upon being carried to a levitating cot. Once the medic determined that his most serious injuries were bruised ribs and a cracked elbow, everyone breathed easier.
She didn’t appear to trust him until a mist came from his wand that looked as much like the animation as he could get it. His version of Elsa, sprouted on vapor and romantic notions of what a vision she should be. He only vaguely remembered some details of her clothing, but knew that she had gorgeous white hair, same as Iece, and exaggerated that quality until her hair and gown unfurled like a giant flower, spraying the space above Iece’s head with white-diamond sparks, as fine as powder. The baby’s mouth hung open and her pupils dilated. Her tiny hands lifted to clap, but could only manage to grasp themselves tightly. A bit of drool escaped her wondrous expression.
He'd gotten a private car for a reason. He didn't want to think of himself as a pervert, but Dr. Rankar's instructions had so far gone unfollowed. Every time the thought occurred to him, do it quick, do it now, he dismissed it as being ridiculous. But he knew it wasn't ridiculous. The desire to punch something, or to lash out, could start as small as the temptation to tell the Minister what his two-toned mustache really looked like to his constituents. It made him look like an elderly gigolo, well past his prime. He'd been edging towards blunt honesty lately. Usually, there were no degrees between that and running for the closet so that he didn't have to hold back. But he'd learned to read the signs, the twitches he ignored and the comments he held back. His body was giving him warnings that enough emotion was built up. It needed out. He could cooperate nicely or have it taken out of his hands completely.
This raised a million questions, all stuck in Harry’s throat. How much could he reveal about Lucius? About his own psychic attack, and now his daughter’s? He would have loved to believe that her reaction was simply about having her hair cut, but he didn’t believe that at all. He refused to accept that magic gave a shit about things like hair and appearances. He hesitated too long and Rankar was helping him sit up, slapping him on the back, and walking towards the door in the next moment.
“It’s just a toy. It’s one of the few things from my side of the family that she can have. I was just as thorough about checking it as I was the bracelet.”
He was already dressed and he decided not to drive, but to floo. The hotel didn’t have the proper facilities, so he had to stand in the tub and transfigure curtain and rod to create a physical link to the coded network available to him. A license to hardwire access into the magical infrastructure, came when he’d completed his second term in the Dark Artifacts Department. He could’ve apparated, but he hadn’t thought to warn her he’d do that. Her wards might be up, and he didn’t want to give her too much time to prepare for his arrival. She’d detect his entrance, but it would give him a moment to catch her by surprise. He hadn’t liked the sound of her and Ginny Weasley socializing downstairs while Iece was left alone in a strange bed. He wanted to catch them off guard. He’d floo back and return with the car if Iece seemed okay. He wasn’t sure if it was safe to floo with her yet. He’d risk it, but not if he didn’t have to.
Draco looked serious at her. “He’ll be very proud.” It was evident to them that he was still thinking of his son, and loving at any cost.
Gamy plugged her ears over his volume, and Harry and James frowned in the wake of it. Sirius was drunk. He turned back to them, taking in their disapproval. He knew what they were thinking. “It’s not everyday my Godson finds his soulmate. When you said we were going to celebrate, I saw no reason to wait.”
“Um, when all of this is over, Draco and I are going to need to retreat. How do you feel about visiting Grimauld place and giving it a thorough cleaning? You and Kreacher can work together.”
Astonished delight followed the sight of Draco’s theater-screen sized image, as his story began to unfold. At first, chatter bristled, moving like a wave throughout the room, until vehement shushes made it clear that some people could understand the language and wanted to hear what was being said. Dudley held his breath that nothing untoward was in the documentary, and when it was over, he casually let it slip that there was another one. They wanted to see it. A lot of them were genuinely surprised that Draco was more than just his looks and money. It put the marriage into context and gave them a stronger reason to cheer them on as a couple. By the time it was over with, they were visibly relaxed about their prolonged stay, but making comments that addressed their concern for whatever was causing the delay in meeting him.
He joined them and quickly noticed who wasn’t there. He turned to Quay, who sat on Mark’s lap. She held her beer in one hand and denied Mark his in her other hand.
When had the most horrific part of his life become a joke? Critics were right to accuse the campaign of rose-colored hindsight, if this was how history was being treated. It was an insult to everyone who had lived and died, and it had his face all over it. No wonder people hated him. He wasn’t about to endorse that life for Iece. He knew that the advertising slant was more than likely just another miscommunication among thousands, between organizers, graphic directors, and marketing boards. Still, it was too important a topic to misrepresent.
The goblin picked up his bowl. “What makes you think this is for you?” He blew on his stew and sipped the broth.
After two weeks, he owed the both of them what Rankar would’ve called, “a positive sexual experience.” Even before the train wreck, they hadn’t had one of those in a long time. The way his body had responded to Greg’s kiss, told him his sexual power and joy was still there. Maybe there’d been too much pressure with Draco, too much baggage. But tonight, he was ready for it. His body remembered what it was all about and his cock practically pointed the way as it led him through rooms that once turned his stomach at the thought of their occupants, but now assured him he’d make love to Draco in every single one of them and finally claim the place as his own.
Snape was about to tell him to start walking for an exit, when Morell turned, “You know,” he said, “A new hospital is better than an old prison. I wish I could help you, my old friend. But I can’t do this anymore.”
