“And you are
“So much I want to rip it apart” Harry said, his hands trailing up Draco’s thighs, over his fishnet stocking and under his skirt “Come up here” He ordered, and it was almost as if Draco knew what he meant when the blond climbed back up until he was kneeling above Harry, he rested his hands on the headboard and pulled his skirt up at the same time
Harry kissed him tenderly, caressing his lips while his hands trailed from Draco’s neck down to his waist, pulling him closer until their chest touched. Draco smiled into the kiss and embraced Harry tightly, he’d definitely join Harry’s birthday tonight, after all, he has become his boyfriend.
“10 Galleons Ginny will get drunk again tonight and pass out” Harry leaned over, his face close to Draco’s ear, making the blond shiver with goose bumps
“Yeah, maybe it’s for the better” Harry said, earning a loud groan from Ron.
was all Draco could say before his mother kept speaking.
did you get bigger when I left or am I wrong?” The blond smiled at him before lowering himself down and pulling Harry’s cock out, which was glistening with precome. The Auror propped himself up on his elbows and watched as Draco stroke his length and teased him by licking at the head, his eyes never left Harry’s “I’m really concern whether I could take this or not”
And about that request, do you mean it? Do you
“Are you teasing me?”
“Y-yeah…if you want to” Ernie looked down, avoiding Draco’s smug look “I think…I think I like him”
” Harry let out a low incoherent growl before looking at their friends “Yes, breezy, I think it looks nice on you, Mione”
Because
have feelings for Potter again in that six months, but he thought he’d never have the chance. He didn’t think Potter would actually be attracted to him
“I don’t—…” Ginny stuttered before cackling “Okay, I admit it, but
“Pansy,
“Nah, he’s my husband, he’s like an egg, hard on the outside and soft on the inside” Ron waved him off and sighed “No matter what anyone thinks, he’s actually really sweet and he never does anything when he gets jealous except talking it out. This is merely a competition and I am winning, and he’s going to have to buy me food if he loses”
Harry murmured as Draco looked up at him, he tightened his grip on the blond’s hair and pushed Draco further, he breathed in with his nose, swirling his tongue inside. He has done it way too many times to know just which way to make Harry go insane. Harry leaned back on the table, pushing himself inside Draco’s mouth as the blond moaned in pleasure “
Draco retorted but he didn’t have any proof, it did in fact contain all articles of Harry “It’s just for fun”
“You can hug me” He mumbled quietly and he could feel Potter immediately rolling over to see him
“What does it look like I’m doing?” Draco groaned, switching leg and put his right leg on the tub “I’m shaving”
Pansy squawked, her hands raising in the air, Draco was so certain he had caught her, but the plan has only just begun “
Draco opened his eyes slowly, his breath hitched when he saw the sight around him. Many tombstones standing in rows, the snows were covering most of them, except for the one in front of him. There it was, the sentenced engraved upon the tombstone. ‘
“Because, because Ron thinks the one I like wouldn’t suspect it”
He said with a serious tone, pointing at the two Aurors that were gossiping “You two there, noisy boys, Auror Potter and Auror Weasley, can I please have your attention?”
“You looked fucking hot in those leather suspenders” Blaise broke off the kiss, murmuring words softly, one hand squeezing Ron’s arse while his other hand slithered into his lubed rim, when Blaise’s finger pushed in, Ron held back a moan
“Er, well…I know you’d be here”
“Annoying?”
“Really?”
“What? What did I do?”
“That’s an
Pansy rushed in the room and Draco mentally groaned, like mother like daughter, they both like barging in rooms “
“Pansy told me about your pact” Hermione said with a smile
“Well,
“Do you think he actually did it?”
Draco muttered breathlessly in Harry’s ear and he just has to obey, pushing the third finger in, opening Draco up nicely. Draco has got a small tattoo four years ago, it was in the shape of a small Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon, sleeping soundly on the left side of Draco’s chest. Harry has always loved it because whenever he touched the tattoo, the dragon would wake up, flapped its wings and curled back up into a ball to sleep, and it only did that to Harry. He remembered the times everyone of their friends tried to make it move, but Harry was the only one being able to rile it up. Harry placed a soft kiss on the tattoo and watched the dragon woke up again, flapping its wing and opened its mouth to roar soundlessly before going back to sleep. The Auror chuckled and leaned up to connect their lips again, slower this time, his fingers still working Draco’s inside.
“Potter, what is it now?” He got off the bed and waited for Potter to come close. He still looked fine to Draco from the outside “Are you hurt again?”
Potter growled against his ear, shoving in repeatedly, Draco couldn’t help smiling, this was all he asked for. For years, he has been wanting Potter’s love, now he has it, and it might have taken seven years or more than that to achieve it, it was totally worth it. The feeling of skin against skin, the feeling of Potter thrusting in with passion, the feeling of his kisses, Draco has longed for this day for ages
“Er, what?” Harry looked up and saw Hermione looking at him, squinting, like she knew something was wrong “Sorry, what did you say?”
” Hermione rolled her eyes at Pansy before looking back at Draco “You guys have always been…stuck to each other right?” She smiled “In a way. You’ve always been on the opposite sides, Gryffindors, Slytherins, Seekers for different teams, different sides in the war, different teams as Aurors,
“You are who I desire too” Draco cupped his face, feeling their distance narrowed “I like you so much too, I want to love you, Harry, I want to love you badly”
, I realised I liked him” Draco replied to Hermione with a blush “I stopped going up to the Tower, I avoided him until graduation, I avoided him in Aurors’ trainings” Draco sighed “It didn’t work, he still makes me…
“Yes,
“Pansy, you
“No, seriously,
“He could run away” Harry said, grabbing his quill and looking at Ron, leaning his cheek on his hand “He’d be freaked out and then he’d move out, and it would ruin our friendship, and I would lose him”
“It’s just that, during the eight years that I’ve know you, you were never sick”
“It’s fine, Harry” Draco looked at him with a soft smile and kissed his cheek “I’m fine, it’s not my favourite shirt anyway” He said when they stopped in front of the Grimmauld Place. As they opened the door in, Harry wondered when he could propose next. Maybe they could travel to somewhere romantic, or maybe another dinner, maybe go back to Hogwarts to propose. Harry groaned mentally as they got in the house, he was so fucked.
“Really?” Ron asked, walking around him and standing behind his chair
He liked how Potter kiss him, how he touched Draco’s body, but moreover, he realised he liked Potter because of all the time he had wanted his attention, doing everything to just get a reaction back from the former Gryffindor back when they were in Hogwarts. All those time he wondered why he asked for another Healer instead of Draco, it wasn’t curiosity Draco was feeling, he was just worried about him, he was worried whether the other Healer was good enough for Potter. When he claimed he didn’t care, he actually cared a lot, every time Ron rushed in St Mungo’s, he feared something bad had happened to Potter, and though he never said it, his heart always did a small flip whenever Potter recovered. Draco Malfoy was never good with feelings, but he was good at hiding it, so Pansy was right, he liked Potter, and it could be that he always buried his feelings for Potter deep down, so deep he never wanted to admit it, because he feared it wouldn’t be returned, since they were so different. And yet, here they were, kissing the daylight out of each other.
“Yeah, Draco, wouldn’t want people to think you’ve changed” Pansy eyed him with a raise of her eyebrow, it was subtle. He shouldn’t let people know he wasn’t the Draco they knew, it’d just cause consequences later.
“I get it, sappy times” Pansy nodded, pulling Hermione’s hands to the dance floor “Come on, my darling”
“Enough with that, come on” Pansy raised her wine glass up and smiled proudly “To Hermione, who became the Minister for Magic today”
“Oh, more like an obsession, he has wanted to do Draco for years now, kissing Draco would be a dream for him, which might led to them actually shagging, all night, every night. Just some…hot, raw, animal sex, but that’s what I guess” Pansy exaggerated, she needed to be the boost so Harry could make the first move “So, you can either choose Celeste, or Draco.
“Well…he’s kind of-…”
The blond murmured a small “
“I’m not obsessed with him, mother”
“About whether Weasley has feelings for him or not. Isn’t it obvious?”
I just remember the funniest thing since you mentioned Luna, and now that I think about it, it’s pretty odd
“Oh” Potter let out a soft answer
“Could be” Theo answered hesitantly “I will consider it”
“Oh, okay” Pansy said and gestured Neville to go to her spot “Nev, come here, I’ll give you the bunnies” Theo stayed silent, staring at his clothing rack without moving, he clutched on the rack and let go, walking out of the room. Theo shut the door closed and walked a few steps before leaning on the wall, he hugged himself tightly, the tears on his eyes threatening to fall any second now. Just being anywhere near Neville
” He said, releasing his hands from Potter’s grip and cupped his face, he slipped his hands up and grasped his hair, pulling it a bit
“Are you blushing?” Potter asked him along with a chuckle when Draco turned around so the Gryffindor could do it privately “It’s okay, we’re both guys”
Draco got his legs off the bed, trying to think of traits Neville has that Theodore loved in that universe “You don’t want, nice, intelligent, kind guy? Who’s also brave? Who cares about plants and people?”
“Where are we going?”
“I told you I’m a worthy opponent” He said, leaning back on the chair and crossing his leg over the other “We can have a rematch some other time, if you want to”
you mighty Auror”
Draco exclaimed with anger, he has never been this angry before “Stop with the fucking stuttering. Make up your bloody mind!”
“Yeah?”
“We can’t conclude that yet, the best friend claimed to—…
Pansy had a
“Well, okay so” Pansy’s thoughts organised by itself in her mind, it took her seconds to come up with a plan “We will gather our close friends around Harry and Draco, so we can block anyone we don’t want to from approaching Harry!”
Ron immediately jumped back, his face even redder than before “
“Seems like you two are still very much in love with each other” Lilian said with her hand holding her cocktail glass, he somehow had told her everything that happened, but it was a way shorter version since they only got a few minutes to talk “I think Harry still wants you back, no matter what he shows, and you too, want him back as well, no matter what you tell others”
said “Are you okay? Were you attacked?”
Theodore said while hiccuping, he might have had too much to drink, Draco should have found him sooner, or maybe this was a sign “
die together”
” Draco raised his head, stayed up on his elbows and ogled at Harry “I can’t believe you hid that from me for 27 years. Well what are you waiting for?” Draco opened his legs wide in the bed, pointing at Harry’s cock and at his loosen entrance “
He looked at Harry, who was standing next to him with tears already wetting his cheeks. Draco cupped his face and wiped he tears off his cheeks, pressing a chaste kiss on his lips “I love you” He murmured, this was a big step for Harry, he knew that. And the fact that he had shown Draco where his parents stayed only proved how much Harry loved and cherished him, and he couldn’t love Harry more.
“Oh my god, what is that? Put that away!” Harry gaped when he saw a bunch of…
“Ron tricked me here” Harry said, chuckling a bit, and it only made Draco’s heart ached more. He missed the sound of that, he couldn’t bear it “Draco…look” He reached out his hand and was going to touch Draco’s but he retreated it quickly “I miss you…so much” Draco stared at him, the guy he was deeply in love with, was confessing to him again
You guys got a meeting later so we have to do this fast and effective”
serious” Blaise said, and some of the smoke flew out of his mouth “I have never been this serious, even I surprised myself”
“Oh, down already?” Hermione walked to their spot and smiled “That was fast”
Ron was nervous, he was sweating again, he sweats when he was nervous. And how so? Because he was going to pose with a dragon and Blaise will take pictures of him, Ron could barely function when he looked at him for too long, now he has to stay like that to do this photoshoot for Pansy. Pansy was a good friend, but she was crazy.
“You know, those hot firefighters’ calendar where they’re all half naked?” Pansy squealed, clasping her hands together “We’re going to make it like that, but well, with Aurors” Draco’s lips formed into a smirk, he
“Shush” He put a finger on Harry’s lips and got under the table
“Serves you right”
“Sorry” Harry grinned, ruffling his messy hair “What did you want to say?”
“Why? You could just say no” Harry asked, Draco has every right to decline Pansy’s offer. He knew Pansy and Draco disappeared a year after graduating from Hogwarts, but he never asked where they went off to, it just wasn’t his place to ask such questions.
?” The Auror gave him a half smirk and observed as Draco grabbed Harry’s cock and aligned himself just right above. Watching Draco going down on him was possibly the hottest thing he has seen all year. The light grimace on Draco’s face when the head of Harry’s cock was pushed in, the way his mouth formed into an ‘o’ shape, the way he looked at Harry with an alluring smile, he enjoyed teasing Harry.
“I told you not to give me gloves” Draco shook his head, appreciating the gesture but gloves won’t work on him “You know it doesn’t work, I have tried it”
“They’re playing with uncle Fred and George, they are going to prank uncle Percy and they won’t let me play” Draco smiled and hooked his arm around Harry’s while walking down with their daughter to get back to the party, or else the guests would wonder where the hosts of the party went
“I love him with all my heart” He said, without much time he already knew the answer, he loved Draco more than he could ever say, more than he could ever express. He didn’t know he was able to love a person this much, but when Draco came into his life, he felt blessed “He’s the first person to make me feel all sorts of things, I want to protect him, I want to be with him, I want to love him. I can’t imagine a day without him, without seeing his face, his smile, or his insults that I know he didn’t mean it” Harry smiled, fiddling with his hands, he loved Draco’s nagging and bickering, he knew that it was Draco’s way of showing him that he loved him
Robards for a few more days to finish the photoshoot, just to be sure. It was three days after the first shoot, three days after Harry manhandled him and three days since he avoided the certain Auror. And he was still avoiding him today, Harry was on the other side of the room, glancing at Draco a few times, as
“Yeah”
“Really, I told you, you’re his exception, might sound weird to you, but it’s true” Draco said, he saw the spark Blaise and Ron have at the other world, he wanted to see the same here as well “Do you want to know more?”
“But then?”
! Why are you messing it up?” She poked his chest repeatedly “Stop messing it up! You idiot! And I’m saying this because I’m your best friend, don’t
“I know, I want to look amazing for the whole day”
“Oh the Invisibility Cloak? Yeah, he has it” She nodded, Draco let out a long breath, he now realised a lot of things, and it was definitely surprising “You two used to hide under it as kids and sneaked out at night”
“Tutoring Weasley, what do you think?” He walked past Draco and settled down on a table “Do you know where he is?”
“You might want to think again” Draco said, chuckling as they both summoned their swimming trunks into their hands and put them back on before their friends got here, luckily they were also covered by a bunch of chairs near the shore so they wouldn’t be able to see that they were naked
“Of course” Ron handed Harry the notes and he started looking at it, only to realise he didn’t need it “Draco, I’ve proposed to you so many times, more than I could count, and I honestly can’t think of any other words than I love you, because I do, you are my home, my world, and my everything, you are the only person I want to be with every second of the day, I want to wake up with you and go to bed with you, I want to argue with you and I want to make up with you, I want us to laugh and cry together, I want us to grow old together, until we both have grey hairs and I’ll still think you’re beautiful and you’ll just think I’m teasing you, but I’m not. You’re always imperfectly perfect in my eyes, I don’t even care what others think, because I just want you, and I want to go through everything with you, for I cannot bear a second without you next to me”
“We don’t know that yet” Draco said calmly and continued “His best friend, who’s dating his former wife, Raife Willkinson”
“Oh, okay” Potter yawned, closing his mouth and stood up, extending his arm to Draco, waiting for him to take it “Oh, I forgot” He retreated it when Draco flinched, there was something heavy in his chest, as if someone was telling him he was hurting Potter by acting like this, Potter must have thought Draco would follow him like usual
“I want you to look at the mirror there, Draco” Harry said, pointing at the mirror in the middle of the room “It’s not the mirror you think”
“Maybe you should act” Draco jolted when Harry mumbled from behind him
day of his life, when he found out his boyfriend, or rather,
“Yeah, hey” Pansy spoke “Did you answer Draco’s call?”
“Brandon wants to use you”
“Alright, just, ask and spray?” He asked again, just to make sure. It was his first day at his first job ever anyway, he didn’t know where to work, but then Pansy introduced him to the fragrance stands that she also works in the mall, but at a different section. And then she helped him get in, now he was here, wearing a suit because Pansy told him to, and prepared to nail his job
“It takes everything in me to try and hold back from fucking you right now” Harry said, one of his hand moved up to grab Draco by his chin, turning him to face Harry
How could Draco have a boyfriend, they always spend time together, except for the times they were both at work
“Of course, I’m
“You better” She murmured “Don’t let me lock you guys in a room”
“Why are you here?”
“Yeah, that’s true” Harry said, and then it got awkward, it was complete silence again, it was like Harry didn’t even try to make a conversation at all, Draco rolled his eyes and turned away.
walk to Draco…somehow the blond felt relieved
five years ago and it started as a place only a few wizards come, throughout the years, the place was now crowded with people “See? Not a strip club”
the rest of his life with Harry.
Pansy rolled her eyes and wrapped her hand around Hermione’s shoulder “It’s not as if you don’t have feelings for him too?”
“Oh, er, I feel like I should explain everything to you” Harry began once Rose ran back to the kitchen with Ron, but he paused and picked up his fork
Draco watched as people began filling up the pub, wizards, witches coming to stand in lines while Pansy explained how this worked.
” He whimpered, clenching his hands on the table when Harry pushed his finger in, he arched up but Harry’s finger followed him, pushing up as well. Draco looked at the crowd, no one even noticed them, they were all caught up in their own business that they didn’t recognise the two people sitting in the corner of the pub about to have sex.
“N-no” Draco shook his head “You…do you drive a motorcycle?”
“Don’t be, it’s still good, I like it” Potter nudged him and Draco looked up at him “And if you don’t mind, I want to keep this as a gift too”
Ginny groaned, huffing softly so Madam Pince won’t shush them. Nimbus 3000 was the latest broom that came out just at the beginning of this month, Ginny would probably love to have it
“Oh, I totally forgot” He was so busy with matchmaking everyone, he forgot about the party they were about to have. But it wouldn’t be fun with just the Slytherin “But, can we invite other Houses too? House unity and such”
Pansy spun Draco around before he could finish his sentence and pushed him forward, the blond stumbled and almost fell on the ground. He turned around and glared at his best friend, who was sticking her tongue out at him, Draco took a deep breath and looked back at Potter, who was walking his way with Weasley and Granger by his side
“What are you doing?”
tell him he’s being irrational?”
“What?” Potter looked down and looked back at Draco “I think it looks fine. Why did you wear formal robes anyway?”
“No, what if I break a thousand year old vase, or I eat the wrong way, or I accidentally make some horrible jokes?” Harry said, he could see the panic in his eyes, but he was panicking just as much. He was even more worried about this than when he realised his blind date was Harry two years ago, luckily that went well, he hoped this would too.
“Absolutely” Potter said “Maybe to you, it’s ugly, but to me it’s adorable”
you didn’t mention he’s
” Harry cursed quietly “Will you marry me?”
“Yeah, I was surprised how fast Harry could take Draco’s robes off without getting mad and just rip it all off” Ginny said, clapping her hands together “Ten points to Harry”
“Draco Malfoy” He repeated the speech again, holding the ring in his hand, he couldn’t seem to find the right words no matter how many times he has done it “We’ve been together for so long, I know I’ve proposed to you more than I could ever count, so many times but every time I do it, I still feel the same way towards you, maybe even more than I ever thought I could” Harry groaned, there was no way to say it right, he shook his head and looked at the mirror “Draco Malfoy, will you marry me again?”
!” He shrieked and tied his robes up, covering his bare chest “I…what are you doing here?”
“Y-yeah” Potter answered, and they kept going.
One thing Draco has concluded was that the other Draco was much smarter than him, he found out things way faster somehow
“I will” Harry said, tightening his grip on Draco’s hand as a way to reassure him, and somehow, by some miracle perhaps, he did feel less anxious.
it” Pansy played along and laughed with him, and it was going well until they heard something break in the bedroom. Seemed like a lamp falling to the ground, from his own experience
“You see them?” He pointed at Hermione and Pansy, who were watching people behind the bar “That’s my friends, apparently I don’t go out enough so they’re making me suffer” He said, just when the door was opened to reveal someone he didn’t want to see, he choked on his own words, staring at Harry, who was walking in the pub like he was in a rush. This couldn’t be…He turned around and glared at Pansy, but she was sashaying to his table already
”Hey, sleeping so early?” Finnigan poked his head out when they got inside Potter’s dorm, Thomas was taking his socks off on the same bed “Guess it’ll only be the four of us tonight, Ron still seems to be studying and Merlin knows when will Neville come back”
“What’s your point?”
good of a kisser. He grabbed both of the Auror’s hands and rested them on his hips, allowing Potter to touch him as he wished, Draco wished Potter would do more anyway. As the Auror’s hands gripped tightly on his waist and started moving up under his short top, Draco hummed into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck when the man deepened the kiss. He could taste the beer from Potter’s kiss and felt the heat spreading everywhere on his body, Draco has come to a realisation,
“Alright” Harry froze there when Draco nodded and immediately plopped down on his lap, his hands locked around the Auror’s neck
he’s hard?”
“You’ve always love that bloody dragon” Draco smiled, his chest still heaving heavily as his hand has somehow found its way back to stroking Harry “I’m all stretched out,
“It is, obviously” He lied straight to Harry’s face and folded his arms together “It’s cracked when I found it just now. It must be why we can only see our reflections”
“Are you…”
Pansy shouted from across the room and pointed at him “
? Draco?
“Sorry, Han” He said, clutching on Potter’s arm when the man was still attacking his neck “We’ll go home”
” Harry called out loud, stopping Pansy from knocking the door to Draco’s flat, he ran to their spot and took the box back from Pansy’s hand, standing in front of the door to block the girls from entering, he breathed out heavily and shoved the box back in his pocket, he rested his hands on his knees and started calming his breathing
in the room?”
“Wait” Draco held the only key card in his hand and looked back at the girls “One room?”
“We’ll see them tomorrow, Lucius” Narcissa suddenly spoke and surprised all of them
now” She said with her eyes wide open, and she added as soon as she saw Draco’s shocked reaction “I
Draco whined, his head resting on his arm, luckily the rug on the stairs were preventing him from pain, but not totally, his elbows and knees would still gonna be sore by tomorrow if Harry actually insisted on doing it here
“Come on, let’s go to sleep” Draco turned around to walk away but Harry quickly held his wrist
” Blaise finally spoke after being nudged by Ron for the tenth time “Perhaps, you should wait a little more before you accept his offer”
“Just…you just clenched and moved” Harry grumbled, closing his eyes in distress. Draco widened his eyes and realized he has been clenching on his husband’s hard cock the whole time
told me—…”
“Er, only this?” He asked Theo and the guy just nodded “Are you sure?”
“Are you expecting someone else?” Harry teased
“I still have feelings for you,
“You’re all over Granger that you haven’t noticed at all”
“I don’t snore” He grumbled
“It’s just a spot” Ron replied when Hermione stopped him from sitting next to Draco,
“See? I told you not to get with him, he’s bad news” Draco sighed, ruffling Theodore’s brown hair as he looked at Neville, who was standing in the corner, talking with Luna and Padma “Maybe you should pick someone nice, kind, who’ll treasure you”
“I’m gay” He said, watching her reaction went from shock to straight up chuckling “What did I do wrong?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey” Draco leaned over, whispering into Harry’s ear, he got an idea in his mind “Ever think of doing any wild thing like that? Fucking in a public restroom like Blaise and Ron, or in the Ministry’s lift like Nev and Theo?”
“Know when it’s time to give up, Theo” He said to his reflection in the mirror, his hands clutching on the sink. When he noticed Neville skipped pub nights a few times a few months ago, he wondered why, and when he asked Pansy, she said Neville was with Hannah Abbott. That time, Theo got his first heartbreak. Abbott was Neville’s first love, they were an item for so long, then Abbott broke up with him, and
, she’s not that good”
“It’s a long story”
“Haley, hi, I’m Hermione” She shook Haley’s hand and sat back down again, Harry glanced at Draco and noticed the blond was gazing at Haley without blinking. Hermione nudged her wife and Pansy began “Where, er, where did you two meet?”
“We can do other things” He said “We haven’t got to do a lot of things here in Hogwarts”
“Sod off” He laughed “I will talk to him, tonight”
“I know, but Hermione says her friend is—…”
“You better” She said, her frown turning into a smile soon after “Still, I’m happy you two finally got together. But…get a room”
“So I might as well say this before I become a coward again, Draco, I, I like you, a lot. I have been, for years, maybe even before the night we fucked. And if you’re going to stay, I want to ask you out, but, er, if you’re not, then…I want to be with you every second until you leave again. I really want to, or else I’ll just regret it so much”
“Really?” Harry snickered at his tied hands, which Draco had done with his green tie while they kissed, the knot looked nice “This isn’t going to stop me”
“Excuse me?”
“Harry’s sex face,
to each other in front of each other at our wedding” Harry poured his heart out to Draco, hoping to hear a word from him, but the blond was still frozen on his spot “So, er, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you…be my husband one day? Are—are you crying?”
“There’s an emergency in St. Mungo’s, I have to be there” The blond gave Harry a peck on his lips before getting in the Floo “I’ll be back as soon as possible, you can sleep before me, Harry.
“He just can’t, he
that in you, because you put up a fight, I love a challenge” Harry said “Even when we’re best friends, we still have duels, Quidditch matches every week to test each other, I love bickering with you. Ask our friends, we still fight like crazy”
Draco beamed brightly, his eyes lightening up. He was still wearing his weekend pyjamas, black satin pyjamas and his hair in a ponytail “Strawberry? And chocolate?”
“I’m not your own private Healer” He said when Potter finally managed to utter out a sentence after scratching at his nape. It’s been more than two months that Potter kept visiting the hospital wing, Draco couldn’t believe someone would love damaging their own body so much like that “Why do you even go here for this scratch when you could have just healed it yourself?”
“Yeah” Draco said, his back leaning on the wall, this was just the perfect position to be cornered by Potter. He couldn’t deny the number of times he had dreamt about Potter pining him on the wall and ravishing him passionately, but this was only a kiss “Just a kiss, right? No big deal”
turned out Blaise and Weasley, you know,
“It’s someone I met at work”
“No, let them be” Pansy said while putting on more lipstick, she sighed and continued “It’s been a while, remember their fight just recently? And look at this, the bottle of wine had already been opened before we got here, these glasses are empty”
“Really?”
“Husband?” Hermione questioned him and sipped on her cocktail “Fifth-year anniversary?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Oh…oh that’s okay” Harry rubbed his face with his hand and sighed when he practically heard Draco’s voice broke, just a bit, only Harry could notice it “Work is important”
“With the help of Draco” Pansy added, Harry showed a soft smile, of course Draco knew what he liked, they used to have dinner every week before. Harry stepped back and headed to the loo, he needed to refresh himself, he hasn’t really sober up yet from yesterday’s party. Harry turned on the tap and splashed water on his face, nothing made a day better than seeing someone you love with someone else. Harry breathed out and looked at the mirror when the door to the loo opened.
“Based on your tone, I’m pretty sure you’re still not over him” Ron asked and hooked his arm around Harry, preparing to Apparate “I mean, understandable, I had sex with Blaise once and I could
” He muttered softly, biting back a moan when Potter jammed in hard “
” He smiled cheekily, feeling the head of Neville’s cock angling at his rim “Show me what you got” He said, and Neville pressed his lips on him, he took it graciously, biting on Neville’s lips teasingly
“Don’t make promises you can’t make, Potter” He leaned his head on Harry’s chest, hearing the Auror’s heartbeat, and he wasn’t sure why, but it made Draco calm
“I like this better” Harry looked down at him and smiled, showing his teeth, the blond bit his lips and nodded
“Are you alright?”
, married couple, we can’t lie to each other” Pansy put her arms up in defeat “What’s the harm anyway? She won’t tell”
She murmured in her ears as he memorised it.
“Oh my god, pub night?” Pansy exclaimed
“You didn’t do anything, did you?” Blaise startled him when he came up from behind Draco
“Ron told me about it, there’s nothing going on with Ginny and I” Harry chuckled, covering his mouth as if he was having the laugh of his life “She was just asking me some advice about Luna. She didn’t know what to do and how to confess to her”
“Ginny fainted right before New Year, Pansy. How do you expect us to kiss?” Draco huffed, tying his bathrobe up, all of them were worried about Ginny. Even Ron cried, but it was partly because he was already so pissed from drinking, the alcohol made him cry.
” from Draco
“What are you doing?” Draco asked when Harry was leaning over to him, his chin raised “Are you smelling me?”
“He asked me this morning” Theo beamed, he rarely see smiles like this on Theo’s face, Neville was the only one to ignite it “Right in my boutique, to be
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm, breezy indeed” Draco hummed at her, pulling Harry’s cock outside of his boxer and just started teasing it. He watched in amusement as Harry chugged all his beer in quickly, and slammed the glass down on the table a bit harder than usual, he was tense, he was afraid they’d get caught “Don’t you think so, Harry? Is it…breezy?”
“It’s fine” Granger said, grinning at both of them “It’s a normal thing to do when you’re in love”
carrying Draco for a while now, he was actually worried about the git. It was sunny and hot, it was May, Draco would have passed out on the filthy mud long ago if he was still walking by himself, he didn’t know how Potter do this
“A date”
” Pansy whispered from the table nearby and Rose nodded with a giggle
“Yeah, he’s the most caring person in the world, that was what I thought when I was there” Draco said, smiling without knowing. All his memories there came running back to him “I tried to keep myself away from him, but he still got to me”
“That bloke is trying to ask our Draco out” Pansy added before putting her sunglasses on, it was like she knew Potter was going to handle it once he was here
“Then what is in your hand?”
“What did you do to your arm? You fractured your shoulder”
“As you wish” Potter said and walked to the bar, and Draco might have sneaked a look at Potter’s back when he walked away
“Who says I don’t want to?” Harry grinned, his cock was already hard again, grinding against Draco’s half hard length. Draco couldn’t help but showed a smirk and he was soon attacked by Harry again with a kiss. Draco was supposed to be there for the meeting too. If it was three years ago, Kingsley would have a blast shouting at him, but now, he didn’t really care anymore, after all, he did get married to the Head Auror, who’d protect him with his life, who has been loving him for years now and who he loved most, yeah, he’s married to Harry Potter and he bloody loved it.
“Obviously” Draco mumbled, suddenly feeling shy “Anyone would be able to warm my hands if they held it” He scoffed, but that was a lie. Pansy had tested that theory out and her hands didn’t make Draco’s hands warm the way Potter did. Even Theo had joined the test just for fun and it still didn’t work. Draco didn’t intend on telling Potter that, not yet “You’re not special, Potter”
“Alright, moisturiser” Draco said quickly, reaching for the bottle in his makeup box, his eyes never locked with Harry’s. He squeezed some out into his hand and started rubbing it on Harry’s face, he managed to only look at the git’s lips, or forehead, but not his eyes
Pansy squeaked “
“Oh, alright”
” Harry mumbled quietly while putting another piece of bruschetta in his mouth, he remembered only some of it. There was a lot of drinking, Ron kept making him drink, Ginny threw up a lot, but after that he had no idea what had happened. He could only remember that the next morning, he woke up on Draco’s couch, and the first thing he saw was Draco making coffee in nothing but short black satin robes and it made Harry realised he had a hard on just from that but chose to believe it was just a morning wood that day “I did?”
“So it isn’t yours? Because Rose is holding one right now” Pansy said, and Harry could hear Hermione asking Rose about it now. Harry searched for the suit he wore last week and slipped his hand into the inside pocket…no box.
“I’m sorry, I was distracted.
“I think you are more exceptional than the salmon”
“So, did you confess?” Pansy nudged him and Draco glared at her
“Hold up, I’ll go with you” Pansy tugged on his shirt and followed him “You have bad taste. Hermione, call Ron, tell him we’re coming”
“Oh, that’s not it” Draco shook his head and sighed out loud “Look, I’m sorry I wasn’t being clear before. Ernie has a crush on Terrence Higgs. Since Terrence is a Slytherin, Ernie asked me for
“Well, next time, don’t talk about other topics while I’m talking” He looked away and out the files in his briefcase “I really hate it”
“This is not how you make it, how many—
“It’s not that easy, Pansy”
“I wasn’t sulking” He said, putting his bag on the chair and taking off his robes. Maybe he should find a way to apologise to Harry later, he sighed and sat down on his bed
“Oh, do you, er, do you still have feelings for that
tell him to stop sulking”
“What I’m trying to say is, let me try figuring out my feelings too” He sighed, leaning back and looked down at Potter. Perhaps, all those times he has been wondering about Potter was because he has feelings for him. Was Draco really that oblivious? Or was he just fooling himself? “How do you usually kiss someone you have feelings for, Potter? Show me”
“Hi” He said softly “I, er, there’s actually no way to say this”
The guy stood up, swaying in every move he made to get out of the booth and faced him, and that irritated Draco even more “How do I even know you’re really his boyfriend?”
that’s so wise” Pansy said, snuggling up against Hermione “Say something smart” Hermione just leaned closer to Pansy and spoke in the flirtiest voice ever
“What? So soon?
the round table would cover the most of it and hopefully, no one could catch them.
“Oh, absolutely” Potter stuttered and nudged his friend “Sorry”
“Come on, we got a married couple and three other couples waiting for us at the pub, we should go”
“What are you doing?”
“So, he didn’t agreed? Did he?” Ron asked eagerly when Pansy closed the door. Why would she close the door when she already handed him the mask?
better than Ron and Romilda” Parvati said, giggling with everyone. Draco stood there, avoiding Harry’s look, he couldn’t believe he did that, he kissed Harry indirectly like that,
“Granger? You still hate her, right?” He asked, just to be sure he was really back
“Er, I just thought it would be a nice touch. You don’t have to take it”
“I am not” Draco pouted and looked the other way
“Map?”
Draco looked at the person in front of him, a nice looking guy who was showing off all the things he achieved this year, including his partners in bed. Draco’s mind was somewhere else, someone else in particular. He knew why Pansy brought him here tonight, because he needed to solve this problem with Harry. The problem was him and his fear of losing Harry, his trust issues and his anxiety. But ever since he told his parents about it, and after a lot of talks with his friends, who shared stories of them and their partners, he felt better, and he realised, he missed Harry, so bloody much. He nodded, giving the guy in front of him a fake smile when the bell rang. Thank Merlin that was over, Draco fixed himself in his seat and froze when he realised Harry was walking to his table. Draco turned around to look at Pansy for help, but Hermione and her only gave him bright smiles and winks. They knew he’d have to talk to Harry eventually, they made this happen. Draco looked down and avoided his eyes when Harry settled down in front of him, he didn’t dare say a thing.
everyone and they kept making him drink, which he has to politely decline because getting drunk on his birthday was a mistake he’d never do
“Fine” Pansy groaned, elbowing his ribs and making a satisfied sound “Look who’s here, your
“At Molly’s, obviously, to be honest, Ron is still trying to get used to being away from her, he kinda cried earlier” Pansy replied to her wife and gaped when the door was opened, she slammed her hand on the bar, startling everyone “
“For Merlin’s sake” Neville said and hit the emergency stop button and the lift stopped abruptly
” He croaked “
brilliant kisser, for your information, it wasn’t just
“And it’s totally okay, I, I’m okay with it, totally okay, I still love you a lot” He confessed, it was true, it didn’t matter if he wasn’t Draco’s first time, what matters was Harry’d be his last, he might feel a bit possessive and jealous every time he thought about Brandon kissing Draco, but it just made him want to love Draco even more, to cherish and appreciate and fill Draco with love more, all in all, he just want to make Draco happy.
Draco recognised his own handwriting and quickly opened it himself to read
“Wow” Pansy hummed, looking at Granger, who was now joining Potter and Weasley, smacking them both on their arms and scolding them “I guess that’s understandable, they are friends for a long time”
being an unreasonable prick” Hermione rolled her eyes at her wife and turned to Draco “And Draco, why did you say yes?”
“Really?” It was a bizarre thing to find out. Mirror of Nightmare, Mirror of Desire? What the hell was this? “I didn’t know something like that could happen”
Draco stared at Hermione, who just quoted laws and Pansy who looked at her wife with heart eyes
“Don’t be so absurd, you make me want to vomit just hearing you suggest that”
Draco stuttered, what kind of sick place was he in? Did he faint and people set up some kind of prank on him? “
“I won’t be convinced until he tells me” He said, as much as he liked Potter, he didn’t want to be the one to say it first. Their friendship was new, and it was fragile, he didn’t want to ruin it. Potter might have just been friendly to him this whole time, he didn’t want to assume anything, he didn’t want to get hurt.
” Potter let out a laugh “See, the first time I was just messing with you, I
“Nothing” He heard Draco spoke and let out a soft sigh, they didn’t get caught. Ron pulled himself away from Blaise’s cock and turned around
” Draco cursed softly, of course he remembered, in Second Year when Harry talked to the snake when they were duelling, he always found it…interesting. Harry changed his position after Blaise asked him and let his arms down, the snake changing its position as well, gliding across his body and wrapped itself around Harry’s neck, pressing its face against Harry’s cheek. A small part of Draco wished he was the snake right now, he bit on his lips when he heard Harry whispering something to the snake.
“I thought…”
this party” Ron argued back and Harry sighed, he might as well give up. If he tried to do more, Pansy’d actually come and catch him herself, the woman could do everything without breaking a nail
drunk, I’m so sorry I let you down. So if I could make this day better for you, I would”
“It’s definitely the wife” Auror Goldstein said smugly, tugging on his collar “It’s always the spouse, or ex- spouse in this case”
“You are suddenly so obeying” Draco chuckled “If I had known, I’d have confessed long ag—
“Right” Pansy nodded knowingly. Draco groaned inside his mind, the mischievous cow was now married to
“Yeah, obviously, you’re one of my best mates too” Ron grinned, smacking Draco’s back and got back to his book
? Has

“I’m serious” Pansy held up the threat in her hand “Hermione got this
“Wait, this is…the Grimmauld Place?” He said, still being carried around by Potter “I remembered this, mother used to bring me here when I was a kid”
you’re bound to tell me that story sooner or later”
” He murmured and kept knocking until Pansy opened the door
“Well, Rose” Brandon said, leaning close, showing a friendly smile to the kid “Guess I’m Draco’s boyfriend now”
“I-…fine” Draco said and handed Potter what he made “If you laugh, I’ll kill you”
“Well, that’s a relief” Ron exhaled and looked at him “If he does something wrong, just tell me, I got your back, I’ll kick his arse if you want to”
“Didn’t you get married to Blaise Zabini?” Lucius asked him, his eyes squinting. Right, he totally forgot he got married to a guy who tried to buy him an island on their one year anniversary
is why” He opened his shirt, showing the scars on his chest, there were a lot of it, and it hasn’t even faded yet. Harry stared at his body, his mouth slightly opened, he was probably reminiscing that memory in the bathroom again “I wanted to at first, but I guess we’re even now,
“Well, he doesn’t tell us probably because you like to sneak in his place and steal his food”
“Really? You didn’t see this side of me comin—
am I too early?” Seamus sauntered to Draco’s table with a huge grin “I’m ready for my part”
“Am I?” He looked at her, the corner of his lips turned up as he nudged her arm “Think about it” Pansy was going out with this girl for a week, then suddenly she just broke it off with her. When Draco saw that girl, she has the appearance somewhat like Hermione, and Pansy never told him the reason she didn’t keep dating that girl, so he figured she might have started having feelings for Hermione, but she hasn’t figured it out herself.
“Alright, alright” Blaise chuckled, kissing Ron for real this time, the redhead opened his mouth when Blaise grind his hard on against Ron’s, giving him access to slid his tongue in, Ron could collapse from the excitement, he put his hands on Blaise’s neck, he didn’t intend to let the kiss go any second now, not yet. Ron’s hands moved on his own and started pulling Blaise’s belt off, unzipping his trousers while Blaise pushed off his trousers as well. He put Blaise’s hands on his arse, he had learned some wandless tricks from Pansy a few years ago when she said it’d be useful for him, it’s useful indeed.
“Yeah, I think so, what else do you want to know?”
that feels great”
Draco blushed, pushing the git away but their hands still locked tightly to each other. They walked past the Common Room and went up to their dorm, Draco bit his lower lip again, this Valentine’s Day had gone far better than he had ever imagined.
“Should we stop that?” Harry said from behind him, leaning his chin on Draco’s shoulder but the blond shook his head.
“How do you know that?”
“Yeah, I’m fine” The man finally answered “And you don’t need to call me ‘
“Oh, nothing. Draco kept saying the word ‘
“Oh, should I?”
. The blond leaned back on the chair, he grabbed a small pillow before crying louder when he realised the jerk
“Oh, here, I can apply it on myself” Ron grabbed it before Draco could and just started rubbing it on his chest, as if Draco didn’t notice how Blaise stopped taking pictures of Smith and glanced at Ron instead, he smirked to himself, Blaise was obviously and truly head over heels for Ron, it was not subtle at all.
“No, you didn’t” Potter laughed and stood up, before Draco knew it, he was running along the shore to get away from Potter, who was trying to catch him
“Well, it still felt like it was yesterday” He whispered to her, his voice almost sounded like it was broken already. It had happened three months ago, the day he and Harry broke up “Pansy,
Ron moaned, banging his head against the wall and he hissed in pain, both from Blaise pushing inside him and the pain on his forehead
“Maybe” Hermione mumbled to Pansy “It’s still Harry’s decision, we shouldn’t meddle”
“Okay” She held his hand and dragged him back in the room, he kept his eyes on the ground until Hermione led him to the chair next to hers “Sit down”
He was finally on his feet again as they kept walking “We…have never danced here”
Draco watched as Pansy kept following Hermione closely, wanting her attention. Maybe there was resemblances between the two worlds then, Draco smirked and once again, back at his thoughts. What should he do with Harry?
“I didn’t bring you here, Longbottom did”
“I will, I promise, just tell me”
, we can explain to them that they have to kiss one another!” Hermione grinned at her, showing her small dimples “You and me, Blaise and Ron, Ginny and Luna, Dean and Seamus, we’re all married couples, Neville and Theo just got together so they have to kiss, so that obviously leaves Harry and Draco together”
“Are you cold?”
“Gun?” Draco snickered at Theo’s metaphor “Seriously?”
“Hey” Draco jolted and saw Ron standing there, with a curious look on his face “Aren’t you blinded by the sun?”
Draco flipped another page over on his book, his eyes glancing at Blaise and Ron, who were studying at the table in front of him. It’s been an hour, normally Blaise’d get so angry he stopped talking to Pansy when she asked too many obvious questions. But Blaise hasn’t done it to Ron, so it was a good thing, since another week has passed, perhaps their relationship has evolved just a bit.
Draco gasped, looking at his boyfriend who he hasn’t seen for three months standing outside of his gate and waving his hand at him. The blond looked around the garden to see whether his parents were there or not, luckily no one was outside, they might be having breakfast right now. Draco quickly bolted out of the room and ran down for what felt like a million staircases until he reached the dining room where he poked his head in.
don’t! What the hell am I supposed to do?”
“Good?” Draco scoffed at Potter “I’m a
Hermione beamed at him along with Neville and Theo, who all squeezed him in a tight hug “Oh no, you’re skin and bones. Look at you, haven’t you been eating enough?”
!” Pansy yelled and encouraged Draco to throw it in, he grabbed the last thing his ex left here, his water bottle “
“And?”
“Wait, when do we have to wake up?”
“That’s all I can say” Potter chuckled “They are perfect in my eyes”
“Me? And him?”
“Yeah, every night” Potter said, and it felt like he was smiling when he said it, maybe he loved doing this. For the time being, Draco was clueless about many things, about what this world was, about how he’d go back to his world. However, the only thing he knew for sure was that Potter really loved him here. With trains of thoughts going through his mind and the warmth of Potter’s body next to him, Draco fell quickly to sleep, things could be handled tomorrow.
“As if” Draco huffed out a breath and focused on the lecture again, he could not care less about a guy whose hair was so messy, it blocked Draco’s view of the professor. Maybe Pansy was right, it wasn’t his business.
have to keep on living. Do you understand, Draco?”
“She’s just excited about the party, ignore her” Granger said, even when they were done with studying, she still has a book in her hands. Pansy would always joke around, asking Granger whether she loved books or Pansy more “Harry, are you visiting your mum and dad this summer?”
” before getting on Potter’s back, wrapping his arms around Potter’s neck and locking his legs around Potter’s waist, he has never been on anyone’s back before, so this definitely gave him a strange feeling, the good type of strange.
“Okay but what about me?” Ginny chugged on her beer and pouted, she wore a couple shirt with Luna today, she always wear it if there’s a celebration and they were going to get drunk, Ginny’s shirt said
, you have my word”
“I might as well be”
“Before you say anything, I want to tell you first” He turned around, closing the door and stopping Harry from stepping farther ahead “I’m not Draco”
these actors look like Draco, blond hair, slim body, I mean, you can imagine it’s him” Ron even clicked on one of the videos, and Harry could hear the loud moan of the actor already, but he didn’t feel anything from it, it just simply wasn’t Draco.
“Well, I
“Don’t pout” Harry held his chin up and kissed him, making Draco’s frown disappear and pulling his fingers out, the next second Draco was spun around, his hands resting on the walls as he felt Harry’s chest against his back “Ready?”
” He whispered and mewled when he felt Potter’s finger circling his rim, it was wet with lube already since Draco has secretly did it while sucking Potter off, he wasn’t going home without being fucked by Potter tonight.
“Maybe they’re really good together” Neville said, making Draco blush and look down “They just understand each other so well”
is this engraved?” Draco touched the inside of the ring and looked back at Harry “Did you…”
He has been friends with Draco for 7 years, enemies with Draco for 9 years, they have known each other for so long, they understood each other, so well that everywhere they went, people thought they were a real couple. And Harry could not believe he lost Draco just like that, to a guy that just wanted Draco because of his looks, because of sex. Draco was the most wonderful person he has ever known, his appearance is obvious but his mind was what Draco loved, Draco was brilliant, he knew every fact ever and Harry loved it whenever Draco told him about a random fact and they began discussing about it. Draco was kind, he might seem cold and distant but he was soft and warm inside, he needed affection and confirmation all the time, and Harry loved giving him it, he loved saying comforting words to Draco because he’d blush a little and that made Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Draco was funny, and Harry had to admit he missed those snarks and insults he knew Draco never meant, that it was just a cover up for his real emotions, Harry knew that, and he loved Draco anyway, he knew everything about Draco, and he loved Draco even more because of that. Harry sighed deeply, sipping on his tea and leaned back on the couch, he looked up at the ceiling and wondered what he could do to fix this mess.
“Shut up” Draco blushed, swatting his hands away “He won’t”
, you better be good at all of it then” Draco mumbled, leaning in at the same time as Harry and their lips met slowly. Draco closed his eyes, savouring this moment and blocking out all the noises from other students around them. He let his bag fall on the floor, locking his hands around Harry’s neck, his fingers running through the Gryffindor’s messy hair, and it felt soft in his hands. Draco hummed into the kiss, his voice eaten up by Harry’s tongue slipping in his mouth, his hands ran up along Draco’s back. When he touched the nape of his neck, the blond shivered, heat coursing through his body as he pressed harder against Harry’s body, he desired for more.
“Just, just listen, alright?” He mumbled and kept going “Three months ago, I saw the mirror for the first time, I saw us there too, apparently I’ve wanted you before I even realised, I was stunned and I tried to blow the mirror up” He said, pointing at the crack on the mirror “When I touched it, I woke up in another place, an alternate universe. Everyone was alive, even your parents” He said, watching Harry’s expression unfold “There was no war, everyone was happy. Everyone was together, Hermione and Pansy, Blaise and Ron, Ginny and Luna, even Neville and Theodore…and, us too” He looked away when he said the last two words “We were in love, we were a couple there. I was stuck there for more than a month, I was friends with everyone, I fell for you, well, not you, the other Harry Potter”
Harry? What the fuck?” He shouted “Am I
“It’s actually a lie, er, I like you, I love you, I think, no, I’m sure, I love you” Harry said without blinking, he felt like a weight has been lifted off of him, this secret that he has been holding for years was finally revealed “The person I love so much after living with him for so long. The person who laugh at my jokes and moan when he’s eating the food I make. The person who sings in the shower and put his hair up into a messy bun when he wakes up, which always,
sexual feelings for Draco, we know you love him, we also know you two are meant to be” Ron said, and Harry wanted to believe it “We think we might have a feeling Draco has the same type feelings for you”
“You two, honestly” He chuckled, Pansy was too deep in love with Hermione now. They have been together for six years, it started when Pansy became a stylist for Hermione, who was trying to become the Minister back then, they fell madly in love. He knew Hermione was the one for Pansy ever since she started talking about how perfect Hermione was, she hasn’t even stopped now. Draco created a big wedding for them five years ago and now they had a small boy who was about to turn four in a month, Hugh.
You look like you just saw a ghost, Draco” Hermione said, settling down next to Pansy in her backless navy-blue cocktail dress, and a tiara on her short wavy hair…
“That’s all you heard?” Pansy gawked at him and kicked his leg from under the table, making him gasp in pain “It’s none of your business”
“Well, I don’t remember anything at all” Potter replied with a smile on his face “Sorry I threw up on your boots back then”
“Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” Draco and Harry both turned around when they heard Pansy from behind, she was grinning at them, banging her fisted hands on the table, urging them to kiss
“It is” Draco sat back down on his chair and tilted Ron’s face to the side with his hand “Okay, you look nice now” He took the small hand mirror from the table and handed Ron
“Then why did Rose say she got it out of your pocket?”
“Go, hurry” Hermione waved her hand and Harry started walking after Draco suggested them going up. Even though it was awkward to have their friends seeing them half naked, it wasn’t really any surprise because Harry has already got used to their friends seeing them snogging before. After Harry’s 40
” She broke the hug off and cupped his face “You have been through just as much as us, and you’re still here. You
“Thank you, dad” He grinned as Harry took Draco’s hand in his again, drawing James’s attention to their locked hands “Why do you always hold dad’s hand?”
“Here, he was followed” The guy said to the other two people, Draco was still confused “Stay here” He told Draco and ran back with the redhead to the street Draco was just at
I know why you’re into Blaise now, a file full of…
“Er, sure”
you two have something for each other”
“Okay” Harry said, walking away to Ron’s spot. Draco let out a silent breath and made his way to where Theodore was standing, he needed a distraction.
“Well, he’s gay, he’s single, he’s now working at a book shop in Diagon Alley” Draco said, pursing his lips to think of more but he didn’t know Terrence that well. He only knew that Terrence owned a book shop because he has always been a soft one for books, Draco tilted his head to the side and smiled at Ernie “Would you like to know the address?” He asked, earning a nod from the Hufflepuff.
“That sounds like a really good plan” Draco laughed under his breath “But it really doesn’t matter where or when you do it, Harry” Draco said, walking to Harry’s spot and slipped the ring on Harry’s hand on his finger himself “I will say yes anyway, I’ll say yes every time you ask, as long as it’s you, and it’s us”
“Oh, yeah, it hurts when I touch it, and it’s hard for me to move” Potter said, and Draco didn’t dare look up again. He has a fractured shoulder, Draco was sure, but he didn’t know why.
“No, they’re not”
“I, er, I was on my broom” Potter explained as Draco took a look at the bruise again, it was already spreading all over his upper arm “I was flying, and I lost balance, I…fell”
“You know they won’t care” Harry kissed his forehead again in a reassuring way “If they have a problem with that, they’re going to have to go through me” Since they got together years ago, Harry always made a fuss about how the other Aurors treated him like shit, and made sure no one ever had the guts to do it again, Draco had told him he could handle it himself, but obviously Harry wouldn’t take no for an answer. Draco smiled and turned to his side, his finger drawing circles on his husband’s stomach, he looked up and rested his chin on Harry’s chest with an idea in his mind
” Draco snickered loudly “
!” Theo beamed and Draco crossed his arms over his chest, Theo was too crazy about Neville Longbottom these days, it was becoming weird of him, he could have any guy in this god damn world, they’d all kneel and beg him to have them, but he chose a guy that didn’t like him back, how sad.
“Your father had quite the attitude, so I’m waiting until he’s calm”
I’m crying” He pulled Harry up and hugged him tight, Harry buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck as soon as their bodies touched, he missed these hugs so much, he missed Draco’s smell, he always smelled so good, Harry loved hugging Draco, it was like he was embraced by everything good and nice in this world “
“What?” Draco shrieked, but Harry continued
Draco said, glaring back at Harry “I cannot believe you, Harry, you owe Brandon an apology”
Draco’s heartbeats sped up when Potter took a step forward, their clothed chests almost touched. Draco looked up at the pair of emerald eyes, the messy hair, the chapped lips, the sharp jawline that Draco just wanted to touch. He has wanted to do this for longer than he could imagine.
“I don’t regret cutting my hair, to be honest” Hermione touched her short hair and smiled to herself “I actually like it, it’s breezy”
“Kind of” He said, leaning close “Why? Did he tell you the story when he was a kid with a camera? Because he only does that to the people he trust”
Pansy said and Draco chuckled at her “
“I want you to keep it” Harry chuckled in his ear and knelt down to pulled Draco’s trousers up again, he spun the blond around and buttoned his trousers up for him before putting his own trousers back on. The firefighter leaned in and kissed Draco’s cheek, pulling a handkerchief from his inside pocket and cleaned the sweats on Draco’s forehead and then using it to clean his hands and the mess Draco made on the floor.
“When did you come back?”
“I swear to Merlin, Blaise-
“Alright, anyone has any idea what game to play?”
“You could never humiliate yourself” Harry said, but Draco didn’t reply, he just went and rubbed lotion all over Harry’s…fucking broad chest and muscular body and…strong arms. He has no problem putting lotion on other men but when it came to Harry, he just lost it
?” Draco gasped and smacked Potter’s arm “It was
“Okay…” She said, looking the other way before lifting her chin up a little “Thank you” She said, her voice was low but he could still hear every single word. Ginny quickly rushed out of the library and Draco stood there, he probably got her to soften up a bit now, he hoped.
“There” He said softly, his heart was beating hard the whole time
Pansy whined, clutching on Hermione’s arm and pleading her. It was a sight to see, he’s never seen Pansy whining to anyone before “I’ll sneak it in, no one will know”
“There is no ‘
“He did it
“Maybe” He said softly, looking down on his knees “But for you, not for the Potter in my world”
“Can I ask you out on a date then?” Harry asked, and Draco looked up, staring at Harry from the kitchen with surprise in his eyes.
“So, he said it was then he realised, he might have felt something in him, that wasn’t hatred, nor just feelings for friends for you” Hermione said calmly “That’s why he’s so awkward around you, trying to make small talks”
“Hermione, you have to help me” Draco looked up to see Harry clutching on Hermione’s robes but she only sighed at him
“Have you guys ordered?” He looked up and asked, this was the first time in weeks he looked at Draco in the eyes, since
” Ron admitted to Harry and grabbed the cup of beer when Blaise approached him “But you didn’t want to leave your office, so we used plan B, tying you up and bring you here”
“Well, he buys me stuff, like sweets, when we study” Ron said, looking everywhere except Draco’s eyes “He bought me a quill, he said because he gets annoyed every time I lost my quill. And Ginny said it’s a very expensive quill”
“Really?”
you hated Harry was because he rejected your friendship”
“Oh my
“Good choice” Draco chuckled, taking his off his cloak first, letting it fall on the ground and looking around the room “I don’t think I’ve ever been in your bedroom before, it’s—
“That’s obvious” Draco scoffed, looking at Ron, who was leaning on Blaise, he seemed wasted already “10 Galleons Ron will pass out before Ginny”
” Draco said in unison with the guys
“What are you doing?” Harry asked when he saw Ron clicking rapidly but not showing what he was looking for. Ron had learned how to use Muggle computers years ago, when Hermione and Harry tried to teach everyone of the gang how to get used to living like Muggles, just for fun. Neville was the quickest to learn it, Pansy was unfortunately the slowest, but she still tried just as hard as everyone else “Ron”
” Harry said, and Draco surprisingly obeyed. He started bouncing on Harry’s cock, slowly at first, so he could get used to the size inside him, but every time he sank down, he has to bit back on a moan. People were dancing after the loud music, but it didn’t mean he could moan as loud as he wanted
“I guess, it’s just tiring, that’s all, I could just have fun right now instead of joining this meeting with three other girls who hate me”
to me, they come to me”
“Great, Harry, look what you did” Weasley grumbled loudly and everyone got back to making potions. Potter was looking down now, it was unsettling.
“Fine” Draco squeezed some sunscreen from the bottle and applied it on himself, first he put it on his legs, so far it was his best features so he has to make sure his legs will be safe from the sun, he rubbed the cream from his toes up to his mid-thighs. He slid his hands under his short black swimming trunks to make sure if his trunks got ridden up, he’d still have legs with the same colour and not two different colours,
, who probably just
“There’s not much I can help, Rose” Harry confessed quietly, it was true. What could he possibly do now? “He’s with Brandon, and he likes Brandon, he doesn’t like me”
“What?” Draco stared at him, blinking a few times just to make sure he was hearing it right “I can’t keep it, it’s yours”
” He gathered more bubbles over to his place and heard another hitched breath from Harry, he must have accidentally clenched again “Pansy, just get out”
“I don’t think this is real” Harry murmured, making Draco laughed. He really wasn’t certain if this was real or just he was dreaming, Draco was right here, lying under him, urging Harry to do more, and that he liked Harry back too, it was simply too surreal for Harry to comprehend “You’re just…perfect. Have I told you how perfect you are? You are”
“Like? I don’t know, I’m just very confused” Theodore said when Draco asked him “On the other hand, Justin asked to go back with me again”
“Do you need more cocoa?” He asked as she shook her head, Draco shrugged the blanket off his shoulder and walked in the Burrow again. Everyone was outside and only Molly was still in the kitchen, baking something based on the smell.
“Yes,
need this party”
is it that bad?” The man said
“What?”
“Hey” Granger came to the table again, looking at the three of them “There are quite a lot of books, do you mind helping me? Oh, you don’t have to go, Draco. Just these two, they’re pretending to study like I know they are” She rolled her eyes,
“Yeah, Lov—I mean Luna insisted” Draco replied when Potter asked him after Blaise and Weasley had walked away “It’s fine, I think it’ll be a fun party anyway”
“Oh, plan A was to invite you back here
“I told you it didn’t work” Draco said, realising that Potter was still sitting half shirtless in the hospital wing, he pointed at the robes and looked away “Put your clothes back on, you’re fine now”
“Oh, you’re still awake?” Draco was startled when Potter asked him, he didn’t dare move “Y-yeah, I did, it’s better now”
Harry flinched when the bag on his head was pulled off, revealing a smiling Pansy in front of him, she was wearing a black glittery jumpsuit with an a cocktail in her hand “So you guys used plan B?”
“Yeah, but don’t worry, I’ll bring you one” Harry smiled and stepped back “So, see you tonight?”
“Of course” Draco said to Pansy as she sat down next to him. They were all studying for an upcoming test, which Draco has to study anyway, since he didn’t know how long he’d be stuck here “Why are you so late?”
“I really can’t”
did it,
“Yeah,
“Can I choose another?”
“Right, okay” Neville pushed Theo away and began stripping off his robes and his shirt inside
“Wreck me, Potter, as hard as you can” he said daringly and heard a small chuckle behind him before his trousers was opened under Harry’s hand, the Auror pushed it down Draco’s thighs, the blond supported himself by resting his elbow on the table, lifting himself a bit to feel Harry’s cock at his bare arse
“What’s going on with you?” he said, glancing at the girls every few minutes to make sure the violinist wasn’t a murderer with a knife hid in his violin or something like that, he looked back at Potter, who was avoiding his gaze, who continuously fiddled with his food instead of eating, and whose legs were shaking nonstop under the table, as if Draco didn’t feel it.
Pansy whispered
“I can answer that” Blaise raised his hand “I guess you know Slytherins, we don’t really like it when we’re wrong. And since Draco realised you were right and Brandon was an actual wanker like you said, he’s just too afraid to admit it, and scared that you might hate him now”
The little girl with long blonde hair came running to them both in her cute red swimming clothes with a small bucket and shovel on her hands “
“The words on it say I show not your face but your heart’s worst nightmare”
. Draco moaned into the kiss and one of Harry’s hand intertwined with Draco, squeezing it tightly while his other hand sneaked down and stroke Draco’s cock, the blond cried out in pleasure into the kiss and came, shooting everywhere on his trousers and the ground. He heard Harry letting out a low growl and shot up the hot fluids inside him, his body spasming, his hand was still holding Draco’s tightly.
“No regrets” Draco breathed out, he totally forgot to put clothes on since he was just taking a shower earlier “This way you can undress me quicker”
had happened to Ginny once, who arrived home after her honeymoon with Luna
“Maybe not” Harry said, kissing Draco’s shoulder blade and biting it at the same time “Maybe I’ll rip you apart”
go out of my way to talk to
“Are you bribing me?”
Draco suggested, since it wasn’t only them that Pansy sent gifts for, Blaise and Ron suffered the same things every year. Neville and Theo got fewer kinky things but it was only because they were into vanilla sex more, however on some special occasions, Pansy still surprised them with her presents, which were still used by them anyway.
“I think I will go back to the Mano—…” Draco jolted in surprise when he realised Potter’s hand was snaking in to hold his. He laced his own fingers with Draco’s, the sudden warmth made him tremble, it felt suddenly too nice “The…The Manor” He couldn’t believe he was the one stuttering now. He gulped and glanced at Potter, but the Gryffindor was looking at the window instead, yet his hand still held Draco’s tightly. He composed himself again and tried to stay calm “I will…visit my parents and wait for Madam Pomfrey. She said she would help me get a spot in St. Mungo’s. I will probably be a trainee there first, I don’t expect much at first anyway, wouldn’t want to get my hopes up too high”
So are the dreams better or…?” Harry asked with a smile, sucking on Draco’s neck as he jammed in. Just the fact that Draco dreamt about him too made his desire grew stronger. Their sweaty burning bodies rubbed against each other along with the sound of skin slapping on skin, the blond grind up to Harry, breathing rapidly.
more vague?”
“Of course” He replied, looking at Draco again “Er, so, I’m sorry for avoiding you all this time, I have a perfectly good reason for it”
“Look, Weasley, I want to apologise for everything I’ve done to you, I was a horrible person” He said, looking straight at her “After the war, I learned a lot of things, I realised I was a monster towards everyone, I was a coward”
“What?”
“I don’t have anyone to kiss though”
” She put the finger on his lips, laughing quietly with a glass of Firewhisky in her hand “Have you seen my girlfriend? Small, blonde hair, smell like flowers and the forest after it rains, oh and look incredibly beautiful?”
’ would be never, he’d never find a way to say yes again. He was friends with Draco since they were both twenty, both found it hard to bond at first, fighting and bickering all the time, but they managed anyway, magically. They have been friends for seven years since then, turned out seven years was just a right amount of time for Harry to realise he was in love with Draco,
” Draco couldn’t stop laughing, he embraced Harry with a hug and his boyfriend finally stopped faking to hug him back
fall for Blaise. And even though it took him months to deny it at first, he still had to realise the brutal fact, that he was in love with Blaise. And after half a year, Blaise started caring for him way more than a roommate, or a friend should, he had shown Ron multiple times that he was serious. But Ron didn’t let it happen that easily though, he wanted to make sure Blaise was faithful to him, so he temporarily put his feelings behind and tested Blaise’s feelings first.
“Oh yeah, but only a few times” He shrugged and looked around the huge house. He didn’t remember much, the furniture had changed, but the familiarity he had of the house was still there “Anyway, where were we?” He smirked, keeping his grip tightly when Harry carried him up the stairs. Draco stripped off his crop top and let it fall on the floor, shaking off his boots on the way as well, watching Harry gaped at him, his eyes glued on the blond’s chest “What?”
“Let’s go cool off” Pansy called them and took off her shirt in a second “Get this dirt and sweat off. Mione?”
Ron exclaimed loudly but then shut himself up after Madam Pince shushed him “No, I don’t get it at all”
“Er, I…”
a know-it-all. I could not handle her at all! I can’t imagine what her boyfriend would feel like
, it was all fine until his horse went crazy and that was when Draco fell off the horse, and since the place was crowded with Muggles, he couldn’t heal it there right away, he has to get back to his suite first
” He stared at Potter’s length, rising proudly “I need to have you now”
Draco murmured to himself while walking past the place he’s always come before. When the room showed itself, Draco opened it to get in. The room was empty as always, wide and dark, with the mirror standing in the middle of the room. When Draco got closer to it, he noticed there was still the same crack on the mirror, exactly like last time when he shot that Expulso spell to make it explode. There it was again, him and Harry together, holding hands. He felt horror the first time he saw it, but now, the aching in his heart was the only thing he felt.
"With proper education of our potion abilities and uses—"
"I certainly have never seen it," he dodged.
"It's been a pleasure," Draco nodded. "He is very intelligent and bright, and he has truly creative ideas."
Being a Sorcerian and a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, Draco by law had rights to cast three epistocracy votes a year. That was, of course, in Royal Court, where Muggles and magicians together ruled on issues. In the Sorcery Court, Draco had an outstanding seat and unlimited votes. For the first three years, he had actually enjoyed it. For the last seven, now, he had convenient academic trips, experiments, or emergencies whenever the Sorcery Court voted on anything more serious than the regulations of cauldrons.
"They wouldn't be so restrictive if the Muggles just let us handle it," Regulus gruffed.
Regulus smirked.
It felt like an eternity before he was able to pull himself away and go to the Floo hall where he Flooed to, no surprise, Malfoy Manor.
"This food smells delicious, as always," Draco tried.
"You, too… Regs" Draco said sincerely. "What has brought you out into the gardens?"
His mother was usually the first to host galas during the season, and she always did the bulk of the ones involving education. The Manor's Floo Hall opened down the corridor from their own gallery, which opened to a large ballroom with a terrace to the gardens. The ballroom itself was two floors, the first floor having a larger gallery and a very large balcony that overlooked the gardens. It was there that the food would be served, but plates full of hors d'oeuvres and drinks still dutifully floated around the ground floor where guests were beginning to settle in. The decorations were elegant with soft cream colours, and the muffled voices of conversation humming pleasantly off the marble floors.
when the continued debate whether or not Muggle laws kept the world safe from magicians came around. Particularly because he didn't have a good answer. "
He showed himself out, but it wasn't until he was around the corner and Apparting to his personal lab that he felt like he could breathe again.
Light magic was simply magic centred around construction, and Dark was a process of deconstruction.
Or, as Draco knew, the man whose closest circles called him Lord Voldemort.
Never mind that the cases passing through the courts these days were enough to make his stomach turn.
He was also, Draco knew, one of Sorcerian Riddle's close associates. While both Slytherin and Gryffindor parties publicly denied their respective radical groups, the Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix, and the public by and large believed them to be conspiracy rumours, Draco knew better. He knew because of his father's secret robes and a certain mark he wore on his skin. Regulus was highly regarded in almost every circle, but highest by far was within those closest to Riddle.
It takes a moment for Blaise’s request to register, and when it does it makes Draco blink and turn, disoriented.
“Is that why you were named Draco?” He asks, tapping the tattoo meaningfully.
Draco would hardly be doing any of that with students if he became a professor, would he? What a stupid thing for Harry to bring up.
Right.
Malfoy’s nothing like Voldemort.
“I… I meant what’s your plan for getting your Secret Santa gift,” he says, proud when his voice comes out sounding normal and watching as Draco takes a deep breath and regains his composure, glad he isn’t the only one. “That’s all.”
“Good morning darling.” She turns a page and then puts the book down on her lap, finger holding her place. “Or afternoon, really. Good thing it’s a Saturday because you look like shite.”
His eyes are red behind his glasses and his skin is flushed in odd places in a way that isn’t from the cold air, but the look in his eyes as he gazes up at Draco is something pure and warm.
He spins around to see Draco propping himself up on one arm in bed to look at him. His hair is a wreck, and his lips are swollen, but the expression on his face is one of surprised relief and Harry can’t help it.
“Alright then mate, just a glass of firewhiskey will be fine to start with, thanks.”
“Good!” Draco’s yell carries and a few workers in the hall turn to look at Harry as he storms away glowering and heads back to the stairs, pettily leaving Draco’s door open and not at all satisfied when he hears it close behind him with a slam.
"I hope you'll realize we need to keep what happened between ourselves, of course." Draco interrupts. "Can't have people finding out now, can we?" He winks at Potter, and then immediately berates himself.
He rolls his eyes at Harry but listens as he talks away, listing the homework he has to do. It’s not much. Reading a couple of pages for Sprout, a few more for Flitwick. Draco only has the essay to finish but he’ll sit with Harry while he works. Maybe he’ll read.
“Draco… I don’t know how to explain this, but I did not write this letter to you.”
Now his heart is racing from a combination of exhilaration and fear but Draco tells himself being nervous to get out of bed is ridiculous. Nothing happened last night that didn’t happen to the others. Blaise kissed Ginny, who is also in Gryffindor. Neville kissed Theo. Pansy and Millie had ended the night with a conversation including the other girls about how creepy Filch can be when he passes them in the corridors.
The Auror choked up on Draco’s alluring words, he sped up and hit just the right spot again. With a few more incoherent words, Draco was already coming untouched, spurting all over his belly, his body arched and his nails were still digging on Harry’s shoulders. As Draco’s entrance tightened, Harry felt his body spasming, his cock twitched and he buried his nose behind Draco’s ear, the scent of the blond after sex and his soothing voice were what Harry noticed when he came. Harry was drained, he pulled out and collapsed on the spot next to Draco, who was also trying to calm his breath.
“He could have just come here instead of sending a waitress, I don’t come to them, they come to me” Draco pushed the drink that man bought to the end of the table and sipped on his own cocktail “I hate lazy men”
“You can say it” Harry teased him, whispering in his ear “
“Oh no, you should drink something then. Do you want me to get you something from the bar-…”
“Can I put ribbons on my head?” Theodore asked, snickering next to Draco
It’s no wonder so many people are terrified of Harry Potter. Absently Draco wonders why he isn’t, why he never really has been, even the first day back this year.
He pauses, confused and wondering what they’re waiting for until a fire message flares up from the fire. Donna grabs it quickly.
? Isn’t there supposed to be a public declaration of love after I chase you outside in the rain?”
His hands are clammy on the porcelain and he wipes his palms hurriedly on his jean-clad thighs.
“Nice try but I’m not saying anything either.” Her expression turns disappointed. “But you’re not in the middle of anything. We’ll be fine.”
“Really?”
. Something of Harry that he can hold on to and take comfort from while waiting for all of these pieces of their life to settle in place.
“Good friends?”
“I’m glad.”
“I had a boring summer and had to read something to occupy myself. Subscriptions to magazines and newspapers were the easiest way to keep up with the outside world and I read quite a few interviews of yours.” Draco grins. “Don’t worry Ron, you sounded completely heroic in every single one. My particular favourite-”
“Look,” Draco gets down to crouch beside him and takes out his wand. With an easy movement suddenly the dragons all begin to move.
. She holds a tray with a steaming blue china teapot that is sitting beside three matching teacups, and some milk and sugar, along with a saucer of biscuits, which she sits delicately on the coffee table before turning to Narcissa.
She grins widely at him. “That’s brilliant, Harry.” Then she turns to Ron. “You could do the same, you know.”
“We can’t have you failing Potions, Potter. The Saviour should know better.” Draco rolls his eyes with more ease than he feels. “And I’ll be damned if I fail Muggle Studies. Looks like we’re stuck together, at least until school’s done.”
“Ah, but you haven’t snogged either of them senseless have you?”
Harry shrugs. “I got him one for his first birthday- not signed, obviously. But now with Ginny on the team…”
“And I understand. Or at least I think I do. But you say you loved me all that time while saying all of those things to me and- they way we
She leaves and he rifles through the mail. A newspaper, the newest copy of
Blaise looks like he disagrees. “You know I understand. Better than anybody maybe. My mum wasn’t happy to hear about Ginny.”
"You know Harry, it would be nice if you gave us all some credit." Her words are chastising but her face is all warmth and understanding. "Of
He’s not the best when it comes to relationships. His track record proves that. But what makes it worse this time is the fact that Draco is Draco and Harry is Harry, and four months ago this would have been impossible.
They stumble over to Draco’s bed and he has to groan at the sight of Harry laying back on his emerald covers, fulfilling a lot of recent daydreams he’s had. When Draco straddles him Harry lets out a sigh, relishing the contact of their clothes sliding against one another, their hard cocks grinding against each other through layers of clothing.
Draco’s eyes light up. “Gift?”
Their eyes meet, searching, desperately searching, and then Draco moves forward, tilting Harry’s head gently with his hands and kisses him again. Their lips move slow, just savoring one another, and Harry's tongue laps at Draco's lower lip, which opens. Smiling Harry doesn't hesitate, he presses firmly against Draco whose arms come to wrap around him and heave him closer.
“Of course it matters! You’re hurting yourself by keeping this- you and him, the real extent of your feelings- a secret if you care about him that much!”
Seconds pass in stunned silence before Harry looks back over at Draco who’s staring at the corporeal
“You should be certain that I personally chose both of you. Potter, I believe your work with
Who had also hated him all of last year and who Draco had avoided as much as possible.
Harry can’t stop looking at Draco who, if the number of times they make eye contact is an indication, is apparently having the same problem.
And then it is just them, two boys in their underwear, aching and filled with longing. Draco looks up, a few strands of his hair falling into his eyes, to meet Harry’s gaze.
Harry had
No, this is for him alone.
Potter beats him to speaking however when instead of commenting on the obvious tension that fills the room he just turns away, grabbing the bar of soap he’s brought in the stall and replying, “No. Not just Slytherin.”
She’d taught his parents at school, the thought strikes him suddenly. Taught Harry’s parents, and Severus. There is a certain calm Draco gets from him knowing that she’s been around that long.
“You shouldn’t joke about the war Draco.” Harry looks around before leaning forward a bit, lowering his voice so none of the many students nearby can hear him. “It’s bad taste.”
Harry laughs quietly.
charm before the last of his awareness drifts away into dreams.
“And what was that back there anyway?” Draco accuses, eyes seeking and holding Harry’s. “You’re just going around accepting blind dates from our friends now, is that it? Looking for a bit on the side, Potter?”
Draco’s excitement vanishes and he sits back against the sofa’s armrest. Any merriment he’d felt is gone now. “What? No. Why does that matter?”
“Draco,” Harry gasps.
“This isn’t right.” She murmurs, but her eyes are travelling the page quickly, taking in every word. She drops that letter, doesn’t even bother watching as it floats to the ground before she opens the other one, eyes widening at the sight of her own script.
Once he’s where Kingsley had told him to stop he glances around, and finds his gaze stopping on Draco who is staring at him in shock.
Draco closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, still half-supporting the other wizard, before shoving that aside and pushing his way through Harry’s door and into the entrance hall. He tries not to think about the fact that this is the first time he’s been in this house or that the portraits hanging on the walls are of his descendants. He doesn’t look around much, refusing to take it in because if he does it will be all that harder to leave, and it’s already hard enough as it is.
“Then let’s be happy.” Harry asks of him. “And we’ll see what else comes.”
Draco leans in closer, breath ghosting across Harry’s face. “Do you kiss all of your friends the way you kissed me tonight?”
The words ring out through the Great Hall and everyone is sitting and staring at Harry who’s looking at the pile of letters in front of him with a disgusted expression on his face.
Blaise is the worst, because he's not just pitying or concerned, he's
“The others?”
Harry opens his mouth but when Draco turns around to gather up his robes his courage falters and he does the same, slipping back into them quickly, unable to look at the other wizard.
“So what’s your plan?” Harry asks Draco after they greet Seamus and Dean who sit across from the two of them.
Her smile is wry. “Well done. Can’t let them get the upper hand.”
“Draco, Draco!” A photographer yells, yanking back his attention and he poses carefully. He stands with his award and then with Thelonius and the members of the Potions Committee, but as soon as his former mentor starts speaking he looks back towards where Harry had been, to make sure he hadn’t imagined him.
Somehow Ginny's are easier to bear.
Draco pulls back, finally meeting Harry’s eyes. He moves a bit, relishing the power that goes through him at this position, the way he can make Harry twitch and stutter with a simple jerk of his hips. “What? I’m not planning on taking your virtue, Potter.”
Draco looks like he is trying very hard to keep his voice neutral. “I realize that and I… apologize.” He looks down. “You saved me. Every time, somehow, you saved me. I never thanked you for that or said sorry for making it harder. So thank you. And I’m sorry.”
And though Harry suspects he knows, he still has to ask. “Okay. Erm, is this about the Slytherins?”
He’d had a
Pansy had only confessed to Draco she loved Blaise in Sixth Year, and even that had only been because he’d seen how miserable she was and demanded it out of her. Though she hadn’t known it at the time he’d been desperate for a distraction from the horrible things he had been doing (Katie’s face had hovered at the edges of his mind and Draco had felt like he was going mad from it). She had provided that for him, even if her problems had only ended up adding to his own worries.
Draco can’t speak.
Malfoy sneers. "Was I talking to you, Weasel?"
He pulls away after a long time, attempting a small smile. “Thank you for having me. I really did have a good time.”
“Don’t say that.” Harry pleads in a whisper. “Not if you don’t mean it.”
away.
Harry rolls back onto his side to meet his stare. He thinks about his next question before deciding to finally just ask it. “What was it like? Him staying there with you.”
“You could walk around in a box and I’d still be turned on by you” Harry laughed, touching their noses together, making Draco snicker with him “Have you
Harry groaned softly, leaning his face into the warmth “
Harry sprinted around the couch to take the opened computer back from Draco’s hands and hugged it tightly to his bare chest ”
“I-…maybe” Ron whispered quietly and sighed, Draco stood up to start fixing his hair with a comb while listening to the man rambling “I don’t know, it’s awkward, he’s notorious, I have a reputation to uphold. He says he likes me, but come on, is that a pickup line or what? How do I know it’s real?”
“You’re smoking” He pointed at Blaise
“I…I don’t know” Harry uttered, looking everywhere but Draco’s eyes. He reached out a hand to touch Harry’s arm to calm him down “Well, I just thought it would be nice, you know, for us to live together”
“Er, what do we have to do?” Harry asked, Draco finally glanced at him from head to toe, he was really late, there was even a leaf on his hair.
“Are you kidding? He bloody loves you” Weasley said, fiddling with his quill “Like a lot, you two are each other’s first love, and you’re special to him”
Why are we here, Hermione?” Ron asked when all the Aurors were all inside the room
“She barged in, Pansy” Draco argued, moving a bit and glaring back at his best friend “What am I supposed to do?”
“I have been in love with your son for four years, I spent a year trying to convince him that my feelings are true, that I won’t get bored of him. And I still haven’t, if anything, I feel like I could love him more after every day. He’s the one I want to build a family with, to…just be with him every day until we grow old. I want to put a ring on him, show the world that we’re together, that we’re a family” He said, and both of Draco’s parents gazed at him, observing him, he was nervous. Ron had to give him a talk before he went here, he was sure they’d say no, but Ron insisted they’d agree. Harry was a nervous wreck, he wanted to get married to Draco as soon as possible, he couldn’t wait to spend the rest of his life with Draco
before you like
“She…she thinks I could find something here” He mumbled, finding a way to resolve this apparently “And you?”
The way Potter’s tongue intertwined with his, exploring everything, his hands were on Draco, frantically touching everywhere just like Draco was discovering Potter’s body himself. Rough, firm body with one exceptionally hard part poking at Draco’s crotch, the blond gasped for air during the kiss when Potter’s cold hand slithered under his robes, untying it and let it fall on the ground, leaving Draco completely naked
“Don’t even” He grinned “I know it’s terrible, I can’t cook or bake or do simple things like this”
“You know how much I love seeing your face during sex” Harry looked down at him, smirking and entering Draco again, thrusting fast just like before. Draco had already came but Harry was turning him on again, with his huge arms on Draco’s thighs, putting the blond’s legs over his shoulder, Harry leaned down to kiss him. Eyes closed, mouth slightly opened, Draco invited Harry in gracefully, his arms locked around the Auror’s neck, his moans were continuously being swallowed by Harry
” Harry groaned, his head tilting up when Draco licked around the head, tasting the salty precome from the head, it didn’t taste bad, that was what he concluded. And just when Harry thought he had stopped, Draco swallowed the thing whole, making Harry cursed even more, his hand immediately came down to hold Draco’s nape. The blond hollowed his cheeks, bobbing his head back and forth, hearing Harry’s grunts every time the head of his cock touched the back of Draco’s throat, he looked up and met the Auror’s eyes.
“Really?”
will work out fine?”
“One thing at a time, Potter” Draco mumbled and Potter laughed. As soon as the Gryffindor left the hospital wing, Draco let out a breath and kept his eyes on the one that was walking away. It didn’t feel right, he wasn’t supposed to feel like this.
“Would it be appropriate?”
“You’re welcome, and the lotion…”
“Are you alright?” Hermione asked “Just a bit more and we’ll be there”
“Depends. How much do you like me?” Draco asked, biting on his lower lip
“Your mother was brilliant” Harry said and Draco could only nod at him, he felt the same way since he has never seen anything like that before.
“I might not…in my universe, I’m very mean, we fight all the time”
!” Pansy said, grinning when he glared at her, she was up to something again, not that he was surprised, but he just wanted to know what she was planning to do “Well, go to sleep then, I’ll see you tomorrow” Draco nodded and shut the Floo off, he stood up and walked to the kitchen, pulling out a kettle. Life after war, he had learned how to fend for himself and learned all the Muggle things that he could. With the help of Hermione and Pansy, who were glad that he wanted to try living life the Muggle way, not fully, but he has to admit, it was exciting to learn. Draco turned the stove on and started boiling the water, he needed some tea to stay awake and to work on some files he has been assigned with. Obviously all the other Aurors hated paperwork so he was made to finish it for them, it was alright, he could still take it, moreover, paperwork was not that bad.
everyone, based on the numbers you guys were given outside of the pub, that will be your seat” Pansy pointed at the tables and people started looking for their places to sit down, she nudged Draco and handed him a number “Come on, Draco, number three” She pointed to the table near them, where a blond girl was already sitting at
“Yeah, just checking in” Pansy hanged up the phone and put it back in the pocket of her pantsuit “She misses me”
He glared at the man above him “We are going to do this” He said, breathing out heavily “Give me a moment” He said and Potter went quiet, he leaned down and kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth, he moved and sucked on the blond’s lips, then sliding his tongue in again, Draco melted into the kiss but still flinched a bit when Potter started moving
Harry ruffled his own hair and groaned, he stared at Draco and softened up “I just…don’t like it”
“Yeah, and Draco mentioned you were one too?”
she had said, since he always walk home by himself alone late at night. She had warned him, Draco realised he should have listened to her, he should have known better.
okay, I get it” Harry nodded “Er, only if you wanted to, I can crash on your couch, if you let me”
Draco turned around and walked backwards when he couldn’t run anymore, he breathed out heavily and couldn’t stop laughing “Potter, please, I can’t ruin this outfit with water! It was an
“See what?”
” Harry whispered as Jamie’s mouth opened wide, mesmerised by it and he clutched on his lollipop tightly.
“It’s my fault, I gave you all those mixed signals, I just didn’t know how to act around you”
“Wow, Ron, you lost?” Harry suddenly spoke from behind Ron, Draco stared at him. He has been avoiding him for the past weeks, he couldn’t face him knowing he hasn’t been able to achieve what he wanted, and also because he didn’t know how to act around him anymore, it was chaotic “That’s like the first time ever”
“How? Like this?” He raised his hand and sprayed a bit in midair without looking
are we standing in front of the Ministry?” Draco glowered, he has been suspicious of all of this the whole time, but he didn’t know Pansy was going to trick him like this
He yelled out but Draco kept going
know about this? Did Potter
Harry said, making Draco shivered when he bit the sensitive spot on the blond’s ear, he rammed in slow but each thrust was deep, hitting Draco’s prostate every time
“Oh for the love of Merlin, Potter, compose yourself” Draco rolled his eyes and Potter stared at him, nodding slightly before stepping forward and closed the distant between them, making Draco leaned slightly backward, looking up at Potter “What are you doing?”
“Er, what…what did you and Ernie talk about?” Harry asked, Draco could see the slight frantic look in his eyes but he wasn’t sure why Harry was acting this way.
“Because two kids who get in detentions every few weeks aren’t enough for you?” He snickered, they’ve been called by the Headmistress many times, Scorpius was a nice kid, but he could also be persuaded into James’s little pranks and mischief.
Harry said, his low, husky voice made Draco shiver “
“Fine, you can stay” Draco sighed, he didn’t understand why he let Potter stay, there was something in him that couldn’t say no, because it seemed like they were alike “Don’t sit too close to me, and not one word”
hot? Draco wiped his mouth with his hand to check, no drool, he hasn’t gone
“I love you”
“Okay, we have a problem” Ron walked to the couch where Pansy and Hermione were sitting
” Draco said while breathing heavily, Harry pulled his fingers out and the blond climbed back down, sitting on Harry’s crotch again, his hair was sticking to his sweaty face. Harry supported himself up on his arm and wiped the sweat off Draco’s face, pushing his hair behind his ears and pulled the blond down for a chaste kiss
“Yeah, I also thought those two were in on helping too, like the four of you, from four Houses, right?” Theodore added another question, making Blaise smirked, surely he wasn’t smirking at someone he was reading, he knew as well “I’m just saying”
“Well, that’s 2 more” Pansy cocked her head to the side, leaning on Hermione’s shoulder “Take me home, darling”
agrees with her, just so you know” Hannah smirked, standing back on her feet and started mixing another drink when she noticed Draco’s glass has emptied “Your actions are obvious, I fail to see how both you and Harry manage to be crazily in love with each other but unable to see it yourselves. It’s weird, I tell you”
“Oh thank god” He said, murmuring to himself “I can’t believe I almost make a man blind today”
“Hey” Pansy turned around and waved at them “Wanna leave? Hermione and I want to prepare for dinner. Wear something casual, not robes, Draco”
“It’s a bonus”
“You don’t think I’d have an emergency on your birthday, right?” Harry leaned closer and kissed Draco’s lips, the girls walked to the crowd while Harry stepped to the side and intertwined their hands “Surprise?”
The door burst opened when the Weasley girl barged in with Lovegood behind her “You don’t know how long it took me and Luna to escape that sugar party there” She meant the Hufflepuff party, Draco could only assume that. The redhead pulled her girlfriend by her waist and they both squeezed into the long couch, making Potter sit closer to Draco, as if it wasn’t awkward enough already
were you…were you the blind date Blaise set me up with two years ago but didn’t show up?”
take Harry Potter to—to be your lawfully wedded husband?
“Here” Potter placed the cocktail down and Draco smirked happily
Harry exclaimed, shutting Ron up
“Are you sure?”
“How come you didn’t invite me?”
“Oh, well, I think so” Draco said, pouring the juice out into the cups “It’s Saturday night”
!” The door was barged open and the little girl ran in, making Draco froze right on the spot, with Harry still inside him “
“Vacation? We’re here to protect you two”
“No, come on” Draco stood up and put a hand on Harry’s broad chest “It’s for everyone else, now go, I’ll call the girls to keep me busy”
“I still don’t know why you did this”
“What? We’re not even kissing” Pansy squeaked when Theo gasped again
With Snape's antisocial lack-of-contribution, Regulus usual crypticness, and Bones' jovial willingness for whichever subject was brought up, the rest of the courses went smoothly, and Draco found himself remembering why some of these things could be enjoyable. The food had exotic themes while not being too adventurous, and the taste met his mother's usual demand for excellence. They finished with the dessert that was some kind of flaming pudding, the last of the palette cleansers being passed around as the pudding was reduced to embers.
He was in his private lab again, where he had spent the majority of his time the last two months to prevent anyone guessing his project nor his natural means of magic to accomplish it. He had been equipping it with more and more Muggle inventions with a few magical adjustments, and though he had noticed a small interference in some of his magical equipment, which meant eventually he would have to separate them, it wasn't enough to skew results. And they were simply a delight to use.
Theodore Nott and he had grown up together. Draco knew good and well that Nott would much rather throw the Goldsteins in Azkaban than to let them influence the Court. Or rather, some of the things the Court was being slowly manipulated to do. Draco never thought much about it growing up, but when he was old enough for his father to think he was ready to start learning the tricks of the trade, as it were, it became too clear just how easily the Court could be manipulated. The Muggles were definitely terrified of it, or rather simply of them. It was why they had a branch of government solely to focus on magic, a whole Ministry of Magic. It was to restrict the magical, but also to protect the non-magical.
"Yes," Nott agreed, "I heard you received another, ah… award? This makes what, five now?"
"No, not at all. If the court genuinely feels that is the best course of action, I, of course, will stand with them proudly."
Wadpey shifted nervously. He knew she knew he was joking, but Dobby was the only elf that seemed to know how to handle when he did.
When Draco was nineteen, he learned the truth about Dark and Light magic. That education came with a hefty amount of disillusionment that in turn made it all very anticlimactic.
"Unless the developers were Sorcerians."
“Nothing, I just can’t believe I’m in Draco Malfoy’s room, former enemy, current boyfriend” He said in a proud tone, he grazed his hand over the table, the curtains and the paintings “Draco Malfoy’s bedroom, where he studies and sleeps”
“Time’s up” Professor Slughorn stood up as the students gathered their belongings “Leave your cauldron and your grades will be up in a few days. Have a nice summer, everyone” Draco grabbed his bags and left first, only to be pulled back by Pansy
with her mind, unfortunately, he decided to ignore it
“Doesn’t this feel good?” Pansy hummed softly when they were lying lazily on those lounge chairs near the resort’s pool. It was sunny and no matter how much Pansy and Hermione nagged him to get tanned like them, he wouldn’t dare, his skin was too sensitive for this, and that led to him lying under a poolside umbrella to protect himself
“Oh, well, he
“I promise I will always make him happy”
“Oh yeah, but I resigned and became a chef” Ron nodded knowingly, his hand on Brandon’s back in a friendly manner “So, what’s your greatest achievement in life?”
“Ask Luna to make that shirt” Ron mumbled, his fingers fidgeting with the collar of Blaise’s white shirt “And cook for me every day”
you to be better for me” Theo snapped, pushing Neville away, he leaned his back on the wall of the lift and scowled at him “I like you because you are you, you are not like other men. All the men that were with me thought of me as a toy, an object they could show off, you…you were different, you appreciated me for who I am, you were the first to notice that I have a thing for Astronomy, you named a fucking star after my name for my birthday, that was when I know you were different, you just…you make me feel things I have never felt, I don’t need you to change or to be better, if I want to be with you, I don’t care about anything else. So
Draco is, but you have to either act on it, or try to hold it in”
invited “I…let me check my schedule first” He didn’t have a schedule, maybe wallowing in self-hatred and drinking until he passed out after midnight alone in his small apartment because no one could love him, that was his plan every weekend.
“Are you…mocking me?” Draco questioned. Was this funny for them?
” Harry mumbled, counting down with everyone else
“Will we be back in time?”
“No, I’m fine” Potter said, and Draco gave up, he was a stubborn git, he could not convince him. So he did the only thing he thought of, Draco moved his hand and wiped the sweats off Potter’s forehead and neck with the back of his hand
“Can I see it?”
“Excuse me?”
“I love it” Hermione smiled to Pansy and touched her necklace as they walked along the beach under the moonlight with Draco and Potter behind them, Potter was giving him the silent treatment, Draco knew it, and he wasn’t going to lose this game, he would play along, just like Potter wanted him to
“I’m not, shut up” He dismissed Pansy’s words when she chimed in. He’s always been like this, they were called arched enemies for a reason. Ruining Potter’s day was his favourite thing to do, seeing Potter’s annoyed face first thing in the morning was what made his entire day “Don’t you have somewhere to go?”
“Then how come you don’t see Harry’s feelings for you?” Hermione blurted out. Wait…
“I got a date, got to go!”
Draco realised he liked Potter since December. He had freaked out about it, and he was in denial for two months, thinking that could never be true, that they were just friends. As it turned out, the line between love and hate was thin, and the line was broken the moment Potter made him warm with no spell at all. Pansy was always there, convincing him that their feelings were mutual, that Potter liked him as well, but he couldn’t confirm it, not until Potter said it to his face.
” He whined softly, he made a mistake by waking up an inner beast inside Harry, he didn’t even know Harry could be this…hot and dominant, just when he thought he couldn’t fall for Harry any harder, he did.
” Draco moaned, arching his back and clutched on Harry’s arm
“Tell me why you left me out”
“I will do it slowly” Potter whispered and Draco nodded, letting the man kissed him again and started thrusting. It still hurts, he could feel the tears swelling up in his eyes, his nails scratching Potter’s shoulders, his heels digging into the Auror’s back, every time Potter thrusted up, he felt his body moving. Draco whimpered and relaxed a bit when he began to feel pleasure mixed with pain, the pain was still there, but it was subsiding
“Who is it? Let’s just call them!” Ron cheerfully suggested “This is great news”
He stroke faster, his thumb gliding over the head of Draco’s cock, spreading the precum all over. Draco arched his back and pulled Harry down with him, Harry slammed in his sensitive bundle of nerves repeatedly while his hand was pleasing Draco’s front.
Harry ogled at him, he would never understand, Draco sighed and looked down
“Fine” He grumbled and pushed her hands away “But I won’t be joining Potter’s party”
“I’m alright” Draco murmured between their kiss, and the deeper Harry was in, the harder it was for him to hold everything back and not come right there and then. Draco was impossibly tight and the way he wrapped himself around Harry, his entrance around Harry’s cock, his arms locked around Harry’s neck and his long legs enveloped Harry’s waist, Draco was a beautiful writhing mess under him.
his type that studied in the
“I…” Draco muttered, he really didn’t know what to do. On one hand, they had just met, on the other hand, he got little butterflies in his stomach every time Harry looked at him “Okay,
“Well you forced all of us to keep it as a secret so…” Hermione shrugged, she smacked Pansy gently and leaned back on her seat “Watch the opera”
, including barging in the Auror department, threatening to kill the Head Auror and blowing the whole Ministry up.
” Draco murmured, reaching for another kiss from Harry, moaning into their kiss when Harry pushed two more fingers in, scissoring the blond in a slow speed, he never wanted to hurt Draco while preparing him, Harry was always so careful in sex.
He heard everyone started yelling loudly, counting down to the big moment. Harry took leaned down and suddenly their bodies were touching each other “…
“Why don’t you just shut your mouth?”
“Even Millicent got married last October”
“Why?”
at rock bottom, Draco, the guy I like doesn’t like me”
“You got that look, it’s the same look Draco here has for Harry for the past five years” Pansy said, folding her arms across her chest “I’ve seen it a lot to know what it’s like. At first, when you were here, you didn’t have that look, but now, I can see it”
“I love it, thank you, Harry” Draco said and smiled at him, putting the ring on his finger
Ron said in realisation and pressed his lips together, his hands on his hips “
“Based on what
“Hey, where’s…Haley?” Hermione asked carefully when Harry got back to their table. He had got the ring back from her and told her to understand what was happening, that he had no feelings for her, it ended in a few tears from Haley but he had to let her go, she crossed the line.
He stopped himself and covered his mouth when both Harry and Ron stared at him with weird eyes.
“Well, it’s not my fault you guys had to argue in the restroom” Ron said
“We’re in Hawaii, I’m sure they won’t know we’re here”
“I, maybe not” He said and glanced at Potter quickly before looking back at the girls “I’m not feeling well and-…”
, I can actually
” She said, he looked down on the ground and stared at their shoes instead. It hurts too much to think about it again, he couldn’t bear it “But you have to keep going,
“But—…”
“Well don’t surprise me by following me when I’m walking alone in an empty street” Draco shrieked and helped Harry get up “It’s how we met”
turned out”
“Oh, is it the necklace I told you I loved?” He asked but Harry only kissed him again. When they took a trip to Italy two weeks ago, he had told Harry he liked a certain necklace when they walked by a jewellery store, so it could be that. Harry wasn’t good at surprising him at all, he’d always tell Draco accidentally first, so it must be that.
“What if someone comes in?” Ron pushed him back slightly, he half wanted it and half scared that people would come in
“I just really want to kiss you right now” Harry said, and Draco grinned before lunging at Harry. It felt like their friends exploded, there were squealing, shrieking and applaud, he was sure Pansy was the one screaming the loudest. As their lips touched, Draco remembered how shocked he felt that night, but this time, he didn’t taste the Firewhisky off Harry’s lips, they were both sober this time. Draco smiled into the kiss and was startled when Harry slipped his tongue in, there was no tongue last time. He hummed happily, he was on the top of the world right now, it felt like he was floating in the air, being embraced by Harry.
, Smith” Draco explained “I—…”
“Because uncle Harry is
“Just follow us” Luna said softly in his ear and he was led somewhere, he smelled perfumes and fresh flowers, but they didn’t stop walking. Not until he heard a door creaked opened and his blindfold was finally off and his hands were untied did he see everything. The huge white ballroom with a shining chandelier on the ceiling , the “
“He talks a lot during our lessons, but always about what we have to study. Once we’re done, it’s like someone put a Silencing Charm on him” Ron said, making his move as Draco smiled, he finally got Ron to share things to him, it was good
“I think they’re okay”
“No, but…you like marking me, don’t you?”
“Even if it’s my first time, Ginny, I know how sex works” Draco rolled his eyes, leaning on Harry’s shoulder “I’ve read…and watched, once I found Ron’s Muggle computer and I found a lot of movies”
“You weren’t, but you
“Yes, don’t worry, Draco. I know they will love you just like I do” Harry said, turning to Draco and pulled him in by his waist, his hand slowly slithering down to grab at Draco’s arse as he buried his nose in the blond’s neck.
so much?” Pansy asked, startling Draco “What?”
He shook his head, trying to pull himself together and looking at Draco’s eyes instead “Er, you, are you preparing to go to, er, your date?”
” Potter yelped when Draco smacked his shoulder with the gloves “Why did you hit me?”
“Yes, I heard it, Pansy” Draco smiled, noticing Pansy’s happy look. During Granger’s speech, Pansy was so enamoured and focused on it, he was sure it has made some impacts on her.
Draco walked in the meeting room quietly as some of the Aurors looked at him on his way in, they were already all there, waiting for him to talk about the newest case. He walked to the spot in front of the huge table and looked around, his eyes landing at Potter’s horrid hair today. Couldn’t he just comb his bloody hair for once? Not to mention, his robes needed ironing. The moment Potter looked back at him, Draco quickly looked away.
She whispered “Or I could just…I don’t know…go over there where Harry’s sitting…and tell him you had a wet dream about him!”
“No, no” Harry said into his ear “You can’t touch yourself until I tell you to, Draco” The blond whimpered quietly and put his hand back on the table as Harry pushed the third finger in, opening him up.
“I don’t believe you”
“Where’s Draco?” Ron looked around the living room and asked “I heard Pansy said tonight is the night”
Draco finally tear his eyes away from Harry and looked at Theo with wide eyes “
“I was not”
Draco bit his lower lip and looked around, but fortunately there was no one around. They were at a secluded beach, no one could come, it was on an island Blaise bought for Ron on their five year anniversary just years ago, and they let Harry and Draco celebrate their own anniversary here now, well, with a catch, of course “They’re at the Manor, you know!
“Brandon is bad news and he just wants to use you” Harry said, he’d never want Draco to be with someone bad, he wanted Draco to have the best, not the worst “He told me he wanted to have sex with you, and he will do it”
“You want wild, rough, raw sex right?”
“Are too” Hermione pouted at her wife
“How do I have love trouble if I don’t even have anyone, Pansy?” He chuckled softly at Pansy, it’s been…maybe a year or two since he was in any relationship, maybe even longer, he couldn’t remember, but he was alright with it, he could focus on being a good Healer instead
It has been an hour or more, Draco was looking at the night sky when the sound of someone walking towards the hospital wing drew his attention, he thought it was Poppy.
“Maybe each letter of Longbottom’s first name” Draco suggested, which only made Theodore try to hold himself back from laughing out loud. He should also be dressed up like Theodore, shouldn’t he?
“Is that a challenge?”
Draco could feel Harry putting his dorky red beanie hat on him instead, cupping his face and giving him a kiss on his lips “Draco, you know I love you, right?”
“Did you get the cream?”
“Should I give you what you want?” Harry pulled his fingers out and Draco felt like there was a huge void inside him
Draco started to freaked out when he realised what situation he was in, he let out a loud scream, kicking Potter immediately off the bed and got off on the other side
” Harry mumbled in his ear “I am very sober to know I like you”
“Fuck, we need to clean all of this” Draco put his legs down on the ground and pulled his trousers up, Draco moved to sit next to Harry and watched the Auror cleaned their mess with a wave of his hand. His hand fell down to lock with Harry’s again, and the Auror smiled at him
“Don’t tell me it’s Wolpert. Isn’t he straight?” Draco kept looking down, listing out more guys who have blond hair, insisting it was the one that Harry liked, meanwhile he forgot to mention his own name, there was definitely jealousy in Draco’s eyes, he knew it, it was like the time Pansy got close to Ron and Draco was jealous because he thought he’d lose his best friend, Harry could recognise it anywhere “
“I figured as much, Harry” Draco said, squeezing tighter and stepped forward, even closer than before “So why don’t you try asking me to be your boyfriend first? We can go on a few dates, after a few months, you can ask me to move in. How about that?”
“Er, no, there isn’t”
“Nah, I’m full” Potter shook his head and gave Draco another peeled shrimp “Plus, I can do this very fast”
“I don’t send back gifts” He claimed, putting the gloves back in the box and shrinking it down to put it in his pocket. He liked it, though he had told Potter not to do it, his efforts and what he had said touched Draco’s heart, he couldn’t give it back “Thank you” He said, smiling at him, he couldn’t help it. Draco’s eyes widened when something fell and landed on Potter’s red hat “Snow” He murmured, looking up as more snow were coming down under the night sky above them.
“Can I see it?” Harry silently pulled out the small black box in his inside pocket, he has been carrying the ring for months but since he started avoiding Draco, the box has been left in his drawer “Know why you suddenly brought this with you today?” Ron held the box in his hand, opening it and picked up the ring.
a pepper spray”
“Alright then, have a good night with your
“What did he say? When did this happen? How did it happen?”
“Don’t you even” He said without turning around “I have had enough of that. With you and the whole
” He gave the Auror a sad look before passing through the dancing crowd and strolled out of the pub, rubbing his wrist and holding back his angry tears, Draco managed to walk to the Apparition point and got home
“Oh, I’m Harry. I’m in apartment 3A, the one opposite to yours?” The guy said, putting the fire extinguisher on the ground and examined the bucket.
you?”
“I know” Rose pouted, leaving her stuffed dragon on the couch and ran to the table to sit down on a chair. As Harry placed the plates down on the table, he realised he has lost his chances with Draco, all of it, just because he was slower than another dude.
“Yeah”
“That’s…awful”
“You two are like kids” Blaise commented, lighting another cigarette up and started smoking
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry” Potter whispered quietly when Draco leaned closer to examine his arm. The blond was stunned and looked up at the Gryffindor, their eyes met and he felt like blushing. He knew why Potter said that, two words were enough to cover everything else. They weren’t supposed to feel this close, so why was Draco feeling warm all of a sudden like this? He cleared his throat and looked back at Potter’s swollen arm.
?” Draco spoke and Harry stared at him. Did he say something? “Did you just…did you just tell me you love me?
Harry put his fork and knife down on the table after he was done eating his entrée, he watched as Draco talked about his work, he loved watching Draco talked. It was nice catching up again, they talked a lot, like their friends weren’t even around. He missed the way Draco laughed, the way he hummed when the food was delicious, the way he kept pushing his hair behind his ear when he blushed, the way he blushed after Harry complimented him, he missed everything, he missed Draco.
“Alright”
“Headmistress McGonagall said—…”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, the mirror looked exactly the same “It’s the same, there’s even a sentence engraved in it, something…
“Oh, yeah” Draco replied “The salmon is exceptional” Harry’s legs began to shake, he felt so nervous still.
“Your point?” Harry chuckled, kissing Draco’s jawline and undid the blond’s trousers, letting it fall to the ground. Draco leaned back and yearned for more but Harry just knelt down behind him, Draco rested his elbows on the balcony and his mouth fell open when Harry pulled his arse apart
