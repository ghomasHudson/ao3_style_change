He twitched under the duvet, his mind half in sleep and half in all the things he’d been turning over like a stone, rubbing and rubbing ‘til all the rough edges were worn smooth. Al and Jamie at school, so no plan yet on how to divide the time; Lily happiest staying with her mum, for now; and all the hours he’d be on his own, truly alone in a way he’d never been.
In between bites, he said, “That’s what I mean, then. And, my darling wife,” she blushed, “You weren’t always so pleasant, yourself. So we were -”
And at every milestone he’d had a glass. That night, the betrothal. The bonding ceremony, elegant and sophisticated and passionless. An extra shot before he made love to her, and another glass when she fell pregnant.
Draco pulled Harry’s hips up further, leaned forward, pressed in. And it hurt, God how it hurt, but it seemed like the real hurt was somewhere else, in him, because after about five seconds he felt full and fantastic and fucking cared for and cradled and - and -
He had no idea. He felt in his pocket for muggle money and yes, of course, Hermione had snuck in a piece of notebook paper with a list of murals.
Harry leaned back against the bench, some of that morning lassitude still flowing through him. He relaxed into it, letting his legs fall open, and the side of his thigh lined up perfectly with the side of Draco’s.
The grenadine grew sickly sweet in his mouth. He ordered a shot of Jameson and loved the burn, like punishment, like cauterization, like a flaming brand of his sins and the way to forget them.
“Fuck, fucking Potter,” he picked up something else - a sterling silver candlestick - and threw it, relishing in the clang, “Why did I - how could he - fuck!”
And on that Friday night, when he danced with this man - so stunning, so damaged, just as hungry and broken as he was - Draco leaned over and said -
When he got back home - to the home that Gin was keeping, and he couldn’t call his, anymore - Ginny gave him a quiet, reproving look, and then fed him the dinner that she’d put under a stasis charm.
“You handled that well, Malfoy,” she plopped herself down in the chair across from him, “Thanks. I didn’t want to come out, given…” She gestured at her lack of appropriate attire.
Maybe he’d never left there. Maybe he carried that putrid decay in him. Maybe it came from him, rot arising from his very flesh.
“What?” Harry didn’t think of himself as much of a squawker, but that had not been a dignified noise. Hugo giggled.
“Oh no you fucking don’t,” Draco slammed his hand back over Harry’s, pressing him back against the window, “You’re going to come like this, untouched, just a hole for me to -”
“But Draco, darling - maybe you can - oh, I don’t believe I’m saying this - but maybe you can be happy, with him. Really, truly happy.”
And if Draco went back to the manor, alone, and imagined all of his clothes lined up next to Harry’s - their books on the same open shelves - their toothbrushes aligned, his on the right, Harry’s on the left -
“Did you think that going into the forest might be dangerous? And that it is, for that reason, forbidden?”
“But you’re not a hero, Potter, and I’m not going to be the victim of your mastubatory manipulations, not anymore. You can fuck right off for all I care.”
(Oh, and I’ve gotten an owl from Albus in which he emphatically expresses to me that your son is magic’s gift to wizardkind. You should probably get coffee with me if only to prepare for future playdates.)”
Harry, under him, thrust up, and he ground down, and they moved together there in the daylight. One of Harry’s hands came around and rubbed up against his prick; he pushed into it, chasing that moment, biting and sucking and worshipping that mouth.
Harry remembered, vaguely, a little blonde head next to his younger son’s unruly black hair. The memory, unprocessed at the time, hurt.
He was back in the manor by 11:30, undressed and under the covers by 11:35, and he still felt her hands on his face. He spread out, naked skin delighting in cerulean silk sheets, nestling himself in the middle of his down mattress.
“Well,” he lingered on the word, drawing it out, “I needed to get an ingredient from the Forbidden Forest.”
For a moment, he’d worried. And then the group of girls broke out into giggles, and the petite redhead yelled out, “You should meet my brother!” And all was well.
She backed up and held him by the shoulders, looking torn between hugging him again or shaking the hell out of him. Both of which he needed, it felt like. She straightened up, cleared her throat, and pasted on the smile that had made her one of the most successful estate agents in England.
“Yes, well,” he wiped blood on his shirt and felt around for his pack, “I’m a Malfoy. We do everything well.”
“Oh sure, you’re thinking, a year off, that’ll do the job,” and Aengus took a healthy swallow of stout, “But I’ll bet you have a plan for this year. Everything decided. Your planes, your hostels, down to when you’ll wash your pants, am I right?”
He was in their tiny kitchenette, fully nude, staring at the remains of Harry’s box of sugar - holes chewed straight through, and granules loose on the counter.
Draco pulled away, wiping his hand on Potter’s shirt, zipping himself back up. He pulled out his pack of cigarettes and tried not to notice his hand shaking as he lit one.
They did lines in the toilets - Thom rubbed up against him, “I could have you right now, God, you’re beautiful.”
“You said it yourself, mate,” Ron shrugged again, frowned, “I know you really do love her. Goddess knows you’re a great dad. I thought it would be enough, even if…”
“Ahh, Merlin - what the fuck, Harry -” Draco reached round and held Harry’s hair, “Are you absolutely mad?”
“Worried? Harry, I’ve been going spare. Not,” he must have made a horrible grimace, “Because of us, but yeah, because of the kids. But… you should have seen Al, last night. He was -”
She rolled her eyes in that very distinctive Pansy moue of distaste and then continued in her descent down the staircase.
Pansy was inside, “setting the mood,” as she called it - usually lighting some candles and baking biscuits so the cinnamon sugar smell filled the space, and casting cleaning charms on every surface.
He said it in such a disinterested tone, as if it could not have mattered less. But Harry knew him - knew the tells, the tiny movements, and Draco had always lied in the same way - with a twitch at the corner of his right eye.
Draco had needed a few hours away from the club - he hoped that Chambers wouldn’t now remind him of looking up at Potter from the cold concrete of the toilet floors. So he came here, to Art’s, Wednesday night with the band and the kids who seemed so much younger than he felt. A palate cleanser, like parsley sorbet between rich courses of duck fat and cream.
Harry had fucked up in many ways, but as he helped Lily into her pyjamas and let her choose a book for bedtime reading, he thought, yeah, I haven’t screwed up being a dad. His kids were happy. Back when Ginny first fell pregnant, he’d been gripped by terror. What if he was too - too broken, too filled with poison, too dead inside, to properly love a child? What if he was really like Petunia, harsh, cold; what if he’d learned hatred from Vernon?
Almost finished, then. The fire, constantly lit, snapped and popped behind him as he tried to pour a measure in his snifter - and then dumped out the whole thing.
“Yes, well,” she took a big gulp of the whiskey then stuck her tongue out and coughed, “Nasty. Look. As much as I don’t want a permanent Potter accessory in our glorious Slytherin family,” he laughed, “When he looks at you… It’s all on his face, alright? Everything. So bloody uncouth.”
But he couldn’t, he was noisy, he’d break from the kiss to beg him to touch him, for fucks sake, and Draco whispered in his ear,
They’d invited him over, yesterday, as they’d waved the kids off. He’d agreed, missing them terribly, but then…
Later, privately, he’d shouted at Kingsley, demanding an explanation. Kingsley replied, “We’re doing our best, Harry. And frankly, I'm surprised to hear that you care.”
“No, I know it sounds mental, but Hermione’s right,” great, Ron, too, “It took longer for me to figure it out - right about the time of the trials, for me - but I thought…”
“Which one?” At Draco’s confused look, he clarified, “Jamie is a menace to your face. Al’s a menace behind your back.”
Harry had never been anywhere or done anything. Well, he’d been to Scotland, of course, and he had killed Voldemort, which was probably more than other nineteen year old wizards had done. But that was just - that was the way his life went.
“Draco, I was a coward, and I did run away, and it -” just touching him like this, just being close, was so beautiful, like everything he’d ever wanted and everything he’d ever lost.
“Fuck no,” he leaned back against the stoop, looking up at the fading darkness, “What would I have to pass on? No.”
Later, Harry would run over that interaction in his mind, spinning it around, trying to figure out - anything. He’d imagine the contents of the room - the fire burning too hot, and gold leaf churned into grit on the floor, and the single drop of liquor that escaped Malfoy’s mouth and slid down onto his neck.
“Me too,” he put his arm along the back cushions, hand just centimetres from Draco’s neck, “Thanks again for the help.”
That was the sound Harry made. The heartbreak sound - the voice of everything, shattered. And the sound echoed in his chest, two pains perfectly in tune, this moment on the bench, on Lughnasa, the first harvest before the end of summer.
He growled low in his throat, closing his eyes against - against Potter, and his heat, and everything he’d ever wanted. And then he felt strong hands on his hips, and Potter pulled him tight against that unbelievably hard cock.
He nearly fell on his face trying to pull down the too-tight jeans, but when he wrapped his hand around his swollen, neglected prick, it took two swift pulls before he came, shuddering, imagining Malfoy’s filthy red mouth.
Gin was on assignment, somewhere - writing an article on the new experimental training routine of some team in Wales, maybe. He’d been a house Dad for the weekend - fine by him, more time to spend with Lil before…
So he came home. Back to the manor, which he had renovated and repaired. Back to bitching with Pansy over tea, and glasses of scotch with Blaise, and Greg owling him chocolates. Investing in his friends, his Slytherin family whom everyone still hated. Designing and perfecting the charms for magi-muggle charge cards at Gringotts. Making more money. Grinding, even now.
“I just,” he scooched back, sitting with his back against the headboard, “It feels like a lot of... baggage. History for us to live with.”
He’d done all the things you’re supposed to do, you know, when you’re facing down a lack of passion with your wife and considering that you might really, truly, after all that bother, be attracted to men. He knew he’d enjoyed the hell out of every fucking second with...
“From the look on your face, I almost believe you. But know,” the heel-clack noise, firmer this time, “If you do, I will come back here. And I will have no problem, whatsoever, ripping off your fucking testicles. Got it?”
And right before the doors opened, he smoothed his face out in that remote Malfoy stare, all traces of nervousness gone.
When Draco had decided to run the hell away from everything - from the stupid things he’d done, from his mother who always judged him despite her own unforgivable mistakes, from the burden and deep shame of visiting Father in Azkaban, the horrible wrecked manor and the curses he dodged in Diagon Alley - he hadn’t realized that his new life would involve… vermin.
He came. It was - acceptable. He kicked Thom out with a perfunctory “thanks.” He forgot his name five minutes later.
But there, in the beautiful apartment secured by the galleons which were his parents' and Sirius's legacy - there, wrapped up in a new kind of forever, Draco resting in Harry’s arms, finally uninjured - they loved each other with all of that history and the sorrow and the ecstasy borne of choices they’d had to make. They were happy, finally, and they didn’t take it for granted.
When he ran away from everything - from England, from his family, from green eyes and guilt and casual schoolboy violence - he ran far. He got his first shitty apartment in Cork, Ireland, and he tried to live on the razor edge of a knife, in the dangerous dance of his own self-destruction. He had a dodgy upstairs neighbor, Cathal, and windows which didn’t shut all the way, and the water wasn’t ever quite warm enough, but it was - it was his.
“I will never chase after you. I will never seek you out. If you want my time, you will work for it.”
Or she would have poisoned the biscuits. Which didn’t sound like the worst course of action, at the moment.
He was 19, and he was lost, so terribly alone, and the first thing he bought was a record player and a stack of LPs.
“I don’t think you are. I think you liked doing this to me, Potter,” he spat his name, then smirked, “I think you want me on my knees for you.”
Their eyes were locked. Potter tilted his head, a gesture, come here. Draco smirked, trying to find some sense of control, and shook his head, and crooked one finger.
Part of a pure-blood education was learning about and developing respect for their cultural holy days. His mother had always taken him out at winter solstice to light a candle against the dark; his father helped him pour mead for the Aos Si on Samhain. It was what it meant to be a wizard - tradition, the old ways, the power of the land - and it was what he was told he was fighting for when he took the mark.
But, at the moment, as he stared into the back seat of his magically upgraded VW Golf GTI and saw Al’s Hogwarts robes, he thought, fuck, that kid’s just as oblivious as I am.
He remembered staring at her picture in the paper - beautiful and ethereal in the engagement photo, in a canary-yellow sundress, Harry holding her, and he’d hated her with such bitterness that he thought he’d never recover, and he smoked a whole pack of cigarettes and ashed all over her perfect fucking face.
“I told you,” Draco nudged Harry, after Jamie’s music had been muted, “Living in luxury is the only way to live.”
Harry glanced at his watch. Just a few minutes more. He tensed his shoulders and shook his head and then thumped it down onto the table.
Ron and Hermione’s was exactly as he would have imagined if he had tried to picture it when they left school. Organized, beautiful, comfortable, and warm.
Playlist track: "I'd Love to Change the World" by Jetta, Matstubs. "I'd love to change the world/But I don't know what to do."
He couldn’t say anything, words and doubts and shame stuck in his chest. She patted his cheek and let him go.
Some of the eyes were more intense than others. The closely cropped hair on the back of his neck prickled, and he licked his lips, and he knew without needing to look that Harry Potter had come back.
Draco squinted up at him, his refined features going all pointy, like they had been when he was a little boy.
But great mother goddess above, now that he could live a life of luxury, he would do it to the hilt.
He lowered the zip, pushed the jeans down, glad he’d adequately conveyed to Harry that pants were a waste of time. He smelled so good, like dancing, like flying, like something both ancient and brand new.
Harry grabbed his hips and flipped them over, shoving Draco’s knees up, pushing against him, “So what?”
“Draco fucking Malfoy,” he paused - Draco had almost laughed, “I have loved you every single day of my life. I will go on loving you until death takes me a second time.
“Let’s not pretend,” she reached out her hand again, got his fingers to uncurl, “We did that for too long.”
Champagne ordered and delivered - and Draco did do very well, though he did shout into the phone, a bit - Harry ran a steaming hot bath.
There’s this feeling that he would get in his chest, sometimes, that he thought he must have been born with - some sort of inherent flaw, a curse, like a faltering heart. It was the feeling of Father putting down one of the hunting crups, a pup, for being born too small - the feeling when he’d had a nightmare and wet the bed and his mother told him he was too old to be comforted, and shamed him. A wrenching, like when Dobby didn’t come home, like when Pansy’d kissed him in fourth year, and he’d felt nothing, and that nothing ached with the life he thought he should have and now knew he never would.
Too many years ago, now, he and Harry had crowded around his tiny sink, brushing their teeth, worn out but keyed up as 19 year old kids usually are. They’d been out all night, and Draco was about five minutes away from being late to work, and he nudged Harry with little energy and said, “Why the fuck are you still up, you’ve got nowhere to be, go the fuck back to sleep.”
He thought that, defiant, and ignored the voice which mocked him - a voice that sounded too much like his father - saying that he was weak, that he could never resist Harry Potter. So the fuck what, he nearly shouted back, just let me, let me -
“Meet me in the stacks,” Draco whispers. “Section 550.” A movement and a rustle and Harry’s jacket slides off the back of his chair.
Pansy cracks her gum and drags a nail file across her thumbnail. “Ron tells me a certain stormy-eyed nerd was decked out in blue and gold team spirit this morning.”
“You’re no better,” Draco says, a reprimand gently delivered. He caresses into Harry’s hands a healing magic that scratches beneath Harry’s skin and it’s
Harry sniffs his pits and shrugs, standing to follow Ron into the front foyer. Ginny snags his pant leg with pinching, white-polished toes. “Tell me,” she says, eyebrows wagging. “Could it be a pointy blond prat?”
Ron drags his hand down his face. Lottie toasts Harry while Ginny snaps a photo using Harry's new Muggle cell phone. Thankfully, Hermione’s too busy snogging Theo to witness Harry’s stupidity.
Draco’s eyes dart up and Harry glances away. “Anyway, you can’t just walk around rock hard all day—”
“You made me do it!” Ron frowns. In addition to the icing on Ron’s jaw, a large smear cuts through his cinched eyebrow.
Gin, just as pretty as ever but twice as worn out, strapped Lily into her seatbelt. She looked at Harry - with a, that’s your kid, you numpty, glare - and he got the message. Grabbing the robes, he slid out of the car and handed over the keys.
Now, in the dazzling sunshine, he just breathed in Harry’s smell and Harry’s smile and Harry’s taste, and it was as fresh and ripe as golden apples from the tree.
His son was a good kid. And he had a Potter’s friendship without even really trying. Just by being himself.
“What? Harry…” he could practically hear her hair as she flipped it back, “No, though you could be a little… something.”
“Let go, Potter,” irate, immovable, his flesh like a stone, and then the cold veneer splintered and Draco closed his eyes, “Please, Harry.”
Stevie Wonder sang about falling in love and he tried, he really did, not to think about green eyes and black hair.
Harry was hot, through every cell, and his nails were cutting into his palms, and the anger let him pretend that his heart wasn’t breaking.
He was happy. Just, quietly, a little warmth in his chest. It was a new experience, them together, but watching Harry and feeling this way wasn’t new at all.
Draco was suddenly all business, as if this were a lunch with clients, and not drinking cold coffee with the walking human disaster he used to fuck in dark alleys.
It should have been cold, but it was fully furnished with thick rugs and plush couches, a real fireplace, open bookshelves with recessed lighting, everything seeming soft and cozy and perfect for long afternoons with endless hot cups of coffee.
He’d written a quick note at the beginning of the summer, obviously, just to let them know that his plans had changed, that he was exploring Ireland after all, but that he’d be back. He’d come home, after -
The corner of Hermione’s mouth curled up, the way it always did when Ron was about to say something uncharacteristically profound.
“Let’s stop there, shall we?” She shivered in disgust, “I am already struggling to keep this appalling whiskey down.
“While I do not doubt that all of your family is as much of a disaster as you are,” he came over, pulled out a barstool, perched on it ram-rod straight, “I am referring, of course, to your Slytherin progeny.”
“Good,” she began to walk towards his right, where he could just make out the ruins of a pretty blue and cream room, a lone chaise longue untouched by decay, “Do not make me regret sharing what little hospitality we have left to offer.”
He had no room, anymore, for hate. At least not for muggles, these wonderful, short-lived people he had come to love with all of his heart.
“Cocci is actually the plural of coccus,” Theo states. “It’s a term used in microbiology referring to any spherically shaped bacterium.”
“I’m lactose intolerant!” Percy sputters, red-faced. “And not the ice cream. This!” He twitches his hand at the half-naked models on the board. “The Minister for Magic reads our magazine. My
Draco unfolds himself from Harry’s lap and stands. Harry’s quite impressed at the level of dignity with which he smooths out the wrinkles from his unbuttoned dress shirt.
before the boom of thunder rattles his bones. The storm approaches quickly; the last gap had been five. He pulls up his hood, muscling a shiver into submission at the caress of soft cotton against his shorn scalp.
By the time the sun sets, the building has transformed the upper floor into a cotillion in preparation for the gala. Harry slumps in his chair, his magical core exhausted from casting multiple anti-conflagration spells and magically manipulating quills all day.
“That he’s wanted,” Harry says. His magic vibrates, stretching wide, exposing hopes and dreams to tumble forth, unfiltered. “That he has a chance. That he’s worthy of—”
He points the spoon at the blaze, now roaring. Yellow flames, so pale they’re nearly translucent, engulf the tree, consuming fat buds and withering delicate petals. Ochre smoke curls towards the fire alarm.
Harry is so distracted by soft fingers and tart magic, he doesn’t see Draco take his wand from his pocket.
Harry’s magic hiccoughs in his chest and pushes a tingle through his arms to his fingertips. The violet flame flickers to life again at the parchment’s corner. Harry’s alarmed sputter extinguishes it.
He had been slouched at the kitchen table, his curls a dark scattering of commas on the table around him, carving stripes into the label of an empty beer bottle with the shears, when the folded crane note had flitted through Grimmauld’s kitchen window.
Draco moans. He grabs onto Harry’s hair and clutches tightly, pressing back into Harry’s mouth. His back arches, a smooth slope Harry traces with trembling fingers while he suckles delicate skin. A wet hot stripe licked bollocks to tailbone buckles Draco’s legs. His knees bang into the chest. Picture frames topple. The fork clatters off the plate.
“Of course you can!” Harry slumps against the wall. The bricks dig into his shoulder blades. “You’re the best agent the Ministry’s seen since the First War.” He punches his hands into his hoodie pocket and finds a siege of paper cranes. He wads them in his fist. “You’re”—
And Harry does. That’s the blank unholy surprise of it all. How could he not with Draco looking at him as though he would carve out his own heart and present it to Harry on a platter. It’s a glimpse so subtle, so fleeting, so rare, Harry wonders if he’s imagined it. Late at night, in the small hours, as he lay thinking about a sharply dressed man with steel eyes and sweating through his sheets, he convinces himself that it’s true.
Ron catches the ball before it smacks him in the face. “Says you. Harry and I de-gnomed the garden before sunrise. Oi, mate!”
He takes the drink intended for Theo and scoots Pansy out of the way with a current of magic for a clear view of Harry embracing Ron. The movement pulls Harry’s jumper taut around his broad shoulders and back. A sliver of tanned skin peeks out as the hem hitches.
Harry frowns. He’d been warned by his superiors, cautious tales of undercover Aurors gone rogue, good men and women who got too involved, who couldn’t separate the job from reality.
.” Ron sits up. “Not many could thread that needle.” He looks at Harry with that same squinty thoughtfulness, and Harry’s skin again prickles alarmingly. Ron opens his mouth to speak, but Harry is spared by the gruff monotone of Assistant Principal Snape demanding students return to class.
A powerful, not altogether unfamiliar urge compels Harry, one he’s very rarely indulged. His magic crackles around him. The champagne glasses begin to rattle together.
Draco considers indulging the urge to run over, dive his fingers into Harry’s ridiculous hair and lick that smirk right off his stupidly handsome face. His pulse quickens at the thought.
A shiver cascades through Draco that Harry feels coiling through his own body. A gentle tug at silky strands pulls Draco’s head back. He offers his neck, a surrender given without hesitation. The necklace glints in the dim light.
Ron pulls an orange beanie crowned with a large pom over his buzz cut and groans into a shoulder sag. “It’s too late in the season for blackberries.”
spine unfolds a full bar out of the stacks. Draco steps behind the bartop and levitates the stopper on a crystal decanter.
“Sure, sure,” Ron says. “I’m curious, though. How does a first-place decathlete lock their keys in a running car?”
“How uncouth.” Draco grins and leans forward to pluck a gummy sweet from Harry’s bowl. His jacket gapes. Beneath the swinging chain, Harry catches a glimpse of rosy nipple. Three more mushrooms bloom into flowers.
“First course.” Harry hikes Draco’s shirttail and caresses firm cheeks, marveling at their perfect plumpness before parting them. He whispers a cleaning spell, his gentle breath eliciting a wave of goosebumps to cascade beneath the fine blond hair lightly dusting the flushed skin of Draco’s low back.
“Bold, though.” Draco uncaps a pen and doodles on the corner of his notepaper, five swipes of his Papermate.
Harry laughs and tugs Draco back into his lap. He buries his face in his neck, mind reeling with the tart leathery scent of him. “What say we ditch this Gala tonight? We can go to mine, have some wine.” He drags his lips over pink flushed skin. “Start a fire.”
Ginny tosses her magazine onto the coffee table. “Have fun?” She shifts her satisfied smirk from Harry and Draco to Ron’s flailings.
In retrospect, maybe too much. Harry’s 19th birthday, orchestrated by the Weasley brothers, can never be discussed—the Gryffindor lads all forged an Unbreakable Vow. A small rash blooms on Harry’s elbows if he even
“Something’s sprung for sure,” Harry growls. He grabs Draco’s hips and drags him into his lap, thumbs digging into sharp hipbones to grind him onto his half-hard erection. Draco’s groan stokes Harry’s magic, spreading warmth through his groin, plumping his cock further.
Without batting an eye, Draco sweeps off his cape, fanning the flames. He yanks the dragon cufflink from his French cuff and tosses it aside. “I thought”—he savagely rolls up his shirt sleeve revealing his arm completely covered wrist to elbow in brilliant floral tattoos—“we were past this.”
By the time Harry exits the building, the entire school is outside. Students gather on the lawn and in the senior parking lot, laughing and talking. A select few have spread out beneath an oak with their laptops and notebooks, working diligently. Harry’s not surprised to spy Hermione’s bushy hair amongst the group. She smiles and waves. Seated beside her, Draco pecks away on his laptop.
Even Draco’s hum is posh as he leans around Harry to inspect the cake. He smells so fucking good, Harry’s magic wobbles, as twitchy as the few crumpled butterflies still lurching over the cake.
At the sound of his name in Draco’s supercilious voice, Harry thrusts erratically into his fist, chasing the throb pulsing through him. He clutches Draco’s hip. His thumb finds the divot behind Draco’s hipbone and presses, urging Draco to slide deeper into his throat.
Harry swallows around his heart thrumming in his throat. He catches Draco’s wrist and sucks down his thumb, closing his lips around the knuckle. His tongue, coated with tart strawberry and sweet icing, presses against the muscle mounded at the base.
“I’ll just pop this down to Production on my way out,” he says, twiddling the paper in his fingers. He knocks back the final slug of whiskey. “Fitz is holding the curtain for me. A benefit of shagging a posh trust fund lad.”
“Blue and gold for loyalty,” Harry grimaces, crouching to pick up the contents of Draco’s backpack, willing himself to not pop a chubby here in the parking lot in front of his crush. His stiffening length nestles into his hip crease as he stands and hands Draco his notebooks.
Pansy and Hermione encroach on his view. Drinks and hors d'oeuvre plates trail suspended in the air behind them.
Peeking out from Draco’s open collar, Harry spies a love bite as berry pink as the juice dotting his skin. “You didn’t heal it.”
, I had nothing to do with the alarm!” Harry’s raised voice attracts the attention of students nearby. He hisses, “And we didn’t kiss!
He’s collecting paper towels to dry his hands and clean up the evidence of his climax when he hears it—a
Draco chuckles. “Good. We can’t have you looking like a naked mole rat when we debrief Robards tomorrow, now can we?”
He finds Pansy perched on the high ledge surrounding the statue of Hedwig, Hogwarts High’s owl mascot. Ron has draped himself against Pansy’s legs and is tossing around her cheerleading poms.
Harry deeply inhales Draco’s scent, a mixture of ambrosial cologne, tart black currant, and rich leather. The blend makes Harry light-headed, and each breath fans the embers of his magic. Warmth eddies in his fingerprints. He distracts himself with Draco’s written words, picking out phrases at random.
Draco hums, half listening and half watching Harry laugh and carry on with Ron. Harry runs his hand up into his hair and sneaks a peek at Draco over that beautifully bunched bicep.
” The orange penis-shaped balloon strapped around her waist flops around her groin. Ginny stands behind her clutching her sides. A large blue balloon-vulva hat slides over her face as she laughs.
Harry glances around the room. His eyes skim over Draco and then dart back to linger. Draco’s heart leaps up into his throat and thrums against the cold links of his sterling choker—the same choker Harry has admired. From afar, yes, but more recently, up close and personal at Hermione and Theo’s engagement party last week. But Draco wore the jewelry because it suits his ensemble, and
Harry crawls his fingers underneath Draco’s shirt, a pithy remark poised on tip of his tongue, only to stall when he caresses not smooth skin, but delicate lace.
—asleep in Coach Binns world history class. This nightmare is real. Harry Potter—Hogwarts High All-American Varsity quarterback and homecoming king—now exists in a world where his ultimate crush has seen him flog his log in the bathroom at school.
Draco exhales forcefully, nostrils flaring, his magic a steel tuning fork vibrating the air with indignation. He’s a little scary and a lot sexy, and on Harry’s desk the gloves, unsurprisingly, catch fire. Flames flicker, silver like liquid mercury.
Harry’s phone pings, validating Draco’s comment. Draco peeks at Harry’s notification. “Another proposition for the elusive bathroom masturbator.”
reads our magazine, for Merlin’s… sake… !” Percy’s voice trails off as Luna waltzes him out the door.
“Bollocks,” Draco mutters, and Harry couldn’t agree more, because fuck, he could drown in Draco’s mouth all day.
Harry finds Draco leaning against the shelves, casually leafing through a technical book about how to polish rocks and minerals.
Ron howls into his fist. He tugs and pulls Harry’s arm, jostling him against the car door. “Dude, oh my
It’s a default habit of his to revert to surnames; a subconscious thing Draco does when they are all together. Harry likes it. A lot. There are so many salacious scenarios in which surnames would be appropriate. Such as ordering Harry to his knees and commanding Harry’s mouth on Draco’s
Draco walks the hall like a runway, all long legs and smooth gait. He’s fucking gorgeous in tight pinstripe pants, and Harry decides that his button-up should be illegal. The lace offers an occasional glimpse of petal pink nipples.
Ron watches his sister pursue Luna, a pensive pinch to his face. Pansy scratches his scalp. “I can feel the wheels cranking in there.”
“Arthur’s favorite hawberry wine, of course, as requested. And a goose for Michaelmas Dinner and various trimmings.” He leans in conspiratorially. “I shot the game myself.”
Magic swirls around them, a cacophony of blues and golds, Levitating the items littering the top of the chest and the dirty clothes strewn about the room.
“I’m prepared.” Harry slips the hanger into the door. “I have an excellent tutor.” He grins at Draco’s eye roll and snags the lock’s innards. “Besides, McG likes me.”
Draco’s maniacal laugh explodes from the den, and Harry tries not to look, he really does. But how can he resist when Draco’s head tilts back like that to elongate his sinuous neck? When his Adam's apple slides smoothly under nearly-translucent skin with each chuckle? Harry sucks his drink through his straw until air gurgles around the ice.
Draco nuzzles his nose against the stubble shadowing Harry’s jaw. “Spring lace,” he says. He bites his lip and unbuttons his shirt, revealing lace, lace, and more lace, in an agonising striptease.
Harry succumbs. The last thing he hears before fleeing the kitchen is Ron and Ginny say in unison, “
mother reads our magazine,” Harry says to Draco. He picks up the spoon and carves a valley into the ice cream. It tastes like Draco’s magic—cool and sweet.
Another hex pops nearby and fizzles out in the crisp autumn air. Draco bursts out laughing and, glancing over his shoulder, extends his arm to offer Harry his hand.
“Come back to me.” Draco sucks Harry’s earlobe between his teeth, each pull of soft lips spreading the muscles in Harry’s groin, each suck of hot tongue a throb through Harry’s cock.
“So Devon is stuck waiting?” Satisfaction warms Harry’s bones. He doesn’t feel bad about it, not really.
Draco strides in dressed for the party in a raw silk bespoke tuxedo in the exact dovetail grey colour as his eyes. A mink-lined cape billows around him as he marches to Harry’s desk, pointy chin stuck out above a large bow offset at his shoulder. The irritated pinch of his mouth hollows his cheeks, sharpening the cut of his cheekbones. He’s stunning, and Harry burns.
A push away from the door and Draco approaches, a small pretentious smile gracing his face. His magic expands, soothing and minty cool, and the plate Levitates in front of Harry. A wand tap and a whispered
His bare arse slaps against the bureau, tapping out a steady beat as he pushes into Harry’s mouth, and Harry pushes into his hand over and over.
With a glance up into hooded eyes blown wide, Harry circles Draco’s cock with his thumb and forefinger and takes Draco into his mouth. His tongue maps the weeping slit, the ridge of Draco’s cockhead, the bulging vein running along the underside. Damp hair at the base presses against his palm.
, he hopes he put on deodorant. “I mean, cock is brilliant, too. I’ve nothing against cock. I’ve got a cock on my… head,” he finishes lamely.
Draco twirls Luna into Percy’s stumbling embrace and settles, smiling and breathless, into a chair beside Harry. The chain links rattle against his heaving chest. Up close, Draco’s skin glows. Harry’s magic flicks renewed warmth at his tailbone.
Lottie gives Harry a royal wave. Above the balloon bollocks nestled against her forehead, her hat’s penis quivers toward the heavens. Ron kisses her dimpled cheek, grinning like a loon, the lucky bastard. They’re entirely too cute, and Harry is entirely too single to have to witness this loving display.
He wanted to sweat it all out, all the alcohol and all the pain, and then he wanted to drink it up again and vomit it up at sunrise.
Long, thin scars traveled from the dip of his right hip to the inner edge of his left clavicle. They’d long since healed, but Harry could tell that the scars would never go away. Draco would bear Harry’s mark as long as he bore the other on his arm.
He was scraped clean, hollowed out, and maybe he hadn’t breathed, enough, during all that, because he felt dizzy and sick. But while he was making an utter embarrassing arse of himself, Draco had turned, wound his fingers through Harry’s hair, met his wet eyes with grey irises like a storm, clearing.
He’d retired to his father’s - his, for these sixteen years - study. The black curtains over Lucius’s portrait were spelled shut, as usual, and his crystal snifter was waiting to be filled from a decanter of firewhiskey.
He turned, setting down his glass again, and climbed on top of Draco, water sloshing over to the floor. He ran his hand over his neck, over the firm planes of Draco’s chest, his tight pink nipples, down over his stomach, gripping onto his cock.
“But I want to, Draco,” he placed his cup down, pulse racing, and turned, tucking his leg under, staring, “I want you, God, how I -”
Hidden behind a mouldy grimoire, on the bottom ledge of a built-in bookshelf, was a bottle of Black Bushmills. He moved the book, took up the bottle, and assessed the two inches remaining.
The shirt wasn’t much better. He could see, as he stared in the mirror, the muscles he’d put on while rebuilding Hogwarts. He wasn’t - it wasn’t obscene, or anything, but he was a lot more fit than he had been after so many years with the Dursleys, or after camping in the woods and eating whatever scraps they had left.
“Yes, sir. But, Mr. Malfoy, if you want to speak to my mum, she’s probably already here,” he gestured towards Longbottom, who’d had his face in his hands since Al appeared, “In the headmaster’s quarters.”
And he should have known better than to kiss Harry after almost a month of fucking and drinking and laughing and - kissing made it real. And on Lughnasa, when marriages were once made, a year and a day to see if it would work, if love could grow, if passion might stay.
Harry nodded his goodbye, watching Scorpius walk away with a bag full of books and a head full of music and he thought about another boy, and what his life should have been, and wouldn’t it have been better, you know, if he’d shaken his stupid hand.
It was by its very nature a magical time, one of those in-between times, the wheel of the year turning, the first harvest, the invitation. And he’d been sitting there, smoking as usual, with Harry there next to him, and the river running, and he’d been thinking about the lessons he’d been taught, and Harry put his arm around him, a bit.
A bit of complaining, then, about Molly, who was pestering them all about grandchildren, how soon, her hopes for many. Harry had laughed at that bit, and started thinking -
So he spent a lot of time tearing down flocked wallpaper, and sanding down floors, and repainting windows at Grimmauld Place. And he Leviosa’d stones and Reparo’d stained glass at Hogwarts. He babysat Teddy and hoped he could - hoped that he might matter.
“Harry, have you,” he was quiet, and blushed a light pink, “Have you really never done that before?”
He rubbed the back of his neck. God, this was all so awkward. Ginny must have seen the tension, and her next comment was either friendly or a vicious barb.
Luxury really was - it wasn’t what he’d been used to. When he’d first seen the heaps of gold in his family’s vault - and then the larger amount in the Black vaults - he’d felt… not excited, not really. It had almost felt like shame. How could he justify it, being wealthy, when he’d survived perfectly well on table scraps, on a lumpy pallet in a cupboard? He wanted more than that, of course, but wealth…. He didn’t feel like he deserved it.
What if he would look at a child of his blood and resent them bitterly because they’d never have to live the way that he had, hungry, cold, forgotten? It was a terrible thing to be so afraid of whatever monster might live in him - of the ways in which he had been harmed.
Narcissa popped over with some (uncomfortable) regularity for a glass of whiskey or a pot of tea and Harry had always been anxious until she grabbed him by the face and whispered, Draco out of the room, “You finally got it right. Thank you for loving him back.”
“Fuck your father,” her voice was cold as steel, and he gasped, choking on air, “Forgive me my crudeness. But fuck him right down into his grave.”
Back in their own flat, Harry and Draco were snuggled up under their green duvet with silver stitching, totally nude, as always. Draco’s head was tucked up under Harry’s chin, and Harry kissed his platinum hair.
“Sit down and don’t bother,” she perched on the chair opposite, “I’ve known about that muggle whiskey for quite some time.”
He pulled the lapels of his jacket up around his ears and began the walk down into the city centre. His flat was up the hill above the university, and it was a nice twenty minutes or so to his job.
Now, in this office filled with spinning magical accoutrements and a ridiculous number of plants, Draco looked up at the many portraits, avoiding Scorpius’s pitiful pose.
So now, after putting the castle back together, after going through the trials and finishing one last year of school - after fixing up Grimmauld for Andie and Teddy, and after a few sweet kisses with Gin (no real promises exchanged), Harry thought -
Dumbledore’s eyes retained their twinkle. He looked far too delighted, given the circumstances of this meeting. The old nutter.
He couldn’t help but remember that boy in the bathroom. Draco sat, hunched over himself with his elbows on his knees, those long legs folded up, and he held the still-burning butt of a cigarette. A bottle of Bushmills sat next to him, not quite half gone. And he looked the same, to him - all the years were meaningless, the laugh lines, the hair lightened by age - he was his Draco, the person he knew, down in his soul, he needed more than he needed air.
Fuck fuck fuck, how he wanted. And it looked like Potter wanted, too. It was too much, and he had to have it.
Jamie, forced to turn his music off - some Belgian rapper, it turned out, and a big thanks to Gabbi Goyle for that - and properly listen, gave an epic shrug which seemed to indicate, “Nothing to do with me,” and, “Is there a reason you’re interrupting my day with this?”
The flat was small - barely three rooms, just a living space with a tiny kitchenette, a bedroom with a crowded bathroom, the shower cubicle about the size of a postage stamp - and it was a bit dingey, with some crumbling plaster, the walls thin enough to let in the sound of someone playing music next door - and as soon as Harry stepped in, he started sniffling.
Cork was different, in some ways, and so similar in others. College kids still crowded into every pub, huddling on the pavement in the December chill, smoking and laughing and making spectacles of themselves, and when they drove past them in the back of a black cab, Draco looked out and grimaced, “Were we ever that young?”
With all of the furnishings in place, he hadn’t needed to make a lot of purchases, but the first - and most expensive - houseware he’d bought was a top of the line espresso machine. As he handed over his Gringotts charge card, he’d ignored the fact that he, himself, wasn’t that invested in high-quality espresso. It just -
Something he had felt when he had stared at Malfoy’s dot on the Marauder’s Map, something that had made him throw the map down and shove his hand under the covers and bite his own left knuckles and -
Rainy days and it was “Bring Me the Disco King” and he thought about taking a knife to the inside of his arm. When the flat was freezing with cold in a wet way which felt like falling into the sea, he played “My Death,” which was Jacques Brel, but Bowie lived and died it. And “The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud” was what he played when he first took another man into himself and wanted to scream out to his father and his past and those bitter green eyes.
Adults should always step in. We deserve a better world, and we have an obligation to make that world for our children. And that's the way it is.
He looked at the carpet, glass and burn marks, and he thought about how he had been so scared, back in the coffee shop, to open his mouth. How he hadn’t, then. He remembered watching Draco’s back as he walked away, and the sound of his strangled voice, that last day in the flat. He breathed in -
It was a very sad day indeed when a Potter was the brains of the operation. Draco sighed, rubbed his eyes, longing fervently for a glass of brandy and his bed.
“Hi, gorgeous,” a voice from behind him. He reached his arm back and wound his fingers through coarse hair. He felt solid, warm, good to lean on, but his scent wasn’t quite right.
“You don’t get to know that, Potter,” his chest pressed against Harry’s back, arm coming round, hand cradling his cock, firm and inexorable, “I don’t belong to you, not anymore. You’re going to stand there and wonder and doubt and think about all the other men who might have -”
“I do know. Praise the Goddess for giving him to us,” and then her voice was stern, commanding, “But now, now that you are no longer married, now that your son is in school - now I’ll speak freely, and tell you…”
Usually, that feeling edged out of his consciousness as he went through his routine. He was here, in Cork, working hard, partying harder, getting the bare minimum of sleep necessary, consuming ridiculous amounts of caffeine and nicotine. Life was rough and dirty and really quite good, as long as he had accepted that it was bad, deliciously. That the only person he was harming was himself.
He suddenly remembered one night, around one thirty in the morning, when he and Draco had stepped out of their club into the alley. Draco had convinced Colin to set up fairy lights and a few tables, but this night - a Saturday in July - the entire walkway was crammed with people, and the music flowing out of the club was blasting at maximum volume, and the whole place smelled of apples and malt and tar and hash. They’d been trying to find a space to talk, but a crowd of drunk university kids pushed Draco right up against Harry, Harry right up against the wall.
“Don’t know really,” he slipped in two fingers, thrusting back and forth, “Both, probably. God, you’re beautiful.”
Harry relaxed his legs further, pressing up against Draco - and Draco’s breath caught, but he didn’t pull away.
Greg had a little girl with toasted brown skin, Gabrielle, the first half-blood in his family, and Greg was so delighted, his doughy face beautiful as he held her in his arms -
“Yeah, yeah,” he kissed him, rolling them over, crawling down his body and fully taking advantage of the silencing charms, “You’re always right.”
Just like her mum. Harry remembered the first time he’d made her laugh so hard that she’d gotten the hiccups, and kept hiccupping for hours.
“It’s yours. And I wanted to,” he looked down at his shoes, suddenly embarrassed, “To thank you. For letting me borrow it.”
Harry nuzzled his face into Draco’s hand, nodding and closing his eyes, and he slid his pants to the floor. He licked Draco, root to tip, and Draco groaned, pushing his prick into Harry’s watering mouth.
Harry had never been good with words. He tried to put it in his eyes - I know, I know that you wanted to escape, I know that this isn’t the life you wanted, I know you didn’t understand what it would all mean.
Al did - he couldn’t exactly form coherent words at this particular moment - and his hips jerked up as Scorp took him into his mouth. Fuck, it was good to be home, in the room that their dads had finally let them share again (not that the separation had really stopped them, before). Scorp’s lips were hot and wet and frankly obscene, and Al, if he had any thoughts at all, thought that nothing in the world was as perfect and beautiful as this. Them. The way they were supposed to be.
Astoria had joined him - and his mother, cool as ever - for a restorative cup of tea before she apparated to her London flat. She’d moved the last of her belongings in January, but she had tried to spend as much time with Scorpius as possible before he went off to school.
Scorp was lazing in bed - the single they’d transfigured into a double as soon as they’d come home, and that their dads had, after blushing (Harry) and cackling (Draco), resolutely ignored - and Al was unpacking his school trunk for the last time. Scorp was releasing and catching a golden snitch - the snitch he’d grabbed in the quidditch final, which had won them the house cup.
He was still too thin and too pale, but his anger was comforting in its familiarity. Various odds and ends were flying through the air - not because of magic, but because of Draco’s forceful right arm. It was violent, and kind of fun to watch. And it was a little bit beautiful, too, beautiful like some wild beast in a cage, like something feral.
Dark - nearly black - hardwood floors stretched out in a large room that was floor to ceiling windows, looking out over the London skyline. The space was completely open, with a large kitchen in a minimalist style taking up the left side. An island, ice-white marble with sleek black cabinets, had room for four barstools.
He snapped his mouth shut and stormed out, embarrassed, because he did care. He testified for them. Of course he did. He’d expected Hermione - or at least Ron - to object, but they were both… oddly quiet on the matter.
A hex slices through the air, sizzling orange, and grazes Harry’s shoulder. Draco stumbles back, and another hex explodes a grouping of berries overhead, splashing berry shrapnel over Draco again.
Draco sucks his teeth and folds his arms across his chest, prickly and perfect, and Harry wants to devour him.
Harry sighs. “I have,” he says. His magic simmers, scalding the inside of his skin, and he’s too tired to fight it.
Draco ignores him, eyes focused on turning a page, the paper trembling in his fingers. Harry’s going to kiss those, too. He leans back against the shelf opposite Draco and
In a flash, Draco is on Harry’s side of the desk, clutching the arms of Harry’s chair, looming over him. Magic, cool and creamy sweet, hugs Harry, surrounding him in a protective bubble. Behind Draco, the silver fire divides and leaps to ignite papers and quills. Bracketed in by Draco’s body, Harry is powerless.
Harry thinks madly. Smoke puffs out, a thin trail wafting up and up and up toward a contraption fixed to the ceiling.
—he can’t look away. His heart slams into his ribs, and his cheeks warm at the memory of wanking to an embarrassingly quick finish to thoughts of that necklace.
“Sod off!” Harry hops off the counter. He jabs two fingers into the icing and swipes it on Ron’s jaw. A hunk drips off and lands on one of the balloon boobs.
salty.” He gives them an obscene gesture, inserting his tongue to waggle between the vee of his two fingers.
“Ten minutes, Harry. Ten fucking minutes and we wouldn’t be parked in Outer Darkness with the”—Ron squints at a gaggle of tiny students passing in front of the truck’s hood—“sophomores.”
Harry’s magic bursts hot, rattling the bureau drawers and his bones. His cock twitches in his fist, dribbling pre-come. He whimpers around Draco’s cock.
Harry’s gaze travels from Draco’s exposed ankle up to the peak of his bony kneecap to follow the shadowy path carved into the inner thigh muscle… all the way to the clear outline of Draco’s cock nestled against his hip crease.
Harry focuses back on the parchment. He sets a Correction Quill to the handwritten paragraphs, reading as it skims along. The quill makes a few grammatical changes and writes a notation in the margin, but Draco is correct—the writing is damn near perfect. As was last month’s fashion editorial. And every editorial before that. It’s cheeky, witty, and brilliant, much like the bloke who penned it.
Harry swallows the saliva pooling under his tongue. “I’ve no sense of self-preservation,” he announces, chuckling at Draco’s lifted brow. “Hermione says.”
They watch Draco wrestle a wire hanger into a lopsided shape and jimmy it between the driver’s side window and the door.
Thunder rolls, and Malfoy steps from the shadows, an agonizing emergence, each step a revelation that he’s alive—a scarred Chelsea boot, soft-worn jeans sagging below a Ramones t-shirt, his blond hair.
“Well, I never -” his voice came to an abrupt stop as Harry mouthed at the tender skin of his inner thighs.
He listened to The Clash and thought about his father, about imposing his own brand of anarchy on his stilted and tight fisted childhood. He threw things and threw up at two in the morning, the McDonald’s he’d grabbed after a night at the clubs coming up looking not all that dissimilar from the way it went down.
When they found a flat they could afford on their starting salaries - Al, with his potions mastery stipend, and Scorpius, with his beginning pay as a reserve player for the Wasps - their dads were the first of their family to see it.
Harry had laughed, Draco remembered that so clearly. Like it was all so funny. Neglect and abuse and the little ways that he coped with them, laughing, rubbing at his nose, shivering in his arms, and then he kissed Draco with such fierce intensity that Draco hadn’t been able to blurt out, my father locked me in our cellar, sometimes, and his cane was hard with sharp fangs, and -
He picked his head up and kissed Draco, right at the corner of his mouth where he kept his secret smiles.
“Scorpius,” Draco called him over, took him by the shoulders, and wrapped him in a firm embrace, “Just be safe, alright?”
“‘Cause you saw it from the outside. And that’s a good story, that kind of meant to be, but that’s not what it feels like from the inside.”
“Well,” still prickly, but running his hands gently over Harry’s arse, “What else do you do in a bath? It’s just a… common association.”
“You thought I’d be alright stumbling along? Marrying Gin? Having three children? When I’m meant to...” he trailed off, shoulders tense.
They were quiet for a moment, the ticking of their kitchen clock - a twin of Molly’s, with hands for them and the kids and Teddy - the only sound in the room.
As he crossed the street and ducked back into the club, he thought about that image - Potter, biting his lips to keep quiet, his pulsing prick in hand, wet from both of them, his head thrown back - and didn’t know if he hoped he’d show up tomorrow or prayed that he wouldn’t.
“Yeah,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, an old habit. He heard Draco’s breath catch, and saw him clench his jaw and look away.
But most of all, that first year was marked by an almost orgiastic adherence to a sepulchral warning - “don’t wanna stay alive/When you’re 25.”
“Oh, yes,” he pretended that he had forgotten, that her words were a revelation, “I suppose you must be right.”
He looked up through the blonde fringe of his eyelashes, then tossed back his platinum hair. Harry flushed.
He’d stopped breathing, that must have been it - that was why he was so dizzy, and why he gasped out, “Fuck, Malfoy.”
He looked around the flat, taking in all the details - the patch of damp plaster in the corner that never seemed to dry, the pokey little bathroom with the cracked mirror, the kitchenette stocked with his favorite tea. The record player, the stack of LPs. The blue cotton sheets, serviceable, almost soft enough. The little tin of pomade, down to the last few drops.
And a few lines, nothing too soft or romantic but still sweet like the first ice creams of summer, about how she hoped he was having a good time, and that she missed him.
“This ridiculous charade… these months, every fuck, every pitiful,” he slammed a fist against the wall, “You wanted me to feel something for you, compassion and gratitude and -”
“I loved you when you made that paper crane, you remember, that stupid bird, and sent it flying to me in third year. I loved you when I was running and hunting and I saw you in my horrible visions, torturing other death eaters, with fear and horror on your face.
He had moments like this. When he felt like he was being followed. As if his past were a person, chasing him.
He’d been lucky, actually. In that first week - living off the small purse of galleons he’d managed to grab before leaving the manor - he wasn’t sure how he would survive. But he had ended up going out, night after night, and he usually ended up at Chambers when the pubs closed and the nightclubs opened.
“Thank you for the gift of my life,” he tongued at the slit, held the base of Harry’s cock in a firm grip, and winked, “Now pull my hair and fuck my face, will you?”
“Sugar does not belong in coffee,” despite the complaints, he drained his drink, “I take two shots of espresso, Potter -” he grimaced and corrected himself as Harry nudged his leg, “Harry. With cream. Get it right tomorrow.”
Draco as he clenched, sucking him in further, giving a broken cry, his whole body jerking as he came between them, and holy fuck, it was so hot, Draco’s come wet on their stomachs, and the tender fucked and fucked up gaze, and Harry coming with such excruciating pleasure that it was exquisitely painful.
The door opened behind him. Harry kept his eyes closed. He heard the door swing shut again, and then he heard it lock.
A few curious glances were thrown his way, but he ducked his head before anyone could point and stare (“That’s Harry Potter!”) and, for lack of anything else to do, ran out to catch a black cab.
The cabbie interrupted his wool-gathering. Harry, standing in the shade-cooled street, felt so tired.
He picked up one of Hugo’s crayons - green, with paper peeling away - and clutched it in his fingers.
She picked up Hugo, tucking a few curls behind his ears, and then leaned over to kiss Harry’s cheek.
Harry laughed, and maybe he was also crying a little, and he did pull his hair, and Draco took him down all the way, until Harry gave a choked moan and pushed him back -
In the hotel room, Draco fell back onto the plush mattress, feet still on the floor, closing his eyes and stretching. Harry stood between his legs, pulled off his jumper.
“Not that I’m complaining,” he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, a disaster as always, “But what was that?”
It was new, and it was strange, and it was perfect. Draco was gentle with him - not tentative, no, but - almost reverent. Harry felt him slip in another finger, and the stretch was so good, because it was Draco stretching him, Draco’s long fingers, his smell everywhere, his face so serene and predatory and that twitch in his eye that showed he was nervous. He looked dangerous, like something untamed, and he held Harry in his hand like a bird he could crush, and when he found Harry’s prostate it was like coming home.
So he read some erotica, and watched some porn, and it was arousing in a general way (unfortunately rather more arousing than intimacy with Ginny) but again, there was this - this gap. And for so long he thought he could live with it.
A scar, reddened in the heat of the club, and green eyes like apples, and glasses digging into him, and fuck, that mouth, the way it hated him sometimes, and the way he plowed into it -
And that happened again - Al, born a little early and still small, and Lily, the perfect package, seven pounds and bright red fluff. He loved all three of his children so much that it filled the dead parts of him. They almost filled the portions of his heart that could never be satisfied with Ginny.
Draco dropped his forehead to the back of his neck and breathed, frustrated, pained, “Why do I let you -”
Pulling off, Draco whimpered - and Harry moved his mouth, down, and lifted Draco’s legs over his shoulders.
It was nice running into you (literally, I suppose) yesterday, though it wasn’t exactly something I’d planned out. I don’t know if you heard, but I’m -”
“Better times, hmm?” He sucked on Al’s neck, leaving a deep purple bruise (not knowing, thank God, that that was his father’s signature move).
“So what’d you think?” Draco’s voice was calm, almost bored, as he rolled off and stared at the ceiling, still panting, “Is the great Harry Potter a bottom after all?”
He took a step towards Harry, bristling, and the flat felt like that moment before a lightning strike, ozone and electricity.
Draco relaxed back, that secret smile pulling at his lips, and slanted his eyes over, “But did you know about Luna?”
It’s not as if they hadn’t spent any time together since he and Ginny had decided to divorce. Of course, Ron and Hermione had been told right away. And they were good to him, even though - even though they knew the reasons why. But he felt a tightness in his stomach, here in this warm place where he and Gin had shared meals so many times, and he hardly knew what to do with himself.
And he had never, not for one moment - not when she kissed him before he left for work, not when they placed Jamie in his bassinet, not when they celebrated Christmas with all the Weasleys, not even when he watched her fly with her red hair burning up the blue sky - felt that way about Ginny.
All he got back from Draco’s eyes was a flicker - and it could have been understanding, but it also could have been anger, or resentment, or shame. He still made no move to take the wand, so Harry placed it next to the decanter.
Harry pressed, once more, against that bundle of nerves - left his fingers there, still, while he leaned over Draco and kissed his mouth. Draco wiggled and he pulled his fingers away.
I’m going to go somewhere. Where no one knows me. Where I can be a kid, for once in my miserable life.
He leaned his head back, and Draco looked down at him, both of them wet and messy, and he kissed him then, one more time, and it was sweet.
So, yeah, 37 years old, three children, an almost ex-wife, about to be homeless - because he didn’t want to keep imposing on Gin, who was already too good to him - and he could just give himself a smack because it wasn’t men he wanted, not men he threw over Ginny for. Not the cute barista, who practically screamed power bottom; not Justin at work, who’d tried it on once and kindly laughed off Harry’s rebuff; not any of the fantastically attractive Quidditch players he’d met through Gin. No.
“Shut up. He’s fucking tough, you know? But if you think you didn’t,” her voice broke, “Didn’t hurt him, you’re an idiot.”
He looked up at her, fast. There was a little meanness around the fine lines of her eyes, but mostly he saw an undeserved tenderness.
A growl at the back of her throat, “Harry Potter. He is the stupidest person I have ever met. He is an utter disgrace to any sense of style, gentility, or culture. Sometimes I think I hate him more than I hated my bloody useless Death Eater father.”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude,” Harry starts, “I was just curious if you were getting a present for Pansy,” he finishes and Draco immediately bursts out laughing.
“I still think you’re overreacting, Dray,” Pansy starts, “You’ve had exactly one lesson that lasted for 2 hours. Nobody can become a pro in that amount of time, not even you.” She sighs and makes her way towards where Draco is sitting at the head of the table. “You need to give it time to become easier before you decide to give up. Plus, if you give up now, you’ll never get a date with Hot Pottery Guy.” She sends a wink Draco’s way and watches with satisfaction as he blushes.
The question startles Draco and he accidentally squeezes too hard on a portion of the clay, causing him to mess up.
“No. No, not at all,” Draco rushes to get out in fear of upsetting Harry. “I know I’m early, but I was hoping to have a look around the shop at some of your pieces before we started today so I’m just going to head inside,” Draco finishes and heads into the shop before he can make a fool of himself. His little crush just became instantly larger and he can feel himself starting to blush about the entire situation.
Draco doesn’t know why, but he feels like Teddy isn’t talking about the teapot. He nods his head, though, and takes the bag from Teddy before turning to Harry gesturing for him to lead the way.
They hadn’t stayed there for long since Draco was a lightweight and Pansy knew exactly what to get him to make him forget the fastest. He had had about 5 shots before he was hanging off of Pansy and she was hailing a taxi to take them home. Draco was in bed by 9 and out by 9:15, and Pansy had never been happier.
She takes him to the mall and Draco lets her pick out his clothes. He ends up with a nice white button-down, some black skinny jeans, and a black jean jacket. She also talks him into getting a pair of Docs to complete the outfit. The outfit isn’t completely out of his comfort zone, but it’s definitely different. However, Draco’s pretty sure he has these exact jeans at home, but he isn’t going to tell Pansy that. He’s thankful for the trip and for his friend. He definitely needed something to take his mind off of pottery, and this trip to the mall is perfect.
The door chimes as Draco enters the shop. He wasn't really sure why he was there, but he needed a new hobby and Pansy told him to come here. Draco was thankful for his best friend, and, even though he did have his doubts, this did seem like something he could potentially be interested in. He'd been painting all his life, but lately he's lost his spark. It doesn't bring him the joy that it once did. Instead, it just stresses him out. There's always a deadline to meet or someone else to please and it's just become too much for Draco. So he decided to take a break. Actually, Pansy and his mother decided he was going to take a break because apparently he became “a grumpy old man” every time he talked about a current job. So he finished everything he was working on and decided not to take anymore commissions until he found joy in painting again. Taking a break left him with a problem though. Since he's no longer painting, he doesn't really have anything else he can do. Painting has been his only constant hobby since high school, and now Draco wasn’t sure what to do anymore. He wasn’t even sure what he was good at besides painting. He’s never really done anything else. Sure, he loves to read, but reading wasn’t really something he could be paid for doing and make a living on. No, he needs something to really keep his hands busy or else he's going to go stir-crazy and starve. He’s always been a very hands-on person, and painting was definitely a hands-on activity.
Once inside the shop, Draco immediately heads straight for the right side of the room where his favorite items are. There’s a small collection of bird-related items that caught his attention the very first time he had really looked around. Draco has always loved birds. He loves the way that they move and how many different kinds there are in the world. The amount of bird-related pictures he’s drawn in his career is high: they’re one of the few things that Draco used to paint for himself. There is just something about birds that have always spoken to him, and the ones on these pieces of pottery are no different.
The next week and a half passes by in a blur with Draco focusing on nothing except for pottery and Pansy. Soon, Draco is on his 6th lesson with Harry, and he’s feeling much better about his own pottery. Even though nothing has been quite perfect yet, he has some creations that are pretty damn close.
Draco is proud of himself. Harry has been an excellent teacher, and Draco doesn’t think he could have asked for a better one. Harry has been extremely kind and patient throughout the entire process, and it definitely helps Draco’s confidence in himself and his creations. Today, they are working on vases. Draco’s is almost finished, and he’s pretty happy with his work today. It’s definitely the best thing he has made so far, and he’s actually looking forward to painting it afterward too. When the lesson on vases started, Draco immediately knew he was going to make one for Pansy. He wants to show her how thankful he is that she helped convince him to go with pottery. He thinks about it and ends up deciding to paint black pansies on the outside of the vase when it’s finished. She may be slightly embarrassed about it, but Pansy’s favorite flower has always been pansies.
The two continue to work in silence for the rest of the lesson, a new understanding in the air. Draco finishes his mug by the time their lesson comes to an end, and he sticks around a little longer to help Harry clean up the day’s mess. By the time Harry walks him out, there isn’t a trace of awkwardness left between the two of them.
Draco takes a deep breath, thinking. “I just don’t want to go home and tell my father that I’ve failed yet again,” Draco’s voice shifts, “He has finally accepted that his only son is gay, I don’t need to give him another reason for him to think I’m a disappointment again. I just got him back.”
As Draco starts his walk back home, he risks a second glance back at Harry, only to catch him still watching him walk away. Draco gives a small wave before turning back around with a slight smile on his face and an extra skip in his step.
The day passes by slowly, and Draco gets more and more anxious as it continues. He feels better after his day with Pansy, but he’s still nervous about it all. Draco really doesn’t want to fail, and he definitely can’t tell his father that he did, so he continues to push through the day. Soon enough the clock strikes 4 and he starts his walk to Potter’s Pottery.
“I’m absolutely awful, Pansy. I don’t know how many times you need me to tell you this until you finally understand.” Draco has been ranting to Pansy ever since the two of them woke up after their night at The Hog’s Head.
"Excellent. I have to finish my current project before I'm ready to start lessons, but that should only take me until the end of the week. Are you available to start on Monday at 4:30? And then we can figure out a schedule from there?" Harry asks Draco.
So that's what brought him here to Potter's Pottery. He can’t help but roll his eyes at the shop’s name. The owner was an artist, and aren’t artists supposed to be artistic and creative? Nevertheless, he continues into the shop. Draco makes his way around the shop slowly. He wants to admire all the pieces of work that obviously took a long time to create. He drags his fingers across some of them, admiring the artwork on the outside as well as the structure itself. He goes through pretty much the entire shop before he continues to make his way towards the empty counter at the back. Draco looks around for a minute, checking to see if there was anybody here that could help him. He hadn’t seen anyone during his self tour of the store, so he finally decides to ring the bell that’s sitting next to the register.
"Sorry about the wait, I didn't hear the door chime and my piece was in a precarious state" the man, Harry according to his name tag, says. Draco doesn't hear any of it though; he's too busy staring at the gorgeous man in front of him.
Pansy, sensing his mood falling, decides they need to do something to get Draco’s mind off of everything. She quickly decides that they’re going to go shopping. She’s been wanting a new dress and Draco desperately needs a new date night outfit for when he and Hot Pottery Guy eventually go on a date.
It doesn’t take them long to find Pansy’s new dress since she knows exactly what she wants and where to find it, and soon they are on their way to grab some dinner before heading back to Draco’s for a movie night.
“Trust me. I told you it was exciting.” Draco swings his leg. His velvet-clad foot taps Harry’s chair to a beat matching the pitter-pat of Harry’s heart. The buckle capping the top of his loafer glints in the lamplight, catching Harry’s attention like a Niffler with a gold sequin.
“Looking for this?” Albus holds up a tiny plastic toy, his grin made all the more devious by two unruly black curls sprouting like devil horns from his temples. James, in his scramble to snatch his prize, knocks over a glass of juice.
Hermione giggles and buries her blush in her hands, setting Theo’s face ablaze. Harry smiles. It’s lovely to see her so relaxed and happy.
He takes off running at a fast clip, Harry following close at his heels. They crash through the brambles and hurtle over the hedge. Ron’s already on the path, arms and legs pumping as he runs.
Wind howls through the pub’s alleyway like the hollow note singing from the bottleneck of a stout. Another lightning strike bleaches Harry’s vision, but it’s the crack of Apparition a moment later that shocks him. His magic eddies in his palms, coiled and ready.
After the Christmas tree blaze, two rubbish bin fires, and a singeing of his poor owl’s tail feathers, Harry acknowledges that he might have a small problem. And that a remarkable amount of everyday items make perfect tinder—ink, paper clips, shoelaces.
The moment Draco speaks the Summoning Charm, the berries explode like tiny grenades, pelting Draco with pips and berry flesh.
Pansy’s hyena laughter draws Potter’s attention. He grabs a shot glass from a passing waiter’s tray, tosses it back in one swallow, and disengages from his conversation with Ron. He takes two steps in Draco’s direction, only to be waylaid by Ginerva Weasley. She places her hand to Harry’s jaw and leans in to whisper in Harry’s ear. Harry laughs, cheeks pinking.
A nudge to his shoe opens Harry’s eyes. Underneath the table and into his lap, a piece of notebook paper edged with a galaxy of inky stars slides into view. A note written in Draco’s slanting script says,
Harry groans at the ceiling and resumes pacing, pausing only when he hears the door click shut. Draco leans against the jamb and appraises the room. His gaze lingers on a pair of red pants patterned with golden snitches draped over the chair, then his eyes flick to another pair—blue with green dragons—pooled by the chest of drawers.
Pansy uses her straw to stir the ice in her glass. “Nev popped over to his Gran’s.” Her deep sigh nearly heaves her ample bosom out of her bodycon dress.
“Potter,” Nott says. He nods to Percy and smiles dimples at Luna. His grin slides into a smirk. “Malfoy.”
Draco ribs him about his blandness every time he delivers a scoop atop his dessert, and so Harry reminds him of how
Malfoy leans against the opposite brick wall. He lolls his head back and juts his hips forward, watching Harry with hooded eyes. The cigarette tucked behind his ear flits into his hand, and he lights it with the snap of a Muggle lighter. The flame’s glow highlights his knuckles, mangled and bloody.
A muffled yell recalls him to the Burrow’s den. Ron has flung himself onto the sofa, face buried into Aunt Muriel’s afghan.
Draco’s voice follows him, but all Harry hears is the blood roaring in his ears. He stumbles into the bathroom and quickly scans the stalls. The room is empty. He presses his palm against his erection, drops his backpack, and is about to throw down the jacket when he catches a whiff of something clean and spicy. He buries his nose in the wool and inhales deeply.
“You’ve a bit on your face,” he says, breathless as he cups Draco’s jaw. The juice bead smears beneath his thumb as he trails it along Draco’s jawline and down under his chin. Draco’s smile fades and he swallows, his Adam’s apple rolling under Harry’s thumbpad.
A tsunami of hot shame drowns him, and he chokes back a mortified sob. From the direction of the front desk, Mrs Pince’s shush confirms that he is not—repeat,
“So.” Draco stares at the ground. “Penises these days then, Potter?” He lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s, his eyes so focused Harry’s heart pulses out one, two, three quick beats.
Lottie tosses her black plait over her shoulder and explains in her American accent, “The grapefruit is tart, and the salt rim bites.”
“Good boy,” Draco purrs. Warmth coils through Harry’s veins like the smoke still rising from the candle, pushing heat through his fingertips. The balloon pops.
He groans, Draco’s name rolling sweetly on his tongue, and comes so hard, his ejaculate paints the wall.
“I can’t fathom why,” Ginny drawls. She tosses a Quaffle at his head. “You’ve done fuck-all this morning.”
Heat quivers through him, pushing blood to his groin. By the time they stop in front of Draco’s classroom, Harry’s light-headed, his dick is fully hard…
Draco sets a glass next to Harry’s elbow and moves around to Harry’s side of the desk. Up close, the velvet shifts through deep blues and violets in the golden light from the singular desk lamp because
Draco’s teeth flash pearly white, and he sets the plate on the chest of drawers. “Cake is brilliant. Or so I’ve heard.”
“I always like to look impeccable.” Draco cards his fingers through Harry’s hair. “But yes, I did select my ensemble with you in mind.”
“I’ve no idea what you mean.” A shift on the arm of the chair and a nonchalant slouch against the chair back allows Draco to elongate his leg. Darkening green eyes follow the pinstripes lining his trousers from his ankle to hip. Draco’s magic purrs, gratified.
