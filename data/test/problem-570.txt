[Draco interview/confession: It’s not that I have anything against muggle clothing, in theory. I’m just far more comfortable in wizarding robes. I tend to stick to clean lines and expensive fabrics in muted colors. I suppose, however, that if Teddy feels as though I should don trousers every once in a while, I can make the sacrifice.]
Harry lifted his gaze, ready to accept a verbal lashing from Draco. What he saw was much worse than a pointed barb: the look on his face was one of hurt.
casual,” Draco supplies from where he’s perched on the edge of Harry’s bed. “Whenever we visit you, your fellow instructors are generally wearing pressed trousers and button-downs or blouses. And the trainees have special uniforms. But you’re you, so you can wear whatever you like,” Draco says, inspecting his nails.
“Hello to you too, Pansy,” Hermione said, crossing her arms over her chest. “Always a pleasure.”
“Oh, Potter. I take it all back. That is heavenly. You may cook for me anytime you like.” Harry smirked, and then smiled widely when Malfoy opened his eyes and licked his lips.
Harry sighs and closes his eyes. “I mean, I have no idea what’s going on in that head of his. Some days it seems like he’s about to strangle me for simply existing, and then the next he’s leaving me little notes in the lunch he’s packed for me.”
I feel fingers trace the skin that’s bulging up around where the garter straps are pressing into the fleshy cheeks of my arse, and then Harry drops to his knees. He rubs his stubbled jaw against the sensitive skin at the inside of my thighs before trailing his fingertips down, causing my skin to break out into gooseflesh. He caresses my ankles and my calves, working his back way up my legs slowly, pausing to press kisses to random points as he goes.
“Don’t you dare come.” Draco raised an eyebrow, waiting for Harry to acknowledge his command. Harry nodded, letting the bottle of lube roll away as he fisted his hands in the duvet, more than half sure that Draco Malfoy would kill him via sex.
“You wouldn’t!” Gasped Draco.
Malfoy obeyed slowly, looking back at where Harry stood waiting. “What are you going to do?”
Malfoy bristled. “You laugh, Potter, but you wouldn’t if you’d seen what I saw. I had no idea Granger was so...flexible.”
Jonathan pushes forward. “Yes, little man!” He leans down to high five Teddy. “We’re here! Where are my two gorgeous bachelors?!”
Harry tracked the soapy rivulets of water that ran down Draco’s forearms, and the feeling of want overwhelmed him. Harry remembered the first time that he’d kissed Ginny, and the feeling that he associated most vividly with that kiss was triumph. Gryffindor had just won the Quidditch Cup, and he’d been welcomed into the common room like a conquering hero. He’d felt invincible in that moment - like he could do anything, be anyone - and so he’d grabbed his chance to be normal. He’d won the big game and he’d get the girl, just like in the all muggle movies he’d seen. It felt inevitable, really. Yes, he’d wanted Ginny, but he came to realise that what he wanted most was what Ginny represented: safety, family, and security. He spent the long nights on watch in the Forest of Dean while they were hunting for horcruxes imagining he and Ron would teaching their sons how to play quidditch in the field behind the Burrow while Ginny and Hermione fixed dinner, barefoot and pregnant. He’d been through enough therapy at this point to recognise that at the time, he’d needed to hold on to that narrative to cope with the trauma and uncertainty he had been dealing with (he winced internally at what either woman would say to him now should he disclose his daydreams to them).
He split the holidays between the Weasleys and the Weinbergs, and found solace in sitting around the fire of Grimmauld Place with a book and a mug of tea. Harry sought the help of a Mind Healer, and learned about PTSD.
“Ugh,
“Huh.” Harry turned to address Malfoy, letting his thigh rest against the other boy’s as he shifted his weight. “Did you notice anything sorta, erm, weird, going on between Pansy, Ron, and Hermione?”
[Scene cuts to the Fab Five standing in the foyer outside the sitting room with Draco, Harry, and Teddy.]
Realising it was past noon, Draco decided to brave the elements - today it was icy pavement and freezing wind - to explore his new neighborhood in search of sustenance. He was curious about the “trendiest area of London,” and hoped that he would find out what made the neighbourhood worth the price of rent. He turned left and began walking carefully down the street, noting that there were three cafes a stone's throw from each other, all advertising “organic, fair-trade coffee” and decorated in the minimalist style he associated with Scandinavian design. While Draco was no stranger to muggle economic practices, he was still mystified as to how three businesses in such close proximity to each other could stay in business.
The Chosen One has a massive cock. Merlin and Morgana both, Potter. You’re lucky I like you, or I would punish you for denying me access to this monster for maybe ‘the past two years.’” He used scare quotes to parrot Harry’s words back at him, and Harry giggled. “I swear Draco, I didn’t deliberately keep my dick from you. We were on opposite sides of a war, and then I didn’t think you were interested! There were extenuating circumstances! But now, you have full access to my dick. Full. Access.”
“I didn’t expect to have lingerie flying around, Malfoy! These are so…”
...well, maybe not so much ‘mortified’ as ‘intrigued and turned on’ to know that Malfoy had had sexual thoughts about him...
[Producer’s voice: what the hell just happened?!
“Do you not have to work at the deli today?” Draco asked, looking around curiously at the various muggle kitchen devices.
[the camera watches the Fab Five leave the kitchen, and then pans back for a final shot of Draco and Harry, who are still sitting at the table. Their heads are bent in conversation, and both men are smiling at each other.]
“What did that git Charlie Vance say to you?” Asked Draco, brow furrowing. If it weren’t frowned upon to hex children, he certainly would have done so to that little twit. He had already been the cause of many of Lily’s tears, and Draco was fiercely protective of their only female resident. It made Harry’s heart swell to bursting at the special friendship that the two of them had formed.
Al came thundering down the stairs. He stopped short of Scorpius and said a quiet hello to Draco. “Want to see my room?” he asked. Scorpius nodded, toeing off his shoes and throwing his coat at his father.
____________________
Suddenly Draco dropped his legs and growled at Harry to stop. Harry immediately froze, scared that he had hurt him.
“Of course, Dr Song!” Harry turned and waved at her before continuing to Draco’s cabin.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “but I’m your pervert.”
“Albus Severus Potter get down here right now! I need you and your brother to finish setting the table because Jamie only put out plates!”
Draco set the spoon he’d been holding down on a napkin and set both hands on the flat surface of the table. He looked back up at Harry. “Are you saying that you weren’t upset that you kissed me last night? That you interpreted my facial expressions in such a way that made you think that I didn’t return your desire for said kiss?”
closing this layer, Draco! Use your bloody eyes! I’m cleaning the balk for final photographs!”
“I know, and with our skin tone? It’s positively dreadful. But mother has always been aces at compartmentalising. Whenever we don our community service attire she acts as though she’s preparing for a Ministry Ball.” Draco laughed. “When our supervisor tried to scold her for altering her ‘uniform,’ she quite literally threw the rule book at him and told him that she’d read every single page and there wasn’t anything against alterations, as long as they were wearing the original jumpsuit. And she’d used all the original fabric.”
I shift in Harry’s desk chair, trying to regain feeling in my arse. I don’t understand how he sits in this wooden monstrosity for hours on end. Not that I’m going to get comfortable, given what I’m wearing. This isn’t
“Harry, how you present yourself directly influences how people treat you. I know you’re the Chosen One, but if you want to be respected by your colleagues and students, then you need to show them the best, most confident version of yourself,” Tan says, holding up a faded button-down shirt the colour of mud. “This shirt says to me, ‘I don’t take myself seriously and neither should you.’ Don’t you want to show the world that you’re a grown-ass Saviour and not a scruffy teenager?”
Ten years later, the Granger/Malfoy research team had made huge strides not only the field of memory studies, but also in the adaptation of muggle treatment methods to various wizarding maladies. They had even organised an international conference between muggle and magical medical researchers, getting the British and French Ministries’ approval for the collaborations. While he wasn’t on speaking terms with Ronald Weasley or Harry Potter, he had indeed sent them letters and received - terse though they may have been - responses. Hermione attended Draco’s wedding solo, and while he had been invited to the great Granger-Weasley union of 2003, he’d declined to attend. Though he counted Hermione as one of his closest friends, he didn’t wish to see her day marred in controversy when a Death Eater showed up to the celebration.
“Live your truth, henny!” Jonathan shouts suddenly, snapping his fingers in the air. “Wear what makes you feel beautiful!”
“Good to know that a change in our relationship won’t affect your forms of address.”
“His full name isn’t Harold, you know,” Draco says, narrowing his eyes at Jonathan, who is attempting to pull on the snitch boxers over his skin-tight jeans.
Jonathan starts stroking his fingers through Draco’s blond hair, which falls to just below his shoulders. “How long have you been wearing your hair like this? Is it your trademark look?”
Harry was grateful that the darkness of the night concealed his blush. “Fuck off, Malfoy,” he mumbled, covering his discomfort by taking another large gulp of wine. Even if he did have kinks, he’d never really had the chance to explore them with anyone. The whole, ‘being hunted down by a psychopath wizard bent on world domination’ thing had taken up most of his time and energy for the past seven years. This past summer he had taken advantage of being young and free and not dogged by any foreboding prophecies, and had gone clubbing in London a handful of times with Ron and Hermione. He’d enjoyed a few one-night stands with both men and women, but hadn’t met anyone that he wanted to see for more than a quick orgasm or two. It wasn’t exactly a conducive environment to explore one’s sexual proclivities.
“A six year old called your father The Chosen Fairy? What a little shit! Why weren’t we informed of this?!” Draco shouted, turning to Harry.
“Are you sure this is how you want to do this, Harry?” Ginny asked, reaching out to grab a handful of the back of Al’s shirt as he tried to launch himself at his brother.
“Thank you, Mr Potter.” She began reading over Malfoy’s meticulous reports. “I appreciate your words. But just to make sure that you’re not simply placating your professor with empty promises, you two will be in charge of cooking dinner tonight.” She smiled brightly at them, winked, and strode off towards Ron and Tony’s trench.
Draco merely shrugged and smiled lasciviously at Harry.
“No!” Jamie yelled, turning almost as red as his hair. “Merlin, DD! I was hoping to go to my grave without ever discussing that!” The guests were all howling with laughter, although Harry looked like he might start to cry again. Jamie gave himself a little shake and continued. “No, this story comes from when I was fourteen and home for the winter hols. Zayde was in hospital, and dad was there almost twenty-four hours a day at that point. I had just gotten what I thought was the worst owl of my young life. Teddy had told me, in no uncertain terms, that not only was I too young for him, but he simply ‘didn’t see me as anything other than a friend’ after I confessed my love for him.”
“Come on Harry, fuck me. Fuck my tight little hole. I want you to make me come all over myself because I’m such a little slut for you.”
Harry’s hand wraps around me and pumps and I’m coming within seconds, streaking Harry’s chest with white.
“Cheers, Harry,” Draco murmured into Harry’s ear from the seat next to him. “And thank you for including me and Scorpius. This has been an extraordinary evening.”
Lily giggled, her expression turning from cloudy to amused in the blink of an eye. Draco took her hand and they walked out of the kitchen, Lily exclaiming loudly about the virtues of Superman. He caught Harry’s eye and smiled as he left the room. Harry thought that if he lived a thousand years, he’d never tire of that smile or those shining gray eyes.
“Je voulais seulement dire bonjour, papa!” Scorpius always reverted to speaking in French when he was frustrated. “Je n'ai presque pas d'amies en Londres!”
“In all seriousness, I really can’t thank you lot enough for what you’ve done for our family. It’s been life-changing.” Harry looks around at the assembled group. “Our relationship with Teddy is better than it’s ever been, and who knows what it would’ve taken to get me and Draco to this point without that salon chair and Jonathan’s subtle manipulations.”
Teddy regards his fathers calmly. “Well, Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron are always poking at each other and laughing and looking at each other weird. And Aunt Ginny and Aunt Luna do it too, but they also kiss when they think no one’s looking. Granny Molly said that they’re just ‘flirting’ when I asked what they were doing.” He spreads his hands as if it’s obvious. “And you two do that, but not with kissing or anything. You just say sort of mean things but you’re smiling a lot and laughing, and then sometimes you touch each other. So, it’s flirting, right?”
The three Potter children entered the kitchen just then, taking their seats and talking over each other.
[Antoni confessional/interview: cooking as a family is a great way to bond and solidify relationships. I chose this recipe because it’s healthy, hearty, and simple enough that even Teddy can partake in its preparation!]
Harry shrugs, then leans down to press a quick kiss to Draco’s lips, which draws out a deep blush across his cheeks. “But who knows how long it would’ve taken you to admit you’re madly in love with me?”
Draco made a strangled noise in his throat and gripped the arms of the chair. Surely Harry didn’t mean …
Ten minutes later Draco was close enough to the door that he was able to read a sign proclaiming, “Weinberg’s Deli, est. 1947” in neon red. The inside was full to the brim: people standing and eating huge sandwiches and sipping sodas at a wooden counter; others sat at tables scattered in the rather small space afforded to in-house dining. Draco found that he quite liked the old feel of the place - the black and white tiled floor and wooden countertops reminded him of muggle films he’d seen that were set in New York City and run by no-nonsense women.
Jonathan stops cutting and puts his hands on Harry’s shoulders. “Sugar pie. Honey bunch. I’m just saying what I’m seeing, and what she is seeing is not only a whole mess of sexual tension, but also a whole mess of love! The way he looks at you… and the way you look at him!” Jonathan fans himself with his hand. “Are you really telling me there’s nothing between you two?”
“Welcome to Weinberg’s deli,” the woman continued, “what a mitzvah, to be able to serve you.” Something in her tone and mannerisms reminded Harry of Mrs. Weasley, although this woman had at least 30 years on her and a strong Northern accent. She turned back to the man, moving her hands to her hips. “Of course he needs matzo ball soup! Mein gott! Saul, get him sat down. And get him a rugelach. Or three. He’s thin as a rail!” She hurried back through the silver door, muttering to herself in the language Harry couldn’t place.
[Producer’s voice, off-screen: they’re mic’d right? Please [bleep]ing tell me they’re mic’d!]
“How do you even know what flirting
“Careful, Malfoy, you wouldn’t want to strain yourself and accidentally compliment me,” Harry responds, amusement in his voice. He knocks his shoulder against Draco’s and smiles. “I’ll take distinguished, though.”
Jamie looked between all three adults and shook his head. “Grownups are so weird. Mum, can we go now? I wanna watch Doctor Who.”
oOoOoOoOoOoOo
, Teddy?” Draco demands, his hands on his hips.
“A non-Jewish person,” replied Saul, helping himself to a rugelach.
“Weekends are the best!” Teddy exclaims. “We usually go see my Granny Andy at St Mungo’s but she’s forgetful and sometimes doesn’t remember who I am so I have to remind her with pictures and lots of hugs. Then we go flying, or we go have picnics, or we go to Granny Molly’s and Grampy Arthur’s house to see all my aunts and uncles and cousins because boy do we have a big family. But my favourite is when my dads let me watch a movie. We sit in here with our jammies and eat popcorn and cuddle.”
Jonathan winks again and shrugs. “She’s got some tricks up her sleeve.”
“Thank you so much for telling us how you’re feeling, Teddy,” Harry leans forward and scratches behind Troggy’s ears while he talks. “You can always come to one of us, or to both of us, any time. Day or night. Rain or shine. We’re here for ya, kiddo.”
“I suppose I’m open to something different,” Draco responds, looking cautious.
They broke apart and stood staring, holding each other at arm’s length. Draco heard the sound of a throat clearing and he sprang away from Potter, brushing invisible dirt from his coat in an effort to look calm and collected, despite feeling anything but.
“Harry,” Draco barely enunciated the word, letting it fall from his lips in an exhalation. Draco took Harry’s glasses off of him and tossed them onto an ottoman. “I need you to touch me, right now.”
Saul shook his head. “Not me. Muggle through and through. Sophia’s got all the magic in the family.” He smiled at Harry again, peering at him from above his spectacles.
“Yes, but why?” Draco repeated.
Jonathan joins Draco on the floor, a tear falling down his cheek. “Listen to your Auntie Jonathan, OK sweets? You are all part of the Queer Eye family now. We’ll be seeing more of each other, I know it!”
“Draco, look at me,” Harry said.
“You have a lovely home, Potter.”
Draco choked on the bite of soup he was taking. “There’s nothing to explain, Potter.”
“Oh, wait!” Harry shouted, running down the steps to catch up with them. “Will you come to seder?”
Harry raised his eyebrows and turned his head to regard Malfoy. “Cooking? Cooking is what boggles your mind about muggle life? I’ve been cooking since I was five. It’s not difficult, and it can be enjoyable.”
Harry rolls his eyes, but then looks at Draco fondly. “I’ll call Kingsley tomorrow and see what I can do.”
When he was at the deli, Harry felt relaxed and comfortable in a way that he hadn’t felt since he arrived at Hogwarts as an eleven year old. He didn’t feel pressured to talk about the war during the long hours he spent eating soup and learning how to make knishes. Instead, Saul would tell Harry stories about growing up in Germany and working in his father’s deli, about summers spent swimming in lakes and climbing trees. He would speak quietly and fondly about his large, loud family that didn’t make it out of the camps, sometimes stroking the numbers tattooed on his forearm absently while he described his little sisters. He talked about life with Sophia after the war, about coming to England and opening the deli. He talked about what it was like to discover the existence of magic, and how hard it had been for Sophia to leave the wizarding world behind. He talked about forgiveness, and he talked about healing.
“Nah, we have a few employees these days. When Gin and I first split, though, it was just me and Saul. Sophia had only passed away the month before, and to be honest it was a mess. Saul is there, though - he never misses a day.” Harry poured water from the kettle an antique-looking teapot and settled a lacy tea cosy over it. “Earl Gray or something without caffeine?”
Harry deflated and sat back on his heels. “I...err… no? I want to marry you. Is that insane?”
“Scorpius, I said that I’d talk to Harry about having a sleepover. Please don’t twist my words,” Draco said, looking apologetically at Harry.
“It’s OK Harry, ‘Dad bods’ are in!” yelled George from across the table.
“You’re not staying?” Harry said, furrowing his brow.
Possibly ever again.
“Matzo ball soup,” she responded, sitting in the chair next to Saul. “It’s the best cure for an empty stomach, and it does wonders for the soul.” She gestured for Harry to eat, and he took a small bite. It was heavenly. Harry began to eat quickly, relishing in the salty warmth of the soup. He looked up and saw Saul and Sophia smiling fondly at him and sat up, belatedly realising that he was hunched over the bowl and was practically shoveling the food into his mouth.
“Harry, let’s start with you. Why don’t you show us your wardrobe?” Tan says, moving towards the door. “I want you to take us through your current clothing and tell me all about how you choose what you’re going to wear on any given day.”
“You know, I think I only understand about half of the things you say.”
“What?” Teddy says, looking up from where he’s feeding the dog bits of meat off of his sandwich. “I don’t think I’m in charge of anything at home except keeping my room clean and minding Trogs and helping with chores.”
“It seems like this room is the focal point of your home,” Bobby says loudly, apparently trying to change the subject. “I think we could do so much with this space. It’s huge, for one thing, and these windows are amazing. And look at that antique chandelier! I can’t wait to get started!”
“Love, do you still think I’m going to chuck you out someday? Just up and say, ‘oh well, thanks for the delightful shags and I appreciate the help parenting those kids but, ciao!’?” Harry had apparently heard Draco’s last words and he sat down at the table, taking Draco’s hands in his own.
Lily’s face turned almost as red as her hair and she yelled, “I’m a superhero! They don’t wear dresses!”
“It’s just that we wanted a few days to get used to the idea before we told anyone!” Cried Harry at the same that Draco burst out with, “we’re not engaged!”
“Well if you’d come with us last month to the lecture on 1980’s muggle popular culture in North America then you’d also be in on the joke!” Hermione and Draco were both giggling now.
“Oh ye of little faith! Tan taught me well. Actually, is it too cold out for this shirt?” Harry asks, holding his arms and turning slowly on the spot, letting Draco inspect his outfit. “Where’s that cardigan?”
“I do,” Harry replied, crossing his arms over his broad chest. He was wearing a faded green shirt with the Harpies logo splayed across the front, the thin material hugging his biceps in a way that made Draco’s throat go a bit dry.
“Wait, we’re moving in together?” Harry asks, his cheeks flushing.
“I know who you are!” Ron says, recognition crossing his freckled face.”Fred and George tried to convince you to sell them your tailoring spells so they could get their line of joke-clothing off the ground in their last year at school. They desperately wanted to be able to make Umbridge’s cardigans explode or maybe eat her? I don’t really remember. But they ranted about you for ages.”
Draco lifted his head off of Harry, and bit his lip, giving himself a few tugs before collapsing next to Harry. “I want you to prepare me, Harry. You need to take your time, giving me at least three fingers and making sure I’m nice and open before you fuck me. OK?”
“It’s wonderful that Satan’s given you the day off to help us celebrate Hannukah,” Hermione replied.
Harry groaned and pressed Draco back against the edge of the table. Draco felt Harry try to take control of the kiss but he scratched his nails up Harry’s clothed back and he melted against him, ceding control. Draco put his hands in Harry’s messy locks and felt his stomach flip. His head felt simultaneously full and empty: he couldn’t fully comprehend the fact that he was actually messily snogging Harry Potter in his lab. He pulled at his hair lightly, trying to ground himself and make sure that he was present for this experience and not lost in his own head. He pulled back from the kiss and took a deep breath, letting his forehead press against Harry’s. He didn’t open his eyes.
Draco groaned around Harry’s dick and stroked himself roughly. Harry increased the speed of his thrusts and for a few minutes the only sounds in the lab were the wet slapping of skin and occasional moans of pleasure.
Hermione reached for her drink and gasped. “Draco. Lucius. Black. Malfoy.” She enunciated each syllable of his name with narrowed eyes. “I better not be seeing what I think I see on your hand. Because that would mean that you, one of my closest and dearest friends, was engaged to the other of my closest and dearest friends, who had not deigned to tell me, the godmother of two of their children, that they’re getting married. Because that would be outrageous and would cause me great angst.”
“Do you not have a dress code at work?”
“Wow, what a good start to your day!” Bobby says.

“See?” Pansy said, preening. “I’ve a gift Blaise. And you’ll be reaping the benefits, I’m sure. Last year I found tiny pieces of gold foil from the gelt around the house until at least March.”
I snort. “Of course I am.”
“Do it. Come for me,” Harry breathed into his ear, flexing his thighs and clenching his arse to thrust more deeply into Draco.
“Weinberg’s, innit? Lunch rush and all. Worth the wait though,” he responded, wrapping his arms around himself and stomping the ground. “Colder than a witch’s tit today, eh mate?”
“And, I’ve been in love with him for the past seven years.” Harry’s cheeks turn bright red. “Oh, Merlin. This is going to be on bloody television!”
oOoOoOoOoOo
“I think that this is a good conversation, actually,” Karamo interjects brightly. “Harry, Draco, have you been practising what we talked about at the park? About showing your family that you love them with your words and actions?”
Draco stared at Harry with his mouth hanging open.
“Cooking isn’t menial labour. It’s a basic life skill, like brushing your teeth and knowing how to do laundry.”
“Erm, Jesus? Jesus Christ?”
“Mate, you OK?” Ron called out.
“Ah,” Draco replied, “I can imagine that living in a muggle area must cause some problems.”
Harry watched Draco as he hand washed the delicate serving dishes they’d used. The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to the elbows and he was humming to himself as he worked. After seeing the last guests out, Harry had gone upstairs to check on the boys. Despite their fervent declaration that they would stay up all night, both Albus and Scorpius were fast asleep.
[Camera shows Harry, Draco, Teddy, Karamo and Antoni standing in front of the large butcher-block island in the kitchen with an array of ingredients laid out in front of them.]
Harry doesn’t reply for a few moments, and Jonathan returns to cutting his hair. Finally, Harry says, “You do know my name isn’t Harold Amelia Bedelia ...whatever else you said, right?”
Draco huffs indignantly and Harry chuckles. “Fair enough!” he says.
Harry’s eyebrows rose. “Wait, what?”
“Harry, you’ll just have to trust us on this one,” Hermione says.
Draco began to lift himself up and down on Harry’s cock while he pulled furiously at his own erection with his right hand. “Yeah, you like this Harry? Do you like it when I ride your giant cock?” Malfoy spoke to Harry while he looked directly into his eyes. “I want you to fill me up with your come, Potter.” He punctuated this statement by clenching the muscles in arse, causing Harry’s orgasm to rip through him unexpectedly. “Bloody hell!” Harry yelled, squeezing Draco’s hips with his fingers while his own jerked up and down slightly, riding out his orgasm.
“Oh no, honey,” Jonathan says, pausing in his cutting. He moves to stand in front of Draco and looks him in the eye. “Look here, madame. I know exactly who and what I am, and my show is a wonderful, beautiful light in the darkness of this crazy, often cruel world. So don’t come at me with that shade!”
“Sorry love! Too fast?” He asks, stilling his hand.
“Ladies,” interrupted Draco, “not that I don’t enjoy the entertainment, but it sets a bad example for the children.”
Harry plops down on the blanket and reaches for a sandwich. “Tuck in, Draco!”
“I love you too, Harry.” He responds.
“Queer Eye?!” Draco says incredulously from the sofa.
“Dear Mr Queer Eyes,
“OK, so our team took a leap of faith. A pretty
view.)
“Well maybe if you two weren’t so secretive there’d be nothing to cover up,” Harry said sulkily.
[The door to the bathroom opens and Harry steps out. He’s wearing slate gray chinos rolled up at the ankles and a short-sleeved, slightly fitted chambray button down.]
“Teddy is actually the son of my late cousin Nymphadora, and Harry is his godfather. When my Aunt Andromeda began displaying signs of dementia, Teddy was about a year old. Harry and I had already begun to mend our relationship, and we’d both spent quite a lot of time with Teddy.”
“There are limits to what people can do in a common room. LIMITS.”
Draco had his own towel wrapped loosely around his hips; his pale skin was flushed and his hair was finger combed but still wet and hanging in loose strands around his head. He managed to look both untouchable and incredibly alluring. Harry’s breath caught in his throat as he took in the man standing in front of him.
“Welcome to the 20th century, love,” Harry joked.
Harry almost stopped to further question Pansy, but he resolutely refused to make a bigger fool of himself than he had already done. Plus, he was still uncomfortably hard from Draco’s description of himself in lingerie…
Harry climbed out of the trench and stalked over to Draco, who was grinning smugly. He didn’t stop once he reached him; instead he bent and put his arms around Draco’s hips, heaving him up and over his shoulder in a fireman’s carry.
He had long resigned himself to pining from afar. It was, he thought, quite Byronian; he’d always had a penchant for the dramatic and his lovelife ought to follow suit. News of the Golden Couple’s divorce and Potter’s subsequent disappearance from the Wizarding World hadn’t caused Draco’s feelings to abate; if anything, the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of The Chosen One only heightened his longing.
Draco paled. “Yes, well, to be fair, I did have nefarious plans.”
Teddy smiles. “Of course!”
“We did, Teddy. Is that… OK with you?” Draco asks, uncertain. “If Harry and I were to be more affectionate with each other? Because that’s what we were talking about in private. We want to be in a romantic relationship, but if for some reason you don’t like it, then we want to talk it through. As a family.”
“You’re an absolute pleb, Harry Potter,” Draco said. “You have the social skills of Ronald Weasley. I wasn’t ‘in pain’ or in any way upset that you kissed me.”
“Nah, they’re denim! They’re made to be worn in casual situations.” Harry says around a mouthful of food.
“No, I don’t think many people want to spend much time thinking about the Weasel and Granger’s sexual activities. The time I walked into our rooms and saw them together was more information than I ever wanted.”
“Teddy, Harry and I would never be so boring as to copy something that your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron do,” Draco says calmly.
The night that his father had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, Draco had made his way through half a bottle of Ogden’s finest and then taken one of his aunt’s knives, still lodged in the wall of the manor after a round of torturing muggle born wizards, to his Dark Mark. The result was a grim mixture of pink puckered skin and the faint outlines of a skull.
I cooked for my aunt, uncle, and cousin when I lived with them. Up until the day I left for Hogwarts.”
“OK, are you ready to see your new space?” Bobby asks, his hand on the doorknob.
“Aww, ducks are so presh!” Jonathan says. “They’re precious tiny dinos!”
Malfoy started to laugh again, and pushed at Harry’s arm playfully. “Ugh, you’re almost too easy to fuck with! Takes all the fun out of it.” He cocked his head and studied Harry. “You know, you have the most expressive face. You don’t even try to hide your emotions, do you? You’d never have lasted a day in Slytherin.”
Harry could see Malfoy's arm pumping himself furiously, and he had to let go of Harry’s head to support himself against the door. “Gods, yes! Oh, fuck! Potter, don’t stop, don’t stop!” If anyone was stood outside his door right now, there would be no doubt as to their ability to hear Malfoy’s shouts. Harry’s jaw was aching but he wouldn’t have stopped for the Minister of Magic himself walking in on them.
Harry puts his forehead on the table with a
He cleared his throat again and looked at the wooden floor, searching for a new topic of conversation. “So, have Jamie and Teddy always been close?” Draco asked.
“Oh, wow,” Harry says in awe. “It looks… amazing. I look like a normal bloke!”
Harry sighed. “Honestly, I don’t know what’s next. Ever since I was eleven, I’d had a purpose, yeah? Defeating Voldemort and fighting evil. Now I feel like I’m just sort of drifting, to be honest.” He wasn’t sure why he was being so open with Malfoy, but it felt good to be able to tell this to someone who wouldn’t try to psychoanalyze him or take it upon themselves to “fix” him. He loved Ron and Hermione with all his heart, but they were never able to just listen to him. “I don’t think I want to be an Auror. I’d be perfectly happy to never cast another curse at someone for the rest of my life. But if not an Auror, then what? I’ve only ever been good at throwing myself headlong into danger. That, and not dying. Well, sort of not dying.”
“We just fucked on Pansy’s bed. I’m not sleeping in that mess. Now come over here and get to bed. I won’t allow you to keep that beautiful cock of yours more than a few centimeters away from me at all times. Also, I’m the little spoon, so adjust your cuddles accordingly.”
“Oh my god in heaven but the letter that your son wrote us actually made me cry!” Jonathan says.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Sure, Potter. And I was almost a Hufflepuff.” He got to his feet, wiping the earth from his trousers. “I’m for bed. You’d better not be too hungover tomorrow and vomit in our trench. You’d probably have to excavate it as a ‘modern intrusion’.’” He gave Harry a nod and turned to walk back to the cabins that served as their housing for the duration of the dig.
Draco snorted. “I’m glad I don’t usually smell like whatever potion I’ve been working on. I’ve a laboratory just down the street.”
“Sure, Lils,” Harry said, arranging what Draco assumed were the rugelach onto a small plate. “Here, why don’t you take some of these up to Al and Scorpius?” Lily clutched the plate with both hands as if she were carrying the finest china, and made her way slowly out of the kitchen.
“Told you we’d beat that ‘meatloaf surprise’ bullshit.” Harry felt smug.
“You’re drunk, Granger. But yes, I’m aware of my physical attributes.” Pansy brushed her perfectly trimmed black fringe from her forehead and gave Hermione a knowing smile. Harry looked over to gauge Ron’s reaction to this interaction between his girlfriend and the Slytherin, and saw Ron looking at the two of them with a dopey smile on his face.
“You could’ve sent an owl.”
“I’m almost four, Albus! And you don’t hafta be careful with me I’m big for my age! Right, Dad?” Lily looked beseechingly at her father.
The group stands outside of Draco’s bedroom door, waiting for the reveal.
Harry turned to look at Draco and smiled. He leaned in to be heard over the din of the dining room and replied, “No, thank you for coming! It’s wonderful to have you here. You’ve been such a help - I don’t know what I’d have done without you tonight.”
There were twelve different sections in the binder, each denoted by a large, labeled tab. The menu, guest list, decorations - everything had been meticulously thought out and then organized and stored. Given this experience, Harry was sure that Draco would be a complete nutter when it came to planning a wedding.
“Not since 1998,” he says cheekily.
Harry held his hand out and a few moments later a bottle smacked into his palm. He smiled and held it out to Draco, but he shook his head at Harry. “That’s for you.” He may not have ever fucked a man before, but Harry knew the spells they needed before penetrative sex. He waved his hand and cast safety and gentle cleaning charms. Draco yelped a bit. “Warn me before you go cleaning out my arsehole! Salazar, Potter. Manners!” Draco smacked Harry’s arm lightly before he leaned down and took Harry’s left nipple into his mouth, simultaneously using his other hand to gently twist his right nipple between his fingers, eliciting a gasp from Harry. He moved sinuously down Harry’s chest and stomach, licking and sucking until he reached the hard length of Harry’s cock. Draco grabbed the base with his hand and licked a hot strip from fist to tip. Harry hissed in pleasure, his hips jerking up.
Harry sighed and continued his task. “I don’t think the kids will lack topics to discuss with a therapist, Draco.”
“Since I was
“That’s very impressive, honey!” Ginny said, giving her daughter a high five. “Where are your brothers?”
. He made a mental note.
Draco then addressed the three boys sitting across from him, asking if they had been bullied at school because of their fathers’ relationship.
children.”
[He flicks his wand and the door opens to reveal a large, untidy bedroom, which the group quickly fills. His bay windows look out onto the street and are draped with heavy dark red velvet curtains that are pulled back to allow natural light to flood the room. The walls are painted a creamy white and are cluttered with framed photographs and random drawings clearly made by a child. An old four-poster queen-sized bed has been hastily made, done up with linens in dark reds and golds. A pile of books and a half-drunk glass of water sit on a nightstand. A dilapidated wooden dresser stands unevenly in one corner.]
Teddy grabbed Jamie’s hand and kissed his knuckles, smiling up at him from where he was seated. “I promise that I see you as more than a friend, now!” Teddy exclaimed, laughing.
Al and Scorpius shared a nervous glance and Jamie rolled his eyes.
Dr Song claimed that the trench pairings were done randomly, but Hermione had pointed out that everyone was grouped with someone they’d had a “tetchy past” with. She was paired with Pansy Parkinson, Ron was paired with Tony Goldstein, Neville with Millicent Bulstrode, Lavender with Blaise Zabini, Padma with Terry Boot, and of course, Harry with Malfoy. Surprisingly, at least to Harry, all of the other teams seemed to compliment each other’s working style well. No other pair had screamed at each other or requested a different partner.
“OK, so, Harold! Tell mama what’s going on with this mop. I mean, obvi the unruly curls are your trademark, but what’s the deal with this gravity-defying ...thing?” Jonathan finishes with a question. He’s stood behind Harry, who’s sitting in a stylist’s chair, looking at him through the large mirror that’s on the wall opposite.
“Oh Ronald, you know you have nothing to be ashamed of in that department.” Hermione beamed back at her boyfriend, falling forward as she tried to pat his hand.
“Ummm, ok so Harold? Eyes back here. Just because you’re stumbling through your morning routine doesn’t mean that your skin and hair have to suffer. We’re going to get you fixed up to glow like the bronzed god that you already are, under all that scruff. Maybe Mal-Mal will make you some more personalized products, hmm?”
“No, Trogs!” Teddy yelps.
“Hullo there. I’m Harry. Yes, I knew your papa when we were younger. We went to school together. I’ve been to Paris, but it was just once and it was a long time ago. I remember quite enjoying the chocolate crepes.”
. This is
“To my recollection, your animosity at Hogwarts was legendary. I only overlapped a few years, but I remember a few rather intense quidditch matches and the rumour of an illegal duel?” Tan remarks. “What changed? Was it Teddy?”
Harry shrugs. “Err, mornings I splash some cold water on my face, brush my teeth the muggle way, and I usually shave using a muggle razor as well. If I’m running late I use a charm. Draco makes me that salve,” he points to a blue glass bottle “to put on after I shave. It’s excellent and smells like lemons. And at night, I brush my teeth before bed.”
“Oh, so you won’t be having sex,” Lily said, kicking her slippered feet against the wall.
The bespoke lingerie that I invested in looks amazing (and took an absolute age to get on correctly—how Muggles manage this many buckles and straps without magic is beyond my comprehension), and I try to hold my pose and school my features into my best “come hither” expression. I hold my breath as the doorknob turns and Harry enters.
“Yeth he did!” Lily yelled, not taking her thumb out of her mouth before shouting at her brother.
As Harry gently fucked in and out of his mouth, Draco reached down and freed his own aching cock from the confines of his pants.
Saul leaned forward and smiled. “Oh what terrible manners we have! We speak Yiddish to each other. Nevermind us old folks, Harry. We’re wool gatherers, the lot of us.” The twinkle in his eye again reminded Harry so strongly of Dumbledore that it took his breath away momentarily.
Draco’s cheeks darken a bit, but he responds quickly to Harry. “I am never overly dramatic. I am only ever the proper amount of dramatic.”
[Scene cuts back to the Potter/Malfoy residence, where Teddy is fast asleep on the sofa surrounded by unwrapped presents. Draco and Harry sit on either side of him.]
“Kreacher makes me breakfast in the kitchen while Draco has coffee and we listen to our morning music and sometimes we dance to get all of our wiggles out. Then Harry comes down because he’s not a morning person like Draco so he’s always a bit late but he makes sure I’m at school on time before he goes to work at the Ministry of Magic.
Malfoy looked at Harry in bewilderment before answering, “I am completely sincere when I say this, Potter. I do not give a single fuck what you make for dinner. I’ve never cooked in my life, and I’m certainly not starting in this hovel.” He sighed dramatically and threw himself into a small chair near the doorway.
The heavy wooden door swung open, and there stood a slightly harassed looking Potter holding Lily on one hip. She sniffled but smiled at Draco.
“What’s a... a gentile?” Harry asked, remembering that Saul had called him that when he first sat down.
“Oh just go with it, Malfoy.” Harry pats him on the shoulder. “It’s for Teddy. Follow me!” he says to the group, pushing up from the sofa.
“Err, well, the Dursleys were… I mean, my uncle was quite… rough with me when I was a child.” He glances at Teddy, who’s looking at Harry with wide eyes. “But, once I got to Hogwarts, people hugged me all the time. Hermione was constantly doing it, and even Ron would when we said goodbye for summers.”
When he finally came to the front of the queue, he decided to take his chances with the Roonil and added a side of “Harry’s curry potato salad.” His order was taken by a rather burly man with a thick brown beard and a warm smile, wearing a button down shirt with the name “Dudley” embroidered over the left breast. The chef kept to the kitchen, apparently, as after a five minute wait Draco saw a disembodied, tanned hand push a brown sack through a small window behind the register. “I’ve got one Roonil Wazlib with a side of Harry’s potatoes?” The man at the register called through the crowd. Draco came forward to claim his order, and hastily made his retreat back to his lab to enjoy his lunch.
Malfoy put his hand up for Harry to stop talking and shut his eyes. “I’m perfectly fine, thank you. Just going to get into bed. Goodnight, Potter.” He flicked off the lights, leaving only the light of the moon in the cabin.
“Well, I for one could’ve done without having the international wizarding community see my floundering love life used as television fodder,” Draco asserts, bending his head back to look up at Harry.
“Draco Malfoy. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
________________
Draco takes in his own appearance. He’s wearing fitted, ankle-length tan chinos and a navy-striped cashmere crewneck sweater with brown leather penny loafers. “I suppose it could be worse.”
Jonathan winks.
Granger’s eyebrows were now making a valiant effort to disappear into her hairline. She looked absolutely shocked.
Malfoy continued to laugh. “You can sleep in Pansy’s bed tonight, you hapless oaf. She’s sharing with me, but I’m sure she won’t mind.” Malfoy finally stopped laughing and Harry looked over at him.
A few moments pass before the door clicks open. Draco enters and slams the door behind him.
“But of course you didn’t stay gone. You and Hermione started faffing about, solving ages-old problems and making huge strides in potions and healing. You opened yourself up to learning all about Muggle science and I was blown away. Not to mention the way that Hermione would chatter on about you, particularly after Gin and I split, extolling your analytical mind and never forgetting to share just how witty and hilarious you are. If I didn’t know better, I’d say that she was on to my obsession with you a bit before I was aware of it.”
A knock at the bedroom door causes the two to jump apart. Harry’s eyes widen as he looks directly at the camera. “Bloody hell, I completely forgot the world was watching us!”
Scorpius and Al entered the room then, whispering furiously to each other before nodding and approaching the end of the table where Harry and Draco sat.
[Camera pans around Hampstead Heath. It’s partly cloudy, but the sun shines through in patches. The park is dotted with groups of people: families sitting together, kids flying kites, dogs playing fetch. Karamo and Teddy, who’s holding Troglobite’s lead, wave at Harry and Draco, who approach their checkered red and white blanket and picnic basket.]
“Believe me when I say I know what you’re going through, sweetie. But you can’t live your life being afraid of your own shadow! From what I’ve heard, you’ve already dealt with buckets of darkness and it’s time for you to get some sunshine-y goodness up in here!” Jonathan pats Draco on the arm and moves back behind him to continue cutting his hair. “Plus, mama ain’t blind! I see how you two are around each other. And the viewers at home won’t need to hear you say you’re in love with him when they’ll be able to see it for themselves.”
“Harry? Harry. Look at me.”
“Do you promise we can have a sleepover soon?” Al asked his dad, a serious expression on his face.
“I’m Tan France, it’s such an honour to meet you two!” Tan moves to hug Hermione and Ron next. “I’m sure you don’t remember me, but I was in the same class as your brother Percy at Hogwarts. I’m a Ravenclaw, but we did suffer through double potions together for two years straight.”
Draco fought a smile and Harry tried to cover his bark of laughter by faking a cough. “Go ahead, Scorpius,” Draco replied seriously.
Harry leaned over and licked up a bit that was resting on Draco’s lip.
“I said that I wasn’t upset that you kissed me. I’m not currently upset that you kissed me. I was and am angry that you kissed me and then immediately apologised for it, looking for all the world like you deeply regretted your actions.”
“You know,” she said when they’d reached the door, “I think you might consider sending Ron that letter. He wouldn’t see it as an inappropriate medium, and to be honest he might actually hex you on sight. I’ll put in a good word, but I think it would help. And as for Harry, well...” she sighed and waved a dismissive hand in front of her. “He’s always been a bit ... odd ... when it comes to you. I know his testimony on behalf of you and your mother was important, though. You might want to send him an owl, too. He’s not much for confrontation these days.” She smiled at Draco. “You’ve changed, Draco Malfoy. I never thought I’d ever want to see you again, but honestly I’m so glad I have. As loathe as I would’ve been to admit this yesterday, you were my only real competition in our year.”
“Oh, my,” Draco says, awed. He enters the room and spins around slowly, taking it all in.
“Yeah, mate. Trust us.” Ron smiles conspiratorially.
” I request quietly. Of the two of us, he is by far the more vocal in bed (or in office). I’ve often wondered what the hordes of witches who
“Hey, no! I didn’t mean to dampen the mood, Draco,” Harry insisted. “I guess I just thought that, well, we could sort of, err… move past it?”
“Well, that was a success,” Harry says, stretching out his arms and legs and yawning widely.
“Excuse me, but what are you queueing for?” he asked one of the young men he almost walked into moment before.
[The camera takes in the sitting room of the Potter/Malfoy residence, which is now covered with tarps and has a small construction crew at work.]
Harry rolled his eyes, but allowed himself a small chuckle. “Will you still have to have an arranged marriage, even if you do get your Potions Mastery?”
“I’ll just come with you now, if that’s OK.” Harry stood up with him, draining the last of his wine. Malfoy nodded and began walking away from the fire.
“Yeah, it’s quite good,” Teddy says, considering. “So then I go to school and at school, it’s OK but not as good as at home. I have to learn maths and how to write, and it’s really hard work. But then Draco picks me up from school and we have tea and sometimes we visit Harry at work.
Harry blinks at the knickers that he’s still clutching in his hands. “They’re so...
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry, gently this time. “Thank you, Harry,” he said quietly.
Karamo clears his throat, looking between the two men with raised eyebrows. He turns to the little boy standing nearby. “So, Teddy! Tell me about a day in your life. Why did you nominate your dads to be on Queer Eye?”
“Yes, but then you wouldn’t have been able to impress the entire school with your corporeal patronus as a preteen, then would you?” Draco’s cheeks were red - he could feel them flushing. He remembered being scared half to death by that stag charging at him.

I emerged from the bathroom to find my husband holding the pair of lacy knickers Pansy had gifted to me in his hands, with a flush on his cheeks and neck, and an erection tenting his threadbare joggers.
“Well do it somewhere else! I don’t need to be seeing your arse every time I look up from the table while I’m…studying! Yes, STUDYING!” Harry moved his hands to his hips, and glared at the other boy.
The dark lace runs up and down his flushed cock, and I am
“Well,” began Al, “Jemma Goldblum said that her mum talks about Dad at home a lot, wondering how he could be happy partnered up with a Death Eater. And a few other boys have made jokes about you, you know, being -”
“Oh? What do we do in your dreams?” Harry said, the pitch of his voice dropping.
Harry groaned and unwound their towels, letting them drop to the floor, so that they were both standing naked and half hard in the middle of their bedroom. Draco broke the kiss to cast a quick locking charm to the door and a muffliato before returning to Harry’s lips.
A few minutes later Jamie Potter came running into the kitchen clutching an envelope to his chest. “Dad, can I use Skops to send this?”
He opened the door to his and Ron’s room and was rendered speechless at the sight before him. Ron was standing behind Pansy, sucking on her neck with one hand up her shirt, the other tangled in Hermione’s hair. Pansy had Hermione backed up against the wall, her hand in Hermione’s knickers and a wicked smile on her face.
“Did you have fun today?” Draco said, ignoring his son’s comment. He didn’t feel like he had the emotional capacity to at the moment to allow himself to think that Harry Potter enjoyed spending time with him.
“I wasn’t going to do this until the weekend, but I think I should now. I mean, I want to. Not should. I’m so sure of this, and I need you to understand where I am with you.” Harry ran across the room, threw open the door to the closet, and disappeared from Draco’s view.
Teddy pets Troglobite, who’s clouded eyes are looking around curiously. “Um, I dunno. I mean, I just… I just want them to be happy with me and with our life together. I don’t want them to think that they were happier before they took me in.” Teddy keeps his gaze on Trogs.
Draco shook his head, trying to force the thoughts from his mind.
“Oh, please!” Hermione shot back. “You and Ron have been sharing secret jokes since we were in first year!”
Harry smiles and shrugs in response, scratching at his stubble-covered jaw. “I tried for the first fifteen or so years of my life to tame it in some form, but it’s never done anything except...this.” He waves his hand at his head.
Harry smiled. “Have you noticed that when you’re annoyed with me you go back to calling me ‘Potter’?”
“And why would I ever need to know how to
“Did you leave after the first war with Voldemort?” Harry asked, finally taking a bite of the rugelach. It was sweet and crunchy and perfect.
“Harry James Potter you let me into the bathroom this instant!” Draco shouts.
“Dad I already set the table! What more do you want?!” Jamie complained from his place on the sofa. “I think you and mum only had children so that you wouldn’t have to do chores any more!”
“Hey! I was almost sorted into Slytherin!” Harry jumped to defend himself against Malfoy’s accusations.
__________
Hermione looked up from her Transfiguration essay, sighing. After four days straight of this, she knew what that sound meant.
Suddenly Malfoy began to laugh. “Salazar, Potter. Untwist your knickers! I’m just having some fun.” Harry gave a half-hearted chuckle and took another drink.
After a few moments, Harry cleared his throat. “Have you ever heard of the idea of a soulmate?”
“Of course I want to be their other father,” Draco said, lifting his gaze to meet Harry’s bright green eyes once again. “I just... I don’t know. I suppose I don’t want to raise my hopes up only to be disappointed. But I love your children. I love
Harry nods. “Go ahead and try.”
“Well, maybe a Healer could transfigure the right bits. Is that what two wizards do when they want to have a baby?” Scorpius asked and turned to face Harry and Draco.
Draco couldn’t help the bark of laughter that escaped him. Potter? Hugging him? In the middle of a muggle deli? For a moment he was worried that he’d passed out in his lab and would be slapped awake at any moment.
“Sorry?” Draco looked up, confused.
Harry’s tongue suddenly stopped and Draco looked behind him. Harry had his eyes squeezed shut and he was holding the base of his dick tightly, breathing heavily. “Good God Draco I almost came. The mouth on you.”
Harry rolled his eyes and Draco huffed indignantly. “I knew that woman was after you, Harry. She’s always leering at you and staring at your arse.”
“I asked you something a few years ago, but you didn’t give me an answer and instead you chucked me out of your house and so I haven’t brought it up again.” Draco frowned, trying to remember the reasons behind the handful of times he and Harry had had such big rows that he’d banned him from his Knightsbridge home. Perhaps Harry wanted to try bondage again? He hadn’t seemed too put out when Draco admitted he didn’t fancy being tied up, and he certainly hadn’t kicked Harry out over it. But what else could Harry have hidden in his gym bag, if not ropes? Maybe a riding crop?
“This is so wicked!” Teddy yells, falling onto a large cushion and gazing up at the sky.
Jamie scoffed. “I know there isn’t anything wrong with being gay. Or with loving who you want to love. But just because we know that it doesn’t make people stop bugging us at school.” Jamie spoke quietly, still not looking up at the rest of his family.
“Papa, what’s a schmuck?” asked Scorpius.
Draco opens his mouth to respond, but Jonathan claps his hands together and shouts, “Let’s get this party started!”
Just then the silver door swung open again and Sophia came bustling out holding a large, steaming bowl in front of her. She approached to the table and set the bowl in front of Harry, who looked down and saw golden broth with three large, sandy coloured balls sitting in it. “Oh. Thank you. What is this?” Harry asked, picking up the spoon that Sophia had put next to the bowl.
that was inscribed on the inside of the band. He’d actually asked Draco to marry him after the first night they’d spent together, but Draco had gotten incredibly cross and shouted about “oxytocin” and “idiot Gryffindors” and kicked him out of his bed entirely for another week. Harry had realized he’d made a grievous error - not in asking Draco to marry him - but in not having the patience to first make Draco understand that Harry was completely and totally gone over him and wanted to be his forever.
Teddy smiles and hugs Harry, then climbs over him and hugs Draco. “I love you too, dads.”
“Al, you know that just because you didn’t say the words doesn’t mean that you didn’t imply that Lily wasn’t allowed. Do you remember what the word ‘imply’ means?”
(And yes, of course I’m familiar with the Judeo-Christian worldview. I’m a wizard, not an illiterate.)
Harry laughed. “Draco. Open your damn eyes you plonker.”
[Scene cuts to Harry and Draco’s new bedroom, where the pair are getting dressed.]
“...can’t take it back. You said what you said and I need to know - I
“Potter, you wound me,” Draco drawled, cradling his wine glass in his long fingers. “Are you implying that at fifteen you didn’t long for our offspring to socialise?”
“You heard me, Mr ‘I pretend that I don’t understand Ms Jonathan’s questions but I know perfectly well what she’s implying’!”
A few catcalls and cheers rang out around the room, while a lone voice yelled “bloody hell! You’re getting married?! Fucking cheers, boys!”
Draco smiled and dried his hands. “I’m happy to help. Thanks again for inviting us.”
“Thank you for sharing that with me, you two. I think that what we have here is a difference in communication styles.” Karamo says gently. “And how we can rectify this is to simply be more vocal with our feelings, and more giving with our physical signs of love. For example, how does it make you feel when you hear Teddy say that he’s nervous you might not want him anymore?”
over the two of them.
Draco chuckled and leaned back against the sink, his arms braced behind him. “In all seriousness, Harry, this has been an absolutely wonderful evening.”
Harry opened his mouth to protest, to tell Dr Song that truly, he and Malfoy got on infinitely better than they ever had in the past seven years of their acquaintance, but he hesitated. True, they’d shared a quad-room in the Eighth Year boys’ dormitory (with Ron and Blaise) for the past 7 months without either of them dying at the other’s hand, had gone 5 months without hexing each other, and even gone for the past 3 months without insulting the other’s family, but they weren’t mates. Although, they certainly weren’t enemies anymore. Harry didn’t know what they were, but “arch nemeses” didn’t fit the bill. Really, they’d come so far.
Karamo looks down at the paper again. “Ummm...yes?”
“Thank you, for this.”
again! This is rigged!” Shouted Dudley, tossing a chocolate coin into the pot in the middle.
Harry let out a half groan, half squeak. “That’s it, Malfoy. I’m done messing about. Up you get.”
Harry, Scorpius, and Al entered the kitchen in time to hear this last question. Draco looked imploringly at Harry, willing him to answer their daughter and spare him the inevitable barrage of follow-up questions.
Harry blushes and Draco shoots Jonathan a glare.
Draco rolled his eyes and waved his hand dismissively. “As if I’d be the one to hurt him. He’s too good for me, and I’ll hold on as tightly as I can to that delightful arse of his for as long as he’ll have me.”
“I know!” Teddy looks at Karamo. “I know my dads love me. They write it in my birthday cards and Harry said it to me on Christmas.”
“Speak for yourself henny! I know who Harry Potter is,” Jonathan flicks his hair behind his shoulder. “Those green eyes and that iconic scar? Come through round spectacles! My cousin had like a thousand posters of him in his room.”
Harry smiled, looking equal parts relieved and disappointed. “I suppose I owe you from the aftermath of George’s birthday last month.”
“I can’t speak for Harry,” Jonathan says, continuing to snip here and there with his shears. “But from where I’m standing, what you two have going on is not one-sided. Have you ever thought about telling him you like-like him with your whole heart?”
Quick as a flash, Hermione’s entire demeanor changed. She launched herself at Harry and Draco, drawing them both into a tight hug. “Oh this just makes me so happy! I can’t believe it. I mean, I can believe it, of course, you two have been dancing around this since we were sixteen.”
Harry nodded and tilted his head to kiss Draco, clutching at his shoulders and pulling him closer. Draco responded by opening his mouth and licking into Harry’s, wrapping his arms around his arse and pressing their groins flush against each other.
(He once told me that, after defeating old Voldy, his relationship with magic had changed. He’d gained a new confidence, which translated to an increase in the power and ingenuity of his spells. “I can’t explain it, exactly,” he’d said, “but I just sort of know I can do it. I imagine what I’m going to do, and, uh… it happens.”
“Of course, Harry.” Draco responded, not looking up from the table.
Now, face to face with the object of his affection, Draco was unable to move. The telltale tingling in his fingertips began, and he had to remind himself to take deep breaths.
“Yes, Al. Draco and I will figure out a time that you two can have a sleepover.” Harry knelt to the floor. “Now give me hugs and kisses. All three of you!”
Teddy shrugs. “My dads make me really happy. I love being a family with them, but sometimes I get afraid that they won’t always be happy with me here with them. What if I make them sad or I do something real bad and they don’t want me anymore?”
“Oh yes queen! Look at how elegant she looks!” Jonathan yells, clapping his hands. “No-maj fashion agrees with that body. Tan you’re a genius!”
Harry sprints out of the kitchen, knocking the bowl of spices to the ground in his haste.
Draco inclined his head slightly and raised one eyebrow.
“This is absolutely fantastic,” Harry says, smiling at a large picture of Teddy and Draco in front of a Christmas tree that now adorns a decorative side-table.
[Hermione interview/confession: I have to admit, the Fab Five far surpassed my expectations! I thought they had a good chance of getting Draco into Muggle clothing and I knew Jonathan would be able to do something with Harry’s hair, but I was sure we’d have to stage an intervention to get those two idiots to admit their feelings for each other. But now look at them!]
“That’s so unbelievably hot,” Harry said, pumping his hips a few more times into Draco’s mouth. “Come for me, Draco,” he said, running a finger through the spunk on Draco’s face. He pushed the finger into Draco’s mouth, and Draco felt his climax rip through him. He moaned loudly and gripped Harry’s hip for balance as he rode out his own orgasm.
“Did you bring lube?”
. Did he say something about them?]
“I don’t know why I expected anything different.” Harry didn’t turn around to address his comments to Malfoy, choosing instead to pick up a tomato and examine it. “But I’m not making food for fifteen people on my own. The least you can do is cast a chopping charm if you’re not going to help in any other way.”
“Oh, err, hello,” Harry said, his voice hoarse from disuse. He coughed a few times in an attempt to clear his throat and blinked rapidly, trying to stymie the tears that he felt welling up as visions of a long white beard and King’s Cross station came to mind. “I’ve never been here before. What do you suggest?” He felt a tear slide down his cheek and he hurriedly brushed it away.
“Manners, Scorpius!” Draco chided his son, bending to pick up the discarded clothing.
“Ok, ok. We’re engaged!” Draco replied, holding his hands up in surrender. “We had a bit of a domestic on Tuesday and then we had a long talk where Potter reiterated his undying love and affection for me and just went on and on about how I make his life better, and I felt bad for the man so I accepted his bumbling proposal.”
to know -  Harry,” Draco’s voice breaks a bit. “Did you mean what you said in the kitchen? Do you love me?”
Harry snorted, nodding his agreement. “I know, right? I imagined that we’d be untangling ancient spells placed on the graves of wizards and witches like Merlin and Morgana, and finding all sorts of cursed Druidic artifacts. Not washing bloody pottery all day.”
Harry’s eyes opened and he lifted his head, ready to deny the accusation, to yell at Malfoy, maybe even to send a stinging hex at his head. But the other boy was flushed, his cheeks pink and his breath hot on Harry’s neck; their erections were pressed together and his resolve floundered. Instead, he grabbed Malfoy’s right wrist and spun him around, reversing their positions. Harry leaned in and tilted his head, watching as Malfoy’s eyes went dark with arousal, his pupils blown wide. He took a moment to savor the feeling of having rendered Malfoy temporary silent and he reached out with his tongue, licking the other boy’s bottom lip, not yet kissing; just tasting. Malfoy opened his mouth and tried to capture Harry in a kiss, but the other boy backed his head away and licked a stripe up Malfoy’s neck, nibbling on his earlobe. Malfoy groaned and bucked his hips into Harry’s, seeking friction but finding none as Harry backed up completely.
“To my recollection, it was a toddler, a dashing young pureblood, and one gormless git,” Draco says, a small but genuine smile on his face.
“Well, I guess we weren’t fooling anyone in school, huh?” Harry laughed.
“If you’re being attacked, helping someone who’s defenceless, or if Dad breaks the toaster again,” recited all four children in unison.
Harry quit the Aurors and decided to move in with Saul to help him run the deli. He’d been as good as living there while Sophia was sick, and after the media shitstorm that happened when his and Ginny’s divorce became public he was more than happy to leave Wizarding London.
“No one would argue with you that you were a prat, Draco,” Harry said, smiling. He put one large, warm hand over Draco’s and looked at him. “I’m just saying that you weren’t some big, bad Death Eater. You heard what I testified to at your trial. I saw you struggle with what Voldemort wanted from you. You were judged, you did your penance.” Harry sat back and shrugged. “And hey, you’re good enough for Hermione to want to spend all her time with, and she’s an excellent judge of character.” Harry smiled broadly.
“So you were in a camp, err, during the Holocaust? In Germany? Or...” Harry asked, trying to remember what his muggle teachers had said. For all that he felt completely ignorant on the subject, having a conversation - connecting with people - made Harry feel fully awake for the first time in weeks.
All of a sudden Harry jerked up, dislodging Draco’s cheek so suddenly that he yelped.
“OH MY GOD I am like actually crying!” Jonathan yells.
Harry slings his arm around Draco’s shoulders and smiles at him. “Oh, come on! I’ve watched a few episodes of their show and it’s all good fun. Plus, Jonathan might finally convince you to cut this ridiculous hair.” Harry runs his hand through the long blond strands.
Draco winced and pointed his wand to his throat, saying in a magically magnified voice, “all Potter and Malfoys downstairs for WPS,
Al looked crestfallen, but Scorpius turned to him and said, “Papa said that if I am polite and helpful then we can have a sleepover! So let’s be helpful and we can have a sleepover.”
“To be honest, Harry, I have no idea what a seder is. But yes, we’d love to come.” Draco let himself answer without considering too much. He desperately wanted to see Harry again, and if he had to brave an army of Weasleys to do it, so be it.
“Are you ready, love?” he asks a few moments later, pulling his fingers out of me and reaching for the lube to wet his shaft.
“Fucking hell, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “You are so beautiful.”
Saul cleared his throat and all eyes turned to the head of the table. “I think,” he said slowly, “that we need to remember that it’s never wrong to stand up for what you know is right. You don’t always have to turn the other cheek and remain silent in the face of bullies.”
“Oh, are we telling people now?” Asked James.
The man himself is as still as a statue.
“Unfortunately, it’s time for us to bid you three goodbye!” Karamo exclaims. “I can honestly say that I can’t imagine a better way to kick off our visit to England. Working with you three has been absolutely wonderful.”
“But you and Scorpius are allowed to have some time to yourselves. You’re right.” Lily squawked indignantly. “Lily, everyone is allowed to have time away from their siblings. You and me and Jamie can do something special together while Scorpius and Al play.”
“Err, I see me? But, I look like a me who’s maybe going to a wedding. Or some other fancy affair, probably one that Draco’s dragged me to.”
“S-so,” he actually
“Well no one’s found it yet. I bet you can ask Teddy to help you look in the high-up places,” Harry said, and then lowered his voice conspiratorially, “and I’ll even give you a hint: focus on the bookshelves!”
“Gross,” Albus muttered before he grabbed Scorpius’ hand and the two fled from the kitchen.
way. Do you understand?”
After a few minutes his weight actually becomes quite uncomfortable and I have to sit up, breaking the peaceful silence in the office.
Now, though, Harry was faced with a deep ache in his chest, a new sort of yearning that he’d never felt before. It was beyond a simple erotic desire for Draco - it was a need to see him in the kitchen every day, to wake up next to him and to kiss him goodnight. To see his smile and hear his sarcasm and experience his dry wit as often as possible. It took Harry’s breath away how much he wanted.
“No, what I said was that she’s only three. And Scorpius is already five and so am I and he’s my new friend. But I didn’t actually tell her that she’s not allowed, Dad.”
Harry chuckles as he continues to mix together the ingredients that Antoni placed in front of him.
Their apparent cessation of hostilities had come to an end, however, when they were forced to share a trench during the Eighth Years’ spring trip to excavate a wizarding archaeological site in Suffolk. Dr River Song, the newly appointed Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts, had come to the post after completing her PhD in Medieval Archaeology and “traveling the universe” with her erstwhile husband. She claimed that she had always wanted to teach, and after missing both wars due to what she termed a “glitch in the space/time continuum” (the entire Eighth Year class could agree on almost nothing, save that their new professor was
A moment later the three boys came into the kitchen, all yelling at once.
“I don’t understand. I thought you were already my dads?” Teddy says, not looking up from where the papers are clutched in his hands.
“Give me another, Harry,
“He looks smashing,” Draco replies, following Teddy out of the room. “Come along, Potter!”
“You’ve never insulted me in my dreams. I suppose I’ll take the chance.” Draco allowed his eyes to flutter open, and Harry’s face came into focus.
[Harry interview/confession:
“I’m a squib!” Jonathan says and cocks his hip, looking straight at the camera. “But I don’t need a wand to perform magic! Hashtag squib-love!”
Harry reasoned to himself.
“Oh, they’re playing Aurors in Jamie’s room. They said I could play but I didn’t wanna be sat with my hands tied while they rescued me. It was boring.”
“Do you like Mr. Malfoy, Dad?” Al asked, looking horrified. “But if you date him and then you don’t stay together will Scorpius still be my friend?”
I rub my silk-encased legs against his and moan. “Do it, Harry. Please, cover me with your come.”
Draco coughed pointedly and continued, “As I was saying! The latke committee is assembling at exactly noon…”
, but perhaps we can work on adding words that are suitable for a general audience, hmm?” Draco said as he opened a cabinet to gather mugs for tea. He had to shuffle through at least a dozen other cups to find the one that he knew Scorpius would ask for: Harry had bought it for him at the London Zoo for his last birthday, and it had a large giraffe sticking out its tongue on the front.
“Saul, don’t!” said Potter, just as Saul opened his mouth to respond. “It’s not a very nice word, Scorpius. I’m sure Saul won’t repeat it, will he?” Potter gave the old man a meaningful look.
Harry laughed. “Yes. Yes it was.”
“You charmed the heart right outta me, Draco Malfoy!” Jonathan looks gleeful. “You were obvi a gorgeous hunk before, but now you’re ten, ten, tens across the board!”
[The camera flashes back to the loft]
Teddy beams and hesitates, looking at his fathers, before blowing out his candles.]
Jonathan nods and goes back to cutting. “And…?”
“I’m going to come,” Draco breathed, spellbound by the sight of them fucking that was reflected in the mirror.
“Do you, erm, still want to do this? Because I do.” Harry asked sheepishly, hoping that Malfoy’s sober mind still wanted what his drunk body clearly did.
“Are you in love with me, though? More than as … as two men who share a son and are trying to keep a family together and have thus spent many years in close proximity might love each other?”
“No, Harry, let me have my say first.” Draco finally looked up and locked his gray eyes with Harry’s. “I have no right to be angry with how you handled the situation with Lily’s school. It’s up to you and Ginny how you want to proceed with things like that, and I shouldn’t have reacted the way that I did. It won’t happen again.”
Tan mimes flipping his hair behind his shoulders, smiling. “Let’s wait and see what Mr Potter decides on wearing. He was the real challenge - once Draco saw how his own arse looked in Muggle trousers I could tell he’d never go back to those dowdy robes.”
“If that’s OK with you, of course,” Draco adds, resting a hand on Teddy’s shoulder. “We would have to go to the Ministry and answer some questions and sign some more forms. But we want you to be
“I don’t know, Scorpius. Perhaps you can ask cousin Luna. She’s always eager to discuss things with you.” Draco answered his son’s question as he read the menu, trying to remember if Scorpius was a practicing vegetarian this month. His tastes seemed to vacillate week to week. “Would you like a cheese toastie? Perhaps a bowl of soup?” Hearing no response, he looked down and saw that his son was no longer at his side. “Scorpius…?” Draco turned and saw his son approach the table by the window where the group of four sat. Two of the children had their heads bent over the table and were drawing; the oldest of the three was reading what looked at be a muggle comic and the old man was immersed in a newspaper. Scorpius stopped near the younger boy with inky black hair and lightly golden skin. Draco was immediately reminded of a miniature Harry Potter.
Draco winces but remains silent.
“Jamie, you’re going to see Teddy in less than a week for Easter hols. Do you really need to send him another letter?” Harry responded, raising his eyebrows.
Harry pulls Teddy into his lap and gives him a squeeze. “Seconded! I want you to live with me and Draco forever. Until we’re terribly old and you have to take care of us. I love you, Edward Remus Lupin. I’m sorry I haven’t said it enough. And prepare yourself for lots of hugs.”
“Harry! Don’t use magic in here! You know it makes the coffee maker wonky,” Draco admonished, going to check the status of his beloved machine.
“Ugh, you’re no fun. I’m going to sleep. We’re in cabin 4. Be quiet when you come in, I’m a light sleeper.” Malfoy yawned and made to get up.
“Schmuck schmuck schmuck!” said Lily, kicking her stockinged feet back and forth beneath the chair while she drew. Jamie snorted, finally looking up from his book.
“That’s great! Really great. I’ll send you some information to read. It’s a celebration of Passover, to commemorate the Jewish slaves leaving Egypt. I’m sure we have some kids books around somewhere that explains it all. It’s really important to Saul that we celebrate it, so it’s become a Potter tradition even though none of us are actually Jewish.” Harry smiled again at Draco. “I’ll owl you the details. See you next week!” He waved and jogged back up the cement steps to his front door.
a mistake.”
Dudley smiled. “Good choice! Served with a hug, you know.” He winked and called over his shoulder, “Harry! One Sophia!”
Harry and Draco looked at each other and then back at Hermione, guilt written across their faces.
Al ran into the kitchen then, apparently motivated to appear quickly by the sound of his friend. “Hi, Scorpius! Come on, let’s go play in my room!”
Draco’s attitude towards muggles and their world had changed drastically in the years following the war. While his father was given a life sentence in Azkaban, he and his mother were sentenced to two years house arrest and ordered to do community service with the newly formed Muggle Liaison Service. They were directed to clean up muggle parks and green spaces in an attempt, he thought, to humiliate them; they were also forced to take part in a series of seminars called “Understanding Muggles: How to Stop Thinking Like a Bigot and Start Being a Decent Human.” Despite the fact that he was forced to take the Mark in order to keep his parents alive, and despite the resentment and hatred he felt towards the Dark Lord, he had held onto the belief that had been instilled in him since he could walk: that wizards were superior to muggles in every sense.
Malfoy was smirking when Harry looked back over to him. “Oh, I’m sorry, Potter. I didn’t realise you had such antiquated views of sexual relationships.”
“Oh, well… no, I mean, would you like to have a cuppa?” Harry scratched at the back of his neck, his cheeks colouring.
“I expect your full report before we arrive back at school, gentleman!” Dr Song called out to them from where she was squatting in front of Ron and Tony’s trench. She raised her sunglasses and winked at them before turning back to her work.
Saul, still grasping Draco’s hand, beamed at him. “Ah, so this is Draco Malfoy!” Draco blanched and looked back at Potter, who had his put hands over his eyes, a blush rising on his neck. Dudley laughed again.
“Well, actually, people mostly have sex because it feels good,” Draco said, “and because it is a physical manifestation of their desire and love for one another.”
“Language! And, err…” Harry scratched his neck and looked down. “We… we were. Informed of it. The school sent an owl, but I didn’t want you to fly off the handle and make a big deal of it so I didn’t say anything. They disciplined that Vance kid, so I didn’t think there was much more to be done.”
“Well. Ok, then,” Granger shifted and leaned forward, extending her hand. “I’m Hermione Granger. Mudblood. Witch. Trainee Healer. War veteran. Daughter of parents whose minds I obliviated so thoroughly they have no idea who I am.”
Tan stands behind him and adjusts the jacket, smoothing out the lines at his shoulders. “You look like a million pounds, Harry. Every man needs a real suit, and this one fits you like a glove.”
“Hello young man,” he said in heavily accented English, sidling behind the counter. He smiled at Harry, picking up the pair of half moon spectacles that hung from the vee of his shirt and putting them on. A pair of twinkling blue eyes flashed in Harry’s memory and he felt his stomach flip. “What can I get for you today?”
“Boychick, the Malfoys are here,” Saul called. Harry’s head snapped up and he turned around to see Scorpius and Draco standing in the doorway of the kitchen. Draco was holding a bottle of wine and looking incredibly handsome in his dark gray trousers and pale blue button down. He wasn’t a flashy dresser, but Draco always looked elegant and effortless. Scorpius was a miniature Draco, wearing dress pants and a dark blue shirt, looking around the kitchen curiously.
If Harry knows anything about me, he knows that I
“I look absolutely ridiculous, Potter!” Draco hisses as he attempts to pull down on his trousers.
“What the actual fuck, Potter.” Malfoy turned to look at Harry, confusion plain on his face. “I bet we could’ve gotten her to switch partners in another day! I know Blaise would appreciate my suggestions to improve his excavation techniques.”
Jonathan waltzes across the room with Tan. “I never want to leave this room! I live here now!” Jonathan declares. “It’s so homey and perfect for your cosy family.”
His eyes widen and his jaw actually drops as if we’re in some sort of cartoon, and he just stands there, staring.
The peculiar feeling of a cleaning charm zings inside me, and before I can adjust I feel one of Harry’s long, lubed fingers breach me.
hexes.” A flush blossomed on Malfoy’s pale neck and ran up to his cheeks, and he quickly turned back to his task of ripping lettuce for salad.
Draco raised his arms in a dramatically embellished yawn, letting the hem of his shirt ride up. Harry choked. There, between the creamy white skin of Draco’s torso and the top of his khakis, was a strip of black lace. Draco was wearing knickers. Lacy. Black. Knickers.
“Ye … yes,” he tried to reply coherently as he slid to the floor, vaguely aware that Granger’s strong hands were guiding him. She conjured a glass of water and directed him to put his head between his knees. She counted breaths with him until he was able to sit up a bit and take sips of the cold water.
Teddy nods and hugs Jonathan tightly, sniffling into his long hair.
“James, if this is about the time that you walked in on me and your father…” Draco began.
Draco began explaining the schedule to the assembled group, pointing out the various ‘committees’ he had formed, when Scorpius interrupted. “Papa, did you use a computer to make this?” He asked confusedly.
Saul stood up and clapped a warm hand on Harry’s bony shoulder. “Now stop right there, boychick. We wouldn’t accept money from you! Come back and see us again, that’s all we ask. You’ve got the look of a warrior to you, Harry; you’re stronger than you know. And now that Sophia’s seen you, she won’t rest until you’ve gained at least a stone! And found a wife. And had a few children.”
Draco closes his eyes. “I suppose I understand your point.” He’s silent for a few moments before he says, quietly, “I think I’ve loved Harry since before I even acknowledged that I was gay.”
“Saul, I’m worried that your mind’s started to go. That, or you need a stronger prescription for your glasses. Malfoy wasn’t looking at me at all today.”
“I think my favorite is number 3,” he said, mouth full. “But number 7 is also good. Four is rubbish. Too much cinnamon, not enough brown sugar.” Ron judged his own apple sauces and Draco grimaced, trying to avoid being sprayed with half-masticated potato.
Draco walks back into the room and closes the door. Harry continues to look at himself in the mirror. “Are you sure I don’t look like I’m trying too hard?” he asks.
“I, no, what?” Harry spluttered.
Harry grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning spell, causing Malfoy to jump a bit, but he remained pressed against the door, waiting for Harry’s next move. Plying his cheeks apart, Harry licked into Malfoy’s arse. “Fucking hell, Potter!” Harry stopped and sat back onto his heels immediately, looking up to gauge if he had crossed a line. Malfoy pushed his arse farther towards Harry’s head, grunting unhappily. “Why’d you stop? Keep going, you tit!” Harry smiled and dove back in, swirling his tongue around the other boy’s furled entrance. He kept going, licking and sucking, adding a finger into Malfoy’s loosened hole.
Teddy shrugs. “We don’t really say that much.”
“And I hate it when you
“No, Al. I’m not mad. I just wish that you would be more considerate of your sister. You know she looks up to you.”
“No, no, boychick!” He waved his hand dismissively. “Who among us wasn’t something of a schmuck when we were boys?”
“Looks like you had a successful morning!” Karamo says. He’s reclining and wearing a black sequined bomber jacket and tight jeans. “Take a load off and join our picnic. I’m sure Tanny forced you to work up an appetite.”
leap of faith, actually, considering we started this room before you two boys got your act together and got with the smooching.” Bobby throws open the door and gestures for Draco and Harry to enter.
Harry shook his head. “No, not really. I haven’t been sleeping well lately and I don’t think coffee will help.” He chose a seat at a small, round table and sat down. “I’m Harry, by the way. But, err, you already know that.”
“Bienvenue! Welcome to my laboratory, Draco!” Jonathan says, sashaying up to his client and giving him two air kisses on either cheek. “You look positively sickening in those muggle clothes. Tanny did right by you! Now, follow me!”
Malfoy opened his mouth to protest, but closed it again after looking at Harry’s expression.
When I finally hear his voice in the corridor, I throw off the cloak and quickly arrange myself so that I’m sitting in his chair with my feet kicked up onto his desk, legs crossed at the ankles. I spare a moment to place the photo of the entire Weasley clan face down. They don’t need to watch what’s about to happen. (I turn the one of us on our wedding day to give photo Harry-and-Draco a
The two exchange a look before Harry clears his throat. “Well, err, neither of us have particularly fond memories of childhood meals before we left for school. So we make a lot of new things that none of us have ever tried, or we try and recreate some of our favorite Hogwarts meals if we’re feeling uninspired.”
“It is. Did you enjoy it?” Draco asks.
“I’ve never done that before, but I’d love to learn,” Draco says, rising to his knees and reaching for the dog’s lead. “Come along, Sir Bites a Lot. Let’s go fly a kite! And I do believe there are some sticks you might be interested in gnawing on.”
to speak French,
[The camera zooms out to show Harry and Draco walking up to Bonobos.]
Draco purses his lips in an attempt not to smile. Instead, he raises an eyebrow and waves his wand at the dresser, which deposits a pile of pants onto the bed.
“How about we sit down and talk about what happened?” Harry suggests, looking to Karamo who smiles and nods encouragingly.
“Badly,” Draco corrects absently. He sighs.
[The camera pans around a pristine bedroom, decorated with dark, ebony furnishings. The emerald green velvet curtains match the bedspread; muted silver accents adorn a large pile of throw pillows that look meticulously arranged on the bed. Three photographs decorate the mantle of a large fireplace, and the camera zooms in on each in turn: the first shows a young Draco with his parents, all three looking rather stiff and serious, the second shows an infant Teddy asleep on Draco’s chest, and the third shows Harry and a toddler-sized Teddy smiling and waving at the beach.]
“Err, Teddy,” Harry begins, “remember what we’ve talked about regarding keeping secrets from us?”
“Oh for Christ’s sake! This is ridiculous,” Harry said, huffing. He stood up from the table and dragged Draco with him, walking to the center of the room.
________________
Harry became distracted by Molly trying to start doing the dishes and forgot to further question Draco in his haste to stop her and demand she sit back and relax.
“Oh please, you luddite. Your mobile, bought circa 2001, is held together with duct tape and literal magic. I won’t be lectured by someone who can’t even figure out how to use text messaging.” Draco’s usually teasing tone was cut with acid.
Harry blushes. “It’s very experimental. Turns out that despite my heritage, I can’t handle too much spice, and recently it’s been hard to convince Teddy to eat anything that isn’t brown.”
“Oh wipe that look off your face, Harry! You look like I dumped your ice cream into the bin. I just want to ride your cock. Pull out for a second so I can get on top.”
Harry pulls out a plain-looking envelope and hands it to Teddy. “You have to open it carefully,” he explains, using his wand to magically clean Teddy’s sticky fingers. “We only have one copy of that for now.”
“Are...are you both ok? Is our family OK?” Teddy asks, leaping up from the table and running over to his fathers.
Hermione rolls her eyes and continues. “As I was saying, Harry knows, and Draco will do anything for Harry and Teddy, so once he calms down it’ll be fine. Just, be prepared for some histrionics. I have duties assigned to each of you.” She pulls out a file folder from the small beaded bag at her side and flips through several pages. “Antoni, I know you like dogs so you’ll be on Troggy duty. That dog needs to be the center of attention and if he senses that people are visiting and not giving him enough cuddles, he becomes irate and for such a small thing he can be quite persistent. Karamo, you’re in charge of managing Teddy. I know you’ve children of your own and you’re the calmest presence, other than Bobby. Teddy is going to be beside himself with happiness when he sees all of you, but if he gets overwhelmed he’ll clam up and then Draco will become a mother hen and probably banish you all to Helsinki. Tan, you’ll need to use your proper British upbringing to distract Draco himself. Compliment him, but don’t be overly complimentary or he’ll get suspicious. He’ll not have the slightest idea who any of you are as he’s afraid of Muggle technology and will only watch the telly if Harry sets it up for him. And none of you are to mention said fear of technology!”
Harry chuckled. “Well, Jamie’s always been a bit mad about Teddy. And Teddy, well, he tolerates him about as well as any pre-teen would tolerate an eight-year-old’s constant owls and requests for his attention.”
“Circe’s tits, Malfoy! Back
oOoOoOoOoOo
On a bright Sunday in mid-April, Draco was forced to bring Scorpius with him to lab to check on the progress of a new Wolfsbane draught he was working on. Draco tried to avoid bringing him to his lab - he loved his son with all his heart, but not only was Scorpius terribly clumsy, he was also a precocious child and prone to poking and prodding any and all experiments he found in the lab - so he promised him a treat in exchange for good behaviour. After he’d finished taking notes on his potions, Draco glanced at his pocket watch and was pleased to note that it was just past two o’clock in the afternoon. Weinberg’s should be open, and their lunch rush (weekends were no exception to its popularity, he’d found) over.
“I can’t believe you did this for me,” Harry says, still positioned behind me.
Draco scowled but didn’t respond.
“What?!” Harry and Draco shout in unison. Karamo laughs and Antoni raises his eyebrows.
Lily looked quite worried. “Am I a peanut, Dad? I thought that I was a human bean?”
“Dr Song, I cannot be expected to report accurate results under these circumstances. Potter refuses to follow my simple directions, and has decided to continue taking down level 3 despite the fact that we have obviously struck upon a new soil layer.”
“Nothing!” Hermione interjected, smacking her husband on the arm.
try it. Yes. Yes with the fucking.”
“Bobby, how did you do this?” Draco asks, now inspecting the antique carpet that covered much of the floor. “This rug used to be in the library at Malfoy Manor.”
“I’d do anything for you, Harry.” I used to hate how easily he drew these sorts of blunt, honest confessions from me, but I’ve made my peace with it. Besides, he’ll usually follow up my romantic and/or sickeningly loving comments with something equally sappy.
“Wait, no! I thought -” Harry began, but it was Draco’s turn to hold up his hand to stop Harry from speaking.
Malfoy bent his knees and hopped forward, rising to his full height slowly. He turned to face Harry with a scowl on his face; he was sweating lightly and a few strands of his straight hair had fallen out of place. “What the bloody hell, Potter?! I’ve told you before, this is a prescribed therapy from a licensed Healer!”
Harry smiles widely. “I’ve honestly never seen my hair look this good before. Are you sure you’re a squib?”
The chair creaks ominously, so I change tactics. While Harry is still gaping at me, I walk slowly (and carefully) to the front of the desk and lean back, letting Harry take all of me in.
“Got it. See you Thursday. Have a great match.” Harry tried to cup his hands over Lily’s ears and yelled, “Jamie! Al! Come on, we’re off!” His sons were standing close to the tracks and gazing longingly after the scarlet train.
Tan laughs. “We’ll fix that right away. Draco, you’re a tall drink of expensive bottled water and I think with your complexion, we should stay with jewel tones. How do you feel about cashmere?”
He threw open the door, not bothering to put his shirt back on. “Listen Hermione -,” he stopped midway through his sentence, completely gobsmacked to see Potter himself standing at the threshold.
Lily slapped her folder on the table across from Saul. “I know what an arse is, Dad! Jamie told me all the different words for our bums. Butt, arse, behind, bottom…” She trailed off as she opened her folder and began organizing her papers, her tongue poking out as she concentrated on her task.
[Camera pans around the London Loft, showing everyone except Antoni piled onto a large sectional sofa that’s set up in front of a huge flat-screen tv.]
“Take it, take my fat cock Draco. Fuck, yes, you love this, don’t you? You love riding me.”
Do you really think I have the power to counter a charm put up by Harry Potter?]
Harry took two steps forward and put his large, warm hands on Draco’s hips. “You’ve wanted to kiss me since we were fifteen?” He asked, smiling. “So, that bloke who you’ve been in love with ...?”
[Footage of Harry and Draco standing side-by-side in the kitchen, chopping vegetables and chatting, often looking at each other and smiling. Teddy sits at the table completing homework, while Kreacher stands in the corner muttering to himself and throwing angry glances at the camera.]
. Sorry, what was the question?]
Harry emerged from the closet clutching his blue nylon gym bag and looked suddenly nervous. He approached Draco again, returning to his knees in front of the chair where the other man was still sitting, waiting for Harry to clarify whatever it was he was doing.
“Aww, you think I’m adorable?” Harry teased, stripping off his shirt.
Scorpius nodded. “And we’ve been very polite to the adults and didn’t exclude the little kids even once! We even found the afikomen with Rose but we let Hugo and Lily find it again so they could get the prize.”
He adds a third finger and scissors them, loosening me up for his thick cock.
“Why did you run away after you told Draco you loved him?” Teddy demands once he’s again seated at the table. His face is scrunched up into a grimace. “You’re not supposed to leave a room until a discussion is finished,” he admonishes.
“They don't need to see these, Draco! You wanker!” Harry yells, flailing at the flying underwear.
“Non, papa! Ça ne gênera personne!”
The old man moved to take his usual seat at the large oval table on the far end of the kitchen that functioned as their dining area. He pulled out his half-finished crossword puzzle and looked around in search of his spectacles.
“And what about on the weekends?” Karamo asks, smiling.
[Scene cuts to Draco, hair wet and wearing a salon cape, again seated in the chair with Jonathan standing behind him.]
Just then Lily and Hugo came running into the dining room, waving the afikomen in front of them and squealing with delight. “WE GOT IT, ZAYDE!” said Lily, climbing onto her grandfather’s lap with little regard for his personal space. Saul winced as Lily’s knee connected with his stomach.
“Jamie!” Potter admonished.
He thought about the quote that hung near the door every day, wondering how to choose his own way after a lifetime of being led by prophecies and other men’s plans.
He would be lying, of course. The most irritating aspect of moving one’s life from Paris to London in the dead of winter was the fact that he was doing it at all. But Astoria had fallen in love and wanted to relocate to London. In order to maintain a stable environment for their five year old son Scorpius to grow up in, Draco and Astoria agreed to share custody and both live in London. They purchased adjoining townhomes in Knightsbridge and found a suitable wizarding primary school for Scorpius to attend. He felt that it was the least he could do for his now ex-wife, as she had agreed to marry him in the first place nearly ten years ago, perfectly aware of the fact that Draco was marrying her for her uterus and was otherwise utterly uninterested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her. Not that Astoria was upset about this, as both she and Draco were bent as corkscrews. But for a decade familial obligations had won out. Then Astoria had been reintroduced to Millicent Bulstrode at her yoga retreat in Tahiti and the rest was, as they say, history.
“Two sugars, no milk, right?” Harry said, bringing the tea tray over to the table.
Throughout the day people had popped in and out of their house to drop off this or that, and inevitably heard the news. Dudley arrived to a loud argument between Hermione and Pansy regarding colour schemes for the wedding; Molly and Arthur - with Hugo and Rose in tow -  floo’d in just in time to see Dudley sobbing uncontrollably at the news and were worried that someone had died; Ginny had come running in clutching a letter, demanding to know why Albus had asked her if marriage meant that his two dads would be keeping their jobs or if they would instead be having sex full-time; and Narcissa arrived in silence, cooly requesting that Draco explain why Pansy Parkinson had owled her earlier in the day to inquire about the Black family’s ancestral china pattern.
Harry obeyed Draco’s directions, and a few moments later Draco was lowering himself back onto Harry’s dick, his head thrown back in pleasure. “Oh Circe, Harry! Your cock is magnificent.”
“And, right, sorry for the mess. We’re in the midst of a renegotiation of chores.” Harry tried to set Lily down but she let out a cry and clutched at her father. He sighed and straightened up, still holding his youngest.
Harry smacked Draco’s pert arse. “That’s what I like to hear out of a trenchmate.”
. I. Mean. Come. On.]
“Whom’s. And it’s your father’s arse that’s being objectified,” Draco replied, pulling Lily to him and pressing a kiss onto the top of her head. “It’s quite lovely and Ms Goldblum would like nothing more than to get her hands on it.”
“Yes. Mainly because in my dreams we’ve never stopped at a kiss,” Draco ran his hands up Harry’s arms delighted at the soft feel of his tan skin.
Teddy smiles. “I like it when I get to help, so I like doing it the Muggle way. I can’t wait until I get my wand.”
“I think this might be the most times I’ve cried while filming a single episode, y’all!” Jonathan says, wiping tears from his cheeks. “I cannot
“Cheers, Hermione! You’re a lifesaver. We just didn’t have the room to store everything here, and it’s Saturday so we can’t depend on the deli to have any free space.” Harry placed a stasis spell over the dough.
“Teddy’s room is the first door on the left, and mine is right across from his. He and I share the bathroom that’s second on the right. Draco’s is the third on the left; he has an ensuite bathroom. We’ve closed up most of the rest of the house, as it’s much too large for us and Kreacher can’t take care of it all in his advanced age.”
been a fun conversation to have with the kids). “As the resolution from last week to begin with the youngest Wottfoy was passed, I cede the floor to Ms Lily Luna Potter.”
Tan shoos Draco back into the fitting room. “Now try on those joggers, they’ll be perfect for watching films on the sofa with Teddy.”
Tan brings over a wool peacoat and a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses. “Here, put these on. You can wear something like this on a casual Saturday out with your family, or even on a date in the Muggle world.”
, yeah?” He raises his eyebrows meaningfully at Draco.
“Albus! Get down here!” Harry pushed the loose strands of Lily’s hair out of her eyes and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. “Of course you can play with your brother and Scorpius when he comes over. There’s no excluding anyone in this house, isn’t that right?”
Teddy sighs dramatically. “I guess I’ll just have to put up with it.”
Jonathan doesn’t respond; he waits for Draco to continue in his own time.
“After all, someone will have to make sure that your dads’ wedding isn’t some sort of Pure Blood fever dream,” Bobby laughs.
“And I did figure it out!” Harry said, chuckling. “Well … sort of. I knew you were up to something, at least.”
Malfoy considered this new information. “Why the hell would they allow a five year old to cook for them? That’s ridiculous. Are you some sort of cooking savant? Did they immediately recognise your talent for ball-shaped meat preparation as a toddler?”
“Well, my compliments then, Potter.” Draco turned and smiled at Potter, who put his hands on his hips and looked at the floor, blushing.
Teddy huffs out an annoyed sigh but looks down at the papers again, beginning to read slowly and haltingly where Draco’s finger is pointing.  “...hereby declare that Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy have petitioned to become the parents of Edward Remus Lupin.”
Harry’s feet began to ache in his ratty trainers, and he felt the sweat prickle on his brow as he stood still for the first time in hours, hoping that he’d be able to find something that would satisfy his appetite for long enough to make it back to Grimmauld Place. A neon sign to his left caught his attention and he walked towards it blindly, drawn to the bright light. Harry stopped and looked into the storefront. He noted empty tables and a black and white tiled floor. Now close enough to read it, he saw that the sign read, “Weinberg’s Deli, est. 1947” in looping red script. He stepped to his left and pushed open the door, vaguely aware of the soft ring of a bell above him signaling his entrance. The deli was small: the space was dominated by a long, clear case lining most of the right-hand side that looked to Harry like the deli counters in a muggle supermarket. Chalkboards were mounted above these describing the day’s menu in neat handwriting, and a wooden counter formed a ninety degree angle with the end of the cases. The counter was well worn and topped with an ancient-looking cash register; photographs of smiling people with their arms around each other lined the exposed brick walls behind the cases. Harry was looking at the menu when a small silver door to the left of the counter swung open. A short old man with a thick mop of salt and pepper hair came out wearing a white shirt. He had the sleeves rolled up to the elbows and “Saul” was embroidered across the left breast.
“I don’t want to do something special with you you’re just my dad and not a friend!” Lily pushed herself off the couch and ran from the room. Harry tried to tell himself that the words of a three year old didn’t sting.
Teddy looks puzzled but sits on the sofa. He takes his task seriously, his eyebrows drawing together in concentration as he slowly unsticks the wax seal and pulls out a stack of papers. “What is this?” He asks Harry and Draco, who are seated on either side of him.
“I’m not one to kink shame, Potter. Quite the opposite! I’m open to all
Apparently, archaeologists drank. A lot. And so for the fourth time in as many days, the group of Hogwarts students found themselves full from dinner, and full of cheap wine. As they were all of age, Dr Song turned a blind eye to the shenanigans of her students, excusing herself shortly after dinner was completed with a “goodnight, sweeties!” and a reminder to set their alarms.
Draco laughs, looking surprised at his reaction. “I suppose I have a lot to learn.”
Jonathan sighs. “You’re adrift in the scary, dark waters of your own emotions my sweet Drakey-poo.”
Scorpius looked perplexed. “Can you have sex if you’re not married?”
After her lecture, Draco waited until the room cleared and then walked over to where Granger was gathering her presentation materials. His palms were sweating and he felt light-headed, a tingling sensation in the tips of fingers. She looked up and raised one eyebrow while she tilted her head, regarding him with curiosity and mild distaste. He opened his mouth to speak but was only able to make a sort of breathy squeaking noise. Granger folded her arms across her chest. “I never thought I’d see the day that Draco Malfoy was at a loss for words.” She continued to stare at him, her gaze unwavering. Draco tried again.
“So, Teddy nominated his two dads, and his Aunt Hermione also wrote a letter of support. She is a very thorough woman, and assured us that Harry and Draco are completely ‘head over heels’ for each other but won’t admit it. She also sent along sixteen pages of hand-written notes about Harry and Draco to help us.”
“You’re right, Dr Song.” Malfoy’s head snapped around to stare at Harry. “We’ll try harder. I promise.” Harry walked over to the small table that housed their notes, and handed the morning’s progress over to her.
Jonathan sniffs the blue bottle. “Oh yes, this smells like a citrus orchard after a rainstorm! Drakey-pie what’s in this?”
“Oi! Malfoy! Enough already!” Harry crossed his arms over his chest, attempting to exude a “don’t-fuck-with-me” air.
“Don’t say anything yet, OK?” Harry said, holding up one hand to stop Draco responding. “I just need to say my part, yeah?”
“Oh sweetie, there is no try. There is only do!” Jonathan begins combing through his wet hair. “So, just between us girls, how’s this been for you? Overwhelming? Wonderful? The best days of your life?”
Saul nodded and came around the side of the counter with the plate clasped in his hands. “Nice to meet you, Harry. You’re the famous wizard, then?” He reached the table and set the plate down, sitting in the empty seat to the left of Harry. “And I’m assuming you’re a gentile,” he continued before Harry could respond. “These are rugelach - they’re biscuits.” He pushed the plate towards Harry. “Very, very delicious biscuits.”
, he thought,
“Oh, hello Granger. I didn’t see you there.” She gave Hermione a quick once over. “I love your slippers, by the way. They exude that ‘devil may care’ disheveled look that’s Potter’s forte.” Pansy reached over to accept the cup of coffee Harry offered her.
“It’s your turn, Pansy!” Millicent yelled over the din.
Harry was stood staring at all of Draco’s exposed skin and stroking himself slowly, head tilted as if considering his options. Draco wiggled his arse and tried to school his expression into what he hoped was an alluring invitation to ravish him.
“Mazel tov!” he said, kissing the top of Lily’s head and ruffling Hugo’s curls. “Time for your chocolatey prize!”
Draco pats Harry’s hand and nods approvingly. “To bed?”
“This is going to be a thing now, isn’t it? You ordering me to use my wandless magic to make your life easier?”  Harry waved his hand, casting a
“Please, sir, I promise that the prat who went to school with Potter is not the person who stands before you today,” Draco tried to explain, horrified that this man had heard all the terrible things that he’d done to Potter at Hogwarts.
[There are several moments before some shuffling and feedback from the microphones stops and Draco’s voice becomes clearer.]
Harry shrugged and sat forward to mirror Draco’s position. “I just didn’t want to deal with it. I wanted to continue to live in a little bubble where our family is untouched by the bullshit of the outside world. But I made the wrong decision, and I am so, so sorry. You are the kids’ other father, and Ginny understands that you’re going to be involved in decisions regarding their lives just as Neville is on the other side. I’m sure that when I tell her about all of this she’s going to tell me what a tosser I am and probably also give me a smack to the head.”
“Well let’s go meet the rest of the family!” Bobby looks around. “Which house is it?”
“My friend Felicity said that married people have sex. And mummy explained to me that sex is how we have babies. So is that going to happen?”
Loving Harry Potter is an exercise in self-restraint. Some days I want to throw the half-filled mugs of tepid tea he leaves all over the house at his giant head; I want to burn the old Chudley Cannons shirt that hasn’t fit him since Hogwarts that he continues to wear; I want to strangle him with the wet towels he leaves on the bathroom floor. I want to banish him to an island populated by a thousand Harry Potters so he is forced to experience the utter frustration of what it’s like to live with him.
“Nevermind, love. Nevermind,” Dean shook his head, exasperated but smiling. “Carry on, you two! Ignore the Irishman.”
“What can I do?” Draco stood next to Harry at the counter, watching him arrange the cake on a plate.
“What do you mean? Where are you going?” Harry asked, puzzled.
“Err, hello, Draco,” Harry said, holding up a brown bag with the Weinberg’s Deli logo stamped across the front. “I’ve brought you lunch.”
Harry looks crestfallen, and Draco worries his bottom lip with his teeth.
“You’re ENGAGED?!” The floo roared to life and Pansy stepped out, wiping ash from her black pencil skirt and levitating a case of wine in front of her.
“Yes, there is. Just eat and listen, you prat.”
“Honestly, I’ll give you five galleons if you take your shouting match elsewhere. Some of us are trying to get work done.” Pansy didn’t look up while she spoke, sprawled over the arms of a chair and flipping through
“Hello! Everyone! Can I please have your attention?” Harry yelled, waving his hands around to get the scattered members of his friends and family to focus on him.
“I’d probably have brought you up to see Madame Pomfrey,” Harry replied, laughing.
good.
“Harry! Teddy! What in Salazar’s name is going on in there?!” Draco Malfoy strides into the room wearing long, dark blue fitted robes. His trademark blond hair falls straight down past his shoulders, and he stops short when he sees the assembled crowd. “What…?” he trails off, looking to Harry.
Producer: Well, un-cast it or whatever it is you do!
“Are you sure you want to go to sleep already?” Harry asked. “Because I’m not all that tired, and I have this problem that I thought you could help me sort out.” He knew that his bravery had nothing to do with being a Gryffindor and everything to do with the wine he had been drinking for the past three hours, but seeing Malfoy in his pajamas, accidentally calling him ‘adorable’ and admitting to having had at least one impure thought about Harry made him unsure he could go another minute without kissing the berk.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Harry. Oh yes, they make wonderful chocolate everything in Paris but I’m not allowed to eat it much because it’s not good for my teeth or for my tummy. Papa eats it all the time and he thinks I don’t see him sneaking it but I do.” Scorpius grinned up at Potter. “Are you his papa? The boy’s over there?” He gestured behind himself vaguely in the direction of the occupied table. “Only, he looks just like you but small. He said his name is Al and that he’s five just like me.”
Harry nods. “Ever. And I got scared, because I was afraid that Draco didn’t love me back. So I panicked, and I ran away.”
“I’m going to come all over you, Draco. I’m going to ruin this pretty lingerie with my spunk.”
Ron smiles and puts his arm around Hermione. “She does all of our thinking. Any and all questions should be directed to her.”
“What do you want, Draco?” The name fell from his lips before he could think about it. Harry gasped as he felt goosebumps erupt on his neck and arms from Malfoy’s ministrations.
Harry holds my gaze but holds out his hand to the side, summoning the knickers that he’d abandoned earlier. He eases me down onto my back and kneels between my legs before he starts using the knickers to wank again.
“Oh, wow.” Harry said. He’d learnt about World War II at his muggle school, but hadn’t given any thought to the role of the magical community in that conflict. “You were in the resistance too, Saul?” Images of the Order of the Phoenix came into Harry’s mind - Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Snape … his parents... - but he fought to keep the memories pushed firmly away and focused on the sound of Saul’s voice.
Harry stood up to look Draco in the eye. They hadn’t spent a night apart in the week and a half since they’d began shagging, and he wasn’t planning on changing that when they returned to their dorms. In fact, he didn’t plan on changing that when they were done at Hogwarts. If he had his way, he’d never spend another night without Draco, full stop.
“Ever?” Teddy’s eyes are wide with shock.
hot. I think we’ll have to repeat this, although I’ll have to go shopping. I think these ones might be beyond saving.” I gesture to the come- and sweat-covered garter belt and stockings. “Do you want to talk about why you were afraid to bring up the lingerie thing in the past?”
He waved a dismissive hand at Harry before turning to Lily. “Your vocabulary is progressing well for a pirate,
“What are you doing here?” Draco asked, closing the door to keep the temperature steady in the room.
Harry smiled and took a deep breath. He knew from experience that this charm was particularly unpleasant, though blessedly quick. He backed up a few paces and steadied himself. “Ready,” he said. Malfoy flicked his wand and said the incantation, and Harry felt fire racing through his veins as the spell burned up the alcohol still in his system. After a few moments he shook his head as if trying to clear it, and looked at Malfoy. “You ready?” Malfoy braced himself against the side of the bed and nodded. As he didn’t know quite where his wand was, Harry waved his hand at Malfoy, focusing his thoughts on the incantation. Malfoy went rigid for a few seconds and then relaxed, opening his eyes to glare at Harry.
[The kitchen is much as they left it, except Antoni is now sat at the table with Karamo and Teddy and is helping them chop vegetables. The three of them look up as they hear Harry and Draco re-enter.]
Draco blushed. “Can we skip ahead about ten years?” He asked.
“So am I allowed to kick Charlie Vance in the penis?” Lily questioned, her eyes alight with something that made Harry a bit nervous.
“I used the Malfoy library to research the Potter family and was able to track down the location of his great grandfather’s birth. Since then, Harry has been experimenting with some South Indian recipes to get more in touch with his roots.”
“I’ve dressed up as Celestina Warbeck for the past four Halloweens, Harry. Why would I be upset about putting on women’s garments?”
“No. My muggle relations weren’t all that interested in whether or not I wanted to cook, they just told me what to do and I did it. Just...just drop it, Malfoy. OK?” Harry felt like an idiot. He shouldn’t have made any comments about his life before Hogwarts. The last thing he wanted was pity from anyone.
“We helped a lot before the guests came!” Al said quickly, “and didn’t complain about it except for once but I apologised.”
The adults all looked at each other, unwilling to contradict one another.
Well, that, and Saint Paul had never been in love with, nevermind married to, Harry Potter. Plato was much more on the nose when he decried love to be a serious mental disease.
“He’s right over there, Harry! And if you ask me, he certainly looks like he could use a hug.” The man behind the counter gestured to where Draco was standing completely motionless.
Silence fell. Draco winced internally, wishing he could take back what he’d just said.
Malfoy suddenly looked uncomfortable, but took a breath and said to Harry, “I won’t bring this up again as it clearly upsets you, but I just want you to know that if your muggle relations truly did force you to cook for them as barely more than a toddler then...well, then I hope to never meet them because I would hex them to within an inch of their life. And trust me, I know some
“Are you fucking insane?” Draco said, bringing one hand up to his throat to clutch at phantom pearls.
“Harry! You can’t ask a woman if she’s pregnant. Honestly. How you ever managed to be in polite society is beyond me” Draco huffed, shaking his head.
“You wouldn’t have opened it.”
“Fuck right off, Potter. You know you love me.” Pansy stalked over to the kitchen island, not a strand of hair out of place. “Are we pretending that I didn’t just hear that you two are fucking engaged?”
________________
Still slightly sleep mussed and scratching at the scruff on his neck, Harry shook his head. “This one is all you, darling.” He moved to the coffee pot and poured himself a mug, waiting to hear how Draco would manage this.
Harry rolled his eyes. Al was always finding loopholes.
He jumped in surprise at the sound of my voice and dropped the knickers like they were on fire. “Draco! Er, hello, love! How was the party?” He sat on the bed and crossed his legs as if he were trying to hide his obvious arousal from me.
Lily hopped down from her perch on the window ledge and did a little pirouette, letting her riotous curls whip around her face. “I understand everything, now,” she said. “I didn’t think mum could be having a baby if she and Nev weren’t married, but I didn’t know people could have sex whenever they wanted.”
“To honor Harry’s heritage, we’re going to make a sambar today! It’s a staple in South Indian households and pretty easy to make so all three of you will be able to help,” Antoni says.
“It’s not my fault you have the fine motor skills of a giant, Potter. I’m not going to sit back whilst you ruin the stratigraphy with your ineptitude!”
The old man wagged his finger at Harry and chuckled. “If you weren’t so good in the kitchen I’d toss your skinny tuckus out on the street for talk like that!”
“Because you didn’t come to pick up Scorpius this morning, and I wanted to talk to you.”
Draco pulled his head back and regarded Harry, smiling. “I think there’s something wrong with me that I find your ridiculous speech patterns endearing.” Draco squeezed Harry’s arse. “Get on the bed, on your back, Potter,” he demanded, his voice little more than a growl. Harry acquiesced immediately, desire pulsing through him.
“Ok guys, this is a special one. We got the most amazing, most sincere letter from a young man named Teddy who nominated his two dads. You know what? I just need to read this cute-bomb to y’all.” Karamo whips out a piece of paper and begins to read.
“We don’t...flirt!” Harry splutters.
“Oh please, everyone knows where your chocolate stash is,” Hermione raised her eyebrows at Harry, who confirmed this with a nod, “and not only have I apologised for the knickers mix up, but you know I was only concerned that you were stepping out on Harry and I panicked!”
“Fuck, Draco. The mouth on you…” Harry gasped, rocking forward slightly against Draco.
“Well, anyone with eyes that work can see that you two are in love, like the sort of love that Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione have. I bet even Troggy knows and he can’t see anything! But you wouldn’t tell each other that, and Aunt Hermione said that the situation was becoming dire. So we decided to write a letter to the only people who I knew would be able to help.” Teddy gestures at Antoni and Karamo. “And also you both dress really bad so it was easy to get you to believe that was the only reason they were here.”
The floo chimed and Hermione’s voice rang out from the living room fireplace. “Morning! Are you up? I’ve got the dough ready to be fried for the donuts!”
“Yes, and Teddy and I had a nice long chat about showing affection before bed last night.”
Malfoy put the pot down on the burner and stared blankly at it. “What charm do I use to make it...hot, or whatever?”
“I love you, Teddy,” Draco interjects. “I love you more than the moon and the stars. And I will never not want you as my son, safe with me in our home.”
“You know,” Draco spoke onto Harry’s chest where he lay his head, nuzzling into him slightly as the other boy carded his fingers through his white-blond locks, “yoga has many benefits.” Harry snorted.
Hermione’s hand flew to her mouth in mock - shock. “No!” she gasped. “Narcissa Malfoy wearing orange?”
Draco walked back into the kitchen and sat down at the round table near a large window. “Is that what smells like cinnamon?” He asked.
Harry laughed, remembering Malfoy’s ashen face when he returned to the common room after having witnessed whatever it was between Hermione and Ron. To this day none of the parties involved would disclose what precisely Malfoy had seen.
“That’s so fucking hot,” I say honestly, watching him stroke his hard, wet cock with the black lace.
“Hello, again! And you’ve brought your clone, I see. He’s the spitting image of you!” He smiled broadly at Scorpius, who gave him a small smile in return. “What’ll it be for you today?” He asked Draco.
Harry and Draco hurried over to help her bring what felt like ten tonnes of dough through.
Teddy looks torn. “But the Fab Five need my help! You know my dads don’t cooperate well.”
Harry mused. “Listen. Just follow a few directions and we’ll get this done quickly. I’m actually a pretty good cook, and I think this’ll turn out a lot better than Ron and Tony’s ‘meatloaf surprise’ from last night.” Harry shuddered at the memory.
Granger scoffed and rolled her eyes. “Not only am I a Trainee Healer, Malfoy, but I am also a war veteran with PTSD symptoms of my own. I know one can’t control one’s panic attacks.” She was sitting facing Draco, her legs crossed and an unimpressed expression on her face.
Scorpius walked back over to the table. “Hi everyone! I’m Scorpius Malfoy and perhaps if I’m good and eat my lunch we can play later?” He waved both his hands at the assembled Potters. Turning back, Scorpius asked, “What’s a Zayde?”
“You died so Draco could suck your cock, apparently. Now go rub up against each other and leave us all the fuck alone!” Blaise Zabini, newly minted Undesirable Number One to Harry, bellowed.
“Oh, good!” She used her fork to spear a piece of lasagna. “Do you date Mr. Malfoy now?”
“You’re assuming that Harry shares my affections and wouldn’t abscond into the night to be away from me and my inconvenient feelings.”
Harry threw his arms up in frustration. “I’m only aware of you moaning about your alabaster complexion. Use a fucking sun charm like the rest of us and stop acting like such a delicate flower!”
“I suppose we should thank you, then,” Harry says, lifting his head and smiling at Teddy. “Even though you are a very sneaky child and I will be on the lookout from now on for devious plans!” He stands, ruffles Teddy’s hair, and goes to stand behind Draco’s chair. He puts his hands on the other man’s shoulders, and squeezes gently.
Hugo and Lily scream-sang the song as they sat in a circle on the sitting room floor, midway into a game with Dudley, Pansy, Saul, and James.
“Did you?” Seamus replied, looking perplexed. “When?”
