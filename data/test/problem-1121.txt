“Do you want to come back to Half-Moon Place?” Draco asked, feeling very much like he didn’t want to be alone. “Adrianne has this evening off to visit her parents at the Manor, but I’m sure I could rustle up a cake or some biscuits? I might even have a pre-pregnancy beer rolling around the back of my pantry that I could furnish you with.”
“Typical?” Draco sniffed. “None of this is typical. I’ve been the same size waist since I was seventeen.”
Malfoy sets a small leather bag on Harry's bedside table and stands at Harry's bedside for a moment looking down at the quilt, tracing some of the stitching with his fingertips. Then he takes off his dressing gown and, seeing there's nowhere to hang it, sets it on the end of Harry's bed and arranges his slippers on the ground directly below it and then Harry gets impatient with Malfoy's fiddling and tugs on Malfoy's hand for once to pull him into bed.
“It’s certainly a turn up for the spell books,” Draco answered quietly. “We’ve got a lot of history, you and I.”
Harry jumped out of the way, laughing as he pulled his tee-shirt over his head. His glasses were left askew, and he fixed them back onto his nose. “Need to be able to see you,” Harry smiled. It was such a simple act, but Draco felt his heart hammer at the sight of it. The sweet familiarity was as warm as magic. Merlin, but Harry was gorgeous.
“I’ve been through it four times,” the witch answered, her quill jotting down Draco’s measurements. She murmured an incantation and the tape moved, tickling him, “and I’ve got three grandchildren. Every baby is a special gift from Merlin.”
There was more besides the headline article, and Harry skipped through the pages. Draco breathed out a small sigh of relief. The article could have been so much worse. The rest of the paper was nothing but a rehash of old
that blasted baby book. Secondly, you’re not getting past the entrance hall without croissants. Many, many croissants.”
His new home was a busy, chaotic place, filled with piles of books, mismatched furniture and magical curios from all over the world. He could only wonder what the place would look like once their baby was born. Perhaps they’d need to add extra rooms like the Weasleys had done. Mummy would disapprove at the bijou busyness of it all, but Draco didn’t think she’d disparage Grimmauld
“Spontaneous combustion isn’t quite Ron’s style,” Harry said, chasing the bread with another mouthful of his Butterbeer. “He’s rather more laidback than that, and considerably more open-minded.” Harry shrugged his shoulders, and gestured to Draco with open palms. “I mean, yeah, Ron gave me a bit of ribbing when I told him about our little surprise. Said he felt sorry for any kid of ours – what with your sharp chin, and my short-sightedness – but he clapped me on the back, said he was happy for me. Said that we’d been star-crossed even at school. That it was only a matter of time.”
Harry shrugs and then seeing Ron's still busily inking paperwork says, "It's symbolic. Working together with Malfoy."
Draco felt his belly grumble at Adrianne’s words. He’d been craving hot, filling food, and his childhood favourite sounded like a dream come true. The three of them traipsed through to Narcissa’s private dining room, and he was soon tucking in to the delightful comfort food.
Of course Ron spots it right off and Harry is submitted to the mortifying ordeal of explaining he kissed Malfoy again, this time undeniably on purpose.
In another world, another lifetime, Harry and he could have raised their baby together, teaching them all the magic spells they’d need to succeed at Hogwarts. Harry and he would have been together when their little one had their first, accidental magic, and they’d have visited Ollivander’s together to buy them their wand. In another existence, Harry and he could have shared these milestones; two proud, delighted fathers.
“Mistress Cissy has been smiling all day,” Adrianne responded. “She says that the Manor misses its heir, and that she does too. The elves agree with the Mistress.”
So Harry stems the kale, standing next to Malfoy at the counter while he slices an onion into perfectly thin slivers. He's trying to think of a way to ask,
With one last bone crushing hug Hagrid says goodbye. Harry watches him take off into the air and then walks back to the gazebo. He may as well help Malfoy clear the table.
Draco answers extensively and Ms. Quincy inquires further about many aspects of Draco's life with ever mounting enthusiasm, frequently peppering "what a pleasure" and "oh how lovely" into her responses.
His 'bedroom', Harry learns, is actually a series of rooms with an honest to god parlour with velvet upholstered wingback chairs and a chaise lounge, a study lined with bookcases and featuring a massive desk, then the actual bedroom, and an adjoining bathroom. The bedroom has three gigantic windows facing the gardens and a huge bed underneath hovering constellations that, coming closer, Harry sees are made from real crystal.
Harry is looking through one of Malfoy's recipe books while Malfoy kneads a large mass of bread dough. Malfoy told him to pick out a recipe for lunch.
Malfoy frowns but he returns Harry's hug, holding him close under the bright kitchen lights. Ron and Hermione must've gone to their room because the flat is very quiet now. Harry swallows hard and tries to divine what he's supposed to say from Malfoy's expression.
Draco swallowed, the acid reflux in his throat making him wince. They’d been through too much, the pair of them, and knew each other far too well. Sharing a dorm with a person for seven years meant Greg knew Draco as well as he knew himself. Fuck, Draco thought that Greg, Vince and Pansy had even realised he liked boys before he had.
Draco listened, and he smiled and nodded at the right moments, but his mind wasn’t on the conversation. It kept flicking back and getting stuck on the words that Goyle had said earlier.
Draco had an ulterior motive for meeting at Café Quendryth too. Having Harry over to Half-Moon Place, where they’d made love – made a baby – and spent the night, felt like too much, too soon.
Malfoy narrates his every thought while reading the menu, reading each dish description aloud and exclaiming over it.
“Merlin forbid our child met that fate,” Harry replied, amused. “Come on. Let’s tell Judith that Cornwall is a no-no. The next place is in London, isn’t it?”
"Sorry," Harry says, remembering the beautiful mural Luna painted of their faces, the golden word "friends" twined around them. He feels like a pile of steaming garbage. "Work's been busy."
It dawned on Draco that Mediwitch Hayes had gotten the wrong end of the wand. “Oh, no,” he insisted. “Harry and I… We’re not
Conversation around the table began to move on after that. Even if there was anything to be done about the article, now wasn’t the time to worry about it. Hermione regaled the table with tales of her overnight volunteering and the unsurprising incompetence of the Aurors that she’d had dealings with. A couple of registered werewolves had been arrested, even though it was nowhere close to the full moon. “Nothing but out-and-out prejudice,” Hermione uttered, to the agreement of the Weasleys.
“Mrs Zabini said that it was definite. Apparently, you’re a Gemini, and Harry is a Leo – well, he would be, wouldn’t he, perfect sodding lion – and that combination means that the bump decorating your middle is of the feminine variety. It's a certainty.”
Maybe he’d only loved Harry since they’d made love; since Harry had pushed inside him, and made him half-delirious with the pleasure of it, but Draco didn’t think that was the truth either. Draco thought part of him had loved Harry since they were children, caught in opposing sides of a war that was neither of their making. Harry had saved his life once, and now they’d created a new life together.
Grinning, Harry tugged Draco along. “I’m multifaceted,” Harry replied, as they make their way up their stairs, “and I’d much rather you found out those things about me along the way. I’m not one for bragging. Besides, much as I love my pictures, they’re not what I wanted to show you. I want to show you something that you’ll like far more.”
"Ya hear that, Harry? His arse is too tight for assumptions. How'd you reckon he'll get your mon—" Harry dives forward and claps his hands over Ron's mouth.
There wasn’t any time left. It wasn’t as if he wanted to impress Harry anyway. Draco gave himself a quick once-over in the mirror, smoothed out the wrinkles in his shirt and walked to the hallway. He placed his hand on the handle, and counted to ten.
Nothing wrong with watching them some more while he waits though. The morning is softer and slower than the night had been. Harry focuses on their routines, avidly waiting for the moment one of the two gets their uniforms out of the wardrobe. Harry has many questions he wants answered about this other version of himself, and this other Draco Malfoy, but mostly he is curious to see what other job he could possibly have. He doesn’t particularly feel great about the Department of Mysteries (especially after this whole time jump debacle) but he knows some of his skills are highly desired in an Unspeakable. That said, Harry did consider Healing, after his NEWTs. Plus, he doesn’t know enough about Other Harry’s temperament. Maybe they’re nothing alike. Maybe this Harry has a big busy social life that would clash with the dreadful secrecy of being an Unspeakable. Maybe he lacks the empathy or the focus Healers need.
They kissed until their lips were parched, and their pricks were hard in their trousers, and it would have been the easiest thing in the whole world to have sex.
Fortuitously, Artemista Alley was deserted, and it took the two of them short moments to arrive at their destination. The Apothecary glowed, bright green and gaudy in the darkness, and its door opened with the old-fashioned ring of a bell.
Harry looks up at Malfoy, grudgingly impressed with his resolve not to further hurt this woman who was hurt during the war. But he's starting to suspect Malfoy's turn-the-other-cheek behavior and verbal gymnastics aren't motivated by conviction as much as a heavy guilt he denies feeling. He's starting to suspect that Malfoy thinks he does deserve to suffer. And surprisingly, Harry doesn't agree. He may not forgive him but he doesn't need to see Malfoy suffer. Harry might just want him to be happy.
Draco nodded his consent, and Harry let his palm curve over the edge of Draco’s belly, slowly moving it until it lay over the very roundest part. He looked so handsome, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
Neville nods and Harry makes his escape, feeling like a lower life form for running away from him. Harry walks slowly through an overgrown aisle of branches with leaves in every color, moody and confused and angry but at who he doesn't know. It could be he's angry at Malfoy, for bullying them all those years; or it could be Harry's angry at Neville, for his unsolicited opinion; or maybe with himself, for not holding Malfoy accountable for all the shit he did. Is he compromising his principles, ignoring his sense of right and wrong and making choices with his dick instead of his head and heart?
“You like it?” Harry asked, visibly relieved. “I love it out here. Not this summer, for obvious reasons, but most years I’m out here nearly all the time. I have barbeques, have my friends over. It’s brilliant fun.”
Malfoy falls asleep not long after, drooling a little on Harry's shirt collar, which Harry's horrified to find he thinks is a bit cute, god help him. He sits in Malfoy's hospital bed looking at the moving portrait of unicorns grazing in a sunny field and tries to get his thoughts together.
"And what's this? A tent?" Malfoy asks, coming closer and plucking at Dudley's shirt like it offends him. To be fair, Dudley's clothes are fairly offensive. This particular shirt has a hole in the armpit.
"Be honest, Potter. You're only here because you get paid good money to eat porridge and pretend you're protecting me. You wouldn't come near me otherwise."
"Don't be an idiot," Malfoy says. He's already closed his eyes again. He tugs weakly at Harry's hand. "Get in," he says, a little slurred.
Lost in the haze of his pleasure, Draco was scarcely aware of Harry. The other wizard sat up, spread Draco’s legs until the muscles screamed, and then fucked him until warmth pulsed within him. The pair of them collapsed then, a sweaty, sticky tangle.
Harry gingerly climbs into Malfoy's narrow hospital bed, curling up next to him. Malfoy pulls Harry's arm across his chest and then seems to fall asleep immediately. Harry breathes in the scent of his hair, untainted by the sanitized smell of the hospital. He can feel Malfoy's heartbeat underneath his hand and it's enough to fall asleep.
Harry reaches out and threads his fingers through Malfoy's belt loops, tugging him that much closer.
What with the bickering and how frequently Harry and Malfoy have bickered over a meal lately, their date doesn't feel much different than their usual interactions. It's sort of anticlimactic, Harry thinks, feeling a little disappointed. He looks across the table at Malfoy wondering how he expected to feel.
His coach wasn’t pleased with the result. “You were within six inches of that bloody Snitch,” Johnson shouted, spittle flying in Draco’s face. The owners weren’t pleased either. “You’re out of goodwill with the fans,” they shouted. “They need to see a win, pronto!”
Harry had the audacity not to be embarrassed in the slightest. He followed as Draco led him through into the lounge. “The croissants and the Frogs are for you,” Harry answered, seating himself down on the settee like he hadn’t tried to make love to Draco there, eleven weeks before, “and the fruit is for the baby. Lots of vitamins, according to my baby book. Plus, plenty of fibre. The book also mentioned you might be getting a bit consipa- “
“It wasn’t,” Draco offered, conciliatory. Harry hadn’t just made the first step. He’d made several and they’d all been rebuffed. The wizard was trying, and Draco knew that he ought to try as well. They were tied together now, by the baby that they’d made, which meant they’d have to get on. Make decisions. Be adults, whatever that was supposed to mean. Draco picked the bag back up, and cleared his throat. “It wasn’t a bad idea,” he repeated. “It just came as a surprise, is all. I had Adrianne – she’s one of Mother’s elves – make us up some sandwiches. Still,” Draco conceded. “We could certainly have the croissants for dessert.”
"No, of course not. Nothing but spotless moral perfection satisfies the Savior. I'm sorry to be such a blot on your character." Malfoy angrily dumps flour into a mixing bowl causing a cloud of it to puff up.
"He does," Hermione says. She takes a sip of coffee. "I've been doing a bit of reading on restorative justice, things like prison abolition and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. We're not the first post-war society wondering what to do with a really violent racial or otherwise bigoted history and how to recover. I mean, we live in the foremost colonialist aggressor country in the world. If wizards learned
Draco wondered for a single mad moment whether Apparating the pair of them to the bedroom might be a decent idea, and Draco would have, except that was the moment Harry’s hands moved lower, clasped him hard on the hips. Their groins converged in an undulating movement and Draco felt the hard, heavy shape of Harry’s prick. Bloody hell, but he was big.
To his surprise, no such telling-off occurred. Instead, the witch fumbled in her patterned tapestry shoulder-bag, and pulled out a rolled newspaper. “Those utter cretins,” she muttered, her fingers white where they were clenched around the
"If you really liked it you wouldn't have let me put it back. Why do you look like you're deciding what coffin to get?"
"What?" Harry asks, looking at Malfoy. "Why not? They put you in hospital for a week and a half. That's a dangerous fucking curse."
Malfoy sets a plate down in front of Hermione with a piece of lasagna and arugula salad on the side. "Thanks," she says. "And lo and behold, the Board of Governors are a bunch of backwards traditionalist, out of touch, rich white men with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo at all costs. You should hear them speaking at the meetings Harry, it's like they're barely aware a war even happened. Well, the ones who aren't in prison now. Which is another thing! The Board members who are imprisoned for being
Harry trails down aisle after aisle, not sure what he's looking for. "I don't know how to quilt," he tells Malfoy.
Circe, but Draco wanted Harry so much, and he’d been so good. He’d tried so hard, for so long, but suddenly he couldn’t help himself. Draco let himself surrender, let his defences crumble and fragment. Slowly he leant forward, closing the tiny space between them.
Harry pushes the cutting board toward Malfoy. He's unsure how he managed to lose this argument when he's so clearly right. Harry was so sure Malfoy should apologize to Hagrid but somehow Malfoy's muddled everything up.
He'll make the batter and let it rest until Potter arrives, only because he doesn't want to be interrupted with a crepe in the pan. He slices some oranges, wanting something fresh and fragrant and piles them into his favorite indigo blue ceramic bowl, loving the contrast of the orange against the deep blue. And the indigo bowl is really set off by the golden ochre kettle and the cloth napkins with the little floral border. Really, everything just looks best when the table is set proper, with all and sundry.
Luna skips over to the window pushing it open and leaning out. "You don't have to eavesdrop, Harry, it's not a secret. So nice to see you by the way. You've been terribly busy this year, haven't you?"
Draco had been a mistake. They’d had a good time in bed, but the relationship part – the making breakfast, and staying over part – had been surplus to requirements. If Harry wasn’t ready for a relationship, then he wasn’t likely ready for a baby either, as sure as dragons loved gold. His being rejected had felt terrible, but Draco couldn’t abide the idea of their child growing up knowing that the Chosen One – the Boy Who Lived – didn’t want them.
They drink their tea with milk and dunk their apricot pistachio biscotti and then Malfoy says, "What would you like for dinner?" and Harry's cupboards are bare so he says he doesn't know and they go back to the grocery store to buy a cauliflower, ricotta, capers, red pepper flakes, a lemon, farro and some unbelievably pricey parmesan cheese. And then Harry buys a heavy and expensive ceramic casserole dish he's certain he'll never use again. Malfoy combines all these ingredients into a cheesy baked farro studded with deeply roasted cauliflower that Harry eats three helpings of.
Breath caught in Draco’s throat as he read the headline twice, not daring to believe what his eyes were telling him.
Draco’s chest did a funny little pitter-pat, and squeezed tight, like he couldn’t breathe, but that was only for a moment.
the Mondrian. You wouldn’t have had a chance otherwise.” Draco stepped away, and leant against the counter. “It was an extremely well-considered decision that I've made, coming to live here.”
Maybe he was worried about the match? Draco supposed that could be it. Montrose had Szymon Lewandowski playing tomorrow, a new Seeker from Poland who was widely considered one of the best Quidditch players in the world. Draco knew the home crowd would be right behind Lewandowski, urging him on to win the Snitch and victory.
Draco did, and Harry was right. What was behind that innocuous pine door was far more impressive than a dozen Mondrians. It was their child’s bedroom, and the sight of it left Draco awed.
Harry broke their kiss once more, and Draco made a small, incoherent noise. Harry grinned. Bloody hell, but Draco knew how eager he must look. Luckily Harry looked rather excited himself. Draco saw that his face was red, a blush of colour high in his cheekbones, and his lips were sinfully red. “Do you want-” Harry began, the end of his sentence a blurry mumble as kissed across Draco’s throat.
Draco could do that, and he carried the shopping bag through the kitchen. He set the housekeeping spells to boil the kettle, and collected a couple of plates from his cupboard. Next were the sandwiches. Adrianne had set them under
"No the opposite. He stormed off because I thought he'd have house-elves and apparently he's morally opposed and how dare I not know that. Like I should just suddenly think he's a good person because he put his father in prison?"
Draco felt a lump in his throat, and he wiped his eyes with the heel of his hand. He screwed the parchment up, and threw it to the floor in a pitiful gesture.
He might have to admit to himself that he likes snuggling Malfoy and generally wants him around. Which still feels like a problem because then Harry is counting on Malfoy, and counting on someone is like trusting them and Harry doesn't know if he can trust Malfoy not to hurt him. He still doesn't know how much weight to give to seven years worth of interactions and how much weight to give to the last few months. He lays in bed mulling this over and generally pouting before he has to Floo over to the Manor where he'll see Malfoy and have to pretend he wasn't hurt that Malfoy left without waking Harry up.
On the day Malfoy is finally ready to be discharged from St. Mungo with a flight of potions and a long parchment of instructions, Ron comes to visit in his full Auror uniform, bearing the news that they've found the person responsible for cursing Malfoy.
Harry gets the can opener and a saucepan and starts warming up his soup, stirring miserably while he thinks. In the last several months when Harry spared a thought for Malfoy and the testimony he had given he assumed Malfoy had witnessed a lot of death and destruction. He didn't think of Malfoy afraid to act too gay around his father and all his awful friends and their resident murderous sociopath. Knowing Malfoy lived with several homicidal homophobes makes it so much more real to Harry that Malfoy was
Now though, the rooms were silent and empty, like a stage set waiting for its actors. Draco knew he’d gotten too used to Harry, that was certain. He felt cast adrift, despondent. Part of him thought about Firecalling his friends, but the idea of their sympathetic faces left a bitter taste.
“Merlin didn’t save me,” Draco answered, trying and failing to keep the emotion out of his voice. “Harry Potter did. Harry saved my life.” He gulped in a breath, knowing that he sounded shaky, but not able to help himself. “Mummy, Harry is my baby’s father. We only had one night together, but that was enough to make a baby. We’re going to be co-parents – going to be friends – but Harry said I was a mistake. He said that he wasn’t ready for a relationship.”
"Hi," Harry says, feeling like maybe he should have put more effort into his appearance and worn some jeans without holes.
Draco had been expecting the question and he had prepared his answer. “I want to press ahead,” he said, pleased with how steady his voice sounded. “I’ve decided I’m going to have the baby.”
. “We’ve still got a few minutes before we need to leave,” Harry said, watching while he finished buttoning his shirt. “We don’t need to rush.” He paused then, meeting Draco’s eyes in the mirror. His green eyes were big and wistful; there was a lot of affection behind them. “I wasn’t fibbing just now,” he said. “You look really good. You've really taken to this pregnancy thing – eating healthily, getting your rest, looking after yourself – I just- well, I suppose I wanted to tell you.”
Harry finishes his porridge and washes the bowl in the sink. Malfoy has moved on from his pie crust to tending a pan of bacon on the hob.
Harry hadn’t ever seemed fraught with grief at Hogwarts, but then Draco hadn’t known the real man. He’d only known the shining star of legend.
He could do this. Week in, week out, Draco straddled his Nimbus and kicked the ground away in front of thousands of baying, screaming Puddlemere United fans. Harry was just one man. Draco could do this.
Their bodies mould against each other under the covers and Harry finds himself wanting more. He wants to see how they fit against each other. He watches Other Harry snake his hand under the duvet and pull Draco closer. Draco moves but Harry can’t tell what he’s doing, until Draco breaks away from the kiss and asks, quiet and sleep-lovely, “Yeah?”
Harry finishes his bowl of polenta without saying more. It's creamy and filling and the oranges are tart and juicy. Malfoy takes both their bowls when they're finished and brings them over to the sink to wash. Without looking up from his scrubbing he says, "Bill Weasley is coming by today."
Draco was only happy to help change the subject. Beside him, Harry looked chagrined, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder at the conversations that had been happening here at the Burrow. Evidently, for all her rejections of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, Molly Weasley’s reverence for the whole ‘wed before bed’ practices cut very deeply. “Harry is exaggerating,” Draco answered. “I’m only seventeen weeks in. In three weeks we’re going to find out what we’re having though.”
Monday rolled around, as speedy as a spell, and Draco Flooed to the Paternity Department of St Mungo’s at ten-twenty.
Draco imagined her playing tea-parties with his mother, and her listening while he read to her from his old, childhood copy of Beedle the Bard. The elevator came to a clackety halt on the ground floor, and Harry paused, letting him leave first. Merlin, but he was always so gentlemanly and considerate. Draco had no doubt that their daughter would be the centre of Harry’s universe.
Draco smirked. “And I was starting to fall in love with her,” he retorted. “After all, I did see her often enough. Perhaps I might even allow you to visit me in the meantime,” Draco said, “but there’ll have to be a couple of conditions. First, you
Harry and Luna walk to the forest, dropping chunks of meat as they go, the Thestrals following along.
Then Harry smells coffee and Ron and Hermione don't drink coffee and neither does Harry but Malfoy does. He drinks fancy coffee he grinds fresh every morning. And he must have ground it fresh
Draco massaged his forehead and sagged into a kitchen chair. What was Harry doing, hanging about in bookshops and apothecaries? He was under the impression that he’d been very clear in Café Quendryth. He didn’t need any extra attention, and he didn’t need fuss. Harry had been perfectly clear too: he wasn’t ready, not for a baby or a relationship.
Nor can he concentrate on anything else. He's supposed to be helping Ron and Hermione find a flat but Malfoy's offhand comment about cooking, that he wouldn't do it if he didn't like it, like it's that simple, won't leave Harry alone.
Now though, their child’s life would be a negotiated thing. It’d be Floo calls, and separate holidays, and fitting in with new partners, and likely other children born along the way. It’d be co-parenting, compromise, and nothing more.
Harry puts the flowers on the little table by Malfoy's bed and sits down to watch the full performance. As the Healer leaves, Malfoy slumps against his pillows, of which there are now two.
“Are you panicking now? I can’t remember anymore. Christ, don’t panic. This is good. Everything is going to be okay, okay? Breathe. Breathe, Harry.”
To be fair, this isn’t that different from any other work day. Harry ends most days thinking, “Fuck the Forensics Department, fuck the Aurors, fuck the Detectives, fuck the Curse-Breakers and most of all, fuck the
Goyle couldn’t have moved faster if someone had been firing hexes in his direction. He was up on his feet in moments, pulling on a jumper over his head and retrieving his jeans from where he’d dumped them in a crumpled pile the night before. Draco bit his lip and didn’t say a word. Thank you wasn’t used often, not between Slytherins, but that didn’t mean Draco wasn’t thankful. Some of the fright in his belly started to unspool, and the tension in his chest started to loosen. Bravery hadn’t ever been Draco’s forte, and he was glad Greg was beside him.
The witch hurried out of the door, and Draco felt a coil of anxiety roll through him as he lowered himself backwards onto the pillows.
Harry lands with a soft thud, too soft for the wooden floor of his living room. He looks down to realise there’s now a shaggy grey rug under his feet. It takes him a couple of seconds to stave off panic and go through the events of what just happened. Mere seconds ago, he was standing in his living room, grumbling to himself about too much work and debating whether to order take-away or just go to bed without eating dinner, and now he is standing in a room that slightly resembles his living room, but definitely
And, "Look, Potter, no look, she uses a spell for whipping her egg whites," Malfoy says, judgement seeping from his pores.
That was certainly the truth. Draco finished their Firecall not long afterwards, and Draco blew his friend a kiss goodbye. He made his way to bed, a wide smile upon his face. Despite her impertinence, talking to Parkinson always left him feeling lighter.
“If it’s impossible,” Greg answered, sounding far too reasonable to Draco’s ears, “then there’s no harm in taking a test to prove me wrong is there? We can go to the 24-hour Apothecary on Artemista Alley, soon as we’re finished here.”
"It's a common dish in Brittany. Usually served with savory toppings. Sometimes with a glass of buttermilk."
"What's in the porridge?" Harry asks again, shuffling a little closer. Malfoy is wearing a really soft jumper and Harry likes the way it feels under his hands.
Harry starts work on Monday in a much better mood than he's been in for at least six months, maybe an entire year and a half. It's surprising to Harry how much lighter he feels just acknowledging he doesn't like being an Auror, even though he's still going to work. Just knowing it is enough right now.
Ron pokes his head round from inspecting the kitchen. He doesn't look all too surprised by Harry's question.
Draco made a huffing noise. Pansy was too clever by half. He pitied Nott. The poor bloke could hardly have any secrets. “Mummy said it was a sacred union, blessed by Merlin,” Draco retorted petulantly, annoyed by the witch.
For some reason that makes Malfoy smile and he says, "I'll be mad at you for as many things as I please."
"We haven't talked about it much. This is the important bit though, you can love someone without forgiving them."
ought not to be looking. “I’m not bothered about any of that. All I’m bothered about is you. That you’re healthy, and happy, and that everything is right with our baby.”
If Harry feels a little dizzy at how hypnotised he feels, at how all all the blood leaves his head and travels south, towards both heart and crotch.
Louis St Clare, in dire need of a new London pad, had almost snapped Draco’s hand off when he’d mooted the idea of leasing Half-Moon Place to the younger man. Draco only hoped that the Seeker would treat the place well. It was, after all, filled with some of the best memories of Draco’s life. It was in Half-Moon Place that Draco had conceived their baby, and Harry and he had fallen in love within its walls.
What then, was the motivation for these letters? Draco rolled the phial between his finger and thumb. He ought to send it back; he didn’t want to send mixed messages.
Malfoy smiles and it's only a little smug and anyway, Harry minds less now than he did before. He wouldn't say it's cute, because he hasn't had some sort of insanity-producing lobotomy, but it's slightly less annoying than it used to be.
She cast her eyes over a Puddlemere United-headed letter. “Mediwix Braithwaite wrote that you’re currently at around eight weeks gestation,” she said, “but that he wasn’t an expert on wizard pregnancy. First, I’d like to do a
“I’ve thought about nothing else,” Draco answered. “I’m keeping them, Harry, even though I’m shit bloody terrified and haven’t a clue what I’ll actually
"I have not. And you should know your room is not as soundproof as you two seem to think it is. I can
He eats a nectarine standing up, juice running down his chin and forearm, dripping into the wide white ceramic sink. Petrol enters the kitchen then, a quick panther-like prowl. She eyes him and his nectarine and lets out a loud yelp. Harry doesn’t know if nectarines are safe for cats, so he apologises instead.
Having sat back in his chair from before, Draco listened as Hayes outlined her plan. He was to visit her office once a month for a checkup, avoid flying, soft cheeses, pâte and alcohol – basically, everything that he enjoyed – and not go over the top using magic. “After all,” Hayes said, handing Draco a printed booklet, “it has to support the two of you now. You might find your energy levels declining as the months progress. Do you have a good support system in place?”
Malfoy cuts the butter into neat squares, tips it into a bowl of flour, and then digs his fingers in. His slender fingers work the butter into smaller pieces and he says, "Will you read me that bit in that cookbook right there, the bit about the crust." Harry points to a passage, and Malfoy nods. Harry reads to Malfoy about pinching the butter into flat pieces and then kneading the dough just a bit and Malfoy nods along, his fingers still working in the bowl. "Can I trust you to drizzle that ice water into the bowl?"
When the waiter comes to take their order Harry has managed to hang on to his shrimp tempura roll but Malfoy has wheedled and cajoled and dared Harry to try the yellowtail hamachi with sliced jalapeño and the soft shell crab roll and a roll with eel and something called masago. All of which, Harry must admit in short order, are quite good, which Harry thinks will make Draco look smug, but actually he just smiles his cinnamon roll smile.
Malfoy hands him a pasty and unfolds a napkin containing the chocolate buckwheat biscuits and then gestures at the wine bottle. "Uncork it."
. Draco mentally chastised himself. He was talking to himself like a sap and a Hufflepuff. He couldn’t afford to let his guard down, and develop feelings that weren’t reciprocated.
Mediwitch Hayes waved her wand, and spoke the incantation. Harry took hold of Draco’s hand, enfolding it in his own while twirls of shimmering purple filled the room. The enchantment was more intense than the last time the
"One crier counts for five," Ron says as Hermione walks in the front door, coming home from the Hogwarts library. "Hermione! Guess what? Harry kissed Malfoy again!"
Harry serves himself a crepe that's a funny grayish color but he's eaten far worse at the hands of Petunia Dursley so he can stomach whatever's in this gray crepe. He puts clotted cream and oranges and honey like Malfoy did, thinking at least he'll like the toppings, and then takes a bite. It doesn't taste at all like a gray crepe ought to taste, it's pleasantly wheaty and almost sweet.
Draco had to fight hard not to cry at the sight of Harry, though he knew that was just hormones, the nightmare and the residual fear he still felt. It was obvious that he’d woken Harry from a deep sleep, for his hair was wilder than Draco had ever seen it, and he was wearing an ancient and very grey Weird Sisters tee-shirt over thin pyjama bottoms. Draco felt his cheeks flush at the sight of Harry’s bare feet. The nakedness of them felt terribly, achingly intimate, and Draco swallowed, his mouth dry.
“Merlin,” Harry said, holding up a tiny babygro. “Look at this, Draco. How sweet is this?” It was a very pale yellow, and had a picture of a wand and stars on the front, as well as the message, ‘
“Will you book an appointment?” Draco asked, pushing his arms through his sleeves. He stood up, picking up his satchel from the floor. “It shouldn’t take up too much of your day. Then you can put all of this out of your mind.”
Hermione takes a deep breath. "Anyway, there's a lot of literature exploring these questions. How do we acknowledge victims' suffering and injustice without demanding retribution and punishment? How do we recover from human rights violations in ways that respect everyone's human dignity? Things like that."
He slips on his wool slippers and fumbles his way to the kitchen to brew a strong cup of coffee in the Italian stove top espresso maker he got himself for Christmas. This morning he'll use the Italian espresso beans sent along with his vegetables and the other goodies Draco gleefully added on to his farm share. That's why Draco chose this farm, because they work with other farms and cheese makers and old Italian grandmas who hand-make their pasta and tiny shops that have been air drying their cinghiale since the Renaissance so that Draco can check a box on a beautiful handwritten form saying yes, he'd very much like parmigiano and polenta this week.
“You can’t say things like that,” Draco said, his entire body trembling with shock and upset. “You can’t- can’t just say these sentences like they’re innocent and meaningless. You’re a fucking wizard, Harry,” he managed. “You ought to know bloody better.” Draco reached for his wallet, and threw coins down blindly. Suddenly, he needed to get away from the café, and away from Harry with a violent determination. He’d go to the Manor, or to Pansy’s. Draco needed to be anywhere but here. Harry gave him a confused look, his eyebrows drawn close, his brow knitted. It was clear he wasn’t following the conversation. Bloody hell, but why was it so difficult to find the right thing to say? “Words matter.” Draco finally managed. “I’ve fallen in love with you and I have to get over that, Harry, because this baby –
"I was asking questions to learn more. You should try it some time. Besides, I got to talk to a gorgeous Italian man." Malfoy pours himself a glass and then looks up at Harry, a question on his face and it takes Harry a moment to realize he's asking if Harry wants wine and not if Harry also thinks Andrea is a gorgeous Italian man (the answer to which is unequivocally yes, but Harry is too stunned to say so).
Draco preened with the praise and he turned for the door, pulling his shirt over his head as he did so. He flung it back in Harry’s direction, and the other wizard caught it with ease. “Excellent reflexes Seeker Potter,” Draco admired, opening the door with a flourish. “Now, are you going to hurry the fuck up Harry?” he asked, “or do I have to need to start warming myself up, all by my lonesome?”
“It is a great honour to see Master Draco visiting the Manor once again,” she smiled, holding her hands out for the bouquet. “Adrianne will be taking the flowers for Mistress Cissy. She asked that you please make your way straight through to the green drawing room. Luncheon will be served at twelve promptly. Would Master Draco be wanting a glass of his favourite Merlot?”
Harry pushed inside, deeper and deeper, and Draco whined with a pleasure that grew with every depth Harry conquered. “Another finger,” Draco demanded, covetous and lusting. “Loosen me up, Harry.”
"This is a beautiful fillet of red snapper, it will not be drenched in batter and oil until it is unrecognizable and unremarkable."
"Maybe it's Polyjuice," Hermione says, smiling like Malfoy's new behavior isn't deeply disturbing to her.
“Ron, can you find me a pen?” he says. Ron looks confused but dashes out of the kitchen for a pen, as Harry tries to find a piece of paper and fails the first two tries, going, stupidly, for the wrong cupboard at first and realising he is confused about his own kitchen layout.
He looks down at his cereal bowl for help but it's empty. He can't sit at the kitchen table the rest of the day staring at Malfoy's bum. He has to do something, anything else.
Draco paused, his words drying up in his mouth. Harry and he hadn’t planned this part of the conversation. Before they’d had sex, their friendship had been based on booze and laughter, nightclubs and dancing.
, Draco. It's a much more reliable source of news. Unless of course you're looking for news about Harry's dating, then the
confirms it.” Braithwaite flicked his wand so that the tiny pulse grew bigger. “Embryo looks to be about the size of a blueberry, so you look to be about seven weeks in… Does that date fit with any kind of timeline you’ve got in mind?”
Harry gets up and goes down the hall to the kitchen where Malfoy, upon seeing him, runs over to put his hands over Harry's eyes.
His figure was changing and flourishing with every day that passed, and since he’d always been such a slim, wiry chap, his expanding bump felt like a lot. Each night Draco had taken to gazing at himself in the bedroom mirror, taking in his rounded middle from every perspective.
Harry does so, feeling like he was caught doing something he shouldn't, cataloguing Malfoy smiles. He tucks into his porridge, determined not to look up from his bowl until it's empty.
Pansy was quiet for another long moment, but nearly a quarter of a century of friendship meant that he knew the exact second when Pansy decided to believe him. Her eyes widened, and her mouth fell open, just the tiniest bit.
Draco waved his wand. “You don’t have to,” he voiced weakly. “I was having a stupid, dreadful dream, and then I woke up, and- well, I was trying to get to the loo, and then I had a bit of pain… Felt exactly like a Cramping Jinx. Bloody hell, but I was scared, but now- now I think I’m alright. I- I got rattled, that's all. But I think I’m fine."
The eyes of the table swivelled over to him, and Draco felt the warmth of their concern wash over him, their magic a tangible presence. It wasn’t an act, put on to appease Harry, but genuine care that he could feel radiating from every member.
When Draco finally slides into Other Harry with slow, short thrusts, Harry’s vision blurs with want. It’s all too much and he has to bite on his knuckles to stop himself from joining Other Harry in his moaning.
He washes the dishes after — by hand, the way he saw Draco doing the night before — and puts everything back exactly the way it was.
Draco felt fondness roll through him. He wasn’t sure that he agreed with his Mother’s opinions entirely: there’d been a good couple of days where, too nauseous to move, he’d felt the honour of bearing a child was the greatest of nightmares.
“I’ll talk to him this week,” Draco finally answered. “He’s- he’s a good person. Honestly. Even if he doesn’t want to be involved, I’m sure I can get him to come and meet with you.”
Draco snaked his hands over the surface of his tee-shirt, feeling the brush of the material over the silky-smooth skin beneath. Harry’s words rang in Draco’s head. The other wizard had lost his own parents, and was then forced to live with his abusers. He’d been brought up in a privileged world of pure-blood lies and now his own father was rotting his life away in prison.
"The war, Potter. You can't imagine what living with Unforgivable-obsessed sociopaths for a year is like."
That fact seemed to surprise Greg. Draco decided to keep quiet about the fact that Harry had agreed to come alongside on the visits to offer moral support and guidance. He offered Greg his choice of cakes from The ‘Elfy Bakery and the mood between the two wizards quickly revived.
I was a complete and utter shit to Longbottom. I know I did awful things, okay? I simply refuse to live the rest of my life making myself ill over them. I cannot change my past actions, all I can do is be better going forward. Satisfied?"
The next night Hermione brings home several stacks of books she's managed to pry from Madam Pince's skeletal grip and Malfoy brings a bag of groceries and another bottle of wine. Hermione wants to present an alternate history curriculum to the board of governors, one which includes more Muggle and creature history and, Malfoy, while agreeing on this point, argues with her.
Draco nods decisively, once, his lips pressed together into a thin line. Lips Harry has kissed. He has no idea how Draco reacted when Harry kissed him. He wishes he had asked Ron for more information this morning instead of literally plugging his ears. Was Malfoy disgusted? Or did he kiss back? Or was he disgusted
And that's how Harry ends up in the housewares section of a wizarding home goods store arguing with Malfoy about china.
The bed was a massive thing, covered in a royal-blue quilt and mounds of pillows, and there were photographs on the table beside it. The first Draco recognised: it was the
Harry picks up Yip and holds him away from his face, where Yip had been trying to excavate Harry's nose. Yip weighs approximately an ounce more than a feather, seeming to be made up primarily of hair.
Draco huffed and puffed, but the gap was too wide, and no amount of tugging or pulling helped. Draco stared at his reflection in the mirror, feeling a little horrified by the sight reflected back at him. The trousers – his loosest, roomiest pair - only reached halfway across his bump.
When Harry tries to point out that Malfoy's opinion on his mattress is not required because Malfoy will not be sleeping in Harry's bed, he gets pink again and then flounces off to the pillows, where he advises Harry to get "
"You really are going to pick out the ugliest set just to spite me aren't you?" Malfoy says, pinching the bridge of his nose.
name on the top of that prescription, Harry, not yours! We’re not bonded – not even a couple – and even with your Order of bloody Merlin the Apothecary won’t hand you that potion! It’s totally against the law.” Draco groaned. “And I
Harry wasn't exactly taking in the decor on his last visit to Malfoy Manor but he thinks he remembers there
Malfoy, mercifully, keeps his mouth shut at this statement from Ron and Harry thinks maybe they'll all get out of this relatively unscathed for once.
“It is so,” Harry answered, sincere, his palms hot on Draco’s shoulders, and his green eyes deep as pools. “I didn’t just bring you here to see our baby’s nursery. I brought you here because… well, I wanted you to have a fourth option. Wanted you to see another house, one that you and your bump might like to move into before December.”
They spend the morning bringing the doll sized pieces of furniture to the many rooms of the Manor. Malfoy takes a lot of time arranging each piece once it's unshrunk and somehow Harry ends up holding the other side of the couch or armoire or desk more often than not as Malfoy decides it needs to be three inches to the left. By lunchtime Harry is sweating and starving.
bloody Harry Potter. He wanted to be involved? Wanted to be there for him, and their baby? Draco found that very hard to believe. The problem was, Harry’s words made him feel optimistic. They made him feel hopeful, and hopeful was dangerous when it came to Harry.
Draco shrugged. He wasn’t about to share what he’d been thinking about and make Harry feel awkward and embarrassed. “It’s always that bit more real afterwards,” he answered. “Only five more months left, and I’m hoping to move house before they’re born. Half-Moon Place isn’t suitable for a baby. There are anti-extension spells in every room. No outside space to play, and there’s hardly room in the hallway for a pushchair. I’ll be damned if I have to go home to the Manor. So, I need to get myself organised. Contact some wizarding estate agencies and book myself some visits.” He quirked a wry smile in Harry’s direction. “You could come along,” Draco suggested. “You’ll want to see where your child is going to be living, I’m sure of it.”
“Feeling better Draco?” Marcus queried, nodding at the bottle that Draco was sipping gingerly from. “How long you been feeling rough for? I noticed when you came in that that you’d lost a couple of pounds.”
Shocked, Harry takes the basket Malfoy shoves into his arms and goes to the counter to pay. Neville doesn't say anything as he rings up Harry's flowers and neither does Harry and it's all so awkward Harry thinks maybe he'd rather die again than stand at this counter another minute.
With that, Harry let go of Draco’s fingers, and he wrapped them around Draco’s prick. Full-body shudders seized Draco, and he heard himself moaning, whining, the pleasure tipping him over the edge within mere moments. His head swam, and he felt heat roll through him from the very end of his toes to the roots of his hair. Harry fucked him through it, cautious and too careful until he climaxed too, gasping Draco’s name.
"We were thinking just friends. Having mum and the family over will be a whole thing and I'm not keen to feed my whole family on my Sickle."
They're in St. Mungo's lobby within three minutes and Harry is quickly and efficiently telling an intake nurse everything he knows while they put Malfoy in a bed. They take Malfoy back and Harry collapses into a waiting room chair feeling like he ran a marathon.
Harrys’ hand moved under Draco’s clothes then, those clever fingers of his pulling his tee-shirt off him as he spoke a litany of how attractive Draco was, and how cherished. It was simultaneously exciting, but still more daunting that anything they’d done up to that point of the evening. He looked so different to what he’d done five months before. Different to what Harry was used to. He was getting bigger with their baby, and unexpectedly Draco felt insecure, doubts clouding his mind like a spell.
Two weeks passed, and before Draco knew it, the time arrived for his and Harry’s next appointment at St Mungo’s. Draco was glad. He’d been feeling worn-out, almost lightheaded as each afternoon progressed, and it frequently coincided with Harry’s visits.
Harry actually licks his bowl clean, much to Malfoy's combined delight and disgust. The sun is bright through Harry's golden curtains and Harry's feet are tangled with Malfoy's under the covers while they drink their coffee and tea.
Malfoy sets down his knife where he was chopping an onion. "Because I got some beautiful lentils in my farm basket and—" Malfoy stops, looking sheepish.
Draco felt his words dry as the sight of Harry’s stag filled his bedroom. “Is everything okay?” the stag asked, Harry's voice sounding wide awake, and frantic. It was only then, with no remnants of his pain remaining, that Draco thought how this must look to Harry. There was no going back now. “Is it the baby?” the stag demanded, but before Draco could answer, it carried on speaking. “I presume you’re at home? I’ll come over right now.”
"I do understand. I'm sorry Neville, I didn't mean to—it's not like I think any of those things are ok."
. Only you, Harry Potter, could describe works of art as mere pictures. If I owned a genuine Mondrian, I’d be telling the sodding milkman,” Draco said, coming to a standstill beside Harry. They were stood in front of a door made of knotty pine wood. “I assure you that whatever is behind that door won’t be even half as impressive. Maybe not even a quarter as impressive.”
"As if I would joke about something like that," Hermione says. "Do you think I'm hermetically insensitive?"
Harry thinks about Thestrals and rock cakes and Malfoy all weekend. He doesn't know how to fit this piece of Malfoy into the larger puzzle. He arrives at Malfoy Manor on Monday morning hoping there's breakfast and determined to figure out Malfoy's motives.
"It's right here," Bill says, patting his pocket. "That's some Undetectable Extension Charm on that bag, Malfoy. Must've cost you a fortune."
Harry Potter – Puddlemere’s famed Under-21 Captain – was drunk, sat on his settee and sat on his lap.
He takes Harry to high-end boutiques that smell too strongly of cinnamon and clove where he fondles every overpriced pillow and where Harry buys fair trade cotton silk blend sheets woven by Belgian elves in a shade of pale pink the same color as Malfoy's cheeks.
Draco paused and swallowed. Harry looked mildly alarmed. “Come on, Draco,” he said, breaking the silence. “Out with it.”
He tries to distract himself from this weird situation by trying to decipher what’s for lunch solely by the ingredients on the counter, but the collection leaves him stumped. Maybe Other Harry has yet to bring a crucial ingredient out of the fridge.
Best of all, though, were the walls. They were absolutely covered in photographs. There seemed a hundred different ones of Harry, Ron and Hermione from a hundred different occasions. The so-called Golden Trio. Draco could see photos of the three of them in their matching red school uniform robes, pictures of them sat inside the Three Broomsticks, and others taken before Puddlemere games with Harry leaning against his broomstick.
The toast is, unfortunately, worth the seven Sickles and Harry buys a crackly round loaf to bring home.
Lacing their fingers together, Harry led Draco further through the house, and as they approached the kitchen, Draco felt his belly growl in appreciation. Ron had been right: dinner smelt fantastic.
Harry's work days are much quieter than he's become accustomed to in the last year. He thinks he'd feel twitchy and bored if he wasn't so tired. Malfoy spends most of the week writing on a stack of documents at the kitchen table which leaves Harry to his own devices. He sits in the hallway with a paperback he doesn't have the energy to open and quite frequently naps. Which is why he's surprised when he finds Malfoy in the kitchen on Friday looking harried and chopping chives at a speed that would worry Harry if Harry cared about Malfoy chopping off his fingers.
"Why did I have to kiss him?" Harry moans, covering his face in his hands. "Why couldn't I kiss literally anyone else?"
The pounding of his heart made Draco feel dizzy, and he decided that standing might not be the best idea, not for the next few minutes at least. How had he gotten himself in this predicament? He was twenty-three and theoretically intelligent. Images of Harry flickered through his consciousness. His lean, beautiful body during sex, and the rueful, apologetic look that he’d worn when he’d told Draco that he didn’t want anything serious. The very idea of telling Harry he was pregnant made Draco want to Apparate to the Manor and hide behind its tall walls for the rest of his days.
Harry retrieves the butter and then tries to hand it off to Malfoy but Malfoy pushes it back at him.
In Harry’s kiss, Draco was home. Whitsand Bay, St Mortimer’s Place and Marlborough Road had all been wonderful buildings but without Harry none of them would ever be home. That was why he’d been unable to buy anything for their baby yet. He couldn’t bear the idea of having their baby without having Harry by his side. When their kiss ended, Harry was blushing, and Draco knew he was grinning; knew his his feelings were painted on his face like a foolish fifteen-year-old. Draco couldn’t care less. He was besotted, and achy with happiness.
For a moment, Harry looked like he was going to argue once again. Indignant magic fizzed from the wizard, and Draco had no doubt that had the double-award winning journalist Rita Skeeter been there before him, she would have found herself cursed into her insect Animagus for the foreseeable future. His face began to relax after a few minutes had passed, though. They’d both known that an exposé was imminent after their visit to Diagon. The only surprise was that Cuffe had held off until the Sunday edition.
Trust Malfoy to have milk fresh from the bloody cow. Harry grabs a bowl and spoon and he's about to start eating when for some unfathomable reason the words, "Are you having any?" come unbidden from his mouth. Harry shoves a bite of wheaties in his mouth to stop any more awful questions coming out.
If Malfoy thinks it odd Harry hung out in his cold cupboard for a minute too long he doesn't say so. Harry sits down at the small kitchen table, having decided it's safer to watch Malfoy than stand at his shoulder taking peeks at his sodding eyelashes. Once Harry gets over his momentary hormone-driven lapse of judgement the morning passes with the soothing hum of Malfoy's quiet activity.
They’re stepping into the bedroom when Draco says, eyes fond and smile soft, “You really are an awful sharer.”
Greg placed his sandwich carefully at the side of his plate. “Draco,” he said, clearly displeased by the answer. “That wasn’t what I asked.”
These were all valid, rational arguments, and Draco took a thoughtful sip of his tea. While he’d been sensibly trying to convince himself to end his pregnancy, his drink had gone cold. A tap of his wand warmed it back to an agreeable temperature.
Coming closer Harry sees he's pushed all the blankets off and is covered in a thin sheen of sweat. Harry sits down on the bed and rocks Malfoy's shoulder to wake him.
after a few minutes, and Draco crossed his arms, hanging back whilst Harry the celebrity drew all the stares. It was only when they exited, and stepped on to the cobbles of Diagon Alley, that Harry spoke again. He’d obviously decided to change the subject.
Various Trainee Healers come and go, taking notes and running diagnostic tests. The Healer-In-Charge comes in near lunch time, but he's curt with Harry when Harry questions him, giving Harry single word answers that answer precisely none of Harry's questions. He siphons a bit of Malfoy's blood into a vial, casts some spells and leaves as if Harry isn't sitting there trying to keep it together and failing. He doesn't even say when he'll be back.
“A daughter then. When she’s a bit older we can bring her to watch our matches. Narcissa too, of course. I mean, can you imagine anything better for a witch, seeing Daddy flying and catching the Snitch? Everyone will adore her, Draco. Our own little good luck charm.” Harry’s expression was wistful, almost dreamy. “Of every wizard in the world, I’m glad that it’s you I get to share this with.”
"Leave me and my toast alone," Harry says but he lets Malfoy tug him into an alleyway and Apparate them to a bakery off the side of Diagon Alley.
Malfoy slowly runs his finger tips up Harry's neck and then cradles his head between his hands, tipping Harry's face up for a kiss. This gentleness is new for Harry and sometimes he has to remind himself not to hold his breath. He closes his eyes, just feeling Malfoy's fingers in his hair, his thumbs smoothing over Harry's cheekbones, Malfoy's breath against his lips when he leans down, their lips almost, almost touching.
"Sure," Hermione says distractedly, shuffling through her books. "Did you know the last several headmasters have all given Binns consistently negative reviews, but without the Board of Governor's approval are unable to do anything about it?"
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s comment. “It’s my inner sanctum,” he joked back, hoping he sounded suave and not completely like an idiot. “Now, are you going to spend all night admiring my living quarters, or are you actually going to fuck me, because-”
be happy in this house, in his own version of Grimmauld Place? Happy with, of all people, Draco Malfoy? What a thought.
Malfoy doesn't respond at first because he's flipping the fish in the pan wielding a spatula in each hand. He stands back looking pleased with the flipped fillets. "I mean this in the nicest way possible, but Hermione scares me."
"Aren't you angry with him? Doesn't it feel weird to, I don't know, be friendly with him after everything that happened?"
Pulling on Harry’s ludicrously red Gryffindor dressing gown, Draco padded down the stairs. The smell of pancakes filled Grimmauld Place and Draco followed his nose to the kitchen.
That was the sort of comment that would normally have had the pair of them in stitches. Draco hadn’t even told Pansy about his makeshift brassiere, but for some reason, Greg didn’t seem to think Draco’s anecdote was all that hilarious. He chewed the crust of his chicken sandwich thoughtfully, and covered up the smallest of burps with the side of his fist.
Hagrid has to bend in half to get through the door, then he stands looking like he feels out of place just inside the door. He's holding a large bouquet that's mostly Scottish thistle and purple heather and Harry knows he went out and picked it by hand and loves him immensely.
Draco simply lies there for close to an hour listening to Harry's deep breaths and watching the sunlight start to slant through Harry's golden curtains. He has to fight the desire to stroke Harry's hair because he doesn't want to wake him. So instead he looks his fill at Harry's long dark eyelashes that he would steal for himself if he could, and marvels at the shape of Harry's shoulders under his disgusting tee shirt. Draco will take Harry to get real pajamas today.
"Ugh, fine," Malfoy says, sitting up straighter. "If you're not going to let the injured rest. I apologized because it seemed like you wanted me to."
"I think what Ron is trying to say, is that anger isn't a sustainable or enjoyable way to live, even if it's completely justified."
Now that Sunday had arrived, Draco was cursing his past-self with all manner of horrible hexes. He’d felt so happy and safe in Fratelli’s that he’d agreed to this visit without thinking about the consequences of actually having to be brave enough to step through the door, and face a bevy of ginger-haired Weasleys.
Draco swung around to face his co-parent. Bloody Harry and his high-mindedness! “Salazar!” Draco hissed, shaking his head heatedly, “Frobisher’s? Near Diagon Alley? It’s
Malfoy starts whisking a mixture of butter and flour in a pan and tells Harry to drizzle in the milk.
Harry stopped dead at Draco’s words, and turned on his heels to face him. “Don’t go yet,” he urged, giving Draco’s forearm an urgent squeeze. “Stay with me a bit longer,” Harry cajoled, waving his hand in the direction of Diagon. “We’ve just met our baby, got our due date, and been told they’re healthy, Draco! We should be celebrating, not slinking off back home.” Harry laughed, very taken by his idea and Draco felt all his willpower leave him. “My treat,” Harry continued, “anywhere you fancy. Come on! We’re both hungry, and I’m not ready for this morning to end yet.”
“A wonderful choice,” the saleswizard assured the pair of them. “This’ll look perfect in your nursery, gentlemen. You won’t regret your decision.”
Harry kisses Malfoy's soft pink mouth, briefly, because he knows how tetchy Malfoy gets about his timers, and steps back.
He’d seen them both naked the day before, but this is so much different. Right in that moment, this is everything Harry has ever wanted. Draco is, in bed, the same he is with Other Harry in every other way. Gentle, full of praise. His hand grabs a hip — firmly, but his thumb never stops rubbing the skin under, he runs his hand through Other Harry’s hair — passionately, but he bends down to press a kiss to his temple as he does.
"I mean it, Harry," he says, voice low and strong. Then he pulls Harry into a searing kiss. Not his usual slow and tender meandering kiss, but hot and sharp and breathtaking. When he pulls back Harry is dazed. A lot has happened this afternoon, first Luna dropping the word
For the first time in months, Harry Floos to the Ministry. Just standing in the Atrium is enough to fill Harry with a vague sense of dread. As he takes the elevator down to the Auror's floor, the feeling grows.
Harry takes a scalding sip and finds it does ground him a little, if only because he's thinking about his burnt tongue for a moment instead of Malfoy's head lolling lifelessly on his shoulders like a cut string puppet. The solace doesn't last long, but he keeps sipping, it's something to do while he waits.
Malfoy squeezes Harry's bicep once more and steps back grinning. "Shall we get you your very own Auror Potter muscle mania quilt?"
Malfoy looks up from a cookbook, a small smile on his face and reaches for a white paper-wrapped package, opening it up with a ceremonial air. "Look at this, Potter," Malfoy says, revealing a thick fillet of pink fish.
"I need cocoa before I can talk, and you know I can't Summon it from your ridiculously high shelves."
Draco saw the little limbs that were moving around, wiggling inside of him. He saw their little one’s torso, their head, and most significantly, the flicker of their powerful heartbeat.
"I let Malfoy get cursed. It was probably on Diagon, that's the last thing we did before he started feeling poorly."
Malfoy closes his mouth and then spends an inordinate amount of time brushing invisible crumbs off his face and lap.
Draco wobbled over to the twin bed, and threw himself down on the covers. He was really glad there was still an hour for him to snooze before their pre-game warm-up session began.
Harry grins at that and Ron claps him on the back. "A little fighting does the body good. Gets the heart rate up. You need that now that you have a cushy security job."
"I do mean it. But that's not what you actually want. You want retribution, you want me to prove I'm suffering for all my wrong doing. You want me to cry or crawl on my knees or be filled with self-loathing because that would neatly fit with your punitive and simple conception of justice."
Narcissa looked at him thoughtfully and, very deliberately, she placed her own cutlery on her plate.
“You weren’t this studious back at school,” Draco ventured, knowing his comeback was feeble. “Whenever did a thickhead like you get so well-informed?”
The pictures are the easiest clues to decipher, even if they leave him slightly baffled and breathless, somehow. There are pictures of Ron and Hermione holding a small girl with Hermione’s big brown eyes and hair, and a smile just like Ron’s.
Harry reaches around Neville to grab another butterbeer. Dean and Seamus brought fire whiskey and Harry's feeling a little fuzzy around the edges. "Do you want a butterbeer?" Harry asks Neville.
is not the word Harry would have used. He tries to find a way to describe what a terrible idea it is to invite Malfoy to a party full of people who fought on the opposite side of a war
amongst their social circles – it hadn’t happened. Usually, Draco tried not to dwell on these things and for many years, the upcoming Quidditch season had always been enough to fill his days with training and redirect his energy. This year was different though. There was a very special reason – one that grew a little bigger with every day that passed – that Puddlemere’s 2004-2005 season wasn’t quite the distraction that it normally was.
"It's similar to a croissant but it's been laminated with butter and sugar and the sugar caramelizes as it bakes."
“That wasn’t what I was talking about,” Draco whispered, his spare hand finding Harry’s bicep and holding the other wizard tightly. “Do you always have to be so wilfully dense? I was talking about us. The
’ and dancing to a Celestina Warbeck song that was playing on the wireless. Announcing himself with a cough – not wanting to spook Harry while he was cooking – Draco walked up behind him, and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist.
"Because I can't stand that, Potter. Nothing was ever good enough growing up and I'm not living the rest of my life that way. Especially not with you."
Other Harry turns on his side slowly, tucks his head under Draco’s chin. Harry can’t help but notice the fingermarks on his hips, wondering if they’ll turn to bruises the next day. A sunbeam pokes through the curtains, muted by the gauzy fabric but glowing on the two sweat-shiny bodies on the bed. Draco’s hair gleams in the light.
Malfoy tilts his head, considering Harry for a moment and then grabs his elbow, tugging him back to the counter.
Harry puts his hands on Malfoy's ribs, feeling the tender spot just beneath and leans up to kiss him. The kiss starts as a gentle press of lips. As soon as their lips touch Harry doesn't feel awkward anymore, he feels like he wants to nibble on Malfoy's bottom lip. So he does just that while Malfoy's hands do wonderful things in Harry's hair, scratching and softly tugging. They press closer together, Harry can feel Malfoy's chest against his own, but the kiss stays soft. Malfoy pulls back sometimes and Harry can feel him smile against his lips before kissing him again and again, their lips clinging to one another.
"What's vegan? Is that like vegemite?" Ron asks, uncapping a butterbeer and lounging back on their new couch. Hermione sits next to him, explaining with ever mounting exasperation that yes, some people do choose to eat that way.
“Hello,” Draco said, giving Harry a stupid little wave as he walked towards him. Ugh, but ever his voice sounded odd, croaky and false. “You’re right on time,” he added, cringing at the sound of himself.
Louis St Clare snatched the Snitch from Lewandowski’s fingers, propelling Puddlemere to a triumphant victory at only one hour and six minutes. The fans and the pundits were effervescent in their praise, and the
Draco flinched at that. He couldn’t help it. In his mind’s eye he saw how devotedly he’d bragged about Harry the moment that Greg had arrived through his fireplace. How he’d talked about Harry like the wizard were his own beloved, rather than just the fellow baker of the bun in his oven. Draco thought back over all the stupidly happy, hopeful little moments that Harry and he had shared in the past few months. The meals that they’d eaten together, and the visits that they’d made. All the compliments that Harry had given him, and he’d been fool enough to listen to.
He looks at her, and then turns to Ron who steps forward to hug him, too. Harry’s heart is still beating in his ears but his panic is subsiding as understanding slowly dawns on him that he’s just back home, where it all started.
“It’s stupid,” Draco argued, shaking his head. What must Harry think of him, and his vacillating ridiculousness. “I’m stupid. I had a dream – had a nightmare – and then, when I woke up, I had a couple of really awful pains.” Draco sniffed, and then a tear rolled down his cheek. He rubbed it away, disconcerted. “Lowish, in my belly. It was like… Well, I thought I might be going into labour.”
It's three in the morning before a Healer comes out to the waiting room. Patients and families have come and gone but Harry's stayed, waiting. The Healer calls Harry's name and Harry jumps up, spilling cold tea on himself, but he hardly notices.
. I saw the hurt on your face, even though you hid it well from the Weasleys. I thought we’d ride it out, but when it came down to it, and I saw the words in print, riding it out wasn’t what I wanted. What I told Cuffe, I meant; you, and our baby are my family, and that means you come before anybody else.”
It was simultaneously such a good, positive experience – his baby was growing, getting bigger, making themself known – but equally it felt utterly terrifying. It was as if his body, always so reliable and dependable, had reneged on some unspoken deal. Draco hadn’t been able to fasten his trousers only the day before, and he’d wept at just how out of control his whole world had seemed.
Bloody hell, but this was ridiculous. He half-expected Harry to present him with a sprig of rosemary to pin to his lapel, or ask for his mum’s permission to court him. Draco took back his earlier thoughts. This wasn’t like the Yule Ball at all. Going out on what amounted to a real date with Harry was a hundred, thousand times worse.
"I did try to warn you," Malfoy says, bending to let the little fur ball down and Harry confirms it is in fact a dog when it jumps onto his chest and starts licking his face.
"I feel that way sometimes, especially when I'm overwhelmed. Are you overwhelmed?" Luna asks him, with those wide guileless eyes. With anyone else Harry would lie.
He looked down at his own basket. Unlike Harry, all he’d picked so far were a couple of white vests and some baby socks. It was a pathetic haul. “It's hard to decide what to buy when we don’t know what we’re having,” Draco said, changing the subject.
," Malfoy says, tugging on Harry's hands and shirt and waist until Harry's sat on his lap, knees on either side of Malfoy's narrow hips.
At Luna's question Malfoy's small smile grows, like the sun first peeking up over the horizon. "I swirled in some homemade apple butter."
"Er—" Harry says. The truth is, he's not really sure. Harry doesn't usually take the time to think of how he is. "To be honest, I'm not sure."
Then Other Harry takes a few steps closer, and pulls a chair out, as if to sit on. But he doesn’t. He just leaves the chair there, almost like he’s offered it for Harry to sit on, and turns back to his lunch prep.
“Where’s Granger?” Draco asked, looking furtively over to where Ron was sat beside Ginny and Oliver Wood, laughing over some shared joke, and supping Butterbeer. “Don’t tell me that love’s young dream is on the rocks?”
The noise of Café Quendryth fell away. Draco felt sick, and raw, and uncomfortable. Poor little orphan Harry was finally getting his family, but Draco would have to settle. His existence would be one beside the love of his life, but perennially at a distance. A family, but in fragments. The future seemed to open in front of him, a chasm of hurt. Of all the lives Draco could have experienced, this wasn’t what he would have chosen.
“Oh, how exciting,” Molly said, reaching out to touch his bump before snatching her hand back. “Dearie me!” she laughed, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to excuse me. I do get a little over eager at the prospect of a new baby.”
Harry nods and that's when Malfoy stops sucking kisses onto Harry's neck and starts sucking on Harry's lips, lightly and with little nibbles. Then the oil pops again and Malfoy pulls away so fast Harry thinks he's been burned again but actually Malfoy is just in a tizzy about the olives.
of her against his hands, and her last kick was the strongest of them all. Harry was beside him in an instant, asking if everything was alright.
Elianna’s third letter arrived three days after that. Draco petted the sweet girl, and opened the parchment with a sense of resignation. It seemed that ignoring Harry simply wasn’t working.
"I should have added the tomato sauce at least three minutes ago. The garlic is almost burnt. Go sit down, Potter, you're too distracting."
Malfoy doesn’t take long in the bathroom but comes out fully dressed, with no sign of work robes. He bends down over Other Harry on the bed to kiss his face and when Harry groans again, he says simply, “Wednesday. Breakfast with Pansy before work. Get up soon or you’ll be late.”
"No, shut up. You do. You think because I don't prostrate myself I haven't changed. You've never asked me how I've changed, you've only ever made stupid assumptions and told me I should feel worse than I do. You want empty demonstrations of shame instead of my real effort to be better and if that's what you're waiting for then you're going to be disappointed."
The corridors are quiet as Harry slips through them looking for the long term care ward. Luckily the doors are labeled with patient names so Harry doesn't have to be a creep poking into other patients' rooms. Malfoy's room is at the end of the corridor. He sets a spell he learned as an Auror to alert him of approaching people and quietly ducks into the room.
They eat chocolate and apricot jam sandwich biscuits and then Malfoy tells Harry to bring all the flowers to the table. Harry didn't have the wherewithal at the time of purchase to ask Malfoy why he was buying twenty bouquets of various flowers, leaves and feathery fronds. But he wants to know now because it's a little overwhelming all piled on his kitchen table.
“Bloody hell,” Greg said, standing in the doorway. “Malfoy, that fucking reeks.” His voice sounded odd, muffled, and Draco knew from experience that his mate had cast a Bubble-Head Charm. That bloody wizard had the most sensitive belly that Draco had ever known.
Draco hadn’t wanted to be a father, not at twenty-four, not unbonded, but now he couldn’t imagine a different future. Draco hadn’t wanted to forgive Harry, but somewhere along the line, he’d fallen in love with him.
“Fine. I have been spending most of my time with Harry,” Draco retorted. Out the blue his appetite had disappeared, and Greg’s visit, one he’d been looking forward to all day, suddenly felt uncomfortable and awkward. He’d wanted to hear gossip about their mutual friends, not hear a half-baked lecture about his conduct. “What of it?”
Wilfully ignoring the swirling, whirling nerves in his belly, Draco stripped off the far too clingy jumper that he’d worn to tidy his home and pulled on his new shirt. He didn’t think that Harry would imagine him fat and ugly – Merlin, but he hoped the other father of his baby wasn’t that small-minded – but, nevertheless, Draco wanted to look as good as he could. Malfoy pride still counted for something, surely? Frowning, Draco checked himself from every angle, resisting the urge to fuss with his clothes. Harry wouldn’t be able to spy his tiny baby bump. It wasn’t as if there was much to see yet, anyway.
"As if you, rich, white git extraordinaire with your fancy parmesan and your imported Fiori di Sicilia extract, would know what the proletariat eats. You probably think Marie Antoinette had the right idea."
Somewhere in his twenty-four years, Draco had dismissed kissing as a childish, teenage thing; something to be done and dispersed with as part of foreplay. He swore that he’d never be that closed-minded, not ever again. Kissing – with Harry, anyway – deserved his attention and plenty of devoted practice. It deserved to be enjoyed for its own sake.
He felt Harry step closer, felt Harry fit into the new contours of his body, and hold him close. All of a sudden, everything became clear. The witch had been right.
Draco thought about where they’d been, Harry and he, and where they were now, thought about their past, their present, and their future, and he knew he wouldn’t change a single day of it.
“I will,” Draco said. His and Harry’s eyes met, and Harry’s face was inscrutable. It was time to leave, and to go home. He thought that he might sleep for a week after this meeting. Cry, and then sleep for a week. “See you when training starts,” Draco said, in lieu of goodbye.
All of a sudden, he was craving his bed like never before. Perhaps, when he woke, he’d discover the last six weeks had been nothing but a dream, and that he – and now their baby – hadn’t been Harry Potter’s big mistake.
As it turns out, the last tiny piece of furniture to fall out of the bag is the kitchen table. Malfoy holds it in his palm for a long moment, just smiling.
Harry drizzles the thinnest stream of water possible into the bowl, having to stand quite close to reach around Malfoy's hands which are still in the bowl. Malfoy tells him to stop, precise but not sharp. Standing this close Harry can smell Malfoy's soap. He watches the careful way Malfoy mixes the dough, almost tenderly, and starts when Malfoy tells him to drizzle more water. Harry does, carefully, trying to be as careful as Malfoy.
, all of them written on the front of the paper, where everybody can see them.” Wiping his face with the back of this hand, Draco paused, took a breath, and made the effort to steady his voice. “And you’re right,” Draco said, looking down at his protruding bump while he spoke, “Even though having a child wasn’t anything we had planned or even supposed we wanted, it doesn’t matter. I wouldn’t change anything now. I’m excited for our baby, and sharing fatherhood with you. But Harry, why’ve you done this? Why did you talk to Cuffe? The other day, before we Flooed to Diagon, you said that you’d never put out a statement, or give an interview. Those were your words. Said you didn’t care what fibs they made up about us, that it was our business and nobody else’s.”
Maybe because Malfoy is rubbing up and down Harry's back, but it almost sounds soothing. Like Malfoy is acknowledging Harry fought hard and often and now it's time to rest. Harry tucks his head underneath Malfoy's chin and closes his eyes, breathing deep and steady, the scent of Malfoy's fancy soap on his skin already becoming familiar.
Draco would have hexed Harry for his impertinence but the aftershocks of his enjoyment were still ringing through him. They died abruptly when Harry shifted, and pulled out. It was obvious immediately that the condom had split and Harry pulled a face, his brow furrowing at the sight.
He won't ever get that drunk again, he decides, shuffling into the kitchen in search of a large stack of buttered toast.
Harry, git that he was, seemed to want to lacerate his heart. Rather than Apparating away, he simply stood there, and carried on speaking. “Last night was a mistake,” Harry explained, compounding Draco’s humiliation with every word. “Too many shots of Firewhisky and not enough to eat. Bloody
There wasn’t a reply to that, not really. At least, there wasn’t one that Draco could utter and still keep his self-respect. The half-Potter interloper in his belly fluttered and a feeling of contemptible humiliation swirled in his chest. How could he be so floored by two pathetic words and the brush of a finger? Draco knew he was hormonal, knew he was sleep deprived, but there was more to his reactions than that.
abysmal,” Harry scoffed, guiding Draco to the side of the pavement before they quickly crossed the busy London street. “It’s not as if I’ve got an amorous, love-‘em-and-leave-‘em reputation like Louis St Clare.” Dodging Muggles, Draco padded along the pavement beside Harry, wishing hard that he’d worn a coat to hide his tummy, but the July weather had been too sweltering. It wasn’t non-magical folk that he was concerned about – they’d just assume he liked a beer, or three, every Friday night – it was other wizards, who’d likely spot his condition a mile off. Harry didn’t seem to care about that not-so-little problem though. As soon as they were free of the crowd, the green-eyed wizard carried on speaking. “I haven't even had a boyfriend since my accident,” Harry continued. “The newspapers love to speculate, but until you, I hadn’t been with anyone since Richard… We broke up while I was still in St Mungo’s.”
Harry levitates the cast iron table out the open French doors and Malfoy sets the postage stamp sized kitchen table down on the floor and stands back while Harry enlarges it. Malfoy is positively beaming when Harry lowers his wand, the table back to full size and nestled perfectly in the nook of windows opposite the stove top and counter. It's on the small side, not like the giant dining tables set in other rooms. The top is laid with tiles of various colored flowers, each with a little border, no two tiles alike. It's perfect in Malfoy's gold and green kitchen. Malfoy steps forward and runs his hand over the surface, his happiness so unadulterated. Harry watches him trace the flowers with his slender fingers until he can't bear it anymore.
One of those war criminals is Malfoy's father. Harry looks to Malfoy to see his reaction, which is calmly eating arugula salad.
The older wizard might have replied, but before he got a chance to there was a cacophony of noise. The Weasleys had returned; flush from the afternoon sun, giddy, and joshing each other loudly. Harry barged into the room before a few minutes had passed, agitated magic bouncing from his person. His face was knotted with worry.
Draco cast his eyes over the views and the ornately decorated rooms, and he felt the sparkles of the buildings magic across his skin. Judith wasn’t fibbing. This was a bright, airy place, and he didn’t doubt it when she told them that there had been a lot of interest. They concluded their tour beside a shimmering blue pool that overlooked the beach. “I’ll give you both five minutes to take in the view,” Judith suggested smoothly, taking her leave of them. “I’ll be inside when you’re ready.”
Harry is quiet. That is what he wants but he's unwilling to admit that Malfoy's right about anything and see that stupid smug look again.
Draco’s fears were unwarranted, though. The taunts and insults never arrived, and he began to realise that Harry hadn’t been spouting a cliché when he’d called the Weasleys ‘his people’. They really were the other wizard’s family, and he lost count of the good wishes he was offered, the hands that he shook, and the various wix jumping up to offer Harry and he their seats.
Finally, Draco’s eyes land on the armchair Harry has claimed as his bed. “Don’t sit on anything, just in case.”
Harry deepened the kiss, increasing the pressure just a fraction, and Draco could feel the shape of the other wizard’s smile.
-hell,” Draco growled, trying to pull on the slate-grey trousers he been wearing previously, and realising, with a sinking heart, that Sticking Charm on them had broken. Worse, he didn’t have his wand! He’d left it in the kitchen where he’d used it to brew their tea. There was nothing for it. Draco made for the door, and gave Harry a shout. Fuckity-fuck-
Draco would have told Goyle to mind his own business, but Millie arrived back then with a fresh bottle of wine and a soft drink for him. He had to be content to scowl in Greg’s general direction as he sipped the drink, and to listen to Millie natter on about their bonding ceremony, and the various guests that Mummy wanted in attendance.
Enchanted Properties was the name of the wizarding Estate Agents that Draco had contacted, and they came highly recommended by Pansy. Their representative, a tall, willowy witch by the name of Judith met the two of them at the first building that Draco had envisioned that he, and the baby might live in.
Malfoy sprinkles a couple more pinches of salt and tastes it again, this time smiling that small pleased smile Harry is starting to recognize.
“So, what are we waiting for?” Harry asked, taking Draco’s hand, giving him an infectiously enthusiastic grin. “I’m not sweating away the next hour hanging around in St Mungo’s, not if I can’t help it. Come on.” He continued, guiding him towards the door. “Let’s make a day of it. We’ll go to Frobisher’s, collect the potion, and then we could go out baby shopping? You’re not the only one panicking about getting things ready for our little one. Even Kreacher has scoffed at my lack of preparedness! I need a crib, clothes, toys… Basically everything. I suspect the last baby that Grimmauld Place saw was you, Draco. I’d like to get a few things, or at least see what’s out there. We could go back to Fratelli’s, if you liked. We had a brilliant meal, last time we visited.”
God bless Ronald Weasley, Harry thinks, for just knowing. Harry opens his mouth, feels like the words are caught in his chest, and closes it again, shaking his head.
decor. There are no fancy end tables with thirty Galleon floral arrangements or gilt frames of illustrious ancestors. There aren't even curtains on the windows. Many of the rooms they pass don't seem to have furniture, though Harry can hardly get a good look trying to keep up with Malfoy's fast pace. Their steps echo in the cavernous empty corridors because there are no plush expensive rugs on the floors.
"I am not suggesting antiques, that would look absurd in a modern era flat. You need a throw blanket."
“I’d love to,” Harry answered, linking his arm inside Draco’s as they made their way towards the public Floo. “Beer and biscuits sound like the perfect end to the perfect day.”
With that, he began rocking his hips, tiny movements that pushed a little deeper with each thrust. He ran his hand down the inside of Draco’s thigh, gently pushing his leg up, and the new position eased Draco into enjoying the stretch and the sudden, brilliant fullness.
Draco turned over and squashed his pillow around his ears. Why was Goyle snoring so loudly? Had he always been so noisy? The wizard sounded like an Erumpent! That was it. Draco knew when he was beaten.
"Did you not hear me or are you just surprised anyone would ever choose to associate with me again?"
Besides, they’d be busy. Greg had Quidditch to play, and Pansy had Theo and Cygnus. He ought to go to bed. Get some rest. Enjoy the quiet while he still could. That was what Mother would say, had she been here.
Before many more minutes, Harry had guided them to the destination that he’d had in mind. It was a small Italian restaurant called Fratelli’s. Set back from the path, the building was made of soft yellow brick, and covered with ivy. Harry guided Draco towards the door.
Draco let his eyes drift over the other man in a way that he’d forbidden himself to since their night together. Harry looked great. He was dressed in tight Muggle jeans, and a shirt that looked touchable and soft. His Captaincy meant that Harry wasn’t as lithe as he’d been back in his playing days, and his arms were wide with potent muscle. Draco dragged his eyes away, not wishing to be caught ogling.
“And the sort that Harry and I shared was definitely the latter sort,” Draco smirked. “Bloody hell, but it was brilliant. The best snog ever. It felt like somebody had cast a Jelly-Legs on me. I'm only glad I was sitting down.”
Harry drops his head onto Malfoy's shoulder, just trying to catch his breath and finds the task extremely difficult because Malfoy slips his hands underneath Harry's shirt and starts nibbling on his ear.
He was anxious about not to be sat around for too long in the waiting room, and potentially being recognised. He wasn’t naïve. His pregnancy would be outed eventually, but right now the last thing Draco wanted was his face emblazoned across the front of the
he can't bloody well Stun Malfoy's pet birds—and then the peacocks are swerving to the side of him and Malfoy's running now, still shouting, "Shut the gate, shut the gate, you bloody imbecile!" and Harry lurches over to slam the gate shut, the peacocks flapping their wings in their abrupt halt. It's quite some time before the peacocks stop squawking and the fur ball stops yapping and the giant cats stop trying to climb Harry, meowing and sinking their claws into Harry's Auror robes, and Malfoy stops shouting, "Back you awful beasts!" in his stupid posh voice like some tiny impotent king.
"I don't think moving on automatically means forgiveness. I think it just means moving on," Ron says, ignoring Harry's crisis, or one of them.
, shagging Cormac McLaggen while I was in St Mungo’s having my bones spelled back together. It felt like we’d never, ever happen, and then, when it did, I was scared. You were everything, and when I saw you, stood there, making me breakfast in your dressing gown, I didn’t think I could be the man you deserved. Like a fool, I ran.”
This was their new beginning, after all, and it wouldn’t work unless Draco let himself believe it. He pushed Harry back until he was sitting on the bed and then climbed in after him, straddling his hips. He leant down until their lips were almost touching, and let Harry move in the rest of the way. Harry did, kissing Draco slowly and deeply until Draco could feel his lips start to tingle with it, felt his breath coming far too fast. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and then he pulled him close; pulled him until their bodies were touching all over.
“I’m massive,” Draco muttered, knowing his face has flushed a furious red. “Hippogriff-sized.” He didn’t want to say anything else, didn’t want to say
Harry doesn't know what to think of Malfoy anymore. He had scoffed when he first learned Malfoy would be testifying against Death Eaters, it had seemed like just another way the Malfoys planned to slither out of real consequences by any means necessary. But then Draco testified against his own father. The
“It’s still early days for that,” Hayes answered confidently, meeting Draco’s gaze. “I wouldn’t expect you to feel anything until you’re close to the twenty-week mark. You’ve got nothing to worry about there. What about your energy levels? Have you been taking care of yourself?”
“Gods,” Harry said, sounding impressed. “You totally sure you’ve got enough space in here? Bloody hell Draco. This room is bigger than the entire house I grew up in.”
Draco supposed that his feelings did matter. Draco knew that he’d fallen for Harry and knew that every day their lives enmeshed just that little bit further, he fell ever deeper. He couldn’t help it. Draco wanted to tell Greg that he wouldn’t let himself be hurt, but Draco hadn’t ever been that clever. Not when it came to Harry Potter, anyhow.
“People talk and talk about Harry being a hero,” Draco added then, not sure why he had to justify himself, only knowing that he ought to, “but nobody knows about his good heart. That’s when I knew I loved him. When I knew he’d never let me down. I’m sorry,” Draco finished. “You asked a simple question. You didn’t want a diatribe.”
"I don't think I feel that way," Harry says, only realizing as he's saying it how true it is. He's not sure how he was expecting Ron to react, but it's not the wry smile he's getting now.
"Well I'm not going to. I'm not going to spend my life proving to every war hero that I'm suffering enough. I shared a dinner table with Fenrir Greyback for a year. I'm done with suffering. Now are you done with that kale?"
There wasn’t much more to say after that. Draco was emotionally exhausted, and Harry appeared attuned to the fact. He dropped Draco’s hand, and they finished off the last few bites of their croissants silently. Draco tried to conceal a yawn behind the back of his hand, but he wasn’t successful.
The two of them stood there, a pair of besotted fools, until their daughter finally ceased her kicking. It was at that point that Harry’s pancake, already burnt to a crisp, decided to fill the kitchen of Grimmauld Place with acrid, unpleasant smoke.
Mother and he shared a strong bond, and Draco was entirely secure of her love for him, but they’d neither of them ever been effusive about it. Feelings were a discussion reserved for other people, and that was alright. It didn’t mean their relationship wasn’t a positive one. The world of Draco’s childhood, a pure-blooded, aristocratic existence, might had been blasted into a million pieces by the war, but neither he nor Narcissa had ever been able to unlearn the polite, well-bred customs that were all they’d ever known.
Harry chortled at that, a real belly laugh. He slowly withdrew his hand. “Thank you,” he said. “You won’t be able to get rid of me. The ‘Elfy Bakery will be sick of the sight of me.”
Draco smiled and moved closer to Harry. He let himself be enveloped by Harry’s arms before he replied. “I love you,” Draco said, the words slipping from his lips as easily as a charm. “And there isn’t anywhere I’d rather be.”
As he ate his dinner, he observed Narcissa silently. There was a brightness about her eyes that Draco couldn’t remember seeing since long before the war, and that warmed his heart. His baby would be wanted, and very loved.
The other wizard had prepped Draco so beautifully that his body was pliant and receptive, and Harry’s thick finger slid to the first knuckle with little resistance. For a moment, Harry paused, doubtless to give Draco time to adjust. Draco couldn’t wait though. He was greedy for the stretch of Harry’s prick.
They Floo back to Malfoy's warm little kitchen and Malfoy pulls down the purple cookbook and starts flipping through it.
All around him, Draco’s teammates were laughing and larking about, while he felt like he’d aged a decade overnight. At last, finally, it was time to see the Mediwix. Draco insisted that Greg sod off, and go and train with the rest of the team, but Goyle wouldn’t be dissuaded. Truth be told, Draco was relieved. Even admitting he was pregnant aloud seemed like an impossibility.
“Very unfair,” Draco said, nearly tripping over himself as he stepped out of his trousers. “I’m nearly naked, and you’re still fully dressed. Think we can even things up a little?”
Harry doesn’t know what to react to, first. This Other Harry referring to Malfoy as “babe,” Draco Malfoy willingly mentioning Ron, or the fact that, outside of the photographs, he thinks his other self is beautiful. Is that a little self-absorbed? He’s not quite attractive. He’s still him, still a little on the scrawny side. But Harry still wishes he was
Harry Floos over the next morning to find the kitchen is empty. Feeling a little uneasy, Harry, Yip at his heels, tries to remember the way to Malfoy's room. He gets turned around a few times but eventually finds it. Malfoy is still asleep.
Malfoy takes a sharp right down a claustrophobic staircase that ends in a surprisingly small kitchen. The ceiling is lower here which is much cozier than the towering hallways and empty rooms, and the coziness is further enhanced by the golden yellow walls and dark green cupboards. The open shelves above the cupboards are filled with crocks in saturated blues and yellows, and brown speckled cream mugs. Copper pots hang over the range. There are even little blue vases with cheerfully haphazard bundles of wildflowers. All together it looks like the kind of kitchen in
Draco’s heart sank when he saw Elianna, Harry’s snowy owl, hovering in front of the window pane. It could only mean that Harry was cancelling his visit that afternoon.
Harry’s lips were on his skin, and his fingertips clutched so hard on his shoulders that Draco knew they’d leave marks. In his shagged-out, post-coital ecstasy Draco wondered whether he’d even had better sex. If he had, he couldn’t remember it. Harry let his weight drop onto Draco and he let out a long, contented sigh.
your bedroom,” Draco repeated. “And this is a picture of your parents! Your most treasured possession, Harry, or did you forget that you’d told me that? Why, exactly, are all my clothes in what is clearly your wardrobe?”
"How charming," Malfoy says. "As it happens I prepared some soup. Mr. Weasley, would you like to take a break for lunch?"
Ron picks up one of the vegan chocolate cupcakes and swallows half of it. "These vegan ones aren't bad," he says, stuffing the other half in his mouth. "Who knew Malfoy'd be a good cook?"
"Malfoy, I've literally been working twelve to fifteen hour days since the day I killed Voldemort. Even if she hadn't been gay Ginny would've broke up with me."
The man behind the till looks up at Harry's words and, if possible, his expression turns even more sour.
“Hello,” Draco replied. He imagined how he must look to Harry. Casual in pyjama bottoms and a ludicrously fancy dressing gown, his initials monogrammed into the velvet. He swallowed, uncertainty flooding his belly and making it flip over. He stared into Harry’s green eyes for just a beat too long. “I began breakfast,” he said eventually, the words sounding thick and ridiculous in his ears. “I didn’t know what you liked, but I imagined- “
Twenty minutes later Harry is squinting up at the wrought iron gates of Malfoy Manor. He was told the gates would open for him when he arrived but he's been standing here like a pillock for five minutes at least and the gates show no sign of changing that circumstance. He could Apparate back to the Ministry and Floo to the Manor from the office but while Harry's mostly not fussed about this assignment that doesn't mean he's keen to trail after Malfoy all day.
Harry doesn't have the energy to explain the body of Christ to Malfoy, especially while he's reading the menu.
Gingerly, Draco got to his feet and scuttled back through his bedroom. Should he call his mother? He couldn’t imagine her dignified person sitting beside him at St Mungo’s. She'd be out of place, and frightened, and just entirely wrong. He remembered how upset she’d gotten when she mentioned the Room of Lost Things, and Draco knew he couldn’t put her through that again. Pansy would flap and squawk, and make a drama out of a crisis. Greg would be as useless as a chocolate cauldron. Draco groaned. Who was he trying to trick? There wasn’t anyone in the world that he wanted except Harry.
And the cycle repeats: blood orange olive oil pound cake and chard, raisin, and butter-toasted pine nut spaghetti; walnut brutti ma buoni biscuits and escarole and chickpea stew; brown butter cardamom biscuits and spinach fontina and white bean crostata. Thus Harry ends up with stone ground flours and heirloom beans and a Slytherin green enameled cast iron dutch oven.
Sitting in the sunshine he starts to doze, listening to some bees busy in a sprawling purple flowered bush. He's getting
Harry takes a bite and frowns. It is the best porridge he's ever had, creamy and perfectly sweet and somehow the oats taste… oatier. And the stewed fruit is a pile of apples that taste like they came straight from the inside of an apple pie. Harry watches Malfoy smile down at his own bowl of oatmeal, a fragile wisp of a smile Harry's sure he's never seen before.
They were the same words that Mother had used, and just like with Narcissa, Draco wasn’t sure how to answer. Arthur had been so kind and welcoming to him, when he’d had every reason to show abhorrence, or simply show Draco the door. Draco didn’t want to lie to this man whose decency and integrity felt real and instinctive. So, Draco put his mug down slowly, considering his words. It wasn’t as if there was a chance of being overheard. Harry had gone to play Quidditch and to mess about with his friends, and Draco wanted to be honest.
Café Quendryth was every bit as packed as their previous visit, but miraculously their elf-waiter was able to secure them the same table as before.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, holding up his hands in a gesture of bafflement. “I planned to bring something for brunch, so I went to Diagon, and before I knew it, I was standing at the till, handing over my Sickles.” He shrugged. “I just wanted to do something practical.” He laughed, a little awkwardly, a little self-deprecatingly. “It was a stupid idea.”
"Malfoy, huh?" Ron says, not looking up from the paperwork for three separate cases he's filling out simultaneously.
"I'm not promising anything," Harry says. There are in fact some things Malfoy could say that would invoke Harry's righteous anger.
Draco wondered, for a moment, whether he’d never woken up from his nightmare. How could Harry sit there, and say these things so casually? There had been plenty of low moments in Draco’s life, but this has to count as the worst. His hands felt clammy once more and he wished, fervently, that he could, for once, act like a normal person around Harry Potter.
Harry has tried not to think about it, but when it slipped through his defenses and he imagined how the people in his life would react to him giving up Auroring, he imagined everyone would be disappointed. But so far it's like everyone was hoping he would and it makes Harry wonder just how miserable he's seemed this last year.
As if involuntarily, Harry’s eyes shut. His heart swells and his head swims. His body is stuck between lust and shame and guilt and want. He takes this time to calm his breath, and sits with the overwhelming feelings storming his chest.
In the twenty-three years of his life, Draco had rarely felt like this much of an idiot. His heart skipped a beat and, though he desperately wanted to reply with a clever, cutting witticism, his words stuck in his throat like a bezoar stone. He picked up his teacup, just for something to do with his hands, and clasped it hard. The knuckles of his fingers turned white. “Okay,” Draco answered, sounding every bit as dim as he imagined he looked.
“What’s on your mind?” Harry asked, putting down his fork and meeting Draco’s eyes. “You’re thinking. I can always tell.”
But as their chests rise and fall, as the sound of their breathing quiets the room, the exhaustion of his long work day and his unexpected visit to another timeline catch up to him. And Harry falls asleep, too, head falling backwards onto the soft back of the armchair, one socked foot escaping just slightly from under the cloak.
"But that's your mum. Not Draco Malfoy. If I had told you a year ago that Draco Malfoy would serve me crepes and oranges at a little breakfast tête-á-tête you would've checked me over for potions."
Malfoy obliges, his grip on Harry surprisingly strong for someone in a hospital bed. He pulls Harry down to meet his lips and fucking devours him, sucking on Harry's lips and tongue. Harry has no idea what's gotten into Malfoy, but he certainly doesn't mind being kissed like
"Listen very carefully, Potter. I did not invite you here to pass judgement on my every action. You're here to make sure I'm not murdered in retaliation." Malfoy says slowly, enunciating each word like he's explaining something to a toddler. "But since you seem to think you're the ultimate decider of everyone's just desserts, let me clarify for you that I am not asking for anyone's forgiveness, not Hagrid's, not Luna's, and most certainly not yours."
, Draco conjured the shimmering silver peacock that symbolised all his positive experiences. Occasionally, Draco had struggled with this charm, but today, with Harry’s words swimming around his head, the Patronus arrived with barely even a thought. A further speedy wand flick sent the peacock whirling away to his co-father.
The Weasleys and their bonhomie would be a part of Harry and their child’s life that he’d be forever excluded from. Draco took a sullen sip of his fizzy water; upset at the path that his thoughts had taken. “I’m only surprised Weasley didn’t spontaneously combust,” Draco said, knowing that he sounded a little mean, but not able to help himself. “I’m sure he was appalled when you informed him you were having a baby with the Ferret.”
Malfoy does stop talking. He doesn't stop sucking a series of purple bruises across Harry's neck and clavicle that Ron will tease him mercilessly over for the next week.
He looks at the bathtub with curiosity. It’s a thing of beauty, it really is. Bigger than any that Harry has ever seen, a beautiful swirl pattern of pink and beige veins through white marble. Harry traces the edge with his index finger just to feel the cold stone.
Harry casts on their shoes and clothes and does a warming charm for good measure and as he tucks his wand away Malfoy tugs him toward the village.
"Why would you think—" Harry has to stop. He doesn't actually know why he's so angry. Maybe it's the presumption, like of course Harry would like a
Malfoy is quiet for a long time. "I can trace my lineage to before the Founders. When I was four years old I was taught to recite my family tree as a party trick."
The wizard had taken Draco’s joke entirely to heart and, in the two weeks since they’d first shared brunch at Half-Moon Place, had never arrived without one of their bags clasped in his hand. Draco hadn’t only been treated to croissants, but to so many cinnamon rolls, pumpkin pastries and chocolate eclairs that he’d taken to giving them to Adrianne to share with the rest of the Malfoy Manor house-elves.
Harry doesn't say so but he's glad it's porridge and not cold cereal. It's only that Malfoy's porridge really is more delicious. Today it's got toasted walnuts sprinkled over the top and a pile of something very orange and very goopy.
“Gracious,” Draco murmured, feeling a bit stunned by the choice. “Pansy did warn me that the furniture they made here was majestic. I hardly know where to begin.”
“Good morning,” Harry said brightly, as Draco stepped to the side and allowed him entry. “Croissants. I bought croissants. I know how much you like them, Draco. Remember when we won against the Wasps? You were so ebullient that you owl-ordered croissants for the whole team.”
The conversations around them continued apace. Charlie, a wizard much older than Harry, was keen to talk about his own ‘babies’, which turned out to be a pair of recently-hatched Horntails that he’d been feeding by hand. Percy, a wizard that Draco recalled being terribly cheeky to at Hogwarts, talked at length about his Ministry job, and how proud he was of being close to the Minister. Mr Weasley – a man that looked precisely how Ron might, had he have taken an aging potion – was quiet, but he looked on proudly at his family. For the life of him, Draco couldn’t understand why his father had vilified this mild-mannered, easy-going man to such a great degree.
He watches Other Harry fall asleep on Malfoy's chest, turn around, Malfoy’s arm reaching for him, body wrapping around his, both falling asleep again, then both turning on their back, one leg over the other’s thigh —
He walked through room upon room, and each seemed to be filled with windchimes, crocheted blankets, and what seemed like dozens of Weasley siblings and their partners. At first Draco felt shy; cautiously waiting for the cutting comments and unkind remarks to begin. After all, why should any Weasley feel they had to be agreeable to him? This family had been his father’s personal bête noire, with their rejection of Sacred Twenty-Eight traditions, and their wholesome, Muggle-loving ways, and Draco had been nothing at school if not Lucius’s mouthpiece.
Hayes nodded her approval. “I think it is for the best,” she said. She handed over a couple of leaflets, reiterating everything that he had been told, and giving him a little information about the three trimesters. Draco stuck them straight into his satchel: he’d look at them when he got back at home, and had the time to concentrate and really take in everything he ought to know.
Harry stops. It sounds like… it sounds like Malfoy noticed Harry was upset about Aunt Petunia never even trying to make something Indian for Harry, that he picked up on Harry feeling like he missed out on his dad's culture. Next to Malfoy's cutting board is a new cookbook Harry hasn't seen before, turned to the page for dal makhani.
Harry flips the page. "Mashed fava beans with escarole," he reads aloud, "I don't know what any of those things are."
“Gods,” Draco muttered through his teeth, his hand clinging to the polished mahogany of the railing as his mind flew in every direction. This couldn’t be
"Jesus Christ," Harry says and Malfoy says, "Who?" and Harry understands now the urge to throw up one's hands in utter exasperation.
He’d gone to bed at eleven, lights out exactly when Flint had requested, but not a single blink of slumber had been forthcoming.
Harry climbs onto the large fluffy bed and starts counting the pillows. "Did you know there are twelve pillows on this bed? Why does one person need twelve pillows?"
"Well, looks like we agree that he should be angry at me. This is going better than usual," Malfoy says with a touch of sarcasm.
But Malfoy made certain choices, bad ones. He poisoned Ron, cursed Katie, called Hermione ugly slurs, hurt Hagrid, Neville… He hurt a lot of people and enabled others to hurt even more.
Malfoy's whisking and measuring with all the surety he had in Potions, moving with purpose, a plate here, a flip there, bringing things to the table without looking at Harry. Soon it's set with a teapot and cloth napkins and a breakfast spread that makes Harry remember he skipped his this morning. There must be thirty dishes on the table. Two plates stacked with crepes and speckled ceramic bowls of sliced oranges, a flower patterned cow creamer, rotund little pots of honey and jams, shallow dishes of clotted cream, a jade salt cellar and spoon, a ceramic colander of radishes, tiny bowls of whipped butter. Harry doesn't envy the poor elf that does Malfoy's washing up.
Against every expectation, Draco had managed a couple of hours of sleep, and he’d had an appalling dream. He’d been in St Mungo’s with his mother beside him, and he’d lost something, something vitally important. He’d cried out and shouted, but nobody had noticed or cared. When he’d woken, he’d been sweaty, and more exhausted than ever.
Draco is still in the outfit he was wearing that morning, but Other Harry is wearing a large white tunic that stops just under the knees and looks ridiculous with his shin-high black socks and white  trainers.
Harry doesn't. He's not sure Malfoy could say anything that would make him feel better about calling Hermione a Mudblood for six years, but Malfoy looks so smug when he thinks he's won so Harry says, "You have to mean it."
“Draco,” Harry murmured, as he turned, ever-so-slightly, and then Harry did kiss him. Harry’s lips were soft and welcoming, and in their touch, Draco felt the promise of the years ahead, and the sweetness of knowing that he, and their baby were truly loved.
"That's not how it works," Malfoy says, also laughing. He shifts to lay down and pulls Harry down with him, running his fingers through Harry's hair. "Least I've got one organ that wasn't damaged."
“I’m going to grab you a drink and put the pie in the oven. Can I get you anything else? Do you want me to read to you?”
There hadn’t been an argument from the green-eyed wizard. “Just as long as they’re happy,” Harry had answered affectionately, his gaze finding Draco’s bump. “And they feel loved. That’s all that matters, really.”
.” Harry put his arm around Draco’s shoulders, and then, all of a sudden, wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into a whole-hearted, and very reassuring hug. Draco buried his head into the thin cotton of Harry’s navy-blue Puddlemere tee-shirt, feeling quite justified in his foolish hormonal display.
Pansy made an incoherent noise. “Fuck, Draco!” she exclaimed. “I thought you’d Firecalled to gossip about some new bloke that you’d managed to snag and shag,” She snorted, inelegantly. “Though you obviously managed the shagging part without any difficulties.” All of a sudden Pansy pulled a face. “Oh, Draco,” she asked, suddenly abrupt. “Is it Cormac’s baby? You told me that you were finished with him, forever! That wizard is an utter blockhead Draco, and he made you feel as low as a worm-“
– and the needy rasp of his voice was a potent aphrodisiac. Before he could reason himself out of it, Draco found himself dragging Harry’s top over his head and pulling him down for another heated kiss.
Mother gave him a concerned look from across the table. “My dear. I don’t remember you liking mustard to that degree,” she said, casting her eyes over his plate. “Do be careful! You’ll give yourself heartburn.”
He's very quiet as he puts Lord Yipslington in his little pen and extinguishes the oven and follows Harry outside to a gray and cloudy day.
Having a baby with somebody was very fucking serious, wasn’t it, and with that thought Draco made an awful noise, half-sob and half-snort of laughter. What was he supposed to do with a baby? He’d actively avoided holding Cygnus, Pansy and Theo’s son when he was tiny, fearful of his smallness, vulnerability and newness. Draco hadn’t wanted to sully him somehow. Thoughts of his godson, with his tiny fingers and his head that had seemed somehow too big for his body were much too much for Draco to cope with.
“Szymon Lewandowski looks like the Pudd’s biggest threat,” Harry said, before swallowing a mouthful of tea, warming to his subject as he spoke. He’d been in a conference with Marcus Flint and the Puddlemere owners for much of the previous day, and he was visibly animated by their plans for the upcoming season. “He’s given the whole of Montrose a jolt, and Marcus reckons the rest of the team will have upped their game accordingly. They look like our biggest challenge. Flint thinks our best hope is to get plenty of points in the bag before Lewandowski catches the Snitch. Then we’ll have a slim chance of winning, whatever the outcome.”
Harry didn’t. Consent given, Harry applied a new, gentle pressure to his puckered entrance, and his every touch set Draco aflame. With a nod of warning, Harry breached Draco.
Malfoy tastes a measured sip of wine and licks his lips slowly. Or maybe it's Harry's brain that's moving slowly.
Harry hops off the counter and goes to the cupboard to find the kale. There's only one bunch of large green leaves so Harry doesn't have trouble finding it.
"I think this orange has gone off," Harry says, poking at the dark red and orange mottled fruit in his bowl.
After lunch, Harry swallows his pride and asks Malfoy for help. "D'you know where wizards buy furniture? Is there a place?"
The thought of food made Draco’s belly lurch once more, and he curved over the toilet, screwing his eyes shut as vomit stung his throat. When, after a few minutes had passed, and nothing more emerged, Draco sent a prayer of appreciation up to Merlin, Morgana and all the deities. He stood up slowly, his legs quivering like they’d been hit with a Jelly-Legs Curse.
article and a Quidditch game run on too long? Harry kissing his tummy? Merlin, but it made his cheeks flush and his legs into jelly. Draco really didn’t want to meet Arthur’s eyes, knowing that his every emotion would be pasted there, as bright and blaring as any charm. But eventually, Draco plucked up the courage, his good manners winning out over his nerves.
Draco listened to all the sounds of Café Quendryth. There was the chink of china, the sound of muted laughter and of Sickles being placed in the till. It seemed bizarre to Draco that Harry and he were sat there, having a life altering conversation whilst the rest of the world carried on with their lives.
When he emerges Ron and Hermione are still at the table, looking expectantly at Harry and Harry still has a half hour before he needs to go to the Manor for work. He has been effectively trapped.
will have plenty to say. The Puddlemere fans too. Bloody hell. Even the changing room. Everyone will want to add their two Groats, and we’ll be the talk of the League. All the old headlines… Sectumsempra. The Saviour and the Death Eater… Even Lucius, still rotting in Azkaban. Once we get seen together, there isn’t any going back. There won’t be a wix on Diagon that isn’t talking about us.”
“Alright,” Pansy enunciated crisply. “Greg put you up to this, didn’t he? Come out, you utter git. You’ve had your fun.”
Placing his overflowing basket on the floor, Harry leant in and rubbed Draco’s bump gently. “When Molly asked, I said I wasn’t sure,” Harry responded, voice soft, “but if that’s what you want, then I’m on board with that.” Harry laughed then. “Means I can veto all your posh name choices too.”
Malfoy puts on a floral oven mitt and pulls the scones from the oven. He sets them on a rack to cool and starts slicing the strawberries. Harry stands at his back, resting his cheek on Malfoy's shoulder and winds his arms around Malfoy's thin stomach. Harry can't stop touching him.
"You're ridiculous," Harry says, kissing his forehead. He runs his fingers through Malfoy's silky hair, only it's not very silky right now. "Your hair's greasy."
journalist isn’t far behind. If they publish pictures then the rumours will start. Are you sure that you want that already?”
Draco was. The sweat on his palms had dried, and his heartbeat had slowed. He didn’t want to admit it aloud though. Saying that meant that Harry would leave, and he wasn’t ready for that.
Draco was still smiling far too widely, and the Wrackspurts in his mind were far too noisy to give Harry the clever comeback that he deserved, so all he did was nod. “Is that so?” he asked.
and thus are crowding the living room instead of the built-in shelves. The cupboards in the kitchen are bare, even the cold cupboard, because Ron hasn't had a chance to drop by the Burrow and collect the food Molly made them, "just until you're settled in." They haven't even a sofa or a table, since they wanted to shop for those things all together.
“I’m only upset that you’re telling me now,” Narcissa replied, her tone measured. “My darling boy. I love you more than the moon in the sky, and I can’t abide that you’d have thought I’d be upset at this news. A baby, Draco! Merlin’s greatest gift to wizardkind is a new magical being, and the honour of bearing a child is a wix's greatest privilege.”
had breathlessly covered every detail of the trial, practically salivating over the drama. Harry had submitted his own testimony by owl and then expected the Malfoys would no longer be part of his life.
“We’ll get a couple of these,” Greg decided, taking a Perfectly Potente Pregnancy Potion from the shelf. “This one is 99% accurate. And we’ll take two of these too,” he said, picking up a Wizard’s Choice test from the shelf below. “Trusted by wix for a generation,” Greg read from the bottle. “That sounds like just the ticket.”
Draco looked at the cribs, glowing with magic and the choice on offer suddenly felt like too much. He’d have to come back another day.
"I don't care," Malfoy says. He takes Harry's face in his hands and stares into his eyes, looking solemn and intense. "I'm not going to hurt you, Harry."
Draco’s fingers trace Other Harry’s spine, making him squirm and giggle, softly. Other Harry waves a hand gently over his own body and Draco’s but it’s only when Draco says a quiet “thank you” that Harry realises it must have been a Cleaning Spell.
Draco hadn’t been able to help himself. He’d dozed as soon as his head had hit the pillow, sinking into a deep sleep where Harry’s green eyes sparkled, and words of true love dripped from his lips like honey.
“Mistake, my pert arse,” Pansy retorted. “He got you pregnant so there must have been something special between you both. He could hardly have thought you were a Mountain Troll.” She sighed dramatically. “Oh darling. Harry and you! You’re both as hopeless as each other. Both blind to the truth, Draco, and at least Harry has the excuse of glasses. Neither of you have ever had even a clue about the other. You’ve never been able to see what was so clear to the rest of the world… And now you’ve a baby between you.” She pursed her lips. “Oh, darling. You don’t do things by halves, do you?”
his coat, and pushing his arms through the sleeves. “That pregnancy test you talked about on Tuesday? Seems like it might be a good idea.”
They go to warehouses with rows upon rows of carved wooden bed frames and Harry falls in love with a gigantic white frame carved with flowers and buys it on the spot, forgetting his mattress is too small. So Malfoy takes him to a mattress shop where they serve Harry tea and Harry buys a larger mattress and six goose down pillows that feel like heaven, or even better than heaven, based on what Harry has experienced of it.
Malfoy was hit with a curse, the Healer tells them, they're still unsure what exactly, because they've never seen it before, but the curse slowly eradicated most of Malfoy's red blood cells, resulting in damage to various organs that were deprived of oxygen. They stabilized Malfoy last night with an oxygenation spell which they will continue to cast as Malfoy's body slowly creates more red blood cells. They'll also be administering a course of potions to repair the damage to Malfoy's internal organs.
and telling him he doesn't have to forgive Malfoy, then he finds out Malfoy was probably awake for the whole conversation, the bastard, and now Malfoy's telling him he won't hurt Harry and kissing the life out of him.
Greg gave Draco a hug before he left. “Look after yourself,” Greg said. “I have to get back to Mils. She’ll curse me to dust if I’m late for this blasted meeting.” Clapping Draco on the back, Goyle offered a final piece of advice. “As for Harry, mate? Don’t settle for second best. Remember when we were at school? You used to drive everyone bonkers with that poncy catchphrase?
Somehow Harry ends up going in a circle and winding up in the entryway, twice. After the second time he throws open the front door and, muttering to himself about what git Malfoy is, starts circling the house peeking in through the windows like an idiot.
falling for Potter’s charms.” Huffing out a breath, Goyle shrugged. “And there’s never been anyone else for you, has there, really? Not since you were an aristocratic little shit with a rod stuck up his arse.”
Yawning, Draco gave his own photograph a fond glance, and placed it carefully within his medical notes so it didn’t get creased. He’d swing by the curio shop on the way back home and find a frame. Add it to his mantlepiece. “I should get going,” Draco told Harry. “This morning, it… Well, it was definitely something, wasn’t it? I’m famished now I've remembered how to breathe and actually form words again.”
“We’re celebrating,” Harry said, before he leant over and found Draco’s lips. “Celebrating because I get to kiss you now, whenever I wish, and I’ve wanted to do that for a very long time.” Kissing, it seemed, was an activity that the pair of them were doing now, and Draco could only wonder how he was going to survive a long future where the two of them kissed on a regular basis. He wasn’t a hundred percent sure that his heart would be able to take it, but he was very prepared to take the risk. “Chicken Gratin. Molly taught me how to make it. Don’t tell her, but I think my version is better. More garlic.”
Harry would be an entirely different sort of father to himself, of course. He’d be all charmed bubbles in the bathtub and tickle fights. Harry would be pet Pygmy Puffs and one-on-one games of Quidditch in the garden. Harry would be fun, colour, and activity, whereas he’d be serenity and calm. Something sad twisted in Draco’s tummy and, all of a sudden, his cheery mood dropped. In another world – another universe – Harry and he would likely have made a pretty spectacular job of parenting together.
"I suppose," Harry says. The conversation has gotten away from the point Harry was trying to make, which is that it's very weird that Malfoy made him breakfast. And that it's ridiculous that Harry would think Malfoy has a moral compass and a spine, having known him the last seven years. "I just can't believe
"I did, yes. In October." Harry hadn't spent much time wondering what Malfoy got up to during his house arrest but he certainly wouldn't have imagined this alternate universe version of Malfoy who smiles sweetly when asked about his homemade apple butter.
with them.” Draco gave Harry a shrug. He needed to be honest, and he might as well start now. “Don’t worry though. I’m… We’re not going to ask for anything. Not your gold, your time or even your name. You're not beholden to us... I heard you, Harry, back on the night I got pregnant. You said you didn’t want any surprises. That you weren’t ready.” Draco swallowed; his mouth dry. “And you said that sleeping with me had been a mistake. And that’s fine, Harry. I
"We will be having pan-seared red snapper with an orange, grapefruit, and olive relish, and a side of garlic salt and pepper potatoes."
“You have a lot to learn about Grimmauld Place. You can start now. Read about the Black Family history, find the books in the attic. In fact, anything you can find about magical houses will help the renovation job. Draco will still guide you through it. Don’t question him. Trust me, just let him do his thing. You’ll be grateful for it, in the end.
“Father would have wanted a bonding ceremony,” Draco replied. “And insisted on a wand duel at dawn if I was refused.”
He needn't have worried though because Kingsley doesn't even look surprised when Harry tells him and Harry wonders if Ron gave him a heads up. He just thanks Harry for his service, directs him to the secretary who will help him get his paperwork in order, and tells him to keep in touch. The whole thing takes three minutes.
Saturday rolled around in the blink of an eye, and with it came the Quidditch match against Appleby. The game was the last of the season, and it was a bloody close one. Draco listened to it on the wireless, cringing at the commentator’s sycophantic compliments about Louis St Clare and holding his breath whenever the opposition Seeker got close to the Snitch. Puddlemere won after an hour and forty-three minutes, but it’d been more through luck than judgement. Still, a win was a win, and the triumph meant the Pudds managed to avoid relegation.
At night, Harry watches them get into bed and curl into each other again, Draco on Other Harry’s chest first, asking Other Harry questions that he only gets nods for. Once more, Harry gets that weird feeling that this peace they share somehow extends to him, that the safety Other Harry must feel with Draco’s arms around him, his hands gently carding through his hair, can be a little his, too. They twist and turn around each other, never not touching and Harry falls asleep again to the calming sounds of their breathing.
The war inside Harry’s head sees this as a win to the curiosity side. The safety side would have left the room long ago, would have found the spare room, or the sofa in the living room or many of the other places he could sleep in that night. But curiosity wants to see more of this Other Harry and his Draco, so Harry takes the free space on the armchair and settles himself into it comfortably, once Draco is back in bed.
