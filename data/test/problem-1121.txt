“I suppose you’ll be joining us in the library, Granger?” Draco asked as he poured a second cup of coffee.
“I’ll tell you,” Draco said earnestly. “What do you want to do?”
“Yea, I get what you mean,” Ron nodded his head. “I just talked to Harry last night about how fast they seem to be going. I just worry about him. They’ve always been obsessed with each other, but the fighting was normal. This is just kind of weird.”
“Are we going to be hearing wedding bells in the future?”
When Astoria grew ill, Harry frequently took Scorpius and brought over meals. He gave direction to the house elves so that things were looked after without disturbing the mistress. He never said a word, just did what needed to be done. Draco was eternally grateful.
After breakfast, Harry excused himself from Hermione. Not wanting to spend his entire Saturday in the library, he told her he was feeling a bit tired and was going back to his room. It was quiet when he entered the room and he didn’t see Malfoy, so he assumed he was alone. Stepping into the bedroom, he saw that his assumption had been wrong when he found Malfoy reading in bed.
“I still think it’s completely barbaric,” Hermione chimed in as she approached.
He looked around the park, uncertain as to whom he was looking for. The employer didn’t put their name on the response, but maybe they were just very private. Hearing a loud squeal and then a fit of giggles, Draco turned to see someone that looked very like Potter carrying a small boy on his shoulders. ‘That couldn’t be Potter,’ he thought. He was fairly certain that Potter didn’t have any children. But as he drew closer, he realised that it definitely was Potter.
Draco woke to a rapid knocking on his door. “Yes. I’m up,” he called out, trying to remember why he should be awake so early.
“You’re only mad because betas can’t join the hunt,” Ron muttered, rolling his eyes. “Or would you prefer to be one of the hunted?” He grinned at her and she took a step back, her hand going to her wand.
“It’d be strange if you didn’t worry, mate,” Ron chuckled and bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “I’m going to go see if i can find your boyfriend around here anywhere.”
Malfoy gave him an odd look and laughed softly, “You must be kidding.” Seeing the look on Harry’s face, he laughed louder. “Are you serious? I think you’d best go to the hospital wing, Potter. Clearly, you’ve gone round the bend.”
“Do you have a plan?” Ron asked as he looked over at Draco.
“Calm down, Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Haven’t you ever heard of sealing it with a kiss? We just made our contract magically binding.”
“It’s fine,” Draco said, hugging him closer. “This is still really new for us. We don’t have to rush anything.”
“I think we should talk to Madame Pomphrey,” Granger said, her voice stiff with hushed urgency. “He’s been in there for a week and only comes out for classes. He’s not eating unless we make him. This isn’t like Harry at all.” At the mention of Potter’s name, Draco perked up and listened a little more carefully.
“The way I see it,” Ron added, “It’s the only way people are gonna stop asking you.”
“Do you agree to all of my terms and conditions?” Malfoy pushed, leaning a bit further into Harry’s personal space.
It was weird because it was Potter, but he already seemed so forlorn that Draco didn’t want to point that out, “It’s fine,” he said instead. He rested his arm around Potter’s back wondering how he had gotten here. “So,” he started after he had thought about what Potter said for a few minutes, “Are you upset about being dumped or about losing the family you thought you were going to have?”
Draco just grinned, “I told you that you needed a lesson. Now get dressed. We need to have breakfast and I want to owl my mother before we go to the library.”
“Yea,” Teddy agreed. “I would miss me too if I was her.”
Potter allowed him to pull him to his feet. His cheeks were red and his glasses askew. “Yea, I’m fine.”
“Penny for your thoughts,” Harry said from behind him, startling him.
“Sounds good to me,” Harry nodded and took the mugs to the sink.
Draco reached over his shoulder to push the door open and then followed him in. “Do you want a chair or do you want to sit on the bed?” he asked as he rummaged in his trunk for his radio.
“I meant your bed,” he huffed, glaring at Draco. “Your bed is bigger than everyone else’s.”
When they’d all gone to bed for the night, Harry could hear Ron muttering to himself. “Are you alright over there?”
“That would be all well and good, mate, but there’s a problem,” Ron gave Harry a serious look. “It’s only been two days. Two days and he managed to get you under him, quite literally. If I had been ten minutes later, what would I have seen?” He shuddered a bit thinking about it. “And if neither of you agreed on a timeline, how do you know when it’s over? Are you just going to move him into Grimmauld with you after NEWTS? Get married and start a family? Because the way he looks at you… I don’t think he’ll let you go easily.” He rolled onto his back and adjusted his pillow. “Just,” he started again, “Just let me know if you want out and I’ll do what I can. I just don’t want to see you get hurt.”
Several boring hours passed achingly slowly as Draco wondered why Weasley would call Harry his boyfriend. Yes they spent a lot of time together and yes they lived together, but they had separate bedrooms. They didn’t kiss or hold hands, but they did seem to touch each other fairly often. Yes, they were raising children together. But it was so much easier having two parents in the house with four children. Weasley had to be messing with him.
He decided that just asking would be the best choice. “Is there anything in particular that you would like or need?” he asked as soon as they separated from the others. Hermione had gone with Pansy and Ron while Blaise and Greg headed back to Honeydukes.
------------------------------------------------
Harry squirmed and writhed, gripping onto his shoulders and crying out when Malfoy brushed against his prostate. His prick bobbed between them, trailing precum against his stomach. Malfoy gripped his hips and angled them up brushing his prostate again, grinning as Harry’s cum arched between them.
They spent the rest of the train ride talking about Christmas and their plans for their swords.
“Please tell me that I’m not still asleep,” Harry said when he saw Draco watching him. “This just seems too good to be true.”
Harry just shrugged, “Who knows why she does anything.”
Draco shook his head and leaned close so that his head was brushing Harry’s, “It’s her younger sister. Daphne’s probably mad on her behalf. They’re lovely girls, but I’m not interested.”
Harry hadn’t thought this far ahead because he thought Malfoy would flat out say no. “Erm… What do you want?”
“Is there anything I can do to help?”
Harry wanted to punch him in his smug face, but instead he rolled his eyes and headed to the room he shared with Ron. He held the door for Malfoy, shutting it and locking it behind him. He cast a quick Silencing spell before sitting on his trunk. Motioning to his desk, he said, “Have a seat if you’d like.”
like he was Harry’s plaything.
As soon as the thought breached his mind, he fell on the hard floor.
“No, no” Draco’s hands helped him shift and manoeuvred him so he sat sideways on his man’s lap. One arm kept him upright circling his back, the other started giving him lingering touches oh his chest. Nimble fingers attacked his nipples.
When they all called it a night and got out of the still crowded pub, it was 1 a.m.
“Come up here” he patted his thigh. Harry, eager to comply, raised from the floor, ignoring the ache in his knees and made to straddle his boyfriend.
Harry had just gotten home from work, he was tired, horny and pissed.
He didn’t want perfect, classy Astoria, chosen by his parents, to meet his real family.
It had never occured to him that he could have a thing for blonds.
“You deserve to be happy, you know” her voice was determinate and admitted no reply.
He had never believed to Blaise and Astoria’s first meet story.
he felt powerful.
“Well, than you have to take a pint with us while you wait for the two lovebirds to come back from Orgasmland” Draco said before he could think.
“This is what brats get when they don’t behave” his hand was now massaging the soft skin of his scrotum.
We'll find out together!
“Well” she stopped, looked at her brother who was also grinning like an idiot and continueed the weirdest conversation he had that week (and he was friends with Luna Lovegood).
“Not to tell Remus who really broke Hope’s Grecian vase”
“I’m not getting married, Sirius. I’m just getting laid” he poured two shots for them and handed one to his wild uncle.
Draco stared at him, something dark flickering in his eyes.
“I love you” it was a whisper but he knew they heard him anyway.
I'll post the third one as soon as possible.
“My wife is currently talking with a friend we just met outside the pub” he didn’t even blink at Draco’s comment.
The other man clenched his jaw. Wasn’t he hot.
The man’s pupils looked a little bigger now.
“What? No” Harry cradled his boyfriend’s face in his hands “I don’t give a flying fuck about the press and you know it”.
What with Harry being busy with Luna at their bookshop and what with Draco spending more time in St Mungo than at his own home, they hadn’t seen each other all week.
“Just think about it, please” Kingsley’s eyes were calm and kind as always, but determinate “I’ll be needing the final answer by the end of the week”.
Bloody Pansy.
He didn’t know what to do with that bit of information.
Back to the present, the other woman was still talking but he couldn’t understand a word.
“Let the girl wear what she wants” Draco stepped into the room.
He tried to sound convincing and Harry knew he was doing it for his sake. His heart melted.
“Harry Potter, nice to meet you, Draco. I’ve heard great stories about you” Mr Handsome said, extending a hand in Draco’s direction.
Draco was stressed.
Draco was manhandled into a sitting position, again in the man’s lap, still fully clothed.
Had he already mentioned how crap it was to be the adult?
How clichè of Draco, falling fot the bad boy.
“You know you are the right man for this” Kingsley Shakelbolt was a good man. A resourceful Auror and member of the Order, and a very calm, openminded Minister and a friend even.
Blaise kept telling him how his work deprived him not only of his sleep and mental stability, but also happiness.
he wanted to give. He decided how much control to give up. He decided.
“Unspeakable, remember?” his voice and his face are both showing so much smugness that Harry feels the sudden- yet so familiar- need to flip him off.
Draco wanted to stay like that forever.
He looked down at his body.
His jaw was already starting to ache around the ball gag and his nipples were clenched in a vice, metal grip.
“Count with me, Harry” the woman kept trying to get his attention but all he could think about was the first summer he had spent with his mother’s sister’s family when he was six years old.
“Oh, I actually know Daphne Greengass. She’s a client and Astoria usually comes with her” the man had a very nice voice.
The rush of jealousy he felt was completely irrational.
“Yeah, listen to what my wife says” Blaise nodded to himself.
Stand tall in the middle of the living room? Not very smart.
They knew about his preferencies in bed. Not because they were crazy weirdos or perverts, but it had felt natural for all of them to share bits of their personal lives.
“Nica, and breathe into it, Harry” Hermione was still talking.
James and Sirius had found it hilarious. Harry had had to avoid his uncle and mother to avoid their glares.
“Harry, breathe” the female voice he head was calm, but he could hear a hint of panic. The voice had nothing to do with the yells that came from Petunia nor Vernon had ever hugged him so fiercely as the man he felt behind him was doing now.
- about how easily he’d be able to hurt Draco.
“I hope these things are cleaned” he was sure that something else was laying on the couch.
The witch.
Draco had his left arm raised above his head, his hand counting the slaps.
But just as he was starting to lose himself in a far, distant part of his brain, it ended.
“Yes” Harry said, his eyes were intensely staring at Draco’s lips.
“So” he said back, not knowing how to invite the man over to his flat.
“They have us wrapped around their slender and subtle fingers”.
“I get it. You’re forgiven”.
He walked trough the treshold with a coffee in his right hand and his left one covering his big yawn.
But he also didn’t want to rush anything.
He thought about those hands on his body, the man’s skin tone in contrast with his.
“Scorpius was sorted in Slytherin and so will I”.
“And amazingly hung too”
“We really have to do something about that mouth of yours”. He let him go.
Harry looked around for a brief moment than laughed.
“I’m the one that has you”.
Draco went to call a cab when a sudden thought took charge of his mind.
He had this man wrapped around his finger.
He had many appointments that day, so he had been able to think about something other than Draco Malfoy and his stupidly perfect mouth.
Of course not. It had to be dressed like two annoying, giggling, freckled redheads.
Tall, even though he could have been a little shorter than he was, curly dark hair and tan skin. He was already Draco’s type. Than he talked.
The answer came soon enough but from a completely different voice.
Sit back on the couch? The black leather would be cold under his naked bottom.
Josh, his longest lasting boyfriend had used them on him for the first time during the only scene they had done in a club and he had soon become addicted.
He wanted to get on his knees for the man.
“Granpa will hear about this”.
He couldn’t choose. He didn’t do well at choosing.
I should ask Pansy.
I'm going pretty fast with the "emotional and romantical" part because I don't want to have a 30 chapters story! So consider them already in love.
Especially considering english is not my mothertongue.
They were both twenty-seven and they couldn’t name the thing for what it was. BDSM*.
Harry rested his forehead on his boyfriend’s chest.
He threw his head back, baring his neck and shouted. Or at least that was the intention but the ball gag muffled the sound.
, into non-vanilla sex”
“You guys are hilarious” Harry said, a smile on his face.
If only his family had tried to love him with same ferocity and intensity with which they hated each other…
Once he got rid of the jacket and shirt he took a deep breath.
Horny because he had done all but not thinking about the blowjob Draco had given him the day before after their fifth (sixth counting the first time they had met) night out.
The first bite made Draco stiffen. Harry looked at him carefully.
He couldn’t get this attached to someone after only one real date. He just couldn’t.
When had he become a bloody 15 years old again?
He looked hopeful at the clock he had beside the mirror.
They were both avoiding the main subject.
He didn’t want to choose a lot of things in his life.
I'll post as soon as I stop feeling guilty for my untouched university textbooks.
“Tell us, my dearest former brother in law” Charlie Weasley was a handsome man, talented and clever “when are you going to fuck Daphne’s friend?” but a big pain in the ass.
That’s what they started calling it soon after the war, when everything was still so new and frightening.
But slow didn’t necessarly mean soft and sweet.
He could already feel the pressure on his sensitive nipples.
“Are we going to meet this Draco anytime soon?” Ron asked and Hermione immediately followed “Is this serious? It’s been a while, Harry”.
The look Harry gave him was pure want.
Scratch that. He wanted Harry to ruin him.
“I happen to appreciate your company too”. He hated his voice for sounding so soft and small.
I know I'm terribly late but I just could find a way to continue this story.
And he had to be THE tattoo artist Daphne couldn’t stop talking about. She had been trying to bring him there for a year now.
“But you were a war-“ he was the one being interrupted this time.
“Are you enjoying the book that much?”
“No, you go ahead,” Draco shrugged. “You take less time than me.” Just after Harry went into the bathroom, there was a quick knock at the door. Draco opened it to find his mother looking slightly embarrassed.
“I’m not afraid of you,” Greg said, his deep voice a quiet rumble in the room. “I think it’d be nice to be your date.”
-------------------------------
“Just because you’re a beta, doesn’t mean you’re not a good catch, Granger,” Draco scoffed. “Don’t kill him for going in, but don’t let him off too easily.”
When the horn sounded, several Alphas broke away from the others to head straight into the hunting grounds. Draco made a beeline for Steven Cornfoot. He had heard him talking about going for Harry and he wanted to stop as much competition as he could. He slammed into the dark haired young man at full speed, sending them both to the ground. The spectators gasped as they collided. Draco didn’t give him a chance to recover from being knocked down. He punched him in the face several times before landing a solid blow to the side of his jaw that left him laying still.
“One would think with our new level of intimacy that you would call me by my given name,” Draco scoffed. “And you would have died. Thankfully for you, I know you better than anyone else.”
“Did you two sleep well?” Hermione asked, trying to fill the slightly awkward silence in the room.
Potter placed a hand on his shoulder and squeezed reassuringly, “I know you’ll get sorted out eventually. You’re entirely too stubborn to give up.” He grinned and Draco couldn’t help but to smile back at him.
The evening was relatively quiet and uneventful. They spent time in the common room with Hermione and Pansy, Harry spoke to Ron even though he kept giving them odd looks. After everyone had settled into bed for the night, Harry was unsurprised when Draco slipped into his bed again.
Potter was on his feet by this point, “I didn’t agree to this.”
As the tears started to fall faster, a familiar voice pulled him from the dark. Strong hands gripped his shoulders, lifting him to his feet.
“We haven’t really talked about it,” Harry said, shrugging his shoulders. “Draco thinks the longer we keep it up, the more real it looks. And we agreed to escort each other to other functions, as well. So, I imagine at least through the spring or maybe longer because I’ll need a date to a few ministry fundraisers Kingsley invited me to.”
When they finished breakfast, Draco jotted down a quick letter to his mother letting her know where he was and what he was doing. He almost forgot about the clothing, but remembered and added it onto the bottom of the note. When he mentioned needing an owl, Potter offered to send his elf. Kreacher popped back in a short while later with a note from Draco’s mother.
“Thank you,” she beamed up at him before turning to hug Harry. “You didn’t have to do this.”
After dinner, Draco showed Harry to his father’s office. The room had been cleared by the aurors after his father’s arrest and his mother had painted it white to make it seem less oppressive. “I think this should work as a practice space. What do you think?”
“You can’t just add stuff,” Harry huffed as he got out of his bed. “We’ve already bound our agreement.”
“Oh, I guarantee that they have,” Malfoy laughed. “The Patil twins and that Lavender girl saw us come in here. The entire school probably knows by now.” He grabbed Harry’s hand, lacing their fingers together, “Come along, my darling. I suppose I should make nice with your friends,” he shuttered dramatically as he said this. “It’s still a bit early in the evening to hide anyways.”
“No, I don’t believe so,” he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, gaining a scowl. “Just trust me when I tell you that it’s in all of our best interests to be seen together.”
“So you actually want me to take the job?” Draco was trying not to get his hopes up.
Draco thought of the house elf that watched him as a child. She brought him meals and looked after him when his parents were away. She had been Draco’s only friend for a time, but she had gotten old. He went away to school one year and she was gone when he came home. His father would never tell him what happened to her. “You’re a good person, Potter,” Draco said, and he meant it.
“I’ll ask my mother,” Draco said as he grabbed an armful of dusty clothing. “I’m sure she’ll know where to send it.”
“If you keep doing that, I’ll be back to sleep,” Harry said, pulling away from him. “I’m visiting Hagrid today. Do you want to come?”
“Well, where am I supposed to sleep?” Harry ran a hand through his wet hair. He was cold and tired and didn’t particularly feel like fighting with Malfoy. He just wanted to be warm and dry. “That sofa doesn’t look long enough to lay down on.”
“This is definitely one of the best,” Draco agreed as he stole a quick kiss.
“Pansy or Blaise. Hopefully Pansy,” Ron shrugged. “You?”
They dressed in relative silence, Harry thinking about what had just happened. How had he gone from wanting to run from any alpha to being perfectly content that Malfoy had claimed him? As they started to make their way out, Harry asked Malfoy just that.
“Harry, are you in here?” Ron asked as he came in the door. “Oh, um, yea, erm,” he stammered as he realised what he had walked in on. He turned his back on them and stood in the doorway, “We didn’t see you at dinner and wondered if you were back because the snow is really bad now. Everyone is in the common room if you want to chat.” He quickly left, shutting the door quite hard in his attempt at a speedy escape.
On the rare occasion they could afford something else, it was because Greg had bought it. He had a job as a bouncer at a Muggle club and was paid well for it, or at least compared to Pansy and Draco. He took on the lion’s share of the rent also, never complaining when one of the others was short.
‘So it wasn’t Ron knocking after all,’ Harry thought.
Malfoy sat on a sofa across from them, pulling Harry in against his side as though it was the most natural thing in the world. He draped his arm across Harry’s shoulders and smiled, politely nodding his head at Harry’s friends. “Did you finish the potions essay, Granger?”
“I won’t,” she grinned as she headed in Theo’s direction.
“Can I do it?” Potter asked, gesturing to his trousers.
----------------------------
“Everything?” Harry asked, his cheeks pinking slightly.
“So who’re you going with then,” Ron asked Blaise.
“I didn’t know that I was your friend,” Draco said, his voice soft. He was certain that in that moment, he looked vulnerable, but he couldn’t seem to put his uncaring mask back on.
“Molly, I can’t,” Harry said, feeling flustered. “I’m already seeing someone,” he blurted out before she could argue.
Harry grinned at that and then his cheeks turned pink as he realised he was laying on top of Draco. “I’m so sorry,” he ran a hand over his face and started to get up slowly. “Were you petting me?”
Draco completely understood. After all, he had nightmares too. “Would you want to sleep here? The bed is big enough or you could sleep on the sofa if you’d be more comfortable?”
“Whatever you want,” Draco answered, moving on top of Harry. “All you have to do is say stop and I’ll stop,” he added as he kissed along Harry’s jaw.
“Yes, please,” Harry begged.
Draco spent most of that evening playing chess with Ron while Harry and Greg watched Neville give awkward dance lessons to anyone that wanted one. Harry made sure that the girls ate, hanging around with them for a while before heading to bed. At this point, Draco was no longer sneaking into his bed. He came in with Ron when they were finished with their last chess game and climbed into bed with Harry, kissing his forehead when he woke and playing with his hair until he fell back to sleep.
-----------------------------------------------
“The furniture itself seems to be in good shape,” Draco noticed as he wiped the dust from a bureau. They just need a good cleaning and new bedclothes. Definitely some new wallpaper or paint if you want it to be a bit less formal.”
“I think we’re just enjoying the present,” Draco answered as Harry’s cheeks turned even pinker than they had been from the cold. “We’re mostly looking forward to the Yule Ball. I hear they have the Weird Sisters playing again.”
As far as the old clothing, I’ll send you the addresses for several donation services. I know of several that are always grateful for anything in good condition, even if it is out of style.
He was quiet while Harry called Kreacher and when the elf brought their food, not even speaking through dinner. Harry expected him to go back to his room after eating, but he just climbed back into Harry’s bed leaving room for Harry.
“You seem entirely too enthusiastic about this for someone that thought I was joking,” Harry muttered.
“Let’s head back. It’s getting dark so it’ll be colder soon,” Harry suggested as they stepped outside.
“We are sleeping together,” Harry chuckled and hit him with a pillow. “Get up. Let’s go open presents.”
“Oh,” was all Harry could think to say. It took him little time to get ready for bed and he soon found himself drifting to sleep.
“You are incredibly cheesy,” Harry laughed. “We had best get moving before your mother comes back.”
She made neat stacks of gifts in front of them, Harry looking surprised at the size of his pile. “I suppose you’ll want to open this one first,” she said, handing Harry a slightly lumpy package that he recognized immediately. He opened it quickly, pulling a soft maroon sweater with a big yellow H out of the wrapping. He pulled it over his head and smiled. “I suppose you’ll want to open the gifts from each other next?” she asked.
Luckily, they found a table in the back with enough seating for them all. Pansy insisted on sitting between Ron and Hermione so that she could chat with her new friend. “There’s a new shop at the end of the road that has makeup and hair potions. I wanted to buy some for you, but Ron said that it would be better to wait since I didn’t know what color your dress was.”
Malfoy just smirked at him. “It’s more fun to watch you squirm. And besides, you didn’t seem to be complaining while we were kissing.” He grinned, reminding Harry of pictures he had seen of wolves snarling. “A happy couple should be reasonably affectionate, don’t you think, Harry?” He cupped Harry's face with his hand and ran his thumb along his jaw.
“If I agree to this,” Malfoy said, turning Harry’s desk chair and sitting so that they faced each other, “I want to be able to leak to the papers that we’re dating. I also want to have the exclusive right to escort you to Hogsmeade on weekends. It’s my right as your boyfriend, after all. Also, I want to reserve the right to have you escort me to one function of my choosing for every function I agree to escort you to.”
“I didn’t say you looked nice before our first Yule Ball,” Harry shrugged.
“You wish,” Potter returned, his cheeks heating in frustration. He stared up at Draco for a moment before sighing deeply. “Let’s just get it over with.” He turned and headed towards the dorms, Draco following behind him.
“Fine,” Harry muttered. “I’ll ask, but he’s gonna say no.”
---------------------------------
“Goodnight, Mother.” Draco shut the door and turned to find Harry watching him.
Harry ran a hand through his hair and looked up at Draco. “I have for a long time now. I just didn’t want to ruin this,” he gestured between the two of them. “Whatever this is between us. I love you too much to ruin us,” he muttered.
Draco looked up at the moon. The darkened sky made it look so much brighter. He cracked his knuckles and jogged in place, trying to keep his muscles warm and ready. The excitement in the air was palpable, nervous laughter sounding out occasionally. Everyone was ready, jumping or jogging in place as he was. He couldn’t wait for them to sound the horn.
Everyone arrives for Christmas Eve dinner.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “I’m fine. I don’t know how well a chair would fit in here anyways.” He took the coffee from the table and leaned against the door frame.
After eating entirely too much, Draco helped Potter clean up and put away the leftovers. He followed him upstairs to the main floor where Potter showed him the formal dining room, a bedroom, bathroom, and of course the drawing room where they had already been. He did notice the large family tree tapestry this time though. “Don’t know how I missed that the first time,” Draco muttered as he looked at it, grinning briefly when he saw his mother. His smile faded when he saw the blast marks on the tapestry.
“I know,” Harry said, staring at the ground. He looked at Ginny laying on the ground. “Can we move her first. It’d be weird with her so close.”
Narcissa smiled up at him, “It’s alright to be uncertain. There have been so many dark times and I just want to see you happy.”
He headed downstairs a short while later to find Potter in the kitchen pouring a cup of coffee. “Would like like coffee or tea?” he asked when he saw Draco.
“I might in a moment,” Malfoy said as he looked around the small room. “So what’s so terribly important that you need to sully your reputation by cavorting with me?” He raised an eyebrow when he looked at Harry.
“I don’t particularly care for it,” Potter said as he stepped next to Draco. “Sirius’ mother blasted people off of the family tree for disappointing her. Sirius for running away, your mother’s sister for marrying a Muggleborn. Sirius tried removing it, but it’s stuck.” Harry ran a hand through his hair causing it to stick up further. “Her portrait is in the hall with a permanent sticking charm. It took ages, but we finally figured out a way around it. Hermione used a permanent sticking charm to put another portrait over hers,” he chuckled. “Now she’s stuck behind Phineas Nigellus.”
“No, he just said that you were busy,” Hermione said, looking confused as to what exactly Draco found so amusing.
-----------------------Here is where you should stop reading if you don't want to read about Draco throwing Harry a bone---------------------
-----------------------------
“I was happy to hold you and let you sleep,” Draco spoke softly as he started to play with Harry’s hair again.
“I know,” Draco laughed. “Now get dressed. We’ve been in here so long that I’m sure people think we’re fucking.”
“You don’t even know what we’re talking about,” Harry huffed.
“Thanks, guys. You just gave me my big break,” Wilkes said. “I’m sorry I was a jerk earlier.” He waved and headed back in the direction of Hogsmeade.
“You’ve never had your hair played with?” Draco asked. “Not even by your friends?” When Harry said no, Draco shook his head. “That’s awful. And they call themselves your best friends. All of my friends do it. We lay on each other, play with each other’s hair, rub each other’s shoulders. We actually touch quite a bit…” he trailed off as he thought about it. “It’s alright. I’ll play with your hair anytime you like.”
“Yea, sure,” he nodded as he stretched back onto his pillow. Malfoy moved to stand and Harry grabbed his wrist. “Sorry,” he muttered, covering his face. “I didn’t mean to…”
“I like this, too,” he agreed, carding his fingers through Harry’s hair.
She gave him a disbelieving look, “Well, where is she, dear? I’d love to meet her.”
“You haven’t seen Draco, have you?” he asked when he drew closer. “I thought he might be with you. I went for my run this morning and he wasn’t in his bed. I just came from the showers and he’s still not back.”
They opened their packages to find sweaters. Narcissa’s was a pale blue with a white N, Draco’s and Blaise’s were dark green with black lettering, and Pansy’s a pretty lavender with a pink P. They stared at them for a moment before looking at each other and moving to hug Molly. “No one’s ever made me anything like this before,” Pansy hugged it to her chest. “It’s so soft.”
“The last box is unpacked,” he said, lifting Harry to get another kiss. “It’s good to finally get settled in.”
Harry’s grin spread across his face even further, “I suppose when you put it that way.”
“Nothing wrong with being a book dragon, Granger,” he added as he sat across from Ron making him chuckle.
“Harry and Malfoy are under the mistletoe,” Ron chortled.
“Of course I’m sharing with you,” he muttered, shaking his head. His hair was a bit longer than Harry had ever seen it, curling gently around his ears and neck. “Can we agree to a truce this year? I need to finish my courses and McGonagall will give me the boot if I fight with anyone.”
“But once we’re finished, we’ll have however much time we’ll need.”
Harry smiled as strong arms wrapped around his waist. He turned from the dinner that he was finishing up to face Draco, wrapping his arms around his neck and stealing a soft kiss. “Finished already?” he asked.
“I’m here if you ever do want to talk about it,” Draco said as he closed the gap between them. “No pity from me.” He opened his arms, giving Harry the option to hug him.
---------------------------------------
Harry chuckled, “I thought about it.” He considered stepping away from Malfoy, but he just smelled so damned good. Harry took another deep breath, feeling entirely too content pressed against Malfoy. He wanted to shout at himself to move, but the part of him that wanted to stay was like a stubborn cat and refused to be bothered. “What happens now?”
Draco chuckled, half in relief and half in excitement, “She’ll be thrilled that she has a reason to put together a proper Christmas dinner. I’ll send her an owl to let her know.”
“I’m not particularly accustomed to people buying me anything,” Harry leaned back in his chair, letting his eyes drift across the room.
“Yea, he never stays mad for too long,” Harry agreed. “Do you want the shower first?” he asked as he grabbed his pajamas.
“It’s just,” Harry started. “Well, with the nightmares… Sometimes, it’s easier to have a familiar face nearby when I wake up.”
All of Harry’s good sense left him. Before Malfoy could move completely away, Harry grabbed him and pulled him back down to his lips, kissing him fiercely. Malfoy growled as he returned the kiss, his hands sliding up under the jumper to caress Harry’s skin.
“Because I’m your boyfriend and you are deeply in like with me,” Malfoy grinned, once again reminding Harry of a wolf.
A nervous laugh escaped Draco’s lips, “Are you sure?”
“You’re the last omega out. All the others came out with alphas already,” she said quickly. “Some alphas are still in, but they didn’t want to interfere until you were out.”
He got his trunk from the corner and grabbed the few clothes he had that weren’t already in it. Pulling his wand, he quickly shrunk it and stuffed it in his pocket. He looked around the flat, making sure he didn’t forget anything before he left.
He stood in the middle of the room for several moments before there was a quiet knock at the door. “It’s open.”
“Fair point,” Draco nodded and held the door open to a small secondhand shop that Harry hadn’t noticed. “They have some interesting antiques,” Draco mentioned at Harry’s questioning look.
“I kind of can’t wait to see the look on Ron’s face when I tell him we slept together,” Harry laughed.
“Now that that’s settled, go shower and change,” Malfoy ordered, easily returning to his usual self. “You’re dripping water everywhere.”
After saying their goodbyes and doing a quick clean up, Draco and Harry said goodnight to Narcissa and headed to bed. “It seems as though Weasley isn’t as cross with you,” Draco said as he pulled his jumper over his head.
“I used a charm on it,” Draco shrugged as he tried to find an acceptable station to play. “Sit,” he said over his shoulder, grinning as he found the station he wanted. Soft music soon filled the room helping Draco to relax, but apparently putting Potter more on edge. Draco quickly retrieved his stash of scotch, taking a swig before offering it to Potter.
“How long do you two plan to keep this going?” Ron asked, looking concerned.
“What if nothing makes me feel better?”
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes, “So why continue this after the ball? Spending time together before makes sense, but why after?”
“He’s always an ass,” Parkinson said, sitting between Ron and Hermione. “We’re all just used to ignoring it. Once you get beyond that, he’s actually pretty ok.”
Draco let Harry sit in the corner of the sofa and layed down, stretching out with his head in Harry’s lap. “Weasley didn’t tell you?” he chuckled after getting comfortable.
“I’m sorry for that.” Malfoy rolled back onto his side and opened his arms for Harry again. When Harry curled up against him, he had to smooth his unruly hair down to keep it out of his nose, but he didn’t complain. He wrapped his arms around him and held him as he drifted off to sleep. “Goodnight, Harry.”
Potter entered first, leaving space for Draco to come in after Teddy so that he was able to close and lock the door. Draco followed him from what must have once been a grand entryway, down a darkened corridor, and into what had to have been the drawing room. The furniture in the room was old and had clearly seen better days, but it was clean.
Malfoy looked down at him, taking in his wet hair and clothes. His eyes seemed to soften just a bit as Harry watched him. “We’re both adults, Potter,” he sighed as though he was extremely put upon. “I think we can share a bed that large without making a big deal of it.”
He found himself hiding from everyone else on Friday night. He had walked to the edge of the Forbidden Forest and slipped just past the tree line. He could still see out, but no one should be able to see him. As he sat at the base of a large tree, he tried to think about anything other than going into Hogsmeade tomorrow. He really needed to learn to pay more attention to the words he used. According to Hermione, even bets amongst the magical community were considered to be unbreakable contracts so he could end up being Draco’s boyfriend forever.
“Looks like he needs it,” Hermione grinned at her friend, before looking back towards the tree line.
“Did you know about this?” Harry asked, looking at Ron and Hermione.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, walking over to take his hand. “Everything.”
“Don’t start with me, Potter,” Malfoy sighed. When Harry shoved him again, he grabbed his hands. “I thought you were tired.”
“Yes, I’ve been told,” Malfoy sneered down at him. “Just remember that it’s my ass that you’ll be kissing for the foreseeable future if we both agree to this.”
“Exactly!” Harry exclaimed. “If you go as my date, I won’t be constantly doubting why you want to be around me. I’ll already know.”
Ginny continued to stalk towards him, firing spell after spell. She wasn’t giving him time to counter and his Protego was wearing thin. Draco closed in easily since all of her attention was on Harry. He jumped in front of Harry and cast a Protego just as Harry’s fell. Ginny screamed in frustration, “He’s mine!”
Harry’s breath caught as Draco’s fingers slid up his side. “What happens if I say yes?”
“It’s fine,” Harry muttered, shrugging out of his clothing. He had a brief thought cross his mind, wondering what had happened to the version of him that had wanted to run away, but when Malfoy removed his own clothing all of Harry’s thoughts were on him. He reached out tentative fingers and traced the scars he had given him causing him to shiver. Pulling away, he tried to turn so that Malfoy could claim him.
Potter glared up at him for another moment before taking a deep breath, “Yea. I suppose you’re right.” Draco’s face must have shown his confusion when Potter agreed with him because he grinned up at him. “Hermione always tells me that I should just ask for help when I need it, but she also says that I’m incredibly stubborn,” he shrugged.
Draco eased his prick into Harry’s ass, hissing at the tightness that engulfed him. He waited for a moment, giving Harry time to adjust to his size before slowly easing out and pushing back in. “Fuck, Harry,” he growled. “You’re so tight.” He groaned as Harry moaned and squirmed beneath him. Harry flicked his hips, trying to encourage Draco to go faster, so he did. He fucked Harry in long, fast strokes, enjoying the noises Harry made as he drew close to an orgasm. Draco reached around him, stroking Harry’s prick and growled in his ear, “Cum for me, baby,” smiling as Harry came, cum pulsing over Draco’s fist.
Potter stepped to the hearth and took a handful of floo powder. Picking up Teddy, he turned to Draco, “Feel free to look around a bit. I’ll be right back.” He stepped into the floo, saying an address that Draco didn’t quite hear.
“Thanks,” he said as he took a quick sip. “I think I’d prefer a chair.”
“Psht,” Harry huffed. “Why exactly should I trust you?”
“Potter,” a very familiar, drawling voice echoed behind him. He’d recognize that voice anywhere. Of all the alphas in the school, of course it would be Malfoy to find him. “You know, everyone else is headed to the seventh floor,” he said, stalking slowly towards Harry. “But I knew better. Thankfully I caught the tunnel before it closed. Although, after having the Dark Lord as an unwelcome guest in my home for so long, I can say a few things in Parseltongue.”
Draco took a deep breath, “I’m sure I can handle it.”
Harry hated that he was right. He hated that he was in his bed. And he hated that he looked good in his bed. He turned away before he gave in to the weird impulse he was feeling to climb back into the bed with him. Why would he want to be in bed with Malfoy? Wait… “Did you make it a condition that I have to be attracted to you?”
“I know, Molly,” he returned. “But Hermione is my best friend. I wanted to do this for her.”
“Yea,” Potter shrugged. “I had to learn when I was younger. My aunt insisted,” he added with a bitter tone.
“I’m just teasing,” he rolled his eyes again and shook his head at Draco. “Calm down.”
“He grew up,” Malfoy said simply.
“Your eyes look greener without your glasses,” Draco muttered.
As they went about their shopping and looked at window displays, Harry did his best to ignore the reporter. Inside the shops was easy because he never followed them inside. Harry was able to drop his guard and get the last minute gifts he needed. He had decided to get sweets and new quills for Draco’s friends since they were all getting on well and he didn’t want them to feel left out on Christmas.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Draco ran a hand through his hair. “He never talks about them and from what I’ve heard, they didn’t treat him well.”
“Nothing!” Ron insisted. “There was nothing.” Draco found this to be extremely hilarious and even Harry had a little chuckle before changing the subject.
“You’d best worry about a date to the Yule Ball first,” Harry called back as he shut the door behind him.
Harry ignored the whispers as he entered the Great Hall with Draco’s fingers twined in his. He was surprised to see that Draco’s friends were already sitting with Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table. He sat next to Hermione with Draco slipping into the spot next to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yea,” Potter chuckled. “I was quite surprised when you messaged about an interview, but honestly it makes it easier since I know you already.”
“I feel amazing,” Harry grinned over his shoulder at him. “Amazing and sticky,” he laughed.
“No shit!” she exclaimed, her eyes going wide. “So, I guess you’ll be gone before I’m done at work tonight?”
“Yea, if you want it,” Potter shrugged. “But you’ll probably want to see the place before you agree. It’s going to be a lot of work. Ron thinks I’m crazy.”
“I honestly didn’t think about it,” Harry shrugged. “So why didn’t Neville get sick?”
Draco chuckled, pressing his forehead to Harry’s, “That was about the same as a cold bucket of water.” He kissed Harry briefly before pulling away. “Do you feel like being social or do you want to lock him out?”
“That’s understandable,” Harry agreed. “So, where do you sleep?”
“Not at all,” Potter shrugged. “We can put any clothing in one of the other bedrooms for now. I’d like to donate it, but I wouldn’t know where to take it.”
After it had been sent, he had immediate doubts. No one magical would want a Malfoy in their home. He had been stupid to try. So, imagine his surprise when he actually got a response asking him to meet for an interview.
Draco just rolled his eyes and grinned at Harry. He cupped the back of his neck and pulled him in for a brief kiss, effectively silencing the cackling baboons. “Who’s ready for presents?” Draco asked, grinning at the surprised faces. His mother seemed to be the only one not surprised.
“Not long,” Draco said, stretching under him. “I heard Weasley moving around before he left.”
Harry felt a tingle of magic flow through him, warming him from deep within his chest. It took him longer than it should have to remember that he was kissing Malfoy and he pulled away quickly. “What did you do that for?” Harry stood and tried to shove past him.
“I don’t need to see it. I’ll take the job,” Draco said quickly. He didn’t want to risk Potter giving the job to someone else. “When do you want me to start?”
He leaned forward to lap it up before removing his fingers from Harry’s ass. Harry whined at the loss, not realising that Draco had removed the rest of his clothing. He muttered another spell and rubbed his well lubricated prick against Harry’s ass. “Yes?” he asked through gritted teeth.
“I will,” Draco sneered. “As soon as you’ve learned your lesson about making me wait.”
Draco’s cheeks heated a bit as he sat next to Harry. “It comes from my mother’s side of the family. Apparently, most of the Black’s either had curly or wavy hair. Mother’s hair is wavy when she doesn’t style it differently.” He looked at Harry and smiled softly, “And I’m sorry that your friend is cross with you, but I’m glad you’re here. Do you want some tea or anything before bed?”
“The swords or us?” Harry asked, rolling over to face Draco.
He didn’t know what to do with himself as Potter started pulling things out of the refrigerator and the cupboards, so he leaned on the counter by the sink, hoping to stay out of the way.
Harry let Draco hold him, pressing his face into his chest and breathing in his scent. As he listened to the soothing words he realised that being Draco’s boyfriend forever might not be such a bad thing after all.
“Malfoy?” Ron went in for the attack the second he arrived back at his table with Hermione at his side. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Harry was stirred from sleep early for the first time in Draco’s bed. He frowned, burrowing deeper into Draco’s chest. The ‘vacation’ had to end eventually.
“This is pathetic,” Draco sighed. They had arrived back at the hotel to sleep off the jet-lag and other forms of travel-induced exhaustion that weighed them down. “There are at least ten gay bars within walking distance of this place.”
Sirius chuckled to himself. “Yeah, I was a bit of a confused mess then,” he admitted before giving Remus a kiss that was most certainly not practice for any girl or any other man for that matter. “But hey. I think I turned out fine and I think you turned out fine. Don’t worry about it.”
Draco was surprised that the lycanthrope had actually contacted him in private.
Harry, a naturally fast leaner, let Draco do whatever the hell he wanted with the flat. He waited patiently through Draco’s Feng Shui phase when he was up into the odd hours of the night adjusting chi flow and he allowed Draco to swap out the expensive art on the walls at least once a month. Draco had a strange sort of passion for making the world around him beautiful that Harry could quietly appreciate even if it was in interior design.
“Still,” she muttered. It didn’t satisfy her to think this was just some lonely guy with issues trying to get the best out of some online contact. Lorraine wasn’t sure what would satisfy her, though. “I want to meet him. I want to see him no matter who he is so I can move past this.”
“Would you like to observe a class? Ms. Lane is working with counting today. There are various nuances that new students—since we start school in August—have to get used to. There is often a little separation anxiety among those students who haven’t left their parent’s side before,” she offered before standing and leading them into the next room that had a theme of clouds, balloons, birds, and all things high-in-the-sky on the walls. The pillows were even shaped like clouds.
“Bah. You love me.”
“Not yet.” Though Draco was breaking down himself, he would force himself to last to the last possible second, the last possible moment for Harry. “Just a bit longer…”
“I’m sorry I freaked out, I really am. Grace, like, you have to understand how hard this is for me.”
Wanting things he couldn’t have was something Draco always felt on principle, but this urge was sheer madness.
“But he’s—! But they are—!” Lucius scrambled. “Building a house together!”
“Daddy D,” Harry read aloud in an exploratory whisper. It felt so freeing. Fuck what anyone else thought of this arrangement they’d stumbled into—this was right. There would be no running, for Harry was staying right here.
Out of instinct, Narcissa put a protective hand over Grace’s. “What are you trying to say?” the matriarch demanded.
Sure, Draco was over Harry’s apartment quite frequently and vice versa, but Harry missed him more and more each time they were apart. Draco called him a sap for it, but smiled like he agreed.
Harry frowned. “I said back at the Manor I wasn’t on anything.”
Harry whimpered and bucked his hips up. If he didn’t get enough friction, Harry thought for sure he would lose his mind. “Draco, please…” His hand reached out to stroke Draco’s cock through the lace fabric in order to gain his favor.
“And I always knew he and the redhead would never last. Does this mean she’s single?” Blaise questioned. “Ah, sweet Weaselette. Oh, wait, aren’t Granger and the Weasel getting married soon?”
“This stool looks of suitable height.” Draco pulled one out from the kitchen counter. “Here, sit.” Draco took a quill from his robe pocket, having changed into the white Healer uniform for the effect and for the fact that he kept spare blank patient sheets in the inner chest pocket.
It was a simple wall-painting spell, for Merlin’s sake, and Draco was standing there like he’d seen benediction.
Dammit. Harry wished he wasn’t so predictable. “I think you’ll like it,” he told Lucius carefully.
“That is has to be soft,” Draco started. “And probably white. Anything darker and it would hide all kinds of stains and dust.”
“There’s no point to it!” Draco announced with an exasperated sigh. “What will I gain from watching my classmates bump and grind to songs I’ve already heard a thousand times before on the radio? Someone will spike the punch bowl. Do you really want your son around that debauchery?”
Harry nodded slowly, trying to imagine what that life was like—the life of the kids who’d actually gotten laid at Hogwarts. He remembered being jealous of them, and not really understanding it, but they really had been just children then.
Strapped to the bed was their latest haul. This one was definitely a teenager, and Pansy wondered where she knew him from when she recognized him. Maybe he was a pureblood, but at the moment he was screaming about hyperacidity and the theory of gravity. Apparently, even future scientists experimented with drugs.
“Just Catherine, Rita, and Alex.”
“Scared, Potter?”
He sealed the window shut and tried not to think of how the Aurors had shattered the downstairs window. He reached for his hair, searching for a thick, warped strand and found a big one to pull. “Ow,” Harry murmured to himself and shook his head, forcing both hands onto the parchment and unfolding the letter.
“Do you want to get sick?”
“Of course. I am on my lunch break,” announced Ron as he picked Rose up to sit her down on his knee. She giggled, reaching up to grab at her father’s black uniform with all its tassels and pins of honor. “Pour me some tea?”
“I don’t think you are, Harry. Try harder.”
In the Malfoy family, nobody ran away during arguments. You were trapped there until the bitter end, fighting tooth and nail to get your point across. Harry and Draco did that quite a bit, too, and it had been a shock to see Harry reach a breaking point.
“Not yet,” Pansy shrugged. “But I’m sure she loves herself some Gryffindors. When did you two start dating?”
“Alright,” Harry shrugged. Even if the press did see them it could just be a meeting between friends and not a date so as to not give Lucius a heart attack in France. “I’ll ask Draco about it.” Harry let out some of the tension in his shoulders. He needed one of Draco’s signature massages, stat.
“That time I was high in the hospital and Draco made me stop playing with the kids.”
For the second time that day, Harry’s conversation with a former dark wizard was interrupted. This time, it was by one very, very exhausted Theodore Nott. He looked like he hadn’t slept in years and like Colin was at him side to prop him up rather than to be there for him emotionally. Colin didn’t look well-rested either.
Hermione looked away and started humming, Ron turned red. “I lost when you started dating Ginny,” he said before suddenly finding his pumpkin juice very interesting.
“It only matters that you found me in time,” Harry said, sounding sleepy.
Harry searched his face for any deception. All he saw was that Malfoy looked tired and a bit paler than usual. “Yea, I’d like that as well.” He held his hand out for Malfoy to make the next move.
“Coffee is fine,” Draco said, accepting the cup when it was offered to him. As he was adding cream and sugar, Potter stood and retrieved two plates from the stove. He placed one in front of Draco before sitting and removing the stasis spells. Draco looked at the plate, heaping with eggs, bacon, and toast and grinned. “You’re going to make me fat.”
Harry heard the door shut and assumed that Ron had shut it in Draco’s face, so he did the logical thing and rolled over to tuck his head under his pillow. He was very surprised when the blankets were pulled off of him and his pillow yanked away.
Potter was quiet, but seemed to be considering what he had said. “I just feel really lost at the moment,” his voice soft when he finally spoke. “I thought that I had finally figured out what I wanted in life. I never got to have a proper family.” He snuggled his face against Draco’s chest. “You’re very warm,” he muttered sleepily. “I just want to have a nice family and be around people that actually like me for me. Not because I’m Harry Potter.”
“I could ask my elf to bring us some dinner to one of our rooms.”
“It’s just the way omegas are,” Malfoy shrugged. “Once you have an alpha, you need them and they need you. As the claim solidifies and becomes more stable, you’ll be able to have a little more freedom. That’s why Pansy is stuck up Weasley’s arse all the damned time. She’ll get sick and he’ll get aggressive if they’re too far apart. I’m not sure why it happens, but it does.”
---------------------------
“You have got to stop pacing,” Draco huffed. “You’re starting to make me nervous. Calm down.”
It briefly crossed Harry’s mind not to listen, but he was tired and it was a simple enough request. He wished that he had socks as he crossed the room to sit on the sofa. Fortunately for him, there was a blanket on the back of it. Pulling his feet under him, he wrapped the blanket around his legs.
“Sleep will make you feel better,” Malfoy said.
“That was progressing quickly,” Malfoy said, grinning down at him when he had caught his breath. “Having a great snog in bed definitely has it’s merits, but it also brings a lot of temptation. I don’t want you to feel pressured.”
“This,” he said as he pressed his lips to Harry’s. His kiss was slow and gentle as if he had all the time in the world. Harry responded readily, one hand sliding into Draco’s hair the other gripping his waist to pull him closer. Draco shifted his weight to one arm so that he could slide a hand up Harry’s side, under his shirt. His palm felt cool and smooth against Harry’s heated skin as he caressed him gently.
“This is brilliant,” Draco muttered, mostly to himself. “Is it alright if I look around in here more later?”
Again Draco woke up hot with hair tickling his nose. Instead of trying to get up, he gently combed his fingers through Harry’s hair and thought about the talk he had the previous day with his mother. Did he like Harry as more than a friend? It had never really been a thing that had crossed his mind. He’d never particularly liked anyone as more than a friend, not even Pansy and their relationship had gotten physical a few times. But he didn’t like being around anyone for too long. Usually he needed time to himself to feel normal, but Harry was different. He looked forward to the time they spent together. He was already dreading the return to Hogwart’s because he liked waking up with Harry.
“I have one condition,” Draco said as he traced his thumb along Harry’s jaw. “You have to let me return the favor.”
Unfortunately, they couldn’t be avoided. Especially now that he had fought so hard to regain the dignity of the Malfoy name. He had to save face after all. A charity event here, a Ministry function there, donations left and right to orphans and Hogwart’s and Azkaban. All to make nice and show how reformed he was. It was all a show. He didn’t give a rat’s ass about any of it, but he had to appear as if he did for the sake of his son. Scorpius didn’t deserve to inherit Lucius Malfoy’s mistakes and Draco would do everything he could to see that he didn’t.
“Absolutely,” Harry beamed at her when he saw that she was also wearing her jumper from Mrs. Weasley, pulling Draco to sit on the sofa nearest the tree.
“Oh gods, I had forgotten,” Harry sighed, burying his face in his hands.
“Juice is fine,” Draco said as he got the plates and glasses. He grabbed the juice and set it on the table as well. Potter grabbed the plates and fixed them both with large helpings of everything he had made. “This smells so amazing.”
Potter gave him a humorless laugh and shook his head. “I don’t hate you, Malfoy.” He glanced at Draco before turning his attention back to his godson. “Listen, I need help. I’m trying to renovate my godfather’s house and it’s a lot to attempt on my own. Andromeda is going to let me keep Teddy more often if I can get the house more livable, but it’s huge and there’s only so much me and Kreacher can do. He’s old and I don’t like him doing too much anyways.”
As he opened the door, Harry heard a familiar voice ask, “Is Harry in there?”
“Yes,” Harry agreed, lifting his hips. Draco pulled his clothes free quickly, grinning as his erection sprung free.
“Yes,” he huffed. “I agree.”
Harry took a deep breath and put his leg over Draco’s lap so that he was straddling him. He leaned forward and stopped just short of kissing. “Is this alright?”
“As per usual, I suppose,” Blaise commented. “I have to be off though. I told Ginny I’d walk her down.”
When they’d both agreed, she sat in front of the tree and passed them each two gifts. Harry had gotten Draco a box of the finest chocolates Honeydukes had in stock and a silver pocket watch with the Malfoy crest. When he opened it, his initials were engraved inside. “This is brilliant,” he whispered and quickly kissed Harry on the cheek. “Thank you.”
“Oh that’s wonderful,” Pansy cried out, hugging Hermione. “Promise me, we’ll get ready for the Yule Ball together.”
There's no prompt for this one. I just wanted to keep writing while I'm in the mood.
“No offense, but you’re scary,” Blaise shrugged. “Everyone that might be interested is afraid to ask you. Not to mention that you’ve dated Krum which makes you extra intimidating. I, personally, am not afraid of you at all. But unfortunately I already have a date.”
Harry looked surprised and annoyed, but Draco just laughed. “Who won?”
“Darling,” his mother said as she poked her head around the door. “It’s Christmas! Do get out of bed before you miss it entirely.” Her gaze slid to Harry, who had rolled over while Draco was sitting up. Taking in their state of undress, she blushed, “I’ll give you time to wake up.” She was out the door before Draco could protest.
“You’re not the only one,” Weasley agreed, accepting the drink. “Do you and Harry have any plans since Ginny has the kids this weekend? Mione and me can keep Scorpius if you lot need a proper break. Hugo would love having another boy around for the weekend.”
“Then that’s what we’ll do.” Draco pulled Harry close, tucking him in against his side. “Honestly, I’m happy just spending time with you and I want to enjoy it as much as possible since we won’t have as much time when we’re back at school.”
They settled in and Draco put out the lights. They lay in the dark quietly for a few minutes, Draco waiting for his eyes to adjust to the moonlight filtering through the curtains. He was surprised to hear Harry chuckling again. “What’s giving you the giggles now?”
“Damn, Ronald!” Blaise exclaimed as he entered the common room. “If I had known you’d clean up so well, I would have asked you instead of your sister. Your ass looks amazing.” His eyes swept over Ron, causing him to turn red.
“No, it doesn’t,” Finnegan interjected. “Ye didn’t specify that when ye issued tha dare.”
“Potter,” a harsh voice called. Harry felt someone shaking him. A pale figure loomed above him as a familiar voice kept repeating his name. “Come on, Harry,” they said again. “Wake up!”
“I don’t get why you don’t want a date,” Ron said after the last disappointed girl walked away. “They obviously have guts to just come right up and ask you. Talk to one of them. You might like them.”
As the night progressed, the dares became a bit more extreme. People were making out, several girls including Granger were topless, a few of the guys were completely naked, two Ravenclaw boys had been dared to spend twelve minutes making out in a room and had yet to return. No one seemed to be picking truth anymore. They all seemed to be pushing each other to see how far they would go.
Malfoy ran a thumb under his bottom lip, grinning as he did so. “I think a kiss should suffice.” He leaned in slowly, giving Harry time to pull away. When their lips pressed together, he gripped Harry’s hips and pulled him closer. One hand slid up Harry’s side, trailing under the edge of the jumper. He pulled away and grinned down at Harry. “I don’t think you understand what it does to me to see you wearing my clothes.” He started to lean in for another kiss when someone knocked rapidly on the door. “Who in the bloody hell could that be this early?” he growled as he reluctantly pulled away from Harry.
It ended up taking much longer than expected. Potter was quite good at a lot of things. Cleaning spells were not on that list. Draco shook his head as Potter attempted to dust the furniture and ended up blowing a large dust cloud up into the air. He tried really hard not to laugh, but when Potter turned to look at him, covered in dust with surprise on his face, Draco couldn’t contain it. He laughed so hard that he snorted and choked on dust causing Potter to laugh as well.
Malfoy looked up at him and frowned, “You’re still dripping on the floor.”
Later that evening, Draco’s arms felt like they might fall off. He flopped onto his bed, staring at the bed hangings.
“Wow!” Potter exclaimed, looking at Draco’s progress. “How did you get all of this done so fast?”
“Do I have to pick one?” Harry grinned up at him. “I didn’t know that I would like having my hair played with,” Harry said softly.
Molly seemed flustered for a moment. “I am. I wasn’t aware that the two of you were seeing each other.”
“I want to taste you, Harry. Is that alright?”
“I kind of wish someone had taught me,” Draco mumbled. “Or Pansy. She could definitely use a cooking lesson.”
“Didn’t play out quite how you thought, did it,” Malfoy smirked as Harry tried to steady himself. “Your face gives away all of your thoughts, darling. I knew what you were going to do before you did.” He slid his thumb under Harry’s bottom lip and grinned. “Feel free to keep attempting to surprise me.” He stepped back, giving Harry some much needed space. “So, do you want to make an appearance in the common room together now or wait to surprise everyone when they see us at breakfast together in the morning?”
Harry grinned at him, “Can we kiss for a little longer before we sleep?”
As his breathing returned to normal, Draco looked down to see Potter smiling up at him, a drop of cum shining on his chin. He swiped it with his thumb and pressed it to Potter’s lips, grinning as Potter sucked it from his thumb. “That was bloody brilliant,” he said, pulling Potter to his feet.
Harry reached up, gripping his shirt to steady himself. Somewhere in his brain, he knew that he shouldn’t react to Malfoy like this, but he had no control over it. Every time their lips touched, he gave leave of his senses and was left dizzy and gasping for breath.
“I understand completely. I just feel a bit useless,” she pulled him into a hug. “When you’re used to being the hostess, it’s hard to hand over the reins.” Letting him go, she grinned brightly at him, “So, I have someone I’d like you to meet.” She held her hands up when Harry tried to respond. “Hear me out. She’s a very kind young lady that works at the Ministry.”
Mother’
“Maybe we should check on him?” Hermione suggested.
“I think it would be best if we had somewhere spacious and empty,” Harry said while checking to see that they were still alone. “We could always go into the forest, but I don’t want to rile the centaurs and we can’t be anywhere where we’ll be seen.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said, feeling annoyed. “All of the same things and we can’t see other people. If it looks like one of us is cheating, it’ll ruin it.”
He had his wand out, repelling spells she sent his way as she circled him. What he couldn’t see that Draco could was that she was slowly pushing him into a corner. “I don’t know why you’re fighting me, Harry,” she taunted as she slowly closed in. “We both know it’s me you’re waiting for.”
----------------------
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair, “I suppose we should just get it over with. They’ve probably started making things up anyways.”
------------------------------------------
“I agree. There’s plenty of room,” Harry nodded. “Do you want to start tonight or in the morning?”
“Oh, can I come?” Parkinson asked. “I need to get a few more gifts.”
“Was there any other information about it?” Draco asked.
Draco had gotten and been fired from several jobs. Apparently he was unpleasant and hard to work with. Pansy found this to be absolutely hilarious. He was currently looking for another job and had even considered looking in Diagon alley. They didn’t have to stick to Muggle London, after all. It was just easier because they had all grown tired of the whispers and stares. He could have gone to France with Blaise, but when Blaise had made his intentions clear about their relationship Draco had declined. And unfortunately, the ministry still had all of his accounts frozen so he couldn’t afford to go alone.
“Yea, I don’t think I’d want to eat that,” Draco agreed. “I had always thought cooking would be easy. Or at least I thought that until I saw the terrible crimes Pansy committed against food.” He grinned when Potter laughed. Was he actually enjoying a conversation with Potter? It was very unusual, but quite nice. “So, what will we be starting tomorrow?” Draco asked.
“Yes,” Harry panted. Draco pushed inside of him slowly, his prick larger than his fingers had been. When he breached the tight ring of muscle, Harry clenched around him, cum shooting in an arch onto his chest and stomach.
He came running over and grinned brightly at Potter, “Did you see me, Harry?”
“Not really,” he answered. “I suddenly don’t feel much like going to the great hall. Can we rain check?”
Draco could hear him going up the stairs and shook his head. He needed to get as much done as possible before the messy little git came back. In the time it took Potter to rinse his rags and get a bucket of water, he had cleaned the mattress and the linens, dusted the furniture, and was about to tackle the large wardrobe.
He would offer him the best dinner he could cook and then hope for the guy to be into him as much as he was. He looked at his watch.
Maybe Draco could still use that against him, after all.
“I am going to talk about him when it becomes a serious matter, okay?”
“Sorry” his voice was tired. He felt like sleeping until next year.
Instead, he kept staring at Harry’s face.
He could feel the confusion show on his face.
A realization hit him.
In that specific moment, naked in Harry’s apartment, his mouth wide open but forced to shut up, Draco believed in Fate.
“Ron told Molly, Molly told Bill, Bill told Fleur, Fleur told Lily today at work and Lily blackmailed me to ask you”.
Harry was loosing the fight. He had to do something.
He closed the shower.
“Draco! She needs her scarf, it’s freezing outside” Harry was following them with that ugly thing still in his right hand.
They stared at each other.
He spent far too many time at his Aunt’s house as a child when his parents used to travel.
Two neat but careful strokes hit his balls.
He forced himself to get up.
He felt like there wasn’t enough air in the room.
Stupid Blaise had to be a psycologist. Obviously.
Harry Potter was nervous.
Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω * Ω
He shook his mother voice form his head.
Harry’s face was nothing but gentle.
He definitely needed to shag more often.
. He looked hurt.
In the meantime, Ron had climbed on the other side of Harry and was now using his stomach as a pillow.
“I bought this a few weeks ago, didn’t know they would be of any actual use until now”.
As the waiter kept not noticing his best friend, she, on the other hand, kept staring at his ass whenever the poor guy turned around and stretched to reach the top shelf bottles.
And they had met only the day before.
Where Harry is nervous,
With his middle length blonde hair, if he hadn’t seen the man stark naked he would have thought his hair was dyed, and softer features from sleep he must be beautiful. Even more than usual.
, he almost said out loud. He glared at the man who stopped talking, breathed and glared some more.
“Sorry, guys. Intense night” he hoped his voice didn’t show too much.
They were attached at the hip.
The fact that said neighbours were his childhood bestfriends certainly didn’t help.
He had taken the stubbornness from his mother, as his father always loved to remind both of them.
The man was really, really handsome.
So, wait a moment.
It was calming. He eventually could feel his muscles relax.
“You still up for a little play?” Harry raised his right hand form which a ball gag was hanging.
Draco nodded again and gave Harry his phone so the man could write his address and phone numer.
“I heard you’re getting married” he had always known the man was mental but this was too much. Even for Sirius Black.
Probably due to the fact that the wolf wasn’t howling to the moon but to a big “Moony” written with gothic font.
He had a right feeling about the man.
His hands were still caressing the other man’s hair, his nails scratching his scalp.
Hello again.
Even his mind was threating him like shit this morning.
“Go sit on the couch while I pour us two glassess of wine”.
“Please, let’s focus on something else” Harry was ready to beg for a change of subject.
“Have you already got your order?” Astoria asked, tearing him away from his staring. Harry had very nice hands, with those flowers tattooed on the right one and a big snake on the left, the mouth opened. The drawing was scary, yet beautiful.
The stern older woman had noticed an uneasiness in her heir. That busy-bee working spirit of his was out of character, and she refused to believe he was owning up to household responsibilities without an intense amount of prodding from her. When he wasn’t working at that convenience store in Wizarding London, then he was holed up in his room. She had suspected him of sneaking out, but whoever he was sneaking out to meet—unlike that bratty little girl from Hogwarts—didn’t seem to make him too happy.
What the hell was this, twenty questions? “I have a husband, yeah.”
have a random thirty thousand dollars to give away.”
Without warning Draco pushed in a second finger, making Harry’s toes splay out in surprise. Before Harry could properly adjust Draco pushed in a third and was met with a tight, involuntary clench. “Touchy, touchy. And here I thought you wanted it rough.”
With Kingsley’s plan having succeeded in spite of Draco wanting to give the man what he wanted, there would doubtlessly be some mention of Draco and Harry’s personal life.
Harry picked apart his slice of cake with his fork. He watched the little crumbs scatter before impaling them with the prongs and bringing them up to his mouth. Watching his cake was the only way Harry could keep from making a desperate attempt at conversation.
Ron, having stolen Sirius’ chair, gave Harry a look that roughly translated to ‘fuck you’.
“Harry,” Draco said as he spun around in his chair, gripping his cheek. “I love you so much.”
“For what?” she asked, confused.
Draco, oddly enough, complied.
Draco stared down in awe at the strings of white covering Harry’s stomach around his softening prick, still shoving into that open hole.
“That one?”
“You don’t need to thank me,” said Harry, all smiles. “But I do expect a rough round from you when we get back here.”
“Don’t sound so goddamn smug about it. I’m giving it to you.”
Privately, Draco called it ‘sort of wonderful’, because for the first time it seemed as if in spite of their clashing personalities, Harry and he could actually get along.
think I am,” Draco corrected.
The way Draco said that so matter-of-factly made Harry’s stomach tingle. “Hullo, lad. Good to meet you,” Harry said and stuck out his hand to shake. The old man’s grip was strong for his age and made sense with his profession, tilling and working the earth.
Draco waited until the baby had stolen Harry’s glasses to gently remind everyone that most of them hadn’t eaten in hours.
Draco’s body was a familiar plane, one that Harry never got tired of traveling. He’d cover it in kisses and bites, always keeping his hands on Draco. Alabaster skin, icy-blonde hair, and chiseled muscles. It was something straight out of Harry’s wet dreams.
“Woah, what?”
“Just try.”
Harry’s heart pounded. Was being a ‘funny one’ a good thing? Draco couldn’t be pulling his leg at this point, he couldn’t be—this was a huge level of commitment for a joke, and it was the kind Draco now seemed too mature to pull. There were many statements competing to leave Harry’s mouth but he started out with a simple one. “I’ve always thought that about you. That you were, and are…
“I am just a month older than you,” Draco nodded to Harry. “At least no one can accuse us of having an age complex,” he said under his breath.
“Professor Potter, when are Quidditch tryouts?”
going to tell you soon.” Harry grew weary of this line of questioning. The only people with a worse reaction to this than Ron and Hermione were guaranteed to be Draco’s parents. Harry didn’t want to put his boyfriend, his partner, his Daddy through that kind of pain until he was ready.
Hanging more uselessly than ever the opened bra at least served to frame Harry’s chest visually, making quite the sight for Draco on top of him. “Mmm, such a pretty boy you are,” Draco praised. After a few more pronounced thrusts against Harry’s sternum, Draco pulled his hands back to set Harry’s chest free. He moved back down Harry’s body, not breaking eye contact even once. “Let’s see if… oh, yes,” Draco grinned wickedly as his hands wasted no time finding their way right up Harry’s skirts again. “Still hard.”
The young man who’d led Harry here returned with a stack of personnel files and two cups of tea. This was going to take a long while to get through, and thankfully they had all day.
She lifted the cold bottle to her lip and drank in the butterbeer. When cold, that stuff could be brilliant. Considering Pansy had already done everything she could to get cold—cracked open a window, cast a spell, stripped down to her birthday suit—it was just the measure needed to get her there.
“We can do something else tomorrow, if you like.” Draco reached out and trailed a thumb over Harry’s jaw. “Maybe look at the books we have on the sacred 28. See if we can find out more about your family.”
“Oh,” Neville said, looking awkward. “Sorry about that.”
“If your slick starts, I shouldn’t have to stretch you,” he said as he pressed a bit harder until his finger slipped in. He grinned as liquid seeped out of Harry, dripping into his hand. “Perfect,” he murmured, withdrawing his finger and replacing it with his cock. He pushed slowly into Harry, groaning as his tight heat engulfed him. He moved slowly at first, giving Harry time to adjust to his size. When Harry started meeting his thrusts, he became a little rougher. Adjusting his angle and pressing deeper into him.
“He has nightmares too so we thought it would be better,” Draco said.
When the grandfather clock in the hall chimed midnight, Draco suggested they get ready for bed. They had made more progress than expected and were both visibly tired. Draco was completely dreading the climb up the stairs and decided he liked the idea of single story houses. He let Harry use his bathroom first while a house elf moved his belongings to Draco’s room. Bixby discreetly expanded one of Draco’s dressers and put Harry's things away before popping out of the room.
“Oh, sorry,” Harry muttered. “I didn’t know you were in here.” Not wanting to interrupt, he turned to leave the room.
“You wouldn’t understand,” Potter muttered.
“Of course you can,” Harry shook his head. “You can tell me anything.”
“I was hiding,” Harry shrugged. “I was jumped by so many at the start. When I got away, I used the spells you taught me and hid. Ginny found me,” he shuddered a bit and Draco pulled him closer, rubbing his back to calm him. “Draco found me just in time. He got there right as my shield failed.”
---------------------------------
“Yea, alright fine,” Harry agreed. He shook the hand Ron extended, rolling his eyes. “Who are you going to ask?”
Hermone’s eyes went wide, “I’m glad he made it in time. I don’t know why she went for you. You made it pretty clear that you were done.”
“Lackluster?” Draco supplied.
“He?” Ron looked perplexed. “I meant Parkinson or Bulstrode. Why do you always jump to Malfoy?”
I'm not sure how I feel about this chapter, but if you read it I hope you enjoy it.
“How so, exactly,” Zabini asked.
“I would think that you’d want me closer considering that I’m the one that can make you feel better,” he shrugged as he continued to get closer.
“Yea, and probably less than we think since we’ll be testing for N.E.W.T.S. soon,” Harry mumbled against Draco’s neck.
“Better than I have in ages,” Malfoy answered, grinning at Harry.
“You’re so beautiful, Harry,” Draco groaned as he pushed further. When he was fully inside Harry, he held still for what felt like an eternity to Harry, giving him time to adjust to his size. He finally started moving slowly, flexing his hips to fuck Harry gently. “Does this feel good?” he asked as he watched Harry’s prick grow hard again.
“No,” Blaise protested. “It has to be here in front of everyone.”
Potter grinned up at him as he wrapped his lips around his prick, sucking him in slowly. He teased him for several moments, barely taking him into his mouth before sliding to the base of his shaft, choking slightly when Draco hit the back of his throat. Draco tried to pull away when he choked, but he held onto his hips, keeping him close as he swallowed around his head pulling more groans and cursing from Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes and went back to checking the barrier, more carefully now that he had been attacked.
“Alright, yea. You made your point,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “I have to admit it’s a good idea, but he’d never agree.”
As they ate, they talked about what spells to try next. Should they stick to defensive magic or try offensive spells? “If I had the ability to wield a sword, I think I would like to be well defended first and fast second,” Narcissa added from the head of the table where she had been watching them. “If you can cast defensive spells quickly and accurately while still physically attacking your opponent it will give you the upper hand. Master that first and then work on spells that manipulate the weight of your sword and your movement. Then you’ll be faster and your sword lighter so you won’t tire as easily.” She smiled softly and sipped her tea. “I do have one request. I would like to ward the room you're using so that your magic is contained. We don’t want any misfired spells harming anyone or anything.”
Harry wasn’t looking forward to leaving the common room. The Yule Ball was only a few weeks away and he’d already turned down four invitations. He had made himself very clear in the great hall that he didn’t intend to go with anyone, but that hadn’t stopped the starry eyed girls that had already asked and he doubted that it would stop anyone else that had it in their head.
They had barely made it ten feet out of the Three Broomsticks when a man stepped in their path. “Mr. Potter,” he said gruffly, a quick quotes quill floating behind him with a piece of parchment, “Jonathan Wilkes with the Daily Prophet. I have a few questions. Have you been placed under the Imperious curse by this Death Eater? Why are you spending time with the children of known Death Eaters? Is Mr. Malfoy forcing you to be in his company?”
Malfoy cupped his face and tilted it up gently, “Now I’d like to claim you.” He leaned forward slowly, brushing his lips against Harry’s, giving him time to pull away. When he didn’t, Malfoy deepened the kiss, taking his breath and making his heart beat faster. He pulled away long enough to cast a cushioning charm on the floor and helped Harry to the ground. “I wish there was somewhere better to do this, but I don’t want to risk anyone else trying to take you.”
“Actually, I don’t think so,” Harry admitted. “I’m not really sure what it is that I want to do. I just don’t want to fight anymore.”
Today's prompt was Asleep.
“I think I would like that,” she grinned and glanced at Draco knowingly. “But on one condition. You must call me Narcissa or Cissa, as well.”
Draco sighed and pulled Harry in for a quick, but tight hug, “If she asks, tell her it’s me.”
“I never thought I’d say this,” Harry said as they stepped through the gates, “But you’re entirely too nice.”
“He needs to be seen in a more positive light,” Hermione shrugged. “It would do him some good to have his name in the papers with Harry’s and he’s always been pretty concerned about his family name, so it might work.”
“I’m honestly not sure,” Harry answered. “He was helping me with my schoolwork and our friendship turned into something more.”
They spent the remainder of the evening laughing and listening to each other tell stories about past Christmases. Draco even laughed when his mother told the story about him setting traps for Santa and catching a house elf instead. It was one of the best Christmas Eve’s he had ever had.
“I appreciate the offer, but he’s going with the other kids. Ginny’s taking them camping and asked if he wanted to go.” Draco sighed deeply. “I trust her to keep him safe. I just worry.”
“Calm down, darling,” Draco pulled Harry into a side hug, rubbing his arm. “Things are going exactly as planned.” He kissed Harry’s forehead and heard a camera clicking. “It’s going to be fine.”
Harry lifted the Silencing spell and unlocked the door before letting Malfoy lead him to the common room. Several heads turned and whispers started as they entered the room holding hands. Harry’s eyes met Hermione’s and she grinned, elbowing Ron when he laughed.
Harry laughed in his face, “You’re quite mad, aren’t you.” He was cut off when Malfoy walked away from him. As his scent dissipated, Harry started to grow nauseous again. He started shaking his head again, fighting the urge to follow the alpha.
“The swords,” Draco answered as he faced Harry. “My only concern about us is that I’ll be an ass and mess it up.”
When they took a break for lunch, Draco was surprised at the transformation that had taken place. He hadn’t seen the manor look so cheerful since he was a child. There was a large tree in the entryway that they had decorated with green and gold trimmings and bulbs. Swags of evergreens and holly were bunched and gathered over doorways. It looked warm and welcoming and was almost too much. The dining room had large poinsettias as the centerpiece with smaller ones on the side tables. The table was set beautifully and his mother had charmed the napkins to fold themselves into little trees on the plates.
“Harry,” Hermione asked as she looked up. “What’s happened to your neck?”
“It would be more comfortable than in here,” Harry shrugged, his cheeks heating just a bit.
“It’s your turn, mother,” Draco said when they had finished opening all of the gifts from Narcissa.
“Oh hardy har har,” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re so hilarious.” He was about to say something that Harry was certain would have caused an argument, but Slughorn entered and drew everyone’s attention to him before starting class.
“And, they have no reason to agree to do it,” Hermione added. “But Malfoy does.”
Malfoy held his arm out to Harry as he settled onto his own pillow, “Do you want me to hold you?”
Harry didn’t particularly mind being in Slytherin. He had gotten to know several of them over the summer while helping repair damage to the castle. They seemed to be pretty alright, but he would miss the view from the Gryffindor tower.
Draco groaned and captured his lips, claiming him in a possessive kiss. Harry moaned into his mouth as he nipped and sucked on his bottom lip, his hand trailing up Harry’s chest. He pulled away long enough to pull both of their shirts off, throwing them behind him, before trailing kisses across Harry’s chest.
“Yea,” Harry sighed. “That’s probably weird.” He shook his head.
He opened his eyes as he kicked off his shoes, glancing at Potter. He had a hunger in his eyes as he stared at Draco. His tongue poked out to trail along his bottom lip before he captured it between his teeth.
“You might be right, mate,” Ron agreed.
“Yea,” Harry agreed as he bounded out of bed. “I wasn’t paying attention to the time. I think we missed lunch.”
“You have been, but I don’t mind,” Malfoy shrugged. “How about you come lie down with me and I’ll read to you?”
They went to their rooms to change, agreeing to meet in the common room before dinner. Harry was surprised to find that Draco wasn’t alone when he was finished changing. Neville, of all people, had Draco cornered and had his finger in his face.
“Maybe you’re right,” Pansy agreed. “I’m pretty sure most of the attitude Draco used to have was to impress his father anyways. So I suppose it’s not surprising that he’d change without that awful man looming over his head. I know I have.” She looked up and waved as Greg joined them in the common room.
“I suppose I should lift that spell so someone finds her eventually,” Harry muttered, waving his wand as they continued down the path. “I can walk, you know,” he added as they drew closer to the exit paths.
They found Narcissa in the kitchen. She was talking to a house elf in hushed tones and smiled when she saw them. “Good morning, darling. And a good morning to you, as well, Mr. Potter.”
Harry huffed out a quick laugh and shook his head, “Awake Harry is not responsible for what sleeping Harry does.” They both laughed at that and started getting ready for breakfast.
“Neville,” Seamus shook his head. “We all thought it’d be sooner, but he held out for the long game.” He gave them a little wave, “We have to be off. See you later.”
Ron stared at him like he had grown two heads, gaining another elbow from Hermione. “I did. It took less time than expected even though I added in an extra page on additional uses for erumpent horn,” she grinned, both pleased with herself and amused by Malfoy. “How about you?”
“I’m much better than ok,” Malfoy huffed as Zabini sat next to Harry. Goyle looked at the couches and shrugged, sitting on the rug and leaning back next to Malfoy.
Draco rolled his eyes as he looked around the circle of students. Some were friends and allies while others were former enemies being awkwardly polite thanks to a tentative truce. It was a strange gathering of students, but it was a good way to pass time instead of sulking alone dwelling on the past.
“I knew it,” Ron said as he stared at the two of them. “You could have told me. I thought I was your best mate. How long has this been going on?” He pointed his finger, gesturing dramatically between the two of them.
Now that he had a moment to think, Harry sighed, “I would like to lock him out, but I think we should go be social.” He searched Draco’s face to see if he was mad and felt like he should explain, “It’s just that I’ve never really done anything… like that. Or really anything else. It’s just a bit fast considering.”
“What?”
“Can we go home now?” Harry asked.
“You figured it out, didn’t you?” he rolled his eyes. “We’re all here now. Nice, nice, nice. Friendly, blah, blah, blah.”
As they were about to enter the gates to the school, he called out to them, “I apologize for earlier. Is it alright if I ask you some questions?”
“Draco,” his mother called from the other side of the door, effectively cooling his emotions. “Are you and your friend decent? We have things to discuss.”
“I was just thinking that it’s funny how things work out,” Harry shrugged. “Usually, you and I would be cross with each other and I’d be spending Christmas with Ron, but now it’s reversed.” He cocked his head sideways and grinned again. “Also, I didn’t know that your hair is a bit curly when it’s wet. It suits you.”
“Of course, love,” Draco said, kissing Harry’s forehead. “Anything you want.”
----------------------------------
“I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.”
Malfoy growled low in his throat as his knot began to swell. He leaned forward, licking the tender spot where Harry’s neck met his shoulder before biting it sharply. With the taste of blood on his tongue, he shoved his knot into Harry, groaning as he came.
Harry glanced back at the bed and shrugged. It was a bit larger than he’d realized. At least a queen size. “Yea, I suppose,” he finally agreed.
“And if they say yes?”
“Don’t worry about it Potter,” Draco shrugged. “I’ve gotten quite good at cleaning spells living with Pansy and Greg. If you don’t mind, I’ll take the four poster on the same floor as you. I wouldn’t mind being close to the library.”
“I know, but I like having you this close,” Draco said softly. He hadn’t seen or scented anyone else, for a bit and it was making him nervous. He was on edge until they exited the hunting grounds, only relaxing when Hermione ran up to them. He finally set Harry down, but kept his arm around him, holding him close.
“Well, you’re going to have to get used to it,” Draco replied casually. Seeing the irritation building on Harry’s face, he added, “If it makes you feel better, we can take turns. I’ll get lunch today, you get it next time or buy me some chocolate when we go to Honeydukes.”
Harry tried to pull free. “I am, but I need space.” He struggled harder to get free, pushing forward then pulling back suddenly. All this accomplished was to pull Malfoy on top of him.
“I don’t want to talk about it right now,” Harry muttered. He still wanted to run from Malfoy, but couldn’t bring himself to. “I’m not sorry for running,” he said, staring defiantly up at Malfoy.
“That grin looks a bit suspicious, Potter,” Draco said, his eyebrow arching as he looked around the room half expecting Harry to be up to something.
“I had hoped that it would be,” she agreed, sitting next to Molly. “I was so happy when you accepted the invitation.” She was interrupted when Blaise and Ron started laughing.
Draco hesitated for a moment, before saying, “I would like it very much if this was real.” He kissed Harry’s forehead. “It’s been real for me since the first time I kissed you.”
From the first night that Harry had let ‘master’ slip out of his mouth in bed, it’d been a whirlwind of lust and lunacy. Draco’s eyes had gone wild and wide, with a look that Harry could strangely see resembling a kid on Christmas getting all he asked for.
“Maybe him and Potter will run away to—“
Maybe it was sentimental, but Harry liked to think that he and Draco fit flawlessly when they sucked each other off at the same time. His long torso finally evened out with Draco’s long legs.
At the reference to the pharmacy at which Harry worked, he shuddered slightly. Oh, the long hours behind the counter scanning ointments and all other sorts of personal items for sale. “But still. That’s what I work for there. To pay for things.”
That gave Harry pause. He could feel the pain in Ron’s voice, the tone of utter and complete despair to think of a world where Harry was gone. It made Harry want to be kinder to him but he was just so damn
The grizzled old Healer couldn’t smell the weed on Remus after the cleaning charm he’d cast, but he could sure see it in his eyes. “Have you ingested any illicit substances, sir? If so, I am obligated to—“
Draco eased in deeper, burying himself up to his balls in Harry Potter. “Such a good boy,” he praised, wet hands coming to rest on his hips and grip them tight. Carefully he eased back and then forward again, stuffing Harry full of him and watching how his little hole expanded to take it all in.
From the couch, Grace watched her third soap opera marathon that day. “Television is a valid art form,” she told him as the secret twin on the television attempted a seduction of her boss.
“Shut up. And you shouldn’t be using that word,” Grace muttered. She hated that almost as much as she hated being called a mudblood. Slytherin sure was an ironic house for her to end up in.
He could see Colin’s blonde hair from the other side of the diner at their usual table.
So Draco got low and did just that, licking up and down Harry’s taint. Harry made a squeak of surprise at how warm his tongue was on him. Draco’s left hand held Harry’s hips down while the right one circled his cockhead with his index finger. Just one finger, toying with the tip.
“You don’t have to tell them,” Draco reminded Harry softly but Merlin how he wanted to believe Harry was telling the truth.
Giving him a pinch for referring to him as a house plant, Harry managed to drift into the living-room with Draco.
Theo wasn’t buying it. “You’re a shit liar.”
“We’re worried,” Hermione emphasized.
Just for that, Draco kissed him again.
“He’s not so bad,” Theo shrugged as he buttoned up the front of a shirt that was definitely not his. It was sure a good thing that he could get away with shit like that as a ponce. “Not as bad as he used to be to Harry. If anything, they’re on the same side this time.”
“I’ll… I’ll think about it.”
“If you had lost, my life would look a lot different right now. I’d be forcibly married to some woman I despised, and we’d be under constant pressure to have children to fuel the ‘new world order’. I’d be working at the Ministry or somewhere equally loathsome, watching sad little men find new ways to torture muggles with magic.” Draco realized how morbid that all was and blinked, trying to figure out how he got here in his rambling. “But, hey, it’s not like you ended the war to save me. Being a Dominant, sorry…“ Draco adjusted his suit jacket.
He sighed, tugging on the hem of the shirt. It was a dark blue short sleeve button-down, and Harry had been warring for hours now on whether to tuck it into his black trousers or leave it out. Untucked he might look slovenly, and tucked he might look too formal. And what to do with his hair? It was always a bird’s nest, and sometimes combing it just made things worse somehow.
Blaise could see it, too. “Ginny and I have an agreement.”
Soft as a feather and mad as a hatter, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter smiled.
“It tastes…” Lucius searched for the right word. He didn’t want to insult his own cooking, but for once Lucius Malfoy had really cocked up miserably. “Interesting.”
Harry chuckled. “Someone’s got a soft spot for being pampered.”
Draco, still reeling, was not sure if he was ready for what was going on the floor. This was why it was taking so long, this uncharacteristic indecision he felt towards these rooms. “I just—“ Draco stopped himself and shook his head.
“Who do you think you are?” the guy asked after exchanging a worried look with the blonde on the floor. Draco realized instantly what he was trying to do here in order to ‘defend his girlfriend’s honor’, and had about zero to no time for these heterosexual shenanigans.
“Is it true, have you two reconciled for a better future for generations to come?”
Draco smiled almost sadly. “Just about everyone in this room would disagree with you, but I appreciate your saying so.”
“Oh, we are going to get along splendidly.”
Harry finished his cereal. Why the hell was he stewing over his grade school rival before bed?
“Oh, this here, hm…”
“I know,” Theo said miserably. “I shouldn’t have bought it.”
“For fuck’s sake, Draco. You look utterly fuckable and altogether lovely. Happy?”
Anger, but still silence.
Harry ripping apart gifts was a beautiful and singularly innocent sight. All of those years he’d watched Dudders ravage the brightly-wrapped spoils of youth had instilled not only a jealousy in him, but a reverence for the holiday. Only those ‘worthy’ of gifts got to smile. Draco always made him feel worthy, always made him feel wanted.
“Maybe we could make it two?” Harry asked, slipping an arm around Draco’s waist and noting with some satisfaction how his smile had grown.
“The spine.” Harry didn’t even know what kind of terror that would bring about. A
“Is it a problem?” Harry started to ask, about to tell the camera crew to stop recording for a moment when Draco cut in.
“Everyone,” he grumbled to himself. “Is an imbicile.”
“I honestly can say I haven’t. Aside from some ill-advised games of Spin The Bottle back in school, I have never felt myself leaning in Draco’s direction.”
“Only a little bit away now,” Draco assured Harry after they crossed another street. Dare he look for a clock? No, he chose to keep his eyes on Harry’s instead. Green was his favorite and Harry wore it so well. Thick, black eyelashes blinked behind his glasses, revealing a warm trove of emerald each time.
“We will,” Draco agreed. He got a fragrant bar of mulberry soap to drag over Harry’s wet skin, sudsing him up. “And we’ll make them pay.”
Harry frowned. The distress in Draco’s voice was obvious, and Harry knew it was for good reason.
“My jokes are hilarious,” Draco told him and playfully shoved his shoulder.
“Fine,” he echoed, taking his own pen and contract in hand.
If Harry really wanted it to end he’d snap his fingers and the ropes would disappear, but he had no intention of doing that this early in the game.
If Remus were to tell the truth, it would be that wherever the two went, people were all but throwing their children at them. Their fans would give anything to have their child raised by the great, the powerful, the newspaper-dubbed ‘Drarry’. Instead, Remus gave a half-truth.
“Welcome,” Draco said. “To the great House of Slytherin.” All eyes were on him from Raina to little Monica. “An ancient, noble house where you might forge bonds that last over lifetimes. The house of the cunning, the house of Merlin—you are to inherit its boons. But you will also inherit its flaws, which I do not often speak about outside of this room.”
“It’s been that way for a while,” Greg muttered, though that was ignored as most of his grumblings were.
“He sells pygmy puffs, too. Lots of girls like them,” he offered before George knelt down to wipe his hands off.
“Is that--?” Lucius asked in complete disbelief. He remembered his father’s servants reading Tales of Beedle the Bard to him as a lad and was made a curious child all over again.
Harry took his seat in first class next to Draco, who for some reason liked being near the window on airplanes but not in hotel rooms.
“You two are the absolute worst.” Hermione went back to her wilted salad with a roll of her eyes. The tomatoes looked slightly plastic but at least they were never raised in a slaughterhouse.
“You! You, Daddy, you own me,” Harry replied, his whole heart behind the sentiment. It was so freeing, to be his kept man, to know the rest of his days would be filled with such delicious agony and eventual release if he only kept following orders. “Sixteen,” he announced, eyes screwed shut.
“Hello,” Draco greeted them. “I am Professor Malfoy, and I will be your head of house and Potionsmaster this year. I want you all to give it your best this year, but we can talk more once we’re alone among friends. I was informed the Head Girl and Head Boy positions this year go to seventh years Raina Amin and Ryan Walsh.”
“What?” Colin asked quickly, bolting upwards so the one rose he’d placed in his own hair fell to the grass.
“That
“Are you still hung up on that? Wow, Pansy was right, you really did have a little obsession with me,” Draco teased, falling right back into their old roles.
Dudley and he were cool now by way of some awkward bro-talk that was excruciating in the moment but at least gave closure. Petunia and Vernon were getting quite old, and the curse of being their only true son was falling on Dudley to care for them. That was punishment enough for any misdeeds he may have committed as a child.
They also visited with Ron and Hermione during the week quite a bit to talk, and that seemed to be helping Harry deal with this betrayal of trust. Draco owled his friends that everything was going to be fine, but his suspicious nature prevented him from taking too much solace in them.
.” She’d checked into a clinic to figure out the gender after her flight from Malfoy Manor. It set her in the present rather than the past.
“You took way more than your half.”
Boyfriend now, wasn’t it?
Harry hesitated in answering, which was probably a bad idea.
“Because you’re a sociopath, yeah,” Theo nodded. He was feeling confident, and no matter how many times his father had threatened him with violence or actually used it against him, Theo had never seen him in handcuffs before.
Harry’s jaw dropped. “You? Draco Malfoy? Dancing and drinking with muggle go-go boys?”
Tenderly, Colin cupped Theo’s cheek. “Like, forever?” he asked breathlessly. “Is a Slytherin voluntarily talking about commitment? Because honestly, who are you and what have you done with my boyfriend?”
“Wow, that sounds so important,” she teased as she watched her littlest brother be accepted into a flock of blue robes and smiling faces.
Draco’s smile widened. “Yes, you certainly may.”
“If you say something cheesy like ‘Brooke and Kennedy won’, Harry, I will not hesitate to lock you out of the hotel room for the night,” Draco cut in with a sniffle. His wooziness from back at the café had gotten worse, and he needed to lie down just to keep from getting dizzy.
Almost immediately after Draco finished his sentence Harry heard footsteps. “Shh!” he hushed Draco, hand reaching out to grab his arm out of instinct in order to get him to hush. His hand landed on Draco’s elbow, a much more intimate gesture than he’d originally planned on.
“Eleven,” Harry breathed, the stinging sensation having overtaken his arse and thighs so that each consecutive hit felt even better. “Twelve, oh…” Harry’s bound hands tugged on the silken fabric tying him up, only serving to make it tighter around his wrists. He was completely out of control here, arms demobilized and legs kept open and up so Draco had the most skin to work with.
“To the bras!” Remus shouted, consumed by the insanity of it all.
“By the beard of Salazar Slytherin, are you falling for him? Are you romancing him? Draco, if you don’t tell me everything right now, I am going to lose my mind!” Pansy’s voice was rising in excitement and it was getting a lot harder for Draco now—she was really happy for him. Draco’s resolve was weak with how sappy Harry had him feeling.
Lucius chuckled, shaking his head. “What did you do, break his phone in a fight?”
“How—“ she stuttered. “How, how dare you! You—you foul child! How
Unfortunately, not all of the nudges in the world could bring Lucius to lower his pride. “No.” He crossed his arms over his chest like a spoiled child.
?” he said in a half-snarl half-laugh due to his shock. “Thank Salazar you don’t work in the psychoanalytics wing.”
Grace could care less. “It involved
“Polyjuice Potion is your kink?” Ginny asked, doubting. “Hey, you two,” she said to Draco and Harry once they arrived. “You recognize either of them? They were caught using Polyjuice Potion by the stamp.”
Harry wasn’t sure whether or not to be offended by a statement like that.
“If you would please remove all clothing and don a complimentary Imperial bathrobe, then the jacuzzi and steam room is right through you next door.”
“For returning your phone.”
“I—we’re rescuing you!” Ron replied as if it should have been obvious. “Hermione and I tracked the two-way mirror’s magical signature in your shoebox and it led right here. We know Malfoy’s been holding you, and, and—“ Ron looked to the romantic dining room set-up with some disbelief. “Making you cook?”
“Good.” Hermione gave each of her children a kiss on the forehead before Ron outstretched the bundle of joy out to Draco, a man who had once been his enemy, too.
Draco inspected the box where she checked ‘pureblood’, and there was no way she had ‘supportive parents’ like the form indicated. “She lied.” A laugh bubbled up. “That crazy… That…” Draco was about to use a word he only used on the most special and rare of occasions. If he used it too often, like ‘fuck’ or ‘shit’, it would be too common.
Somewhere in a far-away manse, Lucius Malfoy thought he was doing right for his child. So did Molly Weasley when she cooked veritable banquets when Ron visited, and so did Sirius when he told Olivia to put down the quill, to stop applying for jobs for the hundredth time, and gave her a kind smile when she finally gave in and let him teach her how to work the muggle telly.
There was a copious amount of footage from the ride back to the hotel where Draco ranted and raved about that accursed hat. “He seemed like even then he was trying really, really hard to be someone he wasn’t. I kind of feel bad for him.”
There were probably kids out there who were in favor of wars between countries and groups because their parents were. They’d never get on the battlefield themselves, but they would stick their noses up in the air in history class when their opinion was asked for and say: ‘Sometimes, war is necessary’.
“It’s her favorite Pokémon!” Kennedy replied as if that were obvious. “There was this month that everyone on Facebook changed their profile picture to a Pokémon and that’s Tropius.”
He, perversely enough, wanted to hear Harry’s voice again. If Harry could read minds he would know that Draco was similarly panicking over the thought of being attracted to Harry and needed to find a conversational topic that would kill the good mood.
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. He still wasn’t entirely sure that this wasn’t a wet dream gone terribly awry. “Well then. If you say so.” Draco turned the golden doorknob and opened the door to the grand staircase with the opulent chandelier hanging overhead. He lit the candles with a wave of his wand and the room lit up to reveal refined furniture and art.
The other elf, Waldy, fell in love immediately.
“What?” he asked, shocked that Draco was offended. “Every couple has to have a female influence and a male influence.”
Harry was so blissed out face-down on this plush couch he wasn’t quite aware of his surroundings, only of Draco’s voice.
Draco had been envisioning this entire situation—an imagined fantasy of saving some street rat and starting some Pretty Woman makeover—in a limited way, it seemed. Discretion more important than money, what an odd request. Did this man want to sugar in a trailer park? No doubt this ad had gotten countless replies already because of that caveat the man added to the end. Draco wondered if he should even bother writing in. Money was his edge here, and while he had a deeper vault in Gringotts than any other candidate could dream of, what if the person who put this ad out rejected him anyway? Could there be anything more pathetic?
That was when the worgen seemed to realize he was the victim of Draco’s sneak attack. Whoever was controlling it had begun to defend themselves with healing and shielding spells before striking back to hit Draco.
Draco, unable to keep himself composed for much longer, snuck his arm in between Harry’s and stole the computer mouse to answer the call. “Hey!” Harry responded, trying for a moment to wrestle it back.
Draco took Harry’s left hand in his and slid the ring on, fitting perfectly around him. “You’re really…? You’re really saying yes?” Draco asked in disbelief.
The silence was deafening. The only voice to speak on the way back to the hotel was the GPS, and Draco once again that day forgot he was on television and was supposed to be exchanging witty banter with his cohost to make the show interesting, not because he had a hard-on for him.
Harry warmed up with a laugh. “Somehow, I doubt that. Maybe they’ll give us pictures.”
“It’s romantic, Draco. Paris is romantic. You put rose petals everywhere and shit.”
When Draco decided on a perfect place to begin their dance (even though it was more of a gently swaying hug considering Harry had about zero rhythm), he didn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around Harry’s waist.
That wasn’t enough for Draco.
Some sick part of Harry wondered what the Dursleys would think. That night at dinner they had gushed over Dudley’s achievements on the wrestling team as usual and ignored Harry. How would they know who Harry was talking to online?
“We should go,” Theo realized without moving a muscle.
“Well,” Ron said with a shiver. “Don’t you think the Death Eater that killed him is probably dead, too?”
“Yes, yes, be as loud as you like,” Draco encouraged and twisted the fingers inside of him. “Scream for all I care, because nobody merciful can hear you.”
“Well, that was a disaster,” Ron said once he’d ushered the last of his family out of the building. Blaise had taken Ginny out hand-in-hand, and only George had lingered around to see if he could slip a prank product under the door that would make Nott Sr. smell like a public toilet.
“Oh, I don’t know!”
“They expect everyone to react that way to me. I’ll have to explicitly inform them of your romantic intentions for them to go into full-on protective stance,” Draco told him. His stomach felt light with Harry so close. Draco tilted his head, brushing his lips lightly over Harry’s left cheek.
Luckily, that at least scared Dudley out of sneaking into his room at night.
He feared losing her even more, though, so he would start drafting his reply posthaste.
“Please, let me stamp your hands.” Ginny stepped forward, believing this to be a moment of truth. “Hands out, please.”
Lucius frowned, and Narcissa smiled even wider.
I’m having so much fun and my Google search history is littered with peafowl sex questions! Thanks for your reviews and comments, you lot are lovely.
His elbows rested on Draco’s strong shoulders. He prolonged the moments before the kiss so that he could capture that anticipation in Draco’s eyes.
“No, I’m—“
The woman leaned forward in her chair with a vaguely smug smile. “I wouldn’t worry if I were you two about our acceptance rate. On top of the fact that we like to take diverse children from diverse family situations, we pay special attention to the legacy of parents.”
“Daddy!”
“Malfoy-Potter,” Narcissa corrected softly.
That damned ring had never felt so heavy in Theo’s pocket before. It threatened to burn a hole right through him and attempt an escape.
“Hey,” Pansy responded with a tense smile.
“Well, congratulations. You’ve apologized and you can leave now,” Ron snarked.
The real receptionist was a stout man of fifty with dark skin. He could care less about what some MTV crew really wanted when they were paying him so much to ‘step out’ for fifteen minutes while one of their actors talked to the hosts of some show. “My lips are sealed. You have a good night, now.”
Wizards really couldn’t handle the idea of muggle money.
“Hotel on 34
“Mr. Pierson!” Draco greeted his blue muck-covered patient who looked just as horrified as the intern had been, if not worse. “What seems to be the problem?”
Draco smiled distantly. “It is. I plan to host grand parties to fill it.”
“Deserve it,” Harry finished for him resolutely. “You do.”
“I’m sorry to say it, Harry, but you need to make an investigation of Malfoy’s office if you want the answer to that,” she said glumly. “But from my angle, from my people, thus far I’ve seen no evidence of a leak. We honestly didn’t even know it was you—you paid in owled coin and not from a Gringotts account. Even I missed my own ex-boyfriend describing himself—I look over every entry in our personals section.”
Harry sighed, bouncing Lily up and down in his arms as he thought. “Well,” he started. “It’s not a nice word.”
Confused, Bianca muttered a “Goodnight” and left their apartment so she could apparate home. Bianca had promised the flat she shared with his sister would be empty that night so her sister could get around to losing her virginity to her goody-two-shoes boyfriend.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “It was ‘SPEW’, and it still exists today at Hogwarts, you know.”
“Hey, I didn’t say that,” Harry said and squeezed his shoulder. “It’s not wrong to be nervous about what kind of mark you’re leaving on the world. I think the one you’ve left already is a positive one with all of the people you’ve healed.”
“So,” Ron said with a grin, leaning forward. “It was just old-fashioned shagging, hm?”
Draco’s own arousal hung heavy between his legs, ignored for now so that he could focus entirely on Harry.
“—crazy, I know,” Draco sighed. “I… I’m sorry.”
Of course Harry knew it. He still blamed himself for the way Death Eaters killed people protecting him in both wars. They’d made themselves human shields just like James and Lily had to keep Harry safe.
Draco was surprised at how neat and tidy the kitchen was compared to what he had seen of the house. He had expected cobwebs and dust, but had been welcomed into a warm, clean space that was surprisingly cozy given it’s size.
They spent the remainder of the day eating too many sweets and listening to Narcissa play the piano. “This is so different from any Christmas I’ve ever had,” Harry told Draco as they lay on the rug in front of the hearth, “But it’s also one of the best I've ever had.”
“I used to when I was younger,” Draco shrugged. “Mother said that it was a better use of my time than climbing the trees in the garden.”
“Yea. You and every other Alpha except me and Neville,” Ron rolled his eyes. “You’re gonna have one hell of a fight on your hands.”
‘My darling boy,
“I tried to give you time to get away,” she said as she hugged Harry tightly. “I’m sorry it wasn’t enough,” she added as she pulled away and glanced at Draco.
“Yea,” Harry agreed as he walked slowly to the bed. “I suppose that works.” He climbed into the bed and let Malfoy pull him against his chest. “What are you reading?”
As Blaise scowled at Pansy, Harry tried not to laugh and said, “Listen, I’m not going to hurt him.” He looked over to where Draco was laughing with Ron and Greg. “At this point, I’m worried that he might hurt me,” he added honestly. Hermione reached over and squeezed his knee gently, giving him a soft smile.
They looked up as Draco came back, followed by Ron and Greg. The three of them were attempting to balance very full mugs of butterbeer. A tray full of food levitated behind them. As soon as they unloaded it, it disappeared.
Draco smiled and leaned forward, his tongue running a hot stripe up Harry’s prick. He licked across the slit, lapping up the dribble of precum that had formed. “I told you that you looked good enough to eat,” he said softly as he wrapped his lips around Harry’s shaft and sucked, sliding down until Harry hit the back of his throat.
Pansy had attempted to cook a few times so they could eat something else, but she was completely hopeless. Even Greg wouldn’t eat her cooking. She had somehow managed to burn the potatoes and keep them raw and hard. Draco had sworn when he poked it, it growled at him. So they were stuck eating leftovers from her job and takeout when they could afford it.
He groaned dramatically, laying back on his pillows. “I swear, I think she wants us to be sleeping together.”
“Not a problem,” Draco easily levitated her and moved her to the path out of view of the little clearing. He took a handkerchief out of his pocket and gagged her for good measure. He returned to Harry and found him using a cushioning charm at the base of a tree.
Potter seemed confused as he stared at Draco’s large four poster bed. “Why is it so big?” he muttered.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes, “It wasn’t overly difficult. Do you mind if I empty the wardrobe?”
“You only got yourself a date because Weasley is completely insane,” Blaise teased her. “How do you expect to get someone else a date? Especially someone that everyone’s afraid of?”
“You’ll owe me and them a favor,” Ron said, crossing his arms as he leaned back in the wingback chair.
“I don’t have time, Ron,” Harry shook his head. “I have to finish my Transfiguration homework and I haven’t even started my Potions essay. Find someone else. Since we’re all stuck here together, maybe someone from another house will play.”
“As if I would go with someone as pompous as you anyways,” Hermione glared daggers at him.
“Just remember that I warned you,” Potter chuckled as he started up the stairs. The second floor had four bedrooms, two of which had two twin beds in each. A third bedroom, with a large four poster bed, looked to at least be clean even though there were clothes scattered about. “This is where I sleep,” he pointed out as Draco poked his head in. The fourth bedroom looked much the same, but had tattered cloth hanging from the bed posts and a thick layer of dust on everything.
“I finished as well,” he shrugged. “I suppose I’ll be dragging this one to the library tomorrow to make sure he finishes. I don’t want him waiting until the last minute to turn in a sloppy parchment.”
As the silence fell around them again, Malfoy rolled his eyes and stood abruptly. “This is awkward as hell.” Harry and Hermione looked at him and at each other and started laughing.
He was surprised to see Malfoy on the sofa in the small living area. He looked back to the headmistress and opened his mouth, but she spoke again before he could say anything. “Mr. Malfoy is the only student that ended up in a single room. All of the other young men are already sharing rooms in groups of two and three. There is plenty of space here for the both of you.” She turned with a swish of her robes. “Goodnight,” she called over her shoulder as she left them alone.
“Harder,” Harry whined.
Draco looked at Potter, confused for a brief moment. Potter just nodded across the street causing Draco to look in that direction. He watched as a house appeared between Number 11 and Number 13. When he looked back at Potter, he was grinning at him.
“Does it really matter?” he asked, shrugging. When they reached Harry’s class, he leaned in and gave Harry a quick peck on the cheek. “I’ll see you later,” he said as he turned away.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Potter nodded and sipped his coffee.
Harry worried about keeping the food trays full, but Kreacher and Winky worked together to keep the food and drinks flowing. As he entered the kitchen to check on the elves, Molly finally caught him. “Harry, dear,” she started. “This is all lovely, but I do wish you had let me help.”
“Why not?”
He had finally relented and now he found himself sitting with Pansy across from Potter and his little gang of do-gooders with a very full glass of fire whiskey in hand. Everyone raised their glasses in a little toast before quickly drinking the whiskey. Draco barely repressed a shudder as the liquor burned down his throat. He noticed Potter shuddering dramatically and chuckled to himself.
“Yes… You actually do.” He pressed his lips to Harry’s as he released his hands. Harry knew he should shove him away, but he found himself pulling him closer. As Draco deepened the kiss, making it more aggressive by nipping and biting at his bottom lip, Harry moaned. He whined when Draco pulled away, but was quickly appeased as warm, soft lips pressed against his neck. Reaching the base of his neck, Draco bit lightly and sucked, turning Harry into a quivering mess beneath him. “Do you like that, darling,” he asked as he pulled away and looked down at Harry.
Things hadn’t been easy at first, but it rarely is with two people as strong willed and arrogant as Draco and Harry. Not to mention the fact that their children bore entirely too strong of a resemblance to their fathers. The first few weeks had some bickering and squabbles, but these things happen when children are involved and feelings have been hurt. Draco had worried about Harry for a while, but he seemed to come back to himself relatively quickly after the divorce was finalised. The children also seemed to calm once they got the swing of their new routine in Malfoy Manor.
“It’s fine,” Malfoy said softly. “Do you want me to stay here for a bit?”
Draco leaned forward and fixed his glasses. “Just breathe, Potter. It helps.” He stood slowly and took a step back, loosening his tie as he moved. Taking his own advice, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes trying to focus on the music. As he listened to the soft beat, his body started to move along to the rhythm. Deft fingers released buttons easily until his shirt was joining his tie on the floor. His undershirt was removed just as easily, pulled over his head so that his hair was left slightly ruffled in a messy halo.
“Potter?” Draco raised a questioning eyebrow when Potter looked up at him. “Why does my mother call you Harry and how often are the two of you having tea?”
Draco struggled to contain his excitement. Why had Potter asked him for help instead of his friends? “You figured out a new way to manipulate magic and you came to me instead of Granger and Weasley?”
Draco decided he wanted to talk to Harry more about that comment later, but at the moment he wanted to break the tension in the room. “Why don’t we head into the dining room and get started on dinner?” He motioned to the doorway and smiled in relief when everyone moved in that direction.
-------------------------------------
Draco and Harry spent the remainder of the day practicing different defensive spells while taking turns attacking each other. Draco wasn’t surprised when Harry was able to cast Expelliarmus with his sword, effectively disarming Draco. “I’m beginning to think that’s the only spell you know,” Draco teased. He yelped and ran to grab his sword when Harry smacked him across the butt with his sword. They only stopped when his mother made them take breaks to eat and hydrate, both falling asleep quickly after showering.
Draco couldn’t help but to laugh as well, “Please let me be there when you tell him.” They laughed for a bit longer before finally quieting and dozing off to sleep.
“Absolutely.”
“No, I don’t,” she agreed. “But I know you. So why exactly are we obsessing about Malfoy this time? Because quite frankly, I have better things to do.”
“Look at my painslut,” Draco sighed in awe, pushing in a second finger to stretch Harry open. Harry responded with a grateful groan. “Making the prettiest noises for me as he gets all stiff again. I’m going to fuck that second orgasm right out of you.”
“No,” Mrs. Bowen protested with a little laugh. “Heavens, no. I want this off of his name—off of our family name.”
A rush of air escaped Harry’s lips that was supposed to sound annoyed but really just sounded like another laugh. “Sure,” he said purely so he could say something.
“The head chef’s name is Aerin. He wears a chef’s hat and a monocle, takes his job quite seriously,” Harry informed Draco. “That was Roisin, who you were just talking to. She’s shy, but writes incredible poetry.”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Of course. Harry slept on the floor,” he lied, his tongue feeling sharp in his mouth. “Now for the next case we need a flight to Prescott, Arizona and a hotel. With two beds. Can you, the board, and the network all manage that?”
the magazine.”
“Three. Feet. Tall.”
Round two was even better that night, and round three left bruises Harry would maintain for weeks. If this was what they needed after a day of pipsqueak activities, Draco couldn’t wait for the sex to come after the baby.
“Sure,” said Harry. His fingers were all buttery, but Sirius could care less. He invited Harry to completely trash the house, to pour butter all over the floors and punch out the windows if it made him feel any better. Sirius would clean it up with his family’s money.
It seemed like that could be a positive—a hotel with not too many guests meant less noise and less bother—but it really just reminded Draco of some horror movie. Less people around to hear him scream.
There was another one, wasn’t there? One who liked dragons? It was hard keeping track of all the redhead spawn around Hogwarts.
“Fine, I’m sorry that I was an asshole. I’m going to bed now.” Draco tunneled under the sheets, wrapping himself and stuffing a pillow over his head just in case Potter decided to speak any more ridiculous words or request childish apologies.
A slow, steady smile pulled Draco’s lips upwards. “Excellent,” Draco said and this time it had a deeper, lower timber. He looked again to the man attending them. “I’d like to see your collection of silk button-downs in lighter cool colors, and the middle jacket in the window. For the trousers we’ll need black, darker than the ones he has on and these should actually fit him.”
Draco corrected her immediately. “This is not a personal favor! Not even a little bit!”
Lucius’ head whipped around to look at his wife. “They were nothing, Narcissa,” he swore vehemently, embarrassed she’d said this in front of Potter.
Harry ended the Skype call with a smile on his face. “Wow. The first case.”
“No, he does not hate you,” Draco confirmed with some amusement, thinking back to when Harry thought that about them.
“Yes, that hits the spot,” Draco confirmed. “You’re quite good at that, you know—snogging and such.”
“Ugh, I cannot believe I am attracted to you.”
Their friendship was sort of destined because of how close their fathers had been in school, but many things had changed since then.
“Don’t worry,” Neville cut in as he filled his plate with warm and gooey pop-tarts. “I can get you two the best of everything. Luna and I are even selling to the Ministry for their whole ‘green initiative’ laws. Finally good to have a Minister who gives the environment the time of day.”
“We are,” Olivia decided. She’d never felt this alive before, oddly enough. Manic excitement shot up through her veins and out of her fingertips. So giddy with happiness and tickled by the humor of it, Olivia felt like she could do anything. “So, you should probably measure me.”
“Have you ever thought that nobody wants to hear your version of the truth?” Harry sighed at the self-importance of it all.
“The girl is own our house, Draco. All the handjobs in the world can’t change that. She’s going to be having our kid, our
Draco turned on his heels and narrowed his eyes. “Give me one good reason why I should listen to you after all of this that isn’t some vague sales pitch.”
The fact that Henry never did any investigating on his own of this phenomenon had Draco wondering how Henry hadn’t been Catfished before being as vulnerable and gullible as he was.
“When don’t I?”
“I know I’m not the kind of man that girls desire. They want douchebags that are jacked and tan, and that’s not me,” Chris explained. “So I created a new profile for myself to see what women would think of me if I looked the part. I know Ruth is incredibly beautiful, that she would never look twice at a man like me—“
“It’s me, Harry!” Ron called, knocking again.
“Here,” Harry said and clicked on an email titled ‘The Man I Want to Marry’. “You wanted something less heterosexual? Here are two guys.”
“No,” she argued, though Sirius had definitely played with her hair before in a gay cousin sort of way. “I can have thoughts on my own, and this is one of them. Gerda is a living being, and if I’m suddenly mad for being upset about her servitude then that’s just too bad for you.”
“You’re too brave for your own good. I’ve feared my own safety on one of these cases before, so this would be the first. What if this ‘Vera’ comes after us since we’re helping Wesley?”
“It can’t be more than a stone, Draco. You’re ridiculous,” he told him fondly.
“And that we did,” Draco recalled fondly.
Draco forged his own path, though, and had not chosen a husband abysmally. Lucius had a different sort of love for Harry somewhere in the deep recesses of his heart. Harry took care of Draco, and was fiercely loyal. Draco would never have to worry about infidelity or his spouse losing interest in him, which was a great comfort to Draco’s father.
The bathroom had a full-length mirror as well as one above the sink, but one could never have too many in Draco’s not-so-humble opinion. The guest bathroom was about half the size of Draco’s but still triple the size of any normal bathroom, as were all the future planned guest rooms. It also had a giant bathtub with jets, as well as a bench to recline on and towel storage above it. Draco stocked the linens, bath mats, and even a toothbrush in an ornate white holder for someone’s future use.
