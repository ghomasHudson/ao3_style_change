Draco’s cheeks tinged pink.
“I didn’t mean Auror specifically, I just meant,” Draco gestured with his hand. “People integrated with society.  Aurors, journalists. Are you friends with any-” Draco stopped himself. “We don’t need to be friends. Forget I said anything.  Potter and I aren’t friends, end of story.”
“Watching tv,” he called back.
Kreacher nodded again. With a CRACK, he disappeared.
Blaise laughed. “Is that not the Potter-Brooding face we’ve all come to know and love?”
Hermione smiled softly at him. “Of course you didn’t. All heart, no planning, that’s you.”
“Yes, thank you.”
“Alright, let’s get on with it.” said Potter, turning to Draco. “Hand me your wrist.”  Potter slid his wand out from his sleeve and tapped Draco’s wrist. He felt a cool tingling settle into his skin where Potter’s wand touched.  Potter unfurled a roll of parchment and read out the terms of Draco’s voluntary surrender. Years spent in litigation before his case finally went to trial before Wizengamot led Draco here, turning himself in. He tried to ignore the small crowd gathering around them.  Potter took longer to notice, but once he did, he put a stop to it.
Dudley sputtered a moment, and Malfoy slid a pint toward him.
“Shorts.. Shorts..,” Weasley thought for a second before resuming his yelling, “Shortened Life!  Life is Beautiful!”
They glanced at each other as though confirming a suspicion. Harry ran his fingers through his hair. “I guess I lost track of time a bit. I’ve been writing, though. Like you said.”
“I’m not ready to date, Pans.  It was only a few days ago.”
“I don’t want to be alone anymore.”  Malfoy continued. “I want to visit relatives and have family gatherings.  I’m still on the fence about children, mind you. But I know I want to be part of a family.”
“I dunno.  My aunt was always complaining to my uncle that he never took her out anymore.  They rowed about it constantly. I guess I never wanted to have that row. If you never go anywhere extravagant to begin with, they won’t be disappointed if you stop.”
Now, he wasn’t so sure where they stood.
Not even seconds later, Draco heard Harry’s voice, loud and clear in his mind,
“Yes, fuck, yes please just do it.”
Harry brushed him off with a wave of his hand as he settled in at his desk, “Nevermind, it’s a Muggle movie that I saw on TV once. So, which test did we get?”
“Oh for fuck sakes, mate. You’re thinking of the ferret again aren’t you?”
“Anything off the trolley, dears?”
“I know, that is why I got hit with that stinging hex, thanks ever so.” Harry said in the posh voice he used to jokingly mock Draco, leaning in close enough for their noses to touch, smiling.
Harry took a deep breath, pressing the button for the lift, not looking at Draco.
“All the department specific details, you can keep the rest to yourselves. Please.” Ron said in a rush, turning bright red.
Draco hummed in pleasure as he began to move, fucking his mouth onto Harry’s cock, taking him deeper with each movement as Harry’s hands tightened and began to direct Draco, receiving an encouraging moan in response.
He let go of Harry’s hand to fix his collar and open the door before turning back to Harry, smiling widely, “Breakfast, then back to mine, then dinner?”
“But you never brought it up again.” Draco said quietly when the image went away.
“It isn’t hipster or ridiculous, it is art nouveau.”
Draco made a noise of derision and sucked harder, his hands coming up to Harry’s hips, his nails digging in slightly as if to punctuate his disagreement, Harry shoving his fist into his mouth to muffle his moan at the prick of pain as he thrust forward with more force as Draco’s hands moved to his arse and he pushed Harry’s hips forward, making his intention clear without needing to pause from his current position.
Draco moaned at the sensation, but it was dampened too much by their robes and their clothes. Draco whined and sent through the bond,
“Yes. Fuck, you’re filthy and delicious. Want to take you home and let you do whatever you want. Do everything back to you until you can’t move a bloody muscle. How long is this fucking train ride?” Draco said in a rush as he complied with Harry’s request, flinching slightly at the cold window touching his half naked chest as he pushed his hips away from the window, presenting his perfect arse to Harry.
Harry drove his tongue as far in as he could and sucked hard, tightening his hand around Draco’s cock as he reached the other around Draco’s body, dragging his nails down Draco’s chest. Draco cried out and began to come, painting the window in front of him.
Harry grinned, “I know.”
“Did you just wandlessly Vanish our robes?”
Draco’s mouth trailed down in a path to Harry’s neck, then chest as he complained, “These fucking robes are the bane of my existence, I’d like you to know.”
Draco eyed them surreptitiously, Nadia was obviously quite talented at defensive magic, almost evenly matched for Harry before he was active in the field. Now, Harry was more nuanced with his magic, more likely to use something unexpected, although he still didn’t have an ounce of patience. Draco was the one who could wait out his opponent, simply blocking them with a strong shield until they physically tired themselves out or magically exhausted themselves, and then Draco would go in with a barrage of magic, overwhelming his opponent. It made them a good team though, to have different types of fighting.
Draco turned around quickly, to see Harry had started conversing with the American witch, talking it seemed, of all things, about Muggle football.
Draco smiled back, “Alright, well we have to wrap up our files for the Wilkinson case and then Ron said to meet him in the small conference room on level 3 and he will explain how to activate it and what our first round of testing will be like.”
“And if you happen to need to extend it for any reason, you say
Draco’s eyes widened, Harry’s doing the same as Draco sent back,
“Okay, here it is. The charm is designed to send through active thoughts we wish to send to each other, this includes speech and images as well as sounds -”
“Draco, no! It’s just—”
Draco pulled off slowly, lavishing Harry’s cock with his tongue as if savoring it.
“It should link your minds temporarily. This movement here—” Ron pointed at the piece of parchment on the desk. “—is for the duration, the longer you hold that motion, the longer the charm should work. We are going to start off short, let’s say three seconds, which should equal about an hour of charm activation. Alright? Go ahead.”
Draco laughed softly, smacking Harry on the arm for the insult before sobering as he thought of something.
“You alright, mate? If it’s hurting or anything, tell me. We should be able to reverse it early if need be.”
Blaise and Neville arrived shortly after, Draco and Hermione immediately laughing at them.
“Hence the testing.” Harry said, laughing slightly.
“No, not quite.”
“Do you really want to know?” Harry said teasingly as they walked towards the exit.
“Wonderful! Any headaches or anything so far?” They both shook their heads.
Draco was intrigued at how the mental link wasn’t distracting to him, even now as Harry was actively dueling someone. He could still hear some of Harry’s thoughts, moves he was going to make before he actually made them, feelings he was having as one of Nadia’s spells landed, but Draco was still able to watch the other recruits and assist them when necessary, and could almost funnel out Harry’s thoughts if he really wanted to. He made a mental note to mention that to Ron, the developers of the charm should be quite proud of themselves.
“We are clothed, Weasley, you prude.”
“Really?” Harry cackled, “that is so much more hilarious. I hear it’s going well with them though.”
Harry’s desire pulsed through the bond, making Draco close his eyes.
Draco was surprised by her American accent, trying not to jump when Harry sent back,
Draco nodded, “Yes, I heard the same,” his eyes sparkled as he looked over at Harry, “who would have thought a Gryffindor and a Slytherin could make such a fine pair?”
Harry shook his head, smiling against Draco’s already grinning mouth.
Draco breathed into Harry, fucking his tongue into his mouth every so often as they moved against each other, their rhythm falling away as they both were lost in desperation, grinding close.
“Recruits, please end your duels. Good session everyone.” Draco said, taking over as Harry handed Nadia back her wand and walked to stand beside him, so close that their arms were touching. Draco tried to ignore him as he told the recruits they could be done for the day and to enjoy their evenings.
Draco gasped as his back met the cold window, his pupils blown as Harry crowded his body up against him, hands reaching for his flies. Draco nodded, whispering out a soft, “please” as Harry began undressing him.
Harry was sweating despite the evening summer breeze coming in from the slightly open windows as he tried to find an open train compartment, Ron and Hermione chatting softly beside him. He tugged at his dress robes, the high collar feeling too tight on his skin. He swallowed thinking of Draco’s whispered breath there not an hour earlier as the other man whispered sarcastic remarks beside him at the gala for the 10 year anniversary of the Rebuilding of Hogwarts, celebrating the final projects and upgrades being finally finished.
Draco made a questioning noise as he took Harry in hand, pumping him slowly as if trying to commit him to memory, “What’s so funny?”
for that matter. They didn’t have any others?”
“Exactly the problem, Harry. They are so well tailored I can practically see your cock through the trousers. You nearly killed me at the Ministry Christmas Party last year when you wore them for the first time.” Draco whined as he fell to his knees and began opening said trousers as if they offended him.
Harry answered Draco’s thought, once again accidentally sent through the mental link.
Draco put his hand on Harry’s shoulder, stopping them just before the lifts, “This doesn’t prove anything about your skills as an Auror, Harry. It’s not about what you
“Grab Ron’s chocolates and let’s get back to their unavoidable ribbing, you tosser.”
“She’s right. You two have been twirling around each other for over a year. It’s beginning to get ridiculous.”
“Draco, your fucking mouth.” Harry praised, feeling himself get close as he tried to pull Draco off his cock.
“What are you doing?” Draco growled as his back hit one of the padded walls of the training room.
do, it’s about making sure you aren’t causing yourself undue harm.”
“Our friends are going to know what we’ve done regardless though.” Draco tsked.
“Don’t just want a treat for tonight.” Harry said softly, summoning his bravery and keeping his eyes on Draco’s.
They settled in quickly, joking amongst each other about other trips they had taken on this very train, a few of their other friends popping in and out of the compartment, Pansy regaling them momentarily with embarrassing stories of Draco plotting against Harry and Ron jumping in with his own stories of Harry doing the same, much to both their obvious chagrin. Eventually Luna came floating into the compartment and collected her girlfriend, Pansy immediately softening into the press of Luna’s embrace as they slipped away so wrapped up in each other Harry felt a pang in his chest.
Another image popped into his head —
“Careful, Malfoy - it almost sounds like you like us.” Harry said.
Harry tried to control his hips as they thrust forward, eager to be in the wet heat of Draco’s mouth as much as possible, feeling more than hearing Draco’s moans as he carried on, allowing Harry to fuck his throat.
“I wasn’t looking for the trolley, but -”
Harry bit down on his hand as he started to come, Draco’s answering moan driving Harry even higher as he pistoned deeply into Draco’s mouth a few more times. Draco pushed him forward one last time and sucked hard, holding Harry deep in his throat and swallowing around him, pulling out every last vestige of his orgasm as Harry panted, his other hand moving from it’s grip in Draco’s hair into his own as he tried to come back to himself, his legs shaky.
“The link is fading, I can feel it.” Harry said against his collarbone.
“Excellent argument, Mr. Potter.” Draco said, laughing openly, his eyes dancing.
And then they were kissing, somehow softly but furiously, all the tension from the past year, and probably longer, fueling them as they tugged at each other’s clothes, hands and heat everywhere as they finally reached skin.
Harry groaned and breathed out with no heat, “Remember when you put a silencing spell on me and stepped on my face, you pillock?”
“Can I kiss you now?” Harry asked, his mouth so very close to Draco’s but not quite touching him.
As they walked through the halls towards the lifts, Draco noticed Harry’s shoulders going up as he crossed his arms and began chewing on his lip.
“Oh shoot,” Blaise made a show of snapping his fingers as he tugged Neville into the seat beside him with his other hand, “that entirely slipped my mind.”
Harry sent as he dove back into kissing Draco.
“You want a mirror to say that in?”
“Yes.” Harry said aloud, chagrined.
“You don’t have an issue with hearing my thoughts, do you?” Draco asked quietly.
Harry pushed through the charm, his stomach growling softly as if to voice it’s agreement.
Harry looked his fill at Draco’s mused robes, his shirt gaping open and showing off his toned chest, the soft blonde hair leading into his trousers, which were somehow still fastened, his cock straining obviously against the fabric.
“Yeah, Ron - you’re the one that spent over an hour talking to him about Muggle technology this evening. Maybe you’re the one thinking of him.”
“Harry.” Draco said more lucidly, and Harry looked up to see his pupils fully blown, as he continued, not looking away as Harry continued to lick at him, “More. Fuck me. With your tongue, please.”
thought they’d dealt with that after the war.
Ron shrugged, “It should, yes. But that is one of the things you’re testing for, if it disperses early, let me know. Hermione says the Muggle term is ‘guinea pigs’.” Ron grinned at them jokily, scrunching his nose like a rabbit, or Draco guessed, a guinea pig, would.
“Oh my god, you didn’t! On the train?” Draco crowed.
“Fuck me,” Draco groaned, not even bothering to lower his voice. Harry’s laugh echoed in the small conference room.
“Shit, no. Hold on.
Draco’s body relaxed immediately, hands reaching back to Harry’s chest as he leaned his entire body against him from toe to nose. Harry could feel the smile Draco’s mouth made, softly against his own.
Harry's head popped up, and Draco realized that he'd unintentionally sent that thought—biting tone and all—through the mind link. But Draco was in no mood to explain himself to his partner. If Harry wanted to flirt with an American witch who was barely 18, who was Draco to judge?
“More, Harry fuck, I need more. Please.” Draco nearly sobbed.
His eyes strayed to Harry eventually, watching him move, his energy palpable as he darted about his and Nadia’s dueling circle. Draco knew he should be watching the others as well, and not really watching Harry at all, but he never got to see him like this anymore. Since they were partners, they were always duelling together. Even on their annual reviews, they always went into the training modules together and in the field, there really was no time for Draco to stare appreciatively at Harry’s arse as they tried to arrest illegal potioneers or whatever it was this week.
One of Harry’s arms came from around him and then both their robes were gone, Draco groaned, pulling away from Harry’s mouth to look down at them both in their street clothes.
“Neither did you.”
He looked down, smiling to make sure Draco knew he was joking to find the other man already smirking up at him, “Yes, I do. Now this time, you’ll have to keep quiet on your own if you don’t want to get caught, but I still sort of hope you scream, albeit for much better reasons.”
“I am just a bit nervous, is all. I don’t mind it, it will be an interesting test and above all, Draco - I trust you. I just always wish we had a little more warning.”
Harry tapped the inside of Draco’s thighs, wordlessly asking him to spread his legs. Draco quickly complied, and Harry dragged his tongue down to Draco’s bollocks, pressed tight to his body.
Draco sighed and looked up slowly, frustrated with himself at how scared he was to see Harry’s expression. He was met with the same handsome face he looked at everyday, smile lines just beginning to show, his hair still a dark, messy nest of waves, his eyes still greener than any emerald Draco had ever seen (and the Malfoy vaults had plenty), and looking at Draco unguardedly and with something that looked soft and fond. Draco swallowed.
Harry would have continued their silly verbal sparring, but Draco kissed him silent, and they lost long minutes just snogging languidly, completely wrapped up in each other.
In their three years in Auror training, Draco thought surely he and Harry had worked through all their long-standing issues.
Draco moaned, the combination of it all triggering his own orgasm, his mind going blank other than the rush of pleasure as he clutched at Harry, one hand around his waist and the other still in his hair, feeling Harry moan back at the shared sensations, the link acting as a reverb, extending both their orgasms as the held one another tightly, riding it out.
“You’re as bad as Blaise.”
Draco skimmed the next section, adding, “They do have some listed warnings here, since it is new, they don’t know if we will have as strong of control automatically as they are saying we should. That may be something that establishes over time, or the charm could need to be adjusted for more privacy.”
He startled lightly at Hermione’s hand coming down softly on the back of his neck.
“The last car where the Slytherins used to hang out is entirely empty since a bunch of people decided to stay in Hogsmeade.” Neville filled them in.
“What’s wrong?” Draco breathed.
“Me either.”
He could feel Harry’s eyes on him, the mood equivalent of question marks coming through their link. Draco merely sent back rapid fire dueling techniques like Harry had done before.
“I tried, but you mentioned how drunk you’d been and I assumed you’d forgotten or wanted to forget, so I left it.”
And with that, Draco took him into his mouth, not stopping until Harry could feel the head of his cock hitting the back of Draco’s throat.
Draco shook his head, “No, they are already moving into field testing with Pansy and Mel with the armour and this is the only other that is ready to be tested. Ron recommended us for it, actually. He thinks we would be an ‘ideal pair’ according to the memo.”
One of Draco’s hands moved into Harry’s hair as he hummed, seemingly enjoying the overstimulation, as he rocked lightly back and forth into the dual sensations, before slowly coming to a stop, his hand softly tugging Harry away from his arse and he let out a long breath.
to see the positive side here?”
Harry snorted and looked up to find Draco’s face turned sideways just so he could glare at him.
“Oi, come off it the both of you. You’re excellent trainers, and you’ve gotten out of the rotation several times now because of your cases, and I get it—it’s not the same as being in the field. But, new recruits need to learn from different instructors to have a solid base. It helps them learn to be better Aurors. Please, at least
“So, we just go take the recruits through their normal training then? And report back with how the charm works?” Harry asked, seeming quite reserved.
Harry made a noise of mock offense, “well, so do you!”
Harry sent through visuals of Draco, rapid fire through their link, staring at him intensely as he leaned his forearm beside Draco’s head, not boxing him in, but being a close, warm, and steady presence as Draco saw himself, literally, through Harry’s eyes.
Harry jumped, tea spilling over his hand as he looked up blearily at Draco, “Wut?”
Draco and Harry nodded their ascent, and Ron explained how the charm was meant to work.
Draco sent back, not even bothering to hide his tone.
Draco nodded, “Yes, of course. I figured you sods would take forever saying your waxing goodbyes to people you’ll probably see at a pub night in the next month, so I grabbed this while you all dithered.” His voice was so full of affection, even his name calling couldn’t be taken with offense.
Eyes never leaving the other, Harry continued, “And after, I’ll take you and wash you down in the shower, fuck my come out of you as I soap you up just to get you messy again. Get you hard too soon, your body aching for it anyway.”
Their morning sped by as they checked facts and figures, preparing their last case for court.
“Yes, Weasley. I think we’re both just rather stunned and unsure honestly. This is going to last for exactly an hour?”
“Doing errands is hot now?” Harry joked, laughing at Draco’s eye roll.
Harry shook his head, “No, we can do it. I can do it. It’s fine.”
The recruits paired up and immediately started dueling warm-ups, obviously well trained and prepared to go through the modules on their own.
“Did they give you any details about how the charm works?” Harry asked, running a hand roughly through his curls, some of them standing on end, Draco’s fingers itching to smooth them.
“I have a 3 year old daughter, Draco. Twirling is an important part of her gross motor development.” Ron sniffed, obviously quoting something Hermione had told him as she laughed at his side, looking pleased.
“Honey, you did what?” Draco asked at the apparent non sequitur.
Draco rolled his eyes, flicking his wand to clean up the mess the tea had made on Harry’s Auror robes.
Draco laughed. “You can’t even think, can you?”
“So, desk duty?” Draco asked, grinning at Harry’s answering groan.
“I assume you didn’t get up to this much fun on the train when we were students?” Draco hummed, his eyes lighting up at Harry’s cock filling quickly as he pulled his pants along with his trousers to the floor.
“Dueling is something we fared pretty well in, I’d say. Let’s do that.” Draco replied, turning towards the dueling rooms with a flourish, nearly tripping over himself when he felt Harry sent a very appreciative and almost sultry,
Harry nodded, smiling slightly, “Pansy was right pissed when she couldn’t deactivate it, remember?”
“So,” Ron cleared his throat as he paced in front of them, looking somehow mildly nervous for a test he wasn’t even an active participant in, “we aren’t going to have you on any high-level cases for the duration of the test—” he cut off at Harry’s whine, rolling his eyes.
“God, I wish I could do everything to you right now. But for now,” Harry paused, looking up into Draco’s eyes, knowing the picture he must make as he asked, “turn around?” hoping his desire would be clear.
“Alright, alright. You’ve made your point, you dickhead.”
Harry swallowed at the gunmetal grey Draco’s eyes had turned, suddenly feeling like his tongue was two sizes too big for his mouth.
Draco turned in the circle of Harry’s arms, quickly summoning his wand and flicking the mess against the window away before leaning back against it as Harry once more pressed their bodies as close as possible with Draco still brandishing his wand. Draco flicked his wand again and his clothing began to set itself mostly to rights, much to Harry’s disapproval. Draco chuckled softly at Harry’s expression as he flicked his wrist once more and Harry’s clothes began to do the same.
“I don’t want to.” Harry said into the back of Draco’s neck.
Harry groaned, tossing his head back as they moved to the side to let a few giggling recent Hogwarts grads slide past them, all of them obviously inebriated.
“Yes, hold on.” Draco rummaged through his bag to retrieve the parchment he had been given, moving out of the doorway and over to his desk.
Draco nodded and saw Harry doing the same out of the corner of his eye, the other man still holding himself tightly as if he were uncomfortable, but decided to leave it be for now as they headed for the training rooms.
“Do you have room?” Hermione asked, pointing into the compartment Draco was leaning half out of.
“I should take offense to that, I think.”
Much to Draco’s relief, Harry took charge of gathering the recruits immediately, his mind sending through bursts of images to Draco of different types of training and tests they could do as if he was trying to decide. Draco had no idea Harry’s mind moved so fast and was honestly a little overwhelmed by it, so he stood beside Harry, content to let him lead.
Hermione snorted at her husband’s look of outrage, patting him on the arm before taking his hand and squeezing as if in reassurance, before turning a calculating gaze to Harry.
“Fucking hell, Harry. Suck them, please.”
“That’s so fucking hot, you have no idea.”
“Fuck.” Harry sighed, the back of his head smacking softly against the compartment door he was still pinned against as he wound his fingers into Draco’s soft hair.
.” Ron said the incantation slowly, the words obviously foreign on his tongue.
Harry smiled back, leaning as close as he could and still speak, “Good.”
Harry moaned, biting Draco’s lip, sending waves of pleasure through the link as he began to come, speeding up his movements and pushing Draco even harder against him, hands rough on his arse.
“Wait, actually can we get a few chocolate frogs please?” Draco added, smiling beside him and adding, “Remember, Ron?”
Harry laughed softly as he reached up to take Draco’s arse in each hand, grasping him roughly as he opened him up to see his pink hole.
The walked in silence for long moments, Harry worrying that Draco hadn’t understood his actual intention, as he kept turning his head to look into each compartment they passed, until suddenly Harry found himself tugged into an empty compartment, his back hitting the closed door with force as the blinds closed with a swish of Draco’s wand.
“Not that I am not thrilled you both pulled your heads out of your arses, but you realize we have workplace policies against nudity, right?”
Ron shrugged.  He caught Harry’s eye pointedly.  “Andrew’s great.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry scowled.  “I am.”
Harry was silent.
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Yes.” Draco replied tersely. His cheeks tinged with pink and Darco silently cursed their betrayal.
Draco didn’t want to stop.  He never wanted to stop.  He could spend the rest of his life watching those green eyes blown wide with lust.   He could die now and die happily.
Draco didn’t see how being alone could possibly be as bad as Pansy made it out to be.  Getting out of a dead end relationship wasn't letting anything go to waste.  He suspected her misery stemmed from the marital status of her lover more than anything else.
“I was wondering if perhaps I could take you to dinner or get a coffee. Anything.” His voice sounded weak and pathetic. Draco felt unwelcome tears well up in his eyes, unexpectedly. He blinked them back and looked down at his feet. He willed his abhorrent emotions away and met her gaze. “I understand if you don’t, of course.”
“I found it.  In a pile of receipts.  On his desk. Where he balances his books.”
“You’d think he wouldn’t be allowed in Diagon Alley at all.”
Thankfully they were interrupted by a booming voice permeating the air, “WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO FAWLEY STADIUM.  LINEUPS WILL BE ANNOUNCED IN TWENTY MINUTES.”
Kreacher looked up at Harry with the saddest eyes he’d ever seen on the crotchety old elf.
Malfoy nodded. “See you around, Potter.”
Draco took a shaky breath, the only kind of breathing he seemed capable of and nodded.  But when Harry made to slide out of the bed Draco held on tighter.
“You look like shit, mate. Everything alright?” Ron said.
The Weaselette shot Draco a scathing look.  “I’ve got to go, anyway. My portkey’s in five.”
Weasley shouted, “Don’t be a square!”
It was Potter stopping, both of them somehow shirtless, panting.  Their cheeks flushed and lips swollen.  Harry hovered above Draco, briefly hesitant.
“I sneeked down before the contract was drawn and hid behind the curtains under a disillusionment spell.  But when my father sat down with the groom’s family to sign the paperwork it wasn’t some boil covered muggleborn.  It was only Lucious.”  Narcissa smiled.  “I had never been more relieved.  We were married for thirty five years before he passed.’  Her smile slowly faded.  “Thirty five years.”
“Quite. And how is your mother doing? She’s married again recently, hasn’t she?”
“But you’re still an Auror.”
“Did you know?  You’ve never mentioned it.”
“But you do care about Jean?” Potter's voice was muffled and confused.
Harry couldn’t meet Bill’s eyes. He didn’t need more pity. Or concern. Or whatever might show on Bill’s face. He absently tried to tear the last of his roll, but found it gone. He scratched the scruff on his chin.
There it was.  The heart of the matter.  “You’ve come to your senses and decided not to chase married men?” he asked.
Harry nodded. “It’s shit.”
“Ah, shit. I’m sorry, mate.”
“A lot?” Harry offered.
“At least it’s not shit,” Ron said. He pulled the shirt off over his head as he walked to the bedroom.
She was right, as usual.
“If he becomes a problem, you’ll be the first to know.” Potter said.  “I’ll await your daring rescue.” his hands were in her hair and he was nuzzling her again.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Anyway, I always did the washing up by hand.”
Laghari finally lost her composure. “Have some common sense, here Potter! We need you to make us look efficient.”
This was a mistake.
Malfoy shot him a glare and unwrapped his own sandwich.
It was an adorable smirk. Draco hated it.  “I resent your tone, Potter.  Hurry up and pick something.”
Draco bit his lip. This could be his way in. He also reevaluated his conception of mobiles. They weren’t sentient, of course they weren’t. They were communication devices of some sort.
“Or are you going to bed early?” Ron added.
They were quiet a moment, and let the music wash over them. A few feet away Seamus grabbed Dean Thomas by the face and planted a giant kiss on him.  Draco spun them away when the kiss became intimate, chuckling.  Draco Malfoy was laughing at the drunken antics of his very Gryffindor friends. Something warm fluttered in Harry’s chest.  He thought again of the butterfly that had landed on Draco's shoulder at the start of the night.
And use muggle money.
Everyone erupted in cheers.  Harry found himself unable to look away from Draco’s face, his expression unreadable.
“Alright Harry?” Jean asked, looking over.
A pained smile passed over Draco’s face.
The night progressed.  Champagne exchanged hands.  Ties were loosened.  Shoes kicked to the side. H
Harry flicked a finger at the gramophone. The needle returned to the beginning, and he listened to the song again.
Potter looked but Draco found himself alone.
Harry appearated to the steps of Grimmauld Place and stepped inside.
Draco flicked his hand dismissively. “Yes, of course.  Get on with it, would you?”
“What?” Harry glanced up from his plate. “No, this is fine. Great. This is great, thanks Kreacher.”
“And that’s only being married to Theo.” Harry quipped.
Harry laughed again.  “I reckon they were.”
“They must be displeasing for Master Harry to be so angry with them.”
It took a week before he worked up the courage to actually speak to her. Seven straight days of ordering coffee and mediocre pastries and hanging about in a cafe. He could have tried other places, he supposed. But he’d found this one. In that time, he’d learned that the woman he’s spoken with that day was called Oliva. There was also Kabir and Grace who worked the register. The pastries varied in quality day by day. From Olivia, he’d learned that on the better days, it was Agatha in the kitchen. The more dreadful pastries happened when Franc was in the kitchens. He’d also learned muggles loved mobiles. He wasn’t entirely sure what they did, but muggles were never without them.
“What?” Harry spluttered.  “Course not!”
Ron and George spared Harry further admonishment by tramping through the back door. A line of freshly cleaned tree stumps followed them.
The blood drained from Harry’s face and went directly south.
MaybeBridget laughed, “Hot commodity and all.” She winked cheekily at him.
Blaise sat up immediately, all traces of concern gone. “Do tell.”
The woman snorted at his back. “You mean tube?”
Two hours later, Harry’s arse was sore from sitting at a desk for so long. He’d written about fifteen pages worth of note, with a few crap illustrations drawn while idly searching for words. He stretched, his back aching. Christ, how did Hermione do this all day?
“I’m not on duty.”
Draco’s cheeks tinged.  Why on earth was the man apologizing to him? “It doesn’t matter.”
Draco looked down his nose at him, haughtily.  “I’ve had worse.”
“Do all your dates end in that manner?”
“It just seems so..  Expected.” Malfoy offered.  “So.. tidy. You marry your best friend’s sister and everyone lives happily ever after.  That’s not you.”
Harry didn’t know who this person was in front of him.  Gone was the little shit who looked down on the Weasley’s plethora of children.  Now it sounded as though Malfoy wanted to be a part of them. Harry didn’t know quite what to say. A small warm feeling began to grow in his chest.  Like his first taste of butterbeer, or the moment he first took off on a broom.
“Good thing I’ve made a copy then.” She handed him a small roll of parchment.
“What is it?” Draco asked.
“I wasn’t accusing you of anything! Jesus!” Potter shouted back at him.  “I was only making small talk.”
He thought of the way Malfoy introduced him to his friends. Bought him a drink. Made sure he felt safe when he left. “I wasn’t not on a date.”
“Too right I did.” Malfoy preened. “You deserved it. You needed to be taken down a peg.”
Draco heard footsteps and spun to look over his shoulder in case Potter and Weasley came from the other end of the aisle.
“How do you two know each other, then?” Jacina asked.
Died in my place?
“Sing?  You expect me to sing?  Have you mistaken me for some other Draco Malfoy without a sense of propriety?”
Dudley looked at Harry with awe. “You did? Your lot was right about you, weren’t they?” He turned to Malfoy again. “Somethin else, I tell you.”
Weasley said, “Right.” and turned at the same moment Draco said “Look-”
“You’re asleep, aren’t you?”
It didn’t.
“Alright, love?”
Harry nodded again.
Harry nodded and trudged forward to knock on the door. Malfoy melted into the shadows. Hermione answered the door and took one look at him before bringing him into a warm embrace. “Oh, Harry, darling, you look a mess. What are you doing here?”
“What was that?”
“Right there- mmmm.   Oh,” he was a little louder.  He made several breathy noises, his chest rising and falling quickly.
“You grew up muggle, didn’t you? Your muggles had one, I expect.  Didn’t they?  Eh?”
They weren’t.  They hadn't spoken since they split up.  What on earth made him think they were friends?  Draco remained silent.
Draco allowed himself to get positively pissed. He dug through Blaise’s wine collection until he found a lovely, inexpensive bottle of port. The Dow’s vintage 1977 would do nicely. It was delicious with a delicate aftertaste. As though each sip was a drop of ambrosia doing a ballet on his tongue. He could think of no better way to spend a night alone. Well. Almost no better way. He briefly considered venturing out into the night to find someone to spend it with. Maybe someone with dark hair. And bright eyes. But Draco wasn’t quite drunk enough for those thoughts yet.
“Have it your way, then.”
Draco picked up his steps, eager to get the day over with. He knew this routine enough to know he needed to get out before a few curses became several. Flourish & Blotts would have to wait for another day. He tucked the liver and quills into the pocket of his cloak as he turned the corner and ran smack into Dennis Creevy. No longer the little twerp that followed Potter tirelessly taking photographs with his brother. No, this was a fully grown Dennis Creevy. One who evidently bore Draco no good will, judging by the man’s reaction.
“How can you know Casablanca but you don’t know this?”
After the plates were cleared, most of the Weasley clan settled in the den to shout their ideas for the cookbook at Hermione, who ignored them, deeply intent on her notes.
“You absolutely are not.” Draco asserted while Hermione studiously avoided eye contact.
“Harry. Have you re-read anything you wrote?”
Draco started and looked up from his “tea” to see Blaise watching him expectantly. Draco glanced over to see the server busying about behind the counter. “Oh, have you finished fornicating in public?” said Draco. “Or did you need me to give you a moment for the two of you to finish up?”
Harry shrugged.  “He’s taking you on an expensive date.  Trying to impress you and that.”
“Pansy.  He is never going to leave his wife for you.”
“You’re not.  Forget it. How are you, Potter?  Haven’t seen you in the papers for at least a month.  Is that a record for you?”
Draco glared at him. “I said: I. Should. Not. Have. Said. That. Lost your hearing along with your parents, Potter?” he sneered. Draco turned and moved farther down the aisle. He looked up at the blue signage for a bread aisle. Maybe if he pretended this wasn’t happening, it would stop happening.
“Oh, fuck off.  The lot of you.” Harry grumbled and drained his glass of champagne.
Harry felt his hackles rising.  “Is that so.”
“Fine, you?”
“What do you say?”
Draco hung his head and shuffled his feet, but allowed himself to be manoeuvred. “Think less ‘schoolyard bullying’ and more ‘torture by way of attempted genocide.’ I’m not sure a chocolate button quite hits the mark.”
Guilt rose through Harry like bile at the back of his throat.
“Jean is that you?”
“You’re not coming with?” Draco may not have entirely succeeded in keeping the panic out of his voice.
“Shit.”
“It’s fine, Potter.  “We’ve just split up.”
“There you are, drink up.”
Harry stepped into the cafe. He ran a hand through his hair, hoping to make it a bit more acceptable. Harry was, if nothing else, a master of futility. A glance at his reflection in the pastry case confirmed it. An absolute master. The cafe was one of those places where the line often ran out the door during summer. Luckily, in mid-November, it was pleasantly packed and not unworthy of the wait. Harry took his glasses off and wiped them with the bottom of his shirt. Popping them back on, he found they were not only smudged, but still very much wet. He glanced around before tapping the rims to wandlessly spell them dry. Eyes unimpeded, he was able to fully appreciate the pastry case. It was unreal. A thing of beauty, really. More baked goods than Harry had ever seen in one place outside the Hogwarts’ kitchens. Ten-year-old Harry would have killed for just one treacle tart. Twelve-year-old Harry would have easily survived the entire summer with this lot hidden under his floorboards. Twenty-seven-year-old Harry was overwhelmed, to say the least. He was in the right place.
“Ha. Ha.”
Draco pursed his lips.
Draco didn’t laugh.  Neither did Potter. They didn’t hex or curse each other.  Both their noses remained intact and unbroken.  Draco struggled a moment to identify the alien emotion he was feeling.  Sympathy. He was feeling sympathy. Specifically he was feeling sympathy for Potter.
“Fine.” Draco glanced around as well, hoping Pansy would rescue him.  He had no such luck. “I hear he’s fine.”
“What?” Harry looked up confused.
Harry let that sink in and felt his rage start to slip away.  Draco was right.  Harry hadn’t even realized that’s what he was doing.
Harry swallowed.
“And?”
Harry grinned.  He was twisted around in his chair to see Malfoy.  The woman beside him was watching their exchange.
“I have not.” Harr protested. “I mean he was there first year, of course I remembered him.”
“That doesn’t sound like Malfoy.” Ron scoffed.
“You’re funny, Malfoy.”  Harry said. “I guess I never knew that about you.”
“Course. Crowds and that. No worries.”
Harry paused.
“Too right she is!” Olivia said, nodding. “So baking’s more of a hobby for you, then?”
Harry took a drink from his beer and thought it over.  “I say I’ve got work in the morning.”
The server arrived then and delivered the Danish and coffee to Blaise. More batting of the eyes, ogling of the cleavage, and all around undressing with the eyes was to be had. Draco very much regretted asking to meet Blaise in a public place. It had been so long since he’d been out with his mates he’d forgotten how lascivious Blaise could be. It was almost as repulsive as going out with Pansy. He’d gone out with her once, and never again. Draco had no interest in watching her drape herself desperately over any lad looking her way in some sort of misguided attempt to make Draco jealous. At least Blaise was still clothed. Either way, his friends seemed to lack any inhibitions of their libidos. Draco, struggled to even feign an interest in finding a partner. It seemed disingenuous to attempt to meet someone, even if only for a night. Not in the Wizarding World, anyway.
“I’ve just never heard someone so posh use the word muppet before. You’re a right laugh, you are.”
Harry smiled slightly at his retreat and turned toward the staircase. He took the steps two at a time up to his room on the top floor. He made quick work of his Auror robes and changed into his muggle clothes. After he ran back downstairs, Harry apparated from the steps to the alley beside The Drunken Doxy. Rain drizzled down and he cast a quick wandless
Draco held his wand tip to the board and white chalk modern calligraphy poured out forming "Cheery Cherry: a drink to lift your spirits."
Draco did not explain there was just one head of messy hair that he found particularly compelling.  He thought of that quidditch match. Standing an inch away from Potter. He’d been furious with Jean for humiliating him.  And just reckless enough, he’d nearly thrown it all away. With Jean’s recent departure Draco began to regret not snogging the life out of Potter while he had the chance.  What would Potter have done? Hexed him on principle? Or shoved Draco against the wall and...
“With Martha?  It was alright.”  Uneventful, if Harry was honest.  She thought he was a street magician.  An assumption he failed to correct.
Harry watched Malfoy slide out of the booth and weave his way back toward the bar. Harry kept his gaze away from Malfoy’s denim clad arse. Denim and Malfoy were two words that simply do not belong in a sentence together. What would Lucius Malfoy have to say about his son in Muggle attire? Not that he would know, in Azkaban, for life. Harry vaguely remembered seeing in the Prophet that Narcissa retired to France. Mostly likely his parents hadn’t the foggiest.
“Fuck he’s coming over.”
“The oldest one is around five, you see.  And she drew a group of stick figures holding hands.  Two parents, the children in the middle. Well, I say children, they could have been anything really.  She really has the most awful sense of artistry. Then she wrote ‘my family’ at the top beneath the most ridiculous rendering of the sun I’ve ever seen.  As though the sun has a face, let alone a smiling one.”
Harry nodded.
“I dunno.  I don’t think cheating is what ends marriages.  It’s more like a symptom of a bigger problem, mate.”
Draco sent through the link, closing the distance himself.
“Now, Harry - tell me, were you actually looking for the trolley? Or are you interested in a different kind of treat this evening?”
“That could definitely be arranged. But I warn you, Potter - I may not let you go.”
“Alright,” Harry said, relaxing, “that sounds reasonable actually.”
“I would prefer to not be caught with my pants literally down, thank you very much.” Draco laughed, leaning fully into Harry’s touch once their clothes were back on, even though they were still obviously mused.
Harry relished in Draco softly chanting, ‘yes, yes, please, yes.’ above him, and continued sucking on Draco’s skin alternating where to keep him guessing.
“Right!” Harry nodded, accepting the chocolate frogs as Draco handed off some coins and said their thanks.
“I want to do everything to you.” Draco whispered as he curled a hand in Harry’s hair, pulling him softly back up so he would say against his lips, “I want you, Harry. So badly.”
through their link.
Harry groaned, sending back through his own images of them, as they began to move together, still snogging like teenagers.
“Should have known you’d be like this.” Harry smiled, before biting playfully at one of Draco’s arse cheeks.
Draco spun them around, Harry’s back hitting the wall, and nudging his thigh between Harry’s legs as he bit down into the muscle between Harry’s neck and shoulder, the other man moaning as he rutted against Draco.
“Good, it was one.”
“If you’re too nervous, we can tell them we don’t want to do it, Harry.”
Draco whimpered in response, his hands making an aborted movement towards his own trousers, obviously eager to get them off. Harry pushed himself off the door, stalking forward as Draco stepped back further into the compartment.
Draco faced Harry, who did the same as they cast the charm on one another, counterclockwise from one another, in unison. Draco felt a cooling sensation run down his spine as they lowered their wands, and noticed Harry shiver slightly, probably from the same reaction.
“Umm, guys?” Ron’s voice echoed into the training room. Both their heads whipping to the entrance to find him standing in the doorway holding his hand over his eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to Neville, complimenting him on his speech. Harry just stared as they began talking animatedly about the new Technology programs Hogwarts would be starting, Ron jumping in to mention George’s contributions in creating a way for wix to use the Muggle internet as well as cell phones.
“We got one?!” Harry said, grinning at Draco, “I didn’t even know you’d signed us up. You hated the last batch of testing charms.”
Last year, when Draco found himself pressed against their office door, Harry’s lips pressed hard against his own, both of them tasting a bit like the eggnog offered at the Ministry Christmas party, Draco was sure they had recovered from their childhood animosity. Although, neither of them had spoken about the incident since.
Harry whined.
“If you find her, can you get me a chocolate frog? Rosie likes it when I bring her home our cards.” Ron asked, looking equally excited about getting a sweet and impressing his daughter, as Hermione tried to contain a suffering sigh and Blaise hid his laugh into Neville’s shoulder, all of them having caught onto what Ron seemed to be missing.
Draco’s body reacted like he’d been shocked with electricity, as Harry continued to moan into Draco’s center, driving the vibrations through Draco’s body as Harry began to slowly, torturously stroke him.
Harry smiled thinking of Neville’s flushed face as he gave his speech, having been the one leading the project that brought Hogwarts ‘into the modern age’, Draco snarky question about ‘what the hell is WiFi?’ pulling Harry’s smile even wider.
Harry’s arms encircled Draco’s waist, pulling them flush together as Harry began to rock into Draco, their cocks lining up through their robes.
Harry cleared his throat, “Well, I am going to try to find the trolley.” He turned his gaze directly to Draco, trying to make his intention clear, “Anyone interested in tagging along?”
“Do what?”
The knock at the compartment door startled them both, Harry calling out a soft, 'just a moment' as they checked each other over for anything too obvious before turning and sliding open the door.
“Later, just a funny thing from school. You and Hermione are so alike sometimes, it’s scary.”
They both moaned as Harry plunged his tongue into Draco pulling out and sucking on his rim roughly, biting the soft skin lightly before pressing back in and beginning to fuck his tongue into Draco, deeper and deeper.
“Yes, well, there is a reason I never studied to become an Animagus, Harry. I have no interest in shrinking or growing my body. It’s very odd and uncomfortable magic.”
“Can you speak?” Ron asked, worriedly.
“Sure, mate.” Harry nodded, his face coloring once more as he and Draco exited the compartment, Draco immediately leading them towards the back of the train.
“Draco, you gotta stop. I can’t. It’s too much. Merlin, you’re amazing at that.”
“This will not be full-on legilimency,” Draco read off, looking up at Harry as he noticed his shoulders relaxing, “there should still be mentally privacy between the partners. There are also included incantations for extending and instantly ending the link that both parties can use at any time.”
Draco asked through the link.
Draco sniffed and began striding through the room, adding in small suggestions to the other dueling pairs, and sending through nothing but white noise to Harry when he tried speaking to Draco through the link, hearing him make an annoyed sound behind him before he stopped pestering Draco, obviously focusing on his new friend.
When the door swung shut after the last recruit cleared the room, Draco asked, “Do you want to go grab a late lunch, then?” as he tried to create distance between himself and Harry, but Harry followed him as he stepped back.
Draco refrained from rolling his eyes.
Harry laughed. “We weren’t animals though. We just shrunk down to be very small. Like in Honey I shrunk the Kids.”
“Holy fucking shit.”
“Now, I’m going to wreck you as much as I can, as quickly as I can and then we can go to lunch and go back to mine. Good?”
“Come ‘ere.” Harry said softly, one of his hands coming to cup Draco’s jaw softly and Draco complied, standing slowly.
“We cannot have you in the field if something goes wrong, Harry. What if you can’t make heads or tails of each other's thoughts while running on adrenaline? We need to test these new charms in a controlled environment.”
“I was looking at your arse when you turned around, and didn’t want those thoughts to slip through, so I started blathering to Nadia about American football, which is a terribly boring sport if I’m honest.”
Harry smiled at him so softly Draco felt his entire body go warm, sure a flush was rising to his cheeks.
“Oh?” Ron pulled his hand away from his face, smiling at them. “Well in that case, cheers. Please go do whatever you need to do and I will take you out to lunch, my treat. And we can go over how the test went.”
Harry scoffed and looked away,  “I’m not ready yet.”
“Oh.” he said.  Surely there were other words in the English language.  Why couldn’t he think of them? Harry ran a hand through his hair.  Draco was going on dates. Dates with people. “Er, yeah. That’s brilliant.”
“Oh come off it, Malfoy.  It’s only me. We’ve known each other since we were eleven.”
“Oh, Harry.” She stood and gave him a hug. She rested her head on his shoulder, and Harry’s arms came up around her.
“I reckon it is,” he grinned at Draco.
“Well enough.  That was a phase, anyway.  Just having a laugh.” he drawled.  And then winced.
“What?”
He squinted at them.
“Alright, Hermione?” He asked.
“Yes, love. It’s much simpler, just add water.”
The floo chimed from the main room of his flat.  Draco threw on his leather jacket and tucked a stray hair back under the beanie.  Just as Draco closed his bedroom door he heard Jean call out.
Malfoy shot a glance at Olivia and the rapidly spreading delight on her face.
“Had yourself a good night, then, eh Draco?” Blaise put in with an evil twinkle in his eye.
“Oi!”
“Potter!” he hissed.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I thought we’d say it was your application. And my name wouldn’t be on it.”
Harry was entirely uncomfortable with the direction this conversation had taken. Never in his life would he have thought Dudley would be grateful to him. He wasn’t quite sure how to handle it. So he downed the rest of his pint. Like any normal, healthy person would.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference? They both say brown sauce.” He murmured.
“Ooooh perfect. Is Countdown on?”
Draco cringed.
Draco sprang up from his seat and ran behind the counter toward her. She clung to him, shaken, but not crying, thank Merlin.
“Granger. I’ve been meaning to ow-write you. I’ve been meaning to write you. I er.. Well, I rather have a lot to apologise for. I would very much like to apologise, if you’ll let me.”
Draco threw the door open and snatched the potion out of her hands. He downed in a matter of seconds. “Merlin, I needed that.”
“Oi,” came a voice.
“Do you agree to these terms, Malfoy?  Were you listening at all?”
Together, Hermione and Harry manoeuvred Ron to the front room. They plopped him onto the sofa in front of the fireplace. Ron grinned up at his wife. “Love you.”
Harry nodded.  He ran a hand through his hair. “It was a lie.”
Harry shifted both his bags to one hand and grabbed her knitting tote with the other. He guided her over to the waiting group of ladies. Harry endured another round of what a nice young man he was. He turned down a few offers of tea and one offer to meet a single granddaughter. Harry checked his watch. Hermione was going to kill him for sure.
Harry grinned at him ruefully.  Draco came back in a moment later.  Harry watched him cross the room toward them and ignored the pounding in his chest.
“Course I did.”
"I am, yeah." Jean was bursting with elation.
Pansy drew herself up and looked down her nose at Davies in a spot on impression of Draco.  “That’s because I have impeccable taste.” she said in his drawl.  Draco narrowed his eyes at her.
“Right. Sorry.” The doors on the lift slid shut. Harry glared at the folder in his hands. Fucking Shacklebolt. He shoved the folder in his bag and glanced at his watch. Half past seven. Ron and the other Aurors would already be at the pub, celebrating. Fantastic.
A few wizards and witches gathered around behind Creevy. Draco’s gaze swept over them, looking for someone that might step in, but his heart sank when he recognised most of them as the tutting patrons of Slug & Jiggers. Some of whom looked eager to get in on the action. He was entirely surrounded, but even so Draco didn’t reach for his wand.
“Potter!”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, nearly apoplectic.  His cheeks tinged pink.
“Are those-”
“Oh, yeah. It was mental. Got into it with a referee. They were playing the Montrose Magpies and one of the Magpie fans bewitched a fake snitch. Somehow it got past security and the Magpie fan made it fly down Farraux’s trousers.” Ron sniggered.
Draco
He felt lightheaded, his breath came in rapid gasps.  The world around him darkened.
Harry wondered if Draco had ever tried growing facial hair but wisely decided not to ask.  “Felt like it was time for a change is all.  I’ll probably grow it back.”
was written across the top.
“Listen, anything you can do to help would be wonderful.”
“You did? It was ‘mazin, it was. I mean, I was dying. And Harry just-” Dudley made sure there was no one overhearing them, he continued in a whisper “magicked them away.” He sat back in the booth. “It was incredible.”
Guilt spread through Draco like spilled milk. Not only had Blaise agreed to be the face and name of their venture, but he was letting his obligations to Draco encroach on his dating life.
“Where is Malfoy living these days? Is he still in Wiltshire?” Harry asked carefully, dragging his eyes back to Olivia, who slid into Draco’s place across from Harry.
Harry snickered, “Ee-lek-trik” he sounded out.
"And I have a confession.”
“Fuuuuuuck.”
Harry sighed heavily and downed the last of the tea.
“Forget it.”  he said. If Malfoy was determined to misunderstand Harry’s every word there was no point in trying to explain himself.
“Need I remind you I am with Jean?”
Harry threw back his head and laughed.  Malfoy, no, Draco smirked at him. Harry stuck out his hand, “Friends?”
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Apology accepted. Tea?” He glanced up to get the server’s attention.
“Er, no,” Harry said and shot a glance at Malfoy. “Cedric… wasn’t my boyfriend. We didn’t-” Harry’s mind went briefly blank. What was happening? How did Harry end up here? Having this conversation with Dudley Dursley and Draco Malfoy. He scratched the back of his neck. “We didn’t date or anything.”
Draco looked down his nose at the dreadful man currently wielding a knife and insulting him.
“Malfoy?”
“Us.”
“Oh, now you care about following rules suddenly? Madam Pomfrey would be shitting herself if she heard you say that.”
“I beg your unbelievable pardon, Auror Potter?”
Ron took down an old Cleansweep and a relatively modern Comet.  Harry, snitch already in hand, dug around in the shed behind The Burrow until he found their old quaffle and bludgers.  Once they got to the empty field, Harry let only one of the bludgers loose. He and Ron played one on one quidditch behind the Burrow when they could get away from Sunday Dinners.  Their time for game play seemed to decrease the further into adulthood they progressed. On the one hand, it made Harry a little sad they played so little. On the other, his back ached for days afterward.
“Go on,” Granger said.
Harry kept rubbing soft circles into Draco's back.
“No, I was just getting it out on paper like you said.” Harry shrugged at the intensity of her gaze. “I dunno. Why are you staring at me?”
Harry tried to suppress any secret delight that Malfoy tracked his dating life at Hogwarts. He sat up straight and fixed his glasses. Of course Draco paid attention. How else could he have humiliated Harry so astutely? The valentine Ginny’d sent second year still haunted his dreams. Not so much the valentine itself, but Malfoy finding it and then reciting it from memory.
Potter whirled around.  “Did you just hit me with an apple?”
Draco came and stood beside Harry and said gently, “Harry.”
Harry and Malfoy shared a confused glance.
“Wasn’t it?” Malfoy said, his voice haughty and disdainful.
“They’re not that bad.” Harry said, taking a bite of his burger.
“I don’t remember that.”
” Creevy’s voice broke down into sobs.
“Well, I wouldn’t have to if you would stop a moment and talk to me.” Potter looked around them, confused. “Why are we in the jumper section?”
Draco blinked a few times.  “Pardon?”
Draco eyed the machine with suspicion. “You don’t have to plug it in?”
Harry sighed. After all, he knew it was coming. He hated disappointing people. But Hermione was right (as usual.) He’d spent his adolescence as Dumbledore’s unwitting and then very witting pawn. He didn’t want the same for his twenties, though they were mostly gone.
As if that clarified anything at all. Sure, he’s heard the words before. He just didn’t have any context for them. She may as well have said “muggle place, like the muggle word.”
He pulled out what the muggles called “a fiver” and passed it to her. “Please take this fiver.”
“Very professional Auror Potter,” Draco sneered.
“And you’re with Jean.”
Potter grinned up at Jean and stuck out his hand.  “How are you mate?”
“Harry… Are you just now getting out of bed?” Hermione asked
“It’s Breanne, actually”
“I’ll miss you, Harry.” Ginny Weasley said, her breathy voice set Draco on edge.
“Hiya.”
“But I think that was the problem.
“Well it’s not like you could fix them if anything happened.”
“Alright, my darling.” Ron said to Rosie. “I’ve gotcha. We’ll just kip off for a lovely nap. A lovely six or seven-hour nap. How does that sound, eh? Who knows, maybe we’ll get in an eight-hour nap.”
He sipped his tea and avoided her discerning brown eyes. “Great.”
Harry nodded and Draco continued. “No marriage.  No children. We could catch a port key to Paris, floo to Fiji.  We were free! We could make love in front of the fireplace without having to worry about stepping on lego or storey books.  It was almost a relief to finally be with someone who was on the same page.
“Pardon?”
Draco tapped his wand against the slate board.  Glowing white lines shot out into a shape that very little resembled the image he was going for.  He pursed his lips and tapped again, a few little squiggles were added.
“We’ve already finished helping your nan.” Harry replied.  “What do you reckon, Ron? Think they can take us?”
Harry glanced at him but was too wound up to allow himself to be calmed down.  “Do yourselves a favor!  Write your names in everything!  Every sodding book you own!  Otherwise you’ll spend thousands of pounds in litigation deciding who gets this copy of Quidditch Through the Ages.  Never mind it was given to me as a gift!”
It was Lee Jordan announcing, of course.  Potter gave a little wave and the screen moved on.  Draco took some satisfaction in Potter’s discomfort at being singled out but it was short lived.  Just before he was off screen Draco saw Potter do a double take. Fuck. He’d definitely been seen.  The shaggy black hair turned about in the seat to face him directly.
“You’re sleeping on the floor.” Millie said.
“No one.” Draco said at once.
Once they were in the kitchen he began taking down mugs from the top shelf and handing them to Hermione while the kettle heated up.
“While you were having a mental breakdown and stared at the pavement for ten solid minutes.”  Draco inspected Harry.  “Can you pull yourself together?”
“One in every corner you can find.” Hermione replied, barely glancing at them. She pulled out a roll of parchment and began crossing things off. “Harry, I need you on toadstool duty next.”
“Well he said he was getting married last time I saw him.”
Harry looked up confused.  “Course not. I didn’t stay the night.  Left, didn’t I?"
Draco went back to his bar prep, not meeting her eyes.  “A few days ago.”
Andrew reached his arm around Harry’s waist and leaned in to whisper in his ear “I might just pop off to use the loo.” He pecked Harry on the cheek.
“‘Mione and me.”
“Where did you go?”
Pomona caressed Herb’s shoulder, “He was just the same, wasn’t he?"
Draco felt himself flush. He looked away and nodded. Neither of them said anything for a moment.
There was a moment of silence.  Draco thought about ending the call.  Why had he even answered it?
“Lovely to meet you,” replied Olivia, who smile bright and friendly.
“Right. So. You know Channel 4, yeah?”
“Don’t be silly. Have a cuppa.” Hermione said. She tossed a pillow at him. He shoved it under his head. “I’m so very tired, Harry.”
“Shut it, you.” He said to Malfoy. He turned back to Dudley, “Things are.. Fine?” Harry had no idea where this was going. Was he asking about his and Malfoy’s relationship? Twice? What planet was he on where Dudley was concerned about his relationships? Reality felt another step back, like this day was looking through a foe-glass and everything was just a little out of focus.
Proud.
Harry laughed.  “Do you, though?  Fancy seeing a film with me?”
“Jean and I broke up.”
“Ten seconds left!” Granger called out.
“Fuck.”  Harry ran his hands up through his hair and sat on the steps.  He sighed heavily.  “Shit.  I’m sorry.”
“I can’t believe how wrong you are.  You’re muggleborn. Doesn’t that grant you some better understanding of how they work?”
Harry watched Malfoy tuck a stray hair behind his ear.
“Where do you want these?”
“But on a wall?”
Here they were: another train, another offer of friendship.  And Draco had rejected it without a moment’s thought. Hadn’t Draco just said he was trying to move on?
“That sounds very healthy.”
“Welcome to the singles club,” he said as he passed it over.
He spent the rest of the night listening to the drunken version of how they caught Rookwood. Desperately trying to ignore the hollow pit that opened up in his stomach. He should be happy for Ron; this was a monumental case for them. Christ knows Ron deserved it. The last of the Death Eaters finally in Azkaban. Fuck. Harry downed his pint. He should have been with them. Not at some fucking publicity stunt. It was a struggle to limit himself to one pint.
“Did you say flatmate?” Potter shoved his glasses up by the bridge on his nose and crossed his arms. “You have a flatmate?”
“Did you have a panic attack?” Hermione. Rosie began squirming in her arms and making upset noises.
The undersecretary laughed nervously. “Well, sir, you are
“You.”
“No. You were bloody perfect.” Malfoy replied almost accusatively. His voice went a bit odd, somehow both reverent and sullen. A heavy silence fell over the table as Malfoy’s words sunk in. He was studying his pint again.
“I’m not sure if you’re aware, Potter, but music and films are two very different forms of culture.”
It was a new contract for a position in the Ministry, which fell outside of the D.M.L.E. Harry glanced at it, shaking his head, his hand on his chin.
Ron’s ears tinged red.  “Sometimes they come back.” he said, sheepishly.
Pansy’s face changed from shock to pity and it made Harry even angrier.
“Next one’s in a quarter hour” he told Malfoy.  “Hold out your arm?”
“He never forgot me.”  She was so pleased, the warmth radiated from her face.
Harry ignored Malfoy’s comment. “Er yeah, Magic.” Dudley flinched. “Sometimes it skips a generation, but yeah. It runs in families a lot of the time.”
Blaise raised his eyebrows and feigned innocence, “You mentioned a business opportunity?”
to him.
“She went out with him first. Since the Yule Ball, actually. I dunno.. I think maybe we were looking for him in each other. And it was… too much.”
“Have you got a pen?”
“Oh?”  Draco would never date his friends' relatives.  He’d seen what a nightmare that had been for Blaise.  Although Blaise was handsome enough that he pretty much never brought out anger in people anyway.  He could smile a way any ill will. Draco was not so lucky. He’d learned to stay clear of entanglements of that nature.
They shared a laugh.  Draco angled his face slightly so Potter couldn’t look at him full on.
After reaching a satisfactory arrangement with Blaise, Draco returned to the Manor. To face a far less satisfactory arrangement.  He waited for the Ministry Officials to arrive with dread. Aunt Andromeda and his mother took the most illustrious of the Black Family heirlooms to the countryside in France. They did not list the items in the Assets his mother had sent to the solicitor.. Exuberant Ministry Officials seized many of the remaining Malfoy relics.
Draco nodded.  He indicated to his left, “You remember-”
“Malfoy?” Granger said again with more conviction in her voice.
“I’d believe you more if I hadn’t just found you passed out in Sirius’s old room with a bottle of Ogden’s Finest.” He had a point there.
Ron popped another bean into his mouth and chewed cautiously.  “Peppermint. Go on.”
“Thanks, Becky.” Harry said tersely and stepped into the lift.
Ron’s jaw dropped.
Olivia made insipid cooing noises at the baby.
“Well, maybe when you were a child.  That’s not who you are now.  You have a muggle bar for christ sake.  You’ve covered your mark with pretty flowers.”  Harry's voice made Draco feel more solid.  Less like he was crumbling and more like he was being steadied.
“Why’s that?” Jean’s eyes were scanning the crowd looking for the stairwell to the Top Box.
When he finally talked to her about it, Ginny confessed she had fallen for someone else. Her behaviour made more sense in that context. Especially their lack of any sort of romantic physical contact. And he couldn’t fault her for falling in love with Neville. They’d bonded during the year he was away. War did that to people. Made them realise what was important. Who was important. Look at Ron and Hermione. Lupin and Tonks. Bill and Fluer. Ginny and Neville. Harry and… Shit, he needed to stop doing that. He needed to stop thinking of everyone in pairs. Sirius hadn’t been part of a pair and he had been fine. Harry ignored the part of his brain telling him how very far from fine Sirius had been.
“You look really fit in muggle clothes,” the words spilled out of Harry's mouth without his permission.  He tried to ignore the flush in his cheeks.  And because he couldn't stop himself, "Like that leather jacket you used to wear."  He ran a hand up the back of his neck, "with the skinny jeans?"
Harry acquiesced to Hermione, setting him up with another muggle who she knew was a distant relative of some friend or acquaintance. He was going to have to have a serious talk with her about this new hobby. Harry didn’t think he could handle another rubbish first date full of small talk and partial truths.
He looked up to find Blaise Zabini standing at this side. Draco stood and shook his hand. “Please, sit down” he gestured toward the chair, “And no, I wasn’t brooding. I never brood.”
“More like the Molly Weasley Grandchild Disappointment Club,” he said.
“It’s blue!”
“We knew each other in a moment.  It was as though no time had passed at all.” Pomona continued.
“I see you’ve found the drinks.” Hermione said, kissing Harry on the cheek.  Her face was flushed.  A few strands of curls were spilling out of the enormous bun atop her head.  She was wearing a lovely dress of deep blue that sparkled when it moved.  Her eyes trailed Harry up and down with approval.
“Why don’t we ever have mash?” Victorie asked Fleur, who was sitting beside Bill at the other end of the table. Harry couldn’t remember exactly how old she was now. Surely she was starting primary school?
“Franc’s always had anger problems, especially when he’s on the outs with his girlfriend. But this is too far, even for him.” She finished hitting the mobile and slid it back into her pocket. She looked up at Draco in their crouched position behind the counter. “Think I should try to talk to him?”
“But Jean didn’t want those things. He still doesn’t want to get married.  Completely opposed to children.  He has no interest in connecting with his family. He may have had a good reason for that, but I can’t say for certain because he never spoke of them.  But that’s another matter. What I wanted had changed, what he wanted hadn’t. I said ‘It’s over then, isn’t it?’”
Merlin, if they stayed here any longer, clothes would start coming off and imagine the papers, then.  “Auror Potter Attempts Procreation at Kings Cross.” Draco bit back a smile. As much as it would serve the tosser right, Draco couldn’t afford to miss the train.
“I'll miss you too.”
“I’m shit at art.” Draco said, leaning into Luc.
They looked at each other, searching for the next chapter of their story.  Kingley hesitated but continued when Vera smiled, confident and hospitable.
“Mms brlllln,” chimed in Ron with his mouthful. He chewed a few times before he swallowed.
“Oh, er.” Draco looked away from Harry, “I can’t tonight, actually.”
“Last time I saw Potter we were on the train together five years ago and believe me when I say it was the longest train ride I’ve ever taken.”
“You have.”
George didn’t respond. He lit a cigarette with his wand and took a deep drag.
“Oh cheer up, love. I couldn’t be too bad. You were just kids, after all.” She patted his arm and steered him toward the checkout counter. “We’ll stop and get you a nice chocolate button, then, eh?”
“If you don’t want to help me, the least you can do is bugger off,” he said. He turned and found his way out of the clothing and back to the food items part of the store. When he located the bread, he turned to find Potter still behind him.
“Why didn’t she tell you? Or me for that reason, I’m her brother!”
“You’re not intimidating, you know.” he drawled.
“If you need help, I could take care of the kitchens for you?”
“Brilliant.”  Jean kissed his cheek.  “See you in a bit.”
“Harry, we were really counting on your help.” Shacklebolt frowned. He leaned forward and clasped his hands on the enormous desk. “The Ministry needs your support. The public values your opinion too highly for you not to use it for the greater good.”
“Well, yes, rather.”
“Right.”  The intensity of Potter’s stare was overwhelming.  Draco felt as if he were an insect pinned to the wall for scrutiny.  “Sign here.”
Harry didn’t reply but he didn’t think it was that odd, not the bit about paying parents.  That was just weird. But an only child growing up on such a large estate was bound to be a bit lonely.  Mind you Harry would have swapped his cupboard and tormentors for an estate and paid mates any time.  He bit back another smile.
Hermione sighed heavily. “I sent you instructions, didn’t you get them?”
A bout of cheering went out in the top box, Harry wasn’t sure why.
“It’s alright, darling.”
“Hermione.. Hermione..” Olivia said, “I know I’ve heard it before.
The single pint Harry had at the Drunken Doxy had long since worn off. Along with the encumbrance that came with drinking in public. Harry didn’t bother with the light and made right for the drinks trolley Kreacher kept well stocked. He poured himself a generous measure of Firewhisky. When Harry first graduated from Auror training, he, Hermione, and Ron spent their weekends at Grimmauld Place plotting its renovation. Often interspersed with threats of total demolition from Harry. But life rather got in the way. He and Ron started to get cases. Hermione began working her way up the ladder of Magical Law. The plans never came to fruition. In fact, the only room that got finished was the master suite. They’d converted the entire wall facing the back garden into thick glass. They tore the old carpeting up to expose dark wood flooring. His four poster king-size bed was draped with deep burgundy curtains. It was sat in the middle of a deep fluffy white rug meant to resemble animal fur. There was a desk on the wall facing the street. Harry found himself watching the streets below rather than getting anything useful done. His bedroom also contained a fireplace, not hooked up to the Floo network. Eventually, Harry tired of standing in front of the glass wall and levitated his armchair over.
Harry dragged Draco through the crowd, their hands clasped tight.
“With you leaving.”  The
They left the party separately.  Draco said goodnight to Ron and Hermione before leaving out the front door and disappearing into the dark.  Harry watched him go and flooed back to Grimmuald place not long after.  He ignored all thoughts of Draco’s cologne and the way he’d moaned Harry’s name in the pub all those weeks ago.
“It does?”  Malfoy paused for a moment thinking it over, then his confidence came back. He smirked at Harry, “It does, doesn’t it.  I am nothing if not resilient.”
“I have to agree. It’s a bit much.”
“I’m getting married, Drake.” Jean couldn’t keep the joy out of his voice.  He was putting forth quite a lot of effort to sound neutral.  Draco couldn’t decide if it was out of pity or some warped sense of professionalism.  “I didn’t want you to hear it from anyone else.  Thought it might be in poor taste.”
“O’Dogherty.” Harry nodded at the Irishman “Alright, mate?”
Potter’s eyes caught the badge above Jean’s breast pocket.  “I’ll take you over Rita Skeeter any day.”
“Oh.”
Draco waited until she was out of sight before rolling his eyes. He trudged after her to the kitchen, where she sat beside Blaise at the table like two disappointed parents who caught their teen sneaking out at night. Disappointed parents were something Draco was all too familiar with. Though the reasons they were disappointed in him were more severe than sneaking out. More along the lines of muggleborns beating him in every class at Hogwarts. Or showing revulsion in the presence of other Death Eaters at their cruelty. You know, normal teenage drama.
“You’ve already done that joke.”  Potter poked him in the shoulder.
“I can see you come by your eloquence naturally, Potter.”
“Thirty five years to the day after our first wedding.” Vera added, also smiling.
“I cannot believe we are having his conversation.” Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose.
She shrugged. “People like variety, I suppose.”
They watched suburbs of London fly past the windows.  If Malfoy was so determined to be a prat Harry would leave him to it.  They could sit in silence for the remainder of the journey for all Harry cared.  Draco Sodding Malfoy and his complete misunderstanding of one of the greatest films in existence.
Harry still hadn’t come out of his daze.  “Yeah, we’re um.   Er we’re..”
“I beg your pardon?”
Potter had the good grace to realize he’d stepped in it.
“Not only that, but we had this exact conversation two hours ago. You said we couldn’t be friends and that’s all there is to say on the matter.” Malfoy said.
Roger followed Harry’s gaze to Draco.  “Oh, come on, mate.  It’s brilliant, isn’t it?  Pans, come on.  I haven’t slagged off anything you’ve brought.”
Harry nodded and followed Ron out to the den. Mrs Weasley now sat next to Mr Weasley on the loveseat, his arm around her shoulders. They spoke in hushed tones. Ron sat at the coffee table across from George and set up the chessboard. Ginny was half draped over Neville, on the arm of a comfy chair. Bill and Fluer were ensconced on the sofa beside Hermione, with Victorie playing with a toy wand at their feet. Each time she tapped the wand against its accompanying ball, it changed to a different colour, occasionally accompanied by a chiming noise. Harry snagged a chair from the dining room and sat in it backwards, holding his nearly empty wineglass in one hand and let the ambiance of The Burrow wash over him.
“Right.” She said, taken aback.
Draco couldn't stop the smile forming if he’d been stupefied.  “Cause I’m Mr. Brightside.” he joined in again.  He wasn’t as confident.  But he picked it up.  He’d finally got the last line when he noticed Harry had gone still.
“They’re just through there-” he gestured to where the other ladies had gathered in the corner.
“You’re quite fit.” Harry said.
Harry flooed to Grimmauld Place. The list of things Harry should do was extensive . He should write that article for the Daily Prophet Shacklebolt had asked him to do. Go over the schedule MaybeBridget sent home with him. Respond to Charlie’s offer to come visit Romania. He should go to bed, if he’s honest. Harry climbed the stairs to the top floor he’d converted to the master suite.
“There’s nothing to talk about.  Potter was there, we didn’t get on.  And you know my history with the war.”
“It’s like just after the war, and I couldn’t go anywhere without being mobbed.  Neither could he. Only it was worse for him, people were trying to hex him.”
“We’ve led very different lives, Harry.”
Olivia cackled again. “You love me!”
“And he’s… like you?” Dudley asked.
Draco waited until the doors stopped swinging before sliding his wand out. He started with the smoking oven. He vanished the smoke as soon as he had the door opened. Then he used a cooling charm on the tray so he could slide them out. Another flick of the wand sent the burnt tarts into the bin. The kitchen was spotless and in order within a matter of minutes. He looked around at the gleaming space, proud of doing something kind for a muggle. If it also benefited him, well, that was hardly his fault.
“Malfoy.”
Harry laughed.  “On a blank wall, Malfoy.  Not one covered in portraits or trinkets.”
“Thank you. I personally would much rather have you practice duels to practicals. Draco, what do you think?” Harry asked, looking at Draco for the first time since the charm had been cast.
“You can’t stop touching me, can you?” Draco asked softly, a smile in his voice.
“But?” Draco’s eyebrows went up as he stepped back from Harry, his hands leaving Harry’s chest, leaving him cold.
Harry sighed in relief, “No, no, but thank you.”
For some reason, that caused Harry to giggle against his mouth. The words,
Hermione giggled behind her hand, brushing a stray curl out of her eyes, “Please tell me Ron isn’t going to have to charge either of you with indecent exposure.”
Harry’s voice popped into Draco’s head again. Draco shivered as the feeling of Harry’s voice in his head sent a strange sensation down his spine, but he turned to level a look at Harry regardless, trying to get used to the new sensations, pleased when Harry laughed quietly.
“Mind linking.” Draco said, suddenly very interested in his shoes.
Harry laughed as he stood, ignoring the twinge in his knees from being on them for so long, and leaning his body heavily against Draco’s back, kissing the back of his neck and running his hands over his body.
“You’re going to be a handful, aren’t you?”
“I take it from your expressions, it’s working?” Ron asked. They both nodded.
Harry muttered something under his breath, Draco only making out, “mind his own business” before Harry turned to him, “Do you really want to try this? Or do you want to just wait for another one?”
Draco shrugged, “I am fine either way. I know this is a bit touchy for you, so whatever you’re comfortable with, I am okay with.”
“You really have got to do something about that, you know. If it helps, I think you’ll like the result.” She whispered to him softly, her fingers curling around his hair, caressing like he had seen her do with Rose. He placed his hand on her knee and squeezed lightly, nodding his ascent.
“I guess someone ought to follow you so you don’t get lost.” Draco said, his mouth quirking just slightly into a soft smile.
“Did you just say ‘twirling’?” A posh voice sounded from just ahead of them, Harry’s head snapping up as his face colored, mentally hoping Draco couldn’t see it on his tanned complexion.
“We got it!” Draco exclaimed as he rushed through his and Harry’s shared office door.
Draco felt Harry’s surprise and then startled pain as a strong stinging hex from Nadia landed on Harry’s wrist. Draco was surprised too; Harry had put down his shield but not attacked. He wondered if Harry was trying to let the recruit best him and internally scoffed.
Soon, they developed a rhythm, Draco pushing himself backwards onto Harry’s tongue and then fucking his cock forward into the circle of Harry’s hand. Harry could tell when Draco began to get close, his hole tightening around Harry’s tongue and his breath getting faster.
Harry groaned, closing his eyes from how delicious it was to hear Draco ask for what he wanted, and rushed to comply. He continued to stroke Draco softly as he pressed his tongue into Draco, his hole giving way after so much attention, finally allowing Harry entrance.
“I am going to take that as a compliment.”
They had five recruits, a small batch compared to when they were in training, although numbers had steadily declined as they got more distance from the war. Draco looked them over, putting names to faces and trying to remember anything the other Auror’s had told them about this group.
“How about we shower here, separately,” Harry said firmly, nose scrunching amused at Draco’s groan of annoyance, “and meet at the lifts. We can go to that ridiculously hipster pub you like.”
“I’m fine. Just strange feeling someone else thinking in my head.” Harry laughed quietly, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes.
“Draco,” Harry whined, a furrow forming in his brow, “you know mental links make me nervous. And
“Really? We're in the middle of something here. Accept the compliment at your ridiculous ability to do wandless magic like it’s no big deal, and kiss me you idiot.”
Harry nodded, making a face at having to do paperwork, Draco turned to flick on the wireless to a low hum of jazz music as they settled in.
Harry opened his eyes and looked down at Draco, who was staring back up at him, still kitten licking at him, looking much too self satisfied for the one of them that hadn’t come yet.
It was Harry’s turn to laugh, as Draco’s mind unhelpfully sent through some decidedly dirty shower fantasies.
“I don’t think poorly of you, Draco. Please look at me.” Harry said softly, standing just outside the conference room and pulling Draco gently to a stop beside him.
“One of us more than the rest.” Ron joked quietly, his eyebrows dancing before he grunted in discomfort when Harry elbowed him in the side as Draco turned away to make space for them to enter the otherwise empty compartment.
Harry hummed, “you keep telling yourself that.”
Blaise grinned lewdly, looking very much like the cat that got the cream as Neville colored brightly, still smiling slightly as Blaise nuzzled him, Harry’s stomach flipping at the open display.
“Yes? I’ll get them back later, I swear.”
“No need to sound so offended, we’ve been partners for over 6 years, you plunker.” Draco sniffed jokingly as he entered the lift behind Harry, adding, “I wish we could have tested the wandlessly activated body armour, but we were already on the Wilkinson case and I definitely wouldn’t have wanted to field test it when it was so new, you know?”
After a long beat, Harry asked,
Harry chuckled, clutching the back of Draco’s neck as he sucked roughly at the junction between his neck and shoulder, “Thought you’d appreciate them. Pansy helped me pick them out.”
He half shrugged, dropping Ron a bit in the process.
Harry sat for a moment, nonplussed. He blinked. “My condition?”
“Ooohh, what about Millie?” Pansy cooed.  “She’s looking quite fit these days.”
The wave had begun near them in the stadium.  Harry and Ron stood to raise their arms along with the crowd and sat back down.  Harry slouched in his seat.
Harry tilted his head and squinted.  He shoved his glasses up and settled down into the sofa with his arm around Andrew.  They looked very cozy for having been dating three weeks.  Not that Draco was keeping track.  Andrew turned and smiled up at Harry.  Harry brushed a stray lock of blonde hair out of his face.  Draco felt a bit sick.
Olivia slid her own phone out from her pocket and began hitting it with her thumbs.
“Thanks for dragging me with you Harry.” Draco said.  Not an ounce of disdain or derision. Harry was struck again by how much Draco had grown as a person.  How lucky he was to have Draco as a friend.   “This was...” he trailed off and Harry realized he was staring at Draco's lips.
Draco remained suspicious.  “I should? Are you having a go at me?”
As they were passing Weasley Wizarding Wheezes George caught Harry through the shop front and gave him a nod.  Harry nodded back. He watched George’s eyes clock Draco beside him and raised an eyebrow. Harry tried to ignore the colour in his cheeks as George gave him a final querying look before he turned back to his customer.
Draco closed his eyes again taking another drink and let out a groan that was downright indecent.
A smile crept up Harry's face, fond and awed.  He kissed Draco again.  It was the rough slide of lips and stubble.  It was the thousandth time Harry kissed him.
“Oh” said Harry, “Oh, like
“Do de cul aaaiir.”
“Hogwarts.” Harry replied. His ears were assaulted by the scratching needle of the still spinning gramophone. He flicked his hand at it to stop the damn thing from moving. It didn’t work. Harry glanced around for his wand and got it from the dresser beside Sirius’s bed. He waved the wand, and the needle stopped its abhorrent scraping.
She opened her mouth to respond, but Draco held up a hand.
“I suppose it was bound to be a bit of slog your first time back out there.” Draco said, hesitantly.  He turned to the work station and began slicing thin strips of willow bark. “But it’s a good job you’re trying.”
“Oh, I’ve got a phone.” Granger answered hesitantly. She looked at Draco curiously, “Do you have a mobile?”
Harry warred with himself for a moment. He wanted what was best for everyone. But it couldn’t be at the expense of losing himself. He’d already died for them once. Wasn’t that enough? It was time for him to live for his own sake.
“Er..”
“The one who plays for the Hollyhead Harpies?”
Malfoy and Dudley looked down at their nearly full glasses.
“Did you hear? The Cannons are in the market for a new seeker.”
“A tuba? In an orchestra, are you?”
“Wicked.” George followed suit and cast a scourfingy on himself, with a wand, of course.
He cleared his throat. “I don’t think so. I’m not hungry.”
Harry opened his mouth to make excuses, but found he couldn’t quite manage it. He shook his head.
Draco shook his hand without hesitation.  “Friends.”
Harry snorted a laugh. “We weren’t exactly mates.”
“Sod off.”  Harry said without any heat.  “Oh this is brilliant!” he grabbed Draco’s arm and dragged him over to a medium sized box.  Draco assumed it was medium sized.  Larger than the last item.  Not as big as a telly.  He supposed that must make it medium.
“Now, I’ve given you a pretty simple list. Some veg, some bread, very easy.”
“You are going to love it, Draco. I don’t watch the normal one, though. That’s for pensioners. The Cats’ version is the ticket.”
“What?  How is that any worse than your pomegranate seeds?  Both seeds, aren’t they.”
Ron chuckled and shook his head.  “You mean after he obliviated himself?”
With that, he left. Draco watched him go and calculated the chances of Potter finding out about the incident. It didn’t bode well for him. Yet another instance of Draco making a prat of himself in public. Requiring rescue from the still Golden Trio. Abhorrent, that. But there was nothing he could do about it, he thought glumly as he turned round the bend into Knockturn Alley.
Harry should feel fine about it.  A dinner party was nothing to worry about.  But Harry rarely brought home dates.  Even more rarely exposed them to his friends.  They were mostly muggles and didn’t particularly matter.  Andrew was the first guy he’d brought home, so to speak.  The fame didn’t phase him, which was refreshing.  There was something about him that Harry found compelling, he couldn’t put a finger on what it was exactly.  Maybe the fine American accent or the fancy clothes.
Potter snorted, further proving Draco’s point.
“Oi.” came a voice.
Draco flopped over onto his stomach and drew the covers up to his chin. His left foot had grown cold, poking out of the bottom. He pulled that under the covers too. The sun was coming up, filling the room with unasked-for light. Draco hated mornings. Even on his mornings off, he couldn’t sleep into a normal hour any longer. He was too used to his four am shift. He hated his four am shift. Draco stared absently at the window, willing the sun to die.
“Nervous, Malfoy?” She taunted.
“Which meant you had to mention me.” Draco added, dryly.
“What a beautiful name, Hermione!” Oliva said as she and Granger shook hands. “Now where have I heard that before?”
Draco sat beside him a few moments later.  “I’m not surprised you’re shit at occlumency you know.”
“Come on, mate. Let him go.” Weasley’s voice was empathetic, oozing with concern.  Draco hated him.
Harry moved down the line. He made note of the items that looked familiar either from Hogwarts or The Burrow. By the time he reached the register, Harry was fully prepared. And no longer worried his contribution would be underwhelming. Was he going to his ex-girlfriend’s engagement brunch? Yes. Was she marrying one of his closest friends? Yes. Did Harry know what an engagement brunch was? No. But that’s what Hermione was for. All he had to do was bring the pastries and convince everyone he was fine. Because he was. If he was lucky, Harry might convince everyone to play quidditch after. Although, now that Ginny played on a professional level.. Harry thought she may not want to spend her only day off the pitch back on the pitch.
Potter did not take the bait.  In fact he huffed a small laugh.  Draco stared openly at him.
Ron looked over his shoulder, “Bad luck, mate.”
Draco had been about to put her in her place with a smug “obviously.” when he caught the look on her face. His spirits sank. “Was I not supposed to?”
.  I asked him if he ever met Gilderoy Lockheart, Andrew didn’t even know who he was.  Born after Lockheart went mad.”
Draco sighed and moved his feet so Olivia could sit down. As it turned out, Countdown was Draco’s favourite thing in the muggle world. Competitive, intelligent, absurd, and best of all, he got to use his ballpoint pen (which Draco was now obsessed with; he always had one in his jacket pocket).
“Engagement brunch.” Harry said.
“You’re missing the point, Draco.” She began tapping away.  “Alright, I’ve set you up a profile. Let’s see who we can find.”
“Saw it with my own eyes. Ask Neville!”
Pansy was still whinging about the dining set her married lover purchased with his wife.  Draco shook his head again.
One of the best parts of wizarding flats was their commonplace brewing stations. Blaise’s was spacious and, best of all, empty. He was too busy pursuing conquests to spend any time brewing. And if he was honest, he knew Blaise was shit at Potions. Always had been.
She looked like she would say more, but George drowned her out.
“Because that’s the name I use at work.  Must we discuss this? We’re missing the mascot displays.”
“What? Course, yeah.” Harry looked away and scratched the back of his neck.  “Mind you, when we were in Flourish & Blotts the other day I found a copy of
She gripped Draco’s shoulders and physically turned him round.  “What I was trying to show you is Harry Potter standing at that table” she whispered aggressively.  “Pretending to look at a book and he keeps looking up at you every five seconds.”
“Obviously it would be a blank wall.  That was my first thought, of course.  A blank wall.”  It wasn’t.  He had no idea what Harry was talking about.
Did they really need this conversation in the middle of a muggle supermarket? And why wasn’t Potter trying to hex him? “I shouldn’t have said that.”
Harry nodded.  “Followed her, didn’t I.  Morbid curiosity I suppose.  I just wanted to see this place she was going to be living her Harry Potter-free life.  But it wasn’t her team mate’s flat. It was Neville’s.”
“Have a good night, out then?”
“Sorry, didn’t mean to pry.”
“What, Malfoy?” he snapped.
“You are literally following me as we speak.”
“I was livid and I asked her when she booked the movers but she wouldn’t look me in the eye.  Meanwhile I look like I’ve gone mad. And obviously this was going to be in The Prophet. Potter Gone Mental Over Failed Marriage. But in for a penny, in for a pound.  I asked one of the blokes shrinking my furniture when Ginny called them.”
His grey eyes narrowed dangerously, but Harry didn’t care.
“She didn’t start a fight with you, did she? Though being a new mum, I doubt she’d have the energy for it. Did everyone at your school have mental hair?”
“Mental.”
The stairwell had nearly cleared out.  They were alone standing entirely too close together.  Draco swallowed. Then he turned round and stormed off.  Harry stood still for a few moments, waiting for his mind to catch up with his body.  What on earth just happened?
Draco shook his head, silently signaling Harry to shut up already.  Harry didn’t care.  “And then!  Then it’s six years later and you’re singing karaoke at a shop like a complete idiot and in she walks with the person she left you for!”
“Shit, really?”
She gave them a brief nod and pushed her trolley toward the register.
“Course it is.” Harry said, bracingly.  He glanced down at Draco’s outfit. His robes were a pale blue colour.  They had a high collar, and ended mid thigh in the front, but the back side had tails that went down past his knees.   The trousers beneath them were a fine dove grey wool. “That what you’re wearing?”
Hermione’s face grew more concerned as she read on. By the end, her mouth became a thin line. When she closed the journal, she looked at Harry with something akin to alarm.
Harry held back a smile.
“I should go apologize to Pansy and Davies.”
“Talk to you?” Draco stopped and turned to face him, at a complete loss. “Why on earth do you want to talk to me? And why is there a jumper section in this place? I thought it was a supermarket?” Draco privately congratulated himself on using the term correctly. “Why would I buy clothing from a place that wraps its veg in plastic? Do you understand this place, Potter?”
“You have mates I don’t know about?”
“I-” Draco bit his lip.  “I suppose I’m a bit on edge, Potter.  We could be friends, couldn’t we?”
“We do that.”
The door opened and a muggle couple came in.  Pansy grabbed her own apron and trotted over to the table where they sat. Draco marveled at her ability to work an eight hour shift in heels. It was inhuman.
Harry choked on his beer.
Draco felt nauseous.  Something had to be done.
“Er.. What?”
Draco narrowed his eyes at her.
“Hermione,” she said.
Harry shook his head. “I’d best be heading home.” He pushed himself off the wall and handed the glass back to Malfoy. “Give me apologies to Olivia and the other one, would you?”
“She was just going through the motions because I’m Harry Potter. And who wouldn’t want to marry Harry Sodding Potter, you know?”
“Stop doing that.” The words escaped before Draco could tamp them down. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. No need to snap at one of the few people who still tolerated his presence.
“No coffee, thanks. Cheers -”
This information did not appear to penetrate Potter’s thick skull.  “We’re late, Potter.” he drawled.
“No, you didn’t.” Draco spat.  “I haven’t been up to anything.  I haven’t been rebuilding my father’s nefarious network of followers.  I haven’t been harassing muggles in the streets. I haven’t been up to a bloody thing.”
“Oh!” the light came on. “That’s where I’ve heard the name! Harry, Harry Potter mentioned her. They’re friends, aren’t they?”
“Realistically, do you think he’d actually throw the knife? Or..” he made a stabbing motion with his hand.
