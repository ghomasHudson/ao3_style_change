“Fuck, you’re so beautiful,” he murmured, and Draco thought he might faint at the reverence in Harry’s tone.  It was completely undeserved, and therefore twice as stimulating, and Draco crashed their lips together again – hard at first, then tender.  Harry held him in place against the wall, and he did all he could to squirm closer.
She smiled with a snort.  “Well, as a Head of House, dancing around the common room with your students is your solemn duty.”  She said it so seriously that he began to panic that it
Potter took off like a shot, and it took all of Draco’s skill to maneuver up next to him, despite their similar speed.  The man threw an elbow, and he elbowed back – but both refused to give up the narrow line of the most direct path towards their goal.
DRACO: [aside] I’ve done the best I can, and it all comes down to the bake.  If that’s not enough, then I don’t know what I could’ve done better.  [He pauses, then a frown overtakes his face.]  Well, maybe I could’ve chilled the dough a few more minutes.  I did 1 hour and 47 minutes, when I really wanted to do 2 full hours, but Potter had already taken his out, and I figured I’d need the extra 13 minutes at the end to plate them, which is probably more important that the slight texture difference would be… But now I don’t know.  I just don’t know.
Draco held his breath as his middle finger traced a circle upon Harry’s rim.  He had never done anything like this – he had no guide beyond the intensity in Harry’s eyes.  But, somehow, he was saved the self-consciousness by the fact that this felt so utterly
SEAMUS: No – not again!  [His eyebrows are singed, and the soot on his face gives him the singular appearance of an old-timey chimney sweep.]  Me mum will kill me for this…
me.  Do you have any idea how long I’ve been like this?”  He gestured frantically to his trousers, where there was a distinctive bulge in the fabric.
With effort, he extracted himself from Roddy’s grip and walked, even-paced, down the hall.  He refused to be escorted around what had once been his own home.  He had moved past the boy who hesitated on the doorstep, unsure of whether or not he should knock – now, if they called him here, they should bloody well be ready when he came.
Her lips flattened.  “In any case, I’m glad to see that you’re well – and not downed with some wasting-disease that prevents you from holding a quill.  Your father and I have been worried-”
“Aggression,” Harry finished with a glare, ignoring Draco’s incredulous grin.  “So we were always a little ridiculous when we came together – you would drive me into grandiose fights that I wouldn’t otherwise pick, and I would make you throw dramatic temper tantrums when you lost.”
AMOS: I just wanted to say how proud I am of my boy.  I’ve always told him to follow his dreams and that he’d be the best at whatever he chose, and it’s so gratifying to see that that’s absolutely the case.  [tearing up] My Cedric is the best boy in the whole world, and he’s going to win it for sure!  In fact, he’s already beaten that Harry Potter in multiple school-level bake-offs – let me tell you about the time he won with a fried banana torte with bourbon-reduced caramel-
But today, though currently embroiled in a focus-necessitating potion, Draco couldn’t help but lament his current situation once more.  When would Potter come around – if ever?  How long should he tiptoe around the man to give him space before it became ridiculous?  Frankly, it
…could he?  He knew the theory already – not that it had helped.  What would make it different this time?
The man was sprawled lazily in his chair, and though Draco couldn’t see his face clearly, he knew it bore a smile.
Draco managed to extract himself from the conversation shortly thereafter with a hastened eating regiment and swearing off of dessert.  The food was lovely – as usual – but he still left the Great Hall with a bad taste in his mouth.
towards Potter was based in something other than hatred and mistrust.  Something else entirely.  But Potter seemed to have gone through no such transformation.
CEDRIC: She is!  I’m going to present it to her right after we’re done.  So I’m hoping to do so as winner.
“You like that, huh?”  Draco drew away from his ear to get a better view of the man pinned down on the desk beneath him.  “I always knew you’d be filthy.”
“Like you will also be doing?” Draco asked, mostly to cover the tremor in his grip as he handed it over to Gloria.
in order to complete this questioning, or do you forfeit your opportunity to resolve your sentence at today’s meeting?”
But the sight was also comforting – it brought back warm memories of prepping before a gala, back when they were reputable enough to hold such events.  Lucius had always found her preening frivolous, despite his own meticulous ministrations, and so she’d usher him out rebelliously and continue to decorate herself while chatting with Draco.
Harry pulled himself slowly to his feet, eyes never leaving Draco’s.  When it seemed his legs were no longer in danger of giving out from all the kneeling, he whispered “Yes.”  Softly, as if this didn’t shake Draco’s entire world.  As if it was something he, too, desired, and not a mere indulgence for Draco’s benefit.
“How’s the soup today, Malfoy?” he often asked.  “As fine as the summer gas-patchos you’re used to?”
Draco dove in anyway.  “In fact, I never thanked you for coming to testify at my trial.  I…I don’t think I appreciated it as much at the time, but I can see how you saved me a much more painful sentence.”  Which was, well, the understatement of the century – but it needed to be said, nonetheless.
.  Like, unexpectedly put-together, between the makeup and the haircut.  She’d dressed him in a black button-up – just a few buttons shy of what he’d normally do – and a simple, metal dragon necklace she’d gotten from Charlie at Christmas.
Harry sucked in a sharp breath and bit his lip like it was the hardest question he’d ever been asked.  “Just keep…keep doing what you’re doing,” he managed at last, letting out another little groan.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly.  The words sounded trite and insignificant in the heavy grief of the room.
“Oh.”  Slowly, as if defusing a bomb, he extricated himself from the man and stepped back, face absolutely burning.  He needed to leave.

“Everything,” Harry asserted, a blush rising in his cheeks, but powering on nonetheless.  “I want to get to know you better.”
Draco knew he should step away, that he was saying too much with both his words and his eyes – and if anyone was watching this, he’d get fired in a heartbeat.  But he simply couldn’t drag himself away.  That
Harry shook his head, settling back between Draco’s thighs.  “Just tell me what feels good,” he insisted, before taking him nearly to the base.
They had always found things to clash over – only, with time, Draco had come to acknowledge the force driving
“You’re right; I wasn’t funny.  Took me forever to realize though, since cronies were always laughing at my jokes anyway.”  He raised an eyebrow at her, genuinely curious by her honesty.  “Why are you talking to me, Hannah?”
from Draco.  I want to see some originality from him that transcends his father’s dishes.  He has the potential – but whether he’ll use it or not is up to him.
Things have been crazy, and I'm moving on top of everything, so I apologize for my slow-ish timeline in putting out new chapters (I just haven't had a chance to write anything new for this story in over a month, so I'm terribly behind).  Also, I ended up modding a FEST!  So if that's something that interests you, definitely check out the

, about flying.  He’d missed it – there had been no cause, nor any company to fly with, since the war, and he now regretted that.  Flying was baptizing; flying was dauntless.
He tugged apart Harry’s cheeks, and the man’s body lurched in his hands as the sensitivity caused an involuntary reaction.  With the help of the spell, Draco sunk a finger deep and messily into his arse.

“Are you ashamed to be seen with me?” Draco asked straight out, because he didn’t think he could bear dancing around it any longer.  Then, “I would understand if you are.”
When the man was suitably duped by his compliance, Draco veered into his secondary tactic: he swept the room performatively with his gaze in an act to involve the audience.  “A bit personal of a question to ask in a sweet shop, don’t you think?”
becoming ridiculous, and Draco wanted nothing more than to return to their game of pranks, if that was the only capacity Potter was willing to engage him in.

FRED: Five minutes, bakers!  Five minutes until your final showstopper must be completed at the end of your bench!
Malfoy, cheeks pink despite the daring expression on his face, had the gall to sniff and wave him off with exasperation.  “I knew from the first minute!  You think I can’t use a computer, just like you?”
But Hannah’s face softened a degree, and she patted him on the back with an air of amused sympathy.  “There, there.  I’m sure he’ll come around.  It’s not like he’s forgotten you.”
Father snorted at her question, and Draco braced himself for the inevitable rant that was to follow.  “Come now, Narcissa.  How do you
you read it.  And I honestly never thought you’d be interested.  So I let it get a bit…imaginative.”
“Merlin, I hope so,” Harry breathed.  “Otherwise, I’ve just given myself the appearance of someone having the weirdest, week-long mid-life crisis in history.”
Harry stared back at him, panting – matching Draco breath for breath.  Then, his knees wobbled, and he grabbed onto Draco’s shoulder for support.
All of a sudden, Harry pulled back, voice coming fast and clumsy.  “I have to go… Ron and Hermione-”
Draco paused, a feral smirk curving his lips.  He couldn’t contain it if he tried.  “Absolutely,” he purred.  “I’m surprised you noticed.”  He began kissing his way down Harry’s neck, marking his path with a destructive, flushed line.  Harry arched into his touch, head lolling to the side so Draco could devour him.
, and if he wasn’t Britain’s favorite orphan baker, then he wouldn’t have even made it onto this show in the first place.
to mean something, didn’t it?  He felt like Eve, eating the apple of knowledge and then seeking every possible flavor of fruit for comparison.  He felt empowered; he felt frustrated.  He felt…dizzy.
He was halfway through contemplating a quick escape to the loo to relieve himself when Harry looked up through his lashes at him and patted the bed beside him.  “Lay with me?”
– Harry crashed his face against Draco’s trousers and managed to tear the zipper down after several tries.  His snapping jaw reminded Draco of a wolf, and he chuckled at the image until he was startled to silence by Harry tugging his pants down and exposing him fully to the air.
Draco snorted, relaxing a fraction as he saw which way this was headed.  “Well, how’d you expect us to act?”
“Mister Malfoy!” she exclaimed after taking a step back to avoid collision.  “I’ve been hoping to run into you, actually.”
Draco went from adrenaline to a different kind of energy as he surveyed his boyfriend’s messy desperation.  He swallowed.  “Yes, that’s all very well and good – I’m
.”  The boy’s voice was hesitant – too hesitant to be speaking of anything other than a sensitive subject.  And, as someone who’d felt the weight of restraining such questions in such tones, Draco knew immediately why the boy had come.
GEORGE: The judging was especially hard this round, seeing what’s resting upon it, but after careful consideration, the judges have decided that this round’s champion will be…
Harry considered the question for a long minute.  “Yes,” he said at last, “but…maybe not right away.”
For someone who had spoken only to Morpheus for months, the amount of questions was dizzying.  “I…er… Just getting a drink, I s’pose.”  He cursed how unsure he sounded.  He hadn’t always sounded like that.
But after everything, he was pleasantly surprised to find that he still enjoyed flying.  Sitting up on a broom in the sky, gazing across the green of the pitch and the dense foliage of the Forbidden Forest – really, there was nothing like it.  And the air, while crisp, still had yet to settle into those bitterly cold Scottish overtones.
Harry blushed and looked towards the floor. “Thanks.” He sat down, his khakis visibly tighter around his hot salami.

Unease weighed on him.  While Grant’s prediction didn’t come true right away, Draco remained on edge for every game he played thereafter.  And since they were almost every day, he found himself high strung and exhausted as the weeks blurred into months.
“Yeah, you…” he struggled for inspiration, trying to temper the breathy quality of his voice, “you haven’t come in to chat like this in a while, so I wasn’t really expecting-”
He pumped, earning a moan from them both, and Harry weaseled his hands so they were gripping Draco’s arse.  He panted as he worked them closer to the edge, shuddering at the feel of Harry’s rigid length against his, the sight alone nearly undoing him.
“Malfoy, you can’t go!  We were about to play Truth or Hex!” Fenn pouted – she was looking a bit drunker than she had earlier, and he wanted to laugh at how her sober self would hate her acting this way.
Harry scratched at the back of his head, looking slightly embarrassed to be explaining this.  “Yeah, I mean, it was stuck between Gryffindor and Slytherin for me, so I asked it to put me in Gryffindor.  I was told that happens sometimes.”
dramatically).  “Of course you didn’t.  It’s only the universal expectation for the best man at any wedding.”  Harry smacked him lightly with the hand that had been caressing his face.  “
In his peripherals, Draco caught Potter watching him as he tugged off his sweaty shirt.  Though he hid it well, the thought made him squirm with excitement.
“Fuck, Harry…”  He tried to swallow away the huskiness in his voice, but when he continued, it was still just as wretched.  “Much longer than you.  Don’t make me say it.”
With absolutely no warning, Harry shot to a sitting position and exclaimed, “Fuck!  You haven’t come yet, have you?”  He reached despairingly for Draco’s trousers, but Draco intercepted his hands along the way.
Draco hadn’t thought it possible for Potter’s cheeks to grow any brighter, but to his delight, they did just that.  And he laughed outright when Potter glanced away, unable to maintain the heated eye contact.
Draco fought to remain serious as Harry’s outrageous impression of his father threatened to drag him, too, into this hysteria.  Not to mention that that scenario didn’t sound far off.
They did end up discussing Quidditch – but not until much later, and after several cups of tea.  The pitch had to be double-checked for safety, so they strolled its circumference together, making light conversation as they tested the stability of the structures and the anti-jinxing wards.
His mother paused for a moment, then proceeded to set her cup and saucer on the coffee table before returning her hands, folded, to her lap.  She was suddenly very still.  “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about, Draco.”
After another minute, Potter burst through the canopy of leaves with a smattering of scratches and stray sticks in his hair.
The question snapped him back to attention.  Pity was the last thing he needed now.  “Why wouldn’t I be alright?”
“Why is this website all random pictures?” he murmured, watching the images move up and disappear as he scrolled.  The amount of information on this thing really
“Wait!  Potter-” Draco caught the door from closing, but only at the sacrifice of his foot.  He bit back a wince as the man gave the knob another hard yank.  “Hold on, just listen!”
Draco wondered.  It was likely too revealing – the fall had knocked some of his usual mental barriers away, and it was terribly hard to keep these feelings locked away all the time.  Perhaps Potter could sense their intensity through eye contact alone.
.  Why wouldn’t I be?”  His scowl deepened, and he was unable to stop himself from asking, “By the way, what
Draco sighed.  He knew it was not quite what he’d asked, but he wouldn’t press – at least not for now.  “Yes, well, since we both know that’s not going to happen, we might as well make the most of it.  For example, I’m learning all sorts of new things about you – like how you ‘
He met Harry’s confused eyes with a defiant glare until Harry wilted under the pressure.  “Okay,” he said, clearing his throat, “well…well, regardless – I still feel bad about what Sam’s going through, so I hope I can find something to make it better for him.  If that doesn’t offend your
Graddlethorn hummed in thought, before eventually smacking the desk as if making a decision.  “Okay.  Here’s the thing, Mister Malfoy: it was a messy situation.  Does it sound like you had a good reason for doing what you did?  Yes.  But can I prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt?  No – I can’t.”
He tugged a tailcoat off its hanger forlornly.  There had been no occasion to wear this one lately – perhaps he could swing it for “spooky formal?”  The theme was a little vague.  Had it been “black tie with a macabre twist” or “costume party,” he would’ve known what he was dealing with – but, as it stood, he could hardly tell whether he was supposed to go as himself or not.
Without waiting for an answer, he hauled Harry to his feet, pressing a kiss that was mostly teeth to his mouth.  He backed him up until Harry knocked into the desk.
“Good,” she responded gratefully – perhaps surprised at his civility.  “I’m cleaning the grounds for winter, though it will take some time before I can set up the lights.”
He smiled crookedly in response.  “When I encounter something I don’t know a lot about, I find I can’t usually let it go until I do.”
from his mind in order to focus on keeping his students in the air.  Several had choppy starts, and he had to help a few of the boys with lift-off and encourage one of the meeker girls to float higher than two feet off the ground.  There were always a few in each class that couldn’t handle heights.
Thanks so much for reading chapter 1! Like I mentioned in the end notes of my TNFI epilogue, I will not be updating this story on a weekly basis like before, but I'll try to update every 2 or 3 weeks (and maybe go back to weekly if I build up enough of a head start). I've also had a lot of fun writing shorter pieces the past few weeks, so I want to leave time for myself to work on these and refresh my interest in continuing. (If you haven't checked my other stuff out - please do! I've got some ferret!Draco, some crack with Ron, some scooby-doo inspired shenanigans, a literal rewrite of The Raven along Drarry themes, and a more serious piece about Professor Burbage haunting Draco.)
,” he cast.  The sleeping bat multiplied to about thirty before he drew his wand away.  He closed the door softly and locked it with a flick.  Musing that he’d gotten a lot of use out of the doubling charm of late, Draco couldn’t help but remember his mother’s amusement when he’d shown talent for it as a child.
“I’m sorry, really.  I know it’s not funny, but-” Harry tried – and failed – to suppress a laugh, “I can just see him turning his nose up at the package and dropping it on the ground like he’d touched something awful and going ‘From the Weasleys?
"Come on, snake—let’s rattle.”  Malfoy stepped into Harry’s personal space with the singular confidence of someone issuing a challenge they knew they would win.  His lips were quirked into that infuriating grin of his, the one he leveled at Harry whenever he botched a drill in training; the one that made him want to punch Malfoy in the face.  Which he should have been doing now, except…
Draco turned at the call and saw Kat standing there, locks fashioned into snakes that undulated gently in greeting.  Her makeup was ghastly – green and decaying around blazing red eyes that had been spelled for effect.  Beside her, Marla had her hair pinned up and was sporting a Grecian warrior costume that he could only assume was for Perseus.
business,” Draco managed, but only just.  He was on the edge of moaning pitifully for Harry already.  “Now shut up and suck my dick.”
Harry stopped again, his face blazing.  “What, is this your fantasy or something?  This shit goes on for four more pages!”
He winced, though it was fair.  And despite himself, he felt charmed enough by her treating him like a normal former classmate and not some odious monster, that he felt himself relaxing into casual humor himself.
Harry complied, and Draco caught his chin lightly in his hand to position it.  He was struck with a flash of holding Harry’s chin in a very different context not too long ago, and he swallowed dryly as he tipped the two drops into Harry’s open mouth.
about arguing with him.  Teasing him again felt like a missing piece of his soul had returned, and he suddenly felt whole.  What good was a job when he had no life left to support?
Morpheus’ pupils dilated, and Draco felt himself sinking into them.  His mind focusing on contracting and weaseling into those twin gateways.  There was resistance, but it was weak – broken apart by chaos and fearful thoughts.
The worst effect of finals week, however, was neither the students’ behavior nor the other teacher’s distress – it was Harry’s constant occupation with things other than Draco.  Harry worked from morning to night designing, then editing, exams for his classes.  He worked until his wrist was worn out – which Draco thought would be the natural end to his martyrdom before Harry showed up in an herbal splint that allowed him to write for several more hours until Draco forcibly put him to bed.  Which was a thing he needed to do now, apparently.
In addition to the added stresses of the Halloween Ball events, Draco had also received a few letters from his mother lately, that he’d begrudgingly forced himself to open.  She had apologized – through long-winded excuses, mostly – and implored him to meet with her soon.  Though he felt he’d really rather ingest a burning barrel of bees than do so, Draco wrote back in the affirmative, convinced that she would only become more vehement if he refused.
Draco sighed, letting his irritation – which was really just nerves – drain away.  “Yes, I think that’s fair.”  He pulled his knee pads from the locker and began clipping them on with speed, as he realized it was almost time to go out there.  “Hey, pass me my goggles.”
mean to you!  [MINERVA looks vaguely surprised by the reminder that other holidays exist beyond a good Scottish Christmas, and it cuts to a well-timed shot of Jewish cultural ambassador HARRY rolling his eyes.]  You have four hours, bakers!  On your mark-
It was hard and rushed and messy, but the man poured his whole self into it – all the cockiness and tentativeness and good-graced humor that he’d developed somewhere along the way.  Harry felt
The first elf, a drippy looking fellow with dangly ears, gave him a suspicious look.  “Yes.  We is having made Mister Potter’s meal just now, and is about to send it to him.  Why do you ask?”
Harry looked strangely out of his depth as he gestured for him to continue, and Draco was eager enough to get this over with that he did without any teasing.  “So I got sentenced to eighteen months without using any magic,” he said, trying to keep the bitterness from his voice.  “I lived at home for a while to sort out my mess of a family…  That turned out to be a horrible mistake.”
Harry peeked at Hermione before answering.  “It went…really well.  Like, he offered to tutor me in math!”
He wouldn’t go to dueling club, he decided.  If the first meeting was tonight and Potter hadn’t even bothered to
Harry’s cock was gorgeous – thick and dark and flushed, now stuttering in his grip.  But his gaze kept getting drawn back to Harry’s lips.  Slightly parted, air hissing out between his teeth.  His eyes, fathomless depths; a dusky emerald gone black.
The impact was a blur of green and scratches.  When the dizziness faded, he pushed himself up into a sitting position, eyes focusing blearily on Potter as he landed gracefully to his right.
Draco had heard of the Green Flash – even confined to the shop as he’d been.  It had come out only two months ago, and like its namesake, was supposedly so fast you'd never catch it.  Like the flash of green light emitted from the sun setting over water.
[Everyone claps, some more begrudgingly than others.  As VOLDEMORT and MINERVA go over to congratulate CEDRIC, we see HARRY glancing sheepishly at DRACO.  DRACO ignores him, and when it seems he’s about to break the silence and get his attention, DRACO stands up and leaves.]
Harry looked up at him and sighed again, more wretchedly this time.  “It’s just… I can’t even imagine it, you know?  Like, he’s realizing all this at age
“No – what did you say?  I couldn’t hear you.”  He gestured towards the boombox that was breaking into the cheery beginning lines of “In the Navy,” which were considerably gayer than he remembered.
CEDRIC: [sips from a cup of tea] It’s all going splendidly!  I’m just grinding up my pesto now.  [He gives the food processor a whirl for a second, then smiles conspiratorially up at the camera.]  I know Voldemort isn’t crazy about basil, but I’m hoping my recipe convinces him.
He languished over how he could add a “spooky” element without ruining the integrity of his outfit and eventually settled on fangs.  They were unobtrusive and simple spellwork, which was what made them a cliché, but Draco wasn’t overly concerned with his originality tonight.  His goal was to seduce Potter – not win a Gryffindorian costume contest.
Harry stilled, perplexity overcoming him in a sudden, all-encompassing wave.  “What do you mean?  You said, ‘come on snake, let’s rattle’—”
“Which brings me to another point,” he said, stepping forward into Potter’s space and smiling when the man’s back hit the wall.  “Why have you been acting
He saw multiple zombies, a few fake dementors, Veela-inspired costumes with vast, transfigured wings – even a first-year girl dressed up like Ginevra Weasley, complete with her Holyhead Harpies uniform.  That one irked him a little, as a twinge of jealousy surged through him at the name.
They clamored up the stairs, and Harry paused dazedly as Draco cleared the path of ghouls (mainly with some smartly placed lights and cleaning spells).  He considered stopping once they’d reached the common room, then decided against it when he remembered students could pop in anytime.
The feast began, and he kept his gaze fixed forward, refusing to look at Potter beside him.  By the sounds he was making though, he was gobbling food like an animal.  His knife scraped noisily along his plate, and he seemed to choke on his drink for a second before gulping it down.
Dueling club came and passed on its typical Tuesday.  And while it was entertaining to bait both Flitwick and Harry in one sitting, Draco found that it was no longer enough to satisfy him.  The heated looks Harry had given him when they’d made overtures at dueling left him hot and uncomfortable for the remainder of the practice.
Draco fumed and cast his thoughts in futile circles as he geared up to help some kids with Quidditch practice.  It was a pair of second-year girls from Slytherin who likely wouldn’t make the team due to their age, but they had come up to him after breakfast this morning and asked, so he had agreed to help them out.  He recognized them vaguely from Potter’s class yesterday.
Draco drew in a deep breath, squared his shoulders a bit, then ran a hand through his hair before nodding.  “I’m ready,” he said before stepping into the flames.
Even as the old fantasies flowed back into his brain, so too did the darker desires.  The ancient, confused ones – ones that toed the line between pleasurable pain and vindictiveness; how, in some, he’d once wanted to hurt Harry for real.
He lurched forward, pressing desperate kisses to Harry’s mouth as he rode out the most intense throes of climax.  He heard himself moaning Harry’s name, twitching the last of it from his system before he could finally get a grip.
“You as well, Harry.  In a ‘charming urchin’ kind of way,” he quipped. It was far too early in the date to be getting
, to assume that Harry could teach him to do it any better.  Especially now that he was still in shock and grief about his father.  He could hardly summon logic at a time like this, let alone
The others followed soon thereafter, several needing a few tries to get it through a hoop – some needing to fly up right in front of it.  But soon enough, everyone was onto the next phase and looping around each of the House towers in the stands on their way to the tall tree by the pitch.  There, they had to toss the quaffle through a magical, hovering ring that Draco had spelled to blaze purple when they got it successfully through.  Then, it would release one of the rain orbs that he’d stuck inextricably in the branches with magic.
VOLDEMORT: It’s good that you used fresh – the extract would’ve been too strong for this kind of delicate cream.  Very nice bake.
The blood that had pumped so furiously through him in the past few minutes seemed to freeze all at once.  The broom –
– you can give me that guarantee, I will process your sentence completion and release your wand to you.
He wasn’t sure what his face was doing, but he was quite sure it was doing a poor job of masking the pain.
He supposed he should look away – brush him off, break the silence.  Something to distract from the longing in his gaze.  But, in this moment, he couldn’t bring himself to care about that either.  He looked and looked his fill.
But Harry was going wild.  Unable to keep up the deep-throating at this heightened pace, he had drawn back for shallower thrusts, but wrapped his fist over the remaining length to pump.
, Draco glanced down sharply when Harry leaned across his lap to pick up the goggles from the bench.  Harry smiled coyly.
“Yeah, no.  You’re really not.”  The bluntness startled a gasp of surprise from Harry, and Draco kind of wanted to give Sam a handshake for his daring.
“Let’s get you out of those soiled clothes,” the man whispered, sending a shiver up Harry’s neck.  Up close, he could see the water droplets clinging to those long, blond lashes.  He hovered closer, so Draco’s next words were against his lips.
Something about seeing the Malfoy signet ring in Harry’s curious grip felt both startling and significant.  Harry rolled it between his fingers, viewing the inscriptions from every side.  He leaned in close, and for some reason the inspection felt as intimate as the man viewing his naked body.
Draco started his lesson while a miffed Potter stormed off – once again – to change, and he tried his best to purge thoughts of
Draco’s eyes lingered there, over the rough bob of his throat, and by the time his gaze hit upon Potter’s face, he was startled out of his reverie by two things: the man had slightly protruding fangs, and he wasn’t

He had also fixed up his office, pleasantly surprised that he had been given one, even though he was only a flying instructor.  It wasn’t a

to know this was real.  That it wasn’t a part of their game.  Not another prank to bring him down.  “Please tell me you’re not kidding.”
The first two teams were neck and neck as they flew, mini-rain showers drenching them as they went.  The boy in first gritted his teeth, and Draco laughed aloud at how seriously they were all taking it – how seriously
As predicted, the man spun around angrily, color high on his face, only to be stunned into silence by the sight of Draco in only his pants before him.
.” The description was so astonishing – coming from Harry of all people – that he took another second to blink in confusion.  “Not in a bad way!” Harry assured, misinterpreting his silence.
It was unheard of.  The man had never had a cold in his life; to suddenly be so seriously damaged that Mother would speak of changing the will-
He took stock of her posture, hunched with the burden of regrettable decisions, and wished more than anything that he could do something for her.  If he were Harry Potter, this would be the time to claim, “I’ll save you” – or something equally brash.  But Draco wasn’t Potter, and looking into Gloria’s eyes, he had seen that she knew all that.  They
It made him furious.  But at least when he was angry, he could push down the welling sense of embarrassment at being forced to dance with Malfoy, then discovering that no one was forcing him but himself.
The scarred man – Grant – flicked his eyes between Bagman and Draco, hardened amusement playing around his lips.  “Are you then?  Scared?  This isn’t a game for the faint-hearted.”  He huffed a laugh, taking another deep swig of his drink.
His mother stiffened slightly beside him, and the judge lowered her question list to meet his eyes.  Suddenly, her “wearied office-worker” façade melted away and revealed a sharp focus that was characteristic of rare competence in a judge.

But Harry wouldn’t let him descend into self-loathing.  He pulled him tight, black curls whispering across Draco’s cheeks.
At his continued silence, Harry babbled on.  “Draco’s been doing really well at teaching too!  Probably better than me, to be honest.”
,” he managed, once humor seemed possible once again.  He began walking towards the locker rooms as he spoke, Potter following.   Draco filed the angry thoughts away in the drawers of his mind – as was his habit in Occluding.
Harry sobered slightly, despite the teasing tone.  They were still far enough away from the other 8th years that he wasn’t worried about being overheard – not with all the caterwauling over ‘who was cheating who’ at Exploding Snap – but as his eyes caught on Malfoy, he couldn’t help but shiver at the mixture of emotions that ran through him.
Harry pulled him towards the bed, sitting on the edge and tugging Draco down gently on top of him once Draco had kicked off the trousers and shoes tangled at his feet.  He whispered the cleaning and lubrication charms in a rush, then tossed his wand onto the floor behind him.  Why had he still been holding it?
“Dying?”  He met Harry’s gaze to show it was okay.  He wasn’t going to fall apart again – not today, at least.  “In a manner of speaking, yes.”  Harry looked even more confused by that, so he clarified: “He
, the nasty voice whispered in his head.  He shook the thought away.  Dwelling on dueling club was definitely not how he wanted to spend yet another afternoon.  He’d been so distracted yesterday at Quidditch try-outs, that he’d barely noticed when Kat and Marla had been selected as the beaters for Slytherin team, despite their young age.  Then, of course, he’d leapt into action congratulating them.
“Alright, I’ll bite.”  He leaned back a bit to survey Harry in that way he knew put him on edge.  “But you need to tell me
It just wasn’t that easy to let go.  On the fourth day since their nocturnal argument, Draco decided to go see Potter in his office.  He’d grown weary of interrogating himself, and he’d be damned if he let the man slip away on some terrible misunderstanding.  So, after dinner, he hoofed it up to Gryffindor tower before he could psyche himself out.
His tone was lukewarm and unmistakably displeased, but Draco – knowing now that this was unavoidable – plastered a smile on his face before turning.  “Mister Flume.”  He offered a hand.  “How
But by that point, Sam was lingering by the door.  “Well, I didn’t know you had company, so I won’t stay and intrude anymore.  But thanks, Professor.  It did make me feel better about all this.”  He reached for the door handle then hesitated.  In a nervous twitch, he fiddled with his sleeve.  “You won’t…mention this to anyone, right?  I know it’s not good to keep it a secret forever, but for right now…”
The thought of Harry sent a flare of pain through his chest as he remembered this morning, and he sobered as he followed the students at a chaperoning distance.
“Is this about Kat?”  At her silence, he continued, “I’m sorry about Halloween.  I realize I never apologized for comments – I… I made too many assumptions, and I’m sorry if that made things weird between you two.”  He didn’t
When he entered the pub this time, he looked around immediately for Bagman.  For a few terrible moments, he thought he’d been set up, until he noticed the jolly man mingling with the people in Quidditch leathers near the back.  He hesitated a moment before joining them.
“Oh, I think I remember now.”  Draco smirked as he leaned in, ghosting his lips over Harry’s ear.  “I was about to tell you all the things I’m going to do to you with
Not to mention the amount of grinning and gazing that happened tonight over dinner.  It’s evident that something is going on.”
“Fuck, Harry,” he whispered, unable to remain silent any longer.  It was too much.  Too perfect.  Too
“Potter,” he greeted, unable to stop the smirk that stole so effortlessly across his face at the other man’s appearance.  “What in Merlin’s name are you wearing?”
Draco laughed, drawing Harry flush against him.  “All the more reason, then.”  He dipped his head for a kiss, jarred from the softness of the moment when Harry drew away before they could connect.
“It is serious business, and I’m a serious teacher.” Harry furrowed his brows so tightly he could roll a thin strand of pasta between them.
She looked up at him gratefully, then hefted her school-issued Nimbus 2001.  “Thanks.  I will.”  She sounded a little shaky, like the confession had affected her more than she pretended.
He gave Harry’s knee a quick squeeze and then released.  “But that can wait,” he said, hoping it came out teasing instead of terribly unsteady.
Okay, so perhaps Potter wasn’t that interested.  After all, he had done his best to avoid Draco at every subsequent meal, proving that the Sorting feast had merely been a fluke.  He had even taken to dodging him in the halls – turning around and dashing in the other direction whenever he caught sight of him.
Draco rolled his eyes – Harry had used the former password only this morning, so he knew she had changed it to mess with him.  He wondered, not for the first time, whether McGonagall was actually as Gryffindor as he’d thought.  “My apologies.  I wasn’t informed the passwords were
CEDRIC: [confessional aside] Of course I’m excited!  Getting first in the technical is nothing to sneeze at.  I was just lucky they chose a recipe I happen to bake a lot for the Granny Club; that’s all it is.  It had nothing to do with ‘besting’ anyone.  My fellow bakers are equally talented – they just had a bit of a rough day.
“You just stole the title from someone else, like you swindled them out of a store,” he continued, not even caring for an answer.  That wasn’t what mattered here.  “And once you realized it was hard to keep clients without good quality potions, you feared you’d have to close.  Which would’ve ended things.  But then,
Harry swallowed, a shaky jump of his Adam’s apple that Draco tracked with avid interest.  Harry forced out one more sentence: “I’d like you to punish me for it.”
The next time his eyes drifted open, Harry was looking at him almost expectantly.  He started, realizing that Harry had nearly fucked him out of his role.
He had unpacked his bags, putting away the clothes and books he had brought, but that had been all.  After all, it wasn’t like he owned much these days, after being cut off from the estate.  But it was enough to make the room look his own, and the green glow of the lake through his porthole window calmed him.  Some minnows drifted by, casting small shadows on the chair.
Potter at least.  This one was malignant and rotten, and smiled at him from beneath glowing red eyes.  Eyes whose pupils narrowed to serpentine slits.
VOICE-OVER: Draco’s family, owners and founders of Malfoy Inc., have provided quality chefs and service to their fourteen hotel restaurant locations for going on two decades.  Draco’s mother, Narcissa, oversees logistics and budgeting, while his father, Lucius, manages the customer experience division.  He also serves on the board of trustees for Hogwarts Culinary Institute, leading him to recommend that Draco go there to further his studies before joining the family business in a more formal capacity.  Draco, now a junior at Hogwarts, spends all of his free time baking and testing out new recipes.

Even with his personal chambers not too far from his office, he risked running into students, which was completely out of the question.  And speaking of students, they could stop by his office at any time as well – though he sincerely doubted they would.  Who needed to talk to the flight instructor after hours?  But the longer he sat here with a boner, the higher the chances of someone happening upon him, and-
“You want me to touch you?” Harry asked quite suddenly – and if Draco hadn’t been leaning against a desk, he was fairly certain his legs would’ve given out from under him.
to the git, just because he stepped in at my moment of need.  It’s not like…  I mean, he was already done with his, wasn’t he?  Sure, it looked a little unfinished, and he could’ve probably used those last few minutes to put final touches on his showstopper, but…  Oh *
Harry’s eyes had been trained on his orange bowtie for a while, and Draco vowed he’d wear it every day if it had such power to capture his attention.  When he glanced up to meet his eyes, his gaze was guarded, but hopeful nonetheless.
Indignant thoughts like these were what filled his head as he decided to up the ante.  Without thinking it out any further, Harry grabbed Malfoy by the front of the jumper and hauled him into a kiss.
Everyone fell quiet for a moment.  Taking this chance, Roddy stepped hesitantly up to the table, floating a tureen of soup behind him.  “Er, Roddy is not meaning to interrupt, but the next course is being ready.”  He winced like he expected one of them to upend it over his head.  Draco wondered, with vague horror, whether that was something his father did while he was away.
But if so, they’d be taking him to Azkaban.  He was sure of it, and the thought sent a spike of adrenaline through him - morphing guilt into panic, regret into fear.  If he went there, he would die.  And despite the pain and loss he had experienced the past few years, he was not ready to die.
Harry chose this moment to pull back and smile, lazy and smug as he asked, “Are you sure you want me to leave?”
“Yes, yes – we’re incapable of thinking even the mildest malicious thought,” she quipped, rolling her eyes heavily.  “We couldn’t squash an ant if it crawled right under our shoe!  But, anyway – how did she trick you?”
The man’s smirk only grew wider, which Draco corrected with a well-placed pinch.  Harry sucked in a sharp breath, which quickly faded into a groan.
Draco drew in a ragged breath.  “Every time I think I have you cornered, you always surprise me,” he murmured, dragging a thumb across Harry’s bottom lip.  And he did – Draco was constantly surprised any time he looked down to find his hands upon this man without the world crashing down.  Without Harry pushing him away out of principle.  Someday, Harry might even surprise him with loving him back – though the simple thought made his chest tight with ill-advised hope.
Draco arrived at The White Wyvern the following week with great apprehension.  It was just past nightfall, and he wasn’t sure what to expect – though, he’d brought his Quidditch leathers as requested.  He’d had to write home for them, which had been an ordeal in and of itself.
Instead of snapping back, however, Harry simply parked his quill in his inkwell and sat back to offer his full attention.  It made Draco feel even more insufficient and small.
Faces and places flashed by as he rifled.  The secret, he’d learned, was aiming his mind at the cluster that felt most protected; that was where he’d find what he was looking for.  He forced his consciousness forward, bashing through the outer layers of defense, and-
Instead of egging him on like Draco had hoped though, Potter seemed to jolt back to reality.  His eyes widened slightly, and he scrambled backwards quickly – breaking the implicit magnetism of their ever-closing distance.  While this time they held no fear, guilt shone brightly in those eyes.
FRED: [confessional aside, shot outside the tent] I actually slipped a Go-Pro into Harry’s apron when he was home last week, so we have some exemplary footage from Hogwarts to share in order to shed light on Harry and Draco’s school rivalry.
He continued.  “I mean, he hasn’t been coming to the Great Hall for meals for over two weeks now, but I talked to the elves last night, and they told me he’d been refusing meals for the past two days.  I figured I should say something.”
“I think I remember you telling me that Muggle fashion would only send confusing signals to him,” Harry quipped, grinning at her reflection before glancing at his own and being startled all over again at how different he looked.
“I always knew I’d have you down on your knees for me someday, Potter,” he continued, as if he had never stopped.  He tugged sharply on Harry’s fringe again to feel the vibrations of his groan.  “Used to imagine it during Potions class.”
In the end, however, the saving grace had been Granger’s reliable penchant for literacy (a trait unlikely to be replicated in either of their other companions).  She’d started a tentative conversation about Potions texts, and that had somehow evolved into a full-on theoretical discussion summarizing all the major advancements in the field in the past two hundred years.
The girls looked at them with wide eyes before hurrying along their way, and Harry took that moment to straighten his jacket and clear his throat loudly before facing him.  “Err, should we go in, then?”
Draco finally let his eyes jump to Gloria’s, which he knew had been seeking his the entire time.  She looked frightened and exhausted and…resigned.  At a slight shake of her head, he relaxed his grip on his wand.
Something like relief shone in those green eyes, and it struck Draco that he had set the bar extraordinarily low for himself if him complying with common decency was so utterly surprising.  For possibly the first time, he found himself vowing that’d he’d try to be less of a prick – though, it was hard when Potter had that unique way of getting under his skin.
Flipping to the relationships section, he paged past the part on Ginevra.  His heart clenched pitifully when he realized that Potter was, in all likelihood,
Potter drew his wand and dropped into the shallowest bow he’d ever seen – more of a nod, really – and Draco returned it with disdain.  Flitwick was shuffling discontentedly in the background, but neither took any notice.
But she laughed at his boldness.  “I can’t say.  You’ll have to figure that out on your own, loverboy.”
Draco stilled, remembering his own nightmarish memories from seventh year.  The easy boredom from his younger years had been thoroughly stamped out by the Carrows.  And, as a Malfoy and a Death Eater, they’d made him do terrible things.
He raised an eyebrow and surveyed the class.  “Are we all good with that?  Doing another relay race?”  Most of the heads nodded – some furiously – but no one seemed bothered by the idea, so Draco relented.  “Very well.  But you’ll have to give me a few minutes to set up the stations.”
next time, maybe?”  He glanced around wildly, trying to get his bearings after losing all sense of direction and space.  After a second, the alleyway clicked in his mind, and he realized they were right next to Honeydukes.  “Especially when we’re only going…oh,
Altogether, it was confusing and disastrous and Draco was definitely coming back tomorrow.  Potter was
Wait-” Harry started, but Draco merely looked him over once more with a smirk before ducking out the door.  Maybe it was petty, but he had to have at least a
He couldn’t help it; he laughed.  It was like he was eleven years old again, pointing the wand at Ollivander’s desk lamp and causing it to rise – a spell that had never worked for him under his mother’s wand at that age.  The joy was childlike and infectious, and filled some of the emptiness in him with
.  He had nothing to hide, he thought, but it was still too easy to invade someone’s privacy that way.
“Though, not altogether inaccurate,” he rushed to admit.  Heat bloomed across his face, but this time, he let it.  He decided that if he used vulnerability as self-punishment for every time he was a dick to someone, it would certainly discourage him from doing so in the future.
As the evening meandered into maudlin night, he tried to decide whether he would turn in early, or, perhaps, practice some grueling drills – and then still turn in early.  In the beginning, he’d tried to keep up with his Potions reading, but now, he simply couldn’t be bothered.  It wasn’t like he’d get a job in a reputable shop after this, and he certainly wasn’t returning to Morpheus’.  His career options were only as good as his body – which was feeling rather infirm at the moment.
Potter was speaking again, pressing his hands to invisible wounds, his voice taking on a tone of begging that Draco had never heard him use before.  “Draco,
Draco took an instinctive step back, caught so off-guard that he knocked into the door.  “Easy, Potter.  I’m just getting Jimmy a new broom,” he babbled, throwing his hands up quite involuntarily.
“Yes, Potter,” he said slowly, trying not to think about it.  Trying to keep it contained.  “I regret taking the Mark.  Does that make you happy to hear?”  He said the last part scathingly, his words cutting two ways.
He peeled off his robes and then his shirt, and Draco felt a renewed spike of lust shoot through him at the sight.  “

, apparently.  He undoubtedly thought that, with someone as morally corrupt as a Malfoy, it didn’t matter if he didn’t tell the truth.  He deserved that little respect.
It was incredible – it truly was.  He said as much before turning back to his breakfast.  It just… the careless optimism with which he imparted it – clearly assuming that
Draco scowled.  Where did Potter get off, doing things like this to him?  First, he ignored him, then he’d stare hungrily across the room, like Draco was a ripe pheasant, ready to be plucked.  If he was going to look like
The man glared distrustfully at him for several seconds before finding their names on the form again and confirming that he was telling the truth.  “Fine.  I suppose that’s all in order, then.  You may proceed.”
“You know what,” Draco responded.  “Why’d you use the bubble jinx?”  Even having never seen it with his own two eyes, his father’s memory was vivid enough.  Potter certainly wouldn’t have forgotten something like that.
When he’d worked up to a third finger, he saw Harry balk and pressed an encouraging kiss to his mouth.  “You’re so close,” he murmured.  “Just a little more – you’re doing great.”
Draco stared at him blankly for a moment before realizing he could think of nothing more to say.  “Er, good night?”
He felt she was asking more of him, which was irksome – especially as there was nothing holding his father to the agreement, anyway.  But he would feel dirty if his pushback forced his mother to do something like bribe him with a returned heirship once Lucius had passed – something he was certain she would do if he protested.  In the end, he just shut up and ate his soup.
And if it did, how could he possibly return to it?  How could he, in good conscience, slip into a role that had led them
Well - now it had.  Through his own idiocy and lack of self-control, he’d fulfilled his deepest fears, and he would have to face the consequences.
The snake slapped down upon the ground and hissed as it darted closer.  It was like coming full circle.  Draco grinned triumphantly at his spellwork.
When he first started appearing, Harry had seemed pleased, but a little jumpy, at his constant presence.  As the week wore on though, he settled into the routine; he even began offering a soft smile when he noticed Draco watching him.
His outburst made the judge jerk her gaze to him again, while his mother whispered a broken “Oh, Draco…”  He held the judge’s eye contact until her harsh expression flickered, and she heaved a heavy sigh.
to be modest about everything.  If Draco had been able to do that, he would have shouted it from the rooftops.  He would have strutted through every important room in the Ministry - just to walk through, just to show that he was important enough that no one would question him.
“Don’t worry about anyone but yourself,” the man sneered, but Draco watched with an ounce of surprise as he and his – four! – cronies all handed her their wands as well.
if not harassing Draco?  He wasn’t even trying to be egotistical – he just genuinely didn’t know.  Did Potter
.  The thought alone drove him to saunter carelessly into the room, ignoring the man’s look of outrage, and scan the bookshelves for his handiwork.
Harry hadn’t improved much in the years since his fateful debut at the Yule Ball (not that Draco had been watching), but he found he didn’t mind.  He’d rather have Harry stumbling into him than return to Hogwarts a master – having learned the ins and outs of dancing with some other partner.
“Can I help you?” he asked sharply, his body tense, yet refusing to turn.  Refusing to give the satisfaction.
HARRY: Err…not really.  I just… [he trails off, mind clearly not on the conversation] If I’m honest, I’d really rather not talk about this right now.
If Draco hadn’t been emboldened by his regained ownership of his wand, he might have fallen back and played more defensively.  But the way things stood, he was fed up – and in a rare position of being able to
But Potter’s response broke him from his swirling thoughts.  “What?  No – I just know you’re good at dueling.”
The oppressive cloud of prideful retribution seemed to dissipate as they surprisedly, then angrily, cackled under the effects of the charm.  Unbalanced by the sudden compulsion, Draco found himself sprawling to his knees, as he still couldn’t unstick his feet to catch himself.  He clutched a hand to his stomach in alarm, when he realized he could barely breathe for all the laughing.
Draco watched as Harry’s face went from pleasantly warm to flaming in a matter of seconds, chewing on the information that they had both clearly been startled to receive.  Draco burst into laughter, more delighted by the answer than he could have anticipated.
But it hadn’t been.  After nearly a month of skulking around Diagon Alley and dodging hexes and spit, he’d finally given up on finding somewhere
the click of the latch – he knew what it sounded like from when Ginny used to sneak in after a match and-
Draco furrowed his brow unhappily.  “Yes…well, my opponent is seasoned and relentless.”  He heaved a drawn-out sigh.  “Fenn tricked me into acting in our ‘house of horrors’ type event.”
Finally, he looked up.  He wheezed in a breath, fingers clenching harder on the fistful of Draco’s shirt.  “But-but the blood!  It won’t stop.”  He inspected his fingers with horror, red slicking them and implying the worst.
The first-years cheered, and Draco rolled his eyes affectionately as he summoned spare quaffles and rain orbs to the ring.  He’d invented the game on a whim when the students were getting particularly unruly leading up to the Ball; he hadn’t expected it to become a class favorite.
Mother glanced around the room once more, cataloguing his mental state from the condition of his walls, the freshness of his linens - no doubt.  She’d always had a habit of being too perceptive for her own good.  That’s why it had only been a matter of time before she noticed the letters.
Slughorn nodded emphatically, relief visible on his face.  “Yes, I… I think that’d be best.  Thank you.”
He was in his room when she came.  The afternoon light was casting a green, undulating glow through his porthole window when his mother appeared at the door.
“You were,” Harry assured, making a breathy noise as Draco nipped at his ear.  “You’re always up to something.”
for you to call me by my given name,” he said instead, because jokes were all Harry seemed capable of responding to.
There had been far more than “fucking” going on in the past thirty minutes, and it was more than Draco was ready to admit.
Then McGonagall was starting announcements, and Draco was left sandwiched between a brusque charms professor and a lone, empty chair.  Wonderful.  The Sorting began as normal, and somehow
“Yes.  Good to see you,” he parroted as their goblets filled magically with wine.  He glanced at the first course lining the table as if hoping to draw some prediction from it.
first, and the “spooky” aspect could be added at the end.  Spelling the tie orange, he set to work finding a shirt and vest to complement it.
“I just wish there was proof that it’s all worth it someday,” Sam said mournfully after a pause.  “Something that would make it easier to make some sort of decision in the
Draco considered pushing the issue further, before deciding to hold off until later.  When Harry would be less guarded, hopefully.  “Alright.”
He rolled his eyes.  “That’s ‘Mister Malfoy’ to you,” he grumbled – which only made her laugh again.
He leaned in closer, unable to help himself, as he wanted to see that beautiful blush up close.  “Class starts at three.”
Harry came back to himself, realizing he’d been hesitating.  That was no good; he didn’t want to seem weak to Malfoy, or anyone else.  Malfoy was clearly toying with him—throwing that phrase around and expecting Harry to look like an idiot when he didn’t know it.  Hah.  Well, he’d show
[DRACO nods and, without thinking, looks at HARRY who raises a brow then grabs the other side of the platter without prompting.  DRACO looks suddenly flustered, but, somehow, they manage to get it to the judging table without it toppling.  The effect is truly magnificent.]
Draco fought back a laugh as Longbottom spoke to Potter, and the man sent him one last vicious glare before turning away and responding.
Admitting this to himself, finally, he felt his shoulders sag, and he considered just sitting back down.
In the background, Harry saw a variety of items manifesting – including, surprisingly, a button-machine.
Draco shifted his focus to unbuttoning Harry’s trousers as fast as he possibly could, slipping his hand beneath his pants the second the flies were undone.  He grasped Harry’s cock in his hand, marveling at how it felt to finally be
he have this?  This shred of feeling desired?  The simple pleasure of someone’s hands running down his flesh?  Following that logic, he knew he was doing nothing wrong; but he couldn’t fully erase that irksome splinter of guilt.
“Hello,” Draco greeted them.  He smiled and stepped out, trying to look confident, rather than a continuation of his anguished, teenage self.
“Little Mary never had a chance!” Marla cooed with a smile, and, at that moment, Draco knew they had definitely been Sorted correctly.
“I believe I have everything I need,” he managed, feeling strangely out of his depth.  “But thank you – I’ll keep that in mind.”
With a start, Draco realized that the muffled chiming had been the clock.  Right – his appointment.  However, the idea of Harry leaving now was too terrible to even mention.
“And you’re trying to alleviate that guilt by doing something productive for Sam that would make things easier and even out your experiences a bit.”
exciting is diving into your last signature challenge.  Contestants, you’d better get ready to stomp on some glasses, because this week’s challenge is to make 36 perfect rugelach.
“Always?  I notice the change in tense there, Potter.  What – you think I’m up to something, even now?”
Draco was rubbing his forehead, trying to erase the headache pounding in his skull.  He had drunk entirely too much last night, and not even a hangover potion had completely mitigated the symptoms.  There was something about that last glare the bartender had given him that had sent him into a downward spiral; he didn’t drink like that often, but he knew he couldn’t give himself the opportunity again.
“Oh?  And what was that?”  Potter’s voice was hard, but it did a bad job hiding his underlying curiosity.
“Wonderful,” the woman deadpanned, sliding two capped thimbles of potion to them across the desk.  “Then, let us proceed.”  She waited until they’d both drunk to get started.  “Alrighty.  First: do you verify that you are indeed as you appear, defendants Narcissa Malfoy and Draco Lucius Malfoy, and that you have not ingested any identity-altering potions (including, but not limited to: polyjuice potion) or performed any identity-altering spells?”
He adjusted his gloves some more when he got out to the field, tightening them angrily to show Potter that he wasn’t forgiven for his slights.  But given the man’s idiocy in the past, he figured he probably didn’t get it.  Draco caught him looking when he threw a leg over his broom though and took off at a higher speed than normal to show that he wasn’t messing around this time.
Grant sighed with a wry look on his face, scuffing his shoe along the ground before looking up.  “Alright,” he said, as if they’d been midway through a conversation.  “Is this how it’s going to be, then?”
But whatever plan he started hatching was promptly tossed aside the next day after his interaction with Flitwick.  By chance, they’d ended up sitting next to each other at dinner (mostly because Draco couldn’t stomach another night rubbing elbows with Trelawney and inhaling her cloud of incense), and they’d been partway through their meals when the man brought up the topic of dueling club.
A week before the Halloween Ball, Marla burst into the common room on a shout.  “Everyone - everyone, listen!  They’ve got
voicing a threat, you believed that his former treatment of you, combined with him reaching for his wand, served as the equivalent, and thus acted on said belief, which led to what happened next?”  She sounded frightfully neutral about the whole situation, and he feared that it still wasn’t enough context to absolve him.
He knew at least seventy percent of this was stemming from Harry’s inexplicable humiliation kink, which had been equal parts delicious and surprising to discover in the first place.  Which was why he’d make sure Harry got exactly what he wanted.
Nodding off, thoughts lost in the beautiful enigma that was Potter, he managed to cast a notice-me-not charm on the room that was strong enough to last until morning.  He couldn’t say he understood it, but Potter was
Other teachers filed in, none taking the seat to his right.  Trelawney trailed by with her big, moony eyes, followed by Slughorn, who pretended not to see him.  The bastard had never recognized his talent in Potions, and Draco found himself wishing half-heartedly for the man’s early retirement.  Then he could take the position he really wanted - though he knew he didn’t deserve it.
Draco felt his jaw drop.  He hadn’t seen the man in two bloody years, and then he just happened to show up at Hogwarts on his first day back?  To what - ruin his already tenuous peace of mind?
VOLDEMORT: The wild strawberry is such a delicate flavor that it really becomes a conduit for other flavors.  As such, the lime juice and mint you added is really coming through – congratulations.  These are all well-rounded combinations.
Instead of protesting it like he’d imagined, Malfoy’s face went incredulous before breaking into a devious smirk.  “Kept a record of me, did you?”  He leaned against the wall, crossing his arms with a casual grace that left Harry’s mouth dry.
Something felt so freeing about the open air.  Perhaps, it was due to the stark contrast between this sky and the many forms of prison he’d endured so far in his life.  He remembered the first time he had noticed it, how, in sixth year, his initial excitement had bled into suffering – how the stone walls had closed around him like a vise, and Hogwarts had become his first real prison.
“Harry.  I can see you’re obviously freaking out, which is why I’m here to say…don’t.  Everything will go as we discussed – I’m sure he’ll figure it out in an instant!”
.”  He placed the book in front of Potter, trying not to grin like a loon at the things the man had admitted – both with his words and otherwise.
“What if you ‘fuck yourself up’ and don’t have a wand to fix things?” Draco asked, finding a shred of his former boldness.
It was a line like out of his nightmares.  And the worst part was that he couldn’t even pretend to be surprised – this was what he deserved.  Anyone in Harry’s shoes would’ve come to these conclusions long ago.
“No!  Of all the stupid-” Pottered blabbered.  He seemed too startled by this chance meeting to form proper sentences.  “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
Everything paused as Flitwick’s voice cut through the layers of pain separating them from the world.
He bit the inside of his cheek at the arch expression.  The guilt was eating him alive.  “I needed…a break.  For a while.”
Draco opened his mouth to say more, but realized there was nothing else to say on the subject – nothing reasonable, anyway.  He was only now realizing that he’d been expecting Harry to offer to accompany him.
Working with Morpheus was degrading, but Draco managed to get through his first month on grit and gumption alone.  He brewed potions for roughly twelve hours per day, breaking only to owl the nearby inn for a meal, which would appear about twenty minutes later on the workbench in the back.
Yet, again, Potter did not visit.  Draco might’ve simply given it all up too, had he not run into Longbottom on his way to visit Hannah’s office.
“Alright,” he said, “I’ll bite.  What does Our Wizarding Savior have in mind?  Where does the grand Harry Potter take his dates?”
“Oh, are you?”  She signaled a waitress for more sugar for the table.  “Then, I’m afraid I’ll have to elaborate: how are you and Professor Potter getting along?”
” he held up the fingerless leather gloves and watched as Harry’s expression flickered from surprise to lust.  He slid them on deftly, securing the fasteners with controlled, practiced motions.  “Well, Potter,” he said, leaning close until Harry’s eyes fluttered shut in anticipation, then stopping.
“Well…”  Harry eyed him consideringly.  Like he was sizing him up before deciding whether to impart a secret.  “Did you know…about the horcruxes?”
“Alright, alright, you win,” he muttered, giving in to the smugness across her face.  In fact, he fed her the exact line she wanted to hear: “What would
Draco had grown weary.  He’d grown weary of the sex and all the betting. More than anything, he wanted his magic back.  If he could last a little over three more months, then he’d have made it; his sentence would end, and he’d get his wand back.  But three months stretched like an eternity before him.
Harry huffed an ironic little laugh.  “That’s right.  I figured it would be less conspicuous than leaving from the front doors of Hogwarts, skipping hand-in-hand.”
Worthless Death Eater scum that you are?  I could’ve laughed in your face like the other shops you tried-”
Harry rushed to comply.  Skeins of parchment making up final exams crumpled and ripped beneath his hands.
“Peeves,” he said carefully, once the students had hurried off.  “I’m frankly surprised that you’re here doing
He straightened slowly, nodding – making sure Harry saw the smirk on his lips.  Debating his next move for only a second before deciding.
Hope y'all are doing well.  Also, WOW, I've passed 100k in this sequel now... and I have a fair bit left still.  How the holy hell did that happen.
been relaxing into Phineas Bourne’s dreadfully dry prose and had been on the edge of convincing himself the text was
“Right now,” Draco explained, “it causes people to lie compulsively, instead of simply resisting the truth.”
, and it was always a downward spiral from there.  There were so many nightmares so eager to crawl across his skin.  Best to leave bad memories alone.
“Nothing,” Draco said quickly, lest Harry decide against such casual intimacy.  “Just…this is nice.”  His words failed to summarize his veritable maelstrom of emotions, but that was the closest he could come to describing it.
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Harry squeezed his eyes shut as Draco began cruelly fondling his balls.  He licked languorously up Harry’s shaft and paused, laving delicate, infuriating caresses on the tip of his hardened cock.  His whole manner issued a challenge:
, however, this was not necessarily the case.  After long games – mostly the ones Draco won – he’d often retreat upstairs to find not only Grant but a handful of other players waiting for him.  These were the kinds of men who often felt no shame in praising the Dark Lord – or, conversely, believed that Draco’s past lent him an edge of danger that would feel glorious to conquer and control.
“Of course.”  Her lips quavered as if she were about to laugh, so she hid them behind her teacup.  When the cup tapped back into the saucer, her face had smoothed.  “That wouldn’t have anything to do with your rivalry with Professor Potter, would it?  Though –
Marla burst into tears, nodding as she picked up a book of her own, clutching it to her chest.  She cradled it like it was the most important thing in the world.
[CEDRIC is curling them perfectly with the parchment paper he cut into individual segments earlier for this purpose.  Unlike the others, who only manage to roll one before they harden and need to go back into the oven, he can do four in one go.]
Frankly, Draco was doing everything he could not to rise to the bait.  But the extreme mortification was getting to him, for sure.
Draco rubbed at his face, wishing again that he could just disappear into his book and leave all these problems and decisions behind.  “Oh, she’s undoubtedly ‘leaving out details,’” he quipped.  “It’s a Malfoy family trait.”  He thought, not a little self-deprecatingly, about his own secrets that had not yet come to light.  Like the magical “realization moment” he’d had that Harry kept asking him about.
“Is he…doing worse?”  From the awkward twist of Harry’s mouth, Draco could tell he was trying to be sensitive – which meant worlds, considering the history Harry had with Lucius.
I thought it was fun that the chapter 11s of SIFLEOY and TNFI aligned, so it feels like the timelines are still somewhat on track!  Anyway, hope you're all gearing up for the real Halloween (the Greatest holiday), and stay safe!
“-clearly doesn’t know your tastes as well as someone who’s dated you.  Yes, I agree.”  She smirked like this was all hilarious and not world-shatteringly humiliating.  “Anyway, I’m going to go – fun as this was.  I have some fragile, Ron-shaped worldviews to break, some money to collect, and Harry, you
He grinned and ruffled her hair – which was still tangled with burrs – before watching her set off down the hall.  For once, he had no doubts he had done the right thing.  His heart felt overfull and tender, and, for an instant, he forgot he’d been thinking of this place as another prison.  In fact, in that moment – it felt like exactly where he needed to be.
Several of the older Slytherins had volunteered to take over as the “haunted escort,” but Draco was having fun, so he shooed them onto the Ball.  Besides, it seemed a waste not to wait for Potter to come by – he’d be damned if the Savior was frightened by anyone else’s hands, and he wanted to savor the rare expression that would invariably cross his face.
“Stupider than you wanting to date a former Death Eater?” Draco attempted again, this joke falling even flatter than the last.
far from being someone he could view as an equal partner?  Or was Harry oddly suspicious of such labels?
It took every ounce of willpower to resist leaning in and completing the caress Potter had started with his eyes, but he knew how tenuous this moment was.  He needed to
Oh, teasing him like this was gloriously fun.  If only they could be on the same page about the meaning of it all…
“Wellllll…” He stretched out the syllable to be cute, but from Hermione’s expression, he was falling somewhere short of “pathetic.”  “Ron and I have a plan.”
His class status was a point of contention between them, even though Draco had ostensibly lost any of his former privileges.  While Morpheus mocked him for his background, calling him “snobbish” – or worse – he could see the gleam of jealousy in the man’s eyes when he needled him about all the luxuries Draco had lost.
And then he proceeded to Occlude the rest, unwilling to continue standing here discussing this.  It had gone far enough.
in its entirety - powering through what could only be considered “Phineas Bourne’s literary masturbation” - in an attempt to forget anything to do with Potter.  He scoped out an abandoned lab in the dungeons too, and by day three, he was brewing again – experimenting with all the potions he couldn’t afford the ingredients for back when he worked at Morpheus’ Miscellany.
“We need to talk-” he started, then seemed to realize where exactly they were – namely, one of the gossip mills of the school – before rephrasing.  “You need to
Potter grimaced and shook some leaves from his hair in an adorable gesture that looked a lot like a crup shaking water from its fur.
Anyway, people were milling about and greeting him, but not in the struck-silent way they had been for his more dramatic entrances this week; rather, as his classmates nodded in his direction, they did small double-takes and then gave him approving nods, like he’d finally figured something out.  Harry wasn’t quite sure
“Aren’t you?”  This time, Harry broke off for a groan, as Draco licked at the shell of his ear.  The sound made something dark and hungry rear within him.  “You’re plotting my demise,” Harry hissed.
But Harry was being a brat and not letting him – so Draco nipped his way to Harry’s neck to make him acquiesce.  His grip was giving, and Draco was almost to his collarbone when Harry drew back with a ragged gasp.
He glanced around the tavern, warmed by the familiarity of The Three Broomsticks after so long.  After the war, he hadn’t been back to Hogsmeade for fear of the reactions, fear of running into people he knew - or rather,
“You told me yourself I needed to consult with your office hours and make an appointment,” he said.  “I made several.”
“What?  You thought you’d spend it prancing around that defiled school of yours with your perverted little consort?”
Draco turned redder than he was previously (which was more of scarlet, but now resembled a robust crimson). “I knew that. I was just checking if you did.” He tucked the pamphlet back into his book and pushed the five others he had in front of him under the couch.
What had happened to that raw, savage magnetism that drew them together again and again?  Potter had surely felt it yesterday at dinner – he

CEDRIC: It hasn’t been an issue at home!  I’ve had my girlfriend, Cho, taste them, and she assures me that they’ve been crisp.  I know how you hate soggy bottoms, Voldemort.
“I needed money.  Merlin – who doesn’t?  I sound like such a cliché when I say it out loud.”  She sighed.  “But I had gone through a rough patch with the law after leaving my ex-husband.  He was bitter and tipped off the Aurors about me having a Dreamless Sleep addiction – which I didn’t, not really.  But what would it matter if I had?  It wouldn’t harm anyone.  And if I’d been rich, or a man, they certainly wouldn’t have taken me in.”
[Cut back to the finals, in which HARRY, DRACO, and CEDRIC are starting to take their pirouettes out of the oven to roll.  DRACO attempts it with gloves, but quickly finds he doesn’t have the necessary dexterity with them on and pulls them off, growling, with his teeth.  HARRY merely reaches in and grabs them, hissing as the hot biscuit burns him.]
Draco found himself snorting in delight as Potter flipped around to try and escape.  “Potter,” he called.
.  It’s a matter of morals and invasiveness; everyone has the right to keep their secrets their own, up until they’ve caused irreparable harm to someone that they are prosecuted and sentenced for.  As neither a lawmaker nor an enforcer, you have no place in that memory-surrendering process.  Even if your life is at stake in the future, you must find another way to defend yourself.  If – and only
”  Harry’s eyes caught with heat on Draco’s calves before wrenching away.  “Anyway, I’m fairly certain she’ll let you Floo if you ask her.”
Harry took a deep breath.  “Right.  Well, despite having our obvious differences, there was one particular time in which Malfoy saved my life-”
And really, it was astounding that someone could be so utterly blind to the main point.  “I’m not talking about the press, I’m talking about
With that in mind, he drew his second hand down to catalogue the feel and size of his bollocks.  He rolled them languidly in his palm, and Harry let loose a wordless cry that had him pressing higher into his perineum next.
They nodded, and then all three boarded their brooms and began to rise.  The practice went well – Kat had the natural disposition for a beater, all brazen dives and confident swings, and Marla seemed to be talented in strategic hits where Kat sometimes lacked precision.  Overall, they were both quite good, and, also, quite good
“Fuck,” he gritted out, as the sight of Harry’s perfect arse paired with that voice sent his arousal to dangerous heights.  He brought his palm down again, hard.
” he hissed, stepping back out of her grip as Padma and Millicent entered the common room.  He smiled weakly, and they continued on past.
Harry tugged him back the other way, before he could continue his complaint, and Malfoy spun messily back to face him.  The man’s face was red—likely from rage—and Harry laughed to see his nemesis in such disarray over a battle tactic he himself had chosen.
.  It’s uncool.”  He caught Harry’s eye, and they shared a manly I-gotchu-bruh nod.  Hermione just didn’t understand.
Draco shivered – not because of the words, but because he had said something similar to his mother recently.  And he was far past the point of feeling pleased at his and his father’s similarities.
“Well, it looks like you were just in it for the pudding.” Draco grinned. “That’s alright, I have a cure for that.” Draco grabbed his wand off the nightstand, aimed it at Harry’s flappy windsock penis and said, “

He cast drying and warming charms over the man’s skin, transfixed by the sight of Harry haloed in steam.  His eyes caught on Harry’s, which were tracking him, dark and hungry.
But Harry had already extricated himself from the warmth of the covers and was hurrying to the adjacent bathroom.  “It doesn’t feel the same!” he called over his shoulder as he disappeared.
But at least with Grant he could tell it came from a place of commiseration – a self-martyrized call of “the world isn’t fair to those who stray outside the lines.”  With Grant’s
“Eventually, my sentence ended, and they returned my wand to me.  At which point, I hoped that I could maybe get a job in something other than just mixing potions or flying.  So I applied to the position at Hogwarts, and-” here, Draco was horrified to feel his throat catching once again, “-and someone was kind enough to give me a second chance.”  Tears burned at the corners of his eyes, startling in both their suddenness and appearance.  “I had honestly applied expecting to be rejected straight off.  But I also knew that if any place would take me, it would have to be someplace run by a sentimental Gryffindor.”  He finished with a wet laugh that did nothing to hide his emotion like he had hoped.
But Harry didn’t move to lie.  He simply finished with, “That’s our business” – which wasn’t an acknowledgement, but neither was it a repudiation.
Would they even listen to him?  Would he have to meet with them every day?  Once a week?  What was expected of him in terms of directing a
it, so Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him that he’d, in fact, lived it.  After his ill-advised experiment with Pansy, pretty much everyone had known.
…  He raised an eyebrow and cleared his throat in a way he hoped looked more casual than telling.  “And?  What did he want?”
He’d just touched down on the outskirts of the pitch when he was hit full-force by one of Harry’s hugs.
Draco.  It wasn’t a threat – not in the real sense, anyway – but he could see her eyes sparkling with amusement when he folded.
Harry had seen it before – of course.  When they were dueling, in snippets of changing in front of each other, getting into bed before spelling the lights out.  But here, with the Mark red and level with Harry’s face, it felt different – perhaps too large and glaring to ignore.
Draco pursed his lips in a scowl as Harry went from humiliating him to manipulating him in a single breath.  He was sure it was
“Seeker, my boy!  The next game starts momentarily.”  He gave him a friendly shove that sent him a few steps onto the “pitch.”  Draco spun in a circle, trying to make sense of the directive under the upswelling cataclysm of noise.  The world didn’t feel real.
Harry, who’d beaten him in every fair duel they’d ever had, had snapped his wand away at the last moment.  He could have won this one, too – but he had chosen not to.
**Hey everyone!  Just as an update, I've decided to remove the "Graphic Depictions of Violence" warning from my story, as I've gotten past the darkest of Draco's memories that I'm really going to delve into, and they didn't end up being as graphic as I anticipated.  As always, I will continue to give content warnings for individual chapters, but I just wanted to let you know the reason for the change, so it wasn't a confusing surprise.
GEORGE: I don’t know about that, but I do know we’ve had an exciting season so far.  Let’s take a look at the tenuous beginnings, shall we?
Harry was looking vaguely horrified at this point, so Draco wrapped up his thank-you speech there instead of waxing poetic about something awkward and terrible like “being saved.”  After another stunned moment, Harry mumbled, “Don’t mention it.  It was the right thing to do,” which was a dumb enough thing to say that Draco couldn’t help but smile.
Draco startled, heartbeat still slamming from the adrenaline, and he mumbled, “Potter” before he could help himself.  It came out shaky like a question.
Harry had the gall to look tentatively amused.  “She sent your father all the jumpers she knitted me for Christmas.”
[DRACO turns slowly, fury warring with flecks of uncooked custard across his face.  His mouth is set in an unmoving white line, and then his face disappears from view as he lunges closer than the frame can take in.  The camera tilts wildly, like DRACO might be grabbing HARRY by the apron, and the world is suddenly full of noise.]
Harry nodded again and continued.  As if his death was no more than an unfortunate conversation point.  “Yes, so anyway, after everything was over, I was left to reconcile the Headmaster I knew and loved – and
Appallingly, Draco felt his eyes begin to water at the exceedingly touching sentiment.  He hadn’t known any of his students came from families with gay parents.  It was a revelation that forced back the bars of his mental cage and made the world feel less like a prison.
“Do you?” Harry mocked.  “Good eye.”  He trailed a line of kisses from Draco’s jaw to his collarbone, pulling down his shirt to continue against bare skin.  Draco shivered as Harry’s lips stuttered over his necklace chain, and he shivered again when Harry noticed and drew the ring between his forefinger and thumb.
“Invite me in, dear.”  Her face was made up as usual, but today it looked strained.  She wore a set of plain, unadorned black robes that were becoming, yet not up to her typical standard of opulence, and Draco found himself wondering for the first time whether she was aging more since he left – or if he was simply removed enough from the Manor to start noticing.
“I’ll have it with milk, thanks.”  She snapped her fingers, and a house elf appeared with a tea tray, setting it down before Mother with an inquisitive glance in his direction.
The poor boy looked like he was about to pass out from nerves.  “Err, yeah.  It’s fine…”  He looked desperately to Draco, who decided it was finally time to take pity on him.
you,” his mother cut in, before he could make a biting response.  She placed a firm hand on his shoulder and walked them into the lobby.  “Draco, get a hold of yourself,” she hissed.
He felt a hand clap down on his shoulder, followed by a dizzying suction.  Draco stumbled out of the Apparition, falling against a wall with obvious distress.
“Which one?”  Draco leaned forward, refusing to allow Harry to break his gaze.  “The time you ran into me?”
His voice was laden with smugness, and it was clear he had a hand in whatever “alternative society” he was hinting at.
“Slytherin, huh?  Fuck.  That simultaneously makes no sense and perfect sense – you always were a sneaky bastard.  And the parseltongue-”
“But ours surely will,” Draco quipped, to the infinite amusement of Sam and an immediate glare from Harry.  He shrugged and dropped him a wink.
He tucked a lock of unruly hair behind Harry’s ear.  “You heard what I told Mother; I’m always serious.”  His fingers caught the man’s chin and lifted it to face him.  “And were you really that worried?”
to be just a regular duel.  Perhaps Potter wasn’t, in fact, plotting to trounce him in front of a captive audience as a spectacle.  In which case-
As he had hoped, the match was quick and dirty – laden with taunts and feints that left him breathless.  Exhilarated as he was to fly with Potter again, Draco was almost taken in by the Wrongski attempt, which he pulled out of at the last second.  (Just because he was destined to follow Potter crashing into the ground didn’t mean he needed to enact it
Draco’s chest ached, and he wasn’t even surprised when Harry quietly murmured, “There is.  Proof, I mean.”  The man was a bleeding heart – if even
[Cut back to the tent, where the bakers are furiously mixing their batters.  The judges appear next to DRACO’S work station, where he is meticulously measuring sugar and scraping the excess off the cup with the back of a knife.]
.  He’d worked him up and cursed him before going on that little potions date.  He’d nearly forgotten.
Draco wiped at his cheek self-consciously.  He knew he was covered in grass and dirt.  But with Potter looking so animated from the match in front of him, he couldn’t bring himself to care.  That awful weariness that had blanketed Potter since his return seemed to have evaporated in the space of his victory, and it was a good look on him.  A
Draco squeezed his eyes shut and tried to stem the tidal wave of frustration from pouring out his mouth.
* it – I’ll have to make a new batch.  [A dangerous thought comes across his face.]  Or maybe…  [He sets the used pot back on the stove to reheat it – going against all principles of making a proper caramel.]
Draco flew alongside the boy currently in last, smiling encouragingly when he happened to catch his eye.  The student out front was just reaching the goalposts, where the next wave of players was waiting.  She threw her quaffle through the first hoop with a cheer that quickly turned into a groan where her team member dropped it.
[Cut to a montage of puds being boiled, baked, and decorated.  The foreshadowing is heavy-handed as RON’s collapses to the tune of dramatic music as he pulls the mold off in the last minute.  His eyes are swimming with the ghosts of puddings past, and you can see the moment the light leaves them and he comes to terms with his fate.]
“Must be impressive, to shut your sassy mouth,” he quipped, tugging Harry in by the hair so that his cock rested against his lips.  Harry’s mouth softened into a groan, letting it slip past his teeth with a hum.  He sunk onto it, his hands pulling Draco’s hips closer, which, in turn, kept forcing Draco’s cock deeper.
, which he had finished at breakfast this morning.  Skeeter’s headline screamed at him from the front page,
Ron sat up from where he’d been lying back on his bed, ready, for the past twenty minutes.  “He can’t do that!”
He teased Potter a bit more as they drifted along, but his thoughts weren’t really on the words he was saying – they were lost in the graceful curve of the man’s shoulders; the unwavering grip with which he held his broom.
I can sympathize with.  I think a few Gryffindors saw me leave this morning; one looked a wee bit scandalized, if I recall.”
he wondered.  Prove that he could dance well enough to get even Malfoy to join in—a tall order, given Harry’s history with dancing, but he was nothing if not a Gryffindor.
He was provoking Potter because it was familiar.  That was all.  An almost decade-long crush didn’t even factor into it.
[DRACO walks stiffly to the front, carting an artisan wood-carved box with his three styles of rugelach arranged in even rows.  The decoration is minimal, yet effective, and the overall appearance is very graceful.]
FRED: [whispering, a bit smug] Well, it looks like that’s another mystery resolved.  Take care, my friends, and – as always – bake on!
Anyway, the effect the altered pin was having on Malfoy was rather profound, actually – and Harry didn’t know quite what to make of it.  The blond kept opening and closing his mouth as if to say something, looking quite off-balance, and there was a definite tint of pink to his cheeks.
No – children were not to be trusted with unsupervised party preparations, and the fact that Draco was saying that at twenty made him feel stodgy and terribly
VOLDEMORT: [analyzes it closely for a long stretch of time] I can still see your father’s style in this work.  [He glances up to notice DRACO stiffen.]
– either way.  He’d agreed to come out to Hogsmeade today, so he clearly thought enough of Draco for that.  It was up to
Draco drew him in by the hips again, relishing the small grunt that left Harry’s mouth, unbidden.  He hit the spot again, slow but steady.  He watched, fascinated, as Harry’s abs spasmed in a full-body shudder.  He did it again.
Manny passed him a tumbler of firewhisky, which awoke him from his reminiscence and sent him into the fresh moral dilemma of whether it would be more responsible to stop his seventh years from drinking alcohol or to chaperone them when they did it anyway.  He certainly wouldn’t have listened to such stodgy advice when he was slipping firewhisky into the dorms himself.
Propelled by the words, Draco stepped up into his space, then paused, unsure of how to proceed.  They’d just been screaming at each other, moments before.  He reached out a tentative hand, half-expecting it to be swatted away despite Harry’s words.  His palm met the man’s face unimpeded, and he ran it down the smooth glide of Harry’s jaw before moving closer.
[It cuts to DRACO, who shares an awkward embrace with his mother, and then a jerky nod at his expressionless father.  They sit alone at the far table, clearly out of place amidst this crowd.]
Draco laughed, frankly amazed that he still could.  “Yeah, I thought that at first, too,” he admitted.  “It would’ve been much more manageable that way.  She didn’t even mention the jumpers, now that I think about it.  Unfortunate, really.  I was secretly hoping the fallout was close to your impression of it.”
Even in the relative darkness, he could make out Potter’s blush.  When the man refused to comment further, he sighed and let it go.  He wouldn’t push.
“-and like I said, I have a vast selection of brooms ready, so you can test any of them you’d like!  Though, between you and me,” he leaned closer to Draco’s ear than was strictly comfortable, “the Green Flash is the one you want to use.  Newest broom on the market and most expensive too – but trust me, it’s
He watched the telltale flushing of Potter’s cheeks with fascination, eyes falling upon his lips as the man stuttered, “Al-alright then.  Tomorrow.”
had weighed heavy on his mind, and some part of him had since been stuck on the idea that he could figure something out…a counter-potion of sorts.  Something to ease his mind, if not his past.
Some students caught theirs right off; for others, it took several tries and a few bounces off the pitch before they could secure them.  That was fine – the game was more for fun than for skill.
They parted ways at the edge of the pitch, and he watched her red ponytail bobbing after her as she disappeared into the lockers.  It wasn’t even a question, where he was going next.
Fuck, maybe the crop top was drawing too much attention.  He had cut up one of his Cannons t-shirts as a last-minute addition, which had clearly been overkill.
, I will need to collect your memory of the incident with your boss for your file, and I will mark down my stipulation, should you ever be accused of another incident in the future.”
The redheaded girl, Marla, blushed a bit – probably from the first name address by a teacher.  Draco noted that it was a bit uncommon at Hogwarts, but something about calling all his students “Mister” and “Miss” when he
.  “I…I see,” he managed.  “And would you mind if I saw that meal for a moment?”  At the unimpressed look he received, Draco rushed to formulate a believable cover story.  “We’re good friends, you see.  But Potter’s been down lately, and I thought I’d cheer him up.  Do you mind?”
“Helping to plan a Halloween Ball, as it turns out,” he allowed.  “I was temporarily promoted to Head of House for the extent of the festivities.”
Draco scoffed, shedding his robes and folding them before seating himself next to Harry.  “You kept starting sentences with ‘Actually, I-’ then breaking off and telling me mundane updates about Weasley and Granger’s lives – all whilst continuing to frown like a kicked crup.  Was that
He’d never done any of this before.  It was so much easier to shag blokes in the staff bathroom of a bar, because the groundwork didn’t matter – he wasn’t emotionally
into Harry’s room that evening instead of sneaking.  And, by Harry’s expression, he was equally delighted.
” Granger cut in, with a glimmer in her eye.  “Why hadn’t I thought of that?  If we were able to create a sort of potion that reverses the effects, then Aurors – and others for that matter – would be able to take it in advance of an interrogation situation if they’re undercover or have some on hand as a defense.  Merlin, the possibilities are endless!”
Harry let out a small gasp, squirming from the breath against his ear, and Draco pulled him flush against his waist by the belt loops.
frustrated than he had already been.  It wasn’t fair – life had that particular way of only giving him what he wanted when it was tainted by some darker aspiration.
At first, the pitch seemed ordinary.  It was empty, save for a few people gathered with brooms on the far side of the stands – too far to make out clearly.  Draco stumbled a few steps away from his captors before turning.
.  Here, there was a mention of “losing to Harry Potter at darts at the Hog’s Head” – was that supposed to be an invitation to Hogsmeade?  And in October, he had written down something about embarrassing him in public.  Did that mean he wanted to
He scowled at her briefly before turning his ire back upon Draco.  “When I first read the article this morning, I couldn’t even come up with a plausible explanation for what I was seeing.  But now, I understand exactly what’s going on here.  You’re doing this to
VOLDEMORT: As a half-Jewish man myself, I’ve been making rugelach for the better part of sixty years, so I know exactly how difficult they can be to get right.  If you don’t have a tight enough roll, the filling can drip out and cause leakage, which will be the number one hurdle the bakers will have to overcome.  We’re looking for
Even if it was Skeeter, he felt that any external validation on this particular issue could be trusted more than his own hopelessly delusional perspective.  Potter could punch him in the face, and Draco would still be looking for clues of attraction in the act.
Harry watched him thoughtfully as Draco tucked the corked vials back into his pocket.  After a moment’s silence, he burst out, “It’s not like I like your hands or anything.”
Draco swallowed clumsily and then forced himself to continue.  “We’ve had to redefine the concept of ‘purity’ a bit, obviously.”
He fought to regain his bearings, and then moved to flipping through Morpheus’ memories.  His mind was disorganized, unsurprisingly, but Draco was spiteful enough in that moment to dig patiently until he found something.
“How long have you…have you wanted to ‘fuck’ me?” he asked, so earnest that Draco that wanted to scream.
.  The quick, attentive lines of him as he stalked down the corridor.  The unwavering grip on his wand as he pointed it every which way he roamed.  Draco imagined how addicting it would feel to be the sole object of Potter’s consuming hyper-focus.
Harry broke into laughter that was so contagious that Draco soon followed.  Then, he was grabbing the Floo powder off his mantel and offering some to Draco with an outstretched hand.  “You ready?” he asked, voice soft.
He steadied himself with a handful of black hair, and Harry’s heavy-lidded expression was enough to drive Draco to the edge.  His eyes flicked up to meet Draco’s, and Draco tugged his head away with a desperate urgency.  “Harry, I’m going to… I’m close-”
for months, and he had never heard anyone address him as anything other than ‘The Dark Lord.’  Hearing it now, he felt the irrational fear that it would summon him again.
looking Potter, he noted – walking a kid in his direction.  Potter glanced up then, eyes widening and then a look of worry coming over his face before he nodded, greeting him with a neutral “Malfoy.”
He needed to leave the Manor.  That much was absolutely clear to him.  If Draco didn’t leave the Manor soon, there wouldn’t be enough left of him when he finally got out.
Draco heard the telltale crack of a breaking broom as he dodged the opponent’s feint.  The man went barreling into the ground in a halo of splinters.  Shit.
He could see Harry turning that over in his head.  “Wait, but if you’ve been disinherited for a year, why did they make you go explain yourself after that article came out?”
Judge Graddlethorn’s eyes lingered upon him, and he brought the second thimble to his lips after only the slightest hesitation.
and ethically complicated that the thought of teaching it to students made him want to scream.  Though, perhaps, it could solve the issue of Harry’s intentions much more quickly.
Fine.  He’d shut this down before it could get started.  “Yes, you were acting so ridiculously this morning, I thought I’d go have a laugh.”
Harry scrabbled for Draco’s shoulders, looking for something to hold onto.  His head rose from the pillow in supplication before it fell with a soft
The first performance went magnificently.  The brave clump of Gryffindors tore, screaming, out of the dungeons – and it was with infinite smugness that Draco sat up from the cold stones and spelled the “blood” from his clothes.  The boggart had been the perfect choice.
Ron grinned like he had a particularly good move planned out in a game of chess.  “Yes.  Now, listen.  Here’s what we’re going to do-”
“Draco, my boy!  Glad you could make it!”  He clapped him hard on the shoulder, and Draco had to make an earnest effort to keep from sprawling forward.  It was a gesture he was unused to – and from the look in Bagman’s eyes, he was well aware of that fact as he did it.
“…As such, Slytherin has lost ten points for purposefully endangering the student body.  Just because there are chaperones present does
.  Anyway, with me it was totally different.  Hogwarts is my alma mater, and they said they’d be honored to have me come back and give a few classes in ‘business strategies for culinary entrepreneurs.’  Since I’ve been so successful and all.
The next wave was grief – for his mother.  She had endured so much during the war to have this taken from her too.  And despite how atrocious Father sometimes acted, he knew there was a part of her that still loved him.
“I’m not stacking the scores for you, if that’s what you’re asking-”  He was cut off by a wave of playful “boos” that he quelled with a smile.  “That being said, it’s no one’s fault if Slytherin team comes to me for strategy tips and practice more often than the other teams.  I’d only be doing my
in my store and conversing until I divulged that profits were down that month.  Sirius Black ruined my
Draco hooked a leg around Harry’s ankle and spun him to face the lockers before the man could resist.  He yanked the back of his trousers down to expose the round globes of his bum.
“Let’s get some music in here!” one of the Slytherins whooped—Harry thought it might have been Nott.  Then, to his mortification, he heard a clattering behind the bar, and the usual background music switched to something faster, more upbeat.
He did, crumbling it in like they’d discussed.  They’d argued a long time about whether chopping it or drying-and-subsequently-crumbling would be a better approach.  He’d won this battle, though he’d lost several others.
Harry wanted to comply – to stop, to shoo her somehow – but he also knew who he was dealing with.  If he told Ginny to leave, she’d tease him (and probably throw open the curtain while she was at it to see why).
Draco immediately regretted his choice of words, when Harry glanced up with a self-satisfied smile.  “How
Harry’s pupils dilated, and he snatched a quick kiss before Draco pushed him away.  Which killed him – but he was determined this time to get an answer this time.
Right.  He set off towards the locker rooms, so lost in thought about how to kindly discourage parents from sending their kids to school with brooms from the 1950s that he had momentarily forgotten about Potter until he heard a sharp yelp upon entering the Quidditch shed.
He kind of doubted it, but once more, the ambiguity was maddening.  He flipped to look back at September.
.  The memories of this place were already closing in on him, but only time would tell whether it would become his prison again or not.
They fell into some easy banter that Harry tentatively dispelled when he asked, “Seriously though, how are you doing?”
Merlin, she was just toying with him now.  She was smart – smarter than him, certainly – so he had no doubts that she knew
Harry matched him in passion for the kiss, licking deep into his mouth until Draco felt his muscles loosen.  He pressed in further, another nod from Harry urging him into slow, experimental thrusts.  On the fourth, he drew Harry up onto him with his hips, letting out a shaky breath as he bottomed out.
Draco contemplated it, the pleasant fog he’d been steeped in starting to drift and fade away.  “She won’t.  She has no reason to.”
Draco laughed humorlessly.  Had he just left straight after the war – packed his bags the day of the battle and disappeared – perhaps he would’ve turned out less a failure than he had.  But that was the thing about hypotheticals: they drove you crazy with envy and ultimately changed nothing.
He opened his mouth with an excuse that Draco found he’d rather not hear.  Not now, not this time – after coming so close.
, but enamored nonetheless.  He pushed himself to his feet with a grin.  His mouth felt wet, so he wiped the blood he found there.  “Better.
So yes, he might have started this with his initial approach, but the subsequent argument was entirely on Potter’s shoulders.  He had been rising so well to Draco’s bait until-…well, until – just like
His eyes flickered over Potter – his crazy hair, his battered face, those bright green eyes which shone now with only hesitance and confusion – and he felt his anger softening.  Potter was clearly a mess.  In both appearance and inside.  Draco couldn’t blame him for what he had always known to be true.
MINERVA: Rugelach are a versatile biscuit, but they can be tricky to get right.  The pastry has to be buttery, the bottoms have to be crisp, and the filling layer must be quite even before they’re rolled.  To get 36
The panic of that night was returning to him in pieces – the running, the screaming, the flames.  But more than that, the quiet terror he’d felt afterwards when Mother had told him about Harry.  How close Draco had come to never seeing him again, never resolving anything, never setting eyes on his vital, radiant form.  It felt like being told that the glass next to his contained poison, and all the reassurance that he
Another worrying habit Grant had developed was the way his eyes would linger on Draco’s Dark Mark.  The first time he’d seen it, he’d been fascinated, but his interest hadn’t waned quickly, as Draco had hoped it would.  In the times since then, Draco had caught his eyes grazing over it in the mirror and, sometimes, even repositioning his thrusts so that he could see.  Once – and only once – Grant had noticed Draco watching him and leaned down to whisper in his ear, “You and me are the same.”
And Draco could barely begin to imagine how “complicated” family was for Harry.  The boy had been raised an orphan and lost his only godfather during the war.  If anyone was an expert at grief, it was him.
one?”  He didn’t remember doing anything purposefully seductive that time, especially since it was in front of a class of first-years.  The curiosity was killing him.
Draco had gone to bed that night convinced that he had scared Potter off.  He’d been every bit of his pushy, unchecked self, and now he’d have to pay the consequences.  There’d been no mistaking the fear in Potter’s eyes.
Draco rolled over in bed, eyes catching upon the Slytherin banner hanging on his wall.  The fabric of the snake squirmed in the slight breeze from the window, and he felt his blood run cold at the movement.
“What else?”  He swallowed with embarrassment at how suddenly desperate he sounded.  “What else did he say?”
Harry to see he was still capable – that he wouldn’t let his family dictate his actions and feelings like they used to.
“Right.  Yes, you’re going to that Muggle pub you all like so much,” he remembered, trying to keep the bitterness out of his tone.  Harry, Granger, and Weasley still had their rituals – rituals that Draco was not privy to in places he was unwelcome.  He wondered vaguely what it would be like to join them, to have that warm camaraderie wash over him as they joked and laughed and drank.
The man tossed his scarf and coat over the back of a chair at the table next to theirs and then met his gaze with a sly grin.  “Hmm, which to choose?  We all know which
It must’ve worked, because Harry suddenly looked furious – which was just as gratifying now as it had always been.  Draco picked up his knife and fork again and resumed eating.  He made sure to draw each mouthful delicately from the tines with a languor not quite befitting the quality of meal.
Even without trying, he always caught Harry’s eye – the long, slender stretch of him; the way his knuckles poked dramatically out of his hands when he closed his grip around a firewhisky.  And that smirk.  It’d taken him a while to find it again after the war, but, nearly a year later, he seemed to have settled his demons enough to let it out again, on occasion.
“Yeah, well, I’ve never had a heart-to-heart in an alley before,” he responded, clearly grasping at straws.

“That’s exactly how they do it.” With no more pudding to turn him on, Harry’s dick immediately flopped over flaccid.
.  If Potter was single, Draco wouldn’t be able to focus on anything but seducing him – something he was bound to fail spectacularly at, and likely lose both his job and remaining dignity in the process.  This way should be relieving - he could treat it all as a joke, the
In the terrible moment that followed, Harry was suddenly very aware that: a) he was currently holding a Malfoy that had apparently
!  I'm having fun writing the date scenes again, though I hope it's not too repetitive with the original dialogue.  I try to only include verbatim the parts that I think are particularly relevant to show Draco's reactions/thoughts.
“Like…like this is exciting.  Scary too, but mostly exciting.  Like spending time with you…well, it’s different than how I felt for Ginny.  I loved her, and I feel terrible for how we drifted apart – it really was my fault, after all – but in this selfish way, I’m glad it happened so I could pursue this new thing with you.”
“I know,” Draco agreed quickly.  “And I’m sorry about it – I just…I don’t want to ruin things, but I just…  It’s hard for me to talk about my family.”

Potter stepped up to the stand a little nervously, and somehow that pissed Draco off even more.  How he could spend twenty minutes defeating the Dark Lord and then
“Here – let’s make a chart of which tactics have worked and which ones haven’t.”  Ron scrawled a messy line down the middle of his parchment before pointing the quill at Harry.  “Alright.  Stripey jumpers?”
Draco lay frozen and silent for long minutes in the wake of that comment as Harry fell quite rapidly into sleep.  It was the sort of thing the man would never normally say – too straightforward in its affection, too simple to be applied to this complicated thing between them.
Draco returned to the castle, pondering that statement even as he whooshed out of the Floo.  His mind was almost immediately redirected, however, by Harry’s loud refrain of “Ron wants me to be best man!”
At quarter of two – still a full hour from their Ministry appointment – Draco Flooed into the Manor to meet his mother.  Though anxious like himself, she managed to cover her nerves with needless grooming, making him sit behind her in their en suite as she fiddled about before the mirror.  Draco counted six different adjustments to her hairstyle before he eventually lost track.
Harry became serious - not as in his Godfather, Sirius Black, but as in the emotion. “Look Draco, you can be honest with me. We’re in a relationship, we should be able to be straight with each other. Straight as in being honest, not as in the sexual orientation. What did Sam whisper to you in class?”
at the six quaffles on the ground, sending them flying in wildly different directions.  The students took off – each grabbing for one to bring to their teammate on the far side of the pitch.
“Obviously, that was all bull, and he just wanted to make money.  I see it now, but I didn’t then.  Or I did, but it didn’t matter, because I had no better options.”  Her eyes made their way back to Draco’s.  “What I’m saying is you’re not nearly as entangled as you think you are.  You showed up one day at my door, and you can leave one day through it.  For me, it’s not quite so simple.”
“I…well, I found myself liking someone who was also a bloke, and that surprised me a lot, but the more I thought about it, the more it…didn’t seem so much of a surprise,” Harry was saying.
He didn’t see Potter for three days.  His eyes searched for him in the Great Hall at meals, and he found himself lingering in the corridors hoping to spot him.  But it was clear – Potter was
was all that he was worried about, he clearly hadn’t read Draco’s additions.  Which, while he had hoped for that in the beginning, now only served to piss him off further.
He felt a warm weight on his arm, and he looked up to find McGonagall reaching across the desk to comfort him.  “Thank you for telling me, Draco,” she said.  Then, fiercely, “And I would
Draco pulled away.  It cost him something of himself, but he did it anyway.  He blinked, trying to see the man in front of him clearly and not through the thick, obscuring lens of his feelings.  He tried to see the messy nest of black curls without wanting to run his hands through it; he tried to look into those wide, green eyes without thinking “beautiful.”
Harry shoved at him, dropping his hand with a playful scowl.  “I don’t know, you arse.  Where does His Pureblood Prattishness like to be courted?”
, you really are the Golden Boy, aren’t you?” he groaned.  He covered his eyes with a hand, only daring to peek through his fingers for the next admission.  “I’m a dick to you, and then you go and offer me
– how was I supposed to know that?  I was worrying all week about whether you were serious!”  Which – how ironic, considering his own doubts about Harry just now.
Draco glanced up at his boyfriend and felt the stress of the afternoon fade into background noise.  The man was so vivid, so
blocked out his resolution to hold back from making a move – he still couldn’t help but feel excited by his presence.  Besides, they’d be
” he asked incredulously – to Draco’s singular delight – before continuing without pause.  “Never mind.  At least I know better than to put on a three-piece suit to go play Quidditch in.”
So when Potter suddenly darted in his direction, it was altogether too little time for him to reign in his fantasies and react.  Potter slammed into his collarbone.
He said it despairingly, and Harry was silent.  Draco wondered what expressions they were both wearing on the other side of this door.
“Absolutely not,” Draco replied immediately.  Harry glared.  “Not without my help, that is.  Lucky for you, you’re dating the best event planner this side of Wizarding Europe.”
Draco’s vision tunneled to just the broom.  He saw a hand reach shakingly for the pieces and wondered, distantly, if it was his.
and stared into the mirror at his reflected eyes.  Yes, they were still wide and haunted.  Perhaps this was better than Morpheus’, but it was a far cry from the future he wanted.  The one he had all but given up hopes for.
He refocused in time to notice Potter’s eyes dip tellingly to his lips – and any effort at speculation flew right out the window.  The expression Potter wore – so obvious in its longing – caused Draco’s heart to stutter in a few staccato beats.
“I…”  Harry opened and closed his mouth, nuances of expression lost in the burning of his cheeks.  “I…I’ve been bad.”  His eyes dropped as he said it, voice breaking in the middle like he couldn’t quite bring himself to commit to saying it.
Really, Potter?”  He tried to rein in the hysteria in his voice, stalling by taking a swig of his drink.  “This ‘
“Very well,” Draco breathed, preparing himself mentally for the task.  He’d certainly fantasized about it enough, especially after particularly grueling matches.  He wanted to make it good – good enough that Harry would let him do it again.
