“It’s a growing gown,” Draco said.  “They’re meant to grow as you age.  But never bother, Harry; if you like green you shall have green.”
Harry shrugged.  “I can be rude if you want.”
“I meant blokes.”  Draco was finally done with the series, so Harry played a card, and the pile exploded.  “Snap!” Harry called, and got the pile.  “How come you’re not married?” he asked, thinking of it suddenly as he tried to shuffle the exploded cards into his remaining ones.
“I’m not perfect.”
“You said I was tops at potions.”
“Anyway, how were your hols?” Spragg asked.
“I daresay Harry would have survived,” Andromeda said gently.  “No one could ever stop him, even as a child.”
Harry was going to say, but Malfoy was already talking over him.
“Only a little more.”
“Sometimes if you love someone, that’s something else you do,” Draco said.  “You defend them.  You want to hurt people who would hurt them.”
, Malfoy was going to say. Harry could practically taste the word from behind Malfoy, along Malfoy’s jaw, in Malfoy’s chest, but Malfoy was breathing too hard to say it. Harry let him go.
Harry frowned. “You’re talking about Malfoy.”
“I didn’t know it was poison at the time.”
Hermione shrugged. “It’s not as if you get punished for it. Back Voldemort, be a party to the murder of innocents, join a mass murdering bigoted death cult—it’s all fine.”
“That’s not what I meant at all,” Andromeda said, still chuckling.  “I meant he doesn’t like hearing bad things said about you.”
“Less than palatable?”
“Sorry,” Harry said, letting him go.
“But now that you’ve had this dream,” said Yin, “you feel like you’re accepting something else when you accept a little breeze from him.”
Harry hesitated.  The clothes were rather nice, but perhaps they were a temptation—like sweets.  At school they sometimes told you that you shouldn’t take sweets from strangers, though plenty of the teachers were strangers, and they wanted you to do whatever they said, or else you got in trouble.  And Harry had noticed that strangers came up to him on the street more often than what seemed to happen to other people, only those strangers rarely offered him sweets, usually just tipping their hats and congratulating him for no reason.
Frowning, Harry picked up the trunk, heading back to his office to prepare for his next class.
“You know,” Harry said, sipping his coffee. “Some of us are moving on. Maybe you should too.”
“How can you not . . . ?  You really haven’t seen me?”
Kavika had said.
By now, Finnigan and Ha had also stopped their sparring, but while Ha was actually paying attention, Finnigan was just staring at Malfoy. Because Harry had thought about it earlier, he recognized the expression. Malfoy hadn’t even needed to take off his shirt—though the fact that his vest appeared to be the entirety of his upper body-wear today possibly didn’t hurt.
Harry had never thought that someone who grew up with parents who loved him and children his age who didn’t bully him could be lonely, but Draco was.  He was so desperately alone.
Malfoy lifted his foot, then brought it down hard on Harry’s face, which instantly began to bleed from the nose in a shallow spurt.
“That was already there,” the person said. “I didn’t do it! I swear!”
Harry wanted to tell Draco that he didn’t hate him.  He wanted—he wanted Draco to hug him again.  Harry wondered whether he should try hugging him himself.  He wondered whether he would have hugged his dad.
While Draco was still basically the most handsome man Harry had ever seen, just now he looked sort of terrible.  His skin, which was usually so clear, just looked a pasty white, and his hair looked limp and almost mousy-coloured.  His shoulders sagged and there were those circles under his eyes, almost like a skull, and it made Harry’s chest ache.  Maybe Draco was tired.  Maybe he was sad ten-year-old Harry was going away, only to be replaced by a Harry who apparently hated him.
The naked surprise on his face was embarrassing.  Malfoy was meant to take it as a joke; they’d been joking before.  Hadn’t they?  “What did you used to want to be when you grew up?” Harry said instead.
“Why do you care, Potter?” Greengrass’s voice was a whisper, the insidious mist that crept inside your bones on a winter’s morning. “What is he to you?”
“I participated in the discussion,” Harry said. “This is arguing.”
Harry had never thought to dread an alpaca in a therapist’s office.
Harry’s mind kept stretching, separated completely now, floating there above the table.  “Was Draco,” he began, but he already knew the answer.
Harry laughed and laughed.
“Not really my forte,” said Teddy, but he put down his enchanted guitar.
The potion had fallen on Harry; he was the one who was the wrong age.  And old-him was meant to be the policeman, only he obviously hadn’t caught the bad guy.  And old-him had furthermore dragged Draco along to that warehouse.  Draco probably hadn’t even wanted to be there in the first place, seeing as how they weren’t friends.
Harry turned, girding himself. Usually there weren’t many fans at the holiday party, as the invite list was so narrow, but inevitably somebody’s date had not yet met him, and Harry had to get through a least one awkward conversation.
“Do you think that ‘student’ means the same thing as ‘unsafe’?”
“I haven’t spoken to my sister in four years,” Baggot said, still bland. “Though when you consider Shacklebolt’s inefficient leadership, it’s hardly any wonder he can’t get a deal.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said softly. “I’m not your enemy. I never was. I was trying to help you. I was always trying to help you. I still am.”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Malfoy’s voice was breezy once again. “I suppose. If you want to be.”
“There could be again.”
Harry raised his brows, and Ron shrugged.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed. “Work it for me, slut.”
Draco looked over at Harry’s plate.  “Are you finished?”
“And yet, here we are, with the fantastic Mrs. Mulpepper to keep me company.”
Harry began, “But—”
Slowly, Harry put his arm down, looking around the room.  “What was it?” he asked, a little apprehensively.
Harry felt his scar.
!” Spragg said. “If there wasn’t a permission structure in the Auror Force that allows the persecution of a portion of our population that is weak and helpless and ignorant—”
“What?”
, she’d said once. Harry’s fingers moved over the back of his hand. “Malfoy knew that it would make it worse for me,” Harry said. “If Teddy had got into it with the other trainees.”
Malfoy set the beaker down with a clatter.  “Who told you that?” he asked.
“It’s cool.”  Teddy shrugged.  “Does Draco have piercings?”
“I started one.”
Malfoy sniffed. “Their crumpets are terrible.”
For some reason, Harry thought of the Timothy Tree, the gentle rain and chocolate, Malfoy like a ghost beside him.
“Maybe don’t point it at glass,” Harry suggested, because of how violently Malfoy was waving his wand.  With the way Malfoy was doing it, if the beaker ever did levitate it was going to go crashing down again almost immediately.
“In a week,” Draco said.
“Don’t.”  Harry made himself swallow his tears back, the choked little sob that was threatening.  “Don’t say that you were a burden.  I loved you—all through it.  Do you understand?  I loved
“Yeah.  Funny.  You know,” Harry went on.  “I’ve been looking into the Ludville case.”
“It’s making me,” Harry said breathlessly.  “It’s making me—”
Looking frightened, Draco demanded, “
“I’m not her kid,” Harry explained, deciding Mister Malfoy looked confused.  “I’ve got to earn my keep, so I had to do the washing up before I got any.  But by the time I got them done, it was all gone.”
“He hated us,” Harry said. “He was a Death Eater. He tried to kill you!”
“I’m not going to sell it, Draco.  I’m going to use it for your cure.”
Harry cast Notice-Me-Nots on the loo door.
“I don’t like it at all, Harry.  I wish I could take it off, but—it’s a part of my body, now, and so a part of me.”
Malfoy was flushed also, his hair almost bright with the lights and all the pink in his cheeks and clothes.
“No one thought you were a mewling infant,” Harry said.  “No one thought you were—”  He couldn’t remember the other name Draco had called himself.  “Wizarding children, if they saw how much your mother cared for you, they were jealous of you; they wished they had mums like yours.”
“We went to school together?” Harry said, thinking for a second Mister Malfoy must have been a teacher there.  But no, of course, they were meant to be the same age, which meant they had been in the same year.
“Can you give us a statement on Reveal?” asked the first.
Harry looked over his shoulder at Andromeda, who shrugged.  “It was his choice,” she said.
“He passed,” Harry said. “He was shaky in one section, but I held a practicum after—”
“Why not?” Harry had wanted to know. “They always have been.”
“But I’ve already waited.  Twelve years!”
“I don’t think my voice is right,” Harry said.  “Your voice was much nicer than this.”
“That’s not rude.”
“I’m not a very nice person,” Draco said, taking the metal bowl over to one of the black pots hanging on the bar over one of the hearths.  The rim of the bowl lined up with the rim of the pot so that when Draco set the bowl on top, the bowl balanced perfectly on top of the pot and didn’t fall in.
“I would love to,” Draco said, and he said it so sincerely that Harry believed him.  “But I have to work on this potion.  How about you read up until lunch-time, and then you can show me what you learned?  I can help you with anything you need then.”
Draco’s jaw dropped a fraction, his raised brows making his eyes so big.  “You will?”
“That’s a fantastic greeting, after not bothering to show for a week.”
“I didn’t say it would be easy,” said Yin. “Let’s take it apart, piece by piece. There seem to be a number of things you want and don’t want, or are not sure you want.”
Andromeda’s chimney piece had pictures—loads of them, a pretty lady with purple hair, a boy with wings, and a friendly-looking man with his arm around Andromeda when she was younger.  Standing on tip-toe, Harry looked around and behind the frames, moving them until he found the little bowl.  It was sitting behind a picture of the purple-haired woman, only in this one her hair was brown, her face was sad, and her belly was big.  The pot was an ugly thing that looked as though it had been made by hand, but in it was the same powder they’d used at Number Twelve.
Harry jerked again, made a sound. Draco must have known Harry would, because Draco used it like a distraction, hooking his finger under the waistband of the briefs and pulling them down, freeing Harry’s erection.
“That was dirty,” Harry pointed out.
“Remodelling takes a long time,” Malfoy said irritably.
“I think I’ve got a way to fix it, Harry,” Draco said, when they were lying in the dark.
“Of course, you can read; I meant—” Draco cut himself off.  “Never mind, Harry.  You don’t have to do a single thing you don’t want to, as long as you’re sure you don’t want to do it.”  Turning away, Draco tapped on the book, and it disappeared into thin air.
“Stop it,” Malfoy snapped, eyes flying open. “You haven’t got any right, to use that on me.”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Fuck. Yeah.” Then he pushed Draco back until the backs of Draco’s legs were against the bed. Harry gave him a little push, and getting the picture, Draco got on the bed, shirt still half undone.
“No,” Harry said, to this very unsubtle question.  “We never did.”
Harry tried to decide whether he felt anything about that.
“Did there used to be peacocks here?” Harry blurted, not even knowing he had been going to ask.
Malfoy opened his mouth. “Well—you wouldn’t know what it’s like, you not having had a mother of your own.”
The next day, however, he’d seen Malfoy in class, and he had remembered—in that way of dreams, the sudden dissonance of reality overlaid against something that wasn’t real but
“Malfoy.” Savage snorted. “It was probably him.”
“Of course, you would know the shops in Knockturn Alley,” Harry said, taking the phial.
He looked ghastly.
,” Harry said.
“What happened with Malfoy?”
“You’re one to talk,” Harry said, and Malfoy stared at him.
, Malfoy had said, but Harry thought maybe he had, a little bit. Malfoy had a boyfriend now, apparently; he had Astoria, and Teddy, and Nyala, and half the Level Ones worshipping at his feet; he had been disowned; he’d started wearing makeup. He didn’t really seem like the same person that he had been, and Harry drank his coffee supposing not enough had changed.
This was like talking to a hot boy Hermione, and Harry found he was maybe turned on. “Not exactly,” was all he said.
Harry knew this confusion.  He was so familiar with it, and when Draco was eleven and every year he’d remembered since then, Draco had talked around this as though it were perfectly acceptable to talk about which boys you found cute as long as you didn’t mention being attracted to them.  If Draco had ever mentioned it directly, he’d hurled slurs and insults, some of them as vicious as anything he’d ever said about Muggles or Hermione, and Harry had just assumed it would be a while until Draco outgrew that.  Perhaps he never had, and yet he’d talked about it so gently with Harry over that game of Exploding Snap, when Harry had been eleven and it hadn’t even occurred to him that gay people existed.
Something crushed down on Harry’s chest.
“Then what did they want you to be?”
“Good,” Draco said again. “So good, so beautiful, my good boy, my precious baby, yes, yes, so good for me—” Draco was dropping kisses on him as he babbled—helpless kisses, everywhere, all over Harry’s face, just like he couldn’t control it—again—
They came to him, but Harry didn’t want to put them on. He didn’t want to see. He wanted . . . Malfoy had given him something, for sleep paralysis. The potion was preventative; it had already happened. It had already happened. Harry wanted a cold shower. He wanted—
“That’s different.”
“No,” Harry said.  “But it’s very powerful.”
Draco turned toward him.  “I’m right here.”
As Harry looked at him, the unhappy expression faded from the man’s face—almost as though it had been folded up and put away, like a shirt.  The man straightened his shoulders, squaring them up.  He looked as though he had thought of something, or maybe decided something.  When he spoke again his voice was firm.  “You live with your uncle and aunt.  Don’t you?”
“I’ll come with you,” said Ron, already turning toward the stairwell.
“Owl?”
“Why did you cut it all off?”
“Cock,” Harry heard himself say. “Cock. Fucking. Fucking me, cock.”
Harry at last turned to face him.
Another silence followed. “Are you telling me about Bennet for a reason, Harry?” Kavika said quietly.
” he said and the writing disappeared. Slipping his wand back into his sleeve, Malfoy said, “Counterforce.”
The Academy could be that place. It had been for Malfoy, who had come in determined to prove a point to his father and make Harry Potter want him, and had come out someone different, someone who had learned the secret of the Timothy Tree, and freed it. Harry saw that smirk of triumph he had seen when Malfoy had beat him last year, the brightness in his eyes, the joy in his pink cheeks.
“I thought it was a game!”
“Positive.”  Draco beamed.  His bright hair with his white shirt, open at the throat, made him look like a model in a photo shoot.  “You have to beat me
“It means . . . Harry, Granger and Weasley—your two friends—both of them work for the Ministry.”
Harry hadn’t deluded himself that Malfoy was doing potions ID for him over the past year out of the goodness of his heart.  Malfoy was doing it because Harry had kept him out of Azkaban and testified at his mum’s trial.  Even though it hadn’t saved Narcissa from Azkaban, Harry’s testimony had shortened her sentence.  If only the potionologist at St Mungo’s had been a criminal too, Harry wouldn’t have to deal with Malfoy’s bullshit.
When Harry re-entered, the flat was what he supposed to be its normal size. Enlargement charms such as the ones Malfoy had used on his flat could be constructed far in advance, but you shouldn’t keep them active for too long. Forcing your walls for extended amounts of time into non-existent space could cause them to stretch, which led to sagging architecture. Harry had even heard of magical rooms bursting from time to time.
“Yes,” Harry said, jerking his eyes back to Malfoy’s arm. The drawing of the flower was delicate, thin red lines depicting a long stem, the unfurled petals around the centre flute. Then Harry saw it—the tell-tale ridge of skin. “Malfoy,” he breathed, then touched the shape of the flower. The drawing had not been done with ink. It was a scar.
“Fuck,” Draco said again. “Harry, fuck.” Then his hands were in Harry’s hair, pulling, tugging. “Fuck,” Draco said, squirming under him. “Don’t stop. Please don’t stop.”
Harry squeezed Daco’s arse. “You said I wasn’t.”
“My hair.”
Now that Harry thought about it, he had no idea why he’d come.  He knew nothing about mums dying, after all.  He knew nothing about mums.  He knew nothing about
“Ew,” Harry opined.
“Words,” Malfoy said, bending over his microscope.
Harry’s eyes went large.  “Me?”
Malfoy put out his hand.
“Harry.”  Hermione put her arm around his shoulder, her voice soft and wet.
“That’s not what I—”
The bedroom door was open. Malfoy’s bed was slim and narrow, only just wide enough for him to turn over, and short—perhaps not even long enough for all of him. On it was another knit blanket. The sight of the bed made Harry’s heart constrict, but Malfoy wasn’t in it. He wasn’t in the room at all, and then Harry found another door—this one ajar as well. From the sliver of light spilling from it, Harry could see that it was the loo. Perhaps he shouldn’t go in; perhaps he should—but his hand was already pushing it open a little more, and Malfoy was standing there, in front of the sink, his hands gripping the edge of it. He stood before a mirror, and Harry remembered sixth year.
“Draco,” Harry said, suddenly wishing he could hold him.
“Yes.  Draco,” Harry said, a little impatiently, “I didn’t lie about everything.  I just let you think—some things—that weren’t exactly true.”
“Because I haven’t
“Yes.”
Malfoy wasn’t even looking. He was already talking to Nyala, his smile sunny, tipping his head back to laugh about the fact that they had taken stances standing far too close together.
Several pairs of eyes grew in size; half of the reporters turned to Malfoy, and Harry grabbed the broom.
“Draco,” Harry said.  “Plenty of people who weren’t involved in the war were killed by Voldemort and his followers.  Dozens of innocent Muggles were killed.”
“A potions accident,” Draco said.
We will find grace, Hermione said.
“Who knows what Bennet’s parents were like?” Harry asked. “Or Spragg’s, for that matter? Spragg’s were magical, but I still have no idea.”
“Thank you for your gift of the Sweet Dreams. I did not adequately express my gratitude for your thoughtfulness, as I was distracted by a myriad of considerations. One such is the thought that I have known about Sweet Dreams since I was fifteen, and it seems you have not. I found myself wishing, once more, most keenly, that I had sought to know you better then, when I was fifteen; that I had sought to help you, rather than hinder you and hurt you and humiliate you. Would that I had been a better person for your sake, if not my own.
This case was bigger than Ludville, however.  According to Ludville’s statement, Vance had been involved in illegal potions trade for years—and Savage hadn’t just happened to have cerulean paint at her desk.  It was possible she’d used it before, and she and Vance were connected somehow.  Going to Kirkley Zidwidley at Records and Filing, Harry asked (loudly) to see every case in which Savage had administered the indicator solution.
The next day Harry got a package from Malfoy—the green potion, together with a note:
Harry resisted rolling his eyes. “Malfoy.”
The provocation went out of Malfoy’s body like a candle suddenly snuffing out.  Malfoy’s face fell, and something in Harry’s chest twisted.  “I haven’t.”  For once Malfoy sounded so unguarded.
The fox put a careful paw on Draco’s thigh.
“I know him. I could see it.”
“Draco,” Harry said.  “I’d like to do those shield spells on you.”
Malfoy was doing it now, hands moving rapidly as he discussed the opening days of the courses non-magical education centres would present. The Order had agreed that these initial courses would be offered continuously in the beginning, since many non-magical people were bound to have thousands of questions the day of Reveal. “Maybe we could have something like Orientation at Academy,” Malfoy was saying, “where instead of going from instructor to instructor, perhaps the non-magicals could visit different important magical sites: the Ministry, Hogwarts, the Academy—”
Harry could feel how hot he was now, blood pumping desperately to escape his skin, escape, escape. He couldn’t Apparate within the Academy, and the doors were too crowded with too many people to stop him on the way. Harry just needed a minute to himself, just a minute to think and be alone and catch his breath, just a minute without anyone else, the toilet. He needed to get to the toilet, just for a minute alone.
“I didn’t mean—” Nyala began.
Deep inside, Harry had already known that Malfoy was right, that the Academy—which Harry had loved, had considered a home—had been built on blood and sacrifice. Still, seeing this ghost—seeing Timothy—Harry felt shocked that he hadn’t known, had never even suspected what the tree really held. It had taken Malfoy, himself uprooted and remade, to see the truth.
“Oh, Harry.”  Draco touched the side of Harry’s face, cupping his chin gently.  “I didn’t—I didn’t care what you thought of me.”  His hand fell away.  “I just wanted you to be happy.”
Malfoy’s shoulders sagged. They had already agreed Apparating non-magicals early on would not be a good idea. Mark had pointed out plenty of non-magicals would treat it like a ride; Fairchild had pointed out that Apparition could be terrifying, especially if you didn’t even know magic existed. Achar had brought up the ethics of performing magic on non-magical people, even with their consent.
is Reveal, and the world’s gone to shite, and what if Granger doesn’t win the election; this whole thing is bollocksed—”
Mister Malfoy whirled around.  “We should leave.”
That made it sound like Ron still sort of thought that Harry did, but denying it again would sound too insistent, so instead Harry looked down at the dirt for signs of gnomes. “All right.”
A suspect had given it to Harry two days ago, before her illegal faeries had burst out of a cupboard and Harry had arrested her.  In spite of the faeries, Harry had thought nothing of the tea, but he’d felt strange since that evening.  Over the past day, he’d developed a weird cough and random chills, and Harry had nothing better to do than pursue the tea lead to uncover possible further wrongdoing.
,” said Harry. “Draco Malfoy was part of a murdering death cult. He tried to kill my best friend. He let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He stepped on my face. He tried to get my friend sacked. He—”
Malfoy just shrugged. “Tried it. I tried everything. For the insomnia.”
sort of pure-blood.”
“Harry, I don’t care about the jar.”  Draco-in-Harry’s-body came a little closer, and now that he sounded less distressed and more concerned, he looked nicer too.  The lines in his harsh face softened, though Harry still thought he looked a bit wild.
, Potter—Muggle
“They’re right here.”  Harry set the jar on the table, hesitating.  “I hate your job at Slug and Jiggers,” he said, after a moment.  “Your boss is abusive.”
Harry decided to try it.
Malfoy gave a lazy shrug.  “I’m sure we could have even less in common than I do with Vince and Greg.  I just wish Greg would pick up a book a time or two.  It’s very boring having no one to talk to you about things you’ve read.  Theo reads, but he doesn’t . . .”
Harry wanted to say, but that wasn’t fair.  The flat belonged to Draco, even if he wasn’t the correct age, and Draco was right.  Since Draco wouldn’t be ageing up for at least a day, and Harry could be some distance from him when Draco did it, Harry should go do what he could to see if he could bust the illegal potions ring.  Hermione and Ron were still under whatever potion had caused them to act the way they had.
Draco ’s hand gripped Harry’s hair. “I’m going to watch that over and over again in a Pensieve,” Draco said. “Harry Potter busy sucking my cock while a big thick toy slams his pussy from behind and absolutely nails him, and he just takes it. He takes it moaning like a whore.”
“I could be persuaded,” Teddy said, as easily as he said everything, but Harry could tell he was pleased. Taking Nyala’s hand, they turned toward the dance floor. “Tell Vinicius sorry,” Teddy said over his shoulder, as Nyala swept him away.
Draco’s eyes widened, his face flushed, his lips still parted.  “Oh my days.  You’re not—you’re not
“Pardon me, but there aren’t dark wizards any more,
Harry whirled around.
Bloody fucking hell.  Harry hadn’t been that worried about it, possibly because Draco hadn’t written,
“Where is he?” Harry asked, advancing towards Alby.
Harry looked at Draco’s shining eyes, his red mouth, his contorted expression.  His thin chest was still moving too rapidly.  “I’m going to leave,” Harry said.  “I’ll come back tomorrow.”
"Harry," Dudley called out, and Harry turned around.  "Thank you.  For—for all of it.  For my life, and for Julia, and for—for my mum and dad.  You didn’t have to do it.”
“Why—why did you pick him anyway?  He’s not
Draco looked extremely interested in this.  “Some kind of dark artefact?”
“Thanks,” muttered Malfoy.
“Sometimes,” Harry said.
“That one you did.”
Harry swallowed a sigh.  “I know.”
The flat was a disaster, the wall between the sitting room and Malfoy’s bedroom pulled down, lying in rubble on the floor.  Malfoy was nowhere in sight, and Harry checked downstairs, just to be sure.  Several times over the past year, it had looked like Malfoy had come up from there—but he wasn’t there either.  Potage’s Cauldron Shop was gone, however, hollowed out as though it had never been there.  Empty walls surrounded three empty hearths, the shop window still fitted with diamond-shaped panes that faced the street.  Harry wondered how long the shop had been closed down.
But the tea hadn’t been poisoned.  Harry didn’t want Malfoy touching him, but Harry wasn’t sick.  He’d never been sick, except for that time all the bones in his arm broke second year, but that had been Malfoy’s fault, and that time he’d died in the forest, only that had been Voldemort’s fault.  It wasn’t Harry’s fault; he hadn’t
“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around the man to see if he could find another exit.
“I think that’s very understandable,” Duggins said, and Harry’s heart sank.
to you, it matters whether you can get ahead.  And you can’t do that if no one likes you.”
Harry followed Malfoy’s instructions to the letter.
Harry felt his mouth twist into a smile. “You like to rub it in, don’t you?”
“We can’t get there by Apparition.  I made a Portkey.” Harry held a coin in his gloved hand.
Then Malfoy put the cork in the bottle and slipped the bottle into his pocket.  “I’ll get you the ID by tomorrow.”
Harry wanted to put his head over the side to hear better, but instead he lay very still, hardly breathing so he would be sure to hear the secret.
“I know.”
Malfoy had changed into his usual attire, which consisted of finely tailored wizard robes that looked like they were from the sixteenth century. The one today was a deep green with a high collar and lots and lots of laces. It would have looked very nice on someone who didn’t have Draco Malfoy’s unfortunate face. “You wanted to see me?” Malfoy said lazily.
“And does the relief of having him gone outweigh how bad it could also make you feel?”
“Yes.”  Harry was still panting.  “Yes, I like it.  I like it—a lot.”
“Accio lube,” Draco said, taking his hand off for a moment.
“Oh,” said Ron.
“When I grow up.”  Draco’s voice was oddly steady.  “How about now?”
“What are you going to do to us?”
Harry remembered, just as he said, “Come in.”
Harry didn’t know who he wanted to be; he was thirty-seven. He should know by now, but how could he know; why should he know, when Kavika had
Malfoy shot Harry a sardonic look, but Mrs. Mulpepper sniffled.  “Helping?”
“I think we need to go on a little trip,” Draco said, directly after lunch.
Quick-Quotes Quills scribbled furiously, while shutters clicked over and over again on wizard cameras—click, click, click.
“Yes, well.”  Draco picked up some of the papers, rifling through them.  “I would say your frame of reference is rather skewed, at this age.”  Tossing the papers back down, he turned on his heel and headed toward the door.  “Come along, Harry.  There isn’t anything here.”
As the other side of Harry’s mouth curved up, he noticed the shape of Yin’s face once more—a perfect oval, which made the features of their face appear placed just so. They were less plain that he had initially supposed, their eyes bright like a night in a faerie parade, their mouth lush and expressive.
Travers gave a shrug that seemed calculated to look self-deprecating, but only served to make him seem more arrogant. “Like you said. I got their attention.”
28 years
“I said he was fine; didn’t I?”
Malfoy was often by Teddy’s side, for some reason—in Wandless Combat, but then sometimes Harry saw them in the corridors—not always together, but a few times. He even once saw them talking together under the Timothy Tree, its leaves a carpet of brown and red at their feet, Teddy’s hair sunny blond next to Malfoy’s duller colour. Teddy sometimes unconsciously mirrored people he spent time with in physical appearance, but Harry had never seen Teddy do it with anyone he didn’t like.
Harry remembered looking into ingredients from that region before.  The Slumber Slam had had scopolamine, a chemical extracted from a Central American tree, but Harry had investigated Slumber Slam long before Malfoy had developed that indicator solution.  Harry had to go farther back in time, getting more old cases from Records and Filing.  Slowly, the office at Grimmauld Place became full of boxes as Harry found other connections: the petrification poison made from elkhorn coral, found in the Caribbean Sea, the tortoise scales in the Forgetfulness Potion, the coca in Dream Dram.  Even the swamp-things whose bogies had been in the Ragerade were swamp-things from Florida.
“Think up that happy memory.”
, in love with
“Some say it’s worse.”
“What?” said Nyala, as Harry turned back to them.
Harry stood up, heading for the door.
Draco played with something on his cuff, as if it wasn’t quite straight or even, but everything about Draco was always perfect, so Harry wasn’t sure what he was doing.  Draco went on, “Father bought me almost everything in Diagon Alley, for my first day.  He said he wanted me to be prepared, and that I—I was well off, and should look it, and that the other children should—they should look up to me.  But I realize now that what he meant was that he wanted me to be comfortable and make friends, and that—that he was proud of me.”
thing; it has to push the Force and the Academy out of existence. Why is Spragg even here, if he just wants to pull the whole thing down?”
“What are you doing?” Harry put down his wand. “You’re not a Death Eater.”
my older self.”
,” he murmured.
Malfoy swallowed.
“I’ve got to do these potions,” he said, sniffing a bit.
“Let me take it off you,” Harry said, coming toward him.
Harry had never had anyone read to him before, except sometimes in year one of primary school, when the teacher would read a book at the front of the class and show the pictures.  “Would you do the voices?” Harry asked, temporarily forgetting his reservations and squirming even closer.  “Like your dad did?”
It was painful, Harry realized.  He was feeling pain.  It hurt, particularly since he’d just realized how much he himself hadn’t minded kissing Malfoy.  He hadn’t minded in the least.
is some kind of equivalent to
Harry tried to picture saying 'suitable attire' as an eleven-year-old and couldn’t.  In some ways Draco was strikingly like Hermione when she had been eleven, only she’d never talked about popping off to France or Belgium, and The Floating Monk was one of the most upscale restaurants Harry knew about.  “I’m afraid,” Harry said, trying to think about how he should phrase this, “we shouldn’t go out.”
“I wasn’t showing off. This is my natural state.” Malfoy must have looked back up to gauge his surroundings, because the view in the IC:WUT/UC showed two of the Aurors putting the remaining NDEs in Body-Binds and a third Auror checking the room for any other hidden dangers. Ron, who had just finished collecting the wand of an unconscious witch, looked around, and, seeing Malfoy, came closer in the IC:WUT/UC view.
.  Draco had shielded Harry with his body when Vance had tried to attack; he’d read to Harry with all the voices.  He’d taken Harry flying, and taught him the colour spells.  He’d made cake and hot chocolate, and Harry remembered Draco with that splash of chocolate on his face, smiling down at Harry.
Harry gave him a look.
“By then, it will be too late,” Travers said. “They’re trying to get Reveal this summer.”
“If you sat closer, I could put this part of it on your lap,” Draco went on, demonstrating by budging closer.  “And here so we’re not squashed, I’ll put my arm around you this way, and you can turn the pages.”
“It’s inventory,” Malfoy said, his voice patronizing.
“Angry! It makes me angry! He shouldn’t
“Yes, and you would like me to think it’s about that,” Harry said.  “Everyone would like me to think it was about that.  I almost wish it was, as it would make some sense.  But no, this is about the fact that you used to get Galleons from Savage for your potions consulting, and now you don’t.  Malfoy is costing you, so you’ve told him not to help me, and you punish him when he does.”
I’d still like to be friends with you.”  Harry looked down at the pictures.  “Does this make us related?  Because you have Blacks in your family?”
“Harry!”  A shocked silence followed, then a rushed: “Is Dudley okay?”
Draco blinked, then pulled away from Harry’s thigh. When he looked back, his eyes were larger, his mouth somehow redder. “You want,” he croaked, then cleared his throat. Then his hands were like claws on Harry’s thighs, his hips, Draco scrambling up Harry’s body until he stood on his own two feet. “That’s something you—is that something you want?” Draco’s breath was harsh, his hands still gripping Harry’s hips, his body swaying close. “To get fucked?”
Perhaps he needn’t have bothered, as Draco didn’t say anything.  Perhaps he hadn’t heard.
“Edgar Travers? Over there.” Malfoy waved vaguely in the direction of the figure Harry had been watching earlier.
At the top of the stairs, Harry walked down the corridor to his office. His door was ajar, and as he pushed it open, he felt premonition sweep upon him. Last year, on this same day of graduation, Malfoy had been waiting here in Harry’s office. Here, he had told Harry he was in love with him. That he would always love him. That he knew him, top to bottom.
non-magical!” said a father, horrified.
, Malfoy had said. Harry had simply assumed that Malfoy was mocking him.
“I know,” Harry said again. His hand moved over the back of his fist. “I sometimes don’t always know how, but I try. I’m trying.”
At its base, on the bench, sat Draco Malfoy, leaning against the trunk, a book in his lap, dull blond hair bent to peer at the pages as though he belonged there, under Harry’s tree. In fact, Malfoy looked almost peaceful there, like some kind of pastoral ideal of a student, reading on the green, the arched cloisters rising behind him. He looked like he belonged, and Harry felt resentment rise hard and strong in his chest, a clawing anger.
Harry’s voice was strangled; he couldn’t get enough air. “You’re so fucking hot,” he managed to say.
Malfoy’s jaw snapped shut.
Draco gave a weak laugh.  “I’m a fucking mess.”
“And yet I have to look at your face every day in the
Malfoy blinked. “Of course,” he said, taking out his wand again to remove the warming charm he had placed on Harry.
“Come on, Malfoy,” said Harry.
Draco had called it, but Harry had never read the files Draco had taken from his desk at the Ministry.  Still, perhaps there was something in the papers Vance had had that would help.  After all, Vance was obviously doing something wrong, having broken into Harry’s house and casting that spell Draco had said was dark.  Maybe there was something in these papers about him.
“You still think I won’t like you.”
“It looks very handsome,” Draco added.
“Why did you do that?” Draco said, staring blankly down at the fox.
Harry realized he wasn’t sitting at the table. He was in another room, an auditorium, watching the table on a Pensieve projector. He was under the stairs, listening to an argument about what was to be done to address funny business—the funny business of his hair, of the snake at the zoo, of the owls, of his life.
The rainy November rolled into a sleet-filled December, its opening days immediately unpleasant with ice so heavy Harry had had to cast a warming spell on his door to open it. The weather seemed to match his mood, which felt dreary with Fudge’s victory, the loss of Kavika, and an ever-present suspicion that Teddy was up to no good. When the time for the Academy holiday party came around, Harry wasn’t really interested in going, not in the least because Fudge would likely be there, and—so far—Harry had avoided the sight of his pudgy face. Vinicius had wanted to go, however, and Teddy would be there, which was how Harry found himself now, standing against the wall with his boyfriend.
Andromeda smiled.  “Yes.  I think we should.”
“What?  I mean.  Pardon?”
“It’s okay,” Mister Malfoy said, taking his hand away and standing up straight.  Then his arm was moving, and Harry stumbled back, putting up an arm to protect his glasses.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Yeah. I mean, I haven’t thought about it much. I’m just glad Malfoy isn’t into me anymore.”
Examinations for Level Ones had already been held, and once more, Malfoy had not been able to cast a Patronus for his. Perhaps he was here to beg improved marks, or perhaps he was just leaving a cup of coffee. Harry rather hoped that Malfoy was here to beg, as Harry had never caught him in the act of leaving the coffee before, and even though Harry had known all along that Malfoy was responsible, actual proof would make it more depressing.
Harry’s head snapped up.  He’d still been sitting on the bed, waiting for Draco to wake up, but Draco hadn’t gasped and sat up like he had the first two times.  His eyes were open, but he was just lying there, looking down his nose at Harry.  It had got longer, his nose.
The time between each unconscious spell was growing longer now, just as Draco had said it would.  Fifteen-year-old Draco had come into being quite late in the evening; therefore, the wait for the next spell of unconsciousness was through the wee hours of the night.
Malfoy’s cheeks were still flushed from before, but Harry saw that the softer tone had had its effect.
Malfoy’s grey eyes looked straight into him. Then, slipping his wand into his sleeve, Malfoy turned away. “It’s not only non-mags who stand to be vulnerable in a partial Reveal,” he said. “If a gun is a deadly weapon some non-mags own, a wand is a deadly weapon children receive for their eleventh birthday.”
Draco’s breath caught again, this time with a little noise at the back of his throat. “I—yes,” he said, breathlessly. “Yes. Harry.”
Excited by the prospect of lunch, Harry said okay.
“I like all kinds of partners,” Harry told Malfoy flatly. “That’s already in the history books.”
“You know how I feel about you.  Do you really think I go around thinking those kinds of things about you?”
“You don’t!”  Draco pushed Harry again, right in the stomach.
“No.”  Harry shook his head vehemently.  “Never.”
“Hullo,” Malfoy said, “I’m Auror Malfoy, and this is the non-mag I’ve saved from certain death.” The reporters all circled him. “In case you’re wondering, yes, I
“That’s chapter four,” Draco said.  “Chapter four’s the best so far.”
“Don’t mention it,” said Ron.
“Astoria?” Ron’s brow furrowed. “Greengrass?”
The blue flames finally faded in the hearth.
“I just . . .” Harry picked up the smoothie again. He’d put it down at some point. “I notice it more. I used to notice it, but . . .” Harry put down the smoothie. “He told me he was in love with me.”
Harry swallowed hard.  “It does?”  Mister Malfoy nodded, and Harry tentatively reached out to take the wand on the table.  When he touched it, the room brightened, a rush of warmth and energy rushing through Harry.  “Wow,” he breathed.
“Sometimes.”
“But not everyone does,” Hermione said, understanding.
That night Harry checked the warehouse on Colville Road with the Seeing-Eye Ball.  Observing that no one seemed to be in the lab, Harry returned with his Invisibility Cloak and picked up the Ward Record, drawing memories from the Eye back into a jar.  Harry would have to review all the records of the past few days in a Pensieve to see whether anyone else besides Vance had gone into the warehouse, so Harry put a new Ward Record on the Seeing-Eye Ball to record anything that happened that night or the next day.
“You’re not married,” Harry said, partly out of morbid curiosity to see how Malfoy would react.
, Harry wanted to say.
“My poor Harry. Do you need me to take care of you?”
“Yes, well.” Harry frowned, disgruntled. “I can’t ask him to stop talking to Teddy.”
, which I think we can agree covers the majority of the magical population, on either pole.”
“We like London.” Luna’s voice was always a little slow, a little soft. “We like how bright and busy it is. We wanted to be a part of it. We don’t like how dirty it is. How unkind. We also wanted not to be a part of it.”
Malfoy tilted his head, every bone in his body completely disingenuous. “Like what?”
happy,” said Harry.  “And then you left.  On our in-between birthday.”
“In society,” Kavika said. “Not in your heart. You don’t have to learn to love Draco Malfoy, Harry. You don’t even have to accept the new person that he is.”
“And his feelings for you are shameful?”
The spoon clattered in the little sugar bowl.  “He . . . roughhouses?”
“It’s . . .”  Harry swallowed.  “It’s fine.  I just—I didn’t expect to look like that.”
“You know how to use a Floo,” Harry said, taking off into the air, sailing over the heads of the reporters through the Pallas Arch to the safety of the Academy grounds. Behind him, the reporters who had turned to watch him go joined their colleagues, who were all talking to Malfoy now, and Malfoy seemed to be loving the attention.
“You want him to win awards? Get a parade? Is that what you got first year? Second? Third?”
of non-mags, eager to see what magic streets and shops looked like. Though the area around Rombe Pickle was still peaceful, Harry could already begin to see the shape of future turmoil; the non-magical road running alongside the village was backed up over a kilometer; non-magical people who had already been spoken to by members of the Order were waiting to catch glimpses of more magic, some of them clamouring to see something new.
“You know,” Harry said.  “They’re mainly yellow, and they’ve got a big shovel attached.”
“Expelliarmus,” Harry told another wizard a few metres away, halfway through casting Cruciatus at a non-mag. Almost simultaneously, a silver shield popped into existence around Teddy and Harry, and an Avada Kedavra bounced off of them. The wand of wizard Harry had just disarmed floated from its owner to Harry, and in the other direction, Harry found Malfoy on his broomstick, who had cast the Protego, now disarming the witch who had cast the AK.
“Right,” Mister Malfoy said.  “And you realize that if you did get sick, you sometimes need someone to—to help you?”
“Malfoy, you’re
Even though Draco was already pink, he still flushed again. His body was radiating heat like a furnace; Harry was beginning to sweat even though he hadn’t done anything. “It’s just—not what I had in mind,” Draco said, sounding so unhappy. “I don’t even like the word dick.”
“A little.”
Harry could not believe what he was hearing, except he could. Of course, he could. This explained exactly why the Ministry had become what it had, so many of them neo-purist isolationists skirting the edge of blood supremacy. To think Harry had been worried about Bennet, who—while insulting towards non-mags—ostensibly had their better interests at heart. “You want Malfoy to be an Auror so he’ll support a purist agenda,” Harry said, just to be sure.
“I see you finally brought your boyfriend,” the woman added, dark eyes sliding over to Harry.
“No,” Draco said slowly, confusion painting his features.  “The first storey was built to be a flat.  The ground level is a shop.”
“You knew my parents?” Harry asked quickly.
Rolling her eyes, Hermione said, “He’s already been sentenced for that.  Last I heard, he was following the restriction and keeping his head down.  You said so yourself.”
“No. I’m just . . . not sure why. I was with him over a year.”
“Sure,” Harry said.  “The beard might be a trick, but I can do all that.  Will you go with me?”
“You could use it to hold balloons,” Teddy was saying. “You could make a butterfly cage. You could use it to hold down soil.”
Jumping up, Harry realized he wasn’t in his own pyjamas either.  He didn’t even have pyjamas, just old shorts, and sometimes Dudley’s castoffs—but these were real pyjamas, soft and warm and cottony.  White, with blue stripes.  Mister Malfoy must have done it, and panicking, Harry remembered bad old men, but he was more concerned about the bed, which he shouldn’t have slept in.  He’d told Mister Malfoy—
,” the letter said, and reading this made Harry feel better. “
“It was Astoria’s dad’s,” Malfoy said, sounding strangely strained.
Taking out his wand, Malfoy pointed it at the wall. “
“Third year,” Harry said.
“Malfoy Manor getting torn down is not sad,” Ron said.  “You were tortured there, and Voldemort lived there, and Dobby was kept there against his will—not to mention Luna and Ollivander and that lot, and it was ugly anyway.”
“It’s still you!” Harry called back.
“Yes, you’ve told me,” Malfoy bit out, “because you know it will always make me your slave.”
A popping sound filled the air, Aurors beginning to fill the street. “He’s going to get away,” Teddy said.
For the first time, Malfoy hesitated.  “I can’t,” he said finally.
“Do you ever get punished for this?”  Draco said, next time Harry woke him to feed him water biscuits and juice.  “Slicing me open, I mean.”
“What?” Pausing, Nyala turned back.
Why sacrifice himself, if he could sacrifice others?
Rune had broken up with Malfoy at the end of summer. It had been in
“I know exactly what happened!” cried Savage.
Draco had called him an abomination.  He’d called Harry sick and perverted.  Draco was fourteen, and he was clinging to Harry’s robes, Draco’s fists making wads of Harry’s Auror cloak, and Harry didn’t know what to do.  Draco had said he’d hated him; he’d tried to run away from him.  He couldn’t want to be touched—but Harry wanted to comfort him.  He still wanted to, after everything.  Tentatively, his hand touched Draco’s hair.
Harry licked the come off of him, but he couldn’t find much of it—Draco had done it everywhere; it could be on the walls, the ceiling, with the way Draco had shot off, and Draco kept carding his hands through Harry’s hair saying, “Harry. Harry.” At last Draco tugged and Harry went, Draco manhandling him again, arranging him into a position—Harry on his side, Draco behind him curled against him, Draco’s leg over both of Harry’s, tugging them against Draco’s other leg possessively, Draco’s arm over Harry’s waist, hand on Harry’s chest. No one had ever spooned Harry like this before; he was fairly large. He’d always done it the other way; it had just seemed natural.
“But . . .” Draco bit his lip.  “You’re meant to be my friend.”
During this conversation the fox had unwrapped from its ball, shaking itself out for a yawn.  Now it stood there staring at Harry, as though accusing.  Draco didn’t look at him at all, reminding Harry a bit of Rose.  When she was angry with Ron or Hermione, she stopped talking to them completely.  “Have I done something wrong?” Harry finally asked, at a loss.
killed,” Ron said, still bristling. “Jolly good, as usual.”
“We’ll also have to . . .” Draco coughed a bit.  “Er, they used to check wands at the Ministry.  For security measures.  A wizard’s wand is personal, but would you mind . . .” Pausing as though he couldn’t finish, Draco pulled his wand out of his sleeve, and at last Harry got it.
Malfoy hadn’t quite said rude, that time Harry had told him he should take off his tightly lacked coat so he could better relax and cast his Patronus. “Impolite?” Harry hazarded.
Molly was often up at ungodly hours of the morning. He could go to her and have a cuppa. She would be glad to see him. But at four-oh-eight? “Time,” Harry said, because maybe it was five.
,” Draco spat, in such a familiar way that Harry flinched.
Malfoy nodded. “Not Baggot, but can’t win them all.”
Outside, Diagon Alley was bright, and Harry felt glad to be out of the dim little shop with that horrible little man and Malfoy.  As Harry made his way to Knockturn Alley to check out the place Malfoy had mentioned, he realized he again felt almost sorry for Malfoy, having to deal with Alby.  Now that Harry knew Alby had been the one to complain to Robards about Harry seeing Malfoy, Harry thought it made perfect sense.  Robards might be less obvious than Alby in his smallness and pettiness, but both of them were alike in their concern with the appearance of things, their shallow attempts at politeness while they undermined decent people just trying to do their jobs—
Harry said, speaking with effort, “You don’t believe that.”
Andromeda had said.
“Which class?”
“Who is this?”  And suddenly, she
“Yeah, it is,” Ron said, squeezing Harry’s shoulder.
Harry did his best to look innocent.
“I don’t
“He doesn’t have to do anything new to bother you, Harry,” Kavika said.
“Right, sure, pamphlets will fix them right up.” Though Malfoy turned his head over his shoulder, his tone was caught by the rush of wind.
“Where?” Draco asked.
“I’m more intelligent, I expect.”
“No,” Harry said.  “You can read it.”
Hermione laughed, looking at the arching cerulean lines of her daughter’s painting.  “Oh, Harry, how unlike you to notice.”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t have anything to say.”
“What?” Malfoy asked.
Harry looked up at him.  “To go to my house?”
“Newborn baby tears,” Malfoy said, his tone almost bored.  “They taste delicious.  Potter, you better give me that potion before puppies die and the blood of innocents is awash in the streets.”  Not even looking at him, Malfoy held out his hand.
write papers, and Harry thought about what adult-Draco would say—
“Because of your mum?”
Harry’s heart did a hard thump, and he recognized it as embarrassment—for himself, this time. He had been thinking about sex. Friendship hadn’t occurred to him.
“I want to go home,” Draco said.
Ginny had told him once, but he wasn’t.  He wasn’t; he was perfectly normal about it; it was just that it was
“But we’re friends now,” Harry said hopefully, wishing Draco would look over at him.  He didn’t know why.  He just thought it would be nice, because Draco’s eyes were very nice, and Harry liked for Draco to be pleased.  He hoped Draco was pleased about being friends, but Draco was busy opening another drawer.
Draco really did like Harry to play with it, Harry thought, and this thought made Harry come, spurting it in Draco hot mouth. Moaning again, Draco took it, swallowed, then took some more, trying to get it all as Harry’s thrusts became erratic, licking and then nuzzling at Harry all through it.
“You made it for me when I was little,” Harry said.
Harry couldn’t find Malfoy amidst the crowd, but Rune was distinctly visible in black and gold robes that made him look like Hufflepuff’s fittest bloke since Cedric Diggory, except Cedric had been a child, and Rune was very noticeably a man. He was talking to someone, hands moving with his contagious enthusiasm, cheeks a bit dark with humour or pleasure.
The pants were some kind of breeches, made of something smooth and fine-threaded.  The belt that had been doing such a poor job of holding them up had a gold-coloured buckle, done up over the soft tunic he was wearing.  They were very nice clothes, Harry was realizing, not scratchy or falling apart at the seams at all, except for maybe the socks.  Those were orange wool, rather knobbly, as though someone had knit them.  Despite the fact that they were ugly, however, they were doing an excellent job of keeping his feet warm, even though he was standing on cobbles in the middle of the night.
In the end, Teddy was the one to corner Fenrir. He was joined by Ron and Susan Bones, who helped disarm the werewolf and take him into custody. Meanwhile, Malfoy had managed to capture another member of Fenrir’s team, and Ron was furious. “If they had
“Yes,” Harry agreed.  “You’re very discreet.”
Harry wasn’t looking, and so he didn’t see Malfoy until he was just a meter from him.
Harry didn’t even know whether Draco was teasing him; he didn’t care. He got the final button open and at last, at last, he could open Draco’s shirt, look at him, his chest—his scars.
A sharp
“Yes.” Malfoy waggled his fingers, a dismissive gesture. “Whatever you think.”
Malfoy shuddered—probably didn’t want Potter-breath on him, or similar rot; it was amazing how all the sudden being around Malfoy made Harry feel as though nothing at all had changed since school. So much for ignoring each other. “I’m going to put my arm around you,” Harry reminded him again.
“I consider you a friend,” Harry said at last.
First of the term, before the trainees came to know him, was always hardest. Getting an answer to a question from a famous person was a prize, a privilege, something to win, and so many people wanted to win—to win him or win against him. The problem was that Harry couldn’t even blame them. To them he was not a person; he was an icon. That was how they taught about the war in school, in the books. When were all these children meant to realize he was a human being? They didn’t mean to hurt him, and they were so young. They didn’t know what it had been like. He should allow them their curiosity. Allow them their innocence. Allow them to learn and ask and know and take from him, take from him, take from him.
“A child you don’t like.”
“Draco?” said the woman, coming in from the sitting room.  Harry recognized her now—Florina Fortescue, sister of Florean Fortescue.  Their ice cream empire had made the family filthy rich; they’d probably bought the Parkinson place after the Parkinsons had abandoned it.  “Like the Death Eater?” Florina asked.
“Draco,” Harry said, then thrashed wildly and came, hips pumping erratically under Draco, coming out in spurts between them—into Draco’s hand at first, between them, but then on Draco’s belly, his chest. Draco arched, just as though he wanted it all over him, and Harry groaned, unable to watch. Draco was too gorgeous to watch.
“Heavens.  Dumbledore deserved to be sacked.”
The view on the IC:WUT/UC swung away again, showing the door, the marbles. “Really, any time now.” Malfoy’s voice was tremulous under his breath.
“Thank you,” Harry said.  “I think.”
32 years
“I might have thought differently about the size of my dating pool, is all.”
“I’m twenty-one.”
“How come there are three?” Harry asked.  “I thought you were making an indicator thing.”
“Yeah.”  Harry went on eating the curry Draco had made for lunch.  Draco never let him choose lunch anymore either, but everything Draco made was always the best thing Harry had ever tasted. Harry was beginning to suspect Draco didn’t much like Harry’s choices of meals, which was just fine with Harry.  He’d never had so many nice foods before, or else he might’ve known to ask for things other than fish and chips.
But Malfoy came out to the front, still looking ghastly.  His skin was pulled so tight over his face his head looked like a skull, and Harry realized what had made his shoulders look so sharp—Malfoy was thin.  Rather desperately thin, and he’d always been wiry.  It wasn’t a good look on him.  Neither were the hollows under his eyes, which reminded Harry of sixth year.  His mouth was a sullen little line, but that wasn’t any different to how he used to look.
“I’m sorry.”  Harry pulled Draco closer again, his hand in Draco’s hair letting Draco know he could put his head back against Harry’s chest, his face against Harry’s neck if he wanted.  “I’m sorry,” Harry said again.  “It’s stupid.  It’s going to sound so stupid to you.”
“Been there, done that.” Malfoy’s voice was bright, like a joke. “You’re the reason I can’t do it, so what help could you possibly be?”
“You want me to do it? I’ll do it,” Malfoy said, beginning to saunter through the trainees. Bennet had moved back before the boggart had finished its transformation, and so the boggart had reverted into the rats in frilly dresses taking tea and crumpets, which had been the result of Wan’s Riddikulus.
“Harry.  Everyone admired you.”
Teddy just shrugged. “The ward drops were bollocksing the potential for the Deal. I wanted to unbollocks it.”
Malfoy was standing so close, and tears were running down his face, arms wrapped tight about himself.  Harry tried not to even breathe, lest his breath get on Malfoy, and then Malfoy would remember that Harry’s way of saying 'sorry your mum died' had been to bring him a job to do.
“You do realize you’re . . . allowed to be ill.  Getting sick isn’t your fault.”
What did Kavika know anyway? She was in Beirut.
Sometimes Harry had to take a breath, just looking at him.  Harry still thought it unfair that Malfoy had been fit in school and that he’d somehow managed to become so again.  There should be more wrong with him.  He’d served the Dark Lord, after all.
good.”
“I’m sorry,” Hermione said sympathetically.
Malfoy took a noisy breath, then another one, breathing hard. “But you . . . You can’t. You said you
“No one knew what it meant,” Harry said.
.  If you were cunning, you could decorate, and then you’d get what you want.  Gryffindors don’t get what they want because they’re—they’re blatant.  I can’t be blatant, especially because I’m—well.  I’ve got to decorate, is what I’m saying.”
“You call old-me Potter?”
Still, they almost always made chit-chat at the beginnings of sessions, so, while Kavika made the coffee, Harry sat and asked after Nadia. They talked about the wizard doctors, Kavika’s son-in-law, and porting to Beirut. “It’s got to be brutal, jumping between time zones,” Harry said.
Alby’s face was mottled with different colour—red from exertion but still green from the slugs.  It made his skin seem almost purple, contorted with rage, and in that moment, he reminded Harry of Vernon.  Alby began to demand, “What makes you think you deserve any—”
Malfoy jabbed a finger in Adebayo’s direction. “He saw it!”
“Why do you keep asking about my parents, then?”
“Hm,” Draco said.  The little hum didn’t even sound like a question.
you?”
Mister Malfoy’s voice was light.  “You’ve never really cared what I thought.”
“But where are we going?” Harry asked, following Draco around as Draco went into the bedroom.
,” said Draco’s bored voice.
“Mm,” Malfoy purred, moving toward the desk as well. “Know what would really help me
“I don’t know!”  Draco exploded.  “I don’t know why you would even—you’ve just asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, as though—as though I had thousands of choices arrayed before me and I saw the one where I was a Death Eater and my parents were in Azkaban and that was the choice I consciously selected!  And then you insulted my working in a shop!”
“Oh, I do,” Teddy said.
“Yes,” Harry said, unbuckling and pulling out the gold coins.  He handed them to the driver and started opening the door.
“What?”
“You are,” Harry said, turning to look up at him.
Harry had stationed himself, along with Andromeda, Teddy, Fairchild, Mark, and some of the neighbours, around the perimeter of the orchards of Rombe Pickle and the village below. The village was small, without any large non-magical population centres nearby. As a result, the Department had not spared any Aurors for the area, concentrating instead on places like Diagon Alley, where Reveal would instantly be noticed by non-magicals and therefore cause immediate problems.
“What can I do?” Malfoy said, letting go Harry’s wrist. His voice was still low, urgent. “Do you need them? Should I bring them in?”
Penelope reared back. “I’m on your side. For once! What’s your problem?”
But Harry knew why. He was horribly, desperately embarrassed.
, Harry told himself.
“Magical children don’t get wands until later.  It’s so they don’t get up to anything dangerous—or mischievous—but it means their natural magic is difficult to control.”
Malfoy.
of the institution, and that kind of rhetoric does nothing to help?”
this?  Why do you hang about with that
Finally, Draco looked up, and he looked absolutely terrible.  It was not the lack of hair—his hair had made him look so gorgeous that having it all shaved off should have made him look a lot less gorgeous, but that wasn’t the problem.  In fact, the lack of hair brought out the delicacy of his features, the sharpness of his jaw.  He would have looked just as good as ever, except that now the thinness had verged into skeletal territory.  There were large hollows under his eyes, nearly purple on his pale skin.  His eyes were too big.  Harry felt like he could see individual bones in Draco’s hands.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Luna said.
“Just like that, pretty,” Draco purred, thrusting into him a little slower now, as though to watch. “Play with that dick and come for me while I fuck you. Come all over yourself for me, paint yourself for me, make yourself pretty like a picture.”
Reveal it.”
“Hi.” Mark waved.
—that he would stay in a cupboard, and Harry didn’t know how he had got to the bed, but he had definitely slept in it.
“You don’t have to forgive her,” Harry said.  “For whatever she—you don’t.  And you don’t ever have to see her again or talk to her.  I just think—she loves you.  She still loves you, and I thought you should know.  In case you didn't.”
“If he’s making you uncomfortable,” Kavika said, “you can ask him to stop bringing you coffee.”
“They’re cheaters, Harry.  Do you want some lunch?”
“Um,” Harry said, his voice faint, rather too mesmerized by the sight of Draco’s slowly hardening cock. “Ask for it?”
In the end, the Board of Regents came to unanimous agreement. Teddy Lupin was allowed to graduate, Draco Malfoy to advance to Level Two.
read the note, and Harry was surprised that the surname stung.  He’d been a child when he’d demanded Draco call him Harry.  Apparently, Draco hadn’t believed Harry could possibly feel the same way when he grew back up.
“With the UK leaving the EU,” Rune was saying, “some of the international wizarding community is hoping to isolate the UK entirely, so that Reveal wouldn’t affect the rest of the wizarding world. This would be extremely difficult for the non-magical people, obviously, as it would require isolating the UK more than it already plans to isolate itself. It would need to become another Atlantis, and I’m sure you know the last time wizards disappeared a whole island, it was four thousand years ago. There’s a reason we haven’t done it since.”
Fuck.  Harry didn’t know if he could keep doing this.  Maybe he
“Knowing how to from you is better.”  Harry finished his toast.  “Who do I get to be?”
“Right.”  Purposely forcing his shoulders to relax, Harry took a deep breath.  Then another.  “I just feel like,” he began, in his most earnest voice, “someone like that—someone who would accuse one of our own, is someone we should keep an eye on.  I wouldn’t want her making any more false accusations.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco said.  “Use a spell.”
Then Draco was slamming into him hard, and coming, and Harry had to take the toy out of his mouth because its thrusting was too much. It was all too much; Draco coming felt like Harry was coming, except that he wasn’t; he was still hard, achingly hard, and Draco was shuddering on top of him, collapsing on top of him, still thrusting, still coming, but gasping, trying to say something. “Harry—Harry—Harry, I—I—” But he could catch his breath; he was almost hyperventilating.
“Free,” said Savage.
Her towel dropped as she turned away, but at least she was wearing pants, and Harry was used to Luna. This was how he ended up lying in nothing but his shorts in the warm, lime-blue water of Luna’s pool, buoyed by viridescent pearls, apparently a kind of magic algae. They rubbed gently along Harry’s skin as he floated in the water, looking up at the floating spectre of a moon, lit gold by the length its light travelled through the atmosphere.
“Has that ever stopped me?”
“I thought it was because a bunch of bloody blood supremacists were upset at non-magical people marrying witches and wizards.” Ron frowned. “Non-mags were moving into magical places, inventing machines and things to do what magical people do—”
“Yes, Malfoy, come in, sorry,” Harry said, turning back to Gareth. “It’s a flat white, with an extra shot, and then a small sprinkle of cinnamon.”
It was very, very good.  Hot, but not quite hot enough to burn—just hot enough to make the chocolate feel silky on his tongue.  Hardly ever getting to have sweets to begin with, much less in a drink, Harry hadn’t really tasted anything like it before.
“No,” Hermione said. “I wish I’d thought of it, but honestly, Harry, I didn’t even notice you leaving. I think probably everyone was just too distracted.”
“Harry,” Draco said, his tone gently remonstrative.
“All right,” Harry said softly. “Consider that Dirk Spragg wants to help people. And he thinks he’s better  doing what he does right now.”
“Obviously, they’d be jealous,” Draco said, sitting straighter.  “No other mums are half as good as mine.”
“Yes,” Kavika said sadly. “And how do you feel, that you still feel pity for Draco Malfoy, when all of this is true?”
“Well,” Draco said, looking a little mystified about it all.  “I said I wanted to be important.”
Harry hadn’t really thought that Draco would go outside with him, but suggesting it had given Harry an idea.  Getting out his wand, he cast the spell to call Heloise, who came from the open window in the kitchen.  As soon as she got to the sitting room, she went straight for Draco.
“Why did you have to have your hair cut?” Harry asked, remembering Draco had said something about it before.
“Why did you change your mind?”  Harry asked.
me things?  I know what I am!”
“I’m needed,” said Teddy, turning away.
“It’s four-thirty,” Harry said.  “The cure is ready.”
Malfoy just stared at him again. When he finally spoke again, his voice was unexpectedly light. “I’m not a Death Eater. I regret what I did. What my family did. I’m sorry for it. I’m ever so
“What I really want is quiche,” Harry said, “but I don’t know where to get one.”
“Perfectly.” Malfoy stopped in front of him, almost as though facing him—but he still wasn’t, not really. His eyes were unfocused, looking somewhere above Harry’s own, at Harry’s brow, or his forehead, perhaps. “Thank you for the service you rendered me. I shall not forget it.” He turned to go.
“Sorry!” Doctor Yin yelled, and the grinding stopped. Picking up the pitcher, they poured the grey-looking smoothie into a jar, then came back to their seat. “You have an orientation, right? Is it weird to meet the new trainees?”
“I’m—”
A door opened on the other side of the room.
Hermione raised a brow. “Is he?”
“Oh, I see,” said Alby, his voice still so oily.  “But you understand how difficult it is for a business when its employees are being harassed and distracted?  Work doesn’t get done, you see.  I’ve already had to file a complaint to Head Auror Robards about this.  I wouldn’t want to have to file another.”
Apparating to Mr. Mulpepper’s Apothecary, Harry didn’t find Malfoy there, either.  When he asked Mrs. Mulpepper, she looked at him strangely.  “Draco hasn’t worked here in two years,” she said, but Malfoy had never told Harry that.  Malfoy had never told him anything.
Harry didn’t belong. He didn’t belong here in the same way he had not belonged at a table of Aurors in the Ministry of Magic, in the same way he had not belonged at a table in the kitchen of Number Twelve with the order of the Phoenix, in the same way he had not belonged at Privet Drive. They weren’t his family. He didn’t want to sit around and talk about it.
“Get back to it,” Alby demanded, but Malfoy just went on standing there.
Draco seemed to hesitate.  “I’d like to run some more diagnostics, if that’s okay.”  Moving aside, Draco pointed at the floor, and a stool appeared there.  Harry wondered whether the stool was from the other side of the room, or whether Draco had just made it out of thin air, but instead of asking, Harry sat down in it, guessing that was what Draco wanted.
“He’s working on figuring out that ingredient.”
Penelope whirled on him. “When will you realize you are
“Where’s my house?” Draco demanded.
of my promises; I fucked
On the first day of new term after the hols, a cup of hot coffee prepared the way Harry liked it was waiting on Harry’s desk. For some reason, Harry was surprised.
Fuck.
“Draco?”
Draco walked Harry through each colour, each spell having a slightly different flick of the wand at the end of them.  The words were hard to remember, but Draco didn’t make fun of him for forgetting.  Instead, he repeated the words over and over, his voice becoming hypnotic in the warm glow of the fire.  He demonstrated each of the movements again and again, at one point covering Harry’s hand with his larger one and gently moving with him to show Harry the flick to turn the chair orange.
“No,” Harry said, forgetting the Veritaserum.  “I mean, yes.”  He scrubbed his face.  If Veritaserum had made him say no, then there was something wrong with Ron working there, even if he hadn’t realized it.  Fuck.  Harry couldn’t talk to Hermione about it.  He couldn’t talk to anyone.  “He’s just—he doesn’t know anything.  About how that place works,” Harry said, and then he found himself talking, about how the Auror Department worked.
“Then pretend.”
“Yes, the red-head one.  It’s your turn, Harry.”
Harry very much wanted Kavika just now, but that shouldn’t be Teddy’s problem. It wasn’t Teddy’s problem. This was happening to Fairchild, after all; she was the one who deserved care and sympathy and a therapist; she had it so much worse. Harry shouldn’t even get to feel—“No,” Harry said. “I’m not doing very well.”
But Harry could tell Mister Malfoy was joking, so he took the knife and started cutting himself a slice about a fourth of the size of the cake.
“Sure,” said Harry. “When?”
Harry stayed up against the wall.  Curse words were never a good sign.
“Come on,” Harry said, turning away.
“We’ll just clean this up,” Mister Malfoy said, but Harry could barely hear him, his stomach already heaving.  “Do you want to—”
“I was meaning to ask,” Harry said. “I know I’ve seen him before—what’s his name?”
“Moves my hair off my forehead like that.”
Oh God.
“What other kinds are there!”  Draco flapped his arms.
“I guess,” said Harry.
“I can’t bear for anybody to see me when I’m like this.”
“You want Draco to change for you?”
“What?”
“Well, I mean.”  Harry hesitated.  “That means I thought you were trying to murder people, so possibly not something to be proud of.”
“But Harry,” Savage said, walking away, “you got his father arrested fifth year!  That makes you practically mates!”
“I’m sure you read about the trainee,” Harry said gently.
Malfoy.
“But it’s not,” Harry said. “I mean, it is, but it’s never—he never even looks at me, when he does it. Not anymore. I mean, he used to, but now it’s just . . . it’s just like he wants things to be a certain way for me, and I thought it was okay, but it’s not.”
“When that happens,” Malfoy said, “know that there’s someone else who knows it all, feels it all, went through it all, and that someone loves you. He loves every particle of you, every damned infuriating piece of you, and he accepts you. Every fucked up inch of you. You could do anything, Potter, and there will still be someone who knows you and wants you for exactly what you are.”
Suddenly Draco stood and turned, scroll in hand.  “What are you doing here on a Sunday anyway, Savage?”
.  He could have been mistaken for one, walking down the street.
“Not exactly.” Rune moved his hands when he talked, enthusiastic and fluid. “The plan is to get non-magicals on our side, that they wouldn’t
“If you tell me when you call a press conference,” Malfoy went on blithely, “maybe I wouldn’t have to read ‘Unable to Cast a Patronus, Malfoy Scion Fails Again’ in the
“Good.” Harry turned to the trainees. “Clear the mat. Liang, want to count us down?”
“I don’t know if it’s a Black gene,” Teddy said. “My grandfather was a non-mag, but that doesn’t mean he couldn’t also have had a Metamorphmagus gene.”
Harry laughed.
“Yes, you are.  You’re friends with Weasel-boy, not me.”  Draco’s eyes had an almost manic light in them, and Harry realized Draco must be feeling the claustrophobia as well.  Harry tried to imagine living three years in the space of a day, trapped with someone you thought hated you.  No wonder Draco was behaving this way; this wasn’t healthy.  “And you’re still friends with him,” Draco was going on, throwing his arms up in disgust.  “You talked about their kid; I know you see them—you’re still friends!”
“What word would you choose?” Teddy said a while later, as though there had not been a break in conversation at all.
“Teddy,” Malfoy said. “I can do my part. Even if I can never be an Auror.”
“So much for being the control,” Malfoy said witheringly.
“Not . . . exactly,” Draco said, hesitating.  His eyes were barely red at all.  He didn’t even look like he’d cried, but colour had come back into his face, and his chin trembled a little.
“With you?” said Andromeda.
” Harry shouted, leaning out around Draco again.
“And you don’t want her to know what it meant.”
,” he said.  “A filthy rotten liar!  The Dark Lord
“Yeah,” Harry said, “and he thinks it means he can get away with doing nothing.  But he and Robards are best mates, for some reason, and Vance ticks Ron right off.  And I’ve tried to tell Ron he can’t do anything against Vance, because Robards will take it out on him, but he thinks I mean physically take it out, when that’s not how Robards works.  He’ll just—he’ll undermine you.  For years.  Over and over, until you feel so worthless, even when you’re doing the best job you can.”
“Do you want to touch it?”
“Harry Potter,” Draco said.  “He thinks I’m smart.”
“Please,” Harry said.
“Astoria,” Harry repeated, feeling stupid. “But why?”
“It’s all right to be sad now.”
The solution for this feeling was to fill it up.
Harry blinked. “He shouldn’t get to be in love with me.”
“Good job.” Robards was facing Harry, holding out his hand, but as Harry reached to take it, Robards deliberately turned to Malfoy, making it clear the congratulations was for Malfoy, not Harry.
“I’m sorry. I misunderstood.” Milligan’s eyes were rather large. “I thought you meant you felt you couldn’t have a soulmate because of what he had done to you.”
“What he said to who?”
“I know,” Harry said.
Once a war was won, it should stay won. Once one made progress, one should stay ahead. Instead, twenty years later, the losers were all coming back, the losses were being lost again, and Harry felt like he wasn’t here. He was in a nowhere land, without time, an endless loop in which he couldn’t hear, couldn’t smell, couldn’t see—
Draco got that stricken look, but folded it away swiftly, like a letter being sent off somewhere.  “Holidays are happy,” he said, his voice soft and low.  “Holidays are happy, and birthdays are happy, and magic is happy, when you’re doing it with good intentions, and with—with someone you care about.  And someone who cares for you.  Harry.”  Draco reached out, hesitated, then slowly touched Harry’s hair, brushing his fringe aside.
“No thanks,” Harry said, heading toward the door.
Draco looked away.  “I’m trying to make things as easy as possible.”
“I just can’t believe this Malfoy business,” Penelope went on.
“What?” Harry said.
“Why do you call Vince and Greg Crabbe and Goyle?”
“It was years ago,” said Harry. “I don’t think he is any longer.”
to know why Robards was doing this, except Ron was using his Reasonable Adult voice—the one he had gained around the time Harry was having trouble finding his. That it wouldn’t really hurt Malfoy to stay was absolutely true.
“The mess” was stacks of scrolls, of parchments, and of books lining either side of the hall, many of them taller than Harry. Some of the scrolls were rearranging themselves, while magic quills wrote on several of the parchments. Pots of ink and filing portfolios floated in the air. Madam Pince would have fainted. Hermione probably would have fallen in love.
“Children?” snapped Spragg, infuriated. “These are
Teddy just sat there, looking at Harry over his plate, where the mess of beans remained brown and sticky, and Harry didn’t know what to do. He hadn’t wanted Teddy to be an Auror in the first place, but not necessarily because the Auror Force was corrupt. Was the Auror Force corrupt? Harry had hated how he wasn’t listened to, how everything was so slow, how difficult it was to bring about change in the larger World.
, Harry desperately wanted to say, but he didn’t.
“Eventually,” Harry said, because this squeeze bordered on painful.
“I want to make sure you’re okay,” Harry said.  “And you said you’d help me look at more of those memories in the Pensieve.”
Draco smirked.  “I’m very distracting.”
Harry did.
A smile twisted on the side of Draco’s mouth, and from it, Harry guessed that Draco might not like hamburgers, but he made them anyway, and they were just as delicious as all the other food.  For afters they had something called fondue; Harry pointed out he’d already had afters that day, but Draco didn’t seem to think that important.  “It’s our in-between birthday,” Draco said.  “We could have dessert for supper, if we wanted.”  Then he made a fountain of chocolate and showed Harry how to float strawberries into it.
Draco turned to look at him then, his face so pale in the dark.  His hand came up, hesitated, then brushed aside the fringe over Harry’s forehead, revealing the scar.
Teddy was already standing up, slipping something into his pocket. His usual excuse for all his disappearances was that he was going off to see friends, but his friends were here, all still talking and laughing. They hadn’t heard Teddy’s soft announcement; they probably assumed he was going to the loo.
Taking out his wand, Harry and pointed at the shelves.  “There,” Harry said, putting his wand away as the phials on the racks all flew out and danced around each other.  “Will you do it now?”
They hadn’t spoken much since the press conference. Teddy hadn’t wanted to. “He was brave,” Harry said. “At Windermere Hall. He would make a good Auror.”
“Maybe you should have been more careful.”  The comment sounded like Malfoy should be annoyed, but his voice was concerned.  Taking the powder, he asked, “What does it do?”
“Not everything is about payment and repayment. Sometimes someone does something just because they can.”
“Anyway,” Harry went on.  “You couldn’t make me watch.  My magic is stronger than yours; there’s no way you could make me stay.”
“How dare you?” a new voice snapped.
“That’s all the ways of putting it,” Harry said.
Harry looked at him helplessly.  “You’re a child.”
Leck Hall was so old that no panes filled the window, the cold February air blocked by ancient spells rather than glass. The day was dismal, the courtyard the brown of winter with only a few tufts the muted grey-green of England. The Timothy Tree stood barren at the centre of the courtyard, its tall, reaching branches like a bouquet of bones.
Rodolphus’s eyes were alight in response to this speech. “Will you show it to him?”
Auror Vance had always been a thorn in Harry’s side, but mainly because he was incompetent and lazy.  Over the last year, however, he’d become irrationally obsessed with due diligence and proper protocol—especially when it came to Harry’s cases.
“It’s okay.  Harry’s eyes were burning, but he wasn’t crying any more.  His head felt too large, his nose stuffy.  He was probably all red, but at least he wasn’t crying.
the grease.”
“Yes.”  Draco lifted his chin in the air.  “You failed to adequately admire my genius.”
That hungry, desperate look returned.
Just Draco’s head turned on the sofa, his body still draped across it.  “You said he died for someone he loved.  Who?”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “I meant—I don’t want to. Feel. Gratitude. For him.”
For some reason, Malfoy seemed even more amused by this. “A Malfoy has his secrets. I couldn’t possibly tell you.”
“Oh,” Draco said.
Draco’s tone went gentler still.  “You used to have a beautiful owl, though, Harry.”  Finished with the washing up, Draco started heading to the sitting room, so Harry followed.  “The best-looking owl in the whole school.”  They went downstairs.
Draco stood in front of Alby, his shoulders square.  “I didn’t deserve the way you treated me,” he said.
“Harry.  I meant . . . parts of my family are so terrible, you wouldn’t want a part of it.”
“Do you really have to choose?  Do you really think she’d disown you if—”
After an hour, however, news of Diagon Alley had begun to spread on non-magical media, and the cars began to swerve at the sight of the houses, then stop. People began to get out of their cars, and the Order of the Phoenix went to work.
“Can an Animagus be a big, red pumping heart?”
Magic roiled inside of Harry, and this was why he didn’t like to feel anything.  Sadness always felt like rage, something difficult to control; tears pricked behind his eyes at the same time as his fingertips crackled over his heart.
“That was good,” Draco said, setting all of the papers onto one of the work benches.  He took out the parchments he had folded up as well.  “Do you have that scroll?”  Harry handed it over and Draco took it, adding it to the pile.  “You did so well,” Draco said again, coming back over to Harry.  “How do you feel?”
Harry opened his mouth, then closed it. He rubbed the back of his hand.
“Yes.”  Mister Malfoy sounded amused.
, went Harry’s brain, and he brushed the back of his hand with his fingertips. The pub was crowded, and loud. “Maybe revolution could wait to see whether Proudfoot gets a plurality,” Harry said.
“You don’t tell anybody, do you?” Draco said quietly.  “About the books.  I just assumed you knew, but—you keep it a secret.  Don’t you?”
“Give him room to breathe, at least,” Andromeda said.
Clouds moved in the sky, patient and white, as though nothing was going on beneath them.  The absence of life was strange after a while, without the sound of birds, without even insects to crawl among the stones.  Harry thought about doing a spell to make the grass grow.  He couldn’t decide if it would make Malfoy feel any better.
“Slutty?”
“You’re the one who misinterpreted.”  Reaching back, Draco began tying up his hair again.  “Then again, you’re the one who so desperately wants to shag me.”
“Oh,” Harry said again, feeling overwhelmed.  He tried holding Draco to him.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, mostly because he hoped it meant Penelope wouldn’t continue to ask questions about the Order.
“And the war?” Harry asked.
a canary. “He says I should have been a healer.”
” pointed out one of fathers.
Harry looked over at him, picking up a book near the table.  It was quite big and heavy, with brass metal bindings.
“Yes,” Harry said, squirming on another thrust. “Yes, yes, I want to, I want to come on your cock. Yeah.” He moved his arse in a circle again, trying to get that cock to hit new places.
“You’ll provide your services whenever I want,” Harry said, snatching the paper out of Malfoy’s elegant hand.  “You’re still a former Death Eater, Malfoy, even if you happen to be tops at potions.”
“Don’t.”
“Fuck!” Malfoy said, his voice high and wild. “Finite incantatem! Finite! Finite!”
“Aren’t you meant to be my therapist?” Harry gave them half a smile. “You’re not meant to depress me.”
“You were a Minister of Magic.” Harry’s voice was flat. “Why shouldn’t you be afforded the title of worst Minister on record?”
Glancing at him as they walked through the orchard, Harry saw that Teddy looked at ease, but he almost always looked at ease. “Do you think you’ll try to climb the Timothy Tree?”
Harry thought about his aunt and uncle. The algae bumped against him gently, bursting and rolling into reformation on his skin.
Harry opened the ledger so he could look at Draco’s handwriting.
“I’m not that level of hot?” Harry asked, pretending to be offended.
“You’re not a coward,” was all Harry could think to say.
Travers scowled. “You never came with us.”
Realization tore through Harry like a shockwave.  He took a careful step away, then another.  “No.  We don’t.”
“You don’t have to do it,” Harry pressed. “I can make it so—”
“Um.  Usually that works.”  Malfoy wet his lips.  “
He had chocolate on his face.  He was laughing.
“Good luck with that,” said Pillwickle.
“Weasel was cruel to people I care about.  He
“Well, we never had to be discreet on in-between birthdays, for one thing,” Mister Malfoy went on.  “Harry, are you done?”
“They won’t keep going on that way.” Ron’s voice was warm. He reached out to touch Hermione’s wrist. “The Deal will help protect people.”
“More,” Harry croaked, when Malfoy released him. Harry discovered he was clinging to him, his fists full of the back of Malfoy’s shirt. It was probably Astoria’s shirt, and Harry gripped it harder. “Please, I love you. More.”
Gareth was looking between them. “Er. I’m going to Costa? It’s closest.”
Malfoy’s knees were on either side of Harry’s hips, thighs straddling him. “Incarcerous,” Malfoy breathed.
Kavika looked away. “I’m going to make coffee,” she said, standing. “Do you want your usual?”
“Don’t have a choice. He leaves them on my desk. The first one, I didn’t know it was him. The second one—I poured it out. But after that.” Harry gave her a speaking look. “I can’t go about pouring out coffees. It isn’t right.”
“Potter, precious Potter,” Malfoy was saying. “Obviously, he wanted a look at ‘
“Oh,” Harry said, wondering if that was why he and Draco hadn’t been friends.  “Sorry.”
“What did you mean?” Harry said.
“No,” Harry said again. “I told them—well, you know what I told them. At the beginning of term. I’d have them removed if they asked about him.”
Harry’s smile widened. “I let Ron tell me.”
Though the wireless was on, the results of the Council vote had not yet been announced, and the conversation in the pub ran mostly political. Harry had a lot to say about politics but kept mostly quiet, instead nursing his lager and listening to everyone else talk. Teddy and Nyala mostly listened as well, which was generally their wont. The evening wasn’t shaping up so bad, and Harry was feeling hopeful about Proudfoot, until the door to the pub burst open, letting in the sharp night and a tall man with a shock of blond hair.
“All right,” Harry said.  “But you have to let me come visit you.”
“Little Lord Malfoy,” Alby said, sounding significantly less pleased.
“By . . . me?”  Draco had said something like that before, but Harry still had trouble believing it.
Harry’s brain instantly responded, but Kavika was always telling him he didn’t have to defend them.
“What about the puppies?”  Malfoy was beginning to smirk—an honest to God, old-fashioned Malfoy smirk, just like the ones from school.  It made him look less gaunt—healthy, almost.  Good.
Harry didn’t know what exorbitant meant, but he did get some information from this.  “Is that why you’re the only one I can trust?”
“I’m sure it would have.”
me.  I need to—I want to go home!”
“Eyes on your work, Harry,” Draco said, when he saw Harry looking. Bracing his wand hand on Harry’s hip, Draco used his other hand to push Harry’s head forward and down. “Show that prick in your mouth what an obedient slut a big man like you can be. Let it use your mouth.”
“You’ve felt it, haven’t you?” Malfoy asked. “The way it feels special, separate. You’ve felt the way it calms you, the way it feels peaceful. Timeless.”
The spy.
His eyes closed.
“There was a sword in a hat,” Harry began.
Harry needed a moment to catch up. “It’s not from Malfoy?”
“Teddy’s about the same, I see,” Draco said.
“Instructor Potter,” said Malfoy, then made his way back across the green.
Pillwickle turned to Greengrass, smirk souring. “You can’t protect her forever.”
“It’s all right,” Draco said, smoothing back his hair himself.  “I had to have my hair cut, but they let me keep that bit.  I’ll probably slick it when I go to school, since I had to get it cut anyway.”
Aurors impounded the warehouse on Colville, collecting all the potions and ingredients.  While the Life Water was immediately handed over to the Department of Mysteries, many of the confiscated items remaining needed to be identified before they could be properly handled.  Had Robards still been in charge, even he would have ceded to the argument that a potions consultant would be required to deal with everything.  Thus, Draco’s position within the Ministry became official, and he was offered a stipend for the work as well as a title.
“We were just speaking of a girl
Kavika smiled. “Did it work?”
Harry moved so that he could see both Draco and Alby at the same time, still pointing his wand at Alby.  Draco was leaning down to sniff an open phial in his hand, the cabinet open just behind his head.  “Can you do it?” Harry asked.
Draco looked down at himself, the frown back on the harsh, unforgiving face.  This time Harry knew the frown wasn’t meant for him, but he still didn’t like it.  He recognized the clothes, of course—Draco was wearing the scarlet robe, gloves, tunic, belt, breeches, and boots that Harry had worn when he had first shrunk down to his current age and size.  He wondered whether Draco had the knobbly orange socks on, too.  “Not always,” Draco said, sounding sort of at a loss.
“For me,” Harry said, pressing his advantage. “I’m asking you not to.”
“I don’t want coffee from you, Malfoy.”
“They are indeed.  And you look extremely good in green.”
Harry sipped his coffee.
“Good.”  Harry released him.  “Who else?”
“No, I just—I like it.  When you do it.”
“Not every witch or wizard can cast a Patronus,” said Miles Bletchley.
Class began. Everyone was doing an excellent job, though McDevitt was still struggling with rearmament. The Combat class began with magic duelling, then moved into wandless hand-to-hand. In January, they began working on the wandless spell to regain a wand; the course had a focus on gaining control of your own and your opponent’s wand. It was more important than most people realized, and Harry stopped to help McDevitt and his partner.
“I’m worried
Draco glared at him, his eyes beginning to flash.
“It’s not going to work if
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy began, then stopped.  “You,” he started again.  “What do you mean you only need a cupboard?”
Malfoy’s voice was a husky croak. “Seeing that I fail was that important to you?”
“Do you mean . . .”  Malfoy licked his lips, cherry red from kissing.  “You don’t want . . .?”
“I’m not brutal,” Harry said.
“Well, aren’t you keen! Of course, you are, hero of wizarding Britain.” Milligan seemed to think it rather sweet that Harry was hero of wizarding Britain. “I was colour-coding my calendar.”
“Of course not,” Harry said.
Harry frowned. “You really expect me to thank you?”
“Yes. I’m—yes.”
“You like me talking about your dick,” Harry breathed into his ear, and Draco made that horrified little noise again. His eyes were squinched shut tightly, his face turned away from Harry’s at an almost desperate angle. “Let me hold it,” Harry said, keeping his voice soft in Draco’s ear as he covered Draco’s hand with his own. “I promise I won’t let you come.”
one of his nicest teachers had told him, her voice quite gentle.  Harry hadn’t known what the teacher meant by ‘under-developed,’ but he had known that it was bad.  “Usually only toddlers have magical accidents like that,” Mister Malfoy went on, “but I suppose you don’t have anyone to help you learn how to control it.”
“Do you want to know why I wanted to be a Fiendfyre fighter?” Malfoy asked.
“Now I know you really should have been careful,” Malfoy said, but he smiled, almost warmly.
“Specifications.  Bespoke potions, if you will.  Like a tailor, but for drams and draughts.”
Instead of using his wand, Draco stood to put the photo album away.  “Your parents were wizards,” he said, putting the album carefully onto one of the shelves.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, looking startled out of a reverie.  “Yes, we’ll . . .”  Hastily, he grabbed a bowl on the tray, then poured some of the blue liquid in.  “And then we’ll—”  He reached toward Harry, stopped, then thrust the bowl toward him.  “Put your thumb in, and I’ll time it.”
“But his marks in his other classes are quite good,” said Pillwickle’s green face in the hearth.
Harry thought about it. “Okay,” Harry said.
“Come along,” said Travers. “Straight this way.”
When Draco spoke, his voice was low and warm, the same tone that Harry remembered him using all the time when Harry had been eleven, but not so very much since then. “You have to admit that you were the more adventurous of the two of us,” Draco said.  “Riding in taxis all by yourself.”  He smiled.
“No.” Harry looked at him carefully, but Malfoy seemed so perfectly sincere. At the end of last year, Harry had concluded Malfoy hadn’t known that the Board had been lobbying Harry to change Malfoy’s scores, but the idea that he hadn’t found out—that he hadn’t heard the rumours, at the very least—hadn’t occurred to Harry. Either Malfoy had become a much better liar than he used to be, or he didn’t know. “You honestly don’t think there are people who want you to be an Auror?”
“Not even a little?”
“Your house.” Malfoy sounded odd.
“You mentioned that before.”  The smile was growing now, but it wasn’t mean.  Just—amused.  “Do your aunt and uncle have a cupboard under the stairs?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, inexplicably turned on by this. “Yeah.” Under Draco’s burning eyes, Harry reached for it, his own cock. Fuck, he was so turned on; he writhed again against his hand, fucking down onto Draco’s cock and then up into his own hand, back and forth between them.
“I’m not anti-Muggle!” Savage roared, slamming her hands on the table. “I want to
; they’re going to—I don’t want to go to school!”
“Harry,” Ron said. “Maybe we should all just take a moment.”
Harry looked around, but coffee didn’t materialize.  “Where is it?”
“Because I’m a kid? Oh, well.”  Draco frowned.  “I assume my political enemies would use it as a way to embarrass me.”
Tonight saw a similar crowd: Penelope, Gareth, Savage, Penelope’s husband, Savage’s wife—still on the Force—a few of her Auror friends, Teddy, Nyala, a few other Level Ones and Twos. Baggot and Povey were there, not necessarily sitting with anyone. Harry sat with Teddy and Nyala, glad that on such an eventful night, Teddy had asked to spend it with him, rather than disappearing to “hang about with friends,” as he kept saying.
“Right,” Harry said.  “But by the time I understood that that meant that what I felt was—just me, you were already talking about your Death Eater lips and my horrible Gryffindor skin.”
“I’m not sure what you meant.  How much lube do
“No one has to be sorry,” Harry said.
torn down!”  His hands were balled into fists and he was hitting Harry with each emphatic statement, blows landing on Harry’s arms, his stomach, his chest.  “He would never do it!  He’s my
“Excellent. Neither do I. Is Edgar Travers about? He invited me. Half-blood. He has a distinctive head. We don’t like him, but we tolerate him. Anything to avoid pushing the wizarding world to the breaking point, don’t you agree?”
win House Cup?”
“I’ve sealed it off a dozen times,” Malfoy said shortly. “It knows my magic like a glove.”
“You don’t study,” Harry went on. “You don’t practice. You never speak up in class—”
“I started the Order,” Teddy said. “I’m going to do that.”
are a legacy, even if your mother was a—”  Draco cut himself off again, looking quickly at Harry as though to check whether he was offended.  Draco went on more slowly, “I just meant you’re from a good family.  Even if you never got to know them, Harry.”
Harry looked over his shoulder at the witch Teddy had disarmed. “Stupefy,” Harry added, dropping the witch in her tracks. “Who is ‘we’ in this situation?” he demanded, turning back to Teddy.
“An Animagus, sure. Think outside the Animagus box. Think outside the Patronus box. If he were an Animagus with a Patronus, what animal would he be?”
“Why not?” said Greengrass, who had also joined them. “What else can come of opening our world to Muggles? We
“I’m not certain.  Perhaps you’ll tell me, if you ever let me sleep.”
“You don’t understand,” Draco wailed.  “I
And then tried to do the cloud.
Draco frowned, the expression fierce on Harry’s grown-up face.  “He’s not my boyfriend.”
“So,” Ron said again. “Teddy’s applied.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, stepping closer.  “I didn’t mean,” he began, but he’d definitely meant it.  He didn’t know how to finish.
have intuition about Malfoy, he realized, and he hoped to Merlin’s shaggy beard that just now, that intuition was dead wrong.
“I love you,” Harry said.
“Because I’m so good-looking?”
“You both are impossible,” said Hermione.
Standing there, still trembling a little, Malfoy seemed to be searching for something in Harry’s eyes. “I should go,” he said abruptly. He glanced toward the door. “They’ll be wondering . . .”
“You don’t want to . . .” Draco’s breath caught. “Inside me?”
Looking over at him, Draco saw Harry didn’t know what he meant.  “People come in and describe their specific problems,” Draco said.  “I devise a special potion, just for them, and I draw up the cost.  They agree to pay, and then I brew the potion and deliver it to them.  Now then, Harry.  Would you like to learn to fly, or would you prefer to ask questions all day?”
“Shagging blokes is a
“A very good one.”
“I snuck a marshmallow once, while Dudley was having it.”  Harry followed along behind, keeping a larger distance this time, in case Mister Malfoy stopped again.
“I’ve got to go to the loo,” Draco said an hour later.
A few weeks later, Harry caught a glimpse of the cuts on Travers’s arm in Level Two Advanced Wandless Combat. Deciding to keep a special eye on Travers, in case he was in trouble or hurting himself, Harry then noticed the old mud on the edge of Travers’s cloak. Then Harry remembered Travers’s boggart, and other pieces began to fall into place: the fact that Travers still sometimes used the world “Muggle;” the fact that Travers had got high marks in dark sigils; the fact that Travers was sometimes late to class. Blood had to come from somewhere, and enough didn’t add up about Travers that Harry began to keep watch over his dot on the map.
“Of course not.”
it any better?”
Harry took a deep breath.  “It’s ancient history.  I shouldn’t have brought it up.”
“Riddikulus,” Malfoy said, sounding dismissive and quite irritated. It shouldn’t have worked;
“Yes,” Harry said.
Malfoy mumbled something.
“Harry?” Draco’s brow knit up, and Harry could feel that tell-tale heat behind his eyes.  Fuck.
“Right.”  Pointing his stick at the books, Mister Malfoy began restoring them to the shelves by floating them over.  “It’s meant to cancel the effects of minor potions or charms.  It didn’t cancel the de-ageing potion, which means the potion is powerful.  But it has to have been, to have lasted this long.  The Cure-All doesn’t do anything for panic, so it must have just given you something else to focus on.”  He wasn’t even saying anything to the books, just pointing at them.
“Greyback!” said Bickford, horrified.
Harry nodded at the spot beside him, in front of the class.
There followed a political discussion about pure-blood efforts to break up Shacklebolt’s coalition in the Ministry of Magic. Though disturbing, none of the ideas or actions discussed were particularly illegal, and Malfoy spent the time looking about the room. This gave the Aurors waiting in the Ministry a better understanding of the dimensions and exits.
“Lucius.”  Savage drew her wand.
“I had Ron and Hermione.” Then, even though Harry knew it was cruel, he added, “And your parents did leave you.”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, moving over him a bit, kissing his jaw, his temple, his brow. “We’ll fuck again. I’ll make love to you again. I promise.”
“Draco,” Harry said, going over to where Draco was reading by the window.
They went on like that for several hours—Draco showing Harry spells that chopped and stirred and scooped, brewing the potions until well into supper-time.
“Lie back.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, exiting the Academy grounds before he Apparated.
Draco began packing clothes, and Harry recognized the scarlet robe he’d been wearing when he’d shrunk, that Draco had worn when he’d had Harry’s body.  “You said I was the only one you trusted,” Draco said, adding the robe to the bag, then adding other clothes as well.  “But I have to assume at this point you meant the only one you could trust who could also help you with this case.  She might not have been able to help you then, but there’s someone who can help us now, and I know for a fact both you and I trust her.”  Done with his packing, Draco put the bag on his shoulder, then reached out a hand for Harry.
“Oh,” Harry said.  “What ingredient?”
“I’m not going to fall asleep,” Harry said, right when he was about to fall asleep.
“Malfoy,” said Savage.
“Hi, everybody!” Mark said gamely. “I’ve known about the magical world for a few years now—”
Harry looked at it as well—Draco’s white hand on Harry’s red cock, the black hair at the base. It was a striking picture, but not quite striking enough for Harry to be as awed by it as Draco was, especially since Draco’s hand was so gentle and slow. “Draco,” Harry said, because Draco had been staring at it a while.
Teddy looked out toward the dance floor, finding Malfoy dancing with the hot one. “I suppose he was always fit as well.”
“Oh,” Draco said, lurching under him.
“You treated me like a human being, but you didn’t fear me or pity me.  No one else treated me quite like that.” Draco was now exploring the rest of Harry’s hand—the knuckles, the palm.  The curious stroking of his fingers sent shivers up Harry’s spine.
“That wasn’t enslavement.”
, Ron had said.
“What
fault she’s a founding member of the new Order?”
. Some of them really seem to listen. Others acted as though he had lost their trust. Some of these feelings redounded to Fairchild, a fact which seemed doubly unfair given her mistreatment, and which seemed to prove Harry’s theory of the case: whatever anti-non-mag bias there was in the Ministry, it had early roots.
“I’ll be fine,” Harry said, smiling a little.
“I didn’t mean it as a bad thing.  I bet . . .”  Malfoy’s cheeks went pink again.  “Well.  It’s cool, is what I mean to say.  That scar.  Did you get that when you—you know—killed him?”  Malfoy was kneeling on the couch, his face still hovering over Harry’s.  His eyes were on the scar.
“That fucking kiss.”  Draco sagged back into the sofa.
“Riddikulus,” Travers said, and the normal-looking person in odd clothes who had been his boggart became a tiny figure dancing on an enormous cake. Adebayo, who was next, made her dragon boggart play a trumpet. Then it should have been Malfoy’s turn, except Moskowitz had somehow ended up behind Adebayo, with Malfoy now behind Moskowitz. Moskowitz’s boggart was the dark, which always caused a bit of confusion, but Moskowitz cast Riddikulus to fill the dark with friendly voice, one of which kept saying,
Draco’s lips quirked.  “Yes.  Of course.”
“But he can’t be the best.”
; I wouldn’t—”
“I liked it,” Harry said, “I liked it. It was good.”
“I’ll have a croque monsieur,” Draco said, opening a drawer and looking at its contents.
“Robards!” Harry shouted.
“It’s hotter,” Draco said, lips catching on Harry’s as Harry concentrated on the buttons. “You have to go slower.”
“You’re always very eager to ascribe motives to people.”  Draco just kept staring off into the distance.
Head Auror Robards had said.
“Dreamy,” Proudfoot agreed.
, and it had been that way for so long—Malfoy bringing him coffee, Malfoy guarding his door, Malfoy pining while Harry just tried to live his life. Harry had been struggling for so long, just trying to make it through the days, that when he imagined himself with Malfoy, he imagined falling and Malfoy being there to catch him—but it worked both ways.
“But violence isn’t a necessity,” said Nyala. “If enough people care, you can have a movement anyway.”
“I’m eleven.  I mean . . .”  Malfoy shrugged.  “I imagine things are different when I’m thirty-two.”
“That’s not necessary,” Harry told him, as Malfoy guided the man around the trunk and into the library.
“A tyrant is someone who never lets you have any fun.”
Malfoy’s face fell a bit, but then his mouth settled into a line.  “Right.”  He began walking down the long dark hall.
“Right,” Harry said.  “About that.  We’re not meant to be friends, right?”
them,” Malfoy said. “Terrible people like that, and other kinds too. I want to
“He thinks of you as a person.” Teddy was still just sitting there behind his empty cup of coffee, his face so calm and unperturbed.
Penelope’s voice cut through a fog.
An emptiness opened up inside of Harry, yawning and vast, and he knew this feeling. He recognized this feeling. He should have prepared for this feeling. It was the feeling that came after finishing something and having nothing left, that came from expecting something and not having it come true. He’d felt it every day, coming home from the Auror Department, that feeling that his life was not what it should be, that he was not helping the people he should be, that nothing was as it should be.
“You don’t need to impress me,” Harry said. “You just need to follow my instruction.”
Ron and Harry watched them leave; then Ron turned back to Harry with a look of concern. “What we were saying before, did you want to say more?”
For two months in a row, Harry filed paperwork for the department.  He watched cases come across his desk, unsolved because some Aurors were incompetent, unfinished because other Aurors couldn’t get the resources they needed, incomplete because of Robards’ red tape and Cecil Vance’s prudish refusal to work with others and sometimes, even because of Savage’s wilful negligence for the rules.  The bureaucracy of it all made Harry sick
Harry had never been all that punctual, and his thoughts while flying plus the change of clothes meant that he was most likely late—a fact that was supported by the entire class turning to look at him when he flung open the classroom door. “Sorry,” he said, half for the tardiness and half for the bang of the door. “You could have started without me,” he added. “I can make you better at wandless combat, but I can’t actually warm up anyone else but myself.”
“I’m not disappointed.”
He should have some water. He should wash his face again. He should go back out.
,” Harry said.
“But she wouldn’t be
“You haven’t made up for what was done to me,” Harry said. “You haven’t shown me you’re a different person; you haven’t made me trust you. Do you think some cups of coffee would make me know you?”
Harry’s face warmed, his nose no longer freezing, catching the scent of cinnamon in the night air. Malfoy often smelled that way. Harry found that he wanted to kiss him.
A cup of water appeared in front of Harry’s glasses. He looked up in surprise. Why was Malfoy always supplying him with liquids?
The familiar grey of memory resolved around him into a large room with elaborate drapery and parquet floors, filled with wizards and witches, finely dressed. Traditionally dressed. Harry knew before recognizing any of the faces that this was some kind of pure-blood ball, such that when he began to recognize the faces—Bulstrodes, Notts, Zabinis, Pillwickles—the recognition only served as confirmation. Malfoy and Astoria Greengrass stood together, each holding elaborate magical drinks, talking to a Goyle and a Macmillan that Harry didn’t know.
Harry was worried about what it was doing to Draco inside, how it was fucking with his mental state, but they’d already started down this path.  They couldn’t stop.  “I’ve made you breakfast,” was all Harry said.  “It’s in the kitchen when you want it.  I also put some clothes over on the table—those are getting worn out.”  Harry gestured to the clothes Draco was wearing.  “You can also have a shower.  The towels in the loo are fresh.”
His mouth full of chicken and broccoli, Harry stopped the fork with another load of potato and gravy on the way to his mouth.  He finished chewing, then swallowed.  “Er.  Yes?” he guessed, then shoved the four remaining bites of pie in his mouth.  “Does that mean I can have . . .”  Harry gestured at the cake.
“What do you expect me to do without a sample?” said Malfoy’s disdainful voice.  “Why didn’t you go to St. Mungo’s?”
Malfoy wasn’t decent, but he wasn’t the same prat Harry had known in school.  Harry wasn’t the same person either, and the wizarding world as an adult wasn’t what Harry had expected when he was a child.  With a loud crack, Harry Disapparated.
“Are you sure you’re well?” Molly asked.
don’t wear ribbons,” Draco said miserably.
“Head Auror Robards will hear of this!” Alby said furiously.  “You’re disrupting my business!”
“Tomorrow morning,” Harry said.
In answer, Draco went over to the shelves.  Harry considered concealing the bottom shelf that had some of Draco’s notebooks and the photo album.  Since Draco had made it clear he didn’t think much of the shop or the flat, finding out that it belonged to him would be another conversation, and Harry wasn’t sure his battered heart could take it.  In the end, however, he could not bring himself to so blatantly conceal the truth, even from a child.  Especially from a child.
“I don’t care if you always wanted to seem fashionable,” Mister Malfoy said.  “I was going to look for potion residue.”
to change, even though in some ways, he couldn’t. It was a starting place at least. “Well,” Harry said. “He’s taller.”
Maybe Harry should drink something.
Sometimes being new and working with an Auror who had years of experience was a bit of a whirlwind.
Harry stopped chewing, wanting to hear what Mister Malfoy’s dad had done.  Grown-ups had dads too, he realized.  Mister Malfoy’s dad was probably the best.
“You’re not bringing me.”  He knew now why Draco hadn’t wanted to say it.
“Only for another month,” Harry said. He didn’t think that Malfoy saying he had been a fool when he had told him that he knew him
“My father was there, wasn’t he?  That’s what you meant about him killing people.  My father killed Cedric Diggory.  How about that.”
“Right.” Malfoy stood up, turning away. “Almost forgot about that.” He wandered away a step or two, and Harry let him, until Malfoy turned back suddenly. “Not even the bitter part? Can we at least say we were—acrimonious acquaintances?”
Just in time, Malfoy countered, his wandwork quick and efficient, just as he had learned, three years of training making him fluent in Defence.
He didn’t know what was happening.  “Er,” Harry said, coughing a bit.  “So—how will you ID it?  If you can’t open the bottle?”
Harry sort of hated older-him.  Taking the folders out of the box, he looked at the labels on them, then tossed them back.
“Are you suggesting this problem with blood purity is systemic within the Force?” asked Lee, thrusting out his microphone again.
Harry finished cutting himself the skinny slice.  Mister Malfoy cut his own slice after that, and Harry finally took a bite.  It was delicious, and it definitely did not taste like bread.
“Such pretty begging,” Draco said. “Put it in your mouth, like a good slut.”
“Shh,” Harry said, trying the hair-petting thing again.
“Tried that. Didn’t work for me.” Malfoy’s voice was careless. “Must be because you’re the Chosen One. Does blood know? ‘Ooh, he’s so powerful; he’s so brave; we’ll do what
“We have chemistry.”
The voices faded out as Harry got farther away, the trainees too caught up in conversation to notice that Harry had continued in the other direction. For the most part, trainees didn’t talk about the war too much around him—not after he shut it down those first few days of classes, anyway—but they certainly talked about current events, barely aware that current events were the same as past, history bleeding into the present. Most of them too young to have even had a wand when the war was going on. They were allowed to talk about it. Harry just sort of wished they wouldn’t in his hearing.
“This is from my father,” Malfoy said, then put a hand over Harry’s mouth and nose, and bore down.
Harry put it on the table.
“Do you think he’s good-looking?” he blurted.
“But do you think that means—”
crazy.  Things might get out of hand.”  Putting down his wand, Malfoy eagerly turned to Harry.  “I’m very good at magic.  I have a practice wand.”
Harry wanted to tell him it didn’t look like a dragon at all, but it looked so pretty up there, and Mister Malfoy vibrated a bit when he talked, like a low hum.
The next day, Kingsley Shacklebolt, unable to gain agreement on the Deal, faced a vote of no confidence from the Wizard Council. He lost the vote fifteen to thirteen, with one member abstaining.
“Right,” Harry said again.  And then there was the salary, which was terrible.  So what if Savage cut corners, when she didn’t get paid half enough for the work she did?  And then there was Ron, with two kids now.  Ron had known the pay of course, but he hadn’t expected to be working all these hours, even though Harry had tried to tell him.
said Kavika.
“No.” Malfoy shook his head. “Someone will see us. It puts the information at risk. I’m already taking a chance by being here with you just now, especially during examinations.”
Out of the shadows, Voldemort melted into a full form, half the man who had been Tom Riddle, half something else. Long, bony fingers settled on Malfoy’s shoulder, and the hooded face looked down at the dead bodies. “Well done, Son of Lucius,” Voldemort rasped.
Harry looked at the chair.  He wanted to leave, because Malfoy was annoying, and his dressing gown was annoying; his cosy-looking chair was annoying, but Harry felt weak and tired.  So tired.
anti-non-mag bigotry into every—”
“All right,” Harry said, even though it seemed kind of early for Draco to have to stop himself from coming.
Harry took a breath. “Actually . . . I’m not sure . . . ‘exercises’ really work for me. Kavika and I—we usually just talked.”
Harry was alone in Grimmauld Place when Heloise came.  Harry used to take work home with him just because there was nothing else to do if he was stuck by himself besides eat and listen to the wireless.  Sometimes he’d go out flying.  Sometimes he’d visit Dumbledore’s grave.  That was about the extent of his evening activities if he wasn’t with friends.
“Because you want to
“I’m thirty-two?” Malfoy asked.
“What?”
“Well,” said Harry, feeling uncertain. “I’d like to talk about . . . something that happened.”
Harry held up his hands as Vinicius whirled on him. “I thought you knew.”
“I don’t want him to have nothing from me. I want . . . I want . . .” Harry looked down at his hands.
Andromeda’s eyebrows rose in surprise at his sudden appearance.  “Marshmallows are quite difficult to transfigure.”
“Well.”  Draco appeared to be thinking.  “Did the kids ask mean questions?  At Hogwarts, I mean.  To Teddy?”
“Potter.”
“Angry,” Harry said, then was surprised he had said it, because the point was the coffee had been good. Walking into his office, where he could finally be in the quiet, away from everybody else, and finding coffee hot and waiting for him had been good. Knowing someone hadn’t felt the need to talk to him or greet him or demand things from him, that Harry had got to have this warm sweet little thing just for himself—it had been so good. The only problem was that—“It was Malfoy,” Harry said.
Malfoy went still. Appearing not to notice, Travers went on, “While others have decided to participate in this farce of . . . respectability and Reveal and whatnot.”
“When you,” he started, but couldn’t finish. He swallowed. “When you beat me at sparring,” Harry said. “I wanted you. I didn’t know what to do with it, but I—I felt it. I wanted you.”
“Fuck you?” Draco asked calmly, with those same long strokes sculpting Harry’s cock to attention, drawing it higher and harder and hotter. “Or get you harder?”
“Better than the one they used.”
Teddy gave a nod, as though to agree.
The flying field at the Academy was state of the art, complete with broom and carpet courses as well as Bludger pitchers and Snitch dispensers. Though the field was meant for trainee practice and the Defensive Riding course, Harry often flew there before teaching. Flying calmed him, clearing his mind so he was ready to face his students. They were not a particularly challenging cohort this year. As Harry had told Kavika, not even Malfoy was a problem, though he had fallen behind the other trainees.
Harry tried to puzzle this out.
“And this?” Malfoy’s head moved, his tongue swirling a circle in the hollow of Harry’s throat, and Harry shuddered again.
Malfoy put up his nose. “The sleeves will wrinkle,” he said, and Harry let him go.  Malfoy may have changed since school days, but he had never stopped being a ponce.
A faint smile appeared on the side of Draco’s face.  “Yes, Harry.”
“You’re right,” Harry said. “I’ve been unfair. I—I didn’t know what I felt.”
“I don’t have an in,” Harry protested, the third time Savage dumped someone else’s illegal potion case on him.  He tried to give the files back.  “Ask him yourself.”
Andromeda’s eyes widened.  They were a deep brown, Harry saw, and then she looked back up at Draco.  “What happened?”
“I usually do eight, but these old worn bones, you know.” Sibanyoni munched on a biscuit. “And how are you today?”
“The one to make it permanent?”
He did see.  The Department of Mysteries was a black hole into which information went and never came out again; whenever Unspeakables became involved, the Auror Office had to drop everything and let them take the reins.  Harry had complained about it before, and so had Robards—it was one of the few things on which they agreed.  If Robards wanted to make a case disappear, all he had to do was claim it had been turned over to Mysteries.
.  I’ve been
“No, it’s . . . sensitive.”
“Are you sad?” Draco asked, looking interested.  “That you didn’t get to know your parents?”
“Good point,” Harry said. The tree, which had always been such a point of calm for him, seemed sinister when he considered what it might symbolize. Had the founders sacrificed a non-magical just to keep the tree alive? Just to have something pretty on the green? Or was it meant to mean more—a symbol of everything Aurors should be and keep alive? Harry thought of the Chamber of Secrets, blood purism in the very foundations of what should have been a safe place for children.
“Let me,” Harry said again, touching Draco’s hair.  He slid his hand under Draco’s head, helping him lift a bit without cracking the cuts on his chest.  Taking the phial from Draco’s hand, Harry held it to Draco’s lips.  Draco let him, feebly drinking down the potion.  A bit of the orange liquid dribbled out the side of his mouth, and when he was done, Harry cleaned it for him with his wand.  Reaching down to the bowl he’d brought from downstairs, Harry took a flannel and wetted it with a spell.  “Please let me,” he whispered, wiping Draco’s face, his neck, where pools of blood had dried.
“You said I wouldn’t dance with you because I’m Harry Potter,” Harry said.
Just then, muffled sounds became apparent over the Hearing Raid, interspersed with a clicking with which Harry was very familiar.
Malfoy’s head jerked up as though on a string.
“What’s a ghoul?” he asked, when Mister Malfoy turned to write a note after the fourth or fifth spell.
“And should that not be the job of Aurors?” Pillwickle’s long face was placid, calm. “Since when did we allow citizens to take the law into their own hands? Bernard.”
Draco cast a glance toward Andromeda, but immediately turned back to Harry.  “I’m sorry, Harry.”
Doctor Marie Leblanc’s office was in a tiny wizarding hamlet a little ways north of Paris, on the river. The portkey took Harry to a cobblestone street outside of a quaint whitewashed row of shops, which looked like they should have thatched roofs but instead all had shingles. “I don’t have a waiting room,” Doctor Leblanc had explained, apologetically, “and I dislike to give a portkey directly to my parlour, in case I am in session. However, there is a delightful café across the street; if you come early you can have a tea or coffee.”
favours for his skin tone.  He should be wearing jewel tones.”
“See, that’s the kind of mocking that’s okay,” Harry said.  “Eleven-year-old-me probably was a bit of a ponce.”
“I’ll make you coffee,” Draco said, rising.
Harry pushed up his glasses.  “Then we weren’t doing tester potions?”
“Malfoy,” Harry croaked.
Draco wasn’t done.  “You deserve to have things you want.  You should have got things you wanted.  You should have—you deserved—”  But Draco cut himself off and didn’t say any more, and Harry couldn’t see his expression as he was facing the sink.
Two days later, the sixth page of the
Malfoy was still looking ill, but now he also looked annoyed.  “It’s obviously a potion to get inside people’s minds while they’re sleeping.”
Harry stared at him, unable to process this answer.  Most normal fires could be put out with Aguamenti or other water spells.  Most magical fires had counter spells or charms, so the Fiendfyre Force at the Ministry was only four people.  They flew out for the most terrible fires all over the country, sometimes invisibly helping with the Muggle ones too, just because they did what they could to help.  Harry heard there had been Fiendfyre fighters at the battle of Hogwarts who’d put out the fire that had burned down the Room of Requirement.
“That’s why it’s dangerous,” Draco said musingly.
Harry closed his eyes. He should occupy himself. He needed an occupation. Something to fill his brain. Something that wouldn’t allow him to think freely, but would force him to think
,” Mister Malfoy murmured.
But Ron would never, ever be careless enough to see money simply appear in his account and think nothing of it.  Anyone who thought so didn’t know Ron, didn’t know what he had had to do to save enough for uni and for Auror Academy, to save enough for his kids and Hermione and the lovely home they had.  That they thought Ron would take that money and go buy diamond earrings with it was just goddamn stupid.
A moan of relief opened Harry’s mouth, and he took the cock in, letting it chafe his lips on the way, letting it rest heavy on his tongue. At last, he had something to fill his mouth, to work all that wetness on. He tightened his lips and sucked, literally drooling around Draco’s cock.
Harry spread his hands.  “Even if he never did it by his own hand, he was responsible.  Dozens of witches and wizards died in the war.”
“Yes, Harry?”
“And?” Harry said, when nothing else seemed to be forthcoming.
it,” he said, pulling his hand out of Harry’s.
Adebayo made some reply, and Harry could feel him to his left, Teddy in a chair to his right, either side pressing in on him. Even if Harry asked Teddy to move his chair so Harry could get out, there was the pile of cloaks to be got through—the booth had a hook, but the number of cloaks had proven too much for it, and they had all fallen to the floor. People kept passing, so even if Harry got out past the cloaks, people would bump into him, and then he would be outside of the sound bubble; everything was too—
“Very good,” Harry said.
“You’re not helping,” Malfoy said, his voice harsh.
Casting about, Harry found Draco’s wand sitting on the bench next to a leather-bound ledger.  Draco must have set it there just before administering the potion.  “Here,” Harry said, taking the wand over to Malfoy.  “Do you know any spells yet?”
Harry felt like he didn’t need to pretend anymore, if he went out. He felt like he could go out. He could even probably enjoy the party, maybe. He felt all right. He felt good, even. The time alone, the water, the games with his wand—Fudge was stupid. Spragg was a fool. People shouldn’t get so het up, but people were that way. They had always been that way. Harry used to be able to handle it. He could handle it, he realized suddenly. He was ready to go back out.
Harry looked at him, the tight set of Malfoy’s lips, the gleam of determination in his eyes. “It’s from your home. Isn’t it.”
told me I couldn’t.  It wasn’t
“Another bad person.”
sacred to you, Spragg?” Savage wanted to know, her face twisted with fury. “Hogwarts is central to the traditions of—”
you know you can never have, for more reasons than just—because you hated me Potter; you rejected me, and you were friends with the wrong people.  When that happens, you take that want and bury it so deep that even thinking about it hurts.  Just like Dumbledore’s ghost.”  Draco looked down at his hand on the book, grey light from the window making a sort of halo around his slim body, lighting up his dull hair.  “When it hurts that much, you grow to hate it.  You really hate it.  All the way, deep down.  Sexual attraction and hate are basically the same things to me, Potter.  And I hate you,” he murmured.  “I’ve always hated you very, very much.”
Snape had come right away the first time it had happened, and Draco’s ageing was being sped up a good deal, so it should already be over, but it wasn’t.  Draco was still scrambling at his wet shirt, his breath coming in little hitches.  “What?” he gasped out.  “What—?”  He was looking at Harry, fully awake.
As Harry struggled for words, lines began to show in Kavika’s brow, as well as at the side of her mouth. “Oh, of course not, Harry. Too much thought can certainly be wasted on people like Vernon and Petunia Dursley. They’re not worth it.”
“Yes,” Ron said affably. “Sex.”
He looked so happy that Harry wanted to stand there watching him forever. Forcing himself to move away, Harry moved to the third iteration of the parlour, where a few members of Teddy’s Order were talking to the parents of some of the Squib kindergarteners. The kindergarteners themselves were circled around Teddy, entranced.
“We call them Muggles,” said Savage.
“It comes in handy,” Harry said, even though his ability to resist Veritaserum wasn’t necessary in answering questions about his beard.  Working most days, he didn’t really see the point in shaving.  He hadn’t been on a date in over a year.  Having a beard was just easier; the most he had to do was keep it trimmed and shave around the edges to keep the short-boxed shape.  He hadn’t had a haircut in a while either, but Malfoy didn’t need to know Harry was just lazy.  Let him wonder.
“But if I don’t like what?”
“Right.” Harry passed his thumb over the scar on the back of his other hand. “You said you wanted to discuss my treatment.”
Harry realized he was curious. Too curious to walk away, which was what his instincts told him to do. Sighing, he moved toward the viewing booth, and Malfoy moved out of it so that Harry had plenty of room in front of the Pensieve. Supposing that he was more than a match for anyone who couldn’t cast a Patronus, and that Crowley Stott was one of the safest places on campus, Harry decided to forget about what Malfoy might do to him as he looked into the Pensieve, and bent over to put his face in.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed.  “Where’d you get that paint?”
Draco made a retching noise.  “
“You said he’s changed,” Hermione said.
“Oh. That’s not the problem. It’s . . .” Harry looked at the leaves gently dancing in the breeze, the way Kavika had taught him to look—observing details, things he thought he knew already. The thick trunk of the tree outside the window looked still at a glance, but with concentration, Harry could see that it was moved too, by the wind. Branches connected to it moved with the trunk’s movement; twigs connected to the branches moved both with branches and with their own reaction to the wind. The slender stalk of a leaf moved with the combination of all these forces, actions upon it, helpless in connection to something much larger, and yet autumn proved that despite these connections tracing back to the trunk, each leaf was a life, able to die alone.
“Malfoy,” Harry said.
had changed, because when he looked at that memory now, Harry didn’t feel embarrassed. He didn’t feel stupid. He felt that he had been hurt. And thinking about that memory now, Harry felt tenderness for his past self, compassion for a boy under the stairs who had been kicked when he was down far more than once, sympathy for someone who couldn’t even feel pain as he bled, only humiliation.
Lips twisting, Kavika put her elbows on her thighs, leaning in closer to him. “Harry. Do you think of the trainees as being unsafe?”
“I said don’t
“That’s because I made it.  I’ve made all sorts of things, had you ever bothered to ask.  St. Mungo’s would have been lucky to have me, would they ever deign to hire a Death Eater.”
“You like the spell, then?”
“Go?”
“Stop it!”  Pushing aside Harry’s hand, Draco grabbed the ledger out of Harry’s lap, slammed it closed, then threw it at the hearth.
Harry rolled to the side a bit, trying to give Draco an angle to see their cocks touching.
“Shit,” he muttered.
23 years
“And you don’t want me to be killed.”
“I bet you’re waiting to get to the point,” said Sibanyoni. “The thing to know: therapy? There is no point. You say what you want. Think what you want. Learn to be happy with what you want. That’s it. That’s all there is. What do you want?”
Harry waited, listening to a rustle over the phone.
“Parkinson is nothing.”
Harry was about to snog him just to prove him wrong, so instead he said, “Have you tried snogging any Muggles?  I doubt they care you’re a Death Eater.”
of me, and that’s all I—fuck.  You’re never going to understand this.”
“Potentially,” Draco said, taking out some green moss.  “Would you sort this, Harry?  Take out all the brown bits, and then try to make it flat.”  Harry took the moss, and Draco went on spelling jars over to the workbench.  “Ideally, we’d like to grow you to the age you should be, right here in this present moment.  That way, you remember everything that happened right up to the moment the potion fell on you, as well as what happened after it.”
“They’ve invented mechanical weapons,” said Draco.  “Because they don’t have magic.  They have an Adam Bomb.  It has clouds made of mushrooms—fungus mists.  They killed a whole town.  They just wiped it out.  Not a small town, either.  It was—it was the size of Oxford.  And then they did it again.”
Slowly, Harry reached out, touching Malfoy’s arm. “Draco.”
Harry’s heart had grown so suddenly swollen with pity that it felt heavy in his chest. “And the Board,” he said thickly.
“What?” Harry said.
“Never heard of him.  He must not be very important.”  Malfoy sniffed again.  “Look here, Auror . . .”  Malfoy paused significantly, eyebrows up.  When Harry didn’t say anything, Malfoy put out his foot as if to tap it, but he was wearing grown-Malfoy’s shoes, which were probably a bit too big for his little foot to lift easily.  “Your name?”
“I know.”  Harry tried to extricate himself, but Draco clung to him.
None of those strangers had had owls, however—or at least, not owls that he knew of.  None of them had appeared out of thin air, or made paper float, or said things about magic, or told him he was thirty-one.
“What I don’t understand is why it matters so much to you,” Harry went on, his voice very, very clear. “Is Lucius Malfoy paying you?”
“The Order of the Phoenix didn’t take down the wards,” Harry said. “It was—”
“What about Malfoy?” Teddy asked, lifting another canapé off the same tray Harry had taken his from as he walked to join Harry and Vinicius against the wall.
“I thought I was going to come with you inside me.”
“I had to leave him alone,” Harry said.  “He was only eleven.”
“Yes, it’s very bad,” Baggot said. “Awful things happen. What can you do?”
Harry glanced down at the parchment in his hand.
“The only change I can see coming from this is Malfoy should be expelled,” Greengrass said.
Malfoy shook his head, a shallow jerk. “I didn’t,” he croaked.
“But we can make it
“I don’t,” Harry said.
“You’ve got more important things to worry about,” Harry said.  Hermione had a job in the Department of Mysteries, working as an Unspeakable.  Ron was having to work at the joke shop as he put himself through uni, while Hermione’s salary paid for their house.  On top of that Hermione was pregnant; the Granger-Weasleys were barely going to have time for themselves, much less for Harry.
“I think maybe I should read this letter,” Harry said, watching as Malfoy moved along the bench to poke at a bag of powder.
Everything leading up to Hagrid’s announcement that he was a wizard had been so strange; he had thought anything might happen. And now that Harry was really thinking about it, his life had always been strange—talking snakes, indestructible hair. What would it be like to never experience any of these strange things, and suddenly learn that the world around you was a lie?
Nyala laughed. “Do you want to try the Black dancing recessive gene?” she asked, holding out her hand.
“About moving on?” Harry was once again ensconced in the chair in Kavika’s office, hands folded in his lap this time, lit by the warm glow of Kavika’s magic lamps. “Sounds nice.”
“You said . . .”  Flicking off the light in the cupboard, Draco turned to face him, and Harry was suddenly struck by how tired he looked.  The spaces under his eyes looked smudged, as if with shadows or bruises.  “You said I was the only one you could trust.”
Harry glanced up from lacing the boots.  “You think I won’t want to go home because you think I’m thirty-one?” he asked, wondering whether he wore boots like this when he was thirty-one.  He must be a cool grown-up, one with a cool job that paid rather well.
“Well, but I’m already dating you.” Winking, Vinicius left them in search of Malfoy, who had ended his dance with Nyala.
.”  Draco’s cheeks were pink.  “I was just . . .”
“They wouldn’t have to travel to the locations,” Harry said, wanting to make Malfoy feel better. “If there was a way to have special guests, important people they need to know—”
Finally, Kavika swept her gaze away. When she spoke, her voice was low. “The Deal’s not going well, Harry.”
Harry stared at them. He had. He had wanted to find out.
“Oh, no!” Harry laughed harder.
“Good—slut—” Draco grunted again, then cried out, orgasm sounding as though it tore out of him as he fucked Harry roughly from behind, one of his first thrusts of it hitting that place inside of Harry that made Harry see stars. Then Harry was fucking with him, feeling like he was chasing his own orgasm, but no one was touching his dick. It didn’t matter. He couldn’t come like this, without touch, and it didn’t matter; he felt like a mindless animal fucking to the tune of being fucked. Oh, goddamn, he needed more.
“This is she,” said the voice, but it didn’t sound like her.  The voice was older, and somehow much sadder.
you here?” Greengrass asked, sounding bored. “Would you like to threaten to quit again if we don’t promise to graduate your precious Malfoy toy?”
“And my mother can cast one too,” Malfoy went on, still untying. “That’s why I know I can do it.”
Harry wanted to blurt, because there was an alpaca standing in Sibanyoni’s office. Harry wondered whether this was why he needed therapy. Would a healthy person shout at an alpaca? A healthy person wouldn’t need an alpaca; maybe Harry really
Harry lowered the bag.
“Five kilometres,” Harry said.
“That’s it?” Draco said, sounding disappointed.  “You want me to look in a Pensieve for hours on end?”
Kavika would say.
“Those are all for me,” Hermione explained. “I’ll ask him separately.”
“I—yeah.  Yeah,” Harry said.  “That’d be good.”
Harry shrugged. “Name it. Lining pure-blood pockets, locking non-mag-borns in prisons, et cetera, et cetera.”
Malfoy began to smirk, and Harry realized his mistake too late.
Ron shrugged. “Fairchild seems to be making it work with Mark.”
Harry didn’t want to talk about Reveal. The whole thing made him anxious, but it was obviously important, and suddenly he noticed how tired Hermione looked. For a moment, Harry felt guilty—he shouldn’t have been so focused on his own problems, but then he remembered he hadn’t. He’d practiced flying with Rose and made a potion (badly) with Hugo and helped make supper, and only after the kids were put to bed and Hermione and Ron had asked about work had Harry told them about Malfoy. Hermione and Ron wanted to know, he reminded himself. Harry wasn’t bothering them with his problems—they had asked.
,” Harry murmured. As soon as Harry began the spell, a green mist began to seep out around them, a malevolent force that sank down toward the floor, slithering around their legs.
“We will find grace.”
“And I need to be with you,” Draco said, “because I read those other files, and I have a better idea of what to look for.  Also, I know more about the wizarding world and could more easily field questions from anyone who stops us.  Therefore, it makes sense if . . .”  Trailing off, he fiddled with the placemat some more, and Harry felt his heart sink.
Harry kept his faint smile.  “Very impressive.”
“You tell me,” Harry said. “How’s the Reveal Deal going?”
“Okay,” said Yin. “We can talk about that. So, how did it feel without Malfoy there?”
“Because,” Malfoy said, then paused.  “Because Father says—isn’t that what grown-ups do?”
Then kept gasping.
“Andromeda.”  Letting go of Harry’s hand, Draco said took a step away.
“I can give it to you,” Malfoy whispered, rocking his hips again. “I notice everything you need, don’t I? And I always give it to you.”
“Practice?” Harry said. “Your form is perfect; if you keep at it, it’ll come more naturally.”
.”  Draco’s voice was vicious, his features still contorted in that hateful way.  “He hasn’t got anything except—except that
“—sparring now,” Harry finished.
“He’s afraid of your Patronus?” one of the trainees asked, but Harry ignored it, busying himself with Accio’ing the boggart and putting it in its trunk, so no one would have to see how red his face had got.
“Because I don’t feel what I’m supposed to feel?” Harry said.  “Did you want me to go off more?”
Draco had disappeared again. “Now read the next part.”
Doggedly, Malfoy shook his head. “No. I didn’t. It was wrong, what I said then. I was a fool.”
“I don’t really know it,” Harry said.
“I don’t know.” Malfoy jerked down his sleeve. “I’m terrible at Arithmancy.”
“Harry.”  Turning back to him, Draco moved Harry’s fringe aside, his eyes bright.
Harry was beginning to get a very bad feeling. “What for?”
Draco had said things like that to Harry almost all the way through Hogwarts.  Harry had always assumed Draco was making fun of him, but now he wondered how many times it had happened because Draco was honestly unable to understand what it might be like.  “No,” was all Harry said.  “I don’t.”
time for yourself, when everyone was just
“I know,” Draco soothed. “You need this lovely prick in your mouth. Do you want to lick it while I cast the spell on it? Just so you can have a little taste.”
Harry very much wanted to shove the earrings in a drawer and pretend he hadn’t seen.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Malfoy said.
The man, momentarily distracted by the flying papers, only narrowly blocked Draco’s spell, shouting, “
, went Harry’s brain, and he breathed again. In through the nose; you should feel your belly expand; out through the mouth; it should deflate—two, three four. In through the nose, two three four, out through the mouth, two three four. In through the nose—out. Okay. “Why?” Harry asked, finally dull now, instead of shocked.
“I’ll just go to sleep,” Harry said, not expecting to sleep at all.
“I just meant you’re clever enough to get around it.”
Harry couldn’t really imagine a pair of people who were entirely dedicated to making you happy.  It seemed like more than you would need, only Petunia always seemed to want to make Dudley happy, but he never seemed to be.  “Were you?” Harry asked.  “Happy, I mean.”
“Yes, thank you.  As you can see, I’m fine here,” Draco said, gesturing around the room, “so maybe you should go.”
“Don’t you?”
“Worried he’ll get hurt? Or worried he doesn’t need you anymore?” The sympathy on Doctor Yin’s face was so open and so kind, like someone Harry had known for a while.
was the one crying in the toilet during that first party at Hogwarts?” Ron asked.
“You have excuses,” Harry said. “Reasons for what you did. I know.””
Graduation day dawned softly, a golden gift unwrapping gently in papers of pink and butter yellow. By the time trainees, instructors, staff, and Aurors alumni gathered under the Timothy Tree, everything felt new, awake, and alive, the greens greener than they had been all spring, the birds louder. Teddy received his certification along with everyone else, though the
But how strange, that no one had come in to use the men’s.
Malfoy’s boggart seemed as though it should have been obvious, now that Harry thought about it. Of course Malfoy was terrified of revealing what he felt.
“We can get on,” Harry said.  “We can get on very well, and you don’t have to undo the potion, and I don’t have to go back.”
“But . . . not Dumbledore?”
know I was trying to get information from him, don’t you?”
“Draco.”  Harry’s voice caught in his throat.
The woman’s hand slid off her hip, her lips parting.  Then she seemed to notice Harry watching her and frowned.  “Well, what case is it?” she said, turning back to Draco.  “If it's the Ludville case, don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up—”
This year, however, Malfoy wasn’t the one cutting to the back of the queue. It was Nyala.
going to look like on their
“Yeah.” Running his fingers over the back of his fist, Harry thought of the summer spent with Teddy, recruiting members for his Order, working through connections to get the Order resources. They’d spent long nights at Rombe Pickle with Malfoy, Astoria, Nyala, Fairchild, Mark, a few other Aurors, a few non-magical family members and friends of the new recruits, planning what Reveal could look like if it was not organized by the Ministry for Magic. “That was enough.”
“Malfoy.”
“I don’t.”  Draco shuddered.  “I don’t want to live through this again.”
Teddy had chosen to be bald today. That should’ve made him look older, but it didn’t; it made him look younger than his eighteen years. When he didn’t change it, Teddy had a wide brow and a narrow chin, giving his whole face a sharp, lean look that Harry thought shouldn’t remind him of a wolf. Nothing about Lupin’s lycanthropy had been hereditary, but the look was still lupine anyway. Teddy’s eyes were green today, bright and burning, flicking down to Harry’s hand, which was touching the scar on the back of his other hand.
“That’s what I tell my trainees.”
“I meant nothing from you,” said Yin.
Draco kept tracing that scar.  “I see I shall have to be very explicit with you, then.”
“I thought you didn’t want to feed my addiction.”
“I told you, I don’t know,” Alby said, his voice trembling as he edged away.
Harry stared at them, the crystal toy gone slack in his hand. He stared at them for a while, because they had a taxidermy leopard, and dressed like Trewlaney, and had said he was early when he was on time. All of this, and he still felt better than he had with any other therapist so far. “Yeah,” he said, eventually. “It does suck.”
“I’m going to make a project of you?” Draco kissed him again.
“Leather.  Um.”  Harry swallowed, glancing over at Andromeda, who had sat down again to read the paper.  “Trousers?”
Harry stroked Draco’s back some more, running his other hand through Draco’s hair over and over.
That evening, Kingsley resigned as Minister of Magic.
“Why are you showing it now?”
“I guess,” Harry said.
Kavika’s sympathy was knowing, partly rueful. “Did you say all that to Teddy?”
“Got it,” said Gareth. “Later, Harry.”
Suddenly Malfoy began to cough, breaking out of his stance to cover his mouth. When he took his hand away, Harry could see Malfoy’s face had gone quite pink. “Pardon?”
“Bunk beds?”  Sounding interested, Draco got off the couch.
“Fuck,” Draco said, as Harry’s mouth followed the long thin line of a scar.
“Can we do that one?” Malfoy asked.
“You know him?” Harry asked, surprised.
Duggins was still writing furiously on his notepad, and Harry waited for him to stop. When at last he did, Duggins looked up, but he was poised to write, as though expecting Harry to say more.
Harry didn’t know what to do with the information he had been given, so he didn’t think about it.  Instead, he thought about the de-ageing potion.  They had to find the missing ingredient, so a cure could be made, but the potion was somehow connected to other cases Harry’s older self had been working on.  That meant criminals were involved.  That was probably why Draco thought it so dangerous that he had left without him.
Draco clutched at Harry’s arms.
“He’s not an Auror,” Harry said.
“I want to every way possible,” Harry said. “We have time.”
“Um. You can.” Harry gave the sausage roll to Nyala.
“There’s one more item,” Savage said to the Academy instructors seated around the table.
“Um . . .”
“Of course,” Malfoy said.  Fuck, his voice actually trembled.
“I guess,” Harry said doubtfully.  He wanted to tell Draco he seemed to have a skewed frame of reference, but he still wasn’t sure exactly what that meant, so he refrained.  “Is he friends with the brown-haired girl?  Granger?”
“What’s a mobile?” Harry asked, since he didn’t particularly care about Dudley being worried.
“Why is this only about Malfoy?” Penelope asked Savage. “Is it impossible to imagine that there could be
“You’re right, Harry,” Draco said.  “Like I said, I was frustrated.  I got irritable, and I’m sorry.”
“I don’t,” Harry said.  “Who told you that?  Was it your dad?”
“It’s got Pensieve fluid in it,” Malfoy said, impatiently.  “And coca.”
“I—don’t usually have visitors.”
“Ah, no.”  Draco seemed to find something very interesting in the desk, because he leaned in to look at it, fiddling with one of the drawers.  “You weren’t friends with prats, only—only the right sort of people, who you could always identify all by yourself.”
“A fire.”
“Did you forget you had a slave who would do it for free?” Malfoy said, scrubbing at the table with a rag.  “Or maybe you just didn’t want to have to look at my pasty Death Eater face.”
“Many witches do use brooms, yes.  Some cultures more often use carpets, but I only know flying on a broom.  Would you like to learn?”
“Oh, right, of course.” As the stag whooshed away, Robards just laughed. “Why didn’t you call one of your other father figures? Oh, right. They all died.”
“I think you’re probably a damn good one,” Malfoy said, then immediately flushed red.  “Give me that,” he said, taking a quick sip of the Wood-Eye Lye.  “You weren’t meant to ask me any questions before I had the counteragent,” he added, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
Harry tried to read the book, but working out the letters one by one with his finger was so dull, and the moving pictures made the letters seem to jump around even more.  For a long time—probably nearly fifteen minutes or so—Harry really worked at it, but after that he started just looking at the pictures.  They showed the wand movements the words described, and he’d read enough about the first spell to figure out the incantation.  Swishing the wand around, he tried to do the folding spell, using a flannel on one of the tables for practice.
Harry thought of Malfoy, bent over a table at Rombe Pickle, where they had all pored over maps of the wards around wizarding Britain, comparing them to non-magical road maps and urban areas, determining where first contacts might occur, how they would be handled. The magic light had made his hair almost gold, his sunken eyes and too-sharp nose softened by the glow.
Thank you to buildyourwalls, icmezzo, seraphcelene, and siemejay. <3
“Don’t . . .”  Malfoy shuddered, then took several shallow breaths, not looking at him.  “Don’t say those things.  With your voice.  Those things you—don’t do words.”
“And I—I live alone?”
“Um.”  The sitting room was full of books, but Harry didn’t know what Draco had, and who knew whether any of the books were appropriate for children.  Remembering the book Draco had given his younger self, Harry said, “Accio
“You won’t
Harry felt a blush begin to start low in his chest, threatening to rise up toward his neck.  Malfoy’s weight and colour had continued to improve over the past year.  Harry had tried not to notice, but it still bothered him.  It bothered him that it bothered him; it bothered him that it reminded him of things he didn’t like to think about.
“Yes,” Draco breathed. His hand came up and they both watched it, holding their breaths now as the both of them watched Draco’s long fingers almost hesitantly approach Harry’s cock. When the fingers were close enough to touch, Draco only used his thumb, a brush against the wet tip, and Harry wanted to complain but for the fact that Draco made a sound, a soft little broken needy sound, just from touching it.
here?”
Alby feigned confusion.  “I can’t think what you—”
Draco sagged a bit under Harry’s hands, but seemed to be feeling the pain less.  “Who else?” he demanded.
“Can you . . .” Harry shifted under him, seeking a different touch—anything, and Draco immediately changed the angle of his hand, scraping his fingernail along the length of Harry’s cock.
Yin’s brows went up. “He’s still Draco Malfoy.”
. Harry touched the scar on the back of his hand. “So,” he said finally, “I feel like you want me to say no, but we—we protect each other. Even when there’s not . . . you know they’re like me. From the war, I mean. So even if there’s not danger, we still feel like we need to. Keep each other safe. But they’re not my godson. If that’s what you meant.”
“Kingsley already has an Order of the Phoenix,” Harry tried to say, but Teddy was already shaking his head.
“It’s Death Eaters that are the problem,” said Savage. “They
“Very good, Harry,” Draco said, smiling again.  “What else did you learn?  How about the dust-banishing one?”
Harry raised his brows.  “You don’t think older people can be good-looking?”
“Don’t you like it?” Draco asked, when Harry took it out of the brown paper wrap.  “I thought you liked mine.”
“I can’t believe we’re even considering this,” said Penelope to the instructors of the Auror Academy seated around the table.
Draco’s squeezed Harry’s hand.
“I didn’t know she painted,” Harry said.  “That’s a very pretty colour.”
Harry glanced back at Vinicius, feeling somewhat uncomfortable with this phrase. “I thought you thought he was out of your league?”
“It was even messy on old-me.”
“Yes, it is.”
Malfoy had made a splash also in
After that, Harry touched the numbers for the taxi service, giving them the address for Grimmauld Place.  They said it would be about twenty minutes, but Harry decided it would be best to wait outside, just in case someone was deciding to rob his house again.  As he went to go stand at the kerb, the fawn followed him.  “Why don’t you go wait inside?” Harry told it.  “I’m sure you can be just as useless in there as you are out here.”
Draco took a deep gasping breath. Then another one. On the third one, he finally let go, letting Harry’s hand squeeze his cock instead.
Twenty minutes later, the wards alerted Harry that something was moving through them.  Harry had to call back the owl and take away the notes Draco had written.  “Goyle is in Azkaban,” Harry explained to Draco.  Goyle had got off in the post-war trials with a magical restriction, just like Draco, but he’d broken it two years in and been arrested.  After he’d been released he’d done it again and been arrested again.  “Crabbe is dead.”
