“You know dental spells are dehydrating. I can’t believe they let you go without someone to take care of you.”
“I didn’t start out vanilla, I er, I didn’t start at all.” Harry closed his eyes, finding comfort in the bonds around his hands and feet. “You’ll be my first.”
Harry crawled towards the bed, both because he didn’t trust himself to stand with his tingling feet and his dizzying arousal, and because Draco hadn’t given him permission to stand. Harry wanted to please the man more than anything.
“Yes,” Harry says. He’s not entirely sure he cares about the hallway, but the way one of Malfoy’s hands has moved to rest against Harry’s hip, thumb stroking circles against the exposed skin between his shirt and his trousers definitely deserves encouragement.
“I think if we did a scene when I’m in one of those moods I wouldn’t be able to use the safeword. So maybe if we just have a question before starting, like ‘should we do a scene?’ then we could avoid that happening?”
Harry diced another tomato and some basil, gently tossing them together with some salt and olive oil and spooning them onto toast. Draco watched him work in silence, and Harry could feel the eyes on him. Draco’s gaze made Harry’s skin tingle, and he felt overheated despite his light clothes. The small mention that he was attracted to Draco seemed to have opened the door to the three months of attraction that had accumulated between them, and Harry was burning with it. Burning with how Draco
Malfoy brings the end of the rope down over Harry’s hip and wraps it around his thigh. It’s high enough that it rests against the base of Harry’s balls, and when Malfoy brings the rope back to tie it to his back he lays it across Harry’s arsecheek and pulls it a little, exposing Harry’s opening. Harry bites his lip and breaths harshly through his nose while Malfoy does the other side. This is the final bit of the rope, and Harry shivers with the thought of what comes next.
“You needed some air?” Malfoy says, voice dripping with disbelief. He looks – cold. Like he used to, closed off and inaccessible to Harry. Harry hasn’t realised how much more he’s been seeing of Malfoy’s expressions until they’re gone.
He takes a deep breath and takes the final step up, standing fully on the stage in his jeans and shirt, listening as the people watching him breathe and shift in their seats. He wonders if any of them are getting themselves off already, hard with anticipation, just like he is.
Harry tries again to reach out, but his hand bounces off the barrier. “Bloody hell Hermione, will you take this thing down?”
“Thank Merlin for that,” Hermione said and sat down too. “Though I’m guessing now you don’t know where to go?”
When Malfoy nods Harry grabs a tray and starts piling on his own favourite breakfast foods, as well as bacon, eggs, half a grapefruit and some toast for Malfoy. He keeps conscious of his wrist, ready to move if it gets cold but the Dining Hall is small enough that he doesn’t really have to worry.
Once Harry’s got the pillow in place Draco presses against him with two fingers and Harry groans as he feels them stretch their way into his body. Merlin, he loves that feeling. He pushes down on them, silently begging for Draco to move.
“Good morning,” Malfoy says. He looks confident, standing in front of the class in his dark green robes. Confident and yet somehow nervous at the same time. It’s not really noticeable, and Harry suspects the only reason
“I’ve got this fundraiser for making Wolfsbane Potion available to anyone who needs it tomorrow,” Harry said, smiling at Ron and Hermione. “There were so many new werewolves after the war, and they were never treated properly so the numbers just continue to grow every full moon. Everyone should have the option of a potion that can prevent them from hurting themselves and others, don’t you agree? It’s terrible, really, that it’s not just given to all werewolves for free. I really hope we can raise money and awareness about the issue tomorrow.”
Harry feels a bit odd, walking naked and hard through his living room and up the stairs to his bedroom. He throws himself on the bed, and tries to calm his breathing. His cock is wet with precome, and he grabs onto the sheets in an effort to keep from touching it. He listens to the sound of Draco wandering around downstairs, opening and closing cupboards and wonders what the fuck he’s doing. It isn’t long though, before he hears footsteps on the stairs.
“May they live long and prosper,” Draco adds. He clicks his glass against Harry’s and when their eyes lock Harry’s relieved to see he isn’t the only one who’s holding back a bit of sadness at the news. But it’s just fear of abandonment or something. He’s not going to lose Ginny just because she’s getting married, is he?
“So, are you being quiet because you don’t know how to talk to me in person – or because you’re feeling all the attraction we’ve built up over the past few months with no-one to direct it to hit you like a Bombarda to the chest?” Draco said it casually, like admitting to growing hard watching another man eat tomatoes was a completely normal thing to do. Harry thought he could hear the slight worry beneath the casual tone though, and he appreciated that Draco was at least asking, instead of jumping to the conclusion that Harry didn’t like him.
He still wanted to do something that was helpful, but maybe he could find a way to spread warmth without being on fire. Harry figured he had to act while he still felt the determination M had instilled in him, so he wrote Millie and invited her to lunch. She was good at her job, she would help him figure out how to proceed. She was also the only friend he hadn’t invited to the cabin yet, out of some strange fear that he’d see her and decide to go back to being ‘the Chosen One’.
When Harry starts fucking Malfoy they don’t tell anyone. It’s pure chance really, running into each other at the Muggle club. The sex is amazing though, after years of pent up tension between them. Malfoy isn’t scared to take Harry hard and fast, and he’s not scared when Harry gives as good as he gets. The next time they see each other, at a Ministry function, they do it again. And then again, and again. There isn’t any point telling anyone, Harry thinks, because it’s just sex and it won’t last. It’s not worth the trouble of seeing the hurt in his friends’ eyes at realising he’s being fucked by an ex-death eater.
Harry suddenly wanted to turn back to the tomatoes instead of having this conversation. Had Draco really come here to confront him about knowing who he was for a little over a week before they were supposed to meet?
“You’re missing one too,” Harry says, only realising after he’s said the words that he’s effectively admitting that the thing with Malfoy
Malfoy looks surprised that Harry’s answered at all, lips parting and eyebrows raising ever so slightly.
Harry groans and speeds up his hand. It only takes a few more seconds before the heat in his spine overflows, spreading through his body. Harry gasps and moans as pleasure rushes through his veins, making his whole body tense and shake.
“Er, it’s – an anxiety thing,” Harry says. It’s not entirely untrue, though it’s an issue he learned to deal with years ago. “I just feel vulnerable, like someone might burst in and catch me off guard.”
They breathed in the silence and darkness of the room for less than the second it took Malfoy to begin shouting about his wards and common decency and “Oh, Salazar, Potter, have you Splinched us? Are we in the Nothingness? Did you fuck up Apparating so badly that --”
“Right you are, Chosen One, this is your life now. And I didn't choose you. Bugger him the fuck out,” Malcker commands.
It wasn’t often crimes (Wizarding, Muggle, or otherwise) occurred so near Harry’s place of residence. It had happened once before, and he was asked to speak as witness despite the fact he never saw the mugging take place. He only woke when the shouting began. Habit, he supposed at the time. What it was now, he had no idea and was reluctant to find out.
“I doubt it, Weasley.” Malfoy said. He cleared his throat, obnoxiously. “You and Potter, of course.”
“I know, Arys. I know.” Harry gritted. “But I can’t do anything about it.” Harry went on, as Arys continued writing, maybe to fill the space and maybe because he needed to talk himself through it aloud, “I thought all this was through. Like Voldemort wasn’t enough for a lifetime.” Harry slammed himself back into a chair and took the note Arys passed him.
“Of course. My pub-- Ms Wronsky was making us tea in the kitchen. Do you mind if we conduct the interview down there?” Harry suggested.
"And the smartest witch of our age!” Ron proclaimed, and they cheersed and spilled some more on Harry. Ron leaned in laughing to mop it up.
“If it’s not too much trouble, like Ms Wronsky said, just one Auror is fine.” Harry smiled, “I’d appreciate it, and I’ll never hear the end of it if I don’t.”
Whittery assured. “And again, if you’d sleep sounder with a Guard outside, just say the word and we’ll have them here in a jiff.”
Malfoy shut his mouth. Blinked. Inhaled. Pinched his nose. Blinked. shut his eyes. looked at Harry. He inhaled and rolled his eyes so dramatically Harry thought they'd get stuck like that and let Harry enter.
“We’re going to skip the part in which I remonstrate you for having left me out of this. I had to hear it from bloody MARSHALL IN THE FLOO DEPARTMENT! HAROLD JAMES, THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME. AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR. NO, AM I MAKING MYSELF SO VERY SOLID THAT IF YOU CROSS ME YOU WILL RUN SMACK INTO ME AND ESCAPE WITH LITTLE MORE THAN YOUR LIFE. AM I, HAROLD?”
“Quack, QUACK!” He waved his hands. Harry lifted it and sloshed a bit of wine while doing so. “All right, all right.” His red ears and off-balanced grin made Harry wonder who was the more drunk in this conversation.
Ron opened his mouth in realisation. "Harry! You've shagged all of Gryffindor's famous Quidditch captains!"
“Are you finished? Yeah, okay, brilliant. Let’s go.” Harys shook his head. Arys clothing was really not the issure at the moment and really Malfoy was the absolute limit.
“All right, all right, I’m going.” He stuffed the grapes in his mouth, and smiled around them. Arys raised her chin, pursed her lips and gave him the thumbs up. then shuffled him off into the fray.
“Hello, I’m Gilderoy Cockhart.” He informed the mirror. He gave a big false Gilderoy smile. It didn’t sparkle.
“Ron has something he'd like to say to you!” He said and grinned devilishly at Ron, who was now breathing heavily through his nose.
Mémene had outdone herself, sending the newest and bluest of formal robes. Robin’s-Egg blue, with the tiniest beige speckles, just like the bloody eggs. They weren’t unattractive, per se, but they certainly weren’t anything Harry would ever choose for himself voluntarily.
“... Mother’s sacrifice, I can’t begin to fathom, but I do care so dearly for you, Harry...” Arys monologued on, letting Harry work through everything in his mind.
He appeals to Harry, last. His eyes are pleading, and so fucking pathetic. And it’s Hogwarts, and Harry can’t say no. But, he could say no. Or he could say nothing, and resign from “Cupboard” duties altogether. He could even just ask one of Malker’s relatives to give him the big sloppy snog, already.
“Erm, yeah, I’m pretty sure that’s what the girl said. She was a bit hysterical though, I guess it could have been something...” And Harry withered into silence.
His spine was aching, his formals somewhat crumpled, (Memene would not be pleased, Harry had a feeling these were meant to last a season at least), and their  sleeves and his chin drooled all over.
“The fuck was that for, arsehole?” Ron yelled over the orchestra. "You made me look a tit! That was the bloody Minister!"
After the Unbreakable was sworn -- during which Malfoy grumbled endlessly about necessary and uneceassary precautions and fools not being suffered gladly, and so on -- it was past dawn. All and all, things had only taken about three hours. Arys left from the Dark Room, Malfoy left from the Dark Room, complaining but immensely self-satisfied with the work he’d done, and Harry went back up to the attic to try and sleep some.
“Merlin, Potter, really, announce yourself kindly. Someone could be severely damaged, I’d hate for it to be me.”
Arys glared, fished in her bag before going up, slapped a piece of parchment onto the table, and said, “Begin,” and left.
Malfoy huffed into the cushioned seat. He grabbed the piece of parchment from Harry’s hands and began writing. He passed it back after an agonizing minute.
“Ron, there you are! Christ, it’s --” Harry stopped himself when Ron and his companion turned. Reliable as ever, Ron was doing some upchatting of his own, and to the Minister no less.
“Harry Potter! It is a true pleasure.” Msr Tepouge disregarded his proffered hand and kissed his cheeks, one, and the other. Mr Renninger laughed at Harry’s mild expression and clasped his limp hands jovially.
“Yeah, you’re welcome, for saving your arse all those bloody times I did, and saying nice things about you to the Wizengamot, and to the Prophet, and, oh, right, for not punching your stupid pointy nose back into your stupid pointy face every time I see you.” Harys muttered.
“You tried to marry me off.” He glared down at her with equal violence, and then smiled. “Now, we’re even.”
“Fuck, Arys, where did you come from? I really should be used to this by now. How am I not used to this by now?” He shook his head and she handed him a napkin and he dabbed at his lips.
“I appreciate your invitations, very much so. Unfortunately, I’ll be quite busy the next couple of days. Perhaps we can schedule an outing to Diagon Alley, or something, erm, next week. Have you been yet?”
“Right, sorry. You’re right. Erm, you can only Apparate in and out this room. Loads of enchantments. What’s the best way?” It was dangerous business to go around interrupting people casting and playing with complex magic, Malfoy was right. The Dark Room was the Dark Room for a reason, after all.
“Oh, trespass sweetly urged.” Harry growls. Malfoy’s breath smells like wine and grapes and his pupils are black, blacker, blackening. Harry inhales.
"Tis I, the Frenchiest Fry," Arys said through clenched teeth and jaw, puckered lips and a whitening face.
“What do you think you’re doing?” He asked menacing, silky, as Harry slammed his glasses onto his face. And then he saw Malfoy’s face collapse into hysterical laughter.
She pointed at Malfoy, put the same finger to her lips, and then drew its nail laterally across her neck. She slowly lifted her wand and lifted the spell on Malfoy. He immediately opened his mouth, and then shut it again in a second, thinking he was making an hysterical joke. Arys was unamused. Harry couldn’t help a small chuckle into his shirt.
“Harry, old sport! I was wondering when you’d turn up! How do you?” Minister Phoebus Perfidy doffed his shoulder.
"It was one shag! I thought we’d cleared everything up. Is he Gryffindor's most famous Quidditch captain?"
“It shouldn’t be.” Malfoy made some prodding movements with his wand, and hummed. “Yes, the Spell-Masters should read it as seven months.”
“I am. Off you pop,” Malfoy waved Harry away. Harry took a moment to pause in the doorway to watch him work. It reminded him unsettlingly of Dumbledore and Voldemort’s Cave. He still couldn’t speak with magic like that, but it seemed Malfoy could. It was as entrancing, as eerie as it was when he had watched Dumbledore so many years ago.
Secondly, Harry did miss the Sneak-spelling, which was not usual for him. He wasn’t only physically exhausted by the murder, but magically as well. He would have to begin exercising more regularly again.
“Please, Draco,” Harry says, mind too flooded with sensation to make the words more descriptive. Draco’s tongue is alternating between pressing a strong tight heat around his cock and teasing deliciously at the tip. Harry doesn’t know if he wants to move up into the mouth or down onto the fingers, so his hips move jerkingly in desperate search of more.
For a ridiculous moment Harry considers telling Draco that he does drink on Fridays and Saturdays like a normal person, thank you very much. Fridays he has a pint with Ron, and Saturdays he’ll have a glass of wine at the Burrow. Which means his ‘nights out’ have to be Sundays or weekdays. He imagines telling Draco that it’s more of an emotional hungover than anything else, since there aren’t hangover-cures for those. He imagines just telling Draco everything, but then he imagines the worry Draco only barely manages to hide behind his scathing comments changing into a full-blown panic.
“You don’t have to claim the aromantic orientation if you don’t want to,” Draco says. “Just – don’t try so hard to push yourself to want something you don't. I’ve hated seeing how hard you tried to want things you didn’t, with Daniel, and how guilty it made you feel.”
Harry arrives at the club completely sober for the first time ever, his Glamour firmly in place and Draco’s breath on his neck. The bouncer gives him a kind smile when he enters, and Harry feels Draco slip through the door next to him, invisible under Harry’s cloak.
If nothing else, work keeps them busy, and Harry’s exhausted enough by the time he gets home that he goes straight to bed and falls asleep immediately.
Harry releases his grip on one of Draco’s forearms, and reaches between their bodies to close it around his cock. He wants Draco to see how much he wants this, how good he makes him feel.
The girls kissed his palms. The elder stroked the sleeves of his robes. Sage green, Memene rarely failed.
“Yes.” Arys declared. Harry almost snapped his spine about to whip around to her, but, knowing his thoughts and movements as well as she did, Arys partially-Incarceroused him still. “Harry would like a Guard. At least one Auror. Wouldn’t you, fawn?” She looked at him, all honey and imploring. Her fresh orange hair certainly helped the act. He felt the invisible ties lift. “If you won’t do it for your own peace of mind, do it for mine, will you?” She got bright around the eyes. The fake tears. Oh, Arys. The queen of Slytherins.
“I, well, I was asleep. I woke up to the ward going off. It took me a while to inspect it and figure out what was going on. Then I heard sirens and saw the body from my window.”
He escorted the two Aurors down to the kitchen where Arys had done a dab hand at cleaning up the mess Harry had left. She even managed to spell her bathrobe and into a suit and heels. The pool of goo was gone from the floor, and Harry pulled out chairs for the three of his ‘guests’.
“Harry.” She amended, softer, as she caught a camera flash nearby. “So nice of you to attend.” She kissed his cheek and lit his face with her smile.
“Listen, Malfoy, this is really serious. I wouldn’t be here otherwise. You know as well as I do how terrifically we don’t get on. But I need your help, or something probably  terrible is going to happen.” Harys pleaded.
“You hate asking me just about as much as I’m going to hate doing it, I’m sure. And as custom dictates --”
“While it is not his most original, well-crafted, lyrical, or even interesting piece, it is William Shakespeare populaíre. You ought to enjoy it.” Phineas says.
“Should? I can’t really have any shoulds or variables, Malfoy. See, I might be accused of murder, or lying, or some shit, if this doesn’t work, okay? So I need to know.”
“Malfoy, you’re not gon'o use that thing on either us. You know inclimidation doesn’t work on me an’longer, but as’lways good efforts NOT.” Harry pauses to Invisible-Incarcero Malfoy, “Ron, but we all replied for August? I though the wedding was -- what happened! ARE BOTH OF YOU OKAY?!”
He suspects it more likely that Malcker simply flushed himself into the Ministry one day, Transfigured the old Spin Wizard (Bertram Yule) into a chair, sat upon him and started yelling and cursing at everyone in -- and out of -- range. Harry’d not long ago coerced Ron into going through the Ministry’s Employee Database to check up Malcker’s family records. Harry had earnestly believed it at least 5% possible that the Malckers had Dementor on someone’s side.
They had Tea in the Ministry’s fancy tearoom. They were served chocolate jam and Belgian waffles. Harry’s stomach was not at all complaining.
“Good. So, do that, and then get started on the new one. The one I “invented”? You remember, right?” Malfoy was started to go gloss-eyed, and Harry was beginning to worry he’d forgotten their agreement and the urgency of the situation.
By the time Harry reached the end of the story, Arys hair was literally on fire, and the goop melting from her face.
“Is that all then, or, do you need anything else?” Harry asked, pretending to sound tired, worried, and eager to assist all in one small question.
“He’s a chap, he’s a chap, Harry!” Ron insisted, waving his glass about. “He’s a fucking chap! ‘S told-rable.” He admits, whispering very loudly.
Showered and having acted aloud the first act of Romeo and Juliet, much to Phineas’ displeasure, Harry was now running up and down the kitchen steps, waiting for Arys to arrive.
He stands, scours the scene for her. He watches a group of what looks like Slytherin first-years wave Perfidy off.
“Is that your closet in there? You have a closet, that you can literally walk into, like a seperate room? I mean, mine makes sense, but how many bloody sets of black dress robes does one person need?”
“Look, I’m just. I’ve got a feeling. And if you don’t hurry the Muggles are about to cart everything away and we’ll lose this one.”
If you made it this far, thanks. I hope you got something out of it or will be taking something from it. Oh my goodness, it's hailing outside! See ya later!
“One person may never know.” Malfoy stepped out from the closet, dressed spectacularly in another one of his black dress robes, and smirked. “How’s my hair? Will there be photographers?”
“I’ve informed Perfidy you won’t be “in Cupboard” today. Let us pray upon the Gorgons that Malker gets no word of all of this.”
“Yes, we can do that. But first, we’ve got a few questions.” Rosier harshed. Good cop, bad cop, just like on the telly but in his own kitchen, Harry thought.
“”Course, dear. I just came to say I didn’t tell the Aurors any specific length of time so let’s go with seven months. Can you do that? Is that too long?” Harry chewed.
“Harry, this’ll be a huge event. Everyone from Perfidy to yes, your friends, will be in attendance,” Arys insists. He curls up his stomach to touch the broom, then curls back down to touch the floor. Trying to listen. “I’ve got it from Zuri in Foreign Relations that dignitaries from various countries’ Magical Creatures branches will be present. It’s an international interest, fawn, you’ve got to look your best. Jared has it at least half the Prophet staff will be there!”
“But, ah, now,” Perfidy resumes, straightens, and blush rising, “I must leave you in the more than capable hands of your great old Professors, as I’ve unfortunately got to get back to the business of running this darn -- dear country.” He gives one more slightly-composed smile and nods hurriedly from the dias.
“Eurgh. Please say they aren’t matching like that one supper, where was it? Oh, no, it was the Mermish Conference thing. They’re not matching, are they?” Harry prayed.
“Thank you, again. Erm, one last question,” He stammered, “When will the Guard be here? Just so I can tell Arys and make sure she sleeps some tonight?”
“YEAH, MY BUGGERING WIFE! ALL RIGHT, MALFOY?” and Ron finally manages to withdraw his wand from his pocket and holds it up over Harry’s head and utters, “TARANT--” but Harry slaps his wand down.
Harry awoke some time in the late morning. He’d gotten to the part after Romeo and Juliet meet and the party ends before Apparating himself upstairs. He didn’t fall asleep on couches anymore; Harry Potter was not the kind of person who fell asleep on couches or loveseats anymore. It was most likely something Arys had knackered into him, either that or, it was the result of having endured too many nights with Phineas waking him up, repeatedly, and in various loud and annoying ways. (One time, he somehow managed to get all of the dead Headmasters and Headmistresses to join him in a terribly pitchy rendition of some Muggle song called “Back in Black”, (which then led Harry to seriously question what exactly McGonagall got up to in that office).
“Is it selfish that I really like it when you talk about me?” Harry asks, wondering if that bothers Draco. If it’s weird that he so desperately wants to hear Draco praise him.
Draco looks at his watch and nods reluctantly. "Fine, go and get some bloody sleep will you, Potter."
Harry knew Sirius had believed what he said when Harry told him he was gay. That he’d seen Harry facing the same misery as they had, and had hoped to prevent it. The world had changed though, while Sirius was in Azkaban. And after the war was finally won, it kept changing. Harry wasn’t afraid of being queer. He didn’t mind if people knew - he wouldn’t be hated for it.
“What’s that stick?” Harry asks, praying that Draco can hear him through the door. He’s not in the room, he can’t be or he’d have brushed against Harry by now to let him know. What if Crabbe put spells on the door? What if Draco hasn’t heard anything?
When his wand vibrates to tell him it’s 5.30 am Harry showers and gets dressed. He doesn’t wash his hair, the potion in it still smells of Draco and Harry doesn’t want to let go of that final piece. Not if it’s all he’s going to have. He tries to pull the Pensieve with him into the hall, but memories are apparently heavy because the thing doesn’t budge now that he’s filled it up.
Harry let Ron’s words sink in. He was right, of course. Harry had made speeches about that, because he believed it. Believed that the people who were irredeemable had been locked away and that everyone else deserved a chance at redemption.
“Please,” he says, desperation making his voice tremble. He doesn’t know how to explain what he wants so he turns his head and tilts it, exposing his neck and using a hand to gently guide Malfoy’s head to where he wants him.
Harry smiles and holds back the laugh that wants to break through his lips at the embarrassed look on Draco’s face. “Alright, I’ll let you know.”
Draco flips him the finger and lowers his face into the Pensive. Harry decides not to follow him in. He remembers it well enough, and he doesn’t need to watch Draco watch him.
“You won’t regret it Potter, or maybe you will. Maybe I’ll make it so good nobody else will ever measure up and you’ll spend the rest of your life missing being fucked by me.”
“Yeah,” Harry admits. He shifts to the side, resting his head against Draco’s chest. His heartbeat is a steady, calming rhythm against Harry’s ear.
Harry closed down the Po-cuter and stared at it. M used to have a crush on him. His celebrity crush was Harry Potter, and the thought terrified Harry. His experience dating fans was not good, but then again, M had said it wasn’t really a celebrity crush. That he’d crushed on Harry while seeing him trip over his feet and mess up in class. If nothing else, Harry was M’s type. The idea helped soothe the anxiety he’d felt that M would be horrifically disappointed upon seeing him.
“I was just –,” Malfoy trails off, but it doesn’t matter. The thought he started completes itself as a whisper in Harry’s ear.
“I said, I was hoping you would stay behind after class. I have something I would like to discuss with you.”
Draco pulls off him with a satisfied grin. “Merlin, you’re so eager for it. You look so good when you’re chasing pleasure.”
Harry arrived at the Burrow in time for dinner on Christmas Eve. After agreeing on a place, date and time to meet up with Draco he felt a bit lighter. He didn’t want to rob Draco of the first ‘blind date’ he wanted by revealing he knew who the man was, but he didn’t want to continue talking too much in depth when he felt the power-balance was off. To keep busy he’d Apparated to smaller Muggle towns to attend Christmas markets and shop for presents. Once he’d left the cabin it felt weird to stay there without leaving at all. He had missed seeing other places, other people. He didn’t miss the fame or the shit that went with it, but he didn’t want to lock himself away anymore either. The Christmas markets had been a lovely start to a more social life. He’d tasted new foods and gotten ideas for his own cooking and baking, and people left him alone – even the couple who had looked at his scar and clearly knew who he was.
Harry walks into the empty club feeling almost electric. This will be something new entirely. Not because of the bondage; he’s tried that with Ron a couple of times just to make sure he's into it. And he knows he likes making porn for other people to watch. No, what’s new is that there will be people watching him as it happens. People Harry can see and hear.
“Always forgetting you’re a wizard,” Malfoy says, smiling as he climbs into the bed to lie on his side next to Harry.
Harry sets the Pensive down and tries to think of anything to say that will make this better, but Draco will know he’s lying no matter what he says. They know each other too well, and not well enough.
Draco places a hand on the back of Harry’s neck, stroking gently and playing with Harry’s hair. Harry tenses for the next blow of the belt, but it doesn’t come, and he relaxes into Draco’s touch. His cock is hard and aching between his legs, and he doesn’t know if he wants Draco to touch it or keep spanking him, so he doesn’t speak. He doesn’t have to. Draco has him.
Ginny’s blush deepens and she looks between the club and Harry with anxious eyes. “Yeah, I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I figured somewhere with alcohol wouldn’t be the worst.”
It’s starting to become a real problem, because being around Malfoy all the time and hearing what he really feels about Harry is making it absolutely impossible for Harry to make himself believe that he doesn’t have a crush. Harry finds himself caring less and less that he has to follow Malfoy around, because he actually enjoys Malfoy’s company. He enjoys the kind words in his ear when Malfoy is correcting his potion, and the appreciative grunt when Malfoy saw Harry bend over to pick up a dropped quill. At least Harry knows he isn’t the only one who’s feeling some sort of attraction. He knows Malfoy feels it too, but he can’t just kiss him and go ‘I heard you thinking about it’. Well he could. But it would definitely be creepy and weird if he did.
“Malfoy. What’s this finally happening? You an'...” Harry struggled to find the insult. He blinked and chewed his frown.
Arys held up a finger. Shook her head sharp. Gestured pointedly all around the kitchen. Conjured a plume and parchment and began writing while speaking, “The Guard, Harry? I’m worried. Isn’t that much obvious? A murder, or something, happened just outisde your door this evening. Night. Day, whatever time it bloody is. I highly doubt the chances of it being mere coincidence.”
“For that I am grateful, Potter. Truly.” Malfoy yelled, muffled by some bodily movement going on in the other room. Harys had a horrfic suspicion, just then.
“Fine. As you will," Arys says. "And you’d better learn the proper name of Ms. Granger’s Foundation before tomorrow evening. I’m not helping you, don’t give me that face.” Arys rolls some of her silver hair into a curler. “I’ll make arrangements with Memene now. Tomorrow, 1400. See you then, you sodding brat.”
He looked up, agitated, more and more agitation this night, and was about to tell her off SILENTLY, when he realised she was looking not at him but at someone behind him.
He shoveled himself into them as quickly as he could. He went to the mirror. The speckles swirled about in the fabric. They weren’t the worst, he thought.
Fourth, he was already an idiot for what he was considering, but he really had no other options at this juncture.
“I know, fawn. The scar that kept you alive seems to keep you just as near death as well.” And then she went on to wax philosophy, to let Harry read her note, he was sure.
He mucked about with all of the guests in the foyer, introducing himself and going through the “Close Friend’s Charity Gala pleasantries” -- Arys had a list of ‘pleasantries’ for every type of event they encountered -- until finally an hour later he was able to escape his “Harry Potter: Celebrity” duties and find Ron in the ballroom.
Arys clicks and pushes him along until he’s directly behind the team. The Hall rushes by in House colours and sky blues and clouds. The large doors bang close after them.
A crying girl and two policemen were huddled near enough that Harry could hear their conversation. The stranger was, apparently, walking her home from a second date. No, she didn’t know him very well. It was only a second date. She couldn’t remember exactly what happened after they left the theatre. There were flashes. Lights. And then he was bloody and dead. She only remembered him saying, “Red cloak. Gold mask.” No, she didn’t know what that meant. She didn’t know if he had any enemies. They met on the internet.
“I didn't choose them. What is that goo?” Harry asked warily as she combed his fringe to the side, as she had attempted last night.
“Of course I remember. I’m just... impressed, I suppose. And a couple wards a shade Darker than the norm, eh?” Malfoy quirked his eyebrows. “Mister Potter, I am impressed. You realise these will counteract with the ward you’ve claimed to have set.” He looked merely interested.
He snorts again, harder. And then a familiar hand is pressing, none-too-gently, helping him down the dias after the Minister and his team.
“Said your mother, and then your father, and then your Auntie: Shoulda-woulda Condom.” Malcker pans, glaring at Perfidy all the mean while.
This girl was a Muggle and this crime had clearly been committed by a wizard, or wizards. Harry reckoned he ought to let the Aurors know, but how would he explain?
“Brat,” Harry mutters to himself as he lifts his head from the carpet. “You can’t be a brat at twenty-three,” he tells the still-hanging Nimbus 2000.
Harys, on the other hand, was preparing to have neither, as he pounded on the windows of Malfoy’s London flat.
‘Room. Now.’ He mouthed and nodded to them both. They nodded back. They got up, Arys had spelled everyone’s movements silent but Harry’s and he grabbed her by the crook of the elbow into the darkness.
If Rita Skeeter had asked little Harry Potter, Champion of Hogwarts, whether or not he imagined he’d be returning to the place at the age of twenty-three with his very own publicist, his very own stylist, and as the Minister for Magic’s “sporting old friend”, he might have said “bleeding fuck, no”, had he said “bleeding fuck” at such a young age.
Harry sits up ramrod. If that speech was anything close to “loved”, it’d only been because of Perfidy’s terrific fumble. Or the speechwriter’s. Hard to tell in these circumstances. Harry usually can’t be bothered. But now with Malcker --
“OH FUCK!” Ron cries. “HARRY IT JUST HAPPENED WE DIDN’T TELL ANYONE YET WE -- Hermione's going to be so disappointed with me and BLOOD MALFOY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?!"
“Yes, of course. You weren’t lying, though, you’ve invented wards. Two, I’m certain of. And others, unsuccessful?” Malfoy looked over at Harry, entirely serious.
What Arys neglected to tell him was that the President’s daughters were not only Harry’s age, but very single and very exciteable. They were “humongous supporters”, they said, and spent the entire tea vying for his affections.
That ever so special smile you typically reserve for people you actually enjoy? Use it. Abuse it. I don’t care. It’s crucial we make a good impression on the President. He’s currently in talks with the Minister over some nasty Auror and Chocolate Frog business. We need you to charm them up...” Arys went on, but Harry stopped listening somewhere after Chocolate Frog. He was really hungry.
Harry moves his jaw and winces a little, but manages to stand without falling over. “Yeah, just bruised. Maybe a tad concussed.
“Thank you for the memories,” Draco says. “It’s – I see why you didn’t want to let it go, the access to my thoughts. It’s kind of addicting, knowing what you thought, how you felt.”
“Grab it,” Malfoy says, stepping back from Harry and grabbing hold of the rope running down his back to push him down towards the bar.
"Colour?" Malfoy asked, running a hand up the middle of Harry's spine and sending shivers through his body.
Harry sat by the table in the cabin and stared at the screen of his Po-cuter until he knew he would throw the thing into the wall if he stared at it for another second without a reply. The message Draco was sending was clear. He wanted nothing to do with Harry.
“That’s sub drop,” Draco explains. “When you feel like shit after. That’s what happens when you have no boundaries, no safe-words and no aftercare. Fuck, I could kill every single Dom you’ve ever met because they didn’t teach you this.”
Harry finished lighting the fire and sat back down by the table, only to stare at the rough grain of it. Could he do that though? Stop being
“Or he won’t,” Draco says, having apparently been standing in the doorway for a while. “Not everyone wants love like that, not everyone enjoys it. That’s alright too.”
He walks over to Matt and casts Obliviate on him, standing with his eyes closed for several minutes while Harry makes sure neither Matt nor Crabbe is waking up anytime soon.
“Martin Walker,” Harry reads aloud, speaking loudly enough to break Draco out of his rant. “42 years old, Squib. He’s been brought in a couple of times by Muggle police for possession of narcotics. Has a Muggle flat, Muggle job and apparently uses Muggle drugs too.”
loved him. Everything about Draco was burning at a high intensity, all the time – and Harry loved the feeling. Draco it seemed, was the same when it came to Harry.
He appeared straight into the middle of Ron and Hermione’s kitchen, realising just as he did so that he probably should have Apparated to their garden and knocked like a sane person.
Harry took a deep breath to settle himself and fished out the red book. Sure, it was a way for Draco to know Harry was J, but it was also a way to keep calm, so he wasn’t clawing out of his skin in ten minutes, when Draco was set to arrive.
“Tell me more,” Draco said. He lowered his head to run his teeth gently over Harry’s collarbone, and Harry was grateful. Draco had started doing that, averting his gaze and giving Harry attention in other ways when he noticed Harry’s embarrassment. It made it easier for him to talk. He let the feeling of Draco’s lips on his throat ground him.
Draco steps back behind the barrier so fast Harry can’t stop him. He has his eyes closed, and Harry swears he feels Draco’s pain as well as his own.
“Please hurry,” Harry says, not caring if he sounds desperate. He feels desperate, like he might explode if Draco doesn’t fuck him
“I love you,” Harry says. The words escape him entirely without his permission, but now that they’re out they feel so good he refuses to take them back.
It’s not like they’re kids with nothing better to do than antagonize each other anymore. Harry knows that. Knows that the last time they spoke it was all very civil with Malfoy thanking Harry for speaking at his mother’s trial and Harry accepting his handshake like some very profound contrast to how he’d refused it almost a decade earlier. Except it hadn’t been profound, because Malfoy had fucked off to France to study potions and had
him. At least now he saw himself. And with that came a strange new power to make choices that felt right to him. He hadn’t had a choice in the constant public attention he received, or the war that got him the attention in the first place but he’d made the choice to leave it behind. He’d made the choice to read, and garden, and to get to know himself better.
The lights in the office are too bright, and Harry’s already pounding headache screams in protest. In Harry’s opinion the office is always too bright, and it’s all Draco’s bloody fault anyway. If he’d just stop refusing to use his reading glasses their office wouldn’t need to be lit with what had to be at least three Lumos Maximas.
Ginny takes his hand and pulls him to a nearby bench. Harry sits, only then realising how badly his hands are shaking. Ginny’s wrong. Harry would have figured out by now if he was gay, wouldn’t he? A nagging voice at the back of his mind reminds him that there is definitely
The office is empty too, and it allows Harry in without a password. The Pensieve is nowhere to be seen, and Harry wonders if summoning it would be a terrible idea.
He’s not sure how to give the memories to Draco, or how to convince him to watch them. All he knows is he wants to even the playing field, and let Draco know how sorry he is.
In the library Harry spots Ron and Hermione and gives them a wave before turning to Malfoy. “Will you find us a table? I’ll just go tell Ron and Hermione I’m sitting with you.”
Harry shrugged. “I felt less and less able to be on my own, so I made her set up more and more for me to do. Looking back, I think I was just feeding the issue, but at the time it felt like a relief to have something to do. But yeah, it wasn’t her idea. Millie has been great, really.”
Harry was falling for Draco Malfoy. No, he’d already fallen for Draco Malfoy. And he wasn’t supposed to know it was him.
“Come in,” she said, stepping aside and letting Harry walk past her into the house. “Rose is asleep so keep your voice down outside the kitchen and living room, those are the only rooms with silencing charms on them.”
“Remember when we were talking about things we’re really attracted to?” Harry asked, his blush returning in full. “And how I said I have this weird thing for men in fancy shirts rolling up their sleeves?”
“If you really are, I’m guessing you won’t mind this,” Malfoy says. He places his hands on either side of Harry’s head and leans forward, lips brushing softly against Harry’s. It’s so chaste it hurts, like the smell of something delicious that leaves you desperate to taste it. It’s a question, Harry realises. Does he really want this? And yes, fuck yes, he does.
“I think I only get cravings when it’s for food,” Harry says. “I mean, I get horny and I can enjoy sex in the right circumstance, but I always kinda thought people were just playing this social game when they talked about people being ‘hot’ or ‘sexy’. I didn’t know it was an actual thing outside of books.”
Harry forces himself to take three deep breaths before trying the spell again. It works this time, pouring lube into Malfoy’s hand and onto the sheets.
“I’m going to fuck you now,” Draco says. “And you’re not going to come unless I’ve got my hand around your cock, do you understand?”
He only just manages to slow his breathing before Malfoy exits his room, looking put together and powerful. Only when Harry starts following him down to the Dining Hall at a distance does he realise that he just had a very erotic dream about him. A dream that made him start wanking in the middle of the hallway, sure he had his cloak on, but it still feels all kinds of wrong to Harry.
“No that’s terrible we’re not toasting to matemony you loon,” Draco says holding his glass away from Harry with a thoughtful look.
“Some things are easier than others to say out loud,” Draco says. “I’ll work on it though. I want – I want this to work.”
“Ah – yes the all-inclusive,” Pansy says. “Unlike this bed, which is far too tiny and only rooms two people. I vote we get into Ginny’s unnaturally large bed or go to the sofa and open another bottle of wine.”
. He could never be anything but gorgeous, and he’s in Harry’s bed smiling and running his hands up Harry’s naked thighs. Harry’s arse is still warm against the sheets and he moans softly when Draco’s hands reach it.
He whispers healing spell after healing spell, half listening to the sound of Draco pacing outside the door. He’s probably wondering if he should break it down or give them both some space to cool off. Eventually the footsteps retreat down the stairs and Harry breathes a sigh of relief as he finishes healing everything that won’t be covered by jeans and a t-shirt. He casts a couple of spells on his knees too, figuring Draco won’t react well to him wincing as he walks.
Harry had been to three parties since then, but he'd never done anything with Malfoy. Not for lack of wanting to. He'd admitted that much to himself the second party when he watched Malfoy blindfold a man and make him wild with light touches and hard smacks. The reason he hasn't done anything with Malfoy was simply because Malfoy kept his distance. Harry could feel his eyes on him when he wasn't looking, but the blond always turned away before Harry could catch him at it.
“You’re coming out of your self-imposed exile then?” Ginny grinned. “What will you do? I mean, will you get a job? Will you go back to doing events all the time?”
Millie smiled. “Yeah, I kind of figured when you ran off in the middle of an event and left me wondering if you’d been kidnapped by a crazed fan.”
acting like a crazy stalker. He summons his pillow too and tries not to stomp like a petulant teenager as he makes his way to the end of the hallway. He’s pretty sure he fails.
Harry stands so fast his chair falls to the floor, but he can’t bring himself to care. He stands face to face with Draco, and he licks his lips in anticipation, wondering if Draco will kiss him. Draco licks his lips too, but reaches out and pulls Harry’s t-shirt over his head. And of course he won’t kiss Harry. This is just a ‘partners-with-benefits’ thing, and kissing probably isn’t in the description.
“This isn’t just –,” Malfoy begins before he cuts himself off, fist clenching and unclenching at his sides.
“If you have a previous engagement I’m perfectly fine to work by myself,” Malfoy says. He looks so sincere Harry might have believed him if it wasn’t for the disappointed sigh in his ears. Malfoy really does want to sit with him.
“Draco,” Harry says again and he can’t keep his voice from shaking. “Please go downstairs, I’ll get some clothes and meet you there. I’m fine, really.”
Harry tries to look supportive, because if his suspicions are right then Ginny is coming out to him. The expression on his face feels more like confusion though. Ginny has been dating boys for as long as he’s known her. She’d dated him! Wasn’t it a little late to be figuring this all out? If she hadn’t realised before now then… but no.
Harry interrupts Ron before he can finish. “You’re the one who bloody told me I have a crush on him! Why is it so strange that I want to be around him? Fuck, what the hell is wrong with you?”
Harry glanced up at him again. His blue shirt was long sleeved, and his trousers looked to be made of a wool-blend. Harry was in a t-shirt and shorts.
“Fuck,” Draco breathes and in that single word Harry can finally see just how aroused Draco is too. Harry isn’t the only one deeply affected by this and the knowledge warms him from the inside out.
“I always worry,” Draco says, words breathless. “That you’ll tire of this. That next time you won’t be so -  Ah, fuck.”
Harry searches for a reasonable explanation as to why he’d be out and about that early, and doesn’t find one.
“Oh,” Harry says, taken aback. It makes sense when he thinks about it. He’s seen Charlie grimace whenever Molly brought up finding a nice wife, and he hadn’t looked any happier when she’d suggested maybe he get a husband if a wife wasn’t his thing. “Yeah, I don’t mind – just don’t tell anyone else? And tell Charlie not to either?”
“It’s true then. The Disaster Bi is real. Ginny, you’re an outlier and shouldn’t have been counted. You’re setting unrealistic standards for the rest of the bisexual community.”
Malfoy walks out of his room at 6.30 am, just like he’s done every day for the past two weeks. Harry knows his routine well enough by now that at five minutes to, he’s standing in the hallway, leaning casually against a wall with his cloak safely hidden in his pocket.
“I wish I could be enough for someone,” he says, “I’m not saying I need to be the only person in their life, or that they can’t have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. I just need to not be dumped as a person because they traded up.”
He’s a terrible person. Terrible for lying to Daniel, terrible for leaving out vital information, terrible for being unable to feel the things he really
Draco sets a fast pace, pulling out and pushing in hard and fast. It’s exactly what Harry needs. What they both need. Harry holds on tight to Draco, lips parted as he draws shuddering breaths. His cock is trapped between their bodies, leaking precome onto Harry’s stomach. He resists the urge to reach down and close his fist around it. He wants to make this last longer; enjoy the desperation in them both for more, closer, deeper.
“How come you know so much about this anyways?” Harry murmurs, the soothing feel of Draco against him chasing away his anxiety.
Draco reached out across the table and intertwined his fingers with Harry’s. “I don’t see why all the moments we shared on the site can’t be dates. We shared meals, we shared conversations. We even shared emotions and personal struggles. It’s hardly a first date if we’re already in love, is it?”
Draco, despite his claims, becomes just as smitten with Ayla as Harry is. After a month she sleeps in Draco’s bed almost as often as she sleeps in Harry’s, even though Draco had insisted that dogs don’t belong on furniture at all. It charms Harry to see them together, and it feels like he’s found a family. Not at all like the one he’d thought he would have, but one that feels right.
“Well fuck,” Harry says, holding the phone up to show Draco the text. “I was really hoping I wouldn’t have to go back there wearing my Glamour.”
Harry releases his lip and lets his mouth make whatever sounds it wants while his body shakes and convulses with his orgasm. Malfoy fucks him through it, sending shivers of pleasure through him even as his orgasm fades. Malfoy’s orgasm takes Harry by surprise because his thrusts are hard and rhythmic until the very end. When he comes he groans, placing both hands on Harry’s hips and squeezing hard.
Harry laughed at that. Millie had always had a special kind of ability to make him look good no matter what he did. “Yeah, that she is.”
“Also,” Ron cut in, “Hermione gets to go to work and be a politician in public. You got to have your whole life made public. It wasn’t a job, so you never got a break from it.”
Harry tugs gently at Draco’s clothes. He’s wearing so many of them, when Harry is just in jeans and t-shirt, and he wants skin. He wants heat and desperation and closeness, and he’s tugging fruitlessly at Draco’s clothing when he realises that Draco is waiting for him to
“Shove off, it’s not a saviour complex thing,” Harry says. “I’ve always wanted a dog, I just filed it in under something I’d do when I was settled down. But I’m not getting more settled down than I am right now.”
Feeling exhausted by the day he’s had and ready for a hot shower and an early night Harry curses loudly enough to startle the woman walking past him. Biting his lip to keep from cursing some more Harry waits for her to enter her room and then summons his invisibility cloak. If he has to sit outside in the hallway all night like some crazy stalker at least he’s not going to be
Harry swallows the lump in his throat before speaking. “Frodo is lucky to have him. I never would have made it without Hermione and Ron.”
“We didn’t actually have sex,” Harry admits. “I just – I was enjoying myself, but then I opened my eyes to actually look at him and I didn’t want him any more than anyone else who was at that bar.”
They’re walking together from Hogsmeade towards the castle, and it feels strangely like it had back in school; the three of them together again with bags full of parchment and quills. It’s different, of course, and not just because they're older and able to float their luggage easily behind them.
, Harry wonders wildly. Daniel is attractive, he’s the sort of bloke Ron would feel a bit jealous of when he walked by him, because Hermione would stare a little too long. He should return the compliment, right? But it feels awkward, he can’t just throw out a
Harry lets Draco’s words wash over him and soothe parts of him he hadn’t even noticed was aching. Draco doesn’t hate him for needing this. The last part of Draco’s speech sinks in and he frowns.
Harry lets Draco’s words paint irresistible images in his mind, and he knows without a doubt that he’ll wake up feeling desperate the next time he sleeps. That Draco’s dreams will become his own, now that he knows about them.
“Thanks,” Harry says, smiling at his oldest friends. “And uh, we’ll see about the brain-picking Hermione – I’m not sure I have any answers for you other than that having a word for it made my life a whole lot better in a short amount of time.”
“In twenty years I’ll be in my seventh year as Minister for Magic, have two kids and a house with a giant bathtub.”
“I’m just happy the kids will leave halfway through June,” Ron says, “I don’t fancy coming back from the pub and running into a twelve-year old missing their mum or something.”
Harry wobbled a little on the floor when Draco roughly pulled his ankles together and pushed Harry's jeans up so the soft velvet was touching his skin even as he started bonding them together. Harry breathed a sigh of relief as he felt himself start to sink into the ropes. The constant itch he felt that was always whispering that he should
you went to the Room of Requirement for that book,” she says. “Have you completely forgotten what happened the last time you had it?” She shoots a pointed glance at Malfoy who’s sat down at another table.
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says, and it’s the wrong thing. It’s not what he means to say, because while that might have been true at first, he
He felt a little less heavy, with the showers. He had a reason to get out of bed that wasn’t ‘I need to’ or ‘I should’, but ‘I want to’. When he ran out of food again a few days later he considered ordering more fast meals, like soups, that only needed to be reheated. It was what he usually ate, when he wasn’t at some sort of fancy dinner. But it wasn’t what he wanted to eat. He wanted to eat spaghetti Bolognese and roast chicken and shepherd's pie. Normal foods. He decided to go with the flow of ‘I want’ and wrote down a long list of various ingredients.
Draco shrugs and looks back to Harry. “Personally, I don’t really care if there is some sort of feeling others feel that I just can’t, or if it’s just that I have a different preference for relationships than they do – it doesn’t really matter. As long as I know what I want I’m comfortable.”
Merlin the voice in his ear really isn’t helping un-push the button, not when it’s saying things like that in an almost sensual whisper. Is he hearing Malfoy’s thoughts? He can’t be, right? Malfoy doesn’t think Harry looks attractive kneeling on the floor and gaping up at him. Except the fact that Harry’s eyes are still on his crotch might be sending an impression of something and fuck Harry needs to do something that isn’t stare at the fly of Malfoy’s trousers.
“Talk to Hermione and Millie. They’ve contacts in the Ministry that can approve your potions for sale, and then you can open your own apothecary. The HP foundation would support you, you know? The potions you’re working on are exactly the kind of thing we made it all about – creating support and resources for the people who fall outside society for some reason.”
The Prophet article always hurt to look at, but it was an important reminder too. It helped him remember not to let anyone get too close. It reminded him not to get his hopes up.
“But then they got together, and they stopped being my person and were just each other's person. And we’re still friends, you know? I see them every other week or so, when they have a spare moment between work and parenting and being a couple, but they can’t be my person anymore because they’re too busy being each other's person. And fuck, losing them hurt like hell. Because even if I didn’t really lose them I did – in a way. They left me behind when they started their life together, and I keep falling further and further behind. It feels like heartbreak in slow motion.” Harry breaks off to take a deep drink from his glass.
“I’m happy,” he says, wondering if somewhere, beyond the train Harry never boarded when he died, his parents can hear him. “I don’t have what you two did. The whole romantic thing, I mean. It’s not really for me. I’ve spent my life looking for someone. Someone to fill that gaping hole I’ve always felt, to bridge the gap between me and the rest of the world.”
The spell Harry stupidly cast on himself was probably Latin too. Maybe Harry can get Malfoy to explain it to Harry without Harry telling him what he’s done?
Pleasure ebbs and flows in him, building steadily with every moan in the room, every thrust of Malfoy’s hips. The ropes around his torso only intensify everything, makes his skin flame with sensitivity and pleasure every time Malfoy pulls on them. Harry doesn’t know if he’s moaning or cursing, but his mouth still hangs open, gasping for breath and making sounds he’s too far gone to identify.
Hermione seems to hesitate, but Harry fixes her with a determined stare. “It’s not what you think. Just get Draco back here.”
Standing on a stage surrounded by people who thought they knew him with a light so bright he couldn’t see anything but darkness with no idea why he was there felt like symbolism for his life. He was so lonely. He made a vague speech about being kind and generous to each other, and how caring for everyone was especially important in the wake of the war. Words he’d spoken so many times they didn’t sound real anymore. He didn’t want to be there; he wasn’t sure he wanted to be anywhere.
“Oh, fun,” Harry says, voice as sarcastic as he can possibly make it. “I get to start my week with Potions.”
“I played the ‘chosen one’ card,” he admits. “People will let me do pretty much anything when I play that card.”
He’d like someone to go with him to the dentist when he needs a wisdom-tooth removed because he’s not entirely sure he should be walking home alone all drugged up, but he doesn’t think it’s appropriate to ask anyone. Everyone already has a person, and he doesn’t want to ask for something they don’t need returned. A year ago Ginny would have offered, but she doesn’t now, so Harry goes alone and he stumbles home and it’s fine.
“I just know, I guess,” Harry sighs, “but it should feel different with Daniel, right? You love Pansy differently than me, don’t you?”
When the credits roll Harry feels so sated from the food and tired from the travel that he would have fallen asleep on the sofa if it wasn’t for Ayla licking at his knee and walking to the balcony door in an obvious request to be let outside. The fresh air gives him a second wind and he stands there looking up at the stars while Ayla chases a ball around.
“Fuck, I hate this,” Harry groans, burying his head in Ginny’s pillow again. He moves a little when Ginny scoots in closer and he hears the bed creak when Pansy and Draco both climb in.
“And I wanted to get some sleep, I thought we agreed.” Harry lets himself slump into his sofa, trying to really let his exhaustion show.
Harry had worried ever since he and M started to really get along that the spark wouldn’t be there when they met. Sure, he’d been attracted to the personality behind the words, but he’d worried that it wouldn’t translate. That he’d meet the man and see a stranger to whom he felt no attraction, sexual or romantic. He hadn’t needed to worry.
Draco smiles a little and then seems to shake himself. “Well there is no reason for us to be both miserable
“That’s easy for you to say, eloquent sod that you are.” The banter makes it easier for Harry to pour the water into cups and turn around to face Draco.
“I’m trying to decide between fucking you right here and taking you to bed,” Draco says. His other hand joins the first on Harry’s arse, and Harry shivers at the feeling of a lubed finger running between his cheeks.
Matt grins, and something about the glint in his eyes sends a thrill through Harry. “Do your shot,” he demands.
“We all had bets running during school. Does Granger know? No, it can’t be. Is it the three of you? Blaise did nurse his suspicions, but I never!” Malfoy said.
“Merlin, all right!” He shoved off the pecking ‘Daily Lucifer’ from Arys and opened the sealed parchment.
“Did a little more than toying, but yeah. Fine. Take it.” Harry closed his eyes as Malfoy grabbed the wand.
The Heidel House was grand and high-ceilinged. That was about all Harry could see of it from behind Arys’ taller frame. It was also packed full of people in the foyer.
“Arys, I’m there with you. I know. I care for you the same. Well, not the same probably, but, you know. I do care.” Harry glared at her daggers, but was sincere in his words. She knew, and smiled melancholic.
Draco is sitting on his sofa when Harry makes it down the stairs, casting spells at the two near-empty glasses from the night before.
“Aromantic just means not romantic, doesn’t it?” Pansy asks. She walks around the bed and sits down next to where Ginny’s lying. “So it doesn’t mean you don’t love, just that you don’t do romance?”
“This was a bad idea,” Draco said and started rolling his sleeve down, simultaneously backing away from Harry.
"Colour," Draco said when he'd finished tying his knot. He stood and walked to stand in front of Harry, running a hand through Harry's hair as he did.
Harry gave Ginny a soft smile. A month ago, he was thinking the same thing, that he couldn’t leave the cabin without a clear plan. But over time his thoughts had shifted. Leaving the cabin was a plan, and his inheritance gave him the luxury of not having to make further plans just yet.
“Well, I mean, I got hard last night doing my, er, homework. And then again this morning. But I didn’t want to, you know… I wanted to wait for you.”
“Try and see if Granger can figure out a way to get that thing off you,” Draco says, nodding at the band around Harry’s wrist. “I’d rather not consider the alternative.”
Ron rolled his eyes at his brother and sat down to hear an answer he’d obviously discussed at length before.
he was coming, just that he was. The anticipation makes Harry’s skin tingle. He’s not even sure they’ll get to the sex today. Maybe Draco will insist on just talking and talking and talking. Maybe he’ll listen to what Harry likes and not be interested in any of it. Maybe he’ll — arrive while Harry’s pacing and freaking out, apparently.
The unspoken praise makes Harry blush, and he moves his hand slowly over Malfoy’s cock. Malfoy, it seems, is picking up everything Harry enjoys with lightning speed. His fist tightens, he starts adding a little twist to his wrist when he reaches the head of Harry’s cock. He licks at Harry’s neck and bites gently at his earlobe and Harry’s lost to it. To the feel of Malfoy against him, the heat of his cock in his hand, the pleasure building and building in his gut as Malfoy pulls him closer to the edge.
release, and Harry has no idea what he’s going to do about it. He follows Malfoy up the stairs and sees him heading towards the library when he panics.
Harry lets himself be pushed forward, spreading his legs a little and wrapping his fingers against the cool metal. The bar is floating in thin air, but it doesn’t budge when he leans his weight against it.
He’d imagined them kissing many times, and it had always been fast and angry, all teeth and fighting for dominance. It’s nothing like he’d imagined it would be. Draco kisses him softly, their lips slotting perfectly together and making Harry’s skin tingle all over. Draco hums into the kiss, running his hands up and down Harry’s back, reaching up to rest his hands in Harry’s hair. Harry moans softly, trying to pull Draco impossible closer. When Draco finally pulls back they’re both breathless.
,” Malfoy says, voice low. He’s smirking and cocky, but Harry doesn’t miss the way he forces his hands open. He’s nervous too.
Harry, to his surprise, isn’t actually lonely. Draco comes over for dinner sometimes, and always for movie-nights. Harry’s better at inviting other friends for game nights and movie nights and weekday dinners and he enjoys hearing about Luna’s paintings and Neville’s plants and how Dean misses Seamus when he’s off traveling for work.
Four days after he and Draco stopped speaking Harry bought a house, and immediately started packing. It felt good to be moving forward. The cabin held so many memories already, but it wasn’t a good place for him to get stuck. He couldn’t stay there just because something bad had happened to him. He was going to move forward. Forward to the farmhouse with a patch of land attached.
They text Crabbe, or Crucio as he prefers to call himself, at noon the next day. Harry expects they’ll have to wait hours, if not days for a reply, but one comes in half an hour later.
Draco takes a step back, and then another. He opens his eyes to look at Harry for just a second before he turns around and walks out of the room. Harry braces for his wrist to try and pull him after, but it doesn’t. Draco must have stopped outside the door. Harry pictures him walking out only to collapse against the wall.
Draco looks at him as if he knows Harry isn’t done speaking and Harry takes a deep breath and forces himself to finish.
“I know,” Harry says. “I just felt so stupid for casting it on myself. Don’t worry it pales to how I feel now. Can I have my wand?”
Harry shivered when a hand made its way into his hair. His scalp tingled and he leaned into the touch, letting Draco soothe his nerves. “Then tell me what you enjoy as we go.”
“Give me a hand?” Draco asks, thrusting his hips again. His cock pushes against Harry’s rim for a second before slipping, causing them both to groan with the want for more.
Except he’s not entirely sure what it is he wants, so he doesn’t finish the sentence and he thrusts his hips instead so his erection presses against something hard and warm, and he feels Daniel’s hardness push back against him. And that is what he wants; friction and heat.
“I think it would be cruel to have all of this talk about sex right here at the kitchen table, without showing it any action, don’t you agree?”
Harry clenches his fists and refuses to cry. He doesn’t get to be hurt, he's the dick that's been stringing Daniel along. The one who closes his eyes to enjoy sex and who lies and says he's working so he doesn't have to hang out all the time. The one who's known he'll never want to fit the space Daniel has made for a partner in his life, ever since the first fucking date.
He reads about the differences between sexual attraction, libido and sexual desire and feels the final piece of the puzzle fall into place.
When his hot chocolate arrived, he had five more minutes before Draco was supposed to be there. When he had finished the cup, Draco was five minutes late. It didn’t matter, he’d show. It would be fine, Harry had to believe that.
He drew some more courage from his breakfast and the bluebells before penning an invitation for dinner. When the letter was done he tossed some Floo powder into his fireplace and sent the letter through. All that was left to do now was figure out what he wanted to cook.
“I know you know what this is,” Harry says, directing his words to Draco. “You know it doesn’t affect my mind. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
“Yes,” Hermione said. “I mean, had this been ten years ago I would have been seriously concerned, but Draco isn’t who he was back then. He grew up. Remember that charity you supported this summer, the one about making Wolfsbane Potion available for anyone who needs it?”
Draco falls asleep after they orgasm, hand still holding Harry’s. Harry stays awake, listening to Draco’s breathing, relishing in the other man's warmth against his skin. He won’t waste a second of this to sleep, not when he’ll never have it again. He feigns sleep when Draco’s wand vibrates and chimes to wake him up. He wonders if Draco will wake him to kiss him goodbye, or say he loves him a final time. Draco is quiet though, slipping out from under the covers and tip-toeing around the room to gather his clothes. Harry waits, hoping that Draco will do something,
They spend the entire day together, planning and Harry doesn’t feel an emotional hangover at all. If that’s what he felt, he’d have to tell Draco, but it isn’t. He feels a gentle stiffness in his muscles, and a soreness in his backside that constantly reminds him of how they started the day. He feels a desperate yearning for the man sitting right in front of him. Harry wants to reach out and hold his hand while they work, he wants to ask Draco home for dinner. And it’s not an emotional hangover because it’s not a reaction to something they’ve
He’s gotten better at kissing. It doesn’t feel so strange now that it’s not the mouth of a literal stranger invading his own. At least with Daniel, he knows what to expect. He doesn’t like it, but he doesn’t really mind either.
“Let’s go,” Matt says. He grabs Harry’s hand and pulls him through the club, and Harry grins at the thrill of letting him. Of starting to let go.
"I told you impatience and bondage might be a challenging combination," Draco smirked. "But I suppose I wouldn't mind continuing this with some nudity involved."
“Perfect,” Draco says. His face is buried in Harry’s neck and Harry feels his lips brush over his skin when he talks.
"So you're mine for half a year then?" Harry asks. He knows there is no use asking for more. Draco would never risk cheating on his wife, and Harry could never live with the guilt. With the shame of being reduced to an affair after being Draco's for seven years.
Harry looks away from Ginny and stares up at the lines in his ceiling. He should have figured it out when he couldn’t make it work with Ginny, really. If he couldn’t be in a traditional romantic relationship with the person he loved most in this world he probably wasn’t going to be able to do it with anyone.
It’s a nice routine, and Harry lives comfortably for months before that impossible itch shows up again. That itch he just can’t scratch satisfyingly on his own, but that he can’t find anyone he wants to itch it with either. It’s just him and Draco for movie-night and Harry can’t make himself sit still long enough to focus on the movie so he runs back and forth between the living room and the kitchen instead. Grabbing snack after snack and taking a bite before putting it down and going to try something else.
“The Room of Requirement!” Harry exclaims suddenly, inspiration striking. “Do you think everything burned down?”
Draco opened his face again and grinned at Harry. “Like that? Roleplaying a different version of ourselves?”
had been less enjoyable, but Harry appreciated the concerned tone. Malfoy is never mocking in his thoughts, never rude or derisive. He’s just – kind, and complimentary and observant.
Harry silently curses the damn rule he'd insisted on in their first year as partners when Draco kept running off alone to investigate. Harry had done it too, of course, but Draco had been the first to get seriously hurt. The 'no work without backup' rule had saved them both many times, but if Harry can get a lead on Crabbe without letting Draco in on his habits, the risk will be worth it.
“Classes are about to end,” Malfoy says. His lips close around Harry’s neck and suck and Harry forgets entirely about the words. The words don’t matter, or classes, or other people. The only thing that matters is that Malfoy doesn’t stop doing the thing he’s doing.
The dream he’s woken from was so hot and real Harry still feels the brush of fingers against his thigh, the damp lips against his neck. He’s pretty sure it was the intensity of the dream that had woken him, and he wants nothing more than to close his eyes and go back to it. Or, at least, help himself to the conclusion the dream had clearly been heading towards. Harry checks that he’s still safely hidden by his invisibility cloak, closes his eyes and allows himself to remember.
The silence that follows feels heavy, and Harry can’t help but feel like he should fill it. He doesn’t have anything to say though, nothing that would make sense of the scrambled mess in his head.
Malfoy doesn’t need Harry to answer twice. The second Harry shows that he wants it, he leans in and kisses Harry like he’s been starving for it. It’s all teeth and desperate clinging and Harry’s grateful he’s sandwiched between Malfoy and the wall because he’s pretty sure his legs stopped working somewhere around the time Malfoy took his bottom lip between his teeth and bit gently.
Draco adds a third finger, and Harry gives up all hope of controlling his hips as they move of their own accord. Searching for and finding pleasure on Draco’s fingers.
Harry waits for her to leave the room before grumbling about how being a freelance journalist isn’t really a full-time job even though he knows it is, that Pansy and Draco do double the work when they’re chasing a story and that they really earn the time off in between jobs. He and Ginny had opened the Hogsmeade branch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes after Harry had hated being an Auror and Ginny had felt like she’d experienced everything she wanted from professional flying. It had been a lot of work for a few years, but these days the shop mostly runs itself. They’re still there for a few hours Monday through Thursday, but on Fridays, they stay home to do orders and roll out paychecks and other boring stuff. They’ve secretly hired an accountant that does it all for them at this point, but that’s a well-kept secret.
“Not completely, of course. I just stopped speaking over people, started to listen more. I try to only speak when I feel like I have something important to say, which I admit isn’t too often.”
Does Harry want that? He definitely wants a relationship, but how can he know if he wants one with Daniel? Maybe the only way to find out is to try. It can’t hurt getting to know him at least.
When they’re halfway through eating Draco sighs. “So, tell me about last night. I’m assuming you went off without me because you didn’t want me to know the nature of your relationship with Matt?”
Draco rolls his eyes and refills Harry’s glass with a quick Aguamenti. “Idiot, next time tell me and I’ll come with you.”
“Sorry,” Harry says, directing it at Hermione. “You know I think you’re right to about the laws that demand qualifications for certain jobs. I just hate that it means I need to do a course to get my NEWTs to qualify for a job I’ve been doing for five years already.”
“And you do your sex-homework. I’ll come by again tomorrow, alright?” Draco smiles, and Harry gets the sneaking suspicion that he likes to embarrass Harry a little.
Harry pauses, like he would if he was speaking to someone who could actually answer. No answer comes, of course, but the silence is comforting rather than painful. “Anyways, I realised I was looking in all the wrong places, because the only person who can make sense of me and what I want from life is me. And I feel like I finally found what I was looking for because I know who I am now, and I feel at home in myself.”
“So before you watch this,” Harry says, “how does this ‘partner-with-benefits’ thing work with just, regular sex?”
After finishing his breakfast Harry put on some proper clothes for the first time since arriving at the cabin and went outside. It was even more beautiful seeing it without the window as a barrier. Along the cabin wall someone had stacked firewood, and Harry was grateful because he’d probably need that when the weather started getting colder. Next to the firewood was half a felled tree, ready to be chopped into more firewood by the rusted axe lying beside it.
"Fine, but then we need to wait until tomorrow. I'll need some time to update you on my backstory, and find a Glamour and story for you." Harry finishes with a yawn and lets the past week of sleepless nights wash over him. The second yawn comes without being forced.
Draco groans and speeds up again, fucking Harry in irregular thrusts; too far gone to keep any sort of rhythm. Harry keeps his eyes open, looking at Draco’s face as he closes his eyes and lets his climax take him over. It’s a gorgeous thing to see, the way his whole face opens up – everything he’s feeling clearly written in the way his mouth opens, the way his eyes flutter closed, the way his breath hitches.
"You'd look gorgeous sucking me off, bound like this," Draco said, running his fingers down Harry's cheek and over his lips. Harry's hips buckled, the motion pulling on the ropes and sending shivers of pleasure through him.
“Harry? Ayla?” Draco yells. Ayla immediately runs to see what’s going on, and Harry rolls his eyes before getting off the floor and following her.
Malfoy doesn’t speak his thoughts out loud, instead closing his hands over Harry’s for a second before letting them go and helping with the buttons.
Harry laughs, because laughter is always a good cure for anxiety. And he always makes fun of Ron when the chance presents itself, that’s one of the cornerstones of their friendship at this point.
Ron and Hermione arrive shortly after and like he’s been doing for the past week Harry waits for them to enter the Dining Hall, removes his cloak and follows them inside. Thankfully Malfoy likes a long breakfast. Harry glances over at him, and just like expected, finds him reading the newspaper and eating his grapefruit.
“Mate, he already told you he had a crush on you as a kid. I hardly think finding out you’re you will put him off,” Ron said.
“I like being held down or tied up,” Harry admits, keeping his eyes on Draco’s forearm and imagining the way it could hold him down. “I don’t like something covering my eyes. I think, maybe with you though. Uhm, I like giving up control, having someone else decide. I like being fucked.” Harry blushes harder. “I like it when it’s a little rough, when it stretches so much it hurts a little — so I guess I don’t like too much prep? Fuck this is embarrassing to talk about.”
The feel of Draco’s thick cock pressing against his rim made Harry want to cry and laugh at the same time. He was about to be fucked. In the arse. By Draco Malfoy. Draco paused for a few seconds, rubbing his slick cock over Harry’s rim and giving Harry a chance to change his mind. To use his safeword and call it all off. Harry didn’t want to stop though, he wanted to keep doing this forever.
“Pansy is my person,” Draco says. “I’m not sure how I’ll survive losing her like that, bit by bit until it’s just monthly lunches. Did you ever get over it? Losing them like that?”
Harry wanted both. He wanted everything, and he wanted it from Draco. He didn’t speak, didn’t beg to have it one way or the other. He wanted to be told, he wanted Draco to decide what
Matt always delivers feelings and sensations strong enough to make Harry force out everything else. His knees throb, his arse feels full, his shoulders ache with holding himself up from the floor, his body surges with adrenaline when Matt closes his hands around his neck until his vision goes spotty and still holds on for a while longer before letting go. His thighs shake with need to come, and he gasps for air through it all.
“I know what you mean,” Harry says, “I used to look up there searching for something, but I found it right here.”
Pansy, Ginny and Draco are still sitting in the living room where he left them hours ago. It feels strange to see them there like nothing life-altering has happened today at all and Harry is suddenly furious with them. With Draco for being so comfortable being loveless and with Pansy and Ginny for having the one thing Harry wants to want more than anything. He hates them all for making it look so easy, and he hates himself because he doesn’t hate them – he’s just jealous.
After dinner he sat with Ginny, George, Ron, and Hermione under a heating-spell on the porch, enjoying hot drinks Molly had made.
Harry decided to spend a few hours clearing away more weeds, rotten leaves, and weird rocks from the garden. There seemed to be an endless supply of them, but he noticed he was finally making a real dent in it. He wondered if he should contact Neville and get some tips on gardening. It might be nice to grow his own fruits and veggies – and it might be nice to expand on his social circle a little. If he got too comfortable in his own company, he might never leave the cabin.
He feels happy and relaxed most days because he doesn’t have to go out searching for the life he wants. He already has it. He has a brilliant flatmate that will taste his baking, laugh with him, and listen when he needs to talk. He lives with his best friend, and he’s now good enough friends with Pansy and Draco that it’s never awkward for all four of them to hang out – which they do a lot. Even when Draco isn’t there Harry never feels like the third wheel, like he does sometimes with Ron and Hermione. There was never anything missing at all, so no wonder Harry had become so miserable when he was constantly looking for it.
Harry gave a soft moan of appreciation for the praise, and the vibrations of it made Draco groan and move his hips faster. And fuck, Harry moved his fist harder to match. His own cock was dripping precome now, and he was lost. Lost to the sensations and the pleasure and the desperate want for this man. His orgasm struck entirely without warning, a final drop of pleasure making everything spill over and sending heat through his body in shocks of blinding pleasure. His toes curled and his free hand closed around Draco’s knee to ground himself as he moaned helplessly around Draco’s cock, shaking with his release.
“Not at all,” Pansy says, “it’s like a craving. Like how we walked by that Chinese place last night and you just
Ron groans when she leaves the room, presumably to fetch her book. “Of course she did. You know she bought like five books when you came out as bi? Now she’ll buy even more.”
Harry’s eyes immediately go to the leather belt wrapped around Draco’s hips. “Please,” he whispers, cock twitching.
“He had his moments,” Malfoy says. Harry isn’t sure if he means he had his good moments or he had moments of being a tit, but he decides not to push it.
to hear him. He feels selfish, holding on to the bond and holding back from something they both want just so he can hear praise from Draco. He feels selfish and stupid and completely unwilling to let it go.
Crush on Ron? Crush on Malfoy? Surely not. Alright, maybe he did have some more than friendly feelings for a short while over Ron, but he projected all that onto Cho and it had been fine, and it had passed in a few months anyways. Malfoy though, had never been a crush.
Draco stands and grabs his cloak, and Harry’s gotten so good at ignoring how good the cloak makes him look that he only spares it a fleeting thought.
Harry nods slowly. That had indeed been Crabbe. And it had been Matt, the guy Harry had fucked only two weeks prior. Harry inhales shakily through his nose before opening his eyes to look at Draco. He looks excited, a hint of something wild in his eyes and the hurt from before forgotten.
When Matt joins him he pulls Harry out of the bed and pushes him roughly to the floor. Harry’s knees scream in protest at the sudden contact with the hard floor, but the roughness of it sends his thoughts flying and he lets go immediately, surrendering to the sensations of his body rather than the stress of his mind.
and combined with the words Harry keeps hearing in his ear it makes him feel warm all over. He waits for Malfoy to round the corner, throws his invisibility cloak over himself and follows.
Hermione comes back with the book Harry had read about the spell in, all those weeks ago. She has some others with her too, and Harry hopes there is an answer in them. He doesn’t want Draco to have to deal with him any more than he has to. Doesn’t want Draco to feel pressured to sleep with Harry just to break the spell, or feel guilty for the rest of his life that Harry has to follow him wherever he goes. Fuck. He wants the bond off so he can go hide in a hole until his heart doesn’t feel like it’s pumping crushed glass.
Harry pulls off his shoes and looks down at his jeans and shirt, half wondering if he has the fucks in him to change. He doesn’t, he decides and walks the few steps into the flat to fall into the sofa.
“I erased every memory he has of you, well of Henry really. Except the conversation you had on your sofa. And I gave him a false memory of what happened later, like we would have done if Henry was a legitimate undercover identity.
Harry walked the stairs to their bedroom with his pulse pounding excitement in his ears. He undressed with shaking hands, cock already hard from talking things through with Draco, and crawled into bed. In his head he put himself in a mindset where being caught wanking by Draco would be both humiliating and shockingly arousing. Where Draco would see right through Harry’s cocky exterior to the wild attraction he was hiding.
“Yes,” Harry said. He twisted his hands against the ropes, wishing he could reach out and touch Draco to strengthen the weight of his consent; a thrill of arousal ran through him when he couldn’t. He wasn’t the one in control here, and he loved it.
“Please,” he said, twisting on the bed to create friction and wincing at how rough the sheets felt on his sensitive skin. To his horror he realised his eyes were wet, tears the only release he had from the overwhelming longing thrumming in his body. “Fuck, Draco. Malfoy. Please.”
“Aromantic,” Harry says, putting extra emphasis on the n. “As in, I don’t want a boyfriend or girlfriend, ever. I just don’t like romance, not for myself.”
Except it hadn’t been what he wanted because the drop from the euphoria of letting go was officially worse than the strain of holding it all in. Except he’d never wanted Draco to know about this part of him, ever.
“It’s not your fault. There is nothing wrong with you for wanting the things that you want. Nothing at all. You need to be safe about it though, you need to have a Dom that practices safe, sane, and consensual sex and play. Someone who likes to give the things you like to recieve.”
Back in class Harry spills a deadly poison all over his partner, who runs to the infirmary for a neutralising bath just in case Malfoy’s spell didn’t get it all, knocks over an empty chair, and trips over his own feet. He can’t stop staring at Malfoy, imagining the things they’ll do when the bell rings. Will they go to Malfoy’s room? Will they do it right here, on the desk? Like the dream Harry had on Friday? Will Malfoy change his mind?
Harry wonders the same thing. Things with Gin, Ron and Hermione, and hell even Pansy feel effortless. And yet every single step with Daniel feels constricting, like the air he breathes keeps getting thinner, the room he has to move in keeps shrinking. That’s normal though, probably. It has to be, because if it’s not normal then Harry isn’t normal either.
“As you wish,” Draco said. He let his fingers slip between Harry’s arsecheeks and over his sensitive rim. This time, he inserted two fingers right away and set a fast determined pace, hitting Harry’s prostate on every thrust. His other hand reached below Harry, fucking his cock with sticky fingers and giving a little twist at the end that made Harry see stars.
“Shit,” he says, struggling to sit up properly because his wrist won’t move an inch further away from the Dining Hall. He scoots back and is finally able to put both hands on the floor to push himself to his feet.
"He must have been hiding in Muggle London all this time, while we've been busy looking for him in Magical communities all over the world, figuring a Death-Eater would never consort with Muggles. But of course Crabbe would hang around the
They both jump whenever anything scary happens, and Harry’s grateful that Draco seems to find comfort in Harry’s presence rather than his physical touch. Harry doesn’t mind touching or being close, but there is a strange comfort in being able to sit alone with someone.
“You’re being weird again,” Draco observes after closing the door to their office and discarding his cloak. “I don’t suppose you’ll tell me what it is this time either?”
“Fuck, you’re perfect,” Draco breathed, and then seemed to catch himself. “It’ll make things easier for you now, but from now on your arse belongs to me. Understand?”
It’s strange, the little friendship that has evolved between them over the last few months, and Harry sometimes wonders if he should bring Daniel into it - it’s never felt right though. Harry needs this, something that’s
“Fuck, I want you.” Harry’s hands reached out of their own accord to run shaky fingers down the fabric of Draco’s pants. When they brushed over Draco’s cock he hissed and twitched against Harry.
“Yeah, but the pint wasn’t!” Harry insists. “I just figured with the war over we could, I don’t know, know each other as something else than gits.”
Ginny summons two cans of soda from the fridge before sitting down next to him. “Tell me everything! Are you going to see him again?”
Malfoy stares at Harry, eyes wide. “I figured you’d guess Blaise and Pansy, who was in fact a very real crush, but Longbottom and Diggory?”
“A little,” Harry laughs. “We’ve had pizza every day for two weeks. I never thought I’d say it, but I’m a little sick of pizza.”
“Ginny?” he calls, searching the kitchen and living room with no luck. He calls for her again and hears the answer from her bedroom. Thank Merlin, she’s home.
“And it made us miserable,” Ginny agrees, “I didn’t really feel that love you said you had until after we broke up. It was like you were suddenly free to love me in the way you wanted to love me, instead of trying to love me the way you thought you had to.”
“So, Matt, what do you do for a living?” Harry asks, after they’ve both finished most of their drinks.
is about to fuck him, and it’s all too much and not enough all at the same time. He fixes his eyes on the ceiling and breathes hard, gasping as he feels the head Draco’s cock rub over his rim. His hips twitch upward, silently begging Draco to
“Yes,” Harry said, too caught up in looking at Draco to answer more. It didn’t feel fair, to have him so close after all this time, and to be further away than they had been when they didn’t know each other’s names.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He was floating, relishing in the feeling of Draco on him and in him, and the pleasurable tingle still present in his spent body.
“I promise,” Harry says. Then he takes a moment to think, and realises there is something Draco deserves to know. And maybe something Harry deserves to say. “I have these moods sometimes where I feel just, uhm, completely worthless I guess. I think if we do a scene, that’s what it’s called right?”
“It is,” Draco laughs. “I’ve decided isn't really necessary though. I mean, I like it - but I like plenty of things. I don’t have to have all of them all the time.”
“Undress,” Malfoy says, and Harry turns his head, trying to determine where the voice is coming from. The room has a strange echo to it though, and he can’t locate Malfoy.
“Good boy,” Draco said, petting his hair affectionately when Harry had positioned himself. Harry glowed with the praise, wanting nothing more than to hear it again. “Spread your knees as much as you can.”
, I don’t feel the same need to tell him things right away if I can talk to Pansy or another friend. And I mean, I love Harry but not in the way where I picture our future together living in a beautiful cottage and raising kids together.”
dreams out loud,” Harry admits, closing his eyes against the amusement that’s bound to bloom on Malfoy’s face.
“Well he’s always recruiting if you need some quick cash,” Matt says. “But enough with the twenty questions. Go to your bedroom and get undressed.”
Draco fixes him with a serious stare then. “Frodo thinks he’s going to his death though, you had hope, didn’t you?”
“I sort of assumed you’d want to stay as far away from me as possible during your course here, but instead it seems every time I turn around there you are.”
“Yeah, alright,” Harry said, figuring trying the stupid thing would be easier than having the argument.
Harry jumps at the curse, and Matt must think it’s because his hand is now covering his crotch, because he grins and presses a little harder.
Harry hears the words like a whisper in his ear and he jumps, head twisting to the side so fast his neck twinges in protest. Of course, there isn’t anyone there. The voice had clearly been Malfoy’s, and he’s thankfully not standing behind Harry whispering in his ear. He’s standing right in front of Harry saying something at a normal volume.
“Shit,” Harry says. He pulls at his duvet in panic, double-checking that it’s covering his naked body. “Sorry, I forgot I asked you to come here this morning. I’ll —,”
“No.” The word is firm, angry. “Father will disown me if he finds out. I’ll lose my family, I’ll lose everything. I know you can’t -,”
“You still want this?” Malfoy whispers, mouth so close to Harry’s ear he can feel lips moving against it.
“I love you,” Harry says before he can stop himself. He means it, but he’s not sure Draco is ready to hear it. Draco had thought it, but Harry suspects this is one of the things that’ll take him a while to say out loud.
“It’ll be fine, I’ll be there the whole time,” Draco says. “And we’ve got six Aurors on standby, remember?”
Hermione coughs and looks up at the castle. “We’re almost there, I hope the welcoming feast is as good as I remember!”
Malfoy releases his grip on Harry’s cock and holds out his hand for lube. Harry can’t help the disappointed whine, even though he was the one who asked to stop.
“Alright fine I take it back, I’m never sick of pizza.” Harry casts an Aguamenti in Ayla’s bowl to hide his eye roll. “How about Indian though? I could go for some biryani and naan.”
Draco doesn’t usually call him Potter anymore, but apparently he has to revert back to it when he’s particularly disgusted or angry. ‘Harry’ just doesn’t have the same opportunity for harshly pronounced consonants as ‘Potter’ does. At least that’s how Harry imagines Draco would explain it if Harry ever got the guts up to ask him about it. He doesn’t though, because the other option is that Draco uses his last name to distance them somehow. Or that Draco still considers him ‘Potter’ and just forgets to censor himself when he’s angry. Better not to know.
He sounds sincere, like he’s genuinely worried over Harry and feeling his pain, and it warms Harry. He might have lost a boyfriend today, but at least he now knows he has a friend in Draco, even if their friendship is a strange one.
When Malfoy wraps a slick hand around Harry’s cock, he knows he won’t last long. The heat of Malfoy’s hand makes the nerve endings of his prick come alive, and he can’t help the desperate motion his hips make to get more. He wants more of the hand on his cock, more friction against his skin from the ropes, more force in Malfoy’s thrusts. He wants everything, and Malfoy gives it to him – thrusting harder and faster, and wanking Harry’s cock with determined strokes.
“Yes,” he says, hips twitching up as much as they can in the pinned position Draco has him in. He likes it, that Draco is the one in control, that Harry can’t just push down and have Draco in him. He likes that Draco is making him ask for it.
Harry decides to ignore the fact that Dumbledore’s portrait apparently spends his days spying on the students and opens the cabinet to pull out the massive Pensieve there. It’s lighter than it looks, and the basin is empty.
Harry’s hands shake as he removes his final piece of clothing. Draco’s hands are on the buckle of his belt, and the sight makes Harry shiver. He leans over the table and curves his back a little so his arse is pointing up. The anticipation of the sharp pain the belt will bring is almost as good as the pain itself, and Harry never would have known if he’d kept going out with idiots who just did what they liked without communicating along the way.
Harry has managed to hold on to both Draco and the bond for two weeks. Two brilliant, glorious weeks of exploring each other’s bodies, sharing showers, meals, walks and everything in between. Harry hasn’t spent a single night on the floor since they first kissed. He feels so hungry for Draco he can’t ever get enough, and sharing a bed at night just makes sense. For both of them, apparently. Draco hasn’t stopped thinking
“Honestly, I was seconds away from hexing her hair off,” Draco said, after he’d brought one of his improved potions to her. “She actually had the audacity to stand there and say that if we made the medicine for detoxing painless then people wouldn’t have a reason to stop using drugs. Like it’s the pain of going off drugs that keeps people from becoming addicted.”
He feels Draco smile against his collarbone, then gasps when Draco bites him there, sucking hard to leave a mark.
His performance complete, Ron fell back onto the sofa with a laugh. “Honestly mate, you do have a weird obsession with names and how they tie to a period of a person’s life or how they act in certain settings.
“Living here I’m still shocked at how easy it can be,” Harry admitted. “I mean, I get up and have a long shower because it feels good. I make myself a nice breakfast and eat it in the garden while I read. Then I work on the garden, or chop firewood, or clean, or cook. And everything I do is just for me, because I like it. Or at least the effect of it, I don’t think I’ll ever enjoy cleaning, but I like to have it clean.”
Harry breathes deeply and lets the slight friction of the rope ground him to the moment. His erection is achingly hard now, and the ropes are already making him hyper-aware of his own body. How his skin is heated against the cold room, and how Malfoy’s fingers run across it as he ties knot after knot down Harry’s back and chest. When he pauses Harry looks down at himself and sees the rope is tied in a diamond pattern down his chest. Harry’s arms are still free, but he can’t move without feeling the rope pull and tighten around him. He feels powerful, and it feels misplaced until he realises he loves how he looks like this. He loves how he’ll look to everyone watching, how desperate they’ll feel watching him like this. It’s a kind of power he’s never had, and he loves it.
Harry groans and arches up against Draco seeking more heat, more friction. Draco breaks the kiss and moves down Harry’s body, licking and kissing his way past Harry’s nipples down to his belly button. He bites softly at Harry’s hipbone and moves lower, tongue leaving a wet trail that makes Harry feel sensitive as it cools his skin.
“Yes. I’m sorry. I said I was sorry. I should have told you the second I realised who you were, but I just – you didn’t want me to know so I pretended I didn’t.” Harry had to pause for a deep breath to keep his voice from breaking. “It wasn’t right, but it wasn’t right to show up to the café and see who I was and then leave without a word either. So, can we just, I don’t know, call it even and let it go?”
Malfoy collapses on the bed next to Harry, but he keeps his eyes open, running his gaze down the length of Harry’s body and pausing to stare appreciatively at Harry’s love-bitten neck and the come on his stomach.
The bigger inconvenience is the crush. The stupid, impossible crush that flares up and makes Harry blush and stammer at random moments; like when they’re walking and he sees the sun reflecting off Malfoy’s skin, or when the wind plays with his hair when they’re racing around on their brooms, or when Malfoy rolls up his sleeves to reveal strong forearms. The thoughts he hears in his ear don’t help either, and Harry has been grateful many times over that his robes are so effective at hiding an erection. He hasn’t wanked in

Harry feels like absolute shit. Daniel is insecure, and of course he is. He wants to feel desired, sexy, loved. He wants to occupy most of Harry's waking thoughts because that's how he feels about Harry – and Harry can't reciprocate. He's made Daniel feel unwanted and ugly when that's not the truth at all. Harry's the one who's broken.
They were both too far gone to make it slow, or to set any sort of meaningful rhythm. Harry gave up on trying to meet Draco’s thrusts, instead letting Draco guide his body with his hands and taking what he was given. Draco’s cock was bigger than his fingers, and Harry’s arse stretched deliciously around it. Harry gasped and bit into his hand to keep from moaning too loudly, trying to reach his cock with the other.
“I promise,” Harry says, and it’s an easy promise to make. Draco knows his deepest, darkest secrets now and he hasn’t run away screaming. He can trust this man to be fair and kind, and Harry owes him the truth in return.
“Berk! He’s kind, now! Well, kinder. He likes to watch birds. Ask him about that monstrosity your publicist stuck upon me this morning.” Hermione said. Speaking of monstrosities, Harry looked over her head and saw Arys flirting with someone or other in the crowd a ways away.
