"Yes, not stalking at all, when you just 'coincidentally' show up everywhere I am and then follow me around without me asking you to" Draco felt a bit of the old fight spark up in him.
"How do you always know when I'm here?" Draco looked suspiciously at Stupid Harry Potter.
Draco sighed and answered a tired "What?". He couldn't get himself to turn his head and actually look at Stupid Harry Potter. Definitely not because he would start crying, because Malfoys didn't cry in public. Not that being a Malfoy meant anything anymore. If Draco was honest he would rather not be a Malfoy, because look at the good it had done him.
"Potter, whatever do you think you're doing," demanded Draco. He was once again in the library. However, this time Harry sat on the chair next to him instead of across. Okay, maybe there wasn’t really any other solutions because the library was filled to the brim what with Christmas exams coming up and maybe the only table draco could find was a tiny one up against a wall where there barely was room for him, nonetheless this did not deter the stupid prat who lived. He drew up a chair and sat down so close to draco that he could feel Harry’s arm brush against his own when Harry laid out his stuff and started writing.
“Good. You have been stalking me enough that you should know at least that if nothing else,” Draco was pleasantly surprised when Stupid Harry Potter turned bright red and started mumbling about how he didnt stalk him. Draco gave him one of his pointed looks and asked him what he was doing right this moment.
As Draco was picking up his potions assignment from the floor, praising himself lucky that he had spelled all his things impervious, another pair of hands handed him a piece of parchment that had flown a bit away. Draco could recognise those hands everywhere. Those two hands had pulled him out of a roaring fire and those hands had taken his wand. No, there was no doubt. It was Stupid Harry Potter.
“Calm down, Potter, and sit the fuck down,” Draco vaguely gestured at the chair next to his bed with a sore hand. “Potter, now is the time where you tell me what happened and how long I have to stay here.”
we're almost at the end now:) hope you enjoy!
“Potter, Potter, Potter. What could I have done? You know my parole states that I’m not allowed to use any spells that can be seen as aggressive, and a protego can only hold up for so long when it’s three against one.” The time where Draco would have thrown a fit at the smallest scrape was over and all that mattered now was that the other students wouldn’t think that Draco had become an even easier target than before. He had to get out of the hospital wing as quick as possible.
"But why? Where are you books? And why in the world does it look like you ran all the way here?"
“Hey! But I guess we’re friends now right?" Draco’s heart stopped. Were they friends? Had Potter just sneaked in on him without him even noticing? "Malfoy? Are you alright? You have this complexion on your face I haven't seen before. I think people call it a smile, but I have never seen you smile before so who knows," Potter grinned at him and Draco quickly scowled back at him.
“Wha..?” Draco stuttered. “You absolute arse, write your own damn essay.” Draco threw a piece of crumpled paper at Potter.
Draco was so deep in his self pity spiral that he didn't notice the compartment door opening. He stared out the window with a scowl on his face trying to think of all the ways Stupid Harry Potter was a totally the worst person on earth.
“Alright Potter that’s a deal.”
A growing smile on Draco’s face stopped him and he couldn’t help answering with a grin when Draco said: “No no I liked it a great deal can you do it again?”
"Ugh, you're worse than Hermione, can’t you at least take off one afternoon from boring schoolwork?"
“Potter, useless as always.” Draco thought that if he just ignored Potter saying his first name then it definitely didn’t happen.  Or maybe he should say Potter’s first name back. Harry. It sounded kinda nice in his head. No, no, Potter was fine.
"Thank you, Potter," Draco said as he stood up taking the paper from Stupid Harry Potter, who had his suspicious face on. The one that always meant that he was about to ask Draco very personal questions and then afterwards start stalking him. So Draco weighed his options and tried to look as inconspicuous as possible. Like this was just a normal day, and like Draco didn’t do anything but pick his belongings of the floor. which, for the record, happened quite often.
"Yes Potter, I'm sure they don’t mean to leave you by yourself all the time. Maybe you should talk to them? They probably haven't noticed that they do it this often."
Apparently Draco’s father was not the only person with problems about former Deatheaters hanging out with boy-wonders. Three sixth-year Ravenclaws had just rounded the corner onto the hallway Draco was standing in. The Ravenclaws all raised their wands in the confident belief that no one would be able to hear Draco’s screams of pain as they swung spell after spell after spell at him until Draco was laying on the floor with his arms around his head and knees up to his chest. He barely noticed when someone lifted him and he felt like he was flying on a cloud made of warmth.
"Somewhere not here," just because Draco owed Stupid Harry Potter everything didn't mean he would have to like it. Draco added on in a mumble. "probably a lot better than here"
"So, what's your point. Do you really expect me to go around spewing all that bullshit out. You must know I'm not that stupid"
Draco turned his face towards Harry and with an incredulous look he said: “Why did you do that?”
Today however was different. Draco had actually been sitting in peace and quiet for a whole hour and it had really helped him on making a good dent into his runes assignment. When suddenly a very out of breath Saviour threw himself down on the chair across. No books followed and this warranted a look up from Draco. The sight was something to say the least and he wasn’t the only one who was staring at a very windswept and heavily sweating Harry Potter. Stupid Harry Potter and his Stupid hair that always looked like a bird was nesting in there. Now more than ever did Draco really want to just try to flatten it a little. It really was a shame of all wizards that he couldn't even keep order in his own hair.
"I don’t care what you do, Potter, it's not like it matters what I think. You're gonna stalk me anyway" Stupid Harry Potter opened his mouth, probably to protest that, but Draco just held up a hand: "Potter I don’t care okay? Do whatever you want." The thoughtful look on Stupid Harry Potter could not bode well for Draco.
Harry laid a hand on Draco’s thigh to get Draco’s attention. Like Harry didn’t have his undivided attention and like Draco hadn’t been pretending to read in his herbology book the past hour.
Hermione as usual was nowhere to be seen. And neither was Ron. What a surprise … Harry decided just to take a nap instead of looking around for them. The last time he had actively looked for them in one of these instances, it had been traumatizing for all three of them. So he would rather not.
Stupid Harry Potter shot him a wry look: "I think that's one of the first times I have ever heard you say Hermione’s name and in a positive context"
"Wait really?"
“But, but Potter how could you wound me like that. I’m already on the very brink of death and now you twist the knife even more so,” Draco said while dramatically turned his head away from Harry with his hand on his forehead pretending to be some victorian lady swooning.
"Oh.. Malfoy.. Can I sit here?" The voice made draco jump and he was ready to curse out the person that no they very well could not sit here, could they not see that draco was very much not in the mood to listen to anyone gush over Stupid Harry Potter who had oh so graciously saved poor Death eater Malfoy.
“Because I wanted to. Did you not want me to? I can stop if it was upsetting? Oh, no, did I read this all wrong. But Hermione said you liked me back. And she is never wrong,” Harry started falling over his own words.
“But you’re so smart and good at potions,” Potter tried to blink innocently at Draco, and when Draco’s unimpressed face didn’t change, he continued: “Alright, how about you help me with potions and I help you with that dada essay, I know you have been struggling with the patronus charm. I can teach you how to cast one.”
"Are you okay?" Stupid Harry Potter asked. His fake concern was very convincing, if it wasn’t for the fact that Draco knew that Stupid Harry Potter did not care one bit about Draco’s feelings, he might even have answered honestly.
A week after the ~incident~, and Harry decided to give up. If Draco didn’t want to see him well then he would very well not look for him anymore. He had even left the map up on his bed to stop the temptation. Instead he sat on the benches out on the quidditch pitch with a whole in his stomach that had gotten bigger for every failed attempt at reaching Draco Malfoy. He was so deep in his self-pity that he didn’t even notice another person joining him, until a warming charm was cast over the two of them.
"My, Potter, was that a compliment? Or have I momentarily gone crazy?"
Did he even like Draco back?
“Well, Potter, what did you do to get me in here this time?” Draco asked.
"I was just asking if you would like to join later, we’re doing an eighth year quidditch match and you're really the only other good seeker."
"Sure, Potter, whatever you want." And thus Potters little games must begin. At first it might start out like this with small asks that sounded like he had a choice and then later they would end it with who knows what, but it surely would be something that would not end well for Draco.
Harry furrowed his brows at Ron: “But what’s that got to do with anything?” Hermione and Ron was having a silent conversation on the other side of the table. “I tapped his leg because he was really invested in his herbology book. Like he was just staring intently at the words.”
The wonderful silence was unfortunately broken by Stupid Harry Potter asking him if he wanted to play chess.
"Mhmm..."
"Yeah, but I never actually expected you to say yes."
"Why were you on the floor?" Stupid Harry Potter asked like Draco had a weird pass time of making snow angels in the middle of Hogwarts hallways.
“Really Harry you should maybe think about what you yourself want from Malfoy and then tell him that. It would help both of you a great deal,” Hermione gently patted his hand and gathered her books. Her and Ron left the table, while Harry couldn’t do anything but stare into his pumpkin juice. Did Draco like him? He tried to compare everything that had happened and Draco’s reactions to those of Cho and Ginny. But then again even those two had been very different from eachother. And Malfoy. Malfoy was a whole other case. Why couldn’t it be easy?
“That’s okay, I’m just happy you’re here,” he tried to smile, but he was afraid it came off a little strained. “Alright, anyway, I wanted to ask you why you ran out on me that other day in the library? Everything okay?” Harry nudged Draco with his shoulder and then left it there as support. Draco tensed up but then relaxed again.
At some point during dinner he finally got the chance to talk to Ron and Hermione. He tried explaining as well as he could what had happened in the library, but it was hard when he didn’t even know himself.
"I'm not a saviour," Stupid Harry Potter mumbled and said directly to Draco: "And you were pardoned, and all charges were dropped against you?"
"Oh, I was out flying when I saw that you were sitting here and I know how much you love our time together here" Stupid Harry Potter even had the audacity to send Draco his signature smirk. Which definitely made him look even more stupid than usual. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath not to throttle Stupid Harry Potter.
"Sitting" Potter didn’t even have the shame to pretend like he hadn't run all the way there.
we are here at last my dudes
Stupid Harry Potter snorted: "Oh the ones that just want to stare at my forehead and be to scared to say anything to me."
“Who said you were my favourite Slytherin? I think Andromeda might be… She’s actually very nice to me unlike other people in this very room.”
"Putting up traps for first years," Draco sighed and when Stupid Harry Potter opened his mouth he hurriedly added. "No, Potter I'm just trying to get to the library to finish my homework." The library was one of the few places Draco still felt relatively safe since Madam Pince kept everyone in perfect order. Who could’ve imagined that he would ever feel gratitude to that old witch.
"Not all of us can rely on our fame to get a job after school, Potter" Draco looked stiffly ahead. "Maybe you should listen more to Granger."
"Nah, I know," And Draco’s shoulders relaxed from a tension he hadn’t been aware of. He hadn't believed in that whole blood purity shit for a long time.
Draco considered for a bit if doing Stupid Harry Potter's bidding here would outweigh actually having to get on a broom again. Eventually, when the pause got too long he answered: "No, I'm sorry Potter, but I'm terribly busy with homework"
It was the last week before Christmas and Draco was sitting doing a dada assignment this time when Potter showed up as usual. This time however, Potter dumped all his things down on the table and just hammered his head down on the table and laid there making sounds of annoyance. Draco could relate to that feeling, not that he would ever be as undignified, but this whole essay on the Patronus charm was killing him. But Draco could not let Potter get this vindication, so he snarled at Potter: "Potter do please shut up. Some of us are trying to do our work here."
the final chapter
"Didn’t I say so?"
"Are you saying you're so attuned to me that you get feelings about me whenever I'm not near?" Stupid Harry Potter blushed and stammered. "Don’t worry Potter, as I said before. I don’t care. you live your life with your little crush. Whatever you want." Draco leaned over to pat Potter on his hand, while Potter continued stutteringly denying any crushes on Draco. Draco had never felt so vindicated before.
“Harry,” Ron said cautiously like he was an easily frightened animal. “ you don’t think perhaps that Malfoy has a crush on you?”. When he opened his mouth to protest loudly. Hermione put a hand on Harry’s hand that was holding tightly on to his glass of pumpkin juice.
"Oh, you're teasing."
And wasn’t Draco just always right. Classes had barely started before he was shoved into walls and "accidentally" dropped all his things.
"Why are you here alone? Where are the other slytherins?" Stupid Harry Potter asked instead.
Draco was going back to Hogwarts, mostly, because he really didn't know what else to do, but also because it was part of his deal with the ministry. The stupid deal Stupid Harry Potter had made with the ministry when he defended him in the trials. Stupid Harry Potter who could make everyone do anything by the mere whiff of his hand. It all just resulted in Draco being indebted to Stupid Harry Potter. And he would never be able to pay him back for this. Stupid Harry Potter surely loved having Draco in his pocket. He was probably plotting all the things he was going to make Draco do now that Draco literally owed him his life several times over. Stupid Harry Potter with his Stupid saviour complex and his Stupid scar that everyone worshipped.
“Potter, who gave you permission to call me by my first name,” truthfully Draco felt very warm and giddy from just hearing Potter say Draco. A small smile crept up on his face. Weasley snorted and Draco redirected his attention to Weasley and lifted a single eyebrow.
“Yeah, apparently, according to Weasley, I should man up and stop moping around,” Draco rolled his eyes. Though Harry could feel the nervous energy rolling of him in waves. “Sorry I haven’t really been around. I had a lot of stuff to think over.”
Snape's eyes flashed maliciously, then he leaned in and whispered infuriatingly, "Think about that next time,
Draco did recall Dumbledore saying something about an Order and a Phoenix.
“Mornin’ Harry!” Fred elbowed him, George mirroring him at his other side.
Draco nodded grimly, slightly ashamed.
"Guess it's kind of working." She remarked.
" Harry quickly jolted to action, Malfoy following suit by keeping their hands clasped on one side and holding Harry's shoulder on the other.  Harry, scouring through his memory of McGonagall's dance lesson, just managed to keep up with Malfoy as they begun to dance. The git, of course, had to look like he was bloody

"A weapon that Dumbledore's also out to get?" Harry said. "So the Order and Voldemort are trying to get to the same thing? It can't possibly be that powerful. If killing's what they want, won't an
He glanced around one more time, then hissed, "

"I'm sorry, Harry." Draco said, finally looking at him, "I just need to say to them what you won't."
"Never mind you. You never even do your homework." Draco muttered under his breath.
He felt his eyebrows raise. Harry looked up at that moment, too, making confused eye contact with him for a second before noticing Hermione.
"Wait." Draco said, placing his hands on his hips as well. "That means that
“I’ll read it later.” Draco folded up the parchment, tucking it neatly into his robe pocket.
“You never know.” Hermione shrugged. “Magic is magic. We’re not even sure how the hat is even sentient…”
"Oh!" Harry's blush hadn't left for some reason, and his eyes were glued to the poster where Draco's finger was pointing. "A motorbike! You ride it."
"Right. Trust Voldemort not to know proper design elements of magical tattoos." Harry said ruefully. Draco snorted and crossed his arms around his knees, but the air still felt strained and tense.
"Our families have always rivaled, you see. Ron used to come home and tell us the worst things…"
"He's not
Pansy sighed as if the world’s weight were resting on her shoulders because of the empty parchment in front of her. “Well, she hears whatever lark we cough up, decides whether it all serves enough mortal peril to us or the people we love then moves on and just gives everyone an automatic A or E.” She slumped down in her seat so her head rested on the back of the chair, making her face upwards. To Draco’s irritation, Pansy placed a quill on her face while she contorted her expression so it stayed balanced there, making her look positively insane. “That is unless you’re having especially morbid astrological predictions, in which case you get an O for your troubles.”
Draco let Pansy handle him the whole way, quite honestly shocked at the lack of altercation that had just happened. He had been prepared to be civil to Potter from then on, but he didn't expect the boy to be so serious about the truce thing as well. It was almost as if Potter was being, Merlin help them all,
If there was a way for Severus to strangle him through the Floo network, he probably would have at that moment. His face was twisted in to a frown so much, Draco almost couldn't recognise him. "I am unsure of such trivial details, and I even I were, I
"But…Your family…What my father did to Ginevra-"
Harry said nothing behind him except a small amused huff. The kettle begun to sing, and Draco took it off before it could get too loud and poured steaming water in to two cups.
"It's a nice haircut, Harry." Hermione said, her voice clean cut and well-annunciated.
"I take it the egg is being no good?" Draco asked, hoping Potter wouldn't lash out at him like he assumedly did to Granger and the Weasel.
More nausea. "Yes, sir."
"Makes me feel way better, Potter." Draco said, but decided to let the matter lie for the time being. "Thanks for ruining the nap I was about to have, by the way."
"Obviously not, Hermione." Ron chuckled without looking up. Hermione just rolled her eyes and grabbed Ron's textbook from where his arm had been resting on. Ignoring his grunt of annoyance, she flicked through the pages while speaking,
Malfoy only smirked and replied, "And you step like an oaf. For someone who plays Quidditch you're incredibly inflexible." They nearly veered in to Fleur and her date before Malfoy gripped Harry's shoulder like steel and steered them away. Harry considered thanking him, but after seeing Malfoy's sneer he just sent a him a glare and tried his best to focus on other things around the Hall.
(See the end of the chapter for
, want anybody dead for it. Please believe that, Potter." Malfoy finished. Harry laughed humourlessly and looked at Malfoy incredulously, "You're more naïve than I thought. Merlin, you've been sheltered. I haven't even been in the Wizarding World more than four years and I know more about reality than you."
“Shit,” Ron swore when he saw it. He leant in closer to it and after a moment his face turned into a scowl. “Is this from her?” he asked harshly. “I thought you said you were doing lines?”
But instead, his father spoke, "Just now. What was that?"
Isn't that something! It's the day of the Ball and our very coveted champion, Harry Potter, has yet to find a date!" He laughed a second time, causing anger to bloom in Harry's chest. Having the stress of finding out the clue to the next challenge, thinking about Sirius and staying constantly vigilant because he was apparently in danger (once again), Harry's anger had been at a considerable level consistently over the past few months. He was barely juggling his schoolwork, piled with solving the next challenge's clue, worrying about Sirius getting caught and overall trying not to die every 3 months for once in his years at Hogwarts. Not to mention the humiliation of getting rejected by Cho. Harry almost crumpled in to a ball on the spot. Why couldn't he just have something like a normal Quidditch season? Quidditch he knew. Not dragons and golden eggs.
"Uncle Vernon- No!"
"That's enough, you two!" Sirius said loudly, shooing them away. "Jokers, those ones." He gave a nervous laugh, and Remus raised his eyebrows but said nothing, an amused expression on his face.
“Using defensive spells?” Umbridge repeated with a little laugh, incredulous. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”
"You've seen it?" Harry asked curiously.
“Shut up.” Harry turned his face away, feeling it grow hot. “And you know what I mean. Just...Don’t mention this to Hermione or Draco, will you?”
It was the small things, over the years as he kept his eye on Potter and his friends. How they laughed with each other during meal times, Potter's tendency to push the middle of his glasses up over the bridge of his nose because they slipped when he did so. Granger's reassuring touches, Weasley's dramatic facial expressions as the three talked. It was always the three of them, wrapped up in some plot or other each year. They never left any space for anyone else, even the Weaslette as she tried to join their conversations from time to time.
Pansy nodded as if that made complete sense.
Draco was taking to not having to clean very nicely. He was propped up on a velvet green couch that had been hidden and quite well preserved underneath a large plastic tarp and many various objects on top. One leg slung over the other, both over one of the couch's arms, Draco looked in his natural element: not doing anything at all. His nose was buried deep within a book that Harry had seen him pick up out of a random pile not too much earlier, and was somehow talking to all of them and reading at the same time. "Better believe it." He said. "Dumbledore's making me keep an eye out on her for him."
“Who’s that?” Hermione asked suspiciously, eyeing the woman.
"It's
, Moony? Me? The law?"
"Bye, Draco!" Remus called behind him as he walked away. "Have a good school year!"
, he even might start throwing it in the air again. The horror of it vanished Draco's grogginess for the time being, instead fueling him with panic. Draco vowed that if he even found a
“Just go to bed. I’ll have a word with the others tomorrow.” Ron said justly.
she? I’m a prefect just as much as you are! She can’t just… disregard me like that!”
"Mr. Malfoy, you may wait inside. Champions and their dates only." She advised.
"What did you think I did?" Draco asked accusingly.
“Happy?” Draco asked, looking down at them. They nodded vigorously, and he couldn’t suppress a small smirk at that.
"What's wrong?" He asked nervously when he looked between the two of them. Seamus chucked his pieces in the air and stomped up to the Dormitory's. Dean stayed behind, picking up the pieces and shaking his head to himself with a small smile.
The Purebloods and their children. Most of them might even be sympathisers for Voldemort's cause. Not just some, Draco thought, glancing at them. Probably all.
Malfoy scoffed, "I believed you when you said a murderous dark wizard was coming back from the dead, I think I can comprehend your inability to surpass Albus Dumbledore's spellwork."
"Hermione!" Draco called out to the girl, whom was stood at the back off the room, leant against the wall in the shadows with her arms crossed pensively. "Stop them! It's insane!"
“Shit!” Draco jumped, grabbing over his chest where his heart was pounding. “Don’t sneak up on me.” He quickly glanced around, seeing that Chang was gone and they were finally alone.
scared you weren’t going to get in, though?”
"No, you dolt, I-" And Malfoy stopped himself immediately, a slight flush creeping over his face. At once, it dawned on Harry.
“Then...it really was...You-Know-Who?”
"Yeah, here." Harry handed it from his side to Ron, who stared chop and crush the Evergreen leaves. Harry adjusted the heat on his cauldron, looking around the room as he waited for Ron. As he leaned back on to his desk, back to his cauldron, he caught the glare of Parvati Patil from across the room. She was shooting straight daggers at Harry and his skin jumped. He turned back around, "Uh, Ron?"
Draco crossed his arms, looking down at him, “Forgive me if that doesn’t sound convincing.”
"What about at school?" Harry said, interrupting Draco's muttering's about disorganised library sections.
"Uh, Hermione!" Harry blurted, trying to change the subject. She looked at him expectantly, eyebrows raised in a way that reminded him of McGonagall. Did the girl have to resemble every mother figure in his life? "You..Uh - look very pretty." He cleared his throat and waited for her to cuss him out. Luckily, her eyes softened and she said sadly,
"Sorry."
"Gillyweed." Malfoy said for the third time that morning, and Harry fought down his irritation. At Harry's sour expression, Malfoy continued quickly, "It's a plant - or a weed. I don't know, ask Longbottom." Harry quirked an eyebrow but said nothing. "I saw Professor Snape using it for a Potion yesterday. It's basically added to potions to counteract their drying effect from other ingredients. Especially the ones with alkali or water bases? It's mostly in liquid form, though-"
Harry closed his eyes. He’d come so far already, though. He’d just have to keep fighting, and as much as he loathed it, he needed his friends with him to help. Ron, Hermione and Draco. Without them, then all of this was all for nought. Without them, Harry couldn’t see a way out.
“Have a biscuit,” she repeated, tapping the tartan. “Go on.”
“Professor,” Draco spoke, catching Umbridge’s almost attention immediately as if she were hanging on his every last word. “Will you be the one teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts?”
“What’s with the broom?” Harry asked swiftly, changing the subject. He glanced over to the Cleansweep in the corner.
-o-o-
“Dolores Umbridge, on her own, can do very little,” he said after a long moment of thought.
“-besides, he’s probably going to go on a
“If not a lie, then - then....” Umbridge spoke erratically, her breath coming in fast now.
Dumbledore sighed, probably at his rudeness, but Draco didn’t particularly care. He’d forfeited respect for the man a long time ago.
"Personally?" Blaise said, leaning in, "The latter. I honestly believe you haven't been the same since that night. Everything's changed since then."
(See the end of the chapter for

"A half-circle is an arc, Harry!" Draco said loudly. He threw up his hands in defeat and Harry smiled sheepishly. Bloody git.

"A truce for what, exactly?" She asked.
“I can’t just let her spread lies-”
"You're that woman's
Ron's grip loosened over his arm when Snape was gone, "Blimey, Harry." Ron muttered. "I wouldn't put it past him to actually slip you some one day."
"Tell them what?" Draco startled.
"Alright. I'll find some time to talk to him."
His Godfather's face only became more sour, if such a thing were possible. "Just be ready. Goodby-"
"And here we have them!" Harry heard as a sonorous of Dumbledore's voice roared, "Our Triwizard Tournament Champions!"
His father bore a stare in to him that he'd become accustomed to over the years. He did what was safest, which was neither instigate nor avoid eye contact. It took everything in him to keep his face blank and his breathing even, and he hoped he didn’t look like he was sweating as much as he felt like he was.
"Never been surer in my life." Draco said, the dazed grin on his face faded. "We can do it. Come on, Harry." He looked at him intently, hoping he understood how important it was to Draco. "If not for you, then for me. I'll be at the Manor this summer…my father will be there. I'm not sure what he has in store for me yet, but I need the reassurance. I'm not….brave, like you are."
Ron shrugged on his robes, scoffing rudely. “Yeah.”
side. Dumbledore's. The light side." Harry urged.
"Mhm. We'll see." Draco waved him off.
She laid eyes on one of them. “Yes, Mr-?”
"Oof! Fuck!" The boy clutched his stomach and groaned while Draco muttered murderous obscenities' under his breath. He laid down and turned away from Harry, grumbling about annoying Gryffindor's thinking they owned the place.
Draco scowled, “What are your grades like again? Because last time we checked, your expected OWLS were well below a- Ow!” Pansy had shoved her elbow into his side again. Merlin, he was probably going to bruise because of the woman. “Stop it!” he hissed at her, rubbing his side. The group of students closest to them started to rise out of their seats and pack up their materials, huffing irritably.
leave his room, and ended up staying in there the whole day.
"Don't take that tone with your mother." His father passed by behind him, hitting him lightly on the side of the head.
A flash of green light. The deep, baritone hiss of a snake echoing down a long corridor. He needed to get to the end of that corridor…just a few more steps…but his legs felt like lead. Like wading through thick mud, swallowing him up the more he moved…
Draco nodded, and he continued.
. But he, of course, never bothered to remember that Draco was the proclaimed Prince of Slytherin. He knew how to spot manipulation, had so since a young age. Potter tried to beat him at his own game. It was almost sad. Draco knew it was up to him to reclaim Potter's desired control. Potter wanted him to humiliate himself by rejecting his asking to the Ball, thus possibly implying he was scared of the boy, not to mention the obvious defeat it symbolised. Potter wanted to take him to the Ball? So be it.
“Look, Harry. I just wanted to say that erm...What you said in Defense today...I completely agreed with you…”
"I am on your side, but I can't afford to act like it. From now on, I'll be acting as I normally would. My father would only trust me more if I showed interest in all that Dark Lord bullshit. But make no mistake that I'm on
.” Neville corrected next to him, and the portrait swung open toward them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed.
"Weakened, father?"
He attached the letter he’d written the day before to Athena as she pecked at his hair insistently. “Alright! Just give me a bloody moment you bloody bird-” He fished out a few treats from his trouser pocket, letting her go at it before finishing tying the letter to her leg.
"I'm not sure." Harry mumbled, then paused as he realised the room was too quiet. Hermione seemed to realise at the same time, and they both whirled around to where Draco and Ron were.
"I'm quite extraordinary." Draco agreed, lounging on his side and massaging his knee. "Now is there a reason why you've dared visit my humble abode?"
"Bollocks." Weasley's voice cursed behind him.
Ron groaned, turning back to his eggs and finally digging in.
“Well a little Inter-House Unity wouldn’t be too harmful, now would it?” Hermione said. She leant over the table surreptitiously so they both could hear her as she whispered, “And this thing with Draco...Do you think it has something to do with it?”
, Weasley." Draco shot back in a venemous tone that had Harry near wincing. "Therefore, goes in
"Very smart choice, Harry." Hermione said approvingly, but Ron just scoffed.
“I...Thank you, though. For this.” Harry gestured to his bandaged hand.
While the idea of being indebted to Blaise was agonisingly painful, he needed this way more. Not only that, but Blaise was one of his most trusted friends. He knew that whatever it was, it probably wouldn’t be too bad.
Above them, the leaves of the Willow tree rustled slightly, but other than that, the night was relatively still. Harry closed his eyes, feeling uncharacteristically calm, which was of course when Draco finally decided to speak.
"Exactly. You're not him, and not responsible for what he does. You're making your own man. You being here proves that, don't you think?"
', right?" His father nodded, expression blank, and Draco cleared his throat and continued, "After that, I just…incantated the opposite meaning. I chose
Stopping in front of the entrance to the Slytherin Common Rooms, he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders back. He spat the password and walked in.
about it Harry. I can’t do my job properly if she stops trusting me. Even today she made a passing comment at me about my father and the Ministry. This whole plan hinges on me having her trust, and if she’s going after my father then how will that turn out?”
"The Order needs you to keep an eye on Dolores as she keeps an eye on us - or should I say me. You're a model student, both academically and through her eyes. Work closely with her, and find out whatever's important throughout the year."
"That's barmy." Blaise scoffed, but at Draco's expression his eyes widened.
"Draco." He offered with a smile, which she returned. There was something in her grin, however, that glinted malice and cunning that gave him chills.
“Brilliant,” Harry said through a tight grin.
Harry frowned at Ron, “You weren’t with Hermione?”
Draco nodded thoughtfully, "Yeah, Pansy and Blaise already know a bit about us."
"Really?" Draco's chest bloomed with anticipation.
Harry leant back, throwing an arm over his eyes. The room was still spinning slightly and he hastily tried to dispel the nausea that was causing his stomach to stir. He had nothing left to bloody throw-up, for Merlin’s sake. If only the dizziness would go away.
"How do you know it was her?" Malfoy asked weakly.
"Is he back?" Draco gasped. He remembered how Black had apparently broken in and assaulted a portrait the year before. He'd also been after Harry for revenge, but had inexplicably disappeared at the end of the year.
aA you may have read the OOTP, there is quite a bit of graphic content in regards to skin m*tilation from all the blood quill shit that umbridge pulls. Be warned of descriptions of that in this chapter!!
“Good morning, Mister Malfoy.” She greeted, almost as if Pansy weren’t even there.
He slammed the cup down, startling a few people around him. “Going for a walk.” He said simply, getting up to stand.
Harry stared down at his palms in his lap, focusing on them rather than the turmoil of emotions in his head. “I don’t know.” He said so quietly, it could have been a whisper. “I probably proved them right. I am a nutcase.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
When Harry got back inside just as breakfast ended, he saw Ron and Hermione walking out the Great Hall. When they saw him they looked both apprehensive and relieved at the same time, and Harry rushed towards them and pulled them in to a bone-crushing hug before they could say anything.
Harry was busy sweeping Hedwig's owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe, and Draco was busy being unhelpful as always, lounging in his bed with a book in his hands.
"I'm sorry." Was the first thing Harry could think of to say, although he regretted doing so immediately knowing it might make Malfoy defensive again.
If this really was the case, then who knows how Harry might be unknowingly affected. It’d be even worse on him since he didn’t know it was happening.
, he thought, but couldn't seem to think of anything else. He couldn't seem to think at all. Damn his racing heart. Damn him. Damn Potter.
"Come in."
Harry felt his eye twitch, not unlike Umbridge’s did that morning, but kept his smile consistent. “It’s totally fine! We’re cool, alright?”
"I'm sorry." Is all he said.
Draco raised an eyebrow, "That's what I said." He said flatly.
But Harry pretended not to hear.
’ ” she said softly, but to him the sound grated on his ears. He didn’t even dare comment on the accuracy of the statement, knowing it would be a futile attempt just like the one that landed him in detention at all.
"That was your
," He started, and Harry almost smiled because it sounded so similar to someone he knew, "There's obviously a connection between you and the Dark Lord. Mainly to do with your scar. I guess killing him backfired; now he's stuck in your bloody head."
Ron stared at him suspiciously from a moment and finally nodded, looking back at Hermione. The girl was seething, and Harry could understand why. Why did Ron have to be such an arse? It was absolute horrible timing.
"What is it?" Harry asked worriedly, crouching in front of him. "What hurts?"
"Do you really think you can win?" Draco asked instead, trying to forget the unsettled feelings stirring inside him.
He heard Draco snort, "Yeah, I can do magic."
And with that, Draco slammed the door behind him, panting from the exertion of yelling. He stared at the ground for a few moments as the trio watched in silence, then his eyes flicked up and widened in surprise.
"It was a stupid question." Draco disagreed. "And so were the
Harry felt his eyes widen, “What? Ourselves?”
Harry stiffened as he saw the words appear on the page in a deep red ink despite there being none on the quill. His right hand began to sting for some reason, and he swiped it down his robes irritably before writing the next line.
He spent his first day at Hogwarts in turmoil, Harry Potter having just rejected his hand on the train. The Sorting Hat had placed him in Slytherin as expected, and Draco couldn't understand why his chest felt weird when it took almost no time at all for him to have been Sorted.
"M- Draco." Bill started hesitantly, as if trying to find the right way to phrase what he was saying. He paused and gestured for Draco to take the seat beside him, resuming once he'd done so. "I was…skeptical at first. About you, that is."
The corners of Malfoy's mouth twitched at that.
He suddenly felt the sting of a hex on his arm, "Ow!" He yelped.
Around him, he could see Ginny and a few other recognisable faces of his House in the corner of his eyes. His heart jumped momentarily at the sight of his friends, but the energy around them felt off, so he kept his head low.
"Sir?" Draco asked curiously.
." Draco scoffed, "I'm not that scary, and besides, if I am it's only because of my family's reputation."
"It just…all they do is worry about me. I know it comes from a good place, but all they want to do is go to Dumbledore for every little thing. Sometimes I can't even tell them if my scar really
Moody wasn't in the stands.
"You'll be fine. Joining the team again this year?"
"At least you don't have to deal with child-minding a literal hag, Weasley." Draco said. "That and risking my life spying for you lot, as well as achieving all the O.W.L.S I want…" Draco trailed off for a moment worriedly. "Merlin, why am I here, again?"
“No, no,” she said quickly. “I can - yes. I can recall what I said now, thank you.”
“That’s splendid,” Umbridge said, bringing out a stack of papers, presumably to mark. “Off you go, then.”
"I'll die of the Cruciatus before I recognise his breed as mine." Draco sneered, sounding nasally as if he'd been crying. What had happened while he'd been gone? Why was Draco even here?
They were all currently tackling a hoard of Doxies with, that by some grace of Merlin himself had survived who knows how long in a drawer that had been buried deep underneath a pile of clothing Draco felt weird going too close to.
A Ministry Owl, then.
. Wasn't he Slytherin Seeker for a reason?
"Time is Galleons, little brother." The other - Fred - said, holding a very long length of flesh coloured string. "Anyways, Harry, Malfoy, you've been summoned to lunch. The meeting's over now and dear Harry here was interfering with reception the whole time."
It was Mrs. Figg, and Harry almost recoiled away. Flashbacks on uncomfortable days with her babysitting him flashed across his eyes. She was
be able to believe you. What you told me last time fit in so well with that's been happening at home and with my father, I'm the only one that has the evidence to back it up, thus it makes sense enough for be to believe you. You rather just confirmed what was in front of me."
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating fashion at Harry, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
They made their way past the common room, where people were already lounging. In the corner, he could see Fred and George posting something on the bulletin board, Lee Jordan at their side grinning conspiratorially. Harry figured they may have been up to something, but ignored digging further in favour of the idea of curling up in his bed after a long, tiring day like this one had been.
“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up to Harry, and surprisingly, one to Draco.
love."
"Ah, alright." Draco said, Moody still his focus in his peripheral vision, "Thank you."
. How long have you been here again?"
Draco noticed his expression, motioning him to continue. "And?"
Then Harry sighed, long and deep as if sought out from a bone deep kind of tired. "Alright, fine." He exhaled, "We'll do it."
the teachers. He doesn't feel right."
"No, but I did promise to share anything I know with you that one time by the Lake. When we first met after the Ball?"
The walls were glittering quite nicely, though. That, Draco found, was nice enough to be here for. They looked like untouched snow had fallen on them. The kind that fell naturally from the sky and settled in a way that they looked so peaceful and undisturbed. Draco liked the simplicity of that. He liked simple things. Sometimes it was all just too much.
"Aha! I was right, wasn't I?"
Harry felt himself slipping. He picked up the blood quill roughly, “You can inscribe it into my flesh as many times as you want, but it will never be true! What I said is the truth! The truth!”
"He's my competitor!" Potter exclaimed,  "I have to keep tabs on him…and stuff." He trailed off, looking at their feet as they danced around Viktor and Granger. He snapped his eyes to Draco, "Why were you looking at me then?" He challenged.
His blood ran cold throughout his entire body. He felt a lump in his throat that might reveal everything to his father just through his tone. His instincts fought to keep his face a blank mask of indifference. If his father saw nothing unusual, he wouldn't ask. Absence of emotion was easier than faking any he didn't feel.
to the Ball!"
“Night, Ron.”
Like tendrils of black cloth floating through the air.
“Probably, but what the hell would be in the Magical Archives? It’s not like it’s Gringotts or anything.”
"Potter, it's not complex Arithmancy. Eat something. You just look like shit.'
"Well that's fitting!" Harry shot back, dropping his wand hand and holding his other hand out to Malfoy with a deadly glitter in his green eyes,  "Because I was going to ask you to fill that spot!"
"This is…" Harry trailed off.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.”
"Draco, why does it matter to you?" Blaise sighed.
"Joke shop?" Draco asked inquiringly.
, but if it was used the right way it couldn't be so bad, right? It might even be helpful one day, if he got that far.
"Ow! Shit!" Malfoy yelped, looking murderously at Harry before Dumbledore's voice rang out again to announce them.
you anything, Malfoy." He said with a glare, "Now shove off before I feel the need to summon Professor Moody over."
"Morning Harry." Sirius said, voice rough, to which Harry replied with a mumbled grunt. "Merlin, it's early."
“I’m only sharing this with you because I believe you’re a truly responsible boy and I can trust you with-”
He stood, his hand burning from both the cuts and her repulsive touch. Gathering his bag over his shoulder, he hesitated a moment, clearing his throat to get her attention.
"What-" But Draco just sighed, "Never mind. I'm not staring."
"T..Ten?" Nott stammered, looking wearily at Blaise.
Draco. Merlin, Harry hadn’t even thought about facing him again the whole day.
"Yes, actually." Harry said, laughing. "You're both related. That's weird."
, and Dumbledore said I could come to you for help since you're apparently
“Nope.” Harry said, popping the ‘P’. “Not if I can help it.”
and smile at people. Disgusting.
"Draco." Ginevra said again, resting her chin on her arm, almost laying completely on the table to face him. "Draaacooo."
“Ow!” Draco yelped, hopping in place as he cradled his injured limb. “What was that-”
"Quite." Draco said, watching the boy lay back completely and cushion his head with his arms behind his head. Only a moment of silence passed before Draco realised the boy had closed his eyes and fallen asleep right in front of him.
"It's not something people talk about generally. In fact, not everyone is so accepting as you, even in the muggle world."
Harry tried to wrestle himself away, but his Uncle's grip was too strong. He couldn't move properly, and a suffocating feeling grasped his chest. Vernon only shook Harry harder, and shoved him forwards towards the stairs.
Another flash of colour. Blue robes. A crooked gait. A heavy, rough limp.
“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them when they were training during the holidays.”
He glanced at Harry, who had also stilled and was looking at the table with the same amount of curiosity. Harry then looked back at him, and grinned for a split second before breaking out into a run at the same time as Draco did towards the desk.
Face hot, he raised his head from the bowing position to see the Hippogriff bowing in return. At that height, he could almost look at it eye to eye, and indeed it opened it's gaze to him once more openly. They looked at each other for a moment, understanding where the other stood. Acceptance. Mutuality. Something in his chest loosened, relief from the gesture as he realised it really wasn't so bad after all.
"One" He muttered.
." Hermione warned, and he smiled at sheepishly.
TWs for this chapter! I'll include a brief summary of everything that happens at the end if you aren't comfortable with reading :)
"It's because they dilute our history! The come in with their muggle customs and technology and use magic with them in ways that go against how we've lived for hundreds of years! The people that support them support the loss of our culture!"
“Bloody hurts, you idiot.” Harry reached his side, mumbling and rubbing his arm. Draco shushed him, eyes locking in on a familiar piece of parchment he assumed was the one Umbridge had been writing on earlier. He leant closer with bated breath.
"Would've thought that since he's a Malfoy he'd be less involved, y'know what I mean?" Ron sighed.
"It's Moody!" Draco shouted, "He's not right. I don't trust him! Where is he?"
"I'm going to go to bed." He said simply. Ron and Hermione nodded and Harry felt both of their gazes on him as he walked to his dormitory. Ron's sympathetic and Hermione's calculating.
"Well, technically we are but - how do I put it. Sirius doesn't particularly care about gender, and I've never cared about anyone except Sirius - in that kind of way, that is."
" Draco accused scandalously. "Remind me to keep my Gillyweed to myself next time!"
"Court hearing?" Harry asked puzzledly. "For me?"
while Hermione was looking away. Ron responded with a small smile, shaking his head at the formality.
to seeing Harry. "He's…" The man paused, trying to find the right words. "He's been hurt. Don't make it any worse. I'm hanging on to the trust Harry placed on you, so don't disappoint me. Alright?"
“Nothing I haven’t gotten before.” Blaise said, which only made Draco feel guiltier. He swivelled to sit upright in the chair once again, facing his friend.
Harry's eyes shot open, meeting Draco's. "Hearing."
"You can't tell me what to do, Draco." Harry said hotly, clenching his fists in his lap. Draco's laid back posture didn't change, but his face was tightly lipped and cold.
" Harry whispered, and he went in to put Cedric's advice to the test.
Draco, for some reason, felt slightly put out at that. It wasn’t that he disagreed with Dumbledore, but surely he was somewhat emotionally invested in Harry’s wellbeing as well? They
Malfoy looked hesitant, not knowing where Harry was going with this.
this was kind of a filler chapter, but enjoy nonetheless!
"It doesn't make sense." Draco replied, tapping his lip with his index finger repetitively, "He doesn't sound to have been in any shape to attack Krum at all, never mind make some grand escape from Hogwarts."
Harry scowled, "He's alive, just not…strong. In the dream there was barely any…
Potter cocked his head to the side and smiled crookedly, "Oh my. Draco Malfoy just thanked me in casual conversation. What have I created?"
“Yes?”
“Like I’ve never been given one of
Draco hesitated for a moment, letting the words sink in, before springing to action and following hurriedly after Harry. "Oi! You better wait, Potter. I'm not sitting next to Weasley."
Harry shot him a questioning look, and Ron reiterated, “She looked like she wanted to talk to you alone….Do you like her?”
, "Please just let me do this, Harry." He shut his eyes tightly, willing away the way they stung when opened, "I can do this. I need to do this. I don't know who I'll become otherwise, so
"One week before term starts." Snape said.
, they were to find.
He didn't want to think about any of it, so he didn't.
"Oh yeah?" Draco asked cockily, lifting himself up to lean on his elbows, "Well now I've got a proper date that isn't our lovely Pansy."
"Enterprise, dear Draco. Enterprise."
"You want me to focus on
." Sirius nudged him, hissing from the side of his mouth. "You tell him. Properly."
"You!" Vernon roared. "You better undo whatever it is you've done to him, or so help me-"
The sun rose higher and they both turned back inside, dew moistening Harry's glasses slightly.
"You're telling me." The boy scoffed.
. From now on you will address me as so, understand?"
“Wh- What do you mean ‘another’?” Draco’s beginning tirade was stopped by the dull expression on Blaise’s face. “I- well of bloody course he’s involved somehow! It’s just… he doesn’t know about this, thank you very much. My own volition completely, Blaise.”
"If I don't do this," Draco said, his voice now low and tightly controlled, "I will have no choice, Harry. I
He didn't feel like this anywhere else other than by the Lake. And maybe that's why there were suddenly uncontrollable tears streaming down his face, in to the ground, hidden from view but feeling like the loudest things he could have done.
"You're an idiot." Harry said. Draco, inexplicably, nodded in agreement. Harry sighed and took off his glasses, rubbing his eyes with one hand while the other held them.
His stomach turned in on itself again as he stared down at his plate of food. He really did want to eat it but feared he might just end up throwing it up right after anyway. Hermione spared him some analytical glances throughout the meal over her knitting needles. Luckily, Ron also seemed to be snoozing into a plate of eggs, so her attention was divided.
“Oh, that’s nothing. I’d hurt you somewhere visible if that surrogate mother of yours didn’t prowl the halls.” Pansy crossed her arms over her chest bitterly.
from everyone else. That’s all I could guess from what I’ve seen.”
Transfigurations was no better. McGonagall spent half of the first hour rigorously reminding them all yet again of the standards that they were to uphold in preparation for their upcoming exams. It didn’t help that they were moving on to Bodily Transfigurations in class, which was one of the parts of the subject Harry did particularly the worst at.
It became easy from there, stepping In to the role he'd seen his father take so many times. No one dared oppose him, because at the end of the day, people were  scared of his last name and what it could do. How he'd seen his father speak of muggleborns all his life, he would reflect on to the ones he went to classes with. The things his father had taught him about muggles, he would find in the bad taste in his mouth at the sight of them. All the whisperings and ideas his father threw at him magnified and inflated his sense of self, smug in the fact that he was
"You were laughing just now, mate…" Ron said, glancing at him nervously.
"Shut up, Malfoy." He whispered roughly, not looking away from Weasley and Granger. The Weasel, however, was already scowling at Draco, and Granger was fuming as she looked between the three of them.
"Isn't he." Blaise said thoughtfully. "Too sweet for his own good."
"I read the paper." Harry bit out. "I didn't see anything."
"Oh, I see." He heard Blaise murmur, having come to peer over his shoulder at some point. "You still with Potter?"
Could he say that to his father, though? Of bloody well course not. Draco didn't have a death wish just yet, and even if he did say something, his father would absolutely
"Right, well I was
"He probably hates me." Draco sighed, not listening to Harry and imagining all the ways Sirius Black may want to murder him at the moment. "Death Eater's

" Harry admonished.
Remus looked between them, confused, before Sirius patted him on the knee. "The boy's a spy, Moony." He reminded. "His home is…"
“It’s not the same, obviously.”
He couldn’t believe the amount of haggling it took to reign in fresh-eyes First Years on the train ride alone. Merlin, bless the prefects from his first year if he was even remotely as annoying (knowing himself, he was probably even worse). Not only were they irritatingly energetic, but they still seemed to hold on to the idea that life was good, or Merlin help them all, even
Leaving his weird cousin to it, Draco hurried past him, but the man placed a firm hand on in front of him before he could pass through.
"Indeed. Now it wasn't until Ron said to me one day-" She pauses and looks at him, "Would you like to tell Harry what it was you said to me?"
“You two need to get a life.” Pansy sighed. “And by the way, Draco, has Umbridge been acting weird?”
" But his head felt strangely lighter. Patting his hair, he was shocked to feel very little of it left on his head.
It was another stickman, but this time with exaggerated robes, a pointed nose and overly slicked hair. He added a speech bubble, writing
"Not at all. It was just convenient for me to stay where I was." His voice sounded misdirected, as if he hadn't turned around to face Harry.
Harry grit his teeth.
"It's a simple question." Ginevra sang.
“Oh Merlin, no.” Blaise snorted. “He’s alright at the Ministry. Works down in the archives. Good pay, surprisingly.”
A sense of despair then settled on him that wasn't far off from the feeling he'd get if a Dementor were near. What would he do now? He was
Seamus puffed out his chest as he said, “Something like that, yes.”
"I'm sorry." Harry said to him again, hating the lack of sound except for the crying he couldn't seem to stop. Malfoy wasn't saying anything, and that was almost worse. He rarely even cried in front of his friends. What was he doing here? He felt more embarrassed than he'd ever felt in his life.
“Based on your judgment, how dangerous do you think Umbridge is to the school?”
"Don't know yet. Said they might show us soon."
"And a prick." Harry supplied.
"Er…Okay."
"And throwing me in to a train compartment is…" Harry trailed off questioningly, crossing his arms with a glare and feeling his pulse still racing.
“My name is Pansy Parkinson, ma’am.” Pansy finally spoke up again, holding out a hand for Umbridge to shake. The woman turned to Pansy as if she’d sprouted a new head on her shoulders. Her expression went from tooth-rottingly sweet to tight-lipped in a flash.
Draco nodded, "Joke's on me for thinking I could get any rest when you're around."
Harry hummed in agreement, "It was technically Volde- You-Know-Who, but yeah it was her. You didn't know it was your father?" Malfoy shook his head again, staring at the ground blankly.
"Private?" Draco's eyes widened.
"You of all people should know the risks of that Vow." Ron said loudly beside Hermione.
"It's fine. I'll go." He said. He was going to make sure it wasn't the Triwizard Tournament all over again. He couldn't bear to be fighting with Ron like that all over again. He turned quickly, "Draco-"
“I...well it’s best if I don’t tell you, really.”
TW: mentions/ descriptions of scarring and the usual blood quill stuff.
"They are not his blood." Dumbledore repeated himself. "He needs his Aunt's connection with his mother."
"I already apologised for it." Draco said through gritted teeth, "We both already sorted out what I did to him in the past."
"Not like that, you tosser. I mean I know that you get a little barmy being around me and Hermione all the time."
Draco smirked smugly, twiddling his fork around. “That’s for me to know and for you to find out, I guess.”
He was saved in making the decision as the woman spoke when they made eye contact for eerily too long, “Mr Potter….” Her tone was inquiring, which Harry found extremely annoying as he wasn’t particularly in the mood to be accommodating to any kind of inquiry - especially from her, considering he was tearing open his hand every few seconds and she was the bloody reason.
"No, Sir." Draco said, confused.
“I’ve got a query about your course aims.” said Hermione.
"They seem to be more focused on the Ministry from the inside, for some reason. Arthur and Bill had a lot to say about the security within the lower levels of the Ministry - Seems Bill is there for much more than humble civil service."
Draco looked back down at the palms of his hands, searching them as he always seemed to do for a reason he wasn’t aware of. They were lined with creases and folds that he could never seem to ingrain in his mind, surprising him everytime he studied them as if seeing them for the first time.
Glancing around the room, he predictably saw Harry and Ronald seeming to be playing some game on a piece of shared parchment, but what drew his eyes quickly was the sight of Hermione Granger not slaving away at the assigned work like he would have expected her to be. Instead, her eyes were fixed on Umbridge and her hand was ramrod straight up in the air.
"You sure he's okay? He'll be fine?"
“Well, are you going to explain the rest?” Pansy eventually asked incredulously.
"Right, thank you, Mother." Draco bowed slightly, looking at his father and doing the same silently. "I'll be off, then."
He stood out of his chair, bowing slightly out of pure habit that had him biting his tongue in an internal cringe,
"Is it dangerous?" Hermione asked, face stricken with fear.
“Oh-” Harry started to apologise, slightly hoping it wasn’t Cho again, when he looked up and saw Seamus looking at him, eyes wide.
-o-o-
"I know. So as I said earlier, tell me where else you're going to find good people like this that will believe you. People that trust you and will not only stand by but will fight for you. Do you think the Weasley's take it lightly, being involved this time around when their family is almost doubled in size?"
Even the coals couldn't hide his Godfather's displeased expression, but Draco continued anyway. "Father's making me worse my arse-"
in to Ron!" She said angrily. Harry hesitantly walked over,
None dead. No destruction. No news. He got
“Dreams? Weird ones? Trelawney worthy ones?” Pansy continued boredly, seemingly unaware of his panic.
"Uh…I said you could have some. The croissants? Was it offensive?" He explained cautiously, gesturing to the food between them. And to demonstrate they weren't poisoned or otherwise ill-intended, Draco swiped one up and took a bite. Potter just stared at him intensely, his eyes roving over Draco's face like he was trying to figure something out.
expect a redemption, though, cause he's a cool guy.
"Damn Slytherins." Harry heard Ron mutter under his breath.
“You support them?” Ron looked at her suspiciously, as if completely foreign to such an idea.
Draco snorted, and Ron went the colour of a tomato.
"No." Draco finally spoke.
"Shut it." Draco muttered irritably, looking away. "If I'd known you'd hold that stupid Vow over my head this much, I'd have asked Granger to do it for me."
Draco continued to busy himself, although he had no idea what he was really doing. "I have no idea what you're talking about. You need an appointment with the Janus Thickey-"
"Christ." He muttered. "Can't you just tell me everything after? Tell all of us, actually. Just the important parts."
Draco's ears perked up, but he stayed staring down at his bowl. He didn't quite see it, but he felt the fleeting glance of Sirius' gaze on him. Mrs. Weasley, however, decided to sit down on Harry's other side and start mumbling about the state of his clothing, fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. Harry seemed to melt away from her. Tonk's words faded away as Molly fussed, to Draco's disappointment.
"Right. Well, say theoretically then, you kept my secret of my involvement in your affairs."
Harry shuffled in place for a moment. "I should… probably go."
"He was…skeptical at first." And Draco huffed sarcastically. "But after I told him about the Gillyweed and the task, he believed me a bit more."
that same little part inside his mind from the day before whispered in his mind,
"But you actually…reciprocate." Ronald went on, "Weird."
“One thing I can’t recall,” Blaise ignored his plight, “is whether I actually provided this aforementioned postal address.”
He walked away as fast as he could, catching up to Blaise who had already went ahead. As he'd just stepped on the train, he heard a loud barking of a dog that sent his heart flying.
"Draco?" Harry croaked, his voice rough from misuse.  The boy sounded weak. Maybe his potions wore off and he was in pain. He needed to call Madam Pomfrey…
"Merlin, we've been here a while." He said, astonished. Harry checked his watch too, and saw they were in the early hours of the morning. He cursed himself. It was a
ask.” Draco said sincerely. He had his hands on his lap timidly, sat on the edge of the chair as he couldn’t seem to get his body to relax. “I’m sorry if I’m overstepping-”
And yet, he smiled. Something cruel and unforgiving.
"Er.." Harry mumbled, not knowing where to start. He looked back at Ron, whom was still involved in his game.
"Right. Oh, well…that's good."
"Hm?" Draco felt all his focus on their hands, touching over Buckbeak's coat. "Fly?"
"Fine. Whatever." Harry mumbled noncommittally.
Without a word, acting as if nothing at all had just transpired, he retracted his hand with the same smile. “Mustn't start any rumours.” he said lowly, leaning in as if sharing a secret with the woman.
Harry walked to where the rest of the champions were gathered, all being hugged and gushed over by their families. Amos Diggory nodded at him briefly as he spoke to Cedric, a comforting hand on his son's shoulder.
"Right, thank you, Mum. Can we leave soon?" Draco said loudly, glancing at the room his father had gone in to. "We might miss the train, you know! Wouldn't that be terrible-"
Malfoy was smiling down at his parchment, writing down notes from the lesson. He didn't seem to be aware people were now staring at him or that he had laughed out loud at all. His partner nudged him roughly and he looked up quickly, his smile disappearing when he saw Harry.
Harry didn't reply to that, deciding to keep any remarks to himself in case probing into it agitated Draco even more.
“Good evening, Professor.”
He mouthed at Draco, and the boy just nodded curtly, but his eyes were pitying.
“At least you’re done with Umbridge, right?” Ron said. “No more of that bloody punishment. D’you think she’s doing it to others, too?”
"Hello." He said warily as he walked up, then laid eyes on Remus, his face going pale. "Oh, erm. Professor Lupin! What are you…"
chanted inside his head over and over, and he couldn't seem to get a grasp on it.
“Department of Magical...whatever.” Harry flapped his hand vaguely.
"Harry?" Malfoy asked in that strange voice Harry could never get used to. He didn't reply. Didn't trust himself to. He settled for a slight shake of his head and hoped Malfoy might by some chance take the hint and
“I’m not asking you to act, Draco.” Dumbledore sighed.
"The only inkling of anything I got was from you! Not even my own friends-"
“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Harry, peering at his friend.
“My mum and dad don’t mind. Said as long as I’m happy, they’re happy.”
“You’re not just going to stand out here, then, are you?” Harry retorted.
presentable enough to stand next to me." Malfoy said, looking bored as if he hadn't just pointed a wand at Harry's
thank you reading! <3
"Uh, yes."
"But at least he's getting a hearing, right?" Ron said, "Just explain what happened to them, Harry. They can't expel you for defending yourself! Hey, we'll even get Dad to help you somehow."
"That doesn't mean," Draco said, voice low but like a knife's edge, "That you can have a go at your friends like that. Did you know how loud you were? Did you bother to look at Granger's face? She looked so bloody
Professor Moody.
Harry swore and marched off without a second glance, face burning and fists aching from how tight he was holding them. Fuck the Lake. Fuck the Triwizard Tournament. Fuck Draco Malfoy.
thank you for reading !
, Blaise?" Draco snapped loudly, finally garnering the two conspirator's attention. "What on earth are you two on about?"
"I mean…" Harry said. "Yeah, I guess. I just want to be involved and know what's happening, to be honest."
“And Professor Umbridge...she was quite angry, was she?”
"I am afraid Harry stated that your father was among the few returning followers of Lord Voldemort." Dumbledore said, no hint of sympathy in his voice.
Potter chuckled, still standing next to him and observing the mingling crowd. Some people were sat at tables and eating the copious amounts of food the elves had cooked. Other's were dancing with their dates, little clusters of people around the floor wrapped up in each other. Draco's stomach churned, but he didn't feel hungry at all.
"Who was your bonder?" She asked.
Harry tried to act naturally but knew he was failing. He plastered a hopefully genuine smile on his face.
"Both of you need to mind your bloody - Pansy, for Merlin's sake, the root of Asphodel is not
if anyone finds out. Do you understand?"
"No way." Ronald argued, "His mum's fairly pretty, innit?"
"Draco." Blaise rushed, looking worried and cautious, "It's not your job-"
He looked like a completely different person to the one he knew for the past three years. It's almost like the boy grew up in to someone else, and it made Harry feel very strange.
Soon, more of the Weasley's begun to fill the room. Ronald and Hermione walked in together, Ronald's eyes narrowing when he saw Draco and Harry already there. Draco quirked an eyebrow at him, and the boy glared back before taking a seat at the table. Draco gave a polite nod to Hermione, and the girl smiled back with something that seemed like mutual understanding between them as she sat next to Ronald.
"Expel- Harry, what -"
." He said haughtily. Malfoy's shoulders drooped slightly at that, his gleeful mirth now slightly weaker than before. Harry took pleasure in seeing the other boy's confusion. He didn't necessarily know where he was going with this, but the small thrill at fighting with Malfoy gave him the possibility of a small victory in a long time. He decided in that moment that rendering the normally articulate Slytherin almost speechless was a step from winning the argument all together. All he needed to do was press it further.
he reminded himself like every night.
"I'm glad I'm alive, too, Severus." He crossed his arms over his chest, sitting up over his tray of food brought in earlier through a spontaneous pop from thin air.
"I didn't even know till a few years ago. His name was blasted off the family tree a long time ago after he left his home."
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron interrupted, pointing to a badge on her chest. Harry had forgotten the boy was even there.
"Hm?"
There was a pause of silence in the room for a moment, punctuated only by the constant, pathetic ticking of a clock on the wall.
“What’s he after apart from followers?” Harry asked swiftly.
"Nothing! Ron thinks I acted like a bloody Slytherin that evening, baiting Malfoy like that." Harry said hotly. He scowled and Ron who shifted in his seat uncomfortably. Hermione stared at Harry curiously, and he could tell she was thinking very critically about something. Harry flushed and looked down at his shoes away from them.
Then to Draco's horror, Snape told him about the ritual. The bone of the father, unwillingly taken. The flesh of the servant, willingly given, and the blood of the enemy, forcibly taken.
"Me? What do you mean, Hermione?"
Soon enough, the Polyjuice wore off, and Barty Crouch Jr. was revealed, having never been Alastor Moody at all. Harry barely listened, his mind buzzing with nothing and everything all at once.
"He was. It was the first time he looked…like a human being. He was scared. I almost didn't recognise him."
" Rang out in his head.
"I'm surprised, Potter." He said as he came back from the spin, "You haven't fallen on your arse yet." He didn't even look like he had broken a sweat, save for a few strands of hair falling over his forehead from being gelled back.
Harry stood at a window on the wall opposite the door, looking how with his hands stuffed in his pockets. Hearing Draco step in and close the door, he looked over his eyebrows furrowed and the same pissed off expression he'd had earlier.
"I'm not-" Harry turned around, his blood heating up with anger. "Just leave me alone. I don't want to talk."
Harry threw his arms in the air, ready to admit defeat,
"I don't know anymore." Was all he answered. Something flashed over Potter's face, but it was so fleeting Draco was unsure if it actually happened. The relieved look in eyes didn't come back, however. He looked at Draco, eyes simmering with the same heat he always saw in them. Because it's how Potter only ever looked at him.
“Yes?” she asked, almost smug.
He just turned the last corner leading to Binns’ class before colliding with someone else.
She gasped, as if cooing over a baby’s first words. “My! How polite! Just like when you were a little one. Such a little
"You will write, won't you, Harry?" Hermione asked next to him as the three walked.
He knew it was a stupid question. Hell, they were standing in the bloody classroom for it, but he figured that the more stupid she thought he was, then the better.
I slowly crept closer, keeping my wand ready. I took a last steady breath and took off, running towards it as I barked, "Sectumsempra!!!"
"For now, I need my breakfast," he said.
Author’s notes: This tale focus on the darker aspect of life, such as blood, flesh, temptation, betrayal, hatred, and revenge along with it is love and hope. You have been warned!
"Then what, Hermione?" I asked as I climbed over a rock.
"Help me?" I tripped over my feet as he came near me. "HOW?"
"Hmm" I hummed to agree but I still felt disappointed about something. Maybe the lack of trust in me that they are showing or my inability to have the information that I need, desperately. I return to my packing as I completely ignored Remus. I know it was childish but I felt off and I don't want to be as understanding as I should be. Remus sensing my mood left the room, quietly.
Mrs. Weasley walked up to them.  "Can you stop being childish, Sir? Step away as far as you can. This becoming unpleasant since you have arrived."
Worse, she knows!
As soon as, Malfoy uttered those words to Harry, my best friend; who was so good, caring, and one of my important people in the world and who have suffered from alienation, fear, and rejection - I cried as I look at the scene in front. No matter how disgusting or disturbing it might look from the other people's perspective but for me, it is something warm and a hopeful scene unfold in front.
"How do you know?" I asked, harshly.
"Granger, this is my decision and I need time to think. Please do respect my opinion and my rights even though Slytherins and Gryffindors are not in good terms with each other," he said in a mature manner.
I got startled since I was too preoccupied with my thoughts. "Huh?"
“Wow. Moine is right. That outfit looks good on you, Harry.” Malfoy's gaze held appreciation as he turns off the stove and walks towards me.
So here I am again sitting on my bed, staring at the ceiling. I was once again back to level zero.
“Oh.” My eyes widen as I, seriously have forgotten my current situation. I can’t eat normal food, not anymore. I sadly put down my food unto the plate before me.
The silence that was between us except for the small tinkering sound of Tiffany, then finally, Malfoy let out a single sigh.
That knowledge seems had clogged inside my brain before I could process it. That when Hermione asked her, I barely heard it. "Supposed to be?"
“Eight-legged tiger.” He answered, plain and simple.
"A What?" I asked Hermione.
Then, Draco began to struggle from my embrace as he turns his face away from my kiss, gasping for air.
Unconcerned by our reaction, Draco continued. "Could you let go of Father's insult, Uncle Sirius, just for the day? He isn't in the best condition these days. I would much appreciate it."
Malfoy took out a bag and open it, taking something out from it then he suddenly threw it out the air - tiny beads and as the light reflected on them, it shines red in color. Then the Darah Nagas came taking one bead at a time, that when it registers in me - that was their food. I tried sniffing and I did smell it - the faint fragrance of blood.
"I have brought them," Malfoy said as he took out a large crystal bottle from his bag. Inside the bottle were tiny red butterflies that were fluttering around inside the bottle. It seems to be the bottle itself held a large magic space to accommodate a small garden and 25 butterflies within it. Magic is so amazing!
I stared at her, unbelievingly as soon as she said those words."What do you mean by 'you're on the right track'? And why are you here?"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
“My. My. Hermione, I won’t even suggest it. If, I didn’t know how to. To answer your question. Yes, I do know-how and to answer the question: where. We’ll just have to find them, right?!”
I scrambled up from where I lay, awaken from my slumber. Eyes wide open as I scan my unfamiliar surroundings. Flinching from the brightness of the light of the sun from windows, I found out that I was in a seemingly wide space room, ivory cream-colored furniture, slightly opened high glass windows covering the entire one side of the room, showing the patio and white semi- see thru curtains as they dance from the wind that passes by. No portrays were hanged in the room to help me identify who was the owner of the said room.
I remember the entrance to the place was really creepy not because of the features but because of the aura around.
"With what?" She asked back as she looks down at the Flitter bloom that we were relocating to another pot and adding fertilizer.
I look over the Gryffindor's sit and saw Hermione there. She had that distressed expression but a determined spark in her eyes as she was trying to ensure me. Even though, she had hesitated to allow me to compete in the Quidditch match in which I still stubbornly push forward because I didn't want anyone noticing my situation especially if the seeker of Gryffindor just back out of the game at a last-minute before starting without any excuse. I relax a bit, knowing that she was there to support me, even after what she saw.
The three of us had no choices but to run into the dark tunnel and as we enter in our absolute dismay and horror at the end of the dark, the wide and concave tunnel is a dead-end.
"Harry?" Remus peered at my face as I have seemed to have spaced out on him while standing.
"What the heck are talking about, Malfoy," I said agitated by his words.
I turn to face Hermione with my most innocent look. "Teasing? I was just asking her about what did she mean with her comment."
"If all of you would tell your respective professor of what had happened. Then both your Gryffindor's seeker and Ravenclaw's beater will be disqualified for all seasons, which something you all wouldn't like right?" Malfoy smirked as he explained to all of us. "A thing that would make my Slytherin team happy since you all will be losing a vital player for the next following games."
Sighing deeply, he slowly turned to face me. "Aren't you going to talk to the headmaster as well? Then instead, fighting over who will see the Headmaster first, why won't we all go together." He said slowly like was explaining something to a two years old child.
"We were to discuss an important matter with the Headmaster. But I guess it could wait." I said, unsure as I glance back and forth from her to Malfoy.
A popping sound of apparition echoed through-out the hall as Tiffany appeared carrying what appears to be another letter and dutifully giving it to Draco, who accepted with thanks.
Cold but beautiful that was the first thing that has entered my mind as I have seen the speaker. Draco Malfoy. Again, he was not wearing his usual snarling face instead of a calm and neutral one. His free-flowing hair that had to seem to have turned more silver in color, eyes that house the shade of ocean grey-blue, his smooth and soft cornered face along with his near statue-like posture. A beauty to behold. Not that I will tell him that!
"Hmm" was all Mr. Weasley could say as he disapparated. As he vanished, Hermione and Ginny entered the kitchen, well dress and awake.
"These butterflies are called Hemotropic butterflies or Darah Naga, which means Blood Dragon. As you can see, they are crimson in color." Malfoy pointed out. "They originally came from Zevil Island and got transported here by illegal catchers, thus now they are most likely can be seen at the heart of the Forbidden forest. Their main food is blood."
"Boy" Sirius was panting from abrupt stopping his fist. "Get out of the way."
As the day progress, afternoon classes are to start - so is Divination. Both of us, I and Ron went back to our dormitory to fetch our books and charts - with an exception of Hermione since she has Ancient Runes instead of Divination. With copies of Unfogging the Future in both of our hands, we went down to the common room and thru the portrait. Walking towards the tower, climbing the long winding stairs - reaching the top level, Ron halted as he was trying to catch his breath.
I'm going insane!
A hundred horseless carriages stood waiting outside the station. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reached for one and as they open the door of the carriage, somebody was already there. It was Luna Lovegood.
"Happy?" I asked a spurt of blood that came out of my mouth.
Honestly, I think I am still shaking like an infant, never have I felt this terrified. I was sweating like a pig and there was an awful feeling within the pit of my stomach.
"Maybe next time," I said. Foolishly, listening to her. I am becoming crazy.
"Yeah" I answered weakly.
"Moine" I called out my favorite nickname for her.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I looked at them. Remus, brown ruffled hair, is still tall, lanky, and a bit slouching but seems healthy enough compared to the last time we have seen each other. As for Sirius, black nape length hair, had more muscle in him as I noticed as I had hugged him earlier then Remus but still supporting that dark eye bags.
My head tells me to be cautious but I know within me- my guts tell me to trust him. I wasn't so sure anymore of anything.
Then a burst of laughter came from behind. Charlie and Bill, both who had just arrived with Remus, were seated on the chairs of the diner table. They have those teasing smiles on their faces. Bill or should I say, William Weasley, is the oldest among the Weasley children, is a curse breaker in Gringotts in Egypt. He looked more like a singer of a rock band instead of an office guy and Charles Weasley, known as Charlie, works with Dragons in Romania, had a bulky body, the one you usually see as an average bouncer.
"With Malfoy's action," I said. "It's bugging me so much."
Sobbing and growling as I snap my jaws, as I force my body to twist against the ropes, breaking my skin and making me bleed. Raking my claws against the tree as they got tore.
There was a margin of silence with a solemn aura engulfs us before Hermione spoke again. "But not all was a lost cause. At least, you have Draco to focus on."
"Why?" I faced Ron as he also hinders me from calling out again.
Diagon alley was lively as ever. There were shops for anything and everything. Honest shopkeepers bellowed down the streets. The chortle of children at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. Bustling of people as they hurriedly passed by. Hoots of owls and snarls of cats are heard as we passed by Eeylops Owl Emporium and Magical Menagerie. The thick smell of everything mixed through the air which I usually find myself nauseated but at the same time made me feel excited and giddy like a child.
Looking down at the grass near my feet, avoiding Malfoy inquiring eyes. "I can't eat. Everything that I eat is tasteless in my mouth except when..."
'Really, the tease!'
Just as fast as he came, he left, immediately.
After a minute, Ron suddenly guffawed. "Malfoy are you hiding from your girlfriend? I didn't know your such a coward that you need to hide from a girl."
Upon reaching the living room, Draco was sitting down on one of the couches as he seems to have a tea at hand while he was staring at the flicker of the flames at his fireplace along with the creaking of the wood that snaps under the fire.
"Might you, Draco. That was quite, an extreme way to get revenge on someone," Hermione scowled at Draco as she was reminded of that scene at Professor Dumbledore's office.
Malfoy released his hold and went up to Parkinson. "It's none of your business, Pansy." Then he walked past her and continue towards the hallway. Parkinson runs after him, calling out to wait for her.
I look up at the mirror, to see the damage. What I saw had me in a fit of panic and made my heart stop. It was the face of a monster, my face - in the mirror mocked my sanity.
"Except when what?" Malfoy asked as he moved closer to me.
Then we heard a cough. As slowly our lips connect was as fast we separated.  At the door, leaned against the door frame were the twins Fred and George with evil smirks that promise torture for both of us.
"Hmm...good." Draco opens a cupboard and started pulling out some white porcelain plates, silver forks, spoons, and some glass cups then placing them on the table. "Oy, the two of you, are you not going to help?" He asked as he raised his head, looking over to us.
Professor McGonagall turns to us. "Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, and Ms. Granger will you be needing me in this discussion?"
And it's the only thing I could is to hope.
"Maybe, because I have been exercising a lot during the summer." I lied through my teeth.

Roaring in pain, the beast pawed on its eyes as the spell has injured it - distracting it. Ron, Hermione, and I scrambled for the next tunnel to our left, squeezing ourselves in the small space as the size of a grown man, surely this time the said creature wouldn't able to follow us.
I already know Hermione's opinion on Ginny's reaction towards me when I turned into this creature in front of them but I could understand Ginny's shock and terror because I do fear the creature that I have become.
Then Professor McGonagall unrolls a large scroll of parchment and began. "When I call your name, you will sit on this chair" She pointed to the four-legged chair in front of her then continued. "I will place the hat on your head and the hat will announce your House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table."
"Yes, you are." He said suddenly that I snapped my attention to him. "YOU. ARE. A. BITCH!" He gnarls at her.
"Stop that, Malfoy," Hermione said as she looks at Malfoy.
"EXPERIMENT?!" I nearly choked on my soup with confusion and disbelief.
It has been two days since my last encounter with Malfoy. But I still haven't come in terms of asking help from my rival or should I call him ex-rival?
"Harry." Hermione gently called out to me.
"Close your mouth, Granger! It's very unladylike," he grumbled as he saw my face. "Here -" He places the tray on the bed beside me."- eat and take this-" He spoke as he drops a vial at my lap. "Don't worry it's not poison. It is Pain relief potion."
Ron jumped out from his sit, making an angry noise, and marched towards Ginny. Ginny did likewise. They both started to bickering with each other, steaming with so much anger. I rolled my eyes at their antics.
"Anyway, what's their use? To beautify you!" Seamus said as he, Neville, and Dean were standing near us. "I can't think of anything that could make you bring any creatures for Professor Hagrid but for you brag it about."
'Of course, Harry dear. Didn't they tell you? Life is not fair.' A familiar feminine voice spoke, suddenly.
Sighing, Malfoy slowly turned away from us and headed the hallways, which leads to the Potion class without speaking a word, behind him was his usual groupie. Suddenly, Michael muffled sounds of anger broke my daze. My body made a rash decision as I called out for Malfoy's name.
"Ginny!" Michael gasped as he looks so surprised to see her there. I feel a suddenly prickly sensation in my chest. The way his face changed and his voice waiver as soon as Ginny appeared. It made me irritated and then I realized at that moment what his problem towards me was all about.
"Ah, wait," Malfoy called after I was out of the woods and I was walking towards the castle.
Draco took several gulps of air before continuing. "And Ms. Vane did not even stop from that. This morning, she went too far. She steals something from me, that had once belonged to my brother."
"Yes, he is." Malfoy muttered as he took another sip of his tea."Just malnourished."
"For this matter, I will be the one to send the result and explanation regarding the situation to the Malfoy's family." Professor Snape spoke after a while.
I remember.
"Eat more!" Ginny pushes a bowl of chicken legs towards me.
“Hmm… Somebody woke up at the good side of the bed, today.” A voice uttered from the stove, stirring at what was supposed to be a pot of soup, as he looks up when I entered.
I laughed as the scene unfolded in front of me. The adults smiled as if hearing my chuckle assured them. With so much energy, Sirius jogged beside me and swing his arm over my shoulder. "It's nice to see you being so well"
I heard her. Her voice had a tinge of concern as her eyes wandered over my face. Then my mind raced. Should I tell her or should I hide it? Hermione is a friend of mine, someone I could trust with all of my life. But I felt a pang of strong guilt within me. I have been giving both of my best friends troubles ever since we have all met. Will, I bring yet again another problem?
Giggling at my embarrassment, Hermione returns to her breakfast with a much more relax gesture as she was happy for me. Well, she always cared for me, that I am grateful for her. She then was in deep thought, fueled by my reaction to the said experiment that was ongoing, which is my food intake.
Trying to recover, Michael lookup. "I-I going to tell Professor Flitwick this. So you all will be disqualified."
"No," I said, with a bitter tone to it. "They seem to end our relationship with just this..." I pointed myself as I was sure my features were already changing. My eyes were still green but a red hue appeared in the middle of my iris seems to remain, skin paled but unlike Draco's, mine was more of a greyish hint that looks so unhealthy, my height shot up which I enjoyed as a side effect of my transformation but my ears and teeth have lengthened and my nails stay sharp even if I cut them every day. "But who I am kidding. Why would they remain with me when I am becoming a horrible monster. As for Sirius and Remus, I'll talk with them when the time comes."
"Yes, please," I answered, gently.
"Malfoy, this is?" Hermione look up and turned to Malfoy with an angry expression.

"Ah..., that was fun." He snickered at me. "Right, Tiffany?" He asked his elf as he turns his cup towards it and Tiffany dutifully refills the cup. "Yes, Master. Young miss Granger is funny." It said happily as it giggled, innocently. But I won't be fooled by that naive act and face.
"What? I'm not going to go out there to be chased by that monster." Ron shouted at me while his eyes glared. "Are you crazy?!"
"That's far enough." Blaise chuckled, "You're also not necessarily very welcoming, either."
Umbridge, however, did not flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face. “Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”
"Why?"
His mother nodded acceptingly, and he took that as a que to allowed to leave.
“Think of it this way,” Blaise interjected, “If it was something Potter related and Draco hadn’t noticed, did it really happen?”
The letter was almost a complete copycat of the words Draco had said to him the day before.
“Alright. Let’s go.” Draco peered out of the Portkey station, unsurprisingly finding the atrium empty as it was far past the morning work rush hour. Confident they wouldn’t run into anyone unsavoury, he led the both of them towards the elevators hurriedly.
“Er, yeah.” Harry said uncertainly.
"I think your rook is open, mate." Harry whispered in Ron's ear.
"Yeah." Draco replied absentmindedly. Why couldn't he figure it out? Everything inside him screamed
"Oh, save me the pity!" Draco scoffed, "You know that isn't true. I can't even believe you could say that about
"You'd better thank your family constellations for that. You'd be more careful about calling women derogatory names if I was." She said, coming to sit down next to Draco and Blaise doing the same.
Draco passed his next reply during Care of Magical Creatures, a class he still hated not just because of Hagrid but because he genuinely hated those blasted Blast-ended-skrewts.
“Your father’s actions are out of your control. Should Umbridge truly choose to pursue you as a means to something, then we can start to plan our options. For now, however, it’s a meaningless endeavour. We’ll sit on the information for the time being and act when things play out some more.”
Draco waved him off with a hand, “That woman’s involved in anything she smells funny. My father must have caught her attention with the requests for these classified files.”
Harry clicked his tongue. He had been expecting it, but he didn't believe it would actually
i know i said i was back last time, but i then proceeded to run in to writers block right after! it's also a sprinkle of shitty mental health which i'm still trying to get over. this chapter was originally way longer, but it ran TOO long so i've just split it up since editing it all would just take another week at least.
"That's right." His father stood and walked to the window of his office with his hands clasped behind his back. Draco took the opportunity of his father's back turned to him to wipe his forehead of the sheen of sweat that had collected there. "And you know our blood must serve?"
"Mm. Now what's this about a Dementor?"
"Yes, mother." He said with a curt nod. Her gaze on him didn't falter, and neither did her grip on his arm. He made no move to leave it, and they stood there for a moment in silence, as if waiting for the other to say something.
“Sorry.” Harry chuckled, not sounding very sorry at all. He had his arms crossed over his chest, hands tucked underneath each other casually. “Sending something?”
"I still don't like him, Harry. I don't know if I'd ever even willingly spend time with him like you do."
"Mrs. Weasley…I really-" But the woman was already adding more to his plate. Draco glared at Harry again, before saying sweetly, "You finished, Harry?"
"I think it is." Harry said defiantly. He'd trusted Draco's decision to take the Vow. For whatever reason, the boy seemed to need that safety net to fall in to in order to work for their side, so Harry had obliged him. He didn't feel scared about Draco dying from it because they'd phrased the clauses in such a way that meant he wouldn't have to reveal information or take action against the Order unless under threat of harm or death. Unless Draco really did turn against them, he'd be fine. As long as Harry didn't directly ask for specific information, inciting the vow, Draco wouldn't have to answer, either. It explained why Dumbledore wouldn't have to know about the Vow unless it was explicitly asked after. Harry would never force the Vow on Draco, either, unless absolutely necessary, but he didn't even think it would ever even get to that point, so he didn't need to worry.
"Then why are you here?" Draco said harshly.
"But- How-?" Draco sputtered, his vision going blurry and his world crumbling around him.
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled, hands pressed against each other in front of him ponderously. “I’m sure that within the next few weeks, a few changes will be attempted to have been made within Hogwarts.”
"Are you sure? You know that he was…" He trailed off knowingly.
Draco was silent for a few moments, thinking, before Harry saw him nod unconvincingly, dispelling the
Harry glanced at Weasley behind him, shaking his head with a small smile. "So dramatic." He sighed, then swung the door open.
Harry looked back at the two, still bickering, but not borderline killing each other.
"I am perfectly normal all the time!" Harry crossed his arms hotly. "And I don't
, how he wanted to watch Potter crash and burn at the Ball. He took Potter's hand and shook it with raging fervor, and went on to have his life changed in one night.
"Right." Harry said, suddenly feeling shy and self-conscious, "Well I'm also sorry that you had to…you know, find out about your father like this. It must be awful after looking up to him so much."
"It's at least three centimeters, Potter. Don't be childish."
be a Malfoy, Blaise!” he whispered joyously, to which he got in return a blank stare.
Potter shuffled behind him, but didn't move away.
Harry laughed, "Yeah, I guess. So I told him what his father had done, and he was…surprised to say the least."
"It's not about sides, Harry." said Remus, "It's always going to be about politics, and the Ministry wants nothing to do with talk of Voldemort coming back after nearly fourteen years of peace. It's easier for Fudge to make out Dumbledore as some sort of troublemaker and you off-your-rockers than deal with the idea of Voldemort's return."
"Fuck you! What the fuck is Gillyweed?"

"Right." Malfoy all but snapped. "For calling Granger a mudblood and the Weasel-"
He turned to Ron, “What d’we have today?”
“I see.” Blaise said, although he didn’t sound very convinced. He snapped his book closed and sighed, “Well, what’s this you’re stealing then.”
"How are you, boy." His father finally said, his overly adorned fingers drumming on the arm of his own chair.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, making himself look as sheepish and mysterious as possible. “Oh, I’m sure you know….Best not to say such things here, hm?”
"Yeah. Last night- this morning. I fought it off, but I had to use my wand. My uncle kicked me out, so I left, and I got an Owl saying I was expelled from Hogwarts. My neighbour found me eventually - she knows about me. She knew the whole time. She's a squib. Apparently some guy who was meant to be watching me left." Draco saw his shoulder's hunching and his hands clenching beside him in anger. "They had people
He felt Ron’s hard gaze on the side of his face and didn’t have the heart to look him back in the eyes. Ron sighed resignedly at his hesitance, and they continued the walk back in silence.
. “That bad?”
“Besides that he’s my godfather?” Harry asked rhetorically. “Just checking in.”
Draco looked up.
"Right." She said, narrowing her eyes at them. "Lads your age up this early isn't a normal occurrence."
, Draco. I was bound to you from the moment I found you crying about Potter in the bathrooms during first year."
"What did you say?" Potter said next to him. It sounded almost accusing, and Draco wondered what on earth he could have said that could have offended the boy. He looked at Potter, who quite honestly looked no better than the day before.
"Weirdo." Harry muttered, shaking his head as well.
Draco felt his face heat, and he looked away. "Welcome." He gulped. "Mind if I ask you something, too?"
"Exactly why he doesn't talk about it! Apparently cut ties with his son during the First War when he was convicted. Even testified against him in the Wizengamot."
"He's closest to me, so he's my squid." He said petulantly.
"-FOUR WEEKS I'VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON -"
“Are you even sure it exists?”
"Well it doesn't look bad. That's one good thing to ever come out of his wand, then." She said appraisingly, both of them ignoring Ron snorting in to his hand again.
“Like you hissing and leaning in all secretly like that isn’t making it worse?” Pansy snickered.
“I know, Ron.” Harry sighed, sipping the smooth foam that collected on top of the butterbeer. “I just want to keep it lowkey for now, alright?”
"Shut it." Harry aimed a foot in the direction of Draco's legs, and was pleased to find they hit some sort of mark.
"Er…My right." He stammered, then adding hurriedly as his father yanked the arm holding his wand - the left - and studied it, "But sometimes I use my left - if I get tired."
"Don't get used to this." Draco said back, "Ever."
names."
“What’s got you so tired then, Ron?” Hermione turned to the boy curiously, peering suspiciously. “Where were you last night anyway?”
had something more to say. He tapped his fingers on his arm impatiently where they were crossed, and Draco luckily noticed. "Merlin." Draco pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh. "I just wanted to ask if you'll be okay." He said quickly.
"Your hand." Draco hissed back. "Why is it so bloody
Blaise snorted lightly. “Alright, then. What’s the verdict on the changelings this year?”
Harry nodded, "I'll do it now. I'll talk to Draco tomorrow once he's calmed down."
A flare of indignation rose in Draco. “We don’t need much practice anyway, so you needn’t worry about us.”
"I…" Draco started, his mouth dry. The man caught his gaze and raised an eyebrow, Eye beginning to spin faster.
"You tell it, Potter. But what's it got to do with…"
It wasn't his fault. Draco had just dangled the possible answer he'd been looking for for weeks right in front of his face. Bloody git. Harry'd never felt more grateful for the boy in his life.
"Wow." Harry said, feeling slightly left out. "Two of my friends are pref-"
Harry swore frustratedly, getting up to sit and face Draco again, “Well we can’t have everything, can we? First, you want to stop Umbridge from going after your father, but you also want your father to not progress in whatever
“I said something about the Ministry?”
“What did you do?”
"You're worried!" Ronald exclaimed gleefully.
"Dudley!" Vernon shouted, rushing to his son's side.
“And so who overlooks Level Two?” Blaise interjected, keeping the subject on track. The small, untraceable amount of Veritaserum Draco had used would only last so long. “Surely it’s not just left to its own devices.”
spell, and just after coming back from a physical dodge he didn't have time to counter it. He lost the grip on his wand and it slipped from his grasp. Reflexively, just as if trying to catch the snitch, he other hand shot out to catch it just in time to shout, "
"What a dump." Harry said dully. "They got
They entered the kitchen together, before Harry exclaimed, "Sirius!" And ran and jumped in to the man's arms. Sirius wrapped his arms around Harry, and Draco stood awkwardly for a few moments. He looked away to scan the room.
Maybe deep down he really had missed Hogwarts. It just certainly wasn’t shaping up to be an easy year on him, however.
"Yeah." Harry said slowly, rising up to sit but still looking at him. "Look, I need you to do something."
"I'd say so, yes."
"Should I conjure you a mirror? Because I need you to see how stupid you look, clear as day in front of you, just like I do!" Blaise yelled at a now withering Theodore. Draco sat up smugly, temporarily forgetting about his wand and internally relieved it wasn't him being absolutely
“Mr. Draco.” One of the little runts had tugged on his robes incessantly in one of the compartments during the train ride (had he really been that short?).
"I inherited it."
as they'd said their vows."
Draco perked up despite hearing the Weasel's name. "Everyone? Is Har-"
Just until this evening, then he was hopefully done.
The room erupted in the loud gasps of the students. Glancing next to him, he saw Blaise smiling slightly, eyes fixed on the scene. Draco gulped and looked back at Harry, knowing he was already too far gone to do any damage control, damn him.
“I read that levels Three to One are all restricted,” Draco explained. “They’re all kept elsewhere more securely. There’s so little information about whatever’s in Level One, though.”
"Good man." Ronald reached around and clapped him on the shoulder, putting a momentary weight on his bad knee and making him cry out. Harry's grip on him tightened as his weight fell back, and he was lowered in to his chair carefully.
And Harry allowed himself to smile in a way he never let anyone even close to him see. It felt sad, longing, painful. But it was also paired with a small feeling that he had done one right thing so far this year, and it was becoming friends with Draco Malfoy.
"Behave." He told the knee, and it only stung slightly in response when he moved it experimentally. That, he could work with. Heaving himself up with a small wince, he grabbed his wand off the nightstand and started towards the door.
"Hello yourself." Draco replied, coming to sit on the end of his bed wearing light pajamas provided by Madam Pomfrey.  He winced slightly as he hoisted himself up, and waved off Harry again when he tried to help him.
"SHIT, DOBBY! I'M LATE! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?" Harry shot up at lightening speed, sleep replaced by sheer adrenaline. He ran out the library despite Madam Pince's shrieking and sprinted all the way down the stairs and out the castle, vial clutched in hand.
“Wh- Oh, don’t call her that, will you? That’s disgusting!” Draco winced, looking back down to the desk to begin meticulously spelling away the streak of ink across his parchment.
Fred leaned in conspiringly, "Remember Fleur Delacour? She moved to work in the Ministry to
“And what about Level Two?” Blaise asked casually. “I must admit I’ve always been a tad bit curious…”
"What is
They spent the remaining duration of their tea in silence, and when he'd finished his cup, he excused himself to go to bed. Before he left, he stopped at the door and said off-handedly, "I apologise if you don't see me so much tomorrow. Father has said he wanted to see me in the mornings and afternoons."
And the view wasn't as bad as he thought it would be.
-o-o-
"Not with your
, Draco, things are changing. This thing with you and Potter is changing things."
"I'm glad you brought it up." Dumbledore's eyes twinkled in a way Draco didn't like. "The Ministry has most probably planted Dolores to spy on me. There are increasing suspicions about me, I'm sure you've heard?"
Draco woke up to the sounds of Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott having a raucous shouting match right by his bed, because where on earth would they have it otherwise?
Sirius, for the first time, smiled. "It's mine." He said with a malevolent grin on his face.
"Potter?"
"Then why are you here?" Draco asked insistently, "Why are you telling me all this? Don't you know who I am? Who
Harry chuckled, but it felt humourless.
Draco crossed his arms defensively, face going nearly unbearably hot. "I…didn't want it to bite me!"
Draco just sighed.
Draco showered hurriedly in utter fear of all the things Potter might do to damage his wand.
"…gets fitter every time I see him-" He heard Blaise mutter to Pansy as she nodded.
"Draco!" Harry called out, and the boy looked up from his conversation with Bill. "Come here."
"D'you want to fly with her?" Harry said softly, and Draco barely registered what he'd said as he stared at him.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.” Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubby fingered hands splayed on her desk. “You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead —”
"She is, if not anything, a complete bigot." Draco finished gravely.
“What good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry loudly, his hand still in the air.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes. Knowing Umbridge, this was another Ministry regulated precaution. No wonder they’d posted her as a Defense teacher of all things.
Potter laughed more strongly this time, "Exactly what I thought. That's why I haven't tried yet. He might just be trying to make a fool of me."
composure. He looked strange, at peace. Why didn't he look like that all the time? He guessed Malfoy was too busy being a prat to actually look like that.
"Mr. Malfoy, greetings once again."
"Well…you've stopped with all the Pureblood stuff, you know?" Blaise said sheepishly, "You don't bully muggleborns or anything like that anymore. You've gone quiet and its not gone unnoticed within our House."
“Plus, it’s stupid, but…”
"You've grown taller." His mother remarked beside him with a polite yet curt tone. He felt himself stiffen even more, and that just made his heart race even faster.
annoying sometimes." Potter finished, panting slightly. It reminded Draco of the night of the Ball when Potter gave him a similar kind of rant.
pls enjoy <3 i did my best lmao gl
"Yeah." Draco said, still in a slight daze. Harry reached out to his shoulder and squeezed once with a reassuring smile, as if Draco wasn't the one who needed to be doing the reassuring. He took back his hand and turned away to the direction of Gryffindor Tower with the same smile, leaving Draco standing in place, clutching the Invisibility Cloak to his chest.
. I'm his
"No!" Harry barked, "I won't let this madman kill anyone!"
"I will, Sir!" Draco waved back at the house as him and Snape distanced themselves, the house soon fading away along with Remus.
thank you for staying with me!
"Fine, Potter. Call this a Truce. I may have to warn you that I can control my actions but none of those in my house. If I'm around them I may have to either tolerate their actions or go along with them. I promise I will never encourage or initiate them. Is that alright.?
“You’re in trouble, Harry. Why should I have to see you get chewed out-”
Now he'd come this far from who his father was, and Harry Potter was his
Harry walked back to class, and passed through the day in a state between his thoughts and the lessons in front of him.
"Shut up, you horrible old hag, shut up!" He roared.
“Bugger.” Pansy sighed, twirling her quill in one hand with her empty parchment in front of her. “I almost even agreed with the Gryffin-idiots yesterday. Merlin, she’s
Just then, Harry saw a flash of white and spotted Malfoy walking up to them. Merlin, he had never been so relieved for the git to show his face anywhere near him. At least maybe he'll have an excuse to leave Ron and Hermione, he thought guiltily. Malfoy sauntered up next to Harry, seemingly amused by the argument happening in front of him. Harry watched the two go at it some more, not bothering to listen to what they said but just hoping they stopped it soon. He didn't like it when though fought like this, it made him feel out of breath and panicky, like he was about to be attacked.
," He iterated sharply, "Do you know how dangerous that sounds already? I was alright with it a few months ago because there
"Uh, okay." Draco crossed his arms a little
" Harry spat, clutching the bleeding cut on his arm and glaring at Moody. He registered Draco next to him, looking pale and worse for wear. He didn't even know how the boy got involved, but knowing Draco he must have done exactly that.
“Don’t have a go at me, now! Not afraid that the papers might see?” Seamus raised his hands defensively, stepping forward before he was stopped by an arm held out by Dean.
"He told me things…about my father." Draco studied the lines on his palms, deliberately trying not to look at Blaise's face. "Things I didn't know before."
“Stole it, duplicated a copy of it somehow. Either way, it definitely wasn’t intended for her.”
"You've not gone soft, you tosser. And it sounded like he genuinely believed me, so he's not mad."
" He screamed, a burst of white light forming a radiant stag from his wand. The Dementor immediately coiled away, and the stag fought it off with it's antlers. He watched it wane away with his arm outstretched in anticipation, blood thrumming with fear and the last remnants of declining despair the Dementor had brought with it.
Draco glared pointedly and Harry's eyes widened in realisation, glancing at the others before his face changed in to a scowl. "What?" he said aggressively. Ginevra next to him barely suppressed a knowing smirk.
The twins high-fived each other. "If we aren't already, he's got another thing coming." They both smiled brightly.
"Mhm." Remus nodded. "Figured you find us out soon enough, I guess."
"Draco." Harry said gently, not knowing if the boy would kill him if he woke him up. "Oi. Wake up, you tosser." But Draco didn't stir. Harry braced himself up on to his knees and cupped the sides of his mouth.
“Hm?” Draco’s eyes snapped to his from deep thought, then looked away quickly with a short shake of his head. “No, nothing. It’s just…” He ran a hand through his hair again, “Lots to think about, that’s all.”
"For someone to see Harry Potter walk in and Draco Malfoy walk out?" Harry asked skeptically, raising an eyebrow.
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. "
“Mum saw the articles about you and she...” Seamus trailed off, biting his words frustratedly. He sighed, as if trying to calm himself down, but his tone was still accusative when he spoke again. “Look...what did happen that night when...you know, when...with Cedric Diggory and all?”
"Draco." Harry whispered to him, and he leaned in. "Can I talk to Ron and Hermione for a bit?" He looked at him knowingly, and Draco understood that they needed to discuss things about the events of the past night. Draco nodded and patted Harry's knee, bumping on the tray of food and remembering it was there.
"Morning." Harry threw out casually with a lazy grin.
“Oh, erm. Sorry. Just thinking about the muggleborn. What was her name again?”
. I wish I knew what happened."
Harry laid back and threw an arm over his eyes. "You're insufferable." He said in a mocking tone that definitely
“Blimey, you gotta shit or something?” Ron exclaimed when he turned to see Harry’s already empty plate. Harry was in the midst of downing his Pumpkin juice, and just settled for shaking his head.
Harry sighed, “Nope.”
"Er…Anyways. Look at the bloody time! I need to get dressed. Out, vile woman!" He violently shooed Pansy out, reluctantly letting Blaise stay as he needed to get ready as well. He went and dug through his trunk desperately. He only had an hour and a half to get ready for Merlin's sake! Because of Potter he now had to go about picking new dress robes that wouldn't match Pansy's, all the while trying to ignore the awful feeling in his chest.
“If by asking, she means I’ve been wondering why you’ve been so quiet the past week, then yes. I’ve been asking about you.” Draco said sourly.
"Okay, Draco. Just calm down, alright?" Blaise said shakily. They stared at each other for a few moments before Blaise gestured to Draco's grip on his arm and he quickly let go.
"Yes, and I trust I was told the truth?" Draco said, wiping his face roughly to rid himself of the probably tear stains.
besides all that, thank you for staying with me! i still don't know how so many of you bother to read this crap, let alone actually like it. i appreciate it a lot!!!! <3
“Yeah.” Ron said, sounding slightly numb. “And you were right...about Alicia’s right side.”
“The password for this year is
“And that’s my queue to go to bed. See you there?”
"Relax, Potter. I just made you look
"How are you here? He shouldn't have visitors." The woman first said, and Draco cursed himself. He was supposed to be undercover!
"I have to grow at some point." He said curtly, hoping she might just brush off any train of thought of what she saw away. "It's been a while since you've seen me."
-o-o-
-o-o-
He needed to calm down. It was just his father. He couldn't know anything. Nobody knew about him and Harry. He was
"She's…er, fine. We're both good." He stammered, looking down at his parchment and not making eye contact, obviously not recovered from his encounter with Blaise earlier that year.
Alarm bells rang in Draco's head when he saw Harry stiffen beside him. "No, why?"
But Malfoy thrust Harry's head back up and he tottered precariously before finding balance.
"He's said before he wants to spy for m- our side." said Harry, "Go against his father and all that."
"Well...I'm just saying this because it's good if you lot know for yourselves. No use being kept in the dark, especially after all that's happened." The man shifted in his seat to lean forward. "Dumbledore is the sort of man to work behind scenes upon scenes. He's got a finger in all sorts of pies, if you will."
Hermione nodded, and he thought for a moment.
"Those are real?" Harry asked with wide eyes, imagining Draco in the place of sleeping beauty.
"Y…Yeah."
“Hm, that’s true.”
Draco scoffed, chest loosening internally. "You might just have a sense of humour, Potter. Well, after O.W.L.S this year, you'll need it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have detentions to dole out." He bowed grandiosely before turning to leave.
"Really?" Ron peaked through the fingers on his face.
He told him with his eyes, shooting a murderous glare at the boy.
"Huh?" Ron said eloquently, eyes wide.
Not long after, as Draco stood still in the same place unable to move, red sparks lit the air again. He watched them not knowing where his mind was, or even what he was seeing was even real anymore.
It didn't occur to him until two weeks in to the holidays that he and Draco, were in fact, still actually friends. A lot of things didn't occur to him these days, so it wasn't that surprising. Some nights after a nightmare, as he lay awake in the darkness, he might sometimes manage to convince himself that some things were true while some weren't. He might even switch facts around, like on one night when he'd woken up believing Ron was still mad at him for the tournament, but Cedric was still alive and well. It wasn't as if he had anyone or anything to talk some sense in to him, except for when he pulled back his shirt sleeve to see the jagged silver scar on his arm, and realised the latter wasn't true.
“I can imagine things are easily lost in there,” Blaise suggested sincerely. He was doing great, capturing the man’s attention completely. Draco was immensely glad he’d agreed to all this, and reminded himself to buy the boy a Butterbeer later.
"I need to know what side you're on." Harry said simply. Draco looked away and sighed deeply, opening his palms slightly and looking down at them.
"It would be a
"He's suffering!" Aunt Petunia cried.
food with- wait, I didn't attack you, you tosser-"
. I’ll do it so well, you won’t even see my magical signature!”
The pain was rapidly increasing and it threatened Harry’s balance, making him grip at the back of his chair behind him. The room spun slightly and dark spots danced before his eyes.
Draco blamed Dumbledore. Old senile fucker.
-o-o-
didn't hesitate to probe in to said assumptions, as if Draco were some sort of Pureblood spokesperson.
“Spiffing.” Draco smiled. “Not like you’d be able to get out without that sixth husband your mum had. Auror at the DMLE, innit? At least he was...”
Draco gulped, glaring at Harry angrily but never breaking eye-contact. "I will." He bit out, his grip on Harry's hand bordering on painful. A fourth flame ignited and wrapped their conjoined hands. Sirius muttered something under his breath again, then the wires were gone, and the hum of magic between their hands ceased.
"Around two hours."
Harry wolfed down his food during dinner, itching to know what had been on the letter from Umbridge’s desk.
Draco hummed in agreement, eyebrows furrowed in thought.
"Oh, bugger." Draco muttered, peering at Potter now relaxed and breathing evenly. "Potter?" No answer.
"You two." Mrs. Weasley snapped her fingers at the twins from where she had been hovered over the stove, unnoticed by Harry. "Food on the table, please."
Hermione's frown deepened. "You've got no shame." She scolded, turning to finish her dusting. "But this Umbridge woman means big trouble."
Draco watched the shift in everyone's faces except Harry's. He assumed Percy was just another one of the Weasley siblings. He was sure he's heard that name amongst the Prefects from his First Year.
Clearing his throat, Draco continued, "So it's settled, then. More shoddy meetings for me, while you relax and let me spoon feed you the information after. Am I correct?"
"Harry!" Draco barked, and all three heads whipped to him at once. Granger gasped and Ronald grimaced, while Harry stood looking over his shoulder with a feral, angry glint in his eyes that made him look more like the animal in the room than the other two.
"For the most part. Most of it was reports and things like that. Is this person here, is that object there. Nothing to do with me."
"It's fine." Blaise said flatly, "I've just never seen you so…"
He made his way to his bed and collapsed dramatically on to the top of it. Pansy and Blaise walked in and quickly made their way over when they saw Draco's genuinely worried face.
“I realised that having his...influence...going around wouldn’t be quite well for everyone just yet, don’t you think? Not this soon, what with the Ministry…”
Harry groaned, covering his face with his arms.
"So now what." Draco said.
in that bloodline of his. I'd say Veela, but you're not that pretty."
be suspicious of him, even if rightly so?”
“Bollocks!” Harry cried with outrage. “I saw him! I fought him!”
Pansy laughed even harder, doing that same wheezing snort she did whenever she found something especially funny.
"Of course I know what it is!" Hermione erupted, throwing her arms in to the air. "It's only one of the most popular, lethal and powerful magical bonds there is! It's borderline dark magic!"
Draco saw Sirius walk in over Harry's shoulder. The man stopped as soon as he saw the pair, and Draco silently nodded to Sirius to say he had control. The man looked between the two again, then miraculously nodded back and disappeared behind the curtain again.
Draco, for the life of him, barely held back from hitting Harry across the head. He well near hit himself, too, as he hadn't thought to actually let go of Harry's hand
The terror set in immediately.
Harry's irritation died quickly after that. He accredited it to the shock of Malfoy apologising to him so easily. It had been around two weeks since their truce started and he didn't think he could get used to it.
"Not funny." He murmured, but Harry thought otherwise.
Body shaking, he lowered his gaze to the floor and bowed deeper.
"Okay." Harry said quietly, missing the weight on the bed immediately. "I won't go anywhere."
"That long?" Draco gasped. "But Sirius…when he went to…"
"No, you dolt. Parvati ended up going with someone else, and it seemed like they really hit it off."
He took Draco's hand, palms rough against Draco's own and brought their hands up. Placing his hand over Draco's, he pressed them against the feathered coat of the top of Buckbeak's head. Draco flinched away at movement from the bird, but Harry kept their hands there steadily.
Draco's blood chilled, remembering that his father must have been trialed around the same time, only having gotten off scot-free.
pile, but his arm was stopped just before he could place it down. "Don't touch me." Draco sneered at Weasley's grip on his forearm.
Hermione stayed silent for a moment, quickly dodging a curse from a glowing dagger that was hidden inside a cloth and had slipped out as she'd picked it up. Unfazed, she wrapped up the dagger again and threw it in to the
He opened up the window and the owl flew in. Immediately, the letter unrolled itself and begun to speak.
Ron brought out a crumpled piece of paper with their schedule on it. “Charms, Transfigurations…” He looked up at Harry, “Care of Magical Creatures.”
McGonagall looked back at Draco, question in her eyes. He silently flashed her his prefect badge, then she nodded understandingly. Being a member of the Order, McGonagall was aware to some extent of Draco’s allegiances. He’d even seen her flit in and out of Grimmauld Place a few times over the summer and he vaguely remembered being told she’d been one of the few teachers on the scene back when fake-Moody tried to kill him and Harry.
"Maybe." Draco mumbled, closing his eyes and facing the ceiling his with head resting on the back of the chair.
walking through the hall as I was going back up to the Tower - Are you alright?”
“I beg your pardon?” Draco said, at the same time when Harry sputtered, “Wh- huh?”
Draco threw himself back on the ground, covering his face with his arm. "Merlin. Now I've got a fugitive knowing I've gone soft."
Thank you for all the lovely comments! They keep me going like you have no idea. I read all of them, but bear with me cause i'm a little too shy to respond. I hear you though!!
Harry felt a shift in the bed that indicated Ron was now sitting next to him. A hand placed itself on his back and more tears welled up in his eyes despite being shut. He started to cry silently, not knowing why. All he could feel were the remnants of his anger and frustration from earlier. He didn’t know where it’d come from. He didn’t even know why he was angry at Seamus-
. The girl was hell-bent on letting Ron and Harry 'be responsible for their own studying and education for once'. It wasn't particularly working, and Ron managed to porcure her notes successfully from time to time which Harry sidled in on.
Harry raised an eyebrow, but didn't comment on the Golden Boy remark. "Do they know about the Vow?"
Draco, who’s muscles had tensed without his knowledge throughout the course of the exchange, shot out of his chair at attention. He tried to keep his face blank, saying obediently, “Yes, Professor.”
Eyes keeping locked with the golden ones that of the Hippogriff, he grit his teeth and slightly bowed.
She looked down at his hand, breath hitching. Harry reflexively tried to pull away but her grip was too strong.
“Pretty much, yes.”
, Ron! I had to do something, say something that would catch him off guard. It's not like I expected him to bloody
“Shut up, for Merlin’s sake!” he snapped, the very route of thought making him immensely queasy. “Maybe she thinks I’m the next bloody Minister or something, I don’t fucking know.”
." Harry muttered under his breath.
"Late night?" Draco asked innocently. Potter looked at him guardedly before seeing Draco wasn't trying to be a prat for once. He grinned mischievously.
"Not, uh- no, not one-hundred. More about sixty eight percent." Draco said.
Draco swore. "Merlin, just
When Draco was done, he handed Harry a glass of water and watched the boy gulp it down.
Harry closed his eyes and let the sun rays seep in to him seemingly all the way to the bone. He felt remarkably more well rested than he had for the last few days. It wasn't enough sleep as he should have had, but it was better than nothing for the moment.
A gap in the seats.
Draco didn't move, keeping almost completely still as Ron went at him.
"What's upstairs?"
"Oh, what's this?" Malfoy said with a smirk, "Potter's defending his girlfriend! I always though the Weasel would go for her, to be quite honest - although who says he hasn't. Always knew all three of you were-"
Draco scoffed, "Not everything, surely."
"Dreadful?"
Harry glanced at the three other Weasley's who were engrossed in their own heated debate, so Harry looked back between his friends and sighed. "I know. I'm really sorry, guys." He muttered, head bowed. "I shouldn’t have had a go at you."
"I just wanted to come here before tomorrow."
“Are...are you done? Can you sit down now?” Ron asked carefully when he showed no signs of being any sicker. Harry felt hands around his upper arms, pulling him away from the sink and leading him to sit on the sill of the single green-tinted window in the bathroom. He briefly wondered where Myrtle was, as there had been no sign of her for the last two days.
"-Go to the ball with the coveted Triwizard Champion!"
"My mother died ten years ago and I've been…indisposed until recently, if you can imagine, to take in the house." Sirius said with a rueful smile.
"One of the highest in your grade?" His mother remarked questioningly.
If they continued to play hangman under their desk between them so Hermione couldn’t see, they wouldn’t say.
"Now as for that spell," His father sat back down, "What made you say that specific one?"
“Three...two…”
“I have big plans!” The child waved their hands in the air showing. “I have much I want to accomplish.”
"Lose it? You're not remotely that careless." He patted Draco's hands which were still sheathed by the Cloak. "It's fine. Keep it."
“Yeah, yeah. Easy for you to say, Mister
"Yeah, Moony. Thought you were all for 'trusting Dumbledore's plans'." Sirius said bitterly.
The next few days, at Draco's expense, were indeed spent cleaning that forsaken house. The four of them worked, sometimes alongside Molly Weasley and Sirius, to remove whatever cursed objects, or Merlin forbid,
"Home?" Harry quirked his head, then he realised what Draco meant. "Oh, you meant my aunt and uncle's."
“Problem, Malfoy?” Harry called out, glancing furtively between him and the girl, who Draco could now recognise as the Ravenclaw seeker from the year before, Cho Chang. He also remembered her and Cedric being involved, which must have been utterly dreadful for her when he’d been killed.
If there was one way to get Draco to shut up, Potter had found it.
"Come on, Hermione! It's a Hogsmeade day!" Ron whined, "Relax a little!"
She stayed silent for a few moments, letting the words settle, before nodding. "I accept your apology, Draco."
"Was the git right about what he said to Hermione. About her being controlling."
Draco stormed into the Slytherin common room, spotting Blaise in the corner, curled up in a velvet black armchair with a book. He made his way over and collapsed in the twin chair across it, huffing loudly.
"I'm well, ma'am. How are y-"
"Oh my god, he did." He whispered back, equally horrified. "That dickhead."
“What?” Draco gasped. “Is that...well, legal?”
Hearing a short sigh from McGonagall, he looked back at her. She took off her reading glasses and clasped her hands over her desk. “Assuming the way Mr. Potter is currently digging a whole through my floor like a jackhammer,” Draco narrowed his eyes, not knowing what that was, “I take it that what the letter said was true?”
Of course, he couldn’t blame Harry for his anger, Draco was angry too. Hell, everyone was. For a lot of things, mostly, but angry because of the changes within the school and how very un-Hogwarts everything was beginning to feel.
“You do it with Potter all the time, though.” Blaise smirked. Draco shot him his most scalding glare and Blaise flashed a devilish grin in reply.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully, and he pat her back twice before leaving the room. He made his way past the door where Draco had met the Order earlier, which seemed to still be in use, so he tip toed just to be safe.
On the other side of Dumbledore, Bill Weasley stood, and Draco had to avoid looking at him the most. As the prolonged silence went on, the man had slowly been unable to keep the lid on his amusement.  Gradually, he had started occasionally clenching his jaw, eyes watering as Draco saw him trying to suppress a laugh. Draco made an extra effort not to glance at him too often, lest he break down and ruin the silent standoff he'd created in the room.
-o-o-
Sighing with relief, Harry turned back to Ron and added the crushed Evergreen to the base. The colour immediately changed in to a light grey, and Harry stirred a few times clockwise as Ron measured the correct volume of some clear lilac liquid he had grabbed.
" Hermione hissed in a tone very much like Molly Weasley's. Harry nodded violently and - thank Merlin -Viktor whisked them away as they were announced.
"I must say, Draco, I questioned your taste at first! Not only was it a Gryffindor but it was the king lion himself!"
"But…" Harry trailed off, not knowing how to phrase it correctly. He decided to say it anyways, realising if they might do this then they'd have to up front with each other as much as possible. "I need to know I can trust you, i hope you understand that. What you're asking of me is immense. If anyone found out I was giving information to you, with your father and-"
Malfoy looked up at him tensely, "Of course I do-"
it made him hysterical.
"You're lying." Harry shot back. "I bet the squid doesn't even know who are." He crossed his arms and stared at Malfoy challengingly.
"Ugh, nothing! It's just…"
Voldemort had said. Voldemort who now had a body. Who now had risen again.
"A soft general, one that relies on
"What? Ron, no way!"
"Oh, right. Well, I might have to go to the library and research then." Draco started, reminding Harry fondly of Hermione when she was on a roll about something. He remembered his friends with a pang of guilt, realising he had bailed on them after dinner and never went back. They must all be asleep, Harry thinks, checking his watch.
The two made their way to the common room and into their respective dorms. Draco crawled into bed and reflected on the very strange turn of events that happened in just one weekend. He now had people to sit with for meals and Harry Potter was now…single.
The younger boy turned to his dad, “Can we dad? Please?”. Harry always admired how kids could so easily become friends. These two boys barely spoke to one another and here they were asking for a playdate. One in which he knew Draco would never agree to.
“I want you. In the open.” Draco gave a smile.
“Okay…”
It’s a very odd relationship, Draco knows this. But still, it’s something.
“It’s fine. I get it.” Harry tried to return the smile, but still felt annoyed by the woman.
Harry was shocked by the bluntness of the statement. He opened his mouth to speak, but Draco kept talking.
After days of this, the only thing that got him out of bed was Quidditch. It was something to put all of his thoughts into, something to allow him to
Draco couldn’t muster up words in the moment and continued to stare at Harry, who was growing noticeably uncomfortable.
” Draco began to make his way towards the kitchens and Harry followed.
Harry told them everything. Yes, everything. He didn’t give
“What do you mean ‘just us’?” Draco seemed confused.
Draco went numb. His body shivered, and in that moment, he knew that nothing good could from this conversation. Draco felt fear gripping him and plastering him to the chair.
What if people were upset about the Prophet article? He was used to having ‘fans’ but a lot of people still didn’t like Draco…what if someone was coming to hurt him?
? Are those hedge clippers?”
He closed his eyes and allowed his body to apparate to wherever it was taking him.
Ginny gave a drunken, yet very sweet speech about how great of a brother he was and how he was much better than Ron. Ron didn’t even try to argue, he simply piggy-backed off of Ginny’s speech and said “hear, hear!” Hermione’s toast was elegant as always, it probably helped that she hadn’t drank
Blaise continued, “I’ve tried for so long with you Draco. But I am done! I’m not going to listen to you go on about him anymore. And I’m certainly not going to stick around while we try and pretend like you didn’t say his name yesterday while we were…” Blaise didn’t even get to the finish his sentence, though everyone in the entry way knew what he was going to say. That was it. That was what did it. Draco threw the largest hex Harry had ever seen.
When he first got the land, he had one horse. It was a rather sad and old horse that didn’t really do much. Draco had always heard of muggles riding horses and decided he wanted to give it a try. Once he finally figured out how to grow wheat (after about six months of nearly starving from no money), he made a little bit of money and bought himself a horse. After many failed attempts, he learned to ride it and quickly fell in love. It reminded him of riding a broom. The way the wind whipped past him, the feeling in his heart when he went up on the horse, then crashed back down.
Harry spun around much too quickly and noticed Hermione sitting on the oversized and beat-up brown sofa. “Hermione I’m really tired. I’m not interested in a lecture tonight. I’ll catch you in the morning.”
with a dark wizard.” Draco didn’t mean for this conversation to take such a dark turn, but here we are.
“That’s exactly why you
But he really didn’t have a choice in the matter and ended up on the doorstep of his godfathers’ house exactly three weeks before his return to Hogwarts.
“I just wanted to tell you, it’s okay to be sad. Charlie leaving is…hard on everyone.” The way her eyes squinted gave away that she definitely did not mean
Teddy was thrilled every single time Harry mentioned seeing Scorpius and ‘Mr. Draco’. The two boys had yet to grow tired of one another, just like their guardians…
a night at the Manor, it was still an adjustment. But it surprised Harry how
Hermione looked at Ron, “Can we do that, Ronald?”
?” Harry didn’t recognize his own voice.
Harry heard everything from, ‘Yeah, I heard Harry found Draco
“It’s fine Harry. You didn’t think about it because you don’t have to. You aren’t gay and you aren’t pureblood.” The two sat in silence again for another moment.
“But don’t you worry your pretty little head about it, Potter. I’ll get him back.” Draco winked and Harry felt his neck heat up again. Harry took this as his cue to leave.
Hermione found a date rather quickly but refused to say who it was with. This annoyed Ron and pushed him to find a date even harder.
“Oh. Right…So, how are things with you and Blaise?” Harry was uncomfortable and after his own activities last night and needed to talk about anything other than Draco engaging in…activities.
“Sure Potter…”
The two found themselves in the astronomy tower, once again. Even after their relationship became public, this spot still felt…right for them. The night before they were set to leave, the two had decided to further their relationship. Harry still wasn’t ready to move
But as much as Draco wanted to forget the letter – one piece stuck out above the rest. And it’s the line that’s burned into his memory –
The rest of dinner went by without ceremony, as did their retreat to the eighth-year dorms. The only item of note was when Ginny asked Harry to walk her to her dorm and he turned her down with a ‘I’m quite tired actually, I really should get to bed’. Draco wanted to make a comment about it only being 8 but thought it best to keep to himself.
“Potter, you think we could have done this when it
“I…wanted to talk to you. About that night in the changing room.” Harry paused and saw Oliver’s face drop to the ground.
The sun wasn’t quite up yet so the house still had a faint darkness to it. But even in the dark, Harry looked…beautiful. And peaceful. And…
“Completely sure. Draco, I want you. Only you. First pick.”
“Harry, are you sure you know what you’re saying?”
crush on him back in third year.” Ron had pushed into his arm before they made their way into the room to change.
Lily Potter didn’t know what happened, but she knew her Harry was hurting. She continued their drive home because she knew she needed to get her son home. As soon as they entered the door, before Lily could say anything, Harry drug his trunk upstairs and slammed his door. James stared at his wife in shock and confusion.
Harry must have been obvious about his thoughts because he soon saw Draco Malfoy walking towards them and remarking, “We’ve made drastic changes to the house in the past few years. It was important to me that Scorpius and I had a fresh start after everything.”
“So….so you’re okay with me? Being gay?” Harry didn’t know how much of this conversation Molly would be comfortable with, so he decided to keep going, but proceeded with caution.
Draco could feel his eyes becoming watery. He always thought people had moved on. Forgotten about him… He looked around at his cottage and noticed that it was beginning to grow dark outside. Harry must have noticed this too.
“Ah – well, it was a rather…difficult day. It’s been a difficult week actually. Been hard to get away, you know?” Draco actually didn’t know. He didn’t know anything about the man in front of him actually. I mean, sure, he knows this man really well when you think about it. But he doesn’t know anything from the past couple of years. Was Harry Potter married? Did he marry the Weasley girl? Maybe Granger? No, Granger’s too smart for him… Did he have kids? He’s an auror, that’s obvious. But what about the rest of him?
what was going on. And why won’t you acknowledge the fact that you’ve been
Three weeks into term and Harry was starting to become overwhelmed. Harry knew his NEWTs classes  would be difficult, he just didn’t realize he would be going through…whatever this is while taking them. His stress was making it more and more difficult for him to focus on Quidditch, but he knew he couldn’t push it off any longer – he needed to have tryouts.
“Oh – Did she not want you there?”
“I needed to see you, to talk with you.” Harry rushed the words out of his mouth as fast as he could.
“That’s all you heard! Out of all that – THAT’S what you choose to comment on?! Where were you Draco?”

cry when they brought the boys over, but soon, she took them as if they were her own.
Draco can’t see him clearly, but thinks he sees a sign of relief wash over his face as he begins to approach him. Draco doesn’t move. He knows he could at least meet the man halfway, but this is his farm and technically Potter is a trespasser, so why make things easy for him?
Astoria looked more put together than she did banging on the front door of Malfoy Manor. She wore an elegant black dress, modest heels, and her dark hair framed her face beautifully. Harry noticed how her pale skin echoed Draco’s and their son’s. Harry could now see her features in Scorpius.
Harry gaped at Molly, “My…my what?”
don’t you know?” and shot Draco a wink.
Draco was speechless. And grateful.
Harry was quickly starting to see that keeping all of these thoughts and feelings to himself was not going to be helpful. So, he decided to talk with Ron and Hermione.
What in the hell was Draco Malfoy doing here? Charlie had been thinking about Harry a lot over the past few months and had a lot he wanted to say. He decided to clear the air now so he could enjoy the rest of his visit.
Draco nodded and closed the door. Twenty minutes. That wasn’t nearly enough time to complete his morning routine. He had to make a choice – get back in bed and finish what he started…or shower.
“Take your tea Draco.” Draco looked to his right and saw a beautiful cup of tea sitting on a glass saucer floating in the air. He moved to take the tea and the saucer disappeared. “Drink Draco”. Draco moved to bring the cup to his mouth but caught a strange look from his father. He tried to take a sip of the tea and move it back to his lap but felt he couldn’t. The cup wouldn’t leave his lips. The tea burned his mouth as it went down, and he was forced to drink and drink until all the tea was gone.
they’ve already had two girlfriends and killed a dark lord. It’s JUST ME who loses their virginity to their best mate’s older brother only to hear him say he would rather live in another COUNTRY than be with you. Yeah, makes sense, it’s always just me…”.
Draco made his way upstairs only to realize he had no idea where Harry would be. Without knowing what else to do, he called out “Harry….?”.
“This thing with you and Harry…it seems sudden…doesn’t it?” Hermione seemed unsure if she truly wanted to ask this question, but Draco knew by now that if she wanted to know something, she was going to get her answer.
I started messing around with a couple of guys in Ravenclaw, if you can believe that. I threatened them that if they ever told anyone I would cast a permanent curse on them that would result in boils popping up all over their face.” Harry and Draco both smiled.
“Potter. The people in town don’t know who I am. To them, I’m Drake the farmer down the road. That’s it.”
“That depends on your answer.”
“He does…He doesn’t tell him any bad things. He tells him the truth, or at least the truth that a six-year-old should hear. He shows him pictures of you.” Astoria smiled and Harry continued. “Astoria…Draco would never take him from you if the roles were reversed. He loved you…I know he still does. He wants you to find happiness just like he has. He won’t keep you from him…but you can’t have him completely. You can’t take him away.” Harry wanted to make his point as clear as possible and once again it looked like he had Astoria’s attention.
Harry looked relieved that Draco was finally speaking. “I…We need to talk. It’s important.” Draco looked at Harry with fear in his eyes.
“Well, Astoria. That’s exactly what this is about. And I can assure you that this
“That’s terrible Draco….”
“Harry….you’re none of those things. You fell for someone – and they didn’t or couldn’t want you back. It happens. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, but you shouldn’t feel foolish about it. Frankly, I’m surprised it took you this long for it to happen, but I guess fighting in a war does that to a guy.”
“No, um…it’s fine. I just…knew? I don’t know. I started having thoughts and dreams…” Watch it Draco….
?” Harry smiled as Draco corrected himself and began to follow him into the kitchens. Harry nodded and a house elf appeared to take their drink orders.
“So…how’d you come to own a place like this?” Draco rolled his eyes.
A very excited Scorpius was squirming and giddy beside a shocked and knowing Leona Greengrass. “Scorpius, let’s go to the kitchen and fix you something to eat.” The woman began to usher the child towards the kitchens all the while still staring at Draco and Harry.
“Nothing I guess. Let’s just continue being…us.” Draco’s response made Harry calmer, but he knew it wasn’t that simple. Draco must have known this too because he continued, “Look. It won’t be easy, but people
It was easy to talk to this Draco. Or maybe, he shouldn’t say
“Ready for today?” The excitement stayed in Harry’s voice as he spoke.
Draco’s eyes went wide as he tried to acknowledge what was happening but when Harry didn’t back away Draco decided to go for it. Hell, if Harry wanted to kiss him, then he would definitely kiss him.
“Oh, something tells me he won’t be…” Sirius shot Harry a cheeky smile.
get over it. We can lay low for a bit or be as in their face about it as we want. It won’t matter. They don’t matter.”
The situation Harry wasn’t prepared for was when Draco wrote, “What if I came as your date? You know, show that you’ve moved on.”
The only thing that made anything better was Teddy.
“Draco…how’d it go?” Harry looked at the man as he began to make his way towards the kitchen and Harry followed. The two sat and Harry stared as Draco sat in silence before finally speaking.
“What? Caring? Yeah, well, you never really bothered to know me Potter. Granted, it’s not entirely your fault, but I was rather good in potions and I enjoyed it quite a bit. And after the trial I decided I wanted to do something important with my life. I needed to make up for all the harm I had caused over the years. Both mentally and physically.”
This was working until he saw a flash of shimmering light in the hallway on a walk late one evening. He had taken to these walks his first week back as a way to ‘de-stress’ and process his thoughts. But he never saw a shimmer like this…
Harry allowed himself to chuckle and Draco decided to go sit next to him on the bed and peeled back the covers from his face, revealing those eyes again.
an infant managed to destroy one of the most powerful dark wizards of all time, but he did. The war had been difficult on everyone and the Potter family was no exception. Upon joining the Order of the Phoenix, the Potters immediately began to help. Voldemort was growing stronger and gaining more and more followers. Wizards and witches were flocking to become Death Eaters, followers of Lord Voldemort, and terrible times laid ahead.
“Yeah, well, he played for Puddlemere too. The break-up wasn’t pretty so I felt it was time to find my place elsewhere. And my Quidditch mates took sides…well, took a side – his. So, here I am.”
is why his father kept him away – Harry.
“An inspired choice. I think I might have one of the same. Wait right here with your father and I’ll be right back.” Draco moved to stand up and moved his eyes towards the other father for the first time.
“I’m not trying to push you into anything, but I enjoyed last night…and this morning. I’ve been enjoying whatever this is since it started, and I want to continue it. So, if this is some sort of quick thing for you then it’s best to end it now.” Harry couldn’t help but notice how much the mood and tone had changed since the bed this morning, but also knew Draco was right. Teddy didn’t have either parent and also deserved stability.
“Oh. Right. Um, I just mean, why haven’t you talked to anyone?” Draco could tell she was getting uncomfortable and likely regretting her choice in seats today.
“I think you already answered that question. No stares. Silent.” Still trying to keep from sounding like a dick.
Draco turned around to give Harry his book with a sly grin. “Potter, why is it when I look at you, I always find your mouth open? You didn’t need to throw your book on the floor to get a good look at my arse. You could have just asked.” Draco winked and Harry felt his entire stomach drop.
Harry. Everyone would be returning tomorrow, and Harry had been no where to be found. Draco just assumed he had gone back to taking his meals in his room and was actively avoiding Draco at all costs. Draco warred with himself about going and knocking on the man’s door but fought against it.
He tried to act nonchalant, taking off his boots and motioning around to show various areas. “That’s the kitchen, obviously. Dining area, living room, and back there is my bedroom and bathroom.” Draco tried his hardest not to look at Harry as the man looked around but couldn’t help it.
? But, no, he said all those things…he said he had liked Harry for a long time… he got in fight with Blaise about him…this just didn’t make any sense.
Harry sat on the bed in shock. Yes, of course he knew this day would come. Yes, he knew he shouldn’t feel tears starting to swell in his eyes. And yes, he knew that tightness in his chest was about to burst. But he calmly looked at Charlie and said, “Okay. Two weeks, wow, that’s….soon, but yeah okay. Thanks…I guess…for, everything.”
“What the hell am
Harry didn’t know what he was expecting, but this certainly wasn’t it. His father didn’t just
him that I actually want to be with you and he still couldn’t…deal with it.” Draco hated how much he understood Ron in this moment.
“Sorry mate, I just didn’t know this was where this was heading. I mean, I’m happy for you, but I thought it would be some sort of quick hook-up or more flirting/pining from across the Great Hall. Not actual…dating.” All good points and things Harry had already thought about.
Draco looked back at Voldemort and felt a familiar chill run down his spine. This was what true fear feels like.
“To be expected…I guess.” Draco couldn’t read Harry’s tone and was growing worried.
“Oh, um, thanks Mrs. Malfoy” Harry couldn’t hide the surprise in his voice.
“Harry, could we maybe talk in private?” Charlie was looking directly into Harry’s eyes which did not do well for Harry’s fake attempt to be in a new relationship.
But Harry honestly wasn’t prepared for the emotions that were to come.
“Fine. But all I have is the couch.” He pointed towards the ratty old sofa that had been left behind by the previous owner. “It’s not comfortable.”
“This is coming out all wrong” Harry continued. “I’m sorry I left. Like I said, I can be quite impulsive sometimes and I just didn’t know how to deal with what had happened. So, I went to the Burrow. I went and talked to…Charlie actually.”
Which the owl did, two hours later.
Ron and Harry left the dance after that and decided to not talk about the night ever again.
Harry ate the rest of his sandwich then went back to his room and immediately fell back asleep. He was in no shape to process any of this.
Dean bounced back faster than Harry and let out a quick, “We-we shouldn’t have done that.”
“What?” Draco was definitely caught off guard by Harry’s excitement.
sound like a dick. He was really working on that, but years of harassing his peers had caused a semi-permanent dick-ish tone to come out of his mouth whenever he spoke.
Harry let out a loud laugh, “Salazar Slytherin? Really? Tell me Draco, do
And so, this was it – the day Draco Malfoy stopped fearing his father. There were much scarier things in the world than Lucius Malfoy.
mother?” Draco was obviously trying to get himself out of the limelight.
Harry was starting to worry. Not hearing from Draco made all kinds of thoughts flood into Harry’s brain -none of them good. Harry felt better when he finally received a letter from Draco on his birthday, but it was short and didn’t explain why he had been away. Harry wrote several letters back – each time trying to space them out so Draco wouldn’t get in trouble.
Harry was too much in a state of shock to fight back, “Um – sure. And yes – Grimmauld Place.”
Harry was frustrated because he came over here with a job to do, “I will. I just need to do this first, please.” Hermione nodded and got him fixed up with the supplies he needed.
“Gay?”
“You know, your schedule for the day? What are you up to?”
Harry didn’t know if it was because he was now on his second class of whisky or because there was something about talking with Charlie that made Harry feel calm, but he decided to just come out and say it. Aloud. For the first time.
“I’m sorry mate…” Ron let out before a yawn, ”…I told her not to owl you so early.”
“Mate. Okay, the first two years I understood. I thought he was a genius at Quidditch too. His speeches were really…moving. But third year…Harry you cried when he left. Like, actual tears. Then tried to give us some lame excuse like ‘the team is just going to really change without him’.” Harry rolled his eyes as Ron pretended to cry into his hands.
“I think I should go.”
Harry actually found himself watching Cho and Cedric quite a bit during the dance. Cho looked beautiful, of course. But Cedric. Cedric looked…perfect. He watched as the man glided around the dance floor with Cho and never looked away. He looked at the way Cedric’s dress robes flowed around him but hugged in just the right places. He looked at the way Cedric smiled while he danced with Cho and the way he would whisper in her ear before they both would look at each other and giggle.
The dreams escalated in this way until he was finally able to see features – dark hair, green eyes, a scar… Before Draco even knew the gender of this person, he knew the name – Draco Malfoy was having flirtatious dreams about golden-boy, Harry Potter.
to date.
Harry accepted the offer and Kingsley informed him that he would be starting in two weeks (after they filled some of the other positions available in the program).
“Yeah, well. It is what it is. At first, I was furious with her. I never once was going to leave Scorpius. I was always going to be there for him, but she just…couldn’t. But now, I’m not as mad. Astoria always wanted a certain kind of life. The kind she
“I’m fine Hermione, really. I don’t know what you’re implying, but I’m great! Now, go take care of your boyfriend. He thinks you’ll get mad if he drinks too much tonight.” Hermione gave Harry a smile and stood to leave.
It was funny how much he already knew about this man. He knew Draco Malfoy wasn’t a morning person, nor was he a night owl. He had to go to bed right at 9pm and would wake up at 6am always upset about it. But anytime Harry said, ‘it’s fine, go back to sleep’, he would
“No, I caught the way they look at you. I even heard some of the younger women talking about you when I waited for you outside the feed store. They think you’re handsome and…” Harry placed his index finger on his chin as if to signal he was thinking, but really Draco knew it was to pretend to be cute, “I think the word they used was…mysterious?” And there was that attractive, yet annoying grin again.
“Of all people, he is no one to judge anyone for their actions during the war. Bloody coward ran, didn’t he?” Shit, Harry was defending him…
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “You had ‘things to take care of’. What about me?! What about taking care of ME!? And I only told them because I was miserable, Draco! I had to tell
“She’s a bully Hermione! And Draco is too scared to fight back, but I’m not! I don’t know this woman and frankly, I don’t give a shit about her. So, I’ll talk to her.”
Hermione had figured him out, but right now, he was more concerned about Ron.
Seamus leaned over to kiss Dean – the kiss wasn’t obscene, but Draco definitely felt that if McGonagall saw, she wouldn’t think they were just
“I – I mean. We have plenty of extra rooms and stuff.” Harry panicked trying to fix his mistake and was surprised when Draco said, “sure” before sitting back down at the table and pouring two more glasses.
Teddy wore an expression that said ‘there’s no way you’ll guess what I want’. His face was smug, and he crossed his arms over one another on his chest.
something (which he knew she did – it’s Hermione).
“Come on Draco. Fight back! You want to keep telling me over and over again how we ‘just can’t be together’ and how ‘it isn’t going to work like that with us’ because of what, your family? No, we both know why we can’t be together Draco. You’re too caught up in your precious Potter. Or which way is it Draco, should I say, your precious Potter is too caught up in YOU?” Draco turned bright red and Harry thought he was going to fire the killing curse right then and there.
They only one he could tolerate was Billy.
Draco grew more and more anxious as time went by. He just
This is the thought that pissed Draco off the most. No, he didn’t want Harry Potter to come back to
Harry told his parents everything. He told them about the break-up with Draco, the marriage arrangements, and the letter from the Malfoys. He also told them about his plans to leave.
Draco hadn’t told anyone, because honestly – who was he going to tell, but word seemed to travel fast anyway. Once word got out about the Chosen One’s new relationship status, Draco actually began to fear for Harry’s life.
“Here it is.” Draco echoed Harry before continuing, “I guess there would be no point in denying it.”
“I’m going to talk to her…alone. We don’t need to go through lawyers. We can do this ourselves. If she wants time with him, then fine. But she isn’t taking him completely.” Harry didn’t love how this sounded. He really should use lawyers to make things more official but understood where Draco was coming from.
– ‘we can’t just sleep all day!’. Harry would smirk, turn over, and fall back asleep.
“The Prophet. Skeeter. They published our kiss from the match yesterday.”
Harry remained in shock. “Oliver Wood?! You’ve known since I was 11 and didn’t say anything to ME about it?!”
“Surprisingly, I think I’ll manage. Besides, from what I heard, Weasley men are severely lacking in a department in which we Malfoys seem to excel.”
The two men went down the steps, Draco care-free and Harry on his side, wand out.
Harry felt like his brain short circuit. Oliver Wood. Was back at Hogwarts?
And they were right. The day before he was set to go back to his parents, Harry couldn’t help himself. All of the thoughts and feelings that he had been bottling up over the summer were ready to spill out. While the three of them sat in silence eating dinner, Harry spoke. “How did you guys know you were gay?”
“I did…I wrote to Astoria. I called her to a meeting- just the two of us…” Harry looked straight at his friends. He knew this what he needed to do. He was sure of it.
The following week Harry didn’t hear from Draco. This wasn’t unusual – he figured Draco had gotten consumed by his work, just as Harry had. Nevertheless, Harry arrived at Malfoy Manor the next Saturday at their usual time.
“Harry…” Draco wasn’t a fool though. As much as he had always wanted and thought about this, that meant he also thought about consequences. “What exactly do you want…?”
“I – I don’t understand…how?” was all Harry could let out before Hermione started.
“No, no one knows. Just you. It’s a fairly new development. I don’t like too much attention and therefore don’t want to broadcast anything about it at the moment. I’m enjoying my 4-week streak of NOT being the cover story of the Daily Prophet.”
When the circle turned to Harry, he didn’t even hesitate. He stood quickly – too quickly. The room spun around him, and he immediately said to himself, “I should leave. I should go home, sit down Harry”. But that part of him was quickly gone as he decided to allow himself to speak.
“Um…hi.” Harry let out while Draco continued in his silence.
“Wait right here! I’m going upstairs to get your gift!”
Harry looked at Hermione, “Hermione, care to tell me why I’m here?”
Harry was spending more time with Draco than he had his entire life…and he liked it. He liked when Draco make snarky comments about things in their day to day life, he liked when Draco took
Draco smiled, “I definitely have more than a crush…” and grabbed Harry’s neck to pull him in for a kiss.
“Harry. If someone was going to hex me, they’d have the good enough sense not to knock on the front door first. Plus, the house has wards in place to keep certain people out, it’ll be fine.” Draco didn’t seem concerned, but Harry couldn’t shake it.
“No Harry. No. I’m sorry, but no. I don’t feel that way about you. I’m – I’m sorry Harry if I gave you that impression, but I-I like someone else. A girl. I like girls.”
“Sure mate.” Ron shot him another smirk before Hermione got up to move into the dining room and patted his shoulder as she walked out the room.
Harry was left with a very strange feeling. This wasn’t normal. His parents didn’t act this way to him. These were the parents that didn’t scold him for earning detention and scooped him up in their arms when he came out as gay. Not the ones who…left the room.
“I want to do more…” Draco blushed as Harry looked down at Draco’s stomach and let his eyes drift further. “I’ve just never really…done much. I mean, even with Ginny…” Draco smiled, and it seemed to ease Harry a bit.
“Oh…thanks. But you don’t have to…console me or anything. I’m fine.” Harry tried to shake Dean off, but Dean wasn’t having it.
When they entered town, Draco did as he always did. He put on his ‘Drake’ look. One that said, ‘I too am a muggle farmer, just like you’. He made his way towards the shops he needed – the feed store to gather more food for his sheep (typically, they ate his grass but he liked to buy them Alfalfa Pellets when he thought they deserved a treat), a new pair gloves, and he was in desperate need for some actual groceries.
“Okay. But your father won’t like this. I mean, I believe you Harry if you say he’s different, but your father holds a very strong grudge against Lucius Malfoy. This is the man that followed the darkest wizard of all time. A wizard who came on a mission to kill you. Your father won’t give that up.”
“So, you like red heads? That part is obvious.” Draco smirked and Harry felt the need to defend himself.
“Shit Draco…I’m sorry. Of course, you already know that – it was stupid of me to say. Especially sitting here whining about
Once word had spread and Draco and Harry made their hand-holding debut, Harry was extremely grateful that he had told his friends ahead of time. The whispers and stares were intense, to say the least. For some reason people were strongly invested in his relationship. And it came from all sides.
“Well, Mr. Potter…what is it I can do for you? I assume this has something to do with mine and Draco’s legal situation. Which I can assure you has
Draco finally broke the silence, “Well…what do you want to do? Knowing our children, the minute Scorpius sees Teddy he’s going to say he saw you here.”
“But this wizard did not take my son and he did not kill my family. Instead, my son
Draco finally decided to speak, “I’ve thought about this mother. A lot. I love Harry.”
But Harry also understood the importance of the farm to Draco. So, he agreed to long-distance. Harry would come and stay weekends with Draco on the farm, and the work week back at his own house.
“Figure this shite out with Draco, then come find me Harry. That is, if you’re still interested…” and just like that, Harry’s fantasy was over. Oliver dressed himself as Harry stood, immobile. Then walked out the room.
“Right…well, they never said being an auror was easy work.” Draco tried to make his tone sound light, but it still came out cross.
“Yes I am. You know who I am?” The young boy blinked and nodded quickly.
Draco continued, “She’s agreed to visitation…and no lawyers.” Harry watched as Draco’s face broke out into a smile and he stood to grab Harry.
He made his way towards the door and turned back, “I’m going to tell Hermione and Ron tomorrow when they get back. We can talk tomorrow night about how it goes.”
“Merlin Potter! Don’t tell me you
“The agenda?” Draco watched Harry as he seemed to make himself at home.
“I’ve got a new friend! I’m going to his house tomorrow!” Teddy screamed out as soon as they walked into Hermione and Ron’s that evening.
With his father in prison, the Malfoy name was already disgraced. It wasn’t like Draco could do anything more to tarnish it. They barely managed to keep their house and
Harry remained in a daze for the rest of the day. That night, he replayed the scene in his head over and over again. His body reacted immediately, and Harry groaned. “Great…” he whispered to himself in the dark before he rolled over and went to sleep.
Draco flushed and looked away. But before he did, he could have sworn he saw a look pass over Harry’s face. He wasn’t sure what the look meant, but it didn’t mirror Ginny’s.
He learned that Slytherin house was small. Very small. Several people didn’t return (even in the younger years) and very few first years were sorted into the house at all. Draco assumed this had to do with their involvement during the war and the new-found prejudice towards the house, but once again, Draco didn’t mind. It meant fewer people were trying to talk to him during meals. And by fewer, he meant none.
think about the letter his father sent him, although it was honestly the only thing he thought of all day as it was. He couldn’t shake the fact that Lucius had connections at Hogwarts and that they had seen Draco with Harry…
As if he could read his mind, Draco opened his mouth to speak. “Harry, I do love you. I’ve loved you for a while now. But like I said, I won’t be a second choice. I respect myself too much to allow myself to be with someone who only loves me because the person he truly wants doesn’t love him.”
“Oh. Um, well yes to both I suppose. I’m gay and Draco and I are…
Draco stopped abruptly, “Yes?”. Harry smiled, “Yes – I would like to go on a date with you.”
When Draco received a letter one week later, Harry figured Narcissa must be stronger than she looked.
Harry knew he hadn’t been very subtle and
“Yeah, I know what you mean. I love Hogwarts too. I’m terrified to leave.”
And luckily, he didn’t have to.
“Well, yes, that’s all true. But…I’m…I’m not with Oliver like that.”
Charlie smiled, “You’re right George, probably not.” Then turned his attention towards his mother. She had gone awfully quiet. “Mum, you okay?”
often.” Draco smiled nervously.
people might get the wrong idea.” Harry simply rolled his eyes and looked away.
Draco had to think things over pretty quickly. Sure, this was everything he ever wanted. He just never actually thought he could have it. He had obviously been thinking about this way longer than Harry had and unlike Harry, he didn’t just realize his sexuality…he needed to be sensitive.
Harry looked at him confused. Draco rolled his eyes and continued. “Sex dreams Potter. About blokes.” Wow, how did this guy defeat a dark lord?
Draco
“Basically nothing?! What
They laid there until the sun came up and Charlie decided Harry should make his way back to his room before people saw him coming out of Charlie’s room and begin their questions. Harry really didn’t want to leave, but he knew Charlie was right. He went back to his room, laid in his own bed, and felt a strange mix of emotions. He was so happy about the night he had just experienced, but he was worried about the way leaving Charlie made him feel. Laying in his own bed and listening to Ron’s snores made him feel alone and uncomfortable – he wanted to be back in Charlie’s arms and snuggled up against that bare-chest. This couldn’t be good…
“Well, Potter. That’s my cue. I trust you can see yourself out.” Draco motioned towards the door and was about to turn towards his bedroom when he heard Harry begin to speak.
“What…” Harry heard his voice falter and coughed to gain it back, “What did she say, Draco?”
Draco quickly looked at his father. He needed his father to stop this. He couldn’t do this. Bring Death Eaters into Hogwarts? How?!
“Yeah, no one really talks about it much. Like I said, I think mom still expects me to show up with a woman one day and most of the family just doesn’t acknowledge it. Bill has been great about it though– he’d be okay with you too if you wanted to tell him. George is coming around to it too. He and I have been bonding much more now and he made a joke the other day that tells me he knows what I am and is fine with it enough to make jokes about it. But I actually think the rest of them have kind of forgotten about the whole thing…Ron and Ginny were pretty young at the time.”
“Yeah…probably not.” Was all Harry could muster in response. He moved over and Draco opened his arm for Harry. Harry laid on Draco’s chest for as long as possible before they knew they needed to get back to their dorms.
“Harry. Do you not remember how this all started? You, drunk in a pub, outing yourself and confessing your love for the ginger in front of half of his family? Do you not remember drunkenly telling me
Granted, not everyone else got their photo on the front page of the Daily Prophet, but what else is new?
When they all returned for their third year, Harry noticed a change in Draco. He seemed…angrier and more aggressive. Draco became hell-bent on knocking Harry off his broom during Quidditch matches that year and his insults seemed to increase.
When the two parted, part of Harry had flashbacks. He thought about his first kiss and the way Dean looked at him after. When he pulled away from Draco – his face was a stark contrast to Dean’s. Draco still had his eyes closed and was smiling…
“It’s alright. Just a little cut. Nothing to be afraid of Teddy.” Draco knelt beside his son, pulled out his wand and cast a healing spell over the cut. Teddy seemed relieved as soon as the blood was gone.
