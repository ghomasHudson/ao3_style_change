Draco’s shoes squealed and his robes left droplets in the wake of his path as he walked towards the hospital wing. The blond sighed, wiping his wet bangs out of his eyes. Can this boy have a Quidditch game that didn’t end with him in a hospital bed?
Memories that only suffered in Draco’s nightmares pranced around his vision. Dark red eyes, sharpened nails tapping against a table, Draco stepping in pools of blood and feeling like he’ll sink into them. Feeling like prey as the Dark Lord stalked around him as he quietly threatened to kill him.
He got a detention. He didn't willingly sneak out. Was getting out of bed to tattle on the Gryffindors that important? It shouldn't have been.
Draco squished the dangerous developing thought and stood up. He felt lightheaded and emptied of tears. Leaning his shoulder against the wall, he dragged himself towards Ravenclaw Tower. When he reached the corridor he stopped.
"Yes, she'll be here soon. I'll make you some tea till then." Brushing away his hair out his eyes, she disappeared out of the living room.
The spider contoured to do impossible moves. It had no more of its free will. You couldn't blame it of any actions that they might do.
. He could feel his eyes become owlishly wide as the curling of his stomach turned sour. His heart was pounding in his ears, his body locked up like he got dosed in freezing water. A wall of thought hit Draco and, for once, this was a situation, not even in the realm of possibility in his previous life. Draco was cast into the ambiguity of a too impossible experience. An impossible theory turned true. Someone had a crush on him that wasn't Pansy. Harry Potter had a crush on him.
He swore that he finally knew what this year had in store and he was going to put that knowledge to good use. To finally put forward change that would benefit others. But his mind felt like it was on fire, constantly combusting and reassembling hastily and made his thoughts scatter and make them ten times more intense. Suddenly, Draco felt impending doom constantly, obstacles and blanks of knowledge were now
“Then... Why are you freaking out? Isn’t this a good thing? It finally happened! We've been waiting for this day! Shouldn’t we be downing some punch?”
“Many still don’t think they’re good people… But my family is trying to make amends.  I don’t erase what they did or dismiss their crimes because they’re my parents…  They know what they did… but… Does it mean something that they’re trying?”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Draco mumbled. He removed himself out of her grasp. “Nothing’s wrong, honest.” Narcissa looked suspicious but didn't question him.
Draco froze at the contact. Harry tucked his face into Draco’s throat as he wrapped his arms tightly around him.
"Lovegood!" She stood there, her robes more rumpled than before and now a red sweater was peeking out of her robes. "Luna, hi."
A (very small) rational part of Draco’s brain told him that he shouldn’t be reacting like this, but he couldn’t stop.
Dumbledore waved his wand near Draco’s head. An overwhelming sense of weight made Draco's limbs sluggish and his eyes drooped as everything went black.
Harry tried not to let his hope swell over the fact that there was an empty spot next to Ron across the table, yet Draco chose the one next to him.
"If we find out who Flamel is then we might figure out why he and Dumbledore are part of and why Snape is trying to steal it."
Draco took Lupin’s advice and decided to blow off classes for the day. The blond climbed up the stairs to the bronze eagled door. A red puff of fur was sitting outside.
"Finally! You think with us being Ravenclaws we could handle it." Terry rubbed the back of his neck.
“I've wronged you. I know that but..." Narcissa took a hesitant step forward. "I want to do better by you. I want to learn from my mistakes and start trying to make amends. I want to be your sister once more. But I won’t ask for your forgiveness. I'll go somewhere else and I’ll leave forever. Just…” She stepped back. “If you are ever willing to let me try to make things somewhat right between us, I’ll be here.” She was taking deep breathes as if to ward away crying.
Granger held open the door as Draco and Harry dragged Ron into the small room, the warm fire making Draco shiver even more.
Tonks and Draco reached the door when footsteps thumped towards them. Harry stopped in the hallway, puffing out a short breath.
The Weasley twins were hovering all over Harry. One swung at the Bludger that was aiming for Harry’s head and threw it off its course. It looked fine to Draco until the Bludger turned right back around and tried to aim at Harry once more.
Terry straightened in his chair as he saw Potter walk up to Draco and pull him away from the circle of Triwizard champions. Draco gave an incredulous glimpse at Terry before being whisked out of the Great Hall.
“I didn’t mean to! I was just so—confused. Of all the things I thought I was going to hear, that wasn’t one of them.”
Narcissa stood up to untie the package. She sat back down and pulled at the white string. Opening the box, Narcissa pulled out a postcard and gasped delightfully. “Oh, it’s from Molly!”
Draco thought that given Tonks personality, she might as well been herding dragons on the days Draco didn't see her.
"Let me see it." Narcissa stepped into the room, a creamy envelope in one of her hands. Lucius ripped it out of her hand and started skimming through.
His chest became slack, his throat opened as Draco gasped for air. The heels of his palms pushed against his eyes to stop the vision of those last moments. His heart was still felt like it was being squeezed, but the sense of panic was waning.
Draco stood up from his seat to set down how own teacup. He looked up at the werewolf in gratitude. “Have a good afternoon, Professor.”
Draco clicked his tongue and rested his chin on his knees. “Stupid Harry Potter…. Stupid Fletcher Nil.” Draco cringed at himself. It really was like it was his original timeline: complaining about people who didn’t like him.
When he closed his bedroom closed behind him, Draco realised he should’ve eavesdropped on his parents.
When they arrived in front of the Third Task maze, Draco’s feet almost went out from under him at the sight of Cedric Diggory on the ground, but Harry wasn't with him. Fleur and Viktor were looking on, trying to figure out what was happening.
Blinking rapidly, he was in a corridor. A corridor. Late at night. Looking over, he had no idea which corridor it was.
No, no, no. It was stupid. He couldn’t have done it. He was sleeping, in his stupidly blue bed in a stupidly blue Ravenclaw dormitory. It was a fact that Draco wasn’t responsible for any attacks in his first life and he shouldn’t be—
Of all things that could’ve broken Draco’s fragile composure, it was the twitchy secondhand of the Dark Lord, Peter Pettigrew.
There, in a far left of the tree, were two Black brothers named Regulus and Sirius. Cousins to Draco, once removed. Regulus’ photo was decayed the worst on the tree, dried specks falling onto the page to further emphasise that he’s been dead long before Draco could think of meeting him. Sirius’s still held a human-colour, his photo had a smoother shade, his young face far more handsome than the mugshot all over the
“Draco, it’s alright. We can work this out. Together. Let us help you—” Anthony put a hand on Draco’s arm but the blond twisted away from his grasp.
"I'm serious, Corner. Tell me." Draco was getting fussy. "You need to tell me." Well, he didn't, but Draco thought so.
Nil shoved Draco away. He heaved a frustrated breath and turned away to stalk out of the classroom without sparing Draco another glance.
Draco felt his grip on his wand go taunt. Peter Pettigrew. The Dark Lord’s right hand. Draco despised that man. He was always twitchy during meetings. It would distract Draco since he was also standing beside the Dark Lord’s chair. He was an old friend of James Potter, became their Secret-Keeper, revealed their location to the Dark Lord so that he could kill them and Harry.
The three (Granger took great pride that she already had her hair) let their hairs hiss and all turned gross shades of green and yellow.
"It's a cruel world out there, Harry." Lockhart placed the truck beside the others. "Now," Lockhart's elegant wand was picked up from his desk. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to erase your memories. Can't have you exposing me, I'll never sell another book."
Moody shifted his stance and he grinned crookedly. “I was sent because my father, and the Ministry for that matter, couldn’t handle the greatness of the Dark Lord."
“What’s up with Crabbe and Goyle? I swear if they’re thinking of following us again this year they have another thing comin’.” Terry muttered as they left the classroom, pockets bulging with black buttons they transfigured that lesson.
Draco ... didn’t really have a suitable opinion that would satisfy anyone. He remembered the story of Black’s arrest (who didn’t?) and his apparent loyalty to the Dark Lord, but when he joined the Death Eaters, they mentioned Black as a traitor (especially his Aunt Bellatrix) and never spoke his name without their faces twisting in disdain. He knew what the stories told him about Black’s connection to Harry and his parents (Draco felt an unwarranted wave of pity), but there had to be more to the story that he never knew. Black was later proved innocent after his death but Draco never found out the cause of it and how much had to do with Harry Potter.
Harry pulled away looking as if couldn’t believe what he just did. Then, he broke out into a bright smile and that captured Draco’s heart.
. There was a conflicting debate of even if he should reveal anything since he always swore he’d keep it secret. But to keep it completely to himself wouldn’t also be smart because he also couldn’t withhold information that could be a benefit to Harry’s success in the competition or even save the hassle of being a part of the tournament. But he needed Harry to be in the tournament in order to help save Diggory.
"I don't want to have this discussion in public. There's a reason I didn't response as soon as I got the news. I wanted to tell you face to face. I find it agreeable, don't you?"
"'Arry!" Draco had never been so happy to see the half-giant. "Where do you think yer goin'?" As an eleven-year-old boy, Hagrid was now larger than ever, more intimidating as he towered over the two boys. He was holding two large ice creams, one obviously for Potter, the other for himself.
Harry finished the last stretch of a wing and moved into the centre of the Snitch. He scratched in the letters ‘HP.’ Draco tilted his head when Harry added further detail to read ‘HP +.’ Harry hesitated for a moment before he went ahead and started a downstroke of another letter.
“Hi,” Harry repeated, his hand reaching up to his head before he stopped himself. “Why’re you here?”
The blond landed unsteadily on the flagstone. He leaned against the wall as he stumbled down the stairs. His body was raking with chills, feeling unwanted memories surface anew. Draco slumped against a cold stone wall at the foot of the stairs, wrapping his arms around his legs. He could feel Tom Riddle’s hand was on his neck. Riddle was barely squeezing but Draco still felt his body move without him telling it to. He felt his breath become shallow as if a hand was enclosing around his airway. He could see the Dark Lord's piercing red eyes, showing no remorse as he pointed his wand at Draco. The cold sensation of a dark green spell running straight into his chest. The brief sense of darkness before Draco woke up.
“Agh, I shouldn’t say the wrong thing,” Tonks scratched the back of her head. “Listen, I don’t think I’m the one that you need to hear this from, but I know the one: Mum. I’ll write to her. They’ll pick you up from the train station when term ends, anyways. She’ll talk to you then. Alright?”
Lupin looked more sickly than Draco has ever seen him, his robe was hanging in tatters. His face was pale and gaunt. Still, the teacher smiled. “It looks like you can use some tea.”
The executor scowled and hefted his axe over his shoulder and wandered out of the Hospital Wing, grumbling.
Draco didn’t think about who would be the other person in his daydreams about relationships. No one caught his interest so why did it matter? He knew when a girl was beautiful, but he never imagined himself with them, but much was the same with boys. He never
“A friend?!” Ron shrilled, the same second years shooting him another look. “What— No-- Mate, you can’t
“I did hear something break.” Narcissa pulled out her wand and waved at the mess. The tea jumped out of the wallpaper into the newly remade cup. “You gave Dobby a fright.”
Buckbeak relented and started to bow in return, but stopped to hesitate, taking in Draco almost unnoticeable fidget.
"Mate, I think you can lay them off for this one day." Weasley kept a firm arm around Draco, neither of them seeing the glance from Harry as he was about to knock the door. Granger was barely in when Hagrid shut the door on them. It was boiling in the small hut. Draco's hair was already feeling limp and sweat prickled on the back of his neck.
“He's fine. I can still look after the rat fine, Ron,” Draco reassured. Anthony still disliked the rodent and never let him near his bed but Terry liked to pet it as he talked about his theories on why Snape was suddenly nicer to them in class. Micheal liked to watch Scabbers when he was most active: standing on two legs to reach up to a crumb of food that Michael would hold over his head.
“I should think you deserve it if you were messing around the Forbidden Forest this late at night.” Madam Pomfrey scolded, pressing her fingers around Draco’s chest. She tutted when at Draco’s disgruntled noise of pain. “Yes, that’s most likely broken. What made you go into the Forbidden Forest in the first place?"
“They are presents for Young Master Draco’s friends, sir,” Dobby answered, trailing after discarded paper. “Many owls came over the days delivering them, they did.”
All grammar/spelling mistakes in prior chapters have been corrected by OmbreOwl. (To the greatest extent.)
"Hey, Harry... guys." He wanted to throw himself out the train window as the three Gryffindors squished themselves in.
Maybe he could actually have that, to be someone’s and for them to be his. His chest tightened with a foreign feeling like excitement or another emotion that would’ve sent him spitting in disgust in the past. Draco felt the corners of his mouth twitch up. It felt like a dream. He would really enjoy revelling in someone’s love and affection. Maybe he could have a relationship. Maybe it could actually work out.
“Professor Lupin,” Ron answered matter-of-factly. “We’re reckoning--Actually, Hermione’s reckoning--that he’s going to be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
A squawk made Draco whirl around to find Buckbeak settled on the other side of the hut, lying in a nest of straw and blankets. He turned back to Hagrid, disconcerted.
"I think we would all like to know," McGonagall said, who was standing silently by the fireplace mantle with an equally quite Dumbledore.
“Molly?” Draco’s brow furrowed. No one in their family had a name so simple as Molly (at least, not on his mother’s side).
Cedric was taken aback at Draco’s sharp tone but he answered, “I don’t actually know. I remember running around and then hearing a sound. Then, someone said ‘
Hermione ushered Ron out of the room and swiftly closed the door. The two boys heard thumps of footsteps going down the stairs before there was silence.
Tonks was looming over a figure on the floor, her foot planted on their chest, her wand pointed with a singular focus. She was slightly heaving, her nicked cheek bleeding slightly.
of his participation. But it was also that same participation—seeing Harry’s unreadable face—that caused him to run.
He reached out and ran his fingers over the patchy material. He followed the branches until he got to his branch. When he reached Bellatrix’s picture his finger hesitated before moving on. Then his own face was frowning out to him. He looked young and slightly… off. Like the tapestry didn’t know what he quite looked like, but on here nonetheless, because he was seen as a Black.
“Nothing, nothing. Just… I never thought I'd be in this type of situation. Merlin, help us all.” He laughed then so Hermione joined in as well.
Draco was left alone in the dorm room. He smoothed back his hair behind his ear and let out a long breath. He thought of where Harry could be at that moment before leaving the dormitory as well.
. It seemed as if Harry had removed himself completely from Draco’s life. Even the seat opposing Draco in Divination found itself emptied the days following the Second Task.
“That’s why you said it was a misunderstanding…” Harry whispered. Draco never saw Harry’s face look so betrayed. “You were helping him…”
Peter Pettigrew scratched at the floor, stuck in in the wall, forcibly transformed from his animagus form of a rat.
“We don’t need to bring that up,” Draco said quickly. “I’m just more sorry, Harry. Moody--Barty Crouch Jr--he told me--Harry, my father has been doing things behind the Ministry's back. You know what I found out? He
“No. Of course, you can.” Lucius glanced over the grounds. “Just--Be careful. But be sure to be back at the Minister's Top Box before the match starts."
Draco stumbled as he landed on cracked pavement. He looked up to see himself in a… where was he? They were on a street lined with brown-bricked houses. In the distance, he could see a dense forest.
"Harry?" Draco said hoarsely. He pulled away from the hug and saw Draco's grey eyes stare back at him
for him.” Draco’s emotions were getting twisted and twisted (and being a hormonal eleven-year-old didn’t help either). Nothing made any sense anymore. One moment, he didn’t want anything to do with Harry then the other, he can’t stop worrying. “You know, this past year he had a run-in with the Dark Lord again and defeated him once more. He showed me a mirror and I felt like a true friend to him and not his Slytherin arch-nemesis—”
“So you stayed behind because Potter did.” Anthony greeted as he dumped a chocolate bar on Draco’s study table. “Is that right?”
Draco soon became silent in the presence of Cedric Diggory. He looked so happy, with Cho smiling up at him and clutching at his arm.
It wasn’t exactly the satisfying comfort of his mother. Anthony didn't comb his hair with his fingers like his mother or give him sweet words into his ear, but it did make him feel secure. Draco’s stiffness slowly became lax. Anthony patted his arm once, twice.
“You’re ancient,” Draco muttered. He reached up to the side of the owl’s head to feel rough feathers. “Your eyes say it all.” Errol’s eyes had a cloudy layer, showing the defining trait of age. “You must’ve seen much, right?”
Before the task began, Hermione squished passed them to take her spot beside Ron, muttering about how Skeeter was probably going to take a hug out of context. When Cedric stepped into the ring to signify the start, Draco stood up straighter.
“Of course not, Ronald.” Hermione snapped. “I meant like a family member. Is there anyone who could be related to Black?” Hermione glanced over to the huddled small groups of Ravenclaws.
“TRAITORS! MORE TRAITORS BROUGHT IN BY MY CURSED KIN! I SHALL--Oh, I know those features!” the woman gasped. She clapped her hands. “Are you a Malfoy, young man?”
“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here!” Hagrid’s booming voice made Draco’s arms go back to their sides as he scowled. “All right there, Harry?” Hagrid asked through the sea of heads.
"Bollocks! Let's go--Ah, there you two are!" Sirius straightened in his chair. "Said everything that needed to be said?”
Draco was dreaming of warm arms of a nameless person. He never felt so... comfortable. It felt familiar, but Draco did not know where it belonged to. There was a vague scent of sunlight on their clothes, but Draco could not think of someone that smelled that way. He buried his head in the center of the person and he felt thin arms go around him. They were short and was a bit too skinny.
“Yes, you do.” Terry pushed it right back. "You’re even paler than usual. You’re getting bags under your eyes. Colds are going around and I don’t need someone in the dormitories having it.” Terry made a face.
When Ron showed him his dress robes later that day, Draco erupted in unrestrained, howling laughter.
Draco’s eyes went to the floor. It’s really not a shock that he would be confronted by Crabbe and Goyle. He was actually surprised that they didn’t catch him sooner. But he was a Ravenclaw now. And
"Buckbeak? Oh, yes, the hippogriff. Well, I say that this development takes priority over something so trivial as a complaint against a creature that hasn't repeated the offence since... Consider it dropped. I'll deal with the paperwork tomorrow." Fudge turned to the executor that Draco didn't even know was there loitering in the shadows. "Er, sorry, for wasting your time, Walden."
Tonks' brow furrowed and she rushed to kneel at the boy's side. She gave him a once-over and sighed.
Tonks yelled as she ducked, the wall behind her receiving scorch marks of a burning hole. She straightened to stare at the state of the wall.
No matter how much Draco has changed, there’s always going to be a part of him that remembers Malfoy. And if nothing is going to work out for him, if
“Why don’t we move along now?” Hemione piped up and ushered Draco away as Harry grappled Ron into a headlock.
With a brief struggle, Draco urged Gabrielle to start paddling towards Fleur who was flapping her hands in desperation to gather her sister out of the lake. Cho pulled at Draco’s arms, hauling him onto the deck and promptly wrapping him in a warm blanket.
Tonks shrugged. “It’s something impulsive and provides stress relief. Plus,” she wiggled her earlobe with a finger, “it looks pretty sick.”
“All those... mudbloods that'll be here soon. I need time alone." He put as much venom into his voice as he could, but his voice still shook at the word.
"Good day!" Dumbledore walked over the door and out to the hallway, leaving Harry and Draco to be alone. There was a moment of awkwardness.
Draco pulled back suddenly. “Your shirt is wet,” He frowned, patting at his now slightly damp front.
“It’s alright, dear. Just sit tight. Arthur thinks you've might've taken a spell. Completely horrible. No doubt some folks stepped on you.”
Buckbeak twitched, a made an inquisitive noise. He cocked his head and squawked again. The creature shuffled forward but still didn’t bow. Draco felt his palms get sweaty and starting having doubts about this actually going well.
Draco kept silent. Foggy, embarrassing memories of Umbridge patting his head and having tea in her horridly pink classroom.
Harry blundered as the groan of Fat Lady’s portrait opening sounded and Ron climbed out of the portrait hole.
Draco laughed and couldn’t resist giving Harry another kiss. When he leaned back he said, “I want a date, then.”
Draco told Chang they’ll talk strategy tomorrow and lingered so that Luna could shower the rat with a squeaky voice of affection before she went to the girls’ dormitory for bed.
The butterbeer went down the wrong pipe. Draco noisily set the bottle onto the table, using his other hand to cover his mouth as his body wracked with coughs.
Sirius Black didn’t look anything like his portrait on the Black family tree. His eyes were sunken, his hair matted with grease, ragged clothes over his bony figure.
There wasn't much of a shock when Harry's name was pulled out of the Goblet of Fire but it didn't lessen the disappointment. Or the frustration.
Edward turned directly towards Draco. Before he could react to being caught, Edward gestured his head back to the living room. Draco understood and returned back onto the couch.
That was stupid. He shouldn’t try to do things on impulse without knowing the outcome… Him knowing certain outcomes was the only upper hand he has. If he didn’t adhere to that then it’ll be like pulling a Harry.
“I don’t see anything, Professor.” Draco raised his head far enough to rub tiredness out of his eyes. (He didn’t have a good sleep last night.)
is Dumbledore!" He exclaimed, looking at a Chocolate Frog card. Weasley was saying he had six of him when everything blurred.
“Draco, my love,” Narcissa started, grabbing his hands. “You’re going to be staying here with your Aunt Andromeda and Uncle Ted.”
Anthony held up his hands in complacency. "So sorry about that but I have been looking for you. Glad I caught you before Potter did.” Anthony wrapped a casual arm around Draco’s shoulder (with more ease as he seemed to grow a few inches over the summer). ”Merlin knows that you don’t sit with us often.” Anthony pulled at Draco to start walking. “I have to tell you all about my Bar Mitzvah I had this summer—you know, the one I mentioned in my letter—and warn you that Michael’s growing his hair out. It isn’t as bad as we say it is, but we can’t have him getting an inflated head so…” Draco nodded, understanding.
“I don’t remember Valentine’s being like this last year…” Michael said, gagging at the lace under their plates as he and Terry sat across from Draco and Anthony.
Draco followed him up the stairs and down a hallway, glancing at each moving picture display of a family of three.
he was reacting like this even after he had his revelation. He needed to say that he didn’t feel the same. Even though Cho and Ginny were now in committed relationships, that shouldn't stop Harry from realizing that his feelings for him were... mislaid.
The four stepped in Professor McGonagall's office and Harry was hit with a smell of expensive perfume before it brushed past him and Draco was swept up in a hug by a woman. Snape appeared behind her.
Divination was a disaster. Professor Trelawney kept saying that Draco’s Inner Eye was the most cloudy she’s ever seen from a student.
“Oh, that’s…” Harry hurried over and shut his trunk closed, edges of clothing poking out as he shoved it out of Draco’s sight.
“Thanks so much, mate. You’re a lifesaver.” Ron dumped his frumpy rat into Draco’s awkward hands. “He won’t be much of a bother, really,” Ron reassured, looking over his pet like he was a child left with a new babysitter. “He likes to eat Fudge Flies if you have them around. And he'll just sleep about anywhere. He’ll keep out of your way, I promise.”
--I could keep you from harm." Snape continued despite looking like the words were getting stuck in his throat. "You are a great importance to me."
“I’m an only child as well. Don’t worry about it. It’s not that big of a deal,” Draco said, mindlessly twirling his wand in between his fingers.
"Harry Potter is at the door asking for you," Cho said, her voice held envy and other people who were studying turned to them. Draco decided to wait till the time comes to worry about Chang.
"Are you excited for the end of the term?" Snape asked, his usual bland tone revealing nothing about actual interest in the topic.
"Harry?" Draco's mother turned around towards him. Her eyes looked down at his bloody robes, then travelled up to his scar. She saw Ron trying bat Lockhart's hands away from his dirt riddled hair. She looked back at Draco, an obvious question in her eyes:
Draco’s eyes widened. Then he grinned that amazing smile that’s captivated Harry since he was eleven and on the cold floor in front of the Mirror of Erised.
The line began to shudder and fluctuate. The goblet spat aggravated, wispy, red flames circling around the cup but didn’t know what to do. He hastily shuffled outside of the perimeter.
Draco turned and saw men with wild hair, dark eyeliner circling their eyes, overlapping leather bracelets that reached their elbows, and dangling earrings climb on a stage. Tonks is going to lose her mind when he tells her about this.
Harry sighed and laid back on the floor, still grasping onto the frustration from his interrupted dream. He rubbed his hands over his face, feeling an underlying burn in his cheeks. This was getting out of hand. Way too out of hand
Narcissa squeezed her son’s shoulder, keeping him close to her as they pushed through the crowds of people at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. “Draco, you’ll be careful this year won’t you?” she asked seriously, watching parents reluctantly let their children onto the scarlet red train.
“...Alright then.” Draco quickly jumped into the carriage after Michael. Unconsciously, he wrapped his arms around himself when he settled down. There was a very strong suspicion that it wasn't good to see the thing pulling him up to Hogwarts.
“Harry, I need you to trust me with this,” Draco placed a hand on Harry’s forearm. “You are not going to die. Understand? It's going to take something much more than a dog to kill you.” The blond didn't want to get into specifics.
That's when Draco made his move. He slapped Harry's hand away and stood up, making the chair scrape against the floor. "I've had enough of this. Just—completely done." Having Harry's sweaty hand keeping him from speaking was the last thing he wanted to put up with. "I need to go." He pushed past Hagrid to get to the door.
Draco explained Harry’s misplaced feelings for him, how he knows that he’s hurt Harry in the process, how he wondered how this would affect Harry’s feelings if he doesn’t get his act together.
Viktor Krum seemed charmed enough by Padma's dancing, Cedric and Cho only had eyes for each other, Harry looked visibly uncomfortable trying to dance with Parvati. Paravati's dancing held a smooth grace while Harry's was stiff and awkward. Draco winced as Harry’s foot clearly stepped on her toes. He moved his attention away to make sure he didn’t do the same to Fluer’s toes.
"Oh, I thought that George and Fred were—I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley. Who are you?" Draco looked away from the rolling hills to see that they were both looking at him.
“What are all of these extra presents?” Lucius asked when the gift-giving was dwindling. There were gifts that had bright coloured wrapping different from the others.
“I don’t believe that.” Granger getting cold feet, give me a break. "I know for a fact that Millicent doesn't sound like that." Days in the Slytherin Common Room burned her gruff voice into a distant part of his brain. Minutes ticked by, the silence never wavering. Minutes…minutes… Draco was leafing through the potion book when Granger gave a strangled groan.
Flitwick yelped. The Ravenclaws gasped and Dumbledore told them to head to the Great Hall immediately.
That morning was the first morning in a long while that he felt refreshed after sleeping. A few days ago, the students returned back from holiday break and returned to their skittish ways of being afraid when Draco so much as breathed. He was in the corridor, heading to the library to study with Anthony when someone tapped his shoulder. When he went to look he was surprised to find—
"Not because of them. You're kind of famous, you know? There's not many 'Harry's in the Wizarding world."
"How did Draco get like this?" He suppressed the shiver he got from looking down at Draco's motionless body.
“Now,” Aunt Andromeda cupped his face. “Have a good year, dear. Be good,” She dropped a kiss into his hair. “Be safe.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked up. Ron abruptly emptied his seat next to Harry and moved beside Hermione.
Draco slammed his hands against the table. He pushed away from the table and ran out of the room. He vainly tried to stomp his feet on the soundless marble stairs. At least he gave his door a satisfying slam.
Many on top of the tree were greyed, obvious to show that they weren’t around anymore. Draco was surprised to see some of his ancestors were held on frail, withered branches as if no one would care if they suddenly broke one day.
“Oh, look how much you’ve improved!” Andromeda gushed. She patted his cheek. “Your mother will be so proud.”
Draco knows for a fact that none of his family wasn’t under any type of curse during the war. He dug his fingers into his left forearm.
," and the tape fell off. Potter's glasses were shiny and looked as good as new. "Isn't that better?" Potter took off his glasses, looking at them in awe. While that was happening, they didn't notice that the train had begun moving. The compartment door opened for the third time and Ron Weasley peeked in.
Marriage was a strange concept for Draco to wonder about. After sixth year, Lucius told him about his arranged marriage and didn’t protest with the constant loom of fearing for his life. Marriage in his family was a business. A business to uphold the sacred purity of the bloodline. To not do so will leave you with nothing. He couldn’t imagine throwing away everything because he loved someone so much. Draco had very little nerve when it came down to it. He could never see himself make such a declaration for the sake of love.
“Stop whining we're here," Terry said, standing beside a large oak tree. He sat down and laid up against it. "It's one of my favourite spots here at home. To nap mostly, but the view can be nice sometimes."
Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table to see Ron shaking Harry’s shoulder as if demanding an answer. Harry, feeling eyes on him, met Draco’s gaze before turning away quickly. Harry’s answer must’ve been unsatisfying because Ron slapped a hand on his forehead while Harry stared down to his plate, his face going pink.
There were more important things to worry about. "I don't even know why I'm here. I'll figure this out on my own."
Draco swallowed thickly. He knows better, he learned his lesson, he didn’t have a reason to actually be afraid. He knows the etiquette of these animals.
The conclusion made him feel giddy, his stomach doing flips that had become familiar at this point. The crush he's been nursing on Draco since they'd visited the Mirror of Erised last year has been slowly growing out of control. It took a huge leap of confidence and hope to write the letter in the first place. He had ended up backing out on it and left it in his dormitory... but then Lockhart's dwarfs ransacked for letters and apparently found his.
“You know what I mean, Tonks.” Draco moved away to look up at her. “They had their second chance and they threw it away. I can’t ignore how much this changes everything. And how I did nothing to stop it.”
With old practice, Draco prowled the compartments and dragged a door open when he saw a familiar face.
“No… I actually don’t feel well…” Draco felt light-headed and his stomach was unsettled as if nothing would stay down if he tried to eat something. "I might catch up later, but I don’t know. Sneak some candy for me?”
Later that night on the same day, Draco was listening to Chang’s explanation of Ravenclaw’s best strategies and bits of information she learned about the other captains (specifically about the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood).
"Yeah." They watched the Weasleys try to situate themselves as they gave farewell hugs before boarding the train. "They called you a Malfoy," Potter said after a while.
The blond grabbed the mirror and scrutinised his reflection. Painted initials of Viktor Krum’s name were on one cheek while the other had Krum's player number. He wrinkled his nose. “I don’t like it.”
Draco moved off the dancefloor and watched from the sidelines. He found Ron and Hermione taking their positions on the ballroom floor.
"You know I love you, don't you?" It took more power than necessary to not look surprised at the comment.
that. But… I couldn’t risk it. Because-Because I couldn’t risk it! Draco, you mean so much to me. I've liked you for forever! Alright, I spent countless nights wondering if it was okay to think that my best friend had the most pretty eyes I’ve ever seen or—or why my stomach felt like knots every time you were even near. Or why I was obsessed when you tucked your hair behind your ear and it would just fall back in place! I don’t even know how many times I tried to tell you before the Yule Ball and you never even noticed. If anything, that should’ve told me to get a clue that--"
“Your father has been through some changes after last year. Didn’t he tell you that he was going to try to be a better father?” Draco closed his eyes and shook his head.
It was the next morning. Draco had spent the good part of the night thinking how he now thinks of Harry as a friend. He shivered at some parts, thinking back to when they first genuinely met compared to now. From their past of fights, detentions, name calling to Draco crying in his arms and thanking Harry (to actually
“This morning, something happened from my original timeline, but it wasn’t me that caused it. It was as if the universe suddenly made up someone out of thin air… and they took my spot. Am I not needed anymore?“
"It only took a few moments of him talking before I poured out my life to him. I was so eager to talk to someone..." his eyes were glassy when he face Harry. "I never wanted to hurt anybody." his sight drifted over to the beds that used to hold Hermione and the sixth year Ravenclaw. His tone was different at the end like he was talking about something more than just the attacks.
“Alright,” Draco answered as he watched the Snitch floated into Michael’s open palm and went dormant. “How did you make it do that?”
They sat down on a fallen tree beside the Great Lake. Neither Harry nor Draco said anything for awhile.
Fletcher Nil wandered around the emptied corridors, yawning and stretching his arms over his head. He preferred the corridors when they weren’t packed with students who wouldn't just shut up over the lame Triwizard Tournament. What was even exciting about it anymore?
“I’ve… been a mess. I worry, constantly. I never worried for anyone but me and my family before. It's a... new experience.”
Harry was important to him. After knowing what it was like to be on the same side as Harry, he couldn’t go back to the opposite. And if Draco thought about it too long, he’d be reminded that Harry was too all-encompassing. He was the Boy Who Lived, an annoyingly loyal friend, someone who adored his godfather with the feeling returned, adored by everyone at the end of the day.
Weasley. No matter how many times Weasley tried to say that it was safe because Moaning Myrtle, the ghost that haunted a toilet in there, warded away any trespassers. Draco wanted to say Myrtle warded him away too. With winter breezes showing, the tiled bathroom had a chill to it as well.
Draco thought about it, a horrible muggle aunt who became a human ball and lift up into the sky. A smile broke when he huffed a laugh. Then a chuckle spilt out until it was laughter.
Harry’s reaction was instant with a stumble in his step and dropping his bucket of water he was carrying onto the ground. The three stopped as they jumped away from spilt water with shouts of surprise.
He felt like an intruder. When they invited him to have breakfast, he barely ate anything, feeling like the wasn't enough circumstances that allowed him to be at the kitchen table. He kept to the bedroom, hesitantly pulling out an innocent book and skimming through it. Draco messed around with the 'light switch' that he had a distant understanding of. He flicked it on and off with mild amusement for a few hours.
“He’s only a boy, Andromeda,” Narcissa was saying. “He is not going to be part of this. Both I and Lucius swore by this.”
"I—I'm your best friend?" He couldn't help the awe and wonder from coming out in his voice. "But what about Weasley—"
Draco’s heart dropped. Barty Crouch Jr was telling the truth. His father returned to his Death Eaters duties. Because of Draco. He's back.
"He'll come around, Hermione. You don't need me to interfere. Give him time to think about it. Besides... Harry doesn't need me to inspire him to do the right thing."
“Son, care to join me on a trip to the shops?” Uncle Ted asked, walking out from the kitchen to the living room, pulling on his jacket. “I know you like hanging around the entrance to watch the doors.”
“Mister Malfoy, Mister Potter,” Trelawney said over her shoulder from her position over Longbottom’s shoulder. “Clear your mind, if you will.” Draco couldn't really ‘clear his mind’ as her words made Draco off-kilter, but he settled down anyway.
Draco blinked and searched around him as if he briefly forgot where he was. He found himself in a Quidditch stand watching Gryffindor practice.
"It's to keep it fair because what if he slips and tells Fleur something or he tells us something about Fleur. This competition is already skewered. Now come on, we have to do our own research now!" She declared, pulling at Harry and Ron's sleeves and dragging them off towards the library.
When the window opened, the a handsome owl flew in, landing on his bed with a letter. Hogwarts. A pleased smile came to him. Carefully, he untied the letter from the owl's foot. When the letter was relieved, the owl flew quickly out of the window. Draco shrugged, tearing at the Hogwarts seal. The usual list was required was inside alone with another slip that fell onto his bed. Hogsmeade. New excitement heightened his mood. He'll love to go back to the candy shop maybe he can show Harry--the rest of his friends. He grabbed the pieces of parchment, glanced at the mirror to see if he looked presentable (he hated how his face was still trying to cling to childhood roundness), then flew through the hallways.
Lupin then turned towards them, teeth bared as he stalked towards them. Snape moved in front of them, spreading his arms out. Draco clutched at Harry tighter. Lupin snapped his jaws and lunged before Sirius intercepted, his dog form looking painfully smaller than Lupin. The scuffle between them was drastically unbalanced. Lupin bucked Sirius off and dashed into the forest. Sirius shook his head as if to clear it and also sped off into the wood.
He once joined Ted on a trip to the ‘supermarket.’ (He got scared of the sliding doors but then proceeded to hover near the entrance to watch it open and close. He adored the idea of doors opening up for him just by his mere presence.)
“Father,” Draco said with confidence he didn’t have. “I’ve come to apologise for my outburst during--” He wasn’t able to finish as Lucius already came around his desk and wrapped him in a hug.
Draco pressed his lips together in thought. He didn’t feel like dumping information on everyone would be the smart decision. Not only did Draco not know specifics like what happens in the Second Task or Third Task, but his friends also didn’t need to be imposed with the terrifying thought that someone would legitimately
Professor Moody flinched as he turned around. There was a flask in his hand. "Ah, Mister Malfoy. What brings you here?"
The group pulled Draco into Honeydukes. Students seemed to almost crawl over one another at its fullness, but Ron elbowed his way to the shelves, hauling Draco with him.
“Because we have this." Draco gestured to the lake. "We both have each other to talk with, to be friends with, to help each other out. We do have this right?" Draco asked more for his benefit than anything else.
"What are you talking about?" Draco followed him. Harry seemed to forget that he was there and turned back to him, smiling so widely it looked like it hurt.
Draco hasn’t felt uncomfortable around Harry for a long time. Nothing about this will be strange. It couldn’t. They were friends. And Draco liked that they were. (Harry already saved his
"Draco!" He relaxed when he heard Michael's voice and a hand clamping down on his shoulder. "Where were you? We looked around, but I guess not hard enough." Anthony and Terry surrounded him as well.
Draco shrugged his shoulder. "It's like a... pet oddly. You stroke its spine and it falls to sleep. Hag--The professor must be quite a character this year."
Anthony pressed his lips together, Terry crossed his arms and hunched his shoulders, Michael scratched the back of his head.
"It's probably nothing-" A cloaked figure jumped out of the bushes and ran off into the denser part of the trees.
It was a fun scenario in his head but for it to be presented without warning and from someone he wasn’t expecting just… freaked him out.
Fleur, as promised, was waiting at the bottom of the staircase. Her white-jewelled speckled bodice flowed into her silver-grey satin dress with a matching chiffon shawl. Her golden blonde hair fastened in a star-like hairpin.
“Hey,” Harry eased further into the room and closed the door. “Um, Sirius told me you wanted to see me.”
attack," she said in a soft voice as they approached the infirmary. Harry felt his stomach shift as they stepped into the bright Hospital Wing.
“I know the risks that I'm taking,” Lucius gritted out. “But I managed to speak to Pettigrew while he was still at the Ministry. He changes everything. He's heard things. About... him. He is still out there… He must be angry and doubting our loyalty for never finding him. If I help him with this now, then he'd show us mercy when the time comes.”
"With... her... blowing up into a balloon-like state and seeing a new view of the neighbourhood." Harry said slowly.
Draco turned back to Harry. His stomach turned over as he turned away towards the window. “Well, I’m not exactly the best outlet.”
After sneaking around, he reached the closed doors of the Great Hall. As he reached out towards the oversized iron ring door pull, the door opened and Professor Moody eased himself out.
It took Draco a long time to compose himself, dozens of emotions trying to squeeze his throat. He angrily wiped at the runaway tear, steeling himself as he tore out of his reprieve and sped towards the Quidditch pitch.
Well, that was true. Hermione, frazzled at the crowdedness, helped Draco decide on what sweets to get.
The grim kept a steady gaze on him as a man with matted hair and tattered clothing took its place. Draco’s eyes blew wide.
"Draco?!" Tonks cried, trying to flip onto his back. "Are you there? What's wrong? Whatever it is, fight it! I know you can!" She yelped and cradled Draco to her chest as another spell shot mere inches away from her head.
"Draco," a stern voice called out to him. Snape was at the end of the hallway, looking like a shadow in black robes.
"Fred, George, enough!" Mrs Weasely snapped. "I, for one, am very proud of you, dear," she walked past Ron and patted his cheek.
"No. No, I just needed--wanted to say goodbye and, and nothing," Draco forced a smile. "I don't know what I'm thinking."
“And we just need…” Flitwick looked around the common room once more. “Ah, Miss Chang! May you also come with me?”
"Excuse me, do you have room?" A soft, fluttery voice came from the door. Blonde hair falling all the way to her back, her black robes rumbled with messy colourful shirts sticking out and necklaces were taking the place of her tie.
A throat cleared at the doorway. Harry was standing there, patting at his messy hair. (Draco always wondered why Harry did that, he meant it when he said his hair was fine.)
Fletcher was walking away from the busy streets of the village down towards the Shrieking Shack, alone. Draco followed after the Slytherin, wondering where Crabbe and Goyle were. Why would Fletcher be alone?
? Now that was definitely not a topic that Draco thought of in this new timeline. It wasn’t in his last life. He never even thought of it.
The blond took his hand away and flew down to the ground where the Ravenclaw captain was dismounting. He ran a frustrated hand through his sweat-dampened hair.
Thank you for reading, comments are amazing pick-me-ups so don’t be afraid to leave one and I’ll see you all soon :)
"I'm... sorry." Draco cast his eyes down. It was a trick that he's learned to make Anthony forgive him for just about anything.
"Sis, lookie, it's the Firebolt!" a young boy's voice made Draco stop in front of a window, where little children already pressing their faces in the glass.
“He didn’t even take points away.” Harry stage-whispered when the boys started walking once more. “We broke the rules and didn’t even get punished for it.” Harry looked over at Draco as if he was a mythical creature. “It’s never
“Running away from someone right after they confessed seems like a rejection to me, Anthony! Does it not to you? Sorry, sorry. I’m just--” Harry groaned and made to bury his face into his hands again before recoiling. “Oh, gross,” He scowled and brought his foot up.
Draco was still mulling over the dismissal as he sat in a gaudy red Gryffindor Room, supposedly doing a study session.
Harry eyed Draco’s cup. “Uhm, so this… looks like… some sort of a flying angel which means…” Harry flipped a few textbooks pages before his eyes widened. “Oh.” He looked up briefly to Draco but tore his gaze back down to the page.
jab about Granger being a Mudblood. He saw green light and Weasley double over next to him gagging up slugs, but he could barely acknowledge it.
“Now, your father still wrapping his head on the idea of changing himself. He will have slip-ups, don’t be fooled. And so will you.” She pushed Draco’s hair off his forehead. “But that occurs with growth, doesn't it?
Terry did a doubletake between him and the Hufflepuff table. “Were you—Were you looking at Cedric Diggory?”
"Goodbye, love." Narcissa planted a kiss on his forehead before giving him a gentle smile. "Have a good first year. Send letters."
A hand clapped his shoulder made Draco's skin jump off, heart pounding. He turned jerkily around to see Anthony. “Don’t
“The progress is never over since life is always shifting. It's been said before, Draco. The future’s not set in stone. We must understand that part of us and continue the work. To show that we do not follow our ancestors. Draco,” Aunt Andromeda reached out to cover his hand with her own. “Know that we have to understand that are doing what we can. You are not your father who made the choice. Whether or not he thought it was for you, it was still him who did so without your input. Do you understand?"
“We used my dad’s flying car and drove ourselves here… We sort of… crashed into the Whomping Willow…”
The blond looked up to see her and Ron standing over him. “Where’s Harry?” He glanced over to an empty third space.
Now that Draco wasn't looking at Michael's facepaint through a mirror, he could clearly see that 'BULGARIA' was written completely, utterly backwards.
Granger didn't joke when it came to exams. She kept nagging the other three to start working out study schedules and color coding their notes.
“He's a friend," Draco said. The boy just kept looking straight at the blond, an eyebrow raised in disbelief.
happen. Like a certain pathway into the nearby future. And, most of the time, I’ve gone off to try to change that and that leaves to the future to be something completely new.”
The Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood, was already there and spitting about how he “booked the field” when he finally arrived.
Trelawney clutched at her shawl, taking slow steps towards Draco and Harry’s table. “My dear child,” she said slowly as Draco became more bewildered. Trelawney sighed once more and seized Draco hands, her fingers inhumanly warm against his. “My dear child, are you well?”
Hermione’s dot wandering around the library, Anthony’s heading towards Ravenclaw Tower, Ron and Terry hovering around the Great Hall, Michael’s dot walking beside Ginny Weasley’s. It even showed the Durmstrang headmaster, Igor Karkaroff, walking beside Viktor Krum. (Madame Maxime's was oddly walking beside Hagrid’s.) Even showing Barty Crouch leaving the Defense Against the Dark Art’s classroom.
He didn’t even understand the whole Sirius Black problem anyway. And it was noticeable to Potter who didn’t want that type of help.
“I suppose this leads to further questioning, doesn’t it?” Dumbledore suggested, watching Promfrey flutter over Harry and Sirius and turning back around to walk Hermione to her own bed.
Fragile steam rose from two teacups. Professor Lupin pushed one saucer towards the blond uncomfortably sitting in one of Lupin’s chairs.
"I can't believe I never found anyone guilty!" Draco bit, storming down the corridors with the three Gryffindors trailing after him, hesitant to face him while in this state. "Am I just an idiot? It must be it because it's probably in front of my face and I was too much of an idiot to see!" He stepped out to the courtyard and rested against the trunk of a large tree. He scrubbed his face and sighed. "I’m so sorry, Harry. I think I was on the brink of something before they announced the names.”
"But, I was being stupid and I would like to start new." She held out her hand. "Hello, my name is Hermione Granger, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"SHHH! Listen--come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbititn' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh-"
Nothing was making sense to Harry. The hidden meaning behind the boy's words was going over Harry's head. Riddle was saying all these things about Draco, but they couldn't be true. Yet, Riddle was standing there a gleaming grin on his face like his words were nothing if not true, but they
Turning his head wildly he saw stands looming over them with cheering crowds, a dock crowded with officials and champions wrapped in towels.
“Oh. No.” Harry smiled too widely. “No, no way. I’m not jealous of you.” Despite saying this, Draco noticed that Harry’s eye twitched. “Just curious.
Draco was bumping elbows with Anthony and Michael in the stands of the Quidditch field. "So, if Slytherin and Gryffindors are enemies; are we enemies with Hufflepuffs?" Michael said out loud as the teams were still in the locker rooms.
Draco pointed behind him to the direction Fleur headed. "She asked me to double-check if she was choosing the right books from the library. They were from the magical creature section."
They stood there, taking in the warmth from each other’s hand. Draco’s heart still hasn’t slowed down.
Draco’s mother arched a perfect eyebrow. The red-haired woman flattened her flyaway curls under her hat, clearing her throat.
Tonks startled at his loudness. “Yeah… It's standard procedure for all released inmates of Azkaban. I have to check in with him twice a week. It’s kinda pointless given that Black’s completely innocent. I think they stuck me with the job because I’m new. Where did you think I was going all this time?"
When class ended, Draco didn’t glance at Harry and Ron’s table. (It took a lot more effort than it should’ve.)
“Excellent, then it’s settled.” Terry declared, stuffing his fork into his mouth. He turned beside him where a blonde girl was sitting. “Hey, Lovegood, can you past the cookies?” He asked with a filled cheek.
“Come, son, let’s get you home,” Lucius said, putting an unsure hand on Draco’s shoulder to lead him away.
“I don’t know about that anymore. He told me that he’d try to get over me. I've heard him call us friends at the last D.A. meeting before holiday."
Draco thought about this year. Nothing from this year has been any different except for… himself. Still, Draco was in Slytherin when Black attacked Gryffindor. How did Draco becoming a Ravenclaw caused him to attack somewhere else? What could’ve happened differently this time?
Before memories could start attacking him, he shook his head. Rubbing one side of his temple with his fingers to ward away an oncoming headache. "Okay... I’m just going to find Anthony.” Draco pointed a thumb at the direction he was going. "I’ll see you later. Good luck on the game, Harry." Without stopping, Draco walked away. He never heard of the Sorcerer's Stone before, and he really wanted to keep it that way.
"Save it. It's not that — it's—" He looked at Weasley and Granger looking at him oddly from the table. Hagrid gulping down tea as Harry giving him a pleading look.
He has rarely been in the Headmaster’s office. It was only the times in fifth year he has seen it and it was under someone else's decorating (who had an obsession with pink and cats). Odd objects and portraits of past Headmasters took up every spot on the wall. There was a phoenix on a golden perch by his desk. It was old, shriveled like an old prune.
"It's this mirror I found. I can see my mum and dad in it." Draco wracked his brain, finding nothing in his memory that served as a magic mirror to see dead people.
“I might not look like it and I don’t expect you to believe me, professor, but what I say is true. I know much more than I am supposed to. I know things are going to happen, but they are not happening correctly.” He caught himself.
The tower door opened and a first year recoiled out of the way for Scabbers to escape down the stairs.
say that term ended somewhere around the 19th which means Anthony had to celebrate/observe Hanukkah before the term ended. If anyone has corrections on how to celebrate Hanukkah on their own or if my description was inaccurate, feel free to leave a comment saying so and I’ll edit it! If any can give support to the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting and their families, it can be donated through a
“Mister Malfoy?” Draco's shoulders jumped and his head shot out to see Professor Lupin hovering above him. The teacher's eyes were drooped and tired but alert with concern.
There was a special sting of guilt when he would look out the window and see Hedwig staring him down. When Draco would go and relieve her letter, she would sit and stare at Draco as if waiting for him to compose a response right there. It left Draco’s own owl taking initiative and ushering the snowy owl away (no doubt the beginnings of bad blood were being created).
“I’m not mad.” Draco’s forehead creased. Specks of snow slipped into his scarf and he vainly tried to rearrange it. “Why would I be mad?”
“The safety of our lives isn’t overrated to me.” Terry turned to the last blond boy, hoping for support. “Draco, back me up here. You know how dangerous this sort of thing is. Talk some sense into them.”
doesn’t need to know what we do. Go in your corner and read your stupid books like a good Ravenclaw.”
He pointed his wand—once again—at Potter’s forehead which made the other boy's breath hitch and his eyes go wide. "Relax. I'm not going to hurt you." Without warning, Draco muttered, "
"Hah! So--So you're working for--him." Then the information caught up to him. "Wait--You're with him? But you're--you used to be an Auror. Hold on, who's your father? What are you..."
“Exactly! Relax harder! Don't think of me as me and don't think about trying to be exactly on time.”
"That's how it usually goes," Mr Boot said as he poured Draco a glass of orange juice before returning to his seat at the head of the table.
"No! No, no. Just... I thought you hated me..." Harry stopped walking. “You’ve avoiding me for the last few weeks." Draco stopped walking.
Draco glanced down as if didn’t know he was wearing Mrs. Weasley’s Christmas gift. He didn’t put on his uniform on the train as an excuse to wear it longer. The soft material and knowledge that it was specifically his made it difficult to take off.
"Well, that's stupid. But if your dad is really the way my dad always goes on about, I'll be wishing you luck." Weasley looked out the window of the moving train.
Draco walked the length of the platform, trying to find an entrance that wasn’t congested with people.
"Uhm, yes, thank you, Luna." Draco tried to stop shaking as he took the diary out of her hands. “I've... been looking all over for it." He wanted to shove the diary back at her and run in the other direction as fast he could.
"I'm fine." He left it at that. He felt someone staring at him that wasn't the student who inquired after him.
Harry shook his head. “You’re not the only one who regrets saying awful things. I said I’d trust you from now on… Which I did not do. It wouldn’t be wrong for you to start hating
“You save me too much.” Draco took the offered hand and let Harry haul him up. “I thought you weren’t allowed to come,” he asked, brushing off the snow.
He saw Harry looking sad throughout the weeks and that made him want to just forget about things and help him out. He was close one time, but Anthony hauled him away.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, letting his hand wipe clean on his robes. “You think you can help me tomorrow?”
"Who is Tonks to you? Because I’ve been writing to her describing you. She says she doesn’t think you’re acting like yourself. And Tonks respects you too much to not say those things lightly. And I know something’s up with you so… So who are you, professor? I know you’re not right. I’m certain, I’m not going to let you get away.”
The spider felt the brief moment of suspension, the feeling of being weightless before the world swallowed in black in a blink.
Hermione's hand went up. "Professor, aren't those spells banned from being discussed in a classroom?"
“Draco! Thought we wouldn’t catch you today! We have so much to tell you!” Weasley said and Harry stood up straighter as if to add more height to himself.
“Arthur, may I speak with you?” Draco managed to hear his father ask before Ron roped him under his arm to jump in celebration.
As an apology for not giving the proper updates...  I was thinking of dropping a side story in Harry’s POV of him between chapter 24 and this chapter of him getting to live with Sirius during the summer and pining hard over Draco… Let me know what you think!
Terry gave him a look and his eyes flicked over to Anthony and Michael who had a face of vague confusion.
“I’ll say… that there is a monster. Been out for Scabbers since day one. The poor lad,” Ron said lamentably, tugging his rat closer to his chest. Draco eyed Ron's pet with its dropping whiskers and its fat, grey body and seeming to be dead save for the slight movement to show Scabbers was still breathing. Draco wrinkled his nose.
have it said out loud. I absolutely despise my full name! It’s—OH, YOU PRICK!” He tore his hands away to wipe at his licked palm.
“Honest?” Anthony chuckled in disbelief. “Alright, I won’t question it. It’s great to see you, too. But you’re really okay, right? I saw the papers about the World Cup. You’ve heard from Michael, haven't you?”
"How exactly do they sort us into houses?" Potter asked Draco. The blond ignored the students around him that leaned in as he explained. Having everyone look at him for guidance was not something he was used to.
Lockhart's bottom lip trembled as he was turned out of the room, muttering incoherently as McGonagall shoved him out and closed the door.
Ron’s head popped in. “How about we all sit together now?” He asked, already letting himself inside.
The three boys were taken aback, seeing Draco’s teary eyes. Draco felt a dark flush of frustration on his ears.
What was he thinking? The universe liked to be funny with him, it never wanted to do what he wanted. Harry said that he still liked him but how could he think that Harry would—
“Yeah, anything exciting happening?” Ron asked. “Tell us a prophecy you have or whatever you call it!”
Draco was rigid in his seat at the kitchen table, his eyes glassy as Aunt Andromeda moved around the counter to assemble a tea set.
Draco and Ron shared a look but Ron shrugged and went around the room to sit next to Harry a few seats down.
They walked out of the bronze-eagled door, down the staircase, and down the corridors. Scabbers made a weak sound of a wheeze in Draco’s hold.
“What are they—I’ll handle this, tell the others I’ll be there in a minute.” He left a confused Terry and gave Crabbe and Goyle a vague nod of his head to follow him.
One afternoon, Draco was at Hagrid’s hut, trying not to grimace at Hagrid’s planned trial outfit that had a yellow-and-orange tie when Hermoine rushed in sniffling and her eyes red.
“Dad said that? Why?” Ron shifted Scabbers in his hands. “And if he thinks that Black’s after you... why does he think that you’d go after him?”
“Fine, fine. I’m fine.” Draco used the wall to help him get to his feet. “Just--I’m fine.” He took deep breaths, committed to not look at the teacher.
Draco fought over the large crowd and escaped and found them at Hospital Wing. Harry was already in a bed with two chairs pushed up to the bedside seating Granger and Weasley. Harry's entire arm seemed deflated.
Terry clicked his tongue in annoyance. "Look, we don't know where he's going to be! That lunatic is probably heading to Hogwarts as we speak!”
Harry’s demeanour cooled. He uncomfortably shifted in his seat. “Lines. That wasn’t the bad part, it was the principal.”
They stopped walking so Harry could look back at the boy. The corners of Draco's mouth was lifted up. Harry abruptly realised that he and Draco were
"I got into a... argument with my family of muggles. Specifically, my uncle's sister who both hates me and magic." Harry said ruefully.
sorry that this is terribly late, but with that aside, I never mentioned these works on here and I wanted to make sure everyone knew about them!
“I don’t see why not. They look nice together. Who says--Weird Sisters!” Terry grasped Draco’s arm. “Weird Sisters! It’s the Weird Sisters!”
“Thank you, Mr. Weasley, but I think I’m about to go.” Draco felt tired anyway. He peeked around the man. “Where is my father anyway?”
“Good.” Harry withdrew his hand. “I, er, I think I hear Sirius calling for me.” He awkwardly walked around Draco to get to the door.
“Bow, mate,” Terry whispered and Draco took a deep breath. The blond’s eyes focused on Buckbeak’s yellow eyes and bent himself at the waist.
Ron and Hermione were on the floor, Ron was laying down with his head cradled in Hermione’s lap, her arms crossed over his chest. They were giggling about something.
“I’m just—happy. I don’t know how else to explain it. I’ve never had a summer as great as this one before. It feels like everything’s coming together. I just…” Harry trailed off as his gaze settled on Draco.
Fletcher frowned, his gaze darting back and forth between Malfoy’s eyes, scrutinizing. “What’s wrong with you?”
"What? No way. You've seen her notes when you pass her in the Common Room, right? Doodles of badgers.
The whistle blew and everyone shot up into positions. Draco couldn’t even see Harry’s figure as he sped around the Quidditch field. The crowd roared at the sight of seeing a Firebolt in action, but Draco set his jaw and shot towards the boy.
“Hey." Harry cleared his throat. "So, I, er, I saw one of the Beuxbatons students talking to you during the feast.”
“Thank you, Hagrid. I’m fine, really, just--boys are idiots.” Hermione set her bulging book bag on the table. “No offence,” she added towards Draco.
“Well, it’s simple then. I don’t put my name in the goblet,” Harry said. “Then I won't get chosen. Right?”
They idly waited for the match to start. Other important Ministry wizards climbing up and taking their own seats, Lucius dutifully greeted them all. There was a commotion as the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione shuffled into their seats in the Top Box.
"Doesn't fix anything," Draco snorted. "But then again," he bit into another square. "nasty-tasting potions won't either. Or maybe so." Draco held out the chocolate. "Want some?"
"What viewpoint?" Draco asked. "You three act have been acting like this since first year! You three hide this weird version of a secret and I finally want to know what--"
Draco gasped as his head broke the Black Lake's surface. He rapidly blinked water out of his eyes as he coughed, his robes weighing him down along with Gabrielle’s strong grip to keep herself afloat.
Draco peered through the doors and found his mother’s back ridged as his father stared out the window, motionless. His reflection showed hollows were developing under his eyes.
Harry knew how to make a Patronus? Did Draco know that? What did Harry's Patronus look like? What did Harry think of when he conquered it? Did he think of people?
But now here he was, surrounded with fantastical sights. Each space of the camping grounds was squished with people and towering tents, loud noises of singing and laughing, people hanging up large flags and other extravagances of the country they were supporting, children sped passed, sparklers and ribbons fluttering from their hands. Draco was to find one specific boy at one of the biggest wizard gatherings in the world.
“If you ever send Michael to get me I’ll be after all of you,” Draco grumbled, sliding into a chair next to an eating Anthony.
“Draco, it’s fine.” Terry waved a hand. “We’re not mad about it. You didn’t want to talk about it and we shouldn’t have pushed.”
Despite the ache of colliding with the ground and being compressed with body weight, a laugh bubbled out of Draco. Merlin, his friends were so
Potter didn’t answer. Everything about his movements seemed hindered as if he was recovering from a severe blow.
Draco sat up in a flourish, finally processing the lowness of the sun. Did he just sleep the day away?
me, Anthony. I’m so scared about letting myself jump into this without knowing how it goes.” Draco felt himself wanting to laugh. “Because I don’t want it to end badly because all I’ve seen are bad endings. I don't want to give Harry a bad ending. So, please, tell me, Anthony, what to do because I don’t. I don’t know what to do. I’m tired of bad endings.”
tried to steal it. When word reached Draco, his fork clattered loudly on his plate. "Mate, it's okay. Potter's probably fine." Terry soothed, but Draco had no doubt about that, it was him that didn't feel fine. When he tried to visit the two in Hospital Wing, he was turned away because of all the Gryffindors were visiting.
Ugh, he hasn’t been this bad since first year. Every word coming out of him was clunky and abnormal. He should’ve thought this through before he opened his mouth. Maybe that was enough for today.
Pomfrey pursed her lips but didn't question it. “What about you, then?” She asked him. “Anything happen to you?”
"You sure about that?" The Weasley twins were behind Potter, giving him curious looks. Draco found that he wasn’t as completely over time travelling as he had thought, knowing what the fate for one of them would be. He closed his mouth and stared at them, not even saying anything as they stuck Potter’s trunk in the compartment.
"DRACO! It's already over! Gryffindor won!" His shoulders were being thrashed side to side. “That has to be the shortest match in all of history!” It was Michael speaking.
“Draco!” Setting the mirror down, Michael rushed towards the blond and marvelled at the sight of him. “Wow! I can’t believe it worked!” He cried out before giving him a hug. “It’s great to see you!”
it. A sense of normalcy back before everything happened. When all he really was a self-entitled brat that picked on Potter for the fun of it. At least he didn’t know anything back then.
The blond looked up to see Anthony's pinked face and windswept hair. “How did you know?” Draco asked, pushing up from his chair. He sensed that no more homework would get done now and gathered his rolls of parchment and textbooks.
"Yeah! It looks pretty great, doesn't it?" Michael cradled his chin with his thumb and finger. "And on the first try too!"
“I…” He didn’t think this through. “I don’t know how it happens, I just know it does. I want to say I knew how it happened but… er, that’s all my vision told me.”
Ron shrugged. “She said she’d meet me here. I think she wanted to fix her hair or something. If I'm being honest, I don’t feel so good.” He curled his arms around his stomach.
"You’re not going to do it?” Weasley said as he and Harry returned from plucking Crabbe and Goyle’s hair for the Polyjuice Potion. It was Christmas night, and everyone has finished going to the feast and now were at their dormitories, stomachs full.
“She’s right, but...” Draco started while looking over her shoulder, doing a once over of the ingredients, “most are in Snape’s private storage.” Maybe it was a lack of focus and his aching headache that made him say, “I could probably get them for you.”
"Sorry, sorry." Longbottom pried himself off of Draco and cast his nervous eyes all over the forest. Silence went between them. "Why have you been avoiding Harry?" that caused Draco so off guard that his foot snagged on a tree knot, causing him to trip slightly.
He furrowed his brow. “What are you--” A dry, unforgiving tree branch smacked into Draco’s chest. He flew back, colliding with hard ground and a flare of pain ached his side. Panicking shrieking made Draco loosened his tightened hold on Scabbers. Drawing in a deep breath found to be painful.
(Terry overheard from Granger that Potter looked all out of sorts the remaining days before the ball when he found out that Fleur Delacour was Draco's date.)
“Can I sit here?” Draco looked up to see Harry standing above him. Ron was pulling Hermione quickly pass them to sit at another empty roundtable of their own.
He also wrote to Harry frequently. About his abrupt displacement of living with his aunt and asking questions about Muggle contraptions that he was too embarrassed to ask his family, and asking Harry about his life with Sirius in order to distract himself from thinking about his parents.
“Father! It this really necessary?” Draco didn’t even complain about it! The only reason that Lucius did anything about it in the first place was because of Draco’s insistence. “It’s not it’s going to do anything important!” He remembered the rumours that the hippogriff escaped school grounds one day and that was the end of it. The Ministry dropped the case not long after. It was completely pointless! What was the
Draco felt sick as another boy pushed his way through the Slytherins. He’d never seen the boy anywhere before. Never. The boy had spiky, black hair with a pale, pinched face and huge teeth that made him look like a sick weasel.
“Don’t worry, I have a friend that also broke their family tradition, too,” Lupin said as if he was sharing a secret.
Draco expanded and collapsed the Marauder’s Map, mystified at the intricacy of the object. “I can’t believe your father made this. And all so they could slip away from professors? Stunning.”
"I'm fine," Draco said too quickly. He cleared his throat. "I mean, I'm fine. I need to say what I need to say."
“Wotcha,” Tonks said, crashing beside him on the couch. “Care for a sip?” she held her bottle of butterbeer.
Tom, who’s been helping him throughout this entire year. He told everything to him. Which is why he needed to get rid of it.
“Still I wasn’t always like this. I was actually an awful person too until… I realized how pointless it was to be so vain. It really doesn’t get you anything in the end.” Harry looked dubious at Draco as if he didn’t believe it so and Draco ducked his head down and cleared his throat. “But understand what you went through. Being isolated. Separated. I know what that feels like."
He reached the staircase that lead to the Fat Lady’s portrait. There was hesitance to see how he was going to get into the common room in the first place. A second-year Gryffindor running past him to go up the stairs answered his question. He was small, blond, and familiar.
He opened the book with more force than needed. The spine creaked with disuse, the smell of aged parchment reaching his nose. Draco thumbed the yellowed pages, seeing fragile photos stuck inside to show families stiffly standing close to fit in the frame, their movements to only smooth out a wrinkle on their dress or reposition their feet.
“Hermione! Please," he begged. "Don’t do this. I'm sorry, but not now. I’ll explain it later, I promise.”
"Anything for a friend..." Ron gasped, his face grew red. Professor Snape stiffly walked towards Harry.
“Draco, you’re all right!” Harry felt Draco's soft blonde hair on his cheek, and he pulled the boy closer.
He took the diary in one hand, ready to throw it in the fire. His arms didn’t move. Four more tries and he still couldn’t pry his fingers open to let go.
“Yes! You know why?" Terry started arguing with Michael and Anthony added to the noise by trying to placate the two. Gryffindor finally arrived and a confused Ron lead Harry and Hermione into the hall.
“Yeah, sorry about that.” Michael held up a guilty hand. “Stupid thing to say at the wrong moment. Complete shit thing to do.”
The game was called to be over with Gryffindor being the winner. When Draco managed to get on the field, the Gryffindor players came down and started surrounding Harry. He could hear Lockhart's voice and Harry's weak protests. The gasps that happened up in front made it obvious that Lockhart did something idiotic.
(“You’re not going to burn down the tower with that right?” Michael asked seriously one night. Draco was already tucked into bed, supposedly already asleep.
Draco turned away from the bickering trio, heading towards the newcomers, wondering if they had answers.
"Relax, you're fine," Draco whispered in his ear, pulling Potter’s arm back down. What possessed him to calm down Potter, he had no idea. Still, it made him stop,
"No... I don't really pay attention..." Draco didn't keep on top of his grades as much. Dreams and annoyance of the Golden Trio made him busy.
“Andromeda, I know none of this makes sense. You have every right to refuse me. But I want you to know… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Narcissa’s voice broke. “I didn’t do anything when you were cast out of the family. I did nothing to stop them. I didn’t stop Mother, Father, Bellatrix. I didn’t stop any of them. I just stood by and watched. And that makes it worse.”
that you’re hanging out with Potter, really, I am, but I cannot let you miss another Hogsmeade trip. You said that you’d go next time." Draco didn't know why he was hesitating but he was. "Come on, what kind of creature are you to not be at least
After their dance, Patil seemed annoyed with Harry’s clear disinterest and bad dancing that she walked away. Harry didn’t seem bothered and sat down by himself.
“No, it’s not yer fault. It’s me fault. I shoudn’ have done hippogriffs on th’ first day,” Hagrid wiped at a tear with a towel-sized handkerchief. “I pushed ye when I shouldn’ have. I set meself up fer disaster.”
"I'll see you on the Hogwarts Express," Draco told Ron and Hermione who were standing off to the side. They both nodded silently.
"No!" Draco said out loud, trying to stop himself from another memory attack. Anthony and Micheal stopped their conversation. “I mean—I haven’t seen anything like that.” Some other Ravenclaws were looking at him from his shout. He glanced all over the field. “Oh look—Dumbledore came to watch!" That caused all eyes to move away from him.
“I-I should get back before it gets dark.” Draco fumbled for the door. “I’ll see you again, Hagrid.” He wrenched open the door.
Harry himself felt his entire weight sink as he slid down to the wardrobe floor. Everything seemed muted. Everything felt...
“Hello... Mrs. Weasley.” He hasn’t spoken to her since their first meeting at Diagon Alley last summer. He could still feel his waxy smile pinching his cheeks as Mr. Weasley eyed him wearily until a breathless hug from Mrs. Weasley that claimed him to be “a good boy and a best friend of Ronald”.
Nothing was fine--Because his cousin was in danger--Fleur was in danger--Viktor was in danger--Cedric was in danger--Harry was in a danger.
Draco broke into a grin and ran towards the boy. He didn’t even hesitate to launch himself around the other blond’s neck. “Anthony!” His cry muffled in the boy's collarbone.
“What was the whole… interest with Cedric? Before you were cursed. Was it a vision? Did you see something?”
“Harry, get back this instant!” Lupin appeared in the doorway, his wand pointed at Black. Harry shuffled away as Lupin stalked forward.
Hermione seemed quite furious. “I can’t believe Professor Moody would even do such as thing! First showing those curses in a classroom and insinuating a student’s family history!”
“Is that a problem, Professor?” Draco frowned. He thought his godfather would be more accepting to Harry since he already saved his life not even a year ago.
"It's my favourite thing. I used to play a lot before--I started school." Draco finished shortly, his mood dimming. "I'd like to think I was good." Draco distractedly put the Charms spellbook in Harry's arms.
“Never mind. I—It wasn’t important.” Draco opened his mouth to continue but he thought better of it and hastily left the Great Hall without saying goodbye to Harry, Ron, or Hermione.
The door opened and Narcissa stepped inside. She walked to the foot of his bed and took a deep breath. “Draco, can you pack your bags?” she asked quietly, wrapping a hand around his bedpost.
"There's nothing to worry about. Snape might be rude, but he's not evil. He likes people to think he's cold so they can't misbehave."
Draco has the perfect view of Fletcher Nil. The boy was in near the entrance, far from Draco, slipping in a handful of unpaid candy into his pocket.
"Floo Powder. I wasn't speaking clearly." Harry shifted from foot to foot, trying to flatten his hair and rub off the soot, seeming embarrassed.
“Clear your head, forget all outside distractions.” Trelawney rested her inhumanly warm hands on Draco’s temples. His back straightened and his eyes widened with alertness. "And I want you to focus on the crystal ball."
waiting for Professor Binns to become entertaining), traded new interests they picked up over the summers ("
Draco took some consideration to clean up his appearance and poked around Ravenclaw Tower in search of a lantern. He crept down the tower minutes later and tiptoed around the corridors to reach the school grounds.
“Are you serious?” Michael laughed. “Draco, be reasonable! He must be one of the best flyers Hogwarts had in years. He joined the Gryffindor team in his first year!” Michael pushed his bangs off of his forehead. "There are reasons for that!"
When the door closed behind him. Draco blew out a long breath. He looked down at the hand that touched Harry’s.
“So glad that you’ve been blessed by titan goddess Phoebe to be here with me.” A misty voice called out through the opaque air.
It made Draco feel an uncomfortable combination of inadequacy, embarrassment, and shame. Draco should be the last person that Harry should feel like…
"Who could've stolen it in the first place? Only a Gryffindor could know the password," Hermoine said when Harry sat down with her in the Common Room.
That didn’t make Draco feel alright. Why did He have Harry Potter’s attention? He shouldn’t be getting attention.
Ron kneeled down in front of Draco. “Well, my mum won’t be friends with your mum if she didn’t think she was an alright person. And Dad says that your dad keeps to himself now and lets the actual department heads do their jobs. They seem less…. insufferable.”
The crystal ball was swirling dark grey clouds. Draco and Harry watched the glass ball with boredom. The dark-haired boy reached out to tap at the glass with a fingernail.
Before they left class for the day, he caught Colin in the corridor, trying to see if he could say what Draco told him.
As a reaction to his horrible performance during the Quidditch game, Draco was slowly filled with dread as February neared, bringing the match between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw with it. To distract himself, Draco worked on Buckbeak’s case with Hagrid and Hermione.
“Oh, boy.” Edward took a deep breath. “Yes. You can watch… performances? Here,” He went to the corner of the room where a… box was propped up. It had buttons and a shiny surface of black glass. He picked up a slim device riddled with buttons as well.
"Don't call me that!" Tonks snapped. "Draco's in this just as much as the rest of us so of course I thought he should be kept in the loop."
The two stopped suddenly in front of a compartment, the door slamming open with a yank. “Look who I found, lads!” Anthony declared.
Mounting brooms, they all flew up into the sky. Madam Hooch’s whistle shrilled and they sped off to their positions.
Snape’s eyes snapped back to the boy but he didn’t say anything about his interruption. “Yes, he said he’d like a chance to speak to the both of you privately.”
"I'll take him," Snape said, ducking beneath Lockhart's arm. Draco gave Harry and Ron one last look before Snape reached him and couldn't be seen behind the black robes.
"At this point," Hermione said. "I don't think we need to focus on that but more on the fact to prepare Harry for the First Task."
“Er, no, I just lost my train of thought for a minute there, sorry.” This is the first time, and maybe the only time, first year Draco apologised that wasn't forced. He felt someone staring at him.
“Wouldn’t be so sure about that,” Granger said and Weasley’s face dropped. “These ingredients are very rare.” She took the potion book back. “Plus, some need to be collected at a certain time. Like fluxweed needs to picked at the full moon and lacewings need to be stewed for twenty one days….”
Hermione readily replied, “The Triwizard Tournament is a competition that challenges three wizards from the European wizarding schools of Hogwarts, Durmstrang, and Beauxbatons.”
“I should probably get back by now. They must’ve finished plotting whatever it was.” Draco pushed out his seat, starting for the door.
“Right,” Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, that’s right. I don’t know why I asked that. Forget I said anything.”
“Probably the same time as you.” Draco shrugged. “When Snape taught the class that one day. Learning about the signs of a werewolf… it was obvious after that.”
Draco dropped to his knees, bracing his hands on the ground. A tension that Draco never noticed seeped out. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath of relief. Cedric was alive. That was more than Draco expected and thought was going to happen this year.
Tom’s diary curled in the fire, its pages rapidly turning into ash. An insane part of him wanted to save Tom from burning and think of every apology in the book to see if he could ever forgive Draco.
Professor Vector paced around the front of the classroom. Her heels clicking rhythmically against the flagstone, red robes smoothing behind her. She had the sophisticated look of an intelligent witch with her black hair knotted into a formal braid at her neck and with her shoulders pushed back with refined practice. Her sharp eyes enforced her “no-nonsense” aura. Her wand suddenly slipped out of her sleeve and into her hand and she waved it lazily. A stick of chalk rose and started writing on the board. The chalk created a chart with a sophisticated compilation of numbers and letters.
“What? I’ve always been here.” Hermione breezed, smoothing down her hair that was more frazzled than usual. She glanced down at Draco’s calculations. “Maybe you should try the other way for Harry’s name. Just to see the comparison,” she added when she got a suspicious stare.
Terry and Draco had a good time with Draco laughing at Terry’s outrageous dancing and screeching of the band members’ names between sets. Anthony and Luna briefly joined them but they disappeared off back into the crowd. Neither Ron nor Hermione approached them but Draco found it strange that Harry didn’t try to find them.
“We have to start somewhere, but we can talk about something else.” the blond hoped that Harry would open up to him about this. He wanted the closeness--the
“Eighteen! Eighteen! How bloody amazing is that?!” Michael all but yelled as he stood up. “Have you ever heard of a player do that before?”
“All right, all right. See? Look, I’m doing it,” Draco muttered as he opened the potion bottle and downed it one gulp. The blond suddenly felt a rush of warmth spread throughout his body as the potion settled in his stomach; it felt like he had swallowed fire, though the heat wasn't unpleasant. He uttered a breathless gasp as white smoke began pouring from his ears. He hastily grabbed for his goblet and starting downing his pumpkin juice in an attempt to quell the affects of the potion. He gave a relieved sigh when the smoke finally stopped.
A fifth-year Hufflepuff who was walking in the pub was knocked in the shoulder by an invisible force. Draco stood up from his table and went to trail what must’ve been Harry’s path. When Draco reached outside, he scanned the ground to see fresh snow prints going away from Hogsmeade.
Michael, Terry, and Draco made to leave but Anthony said, "Can one of you wait for me? Couple nights ago, I lost something in here and I want to look for it."
“What?” Harry asked in shock. “No. No, I’m not uncomfortable… I don’t know what to say… really… never really had to explain my life to anyone, everyone already has an idea.”
"What do you think the minister is here for?" Draco asked Harry but turned to see that Harry's seat was empty.
“Someone get that owl off of the rug,” Lucius ordered and a house-elf appeared and helped the owl onto their arm before exiting the room.
"Terry, mate, Hogwarts is the last place Black would want to go to,” Anthony said, forcing himself to laugh weakly. “We have Dumbledore. He's probably the most powerful wizard out there. Almost everyone in the world knows that. It’d be stupid to come to Hogwarts.”
"Quite, touching, isn't it?" Lockhart smiled at the two Gryffindors. "Also," he turned to Snape. "who are you?"
Edward picked up the tension in the room and turned to Draco. “Uh, son, why don’t I take you to the living room? I’ll put on the telly.”
As soon as they were out of ear-shot of any passing students, Draco turned around, having to look up to see the beady eyes of the Slytherins.
Snape narrowed his eyes at the boy before tilting his head up to look through the dusty window showing a blue sky. "Draco, I made a promise to your mother--to
Escaping from the people he knew, he ran blindly down the corridors, shocking Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang students alike.
Draco laughed. “But if I’m being serious, you’ve been holding up against the other champions well. I mean, with Cedric alone showing off his amazing transfiguration skills—”
The classroom was in disarray. Desks were toppled, educational trinkets were in pieces on the floor, the walls had soot marks from spells, the large creature skeleton that was strung on the ceiling was crumpled on the floor.
“Okay!” Creevey only grinned again, unknowing of the current rift between Harry and Draco. The Fat Lady’s portrait closed.
No sooner did Draco try to stomach down a few bites of food that the daily flurry of owls swooped in with an unusual amount of
"Fine." The anger drained and dissipated to tired disappointment. "This is suitable. I expect you to always be the top student and make trusts with Harry Potter." Draco almost fell out of his chair.
“Fame is a fickle thing, isn’t it?” Draco said, not helping the smile that came across his face. Harry looked at him for a moment, before turning his head away climbing the rest of the stairs in a flourish.
He read the letter once more, his face burning even more. Draco didn’t recognise the handwriting. It was smooth and neat, as if someone poured hours into making it look this nice.
“Oh, of course. Dobby will call you for dinner.” Narcissa watched from her seat as Draco didn’t give a backward glance as he left the room.
After a dizzying climb up a spiral staircase, Draco and the other first years were in front of a wooden door which contained no handle or keyhole, but a bronze knocker shaped like an eagle. Penelope Clearwater knocked once and the eagle's beak dropped open.
shocked and--and worried we were?" Micheal had a deranged facial expression of someone rudely disturbed from sleep. Terry was still trying to blink the sleep away from his eyes as he slumped on the bed across from Harry and Draco.
, that giving it to the blond would be a bad thing. He was about to refuse when Draco moved his eyes--
When the Weird Sisters said they were going to go on a break, Terry wiped the sweat gathered at his brow. “I’m beat. I’m going to find something to drink and sit down for a moment. Wanna join me?"
“Draco!" Narcissa cried, wrapping Draco in a hug, her knees landing hard on the floor. "My love, are you alright?” She ran a thumb over Draco’s wetted face.
“You know, a walk.” Draco dramatically rolled his eyes. “I'm sure you've heard of it. We could just... hang out around the Great Lake.” Suddenly, Draco couldn’t look Harry in the eye, and an unknown feeling of doubt crept into Draco’s stomach. “You don’t have to, of course. I’m not forcing you to do it. I just thought we could we could… spend some time together. Remember our promise from last year to hang out together.” Draco frowned at his own self. Nothing sounded bad what he said but it still didn’t feel right. Why does it seem he can’t even talk to a regular human being? How do friendships function like this?
Before the blond could answer, Fleur was at his side. “Draco! There you are! I want you to come with me to talk to ze other champions.”
“He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy. I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spells that Snape needs to break through-"
“Well, we can’t dismiss charges on Sirius Black just yet. We might need to have another trial. Though, I’m now suspicious of why Mr. Pettigrew kept himself hidden for this long..." Fudge furrowed his brow.
“From what I’ve heard,” Ron started. “Black’s family is one of those crazy pureblood traditionalists. Strictly Slytherins. I’m sure Black was Slytherin, too. There’s no way someone related to him would be in Ravenclaw.”
“You don’t have to say anything, Hermione,” Draco said stiffly. He forgot that Harry was just as bad at holding a grudge and how bad
"At least a person hasn’t been attacked yet, but we need to hurry with this potion,” Granger said, dumping in fluxweed.
Moody started to go down the corridor before his clunking metal boot stopped. “Mister Malfoy. I know you’re there. Come out now."
"It's all here, in your head. You have more knowledge than most in your year. In any year for that matter..." Draco gulped, but still tried to seem like he had now idea what the Sorting Hat was saying.
He only knew how far they went when a head of long blonde hair weaved through the crowd and up the steps.
Sorry for the long notes, but as usual, thank you for reading, comments are amazing pick-me-ups so don’t be afraid to leave one and I’ll see y’all soon :)
“Definitely but just don’t have the proof of what. I need to start really looking at it. Maybe after the Yule Ball.”
"No, she's talking with some Durmstrang people. They're really interested in those 'Nargles' she's always talking about."
“You are a good person, love. I always knew you were." Narcissa cracked a smile. "I was almost worried that you wouldn’t show it.”
“Maybe I don’t want to forgive him!” The blond sat up, his blue blanket falling off him. “I don’t feel like forgiving him! Maybe—Maybe I want
The wind whipped over their faces as they raced after the Snitch. Fletcher eased himself alongside Draco. He shoved against Draco, but Draco maintained course.
Draco swallowed thickly. “Harry, I really like you and I want to be more than friends. That’s my response. That’s all I wanted to say to you.”
"If I do, I expect not to be put off and responded to immediately." he flicked his blonde hair back and Harry quickly looked away to pull out his truck, but he was doing it too quickly. Weasley jumped out first, disappearing to find his family. Draco stepped out after him and went the opposite way.
Draco was in the library, looking up spells to help with oversleeping amongst the many other problems he has been finding about himself. That morning, Michael pointed out that Draco was “looking very pale”, and so he was looking for a spell that would fix that problem.
“Moving on, while it seems you’ve been taught extensively about creatures, you’ve had no training when it comes to curses! It's about time someone taught you about these," Moody grabbed a piece and chalk and scrawled a title on the board. "The Unforgivable Curses."
“Not so loud, Narcissa. And it’s not madness. It’s what needs to be done.” His father’s voice sounded strained.
“He killed them. Sirius Black.” Harry’s voice was shaking. “He killed my parents. He was their friend and he killed them.”
“What is it?” Terry asked with a stuffed cheek, looking over Anthony's shoulder. Anthony angled the front page towards Terry so he could skim through the article. "WHAT?" Specks of food splattered over the paper. "But we didn’t even see her! Who would've told her?"
"The one Dumbledore sent. Saying Draco had the makings of being one of the most powerful wizards in history?"
“Very good, Miss Granger." Professor Vector praised Hermione's answer that Draco didn't catch. "Now I want you to look at the chart on page 86. You’ll take your name and correlate each letter with the numerical value it was placed… Hurry along Mister Murphy.” She added, looking at the Hufflepuff boy. "Then, you'll want to..."
Fletcher looked at the large hands have a firm grip on his upper arms, surprise written all over his face. Crabbe and Goyle as looked amazed that they were still compelled to follow Draco, both of the Slytherin goons blinking owlishly at their old leader. Draco felt a lump in his throat.
Another mistake. “I just--” Draco rubbed at his forehead. How was he supposed to explain? “Hermione, I can’t tell you that. I’ll tell you later.”
“He’s told me himself. ‘My reward for my servitude will be that my son will be special to the Dark Lord. My family will be unpunished.’ It was about you.”
“Whoa, mate, are you okay? You look awful.” Michael said. Draco didn’t doubt it. He could only imagine what he looked like. Puffy red eyes, shaky shoulders, eating chocolate for comfort like a scared child. He
Draco was suddenly overwhelmed with bone-chilling cold. A fleeting thought was that he’d never be warm again. His chest suddenly felt as if someone was pressing against it, making it difficult to breathe. His increasing heartbeat thudded awfully against his compressed rib cage. Screams pelted at his ears: the Dark Lord’s anguished prisoners, Aunt Bellatrix’s shrill laughter she did when he was tormenting, the Dark Lord when Harry Potter was getting in the way of his plans. He felt himself shaking. His heartbeat felt like it was exploding. Uneven shapes blurred his vision until Tom Riddle whispered closely in his ear. Memories of pale, icy hands grabbing at his shoulders and holding his wrist in place made Draco flinch horribly.
Narcissa opened her small presents of sparkling jewellery and Lucius received dragonhide gloves that filled the whole room with their new scent.
Forget sliding doors, I'm never going to let you live this down, Draco."), discovering opinions they have on certain topics ("
Draco nodded and went to inspect the books out on special sale. He glanced over the books quickly until one made him glance again.
"Shush, Draco." As Draco gave him a bewildered eyes, Harry edged closer in his seat closer to Hagrid.
The music started playing and they moved across the practice floor adequately enough. As Snape counted the tempo in his flat voice, Draco studied Pansy's face.
Tonks and Sirius were still in the kitchen, but there were now playing Wizard's Chess. Tonks made a move that decimated Sirius' last chess piece.
“And he used his power to help Lupin to get him into the castle!” Hermione jabbed a finger to Black.
“Thanks. Yeah, Sirius is amazing. I can do homework at the kitchen table, don’t have to serve breakfast anymore, I have clothes that fit me!” Harry pulled at his (damp) shirt in emphasis. He quieted. “I’ve also learned a lot about my parents. What they were like. Especially my dad. It finally feels like I’m normal…”
"But we don't know who did such a thing!" Draco snapped. He should've followed more forward with the Moody lead.
“It’s not that strange. I find it…” Draco was careful not to wrinkle the edges as he set it down to organise Harry’s ink-soaked books, “… nice.” He felt himself smile.
"I should probably go, too,” Draco said, prying away Fred’s arm and hurrying towards Michael for means of escape. (Fred and George managed to catch on to Draco's presence and have been stubbornly sitting on either side of the blond much to the displeasure of Harry.) “I'll see you all during the match!" He hurried out to catch up to Michael, ignoring the Weasley twin’s falsely despaired goodbyes and Harry's half-formed protest.
Ron took it out of her hands, looking over it. The blonde male seemed to go back and forth from the Penelope to Hermione.
“I don’t believe it…” Terry muttered, not noticing Draco as he walked towards his bed. “This is madness. Straight up madness!” He dropped the newspaper onto his bed, "And I still haven't found Draco. I swear, I'm going to lose hair over that blond oaf..."
“I bet Bill or Charlie never had such a year. And, look! We won the House Cup!" He was practically bouncing in his seat.
Tonks rapped a particular rhythm on the door. The door cracked open and Harry peeked out. Draco's heart rate spiked. At the sight of Tonks, Harry opened the door wider and grinned.
“What did you mean, then? You somehow think that it was all a misunderstanding? That him betraying them was a misunderstanding? Him
Hermione burst into tears. “Ron keeps trying to antagonize my poor Crookshanks! And today he’s blamed him saying he’s eaten Scabbers! And, of course, Harry sided with him! I think he’s still angry with me when I told McGonagall about his Firebolt when I was only trying to look out for him! They seemed to pin everything on me this year! And they don’t even ask how I’ve been! Or what kind of stress I’ve been under trying to keep up with my classes!” She buried her face into her hands.
“Excuse me--Oh, hey, Potter. Company.” He nodded to them all and Draco’s skin prickled. “This compartment taken then?” He flashed a handsome smile.
Ron's eyes darted between them. "I'll give you guys a minute." He backed away and went to Hermione's bed, hiding them behind the divider.
“That’s never a good sign.” Ron breathed out, looking out the window to see up to the engine of the train. The lights flickered ominously before cutting off. Eerie noises sounded over their heads. The temperature dropped abnormally, quicken breathes showing into the chilling air.
Hiding in shadows, he positioned himself behind a moss-covered pillar. He watched Potter place Draco and him under an archway. Moonlight dazzled the snow, the intimacy of the secluded archway made Terry perk up in bated breath.
Cho would hold hands with Cedric in the Ravenclaw Common Room, Michael went to every Gryffindor practice (with his banner that had a tiny 'A' squished between the 'E' and 'S') to cheer Ginny on. Hermione kissing Ron on the cheek when he made the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper. And Draco... felt envy.
“Woke him up!” Michael announced to everyone when they entered the kitchen. “Had to interrupt a dream to do it though, I think.”
“Thank you for showing me and my sister around ze castle all zis time,” Fleur said, her arms linked with Gabrielle, the young blonde girl she rescued during the Second Task. “And for accompanying me as I place my name in ze goblet.”
But this time was so... different. The word different cannot cover it. It was Draco that got the top marks and he would rather have a dying rat then have a thing as a "Hand of Glory."
No, this is not the end end like I said, but hey, they're finally together! Up next, tooth-rotting fluff!
“What’s so bad? This’ll be the first time we’ve ever seen each other outside of school,” Anthony pointed out.
"I'll try." Draco watched as his mother stepped off the train, joining her husband. Slightly waving, he stared as they walked away and went off the platform.
Colin Creevey spun around and his eyes lit up. “Oh, hi, Draco! I haven’t talked to you in ages!” He turned his body back and took a few steps back down. “I came back because I forgot my camera! And to think I wouldn't even develop any of the film I have! I saw your Quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Wow! What a game! I got some great pictures of that killer move you did at the end! How have you been?” He said in one breath as he stopped in front of the other boy.
“Hold that thought.” Cedric eased closer to the goblet and let his parchment be swallowed by flames. The surrounding students cheered him on and Draco felt his stomach bottom out.
Draco’s body turned to lead. In major events of his life, Buckbeak didn’t do anything but instil an unneeded fear of hippogriffs, but it was still terrible. The creature was pleasant (at a considerable distance).
Harry eased closer, shutting his eyes, nearly puckering his lips. It was finally happening. Finally, finally,
"Can I see?" Draco stared at the thin face, the messy, black hair, and the broken, round glasses being held together by what looked like Spello-tape.
“What the fuck, Michael?!” Draco shrieked, shoving the boy off of him. He sat up and scowled, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes. “What are you doing?!”
“Come on, mate,” Michael said kindly and Draco wanted to get angrier because of it. “It’s not like you to be
Harry curled his lips inward as if to tell Draco he wasn’t going to tell. “Harry, please,” Draco pleaded. Grey eyes found tears in Harry's bright green eyes.
"Of course, Professor. I don’t hate you, by the way. Thank you.” Draco stood up, gave Dumbledore a brief nod, then left.
Tonks kissed the top of his head. “Now, get some rest.” she cradled his jaw and brushed his hair out of his face. “I’ll see you this summer.”
"Draco, it's fine," said Harry. "The basilisk is dead and Riddle is gone." Harry pointed towards the dead snake and dropped the dairy into his lap, the fang-sized hole gaping in the middle. "He's gone, Draco."
“And remember: don’ try ter blink. They take it as an offence.” Hagrid repeated once more as he grouped students together to introduce themselves to a hippogriff. "Now go on!"
“I’m not associating myself with any Slytherins since I see it pointless for me to even try. This will be the last time either of us talks to one another. It’s time you find someone new to hold your leashes.” there was a faint tolling of the bell. “I need some air.” Draco quickly left and stared heading towards the courtyard.
“Well, I don’t feel ridiculous at all.” Draco droned, wrinkling his nose as he took Harry’s drained cup, their fingers meeting briefly. His heart was finally slowing down.
Just when they were about to get into a conversation, the door opened again and Cedric Diggory peered inside.
“No more escaped convicts right?” Terry piped up, gnawing at a Liercorce Wand. “What about the dress robes on the supply list? Don't tell me we’re going to actually
"I didn't know Hogwarts had a gamekeeper!" Draco said in mock-awe, though the two didn’t notice. “That’s amazing!”
“Afternoon all,” Hermione said, dropping herself in the last remaining chair. “Nice to see you, Draco.”
Draco lowered his head, hoping to hide his pink face. “Thank you.” He cleared his throat. “Okay, I need to go.”
This was, by far, the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to him, and all for a note? Standing up, he bent down to pick up the envelope from the floor. It was crumpled by the dwarf's tight grip on it when chasing Draco, but other than that, it looked perfectly normal, seal and all. Draco peeled off the seal and pulled out the note.
Draco paid for his books and the two stepped outside. Sunlight peeked through the clouds and it played off Harry's hair. Draco's stomach fluttered.
“Hermione.” Draco stopped her, head gesturing to Professor Trelawney who was prowling the near their table. They both released a breath when she moved to pass them without incident.
"I got my supply list today and a permission slip for you to sign," Draco said innocently, pretending not to see the newspaper in Lucius' hand.
“Draco, wait.” Harry sighed, but the blond still walked away. “Draco!” A scrambling sound of shifting snow followed the blond.
It was a simple, black journal. Draco flipped through to see it was empty but it looked old by the yellow pages.
“Oh, yeah, mate, absolutely!” Michael interrupted. “I mean--Don’t even worry about it. I'm just going to hang around these guys,” He gestured to Ron and Hermione who were now smiling too widely. “Don’t even worry about it, don’t stress. Honestly, it’s the right thing to do, right? Right. I’ll see you in a bit.” He turned around and brought hands up to Ron and Hermione’s backs for them to do the same. “Weasely, Granger, let’s away,” he announced before pushing them forward and leaving Draco and Harry alone.
“Seriously, it’s fine,” Harry insisted as he sat beside Draco. “I’m not going to let something like this get in the way of my friendship with Draco. He means more to me than that.”
Draco heard a click and yelped as the box exploded in colour and noises. There were people wandering around in a bright living room, talking.
Anthony groaned tiredly. "I have no energy to lecture you. At least you're okay. They announced a feast before we came down here. Come on, I bet there'll be sweets. Better than chocolate." There was a glance at the crushed wrapper that fell to the floor.
"Something like that." He usually tuned out all the times his mother explained his name. A moment of silence went between them. The passing of the same green hills seemed so fascinating now.
“Yes, but that’s not the thing that excites me. There’s something in the Muggle world that’s probably the best thing they’ve ever come to create.” Draco smiled as the image came to his head. “I’ve never wanted anything more.”
"And that you wished you had a crack at said monster before Hagrid was arrested?" said Snape, the hand on his chair seemed to get tighter.
"Wow, how's that like? Wait, that's rude. No, sorry. I’ll just..." Creevey stepped forward but wavered about going further with Draco in his pathway. “No... but maybe I should still...”
Shakily, Draco climbed back into bed. It couldn’t be Sirius Black. Why would it be? Draco doubted that he paid attention to family lineage, and he hasn’t been near Harry in weeks. Scabbers cried out again.  Hastily, he gathered the frightened rat, trying to soothe him.
he thought, but lo and behold, it was him. His supposed-to-be-arch-nemesis for the next six years. "Hello." His voice was soft and weak.
Draco swallowed thickly. “Harry, I need to say something. Something that I should’ve said much sooner.”
Lupin’s back broadened, tearing his robes, his spine jutting out as his skin began to thicken with fur. His shoes splitting apart from sharp nails, his gaping mouth filling with pointed teeth, pupils expanding to animalistic black.
—responsible for any now. Draco tried shaking his head, as if that would make him appear in Ravenclaw tower, but he stubbornly stayed in the deserted corridor.
“That’s not the point! The point is that Harry Potter is not supposed to have feelings like that. Not for me.”
His breathing was short and uneven, his heart throbbing uncomfortably, his face a humiliated red. He kept running his fingers through his hair, disturbing his previous hard work.
"They sure do!" Hagrid laughed merrily. "Someone has to tend to the animals and such!" Hagrid patted his back, making Draco's knees buckle under the force. The blond smiled weakly, making his cheeks hurt. First year Draco smirked, not smiled.
“Piss off, Boot.” Michael arranged his mussed hair to swoop over his eyes again. “And give me back my Snitch!” Michael lunged at Terry’s bed who side-stepped and dashed out of the dormitory. Michael hastily chased after him
Draco’s quiet pleas fell on deaf ears as Tonks peeked at every door, muttering to herself until she paused in front of a particular door.
“I just don’t feel like forgiving anyone right now.” Draco quietly admitted. “I need this. Let me be angry for a moment. Please?” The three boys looked worryingly at each other. Draco shuffled back down his bed and pulled his sheets over his head once more.
His thoughts were still stringing together in his pounding skull. His mouth felt gummed up, his body was like lead and throbbed in odd places around his body. “Where—?” Draco asked before he couldn’t.
As he approached the great oak doors, a lone figure seeming to drag his feet back up the flagstone steps. Fletcher Nil was muttering to himself, his hand tucked deep in his pockets. He wasn’t going home for the holidays. Nil faltered when he saw Draco. His gaze flicked to the blond’s suitcase. He clicked his tongue, gave Draco a stinging scowl as he passed him, knocking his shoulder into the silent boy.
me." Riddle went on. "He told me all his troubles and I was sympathetic. You know, I've always had a knack for charming the right people to get what I wanted. I was the sole person he could ever count on; he told me
"Draco?" A hand was on his shoulder, pulling him back into the present (because it wasn't the past, not anymore). "Are you all right?" Concern was in his mother's eyes, but one look at his father and he knew he had to meet the expectations, even if it was all for nothing in the end.
“But we’re already heading…” Draco trailed off as Hermione sped away, parchment trailing behind her. “Towards the library.”
“Believe me I won’t,” Ron rolled his eyes. “Between you and Harry, I don’t know who’d kill me worse.”
“Let me, my dear child. Your Inner Eye is suddenly cloudy.” Trelawney spoke quietly, appearing out of nowhere. She gently eased Harry’s cup out of Draco’s hand as he tried to picture anyone that he would have caught their interest.
"Horrible—well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. I wish I had wizard brothers."
Harry gathered a huge breath. “Nothing, nothing! I’m, I’m working on my Potions essay.” Harry lifted his hand and wrinkled his nose at the inky mess on his palm.
“Davies said I was a natural.” Draco repeated his captain’s words, “Said that it looks like I could hold myself to Harry Potter. Cho said she was fine with it. Said wanted this year off focus more on her studies.” Cho Chang was a nice girl, even said he could come to her to look over Davies’s basic formation plans to catch him up.
His kid “girls are too icky” phase lasted a touch too long, his letter he got during second year didn’t hold the same weight when he suggested that it came from Pansy, his behaviour around Fleur Delacour—someone who was part
Terry hesitated for a second before scrambling out of his chair to follow. He trailed after them, seeing them go out to the courtyard.
“What?” Prophecy? Oh, yeah, he says he’s a Seer. Draco should really stop forgetting that’s what his cover story is now. “No, nothing like that. Just…” He shrugged. “Cedric Diggory.”
Even in his own bedroom, his footsteps whispered an echo when he stepped inside. He kicked off his shoes and jumped onto his bed. He crossed his legs and placed the album on his lap. He ran his fingers over the indented binding of the cover. In faded, peeling gold, Draco could still make out the family motto:
"No, I don't know why my son would want a diary. He's never showed anything interest in things like that." Narcissa said. "Lucius?"
Disliking Potter was easy to Draco as breathing. It was something so reassuring, there was a part of him that
“Run," Michael said and Draco did so. Barrelling down hallways, he sprinted down the corridors and tripped on someone's spell books that fell to the floor.
Michael turned beet red. “I was talking to someone. Nevermind where I was.” He dropped into the empty seat beside Ron.
“Oh. That. Right. I’m alright. Nothing’s happened after that day. Over the summer they almost wouldn't let me outside, but I’ve been fine.”
Flitwick insisted that those of opposite houses should pair up but was now hurrying around each pairing to keep students from deliberately stepping on each other's toes.
A conceited part of him wanted to ask if Harry still liked him. But he couldn't do that. Draco inherently thought of low expectations when he was thinking about this conversation. Harry already said he’d try to move on from him. He was the one that told them they were going to stay as friends.
"I'm fine, Minerva. We need to focus on the students." Snape released his grip on the chair and walked out of the room, his black robes fluttering in his wake.
“Knowledge is a wonderful thing, Draco, but it’s very dangerous as well. Tell me, how have you been coping with knowing the things you know?” His mind went though all the sleepless nights.
“Fine?” Draco picked up the rat and let it settled itself in his palm. Scabbers’ beady eyes blinked tiredly. “Like any other time you hang out with a friend.” Draco had an idea that his friends might have a hyper fixation on Harry.
"But with that magic he was doing, Fred..." A pang of guilt went through Draco's stomach at that name.
Draco walked back to his dormitory and found Michael and Terry playing Wizard Chess on Michael’s bed and Anthony laying down on his own bed, reading a book.
Fred and George were wrestling in front of the goblet, grey-haired, bearded, and wrinkled. A botched attempt to get passed the age restriction. The commotion froze when they found themselves in the presence of a Beauxbatons girl. Fred and George hurried off and stood alongside their friends.
reached his ears and he turned back around to see Harry had hit the back of his head against the wall, his eyes closed tightly. “Did you hit your head?”
"Nothing." Draco opened up his textbook, trying to find the chapter on stunning spells. "Can I come with you?" He pointed the question more so at Harry.
"Yeah. Yeah, they did." Dead leaves crackled under their feet. Draco didn’t know what to say. “Do you really want to talk about our families?” Harry asked honestly.
Harry moved closer and Draco’s breath quickened. A fluttering that felt a lot like expectancy made his body shiver.
… why did things need to happen? They all seem so pointless, but still they were finding ways to sneak back in. What was their purpose?
“Well… I wanted to know… What was it like? That night with Sirius and Lupin and you ran off into the woods.”
Sombre wasn’t the mood to describe the Ravenclaw tower, but complacent silence. Cho Chang congratulated on Draco’s defence against Harry, but it only made Draco feel worse. After making a half-hearted promise to Michael that they’d beat Gryffindor next time, he was finally released to go to bed.
“Of course.” Draco straightened in his seat, rubbing a tired eye. “You don’t have to ask.” Harry let himself sit on the remaining chair.
His heart automatically starting speeding up. Draco didn't seem to notice them and picked one up, tucking another book under his arm as he skimmed through its pages. His head tilted down and his blonde hair fell forward into his eyes.
A stack of textbooks slammed onto the table, drawing annoyed glances from nearby tables. The four looked up to see a fuming Hermione with Ron and Harry behind her.
Draco shrugged. Fair enough. “And Anthony?” He asked, kicking off his shoes and collapsing onto his own bed.
Harry had to agree. They've been waiting outside the teacher's lounge for Professor McGonagall just for her to announce that students needed to return to their dormitories.
“Oh, her and I have become good friends. She’s really a very nice woman. She says she has a special gift for you.” Narcissa rummaged around the box and pulled out a knitted midnight-blue jumper. “For you, love.” She held out the garment towards Draco.
“Pretty girl.” Krum made a vague motion around his head. “Curly hair. Sits vith a lot of books. You sit vith her too."
Over the booing of the cancelled match, Harry went back to the ground and saw it was Draco by the professor's side, looking more sickly than he ever had. Despite Wood's argument, McGonagall focused on Harry and told him to follow her. Ron saw this happen and broke away from the crowd to know what Harry was in trouble for that time.
It’s hopeless. I mean, I lived with with reward of their crimes! Even before! You never can escape from what you’re meant to be."
"They left this." Ron dropped something on the table. It was a piece of parchment torn up on one side with small, neat letters spelling 'Sorry!' with a frowning face drawn under it.
“Now imagine telling that to a friend, or Harry.” They would think Draco needed to go to St. Mungo’s.
“That’s likely to never happen,” Michael said as he spread a long banner across his bed. "But we can't let that get to us."
Draco took a cursory glance up to the sky. A bright full moon overpowering the thin clouds, a midnight background decorated with pinpoint stars.
still alive! I'm so sorry for the basic abandonment of this fic that wasn't my intention!! it started off with writer's block then school started up again and... now it's 2017. i don't have an excuse... but now this school year is OVER AND wOW has this fic grown!! over 2000+ kudos with over 400+ bookmarks!! h o w?? thank you so much!! im still confused and surprised every time i think about it...
, head bowed. “Take my son’s suitcase to his room.” He didn’t wait for Dobby to straighten and dropped the heavy trunk in Dobby’s arms. The house-elf swayed back and forth, trying to find balance with the new weight before cracking out of existence.
The boys slowed down when they saw the staircase entrance jammed with students. Penelope Clearwater was trying to keep jumpy first years from going up the stairs.
indicated that someone was in his room. "Dobby has brought a snack for young master Draco." Dobby showed off a silver platter. Draco found himself staring at the house-elf.
He’s been trying to figure out where Malfoy's buttons were and he wanted to try out his theories. It was time for payback for having Pansy.
"I need to..." Draco mumbled. He shook his head as if he lost the words he was going to say. "I need to tell you something," he finally got out. His hands were running over one another. That wasn't like him.
Draco finished the sweet in his mouth and said, “No… I’ll tell you one thing. It’s actually really important. And it’s not a prophecy, technically. I just… see predictions. Visions. Like Professor Trelawney.”
“Sometimes… there doesn’t need to be a whole…” Uncle Ted waved a hand. “Debating, rationalizing, second-guessing, or something of the like. Things can be simple. Like they’ve been there all along. Just think about what's in front of you and work from there."
“It doesn’t matter anyway. People can’t change. Every time you try to be better it just blows up in your face. You can't try to change yourself when you already established who you are. It doesn't matter how hard you try."
The Great Hall filled with Hufflepuffs and Slytherins, all in various stages of confusion and annoyance. The Ravenclaws wasted no time to tell their friends about the Black break-in attempt.
“As if I'd actually be scared by you,” Harry said, still plucking at his drenched shirt. “I was suddenly alarmed if anything.”
“Nothing’s going to happen to you. Not with your favourite cousin on the watch. Got it?” Tonks sighed, resting her cheek on top of Draco’s head. “My dear cousin, you’ll be okay.”
There was a tap on his shoulder. Draco turned back to find Hermione, her arms ladened with library books.
” she spat at Draco. “They were both helping him!” She turned to Harry and Ron. “Lupin--he’s a werewolf. And Draco--Draco’s a
"Harry and Ron went into the Chamber to see if they could find me. He saved me." Her gaze went back to Harry's, then it was Harry who was surrounded by the smell of perfume.
"Are you... getting books for this year?" Draco asked. The manager seemed to despair at the question.
“I know you said you’d want to put that night behind us and that you didn’t need me to respond. But that’s not true. You deserve one and I finally have it.”
“Very sorry, Master Draco! Dobby did not think, he didn’t. Dobby should never listen in on Master or Master’s family's conversations!” Dobby fisted his pillowcase uniform.
"Come on, we don't have much time!" He yelped when the slippery cloth was suddenly thrown over his head.
"Er, yeah." Draco turned to face the window as the door squeaked shut and Lovegood bounced on the seat across from him.
“Morning,” Terry returned halfheartedly, body stretched across the compartment seats, pillow under his head. “Don’t expect the others to join us. It’s just going to be you and me now that Anthony’s off to be a prefect. Did you get a letter about that, too?”
Draco smiled a few hours later, satisfied as Ron led him in the smoothest waltz they've had yet. “Well, it looks like you
The glow of red was making shadows on the trees. "Longbottom! What the hell?" Draco didn't like Longbottom as all for most of his life. The only time he was a tiny bit bearable was when they were in seventh year and finally grew a pair.
The chamber was barely lit, Harry could hear water drip as it echoed all around him. He suddenly wished that Ron wasn't stuck on the other side of the rocks with a frazzled Lockhart. His ears strained to hear something that could sound like the basilisk, but he could only hear his footsteps as he walked further into the chamber. At the end of the chamber, he saw a figure on the floor, the back of black robes facing him and a head of blonde hair.
“Still, it made me so angry at the time. I still don't really regret it.” Harry blew out a long breath. “Why did you want to know this?”
One pathway was closed off from him but it was fine. He could work with this. If Cedric was now part of the tournament, Harry was probably going to be part of the tournament. Draco came up with nothing to stop Harry from being chosen because he had no concrete suspects. He wasn't friends with Harry the first time and Draco was quickly finding out an outsider's point of view can be extremely limited at best. Draco decided to treat it like the first time. The First and Second Task seemed relatively safe, but it seemed he just needed to figure out what to do about the Third Task. But saying things was easier than actually doing them.
that I know to think about this. To let myself have feelings for someone and for someone to have feelings for me and somehow make that into a relationship. I’ve never seen it before. And, for once, I want someone to tell me how this plays out because it
to think about how much Draco’s eyes made him go weak-kneed and emptied his head of all thoughts. It was a problem for Harry ever since their meeting in Madam Malkin’s. Sometimes it still feels like he imagined it... Being in a magical robe shop, catching an interesting boy in his arms, his blond hair falling over his face but Harry still noticed that the boy had
Wasn’t he doing homework a second ago? Draco saw the window and saw the orange-rusted sky that showed the day coming to an end.
“It sounds dangerous. Wouldn’t Bellatrix and them notice his absence?” Draco heard Andromeda say. He crouched down beside the kitchen's opening.
Bright lightning lit up the grey sky, loud thunder shook the Quidditch stands, but still, the audience cheered. The game was hard to follow and even Gryffindor called for a timeout. After the break, Draco could see Harry drop himself a few feet. A wave of chills ran down Draco’s spine that wasn't caused by rain.
They were talking, the angry clattering of teapots and cups as Hagrid talked about how he finally noticed Lockhart’s enlarged ego.
It's legs twisted at angles, pearly white hair making a stark contrast against the dark leaves. "It's beautiful," Draco whispered. Harry took one step closer and something slithered out of the shadows. A hooded figure stalked the dead unicorn. Draco felt his blood go cold, his heart stopped.
Hermione gave him his final deathly hug when the five boys arrived at the Great Hall. The repeated "Why didn't you say anything?" was chastised at him. Weasley now had Draco to think of him as Ron. (He went into an underground tunnel of Salazar Slytherin's deadly mythical basilisk, he deserved at least that much.) Gryffindor was announced the House Cup winner once more, but the blonde didn't seem to care as he was pushed a plate of creamy sweets.
Ron hurriedly grabbed Draco’s hand and placed his hand on his waist and they went off on the most choppy waltz Draco has ever experienced.
The boy was small and blonde, still dressed in his school robes and stopped abruptly when spotted by Draco.
"What was that?" Michael whispered near his ear, not wanting to sound loud to the hushed tones in the Hall. He didn't answer as Dumbledore raised his hands and everyone fell silent.
"There's no need to shout, Draco." Dumbledore had light blue robes, his silver beard shining with golden half-moon spectacles.
But despite his reddened ear at the end of each lesson, he loved being at his aunt and uncle's house.
“He was with us actually…” Ron said, looking out towards the compartment window. “I thought he was right behind us.”
“It means love.” Harry blurted, not looking up. “‘The-The blessing of falling in love.’” Draco’s own eyes widened. “but if you look at it differently it looks like a stag and that means ‘a coming accident’ so…” Harry seemed to scramble for words. “You could fall in love by accident. Maybe. Something like that. Or not.”
"There's nothing that I can do considering that Nymphadora already told Draco," Snape said but also looked slightly crossed.
"That's right, Gilderoy." Professor Sprout dropped Flitwick that was coming to on the floor as she stood up. "Didn't you say that you knew where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was this entire time?"
"Are you okay?" Potter’s voice was above his head. He was suspended between his stool and Potter’s, his fingernails digging into the black robe draped over the other boy. Looking up, Draco had his 'first' eye contact with Harry Potter. His green eyes were behind a beaten up pair of glasses; they were filled with visible concern.
Terry opened his mouth, paused, then closed it. “Alright, I stand by your decision. Are you doing okay?”
Scabbers was still well alive as Halloween morning arrived. He was still in Draco’s care and the blond was still indifferent to him after all the nights he slept on Draco's nightstand. Draco wondered how Ron had such an attachment to a rat that didn’t do anything.
The smallness of Hog’s Head gave an illusion that there were many students, but when Draco looked closely, the numbers were much smaller than what Umbridge and the Inquisitorial Squad assumed. Draco noticed familiar faces like Michael sitting beside Ginny, Cho and Cedric standing by one another, and Luna Lovegood. The three huddled inside and shut the door.
“You are not your father. What he does is his choice. You didn’t make it for him. Whatever he did for your good wasn't something that you thought would be for yourself. Draco, have you ever stopped to think that maybe you deserve this good thing because you might not be the worst person ever?”
The blond answered the bronze eagle’s riddle, soundlessly crossing the common room and trudged up to the dorm. Draco pulled off his covers and buried himself under the dark blue sheets, his shoes half-heartedly toed off to drop to the ground. Scabbers squeaked at the thudding noises.
Anthony snorted. “Hardly.” he moved to lean against Draco’s bedpost, crossing his arms as he watched Draco fuss with his hair. “Hey, did no one else ask you to the ball?”
“I… just wanted to get rid of this, but…” It was hard to keep his tone level, "burning it didn’t seem to work.” Luna tilted her head before grabbing the diary again.
“Why should I? You’re here learning magic like everyone else on this train. I wouldn’t think that I needed to give you special treatment.“ Potter looked at him for a moment, seemingly accessing him. Draco looked away and watched the Weasleys argue on the platform, cursing himself for letting old grudges slip out.
Leaning back in his seat, the blond glanced at the ceiling. What was he supposed to do this year? He knows so much. Too much. What should he do? Tell someone? No. Not yet. He had to get closer to Potter first, even if that meant befriending Granger and Weasley.
He followed stragglers and tried to look beyond the smouldering fragments of tents to try to find Harry.
Draco was struck. When did Harry learn to talk like that? How could Harry say things with such conviction when he didn’t know the odds? How can he sound so brave and… breathtaking.
Draco looked around until his eyes noticed a large tapestry taking over the majority of the walls. It reminded him of the family tree in his mother’s family book. Yet there were more faces on the tapestry. Faces that were angrier, more detailed.
tell me? You know what, don’t answer that! Just--" He gave a frustrated groan and grasped the sides of his head. "WHY AM I ACTING LIKE THIS?!"
“Listen to her, you don’t have that much time to begin with.” When the two left the bathroom, an awkward silence filled their presence.
Anthony blew out a long breath. “I think I’m with Terry on this. Dating is something that I’m not thinking of doing anytime soon.”
A breeze shook the trees. Draco shivered, cool air brushing his face “Well, I think this is the longest talk about feelings I’ve ever had with someone. I’m getting cold. I think we should be getting back.”
It was easy in the heat of the moment for Draco to not let the past define him. To speak the words that the future was relatively fluid and not permanent after you’ve just discovered a long-lost Death Eater in the Shrieking Shack. His mother’s words of even the slightest bit improvement from what you were in the past were better than nothing. When he first came to the conclusion, it was simple, but it was still hard to keep the mentality over time and with the thoughts wanting to come back. Especially when it was brought up in front of an entire classroom.
“Draco," Anthony rubbed a tired eye. "You said so yourself. Nothing is written in stone. You said you can take the future into your own hands. Nothing is telling you to do exactly what it says. Why are you now so insistent that you have to follow whatever you’ve seen?”
Draco woke up the next morning thinking the previous night was a strange nightmare, but the weary looks Anthony, Terry, and Michael gave him told him that the night was very much real.
“The Dursleys…” Harry started. “Are not just any sort of muggles… they're magic-hating muggles. Hated everything about magic so much that I didn’t know magic even existed until my Hogwarts letter. To me, it never felt like I was, you know, a part of the family. It seemed to me that I was more like, the kid they got stuck with." Harry said easily. The boy scoffed. "My Uncle Vernon is the most boring man that could ever possibly meet yet he still tried to seem like he was better than me. His favourite pastime was to complain about me. Then there's my cousin, Dudley, seemed to love the game of Chase the Harry and then my Aunt Petunia…”
He followed his father to a black, rusting door and a tinkling of a bell made it known that they were in a shop. "Touch nothing, Draco," Lucius said as he rung the bell at the counter.
Draco crushed the newspaper up and threw it on the ground. He ran his fingers into his hair, pulling at it slightly. He wanted to scream, he wanted to cry, he wanted to throw something.
“Okay then,” Anthony clapped his hands. ”How about we not talk about rampant murders… And move onto a more casual topic?”
"I will be getting your school books and your mother will be waiting for you at Ollivander's. Just go to the robe shop and get your uniform fitted. When you are finished, go to your mother and get your wand. We will meet back to get your owl," he instructed. “Can you handle that?”
Draco was about to start talking about the current standings for various national Quidditch teams when he saw Severus Snape walking towards them. He stopped instinctively and said a pleasant, “Professor.”
“Harry’s going to be part of it?” Ron asked. He turned to the boy next to him. “Harry, why would you do that?”
“You didn’t see her right? No one else knew what we were talking about. How on earth could she know?” Anthony asked.
Draco eyed himself in the mirror, smoothing down his dress robes. He twisted his body to get a side view of his outfit.
"Mate, talk to us. I thought you said you'd try to be better with talking with us.” Micheal said carelessly.
“Draco! We weren’t talking about anything. And absolutely nothing about you.” Ron said oddly and both Harry and Hermiome shot him a glare. “How was your summer?”
Draco still didn’t know what Sirius Black wanted with him. He wasn’t Harry Potter and he didn’t have anything that was Black’s.
"Thank you, Harry." He smiled genuinely for the first time in what felt like forever, showing teeth and his eyes scrunched. Harry looked stunned. “Thank you. I’m glad we became friends.” Harry's face went slack momentarily, but it was gone before Draco could question it.
"I’m just having a nice day! Oh, the strangest thing happened a while ago. Some Durmstrang student came up to me looking for you and, I swear to you, he looked just like Viktor Krum. Almost identical! Mate, imagine Viktor Krum wanting to talk to you and imagine him coming to
in the common room. Draco would see all these relationship rituals happening around him and sometimes--sometimes--wonder how it feels. To be beloved in such a way.
So Draco idled as Anthony scoured the floors. He tried to ignore that Cedric and Harry were still in the room, but he couldn't help but overhear their conversation.
“Draco, we’re heading out to the Halloween feast. Are you coming?” Anthony was fiddling with his hair, Terry and Michael already at the dormitory door, ready to leave.
Draco was in front of his father’s study, feeling himself go almost cross-eyed from staring at the double doors. The rule of
"Yes! Dobby interrupted Master Draco's sleep far too long! What a terrible house-elf Dobby is!" the house-elf grabbed the edges of his nightstand and prepared to smash his head in it. "Bad Dobb—"
He took the envelope from her, staring at the Hogwarts seal. It was coming. The impending fourth year. The Triwizard Tournament. When everything began to descend into darkness.
A wicker basket cage suddenly hissed and spat making Draco’s shoulders jump for the second time that day. A brief squish of burnt orange fur could be seen sticking through the cage bars.
Harry glanced back to the two witches. "Do you know anything about this Sirius Black?" Harry asked Ron.
Not wanting to overhear the chatter, Draco went back to the dormitory to lay down before class, shutting himself back into his bed. Yet when his head hit his pillow he was pulled into long sleep that found himself opening his eyes to the sun much lower than the last time Draco saw it.
—didn’t spark anything for him while one particular Beauxbatons boy that only winked at him caused his face to explode in colour and his body became jittery…
"It turned right back around!” A nearby Ravenclaw shouted, only paying attention to Harry because of Michael’s shouts.
“Trust me on this, Narcissa, I need to prove my loyalty. This will please him. I'll please him and reconfirm our allegiance so he'll leave us unpunished."
"Yes, Mother, I will be careful. Thank you." he took the permission slip with care, not letting his fingers smudge as he left the room to let his mother and father go back to their not-secret whispers.
“The match--what happened to the match--” Harry was asking as Draco squeaked into the large room filled with empty beds save for one.
"Harry—" he blindly grabbed for Harry's sleeve. "Run. Move."  He forcefully made Harry move as Quirrell began drinking the unicorn's blood. Harry doubled over, pressing his fingers over his scar. He almost fell to his knees, but Draco kept him up, Fang nipping at his ankles to keep going.
Draco grew enamoured with the ‘telly’ once he figured out what it was, until one day, Aunt Andromeda chided that too much telly would rot his brain and hasn’t touched it since.
There was a distant sound of a door opening. “Narcissa, hello, Draco’s in the living room,” Mrs. Weasley's voice said.
." His mother came into view, wrapped her arms around his shoulders, looking down at him with a smile of her own. "I'm..." His mother was wearing a short-sleeved dress, showing an unbranded arm as well. “I'm free..." There had always been a constant fear inside him. Fear of never being good enough for anyone. Not for his father, not for the Dark Lord. Always be a perfect Malfoy, the Dark Lord's next generation. And yet Draco in the mirror let his mother ruffle his head, laughing all the while like he never had to worry about anything.
Draco avoided looking over at the Slytherin team as Ravenclaw marched up to meet them. Fuming heat settled over his head that no doubt came from Felecter’s glare. He still hasn’t forgotten about the incident in Hogsmeade and, if he was anything like Draco, most likely never will. Looking up, Draco was proven right and Fletcher's eyes glittered with fury.
“Oh, of course, you haven't yet when you’re sitting like that!” She reproached the blond. “Here, sit up, sit up.” Her hands eased Draco’s shoulders up.
“Please, I don’t think someone in our year can do that to a cat. I mean, we all hate Filch, but taking it out on his cat? That’s stupid. Besides, doesn’t that seem to go against the Gryffindor code or whatever they got?" Michael crossed his arms.
"Come on," Sirius let them inside and closed to door behind them. "Harry's still out and about around London."
“Yes, Nil? Do you need something?” Malfoy said tiredly, looking at Fletcher with an apathetic stare that he wasn’t at all used to.
“We can’t be. It's too early to be there yet.” Hermione said seriously. “It seems liken we got stuck. I didn’t even know that the Hogwarts Express could do that.”
"Here." Anthony dug deep in his robe pocket, Terry and Michael doing the same after a moment. "We kept our promise and grabbed some candy on the way out." Handfuls of chocolate, caramel, and other wrapped candies made a pile on Draco's bed. “Might be slightly melted from being in our pockets, but it’s something, right?”
As they trudged up to Hogwarts, Draco spoke after a moment of silence. “Thank you, Harry. I know it wasn’t easy for you to talk about.”
“Dear child, do you see anything in particular?” Trelawney’s harsh voice came above from the two boys’ heads.
Harry turned around and Draco almost ran into him. “I know what this task is. You don’t--I need to go.”
His fingers stayed in his lap. Harry his shoulders shake as he buried his face into Draco’s sweater.
Snape pulled out his wand and levitated Pettigrew up. In a line, they walked back up towards the base of the Whomping Willow, Crookshanks leading the way.
the people. Cho was Cedric's almost girlfriend, Fleur rescued Draco now known as her sister, Hermione was Viktor’s Yule Ball date, and Ron was Harry’s friend. All conflicting relationship statuses.
Draco told himself. Weasley sat down and heavy silence filled the compartment, Weasely's fingers getting tangled in his lap. He looked up to Potter. "Are you really Harry Potter?" He blurted out.
Ron’s eyes blew wide as he slammed his hands on the table and stood. “HERMIONE, WILL YOU GO TO THE BALL WITH ME?” His voice echoed in the quiet common room.
"Because I was worried about you, idiot," he muttered, which technically wasn't a lie. "I couldn't see you at all yesterday and when you bumped into Michael in the hallway I didn't know what to think."
like! And it’s not like you don’t know that you're the infamous Draco Malfoy.” Fletcher shook his head. He released his hair and looked up to flash his flat eyes. “Smart, perfect, great Quidditch player, Draco Malfoy. The type of guy who's been pissing me off since day one.” Nil stomped over to the blond who hastily starting backing away.
He heard the common room’s door creak open with sounds of loud talking and rushed footsteps and stuffed the robes hastily into his trunk and started buttoning the—
Scabbers? Was Sirius after Scabbers this entire time? That was a harder concept to grasp than any of the theories he thought of. What could a meaningless rat do to make Sirius Black break out of Azkaban?
The Gryffindor lot had an unsurprising victory against Slytherin for the Quidditch Cup. Draco has never seen Michael so enraged over a game, then be so ecstatic about the outcome of one. (He actually dyed his hair red for a week). Draco even managed to say a polite congratulations to Harry and left it at that.
"Let me go." Draco tried pushing off the wall, but Granger’s wand pressed closer into his neck. “Granger—“
He even called Draco out of his room to get a new ink bottle from a cabinet that was across the room Lucius himself was in.
"Positive. Now come on, you have an hour,” he said, skimming through the potion once more. He filled three glasses and gave them one each. Granger gave them a bigger pair of robes for when they transformed.
“Mister Malfoy! ‘M so sorry! I shouldn't have--I shouldn't have--” Hagrid explained as he tied a lunging Buckbeak to a pole.
Tom's head tilted in false concern. "What's wrong, my dear time traveller?" He closed the trunk and prowled towards Draco. "Is something troubling you?" With each step forward, Draco took one step back. "You know you can tell me anything, right?"
"Yes, yes, there's much to discuss. Ah, thank you once more, Professor," Fudge reached out and shook Snape's hand. "Thank you for bringing Pettigrew to us and saving Sirius Black and Harry Potter."
“You look like any other student, but you have the highest grades, yet I barely see you open a textbook except during exams. Harry never stops talking about you, Ron thinks you’re the greatest ‘mate’ ever. And even I know something is up with you. What is up with you?”
He was too distracted in his internal meltdown to realise Harry started leaning forward, eyes half-lidded. Harry's warm breath fanning over his mouth jolted him back into awareness.
At the closing to the meeting, Harry's ears were still red. "Right then, so, this is the last meeting for this term. But--But just practice on your own and meetings will continue after holiday. So, practice and stay safe."
“Let the Dementors have him,” Harry said with finality after all was said and done, unfazed to Pettigrew's weeps.
His heart was beating too fast against his small chest. The quiet classroom was too loud. His hands were shaking. He needed to leave.
The Slytherins and Ravenclaws jumped away from one another as soon as the final note droned to a close.
The four pairs of champions took their position. Draco stepped out from Fluer’s side, holding out his hand in anticipation for the music to start.
Draco was already awake when the house-elf appeared in his room, but he didn't open his eyes yet. He just got into a comfortable position only a few hours ago.
Draco grabbed an abandoned sock from the foot of his bed and folded it on his bedside table. He set Scabbers on it and the rat slumped down to sleep. “Maybe when Ron gets him back.”
"It's some meeting Hermione organised," Anthony answered. "She sounded both nervous and excited about it."
“Piss off or I’ll take it back,” Draco whined as he shoved Anthony off enough for only the boy’s arm to be left over his shoulders.
Draco felt himself get tunnel vision. It became harder to breathe as his heart frantically tried to keep beating. His body locked with primal panic.
Draco felt his nerves strain worse and worse as February approached and the second Triwizard task was upon them.
Fleur squealed and gave him a side hug. “Ah, good! Meet me at ze bottom of your Ravenclaw Tower on zat night.” She kissed his cheek and bid him goodbye.
Nil glared at Draco, his dark eyes held anger, but beyond that, there was nothing that could be perceived. Grey eyes seemed to be looking through a blank, black space that one could trick themselves to believe it had depth. It was like looking through nothing as if Nil wasn’t supposed to be there at all.
"Ron and I found it..." Ron would never be able to look at Draco in the eyes if Harry told him where they were when they found it, so he didn't elaborate.
“Miss Granger, please, you have to listen,” Lupin said, raising his hands. “You got it all wrong. Draco isn't a part of this. And he doesn’t want to kill you, Harry.”
Draco felt another stinging sensation of guilt in his stomach but remained quiet. He let his head fall back and his eyes close, preparing to sleep off the hours.
"Mate, listen. The dragon's hatched, and Hagrid thinks he can take care of it. I wrote to my brother and he said he could take it on Saturday night. You in?" Draco looked at Weasley dead in the eye.
“I could’ve beaten him. I just wasn’t fast enough.” A spark of frustration at himself prickled under his skin.
So here they were, alone in the Three Broomsticks, Draco not liking the sudden fidget Harry started doing when they sat down.
Ron choked on his spit and caused a nearby table of second years by to stare at him strangely. “Are you mad? Ask Hermione-- Why would I ask her?”
"He was going to tell us something about the Chamber of Secrets. He's--He's a pureblood, right? Not muggle-born or half-blood. That has to be the explanation." Harry felt awful that he was just sitting there, doing nothing. If he could do anything, he would do it. Anything.
Draco passively rubbed his smartened shoulder. It seems Nil’s unbridled hatred for Draco was as strong as ever.
The boys of his dormitory were dressing warmly for the fall afternoon. “Mate, get your jacket and we’ll leave,” Terry said, shrugging into his own jacket. Other boys in the dorm walked out of the room, eagerly chatting about what to do first when they get to the wizard village.
"Draco, I can't just let this go without a conversation," Snape called out as the blond walked towards the door.
Draco wouldn’t be so prideful that he didn’t feel nervous around Fleur. She was, after all, a beautiful French girl that already captured many hearts of the student body. (Draco swears he heard something about her being part Veela.) But something about him had the ability to have more composure. He didn’t understand how but he didn’t question it if it led to the possibility of sitting with other Beauxbatons students later on.
"No what, Draco?" He immediately snatched his wand from his back pocket and pointed it at the noise.
“She’s… pretty cool,” Michael said, scratching the back of his head and beaming. “She likes Quidditch.”
He instead pushed his bangs out of his eyes as he saw a cabinet. He never knew if there was anything in that cabinet. He reached up to the handle and—
Moody flicked his wrist again and shot another spell at Tonks who rolled away and crouched behind a desk. Tonks popped up and slung a spell at Moody and he was thrown back.
Keeping steady on Scabbers, he followed him as he scampered over the flagstones. Draco felt winded as they found themselves out in the school grounds.
“Do you find it a good thing?” Draco asked playfully, bouncing ahead of Harry to get out of the chilling autumn afternoon.
Draco still hasn't forgiven her for pushing him into the wall and trying to pull out his secret. "We—I—got off of the wrong foot. I kept thinking you were out to get us."
“It’s a map that my dad made with his friends back in school. It shows secret passages, and shows locations of people around the school.”
Ron was still trying to close his mouth when the door opened again, and Lucius was standing there, his hand still on the doorknob and his breathing laboured. His eyes darted to everyone in the room before they landed on Draco.
"He's right," Potter jabbed in. "He's really nice." Draco Malfoy: Nice. Draco thought he’d never see the day.
“You think they’re going to win?" Michael shot back. "Moran’s performance levels have been the worst they’ve been!”
“As for you, you’ll be helping Lockhart answer fan mail.” Draco had to thin his lips to keep a laugh inside.
"I wasn't planning to such a thing." He sighed, feeling uncomfortable at the glass eyes that seem to be staring at him.
think that I making it up! Beacause I don’t have proof, they that I’m conspiring with Dumbledore, that--that I didn’t fight with Voldemort in that graveyard! The papers have been turning me into some attention-seeking tragic hero playing up my fame. Fame I got from Voldemort
He collapsed against a flagstone wall, white noise filling his ears as he wracked with guilt and fear. He brought his knees up and buried his face in his hands.
Tonks was sitting on the floor beside the Ravenclaw Tower’s staircase, her back against the wall. She was still covered in dust, her hair was in disarray, but there was a bandage on her cheek.
“Oh, you were the beloved youngest,” Andromeda said. “Mother, Father, even Bellatrix expected great things from you. Especially when the Malfoys suggested a marriage contract. You would’ve got the same treatment if you took my side.”
This must be the interlude of the loomed conversation that’s meant to break the ice between him and his aunt but would feel like pulling out teeth the entire time. It was a formulaic plan, one that’s been done to him by Professor Lupin: Lure him in with a promise of tea and break open into a deep conversation which he can’t escape from because tea time etiquette stops him and the small part of him that actually
Honestly, it still boggles my mind that such talented people decided to create something for this story or share this story on other platforms like thank you so much for these amazing creations from over these years!
. You don’t need to do anything. W-What about what we said to keep Draco out of this when he was found in the Chamber of—“
That gave Draco more satisfaction than it should’ve. “Maybe you can live with him, Harry.” Draco turned towards the boy. Harry came to before term ended, excitedly telling Draco that when Sirius is free he could go and live with him as he was his godfather. (That's
Hermione elbowed him the best she could with her hands occupied with her pail and hurried to add, “Ron’s just saying that we were wondering if we’d be able to run into you. It’s so great to see you.” She placed her pail on the ground to give Draco a squeezing hug. Ron followed her example.
“I very much doubt that.” Hermione wrinkled her nose but reddened all the same. “Uhm,” She skimmed the chart. “Your life line has a break which
“I know it must be embarrassing to have this conversation. Merlin knows I hated having these conversations while I was at school.”
"No, really, I'm fine." Harry started talking about Snape’s sudden desire to referee the next Quidditch game, not moving from his spot nor looking at Draco. "Are you sure he's not up to anything?"
The day just kept getting worst for Harry. He, Ron, Fred, and Geroge were sitting at a table in the corner of the Gryffindor Common Room. Despite how everyone was crowded together, no one was saying anything, and it made Harry feel worst. Fred and Geroge tried to coax him into talking, to say
It was claustrophobic under the cloak. They seemed to walk around under it for hours, and the cold night was starting to get to him. "Harry, it's freezing. Can we just forget it?" the blonde asked, his teeth chattering.
"Hi," Draco repeated. "Why is Ron standing outside?" Draco looked around Harry to see Ron who ducked away out of sight.
The crowd was keeping itself occupied as they wanted for the appearance of the champions. Dumbledore was waiting beside Minister Fudge and his group of Ministry officials.
There was no way that he could continue being at Harry’s side... Or it was a wake-up call that he shouldn’t have stayed at Harry’s side the way he had.
“Hello?” Anthony repeated. “Hi, our elusive friend, Draco Malfoy, makes an appearance in our compartment.”
“Terry,” Michael placed a firm hand on his shoulder. “We’ll be fine. Even muggles are looking for Black. We’re going to be looking out for each other, right? We’ll be okay.”
A fit of anger that Draco never experienced before plagued him at an alarming speed. What did some woman from the
"Oh, what’s a little student doing out of—“ Draco didn’t have time to whirl around to tell Peeves to shut up before he screamed, “ATTACK ATTACK! AN ATTACK ONCE MORE! EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THEIR GRAVESTONES!”
"What you need?" She asked (though, with the liquorice in her mouth it sounded like "Wot 'chu need?").
“So," Hermione murmured before she wiped at her mouth. "Are you okay? Did you finally talk with Harry?”
He tried not to feel vulnerable without his Ravenclaw friends when they left for home. Everyone else seem to leave and it was only some Slytherins and Harry and his group of friends.
“No! Them muggles are bloody awful, mate. The things they did to him! You won't believe what they did to him last year! They put bars on his windows! Starved him too! Kept him locked up in his room!” Ron cried. “Me and my brothers had to break him out!”
A group of Hufflepuff boys came into the hall to push Cedric Diggory towards the goblet. Diggory playfully swatted at their hands so he could walk through the Age Line by himself. He raised his folded parchment up to the flames.
"Weasley," Lucius nodded before straying over to Harry and Hermione standing beside him. "Potter, Granger," He said in the same polite tone.
A shriek made everyone in the common room look up. A girl pulled her feet up from the floor, her arms wrapped around Cho Chang’s arm. “Something ran over my foot!”
"Some Slytherins. We have a feeling that they know who’s the heir and we’re going to sneak into their common room to find proof of who’s attacking people,“ Weasley said.
Draco waited for Harry to continue but he just stared, his throat bobbing, seeming freighted. Draco, feeling awkward, turned his gaze around the courtyard, ready to squirm quietly until he could excuse himself and tell Harry it can wait until tomorrow.
"Right, we should grab a stall," Harry said. The three went into separate stalls, each locking them.
Harry and Draco's footsteps slowed when they noticed the compartment door was cracked open and Ron and Hermione we’re caught in a conversation.
“Better be if I want to beat you,” Draco smirked. Harry started to stutter a response but Michael grabbed Draco’s shoulders once more.
“We’re cousins on my mother’s side. Once removed.” Draco answered immediately. Sirius gave him a backwards glance. “It’s was on my mother’s family tree.”
Draco pinched a thin amount of pages and flipped the textbook open. He still landed in the introduction and was going to repeat the process when he caught a long paragraph on the page.
Draco was running. Passed the shocked students leaving the dance, up the moving staircases, surprising the portraits on the walls, getting the bronze eagle’s riddle wrong twice before opening the dormitory’s door, and slamming it close.
"No," the man said. "I have no idea how Draco got hold of that diary." the way Lucius stiffened his shoulders made Harry think otherwise, but he held his tongue.
Draco winced as Harry's voice got steadily louder. He's never seen so much anger coming from the boy.
Apologies for the late update and missing my deadline (again), a lot of other unexpected things occurred over the break and occupied my mind since the last update that has taken a large toll on me and is slightly difficult for me to bounce back from. And this means I haven't finished this entire fic. I can only just say sorry and sound like a broken record. Sorry for this weird negativity as well.
“Nil has gotten the Snitch! Slytherin wins!” Dean Thomas said with the little enthusiasm he could muster.
“Yes, he’s a close friend, but Draco, you're the first friend I ever made.“ Draco felt his cheeks go to a light pink.
They entered the Yule Ball with festive fanfare, Draco winked and grinned at the scowling faces of Hogwarts boys glaring at him. When he passed by Terry, the boy just shook his head.
“Hi, Harry." Draco scrambled to grab his bag, stuffing his Potions homework back in. “Can’t talk right now—“
“I came to see you! I got worried by your letter. You were questioning all types of things about Moody then you tell me it’s fine?”
Draco became silent once more as he was in close proximity to Cedric Diggory and Viktor Krum. He didn't try to meet either of the boys' gazes. He was in the middle of a nervous laugh for Viktor's joke when someone caught his wrist. He looked down at the hand and his eyes tracked up the arm and found… “Harry?”
“Of course, Father.“ When they reached the barrier, Draco waved off the explanation from his mother and ran through the barrier, noticing neither his mother’s shocked expression nor his father’s impressed face.
interest to even be an infatuation for Draco. Relationships weren’t necessarily something he wanted. He saw everyone else get girlfriends and boyfriends, but it wasn’t a novelty that he tried to seek out.
Harry gaped for a moment before shaking his head. "No, I just," he scratched his chin as he stepped closer to them. "Didn't say bye."
Draco was seething. Does everyone want to ignore him? To think that they knew better? To think Draco was just being foolish? To pretend they care? He made a frustrated noise as he paced around his room, but his anger didn’t wain. Merlin, he wanted to throw something.
A gentle tap was at the window. Squinting against the backlight of the waning summer, an outline of an owl could be seen. Draco quickly walked over.
The outside world is a dark place, trust me on that. You're not always going to have the protection of the classroom. Dumbledore asked me to take this position to prepare for what's out there. Now, let's begin!"
The summer went by slow. As expected, he was given silent treatments by his father and when he wasn't, he would get hour long lectures on blood purity and how he must never "lose sight of it." Just one thing that was added is that Lucius would ask Draco to do small, yet annoying "favours."
“What? Already?” Anthony asked, shooting up from his chair beside Draco’s bed. Barely twenty minutes passed since they arrived at the Hospital Wing, another five for Madam Pomfrey to find a calming potion for a stuttering Hagrid before she tended to Draco.
“Oh, don't be darling. It was a choice that I made. To choose a family that would make me happy. I didn’t like my betrothed. I wanted my marriage to be filled with love.”
As she was looping her name, Narcissa asked, "Will you be careful when you go? Just, stay out of trouble will you?"
“Mister Malfoy! Dear child, words cannot express what it means to me for you to have you back in my classroom once more. I do hope that I can ask for your forgiveness from my prying last year.”
Draco had no desire to figure out any of that Flamel nonsense. All he needed was the end results and he already knew them. Quirrell never to be seen again and rumors of Harry Potter going into some trapdoor. Wait, t
"Oh, him, I mean yes, that's me." The Weasleys gawked at Potter, causing the boy to turn red. Draco bit back a smile. He was 'nice' now, but that didn't mean that he couldn't enjoy seeing his supposed-to-be-arch-nemesis suffer.
A group Hufflepuffs surrounding a brown Hippogriff took quick steps back as the creature staring hacking and retching. The creature coughed up a spit-covered weasel skull at their feet.
“Hold on," Harry held up his hands. "Okay, this all sounds amazing when you say it like that, but I didn’t know what I was doing most of the time--I had help. Listen, all of you, that's what's different from school and actual life. You don’t always have someone say what to do so you’re left alone whether you’re ready for it or not. There’s real dangers out there and they’re not going to be taught by Umbridge. And that takes away our power. And out there, in the real world, those dangers can get you killed or worse, can get someone you care about killed. If you don’t want to listen to me, that’s fine. But we are the ones that are going to need to fight, not anyone else. And it makes more sense that we’re prepared for it.”
That was enough incentive for Draco to bide his time and start researching. Before he went towards the library, he went to the dungeons to find Snape.
Draco crossed over the common room and stepped outside. Ron stood there expectant, his pet rat clutched to his chest.
The train compartment was silent. Frosted glass of the window gave a foggy view of the white forest blurring pass them.
Draco always wanted to beat Harry at Quidditch, but the staggering times he’s been ignored lately made the feeling even stronger.
“I’d think Draco as a Quidditch rival for Potter is the least of our problems," Terry interjected, suddenly serious. "Have you forgotten that there’s ah, oh what was it, again? Oh, yeah, a
"I swear to Merlin, if you Gryffindors make a habit of yanking me out and about, I will hex you." He glared at the three of them through blonde hair that shifted over his eyes when he was pulled.
"Those Slytherins tampered with it! Cheaters!” Michael shouted. He heard an update on the score and sarcastically added, “And they’re in the lead. Wonderful!” Then, drops of rain fell on his head. “And raining too! Good! Wondrous! ” Michael began clapping. Something that Draco learned that day: Michael took Quidditch
"No, no, Dobby, please understand." Just because he's trying to fix his act doesn't mean the knowledge of him doing so goes away with it. "I was horrible wasn't I?"
Hogwarts students were gobsmacked as the Beauxbatons waved, cartwheeled down the Great Hall while some gave a ribbon performance. One particularly gorgeous Beauxbatons boy looked directly at Draco and winked, causing the blond’s face to explode red. Students' eyes widened as the Beauxbatons Headmistress, Madame Maxime, strolled towards Dumbledore and towered over him as he kissed her hand.
“I’m asking for the impossible, especially if this is the first time we’ve spoken in years but please… He’s only a boy… He’s a good boy. I almost lost him once. I’m not going to put him in a position that can make me lose him again.”
Andromeda explained muggle currency to him. (“Why do I need paper?” Draco asked. “Aren’t coins enough? These coins add up to the paper so what’s the use? Who are these people on the paper anyway?”
“Draco, don’t—“ He stopped, looking at the letter in Draco’s hands and seemed to forget what he was going to say. “Erm… what’s that?”
“Yeah, we’ll see about that,” Ron scoffed, nonchalant. When Michael turned away, his face morphed into panic.
