“If you have quite finished undressing Potter with you eyes darling,” she hissed, “we should get on the train.”
“This morning Theo woke me up at an unreasonable hour, crashing around like a wounded manticore because he’d forgotten to pack,” Potter began, gesticulating wildly in what Draco assumed was an impression of said manticore.
“I’m starting to learn that,” he rasped. “That’s very generous of you, to give me a chance like that when I don’t feel like I earned it.”
“Stop fretting. It was my own free choice to get involved in your lunacy. Potter didn’t coerce me somehow if that’s what you’ve been worrying about.”
“Miles Beckett has graciously left his senior Auror position to become our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor.” The wizard beside Amelia Smith gave a curt nod to a second round of applause, and Draco briefly wondered if the position was still cursed now the Dark Lord was gone.
“You’ve been saying that for the last 3 years," huffed Blaise, “I need my beauty sleep. Let’s go and see what the bedroom arrangements are in this place. With all this ‘Unity’ crap, I’ll bet my mother’s fortune that we won’t be bunking together with Theo anymore.”
It lasted a few seconds before Draco’s brain caught up and he realised what was happening. He pulled back from Potter so violently that he nearly fell backwards through the door of the restaurant. He grabbed the door frame to steady himself.
“Harry,” he said sternly, his deep voice a rumble in his chest, “your behaviour recently has been erratic and self destructive.”
Blaise talked enough about the evening for the both of them. He’d been up until dawn, refusing to let the fun end. Draco had to admire his party spirit. He’d ended the night by playing a game of strip exploding snap with Lisa Turpin, successfully achieving his goal of getting her top off... along with the rest of her clothes.
Boot suddenly had an uncertain look on his face, as though something hadn’t gone to plan. Draco guessed that he expected begging or something, some plea for mercy so he could deliver whatever threatening speech he had planned.
There was no accusation in his tone, but Draco bristled a little all the same. This was the first time Potter had spoken to him since school began.
“There’s nothing to get your wand in a knot over Pans. We’ve talked a few times, we study and we work really well together. She’s just trying to move forwards.” Draco replied huffily.
It was a fluff piece about Potter’s love life. Draco had no idea how they had managed to fill up 2 pages, when as far as he knew Potter had only ever dated Girl Weasley. Now he was having not-so-secret trysts with Finch-Fletchley in a toilet. Draco began to laugh along with Pansy, until they were both holding each other up, tears streaming down their faces. It wasn’t even that funny, but all the built up stress of the morning needed an outlet it seemed.
“Why did you have to ruin it,” she sighed, sliding off the arm of the chair and into his lap to hug him.
A brief look of panic crossed Potter’s face, before he suddenly surged towards Draco. Before he could react, Potter grabbed the front of his coat and pulled him down, sealing their lips together in a frantic kiss that shut down Draco’s entire being.
Raised voices from all around the pub deafened Draco. He should probably run. If magical law enforcement were called, and he was found on the scene, he’d most likely be arrested just for being nearby.
He wished he could go back in time and tell his father that he doubted Lucius Malfoy could beat Hermione Granger on a test when she was 12 years old, so how was he supposed to. So much wasted energy. So much pointless jealousy.
He’d thought the bathroom was empty, but when he rounded the corner to where there was a wall of sinks he saw someone standing there and froze. Potter stood with his back to him, his hands braced on the sink in front of him, with his head bowed. Draco watched him silently for a moment. Potter didn’t appear to be doing anything except staring at the water coming out of the taps. Draco thought of all the things he should say to him, starting with ‘thank you’ and ending with ‘you saved my life, why did you do that?’ but he was a coward still. He didn’t say anything. He walked out quietly, and he had no idea if Potter had even known he was there.
Before the sound of “Immobulus” even registered, Draco was frozen. Then he was blasted backwards until his back hit the stone corridor wall, pain exploding up his spine. Pain was nothing new for Draco, but a hiss still escaped his lips. He teetered against the wall, unable to catch himself from falling while he was frozen, but a big hand flashed out to hold him still and he was looking down into Boot’s face. For once he’s not angry. He’s gleeful.
The music died to a background hum. Draco wasn’t really sure if he wanted to be involved in Blaise’s game, but it would probably seem more suspicious if he didn’t play.
Potter followed at his own pace, slumping into the other chair. He leaned to the side, throwing one of his legs over the arm of the chair, kicking his foot in the air impatiently.
The castle was quiet as he walked down to the entrance hall. He didn’t see a single person. The short stroll across the grounds to the Owlery was wonderfully brisk. A path had already been cleared through the snow by the passage of many feet since the snow had stopped. His thighs burned as he climbed up the endless staircase, which was partially wrapped around the outside of the tall, thin tower. When he finally made it to the top, he looked back over the vast expanse of snow, and the castle glittering with frost in the sunlight. He took a moment to appreciate just how beautiful the castle was. He’d always been impressed by it, but he’d never admitted it. A Malfoy couldn’t be impressed by anything.
He twisted, trying to free himself, but the Gryffindor kicked out at his legs and he lost his balance, falling to his knees, letting out a whimper at the impact. He was precariously close to the top of the stairs.
The Hungry Horntail was like most places in Hogsmeade. It was on the small side, with rustic features, and a low ceiling with exposed wooden beams. It still managed to appear open and airy, with plenty of natural light, and the walls were painted a very pale duck egg blue. The honey coloured wooden tables were simple but laid prettily with blue cloth napkins and tiny vases of fresh daisies.
“Kingsley basically said if I don’t clean up my image, I won’t be able to be an Auror. Which is all I’ve ever wanted to do... sooo I need a respectable boyfriend,” he muttered, embarrassed, and gestured towards Draco.
There was only one restaurant in Hogsmeade: The Hungry Horntail. They were meeting there at one o’clock. Draco hadn’t wanted to walk down to the village with Potter, because he was afraid it would be awkward. Well the whole thing was probably going to be awkward, and he wanted to limit that as much as possible. He’d told Hermione that he had errands to run in the village beforehand, as an excuse, so he’d need to leave a few hours early in case she checked.
“I was just in the hospital wing, there was a small accident at quiddich practice,” Weasley replied slowly, still looking between Lovegood and Draco as though she were trying to figure out a puzzle that had a missing piece.
There were fresh bruises darkening across his shoulder, down his arms, and over his hips and thighs from the fall. His leg was horrible to look at, all twisted and wrong. The blast to his chest had burned the skin red and raw. It was starting to blister.
He looked at her through his fingers. She wasn’t letting him off the hook, but she still wanted to talk to him.
They were saved for a moment by the arrival of the waiter, who bought them some menus, and filled the water glasses.
He was backed up by two Ravenclaw seventh years, but they hadn’t done anything but watch since they’d got Draco cornered. He’d been trying to take a shortcut to the library, thinking about an independent project he wanted to start in Potions. He was deciding which books he might need to begin his research, when he’d ducked behind a tapestry to take some back stairs down to the first floor, and there they were.
The smile slid off Draco’s face and he turned to pick up his own clothes. He knew he’d let his guard down too much. Finch-Fletchley was just polite, and he’d tell Draco that he didn’t want to be his friend.
Potter had set up some kind of game which involved a tiny bouncy ball, lots of glasses of drink on one of the study tables, throwing, and swearing. Hannah Abbott and Lavender Brown were playing against MacMillan and Thomas, with Finnigan and Parvati Patil on the side cheering them on.
“Look, I’ve thought about it OK? It actually works out better that it’s you. What’s going to get more attention? Me dating fucking Bradley Knox, who’s sweet but so stupid, OR me reconciling with my former childhood rival? The articles write themselves. You and me together? They’ll eat it up, and that’s all I care about. Plus, as much as I hate to say it, you being a Malfoy helps with those fuddy-duddy old bastards at the Ministry. The ones who are complaining about me are the same ones who still care about things like blood purity, no matter what they say otherwise.”
Instead of pulling out a chair on the other side of the table, as Draco expected he would, Potter walked around to the chair directly beside him. Draco couldn’t think of any reason to object to this that would sound sane, but his hand clenched around his quill. A blob of ink dripped onto his notes.
On Wednesday Draco had another study session planned with Hermione after lunch. He was early. The snow had finally stopped falling, which meant his fellow students had taken to frolicking in the icy slush whenever they could. Rogue snowballs were hurled his way too frequently to be a coincidence, so he stayed inside. A few of them had been full of rocks.
There was a slightly forced tone of nonchalance in her voice, which puzzled Draco enough that he missed the implication of her words for a moment.
“I was being purposefully antagonistic towards you, and I got you involved in a bar fight,” he said slowly, his words sounding carefully practiced.
They walked in silence again for a while, up the long winding path to the Hogwarts gates. Once they were back on the school grounds, Potter slowed to chuck his cigarette into the snow. It went out with a sizzle as it hit the frosty ground, melting a little pool of snow around it. Draco huffed, and vanished the butt with a flick of his wand, giving Potter a reproachful look. Potter just smirked at him.
“I’m totally fine. I was just dropping off Sandy because she got hit in the head by a bludger and starting talking about how the sky tasted like ice cream. I’m more concerned about you right now. What are you doing with Malfoy?”
He’d understood what she meant. He understood her confusion. His own mind was still reeling. He categorically knew that if he’d found this out a year ago, even a few months ago, he would have reacted with all the horror and fury of any average Malfoy Heir. He would have reacted the way he had been taught to, but Draco wasn’t an average Malfoy Heir any more. Firstly he wasn’t the Heir of anything. When his father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, and Draco was cleared of all charges, all his father’s assets became his. He was the last Malfoy, and he had every intention that the name Malfoy would die with him.
Draco didn’t really know how to answer that, even though he had been expecting that sort of question. All the eighth years were obsessed with finding out what everyone’s plans were. Like it mattered what Draco’s plans were. He could make a million plans, but his options were not the same as his classmates. Hearing last week that the Minister had offered Potter any job he wanted had stung. He’d always be viewed with suspicion, so he couldn’t just get any job.
Draco glanced at Pansy in confusion, but she just shrugged. His bed in the dungeons was calling him, it had been an emotional roller coaster of a day and he needed some peace. The hall emptied quickly, the skittish first years being herded out by their prefects, and only a handful of students remained. Draco peered around, curious to see who else had chosen to come back. With him at the Slytherin table was of course Pansy and Blaise, but Theo, Daphne, and Tracey were also back. There were 4 students at each the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables, and 8 Gryffindor’s.
“Can I please, please, write to your father and tell him what excellent use the Malfoy fortune is being put to?” Pansy asked sweetly.
“You mean besides the fact that my boyfriend and my best friend haven’t spoken in months except to shout at each other, because they’re both stubborn arseholes, and I’m stuck in the middle feeling like I’m losing them both?”
Draco forced on the old mask of Slytherin bravado to help carry him purposefully down the platform. He’d wanted to arrive early and slip onto the train before the crowds, like the coward he was, but Blaise was incapable of arriving anywhere sooner than fashionably late. He’d rather face a disapproving crowd with his friends beside him than be caught here alone.
Draco blinked down at the tie in his hands, before putting it aside and turning to face the other boy.
“He was funny, and very nice about it,” she continued, looking down and twisting her hands in her lap. “I was terribly sorry to hear about what happened Ron.”
He wondered if he should try and get Potter out of his jeans, but thought it was probably safer not to.
“I’m bored of this. Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s, what does it even matter? We all fought in the same war, and we’re lucky to still be here. Sure, we didn’t all fight on the same side. Parkinson over there was ready to throw me to Voldemort to save herself, but do you see me crying about that?
A few years ago, this would have been the perfect ammunition for Draco to use to get Potter to pay attention to him. Now he wished he could find a way for Potter to never find out about it, as futile as that wish was. Luckily Potter probably wouldn’t find out in front of the whole school, he rarely showed up for breakfast anymore.
Barely a moment had past since the fight began, before Finnigan, Weasley, and MacMillan all came barrelling through the crowd. They dragged the grappling boys apart. Finnigan had both arms around Potter’s torso, holding him back. Draco could see him talking quickly into Potter’s ear, as Weasley and MacMillan manhandled the Ravenclaws across the party and out of sight down the common room stairs.
“The Daily Prophet has been reliably informed that Harry Potter, the war hero previously known as the Chosen One, has been engaging in multiple affairs with fellow male students while in his final year of Hogwarts, writes Daily Prophet correspondent Constance Cuffe. Our readers may be shocked to hear that Potter is now claiming to be a homosexual, especially after Potter’s well documented long term relationships with Miss Hermione Granger and Miss Ginevra Weasley.”
He hid in the tower all day. When the sky turned inky, and the shadows stretched across the floor, he forced himself to climb back up the stairs and go to bed. He crawled beneath the covers, still in his well worn jeans and soft baggy jumper.
“Are we drinking?” he asked lightly, flicking through the pages. There was more wine on offer than there was food.
Draco thought that was an understatement, but he really wanted to know what had happened to the Golden Trio.
He tried to imagine how he would have reacted if the roles were reversed. If he had had to tell his parents, at age eleven, that he wasn’t a wizard. That he wouldn’t be going to Hogwarts, and everything they knew to be true just wasn’t. He couldn’t fathom it.
He ignored her for a few minutes, finishing his train of thought in the essay he was writing for Charms. She huffed in his ear and flicked the plaits in annoyance.
Blaise put down a big pitcher of his blue concoction, then lined up a row of Fire Whisky shots. They all took one.
“You don’t have to be a martyr Draco. I’m impressed that you’re admitting you were wrong. When I heard you’d chosen to come back to school, I kind of thought you were just going to try to pretend nothing had happened.”
“Never have I ever been held down by my own father and forced to get a Dark Mark against my will...” she said heatedly.
“Oh, she didn’t tell you? I thought she was your BFF now,” said Girl Weasley snidely from down the table.
“You don’t understand! It’s like someone has thrown a broken possessed chainsaw down a well full of cats on fire!”
This was definitely his only opportunity to have Potter like this, but he couldn’t bear to just be another conquest to Potter. Another drunken night to be forgotten. He would rather have nothing than be discarded like that.
The gleam in Justin’s eyes, as he sat up on the bed, was not unlike the look Pansy got when she thought there was gossip to hunt down.
He’d turned the small piece of paper over, hoping for more, but he didn’t find anything except the familiar tang of disappointment. Pansy had been watching him from across the table, so he’d shoved the letter away and tried not to think about it.
He felt a swell of admiration for Justin, for how brave he was. He didn’t know what his face was doing, but Justin looked at him with raised eyebrows.
Blaise looked momentarily sad, but he perked up when the song playing over the crowd changed again to a fast paced track.
“He won’t listen to me any more!” he heard Granger wail quietly, and he automatically stepped closer to the bookshelf, into the shadows, and edged a bit nearer.
“Yes I think that’s too dramatic. I’m sure you’ll find a way to confess your undying lust for her in a subtler way. I’m guessing there will be alcohol. If she’s mortally offended you can always use the old gay standby of ‘being too drunk’.”
“You do realise we’re all of age. You could literally get drunk any time you liked. I don’t know why everyone gets so excited about parties,” he said sourly.
“They’re all so... not Slytherin though. We’re just getting a bit of liquid courage before we dive into that boisterous foray. Then I promise we’ll go and fling balls or whatever it is they’re doing. “
Then he’d met this scrawny boy, with enormous frightened green eyes, baggy clothes, and a smart mouth. It was rejection, and anger, and self doubt. It was throwing himself into the role he’d been born to play, and finding himself on the opposite side to his childhood hero.
“Well I feel exceptionally lucky to have been rescued by you today Cousin, you’re my white Knight, my guardian angel, but now I am in desperate need of a shower,” he sighed wearily.
“I’m supposed to help Hannah with her project in Greenhouse 5 today,” sighed Justin softly, “I don’t think we’ll make it without becoming popsicles.”
He felt no compulsion to drink, Boot wasn’t part of the game, but he sipped his drink anyway, curling forwards and avoiding anyone’s eye contact.
After that, the Ministry had concentrated on Draco’s trial, and when that was thrown out (again thanks to Potter) begrudgingly left him and his mother alone.
As though reading his mind, Potter continued, “I don’t get a lot of letters from her, so that was unusual enough, but all it said was to please come as soon as possible, and that she needed to talk to me urgently. All I could think was that something had happened to Teddy, which is my only excuse for tearing out of here and not leaving you a message or anything.”
“Calm down old boy, I was just thinking. You can ask me any personal question... I might choose not to answer, but I’d hate to think you felt like you had to censor yourself around me.”
Draco looked over to see Potter was on his feet again, his arms wrapped around Hermione, getting streaks of blood all over her pale blue jumper. His hands were shaking.
He wrinkled his nose as he looked around. Once he’d established that Potter was indeed gone, and hadn’t fallen off the other side of his bed, he backed out quickly. He shut the door behind him and frowned in thought.
Draco bit his tongue to keep from snapping at him. This was Potter’s stupid scheme after all, why wasn’t he doing anything about it?
“No, no, let’s keep going. I’m sorry Ginny but Draco’s broken his leg and he needs to see Madam Pomfrey right away.”
The numbness was familiar and welcome. He had no intention of listening to Boot. He’d known since deciding to come back to Hogwarts that he would not be wanted here, and that some people would make that clearer than others. It wouldn’t stop him though. He’d deal with it in his own way. He couldn’t tell Blaise and Pansy. They would only want to shield him and take vengeance, but they couldn’t fight the whole world.
“Well that’s a completely different story darling, but I think you’ll agree that both our families can go fuck themselves.”
“Cousin, that money was your monthly allowance. You’ll get that much every month until you turn 18, then you’ll have all of it,” he told her, smirking. “Believe me, you’ll be able to travel wherever you want, for as long as you want.”
“Yes, sorry, I don’t know what came over me,” he said, not meeting Potter’s gaze, “It probably won’t make any sense, but... bad memories.”
“It’s time for the ‘getting to know you' portion of the evening. Who wants to play a proper Slytherin game?”
“Don’t fucking lie to me Draco!” Pansy hissed at him, slamming down her mug. “Do you know how hard you would have had to hit the floor to knock yourself unconscious? You’re tall but you’re not tall enough to defy the laws of nature! Just tell me who it was. If you keep lying to me I bet I could make a pretty good guess and start some shit.”
“Yes, my foot is facing the correct way again thankfully,” he answered, before glancing away. “You didn’t have to stick around, Lovegood, you probably have much better things you could be doing.”
“She knows that Harry, but she also spent most of the last year assuming you would get back together, and you didn’t exactly let her down gently. People process things in their own way. You could try being less of a defensive dick about it.”
I’d like you to join me in welcoming some new members of staff. Amelia Smith will be our new Muggle Studies professor,” McGonagall indicated the young witch with short blonde hair who smiled happily and gave a little wave out to the students. There were a few titters at this and a brief, polite round of clapping.
Pansy made grabby hands for the paper, but Blaise turned it around and started reading aloud. A few other eighth years nearby also froze to listen.
He was debating with himself whether to ask Padma about Pansy, while he was making his way to the library for a study session. He wended his way through the shelves, heading towards their now regular table. Just as he was about to round the corner which would open out into the study area they liked, he heard two hushed, harried voices, and he paused to listen.
“You’re a lot more fun than I thought you’d be Malfoy. Honestly when I found out you were to be my roommate I was more than a little apprehensive, but we’ve been getting along alright don’t you think? Ernie was terribly alarmist about the whole situation, but I told him it’s just not the done thing to judge someone before personally getting to know them.”
Cool soft fingertips brushed his hair back from his face, soothing him, and he squinted up into to the wide silvery eyes of Luna Lovegood. She helped to heave him into a sitting position against the wall, and squatted down next to him to peer into his face.
“Of course, good idea,” she answered brightly, getting up from the bench, “I’ll probably see you later in the library Draco.”
“Oh, I have no idea,” he said airily, like it was no big thing, “I thought I did, but so much has changed.”
This was ridiculous. Draco really needed to take some control back. He’d agreed to go along with Potter’s plan, but there didn’t seem to even be much of a plan so far. His anxiety riddled brain couldn’t live in the unknown for much longer. Hermione was right, he was overthinking this.
About 10 minutes later, when Draco had discovered that MacMillan also supported the Tutshill Tornados and they were discussing the line up for the new season, Pansy appeared at the table. She stood at his shoulder and looked back and forth between him and the Hufflepuffs, before plonking herself down on the bench beside him.
When he was relaxed and dry he wrapped himself up in a soft baggy jumper, and went to sit cross-legged in front of the fire in the empty common room. He was too jittery to concentrate on his book or his homework, so he set about combing his damp hair out and parting it into sections. Then he began to plait each section until his head was an array of tiny braids, securing each one with a small elastic band which he transfigured from loose threads he pulled out of the rug.
When he got back to his room, Justin was sitting up in bed, the duvet wrapped around him, staring out the window at the snow. Draco grabbed a spare blanket from his bed, and hopped up beside him.
“I can finally fund a full scale expedition to find the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!” she burst out animatedly.
“Well thank you for the apology. I appreciate it, and you’ve given me a lot to think about,” Granger said eventually, getting up with her bag.
Honestly Draco had so many other things to worry about, like making it through the school year alive, the right time might be a while off.
Draco winced, and pulled out his wand automatically. Potter stiffened, but allowed Draco to take his arm as they paused in the snow. Draco was pretty confident in his ability to take care of minor injuries now,  and muttered the incantations under his breath. Potter watched silently, with wide eyes, as the cuts knit back together, leaving his copper skin smooth and unblemished once more.
“I’m not ashamed baby, you should know better!” trilled Finnigan with a big grin. “There’s nothing wrong with a boy wanting to be Ginger Spice... although the Union Jack dress is offensive to my Irish body. My mammy would probably expire on the spot if she caught me in it.”
MacMillan stared at Pansy for a moment before grinning, looking genuinely impressed. Blaise poured more coffee while muttering about the indecency of character assassinations at breakfast. Finch-Fletchley looked a little disappointed, and Draco wondered if he was still fostering secret affection for Blaise. He hoped not, it wouldn’t end well.
“She wasn’t a secret. It wasn’t like she was some demented love child they kept in the attic. She was disowned, and it was long before any of us were born. I’m sure by the time we were old enough to notice gossip she was beyond old news. Of course we never heard about it.”
Justin and Pansy were waiting for him in his dorm room. Pansy was curled up on his bed, and Justin was pacing around the room, his face pinched with worry.
“No need Finch-Fletchley, I had a wonderful time causing an uproar in the boys bathroom. As if there was anything in there I would be interested in. You’re all happy enough to let Blaise in there.”
From the look on her face when she registered who it was she had just saved, it must have been a reflex, because she looked immediately suspicious.
Draco whirled around so fast that he almost tripped over his own feet. He hurried to catch up with Pansy and Blaise in the compartment they had claimed, as his mind stuttered over the implications of what had just happened.
Justin squeaked, his hands trembling as he drank. Draco shot a dark look at MacMillan. This seemed like a much bigger secret to spill, and MacMillan looked as if he was realising that as Weasley’s face got redder.
“So,” Potter said after a moment, shifting and biting his lip, “I wanted... errrrm... I wanted to say sorry about last Friday?”
Luna closed her eyes and said in a whispered rush, “I don’t know, I mean, I never... I’ve never even thought about any of it. There’s never been anything, it was just never important. I’ve never liked any girls, or boys, or anyone... not in that way... but with Ginny, I don’t know, I feel connected to her, she makes me feel safe, she makes me happy. Then there were all these feelings suddenly, and I don’t know what to do about it.” She sniffed.
In his own way Finch-Fletchley was just as high born as Draco was, their upbringings were probably not so different, but a year ago Finch-Fletchley had been forced to flee from his life, simply because men like Draco’s father couldn’t see their similarities, only their differences. While Draco was sure that most of Finch-Fletchley’s good humour this evening had been due to impeccable manners, he still couldn’t help feeling grateful towards the other boy. Along with that came guilt. Without even considering the years of bigotry he’d treated the muggleborn to, just today he’d thought countless snide things about him.
He had barely come to terms with his own sexuality. For years he had been twisted up with confusion and fear. When he finally knew who he was, he also knew what it would mean for his life. He’d never be able to marry for love. He’d never even be able to openly date someone he liked. His father would never allow it. He would be expected to marry appropriately, and produce an Heir as soon as possible.
“OK, help? I’ve never been anyone’s boyfriend before,” he admitted, embarrassed, “real or otherwise.”
The story about Potter’s fight at the party did get shared around the school, as Draco predicted. He heard so many different versions of what had happened by dinnertime, and none of them came close to the truth. Rumours about why Potter had vanished from the party were even more outlandish. Draco tried to avoid any mention of it.
He tipped her off his lap and onto the floor, where she struck a dramatic pose and cried loudly, “How dare you treat your lover in such a manner,” before dissolving into further laugher. People all over the common room looked over at them in confusion. Draco just smiled down at her, happy to see her happy, before he slid off the chair to sit cross legged next to her on the floor. She stopped laughing and lay on her back, looking deep in thought before she screwed her face up and craned her neck around to look at him.
With a little shake of his head, he suppresses a grin before accompanying Hermione and the Minister for Magic.
Scorpius evidently tries to fight against the potion, but in vain, as the answer bursts from his lips a moment after, “She saw Potter and me, upstairs.”
“I should’ve checked on them…there probably wouldn’t have been a party,” Potter continues, and then sighs wearily, “And our sons probably wouldn’t be questioned now.”
Albus shares a grim look with his classmates. What is left unsaid – what Albus reckons is undoubtedly in everyone’s minds – is the question whether it was an accident, or if there is a murderer in their midst.
“Oh.” Moonstone says very quietly. “I’m…I’m very sorry to hear that. How did the kids take it?” He asks, and when Harry looks back at him, he sees Moonstone watching him with a deep frown.
What did Potter mean about his marriage? That they are not, in fact, a happily married couple anymore, and haven’t been that for the past two years? That they are not even together anymore? Draco doesn’t know how to interpret Potter’s words.
James looks stunned, almost frightened, and he shakes his head slightly. “I don’t – I didn’t –” He stammers.
And it goes on, almost the same as the day before; James spent the train ride with his girlfriend and his friends, and left them only to change into his robes for a thirty minutes time, around five in the afternoon, during which he met first with Hugo, and then with Rose. He had given some joke products to Hugo, which Rose had then confiscated from her brother. James had gone back to his compartment after that.
Harry walks silently along the familiar path towards the front doors of the school. It has been quite some time since he last visited the place; it was probably Teddy’s graduation, he reckons.
And naturally, Harry wonders, if either the younger Miss Scott or Miss Westen and Albus are, or have been close – why else would they have lied in order to ‘protect’ Albus? He wonders if the witches are those kinds of girls his sons had described; chasing his son because he looks like Harry, which, truthfully, makes Harry’s skin crawl.
Draco rolls his eyes inwardly. Unlikely. He just has to figure this out by himself. He needs to speak with his son, in private. He needs to know that Scorpius hasn’t got anything to do with the girl’s death.
His father gives him a nod. “She will. Now, I want to talk to both of you before you go to breakfast,” he says seriously. “Come on,” he adds, walking along the corridor, and stepping into the nearest class room – Muggle Studies, Albus thinks, but is not sure since he’s not taking the subject – and throwing some charms against the door after both James and Albus have walked inside.
Last night was…horrible. Draco barely slept after learning the worrisome news about his son. Scorpius. He knows whatever it is, Scorpius cannot have anything to do with Travers’s death, he
Albus glances at his friend. “Nothing. She’s just…I dunno,” he murmurs, before turning his focus back to his friends. “It’s a Hufflepuff.”
Albus frowns at his friend’s back while he hears his mum grumble something under her breath about ‘even his son not getting along with him’. He then sees his father, talking to who must be the Scott sisters’ parents, since Westen’s parents haven’t yet arrived. Albus sees his father sending a worried look at their direction, before gesturing Hazel Scott and her parents to the classroom.
Albus is silent for a while, and nods, his eyes at the front doors, that remain closed. “Yeah. I want to.”
As soon as the door closes behind them, Scorpius falters in his steps, and Albus realises the reason for it a second later, when he sees Scorpius’s father, Mr Malfoy sitting in front of the Headmistress’s table – along with – “James? Dad?” Albus asks, and then frowns, “Rose? Uncle?”
Albus narrows his eyes at his father. “An hour – maybe two – before Hogsmeade. Why is Scorpius going to be questioned?”
A small frown takes place between her brows, and she looks away, her eyes moving from one goal-post to another.
“What’s the matter with you?” Albus hisses next to Scorpius’s ear. “You’ve been acting weird since the train!” He continues exasperatedly.
Molly is a seventh-year prefect, who Harry has heard, only narrowly lost the Head Girl title to her classmate Charlotte. And how does Harry know this? The answer would be James, who happens to date Charlotte. That said, Harry is not sure how much he should be trusting on what James tells him, as the boy is known from his mischief – enough so to make his two namesakes proud.
But he doesn’t. Instead, he stands quietly, not really answering to his mother with more than one or two words in form of grunts when she continues to grill him about his school work, his future plans and so on. Hazel comes out of the room, and then it’s Pamela’s turn. Time crawls forward in a snail’s pace, and finally Pamela Scott and her parents walk to the Entrance Hall.
“I need to talk to Malfoy, to see the train again. Perhaps it’ll help, if nothing else comes up before that,” Harry says wearily.
Albus doesn’t need to ask more questions, and Scorpius doesn’t have to say anything – Albus can see it from his friend’s expression. Because he knows Scorpius.
Draco suppresses a much needed eyeroll. He lets out a slightly wavering breath, slips his hands off from Potter’s hair, lowering them, and takes a hold of Potter’s wrist, before pulling Potter’s hand out of his trousers, irritated at himself because of the feel of loss. They disentangle, and look away from each other.
Potter takes off his glasses and buries his face in his hands, rubbing it anxiously. “And if that’s not horrible enough, I’m fairly certain my children know that their parents are going to divorce soon,” he says with a quiet voice, the heels of his palms pressing against his eyes, while his elbows are propped against the table.
Neville shakes his head, still looking anxious. “Just tell us if there is something we can do to help?”
He tries to give them a reassuring smile. “Everyone but Prefects into dormitories, please,” He says coolly, and he’s met with hesitant expressions.
Cory snorts, shaking his head, while both Scorpius and Albus snigger, all of them knowing that their friend’s description of their classmate is quite accurate.
“I’ll handle it, Harry. Just go there, and do your job,” Hermione says firmly, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I need to go now.”
He walks into the Great Hall and sees Scorpius sitting at their table with Julian and Zachary, keeping his eyes at his plate while their other two friends seem to be in the middle of a discussion opposite to him.
One night, during the holidays, they had snuck out at night, and when Scorpius had been a bit hesitant, Albus had assured him that his parents were only interested in their jobs – and at times in James’s Quidditch – and wouldn’t even notice that they had been away. Later that night, back in Albus’s room, Scorpius had asked, quite simply, if Albus thought his parents were happy together.
“Hey, guys,” Albus says and slumps next to Scorpius. “What’s going on?” He asks, glancing from Scorpius to Julian and Zachary.
in Scorpius’s character, compared to his father. Something, Albus thinks comes from Scorpius’s mother’s side. No, even if the father and son look like one another, they still have very little in common otherwise.
The longer Albus watches the occurrence, the more he feels restlessness trickling down his spine. The conversation is interrupted by a strained looking Headmistress, who quiets everyone up as soon as she walks up to them. Albus sees them exchange a couple of words before the Headmistress walks briskly towards the other end of the Hall, towards the teachers’ table.
“…They aim to – to sleep with my son, because –” Potter says, his eyes wide with incredulity, his voice rough, “– because he looks like me.”
that he shouldn’t be saying these things to Scorpius, and that he should be the bloody friend Scorpius deserves, but the ache in his chest and the tightness in his throat forces it out, and Albus feels powerless.
Scorpius glances at Albus. “I’ll talk to you later,” he mutters, and then walks towards the Slytherin house, not stopping to wait for his father.
A moment later, Albus notices that Scorpius is even more aloof than he typically is. Albus knows that chatting with others is more his thing than Scorpius’s, he knows that while Scorpius does get along with others, he usually prefers to stay quiet and listen, watching the participants carefully. Albus often wonders if his friend is feeling lonely sometimes, as he hasn’t seen Scorpius really spend time with anyone else but him.
. Like that was what he was supposed to do, supposed to feel, preferably for the rest of his life. And he knows that a large part of those feelings originates from the fact that sexually he somewhat prefers men. He lets out a quiet, self-deprecating laugh. He
“Scorpius asked Travers not to speak of what she had seen at the party,” Quinn says, glancing at Harry and Albus, and then back to his notes, “And as I asked Scorpius, what had Travers seen, Scorpius confirmed that she had seen Scorpius with Potter, upstairs…er – kissing and, um, touching each other, intimately.”
Albus feels anger and dread mix in the bottom of his stomach. “Shit…shit, shit shit…fuck!” He curses, and Scott flinches.
Potter trails a hand through his hair, looking somewhat sheepish. “I was, um, running,” he mutters, and then gives a mild shrug. “Helps me to concentrate. Clears my mind.”
His father is silent for a while. “Albus…why didn’t you tell me you knew? About – about your mum and me?” He asks quietly, his voice thick.
Professors Fox, Longbottom and Moonstone are in the middle of an intense discussion with three students – sixth year Hufflepuffs; Skylar Westen, Stefan Woods and Nate Riley. Albus can’t see their faces and expressions, as they are situated on the other end of the hall, but wonders what it is about.
James admits that he might’ve got the idea of inviting her to the party and getting back at her, since he – and the rest of his friends – thought she deserved it. James ducks his head slightly, saying that they didn’t really think she’d come, even though they knew exactly how much she craved to be included into the group of the popular students in Hogwarts.
Moonstone opens his mouth but before he can say anything else, Harry continues, “Quinn will continue with the rest of the Hufflepuff Prefects and the Head Boy. I have to check on the kids and then I’ll meet my Crime Scene Investigator in the village.”
The village is empty – there’s only Ron, Berrycloth and Fungbury. Harry tells Ron that everything was well with his children, and that they haven’t yet made any breakthroughs in the case. He tells Ron to turn in for the night, who does so albeit reluctantly, and asks if Fungbury had managed to get them rooms in the village like he asked earlier. He had, and tells Harry that Malfoy is already in one of the pub’s private meeting rooms, waiting for him.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry’s voice broke the silence and Hermione could hear the concern that laced his voice.
“You kidding, the ferret did this. I would like to see his father’s face when he heard these words.” Harry knew that he shouldn’t laugh, but Ron somehow made everything better.
Upon arriving in the Great Hall, hand in hand with Harry, Draco was expecting a lot of things, but he was not prepared for Neville Longbottom to run at him at full speed while holding a newspaper. Before he could comprehend what happened, Harry was helping him get up from the floor of the Great Hall.
Finally, Malfoy once again brakes the silence. “I’m – I can try.”  This time he sounds smaller as if he couldn’t believe that this is actually happening, as if he couldn’t believe that Harry is capable of putting their past behind them. Sure, Malfoy didn’t apologize yet, but Harry now understands a little better and he would never allow someone in need to suffer.
“I would like that.” He tried to stand and found that this time his legs actually held his weight. “Thank you for healing me.”
“Do you want to go back?” He knew that he should try to mas the disappointment he felt somehow, but today was supposed to be a nice day for both of them.
Hermione was speechless after what Malfoy said about his life. She didn’t want to believe him, but deep down she knew that he was telling the truth. She looked at her boyfriend and found him looking back. She knew that Ron told Harry that he forgave Malfoy long ago, but looking at him now she began to wonder if he didn’t truly do it now, after the story of Malfoy’s life.
“She wanted to know more about my sudden interest in occlumency and reminded me about the offer that she gave me at the beginning of the term.” He hoped that Harry understands what he wanted to say.
Draco smiled looking at him. “Did you ran all the way here?” The Gryffindor only glared at him which made Draco laugh at loud. “Okay, okay. Thank you, Ron Truly it means a lot to me.”
Draco ignored Harry in favour of once again looking at the board that listed all the available flavours. Muggle ice cream was so different from the wizard ones. Cake flavoured ice cream, fruit flavoured ice cream, candy flavoured ice cream with chocolate and some colourful small candy on top. Draco never saw so many flavours in one place, sure there were parties at the Manor but he was only allowed to eat before the party, never during. He learned to live with the constant nagging of his mother, but now he could taste what he wants. The only problem with that is the fact that Draco never had a chance to taste a lot of things and this made his unprepared to conduct the simple task of choosing his own ice cream. He could only stare and re-read the list of flavours with what dumb expression.
Draco looked as if he wanted to run away, but Harry knew that he cannot let him. He couldn’t watch how the blond in front of him is breaking anymore.
I sorry this took me so long but I had to do something at work and I didn't have time to do anything else.
“The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice is a cuddler, who would have thought. Just you wait till I tell Weasley and Granger or better maybe I will tell Neville.” Harry smile at the blond antics and hugged him tighter.
“Does it matter? I was ordered to do it, so I don’t really have a choice.” Like always he thought grimly.
“I hope the feast was pleasant.” She paused and continued only after she heard an affirmative answer. “Now, as I said earlier no bullying, if any of you have a problem with anything or needs some form of support don’t hesitate, I will personally do everything in my power so that this school year will be a peaceful one. I hope you will like the new 8
Something changed and Ron’s words made her realize why she felt so weird. The boy in front of her did not look or behaved as the blood purist asshole she grew to hate. Suddenly she realized that she forgave him, but it’s gonna be a long way for them to become friends. “Ronald, this is not how you talk to people.” She turned to Draco and saw that he had a puzzled expression. “Just ignore him Draco. I must say that I did not expect a story like this, but I think I can understand. In a way your father made you associate pain with us. I’m sorry and I forgive you and before you ask I’m not doing it only for Harry’s sake. I genuinely want to get to know the real Draco.”
Trans people are valid, non-binary people are valid and asexual people are valid and part of the community!
Draco stopped walking for a moment, then took Harry’s hand, leaned down and kissed him. The smile that was on the blond face when he pulled back to take a breath was bright and free. “I love you too, Golden boy.”
Sorry for the break my explanation is simple a lot is happening in Europe now. Firstly the treatment of the LGBTQIA+ community in Poland is getting worse. Currently, people are protesting, during these protests, the police are acting like assholes, there were beating the protesters and even arrested innocent people are were going back home form shopping.
“I’m sorry, I forgot. You don’t have to hold my hand.” He opened his palm and waited already missing the now similar weight of Draco’s hand in his.
It had taken Harry another week to persuade Draco to talk with McGonagall and by the time he finally agreed it was already past curfew. Sometimes Harry wanted to shake Draco until he finally understands that asking for help was not a sign of weakness, but he knew that Lucius’ lessons left a lot of wounds and scars that still had to heal. The fact that most of the scars, that Draco beard, were well hidden was only a reminder of the things that Harry had no idea about.
He still needed to add the last touches to their dormitory that’s why he asked Grander and Weasley for help. While the two of them distract Harry, he needs to finish decorating the room. Right now the beds were bushed sideways against the wall creating free space in the middle of the room, where Draco put the blanket, instead of the bug light he created a few small orbs that made the atmosphere in the room unique. He knew that he could take Harry to Hogsmead, Rosmerta even proposed to rent them a small room, but he decided to do something original, something that would show Harry that he would never leave him. Additionally, he didn’t feel like facing all the hatred that was unfortunately still present. A small basket filled with their favourite food, he was even able to get Andromeda to send him one of the better wines to accompany their little indoor picnic.
“Does muggle have quills?” Harry allowed a small smile to make its way onto his face at the wonder in Draco’s voice.
Lost in the pleasure he didn’t notice when his finger made their way to Harry’s hair. The Gryffindor speed up his pace hitting his prostate and Draco couldn’t help but tug at the curls.
Draco leaned to his ear and whispered. “Our daughter just created an advanced invisibility potion.” Harry searched for Pandora, who was staring at George with a smile on her face.
Hi, I know the updates schedule is a disaster now because of work, but I'm trying and don't worry this story will be finished, I think around chapter 50, but we will see.
Slowly Draco removed his hands from Harry and moved further down the classroom, leaving Harry alone. He could feel his face getting redder and redder. Slowly he looked towards Hermione and Ron knowing what he would see. His best friends were looking at him, both of them openly laughing and honestly Harry couldn’t blame them, this is what he got for dating a Slytherin. He closed his eyes, Draco needed to finish this lesson fast. Harry smiled thinking of what they would do when they get back to their dorm.
The spell that Harry’s words had on the group broke and Draco felt as stinging hex hit him in the back, he stumbled and almost fell on Harry, seeing this Neville caught him and held him upright as Harry turned around and once again faced the group.
“I can’t believe I’m here with you.” Draco smiled at the comment and pressed a kiss to the shorter boy’s lips.
After all, three of them sat down, he immediately looked at Draco. The boy was pale, even paler than he was at the station and Harry hated that they couldn’t just eat in peace. “Are you okay?”
“What a show mate!” He heard George shout. Harry felt as his cheeks redden, he wanted to flee but Draco took a hold of his hand and pulled him towards himself, making Harry land just next to Draco.
The letter he received was short and most likely extremely boring, but that didn't matter, what mattered was the fact that Harry’s hair changed to a particular shade of blond that looked hilarious on him. From across the table he watched as Ron noticed the change, before Harry did, and started to laugh at the raved-haired boy, soon Hermione joined him and looked at Draco. She smiled and gave his thumbs-up, which made Harry very confused. The Gryffindor quickly picked up his spoon and noticed the change. Draco’s smile only grew when the Boy-Who-Lived glared at him. April Fools’ Day just began and Draco couldn't wait on Harry’s revenge.
After the blonde finished Harry reached out for his hand and flipped him back on to the maters. “Now let me.” Taking off the rest of Draco’s clothes was easy. Harry smiled looking at the naked blond, his flushed cheeks and swollen lips, Harry probably didn’t look any better.
to everyone's surprise, I post a chapter on the right day two times in a row. (The next one will be a day later because work)
Harry looked at Draco, who started to laugh. “Say bye to your peace, Harry.” He just glared at the blond.
Now, are you beautiful readers lets make one thing clear Black Lives Matter always mattered and will always matter.
“Please, Harry doesn’t let Draco drink too much, he promised to take care of Teddy tomorrow. I’m having me day.” Although her tone was teasing Draco knew that she was worried about his nightmares that became more frequent.
“Oh, it’s nothing, Mr Black. I do not let my students be mistreated in any way.” While saying this McGonagall looked at the two ministry officials, her expression was cold and Harry knew that he would do anything to never be on the receiving end of this stare.
“It has a protective charm inside, I wanted to give you something that would be useful.” Before he could continue Harry’s mouth was on his and the two of them were enveloped in a passionate kiss.
“Sorry, Neville but we really need to go. Your project sounds fascinating and I’m sure that Draco will gladly talk about it some more when we get back. Bye.” He knew that he was rude, but this is a day for relaxing not for studying and knowing the blond if he doesn’t drug him away now, he won’t be able to do it for at least two more hours.
Draco shifted his eyes and looked at the man sitting in front of him. Dr Bright looked at him, his mouth slightly open. He looked as if he didn’t expect this kind of outburst from him. To be honest, Draco didn’t expect to lose his temper like this either, but he was tired of people that didn’t know him telling him that he will never change, that he deserves to root.
“If you don’t want this we can stop, but I want you to know that for me these scars mean that even back then when I was forced to do so much evil I still didn’t want to do it. I’m not going to thank you for them, but I also don’t blame you, so stop blaming yourself.” For a moment silence filled the room and Harry could only look at the blonde that sat in his lap, then he reached out and pulled the blond towards himself.
Silence filled the room and Harry started to feel nervous bring under Rosmerta stare, but then the witch smiled. “I forgive you, we all had our reasons for fighting in the war. I know how purebloods are brought up and you being a Malfoy couldn’t be any better. I hope you are better without them and seeing that you two are in a relationship I believe you are.” This tie Rosmerta looked at him and smiled, her smile was warm and Harry felt as his smile crept onto his face. “Now boys what can I get you?”
He knew that both of them were still damaged, but he didn’t expect their problems to be so similar. Thinking about it Draco realized that Harry was right, they still face the consequences of the choices that were made for them. Harry was still judged by the public for being a chosen one which was out of his control and he was judged for being a Death Eater a choice made for him by his father and by Voldemort. Their choice was taken by the same person and Draco knew that if Harry could face the judgment of people every day, he can apologize to Rosmerta.
“I was thinking about the fact that soon it will be only you and I once again.” Draco sounded a little sad, and Harry couldn’t help, but kiss him.
Draco smiled as he watched Harry’s face reddening. “Thank you, Neville. Do you think that the potion will work on the advanced cases? I know that it worked with the shaking of my hands but it was a mild aftereffect.”
“I’m sorry for being an asshole, I’m sorry for everything I ever did to both of you, I’m just sorry.” Harry felt him twitch nervously.
Today Draco promised that he will help Harry with the correct way of holding the knife and he hoped that this meant that Draco would get extremely close to him. He missed the blonde even though he was right next to him. Slowly he pulled back and looked at his boyfriend, the blonde was looking at him with a smile and a slightly wild look in his eyes and Harry knew that if they didn’t have any obligations they would be on their way to their room. He kissed Draco once again and stepped away from the blond. He smiled at the pout that the Slytherin gave him.
Draco was silent, Harry could see that he tried to think of something to say. “I don’t know.” There was another pause. “It started when he stayed at the Manor. The dream changed and I don’t know what to do.”
“No, I want to see you.” With that, Harry lifted his hips and put a generous amount of lube on his fingers.
“Why wouldn’t they, I’m a Death Eater, my parents were in the inner circle, I was ordered to kill Dumbledore, my sentence was very small and they hate me.” Harry couldn’t help but flint because Draco called himself a Death Eater. He saw that Hermione and Ron were also looking at him with concern.
This story will basically focus more on Harry and him coming to terms with the fact that somehow he became someone that he despises. When Draco decides to finally leave all the hate behind, Harry goes on a journey to not only find Draco and apologize but also to make sure that he himself changes and doesn't become the person he hates.
“The I fancy an extremely pale person that has platinum hair, a personality that most people don’t like and captivating eyes.” He smiled when he saw the look on Ginny face slowly changing from one of anxiety to one of recognition.
Draco was exhausted, he felt more emotions in this day alone than during the whole stay at Andromeda’s. But he knew that there was one more conversation that he had to have in order for the room arrangement to work. “Harry, do you have nightmares?”
“Hey! I can be a gentleman if needed.” They looked at each other and imminently started laughing. “Come on let’s go to sleep, tomorrow will be a long day.”
“Is something wrong? Did I do something?” Harry sounded panicked and he started to fidget which was never a good sign.
The question startled him he really didn’t want to admit his thoughts out loud, but Andromeda got extremely good at reading him and she knows when he tells her half-truths or omits something. After a brief consideration, he decided that she can actually help. “I don’t know how to apologize. I want to explain why I was a twat, but it all feels like an excuse. I was mean to you, I hated you because my parents didn’t love me.” He bit his lower lip his was too much. He said too much.
Harry looked at him and for a moment they just stood there and looked at each other. Draco couldn’t bring himself to look away. “I did actually.” He almost didn’t hear the words. “The ceiling is covered in small carving of the four houses. Each stone has a different house on it, they make a pattern it’s interesting. I wonder how they made them” Harry’s eyes still didn’t leave him.
Harry hated it, all the people that wanted to touch him, talk to him only because some prophecy said that he is the one that will kill the dark asshole. He thought that after seven years he would be used to all the attention, but it still made him uncomfortable. He felt as if his skin was crawling. Immediately after he left the train he was assaulted by a small army of people, he couldn’t even see Draco over the small crowd that gathered around him, but then all the people went silent and then the screams started.
The shadow was still present in his dreams but somehow he found himself growing fond of the creature that hunted him. His mindscape also looked a lot better, when he learned how to change the black night to a beautiful sunset the whole place became a welcoming image. Sometimes he wanted Harry to see the place, but the idea of having someone in his head was still making his skin itch, too many bad memories.
The round of applause started, but Draco didn't take his eyes away from Harry. A brilliant smile appeared on his face as he moved to his friends and enveloped them both in a tight hug.
“I... yes” Draco’s voice sounded a little weird but Harry was too busy to properly analyse what that meant. Quickly he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, he could feel how Draco stilled and stiffen. Harry was about to let him go when Draco put his hands on his shoulder blades and planted his chin on the top of his head.
“You don’t have to say yes, I just thought that it would be better to go with someone. If you don’t want I can just ask Ron or Hermione.” He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He, Draco Malfoy, the person that made Harry’s younger years at Hogwarts was the first person that he asked to go shopping with.
Please don't give up the world need people like you, people that are not afraid to be yourself and are not afraid to stand up to others.
“It’s true, I’m proud of you because you are strong, you are trying and most importantly you are willing to change.”
“Harry, we are wizards that what warming charms are for and besides, when we enter the pub we will be warm.” Harry smiled a little at the comment but the nagging fear that this day was going to go to shit stayed. Slowly he began to fear that Rosmerta would in fact not forgive Draco. “And if that won’t work out I’m sure that we can find shelter in some other place.” He hated that Draco had the same thought as he did.
The Slytherin looks as if he didn’t know where he was and then his eyes focused on Harry and the boy spoke with uneven voice. “I don’t know.”
Harry held his hand towards Draco and waited for the boy to take it. He closed his eyes and after a second he felt the weight of Draco’s and landed in his. Harry could feel warmth spreading over his body and with that he apparated.
Black Lives Matter and they always mattered and always will. Remember that most of the history that you know was whitewashed!
“Fine, Harry. One condition, you are the one to clean Teddy after he eats. I don’t have any clean shirt left because of him.” Harry smiled, he could sacrifice his clothes if that meant that he will be able to spend more time with Draco and Teddy.
He couldn’t remember the last time he felt this peaceful. The longer he stayed at Andromeda the freer he felt. He wanted to be happy, but the feeling of impending doom that he felt every day didn’t let him. The more comfortable he got with the idea of living without fear, the more he dreaded the day it will all end.
She didn’t know what to do. The boy collapsed into her arm and all she could do to help was wrapping her arms around him.
Draco exhaled loudly and smiled at Harry. “I love you too.” The kiss they shared was long and passionate. “Do you think we should tell the others or keep it a secret so they find out after the fact?”
After McGonagall stopped talking he wanted nothing but to walk back and cover himself under a dozen blankets.  Once again his parents are a cause for all of his problems. “Let’s say I believe in your theory, this still doesn’t explain why the shadow only appeared when Voldemort took residence in the Manor.”
“Yes?” Malfoy’s voice is slightly higher than normal and Harry notices that he griped his left forearm.
He felt as someone nagged him on the shoulder, when he looked up he saw that it was Ginny. “Go to him.” She smiled at him and Harry could do nothing but follow her instruction.
“We could move in together. You’ve been talking about wanting to move to a small cottage and I've always wanted to leave the city, so we could you know, move in together.” Draco stared at him and Harry wasn’t sure what to do.
Slowly Harry guided the Slytherin onto the bed and move to kiss him behind the ear just like Draco did to him in the library. The moan that escaped the Slytherin lips almost made him stop and look at the blond’s face, but instead, he started to suck on the spot.
“She apologized to me. She said that although Dumbledore was a great man, he turned a blind eye on a lot of things me being one of them.” Draco paused and Harry knew that he still wanted to say something, after a moment of silence he added. “I guess that the way that your family and I’m using this term loosely treated you was also one of them.” He looked up at Draco and noticed that Draco looked uncertain as to if he was afraid that Harry will lash out at him.
“It’s okay. Besides, I don’t care anymore. It’s over.” This time Draco was a little louder and Harry’s heart broke all over again. “On that depressing note, let’s order some food before Harry and Weasley starve.”
Harry nodded with understanding. “You don’t have to be afraid anymore Draco. I know it’s scary, but you, we can do it. Together?”
The four of them arrived in front of Hagrid’s chat just as the door of it opened. “I was waiting for the four of you. How it went?” Harry smiled at Hagrid’s concerned tone.
“Am not a Malfoy.” Draco mumble. “You can call me anything else but not Malfoy, not anymore, not ever again.” This time he was louder.
Just them Harry and Hermione appeared in the corridor and Draco quickly exited the room and placed himself between the corridor and the door.
“Draco it’s beautiful, I love it. Seriously how are you so talented?” Slowly Harry moved towards the blond moving his face up so that their foreheads touched.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from the blond. Does this mean that he has a chance with Draco? Can he actually ever have a relationship with him? He couldn’t make this question disappear. Draco shifted next to him.
Draco wanted to nod, but he knew that this was no longer true. “Not a Malfoy.” He mumbled and hoped that the man won’t ask him to elaborate.
Soon the train station was all but empty leaving only the returning 8th-year students. Draco looked up and found that he was the only Slytherin. He remembered that Pansy and Blaise decided to go to Beauxbatons, Theo actually managed to graduate and Goyle decided to stay home and help his mother. He wished that staying home could be an opinion for him, but he was never a lucky person.
“I’m fine Harry. I think it’s time Hermione and I leave before we lose our reservation. See you guys later!” With the last statement, Ron took Hermione’s hand and quickly led her out of the corridor and disappeared down the stairs.
“I know you can, I just want to spend some more time with you and Teddy. Hogwarts starts soon and I won’t see him. Please.” Understanding appeared on Draco’s face and he knew that the boy will agree.
“Andromeda, can you please tell me what the fuck just happened?” She noticed that his voice trembled a little.
The worst thing was the fact that the thought that this was normal and that every parent was like that. They only wanted him to be the best, to be strong. He was proud of them and he didn’t see a problem with this.
“I know that it’s not the time for presents yet, but I have something for you Draco.” He knew that Andromeda could see that he was surprised by the way she smiled. “It’s nothing bad, come on.”
Harry loved his friends, Ron said that he forgave Draco, but honestly he wasn’t expecting the same from Hermione, at least not this soon. He thought that Draco would have to work for their forgiveness, but his friends proved to be one of the best things in his life once more. Harry knew that Draco still has to work for friendship, but at least he can relax a little.
“This isn’t something that I thought about, but you are right. I’ve always found forest calming, it was my escape, but that forest looks more like a prison than an escape.” He looked at the which and found her looking back, she gave him a small nod. “But this still doesn’t explain the shadow.”
please stay a little longer, I believe we have some things to discuss. I hope that this year will be full of friendship and that we will finally get rid of the prejudice that somehow is omnipresent in the school that was meant to accept all. Now have a good first night.”
After the eventful dinner, Harry couldn’t wait for the New Year’s Eve. He was right to do so because the kiss they shared at midnight was mind-blowing and Harry just knew that it was one of many.
The witch looked at him with a sad expression. “For that I am sorry, I want you to know that you if you ever need anything can come to me at any time of day or night. But this is not all, I heard about your home situation. Your aunt let me know what happened and if I understand correctly you no longer wish to be addressed by your family name.” At this Draco nodded. “Very well, what name do you wish to be addressed by?”
Trans people are valid and Asexual people are also valid and part of LGBTQIA+. (I wanted to create a third corridor for non-binary students but I forgot, so I'm going to fix it in the next chapter.)
Don't be an asshole and remember that trans people and non-binary people are valid and beautiful or handsome!
When they arrived at Hermione and Ron’s house to get their children, the place looked like a battlefield, and Pandora was the last one standing. The two small children were laying on the floor, Ron passed out on the sofa, Hermione was sitting with her head prompted on the couch with Hugo in her arms, while Pandora was still rummaging through the box that contained the failed experiments from the joke shop.
“Do you feel better?” His voice was still soft and Draco loved that he got to experience every possible Harry that there was.
“I know that, but it’s still not okay. I’m sorry he upset you” He tried to put all his emotions into these words, so Draco could see that he cared.
“I know that it was a long time ago, but you said that if I needed to I could stay with you. I obviously don’t want to stay forever just a couple of days. I just need to a couple of days. I don’t know where to go.” He knew that he sounded ridiculous, but at this point, he didn’t care. His mind wouldn’t shut up, all his thoughts were focusing on his wrongdoings, surely she wouldn’t welcome him. He shouldn’t have come here. “You know what, actually I don’t know what I was thinking, I will go” He started to back away, this was a bad idea, a very bad idea.
Draco opened the door and barely made his way to the toiled before he threw up. He couldn’t stop shaking, his face itched. He didn’t even remember if he closed the door or not. After what felt like hours but was most likely a minute he stood up. The reflection that was staring at him in the mirror looked even worst that he felt. He heard the stair creaking.
Suddenly movement from her left caught her attention, she felt the boy next to her stiffened. She couldn’t tear her eyes away from the shadow that stood unmoving. The creature was looking at her as if calculating its next step. She looked form the shadow to Draco, who was staring unblinkingly at the thing. She watched as Draco took a small step back as the shadow took a step forward sensing the fear that now emanated from the boy next to her.
Harry felt as Draco tensed when Rosmerta used his family name, for a moment he feared that he would leave, but instead Draco straighten a little and looked at the woman. “I believe we have something to disuse Madame, also please do not address me by the name Malfoy since I no longer have it.” Draco’s voice was firm and momentarily Harry could see the pureblood that always got what he wanted instead of his boyfriend. This moment showed Harry that the way that the blond behaved in earlier years was an act that he could turn on and off depending on the occasion.
“Harry I need you to bring a healer. I know that you don’t get along with Draco, but I can’t let him die and if someone doesn’t take the infection out of his blood then he will die.” She knew that Harry will help because deep down he didn’t hate Draco.
“Draco, it’s no problem I will just prepare one more cup for you.” Just after she said it the doorbell rang. “Oh, it must be Harry. Could you open the door Draco?”
He watched as his classmates left the classroom, waiting for McGonagall to yell at him for whatever he did wrong now. To his surprise when they were alone she walked closer to him and examine his empty expression.
He had the same dream as always, he was standing in the middle of a crossroad waiting. He never knew for what he was waiting, but he felt that whatever it was, was closer to him than ever, he could hear it and feel it’s magic. Draco knew that he wasn’t safe, he needed to wake up and he needed to do it now. His body responded to his plead before his mind could catch up, and with a loud thud, he landed on the floor. Waking up from the dream was always awful, everything hurt, but this time he could also feel a pulsing pain on his face. For a second Draco wonder if perhaps he landed on his face and then the happenings of the day came back to him. His father cursed him, again. He wanted to cry, but he knew that his biggest problem right now is the fact that he didn’t know where he is.
“It’s okay, have fun. Bye Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco.” Neville didn’t sound offended so Harry just moved to drag Draco away, but the blond stands rotten in place.
“Lucius dear, don’t you think this isn’t a proper way to talk to someone’s father?” He could see the smile that spread on Narcissa’s face.
“Sorry” Draco doesn’t sound apologetic at all, but Harry thinks that he will let it slide when the blond speaks again. “Besides you should be prepared, you were trying to find a way to escape from the Great Hall for at least 20 minutes.” At Draco’s words, Harry’s face goes bright red.
“Draco you know that you don’t have to do it. I know that Harry and you became friends, but you don’t have to put yourself into an uncomfortable situation just for him” He knew that she was worried, but he needed to do it.
“I think that this will help, you can begin whenever you want.” Hermione sounded surprised and Harry knew that the surprise that was in her voice was also painted on Ron and his face.
Andromeda quickly made her way to Draco side. She examined his cheek, which was still bleeding the saw the blood mixing with a black ooze. She couldn’t believe what she saw.
“Ron and I snack out again at 1 am and stayed till 5 am because we are dumbasses. But we did manage to create a perfect fireplace for today’s grill.” He looked at his husband for a moment he couldn’t believe him.
“If this is not back to normal tomorrow I’m breaking up with you. You made me look like Umbridge.” At his words, the laughing stopped and Harry looked soberer.
Harry stood in the middle of the kitchen looking anxiously from Draco to the door. Before Harry could escape him Draco quickly moved towards him.
“Honestly I don’t know. Sometimes he is okay and he laughs and jokes with me and then a few seconds later he becomes unresponsive. Andromeda worries that one day he won’t be able to snap out of this haze.” She wanted to cry, no one should experience something like this.
The man had brown skin and upon closer examination, Draco noticed that it was a little lighter than Harry’s. His eyes were blue and his hair was curly and black it reminded him a little of Harry, the only difference was the fact that the man’s hair looked neat and professional. Not even one piece of hair was out of place.
“He’s staying. Harry promised that he will teach me how to make cookies, didn’t you?” Draco watched as Harry looked at him startled, he wondered if the boy will leave. To his surprise, he just smiled.
“I don’t know what to say.” Harry’s voice was broken and tears of happiness appeared on his face. “Congratulations, and thank you.” Draco smiled when Ron pulled Harry into a hug once again.
At this information Harry was surprised, he thought that everyone camped during the world cup. “But what about the World Cup?”
Harry began to get nervous because Draco just stared at him, but after a second a brilliant smile lit his face and Harry felt as if he was drowning. “I would love nothing more.” Harry leaned down and planted a kiss on Draco mouth. Vaguely he heard shouting and whistling behind him but he ignored the noise, the only thing that mattered for him was the blond.
“I have an idea. The whole thing is about confronting the believes and ideas that your parents planted in your head. So we need to find something that you always wanted to do, but was never allowed.” Harry almost didn’t catch all the words because of the rapid speed at which Hermione was speaking, but Draco appeared to not have this problem.
Harry wanted to retort, but Hermione was faster. “Harry doesn’t like to cook so if there no food at home he just orders something.”
He didn’t know what he expected when he opened the door of the room he shared with Harry, but feathers pouring out from the room, was not on his list. Quickly he dived into the room looking for the bag that was probably still producing new feathers. When he located it, Draco started to cast a series of complicated charms that would most likely stop the spell that was on his bag.  After 5 minutes the feather finally stopped coming, Draco was covered in them and he knew that he will most likely have to take a shower to get rid of all of them. When he looked at himself in the mirror, an idea for a prank stroke him. Quickly he grabbed his bag and filled it with the feathers that were still scattered on the floor when the bag was overflowing with them, he vanished the rest and taking his broom he ran towards the Quidditch pitch.
Harry didn’t expect that the day would be so cold, but he should expect that on the day he planned to take Draco to Hogsmead something would be wrong. First, their depressing talk in the morning that was difficult but Harry meant every word he said to Draco. Then one of his fans decided to spill his food all over Draco so the Slytherin had to go back and change. And no the weather decided to be an asshole and suddenly drop when they were stuck in the middle of the road between Hogwarts and Hogsmead.
To her surprise this time Harry took a hold of Draco’s hand without any hesitation. The boys look at each other and nodded their heads, then Draco looked at her. “What do I need to do?”
“Boys, how many times did we ask you not to do this?” Harry announced their presence and Draco watched as Harper quickly stood up, he noticed that their child tried and failed to hide a wince.
After dressing and making sure that his hair was perfectly styled he made his way downstairs, where Andromeda was already waiting for him with Teddy on her hip. He took his cousin and the three of them made their way to the fireplace.
For a moment the blonde looked afraid and then he answered the question, his voice was weak and Harry just wanted to pull him into his arms and never let go. “I always had the same dream, every night, no exception. I dreamed of a crossroad but no matter what road I took I always ended up at the crossroad.” Draco paused once again and looked at him. Their eyes met and Harry tried to hold his stare. “Then Voldemort came to the manor and my parents welcomed him. After a week or so the dream changed. There was something there with me, in the beginning, it was just there I could feel it but it didn’t really do anything. Then it started to get closer and closer and I started to run away, but I couldn’t.”
Slowly he took the fingers out and pushed his placed his cock on to Draco’s entry. The Slytherin cried out with pleasure and Harry slowly began to insert himself into the whimpering blond. He placed his hand on Draco’s erected cock and started to stroke it first slowly then he started to pick up the paste making the boy under him cry out.
Slowly he returned the hug knowing what he will have to do. He will do it for Ron and Hermione because they deserve to have some peace, for Harry. After all, he deserves someone who is not broken, but most importantly he will do it for himself because he deserves to live.
Hearing his voice, the raven-haired boy opened his eyes fully and looked at Draco with concern. “Are you okay? Did you have another nightmare? Is that why you are awake?” Draco couldn’t help but laugh at the quick succession of the questions.
I support you no matter what and I hope that you are comfortable with who you are. Trans people and Non-binary people are valid, asexual peopleexist and are also extremely valid.
“Oh, Draco I know you will be brilliant.” He watched as the nervousness left the blond. “Now tell me more about the book.” He smiled as Draco launched into an elaborated one-sided discussion of potions and their connection to healing.
“Yeah, we kinda gathered.” Ron gave him a meaningful smile and Harry felt the blush returning to his face.
Polish LGBTQIA+ community I know this is not much, but I see you and you are people and all of you are valid and beautiful so don't be ashamed and fight the assholes!
“Maybe he needs to think about something.” Harry was surprised that it was Hermione who tried to excuse Draco, but he guessed that after the mistake she did at the beginning of the trip she tries to give the Slytherin a benefit of the doubt.
Harry quickly looked at Draco, who still was talking with Hermione. “Should you be telling me this?”
Harry felt as if he could look at Draco forever, he couldn’t take his eyes away from the smile that made his face so peaceful or the laugh that made Draco’s whole face light up and his eyes shined with happy tears. He couldn’t look away.
Finally, he gathered his courage and with a shaky voice, he expressed his doubts. “Harry, do you realize that Weasley hates me?” He knew that his voice sounded strained, he felt his body tensed.
Harry laugh and Draco could feel a smile slowly making its way back onto his face “We could buy the candy bar after you eat the ice cream. Now stop complaining and enjoy this overly sweet creation.”
When everyone ate McGonagall stood up. “I hope that all of you had a pleasant meal. Prefects please led the first years to their new houses. Year 2
“Does anybody else knows about this?” He couldn’t picture Draco Malfoy in 3rd year crying his eyes out. But he also couldn’t picture Draco Malfoy ever experiencing anything as bad as what was just described to him.
“I’m fine. I just need a moment. There’s no need to worry. I — I just need a moment” the boy sounded weird. Something was definitely wrong, very, very wrong. “I will be down in a second. You don’t have to wait up.” He was frantic, she could tell that something bad was about to happen.
“I need you two to start at least tolerate each other. If you are going to live here I won’t be tolerating any kind of fight that may frighten Teddy. This of course also goes to you” She looked at Harry with knowing eyes that made him shiver. “Harry. I know that you don’t like each other, but try for me”
She opened the door wider, so he could get in. He didn’t know what to do. But the warmth radiating from the house was so inviting, and he couldn’t resist.
Draco looked at him and flashed him a small smile that Harry grown to love. “Honestly I thought it will be worse.” His voice was steady but Harry could hear that Draco was trying very hard to keep it that way. “Thank you for being next to me.”
Reluctantly he got off his bed, opened his drawers and started to put his things into his trunk looking for what was missing. After packing one-third of his belongings he looked up and saw that Draco was looking at him. The man looked proud and smug at the same time. He looked down and realised why Draco looked so pleased.
I know that pride is over but do you really expect me to stop. Every day is pride when you have the courage to fight for your rights, for your life and when you have the courage to keep going even when everything feels like you shouldn't.
Also Happy Pride! Remember Trans people are valid. Asexual people are valid and part of the community. Fuck TERFs.
He sat on the left side of the couch from where he could see the door without the chair blocking his view. He couldn’t stop himself from fidgeting with his sleeves that currently covered his hands. He looked around and found that there was no clock in the room. He wondered how long is this going to take. He didn’t notice when the man moved and sat facing him.
“Hullo, Granger, Weasley” Draco’s voice was quiet and Harry was afraid that something will go wrong.
This time Draco spoke, his voice was small and this made the need to wrap his hands around the blonde much stronger. “Do you remember the occlumency talk?” He looked at the headmistress and saw that she nodded. “Well I may have a problem and I also may need some help in solving it.”
Harry knew that this comment would be harmless for almost everyone, but not for Draco. He tensed beside him and Harry had to stop himself from hugging the boy.
He smiled. “I'm not sure, yet. Maybe, I think it would be fun.” Harry leaned down and kissed him just as a loud crash came from outside.
Stay strong, wear a mask drink water and most importantly remember that you are valid and beautiful!
Harry exchanges a look with Ginny, and briefly thinks that he hasn’t seen her as fragile and concerned after – after the war, and for a small moment he wants to pull her into a warm embrace, to give her strength and comfort. But the moment passes, and instead, Harry focuses on Quinn, who starts to speak.
Scorpius swallows convulsively, his throat bobbing. He looks away, his jaw tightening, his cheeks colouring. He’s embarrassed. Or, perhaps he is afraid to admit it to Albus – why it matters to Scorpius.
Riley nods slowly. “We were, um…” He glances at Harry and Moonstone, before quickly looking at the floor, “snogging, in a compartment. And then Jenna…she was distracted,” he says with a deep frown. He moves his gaze up to meet Harry’s, who studies carefully his features.
Potter groans, breathing heavily against Draco’s neck, and then makes a quick work of opening Draco’s trousers, before shoving his hand inside them. The next moment, Potter proceeds to squeeze his half-hard cock to achingly hard while leaning his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
“Because he’s my friend!” Albus yells exasperatedly, throwing his hands up, “Why do you think, arsehole?”
James had watched Harry and Ginny closely, listening carefully, while occasionally chewing the inside of his cheek. Lily had burrowed herself against Ginny’s side, and had cried silently. Albus – well, Albus had mostly stared out of the window. Which made Harry’s chest ache.
The door shuts with a click, and Malfoy stares at Harry, a somewhat contemplative look in his eyes. He then clears his throat and lifts his brows inquiringly. “Potter?”
Draco eyes Potter’s reddened face, those innocent wide eyes, and the disbelief in them. Still, after all these years, after being the
Potter looks at his notes and clears his throat. “Nate Riley spent part of the journey with Travers, and the other part of it with his friends. He saw Travers having an argument with Albus and Scorpius in the corridor, participated in it in order to end it, and afterwards had an argument with Travers in a compartment. Both incidents were left unmentioned by him in the first questioning last night,” Potter says, looking around the room. “Riley explained today under Veritaserum that he had been jealous that his late girlfriend had still had feelings for Albus, and had been embarrassed about his argument with Travers, and thus had not wanted to mention the events. He told us under Veritaserum, that the last time he saw Travers, was in her compartment, where he didn’t see any books. Riley had left after Travers had intended to change into her robes and had asked for privacy. Riley had returned to stay with his friends for the rest of the trip. It was approximately one hour before the train reached Hogsmeade.”
Albus murmurs his good nights and jumps into his own bed, lying on his back and staring at the canopy. Why would Scorpius get mad at him for interrupting the argument between his friend and Travers on the train, if they had only been talking about Albus?
Harry grunts his reply, as he does to the next nine Aurors, who sit along Keir, facing the front of the class. Smith and Quinn take their places next to their partners, as Harry flicks his wand to close the door with an added silencing spell.
And if thinking about the occurrence in the hospital wing doesn’t make Harry hard and wanting, he doesn’t know what does. He glances down, at his tenting trousers, and groans in frustration, digging the back of his head against the backrest of the sofa, until he feels a sharp pain in his skull.
. Like, for one month after she broke up with me. Which was at the end of September. It’s safe to say we both avoided each other after that. I didn’t talk to her until the train. I only saw her at the party, but I definitely didn’t invite her there.”
“Yes. And she almost agreed, but – but then Albus walked up to us, telling her to bugger off, to stop harassing me, and…and Travers proceeded to decline my request, and threatened both Albus and me.”
“Repeat what Scorpius told us he asked from Travers, before the dispute in the corridor,” Harry says faintly.
Quinn gives Draco a strained look. “According to Scott, less than two hours before the train arrived Hogsmeade.”
“They will start with Scorpius, proceed with the Scott girls and then Albus, then Miss Westen,” Scorpius’s father says stiffly. “The Aurors are waiting for Miss Westen’s parents and your mother to arrive,” he adds to Albus after seeing the curious look on his face.
“Yes. That would be – Quinn, you can take the lead,” Potter says, his brows furrowed, sounding somewhat absentminded.
Albus also knows that Scorpius doesn’t hate his father, even if he makes it seem like he does some days. He reckons that Scorpius and his father are merely too different – not in appearance, as they look so much alike; they both have blonde hair and an impossibly good posture, sharp angles and grey eyes. Only…Albus thinks there’s something inexplicably
Draco glances at Potter; he looks quite authoritative with his perfectly tailored Auror robes, and the most serious expression. Potter looks nothing like the flustered and breathless version of him from this morning in the hallway. He looks nothing like the anxious boy from his school years, and nothing like he had been two years ago, the last time Draco has talked to him before yesterday.
Albus looks away and sighs, leaning forward with his elbows against his knees, his hands hanging between his legs. “Can we just forget the whole thing?” He asks faintly, not wanting to discuss it, or even think of it. He looks at his father, who places a soothing hand on his shoulder, and squeezes slightly, as if to remind Albus that he’s there.
“Distressed,” Rose says instantly. “Because most of her things in her trunk were covered in the Permanent Colour-Change Ink by Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes,” she continues, “Which can be removed only by their Guaranteed Five-Second Ink Removal potion.”
But, what he wants often does not happen. Which is clear, as his brother plops down to sit next to him on the bench.
James scoffs. “Can’t believe you just said that…Well, fuck you, Scorpius.” James grunts, and Albus can hear him walking in the room, towards the door. “I need to go…I need to find – find Charlotte…”
my best friend, because of you!” He yells, feeling nothing but frustration and rage towards the witch.
Harry watches at his Aurors taking in the information, before he clears his throat. “There is no reason to suspect that any of the students we have questioned during the past three days, have something to do with Travers’s death. Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy had shared an argument with the victim, but that had been their only contact to her during the train ride. James Potter had not seen Travers at all during the train ride. Nate Riley had spent a short amount of time with Travers, as had Skylar Westen and the Scott sisters. All other students, who had seen Travers during the journey back to Hogwarts, were questioned during the first night and today afternoon, and each of them had seen the victim during the first hours of the trip, either with her friends, her boyfriend Riley, or alone,” Harry explains wearily. “The information we have now, does not point to any specific person. It is likely, that this case –” and Harry grits his teeth as he even thinks of it “– that this case will stay unresolved, for the time being.”
There’s a faint blush on tops of Malfoy’s cheeks as the Slytherin looks away, evidently due to Harry’s blatant staring. Harry’s mind goes back to the pub two years ago, and then, to the previous night, and he feels himself drawn towards Malfoy once more, feels his pulse quickening and feels the longing that he has tried to dampen down ever since their paths uncrossed.
Draco makes it to the hallway, and just as he wonders which of the doors is the bathroom, someone trudges up the stairs.
Still the man in front of him regards what he has just said as shocking news. He wonders, how Potter can be so…so bloody naïve? How has he managed to close his eyes and not understand his own popularity?
Both Quinn and Smith leave the room for a bit – Harry knows that it is merely to give Harry and his boss some privacy, as they will both need to return soon back for Albus’s questioning.
His father gives him a tired smile. “Hey Al. You okay?” He asks, nudging his jaw towards one of the seats lining the walls. “Do you have a moment?”
“What is going on?” Ginny asks incredulously, and Quinn merely gives her a pointed look, before turning his focus on Albus.
think about Malfoy right now. He checks the time – eleven – and lets out a weary sigh; he still needs to pop in at all houses, except Hufflepuff.
From the moment Potter turned him down when Draco offered his hand at the start of their first year, they became rivals. They became enemies. Their schoolyears were filled with bullying, fighting, competing and duelling. And Draco doesn’t even deny it – within his own mind, of course – that he was jealous. Jealous of Potter. Because Potter seemed to have everything; fame, fortune, friends, and everyone worshipping the ground he walked on. He was even a decent wizard and able to perform some spells Draco and many others were only dreaming of. Apparently, he still is, as he has managed to move up in his career to be the Head of the Auror Office.
There is a soft knock on the door, just as everyone has stood up and started to gather their things.
Harry gives Moonstone’s words a contemplative moment. “We need to question them – all of the Prefects. I assume they were all patrolling the train during the trip?” Harry asks, looking from Moonstone to McGonagall.
“…You’re saying the post-mortem-scan did not reveal any other magical signatures but Miss Travers’s?”
When Harry doesn’t reply to him, Moonstone lifts his head up, and evidently sees the look of uncertainty passing over Harry’s features. “Harry?”
She had screamed her voice hoarse an hour and a half earlier, when Harry had spoken with her after Riley’s interrogation. Harry had explained her everything Albus and James had told him earlier, and everything he was allowed to say to her regarding the investigation. Ginny had been beside herself with anger, her magic sparkling around her threateningly. It wasn’t of course all meant for Harry; she was fuming at James for organising a party, including alcohol, which made it much more serious, since some of the guests had been underage. James could be arrested for it – even if he had nothing to do with other people’s drinks. Harry knew that Ginny was also angry at herself for bailing to work and leaving Harry with the kids; annoyed at Harry for leaving the kids by themselves and going to work on New Year’s Eve and being gone for the night; disappointed at Albus for not telling them he had been dating someone four months ago. She was also furious at the wizarding world in general for their obsession about Harry Potter, and how it was causing pain and sorrow to her son.
Draco arches a brow at Potter, only then remembering the fact, and deciding to exchange a couple of carefully selected words with the Auror later. Potter notices Draco looking at him, and there’s a mixture of guilt and exasperation in his expression, before he turns his focus back to Quinn.
The silence stretches between them, but neither of them speaks. Draco knows, that Potter’s mind is on the case again as he sees the same look of concentration, the same ambition in Potter’s eyes, that Draco knows has shone from his own every time he’s been absorbed in his work. He doesn’t disturb Potter.
Potter still watches him with incredulity, but then – and Draco really tries not to smirk as he sees it, but fails brilliantly – Potter’s expression changes, at first into a deep contemplative frown, before the utter and terrified shock takes over his features.
“Don’t ‘Gin’ me, Harry!” Ginny hisses, “This is on us! We should’ve been there, and not let our jobs come before our children!” She says, her voice anxious. “There wouldn’t have been any parties on New Year’s, and we might’ve learned about Albus’s troubles long ago…”
Their gasps fill the quiet and dark room, and Draco feels euphoric, as Potter returns to suck the skin below his jaw, all the while bringing Draco closer and closer to the most intense ecstasy. Too long has Draco thought of it, reminisced it – the night at the pub, and Potter’s touch and taste. And now that he has it, now that the emptiness has been filled, and Potter is there with all his attention on Draco, allowing him to finally
Harry clears his throat and fixes his gaze at Riley, who looks back with reserve. “Mr Riley. Why don’t you tell us about the train ride? Start from the beginning,” Harry says, his voice stern, but his expression kind and approachable.
What happened, was something Draco hadn’t done before, even though he’s been aware of his…preferences…ever since he was a young boy. What he felt with Potter, he hadn’t felt with others; it was…arousing, and so…
Albus swallows hard. Of course, there bloody well was. Still is, some days. But…can he be mad to his own father, for being the Saviour? For making a better future for everyone? In his own mind, he can, and he was. But not – not so much anymore. He’s tired of being angry about it, because it will not likely change. Albus will always look like his father. He will always be his father’s son. The saviour’s son. And he will always be outshined by James. And if that doesn’t make him sound fucked up, he doesn’t know what will.
Scorpius hadn’t asked about the detention the previous night. He had only asked Albus if they could talk a bit, but Albus had outright declined, lying to his best friend that he was too tired. Albus knew that Scorpius had seen right through him and had understood that Albus simply hadn’t wanted to talk to Scorpius, which made Albus feel even more ashamed than he already was.
And later on, Albus did admit to Scorpius that the plan had been an idiotic one, since they really didn’t get into any of the Muggle pubs they tried to, even with their charmed ID’s. As they were unable to use magic outside Albus’s home due to being underage, they had thought their fake Muggle ID’s would’ve done the trick. But no. Apparently, neither of them looks old enough to be eighteen, Albus reckons.
“As Professor Flitwick is needed elsewhere, I will act as your Head of House during this questioning, and will speak with him before tomorrow, so that he knows – as your actual Head of House – what we discussed today with the Aurors,” Moonstone tells Riley. “Would that be all right?”
McGonagall looks rather bothered by the thought of her students or faculty being examined, but nods slowly. “You do what you must.”
Malfoy arches a brow at him, putting more distance between them – at least, as much as he can, since he’s pressed between Harry and the wall. “What about?”
She whispers, looking like she’s going to faint soon. And Harry thinks vaguely, it is quite remarkable, since Ginny’s not a person who is easily shocked, not after growing up with six older brothers.
He lets out another sigh, knowing that there is no use to continue sorting out his mess of a desk when he is feeling so tired. Standing up, Harry stretches his back and briefly wonders if he remembered to eat lunch during the day. Based on the growling sound in his stomach, he thinks not.
“What – what about Miss Travers?” Albus’s father asks after a short moment. “She was one of those people, then? But…but you thought differently of her?” He asks. When Albus says nothing, their father turns to James. “The dispute at the party was about Albus?” He asks, apparently putting two and two together.
Draco clears his throat. “The scan confirmed my preliminary analysis; A sixteen-year-old girl. Cause of death: blow to the head, resulting a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. No other wounds, damage or bruising elsewhere in her body. Based on body temperature at my arrival, and what could be determined from the scan, the time of death occurred between five thirty and six thirty pm, two days ago – which we now know to be between six and six thirty, based on witness questioning. The sedative levels in her bloodstream were high; most likely Calming Draught – however,” Draco says, pausing, glancing at his notes, “Those tend to be more difficult to recognise after certain amount of time.”
snowball fight, and how they had the chance to prank the Hufflepuff Head of House by sneaking into the greenhouses and leaving a present in the form of a dung bomb to him, Albus wonders if Scorpius would’ve preferred to have stayed in the school as well. He certainly wouldn’t have wanted to stay at home, Albus knows at least that much.
“I should go,” Draco mutters, saving them both from the uncomfortable silence. He glances at Potter, sees the somewhat desperate look in his eyes. Draco’s not sure how to interpret it, but he has a vague idea what Potter is on about. “…It is best not to mention this to anyone,” he adds, before murmuring a quiet, ‘excuse me,’ and slipping out of the room quickly and silently.
Then his mother inquires if Albus has already decided which NEWTs he’ll take, and Albus lets out a frustrated groan. He doesn’t want to talk about this with her, especially not here, not when every five minutes both Scott sisters and Westen send him surreptitious looks. He shrugs his mother’s questions off, and is glad that the door to the classroom opens after that.
“Who was it?” Scorpius asks silently, a blank look in his grey eyes – a look that almost makes Harry take a step back, as the boy in front of him reminds him painfully much of his father.
Scorpius gives him a jerky nod. “Yeah.” He says quietly, and then turns to go back to his own bed, slumps to sit down on it, and buries his face in his hands.
The rest of his words are muffled, as Harry covers Malfoy’s lips with his, their kisses instantly greedy and slick, their breaths hot against each other’s lips. Harry grips Malfoy; his other hand against his neck, holding him in place for Harry to ravage his mouth; and the other, roaming searchingly over Malfoy’s body, before finally stopping in the middle of his back, where he presses the other man slowly towards him.
They weren’t going to, originally, but then Rose had been questioned and she hadn’t been sure if it had been thirty minutes she had spent with James on the train, or less. And Harry knows, that if there hadn’t been an incident between James and Travers at the party during New Year’s Eve, he wouldn’t have been questioned at all.
Granger leaves the meeting room sometime later, bidding good night and informing Potter that the Weasley clan has left to their homes.
the girl not six months ago, and James had invited her to his place during the holidays. Draco himself hadn’t even heard of the girl before, even though he thinks her family must be one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. But apparently his and Potter’s children did know Miss Travers. Apparently, they knew her well.
To be honest, Harry would be glad if Draco did it for him, but unfortunately, he knew that he had to do it. “Packing takes like half an hour. I don’t understand why I would do it a day before. What if I need something that I already packed? I bet you didn’t think about that.” He almost wanted to show Draco his tang but stopped himself knowing that the blond will most likely not even look up at him.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of the panicking boy in front of him. “Draco what will happen if it touches you?”
Please help with the bullshit happening in Poland. you can sign this petition https://www.change.org/p/mateusz-morawiecki-pass-laws-that-would-protect-lgbt-people-in-poland-and-abolish-current-anti-lgbt-laws?pt=AVBldGl0aW9uAMsFWwEAAAAAXueL2yXj0Ck1ZmMyOTRmZA%3D%3D&source_location=topic_page
He opened his mouth to say something but a hand on his arm stopped him. Draco looked as if he wanted to be anywhere but here. And then he spoke his voice was calm and full of raw emotions.
This couldn't be that easy, could it? It was a way to improve his unconscious, but the shadow would stay. “This is a solution for one problem, the forest, but what about the shadow?”
Suddenly Draco felt as Harry’s hands closed on his right hand. Upon looking down he discovered that he started to scratch on his left hand, the skin was red and painful.
“You just said that you are no longer a Malfoy, yet you became a Death Eater to protect your parents. Is that correct?” Draco knew that this was supposed to be an innocent question, but it made his skin crawl.
Draco couldn’t believe that Harry would care about him enough to willingly be seen with him in public. He didn’t know how to react. He could see that Harry started to fidget under his gaze.
“Don’t worry Mr Black I believe the solution to this problem will be easier than you think, all you have to do is find the answer to the question Who is Draco Malfoy now Black?”
“Do you think that one day we will be free?” He couldn’t get rid of of the hopeful tone from his voice.
The Gryffindor smiled and started to laugh. “Fucking finally guys. I thought that you’re going to bite my head off. I guess congratulations are in order.”
After a long round of congratulation, the usual conversation started. Draco smiled as Harry wiped his eyes, and started to talk with Ron and Hermione once again, this time about more trivial things. He loved watching the trio interact, but sometimes it made him long for his friends that never returned. They still exchanged letter, but he missed hearing Pansy’s voice when she complained, or Blaise’s horrible advises that usually made things worse, he longed to know how they changed. Draco hoped that the three of them would be able to meet once again.
The trio looked at him and began to laugh. Draco felt his cheeks redden. “Harry, you explain.” With that, Ron and Hermione entered the classroom.
“No, it’s not that. You just have a very beautiful laugh.” Harry’s face was rapidly becoming redder and redder.
At the mention of the even Draco’s expression changed and he looked sadder. “My father appareted us and then when the attacks happened he made a House Elf get me home and joined the Death Eaters.”
When he looked down Draco’s face was red and Harry was sure that this meant that Draco actually asked him this question. All he could choke out was yes.
He thought that maybe after everything his parents will finally start to behave as real normal parents, but as always he was disappointed. They were yelling at him, snapping and although they couldn’t use magic on him, his father still had the cane, the cursed cane.
“Harry, darling” Harry loved that Draco used terms like darling or honey to talk to him. Feeling a blush making its way up to his neck, he snuggled closer to Draco and listen as the blonde continued. “It’s already too late. Don’t you remember the opening feast when the two of us held hand the whole time? Besides, I don’t care if people know, I will even allow you to shout it from the Astronomy Tower if you want.”
“I wanted to study but then the chosen one decided to actually open his bag.” The blond was smiling.
“Well the whole exam started horribly, not only did they referred to me as Draco Malfoy but they also decided to once again ask the questions from the written part of the exam, all while I was performing the practical part. But because McGonagall was overseeing the exam, she started to fight with the officials. Their reason for treating me like this was that they needed to know whether I cheated.” Harry snorted at the thought of Draco cheating, the boy practically lived in the library, next to him Hermione and Ron did the same. Draco smiled at them and continued his story. “She told them that she remembers when they were taking their N.E.W.T.s and if she was to compare our accomplishments the two of them would have to repeat the exam if they wanted to pass. After that, she informed them that my last name is Black and I am to be referred to as such.” Harry watched as the smile on Draco’s face grew. “It was all kinda badass.”
He froze in surprise, and Granger looked at her questioningly. Patil bit her lip, clearly regretting her outburst, but then she met his eyes firmly.
Draco’s breath caught as Potter pressed him back gently, taking another step as Draco moved backwards. He stopped when he hit the corridor wall. Potter was so close now he had to tip his head back to look up at Draco. His face was serious, his eyes heated. His right hand slid under the hem of Draco’s jumper, his fingers hot against Draco’s bare skin.
“What reason would anyone have for keeping secrets from their best friend about why they were knocked out in a corridor last night? The world is a mysterious place darling.”
Draco slid closer to her on the bench and pulled her against him, putting his arm around her. She leaned into him, hiding her face.
Potter stuck his cigarette between his lips, and shrugged into his leather jacket. It was a little too big for him, but he wore it well. They hurried up the slope to the edge of the village, catching up with the Professor’s.
He knew she had been raised with the same blood purity ideals that he had. His aunt Bella had grown up in the same house as his mother, and had been very passionate about the subject, and about the Dark Lord, but his aunt Andromeda had gone a completely different way. He didn’t have many memories of his Black grandparents, they had both died when he was still very young, but he did remember how terrifying Cygnus Black had been, right until the end.
Everyone froze. Even McGonagall, who had clearly been about to intervene. Terry Boot stared at Potter with his mouth open.
Justin had a hundred questions when he got back on Saturday, none of which Draco knew how to answer. What WAS he going to tell his friends? Hermione already knew, and he suspected that Luna might. They were the only people Potter really trusted. He’d have to tell Justin and Pansy, probably Blaise too. He couldn’t lie to them, but he wasn’t quite ready to say anything yet.
“Ernie, you remember Malfoy I’m sure. He'll be joining us this morning,” Finch-Fletchley said as though he were introducing them at a garden party.
This was all wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong because Draco realised just how much he wanted this. How much he wanted Potter, but Potter was drunk, and Draco was just a warm body. Potter probably didn’t know what he was doing, and would be horrified in the morning.
He felt the sofa shift as someone thumped down into the seat beside him. He slanted his head to the side and opened his eyes to see who it was. He froze.
It was impossible to reconcile this commanding man, who spoke with so much authority, with the boy who had not an hour before been doing shots during the Sorting.
By eleven o’clock he was ready. Justin looked him up and down as he pulled on a knee length wool coat and grey scarf. He smiled when Justin nodded in approval, then batted his hands away when he tried to readjust Draco’s scarf.
“There are a few extra things I need to discuss with you. As you know everyone left in your year group was offered the chance to return to complete your final year in education. It wasn’t the right choice for everybody, but for the few of you who are here we have had to make a some changes. You’re all going to have very different schedules, and I’ve decided not to place any of the usual curfew restrictions on you. To make things easier you will all have your own group common room and dormitories separated from your Houses, located in Central Tower.”
“Andi wanted to talk about... well I think she was trying to do like an intervention? They’re still writing about me all the time in the paper, and she’s been worrying. I spent quite a lot of time over her place in the summer, bonding with the little terror to give her a break.”
“It’s just... OK, so, Cho made me go there on a date in fifth year and it was so awful. It was Valentine’s day, and she was always getting upset about Cedric. Obviously back then I didn’t realise why the whole thing made me so uncomfortable. So I guess it has bad connotations for me? Plus have you seen it? It’s so ugly and frilly in there!” he ended emphatically.
He didn’t want to think that she was involved with this, but he knew that she must know about his stupid crush on Potter. He didn’t hide it very well. Maybe she had mentioned it, and Potter had decided to pull this stunt for his own amusement.
“I thought it was painfully obvious. I’ll have to hand in my queer card for the shame of it,” she mumbled into her hands.
Potter shrugged, and held out his arms by way of explanation. Blood was still slowly oozing from some of the deeper cuts.
“Then why don’t you go and sleep under the Whomping Willow,” drawled Harry Potter, looking lazily at Boot.
“I thought the shock might catch up with you. You were doing astonishingly well to stay conscious with the injuries you have. You have a small bit of internal bleeding, but these will sort that out.”
Whatever he had been expecting Draco to do, it clearly wasn’t that. Finch-Fletchley’s firm expression softened in surprise, and then his manners kicked in automatically as he bounced forward to take Draco’s hand and shake it vigorously.
“Don’t know what?” he was starting to feel anxious. He twisted the sheets in his fists, staring into Lovegood's calm silver eyes. Malfoy eyes.
His blush deepened when Potter caught him staring. He paused, watching Draco watch him. He reached up to catch his cigarette as it tilted when he took a long drag, cocking his head to the side to consider Draco by the fire, looking soft and innocent.
“I... OK,” he said, choosing to have faith in someone for a change. If anyone was worthy of trust, it was Hermione.
“Harry,” he said again, the unmistakable warning in his tone had Potter looking at the floor and clenching his fists.
The alarmed gasp surprised him, and he jerked reflexively, curling into a defensive position. His left leg didn’t feel right but he couldn’t figure out why.
The world outside the window was white and grey. Snow fell thickly from a steely sky. He couldn’t tell what time it was.
He woke up in the grey light of morning, covered in blankets, Pansy still wrapped around him. He lay still for awhile, listening to her breathe and mutter in her sleep. He dozed in and out, but the dim light remained the same every time he opened his eyes. Eventually he had to get up, so he slid out of Pansy’s grasp. She huffed in her sleep and rolled over, murmuring about peanut butter pancakes. Draco smirked.
“I’m sure you’re a peach Finch-Fletchley, but speak for yourself darling. I am grace personified,” said Pansy through a mouthful of eggs.
They were standing close together on the dark street, the lights from the houses spilling orange warmth across the snow, and Potter was looking up at him with that same complicated expression he had worn in the pub. It was fear mixed with something else.
Life settled into a routine over the next few weeks. He endured harassment from the Hogwarts student body. He spent time with Luna. He danced around the dorm room with Justin. He even studied with Granger and Patil on a regular basis.
The common room was chaos. Almost 60 kids in a room built for 20 was always going to be a recipe for disaster.
Blaise’s black-banded owl Nyx landed on the table at breakfast, with a letter from his mother and The Daily Prophet.
He glanced over at Justin’s bed. He was awake, his eyes blinking slowly from a mound of pillows, a small worried frown between his eyes.
“Why did you want to know?” Daphne asked curiously, looking at the article with her chin on Theo's shoulder.
In the end they picked out straight, dark grey jeans tucked into brown leather boots, with a tailored white shirt layered under a caramel coloured cashmere jumper.
It was so crowded that most of the furniture had been shrunk down and stored away in a shoe box. People were standing in groups on the stairs. Draco had seen a girl almost fall into the fire because she’d tried to sit on the hearth.
“Of course not!” Pansy says angrily to Draco, as though he had been the one to suggest that Patil was ashamed of her in the first place.
“I don’t need to go to the hospital wing. I’m sure I can fix it myself if my head would just stop spinning.”
His body had filled out. He no longer looked underfed, he was now leanly muscled and solid. His ripped jeans and simple black vest did little to hide his figure. His exposed bicep bulged as he bought the cigarette he was holding to his lips. Draco’s eyes widened as he registered that Potter had painted his fingernails in rainbow colours, and the dark copper skin of his arms was patterned with intricate black tattoo’s.
When he’d expressed this interest, his father had been horrified. He’d been forbidden. Nothing about muggles was acceptable to his father.
She got to her feet slowly, and Draco scrambled up after her. She put her hand on his arm to still him.
The longer the ceremony went on, the louder Potter’s circle was getting. They banged their cutlery and performed little Mexican waves as each tiny new Gryffindor stumbled their way to the table. It didn’t take long for Draco to figure out why when he saw the flash of a silver flask being passed from Finnigan to Potter.
“I thought Harry and Ron would look after each other,” she continued, sniffing, “but by the time I got home everything had fallen apart. I shouldn’t have left.”
Potter sat back a little, and Draco could practically see his internal panic and indecision, before he glanced at the menu again and gave a small, jerky nod.
He shrugged. Draco was a little gobsmacked. He couldn’t imagine telling his parents. They’d probably always had some idea, but it was an unspoken rule between them that it was just not discussed. If nobody talked about it, they could pretend it wasn’t real.
“No, it is. After the battle, I think we were all in shock. Harry had held it together for so long, and he just slept for days. The Weasley’s were in pieces without Fred, and I... I left. I went to Australia,” her eyes were glazed, lost in memories.
To continue this story, and for further details of Potter’s illicit behaviour, please turn to pages 4 and 5.”
There was an awkward silence as Draco moved into the room, looking around. The purple theme had been continued into the dorm rooms it seemed. Unlike his dark mahogany four poster in the dungeons with it’s green and silver hangings and snake carvings, this four poster was a lighter, honey coloured wood with flowers carved to climb up the posts. The curtains and bed spread were both deep purple, with cream sheets, and pillows piled up. It looked very comfy and Draco was suddenly very tired. His black and silver trunk looked out of place at the foot of the bed. There was a wardrobe and a set of drawers to one side, and a desk under a window. Draco was caught up for a moment starting out of the window at the dark forest and the thousands of stars clear in the sky. He was so used to the greenish black oppression of the lake through his room windows in the dungeon.
Draco had thought about it a lot, and he really wanted to make things right with Granger. Even if he could just give her some sort of closure, he wasn’t expecting anything back. Obviously the Slytherin in him knew it would be in his best interest to get her public forgiveness, but he’d done a lot of work to beat that side of his Slytherin nature down. Looking at her without the shit coloured glasses of bigotry on, he realised he actually liked her.
“Fine,” Draco rolled his eyes, “but you’re coming with me to be my glass carrying bitch.” He shoved Blaise, who grinned and started taking people’s orders.
The room Potter shared with Theo was so messy it made Draco twitch. He only knew which bed belonged to Potter because he saw his new Firebolt leaning against the wall on the right side of the room. There were clothes everywhere, dirty or clean Draco couldn’t tell. Half the mugs from the common room seemed to have found their way in here, balancing precariously on every surface, mostly still half full of cold tea and cigarette butt’s. The draws in the chest of draws were all hanging open. A half eaten ham sandwich was resting on a pile of school books, and old Quiddich magazines were strewn about. The bed sheets were in chaos, and Draco felt his whole body flush when he spotted a bottle of lube lying casually on the shelf beside the bed.
He didn’t tell anyone else about the possible date. He was still convinced it wasn’t a date, just a terrible miscommunication, but he’d committed to seeing it through. Maybe. He thought about cancelling a lot, or hoping something would happen which would make meeting Potter impossible through no fault of his own. He wasn’t sure if he didn’t want to tell Pansy and Blaise because they would think it was a good idea or a bad idea. If they though it was a good idea, it was more pressure that he knew he couldn’t cope with. He already knew all the reasons that it was a bad idea because he’d thought about it extensively. He didn’t know if he wanted them to talk him out of it or not.
Pansy was disappointed that Patil had refused to speak to her since the party, but she was dealing with it in a typically Pansy way. Pretending she didn’t care. She brushed it off whenever Draco tried to discuss it with her, or deflected by asking pointed questions about where Draco had disappeared to so early in the evening. He deflected right back, so they were in a sort of stalemate about the whole thing.
When he looked up, he saw Potter staring at him from across the table, biting his lip. Draco flushed and forced his gaze away, focusing back on Luna.
He finished his careful work, running his fingers through them all to check he hadn’t missed any hair. Satisfied he drew his legs up to his chest, hugging his arms around them, and resting his chin on his knees. It pulled sickeningly against the bruise on his stomach, but he stayed as he was and watched the flames dance in the fire as the room got steadily lighter.
They carried on singing and dancing and laughing until they were breathless. Draco felt some of his jittery nerves be soothed by the joy of the music.
He headed over to Granger and the Ravenclaw girls, leaning over the back of the sofa to look down at Patil.
It ranged from hisses and mutters of “Death Eater”, and worse, in the hallways between classes, to physical torment. Draco decided that whoever had invented the stinging jinx was an irredeemable monster. He’d end each day covered in burning welts no matter what he did. He’d repaired his book bag so many times from well aimed severing charms that it was practically threadbare. His knees were bruised from hitting the stone floor so often, stumbling over tripping jinxes wherever he went.
Potter’s face was relaxed in sleep, and Draco was lost for a minute, mapping the planes of his face with his eyes. He really was beautiful.
He’d be full to bursting with half a potions cabinet at this rate. He downed it quickly. This potion tasted refreshingly like peppermint. His headache receded to nothing and he stopped feeling dizzy.
She leaned forward and took hold of his hand, stilling his fingers from twisting the sheet into a knot.
That couldn’t be right. He only had two aunts. His loony ex Aunt Bella, and his Aunt Andromeda, who he had never met.
“Come on Ron, it’s your turn. Seems to be ‘Ask Harry Hour', what you got?” he challenged Weasley hotly.
Everyone was silent, processing this statement. Draco looked up, and noticed that a few people didn’t look very happy and Terry Boot looked furious. He was surprised, he thought Ravenclaws especially would like more freedom in their education.
“What did they say?” Draco asked hesitantly, sitting up straight. He wasn’t sure if he really wanted to know.
“Well it depends,” he said quietly, “I like potions so I might see if I can get a job in  an apothecary, or apprentice a Potions Master maybe.”
He felt fine, although a bit grimy from rolling around on the floor. Luna stepped out while he pulled his clothes back on, then they walked out of the Hospital wing together.
“You little shit Justin! You said you wouldn’t tell anyone about that,” MacMillan whined as he blushed beetroot red and refilled his drink.
“I don’t want to fake break up,” he said softly, smiling crookedly through his sadness, “I do really need this Draco. I promise I’ll try to do better. I want to be better.”
Pansy and Justin held him tightly as he shook. Pansy ran her fingers through his hair, and Justin rubbed his back, making soothing noises.
“They live in water so one would assume that they do, or at least absorb water through their skin,” he answered thoughtfully.
The people around them jumped back, away from the shower of ale and glass. Potter darted forwards with an enraged growl, his wand already twirling and slashing through the air. Howard’s wand was barely out of his pocket when it was ripped from his grasp and clattered across the pub floor.
His instinct was to become defensive and angry, but he took a deep breath, and smiled widely at the other two boys. They both drew back slightly, which Draco chose to ignore, as he moved to close the door on them gently.
Draco shared a grin with Justin, before they both went back to watching the snow in mesmerised silence.
Draco chuckled in agreement as Pansy went back to her lunch. He relaxed slightly, but after a few mouthfuls of soup she said casually, “so what did Padma say?”
Draco put down his quill and stared after him. He had no idea what that had been about. Why would Potter want to go out with him for any reason?
“I can agree with you on that,” Draco said, “but the coffee is too good, so I have to make allowances.”
“Ergh, I’ve always hated that nickname. ‘The Golden Trio’, ridiculous. When we became friends we were just outcasts. That makes us sound like a folk band or something.”
“He sounds like he’d get on well with Hagrid. He’s a bit dragon mad too,” Potter said, before looking down at the bowl in front of him in surprise.
Draco had no idea what that meant. He looked between them, but neither of them seemed inclined to elaborate.
Justin Finch-Fletchley was petite for an 18 year old boy. He was slender with a mass of curly brown hair, big soft hazel eyes, and a pouty mouth. Far too pretty in Draco’s opinion, and annoyingly flamboyant. He was currently wearing a tight pink t-shirt which was emblazoned with the words “Girl Power", and yellow pyjama trousers. His small feet were bare, and his toe nails were painted baby pink. Blaise found Finch-Fletchley's obvious queerness to be boring, he liked a challenge. Draco found it unsettling.
“My parents,” she shrugged. “When I decided to help Harry fight Voldemort I knew my parents would be in danger. I wiped their memories of me and sent them to Australia to keep them safe. I went to find them, but when I did... well I couldn’t undo what I’d done. I stayed for a while to make sure they’re happy, and they are. They have a really nice life out there,” she stopped, hiccupping as silent tears tracked down her chestnut brown cheeks.
Draco bit his lip to hold in a laugh. He started to translate the menu out loud, running down the short list of items. Raphael hadn’t updated the menu much since the last time Draco had been here. He clearly knew what his patrons liked.
In the month that followed the party the rumour mill was working overtime. Gossip about Potter and his night time exploits, sometimes day time exploits, ran like fiend fire through the school. Whispers in the Great Hall. Notes passed in classes. Graffiti in the toilets. Potter was spotted behind greenhouse 3 with a sixth year Hufflepuff. Potter was caught in the Prefects bathroom with a Ravenclaw Prefect and the Head boy. Potter was seen coming out of a broom closet with a Gryffindor seventh year.
They both heard the soft footsteps heading towards them at the same time, and looked up. As though he had been summoned, Potter appeared around the corner. When he saw the pair of them on the floor he paused, but he didn’t look surprised.
He must have drifted off, because the next thing he knew was the sound of insistent knocking on his bedroom door.
Technically there hadn’t been much for the Ministry to charge his mother with. She never took the mark. She wasn’t a Death Eater, and it wasn’t a crime to be married to one. She’d only been allowed in meetings which happened at her own house as a courtesy. She never hurt anyone, or took part in missions. She had been following her husbands wishes, and trying to do what she thought was best to keep her son safe. She’d been arrested along with Draco after the final battle, both of them confined to Malfoy Manor under guard. While the Ministry fumbled around trying to find something they could convict Narcissa Malfoy for, Harry Potter had come forward to say that without Narcissa’s help, he would never have been able to defeat the Dark Lord.
They had just made it to the second landing of Hospital Tower, when they rounded the corner and ran headlong into Ginny Weasley. Lovegood jumped so hard that she let go of Draco, and he nearly tumbled backwards down his second flight of stairs of the day, before Weasley snatched out a hand and caught the strap of his bag, steadying him.
“Tell me what all this has been for then Potter!” Draco demanded. His wand was in his hand and he didn’t remember pulling it out.
Pansy glanced over his shoulder, and raised her eyebrows in surprise. He swivelled on the bench and saw Luna making her way towards him, with Girl Weasley in tow looking very unhappy.
Blaise had been right. Potter’s antics on the train were the only thing people seemed to want to talk about. Draco was more than a little bit relieved, as no one even glanced his way in the Great Hall. A lot of people were peering over to the Hufflepuff table, where Finch-Fletchley was surrounded by giggling girls, his ears very pink. Most people were staring at Potter, taking in his new look, and whispering behind their hands. Potter himself seemed completely unfazed by the attention, which wasn’t really anything new for him anyway Draco surmised. What had surprised Draco was where Potter had decided to sit at the Gryffindor table. He was laughing with Finnigan and Thomas, bracketed by Patil and the newly scarred Brown. A little way down the table Granger and Weasley sat with Longbottom. The three of them kept throwing disapproving looks towards Potter, feathers clearly ruffled like a gaggle of clucking hens.
Draco worked himself into a panic all day Sunday, worrying about what would happen the next time he ran into Potter. He needn’t have bothered. Potter looked right through him at breakfast on Monday. He ignored Draco more than he had before. Draco wasn’t sure if he was relieved or devastated.
Potter paused to look over at Draco, as though he were checking that he was following and knew who he meant. Draco nodded jerkily. He knew who his own aunt was, in name only but still. He’d had no idea that Potter knew her well enough to receive early morning letters.
“That doesn’t matter to them. I’ll always be a Death Eater in their eyes. Honestly, tell me why you think this crazy plan would work?”
Draco saw a flash of movement out of the corner of his eye, and turned to see a beefy, red faced man bearing down on them.
They were all taking Arithmancy, so they worked together on the problems they had been given in the last class, and they found that they worked very well together. Granger didn’t ask Draco any more personal questions, and he relaxed a little bit. He was fascinated by the ways all their minds worked. Granger’s shrewd logic, Luna’s unique approach, and Patil’s perfectionism.
They sat next to the Ravenclaws. Terry Boot shot a dark look Draco’s way, but nothing else was said under McGonagall’s knowing gaze.
“What about you? I’ve seen your ‘googly eyes' for Pansy, and you could actually do something about it,” he accused her. He was doing this then.
He did a bit of window shopping, and bought some new quills. He killed an hour in the bookshop, but didn’t buy anything this time.
“Blasting spell of some sort I think Madam Pomfrey. I found him on the floor at the bottom of the back stairs by the library, and obviously his leg is broken. You might want to check for a concussion too, and who knows what else,” reported Lovegood efficiently.
A few more people turned to look angrily at Boot, who seemed unsure of himself now he’d lost a bit of his high ground.
“He’s incredibly dense, and he doesn’t know us,” Draco replied, before covering his face with one hand to hide his own laughter as she started wiggling around obscenely in his lap.
He couldn’t remember the exact wand movement for the spell used on bruises so he just left it, slipping out of the bed to put on his pyjamas. He’d have to look for the notes he made last year on healing magic. When he pulled on his loose trousers he noticed 5 little bruises on his forearm where Boot had grabbed him and he paused. Looking at them made him think about all the other times he’d had similar marks. He sat on the edge of his bed.
It was growing, and seeing Potter return to school every year more beautiful than before. It was fear and horror, as his obsession shifted. It was longing and envy.
Everyone was staring at Potter like he’d just told a joke at a funeral. Granger looked like she was torn between being horrified and proud. Draco didn’t know what to think. Had Harry Potter just defended him to all his peers? He felt numb, but he knew he would probably freak out later. At least the shock had shaken off his panic attack.
“We’ve all made mistakes. Some of them bigger than others, but still mistakes. We’ve all done things because it’s what was expected, rather than what we wanted.” Potter continued quietly. He glanced at Weasley and Granger. She was watching him steadily, but Weasley looked away.
“Now go forth and embarrass yourselves!” he cried, downing his shot, causing several heads to turn their way. They all followed suit, tipping the burning spirit down and coughing roughly.
“Also... Hermione suggested it. She was pretty insistent, and if she thinks you’re a good idea, I’m not arguing. She’s only just started speaking to me again.”
“I’m just really feeling this grungy butch vibe you’ve got going on. You should consider a haircut to complete the look.”
He made it to the stairs up to the dorms. A few small groups of people were sitting on the spiral stone steps chatting and drinking. He tripped over them, apologising. He made it to the first landing, and jumped when a gaggle of girls came clattering out of the bathroom, shrieking together and holding each other up.
“Never have I ever gotten a Dark Mark,” said Boot mockingly from outside the circle. Draco hadn’t even noticed him approach.
“I appreciate that you’re working on your flaws Malfoy. I’ve been watching you since school started, and I have been surprised. You’re getting on with Justin, and you’ve accepted Luna as your cousin, which is really great... but you tormented me and my friends for years, not to mention everything that happened during the war. I don’t know if I can forgive you just like that.”
“You don’t expect us to live with them do you?” Boot burst out, pointing an accusing finger at the Slytherin’s.
Draco couldn’t believe the nerve of people. It was one thing to torment him, he was an ex Death Eater, a bad guy, but by all rights Potter should be untouchable. That people could be so homophobic, even to someone who had sacrificed everything to save the wizarding world, was mind boggling. It frightened him.
“Oh,” she blinked and then looked down at her notes. “I always used to struggle with that too before I worked out that the Ohm and the Anth only refer to the past when paired with an Umlaut.”
Potter sat down carefully, as if he were afraid that Draco might bolt if he made any sudden movements. The twitchiness continued, his fingers drumming on the table. His face was expressionless, but his green eyes darted around.
“I’m happy with how this looks, it should be good as new in another hour or so. You’re free to go if you feel better Mr Malfoy.”
Luna had tried to give Draco the photograph, but he refused. It was her mother, and Draco didn’t want to remember his father like that, as an innocent. His father had made his choices. Now Draco would make his. He was finished with trying to make his father proud. He’d rather live a life that Pandora would be proud of.
He froze, and then faced her, looking at her open and earnest expression. She honestly believed he could change for the better. He felt the wall that was inside him crumble a little. Before he knew what he was doing, he pulled her forwards into a firm hug. She tensed, surprised, but then she relaxed against him and wrapped her arms around his waist.
Draco could only speculate, but if he had to guess he’d say that Granger especially did not approve of Potter’s current choices. A rift appeared to have formed in the Golden Trio.
“Noted,” Blaise grimaced, peering around a pair of grizzly old wizards clutching smoking goblets at the bar, looking for Madam Rosmerta.
His father had been so proud to see his only son held down and branded, like cattle. That was all he’d ever truly been.
He started up the next spiral staircase to the boys dorms. These were thankfully empty, but when he was half way up, he heard footsteps behind him. He quickened his pace, hurrying up the last of the stairs. The footsteps behind him sped up too.
I don’t let myself wonder about how they would have reacted if I were an only child. Why make oneself miserable over something that isn’t the case. Honestly, it’s easier for them to understand my being gay than it is for them to understand my being a wizard. I do wonder how all the abnormalities in our family fell on me.”
He refused to look at Draco again as they paid, and pulled on their coats to go back out onto the freezing street.
Now Justin understood the goal, he began to rifle through Draco’s wardrobe too. He held up shirts, before tossing them aside.
On Saturday morning he woke up early as he always did, but this time he cursed his internal alarm clock. He didn’t need the hours and hours stretching ahead of him to fret. He stayed in bed, trying to go back to sleep to kill some time, willing himself to have a lie in just once. To channel Pansy’s affinity for sleep.
Now it was Saturday afternoon, the party was hours away, and Draco was lying on his stomach on Pansy’s bed while she held up dresses for his opinion. He was moodily resigned to the fact that he had to make an appearance at this party, but he secretly planned to hide in his room if things got too hectic. Who would miss him?
He was still wearing his clothes from the night before, so he padded down to the bathroom to have a quick shower and get changed. His hand throbbed, and he finally remembered to heal himself before the cut could get infected.
“I don’t know what to do. His grades have dropped, he misses half his classes, he barely does any homework, and I’m pretty sure he turned up to Defence the other day drunk! Professor Beckett definitely noticed, and I think he’s reporting back to Kingsley about him. He’s going to fail all his NEWTs and he doesn’t even care!”
At some point he wandered down to breakfast by himself, collected a giant mug of coffee and a pastry from the almost completely empty Hall, and went back to the common room. It was Saturday, and still too early for most students to be up and about. He fetched his books and settled at one of the big round study tables, spreading his notes around and finally cracking open the homework he couldn’t start earlier. He felt oddly peaceful. His body still ached but his time alone and his run in with Potter had calmed him somehow.
“Nowhere Pans! I’ve been here. I was looking for you for bloody ages! Where have YOU been?” he shot back at her.
“Are you supposed to be somewhere now? I could run and tell someone where you are once we’re at the hospital wing?”
He flicked his wand at the record player and the music was silenced. They left the room together for the empty hall. As they passed a door flew open, and Longbottom hurried out on his way to the bathroom. He paused when he saw them, his eyes flicking between them as his brow furrowed in confusion.
“Sometimes I guess, I mean I don’t keep tabs on the guy? We don’t talk about our day while we braid each others hair every night. Why do you ask?”
He gradually became aware of a whispered argument on the other side of the curtains. Curious he sat forwards, straining to pick out the words.
Granger kept looking up from her work and glancing between Draco and Luna with a quizzical expression. He could tell she was burning with curiosity as to what they were doing together. Eventually the curiosity won, and she put down her quill.
It was an archaic rule, steeped in Malfoy family tradition, that Draco couldn’t bypass even if he tried. By wizarding law a person came of age at 17, but Malfoy law withheld trust money until the age of 18 because it was tradition that a Malfoy would be engaged by their 18th birthday.
Potter, unaware of Draco’s sudden mental panic, ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, then wrapped his hand around the back of Draco’s neck. He pulled him down and leaned up to meet him in a kiss, but Draco wrenched his head back. He used his grip on Potter’s arms to push him backwards.
Once Draco was happy with his clothes, he stacked his books on the bookshelf next to his desk. He organised his school books by subject and then by relevance. On the bottom shelves he arranged the extra books he’d brought from home, making sure his favourites were the most accessible from the desk, and organising the rest by how interesting he thought they were. He had been so absorbed by his task that when he was done he looked around and realised the room had gone quiet. Finch-Fletchley was in bed, lying on his stomach and watching Draco with grin on his face.
A brief flurry of conversation picked up around the group as people decided if they wanted to play or not. Some got up, looking nervous, and moved off to sit on the other side of the common room. All the Gryffindor’s remained, plus MacMillan and Justin, Turpin and Padma Patil, and the Slytherin’s, except for Theo who had passed out asleep in a chair closest to the fire.
Finch-Fletchley grinned again, his little heart shaped face all lit up. He held out his hand to Draco.
He sat on the bed and reluctantly shrugged out of his uniform. He avoided her eyes, but he still saw the way her lips pursed when she spotted the patchwork of half healed to fresh stinging jinx marks all over his torso. He was still researching a way to get rid of them, but hadn’t been successful just yet.
“Thank you for the drinks Draco,” she said softly, fishing a cherry out of her glass, “I’m saving my money for travelling after school finishes.”
At the edge of the crowd that had gathered was a young man, grinning from ear to ear as he took picture after picture of the fight.
“Fine then, but know that if your attitude doesn’t improve dramatically, I won’t be able to accept your application to be an Auror. The Ministry cannot be seen to employ someone so publicly unstable. It will effect the image we are trying to build.”
“No Pansy! Just let it go. They’ve had a shot at me, I’m sure they all feel much better. For all I know it could have been Theo because I forgot to remind him about the Transfiguration homework, it doesn’t matter.”
Draco grinned. He sat back sipping his drink, and realised his hair was still damp from the snow. He could feel the wet ends soaking into the back of his jumper. He checked his wrists and his pockets for a spare hair tie but came up empty. Luna must have noticed because she leaned towards him, sliding off the orange sequin scrunchie she was wearing on her wrist and handing it to him. He pulled his hair up, twisting it and securing a high bun with the scrunchie. A few loose stands of hair fell softly around his face, and he couldn’t be bothered to redo the bun to catch them.
Draco, who had talked about his day with Justin while giving him a French plait the night before, huffed a laugh at the mental image of Theo and Potter doing the same. He turned and tugged a copy of the Prophet out of Tracey’s hands, ignoring her cry of annoyance, and handed the front page to Theo. He scanned it, then frowned and read it more carefully. When he looked up his eyes were round with shock.
“You think?” she asked, raising her head finally to look at him, a glossy magazine page stuck to her cheek.
“Oooo! Never have I Ever!” cried Tracey, jumping up and gathering alcohol to bring back to the circle for easy access.
“What’s that supposed to mean? Do you know something? Did she say something? What was it?” Pansy demanded.
“That's just it. We've grown into ourselves a little bit more now, but we were just kids then. I was a know-it-all, desperate to be perfect, muggleborn. Ron was the sixth of his brothers to come here, no one expected anything from him... and Harry? He was Harry Potter, the boy who lived, but he was also a half starved orphan, who had nothing but the enormous expectation of strangers heaped on him.”
Draco had a similar sense. The majority of students were offended that the Prophet had come for their Hero and their Headmistress. He was more concerned about how the magical population would react to the story.
Two weeks later, the first snow fell on Hogwarts, and Hermione sat down next to Draco at lunch. Students up and down the table stared at them in confusion, including Weasley, who was at the other end of the table and looked like he had been waiting for her. Pansy’s spoon was frozen half way between her mouth and her soup. Draco elbowed her in the side, and turned to smile quizzically at Hermione.
She’d been helping to distract him from his anxiety about the party. She had visited him at the eighth year table for at least one meal a day during the last week. They had studied together in the library a few times as well. Draco was starting to rely on Luna’s extraordinary memory to fill in the gaps in his notes, and wished they took more of the same classes.
A few people shifted awkwardly. Draco, who had already felt on the verge of a panic attack, was too busy concentrating on breathing to decide how to react to this. He knew how he would have responded before the war, but he didn’t think he had the right to defend himself any more. Pansy on the other hand was already bristling. She opened her mouth, but Draco reached out and squeezed her hand to stop her.
“I think people always assume everyone is straight. Sometimes only because of the fear of being presumptuous, but mostly because that’s the way the world is. And I think you’ve had no success with Ravenclaw Patil because you haven’t actually ever spoken to her.”
The players settled in a loose semi circle around the fireplace. Draco sat on the floor in front of Pansy, leaning against her legs. She ran her fingers lightly through his wavy hair. He was suddenly nervous, and he felt all jittery. Justin came and sprawled out next to him, and squeezed his shoulder. Draco felt a little better.
“I’ve been talking to Harry. We’re... a bit better, and I thought it might help to get out of the castle. Luna is coming, and Padma,” she glanced past Draco, and he realised Pansy was listening intently.
“I overheard them saying some disgusting things about Justin, which I won’t repeat... when I challenged them about it, one of them asked me what Voldemort did to me to turn me into ‘a fucking faggot',” he said, his voice rough.
There was a moment when the whole room stood frozen, staring as Potter wiped a bloody hand across his mouth. The music changed track, and everyone turned away and carried on with the party as though nothing had happened.
While the ink dried he got dressed, wrapping up warm. He might as well send the letter right away before he changed his mind, or tried to rewrite it again.
“I’m so happy to welcome you all here today,” McGonagall began, pausing to smile around at the overcrowded Hall. “We have emerged from a terrible darkness. We have faced many battles, and tragedies. We have lost friends and family. Let’s take a moment of silence to remember all those who were taken from us.”
“Hermione and Luna were so worried about you,” Justin said softly, “Hermione went to talk to Madam Rosmerta for ages, and Blaise gave her some money to cover any damages. He said you owe him.”
The smile slid off Draco’s face when Potter claimed the spot on Luna's other side, straddling the bench between his thighs so he was facing her. He had a little yellow duck charm hanging from his left ear today, and his eyes were ringed with smudged purple eyeshadow.
“Good morning Draco,” said Luna brightly when she reached the table. “Mind if I join your for breakfast?”
Draco disliked the place too. Unfortunately it was the only place to get a good cup of coffee in the village. The maple scones were a pretty big draw as well, but the decor was just atrocious. He didn’t think Potter would care about something like that though.
“You really do like books then old boy? I’ve been trying to figure out how you arranged them, and I can’t see any patterns or order there myself.”
Blaise laughed, clearly relishing the gossip no matter what he said to the contrary. Pansy looked incredulous, still shooting glances at Draco to judge how he was taking this earth shattering news. Draco’s mind had gone blank with shock as he tried to process what he’d just been told. Potter winking at him on the platform played in a loop behind his eyes, and the churning in his stomach could only be panic. Outwardly he tried to project a bored nonchalance and smiled along with Blaise’s amusement.
She lunged at him and wrapped her arms around his middle, burying her face in his chest. He tried not to whimper as she squeezed his bruised body.
He’d left the lamp on, but the edges of the room were still shadowy, and the darkness of his earlier thoughts were waiting there. He turned his focus to the knocking, and staggered up out of bed.
Pansy lamented drunkenly for a full half hour about what it could mean. Draco felt drowsy, but he let her ramble. Merlin only knew how many times she’d listened to his drunken monologues.
While the whole school was watching Potter, they were very pointedly not watching him. In that blind spot it started slowly. He’d expected it from Gryffindor’s and maybe Ravenclaw’s, but it was all of them. Those fiercely loyal Hufflepuff’s were just as vicious as any of the others. The Slytherin’s either hated him because they wanted to distance themselves from their terrible past, or they hated him for being a traitor.
She was looking down at Draco, and her jaw had a determined set. He was afraid of what she might say. She was steeling herself for something.
His own mother didn’t want him anymore, why would he think that Potter would be any different. He’d already failed at this relationship, and it wasn’t even real.
Draco looked back at his cold toast quickly. He’d been staring at Potter again. He had to stop doing that.
Hermione was avoiding him. He did really want to be mad at her for not explaining what was going on herself, but then he had been the one to tell her not to take responsibility for everything Potter did.
Draco Malfoy had stared evil in the face. He’d lived with it in his home. He’d spent every waking moment of the last year in perpetual terror. He may be a coward in a general sense, but he wasn’t afraid of Terry fucking Boot.
Pansy was dithering about in her underwear, stuck between a silky navy slip dress and a black velvet mini dress. Draco had already told her he preferred the navy, but she liked the black, so he was ignoring her monologue about fabrics and flicking through an old copy of Witch Weekly, when there was a knock at the door. Before either of them could react, the door swung open. Padma Patil stood in the doorway, her light brown skin flushed with warmth as she zeroed in on Pansy, who was mostly naked.
He’d grown up in a family run by hatred and fear, where all that mattered was the perfect persona they showed to the world. Their fragile power was built on the assumption that they were better than everyone else, and anything which threatened to pull back the curtain and reveal the bullshit must be stamped out quickly.
A victorious grin flashed across Howard’s face, and he threw down the drink he was holding to draw his wand.
“Late? Potter, you were supposed to be here eight hours ago. That’s not late, that’s just not turning up. AND you were late for our date...” Draco argued, clenching his fists in his blankets.
“Um, can I say something without you getting offended Malfoy?” Finch-Fletchley asked out of the blue while he was picking up all his discarded outfit selections.
“I thought everything would be better,” she confessed to her knees, her voice muffled through her fingers. “I thought this year would be so easy, not like every other crazy year we’ve had at this school.”
“Um, no, not at all. I was just wondering if you had done the translation for Ancient Runes? I always have trouble when it’s a past participle,” he blurted out.
Draco remembered the conversation he had overheard Hermione have with Luna. It sounded like she was still struggling with a solution to her problem.
He whimpered under the jet from the shower, and soon his muscles started to relax. He washed his hair carefully. The long fine blonde strands were like silk in the water. He’d hated it at first because he didn’t want to look any more like his father, but he hadn’t been able to get it cut over the summer and it grew so fast. Now his father’s gleaming golden hair had been shaved to nothing by the prison guards at Azkaban, and his own silver platinum locks didn’t look so bad. He styled it differently, favouring a dramatic side part, and he really enjoyed plaiting it whenever he was stressed. He remembered when he was little all he’d wanted to do was play hairstylist with his father’s hair, but he’d never been allowed to even touch it.
Central Tower had been almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Hogwarts, but it had been rebuilt better than before. When the password was spoken to the tapestry, it parted down the middle like a pair of curtains revealing a heavy wooden door. Beyond that a winding staircase led up to a large square common room, which was decorated in shades of cream and purple. McGonagall had really made an effort to ignore House colours. By the time Draco, Pansy, and Blaise made it up the tower most of their classmates had already dispersed, disappearing through an archway which seemed to lead up another staircase. Draco could hear the clamour of distant voices as people began to discuss the evening. Potter was no where to be seen.
It was the afternoon, and most students were in classes now so the corridors were blessedly quiet. He thought about that Gryffindor boy, who’s name he didn’t know, sitting in Transfiguration or something, probably feeling pretty good about life now he’d blasted an evil Death Eater down a flight of stairs and avenged his cousin. Draco felt sick.
She studied him for a moment longer, and then picked up her magazine. Draco was relieved she had clearly decided to drop it for now, but not 5 minutes later she began to laugh loudly. She wheezed, clutching her stomach, and flapped the magazine towards him. He stared at her in alarm, before realising she had Witch Weekly open to the centre spread. A bold headline across the top of the piece proclaimed “Harry Potter and the Women in his Life: Which Witch will the Chosen One Choose?”
“Of course. Why do you think I’m forbidding it. Anyway, I was just having a study session with Ravenclaw Patil, and you’re wasting time talking about me?”
There was an abrupt shift in attentiveness at her words. People sat up straighter and private glances were shared. Beside him, Pansy and Blaise twitched with contained excitement. Draco kept his head down, his anxiety was quickly snowballing into full blown panic. Live with Gryffindor’s? Was McGonagall crazy? He wouldn’t live out the year.
Draco had never realised that watching someone eat a French pudding could be a kink he had, before now.
“Sleep,” he commanded, pointing at Draco to emphasise his point, but the expression behind his eyes told Draco that he wasn’t going to give it up that easily.
He leaned down against the bar, content to wait for Madam Rosmerta. The pub was crowded and loud. He was enjoying the atmosphere, and being out of school for an evening. Having a night out with friends was something he didn’t think he would get to have after the war.
“I should have sent you a message. Did I mention I was sorry? I had a... family emergency?” he didn’t sound sure.
As she fussed with her bag, he glanced up and saw Padma watching her from across the common room, an unbearably soft look on her face. He gave a small wave, and she flushed. He didn’t want to get up any hopes that she would be able to sort her family problems out over the holidays, but he wished for a Christmas miracle anyway. For Pansy’s sake.
“You poor old thing. Do you want us to take you up to the hospital wing? I had a cousin who was having dizzy spells and it turned out he had a parasite in his brain that he picked up in South America. Mother forbade me from ever visiting a third world after that.”
She gave him a little wave, and moved over to sit with Weasley. He immediately engaged her in intense conversation, gesticulating wildly with his sandwich while she calmly sipped pumpkin juice. Draco could guess what he was worked up about.
Draco agreed, and left before he got any more wound up. He didn’t want to analyse why it made him feel better to have a plan to make a plan. He preferred structure, but he did wish he could be more laissez-faire about life.
He looked up at her quickly, surprised by the offer. He had a particular interest in medical potions.
“And how did this little get together come about?” She waved a finger to indicate the three of them, “Don’t tell me you’ve finally learned how to make friends darling?”
He was halfway down the hall and still hadn’t spotted his name or Potter’s. His heart beat furiously as he eyed the last 2 doors. On his left was a closed door with the names “Harry Potter" and “Theodore Nott". He couldn’t believe how utterly disappointed he suddenly felt. Only a moment before his insides had been writhing with panic at the idea of sharing a room with Potter all year. Now he was faced with that not being the case, and he was dejected. His mood dropped further still when he turned to the last door and saw the names “Draco Malfoy” and “Justin Finch-Fletchley”.
“Are you SURE you don’t want to come home with me? I know it’s not much of an offer, but Blaise will probably be there all the time, to get away from his mother’s new fiancé,” she repeated for probably the fiftieth time that week.
He leaned back, his head falling over the back of the sofa, and let his eyes slip closed for a second. He was tired.
“It’s becoming increasingly obvious that isn’t the case. I’ve cut you a lot of slack so far this year. I trusted you to know what was best for you. You’ve earned the benefit of the doubt, but Harry,” she said gently, “I can’t continue to let this behaviour go unchallenged.”
He looked down, his breath hitching as he stared into Potter’s startling eyes. He’d never looked at them this closely before. His pale green irises were flecked with emerald and gold. Potter took the opportunity to lean up into him.
Draco shuddered, his hands coming up to grip Potter’s biceps. Potter pulled back with a smirk, digging his fingers into Draco’s side. It was just a small self-assured curl of his lips, like he knew he was going to get exactly what he wanted, but in that moment realisation slammed into Draco so hard that he shivered again. His mind had been blissfully blank since the second Potter touched him, but suddenly thoughts crowded into his brain, demanding his attention.
She considered him carefully, while he twitched nervously. He didn’t want to keep talking in case he started to go round and round and sound insincere.
When he was arrested after the battle of Hogwarts and placed under house arrest, he’d finally been able to process everything that had happened, and the reality of his life. He’d met with the court assigned Mind Healer Merrick three times a week over the summer, and faced a crisis of identity so huge that it had shifted his whole world view.
He stood alone in a bubble of calm, even in the crowds of the platform, and Draco wasn’t sure if the wide berth people were giving him was out of respect or something else. Potter had changed dramatically from the battle stained boy Draco had last seen. Potter looked, for want of a better word... dangerous.
“Am I OK with my aunt being disinherited because she didn’t conform to the tiny Malfoy bullshit restrictions? Of course not. I sent an owl to my lawyer last night to get Luna her trust fund set up, and he’s looking into what else Pandora should have received when my grandfather died.”
Draco stared at him. Was he asking Draco to join him for breakfast? He was smiling brightly but his eyes looks unsure, as though certain that Draco would never agree. Draco wasn’t sure what to do, he thought of Blaise and Pansy, but he didn’t think it would be a good idea to start rejecting an olive branch when it was offered. A year ago he would have viewed the offer as an insult, offended that Finch-Fletchley would think he needed assistance from the likes of him. Now he was self aware enough to realise that he really did need help. He was anxious about leaving this room without knowing that Blaise would be waiting for him, and knowing Blaise he probably wasn’t even up yet.
He shot out of the archway at the top and was halfway down the corridor before he heard the voice call out behind him, and he stopped. He turned slowly.
He slid out of bed, shivering. The winter morning was freezing, but he smiled when he looked out of the window. The sky was that impossibly clear cornflower blue, that seemed brighter than any summer day over the crystal shimmer of the white snow. The sun was low in the sky, blinding but cold. The snow covered trees in the forest were barely moving, the morning was so still and fresh.
Pansy and Blaise were both watching Potter like they had front row seats to the most fascinating play in town. Draco was staring at his coffee like it would tell him the secrets of success. He really didn’t know what to think about the exchange.
He wanted Potter fiercely. He wanted to know him, know all the dark corners of him. He wanted to be with him.
“You two faggots shouldnae be allowed in a school full a innocent wee bairns. It’s disgusting. You following the example of that ol’ poof Dumbledore Potter? I bet he was diddling you when you were wee.”
“Because according to my parents, I’m technically engaged, and until I clear that up, I don’t want to drag Pansy into my family drama,” Padma hissed, before clapping a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide and scared.
“Come along then chaps. We’d best get a move on now we all have to live in a tower like blasted owls.”
The loud blast knocked the air out of his lungs. Time seemed to slow as he felt himself skid backwards and over the top of the stairs. He wrapped his arms around his head to protect himself as he slammed down the stone staircase, rolling, and finally crashing into the wall at the bottom. He was sprawled out on the floor, panting and aching, waiting for the following footsteps to see if it was going to carry on. It was quiet. He dragged his head up and saw the upstairs landing was deserted. His chest was burning from the impact of the spell. It hadn’t been very strong. Used by a more powerful magical caster that spell could be deadly, but he hardly felt lucky at the moment. He felt dizzy. A little spaced out.
“I will be acting as your Head of House and will be directly accountable for your behaviour, so please bear that in mind. The staff and I will of course be helping you to get through your NEWTs, but we’d also like you to pursue your own areas of independent study, with opportunities for one on one tutoring with staff if we can help you with any particular topic. You are free to come and go from the castle as you please. Your conduct will have no bearing on house points, and I won’t be handing out detentions.
He was still trying to figure out why ten minutes later when Hermione arrived. She grinned at him as she settled into the chair Potter had just sat in. She was looking at him expectantly.
“Harry fuckin’ Potter,” the man boomed in a heavy Scottish accent, swaying slightly. The people nearest them froze. Potter stiffened.
Outside of their Arithmancy class he had a brief, silent squabble with Padma, before firmly seating himself next to Hermione. She froze in the process of taking a quill from her bag. He watched her coolly. Her frizzy curls were loose and full around her face today, but not one brown curl even twitched until Draco started to calmly remove his own things from his bag. She huffed out a little sigh and pulled out her completed homework. He didn’t know if she’d expected him to start yelling, but he ignored her until Professor Vector was finished outlining their winter project for the holidays.
As if on cue, the waiter bought over the espresso Draco had ordered earlier, and put Potter’s dessert down in front of him.
Maybe Potter had gone on an end of term bender, and choked on his own vomit in his sleep. Surely Theo wouldn’t have just left this morning if that were the case.
Weasley was pretending that he wasn’t ignoring Potter by talking to Longbottom, who looked very much like he’d rather be watching the drinking game. Granger had set up court on the sofas with Padma Patil and Lisa Turpin, talking animatedly with the Ravenclaw girls. Boot and Goldstein were raiding the snack table.
“Some of them,” she said, waving a hand. “It will be fine I think. There were a lot of expectations after the war, and life just doesn’t wrap up that neatly you know. They just need some time.”
From there his thoughts descended into darkness. He curled himself up tight and watched the flickering flames in the grate, his mind swirling though a sea of hopelessness.
When they were all gone, and Blaise was sucking obnoxiously at the ice in the bottom of his glass, he looked pointedly at Draco. He sighed and got to his feet, making his way across the pub alone.
“You both clearly fancy the pants off each other, and you’re both single, how is that not simple?” he asked incredulously.
He tried to keep his tone neutral, and MacMillan looked him up and down, his frown deepening. He gave a little scoff, but then he shrugged.
Draco was keeping his voice in the careful, polite tone that he had been taught growing up. Potter frowned and shot quick darting glances towards him, and away. Draco looked away from him and around the pub. For the first time since they had arrived, he could feel the eyes of strangers upon him. More specifically, on him and Potter.
“Thanks,” he coughed, grey vapour pouring into the freezing air as though he were still smoking, “For healing my arms I mean.”
He couldn’t though. He had plans with Potter after all. The brand on his arm stopped him too. He didn’t deserve the kindness of Justin’s family after everything he had been a part of. If his side had won the war, Justin’s life would have been ruined forever. He couldn’t bare to look his parents in the eyes knowing that.
