Draco sighs heavily and tucks his chin in a curt nod. He lifts his wand to his temple, withdrawing the silvery thread of memory with a wince. The memory slips into vial soundlessly. Blaise tilts his head in silent thanks, and tucks the vial away into his robes. Draco looks a little winded, even if it was a minor spell, but it’s been a long day and he’s been out of the hospital for less than twenty-four hours.
And then he finally sees it - the thread woven through the tapestry - the pattern in the chaos. It is so well hidden, so artfully tucked away, that it is a wonder that Harry found it at all. But, then again, Harry saw things that nobody ever knew to look for.
The wedding is a mess, but in the best way. It rains
Malfoy punctuates his declaration by shoving the spoonful of whipped cream and marshmallows into his mouth. A tiny bit of whipped cream clings to the corner of his mouth, and it stays there for a while until Malfoy takes another spoonful, and wipes at his mouth with a napkin.
‘I was wondering if you’d be able to answer a few questions,’ Harry says. He pulls his Unspeakable paperwork out of his pocket and un-shrinks it before handing it over to Angel Lopez.
Malfoy’s smile is a vicious, delightful thing. ‘That it does.’
‘May we all find husbands as lovely as you, Longbottom,’ Draco says. His hand is warm in Harry’s, his thumb drawing a careful half-circle over the bumps of Harry’s veins. ‘Please do tell me how Miss Agatha Burns fares in future. I find myself quite emotionally invested in her grindylow adventures.’
Blaise shakes his head. ‘Alright, fine, I won’t ask,’ he says. ‘Are you insinuating that Lucius et al couldn’t have constructed a time turner capable of going back the span of decades?’
Narcissa lets out a shrieking scream that shakes the very walls of her apartment.
timing.’ He drags his hands through his hair, inhaling deeply through his nose. ‘Right, fuck it, let’s go save Seamus.’
‘Sixty points to Slytherin says otherwise,’ Neville teases.
You. Not
It doesn’t make sense - they’ve only been properly together for just over a month. But,
Harry prays that this time, it truly is.
Blaise doesn’t come back for the rest of the night. They have no idea where he’s gone until Draco returns from the restroom with a look of horrified disgust, from which Pansy deducts - correctly - that Blaise is fucking said twink-bartender in a bathroom stall. Loudly.
‘Alright,’ says Draco, and he waits patiently.
‘That’s a no,’ Pansy says, tapping the list with her wand. ‘Have you eaten more than one meal in the past three days?’
Astoria nods, patting her husband’s arm. ‘Do what you have to. Are you going to call your uncle?’ she asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Myself included,’ Marsters nods. ‘We were responsible for tracking down the ministry officials who were working for Voldemort during the war. Since we’d already worked Lucius’s case, Kingsley assigned us to investigate the people he had dealings with. Lucius had his claws in many, many important people.’
‘Edward,’ Harry frowns.
Draco climbs back up the stairs and continues sliding books into place. ‘I told you you weren’t going to like Murakami,’ he says, glancing down over his shoulder.
Harry gestures at the open space beside him in reply.
Stephen bares his teeth in a viper’s smile. ‘Auror Smythe,’ he says, cordial as ever. ‘I suggest you comply with my wife’s request now.’
Harry tears his gaze away from the befuddling scene unfolding before him and reaches out to grasp Draco’s wrist. ‘What’s happening?’ he asks.
that?’ Harry asks. He transfers one of the drinks back to his right hand, relishing the sensation of the cool glass against his burnt fingertips.
Harry glances at Draco, who nods once.
terrible?’
‘Mr. Malfoy,’ she greets, pushing her spectacles back up from where they’ve slid to the tip of her nose. She smiles as she takes in Teddy’s appearance beside Harry. ‘Oh, how lovely. Is this your family?’
Neville chuckles low in his chest. ‘I’ll have that in writing, please.’
‘Remus was kind to me,’ Harry continues. His eyes feel hot and his body feels heavy. ‘Remus gave me chocolate when I felt down. He… he listened to me. He gave me somewhere safe to go to. He was so good, Draco, you’ll never understand - he made me feel like I still had family in this world, even when I didn’t know that he was friends with my parents.’
‘Yes, well.’ Malfoy sighs heavily. ‘I’m not exactly welcome in most wizarding establishments. And they do a good chai latte here.’
‘I sincerely hope not,’ Draco says into Harry’s collar. ‘I danced with Longbottom’s grandmother. It was a waltz. I was very sloppy. Mother would have been appalled. Potter, you won’t tell her, will you?’
‘Why wouldn’t he know what to say to me?’ Harry asks her.
‘Two weeks?’ Harry repeats. He’s losing his mind. He has to be. Or else he inhaled a hallucinogenic spore in Neville’s greenhouse and is now having a very bad trip.
take a look at this?’
‘He’s actually much better than he used to be,’ Harry tells Andromeda. He picks up Malfoy’s cup carefully and taps his wand against the porcelain rim. He waits until the spell takes, feeling the minute vibrations spread throughout the small cup, before handing it back to Malfoy.
Sometimes he wishes that this was real. Sometimes he even believes that it is real, especially when they sit around a table at a restaurant and the waitress tells Teddy that he’s lucky to have such handsome fathers, and when he looks up at Draco, he’s smiling back at Harry with such
Malfoy’s smile is a vicious, delightful thing. ‘That it does.’
He wants to weep, but he already shed all his tears on the glossy ballroom floor. His mouth is bitter from the ruin left after the Aurors left. He wants to scream himself hoarse, but Teddy is sleeping somewhere downstairs, and Teddy’s suffered enough for one night.
for a treats box?
Neville pops by later that afternoon, to Harry’s great surprise, seeing how it’s a weekday and the middle of the summer term.
What a long-ass chapter, oh my god. Between the length of this thing and work/life growing steadily more chaotic, I barely have enough time to sit down and write anything. Bear with me pls thank you ily.
Harry’s not exactly sure how he’s managed to become friends with Pansy fucking Parkinson, but if you can insult someone like that, the way Draco likes to insult Harry, then you’re definitely friends. And Harry quite likes being friends. It sure beats the other stuff that went on in seventh year, because that seems a little too big and complicated for such a very small bar. It also beats whatever the fuck happened at Draco’s parole party.
‘No,’ she frowns at him, seeming a little offended. ‘Of course not. I’m not in the habit of torturing my patients.’
Pansy stares back at him defiantly, arching her eyebrows. She transfigures Harry’s saucer into a fork and stabs it into the chips, pushing the steaming tray over to Harry’s side of the table. She reaches into her jacket pocket and pulls out a folded-up square of lilac paper.
‘Do you think I could like, splash a bit of potion onto my front door?’ Potter asks him. ‘Some kind of repellent for raving fans?’
He knows every last awful thing Lucius did to Draco during the war. He knows what Lucius did before the war, too, the subtler methods of breaking a child apart, ways that are easy to hide if you have enough money and power. Harry’s seen the other scars on Draco’s body, and it makes him so angry sometimes he thinks there isn’t enough space in his body for that kind of rage. He’s listened as Draco listed all the things his father has called him. Draco's voice was so quiet as he recited them, his eyes glassy, and Harry yearned to reach through time to gather that small, frightened child up in his arms and promise him,
‘You’re that sensitive to magic?’ Pansy asks.
‘At what?’ Harry asks, snapping out of his thoughts.
The song draws to a close, and Astoria flings herself into her husband’s arms, too excited for formalities and curtsies. She drags him by the hand towards Daphne and Luna as the quartet picks up a cheerful tune.
Draco’s hand closes over his, and his weight presses into Harry’s side. ‘It’s over,’ he whispers. ‘It’s finally over.’
‘I hope you’re feeling as miserable as I am, Potter,’ she announces, slamming the door closed behind her. ‘But fear not - I bring sustenance to ease your discomfort and suffering.’
Draco smooths the wrinkles on his hospital gown with the air of a man adjusting his finely tailored robes. It is devastatingly endearing. ‘Yes. Brussels.’
The tattoos took a total of five hours to complete. Harry recalls falling asleep halfway through the process and then waking up to the bizarre sensation of another person’s magical signature thrumming in his veins, skittering over his own magic like snowflakes drifting over dark water.
It’s arduous work, looking through the files. It reminds Harry of those long, dreary days on desk duty before he got assigned Prentis and was transferred back into the field. Blaise’s notes are well recorded, at least, and more thorough than anything he’s seen come across his desk during his days as an Auror. But these are Unspeakable files, so they focus more on the technical aspects - the particular spells used, the technical work, the ingredients and components that failed to stabilize. The neglected mug of tea grows cold at his elbow until he has to Vanish its contents and brew himself a new mug, only to forget its existence as the hum of work drags him under once more.
‘You can go on everything twice
Daphne seems to sense it too, her dark eyes narrowing in displeasure as she surveys him. ‘Hm.’ She digs around in the pockets of her lime-green robes and shoves a small bronze coin at him. ‘Here’s the pass for the showers. Go get cleaned up.’
‘You were part of the volunteer Healer effort during the War,’ he says -
‘Bloody hell,’ squawks Ron, and for a moment Harry thinks he’s spotted Blaise and Charlie as well, but when he turns around to face his friend, he finds Ron pointing at the opposite corner of the garden.
with how much Teddy is like Harry, from the way he’s put his chin on Draco’s shoulder, down to the way his voice trips over certain syllables and slows on others. It hurts in the most beautiful of ways to know that there is a descendant of the House of Black who is loved so well that he has become an amalgamation of so many different people - good people, people who are brave and kind and compassionate and true.
‘Hiya, Harry,’ he grins. ‘Glad you’re free. I’ve got something for you.’
Harry stares at the cigarette, the amber end glowing brilliantly in the curve of his hand. The first pull of Draco’s cigarette makes him cough a little, but the second eases off the pounding at his temples a little. He frowns at the cigarette.
- and makes a big deal of preparing afternoon tea for them. Harry manages to negotiate control of the teapot from the overly enthusiastic House Elf, and herds everyone into the living room. The sky is a little overcast, and the muggy heat belies a possible thunderstorm later in the day, but Harry’s got a strict temperature-control spell on in his living room to keep it nice and cool in the suffocating summer.
that?’
Harry turns in his seat, leaning one elbow on the kitchen table. ‘Couldn’t sleep?’ he asks.
Draco’s mother has settled down in Paris - it reminds her of happier times, apparently - but Draco prefers Brussels. The Statute is interpreted a little differently in Belgium than it is in France. It’s a small country, and many of its cities were built long before the Statute of Secrecy came into inception. Buildings are made of stones that are magical and mundane, and the Muggle laws strictly prohibit any alteration, so the wizarding world sits right on top of the Muggle world - sometimes literally.
He glances sideways at Pansy. She was already here when he arrived, standing in the corner of the kitchen making a fresh pot of tea. Pansy’s been mostly quiet throughout, and she keeps staring out the windows at the flowers growing on Narcissa’s balcony with a wistful expression that tells Harry she probably would prefer to be outside sitting in here, suffering through Narcissa’s small talk.
Draco looks at Harry like he’s a puzzle that needs solving. ‘You say the strangest fucking things,’ he remarks. ‘Someday I’ll figure out what you really mean.’
In a different world, travelling down a different path of time where the same deck of cards is stacked in a different array, he thinks he might have sought retribution instead of redemption.
‘Ooh, fancy,’ Neville whistles, admiring Harry’s wandwork. ‘You took a shortcut there somewhere. Should I expect Aurors showing up and poking at my plants again?’
The scar runs from Draco’s collarbone down to his hip. Harry reaches out and splays his fingers over Draco’s heart, relishing the feel of its steady, strong beat. The curse missed it by an inch. Lucius did not mean for Draco to survive.
Neville drags a chair over to sit beside Harry and stretches his legs out in front of him, crossing them lightly at the ankles. Harry sometimes wonders who’s taller, Neville or Ron. Neville’s a stealthy one - you don’t know how tall he is until he’s looming over you. Or maybe Harry’s just not very tall.
This place is bursting from the seams with the amount of love that Narcissa has for Draco. There are photographs of him everywhere, and a painting hangs above Narcissa’s bed of a tiny blonde baby with familiar silver eyes, holding a felt rabbit in his pudgy hands. There is a magical photograph of Draco sitting on the bedside table. He’s standing next to an enormous statue of a mussel, and every so often he tips his head back and laughs uproariously. Harry recognizes it as a photograph he took on their trip to Zeeland, back in their early twenties. He recalls telling Draco
‘Prat,’ Harry says without venom. He drops into the chair next to Malfoy and holds out his hand. ‘Let me see.’
Blaise’s work is thorough. They’ll never get to the hospital on time.
‘Isn’t the treatment working?’ Andromeda asks anxiously. ‘Should we find you a Healer instead?’
He shoves the rest of the chocolate bar into his mouth and crumples the wrapper in his fist.
The rain grows torrential, so they abandon dinner plans, opting instead for takeout at Draco’s tiny, rundown flat. Potter’s sweater is absolutely soaked through from their mad dash in the rain, so he peels it off with great effort and drapes it over Draco’s radiator to dry. There is a flash of skin and lean muscle.
‘You can’t do this,’ says Hermione, the warrant still clutched in her hand, her knuckles bone-white. ‘
Draco bites down on his lip to keep from bursting into peals of laughter. The bartender gives him a confused look as he sets down Harry’s drink at his elbow and takes away the empty glass. It’s a mild reaction, compared to what they’ve gotten in the Leaky Cauldron. Harry and Draco have a habit of going to Muggle establishments these days, just to avoid the crowds and flashing cameras. Harry’s still a good sport about the whole Chosen-One, star Auror fame, but it can get a bit grating when people keep demanding to know why he’s hanging around with
Angel frowns at the scribbled figures on the paper while his brother peers over his shoulder at Harry’s near illegible writing. ‘There’s only one thing that matches this figure in our catalogue,’ he says, glancing up at Harry. ‘That would be the Lopez Panic Room.’
‘You,’ Draco says, narrowing his eyes at Proudfoot. His eyes -
Draco laughs softly, and sighs. ‘It’s fine, Harry,’ he says. His fingers draw mindless patterns over Harry’s skin. ‘My Healer said I was fully recovered. You won’t hurt me.
‘I’ll take you off the groomsmen list,’ Harry frowns, pointing a threatening finger at Neville's face, ‘see if I don’t.’
you aren’t that oblivious,’ says Stephen. His smile spreads until his cheeks dimple. ‘Ah. I see. You are. Well then,’ he says, slipping his hands into his trouser pockets. ‘Let me try and frame this in a way that your barbaric little colonizer mind will understand. You’ve already managed to piss off one of the most powerful British families, along with a truly impressive collection of war heroes - do you really want to make an enemy out of the Hong Kong Lius as well?’
Harry presses his thumb and forefinger on Malfoy’s pulse, and then begins waving his wand in the first of many complex motions. Colours dance over the other man’s body in ribbons of light. Vivid green curls around his wrists and shoulders, and a necklace of scarlet winds around his neck. Bright crimson slashes over Malfoy’s forearm, where the ugly bruise of the Dark Mark sits beneath his sweater.
him, and it doesn’t make any sense, doesn’t she know what he’s done?). ‘And that’s not right, Draco. You have to prove that you
‘Potter!’ Pansy shouts.
It feels strange to be tracing these steps again, to fall into this familiar dance, but life is cyclical that way, isn’t it?
‘Because you nearly killed someone, and I could easily hand you over,’ Harry snaps. He can feel the anger bubbling in his gut again, threatening to spill over.
Draco spends the next few days learning about multiple sclerosis. In the wizarding world, non-magical diseases are not given the chance to harm their hosts the way they do in the Muggle world - and Draco wonders why the Statute of Secrecy exists when they could be curing Muggles of their afflictions, easing pain and suffering.
‘Draco, I’m unstable,’ Harry says, growing exasperated. ‘I have PTSD. I shouldn’t be a teacher.
Harry doesn’t know that he’s breathing kind of funny until Malfoy hands him the cigarette by the filter.
Harry, as always, is underdressed. He’s wearing an old Weird Sisters t-shirt, a pair of jeans that he might have worn while fixing up Grimmauld Place, and his dragonhide boots (Ginny and Hermione conspired to throw away his favourite trainers and now he has nothing except wizarding shoes).
Harry growls in affirmation, lifting his head off Draco’s shoulder. He swivels around and leans back against the sink, folding his arms over his chest. Draco lowers his chin slightly and watches him through his long, pale lashes, a fond smile curving his lips upwards. Harry wants to kiss him. Harry always wants to kiss him, though, so he pushes through the urge with practiced ease.
That, while disappointing, is hardly unexpected. The Lopezes would never be able to retain clients if they went around handing backdoors and skeleton keys to every Auror and Unspeakable who came knocking at their door.
He wakes up one Sunday morning and he cannot get out of bed.
Another member of the Wizengamot rises out of his seat, slamming his hand down on the railing. ‘We cannot consider justice a crime,’ he thunders. ‘Draco Malfoy deserves what was done to him.’
The dishes wash themselves in the sink, piled high from the elaborate dinner Teddy insisted on cooking for them. Apparently, he felt guilty for not being around for ‘Aunt Pansy’s epic meltdown’ and wanted to make it up to Harry and Draco. Harry’s not sure who Teddy inherited his impulsive desire to cook from, but it probably has something to do with him being sorted into Hufflepuff and living so close to the kitchens.
‘It’s fine now,’ Harry assures Teddy. ‘And it was very lovely of you to come. Even if you’re supposed to be in Romania,’ he adds, a little sternly. ‘You worked very hard to get on that course - you don’t want to delay receiving your qualification.’
They honeymoon in Nimes. They eat honey-soaked cheese on the balcony of their hotel room and drink pastis in the late afternoon as the dry heat of the day is at its most brutal point. They go to vineyards and markets and hike through ancient olive gardens and follow the lines of old aqueducts from town to town. Harry learns to kayak, and Draco gets horribly sunburnt and Harry rubs soothing salve onto his reddened shoulders in the safety of their room.
further grindylow adventures,’ Harry tells Neville, glaring daggers at him.
‘Oh, that’s very kind of you,’ Charlie says, his eyes flashing up to Blaise’s face. He raises his eyebrows. ‘I don’t think we’ve met before.’
‘Easy there, Uncle Draco,’ Teddy says. He drops his duffle bag onto the floor with an audible thump and walks over to Draco’s side of the hospital bed, placing the flowers down at the foot of the bed. As he bends down to give Draco a hug, his hair shifts from its deep auburn to the same shocking shade of blond as his uncle’s. ‘I’m glad you’re alright.’
Malfoy gives him a scathing look. ‘Oh, sure, Potter,’ he says, voice dripping with sarcasm. ‘I’ll just stroll up to the Dark Lord, shall I? Tell him I’m not interested in his little side-quest anymore, thanks ever so much.’ He shakes his head. ‘You really have less brains than a flobberworm, Potter.’
‘You can’t be saying what I think you’re saying,’ Proudfoot growls. He stands up in a flurry of movement, the legs of the chair skittering back against the bare floorboards. ‘Robards wouldn’t do something like this.’
- all courtesy of Molly’s powerhouse presence in the kitchen.
Harry watches Lucius’s face as shock and fear morphs into wild, desperate rage. He sees it before it happens,
They were engaged by Christmas and sent wedding invitations in the Spring.
‘I can’t believe you made me wait nearly half an hour, Potter,’ Malfoy grumbles. He’s sitting with his knees pressed up against his chest, his fingers interlaced as he hugs his legs close. A fit of trembling makes him shudder, his face creasing with the force of it.
Draco’s hand is a vice on Harry’s arm. ‘These claims are outrageous,’ he states, his voice shaking with barely-contained anger. ‘Plenty of Aurors have done far worse in duels, and I don’t see you arresting them for it.’
‘Why not?’ argues Potter. ‘Surely it’s worth a try.’
He holds the warrant up for inspection. ‘We need to speak with Mr. Potter,’ the young Auror announces. His voice is deafening in the terse silence, and even Singh winces.
Harry lets Smythe get about three steps past him, before he wiggles his fingers, wandlessly tying Smythe’s shoelaces. The Auror goes down like a sack of bricks.
. Luna thinks things are better in the open, but she doesn’t know what it’s like to be desperate enough to butcher your heart to keep a friendship alive.
Harry clutches the hawthorn wand in his hand. ‘Come with us,’ he says one last time.
Harry freezes, a deer in the headlights, and realises that he has no idea what she said to him.
Small men with big words fear that kind of power - or worse, they covet it. And Draco knows the lengths that men like that would go, in the face of such power.
‘Course you do,’ Prentis grins wolfishly. ‘Give my love to the boy.’
He modified his Anchors this morning before he left the hotel. If he has a moment to focus -
Crabbe had his own family whispering poison into his ear, his own twisted understanding of the world, his own desires that drove him down that awful, terrible path. And at the end of the day, they were all children made into cannon fodder by the people who should have kept them safe.
Harry eyes her suspiciously. Pansy expresses her affection in many forms, mostly through the forced consumption of strong liquor, but she doesn’t do house visits and she doesn’t
Draco closes his eyes and tries to find a way to breathe. His exhausted mind stutters through memories like a television with bad signal flickering between channels.
‘If you require any assistance, please do let Antimony know,’ Acquafredda says, indicating the snake. ‘He will come fetch me.’
‘I’m trying to reverse-engineer a magical panic room that Draco had installed in Narcissa’s apartment,’ Harry says, the words spilling out him in a rush, ‘because I’m almost certain that Lucius is holding Draco hostage in that panic room and is probably torturing him in an attempt to force him to fix a Time Turner capable of going back years, decades in time to make sure that Riddle won the war. So yeah. Busy.’
But Malfoy’s right here - lovely Malfoy who writes lovely letters - and Harry feels like he’s been chasing the shape of Malfoy for years, tracing the imprint that he leaves in Harry’s life, as though that will somehow explain how he feels every time he reads that letter. He doesn’t want to just pay and leave and then never see Malfoy again.
‘It’s okay,’ he lies. ‘It’s going to be okay.’ And then, with all the truth in his heart: ‘I love you. I always will. I always have.’
‘S’ unpleasant,’ Teddy confirms. He props his chin on Draco’s shoulder and peers down at the letter. ‘You shouldn’t be up so late, Uncle Draco. Sleep’s important.’
Somewhere in the endless days of being trapped at the end of Lucius’s wand, his mother had latched onto Harry (or perhaps the idea of him being, once again, symbolic of their deliverance) and used him as a barometer for how fucked up the world was. She is, unsurprisingly, not taking the news of Harry’s arrest well.
Blaise’s expression grows grim and he scribbles something down in the margins of his notebook. He scans it for a moment, a muscle ticking away in his jaw as he does. Harry feels a strange sense of deja vu. He’s been on that side of the interrogation so many times, and asked a similar set of questions with the same polite detachment.
,’ he whistles. He hands the parchment over to his brother for inspection. ‘Never thought we’d meet you in person, Professor.’
Harry remembers the rain coming down in icy sheets, of rain-darkened hair flattened against Draco’s pale skin, the small indentation next to his mouth that appears only when he smirks, the translucent-starshine colour of his eye, the gasp of warmth of Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrist as they run for cover. And then he remembers sitting beside the fireplace in the Cornwall house, Draco’s weight as much an anchor as the ink and magic branded into Harry’s skin, the murmured words, the taste of merlot, the smell of lavender, and the slow ember of Harry’s desire glowing within his rib-cage, just adjacent to his heart.
But then he thinks of Malfoy’s hands shaking as he presses his own wand to his neck. Malfoy’s lopsided smile in the flat light of Costa’s, Malfoy laughing, pink-cheeked in the snow, Malfoy stacking books, hair curling from the heat of the tiny store. And then he thinks of Malfoy smiling gently down at Teddy, slumbering with his head buried in Malfoy’s shirt.
‘Diagnostic spell,’ Daphne explains. ‘Luna, love, do you mind holding this for a moment?’ She hands Luna her champagne flute and pushes up the narrow sleeves of her robes to her elbows. Her forearms are covered in tattoos - dark, intertwined runes shifting alongside each other over her pale skin. ‘I use these to read someone’s magical signature based on touch by passing a tiny amount of my magic into the other person and reading the vibrations, similar to how a wand measures its compatibility with a young witch or wizard.’
at his idea of branching out the business and making magical liquor.
Harry accepts this with a nod. ‘I wish I could make this all go away,’ he sighs. ‘Or at least make it better somehow.’
Draco’s skin is growing cold, but he looks at Harry with such tender warmth, such beautiful,
Theo drops a handful of galleons into Pansy’s gleeful paw and wanders off muttering about a drink.
‘You’ve submitted nothing to us on the topic,’ Blaise comments, his eyes narrowing slightly.
Something about those words feels like a slap in Harry’s face.
Proudfoot’s eyes dart between the contents of the volume, Draco’s hard expression, and Kingsley’s exhausted slump in his chair. His grip on the ledger tightens, the leather binding of the book squeaking in protest. Blaise paces back and forth behind Draco, a restless tiger in the corner of a cage.
Malfoy arches an eyebrow, managing to come off cool and aristocratic despite resembling a very well-dressed Inferi. ‘Yes, quite.’ He turns towards Hermione. ‘Granger,’ he says stiffly. ‘Would you mind if we had a word? In private,’ he adds, ‘if you’re amenable.’
’ He flicks his wand at the salad and the bowl floats gently back along the table.
‘I look like him,’ Draco says. He drops his hand and clenches it above his sternum.
Harry steps away from the window and sits, cross-legged, at the centre of his cell. The air is damp and cold, and everything smells like salt and mildew. The stones beneath him are hard and unforgiving, and there is a stain upon this island from the now-removed colony of Dementors. The chill threatens to sink into Harry’s bones, but he pushes it away with the furnace of his magical core.
She tosses a hand skyward. ‘Honestly? I don’t know. It was so fucking unsettling.’ She peers into her empty glass and frowns. ‘I’m going to make some more. D’you want any?’
His father is locked away in prison. A horrible, angry part of him wishes his father had died in the Battle of Hogwarts. But his father was never very good at fighting someone who could face him as his equal. He lives because he hid.
Except -
Draco smothers his laughter by taking another sip of his martini. ‘Oh, but isn’t that your speciality?’ he grins, and Harry doesn’t need to be Legilimens to know what scenes are flashing through his mind. ‘Broken toes?’
‘What in the world is going on?’ shouts Astoria’s voice from far away.
It’s been hours of work, and no matter what combination the three of them try, they still can’t recreate the Lopez Panic Room. If it weren’t for Draco, Harry would probably congratulate the Lopez brothers on creating a near uncrackable puzzle.
He is quicksilver. He is the gasping white froth that rides the dark ocean waves as they roll into shore, and as certain as the currents that run deep beneath the surface.
‘Merlin, Potter,’ Pansy says. ‘You’re in love with him. You’re in love with Draco.’
‘I’m not exactly going anywhere, Harry,’ Draco says, tilting his head meaningfully towards the glimmer of monitoring spells still hovering above, the medical chart clipped onto the foot of the bed. ‘Take your time.’
‘Have you reached out for backup or support?’ Pansy asks, tapping the list twice more with her wand.
Harry arches his eyebrows as he lets Neville’s words digest. ‘That was actually quite solid advice,’ he remarks. ‘I’m very proud of you.’
He finds it almost instantly. It’s in the same place, hidden in the walls behind the settee. It feels weaker than before. Bile rises in Harry’s mouth, but he bites down any kind of reaction.
shouldn’t condone that sort of thing. At least not in public.
Harry stares at them, wondering why he’s suddenly reminded of the Weasley Twins (which picks at old scars he’d rather leave alone), or why he feels like he’s back in the workroom in the Department of Mysteries, stuck with a bunch of swots who want to spend a perfectly good summer arguing the mechanics of time versus death.
But Harry’s never been very good at maintaining levity, so he pulls away and breaks into a grin. ‘Hey, hey Draco,’ he says. ‘Be my boyfriend. Go on a date with me, won’t you?’
‘Thanks Gin,’ Harry says, smiling at her. ‘I will.’ He lifts the phone up and tilts the glowing screen in her direction.
Harry clenches his jaw. He pulls out of Draco’s reach and steps back into the light, back into the chaos of the ballroom.
‘Have you tried the chocolate?’ he asks Malfoy lightly.
Harry spots Draco’s assistant, Michelle, sitting behind the counter at the back of the shop. She looks up from her work, her eyes widening as she sees Harry approach.
Draco lifts his hand from Harry’s waist and presses it against his chest, fingers splayed out. ‘Harry,’ he whispers, his eyes widening. ‘Your heart - it’s
Harry sits up and grins giddily. ‘Hi,’ he says, instead of,
‘He doesn’t deserve this,’ Hermione says, misery a lead-weight on her body. ‘He - Draco, he’s suffered so much. We all thought - with
It really is a lovely letter. Every sentence is poetry, every statement is heartrendingly genuine. Malfoy asks after Teddy, offers a few methods to deal with Teddy’s colic, and encloses a recipe for a potion to alleviate Andromeda’s arthritis.
,’ he says, exasperated. ‘We’re not - your uncle and I weren’t-’
You know how some chapters are harder to write than pulling teeth? Yeah. That.
Draco hums softly and brushes his knuckles over Harry’s cheekbone. ‘Shall I ask it again?’ he murmurs.
Harry rolls his eyes and suppresses the urge to shove his boyfriend into the muddy water. ‘May I continue?’ he huffs. ‘Please?’
‘You deserve more than this,’ Daphne says. ‘You always have.’
Sometimes he feels like that part of him is a completely different person - a stranger standing on the opposite platform, waiting for a train to pick them up and hurtle them a hundred miles away. Other times (like now) it feels like he’ll never escape that wizard with curse-stains on his hands.
Ginny whacks him with the bristly end of her broom, which, in Harry’s opinion, is a damn waste of perfectly good equipment. But, well. When you’re sponsored by the top broom-makers in the continent, you could probably spare to waste one or two expensive brooms on pummelling your ex-boyfriend on your back porch.
He doesn’t really agree with Daphne. He doesn’t deserve more than this. He wants to end in the ashes of the Manor. He wants to let himself be swept away and locked in a cell and forgotten about.
PS. I read all your comments, they make me so very happy, I promise I’ll try to reply to them going forward.
Lucius pulls a second wand from his pocket -
Hermione’s last witness is none other than Healer Thompson.
‘To answer your other question,’ Harry says, ‘apparently Draco’s not been turning up to work for the past week. I think he’s probably gone to De Haan to escape the heat.’
But even if he was brave enough to say the words, to admit his long-hidden love, his decade of yearning - even then he does not know how to encapsulate the great universal workings that bind the two of them together, stronger than any deep magic that Harry has ever known.
‘These curses were designed to hurt,’ Healer Thompson says, her face grim. ‘They can keep a person alive while inflicting the worst kind of torture upon them. I have not seen these sorts of injuries since the War, and I have certainly never seen them inflicted by someone on their own son. In my professional opinion, that requires a certain level of barbarity that I have rarely witnessed in my long years of working on this ward.’
Draco laughs softly, tipping his head back towards the multitude of stars spread out above them. His neck is very long and very pale, and Harry can count the tiny beauty marks that dot between his clavicle and his jawline. ‘My apologies,’ he says, sounding completely unrepentant.
Harry grins lopsidedly. ‘Actual investigative work.’
, she says, but it is.
He’s running out of time. If he’s right -
‘Sorry I was a cunt,’ Pansy says, with no small amount of aggression. ‘The list of cunty activities is a bit long, and that vodka is hitting me like a fucking Erumpent, so let’s just pretend I said it all. Oh, and sorry for trying to turn you over to Snake-Face. That’s probably the cuntiest of my teenage decisions.’
gave me chocolate when I was feeling down,’ he reminds Harry. ‘And we weren’t even friends back then. Hell, I’d say we were on the verge of killing each other. But you were still kind to me. You
‘It will be extremely hard to bring those charges,’ Blaise warns her. ‘The Wizengamot cares more about the nature of spells cast than what happens at the receiving end - look at our laws, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. They do not prioritize what is easily fixed with magic.’
Draco sets down his book and peers at Harry over the tops of his glasses. ‘Yes, Harry?’
Draco’s grip is vice-like around Harry’s hand as the Healer pulls out her records and reads out Draco’s medical report, and then describes the emergency procedures she had to take during the long, gruelling hours of saving Draco’s life.
‘Good lad,’ Charlie chuckles.
, Michelle. Remember, it’s illegal to send Howlers to the Bureau.’
peach Bellinis.’
Draco’s eyes are wide in the dark. The moon is bright but there are shadows everywhere and Harry can’t see, can’t tell what Draco’s thinking, doesn’t know anything except the thorny garden in his chest that overflows and fills him up until he’s choking on the many-petalled bloom.
anybody else.
It would have certainly been a difficult task for eighteen-year-old Harry to learn the motions of the spell, but he’s been doing complex spellwork for nearly two decades. He memorized the lock-picking spell in the space of one evening - tracing the motions of the spell with his fork through dinner, familiarizing the muscles in his arm and chest with the precise pulses of magic that course from magical core out to his fingertips.
Ron and Hermione - they’re family, but Neville is Harry’s best friend.
They all look over in time to see Pansy downing half a bottle of vodka. She screws the lid shut, hands the bottle over to Draco, and stands up. ‘Pansy,
Except, when Harry first came to see Narcissa, she kept staring at this wall. She wouldn’t look away from it.
as he arrives, the rustling and clinking as he navigates the kitchen with familiar ease. It’s irritating how quickly he became accustomed to invading Draco’s space.
Harry bites down on his lip. ‘If I find him,’ he says, ‘I’ll tell him then.’
Harry studies Draco’s reflection carefully. He can see the faint trace of Lucius’s features there, hidden in the arch of his nose, the slight curve of his mouth, just as he can see Narcissa’s bone structure, and Andromeda’s elfin features. He supposes there are plenty of other inheritances woven into Draco’s genes, subtle reminders of his Malfoy heritage - fragments that other witches and wizards will see that will inevitably remind them of Lucius Malfoy.
‘It’s not like it’s against Auror policy,’ Harry frowns. ‘I’ve checked. They can just have George partner with a Cursebreaker. But apparently it rubs them the wrong way that George never finished at Hogwarts -
‘You feel like you haven’t slept,’ she remarks. A deep groove appears between her brows. ‘
‘Are you alright?’ Harry asks, the question taking him by surprise even as he voices it.
, Harry tells himself. His tongue is lead-studded concrete, his eyes full of coals.
. I think I’m allowed to defer for a month or two.’
. Am to expect similar carelessness in your investigation?’
Harry doesn’t really know what to say to that.
to Draco and Narcissa Malfoy.’
he mouths.
‘Professor Harry James Potter,’ says Smythe, enunciating each syllable loudly enough for the entire ballroom to hear. ‘By order of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, you are under arrest.’
Draco doesn’t quite smile - at least, not with his mouth - but his features lose some of their sharpness. He twists his hand around and encircles Harry’s wrist with his own. The gesture feels like coming home.
Blaise narrows his eyes slightly but says nothing.
A broad, unguarded smile breaks over Neville’s face. ‘Oh,
Harry’s not entirely sure
Harry loves him and hates him in equal measure. Nobody should be so unbearably annoying and charming at the same time. He sighs and gathers himself.
Hermione nods along slowly, though she seems too confused to do much else.
Charlie’s grin melts into something that Harry recognizes as his
‘For the chocolate?’ Harry asks confusedly.
He gets injured so many times at work that he has an assigned Healer and a reserved bed in the Spell Damage ward.
On a good day, Draco would probably feel exasperated with Harry’s characteristic stubbornness, but instead he just feels a wave of overwhelming emotion - a tangled, slippery thing that he cannot quite decipher. He sighs softly and tangles his hands in his lap, beneath the sheets.
And then Draco falls.
Prentis snorts. ‘I don’t. Marie gets to buy me nice mugs now because she knows you won’t blow them up. Speaking of significant others,’ she adds, closing the file and setting it aside, ‘are you off to see that nice boy of yours this weekend? You didn’t bring your weekend bag today.’
me that’s what it meant?’
lead,’ Draco continues, almost
Draco takes a step back towards the open floor of the ballroom, Harry’s hand still within his grasp. ‘Dance with me,’ he says.
Other letters come in the post: letters from parents who lost their children to Riddle’s oil-slick charm, his toxic ideologies; letters from witches and wizards who managed to escape the taloned grasp of their pureblood families; letters from children who are still captured in gilded cages; letters from famous, powerful people who envy Draco for his ability to escape the lead-heavy weight of his familial duties.
Draco’s impressed upon Harry the importance of never showing up empty-handed, so Harry picks up a bouquet of  peonies and a box of lavender macarons before Apparating directly to Narcissa’s front door. He rings the doorbell and steps back, tucking the macarons under his arm and readjusting his grip on the flowers. They still need some time before they bloom properly, but an afternoon in some water will do the trick just fine.
‘We’re conducting an investigation, see,’ Proudfoot sighs. He glances at Harry, then looks quickly away, but not before Harry recognizes the look in the grizzled old Auror’s face.
The last person he expects to see sitting on Narcissa’s settee, with her ankles neatly crossed neatly like she’s visiting royalty, is Pansy fucking Parkinson.
here in their harmony of movement and breath.
She really shouldn’t fit in Malfoy’s apartment. It’s too Muggle, too cosy and warm and a little run-down, and it smells like flowers and herbs and there’s usually a bowl of satsumas on the coffee table because Hermione’s been craving them since she got pregnant. And the way she looks tonight, she really
‘What the fuck do you think, Potter?’ Malfoy says. There is a strange blankness to his voice, one that makes Harry want to run in the opposite direction. Another tremor shudders up from his elbows, making his hands twitch, and he grimaces, baring his teeth.
Realisation slams into Harry like a punch to the gut. Narcissa’s been trying to tell him where Draco was this whole time - and Harry’s been completely oblivious to it. Harry hates himself so much he wants to rip his stomach from behind his teeth and set it on fire. He wants to tear off his skin and throw himself off Narcissa’s lovely balcony.
The witches protest, but their voices are muffled by the magical barrier now planted between them and the object of their obsession. Eventually, they give up and leave, magazines clutched in their hands like well-earned prizes.
‘Get a Healer!’ he barks at the nearest nurse. ‘
Hermione pulls over a chair and sits down next to Harry. She takes his hand in hers and squeezes it tight. ‘I do,’ she says firmly. ‘He’s stronger than you think. Much stronger than any of us could ever be.’
‘Thank Circe for Luna,’ he says. ‘Where would we all be without her?’
‘Draco and I aren’t a couple,’ he reminds Prentis. ‘We’ve had this conversation.’
A sliver of ice slides down Harry’s spine. He knows all too well what a Time-Turner can do. Harry and Hermione had managed to save Sirius and Buckbeak with a Time-Turner that only went back hours - and they were just children with barely enough time to organize or plan anything. If the neo-Death Eaters got their hands on a Time-Turner that could turn back years - they could go back and change the war, save the Horcruxes. They could make sure that Harry never died in the Forbidden Forest. That he never defeated Riddle at the Battle of Hogwarts.
But Draco looks so very sad and fragile and afraid, and Harry needs to fix this.
‘Merlin,’ Harry utters, shaking his head. He looks up at George, shaking his head slowly. ‘
(He hands the blueprints for the International Floo over to the Unspeakables and warns them that the Department of Mysteries will have precisely one year of exclusive use before he releases it to the public.)
‘My hair is not a magical plant,’ Harry retorts, handing Neville the salad. ‘And all your scissors are covered in controlled substances.’
,’ he utters. ‘McGonagall will be relieved. She’s convinced there’s still a curse on the position and you’re the only immune to it.’
(It’s a short one, I know. Hopefully the next chapter will make it up.)
Harry sips at his drink while he lets that information digest. ‘Are you happy?’ he asks.
‘Why am I suddenly Potter again?’ he asks.
‘Oh,’ comes Ron’s voice from the foyer. ‘Oh, hi. Come on in, I guess.’
Harry knows a lot about falling from pedestals.
This is the second intervention Hermione’s held. She’s brought Rosie over to Grimmauld Place as ammunition in her assault on Harry’s overwhelming guilt. It’s difficult to dodge her questions when he’s got an armful of adorable, gap-toothed toddler.
my boyfriend,’ he says emphatically.
Warnings: description of prison confinement, abuse and use of restraints. To avoid the Azkaban scene, skip ahead to ‘Take this abomination off him…’.
Coming up next: more mutual pining, and detective Potter continues his investigation, discoveries are made, and a LOT of pain.
Hermione screams again. The sound is a basilisk’s fang in Harry’s heart.
From beyond the island that separates the dining room from the kitchen, Daphne makes a soft sound of agreement.
a smarmy little prick,’ he complains.
He doesn’t tell Malfoy about the way he can’t sleep anymore, or that he sometimes loses his temper with the people that he loves, that sometimes Ginny says something careless when they’re bickering and it digs under Harry’s skin like a poisonous barb, and he has to go somewhere quiet and just wait for all that anger to boil away. He doesn’t tell Malfoy that, since he died in the Forbidden Forest, he’s not quite so afraid of death anymore and maybe that’s a bad thing, because sometimes when he’s on the hunt he feels like a weapon instead of a person but he kind of likes the emptiness of it all, except when it’s all done and he’s back in his cubicle with a stack of paperwork all he can think about is the way that a curse just tastes different to say out loud, so he spends his sleepless nights learning how to do them all wordlessly.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and are having fun with me so far. Sometimes I feel like relationships arrive at times when we aren't ready for them, and really that's what this fic is all about.
‘You have to mean it for a Cruciatus Curse to work,’ he says after a while, his voice low and quiet. ‘You have to want the victim to suffer. My father only ever tortured me when he was ordered to, but, Circe, he did it so
Draco’s lips quirk upwards. ‘Let’s not resort to violence, Harry,’ he says, his voice light with amusement. ‘I do appreciate the sentiment, though.’
‘Excuse me?’ Harry frowns. He’s unsure if he hallucinated it - the Unspeakable hasn’t uttered a word since he stepped into Harry’s classroom.
‘Oh, I do apologize,’ says Narcissa, her forehead wrinkling slightly. ‘I meant no offense.’
Draco turns to look at him, his eyes wide, and this is perhaps the first time they’ve said it aloud, this secret, silent beast that floats between them, this hidden message wrapped away in confectionary and colourful foil wrapping. He smiles, and it is a bittersweet thing of both sadness and unbearable fondness.
Harry hesitates - he looks down at his boots, sparkling clean, and remembers when they weren’t. He remembers scrubbing his hands in the hospital showers, remembers the sleepless nights staring at the monitoring spells hovering over Draco’s quiet body. He thinks about the agony of unsaid words, and how small the sting of rejection feels in comparison to that.
Draco leans back in his chair. ‘There are three more payments precisely like that one,’ he states, tapping the figures with his forefinger. ‘Fiscal year 1997. Fiscal year 1995. Fiscal year 1990.’
‘Why didn’t you tell me about your disability?’ Mr. Blake asks worriedly. ‘I was never going to fire you for something like that. You
‘It means… it means, stay alive for me,’ he says. ‘Take care of yourself when I’m not there.’
Draco lifts his hand and brushes it over his chest, feeling for the wand holster strapped there beneath his clothes. The holly wand burns against his skin, agitated at being separated from its master. Draco knows that, although its counterpart lies entombed with Dumbledore’s body, he carries that weight too. He does not know how Harry shouldered its burden for so many years - how it never warped him into something monstrous, the way it had done so many of its previous masters.
Draco drops his head onto Harry’s shoulder and sighs. ‘I do apologize for keeping you away from your students,’ he murmurs.
‘That was
‘No, no, I’ve got everyone,’ Hermione replies. She bites her lip, her gaze wandering aimlessly over the well-decorated walls of her home. She shuffles back towards the sofa and drops heavily into it. ‘It’s just - you get so cocky, you know?’ she says. ‘He’s
‘Did Draco tell you where he was going on Friday?’ Harry asks, hoping to distract the middle-aged witch from her tirade.
Harry jumps a little, and Ginny only laughs harder.
‘What on earth are you talking about, Draco?’ Harry asks, smiling bemusedly.
‘You haven’t responded to any of our letters,’ Ron says, relentless in his tirade, ‘haven’t been answering any of our calls - I had to resort to talking to Pansy. Daphne and Luna were supposed to go on honeymoon, I’ll have you know, but instead Daphne’s here trying to keep you from-’ he breaks off, blinking at the papers scattered across the bed and table, and then up at the glowing structure floating in the middle of the room.
, he thinks darkly.
‘Because it doesn’t feel right,’ Harry grunts in frustration. He doesn’t know how to explain it to Ron - it’s like trying to describe the spectrum of colours in a rainbow to a blind person.
‘The light is very good for entertaining guests,’ Narcissa says, gesturing around her living room like an empress indicating her domain. ‘I am so glad you’ve come.’
Harry traverses the city to Draco’s potions shop, moving purely based on muscle memory. Cosmic Remedy is a quaint little place in the wizarding quarter, with enormous, art-nouveau display windows framed in creamy-white panels. Draco’s trademark green bottles line the windows, a bouquet of magical and non-magical plants and flowers placed in each bottle. Posters illustrated in full colour back the display, advertising hair-loss remedies and cures for chronic aches and pains and caffeine-free wakefulness. A life-size mannequin holds up a bottle overflowing with white roses and honeysuckle to its blank, featureless face, as pink peonies explode out of the mannequin’s dress.
. Harry remembers him at the funeral, ruddy-faced and red-eyed, standing at the edges of the gathered crowd with flowers bunched in his fist as he stared helplessly at Andromeda, holding Teddy in her arms. Harry remembers how Andromeda looked then, too, standing quietly beside her sobbing husband, full of so much rage and grief that it seemed like her slender bones had no space for it.
‘Circe,’ Draco snaps, his eyes flashing with frustration. ‘What unattainable standard of martyrdom are you holding yourself to?’
When Ron and Hermione come to visit, he tells them that he’s quitting the Aurors.
He doesn’t look like the sneering boy who broke Harry’s nose on the train. He looks like a spectre, or a reflection caught on a frosted window - all pale and warped out of shape.
Harry gestures at the room with a wide sweep of his arm. ‘Please.’
‘Harry? You alright?’
is if I wanted to be.’
‘Would you like to come sleep in my room?’ he offers. ‘Would it help?’
His lips taste like champagne and after-dinner chocolates.
‘Might have to do a bit of running between the two,’ Teddy replies, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms over his chest.
The only time Draco gets serious about it is when they’re in Andromeda’s garden, watching Teddy fly on his first practice broom on a hot summer’s afternoon. Harry runs feverishly warm these days, his magic thundering in his veins. At some point the heat gets too much for him and he peels his shirt off his sweat-soaked back. It’s only when he notices Draco staring at him that he remembers - he’s got so many scars these days that his dark skin is latticed with silver and pink lines.
Harry groans. ‘Why did I say that?
Hugo nods his solemn confirmation and hands Draco the potatoes.
Harry wonders if perhaps it is the change in a person that makes one seek places of light and warmth, or if it is the warmth and light of a place that might change a person. He thinks about Draco, that first night at Costa’s, and his heart twists savagely in his chest.
Draco makes a strangled noise at the back of his throat. ‘Circe, give me a moment to
Blaise watches his friend take each tiny bottle with a tight, anxious expression, which is
‘Uh, my schedule-’ Harry starts, but is cut off with another curt wave of Daphne’s hand.
Neville doesn’t move his hand. His touch feels too-sharp, like splinters sticking into his skin.
He sighs, sets down the letter, gets to his feet, and walks over to Pansy. He pulls her into a tight hug. She’s smaller than she looks, more delicate too, so she hides it with her flashy clothes and her ridiculous heels. She’s always been the sort of person to cover up her fear and love and worry with a mask of frivolity and petty cruelty.
Draco presses something into Harry’s hand - something small and velvety. Harry’s heart is a frantic metronome in his throat, completely out of sync from the waltz as it rises to the climax of the song. He looks down and finds the box cupped in his palm, and Draco’s long fingers cradling his hand like something precious.
‘I don’t know,’ Harry sighs. ‘It’s just so weird.’ He shivers a little bit and wonders why he didn’t think to bring a coat or something.
‘Don’t let her fool you, Harry,’ Draco sighs. He links his arm through Harry’s elbow and leans over to tap his wand on the rim of the goldfish bowl, returning it back to its original form. ‘Just be grateful she uses her Slytherin powers for good.’
But Potter is a storm breaking in the sky above him, the mud and rock and silt sliding from the mountain and rolling into the river, and he can’t help but let himself be swept away.
He shakes his head. ‘I came to see how you were doing.’ He glances through the open archway towards the empty dining room. ‘Where are Ron and the children?’
‘So like, I don’t count as a kid?’ Teddy interrupts, gesturing at himself. ‘Victoire just emerged from the womb as a full-grown teenager? And I suppose Rose is just a really, really small adult. Or maybe she’s a grindylow in a very good disguise. Oh, and what about Hugo?’
He tries not to look at Neville as he hurries away, but he catches sight of the look of worry and pity on Neville’s face as he flees. He can’t stand to see it - he knows how pathetic he’s become.
, Draco wants to say.
‘I’m glad you’re alive,’ Harry says, and realises it’s the truth.
‘I’ll pay for the bloody heating,’ he huffs. ‘Tell me how much it is, and I’ll transfer it. Alright?’
never finished at Hogwarts, those classist pricks. And what does any of it even matter if we can save people?’ Harry throws his hands in the air. ‘I don’t know why I became an Auror. They’re all a bunch of dusty old farts with a taste for misdirected violence.’
(His own voice, dulled with years of acceptance -
‘Yeah,’ Harry replies, picking up his mug. ‘It makes me feel like he didn’t win, you know? You and me sitting here, talking like normal people - it feels like spitting in his face somehow.’
‘For giving me something to hold onto, in- when I was in the panic room,’ Draco replies. His smile is bittersweet, but his hand is warm in Harry’s grasp, and it does not tremble even once. ‘I think I understand what you were trying to tell me, after the Diagon Incident. Everything he did, through it all, all of it - I held on for you.’
‘Yes,’ Harry says slowly. ‘Are you alright, Pansy?’ he asks. They were clearly arguing about something important before he walked in.
Harry’s had his Anchors modified to their lowest setting for three days now. Daphne is vehemently against it, but he’s desperate not to count corpses again - he’ll do anything, absolutely anything to prevent another attack, even if it means burning himself out.
‘Why are you shaking?’ Harry asks. Dread twists in his stomach like a snake uncoiling.
Draco shakes his head. ‘But then why?’ he demands.
Hermione looks up at Blaise with swollen eyes, and, once again, asks, ‘Have you heard anything?’
Draco rolls his eyes and takes the other drink out of Harry’s hand. ‘You can ask for help, you know,’ he reprimands.
Harry lifts his hand in defeat and pulls the nearest tray towards him, ignoring the curry chips in favour of what is attempting to be fried chicken.
to me. Do you understand that? You make me believe that this horrible, miserable world can get better.’
‘Hm?’
‘I need a cigarette,’ Draco declares. He wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, a movement they’ve repeated so often at this point it feels like second nature. ‘Come with me?’
‘Time magic,’ Harry says, shrugging.
‘Oh, I’ll make them care,’ Hermione says, like it’s a threat, and it probably is, because she’s an absolute terror to behold once she channels all that rage and stubbornness into her work.
Draco stares at him mutely. His knuckles are white as he clutches at the countertop.
Even as he utters the words, Harry’s gut gives an odd little twist. He didn’t receive his weekly letter and package from Draco this week, which is admittedly not out of the ordinary - but Draco
Because when Harry hobbles into the Ministry on crutches and hands in his two weeks’ notice, the anger and disgust levelled at him by the entire DMLE makes him feel as though
Draco rewards his cheek with a smack against his upper arm. Even with Draco lying flat on his back and with no leverage, his hand lands on Harry’s arm with a solid
‘That’s three times now you’ve saved my life,’ Harry tells Draco, only a little bit awestruck.
. He has other dreams too, dreams of things that seem so real that they burn like acid in his lungs when he wakes up and makes him feel even more hollow than usual - but he cannot help but linger on the echoes of these dreams, languishing in
He pockets Malfoy’s wand and kneels carefully in front of the other boy. Malfoy’s wrists are deathly thin and his hands shake with a strange, unnatural tremor. There are bruises blooming on the inside of his collar. His lips are cracked and bleeding, and each breath he takes sounds ragged.
Pansy pushes Draco’s shoulder roughly. ‘This is
He’s still beaming at his best friend when Ginny taps him on the shoulder.
to the traditions of yesteryear-’ - and Harry thinks he should feel bad for Blaise, probably, but then Draco bursts into a fit of giggles, and then Harry’s laughing too, smothering his guffaws with his hand, so they stand in the kitchen, clutching each other and trying to be as quiet as possible.
. I thought I lost you.’
When it finally passes, there is magic crackling beneath Harry’s veins so potent he could tear the whole fortress down around him with a flick of his fingers. He could wipe this Dementor-stained island clean off the face of the earth, turn its stones into sand and its walls into salt.
Harry leans over to look at Draco, scanning his face worriedly.
.’ Ginny says, wrinkling her nose in a way that means,
Draco’s face is cast half in shadow, half in the light that reaches out towards them from the tent and its lively occupants. The music is distant and distorted by the space and the gentle night breeze, but Harry recognizes the strains of a familiar jig.
‘Oh, she’s livid,’ Neville says, clearly entertained by the whole thing.
She’s gotten a lot more cool-headed since the war ended. Harry thought the same would happen to him, but he feels like a bomb ready to go off at any moment, full to the brim with sharp, hot rage. The one thing that got him through the worst of it was the promise of peace. But the wizarding world seems to enjoy lingering in the shit and quagmire of the war, dragging on the war trials in a disgustingly public spectacle, throwing overpriced memorial balls and shallow benefits. Meanwhile, nothing is being done about the wandless families, the injured, or the decimated homes. Hogwarts is still in ruins - no reconstruction can be carried out until the Ministry issues the appropriate approvals, but of course they’re too preoccupied with prosecuting anyone remotely related to a Death Eater.
Harry distantly recalls the last time Michelle
‘Don’t gang up on me,’ Harry says, levelling a look at Draco, who only smiles innocently back at him. ‘Two against one is unfair.’
Ginny’s mouth dropped open in a noiseless, frustrated scream. ‘Then
As it turns out, it is easy to learn to be good and kind and compassionate when you are shown those traits on a daily basis - especially when they are directed at you.
It sits on the top of a hill with a view of a nearby beach, with a tiled roof, white-washed walls, a delightful brick chimney, and a cerulean post-box out front which Harry helped paint by hand. If Harry turns to the left, he can see the moonlight reflecting off the sea, and the foam glowing silver over the briny water as the waves rush towards the sandy shore. There is a copse of trees just behind Draco’s house, and beyond that, the steeple of a church that rings out just a little too loudly every Sunday.
Prentis shakes her head. ‘Maybe you should fix your Anchors back up,’ she suggests.
He finds Draco standing at the edge of the property, looking out into the night. The end of his cigarette flares orange - a dragon’s eye winking in the dark. His shirt sleeves are rolled up to the elbows and his hair has begun to curl at the nape of his neck. He looks perfect like this, his neat clothes in slight disarray, like a well-organised house full of mismatched decorations and over-loved furniture and coffee stains on the table. He smiles at Harry as he approaches, slow and sweet, and Harry wonders if it’s always been like this - if they’ve always behaved like lovers even when neither of them had the courage to see it.
Harry slams the other boy against the dungeon wall and tears the wand from his hand. ‘
anymore.
, rising up around him in a tidal wave - the gentle warmth radiating from his body, the cold press of his fingers against the back of Harry’s hands, the slope of the bed that gives way to his weight, his magic enveloping them in its soothing embrace, the blurry shape of his shoulders and the rise of his cheekbone and the dip of his cupid’s bow.
They are as alike as they are different. The family resemblance is an echo of a refrain, hidden in the razor’s edge of their beauty and the uncanny grace with which they move. Andromeda’s hair is all grey now, and she wears it short, cut to her ears. Her clothes mostly Muggle apart from the outer robe she wears draped over her shoulders in a vague attempt at formality. But it isn’t Andromeda’s similarity to Narcissa that makes everyone stare at her in stunned silence. It is her disconcerting resemblance to her other sister - the one whose shrieking laughter still haunts Harry’s dreams.
It’s been kind of a year, huh guys? Please enjoy some escapism with me, stay hydrated, take your meds, call your loved ones and your found family, and remember to be extra kind to yourself. Love you all.
, you will not,’ Astoria says, deadly as black ice. She strides forward, her eyes burning with a sort of fury that would make lesser men quake in their boots.
Both Ginny and Ron look at her.
‘Yes, Mrs. Malfoy,’ he replies. ‘I think I do.’
It’s perfect.
. But he can’t tell her that. She’s worried enough about him already.
‘Yeah, well,’ Harry forces a grin. ‘Life as an Auror. Guess there’ll be time to sleep when I’m dead.’
He resents Neville with every fibre of his being, and he hates himself for it.
‘Proudfoot wanted to interview you,’ he tells Harry. ‘Get your statement for what happened at Narcissa’s.’
Brief mentions of gore ahead. There's also a paragraph about being crushed under small spaces, so if you have claustrophobia this is going to be an unpleasant one.
responds to Hermione. Not once since the trials has Draco missed a message. As loathe as he is to admit it, his Draco-on-vacation theory is looking a little shaky.
‘Proudfoot can fuck right off,’ Harry states, his eyes still fixed on Draco.
Astoria makes a beeline for Draco as he gets up to greet her. Though she is barely tall enough to reach his shoulders, she is still strong enough to squeeze the air out of his lungs as she wraps her arms around him. She smells like a childhood home ought to, like old wool and butter and flowers, and for a moment Draco feels an unnamed emotion catch him by the throat.
‘Yeah, he hasn’t written to me, either,’ Harry nods. ‘But he does go off the grid from time to time.’
Harry turns toward Draco, reaching out, trying to run towards him, but it’s like he’s moving through water and Draco is a hundred miles away. Draco’s shirt falls apart in strips. Beneath, his skin, his flesh, his bone split like butter beneath a hot knife as the severing curse rips his chest open. His mouth opens as he stares down at the blood spilling from his body, dark and impossibly red. It runs in rivulets over his fingers as he presses his hand to the gaping wound.
When Harry’s eyes start to burn uncomfortably from staring at the same report for too long, he takes a self-inking quill and some parchment out onto the balcony and writes a stack of letters to officially request information from the Aurors who worked Lucius’s case all those years ago. At least one of them should be able to point him in the right direction.
The pleasant lines of Stephen's face begin to harden as his eyes glide over the documents. He mutters something under his breath, and though Draco has little-to-no understanding of Cantonese, he knows the intonation of a swear word when he hears one.
Draco hums thoughtfully. ‘Hogwarts or post-Hogwarts?’
‘You’re an absolute imbecile,’ Draco sighs. ‘Yes, Harry. I’ll be your boyfriend.’
‘Friends,’ he repeats. He looks at her, beautiful and bright - a girl made for the sun.
‘These,’ he says quietly. ‘These helped me find you.’
There were nights when Draco would get quiet, and his eyes would take on a haunted look, and he would say horrible things about himself that made Harry want to cry or scream or shake Draco until he stopped.
Smythe smiles widely and hands over a scroll.
Harry tugs off his cardigan and drapes it over a clotheshorse - purchased by Draco and forced upon Harry after one too many shirt-on-chair incidents. He needs a hot shower to ease the knots in his back, and he hasn’t washed his hair in days.
,’ Harry insists. ‘And I’m not. I’m not even good.’
‘Yeah, and school in general,’ Harry laughs. ‘I was a bit distracted, I guess. Basilisks, dementors, werewolves, Barty Crouch Jr’s dastardly plans.’ He puts his wand back in its holster. ‘That kind of stuff screws with your grades a little.’
‘Hey,’ says Neville in protest, grabbing his wife’s arm. ‘Plant-based diets are an extremely important component to building a sustainable future.’
‘Leaflet has a wide definition,’ Angel chuckles, and then winks exaggeratedly at Harry.
‘Why haven’t you looked like this before?’ Harry demands. ‘You’re always… I don’t know.’ He gestures lamely, failing to find the words for Malfoy’s general snooty, annoying presence.
Harry grips Draco tightly in his arms.
‘We’ve figured it out,’ George says, and he thrusts a scroll into Harry’s hands.
and his bloody fucking ability to be so
Harry thanks Acquafredda again, and offers another apology for overstaying his welcome, to which the man gives him a long look, and says something like,
He peels his jacket off his shoulders and throws it over the only available seat left - which, incidentally, is next to Blaise. The Unspeakable rises smoothly from his seat, striding into the kitchen only to return a moment later with a plate of food for Charlie.
Hermione rubs his back soothingly. ‘You made some very good points, Harry,’ she tells him brightly. ‘Even if you did call the members of the Wizengamot
Draco tilts his head the way he always does when he’s trying to figure Harry out. ‘Well done on following DMLE protocol?’ he guesses.
That night, Harry can’t sleep. He wanders into Draco’s room to find him still up, reading in bed with only the bedside lamp on.
Harry wants to kiss him. He wants to bury his soapy hands in Draco’s hair and tumble into bed with him, wants to make love to him until they forget the terrible history that ties them together, wants to wake up in the mornings next to him, wants to get down on his knees and ask for a forever he knows he doesn’t deserve.
‘Have you heard anything?’ she asks.
Draco, which is why he’s here, trying not to throw himself into the gutter in an attempt to roll away from all this awkwardness.
‘I can’t change our past,’ Draco tells Harry, ‘no matter how much I want to. But,’ he adds, his voice taking on a hard, determined tone, ‘you’re not going to be a tragedy. I’m not going to be a tragedy. We’re going to have everything, Harry. Just you wait and see.’
The Unspeakable smiles a little wider. ‘Oh, but we can,’ he says, and winks at Harry, like they’re both involved in this hare-brained scheme. He pulls a small envelope out of the pocket of his robes and sends it flying over to Proudfoot with an elegant flick of his wand.
Proudfoot is silent.
‘How very thoughtful of you,’ Draco says, peering inside the bag. ‘Oh, I’ve always wanted this!’
alcohol. But no Dreamless Sleep - otherwise you wouldn’t look so shit.’ She flashes him a cheeky wink.
; Hermione’s face as white as the sheets tucked around Harry’s motionless body, Ron’s shock and disbelief morphing quickly into fury;
Updates might be a little hectic as we enter the holiday season - please bear with me, thank you, love you.
‘He’s in Brussels,’ Harry replies bluntly. ‘Where he’s been for the past year. It’s on his business card and everything. He does monthly ads in the Quibbler - Malfoy isn’t exactly in hiding, you know.’
romantic, mate. I’ve got goosebumps.’
Angel’s eyebrows rocket upwards. ‘
To mark the start of summer holidays, Teddy decides that Rose and Hugo need to experience the Muggle-made wonder of Alton Towers. Harry isn’t entirely sure how Teddy manages to convince anyone that this is a good idea, but the end result has Ron waking up at the crack of dawn to shove them all into his minivan and drive them into the heart of the country.
She closes her hand over the railing in a white-knuckle grip as she describes the raid, the severing curse hitting her son, the horrible stain that lives in her house now from the blood that refused to wash out, the four days of agony as she waited to hear whether her son would live.
‘I shan’t tell you,’ Draco announces.
Draco doesn’t reply. His uneven breaths fill the space between them.
‘Fine,’ Harry relents. He unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls them up to his elbows, revealing the interlocking spheres tattooed on his forearms in black ink.
Narcissa’s gaze slides off Harry and settles somewhere behind his shoulder. ‘So thoughtful of him,’ she says, as though Harry hadn’t said a word. ‘Draco was always such a thoughtful boy. A good boy.’ She lifts her cup halfway to her lips, then sets it back into the saucer. ‘Too good,’ she murmurs. ‘Too… too good.’
‘Stephen is their New York liaison,’ Astoria chimes in. She slings her arm through her husband’s and looks up at him, full of love and pride.
‘You have until tomorrow evening to make preparations,’ the Unspeakable continues smoothly. ‘We will arrange an international portkey for you, but the rest will have to be at your own expense.’
Kingsley looks deeply annoyed at being ordered around by a Malfoy, of all people, but he sets his now-empty glass down on the desk and pulls his wand from his pocket. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘Please come here, Harry.’
The nurses blush and giggle each time Harry accompanies Draco to his check-ups. The papers print tear-jerking fluff pieces about the tortured boy forced into servitude under a monster - a very Blackbeard, Beauty-and-the-Beast tale that could not be further from the truth.
Ginny’s face is buried in Harry’s shoulder and she’s making awful, snorting giggles. It’s not at all subtle.
Harry feels his shame spread through him, locking his joints and churning his gut. Since Harry set foot in Hogwarts, Neville’s been nothing but nice to Harry - because he’s a good friend and always has been. He’s always been kind and honest and selfless and helpful.
Smythe glowers at Harry. He pulls his wand out of his holster and strides towards the nearest cabinet. ‘I’m afraid we’ll have to inspect them,’ he announces.
Harry raises his eyebrows at the bizarreness of the request, but it’s hardly a Herculean task. He can’t quite reach down to the holster strapped to his thigh, and the semi-formal robes Draco bullied him into wearing fall over his trousers in a way that makes the whole thing a hassle, so he just casts the spell wandlessly. The weight of the glass shifts considerably as it swells into a spherical bowl, and Harry nearly drops it as he loses his balance.
Ron leans over his wife, picks up her tea with all its floating biscuit carcasses, and lifts it as though in a toast. ‘Yup,’ he says, grinning humourlessly. ‘Fuck Dumbledore.’
‘No I’m not,’ Neville says, cutting him off with a dismissive gesture. ‘And Singh says she’ll help with quidditch practice.’
- and the Auror investigation.
‘We’re bound by magical contract,’ Guy adds.
‘I dun like hairy caterpillars,’ he mutters, sounding cotton-fuzzy from sleep. ‘S’not nice. Not in my socks. They were in my
If you want to say hi, I’m totheseaweshallgo on tumblr dot com :D
Harry glances at Blaise as he rolls into his second story. The Unspeakable’s expression turns grim as he receives the silent message -
‘Of course you wouldn’t, Harry.’ Her eyes shine in the starlight and Harry feels a horrible lurching in his gut because he doesn’t want her to cry on her wedding night over him. ‘But Draco didn’t need you to ask. He’s always been there. He’s there each and every time the rest of us couldn’t be, and you never had to ask him.’
you do it? How did you find me?’
‘That’s good,’ Hermione nods. She manages a broken, malformed smile, but it swiftly dissolves. ‘Have you heard anything?’ she asks, sounding too exhausted to be hopeful.
It sits in his gut, sour and curdling.
‘Per-fect,’ Healer Thompson says, tapping her clipboard again. ‘Is it the address we have on record for you, Professor?’
‘Technically,’ says Harry, completely deadpan, ‘I’m not laughing.’
‘Harold,’ Teddy grins, every bit the picture of his mother.
Harry ignores the way his chest grows warm at the words
leaving Harry to shut the door behind them and start a broad sweep of the apartment.
Harry sighs heavily. ‘It’s probably nothing,’ he says. ‘And while I’m not exactly happy about being sent abroad halfway through my students’ exams, I’m perfectly fine. It’s not like before, Hermione.’ He walks around the desk and places his palms on her shoulders. ‘I promise.’
‘You know,’ Draco muses, drawing Harry’s attention back towards him once more, ‘it might be that you got a little too close to the truth. The Selwyns have donated very generously to the Ministry restructure since the trials.’ He glances up at Harry, his eyes nearly glowing in the bar’s low light. ‘My father certainly employed similar tactics to keep the Ministry off his back after the first war. I’m sure he’s moving around his assets right now in an attempt to gain favour with just the right people to grant him parole.’
Harry raises his eyebrows inquisitively at Draco and the other man tilts the bag so that Harry can see the carefully wrapped candle hiding inside. Draco loves his scented candles - a remnant from the days he used to live in that little flat in Muggle London before he passed his parole.
‘Now then children, let’s not fight,’ George says lightly. ‘Harry, sit down before you pass out or sick up. Ron, shut up and go make us some tea.’
The oldest member of the Wizengamot leans down beyond his bench, lifting his spectacles from his face so that he can peer down at Andromeda. ‘Good afternoon, Mrs. Tonks,’ he greets politely. ‘Are you going to talk to us about your nephew’s character?’
He recognizes the man at the head of the flock - Smythe, the young Auror who came to Hogwarts the day this all started. He remembers tying the Auror’s shoelaces together, tripping him over as a joke. Despite the ugly sneer on the man’s face as he approaches, Harry can’t quite bring himself to regret it.
Harry holds up a finger against his lips and shakes his head, miming silence. He pulls his wand out of its holster and waves it at Pansy’s extractor fan. There is a mild chime, and then the awful tension that’s been bothering Harry since he got here unravels.
Hermione is curled up on the sofa, still in last night’s dress. She scrambles to her feet as Draco steps through the fireplace. Her mascara is a messy streak beneath her right eye. Draco isn’t sure if she’s been crying.
Harry frowns at him confusedly.
So Neville is the only who knows, really, why Harry left the Aurors four years ago. Neville knows who Harry sends those owls to every week, the same person who sends back chocolates and home-brewed potions and first-edition books. Neville knows why Harry is always nicer to the Slytherins than the other professors, why Harry tends to spend more time with the prickly, difficult students that nobody else wants to deal with. Neville doesn’t judge. He just listens, and he smiles, and makes shitty jokes at Harry’s expense and makes Harry feel normal.
He wonders where the remains of Vincent Crabbe are.
A few students are caught in the storm as it descends upon the sloping, green hills. They come running up into the castle, their shouts of surprise and laughter nearly drowned by the torrential rain. One girl - a fifth-year - shoves her wand in the air and casts a particularly impressive umbrella charm, modified to fit all her friends underneath. Harry watches the rain bounce off the invisible dome around the young witch, takes note of the colour of her tie, and waves his wand.
The memories of the War, of Voldemort - those are dim when Harry is awake. But in sleep, they are vivid, embellished with details Harry wishes he could forget.
Draco turns towards Harry, his eyes widening in horrified realisation. ‘Harry, no,’ he says.
Only, there’s a soreness in Harry’s chest now, like an old bruise. It blooms like a flower when Draco murmurs goodnight to Teddy, inky petals spreading over Harry’s heart when Draco hugs him goodbye.
Harry turns back to the windows. He waves his wand, racing through the long list of spells to protect the glass from the worst parts of the storm. The charms protecting the Herbology greenhouses are old and frayed. He’s been meaning to replace them for a while now, but in between grading and helping with quidditch practice, he never really got round to it.
The double doors of the Great Hall swing open with a bang and Harry is out of his seat, his wand in his hand. Three figures stride through the long tables of gathered students, tracking in mud and rainwater. The Great Hall falls into awful, shocked silence as the men make their way down past the long tables of students.
and fails spectacularly.
‘And,’ Angel says, a smile growing on his face too, ‘we can tell you that the password is known
Harry sighs and curves closer into Draco.
Draco studies his friend’s face for a beat, and it seems like he’s spotted something there that is undetectable to Harry.
Or maybe Robards was just like the rest of the people who saw something in Harry that needed to be stamped out, eviscerated, destroyed, beaten down and buried under rubble. After all, Robards was putting Harry on suicide missions long before Lucius ever got out on parole.
‘Harry.’ Draco lifts Harry’s hand off his chest and turns it over so that he can kiss into Harry’s palm. ‘Listen to me. Listen to me very carefully. The only person who is responsible for this scar is the person who cast the curse.’
Draco cups Harry’s face with his palm, brushing the tears away from Harry’s cheek with the pad of his thumb. ‘
He thinks about how love can undo even the greatest of curses, and he looks at Draco and feels a tidal wave of emotion. Their life has been a long string of tragedies - loss and rot and ruin - and yet here they are, standing on the pathway to everything-forever.
A letter came from Draco this morning.
She smiles at him, grooves setting into the corners of her eyes as she strains against her tears. She might not love him the way Harry does, but she loves him - deeply, unequivocally, in that fierce way that only she can.
because Draco’s taught him better manners than that. ‘Did you sleep alright?’
CW: mentions of being trapped, injuries, death, and a character experiencing a PTSD flashback
There is a hollowness that lives inside of him - a crevice formed by the force of his self-hatred, deepened by pain and exhaustion. It makes him feel cold even in the warmest hours of the day, even when his hands are hovering above the licking flames in the fireplace (close enough to singe his palms, but that’s what potions and salves are for, to heal the marks, hide the evidence). He wanders through this empty manor and feels that hollowness expand until it consumes every last bit of him. He wants to fall into the long shadows of this place and never re-emerge.
Harry frowns. ‘Wait,’ he says slowly. ‘What if George
It’s better than Paris - because Paris was an adventure, but Ghent is home to Draco.
Draco appears at Harry’s elbow as suddenly as though he’d Apparated there. ‘Are you alright?’ he asks softly, pressing his palm into Harry’s back.
Draco flattens his lips into something too angry to be a smile. ‘Blackmail the Minister of Magic into freeing my fiancé and putting away the people responsible,’ he replies, not bothering to hide the icy rage from his voice. ‘And then tip off every independent newspaper I can find before the DMLE can bury this.’
‘Get off me!’ Harry growls. He takes a few hurried steps backwards, yanking out of Neville’s grip. ‘Please just-’ he breaks off, panting, his lungs burning like they’ve been sandpapered on this inside. ‘Please just leave me alone.’
Lightning cracks across the clouds, and the skies descend upon them in sheets of icy water. For a moment they stand looking at one another, as the rain flattens Draco’s hair against his skull, and the ground grows soft and muddy from the pummelling of heavy raindrops, and then Draco reaches out for Harry’s hand and they run back towards the house, laughing breathlessly as Molly throws open the door and yells at them to come inside and get dry.
Toward the tail end of fifth year, Severus started teaching Draco potions to be used on a battlefield. Draco knows now that it was a dismal attempt to build Draco a shelter for the oncoming storm, even though they both knew nothing could lessen its devastating blow.
Was this supposed to be a Looking For Draco fic? Ahahaha guess not?
He shuts the door behind him with a gentle click.
Harry laughs, despite the heavy weight of rejection. ‘Right,’ he says, smiling self-deprecatingly. ‘I’m sorry. I should have asked if you want - of course you don’t.’
Neville laughs. ‘That sounds
The corner of Blaise’s mouth tightens. He shifts his weight again, dancing from one foot to the next (an old nervous tic from learning ballet under his mother’s strict instructions). ‘They’ll let him out if he agrees to another modifier tattoo,’ he reveals, wincing even as he pronounces the words. ‘One that cuts him off from his magic. All his magic. Permanently.’
For Draco, he has to try.
Draco puts on the radio as they eat, coaxing out sunshine tunes to battle the tempest outside.
in it.
‘Why do you think it was your fault?’ Draco asks, his voice soft. By some miracle he hasn’t left yet, and he’s the only thing keeping Harry from sinking into the ocean of his misery.
He dives into the current and lets it carry them away.
‘Alright, alright,’ Draco says, holding his hands up in defeat. ‘But really, what did you do this time?’
Draco feels a part of his heart cave in, an overripe fruit pressed too hard beneath an unforgiving thumb. He reaches across the table to take Hermione’s hand in his. ‘Less of that, please, Advocate Granger-Weasley,’ he says. ‘You need rest.’
Harry is in the hospital cafeteria with Daphne and Luna, sipping at a cup of appalling hospital-quality coffee when Daphne’s token chimes. She looks up at Harry and nods a silent confirmation.
It always rains in this city, so they get caught in a downpour, but as they huddle beneath the shade of a tree, a busker on the steps of a nearby church starts playing the soft refrains of Bach on her cello. Harry glances at Draco, noting the way the droplets of water slide down from his cheekbones to his jaw, and suppresses the urge to kiss him.
Draco arches an eyebrow in mock disbelief.
Harry’s anger begins to boil, sending sparks of magic running through his veins down to his fingertips. An Auror should know better than anyone else how heavy the weight of survivor’s guilt can feel, and that the relatives and friends of victims feel it most. It’s part of the bloody training.
There are dams built around each person’s magical core. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn how to siphon off a witch or wizard’s power into a spell - usually through gestures with a conduit, such as a wand, and a few syllables. That is why wordless and wandless spells are so difficult. But Harry… Harry’s
‘Draco,’ says Harry, nearly blind with desperation, ‘stay with me,
Draco doesn’t want to be in love with Potter, but you can’t outrun a storm - not by broom, not by train, not even by turning on your heel and Disapparating.
Harry stretches out the cramp in his shoulder. ‘I probably shouldn’t be, at this hour,’ he confesses.
‘And adjust those Anchors,’ Daphne orders him. ‘Or I’m putting you in a bed too.’
‘I’ve got fast track tickets,’ she tells Teddy, who looks like she’s just made all his dreams come true. ‘We can go on everything twice.’
Harry levels a look at her, but he can already feel his anger fizzle out. He’s pretty sure Robards paired him with Prentis to slow him down, but they actually work quite well together. Prentis might be a good foot smaller than everyone else, and she’s slow on the draw, but she’s got a mind sharper than half the department put together, and she knows how to keep Harry cool.
‘Draco Malfoy has not shown up to his place of work in a week,’ Proudfoot says, 'and there are signs that he left in a hurry. We also have a lead that the dangerous Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy, is in Brussels. They may be working together.’
‘Look who I bumped into,’ Harry says, forcing himself to smile cheerfully. He jerks his thumb in Blaise’s direction. ‘I ran into him yesterday and said I was visiting. I thought it would be nice to drop by together to see you before I head back across the pond.’
The man smiles. His teeth are brilliant against his dark skin. ‘You may have two weeks to perform a private investigation into the disappearance of Draco Malfoy,’ says the Unspeakable. ‘After that point, you will make every effort to cooperate with Auror Proudfoot and his partner.’
be more than this.’
To call it a manual is an understatement. The booklet contains all the information on how the Panic Room works - its functions, the amount of days it can sustain people inside based on the number of people, the types of spells it can defend against. It’s not a key, but it might be enough for Harry to reverse-engineer one.
Marsters’s expression shifts almost imperceptibly, a shadow of grief darkening his eyes for a sliver of a moment. ‘He was part of the team assigned to sweep the perimeter before the Diagon Incident.’
‘This is what she’s
, and Harry melts like sugar in water. Harry’s hands clutch at Draco’s shirt, fine cotton wrinkling in his fists. Draco’s fingers are cool as they trace down the sides of Harry’s neck, down, down, down, one hand to cup the nape of his neck, the other to splay across the triangle of bare skin beneath his clavicle.
Pansy hands Harry back his tea, having added a splash of milk and two cubes of sugar.
Harry smiles at Draco’s secretary. ‘Thank you.’
During his first year working in Hogwarts, the Ministry had (illegally) continued the tracking spells placed on his wand. When one of Neville’s sixth-year students had accidentally fallen into a bush of extremely carnivorous hybrid plants, Harry’s years of Auror training had kicked in and he’d fired off a succession of binding spells at the bush before it could do any damage to the screaming teenager. Ten minutes later, a group of Aurors had descended upon the greenhouses, accusing Harry of going Dark and attacking students.
They skirt around the words, but Harry knows the implications. He’s had these conversations with Draco before - bleak, dry-eyed conversations late into the night while they sit elbow-to-elbow in Grimmauld Place, drinking tea by the fire.
Hermione bursts into loud, ugly sobs, and Ron hugs him so hard his rib cage nearly breaks a second time. Draco watches silently from his seat, but then he smiles at Harry, all tender and sweet, and Harry knows he’s made the right decision for once.
Draco turns Harry’s hand, palm-up, and buries his face in it. Harry feels the cup of his hand grow damp and his chest aches with a deep, throbbing pain that has nothing to do with his ruined organs or his broken ribs. It’s not a confession, not quite, but it’s the only thing he knows how to say, the only thing that feels true enough to be permitted to see the light of day.
There was blood everywhere. Andromeda nearly had an aneurysm, and Teddy was beyond consolation, shouting about throwing his broom into a wood-chipper between hiccupping sobs, which was very sweet but entirely unnecessary, because Harry was already handing over his emergency bottle of Dittany.
He breathes a sigh of relief and gives Pansy the subtlest of nods. She’s bought him some time, and he absolutely loves her for it.
‘Do you think you’ll remember any of this in the morning?’ Harry asks.
Harry lets out a surprised guffaw. ‘You could never be a twat, Neville,’ he grins. ‘You’re too fucking noble.’
Harry frowns briefly. He can’t imagine sitting down and actually talking about any of it to someone. He’s always just hunkered down and powered through the worst of it. Maybe that’s not the wisest approach. Maybe he still wakes up in the middle of the night with horrible nightmares. Maybe sometimes Ginny makes him sleep in their guest bedroom when he’s having a difficult week because she can’t sleep for his screaming - but they’ve gotten through so much worse, during the war. They’ll get through it.
Harry used to come on holidays here with Draco, back when they were still reckless and young and eager to experience as much of the world as possible. Harry had never really been anywhere before, and Draco - well. Draco had never been to Muggle France, and he wanted to see all of it.
Draco thinks of a conversation he once had with his aunt - a sad, honest conversation, about the other love of Remus’s life, the beautiful boy with a dangerous smile. He was the only other person in their family who managed to break free of the dark, insidious web of the Black influence. His absence is a yawning cavern in Andromeda’s heart, even if his loss meant Tonks and Remus could find each other (because love is not a finite resource, and Tonks also knew how to love Remus as he deserved to be loved, and knew how to heal the ragged wounds torn into the both of them by an unkind world). Andromeda showed him the letters she and her cousin exchanged, when the world had not yet tasted the bitter devastation of Voldemort’s first war.
‘But at Neville and Ginny’s wedding -’ Harry utters, incredulous. ‘We
are the one who is exceptionally gifted at this.’
Perhaps it is morbid curiosity that drives him to walk deep into its ruins, or perhaps he is a glutton for punishment these days, desperate for barbs to dig into old sores. It is all still ash and decimation, and Harry doesn’t know if the old beast has opened its doors to a single soul since the day of the Battle.
he hopes he’s wrong. ‘Lucius has a broken but very powerful magical artefact,’ he says, ‘and he needs someone with experience in fixing powerful magical artefacts. Wouldn’t a Vanishing Cabinet qualify as a powerful magical artefact?’
‘I wanted to stay here with you,’ Harry whispers. ‘I wanted to build a forever with you.’
He takes a deep breath and pushes his magic down, easing the red-hot energy out of his fingers.
Harry turns his head, burying his face in Draco’s hair. It smells like mass-produced hair potions (something that Draco would
There is a faint roaring sound as the Floo comes to life once more. Hermione stands quickly, the legs of her chair scraping back over the carpeted floor. Ron ducks in through the archway, and Ginny follows right after, wearing her pyjamas and a pinched expression.
Draco meets his gaze for a second, and though he schools his expression as masterfully as befits the heir of the house of Malfoy, Harry can see the devastation in his eyes - that horrible, yawning sorrow that he’s seen in Hermione’s face and Ron’s and sometimes Andromeda’s, when she glimpses the many scars on his wrists and forearms. Except this hurts the way none of that hurt, because this is
Harry isn’t sure which part of all of this Malfoy is apologizing for. ‘It’s not your fault,’ he says, because it feels like the truth.
The night sky shifts from dark cobalt to midnight blue. Someone charms Draco’s wireless to play music for dancing, and Harry extends the tiling of the back porch out into the garden, so nobody trips on a stray root or tumbles into a molehill. Andromeda and Narcissa do a very impressive polka for two elderly witches cavorting around a garden.
‘Thank you,’ Draco sighs. He pulls away slightly, tilting his chin to meet Harry’s gaze. Dark, hair-thin veins spread out beneath his eyes like deep cracks forking over an icy pond. ‘For being here with me. I missed you terribly.’
‘I’m fairly sure I do,’ Harry groans, shifting his hips so that Draco can feel just how much he wants.
‘Does it help?’ Harry asks anyways.
Maybe it is that
Harry’s too old for this level of stress. McGonagall is going to kill Harry. She’s going to rip his spleen out and make him eat it. That’s if the Burns family don’t order a hitwizard on him first. ‘
‘We’ve sold emergency portkeys, impenetrable doors and windows, wearable wards, protective charms - you name it.’ Angel counts off his fingers as he reels off the list, rings shimmering as he moves his hands. Harry can feel the quiet hum of the protective magic woven into them. ‘We try and keep a varied price range. People should be able to afford to be safe, y’know. But not everything we make is within the average witch or wizard’s budget.’
‘But-’ Pansy protests.
‘You don’t understand,’ Harry says.
Christ. Merlin. He’s a teacher, for fuck’s sake. And he’s got examinations to oversee. He can’t just go traipsing off to Europe on a wild goose chase for a wizard who probably isn’t missing anyways. He’s got
‘People speak like that if they’re drugged,’ Harry says thoughtfully. He glances up at Pansy. ‘Could it be that?’
?’ he utters.
‘I’m starting to see a Mind Healer, y’know,’ Harry says, glancing at Neville. ‘We Floo every Wednesday night. I’ve started to work through some stuff, like-’ he huffs out a breath and pauses. ‘Like how maybe I was groomed to hate myself and that I was exposed to a lot of danger and death really young, and that was all engineered to make me willing to martyr myself. Like how I’ve been taught that love conquers all, which is why I’ve been using love as a crutch when it shouldn’t be like that.’
He wishes he had one of his father’s cursed Time-Turners. He wants to spin its chambers between his fingers and watch time retreat to their moment on the balcony, when everything was wonderful, and the world had not yet ended.
Please enjoy my wild variety of OCs.
‘What does that mean?’ he asks. ‘La vie whatsit?’
‘It was an extensive investigation,’ the middle-aged man says dryly. ‘Ate up seven years of my life before we got told the project was being pulled and defunded. I work at a desk now, Mr. Potter,’ Marsters continues. ‘It was marketed to me as a promotion to match my seniority, but really it’s them tucking me away in a little corner until I either die or retire. I think we came too close to finding out the truth - or perhaps we’d started to uncover the depth of the rot in the Ministry. But I’m afraid that’s all I can say on the matter of Lucius Malfoy.’
‘Then he shall be counted as a war hero for his sacrifice,’ the witch states with firm authority, ‘as Severus Snape was.’
was.’
‘You’re scaring the other visitors,’ Daphne states flatly. She flicks her gaze pointedly at the crusting blood caking Harry’s clothes, the stains on the polished floor beneath his boots.
‘You know,’ he says, breaking the easy silence between them, ‘I’ve been thinking a lot about our past.’
in Brussels.
Harry sighs heavily. He puts his glasses back on and sits up straight in his chair. ‘Is McGonagall going to order me to get rid of the tank?’ he asks Neville.
‘Nor are you mine,’ Draco dismisses.
‘If I didn’t know better, Harry,’ says Neville, ‘I’d say you were prone to house favouritism.’
So Harry drops his awareness down, beneath the concrete and brick and steel and steady magic of the apartment building, beneath the foundations, into the soil and earth and rock below, until he hits the coursing, thrumming river of magic that runs there. The ley line calls to him, yanking on the threads of his magic temptingly. It would take one small leap, just one small, inconsequential leap.
, Harry. Just you wait and see.’
‘Harry’s finally shagging Malfoy,’ Ron says gleefully, ignoring Hermione’s indignant
‘Yes, it’s very much the rage,’ Narcissa replies, brightening visibly. ‘Draco bought me a lovely set by a Muggle lady - Austen, I think.’
Malfoy stares up at Harry. His eyes are so pale they might as well be transparent. He says nothing as he pulls his wand from Harry’s fingers. Somehow, his silence proves more unnerving than his usual biting remarks.
Despite the amount of champagne she’s consumed, she is actually a rather good dancer when she’s not paired up with Ron’s shoddy footwork.
‘Yeah, sure,’ Neville grins, patting Harry just a little too hard on the back. ‘If I was a cold-hearted bastard.’ He nods at Draco. ‘Hiya, Malfoy.’
‘Part of it,’ Draco replies, ‘yes.’
Malfoy shakes his head. ‘I can’t. I can’t go on like this.’ His eyes are as bright as starshine. Everything else about him is coloured in ash and bone. ‘You don’t know what I’ve done. You don’t know what he’s made me do.’
She sits with Harry for a while, holds his hand even when he’s unresponsive to her gentle nudges towards conversation. She doesn’t say a word when he finally breaks down crying, long hours of frustration and fear pouring out of him in soundless, heart-wrenching sobs. Her arms have always seemed small and delicate, but they hold him fast as she hugs him tightly through it, until he is done and empty and left with nothing but the gaping hole in his chest and the deep pit of his exhaustion.
Harry just makes a pained groan and buries his head in a pillow.
‘The year is 1990,’ Draco says, each word articulated with perfect clarity, ‘and there are rumours of Lord Voldemort making a return. A Hogwarts professor goes missing while on summer holiday, and a few Aurors are sent to investigate. That same summer, Lucius Malfoy makes a staggering payment to one Selwyn Thestral Stables. The investigation is dropped a week later.’
‘Perhaps we should drop by another time?’ Harry offers, setting down his tea. ‘I know I sort of barged in without warning.’
Harry stares at the black brand on the wall where Prentis used to exist. She didn’t even have time to scream. The fire burns, the same green as infection and sickness, its flames reaching eight feet into the sky. Harry’s mouth tastes of ash and charred bone. There’s a ringing in his ears that grows louder and louder.
Ron Transfigures one of the tables into a cot as Harry modifies his Anchors, feeling the sweetwater magic rise up over him, cooling his too-hot blood. As he lies down, he feels sleep drag him under before his head can even hit the pillow.
Harry notices, then, that Draco has gone very still. His hands are clenched so tightly his knuckles have gone pale. For a moment, Harry is worried that Hagrid’s broken some sort of archaic wizarding tradition or insulted Draco in some manner, but then Draco vaults off the bench and goes running towards Hagrid, tackling him in what looks like a bone-crushing hug.
But surely,
‘D’you want another butterbeer?’ Neville calls, fishing another bottle from the cooler. Above him, a plant that vaguely resembles an indigo-leafed weeping willow drapes its long strands over his broad shoulders. Neville bats the overly affectionate plant away with his free hand, grinning with boyish joy.
Pansy glances at Harry, and they share the briefest of looks.
Harry laughs. ‘Cheek.’
Harry decides to ignore the glaring and sits down on the loveseat opposite the fireplace, making himself a nice cup of tea (with three sugars, because he’s earned it). Draco comes to sit next to him in the loveseat, even though there’s a perfectly viable armchair nearby. His body is warm as it brushes up against Harry’s, and he smells faintly of the hospital, but he also smells like himself, and Harry finds himself leaning into Draco almost involuntarily.
‘Hello, Longbottom,’ Draco says, awarding Neville a small but genuine smile. He tires easily, even with the various energy-bolstering potions he’s been given. ‘How is the summer term going?’
Proudfoot’s irritation is tangible by the time Harry finishes lacing up his shoes. The Auror impatiently pushes open the door and waves in two of the prison guards, giving them instructions in sharp, quick commands. They lock his arms behind his back with the same magical cuffs, pinning his fingers in place with metal braces. Harry can guess that it is to prevent him from gesturing and performing wandless magic - and maybe also to serve as a petty method of psychological warfare. To make him feel helpless. Small. Powerless. A butterfly pinned within a display case.
Harry looks up from where he’s sitting on the floor of her bedroom, scanning through letters and notes Draco’s owled Pansy over the past few months. She’s sprawled across her bed with a heavy volume sitting on her ribcage, an empty bottle of Ogden’s lying beside her.
was supposed to find me.’ He tilts his head slightly as he looks at Harry, the way he does sometimes, like he’s trying to figure Harry out. ‘How
‘I’m the fun dad,’ Harry argues. ‘I taught you Quidditch. Bought you your first broom.
Pansy looks the way she always does - fishnets and stilettos and vampy makeup - and there’s some safety in that, but she’s giggling and leaning heavily on Blaise Zabini. He’s dressed in a black turtleneck that makes the cut of his jaw more devastating than usual, and there are diamond studs in his ears. Blaise is so handsome that it’s a little uncomfortable to witness. Theodore Nott stands just behind the other two, smoking a stolen cigarette. His hair is very intentionally windswept, the collar of his extortionately expensive shirt rumpled and unbuttoned. They look like spoiled, rich kids - but in a Muggle way, and it’s
Pansy looks hesitant, glancing over her shoulder at the old house looming above her.
‘You mean, you’ll get Hermione to arrange the payments for you,’ Draco responds, smiling despite everything. ‘You never know how to handle your Muggle accounts.’
One of the girls whispers something into her friend’s ear, laughs, and then winks at Draco as she hands him her copy of
Hermione glares at him hard enough to burn a hole in his skull, but after their decades of friendship, he’s gotten pretty used to it. He flicks his wand at the small wardrobe beside his bookcase, spelling his formal suit into his suitcase. He won’t need his robes in Brussels, which will be a relief considering the current heatwave.
‘Yeah, sure,’ he says. He pulls out his mobile phone from his back pocket and types in the passcode to unlock it. ‘I’ll shoot Draco a text, let him know I’ll be late.’
Pansy stares at Harry and shakes her head. ‘You complete imbecile,’ she says. ‘You could’ve gotten three more drinks out of that twink. Merlin, save us from Gryffindors.’
the curse take shape within Lucius’s body, but he can’t move fast enough.
Harry watches and waits as the pieces of the puzzle come clicking together for Proudfoot. The Auror’s face pales, and his outrage and confusion turn slowly into guilt.
that will likely never fade
‘Oh, not at all,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘Regulus Black was a Death Eater, and it is how he is remembered to this day.’
Blaise pours the wine into crystal glasses. ‘This is really quite a lovely year,’ he announces, turning the bottle over so that Narcissa can read the label. ‘Though it was an absolute disaster getting these grapes harvested that year - Paul insists on never using any magical creatures to work on his farm. I’m not sure if that’s bigoted or not, but well, it reduces the process to something almost Muggle. Do you want to hear about it, darling? It’s hilarious.’
‘Harry!’ shouts George, suddenly materialising above them. ‘Seamus has set himself on fire, we need your help with- oh, shit, sorry lads.’ His eyes are wide as he takes in their tangled bodies, Draco’s rumpled shirt, Harry's swollen mouth and the hand still cupped at the back of Harry’s neck.
The wall behind the settee folds outward like crisp paper, revealing a second, smaller apartment, lit by a hundred lights embedded into the walls. There are papers scattered over the small cot in the corner of the room, over the desk, on the floor, and pinned to the walls. Draco kneels on the ground and Lucius stands above him, his wand pointed at the back of his son’s neck.
The wards chime, ringing out an inappropriately cheerful tune, and there comes a knocking on the door. Ron squeezes his wife’s shoulder once and heads off to answer the door.
Harry shakes his head. ‘Don’t come near me,’ he says, because he still hasn’t gotten it under control.
‘I see,’ says Andromeda. ‘If this is the measure by which you judge others, then it seems my nephew must be martyred to be worthy of your consideration. Thank you, but I think I have enough martyrs in my family.’
‘Oh, I’m sure I understand,’ Draco snorts. ‘I’m pretty fucked up too. Maybe even more fucked up than you.’
In the night, they open the windows as the air cools. The wind is scented with lavender and the sky is bedazzled with meteor showers. The curtains billow in dramatic arcs, ghosting over the edge of their bed.
Ron is hot at her heels, looming behind her at his full height. Even as a retired shop-owner, he is still terrifying enough for some of the younger Aurors in the group to take a few steps back.
Harry extends a cup and saucer to Pansy. She snatches it from his hands and tucks it to her chest possessively, glowering at him as though he’s personally offended her somehow.
He pushes Harry back with enough force to separate their bodies. The haze of desire lifts off Harry slightly, but not enough to stop him from locking his hands around Draco’s wrists.
Proudfoot stares at the Minister as though he’s grown a second head.
‘You suffered a lifetime of hero worship,’ he says. ‘It ruined your childhood. I can understand why watching the same thing happen to me would make you uncomfortable. To be honest,’ he adds, smiling crookedly, ‘it makes me extremely uncomfortable too. Pedestals are dangerous things to fall from.’
- and it burns in his cheeks and leaves a humming in his ears.
NEARLY DONE NOW - Thank you for sticking with this story and with me. The chaos is finally dying down a bit on my end, thankfully.
Stephen frowns slightly. ‘Passed the national exam first try, fresh out of school,’ he says. ‘A qualification in alchemy is a prerequisite to join the Singaporean Apothecary Association.’
‘Yes,’ says Draco, despairingly.
‘It really isn’t, Potter,’ Pansy says, sounding choked. When he looks back up at her, he can see that her eyes are bright with tears. ‘You don’t get it, do you? Of course you don’t - you’ve always been the most oblivious of the lot.
‘Oh god,’ whispers Hermione. She presses her shaking hands against her chest. ‘This can’t be happening. This can’t be happening again.’
He walks and walks and walks down the country lane until it’s finally quiet, and then he leans against a fence and tries to remember how to make his lungs work again. He’s bent over with his hands braced on the cold metal railing, when he hears a faint pop behind him.
‘Then we should
‘I don’t know if this is right,’ Harry protests. ‘I’m unqualified.’
The momentum of being released sends Harry tipping forward towards the hard floorboards, and for a moment he thinks he’s probably going to break his nose again, but he finds himself colliding with Draco’s solid, warm chest. Harry’s Anchors chime pleasantly as Draco’s familiar, deepwater magic washes over him in a soothing tide. The roaring magic of the world and its ley lines and its storms recedes. His magic withdraws into the narrow frame of his flesh, blood and bone.
, but
Harry tilts his half-full cup towards Pansy. ‘Still working on it.’
‘Destroy it,’ Draco says firmly before Harry can open his mouth. A dark cloud flits over his face, drawing his eyes into shadow. ‘I was not the only person forced to work on that thing. It might not use any Dark magic, but a thing stained with that much pain and death is bound to grow cursed over time.’
Draco drops his hand onto Harry’s forearm and squeezes it. ‘But I’m so good at it.’
He expects to see anger in Neville’s face - or perhaps confusion, disgust - but instead the Herbology Professor just looks sad.
They talk for a little while. Harry finds out that Malfoy’s still got one year left without magic, but that he’d rather get a new wand than take back the one Harry won from him. Apparently his therapist thinks he shouldn’t keep any personal effects that were given to him by the ‘religious cult’ - which is why Malfoy is dressed so very Muggle.
Neville nods, laughing. ‘She’s no longer allowed to sit in the back of the class.’
Harry gives a sharp nod. He gives the door a few polite knocks and steps back.
Harry laughs even as he grabs Draco’s wrist and pins it against his chest. ‘I’m kidding,’ he grins. ‘I know what you meant. I just don’t know if it’s appropriate to talk about it or if it would make you uncomfortable to hear-’
None of them are particularly young anymore, but in this moment, they almost feel like teenagers again, sitting together as the music slips into something a little sweeter, a little slower - and it makes them nostalgic for a past that none of them share, but one that could have been.
‘I’m sorry,’ frowns another member of the Wizengamot - a witch with cranberry-shaped earrings. ‘I thought you said he helped kill Voldemort.’
‘I’m sorry,’ he says. ‘It’s just- I feel so fucking helpless. Useless.’
‘Anything you want from me is yours, too,’ he says.
She stands, leaving Harry with only a view of her ankles as she walks briskly to her desk. He hears a cupboard slide open and click shut, and then Michelle’s feet make a return to the fireplace. She kneels down, places a card between the tongs, and tucks it expertly behind Harry’s ear.
as the book impacts against the flat of his hand. Another flick of Draco’s wand, and book slams open, the pages fluttering as the volume flicks open.
Pansy sits on the steps of Grimmauld Place, cat-eye sunglasses perched on the top of her head as she leans back to soak in the rays of the late afternoon sun. A glossy shopping bag is perched on the edge of the very top step, the White Company logo embossed on its side. She grins lazily at Harry and Draco as they approach and wiggles her fingers in greeting.
Harry thinks of his fifth years - of Reynolds, skinny, freckled and asthmatic, of the Smithson sisters, Hufflepuff Beaters, and Beckinsdale, who’s only just managed to beat his first Boggart - and he tries to imagine them going to war, but they’re so young, so small.
‘I’ve got some funds to invest,’ she tells him excitedly, swapping his wine with her flask of vodka. ‘Let’s draw something up.’
, Draco called it once.
‘Professor Harry James Potter,’ Proudfoot reads aloud, his face pinching as though he’s tasted something vile, ‘is hereby appointed official consultant to the Department of Mysteries.’ He thrusts the letter in Harry’s direction. ‘
‘You need to get some sleep,’ Ron says, quiet with worry. ‘Harry, you’re doing it again.’
Harry releases the last bit of the spell, and the Lopez Panic Room gives an angry little shudder as it unlocks.
‘Alright,’ Harry nods. That gives him ample time to Apparate to Grimmauld Place, change out of his robes, and pop back here. ‘Fancy a pint?’
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise seems to have asked all his questions. He twists the cap back onto his pen and tucks it into the breast pocket of his waistcoat. The crease between his eyebrows disappears, and his face empties of any expression, like a sheet pulled tight over a mattress.
Without the ever-present weight of Voldemort’s horcrux in his body, his magic is completely out of balance. The Healers say he’ll get it under control soon enough, but for now he’s prone to fits of accidental magic. Some days it makes all his cutlery float. Other days he makes things explode - like today, where he’s reduced the court to splinters and warped metal.
A pillar of roaring fire and rubble crashes into the air as the next explosion erupts from the street beneath them, consuming Prentis whole.
She brandishes Harry’s hastily scribbled message threateningly. ‘Don’t you try and change the subject,’ she frowns. ‘What’s happened to Draco? Why are they sending you to find him? I thought you quit the Ministry.’
The Astronomy Tower is an archive of painful memories too, but it’s easier to breathe up here. And here he can see the string of stars that form Draco’s namesake, and it makes the distance feel smaller, somehow. He makes a habit of it, climbing the endless staircase each night to watch the constellations.
Maybe I should call this fic 'Looking for Malfoy' because that's all we're going to be doing in the next few chapters
Harry wakes with a jolt to find Ron and George looming above him. He rubs the fatigue out of his eyes, still bleary from sleep, and adjusts his glasses. Ron’s hair looks like it’s been attacked by a small cyclone, and George is grinning maniacally.
It’s about three in the morning when Daphne shakes Harry awake. He doesn’t know exactly when he dozed off, only that his neck is stiff and his glasses are askew. He jerks upright, trying to peer past the Healer’s shoulder at the frosted glass of the doors separating him from the operating room.
The lawyer nods in quiet confirmation. The movement startles his milk snake from its slumber, and the creature winds its way down from Acquafredda’s collar and into his shirt pocket.
‘Always taking care of me,’ Narcissa says to the wall, and Harry wants to throw himself out the window.
He peels away from Harry’s side and leans back on his elbows into the short grass. There will be grass stains on his crisp white shirt later, and he’ll be sure to complain in the morning, but he’s probably too drunk to care.
Harry frowns at the Auror’s neat, slanting script. He checks the address again, noticing that it’s been owled from a private address. It’s unusual for an Auror of this seniority not to go through the correct channels. Maybe it’s nothing, but something tugs at the base of Harry’s spine.
Blaise shifts his weight slightly and glances around the room, his eyes lingering on Ginny. His gaze lands on Draco, and whatever he sees there makes all his hesitation evaporate. ‘Oh,’ he sighs, ‘to hell with it. The DMLE reached out to the Department of Mysteries, since Potter’s technically under our office. They’re offering a deal.’
So many feelings!
Draco’s fingertips trace in soothing circles at the nape of Harry’s neck, over the rough lines of old scars. ‘Harry,’ he whispers. ‘I’ve got you. You’re safe. I have you. I have you.’
They look real in that picture. Two fathers and their young son, wearing paper hats and laughing at the camera as confetti explodes from the pink birthday cake placed in front of them.
Harry feels something snap inside of him like a bone breaking.
‘Oh, for fuck’s sake-’ Blaise growls, and wanders out of view before reappearing in a very nice-looking dressing gown. He’s not wearing his cosmetic charms today, and there’s a thin line of stubble ghosting over his chin. ‘What if I’d had someone over?’
‘It’s just,’ Ginny sighs, ‘surely you’ve done enough for everyone. You can just be happy now.’
Harry stands up quickly, heavy volume clasped in his hands. ‘Oh, hell, I’m so sorry,’ he says, feeling a hot band of redness begin to spread over the back of his neck and the tips of his ears. ‘I completely lost track of time.’
The blood is near impossible to scrub out, but the hot water feels like salvation. The Anchors pull up over him, and it’s almost like Draco is near. He closes his eyes and suddenly he can feel the ghost of Draco’s fingertips on his face, his sweetwater magic swimming in Harry’s veins. Harry leans forward against the tiles and tries to remember how not to collapse beneath the weight of it all, but the world is a heavy, awful place and he is buried beneath the shock and the grief and the long, abysmal years of his life that will yawn before him if he is without Draco’s light.
Harry begins to cast, dropping down within the burning maelstrom of his magic. His hand moves in the practiced motions as he builds a river between his core and the lock-picking spell. Magic pours greedily down his arm, seeking out the Lopez Panic Room’s enchantment like mercury running towards magnets. George’s creation is
According to Draco, they can’t stay upstairs avoiding their teenage nephew/godson/adoptive son forever, so Harry drags himself out of bed. He has a brief, very professional meltdown as he gets dressed and then they both head downstairs for breakfast.
was the one who blew up Diagon Alley.
‘Alright,’ the Healer says, after a beat. ‘It looks like we’ll be able to release you tomorrow - but we’d like you to come back for a check-up every week to monitor your recovery, if that’s alright. I understand your place of residence is in Belgium, is that correct?’
‘Yeah,’ Harry grins.
‘Whatever,’ she says, rolling her eyes. She points at the phone in Harry’s palm. ‘On the wotsit. Tell Draco there’s plenty of food left for him if he wants to escape the Slytherins or Soho.’
Neville turns his face slightly, lifting his hand as though to yawn, and mouths
As with every time they order takeout, he plates each carton of food with great care. He likes the ritual of eating together at the table with proper cutlery and plates and bowls. Draco once asked him why he likes it so much, and the answer made his heart hurt.
McGonagall summons the scroll with a flick of her wand. She unrolls the paper slowly, peering through her spectacles at the document. ‘Technically, gentlemen,’ she says, her voice crisp with displeasure, ‘this document is incorrect. You have a warrant here for a Mr. Harry James Potter, but the correct prefix is
They both turn to stare at him.
time,’ Harry says exasperatedly.
There is a noise in the hallway beyond the kitchen - a scuffling of slippered feet against the rug - and Teddy wanders into the light. His hair is rumpled, dyed an odd shade of purple, and there are pillow-creases on his face. He looks so young, so lost and confused that it makes Draco’s heart ache like an old injury.
, and that’s rather the end of the whole long-distance thing, it seems.
‘What?’ snaps Smythe, on his feet and free of the tripping hex. ‘Do you think you could do our job better than us?’
you’re the Chosen One. It makes me glad that You-Know-Who didn’t pick me that night.’ He shrugs. ‘Maybe that makes me a bit of a twat too.’
Harry knows she’s never been a fan of his sleeping around, and really, he never feels anything for his partners anyways, not the way he feels about Draco. But he’s trying to move on as best as he can, and with his nights as long and sleepless as they are, he needs to fill them with
. Ginny treads on her own dress halfway through the vows and falls into her bridesmaids, losing the bouquet and ripping her dress all the way up to her waist. Neville nearly cries, he’s laughing so hard. He ends up dropping the rings and Hermione has to Summon them back from the mud again.
Hermione tries to get up from her seat but is halted by her husband’s broad hands on her shoulders. ‘Can we do anything?’ she asks anyways. ‘How can we help?’
(it’s a sparrow and it sits at the very base of his spine, flying up from the waistband of his pants, and Draco
Harry manages a smile, and he takes another gulp of his tea. Pansy takes a macaron and shoves it in her mouth.
‘Yes,’ Draco replies, each of his words pronounced with great care, ‘but I thought that was just the result of unresolved sexual tension.’
Neville just laughs good-naturedly, waving at the both of them as he leaves.
given you Power of Attorney in the case that he is unaccounted for forty-eight hours. As such, all ledgers are now available for your inspection.’
Malfoy’s hand is shaking as he takes the chocolate bar from Harry. He can barely rip the foil packet open. He drops it a few times, cursing under his breath, blotches of red appearing at his pale cheeks. Locks of limp, wet hair fall into his face. He looks ghastly.
Dessert plates get taken away and piled in the sink, and Arthur brings out his good whiskey. Draco excuses himself to go outside for a cigarette, and after a moment, Harry extracts himself from the dining room to follow him out. He loves the Weasleys to death, but they drink nearly as much as Pansy does, and Harry’s been very good at limiting his alcohol consumption these past few years. He has no intention of changing that tonight.
Astoria is a resplendent figure in crimson, a sliver of magnificent sunset next to her tall, quiet groom. She is so full of life and so different from the haunted, sickly girl of her youth. Harry can never quite get used to how different she is from Daphne - small-boned, dark-haired, with a face that belongs in angelic murals and dark, wide eyes. She welcomes each of her guests at the door with a hug and a kiss, handing them oranges and pressing flowers into their lapels.
‘Right,’ laughs Ginny. ‘That’s my cue to fuck off.’
Once Ron clears everyone to go back on the roller coasters, Hugo decides that, actually, he’s done with the rides, thank you very much, and would prefer to go see the botanical gardens. They agree to split up and meet by the gates at closing. Teddy and Victoire take charge of Rose, heading back into the park to use up their fast passes, while Ron takes Hugo off to the botanical garden, leaving Harry and Draco a few hours of peace.
It’s an old echo of an argument they used to have, on Christmas break and on long weekends, and Harry sitting at a desk or kitchen table slaving away until the wee hours of the morning. It feels strange to be tracing these steps again, to fall into this familiar dance, but life is cyclical that way, isn’t it?
He doesn’t have to fight anymore. He doesn’t have to die for anyone, anymore.
There is a light squeak as Draco turns off the tap. He turns his head slightly, his lip brushing against Harry’s forehead. ‘Tell me about your day, Harry,’ he says, light and teasing like it’s an old inside joke.
‘Aliens are climbing out of a little girl’s mouth, or something,’ Potter says, and then winces. ‘Actually, I’m not even sure what the plot is anymore.’
Draco melts back into Harry intuitively, sliding their hands together. He lets out a short exhale, and some of the tension eases out of his shoulders - but not enough. He’s been up since dawn, staring unseeingly out the window, his fingers rubbing over the Mark absently. Harry knows the ugly thing still hurts him - that it
‘Who is it?’ calls a muffled voice from within.
More pages turn.
‘Mum, Dad, Ron - everyone told me I was being cruel,’ Ginny says, ploughing on relentlessly. ‘You were going through absolute hell and I couldn’t find the capacity to be there for you. So I left you. And that’s on me.’
Draco huffs a sigh, picks the
Harry cups Draco’s face, guiding his trailing gaze back up to meet Harry’s eyes. ‘Don’t set yourself aflame,’ he says, a little bit teasing and a little bit solemn. ‘You promised.’
, and he’s never wanted anything more than he wants this forever, this beautiful quiet tea-in-the-morning, sunshine-through-drawn-curtains forever, and he is so full of light and love that he might burn into cinders and fly up through the chimney.
The Unspeakable pulls his wand from the hidden sheath in the sleeve of his shirt. He gives Harry a small nod.
Harry’s brain screams - and he bites the thin line of his lip, ‘but I don’t think you should. Don’t lay a feast out for me tonight, not when I’m feeling so remarkably greedy.’
, with his
Harry helps prop Draco up on the pillows, bracing his neck. Draco smiles at him, brushing his fingertips on the inside of Harry’s wrist just as Harry begins to pull away. An ember warmth spreads through Harry from the space where Draco touches him, and his heart hammers away in his chest as he sits back down. There was something, something new in the way Draco moves around him now, like the world had already shifted in their sleep.
‘He’s got a life sentence,’ Harry says gravely. ‘Lucius Malfoy will die in Azkaban, just as he deserves.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Good,’ says Draco, and kisses his cheek.
As soon as the last person is out the door, Draco’s knees give out. He slumps against the counter, his eyes full of unshed tears.
‘I don’t see why I have to explain anything to you,’ Malfoy retorts.
you part Veela?’
Draco kneels on the floor in front of Harry’s bed, holding the holly wand in his hands as tightly as though it were the remains of his shattered heart. Milky blue light spills in through the curtains as dawn approaches. The windows are open, and a chill lingers in Harry’s bedroom. The bed has not been slept in, and Draco does not dare to look up at it, hateful of Harry’s absence.
, like he’s a toddler having a bit of a wobbly.
I don’t know why I’ve decided that grown-up Harry’s response to emotional meltdowns is to make tea, but that’s what my friends used to do all the time when I was sitting in the living room having a stress-meltdown.
Harry swaps over to typing with one hand, jabbing his finger in what he thinks is the general direction of Neville’s smug mug. ‘Peach fucking Bellinis, Nev.’
Harry makes a soft noise - a sighing
(In a dingy alleyway, his heart full of young, reckless love, Draco once made a promise to Harry. The words burn in his throat, a brand pressed into his soul with a red-hot poker.
‘There aren’t any almonds,’ Neville tells her with a friendly smile. ‘You’re safe.’
From the living room, Blaise’s voice begins to rise in timbre and volume, clearly rising to the bait.
A strange expression grows behind Blaise’s carefully maintained mask. ‘You’re a feral creature when you’re in love,’ he says, and he almost sounds impressed.
They haven’t really managed to make it off the rug in front of his fireplace. Harry’s been drinking since he managed to stop crying. He Summoned the bottle over earlier with a wordless, wandless spell that made Draco’s eyebrows climb his face. Harry doesn’t like to do wandless magic in front of people, but saying the words, waving the wand - it stings, like a rubber band being snapped against his knuckles, and he’s feeling a little rawer than most days.
Harry stares at the half-eaten Wispa in his hand as though it might give him some sort of revelation. He can feel his brain struggling against the heavy weight of fatigue. His face feels mildly fuzzy. His fingertips have a tingling in them that makes Harry worry he’s given himself temporary nerve damage from overwork. He wants nothing more than to crawl into bed and pass out - but he’s got three hours left on duty, and they’re nowhere closer to catching the orphanage bombers than they were last month. Or the month before.
‘I want you,’ says Draco. ‘Today, tomorrow. Always.’
His eyes are like starlight when he looks up at Harry.
, prodded along by Pansy’s clever questions -
,’ Michelle continues, flicking a manicured hand outward in disgust. ‘Instead they come and raid the shop, looking for evidence of Dark Magic. They ask questions and say Draco has been brewing illegal potions. My Draco? Pah! It is outrageous,’ she declares. ‘I cannot take this - I will protest.’
Hermione looks thoughtful for a moment, then angry, and then her jaw hardens with determination. ‘Nobody’s bothered to charge Lucius with the kidnapping and attempted murder,’ she says. ‘So that’s not part of the plea deal. He can be charged with that and we can put him away - for good.’
Harry snorts into his pumpkin juice.
Harry shakes his head again, laughter bubbling at his lips. He can feel himself slipping into Draco’s gravitational pull - the weight shifting in his feet as he prepares to fall into orbit. Draco’s smile takes on a playful edge, and before Harry knows to react, he yanks Harry with enough force to send him careening forwards into Draco - but Draco catches him with a firm hand to his waist.
Harry knows he should be thankful, but instead he feels nauseous about the whole thing. When he confesses this to Draco, burning with guilt and shame, Draco just nods solemnly.
Draco is still watching Luna herd Hermione into the dining room, so he does not notice Daphne approaching him until she’s enveloped him in a tight hug. She is as warm as sunshine -
Harry pushes his glasses back on and nudges Malfoy lightly with his elbow. ‘Not for me,’ he grins.  ‘For you.’
She pulls out her wand and flicks it at the mess around Harry’s room. The papers stack themselves neatly and fly over to the counter, settling in neat piles beside the complimentary tea-and-coffee set. The filing cabinet makes a soft popping sound as it grows tiny little clawed feet, and it scurries over after the files before hunkering down.
Harry wanders around, waving his wand and placing charms to prevent the tent from burning to the ground or the champagne tower from collapsing and taking an eye out. Once he’s sure nothing’s about to explode or burst into flames, he quietly slips away from the party and heads out to the back of the yard. He finds a nice spot to sit in the grass, away from the tent, and looks up at the stars.
‘Blaise works with modified spells and unusual magical cores - you
He knows for a fact that no one’s bothered to actually ask what Draco gets up to, otherwise they would already know that their supposed dangerous Death Eater is actually a man who makes bottled remedies for daily woes, volunteers at a Muggle cat shelter, and visits his ageing mother on the weekend.
Blaise waves his wand at his face, dropping the cosmetic charms and revealing his handsome features. ‘Didn’t mean to insult, Professor,’ he grins, flashing very white teeth. He jerks his head towards the door. ‘
Ron nudges Harry’s foot with his toe, prompting him to look up. Ron hands Harry his cup of tea (Harry has no recollection of him making it) and sits down next to him.
you doing here?’
The double doors to the ballroom burst open with a loud bang. Several witches and wizards come storming through, dressed in leathers in boots, wands at the ready as though preparing for battle against an army. A few guests scream as they hurry out of the way. The music screeches to a halt, members of the quartet rising out of their seat, instruments held awkwardly in their hands as they watch the Aurors advance.
,’ Draco finishes for him. He leans into Harry, his hand sliding gently from Harry’s waist to the small of his back. ‘I remember. We watched it at the Odeon. I was horribly in love with you, even then. I tried to convince myself I could wait it out, like a bad cold, if I kept my distance. But instead I only fell deeper in love with you.’
She’s got a strange expression on her face that’s part sympathy and part frustration. Harry looks away. He’s seen that same look on Luna’s face before, on the one occasion they talked about Harry’s feelings about Draco.
‘The year is 1995,’ Draco continues, ‘and by now everyone knows Lord Voldemort has returned. Even if you don’t believe the Boy Who Lived, the great Albus Dumbledore has confirmed it. Beloved Cedric Diggory, Triwizard Tournament champion, is dead, and at the hands of a Death Eater, no less. Lucius Malfoy makes another enormous payment to Selwyn Thestral Stables. A week later, the Ministry sends Dolores Umbridge to terrorise Hogwarts in a long crusade that ends in an attempted arrest of Professor Dumbledore.’
- not that chips and curry count as fusion cuisine.
He finishes the countercurse, sealing up that awful wound at last, but the blood won’t return to Draco’s body. Instead it spreads outwards, reaching dark tendrils over Narcissa’s rug, out across the tiled floors of the Panic Room.
Three is a blessed number everywhere, it seems. Three times, Astoria and Stephen bow before they drink clear liquor from tiny porcelain cups. Three times, the binding knot is tied around their clasped hands, as the spell takes and they are sealed together as husband and wife. Three times, Astoria presses kisses to Stephen’s knuckles, and three times, she wipes the tears from his face and whispers to him:
‘Of course we are,’ says the Unspeakable, flashing Harry a conspiratorial smile. ‘Seven o’clock, Professor. We’ll be waiting.’
Harry realises he’s never actually witnessed Blaise angry before. Frustrated, yes. Perhaps even worried. But never angry - and certainly never angry on Harry’s behalf.

Draco manages to compose himself by the time Astoria releases him. He adjusts his shirt and waistcoat, drawing himself up to his full height as he turns his attention towards the binder Stephen has set upon the desk.
Malfoy presses his fist against Harry’s chest. ‘You’ve got to stop this,’ he hisses. He pulls out his wand and presses it to his own neck. ‘I’ll make it look like you attacked me. Overpowered me.’ Malfoy takes a deep, shaky breath. ‘You can still make it out of here alive.’
