That sounded alright to Harry, “Um, that’s great, but he said you signed for us. Molly Weasley, well she had some papers.”
Draco titled his head, Harry re-straightened it, it messed with his braid.
He nodded and allowed himself to be pulled away.
Judge Fumeurs glared with obvious annoyance, “one of you, approach the bench, and this had better be good.”
“My Harry.”
Harry glared, “Draco, don’t. I don’t believe you deserve their hate. I need you to understand, I
Hermione pulled her wand, “maybe less, if we work together.”
Ron’s hand rested on her shoulder, “what was in the soup Pansy?”
Ben whispered, “shite,” and leaned forward in his seat. “And you cast it?”
Draco arched his back, before taking Harry’s hand and allowed himself to be pulled up. He stretched, “Potter, I think,”
“Tawy, I think something’s wrong with our boy here.”
“I think we’re all a little guilty of that.” Another answered, while several voices made agreeing sounds, “Now, looking back, I shudder at the idea of a child being in that house of insanity. Think of the things that poor child had to see. Someone should have removed him.”
They ran into something Draco couldn’t identify and began trying to figure it out. They worked so well together. It was amazing what they could accomplish when out from under the expectations placed upon them. Perhaps Draco and Harry could reach their true potential if left unhampered by what was left of the adults who had enslaved them to their ideals.
Then Harry’s view was blocked by Molly, who stopped in front of them. “Come along then,” she waved a parchment, “we’ve been called to the Judge’s chambers.”
“Draco nothing you say to me could hurt them. I’m bound by the Ministry, the Minister, the privacy act, and my own conscious to hold whatever you tell me to myself. What you say to me goes no further than you and me, unless
“And this is Sirius Lupin, my step-grandson from my son-in-law’s first marriage.” Jeannie looked to the other boy and realized Severus had brought his only real competition for the girls with him. Sirius was stunning. He had light brown hair styled into a relaxed mess, sunglasses perched among the strands and his large jade eyes were amazing. The senior boys were going to hate her for letting these two through the doors. She glanced down to the baby carriage and saw Ms. Black’s youngest charge fast asleep, as she looked up to address Sirius’ greeting, she noticed the boy’s intertwined fingers and grinned.
Neville snorted as he hugged Harry tightly. “Rather like we were the first out and threw up a locking charm behind us. Ginny will put me on the couch for a week.”
Mandy shrugged. “Harry’s the white knight, who died and was reborn twice to save us all and defeated the manic.”
Harry wondered if that was going to work, but didn’t say it wouldn’t.
Rey nodded his head, raising his eyebrows and pointed with his eyes.
Charlie, feeling properly chastened, quickly agreed and wondered when his youngest brother had grown so much. Then swallowed thickly when Ron turned haunted eyes his way, “Yeah, I hear ya Ron. I won’t say a word.”
Tawy noticed a difference between the boys after their return. As long as she’d known them, they’d been rather attached to each other, together but separate. Now however there was nothing separate about them. Whenever she looked for them, she found them with their heads bent together, whispering any number of things, fingers near always intertwined.
Draco wasn’t too sure about the cab, but Violet spoke to them about where she worked and invited them along. Which stopped Draco from focusing on the thought of the cab crashing into something. Then Harry began pointing things out and explaining them. Draco got into the spirit of it and started pointing out things that he wasn’t sure about.
“Yeah.” Harry smiled back, but then Draco moved his leg away and he frowned until Draco moved it back. He pressed back and felt better as Draco moved closer and not away. Ella frowned as she looked between them, but Harry couldn’t give a damn less.
Tawy scowled. “Really? The wands that dueled Voldemort and belonging to those two. Couldn’t keep them safe there. We can discuss this later. Wands. Now.”
Tawy waited as Molly, still red-faced and tight-lipped brought Ron and Hermione back into the room. Molly murmured softly to them and neither looked happy about what she was saying. Tawy could surmise Molly had put off their questions until later. Probably a good idea as she figured Harry’s young friends might not see the wisdom of what had been done. She approached slowly and cast her privacy bubble.
It was like Harry’s love lit up exactly how much ugliness there was inside him. How much of himself he’d shoved down and wrapped in rejection and pain, so he could give his parents the child they wanted. Draco hated himself for giving them so much and he hated them for taking it. He glanced down to the symbol of his devotion to his parents. The dark mark on his arm that would forever remind him of how much of himself he let them have.
She shrugged, “I’m sure I don’t know, but mother says it was quick.”
She leaned in close, brushing a kiss over his cheek, he held her tightly. “Cissy,”
Seamus swallowed thickly and rubbed a hand over his mouth as he mumbled, “Oh my god.”
“Maybe not,” Harry answered stubbornly.
The woman entered and one look was all Jeannie needed to know that the old-old Euro-money was no false rumor. They didn’t prescribe to the old fashioned robes here in Canada, everyone having long ago adapted to muggle clothes. So it stood to reason that, though genteel and graceful, the woman seemed a touch awkward in her designer suit. She was beautiful and her red hair was styled into a lovely French twist. Jeannie would have called it a cold beauty if not for her warm smile.
Draco knew someone was coming down the walkway, simply due to the pickup in noise, but since neither of his parents reacted, he didn’t either. He didn’t know what to think when a Healer in light blue robes, sandwiched between the two Aurors from earlier, stopped outside their cell. The Healer was a middle-aged woman in her mid-seventies with grey streaking her light brown hair. She was stout, perhaps slightly taller than him, and looked to be a no-nonsense type of woman. The disgusted look on the Healer’s face when she looked at his mother made Draco blister with righteous anger.
Draco looked over his shoulder, “come on, with how I look…”
Harry bit his lip, “I think Voldemort was just using him to hurt his parents. So they must have cared, right?”
Belinda closed her eyes for a moment, casing her memory, trying to grab…she’d seen this before, she paused and slowly opened her eyes, “If you’d asked me a year ago, I could have told you nothing of this sigil. Except that it was featured in some history books and that no one living had this mark, however this summer I categorized this very sigil.”
“They said they needed to destroy something.” Mandy replied and quickly added. “Malfoy said the wandless they knew was nasty and to get their wands.”
Fumeurs raised a hand. “They should have never put you in circumstances where the only way to keep you safe was to lock you away. Parents are irresponsible when they bring their child into a house of insanity and those people were insane.”
Bill leaned back in his chair with a casual wave towards Draco’s shirt, “So Draco, a fan of Queen?” He thought the shirt was likely Harry’s. Bill was just trying to find a peaceful topic to keep Ron from feeling like he had to protect the kid from them. He wanted him to feel welcome, victim kicking was not something he did. Bill didn’t expect for Draco to not only know the band, but know enough to have a favorite song and discuss it. He found himself leaning forward and talking about other muggle bands, some Hermione hadn’t even heard of. As they were talking, Bill found himself looking for a quill to write down some of the bands Draco recommended, “Velvet Underground and the Ramones?” Bill questioned as he searched around the coffee table for a quill.
“That last spell. Potter, it was illegal. I used an illegal spell.”
Their lead solicitor Isaacs, a pit bull of a man in designer robes with more pull than most, stood and gave Lucius a strong look before he turned his attention to the Healer, “To what do we owe this pleasure Madam Healer? I was unaware anyone was ill.”
Harry shrugged. “We surprised her in France. We knew she’d keep her word.”
Hermione shared a glance with Ron, who looked pleased as punch as he smiled at her. She knew he was thrilled to just get to eat. They wait patiently while Harry had a few words with the elder Bones and by the end of it all three of them had not only gotten a free lunch but a table in the corner as well. Harry opened his sandwich with a grin, “that was nice of him. I’m glad Susan is doing so well.”
He returned the gesture, a break in etiquette which, without a word, told her that, while he appreciated her use of the title, he wouldn’t be using it, taking it further he said, “Draco, if it pleases you, Ms. Weasley.”
Draco rolled his eyes and scowled. “Cause the last one went over so well.”
Draco handed her the paperwork, “mine has a request for my muggle card credit. They should send it along. Just in case I find shopping enjoyable.”
“He’s never had soda before?” Ella asked.
The Judge nodded gravely, “The archived memories. He has not been questioned further.”
“I couldn’t agree more.” Mandy answered, before turning towards the rest of the kids, “hey we still have some time. Let’s go waste it on the other side of the room. Where they’ll ignore all the fun stuff we can think of.” The other kids took off after her and Draco scowled at their backs as the adults moved closer.
Murphy shook his head with a grin. “Ben you took my thunder. I was going to announce Friday will be our next wand day. Remember, wand day is only for those who have earned it with good behavior and for those who showed good choices last wand day. You must also have parental permission on file or, for those in the Ministry program, the permission of their Care-witch/wizard on file. The meeting will be scheduled in your bands.”
“Harry and I don’t think I’d hurt you. Maybe the room though.”
“It has to do with un-nesting the strands of a spell. It took Dumbledore a year to drill it into me. I doubt I could teach anyone else.” Draco answered. They had promised to answer the questions, not that they would like the answers.
Draco took the joint, “Knock it off Potter. I like the soda.”
“So, what happened?” Murphy asked before she cleared the doorway.
“So?” Draco shrugged, but wouldn’t meet her eyes.
“Then we’ll leave that alone,” she replied. She slapped her knees, “if there’s nothing else you want to discuss right now, we’ll get your wands?” They quickly agreed.
Andromeda straightened, she leaned down over the pictures, “they did this,” she glanced at Tawy between beholding the pictures, “to each other.”
“I’ll heal you after I kick your ass,” Harry beamed.
Harry snorted with a chuckle, “Pens, markers, a couple of pencils, if it writes and it’s muggle, Draco’s got one.”
Draco yanked his head up just as Tawy snapped, “Helen! Enough,” she unwrapped a loose shirt and matching pants, “I know these are nowhere near what you’re used to, but they help magnify our diagnostic spells, so I’ll ask you to put them on, alright?”
Rey jerked and looked to see Draco studying him, like the blond did before he got annoyed, his hand out.
Next to him, Draco groaned, muttering, “Really?”
“Lucius-Lucius!”
“Well we’re not all trampling out there. They’ll do aheader.” Ginny looked around, “Hermione?”
Ron scowled as Hermione threw her coat over the back of her chair, “Oh Ron, it’s not nearly that bad. I had warned you.”
She hadn’t taken pity on him, she was just winding him up, “Who?”
“Mr. Potter,” Headmistress McGonagall stood and called to him, shock in her voice.
Harry nodded. “Yeah, of course we’ll go. When?”
Draco reached up and touched where they rested, having forgotten they were there. He glanced towards Harry and took them off, looking at them, “sunglasses.”
The girl measured them for a moment, “I suppose not.”
Draco didn’t want to make an excuse and jump away. Harry’s touch didn’t make him flinch. He knew if he didn’t say something Harry might leave and right now, he actually wanted someone to stay. “Have you ever done that to a privacy shield before? Like we did today?”
“Hmm?” Draco opened an eye, “Oh yeah, we destroyed it. I mostly blame you.”
Draco shrugged. “Been without it more than I’ve had it recently. Do alright without it.”
Both boys stopped, panting, several paces from the other.
She grabbed his wrist, “we could’ve been brilliant together Harry.”
“No, I haven’t, we’re going to see how this goes.”
“So Teddy got something to tell us?” Siri asked him shortly after they’d finished the cake and ice cream.
“Maybe they’ll duel. So badass,” Ben announced, “think about it. We’ll have front row seats to watch the most powerful wizards in generations.”
Draco paused and glanced over. He grinned and grabbed Harry, quickly moving their way. “Pansy!” He threw his arms around the girl, hugging her tightly. The hugs and greetings took a good five minutes. When they were finally ready to sit down, Mandy excused herself. Blaise, wand up his sleeve, cast a peace and quiet charm over the table and chairs.
“I imagine so.”
“We could ask, she might for a good cause,” Clara offered, but it was hesitant.
Draco shrugged, “don’t know.”
Jeannie looked to the boy with the dark blonde hair and silver eyes. She could already see the girls going absolutely out of their minds, the boy was gorgeous. He had also adapted better than his mother to the muggle styles, already wearing designer casual with an easy air.
Tawy nodded. “Thank you.” She looked between them. “I think you’ll find you’ve made the right choice. I’m going to ask you both to step into another room, while we finish up here and then we can go.”
She had to lean in to hear him, “yes, it is.” He seemed almost drunk with sleepiness, blinking and swaying, “Draco, did you know you had a hard time waking up after dreamless sleep potions?” He nodded, “why didn’t you say anything?”
Draco scoffed.
Ben paled, “Yeah. Ok, I’ll tell her.” He took off across the room.
Behind her something crashed. She thought quickly, hoping to put off any real physical damage. “Let me ask a question, if someone loves you for what they want you to be, do they really love you?”
Draco huffed even as he shifted for Harry to sit next to him again. “They’re fantastic. No ink pot, inks right inside, it’s brilliant. You can just carry them around with you and not worry about them breaking as much.”
“If we’re hiding, this is a shite place Potter.”
“What are those?” Lucius, aware of Narcissa’s difficulty and his part in it, attempted to give her a moment to compose herself by drawing attention from her. He gestured towards the sunglasses on his son’s head.
“His parents wear it.”
Rey raised his hands. “I got nothing.”
The woman smiled, “Thank you. Now after you finish, just tap the tray three times and it’ll disappear. Then off to bed. You’ve both have group at 10AM. I’m sure you’ll enjoy meeting some of the others.” She left without waiting for them to reply.
Zacharias looked down the table, as did everyone else.
Draco took it in, half-admiring and half-disgusted, “Huh, muggles.”
Mandy snorted. “Give it up slut.”
He looked her way and whatever was on his face pushed her back into her seat.
Harry shrugged. “If not, we sneak out.”
Draco’s eyes widened, blood magic. He’d never seen blood magic performed and watched every stroke, memorized every word. He knew blood magic was more about feelings and desires than actual words, but he committed the whole thing to memory all the same.
“You sure you don’t mind keep an eye out?” Harry asked again, as he stood next to the table, looking down at her even as Draco tried to lead him away.
“Then come with me.” Harry held out his hand. Draco looked down at his hand for the longest moment of Harry’s life, completely aware of what he was offering. Finally Draco took his hand and Harry clutched it tightly.
Harry agreed. If they had to find something else, they would. They weren’t exactly sure what the blood ritual did, it was risky, but in Harry’s mind it was far riskier to return to Hogwarts without it. Something that let him know Draco was in danger was worth anything else that might happen.
“Not happening.” Harry stood at the same time as Malfoy, who turned to look at the shield as Harry faced the Healer.
He smiled at her and she mentally upped the number of hexes girls were going to cast to get this one’s attention.
“Put them on.” Lucius asked, it wasn’t a demand, but it was close.
“Sit down and listen to me, because I’m not releasing the doors until I’ve had my say.” He crossed his arms.
Judge Fumeurs didn’t look Draco’s way as he continued, “The matter of His Grace’s guardianship will be resolved in closed quarters, where I will precede accordingly.” The Judge closed the court, this time paying no heed to the clamoring and talking that went on.
Draco shrugged. Harry sighed. “Yeah, okay.”
Draco opened his eyes and looked across his pillow. He knew the markings. His fingers remembered every turn. It was dark beneath the blanket but there was enough light for Draco to make out the green shine of Harry’s eyes, “yes.”
“I don’t know what it’s called. You’re supposed to move parts of the bigger cube so the little blocks of colour match on each side.”
“What?” Mandy shook her head. “No.”
Harry nodded slightly confused, “Yeah.” Several of the group whispered between themselves and Harry thought they sounded too shocked. What did they think happened in a war?
The Judge took no notice and continued. “Child endangerment, unlawful imprisonment of the same, use of unforgivables on a child,” Fumeurs didn’t pause as the court burst into whispers, “neglect,”
Draco blushed but moved closer to him, “So do you Harry.”
“We’re not going back to that 2
“Never truer words Poppy,” McGonagall agreed, “something you might say to any other student with little reaction could have you scrambling to figure out how to put the fire out with either one of them. And with boys that powerful, well we were always very glad to have Albus about.” She finished with a sad sigh, “I’m rather glad they’re nearly grown now. I don’t know if I could keep up with them.”
Mandy remembered what they’d done to the privacy shield with nothing but their hands. She went back through the magazine, stopping on the article she’d been looking for. “According to Rita they’re the strongest wizards in modern history.”
Harry pointed them out and Hermione appreciated not having to run after them. As they approached she couldn’t help but study them, it was amazing. 11 years had done Neville nothing but good and she herself wasn’t half bad for being a mother of two, but this. It was like they hadn’t aged a day, like they’d just run from the hall. She yearned to ask, but didn’t dare. She’d never hear the end of it if she badgered them with questions and so had already told herself not to ask any. It was enough that Harry was here, alive and healthy. “Harry,” She smiled and reached out with her arms, which thankfully didn’t remain empty. She hugged him tightly.
“We don’t have much time before we leave.”
“Oh Merlin,” Hermione covered her mouth.
Harry rolled his eyes. He’d near about given up on getting Draco to say his first name. Though he no longer said ‘Potter’ like a curse. Harry didn’t know anyone who said Potter like Draco did. Harry looked up to see Draco eating yogurt and grinned back, “It’s strawberry yogurt, Draco.” Harry however really relished using Draco’s first name.
Lunch was fancy and slightly weird, but it was delicious, and Harry decided Draco was going to be in charge of their food and shoes from here on out.
“I’m sure. You two are blinking and I’m not. I’m not going to get stopped, you are and if you’re caught with that when we’re with you, I’m sure, give.”
Draco shook his head. “Healer Tawy gave me the cure. It cuts the connection and if she gave it me, she surely gave it to you.”
Healer Kelly shook her head, “no matter how rudely she said it, Mandy is right. You should stay. Just try today.”
There were no real serious charges leveled against Narcissa, and since she was never marked as a death eater there were no memory archives taken. So, she, as a
The paper sat ignored on Tawy’s desk, her head in her fireplace. “And how exactly did it get out? Of course, I’ll have to tell them, kids get the news in here and if I don’t, a kid or a member of staff will. This is a monumental fuck up and I know you say you’ll find the culprit, but you also have to deal with the fallout Minister.”
Harry turned. Draco was wearing the identical thing but all in black. He’d only buttoned three of the middle buttons and the sleeves were rolled to his elbow. He looked, “You look bloody fantastic.”
Draco took another drag just to spite him, but then offered it. Harry took the joint with one hand, grabbed Draco’s wrist with the other and pulled until Draco consented to sharing the beanbag with him. “This thing won’t blow up or anything?”
Their emergence into each other was codependent and perhaps not the best coping mechanism. However, the relationship was healing, a codependence of building each up and shoring the other rather than amassing depression. She thought to let them love freely and without boundaries because they had never known love like it and love truly did heal. She planned to give them time to help heal the other before helping them to see they could stand alone when they needed to and not just with the balance of the other.
Harry shook his head and looked to Teddy with a wiry smile. “So is it too late to ask how you feel about local schools?”
Harry tilted his head, he was no artist, unlike Draco, but there was a lot of green already on his very Gryffindor leg already. “Red.”
Harry couldn’t look away, ready to hand over the other can.
Draco looked at Harry and nodded, nearly overwhelmed that someone else understood so well.
“So, you’re ok with us?”
Harry wasn’t exactly sure what had happened.
Harry grinned and let Draco lead him away.
“I’m in a t-shirt,” Harry offered. He glanced to Draco, “if they don’t let us in. We’ll just find somewhere else.”
But Draco shook his head, pale and frightened. “I didn’t mean to Potter. It was just there and I,”
“There are two more. There was just a slight confusion about what was acceptable to a muggle club.” Hermione looked pained.
Harry took a hit and passed it to Draco. He hoped they realized they were not handing it back.
Teddy nodded. “You’re the only person with that tat that isn’t wanted, dead, or in Azkaban. They don’t give a shit about Voldemort, they’re supporting you.”
“I’m so glad we’re the same size.”
Violet gasped while Harry grinned at Mandy. “Thank you.”
Draco shrugged, “I’ve called him lots of things, one of them da, he answers to it too.” He smiled at their laughter.
Draco leaned in, “I hate it when they thank you for doing something they’re forcing you to do.”
“Surely she’d give it to them,” Ella announced slyly smiling, flouncing her hair, and looking them over.
“It wouldn’t be if
George stood as the door opened, overlooking the group as they spilled causally into the hallway. The core group of seventh years, soon to be eighth years. Every Hogwart’s child (under their year) owed their life to this group. As this was the group that had successfully fought off every attacker who’d tried to get into the common room where they’d put all the younger students.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, “I’ll be right back,” he felt Draco’s apprehension and flooded him with devotion and love, waiting until Draco nodded to even stand. He leaned back over to brush a kiss over his check and held his hand even as he gestured for Ginny to lead the way.
Harry thought Malfoy was going to yank away from the touch as he had all the previous one’s Harry had seen. Yet he didn’t, he tensed but didn’t move and then the tenseness passed too, and Malfoy still didn’t move, so Harry didn’t. He’d seen the way Draco had reacted to the mention of the cruciatus. Harry didn’t want to bring attention to it, but he didn’t want Malfoy to suffer either. He was done with that and he hoped Draco was too.
Sentez pulled Vos towards the door, he was eager to get started. There was nothing he liked better than kicking deserving arse. Vos shrugged his hand off at the door, “Tawy.”
His mother’s grip on his arm tightened to unpleasantness, “why?” She demanded as Lucius took the parchment from the solicitor.
“No, Harry, you’re really not.” Tawy smiled. “Keep writing in your journals. We’ll talk tomorrow. Night boys.”
“That didn’t sound like we’re leaving anytime soon.” Draco whispered, his ability to read between the lines had been fine-tuned in the last year.
She didn’t play stupid. “I am very practiced in the nature of applied healing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with either of you and no damage. Whoever made the specific healing potion was very talented.” Harry looked particularly saddened at the mention of the potion’s creator and Draco downright distraught. She guessed it was Master Snape and refrained from asking. She sighed softly. “You have to remember none of this is your fault.” She stood and tucked her chair away. “Perhaps we could stay out of that particular group, if I knew you were talking it out somewhere. Maybe you could try speaking to each other or even the notebooks.” She waited but neither boy said anything. They didn’t look particularly overwhelmed or upset but Harry was looking at Draco. She bid them goodnight and took their half-hearted replies.
She nodded. “Maybe not. If you would be amendable, I would like to speak with you both every day, starting next week?”
“Have fun. Alright?” She looked between them, “Noon tomorrow.”
Hermione grinned and raised an eyebrow at him even as Ron knocked his head against the table.
Harry felt it too, but it was a fleeting thought to the one that screamed gleefully. He sat back next to Draco and rested his head on his shoulder. Draco rested his against Harry’s. “I’ve never had someone that belonged to me before. I’m new to affection. You’ll have to tell me if it’s too much, or annoying or whatever, because I don’t know Draco, but I want to figure it out, with you.”
Harry kissed Draco’s temple, “Let’s just hope we can keep this quiet, huh?”
Mandy took her hand but quickly dropped it. “Yeah, I know who you are. Come on. Thought they’d be more of you.”
“I heard Tawy needed Malfoy and Potter’s wands.”
'Yeah, are you interested?'
"I get that, really. But how do you expect us to date when you've killed someone?" Harry yelled.
"Ehm, yeah." Harry cleared his throat "Sorry."
"...I don't know. There's no way for me to not do it."
Draco thought to himself. Was he interested? Making people better? Not just any people, but muggles. That basically went against everything he had been thought.
"Hi... How are you?" Harry said with a small smile.
"I'm heading towards the common room. You have fun with Potter, okay?" Pansy said with a wink.
“Well not if you say it like that.”
Ten minutes turned into fifteen, then twenty, then more. Until Harry really had to go.
And then here was Draco, looking at him, comforting him. Telling him something he had never heard before. He never realised how much he needed to hear this. He just needed to-
"I was scared. Because... It all became so real all of the sudden."
Before he could say anything more Draco was pulled away from him and he was blown backwards.
Luna stared at Harry, smiling at him.
Harry's eyes widened and his cheeks flushed. "Assertive... I like it."
"If I don't kill Dumbledore, he'll kill my parents. I told you." Draco said from his bed.
"Let me know if you change your mind." Harry said, staring at his hand on the doorknob. He turned it and left behind not just the room, but also Draco, staring at the ground, frozen.
While Harry was happy for the opportunity, he did wonder why Tawy had signed for them. He looked to Draco and saw the same question. He met Draco’s eyes and conveyed that they’d have to ask Tawy. Draco nodded and returned his attention to the group. They covered a few more topics, of which Harry could mostly ignore for the building excitement of having his wand if only for a couple hours. It seemed like he’d barely held it since affixing it.
Harry looked to Draco, who nodded with a wave of his hand, which Harry took to mean, might as well. “We accidently swapped wands when we were kids, first year. Didn’t get to swap them back for a day or two so I just used his and he used mine and it worked.”
Sure enough, she turned down the hallway, and there was Tawy, and probably every member of staff in the building, standing outside Malfoy and Potter’s door. Tawy had her back to the door, dismissing her staff with a stern frown, calling them out for their curiosity. Even as Mandy approached people were leaving or moving to the nurse’s station.
“Shut up,” she called back, still waving her empty hands at Harry. “Mistake? What are you talking about Harry, of course he’s allowed mistakes. Neither I nor anyone else is going to take him away from you. Harry, look at me, not them.” She caught his eyes and held them. “No one is going to take him anywhere. Draco’s fine and you’re fine and no one here is going to hurt either one of you, alright?”
Hermione put her hand over his, “Harry, it’s not your choice what happens to him.”
Murphy sighed down at his lunch. “They traumatized the other kids. They traumatized me. It took me an hour to calm them down. Potter and Malfoy cannot talk to regular kids.”
Hermione opened her month and he pointed to the bench. She sighed but humored him and Ron followed her lead, looking bewildered with the whole thing.
“There’s supposed to be one in England somewhere and no I don’t know what happened there, but one day I’m going to figure out what you know about it. I did however get all the holdings in Normandy, the Flemish Manor and the places in Greece and France.”
“Yes.”
Neville met his eyes and nodded, “Yeah, alright.”
“Yes, after you left,” Draco offered.
Still laughing, Violet set their drinks on a tray, “here you go luv. Let me know if you want more food, on the house.”
“To what do we owe the pleasure Madam,” Senior Judge Fumeurs treated her with all the respect a woman of her station and sacrifices deserved.
Rey mentioned a blood quill and that peeked Harry’s interest enough to turn his hand over. He pressed his leg into Malfoy’s not sure why or what he was looking for, but he felt better when Malfoy pressed back. Harry glanced over. Draco looked as bored as Harry felt.
Later he’d traced the new markings on his mother’s arm, she’d let him, but had never told him what they were from.
“Thank you for the consideration.”
“I wanted to leave, but they wouldn’t let me.”
Harry blinked with the hurt. She didn’t want him. She wasn’t going to stand up for him. Molly was going to let the Ministry take him away. He turned away from her, dismissing her hurt look, what did she have to be hurt about? He was the one being turned away.
“Nope.” He glanced frequently at Draco, who got the second soda and tried the crisps. “We’re not that all-powerful you know.”
Rey nearly fell off his seat. “You can’t be serious! That’s the last thing we should do. Who knows how they’d react to that. They could be dangerous.”
Tawy took a deep breath. She wasn’t sure what had set off the alarms, but neither boy was answering the door. She’d have to go in but she wasn’t going to do so with half the staff looking over her shoulder. She looked to Bear, thankful he’d been here, he nodded and took an arm folded stance before her, blocking both her and the door from view. She took another deep breath and released it slowly as the door opened beneath her hand.
“Yep,” Mandy grabbed another magazine and ended up pushing it away. Everything her sister had brought this time all covered the same thing. It was disgusting. She couldn’t imagine the whole world knowing. People were writing in and giving opinions on it, like their opinion mattered, like giving an opinion was okay.
“That’s a very kind offer. Thank you.” She wasn’t sure what exactly was making them so nervous so started with. “I’m not angry. That’s what the room is for. We are fully funded, repairs have already been made.” She sat on Harry’s bed. “I’m so proud of you both.”
Draco leaned down to grab the last bit of his papers when someone sent an incendio, burning the papers to ash before he could grab them. Draco growled and stood, “Fuck it, I’m done.” He threw down his bag and the room watched with bated breath as he stormed the doors and left the Great Hall.
Harry shook his head amused. Where had Draco learned about soda, but then he remembered Tawy offering it to him between potions. He chuckled quietly to himself, if Draco was excited about caffeine-free organic soda. Harry couldn’t wait to introduce him to the real stuff one day. He paused as he realized he wanted to be the one to do that, show Draco real soda. It was strange.
“Yeah,” Harry moved the two steps he needed to grab Draco’s hand.
Ella scowled. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen them an arms distance from the other.”
“Keep apologizing and they’ll think your formal apology, which they’ve accepted, was false.”
Ron and Hermione were quick to explain small spaces and restraint panicked Harry.
“Oh, merlin there’s red.” A girl ahead of Mandy called out.
Harry rolled his eyes. It was hard for him to believe other people couldn’t see what he did. Malfoy’s were entirely easy to read, once you got the hang of it.
Tawy raised an eyebrow, even as she did as she’d been asked. She appreciated the gesture even if Draco couldn’t.
should you have them?”
“Right.” Harry nodded. “So, you will?”
Harry glanced up and down to the end of the bed where Draco was drawing a, he looked closer, a damn fine dragon on his leg with markers, which showed a lot more creativity than the ‘property of H. Potter’ he’d written on Draco’s calf.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Hurt’s to want.”
Thank you for asking Nely.
It didn’t take him long to find what had broken Cissa’s heart and his rage was so complete it took him a whole minute for him to figure out what the first step should be. “It’s alright darling, please Cissa. I’ll call the barrister.”
Teddy did notice that every few seconds both Hermione and Neville would glance over as if to make sure Draco and Harry were still there.
Harry’s hand slid over his and Draco looked up. “I won’t leave you and if necessary, I’ll kick ass before I let them hurt you.”
years are going to have their own housing. Away from the other years and their houses. You won’t actually be members of a house any longer and your badges will reflect Hogwarts’ unity.”
Tawy leaned back, “I haven’t thought about that.” She paused thoughtfully, turning it over, “How about a tentative yes, to be later determined by how the year is going.”
“I know it.”
“But if it helps Draco and Harry?”
Mandy looked when Draco spoke, so did everyone else. She nodded and looked away, yes when he smiled, he was something else.
“Neville?”
He stood and heavily sank into his chair. He’d known the boy had taken after Narcissa, yet he’d foolishly carried on, as if he could turn such a child into a man like himself. He should have given Draco to Narcissa, instead of separating them and hoping distance would curb Draco's tendencies. Draco would have been much more efficient as his mother’s prodigy. Lucius picked up his port and stared into the crystal. Things would have gone differently for them all had he just realized. He’d just been so determined to have a successor that would wield the Malfoy name as he would. His ego and now they would all pay the price but especially Draco. He would not burden Narcissa with this. No this was his pain to carry alone and he would until his death and perhaps beyond that.
She listened for a few minutes before saying. “Minister, do you have any idea the amount of damage this could do, to them, to anyone else who is mentioned further down the line? Do you think this only happened the once during this war?”
“Don’t be silly,” Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. He darted forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s neck, “She’s my friend nothing more and believe me, she’s got her own problems. I would never want anyone the way I want you Potter,” Matter of fact, like the sun shall rise tomorrow, “Shouldn’t I be the one worried? What about Girl Weasley?”
“Principal McKay-Miller, your 2 o’clock is here.” Jeannie stood and quickly ran an eye over herself. She wanted to make a good first impression. From what she’d already heard this woman was old-old Euro-money and willing to make large donations to the school she chose. She wasn’t going to let Sharpe beat her out. She quickly tapped her phone, “send them in.” She waved her wand towards the door, which opened at her command, even as she moved to the front of her desk to greet them.
Harry leaned down, until their noses nearly touched, “It’s okay to be scared, I’m scared. I’m afraid they won’t accept us. I’m afraid they’ll blame me for their family’s pain. For not being faster to stop him. But most of all, I’m scared you’ll leave me.”
Moments later, a boy leaned his head over the top railing, “Oi,” he called back, he walked around to the head of the staircase and paused, his eyes wide, “blimey, is that Harry Potter,” he looked next to Harry and backed up a step, “And that, bloody. Mandy, you cow, you off your nut? Bringing them round here? A fucking death eater!”
“You always do this.” Ben whispered.
Healer Robertoun, call me Tawy, must have been a very experienced apparator because it was the smoothest side along he’d ever experienced. Once they had stepped from the arrival point, Draco wanted to make something clear, “I’m 17 now. I don’t belong in pediatrics.”
Judge Fumeurs stopped him with a raised hand, “the court is aware of the young man’s whereabouts. Have your clients been made aware of the new accusations levied against them?”
“What are you doing? You don’t have to,”
“Holy shite,” Rey replied. Mummers circled the group.
The red faded, and Harry lowered his wand. “Oh ok,” from petrifying icon of power to sweet teenager in one tense second.
Several students went towards the door, ‘to finish the job’.
Andromeda stood, “how long ago did they do this?”
HpHpHp
Draco rubbed at his face with a childish gesture as the four of them lowered their wands.
Violet bit her lip and looked at Draco, who studied the place. “Very cozy, London chic, you’ve done wonders with the space.”
Tawy leaned forward in her corner. She could practically feel the magic rise and the anticipation and room’s tension with it. The other kids backed away, wands held limply, staring avidly. She guessed the Dog and Bat to be references to Black and Snape but couldn’t guess how or why. She wondered if she were the only one to get the reference.
He worried even more when the Ministries representative, Mr. Kade, showed himself to be a bit of rambling fool. The man had been here a week, and Hermione was still sitting in a waiting cell.
them to be good, so they wouldn’t feel bad about ahhing over them.
“We might have to wait until Hogwarts starts its term.” Neville interjected.
They sat there in silence, Tawy watched Harry and Draco waiting for something, some kind of reaction.
Draco, still more asleep than awake, saw Bear and heard his tone but couldn’t make out his words. A large unknown wizard, standing over him and growling in anger sent Draco into a panic. He made a hurt noise and curled away.
And no, this was not happening, it was not. Harry would not have it. Not after wanting this as long as he could remember, no. The magic turned from a wave into a hammer, “No, no one is taking him away from me.” He stomped his foot, the room’s floor jumped, knocking nearly everyone down. Draco grabbed a hold of the back of Harry’s jumper.
Mandy moved over step and put her attention on Harry, “I don’t know, if you had your wands, could you transfigure one?”
Well what’s the word my friends? I toiled over this one, not sure how it came across but I hope you liked it.
Draco Malfoy using their magic of course.”
Harry glanced to her, “are you,”
“Oh my God,” Ella exclaimed.
“Rodolphus Lestrange has been arrested,” She didn’t mince words.
She quickly raised her wand and sent out fireworks with plenty of noise. “Enough!” She called out with a friendly yell.
“I have an owl and we can go with my sister to work. I usually go with her. She works as a bartender at a muggle night club.
“Thank you, Healer, and have you completed the court’s order?”
The Malfoy’s solicitor quickly overlooked the new document and drew up a privacy shield around himself and his clients. “If you fight this, they will find new charges to levee against you. They’ll tie you up in the courts for years. They will find a way to take every dime you have and put you both in Azkaban. Regardless to any of that, they will take custody of Draco and if they manage to place either of you in Azkaban. Neither of you will ever be able to gain rights to him again. If you sign him over now, your parental rights will not be terminated.” Narcissa shook, tears in her eyes as her husband, with a shaky hand, signed.
“Harry Potter,” one of many called out.
Ron scowled and rolled his eyes.
have nothing but the greatest respect for your many sacrifices.”
Thank you for the encouragement. I was a little hesitate to put this out there, so for everyone who took a moment to give me some courage, you are awesome.  Thank you.
"Sunglasses Draco," Harry called out.
That falter sealed it for Harry. Something was very wrong with Malfoy.
“Is it true that you’re a master Occlumens?” Rey asked softly, he ducked a little when Draco looked his way. “I had heard, I wondered…” he trailed with a shrug.
Clara jumped and quickly backed away. Mandy swore, while Ben moved his chair further away from the cans and them. Rey nervously twisted as a poster ripped itself to shreds and another can burst open in an arch of soda.
Teddy studied the marble, “It’s to show house unity against all odds. Hogwarts is together, against any foe.”
Heidi looked to him, her smile much less toothy, “Ms. Parkinson sends her regards.”
“Give it up Ella,” Clara sang.
Harry nodded, crawling so he was in front of Draco. “I know, I know you are. You’ve changed so much, or maybe not changed but let me see under the ice and Merlin I find you incredible.”
He nodded with as much dignity as he could pull together and gently perched on the edge of the bed. He took the potion and decided waiting was only delaying the inevitable, he tipped the potion quickly back. It was strong, stronger than he was used too. His arm dropped as his upper body followed, unable to control his decent as he dropped into a peaceful and deep sleep.
Molly puffed up. “Where will they be going?”
Mandy scowled. “Seriously?” That was their time. No one ever came to watch them, just Murphy and maybe Tawy hanging out in a corner, while they got to practice every spell they knew. She scowled and gritted her teeth, furious at having her time ruined.
The Judge scowled, “what is the meaning of this?”
Ron nodded, he and Hermione had experienced the same. The number of owls they’d sent in the week they’d been back, well Ron had never sent so many in his life.
The solicitor, who had jumped up as soon as the healer had paused, said quickly, “Your honor, we believe the court would benefit from Healer Robertoun’s professional opinion. She has after all dealt with severe cases and has many years of experience.”
The Judge’s speech paused Molly’s search into her bag for the paperwork that allowed her to speak on Harry’s behalf, her temporary papers were now worthless. There was nothing to be done. The Ministry had completely sideswiped her. She’d had no idea they could take custody or that they’d planned to. She glared at Kingsley, who blankly stared her down.
Harry grinned at her and it nearly took her breath. “Yeah. I’m going to marry that boy.” He stopped, and she nearly ran into him, he looked at her in amazement. “I’m going to marry that boy.”
The Healer frowned. “Healer Tawy put you in all the groups you’d need.”
Ginny jumped up from her seat, shocked and worried. Hell she’d be as friendly with Malfoy as Harry wanted as long as he never looked like that again. She moved towards the door as Hermione and Ron joined her, half their house and then the school followed.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and flooded him with love just to watch the pleased blush spread across Draco’s face.
HpHpHp
“We’re incredibly unlucky Potter.”
“Me too Potter.”
Gasps and whispers ran the room until the senior Judge threatened a silencing charm.
Pansy decided it was worth it. She was late meeting with the other three and the last to arrive. They had decided on a circumvent number of people. Everyone wanted to go see them, but it was decided Ron and Hermione, she and Blaise would be the only ones to go. They didn’t know what kind of shape Potter and Draco would be in or how they would be feeling, hence the fewer the better. She explained why she was late and then, made them even later, by having to relay any fears that she had told the Malfoy’s anything. She hesitated but then told them about the chain. She pulled it from her pocket and pulled it back when Hermione reached for it, “I told you what would happen if you touched it.”
Harry leaned into him, wrapping an arm around him, “It was a nightmare, it’s not your fault.” His eyes rose to Tawy, “thank you for not letting those people,” he stopped, biting his lip and looking away, “I didn’t mean to get so upset, but,”
Molly glanced to him and Harry shrugged, he didn’t think it was a big deal he’d always gotten ‘special’, not fun lessons.
The door opened and then bounced as H.A. Deana’s hip bumped against it. “Hey boys, snack time. I told Tawy about what you said Harry, about getting some muggle stuff for Draco to try, and she was all about it. So, I’ve got some interesting stuff.”
Draco closed his eyes as a slip of an idea began to form. If all Harry really needed, was to know Draco would never leave him, perhaps he had the cure for both of them.
Well he almost always liked Sev’s direct nature. “Um,” he looked between them, unsure what to say.
Hermione frowned. “What if it’s a portkey or dangerous?”
“You broke up?”
“He’s always been like that.” Ron offered. “Harry’s just Harry, over the years we’ve just learned.”
Mandy scowled and closed the magazine. Since they’d come, she’d had her sister sneak in any news on the two and there was so much of it and all of it unbelievable. Just like that shield, unbelievable. She slumped back in her seat, “We should get them drunk and get the real info.”
Draco stopped, “You love that people are scared of me?”
“Longbottom,” Draco nodded.
“The library,” Rey answered, but seeing their confusion, added, “there’s a staircase in the very back with books all the way up. The staircase connects the two floors and if you’re standing on it, the bracelets doesn’t alarm from our side. The ones at the top can’t go on the staircase and we can’t step onto their floor, but we can pass stuff over the top stair.”
Judge Fumeurs said, “Someone transfigure the boy, excuse me, His Grace, a chair please.” Even as he spoke Bear was already doing so, while several other court officials jumped up to do the same. Bear made a large cushy backless chair that seemed out of place, but Draco dropped onto it happily enough and said something that made the large man mummer back with a smile.
Harry sprawled a quick note to Hermione, detailing the address and name of the club and what time they’d get there. He hoped she got it in enough time to gather everyone.
“No, I’m giving you a safe place to heal. Somewhere we can help you,” She moved closer, hands still open, “help, not control. Let you breathe.”
Harry looked to Draco with wide eyes. He’d thought it, thought maybe, but was so relieved when Snape had saved him, brought him back. “The bathroom? Right?”
“The healing draught,”
It had been a hard night. Nightmares had awoken him, what felt like every hour on the hour. Images of Hermione being tortured. Harry’s bloody body. Hell, even one of Draco turning to ash in fiendfyre. Harry’s screams had been particularly horrifying in that one. Ron rubbed his eyes.
She shook her head sorrowfully, “That is what you don’t understand Sir. Draco hasn’t been allowed to make a single decision since he was a very small child.” Her eyes hardened, “Tell me how a child was supposed live in that environment without surrendering every part of himself?”
The ladies laughed with good humor, though Harry didn’t really see what was so funny. He and Ron would be fantastic Aurors. Another year under adult say-so wasn’t that pleasant a thought either. It wasn’t like they’d been a lot of help in the past.
“I love them,” he closed his eyes and dropped his head, “But I’m so angry.”
Violet leaned back after desert. “That was fantastic.” She glanced at her watch. “If you want time to send the word and get changed before I go to work, we need to get going. Are we still taking a cab?”
Yes, your Honor.” The parchment had arrived an hour or so after Draco had been taken, “we have question of how those accounts were received?”
Neville turned the paper just enough to see it, realizing Pansy and Luna were trying to read it as well.
She nodded, “it’ll cut like butter,” her face went far-away, “you won’t even feel that you’ve cut at first,” her eyes cleared, “so be careful, don’t cut deep. When you’re done, say finite.”
Harry got dressed and didn’t bother looking into the mirror.
Mandy turned like everyone else. They didn’t look to sure and Mandy thought they looked a little ready for battle. She turned away.
How could it be that he was so angry with his parents, and yet, he yearned to be with them? In the past he would have gone to them and let them use him again. He would have taken the pain, hurt, rage, and shoved deep inside himself. Draco couldn’t do that anymore. There was no more room in him.
Tawy shook her head, “Harry make sure you go with him.”
Draco glanced at his bracelet, “She’s in group remember, the group we broke?”
It was Draco that Harry looked to though. Draco smiled and brushed his lips against Harry’s. “Of course, I am.”
“What?” Hermione peered around.
“This sucks,” Mandy scowled, “I feel like I’m in a fish bowl.” She swished her wand, sending a nicely done stinging hex onto a practice dummy.
“Oh my god.” She couldn’t imagine being forced into such a nasty situation. “Not by choice, so?”
Hermione shared a look with Ron and he moved to look over her shoulder as she opened the parchment.
They left, holding hands, which was new, but rather expected.
The Judge withdrew into himself and withered under the dark and angry glares directed at him from multiple sources including Judge Fumeurs, who spoke lowly, “and that’s why we don’t let you talk Markus.” He turned compassionate and revered eyes back to Andromeda, “You have the apologies of the court Madam.
“Hmm,” She leaned down to look at the fine line of blood that had rolled from out Draco’s sleeve and made the cuff of his shirt bright red. She turned her head to studied Harry. She leaned back, straightened, “it would be easier to look at Potter first. His sleeve is raised, which means we’ll only have to turn his arm over to see what we’re dealing with.” She pulled her wand, “may I move the bed further back?”
“There will be repercussions,” Shacklebolt said, sounding angry and disgusted.
Draco shrugged. “We drank the shakes. I think we could go.”
“I think you’ll find that’s exactly what we did.” Draco said softly, breaking up Murphy’s reprimand and Mandy’s demands.
“We’re so sorry, we wanted,”
Tawy shut the door after Harry before she turned to the room at large.
Harry looked back at the shield. “Yeah it did. Let’s find somewhere else to be.”
Tawy recognized the need to tread lightly here. However, she still needed to gather some information. She went to the Malfoy’s little group and cast a privacy bubble, while she didn’t care for either, acting as they had, they were her patient’s parents. She also enjoyed the way their solicitor had a fit at not being involved, quite amusing even if she couldn’t hear it. She looked to the mother, giving the father a glance, “I need to know what sets him off?”
She looked to the large man, who had to have giant somewhere in his familial past.
Harry bit his lip after that and let Draco navigate the whole thing. Harry thought he might have learned something too. Draco was polite but firm, exacting without being rude and the Goblins seemed to appreciate Draco’s form of communication more than any he’d tried in the past.
Murphy blushed, “Maybe I should of.”
“He took the mark.”
Judge Fumeurs glanced towards the reporters, who were rabid for every word and then to the generally uneasy and confused masses of the courtroom. “His crimes were extracted from his memories,” he could tell by the look on Andromeda’s face what she thought of that and went on before she could wrack him over the coals. He felt bad enough that it had been done. “They could not falsify his involvement.”
“Ok then,” she smiled, “we’ll do that or we could go over the different types of potions and see if there’s something else you’d rather go with?”
Harry quickly looked Malfoy’s way but could see nothing but hair. He swallowed thickly and looked to the Healer.
Tawy smiled, “I appreciate it and will likely take you up on that.” She set her quill aside, “I have goals for them this year.”
“Not likely. Cissa, what if something happens to me? You would know it. I don’t relish that idea.”
“Now?” Now there was a touch of nerves in Mandy’s voice as she glanced around her.
“Want me to re-braid it for you?” Harry slid off his bed, only pausing to wait for a reply once at Draco’s bedside.
Murphy, seeing he’d mostly lost his audience, let them go early. The group quickly headed towards the door. Harry and Draco hung back just to save themselves from being knocked into.
Rey looked mortified they’d heard. Clara blushed and dropped her head. Mandy didn’t bother hiding the article she was reading about them. “Do what?”
“Oh love,” Pansy reached across the table and took his hand, squeezing as she said, “Of course they do, but,” she sighed, “they’re not very good parents.”
“Have fun?” Draco answered, though he wasn’t sure how that was a goal.
there’s only the one,” Shacklebolt grossed, “how could you not remember? Fine, fetch his file then.”
Tawy tapped the dress shoes with her wand and transfigured them into a pair of trainers. She looked over his green tee-shirt and scrub pants. There was no way she was going to get that boy back into those stuffy clothes and get back to court on time, as it was he was going back a little groggy and a lot late.
Siri brushed back his mess of light brown hair and smiled kindly. “About a school maybe?” Siri looked to Sev, sitting next to him, and still picking at his cake.
Draco straightened and slipped the arm into his shirt. “They are.”
Harry looked at Draco and Tawy could see his joy and love, his happiness even in the wake of such news. Her smiled warmed and grew more real by second as Draco smiled back and it was so sweet and love-filled. They were both so filled with emotions that a month ago she wasn’t sure if they could express anymore much less feel. It made her so happy for the both of them.
Ginny sighed, “You can’t even say the words with them. You stay. Nev?”
She quickly shook her head. “Draco please, continue colouring as we talk.”
Tawy entered with a smile and a tray, from which she took-up a vial, before handing the whole off to Helen. “Alright Draco, this is a short sleep draught, some the diagnostic spells require a sleep state to get more accurate results.” She looked down, shaking the potion for readiness.
“We have to get some clothes as well.” Harry hoped they weren’t being too much of a bother.
They followed Mandy upstairs, where she pointed out a guest room with queen bed, which was better than what they had been doing, trying to share a twin. If for no other reason than the presence of the other stopped the nightmares. They dropped their bags and followed her to her room, which was clean and nicely decorated.
“We just wanted to live a little.” Draco looked to Harry, “you figure Mother might have said something when we saw her in France.”
Narcissa glanced towards Tawy, who seemed solely interested in the plant life, and then to the Potter boy, who appeared was going nowhere. She sighed and softened visibly, “Draco, we,” she paused, seemingly searching for words. “We’re so very happy you’ve come.” She reached across the table. Draco took her hand with the one that wasn’t holding onto Harry much tighter. “Oh,” she bounced up, “look darling,” she produced his trunk already shrunk into miniature, “I’ve got it all ready for you. I’ve packed it full of new things, all sorts of gifts.” She seemed so proud of her herself that Draco could do nothing but nod and thank her. She placed the trunk in front of him with a pat.
The first thing Harry noticed was the hair. It was long and thicker than he remembered, still nearly white and really lovely, flowing halfway down Malfoy’s torso. Harry touched where his own hair had grown over his collar. He stared at Malfoy’s face, he looked tired and his wide gray eyes had dark circles beneath them, which was about the same as the last time he’d seen him. Malfoy looked thinner and paler if that was possible. He was the same height though while Harry had a growth spurt, of at least a couple of inches since he last saw Malfoy, he thought they’d be the same height now.
Hermione looked from one brother to the other knowing she’d missed something between them, but if it helped, she wouldn’t dig. Instead, “There’s no way Harry could ever be just anything with Malfoy.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Cor the speckled git was predictable. “I’m not even sure I’m returning, so worry about yourself.”
She frowned. “Harry?” Tawy tried to see Draco, maybe get a clue, but they were the same height and Draco was doing a pretty good job of hiding into Harry.
Harry turned back to face them, his gripe tight on Draco’s hand.
There may be an epilogue to this, if anyone actually wants to read one of when they return to England, but otherwise complete.
“Harry stop,” Hermione whispered.
“I have examined the boy and with the court’s pardon, if someone isn’t punished for state of that child, I’ll have the reason why.”
Padma murmured, “not bad Weasley,” she looked him over, “not bad at all.”
The cab ride took a half hour and while Violet kept looking at the meter, neither Harry or Draco spared it a glance, so Mandy worked to make sure Violet didn’t either.
“It’s okay,” Harry said, though he was still hanging onto his boyfriend and didn’t look her way, “you weren’t to know. It’s fine.”
She nodded and then dropped her eyes, curling her body into herself. She cupped her hands and brought her face down, whispering feverishly into her palms. She lifted her head and un-cupped her hands. There, no longer than her palm, was a golden handled dagger. “Will this work?” She held it up, the light glinted off the sharp blade.
Mandy waited for them at the bottom of the stairs. Her eyes wide as Violet whistled. “Mates when I said you cleaned up well, I didn’t know the half of it.” She turned to Mandy, “Are they famous for modeling?”
Draco smirked back and responded with a pose, not quite his own.
“Does it help?” Tawy asked just as softly.
But Teddy remembered when they hadn’t been okay. He remembered the healers and the charms and the pain.
Harry hadn’t even realized he’d closed his eyes. He readjusted, sitting up and glancing over to see Draco, alert and narrow-eyed.
Harry congratulated himself at not chuckling and then did anyway. Their fear of Draco really amused him. He couldn’t help it. “What?” Harry noticed what was left of the joint cold between his fingers.
He thumped his head against the wall, cursing himself for his weakness. If he didn’t answer she might use veritaserum. For all he knew any lie or misinformation might get him a steeper sentence. He thumped his head harder, “I have horrible nightmares.”
Harry noticed Andromeda was smiling but it was tight and hurt, almost the same way she’d smiled at Teddy during the funerals. Like she was so sad and yet something good was still around. Harry glanced at Shacklebolt, who seemed grave in a way he’d never seen the man before. Even Judge Fumeurs seem subdued, his face tight with consternation and he solemnly called the court to order. “The court calls forth the accused The Marquis de Malfoy and Marchioness de Malfoy nee Black.”
The muggle seat did not lend itself to getting up quickly, but Draco managed and brought Harry along with. He staggered under the strain of holding himself in check. Harry stood but wavered and groaned softly, trying to hold tightly.
He took a deep breath and whispered. "I have a dark mark."
Harry walked towards him but paused a few steps away from Draco.
He didn't even know who to expect. An insane amount of people had talked to him the days after the Battle. That's why he only went out when he had to.
