" as he yanks Harry to his chest. Sirius is running toward them, suddenly he seems much further away than he was before.
"Great," he says absently, and they both quickly make their way to their room. Up ten creaky stairs, and to the left. It's the second room, and the door creaks when Draco turns the key. He has to feel around the wall a little for the switches, but they turn on after a few lazy blinks.
He wouldn't know what to do with himself otherwise. He doesn't like being left alone with his own mind lately.
Out of all of the times for Harry to ignore his presence whilst also being acutely focused on Draco, this
"It's about Harry," Remus says and watches as Sirius sits up straighter, his eyes clearing for a moment.
Harry is getting more overwhelmed by the minute, even more so than when that man had rescued him from the Dementors. And
to the floo. If Draco and I don't make it, you are under explicit orders to floo to the headquarters. But if we are together, then I'll take charge. If I say 'run'. You run. You don't linger or look back or more people die. Do you understand?"
He hears it in the distance, not from a particular direction, but from every direction at once, and somehow Harry still knows he has to head to the left, just under the old giant roots of a beech tree, make his way through the tall stalks and there he would see it, a small trickle that runs from the edge of his vision to as far as his eyes can see.
must have screwed up in that fucked up family of yours, or else our lord wouldn’t have granted me with this mission,”
It’s night, and Harry cannot actually see the sky above the canopy of enormous trees and lush vibrant leaves that extend infinitely above him. He doesn’t care, he knows this place already, like the back of his hand,  he’s not lost or scared.
do it?" He asks under his breath. He can't help it. This, this is the man who outwitted Albus Dumbledore. The same man, Severus can't figure out for the life of him.
He screams. Of course, it's a heated knife, literally sealing his skin together. The bandage roll helped, probably a lot more than Draco admits later. Because it was either the roll, or his own tongue.
"Draco Malfoy, visiting a farm?" He drags and settles the knife directly on the low burning flames, then crawls next to Draco. Their bodies are flush together.
"Who says so?" She answers, her voice is like silk, but dangerously low. Evan hears her stepping closer. She sounds heavy, as if wearing armour. Evan shouldn't be surprised, she always used to wear those beneath her robes.
He doesn't dare call Twinky again, this had to do for now. Just thinking about this makes Harry's hands tremble harder, because maybe, just maybe, he shouldn't be treating Draco at all. Maybe this death would be more merciful than the one awaiting them once Voldemort returned.
We don't need to do this. Cedric's death was tragic and I dream about it sometimes, so what?” Harry is gesturing around wildly; it’s almost comical and Ron is having trouble following Harry’s hands, “You still have recurring nightmares about a tarantula eating your face! We all have issues." Ron refocuses back on Harry’s face.
The way he looks at the sea reminds Draco of the day he had first seen the sea himself as a small toddler, on a trip to Southern France to their villa house near the beach. Enthralled and terrified of the vastness at once. Those were the best days of his life.
He can’t go back to Gryffindor Tower like this, so he takes to walking around aimlessly. He is hungry, his grumbling stomach acutely reminds him of his summers with Dursleys and Harry groans. The food would have been long gone from the Great Hall, he only hopes that Ron had saved him some sandwiches or rolls like last night.
"Harry stop." All these nicknames are giving him whiplash, by constantly reminding him of the conversation they had prior to this moment in the train station. He’s not quite sure Harry still remembers that conversation, or all the awful things Draco used to call him.
Chapter warnings for; blood, violence, torture, explicit language, implied child abuse, implied threats of rape/non-con.
He huffs a noiseless chuckle, and mildly narrows his eyes at the small, almost mote sized purple flowers, bunching near the stream from both sides, he’s transfixed by them, and as he looks down at the rushing water, Harry vaguely wonders if the Draco like force would ever push him down into the stream the same way he pushed Harry off the rooftop, send Harry cascading down to another world, or maybe just down an unseen depth in the stream that will only drown him to death.
"Mingling with other pure-blooded children was a duty, not out of pleasure. I've known them since childhood."
"How do you feel about boiled carrots?" He asks some time later, very cautiously working with the knife on the chopping board. Draco is sitting on one of the chairs, skimming through the book he had found in one of the rooms, the Moonstone one that was filled with his godfather's usual corrections in the corners of the text itself. Even the handwriting exuded smug knowledge. Severus probably had a field day with this book, and if he were just petty enough, he would have actually written to the idiotic author and would have told him a thing or two about the 'delicate art of potion making'.
"Insomnia, huh?" says Bill, crossing his arms on the kitchen table. "I've heard you had a rough day,"
Severus never let him play around with the fun stuff when he was younger, so this sounds just as fascinating to him as it might sound horrifying to Harry.
"No!” Draco laughs again, this time a small, bitter thing. “I just...how? Tigers are majestic, strong, they're not…” he stops laughing, “...damaged."
It’s very lucky that at least one of them knows how to cook, and the familiarity with which Harry moves around the kitchen, makes it quite clear that he’s in his element.
Draco blinks. Once. Twice. He holds Severus' gaze for approximately three seconds, and pretends he doesn’t understand.
He won't leave Draco alone, he thinks it again and again, like a mantra as he exits his room. He might just deliver the boys to Grimmauld place, but he is going to make sure that his godson isn't mistreated.
Running away, if at all possible by an astronomical streak of luck, could be considered an option if she, along with his godfather, nearly half of the people he knows for sure and their parents weren't Death Eaters.
He doesn't, instead, he takes them both to the rowed seats in front of the huge machines and they settle.
"I've wronged them. Merlin knows I've wronged them," he whispers, and his voice is so raspy that it makes Severus wince.
The reason why Harry is craving food after that graphic nightmare is because of a very interesting effect we found whilst writing; formaldehyde actually induces hunger, particularly appealing to one’s sense of umami (the part where you crave meat), so it’s quite normal to crave food after having been near a dead body. Of course, Harry’s was just a nightmare, but we took a bit of liberty with it :)
"What could you possibly do to me with that peeler, Potter?" Snape rolls his eyes, closing the door behind him with a subtle swish of his wand. Harry glares at the man, but lowers the peeler nonetheless, his gaze following Snape as the man makes his way to the kitchen.
Draco watches him doing that a lot. Just staring into space, almost as if he's not aware of his surroundings anymore. There are no books to occupy him, no conversation, although Harry does start humming some times, without even seeming to notice he is.
His whole arm is wet and sticky with warm blood. And there’s more that’s trickling down. If they leave a trail of blood behind them, then running would be futile.
“Trust me, Potter,” the smirk is gone now, “You don’t want to know what becomes of him." Severus doesn't want to, either. He and Lucius were good friends, they had history together. His loss would leave its mark on Severus. "Neither does Draco. He has already lost enough.”
Harry doesn't bother listening to Hermione's response, and only tears his gaze away from Umbridge over to the Slytherin table, making sure that no one else will catch him at it. He cannot help it. Every time he sees Malfoy's face, the only thing at the front of his mind is the other boy's twisted face, contorted in pain and outrage as he cried and thrashed in his bounds, only meters away from his mother.
"Your cooking is definitely better than the potions," Draco says with a snort and reaches for his cup. Harry gives him a tight-lipped smile but doesn't glance away from Snape's eyes.
Draco's hand itches around his wand, and there's a tiny voice inside his head, telling him that he needs to give Potter something
His wand is useless now, or so it seems as the man vehemently warned him against using it. Harry carefully pockets it again and sets his broken glasses on the kitchen table. In the most hysterical manner yet, he opens the fridge and just stares inside, letting the natural coolness and the bright light shock him back into reality. Vernon would have had a fit if he saw him like this.
"Hey um, while you're here…" she draws a thick stack of envelopes from her bag, "is there any way you could take our letters to Harry?" She sees his eyes widen, "We wrote new ones," she blurts out, "it's really brief, and we tried to write it in code--"
"He's a blind fool," Minerva growls, referring to Fudge. "He's disregarding the signs. Of course, this attack was planned, and of course, it was meant as a warning. It couldn't have been clearer if they were dancing right in front of him in death eater robes,"
"Please leave," he said. The words felt like sand in his mouth. It hurt to push them out, they coated everything around him and he knew it would take years to clean up after everything was said and done.
"Well, I'm not an Auror, if that's what you were worried about. No more Auror interrogations for a while! Erm, my name is Harry Potter. I'm a Magizoologist, not affiliated with the Ministry."
Thus far, Pansy has not failed her yet. Her humor is very targeted and tends to veer on rude, but it doesn't help that she has a rather blunt way of talking in combination with a flat affect. Occasionally she can be quite defensive when Hermione tells her that a joke has gone too far. Most times that happens she will always come back a while later and explain herself and apologize.
James had his mouth against Sirius head, biting at his earlobe as he languidly rolled his cock against Sirius'.
"Here we are." He looked at Draco's face nervously. "Take it easy on him, yeah? He's been holed up in his office for the past three days."
Slughorn is speaking but he isn't listening. He looks around the classroom and stops when he sees a white-blond head a few seats in front of him. Draco Malfoy is looking worse than ever; Harry can tell by his hunched posture and swaying head, like he can't stay awake. Harry wishes he could walk over there and slam his hands down and demand answers from him.
Harry laughed a little in disbelief. He opened the door wider and made room for Draco to slip inside. The entire room could've been filled with pink peacock feathers and he would have been none the wiser; all of his focus was on formulating his thoughts into a straight line. So his speech wouldn't be so jumbled when he let those ideas out of his head.
Even on the way back to the eighth year dormitories, they were quiet. Potter looked to be in deep concentration and Draco wouldn’t be the one to stop that. Merlin knows it wasn’t a common occurrence.
"They're not so different. Except I don't fully lose myself without Wolfsbane. I am completely capable of using magic while transformed. Which is why the potion is so important. Without it, my magic goes a bit haywire."
He arrived at an empty table in the far back of the library, where hardly anybody was around. He didn’t want to pick a completely desolate area, in case he needed a witness to speak on his behalf if anything went wrong. Draco set up his books and parchment paper and started writing.
Draco's cheeks are in flames. "What reason would I have to lie? This," he raised the book a little, "is my personal diary. I can hardly imagine wondering if my intimate thoughts were going to be read by my rival when I was in fourth year."
“Oh,” Harry whispered, then wanted to kick himself. He knew somewhere that this was really important and he was racking his brain looking for any memories that could define what that meant. He passively remembered a day when he was about twelve when his Aunt Petunia was scoffing at a news program wherein the person being interviewed had a… sex change, he remembered they said. About a man who turned into a woman. His Uncle Vernon called them a “tranny.”
"I promise this isn't required just because of the investigation. I mean, uh, I'm not doing this because I want you to spill the shop's secrets or anything." Hank looked positively awkward as hell. "But I would really love to take you out for a drink sometime."
"Well," Draco sounds pleased as they say this, "you have it now. Why don't we officially meet up sometime. Without alcohol this time, preferably. And without a bet."
Ron speeds up his strokes. It's getting harder to keep his activities a secret. He curses himself for not closing the curtains.
He seemed insistent on that last point. Aggravated, almost. Draco’s chest burst in satisfaction. He liked knowing that he could still get under Potter’s skin, could still get him pissed off.
Merlin, he should’ve been prepared, though. He knew eventually someone would try to humiliate him like this. He just didn’t expect it to happen from his own teammates.
"We have about twenty minutes left until we get to Hogwarts," Harry tells him as Draco cleans himself up as best he can with the tried-and-true way. (With a clean pair of underwear from his trunk. It's not the best, but not the worst.)
"In here," Draco responds loudly. He stands from his desk and wipes the ink from his pen off on his trousers. (A pen is a Muggle invention. Stores a limited amount of ink in it but it is much more convenient than having to dip your quill every thirty seconds.)
With great effort, Draco sat up. On his knees because his bottom stung too much for him to move it a whole lot. How was he supposed to get home like this? What was he supposed to say? There was deep bruising on his wrists and ankles and chest where the vines were holding him up. His cock was rubbed raw and he could only imagine how he looked behind.
Oh, Draco bet is was. He could feel the blood underneath his face thrumming. Thank the stars above he didn't blush as easily as Potter.
"Ah! No, this isn't about that," Hank reached out to stop him, almost touching Draco's arm. His magic buzzed underneath his fingertips and crackled along his skin. "We're checking in with dozens of other potions shops, internationally. I was just assigned to the shops here. No international traveling for me." He laughed uncomfortably.
Malfoy’s wand was located in his trunk, hidden at the very bottom in a wand case he got handmade from Ollivander. It was a gift, he said while he gave Luna Lovegood her new wand. It called out for him. Harry often wondered why it was so easy for it to accept him as its wandmaster. When he asked, Ollivander just admitted that it was a very strange occurrence and left it at that.
He looked like he didn’t get enough sleep. Dark circles were under his eyes and he was slow in his movements. Now that he was thinking about it, Harry didn’t remember seeing him at breakfast or lunch. And despite the apparent hostility from some of the students, Malfoy didn’t ever refuse to show his face during mealtimes.
He wondered what Blaise would say if he knew that he was nude in the same room as Potter, all alone. Probably threaten the Gryffindor about treating him right, while joking that Draco is a first-class whore who deserves respect.
Using the velvet curtain, he cleans off the rest of the mirror. Gellert is standing right next to him, except he's not. His head is just an inch taller than his, like usual, except it's not. He's not truly there, just in the mirror.
He smiled a little mockingly. “No. The family portrait told my parents before I could. He certainly wasn’t upset about the news.” Draco’s eyes met the floor again. “But, yeah. That’s the truth. I apologize if this ends whatever we started but I’m not apologizing for who I am.”
Forcing his legs to move, Draco entered the changing room. Rowdy laughter and raucous conversation pressed against the tiled walls. No eyes laid upon him, not yet at least, so he wasted not a moment, speeding past the other eighth years and into a stall. Under his breath, he muttered a sticking charm on the curtain so that nobody but him could move it. When he was in Slytherin, everyone knew about his snootiness for privacy, but this was a group he didn’t know. Or, perhaps more accurately, they didn’t know of him.
Her expression doesn't move. The friend next to her is raising an eyebrow at the whole situation. Harry has no chance with them after all this, huh? Fuck, why did he agree to do this again? 20 pounds surely wasn't this uncomfortable situation.

, not a hand-me-down or cheap. He owned a walk-in closet to put all of his clothes and shoes. There were houseplants all over, all of different sizes. He probably dedicated too much of his time to keeping them alive.
Draco nodded and dutifully looked in the cupboards under the desk. He rummaged around for a few minutes, hoping to buy some time before he had to face Hank again. If he let his wandering mind have its way, he'd be opening his mouth and blabbing about giving him his number. Hank was attractive in a classically handsome way, not really Draco's type in that sense, but he looked... close enough to who he really wanted.
Maybe he should have been worried, but he was too entranced by the strong grip Hank had on his bicep and shoulder to focus on that niggling in the back of his mind.
"Well... I want things to be better for us. And I am pretty fucked up on healing potions. I, uh, also respect what you're doing."
. Every single shelf. Because of course nobody actually cleans up after themselves and Dean's almost positive the librarian was really just some gargoyle they stole from a church.
The window glass is fogging up with every breath he takes. Every lurch of the train is pushing more of Harry's thickness inside of him. His hands grasp at the plush seat below him as a thrust nearly puts him off-kilter.
"I really think so. If non-lycanthropes can have their preconceived notion that you're all destructive challenged, by engaging in the magical world and integrating into our most iconic professions."
He shivered, remembering how cold it got at night during autumn. And there was a draft wafting in from the entrance.
Draco whines and ruts into the soft mattress beneath him. Thinking of those days just makes him miss Harry. The Room of Requirement can give him all the comfort in the world, but it can't summon one of his boyfriend's shirts or underwear. Unfortunately.
He looks up at the sound of approaching footsteps. In front of him, breathing heavily, is Draco Malfoy. The boy looks thinner than Harry's ever seen him before; his robes shrink his body so much. His face is gaunt and his eyes are sunken. Even how heavily he's breathing is odd. Was this the same boy who could challenge Harry at Quidditch any day of the week?
The ropes that held his hands up disintegrated and James' hands fell limp. Teddy massaged his wrists firmly. They knew the ropes wouldn't intentionally hurt him, but it helped them to feel like they're doing something helpful. And James has confessed in the past that it does help him emotionally.

None of his roommates cared either. Crabbe and Goyle were, thankfully, too dense to figure out exactly why he was so stingy about bathroom-sharing or why Madame Pomfrey and Snape doted over him every few months. Blaise had asked about it during their second year, wondering why he was always drinking new potions. (They were experimental, meant to stop the impending doom of menstruation his body would force him to endure. Blessedly, he’d never had to experience the occurrence, only hearing secondhand whinging from Pansy every few months starting at the beginning of their third year.)
He takes one of Harry’s hands, wraps it around his shoulder and presses the palm against the wound. Harry resists when Draco whimpers in pain.
Harry had cried because of course, he would’ve. He was small, a child, he was scared, and his head hurt so much.
"No,” Draco says hotly, he most decidedly was not obsessed. Isn’t obsessed. “Obsession does NOT apply here at all. I was merely interested, and you infuriated me. So it became a hobby."
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, aftermath of torture, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), description of injury.
"I'm sorry for teasing,” Harry says, finally unfolding his hands, but then he leans forward, grin widening, “but it is kind of hilarious."
Stumbling on the low coffee table and the armchair in his way as Harry rapidly strides to the bathroom.
Severus grasps Potter’s elbow and helps him off the ground, quickly casting a knee reversing hex at Rosier, who stumbles and falls to the ground in a heap, his legs bent at a disturbing angle. His yell is loud as he casts the Killing Curse towards them, but in his rage, his aim is off.
Part of it, Remus knows is because of Harry's predicament, but the rest is just Sirius being an asshole on purpose.
Malfoy offers him a vial of Blood Replenishing potion as he rubs the dittany soaked cloth over the injury, and Harry uncorks it with his mouth, working awkwardly with his left hand. He'd been skeptical at first, entertaining the thought that Malfoy might be poisoning him. But he is fairly certain now that these really are Blood Replenishers. Or he might have bled out to death long ago.
His eyes flick over to Potter, and they linger, taking in the image of the other boy intently staring at his lap. Nothing looks wrong with him, except for what takes Draco a second to notice. The look in Potter's eyes. Or rather, the lack of any particular acknowledgement in his eyes. Draco is instantly drawn to them, sweeping his eyes over Harry's body. It takes him a moment too long to notice why the scene is mesmerizing to him.
“You know I have a funny feeling that you and Ron would get along,” Draco opens his mouth. Closes it, then opens it again.
Just on cue, a flock of paper planes lands haphazardly from the ceiling, overwhelming their wide-eyed mail receiver, who looks about ready to cry. Kingsley flicks his wand at the poor man's desk, arranging the planes. "Take your time," he tells LionClaw who stares back at him with saucer wide eyes and a slack mouth.
This is one of our most emotionally charged chapters and we really hope you like reading it as much as we loved writing it. Thanks a bunch to our beta!
She opens the door for him, her smile an ugly slash across her face, stretching wide and showing too many teeth. "In, Mr. Malfoy."
Harry chuckles, and it feels hysterical, "Disinfect? There's no point. It's just going to...Draco your wound is really, really open."
"By two percent," Draco shoots back, his logic was overpowering, it squashed down any hope with hard facts, like a boot trampling ants.
Dolohov is crouched in a crook in the wall, only narrow enough to fit one person, slander them in the shadows.
His eyes scan Harry from head to toe, as he berates himself for falling asleep. He munches on the sandwich and decides that Harry looks healthy and surprisingly bright enough.
She jerks her head once. "Then come make lunch, Dudders should be back from the library any minute now."
"Well, then it must be wrong," Umbridge interrupts him sweetly, tapping the clock with mock disappointment on her face.
All of that for this little piece of jewellery. He turns back to Albus, helping him sit up and drink some water. The effects of the poison are more mental than physical, he knows that much. And while he’d wondered why the Dark Lord would request such a thing when he could just as easily use a cruciatus, now he knows.
He already has the panic room in his mind filled to the brim with Greyback's assault, the possible side effects of last night and the fact that this might just be the last two days of his life. He has no room for Potter.
Draco scrubs a hand down his face and then racks his eyes over Harry, looking for something. "You didn't sleep, did you?"
in the graveyard, when that vile scaley finger had touched his scar, nearly splitting his head in two with a kind of pain, that was to this day, still unimaginable to Harry.
It's warm. That's good for them both. Mostly for Harry. Draco sure as fuck hopes that the cramping eases up now. He can virtually feel it in the tenseness of Harry's shoulders.
"Oh this is good," Evan's grip loosens on his throat. "I was gonna do it right here...but look at this!" He twirls Harry's wand with a manic chuckle. Sirius swears and Harry closes his eyes. He doesn't have enough air to breathe, and not nearly enough energy to keep kicking.
She’d wanted to force him to stop. Force him to tell her what was wrong, so together, maybe, they could find a solution.
-Listen to me, Draco. You’re not a bad person, alright? You are good. A very good person, who bad things have happened to. And… I love you.
-Listen… I can’t tell you if I love you. I don’t know what that means anymore… The only thing I know is that when I’m with you, it becomes slightly less hard to go through the days. Slightly easier to tell myself there is a future in front of me. And I know it’s bad, in so many ways we can’t even count them. And I know I should feel ashamed. But I can’t. Because when life took you almost everything you had… You’ve got to try building back with what is left, right?
Their inner office is an absolute mess today. He's short on one Auror team whom he dispatched to a case in Devon, and nearly half of the paperwork is still incomplete, on top of that, they're getting one letter after the other, reporting missing persons and suspicious deaths. And Kingsley only has so many people on call.
"Maybe Monday afternoon will suffice?" Umbridge says and Harry gulps, dropping his hand to his side, vaguely feeling the dark blood dripping down his fingers upon the stone floor.
“We don’t have to go very far now,” Harry says softly. Draco purses his lips and looks ahead of himself, the gravel crunching under their feet as they walk. It’s just miles of green ahead. He can’t see any sort of buildings other than a couple of abandoned farms left to the weather.
To her credit, and Draco is not above giving credit where it’s due, just not aloud, she regains composure remarkably well, although she still looks slightly disgruntled, “Hasn’t yours taught you not to sneak around late at night?”
"I guess she heard Dumbledore talking or something." Draco’s sure she didn’t. Dumbledore is a great wizard, even the Dark Lord knows it. He won’t be careless about such information.
"I didn't know our lord demoted you," he says, suddenly, in futile hopes of catching her off guard. Of course, she rarely is. He can't feel her flinching behind him. Always still, like a fucking statue.
"This is really good," Draco compliments Harry, as he does every day, and Harry ducks his head into his drink with a small nod.
Albus is still shivering. Severus sighs, letting the paper fall from his hand. “Albus, you need to drink some more water,” he says tiredly, conjuring up another glass.
whereas Harry had been tortured again. Something his body wasn’t supposed to handle. And cursed to top it off. Draco’s mouth grows dry as he thinks about Harry’s blank face, closed eyes. Cold body as he had moved mechanically.
Severus pushes the image away and continues, “Which might temporarily provide relief, but eventually wears off after the consumer gains immunity to the ingredients. The tremors wear off a little after some time, though. Some types of magic… aren’t reversible. This is one of the many reasons why the cruciatus curse is, well, an unforgivable.”
Thanks again to our wonderful beta, and hope you all enjoy this short interlude before the next chapter. We can’t wait to share it with you.
The damage was done, not only is Albus now accused of endangering his students, but also for helping a convicted criminal. He's gone now. Severus is sure they would not be able to see or hear more of him unless he wants them to.
he has the words carved in is a bruised purple colour, and horribly swollen. And there are faint, dark poisonous veins spreading upwards towards his wrist and disappearing upwards. It looks like blood poisoning. But the uneasiness rising in his gut tells him it’s not as simple as that.
Their bag is hanging from Draco’s good shoulder. It had taken a great deal of arguing before Harry let Draco carry it. But whatever Harry might think, he’s definitely worse off than Draco. And anyway, Draco’s injury was his own fault, and this whole thing is just his self-assigned punishment.
It's dark too soon for his tastes and Harry's reseller energy tapers off quickly, so rapidly that he almost falls face-first into the sidewalk before Draco catches him.
"Draco loves to tell the story." She said smiling, "Why don't you take a seat Harry?" She waved her arm in the direction of the other chair and he followed her direction, sitting down.
"You lied to me then?" Harry runs a hand through his hair, trying to steady himself. "For what? A couple truthful answers? Were any of your answers real?"
Draco strided to the doors and pulled them open to reveal a small room, similar to a walk in closet. The inside was made of wood-the floors and walls- and Draco stepped into it leaving Harry in the other room. "You like sweatshirts right?" Draco asked before tossing something over his shoulder. Harry jumped and grabbed it to find a comfy red sweatshirt, it looked to be twice his size.
"I don't remember much, but the death eaters came in through the front door. We were eating dinner and they took out Petunia first... with an avada kedava. My cousin, Dudley ran out the back door but they sent someone after him, so I don't think he's still alive. My uncle fought the hardest but hes a muggle so he died quickly as well.
Rolling the letter up and tying it off with the same string Hermione had used, Harry put the letter on the owl's leg. Said creature hooted at him once before flying out the window. "Who is the letter too?" A voice called from the doorway.
"Speaking of school," Lucius said. "Severus and I don't think it would be a good idea for you to go." Draco and Harry, both surprised, took it in different ways.
While they had both expressed their concern, neither of them had been angry on his behalf or taken the matter to someone else, someone who might be able to help. Of course, Harry remembered with a snort, he had taken to someone else and been refused. Dumbledore had blamed him.
"Pansy chased me out of the house," Draco replied distantly unable to look away from the bruises, "What are those?"
"I'm surprised you got him to be quiet at all. The only person he will listen to is a Malfoy. If Lucius hadn't told him to leave me alone, and this was at the threat of burning the man's portrait, then I doubt I would get the peace I do now."
"I'm happy I switched sides while I could." Lucius agreed sitting down in his seat across the desk. He looked at the books that covered his walls in thought, hoping one would contain the answers he sought.
Lucius's hands tightened unconsciously around Harry's body as they landed in between the two houses across what used to be the Dursleys' lawn. Police crowded the cement road redirecting traffic as reporters and investigators tried to understand what happened.
"What. Did. You. Do?" James asked again. He was clearly losing patience and fast. He hadn't been together with Lily in eight years, but he still couldn't look in her eyes as he spoke.
"I wouldn't suggest talking either." Snape reprimanded reaching for some salve that sat on the bedside table. "This will help with the pain. Just rub it on your throat." He passed Harry the salve, cringing at the sight of his neck. "I'm gonna go get the Malfoys. They would want to know you're awake."
"He always says that Pansy would hate him, but she wouldn't. I know she wouldn't. She always laughs when I tell her about the stupid stuff Harry does." Draco frowned as he spoke, but he didn't continue the argument. Narcissa smiled softly as she considered what he said, her hands picking up the cloth again.
"I left on a table by the stairs, last I remember." Harry said, thinking quickly. Lucius nodded and began walking to the scene in a clipped pace. Harry thought he saw Mrs. Figg, but she disappeared too quickly for him to be sure.
"Red is your favorite color?" Harry asked, ignoring the insult. He didn't know what to do now that he had the clothes. Part of him was uncomfortable standing next to Draco half naked, but another part-a more reasonable part- wanted to continue the conversation and see what happened.
"It isn't exactly common for men to be gardeners is it?" He released the petal and stepped back to look at her.
"I know what you're thinking about, and don't." Lucius said coming to a stop behind Snape's chair so he could read over his shoulder. Neither of them could still believe the number of injuries he had suffered.
"I'm not sure what to do." The man ran a hand through his black hair and took a sip of his tea. "I used to dream of escaping my own father but I was never sure what i wanted people to say after they found out. Sympathy? No, that just made me feel worse. Hatred? Definitely not. Them being happy that I escaped felt like I had never belonged to my father in the first place."
"Just be careful, I'll wait over here for you. Yell if something happens, I put up a silencing ward earlier." Lucius turned to look at the crowd before his eyes lit up and he turned back, "Just don't leave this area." Harry nodded in response before making his way to the middle of the rubble.
"Of course I did," Draco replied with a pout. "I thought it might make him feel more comfortable around her."
"My father and Snape were acting weird." He replied grabbing an apple. He turned to head back but found Pansy in the doorway.
"That isn't any of my concern Potter. It's just a wand after all. You can always get a new one." Snape replied throwing Harry's hands down onto the sheets and storming out of the room.
"Any reason you should be waiting for me to wake up?" Harry retorted leaning against the bedpost as he found his prior adrenaline rush gone.
"Thank you." Harry said just before Lucius left and he turned and smiled at him before closing the door. Harry stared at the silver sheets as he twisted his wand in his hand. "I suppose you're mad at me." Harry whispered breaking the silence.
"I think tormenting you is a great reason." Draco responded as Snape entered the room followed by Lucius.
"You aren't alone anymore, Potter." Draco grinned letting Harry's last name roll of his tongue like it was natural. "Also, my parents and Severus gave up on it. Forcing you to stay here that is. I guess they came to the conclusion that there was no point keeping you here if you didn't want to be."
Snape rolled his eyes at the gryffindor's back and opened his book. "I am perfectly capable of holding a conversation, but I appreciate the gesture. The offer on tutoring still stands, Potter. You need only ask."
It was midday. That's what it looked like to Harry, anyway. Around two pm at the latest. He placed the blue vase on the floor and began to admire the flowers. He considered adding orange, but he didn't think the colors meshed well and began to look at the red flowers.
Draco was silent as he glared at her. She smiled deviously before continuing, "So, my dear friend, Draco Malfoy, what happened this morning."
As Harry stared at the lump before him, he was reminded of how truly powerless he was and found himself apologizing. The words tumbling out of his mouth before he could harness them, completely out of control. The fabric hadn't asked to be used in such a way. It had no choice. The fabric couldn't decide who bought it and cared for it. It had no choice in what happened to it.
Severus only raised his eyebrows in response. "I'll have to complete another checkup on Harry when we return and find a way to disguise nutrient potions. I can probably just tell him that they're to speed up the healing of his bruises."
He looked like an artist with paintbrushes and canvases scattered around the floor, haphazardly. It looked similar to the wreckage that was the Dursleys' house. "Do you need something?" Despite his friendly appearance the man's voice was cold and Harry shook his head before leaving.
The bright blue and red cars brought a new hint of excitement that the residents of Privet Drive hadn't seen for ages, so those who didn't have to work and those who didn't have plans stood outside their doors or in front of the rubble, hugging their own torsos, as they gossiped among themselves.
Lucius sighs as he repositions Harry. "Can you at least attempt to take care of my gift?" He smirks as he asks knowing full well Severus won't answer.
He turned back to Lucius as he heard him whispering and saw Lucius's wand tap him before he felt something descend down his skin. "A disillusionment charm?" Harry guessed.
He tried to brush off his own feelings. Release the frog in his throat and restart the fiery temper he was known so well for. But, he couldn't. In those moments of anger he had realized exactly how close he had grown to them.
He remembers yelling. Uncle Vernon getting so angry his skin turned vermilion and then a fist coming towards him. Stairs?
Pansy rolled over, looking up at him with a smile. "I think that's the first time I've heard you apologize."
Harry says that they killed his relatives and beat him up. One of the death eaters apparently let him go or something and Harry said he ran to his room before they could catch him. That he locked himself inside and they burned the house down in response."
Running a hand through his hair he grabbed his dirty clothes and left. He didn't think he would run into anybody because they were all out so he wasn't worried. "Potter?" A voice called from just down the hall and looked up to see Draco. He looked shocked at the state of Harry's body and his hand twitched.
"Don't worry about what you can't finish. I have some dogs out back who can finish our leftovers." She reassured him as she caught his look.
Pansy wasn't exactly his best friend at the time. Draco had been irritated that she refused to follow the dark lord wholeheartedly. If it wasn't for Severus, Draco would never have gone in the first place.
"Anyway, he still lied about having his wand." Draco cleared his throat before speaking hoping to shut her up.
"Because that was all for show! My parents are spies for the light, if I was nice to you in front of everyone it would be obvious that they were faking it and they would be killed." Draco snarled placing his feet between the door and the wall. "I will not be the cause of my parents' death just to make you feel better."
"I don't know where the dining room is." Harry stated, looking at Draco as if that should be obvious. Draco ran a hand through his hair and walked past Harry, down the stairs.
"It isn't good to leave a lady waiting." Lucius said, an edge to his voice. Draco dropped his fork and sighed.
Being only sixteen, Harry was still underage and after his last run in with underage magic, Harry did not want to be caught again. He paused in his thoughts, contemplative. "They wouldn't-"
"I suppose you're happy you got your wand back." Snape joked as he stood up and walked to the bed. "I wanted to apologize." Harry looked up in surprise as Snape took a seat in an uncomfortable looking, wooden chair. He realized it was the same chair Snape was sitting in when he woke up. He wondered how long Snape sat there for.
"I think I'll leave that to you, Mr.Potter." She replied ignoring his questions as she disappeared through the french doors.
Harry's eyes roamed the room until they came down to his hands, which had begun to squirm and clash before breaking apart. "Why are you being so nice to me, sir?"
"He's lying Snape." Lucius said pacing around his own office. Snape glared at him from his seat at Lucius's desk as he picked up the medical report the healer had left.
"Those?" Harry questioned. They both knew what 'those' was and Draco definitely knew that Harry knew. Neither of them wanted to clarify what 'those' was though. Draco because he didn't want to admit that someone he had once considered to be his enemy had suffered and Harry because he didn't want to look weak.
"I thought you might sleep through dinner too. I asked Severus to wake you up." Draco explained to Harry before looking at him expectantly, but Severus just shook his head. He shrugged a bit, before hesitating and leaving.
"Leave Harry alone. He has enough to deal with as it is." Narcissa reprimanded them and then smiled at Harry, "I'll be in my garden all day if you want to talk about anything." Snape shared a glance with Lucius shocked as Harry smiled back.
"Who's the lazy one who can't make his own dinner." Harry whispered as he turned back to the window. He felt more than heard as Vernon yanked him up by his hair and dragged him out of the room.
Severus snorted and pulled a book off of his coffee table before tossing it to Lucius. "If you're curious then read up." Lucius caught the book and turned it over to read the title.
He refused to look back in the mirror as he stripped down and stepped into the shower. He pulled the white knob out and twisted it to the hot side.
"Well I have both ears and time." She joked sitting down next to him, her hands resting on the black marble. "I also have the house." She stated for him, so he wouldn't be worried about her parents overhearing.
Lucius' tea floated to him from the kitchen as Severus leaned closer to Harry. "He doesn't have any injuries?"
Harry, bewildered, only shook his head in response. Narcissa was becoming more and more surprising every minute.
"It's a little late for that," Severus said. The man closed the book he was reading, his finger holding his place. "You might as well be cramming for a test. If you really do need help in your classes then I will help you at Hogwarts. We can meet up once a week for tutoring if you wish."
They were always blunt with each other. So blunt they scared others. Even Remus. James couldn't help his surprise though. He hadn't expected Sirius to argue. The situation was too volatile for an argument. "It's my so-"
The gryffindor let himself breathe in, then out, before nodding. It was his way on confirming that he had heard Snape and understood. It was also Harry's way of telling the man that Harry hadn't forgiven him yet.
When Harry had let it slip, he had expected Draco to be angry or laugh, but the boy had slid over the topic like it wasn't breached. At the same time that Harry appreciated his actions, he also hated them. Harry, for whatever reason, wanted someone, anyone, to be angry for him.
"Red is not a gryffindor color. Red is its own color." Draco argued turning back to his nightstand. He grabbed his clock from the top and began to fiddle with it. "If you believe I'll let you gryffindorks ruin my favorite color, you're mistaken."
Hermione laughed, "That's not it works Draco. A ghost can't haunt another ghost. We'll be haunting each other."
"So that's what was on your mind." It a statement. Narcissa had known that something as trivial as Harry not wanting to meet his friends would not keep Draco down. "I believe that is up to Harry."
"Boy! Wheres my dinner?!" Vernon exclaimed as he stomped up the stairs. Harry was tired, so incredibly tired of listening to Vernon's foul mouth speak. He just wanted it to end, all of it. Even his own life.
The woman on the floor disappeared and Harry stared at his once bloodstained hand for a long moment before running it through his hair. He pulled it back into view as if expecting the blood to reappear before shaking his head, numbly, as he saw it clean.
"Malfoys?" Harry asked as he began to rub in the salve. The effect was immediate and he nodded to Snape in thanks.
Was it with the light? The light who abandoned him to the Dursleys every summer, not that he had told the Weasleys or Hermione.  Harry had told Dumbledore though. "Harry, a punishment is a punishment. You must have deserved it." Would the Malfoys feel the same way? Would the dark?
Considering that Harry hadn't received a tour of the house yet and only knew about the gardens, his room, Draco's room, and the dining room, Draco couldn't help but assume that Harry would be in his room. Of course, things with the gryffindor are never as easy as they appear to be.
"Of course," Harry continued. He couldn't stop himself anymore. He had exposed himself to them. Had shown Lily something he never dared to reveal before. How would James hurt him when given the chance? "I'm not your precious son now am I."
Draco realizing Pansy was right stood up and moved to his much preferred red armchair. "Damn thing doesn't go with the furniture."
"What are you doing back this early?" Harry asked trying to appear normal. He hoped that Draco would let it slip by, unmentioned.
"The boy isn't stupid, Severus. If he's been beaten his whole life, then I think he would be able to predict his own healing time. He might notice if they don't heal any faster."
When Severus had fully left the room, Draco looked questionably at Harry was only shrugged in response with a shake of his head. Draco huffed before putting his hand out for Harry, "I guess he's just in one of those moods. We need to get to dinner or my mother will throw another fit. She nearly chewed my father's ear off when you skipped out on breakfast and lunch."
"Why," harry asked. "Why would it matter to you? The boy who found happiness in my misery! Why don't you just gloat Malfoy? I mean this show that you have been putting on since Lucius saved my life! Why? I don't understand. Why pretend when you can outright hate me!" Harry's voice escalated as he continued. All of his settlements at their treatment, all of his insecurities rising to the surface.
Harry grimaced and shuffled from one foot to the other as Narcissa motioned for him to put the plate back down. He did. "Harry has finished eating. Can you take his plate back to the kitchen and have it cleaned." Her words were formed into a question but her tone left only one possible answer. Harry wished he had lied and agreed with Narcissa earlier.
Remus and Sirius had no clue, to the best of Harry's knowledge. Harry had been concerned when he heard they wouldn't be taking him in. He wondered if they had figured it out and been disgusted, but they explained later on that Dumbledore felt it best that Harry remain with the Dursleys. While the two hugged Harry on a regular basis, at least when they met, they had never messed with Harry's arms or felt a scar.
Draco gave a shout of victory as he stood up, "So you admit you didn't have it with you when they attacked."
"Because you're having tomorrow off. No classes, no homework. She wanted to let you know, but couldn't find you, apparently." Not that it is difficult for Harry to disappear when he wants to, with his map and the cloak, it is actually surprising that he doesn’t do it more often. Ron isn’t about to jinx himself for thinking that.
"I will skin you," Draco replies blandly as he continues running his hands up and down Harry’s arms. In spite of the warmth, Harry’s so cold, and bony, and Draco’s hands aren’t much better. Still, Harry seems to like it. Harry is currently sitting between his legs, with his back against Draco’s chest. The contact sends a burst of warmth through his stomach, like taking a sip of hot chocolate on a cold, snowy December evening, except the feeling never ends.
"It wasn't my fault, Rosier, come off your high horse," says Dolohov.  "I did what my lord asked of me, whether it didn't work out or not isn't my problem. I did my duties."
Draco pats his cheek again, “Potter,” his pats get slightly rougher as Draco starts panicking a little, “Potter, wake up.”
He can't leave Harry's blood just lying around. That's so much worse than a shoe. He stops when he’s sure there’s nothing salvageable left of the shoe, and the only blood he can see is horribly contaminated or indistinguishable from Rosier's. He tightens his grip around Harry.
So Draco just sighs and watches Harry beat the eggs, a pan heating on the stove, Draco's fingers are interlaced under his chin as he rests his elbows on the table. Very inelegant etiquette, but he doesn’t think Harry would really care.
Hedwig seems to sense the tension in the air, because she quiets down too, settling on top of the mantle place.
"But aren't they--" Draco purses his lips and then cringes, "What I was about to say sounds incredibly bad now."
-None of that with me, Draco Malfoy. I met you when you were barely out of diapers. You can’t hide ANYTHING from me!
And then, suddenly, she looked at him, right in the eyes. And, in a voice so low Harry could almost think he imagined it, she murmured:
-No but, it’s true! insisted Draco. I’m not saying that because I am drunk, although I am, but… You’re just both SO fucking important to me. There were so many times where I just could not have survived without you. Oh God, if something happened to you… I don’t know what I’d do…
Harry turned towards him quickly and grabbed his arm, shaking him strongly to get him out of his sleep. Once he managed to wake him up, Draco opened his eyes, and Harry felt a pang in his chest. Draco’s eyes were terribly lost, puffy, red and terrified. Even though he was awake, he was still clinging to the sheets, his body shaking even more intensely than before. Actually, even his sobs had not calmed down. Everything had just became horribly silent.
And when Pansy came under his mouth, he ignored his burning eyes, and the feeling, way too intense, of vertigo from within.
Calling his name had been a good idea. He raised his eyes, and suddenly, he seemed to forget completely his plan to avoid his look.
Well… Not tonight. Tonight, they were wearing fancy clothes. The restaurant Harry had chosen was one of the most expensive in Great Britain. Sometimes, it had to have some utility to be rich, didn’t it?
Harry woke up in a start, and it took him less than one second to understand what had gotten him out of his sleep. Beside him, Draco was clinging to the blanket, kicking all around him, rolling over in his sleep, his body covered in sweat. He was screaming and sobbing so loud his voice was getting hoarse.
So, obviously, Harry found great pleasure in wearing them as often as possible, to force him to admit (almost under torture, but still) that they did give him a really sexy ass.
And, without further ado, he grabbed her behind the neck and kissed her. When they pushed away, a few seconds later, they both looked pensive.
When Pansy finally found Draco, he was sitting on the ground, in a corner of the second floor’s girls bathroom, his shirt completely soaked through and his hair horribly messy. His face was shining with tears and he was sobbing so intensely his whole body was shaking, but he was doing so in perfect silence.
The food was delicious, even though Draco spent the whole time eating it complaining about it not deserving the price they paid for it. He was like that, Draco. Even when drunk on happiness, he couldn’t stop himself from complaining at least a little.
"Don't talk about it here." James interrupted. "We'll go to my rooms to discuss it. Sirius you should get looked at by Poppy."
Harry wants to laugh at that, but he stops himself. "No, it's okay. I can do it myself." He doesn't think about it. He just applies the glamour. It isn't until her eyes widen that he realizes his own mistake.
"Harry its not here." Snape confirmed. "It wasn't with you when Lucius found you. He looked around for a bit but couldn't find it."
"So if I got your permission, then I could do it." Draco smirked watching as Harry tested his legs and stretched.
"It would be good for you, harry." Snape agreed with Lucius cutting his pancakes. Neither him nor Lucius were certain how Narcissa would react to be alone with Harry.
For the first time since Severus saw him on the stoop, he looked over at Harry Potter on his couch. "The Dark lord?"
Draco found himself stepping into the fireplace an hour later and meeting Pansy for the first time as himself. Draco Malfoy wasn't the narcissistic bloke who wanted to please the dark lord anymore even if he still sneered because of habit sometimes. Pansy made sure he knew that.
Draco smiles cruelly. "I'm sorry what was that? You do know mumbling is frowned upon in high society, don't you know? Or do you not have parents to teach you such a thing."
"How about you bring Harry with you. He could use a bit of time out of the house." Lucius offered with a look in his eye.
It's not much of an explanation, but it's all that Severus needs. "You went to a muggle town? Coincidentally the one near Harr-this boy's residence?"
"And if it caused later damage to the eye? How would you know?" Snape asked as he moved his wand toward Harry. He whispered a spell so low he could barely hear it.
"Dumbledore?" Narcissa asked curiously. Her eyes narrowed as she evaluated Harry but, he refused to look up. "I think he is a fool. I also think he considers life to be a game of chess and not the welfare and survival of his fellow wizards."
"I was nearby when it happened." Lucius starts as he sits in the armchair. He sighs and waves his wand, dishes moving into place as he begins to brew tea. Severus never offered him any even when Lucius came by with permission. "Narcissa and I fought this morning."
Horcruxes can be placed in living things, but the horcrux is destroyed when they die so this method is not preferred. To this day, there isn't a known way to separate a horcrux from the object it is put into as the magic is banned and rarely seen in action.
Her voice faltered and Harry nodded at her, encouragingly, despite the fact that she couldn't see him. He decided he liked the way the red and silver flowers looked against the blue and began to order them.
In a way, Harry considered himself to be a mark. A mark on the Dursleys. A mark on the Weasleys'. Even to a certain extent, a mark on the Malfoy family. It seemed that no matter what the boy did, wherever he went became tarnished. The more Harry thought about it, the more the idea stuck.
Harry Potter lifted his head as his eyes snapped open. A hand reached up to rub his eye trying to wipe away what he had seen, but it didn't work. Eventually Harry let his hand drop into his lap the dead woman still lying on the floor before him. Ruby red hair covering her face in a mock imitation of a mask or last act of kindness.
Harry's eyes narrowed at the wall of books. Averting his gaze came naturally to him, Vernon had enforced it. "Not entirely, sir."
So this was it. This was what it was like be friends with the Harry Potter. The chosen one. The boy who lived. The boy who Draco might just be falling in love with. "nargles?" Draco asked. He really hadn't heard of such a thing though the boy had to admit that he really hadn't been listening. He had been lost somewhere around Neville Longbottem when Harry's eyes started to sparkle.
"Birds of Paradise? I thought these were Crane flowers." Harry replied detached as he caressed a petal.
The syltherin's eyes were crinkled and tired, a completely different look from the one that Harry had grown used too. "You missed a lot last night. My mother wanted to apologize to you personally, but when she sent Poppy to check on you, you were already asleep. She didn't mean what she said Potter."
Harry, taking this as a dismissal, picked up his plate and stood up. Narcissa looked at him curiously before smiling and when Harry looked at Draco, the boy looked curious, too. "What is it?"
"Harry only flinches." Lucius continued for him. Severus nodded and waved his wand in the direction of the kitchen, calling two mugs of tea to the table. They settled themselves on a couple of magazines and Severus picked them up. He moved them to a clear spot before shuffling the books into a pile.
Yea, see it feels kinda empty and useless. But, my friend who beta reads for me said it was good. Oh yea! Next chapter is gonna have fluff and half of it from Lucius's pov or Severus's. However, the fluff will be drarry... If I make it lucius and severus fluff I gotta tell ya it'll be friendly fluff. In this fanfic I love Narcissa and Lucius together so I can't that. Wow, I've taken up space.
Harry saw the tree in the backyard that Marge's dog had chased him up. It's once prideful branches were bowed because one of them was stuck under rubble. They passed the police line without any trouble and Harry heard Lucius's feet break some board as he maneuvered onto the pile.
"I think I am," Harry replied, unsure. He had never been asked if he was happy with something before.
They seemed to look up at him, unashamedly as if they didn't care about the pain they had inflected upon him and Harry found himself tearing another one right down the middle. The fabric tore easily, a stark reminder of how he was treated at the Dursley's; a stark reminder of how little they had cared.
He shouldn't say that. Shouldn't reprimand James for something he didn't do. Yet, he can't think properly. It was all crumbling again. Returning to Hogwarts; to Dumbledore and his lies.
Harry blushed and nodded. He made his escape from Draco's room, hearing Draco's light chuckle behind him.
"Leaving it alone won't teach this child his place! Children are meant to be taken care of not given responsibilities."
"As if I would believe that. Show me your arms." Harry looks pointedly at Snape when he says this, knowing the man bears the mark.
"Yes, Harry." Snape continued, still not noticing his use of Harry's first name, "Luckily Mr. Malfoy was called to join the raid. By the time he arrived, your house was in ruins and he thought you were dead. He pulled a couple of boards up wanting to confirm your death before he left and found you under one.
Snape rubbed his head and Lucius finally spoke, "What happened to you, Harry? How much do you remember?" As the realization dawned on Harry he wondered if he should tell the truth. That it wasn't the death eaters who almost beat him to death but his uncle. That he was happy they were dead and he wouldn't have to go back anymore.
This didn't happen before her. When Harry was in elementary school, he had a teacher named Ms. Mable. She would pull him aside after class, asking him how he was and if Dudley was bullying him again. She was nice.
Harry's lip lifted at the corner and he tilted his head to the side as if he were considering it. "You might be right but I like it."
He pulled it out and reached his hand even father back before his hand found the worn out brown suitcase that stowed his wand and magic items. Grinning he dug it out of the pile and opening it, pulled his wand out.
"Just a couple things." He said looking at Severus who tapped her foot under the table. She startled and then smiled.
Draco sighed and threw away his apple. Pansy might be right. The story was plausible, but Potter lied before that. He followed Pansy into the living room and collapsed onto a purple armchair in thought.
"Shut up!" Harry yelled at the portraits. "It doesn't matter anymore. I haven't been a child for years so, just, shut up."
"Morning Pansy." Draco called out as he stepped out of the fireplace. He waved at her place on the couch before walking to the kitchen. "Did you not eat breakfast?" She called back, probably in the middle of a book.
Harry watched them leave as much as he could from his position until Lucius closed the door behind them. "Are they always like that?"
A/N: I didn't think anything through when I first started this and now it's all biting me in the butt. So I went back and revived Sirius. I only mentioned his death once so it wasn't a super big change, especially since I didn't really write the way it had effected Harry properly anyway. Honestly, I'm kinda irritated with myself because it was so easy to fix. So this is based in sixth year, HOWEVER neither Sirius nor Dumbledore died. I'm not quite certain what happened in my version of fifth year, but it is not important at the moment and will be decided later. So just gotta know this is sixth year which means everyone is like 16 to 17 years old (I really didn't want to start a romance with some of them being 15, didn't feel right) and soooo Umbridge is the DADA teacher in my version of sixth year and Dumbledore, who did NOT die, is still the headmaster. Yea...
Harry could not keep himself from laughing. The situation was frankly absurd. Why on Earth did Draco insist so much on him keeping this stupid piece of fabric over his eyes anyway?
He nodded. Then, he whispered something, so low he probably was talking to himself. But she heard him anyway.
It happened to them more and more often. Moments where they did not even use their false hatred to talk: where they would just do it, just like that. Because they wanted to.
-How many times do I have to say it, for Fuck’s sake? I know what you lived through, I know what your dad did. I know you were both Death Eaters, and that the proof of that is still on your arm. I know I’ll never be able to understand even one percent of the horrors you had to endure. And I DON’T CARE. I don’t care, alright? I do not give a fuck about any of that. I’m with you because I want to, and that’s it. That’s it. NOTHING will change that. Are we clear?
This time, it was Pansy who kissed his temple, and Harry who smiled. Then, he offered, his voice loud to cover the music:
-What are you talking about? asked Draco, who’d been to the toilet until then, unaware of his marital future being decided behind his back.
When he arrived at the end of the corridor, Harry was out of breath. Draco stuck his tongue out at him, laughing like crazy, but he was out of breath too.
Draco had begun hyperventilating, pacing the room at a frightening speed. Since he was breathing and moving faster and faster every second, Pansy got up too and walked to him, taking his arm in her hand and forcing him to look at her.
Which, to say the truth, was kind of the case. Her work made Pansy spend three quarters of her life in France and, between his love relationship and his own work, Draco was rarely free when Pansy was in England.
-Pans… If you wanted to stay hidden, you maybe should have chosen another location. Like… Not my bed.
Pansy rolled on her stomach, and leaned her chin on her hand, watching her best friend, who was doing everything he could to escape her staring gaze. So much, in fact, that she had to take his face in her left hand to force him to look at her.
He could not say he felt okay. No… Far from it. But yet… Something had changed. He was hurting, of course. And had not gained any will to live. But despite everything, he felt more… Calm. More serene.
And then he got her shirt off. She threw his t-shirt away. The cold air made him shiver, and he almost told her they had to stop. But their mouths met again, and he just couldn’t.
Harry bit his lip, seemingly embarrassed, and Pansy rolled her eyes. But, when Draco took both of their hands and silently asked them to take each other’s hands too, they did it. And, when Draco asked:
-I have no idea what you’re talking about. Insulting each other is what we’ve always done. I don’t see why that would suddenly change.
Pansy entered the restaurant like a tornado. Draco, sitting at his table, sent her a reprobating loo, but the smile stretching on his lips made it less convincing. Pansy waved at him with enthusiasm, then she made her way through the small crowd waiting to order to join him at the table. He got up and they hugged as if they had not seen each other in an eternity.
-You’ll be in Slytherin, she assured. And even if it wasn’t the case, it wouldn’t be that bad. Your parents would be mad for a few weeks, top, and it would end. You know that.
Frankly annoyed at the intervention, Draco turned to Pansy, who was laying on his bed, hand supporting her head.
Draco had just broken the silence. Pansy looked at him from the corner of her eyes, taking a puff of her cigarette.
Next step, normally, would be to wait until he stopped sobbing. But tonight, this moment did not seem to be coming.
-You have to swear it, insisted Draco. Promise that, whatever happens, we’ll be there. I’ll be there for you. You’ll be there for me. And you’ll be there for each other.
But she didn’t show it. She did as she always did: she sat beside him, put an arm around his neck, hugged him almost until he couldn’t breathe. Started playing softly with his hair, muttering nice things in his ear.
-I love you, he repeated, less loudly this time. Pansy got closer to him, pointing to her ear to show she had not heard, and he repeated it a third time.
Harry jumped again, but an immense smile stretched out on his lips. It had been a very long time since the last time he felt so happy.
Shit. Harry usually always won. In their small improvised matches one on one like this one as well as in the real ones. But this time, Draco was way closer to the Snitch than he was. Even with all the strength of his Firebolt and all of his flying talent, he wasn’t sure he could beat him.
Draco sighed, but, less than two seconds later, he was telling her everything, eyes bright and surexcited.
He turned to face her, slowly, his hand still in hers. Her eyes, black like the night, were gazing in his, and she caressed his cheek to push a tear away.
Her voice was hoarse and low. He wanted to ask her what she was sorry for. But he feared his voice may break in the middle of the sentence, or not even make it out of his chest.
Hearing these words, Daphné screamed indignantly and ran out of the room, crying loudly. Astoria followed her silently.
He seemed startled too, and avoided his eyes, his cheeks crimson red. But he visibly forced himself to talk.
But when he closed his eyes, it wasn’t her mouth he saw between his legs. Not her hair he imagined diving his hand into.
He leaned on his broom, giving everything he had. He even tried to reach in front of him, stretching at his maximum, even though he was still meters away from the Snitch.
With Draco, there were lots of different kinds of mornings. Hot mornings, where they had sex until losing reason. Grumpy mornings, where Draco almost didn’t talk to him at all and where they almost always ended up arguing over stupidities. And cuddly mornings. Apparently, this was one of them.
He was suddenly very serious. At the same time, on each side of him, Pansy and Harry both put a hand on his upper arms. Harry at his left, Pansy at his right.
They kept at it for several minutes. Until Hermione, seeming quite cross with him, rushed into Harry and dragged him away from Malfoy against his will.
-Yes, yes, we protect one another. We protect each other, us three. We’re there for each other. We’ll always be there for each other, right?
-I was… At the Manor… With Voldemort… I was a Death Eater, I was torturing people… He forced me to. There was you, and Pans, and my mom… He made me torture you… You were screaming, and screaming, but I couldn’t stop… I was under Impero… And then, I was not torturing you anymore, but countless of innocent people, who did not have faces. He was menacing me, saying he would kill you, and my dad too, if I was not obedient… I killed Dumbledore… And…
Harry jumped. He had thought he’d be alone in this hallway. Actually, he came here especially to be alone. He was always surrounded by people, these last few days. Even Ron and Hermione’s presences were hard to bear. He desperately needed some alone time. Needed to run away from all those grateful looks, when he himself felt so guilty. Because, in the middle of all those faces looking up at him with so much respect, love, devotion, admiration or friendship, there were holes. Holes that should have been filled with other faces, other looks, other smiles. The ones of all those innocents who were dead, because of him.
But no. It was useless. Not even two meters in front of him, Draco was smiling at him, triumphant. The Golden Snitch in his right hand.
They were standing in front of one of the big windows of the corridor, looking at the park and the lake behind. Draco sighed.
Right now, their discussion was not light and fun like it usually was, though. It was real. Intense. Profound.
And, indeed, he pointed his wand at the floor, and, suddenly, Harry felt his feet rise from the ground. He was startled, really not expecting that. He had no idea what spell Draco was using to make them rise like that.
They had answered almost exactly at the same second. It made them laugh, and Harry soon joined them in their hilarity.
Draco was feeling a bit strange. He was both excessively happy and strangely sad. His head was spinning, but not in a bad way. He was clinging to Harry, holding him close, and was a little disoriented when his boyfriend took a step back, smiled at him and yelled over the music:
Draco looked at the pale and skinny child standing in front of him. With an expression of pure disgust, he snarled:
-We’ll pretend I was his wife, she insisted sternly. It’s only logical. Astoria’s way too young. Pansy, too.
