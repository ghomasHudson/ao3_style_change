Harry has withheld himself from having any expectations, but even he is stunned by what he sees.
During the post-match review, Snape hit Draco across the head with a folded newspaper in front of the entire club.
“It’s a small world after all,” Remus remarked lightly.
predicament of mine. You're incredibly kind to everyone so perhaps I'm just another colleague to you."
In the middle of Draco’s internal musings, there was a knock on the door.
“You’re entering my private domain. Not even the Federation knows what I’m doing here. At least, not yet,” Draco declares proudly, bringing them to another large door. He presses his palm on a panel which pulls back the doors, allowing them to go through.
Draco seemed to be enjoying himself more than usual, the absence of sight making his other senses sharper. His kisses were hungrier, his touches more demanding and the
Inhaling sharply, Draco releases Harry’s chin and swats Harry’s hand away. “Fine. I’ve waited ages for you. I suppose I can do a couple more hours,” he declares airily, sitting back.
“Oh look, Malfoy has the same number as you,” Hermione remarked, pointing. The players wore dark green and white sleeveless jerseys. Each player’s surname was written on the back, while their number was written both on the front and the back. Draco was number 11, while Ron was number 10.
Harry only realised he had also been affected when he tried to speak.
“You’ve been present in many of my wet dreams,” he says, reaching out to touch Draco’s hair, “which have become more and more frequent since we started working together.”
“So now you take the bus to go to places.”
I didn’t mean to
you in my life. If you would have me in yours.”
“The Captain is unfortunately occupied at the moment,” Lieutenant Commander Blaise Zabini explains pleasantly as all of them step out into the brightly lit hallway. “He will be ready for you in about an hour.”
An hour later, he jogs across the Entrance Hall, where Draco is seated on a stone bench near the large doors, arms and legs crossed.
“Assuming your victim was poisoned with only one dose, from the size of your broken vial, I estimate maximum three millilitres,” Draco began as he moved quickly around the room, grabbing utensils and dropping them next to an empty cauldron. “Not many potions can knock a person out with that small volume, even fewer cause magic depletion.”
Did Harry find Draco infuriating as hell? Yes, very much so.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “What do you mean?”
Draco started to detect something was wrong with himself.
Harry stared at his hands long after Narcissa and Ron had left, feeling the weight of trust placed upon him.
The envelope looked harmless amidst his Potions notes, but he cast
"That's exactly what we should talk about."
, dressed in his red and gold Captain uniform and flanked by his two trusted officers – Dean and Seamus – he’s miffed that it isn’t the Captain who greets him, but one of his youngest Commanders.
Good thing he had a fan to cover his face with.
but what came out was, “You’re vile to look at.”
Now as a man, Malfoy was nothing like when he was a teenager. In fact, ever since becoming an Auror, Malfoy kept mostly to himself. He was passive during managerial meetings but diligent and brilliant when it came to actual Auror work. He never joined social gatherings at the office. He kept quiet whenever people called him ‘
“Okay.” Harry rubbed his ears next. They were still warm. “Thanks, Malfoy.”
Harry messed up his landing; Ron caught him and guided him towards the couch. He hadn’t realised that his mind was getting groggy, which served him right for downing all that wine so fast. Now, away from the crowd and in the privacy of his own home, he allowed himself to relax and opened the floodgates of his emotions. He felt weary, miserable and frustrated.
"So, um, see you around?” he said, eyes darting at the blond, who gave him a quick nod.
“July thirty-first,” Harry said, turning his body and full attention to Draco. “I saw you yesterday.”
Draco carefully slid off the motorcycle and returned the helmet to Harry. He caught his reflection in one of the rearview mirrors and frowned at the state of his hair, making Harry laugh.
“The poison kills a person’s magical core?” Harry read the passage incredulously.
“If I stay,” Harry said softly, giving Draco a look that was so open and earnest, it made the blond blush, “can I kiss you again?”
Zabini’s dark skin takes on an odd colouring as he flushes angrily. After a long moment, he spits out, “Allow me to check with the Captain.”
The notion of being forced to stop doing something he enjoyed made Draco go cold all over, as though he was dunked in a well of iced water.
“Oh God, Harry, what did you tell Malfoy that changed the second half so much?” Hermione asked, eyes wide.
going to stand naked in a barrel full of eels!”
Out of nowhere, Ron appeared. "Mate, you okay? Do you want me to take you home?"
“I’m Draco Malfoy," he said, hoping his anxiety wasn’t obvious. "Nice to meet you.”
“I told you it’s safe,” Harry remarked cheekily, lifting the visor of his helmet.
“I fancy you,” Harry said after catching his breath. “Will you go out with me?”
Draco would have rolled his eyes if they weren’t bandaged. “Clearly, you have to feed me.”
Draco lied across the couch, a free hand idly combing his own hair. “Would you like me to call often?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and carried the briefcase to the writing desk. While he worked, Harry washed the dishes and cleaned the kitchen. While preparing for breakfast, Harry had discovered that the pantry had a large selection of food and baking appliances. Maybe he should experiment with more dishes. Maybe bake something? Didn't Malfoy say he wanted Harry to cook for him every day?
“Currently, there is no definite treatment for spattergroit,” Healer Kim continued. “We have potions to control the symptoms but the spores themselves will be excreted from the body naturally in ten days. Transmissibility reduces to practically zero after two weeks. I have just discussed with Head Auror Robards that I recommend both of you to be isolated and quarantined for that duration.”
“For assignments, you will be required to discuss with your partners, but each submission must be made individually,” Professor Scrimgeour explained when all students were paired up. “So don’t even think of slacking off! Today, your assignment will be about The Ten Fundamental Principles of Economics.”
Draco decided for him and sat on the bed, which was closer. Just being away from the living room calmed him down and this room, which smelled so much like Harry, made him comfortable. He caught sight of several photo frames on the bedside table. Between the photo of Harry with his two best friends and a photo of Harry with Remus and Sirius was a slightly discoloured photo of a man who looked like an older version of Harry and a beautiful woman with long ginger red hair.
Now it was Draco’s turn to blush. “Yes, so I’d rather just continue with my existence on my own, thank you very much.”
“Why not?”
Harry felt a strong gust of wind blow against his face. When he looked back, there was a red bubble around Draco's head. The bubble looked different from the usual Bubble-Head Charm, which simply allowed a person to breathe normally. This red bubble appeared to be actively
“You must be out of your mind to be willing to deal with all this.”
Ron wrapped his arms tightly around Hermione, smiling widely for the first time that day. "Sorry we're late," he said, elbowing Harry's arm. "This guy forgot to set his alarm clock again."
Harry notes the sensual way Draco articulates that last word. “The Second Cockpit is yours.”
Draco’s cheeks felt warm. “Impossible.”
“I do want you.” Harry withdrew slightly and brushed a hand against Draco’s cheek. “I want you
Just seconds before, the man was protesting like a child. Now he was looking at Draco so earnestly; it gave him whiplash. He avoided his partner’s gaze while he huffed, “I’m fine. What’s going on?”
With a big smile, Potter waved at him before Apparating. Draco swore that man had no idea how attractive he was. He should stop smiling all the time. It gave Draco funny sensations in his stomach.
"Didn't we survive a war too?" Harry quipped, earning a frustrated growl from the other wizard. "Draco, please look at me."
When Ron slipped out of the booth to play some darts with Dean and Seamus, neither of them noticed. They kept on talking, their heads so close they were almost touching.
'Iso', Harry quickly learned, was short for 'isolation room'. His was a small room with an even smaller ensuite bathroom. There was a single lonely bed and a small cabinet to store his belongings, which was useless right now because Harry had brought nothing with him from the safe house. Thankfully, he had his wand, and he used a Patronus to send a message to Ron.
“I happen to remember you said there’s nothing you can learn from a beach game,” he teased, delighted when Draco abruptly pulled back and pouted in indignation. “That’s a tall order. You think you can handle it?”
"—Economic Principle lecture?"
“Malfoy!” Weasley yelled from about twenty metres away. “You’re going the wrong way!”
“I hope it is up to your standards,” said Draco, removing his jacket and making his way towards the kitchen as though he owned the place. “It was the only one the shop had.”
Malfoy hit Harry's head with a cushion. “I wanted to eat that, you berk!"
– and earns himself baffled looks from Seamus and Dean.
Teddy nods, gripping Uncle Harry’s trousers.
“Unlike volleyball, Harry, basketball is a timed game. Each game is divided into 4 quarters; each quarter is 10 minutes. The team that scores the most points within that time limit wins the game. Any scores made from inside the three-point line,” she pointed at the wide semi-circle around each of the basket poles, “is worth two points while any shots made from outside the line are worth three.”
Potter climbed into Draco’s bed, clad in only a pair of shorts and a T-shirt. “Are you afraid of people finding out about us?” he asked, his warm body pressed to Draco’s side.
“Your upper limbs are attractive as well,” Draco added. “So is your face. And the rest of you. Anyway! Thank you for the ride home.”
revealed that it was almost 2 AM. Keeping still, Draco listened closely for any odd noises.
Malfoy lifts his head and listens silently for a second, as though to make sure Madam Pomfrey has indeed left. Then he goes back to leaning against Harry.
Potter shared with Draco what he had been up to. After the trials, he hadn’t enrolled in any universities like Draco had, choosing instead to travel the world. He had just returned to Britain when he sent Draco the first letter. He said his travels taught him things — he didn’t elaborate what — and all he wanted to do now was make amends with Draco and get to know him better.
“One. Initiating Apparition.” In tandem, the twins pull on their controls.
"Don't give up on what makes you happy too soon," she said gently. "I haven't seen The Chosen Git since Hogwarts but from your stories and from what the entire Wizarding World knows about him, I have an idea of how he is. He may be a bit daft, but I can tell he really likes you."
“The pains of being a celebrity.” Malfoy sighs dramatically. “I thought by now the tabloids would find newer, fresher stories to chase instead of your sex life.”
“Gentlemen.” Healer Kim raised her hands, palms out in a placating manner. “Calm down. From our assessment, aside from the spores in your system, both of you are perfectly healthy. Your vitals are all stable. Neither of you has any comorbidities or other diseases that could complicate the treatment. After running our tests, my team agreed that quarantine is the best option. Don’t worry, though. You are still under my care. I will review you every morning.”
Draco felt overwhelmed. He barely knew most of these people, he had never talked to them before today, but they treated him like he had always been part of their family. They spoke freely with him, spurting insane amounts of information Draco never asked for, and showing genuine interest in Draco's opinions. Draco struggled to keep up.
Shrugging on Sirius’ old jacket, Harry walked to where his motorcycle, another gift from his godfather, was parked. He switched his round-rimmed spectacles with a pair of prescription motorcycle glasses before putting on his helmet.
Captain Malfoy notices Harry’s hesitation and instead adds, “I see my son hasn’t informed you that your ship needs to be anchored to mine during jumps?”
"Thank you," Draco said after they separated, "for coming for me."
Not wanting to let Weasley mess with his shot again, he tossed as soon as he was within range. In his rush, his grip on the ball faltered and caused his shot to lose its usual power. The ball fell short, bouncing off the rim.
“Then I’ll stay,” Harry promised with a smile, pecking the corner of Draco’s mouth, “for as long as you’ll have me.”
It was Harry who withdrew to kiss Draco's jaw and whisper in his ear. “Draco, I'll stop if you tell me to." His voice was low, like a growl and it
Teddy watches Draco’s nimble fingers work, entranced. Uncle Harry is just as silent and probably just as mesmerized.
before handing it to Potter, who accepted it gratefully.
were the exact words Potter wrote.
“Back then, we were meeting again after almost ten years.” Harry smiles at the memory; he can still remember the forest green robes Draco wore when they first linked eyes in the Great Hall on their first day as Hogwarts professors. “You’re… you’re different now, yet still the same. You still draw me in and capture my attention, and I can’t help but… be obsessed with you.” He chuckles at the last few words, sheepish.
In the kitchen, Harry realised that they had not cleared up where Harry would sleep. Since Malfoy had quickly claimed the bed, Harry assumed he would be taking the couch. That would probably be best. Malfoy had been Harry’s partner for only six months, but Harry knew that Malfoy could be nasty when he was angry. His silent treatments were terrible too. Harry was always left wondering what he had done wrong. He hadn’t figured out how to handle a silently seething Draco Malfoy yet. So far, the only thing that had worked for Harry was to keep being nice to Malfoy until he cooled down on his own.
selfish, I reckon.”
A safe distance away, Draco sat on a bench with his back leaned against the wall, arms and legs crossed. His gaze was transfixed on Harry. Draco would never profess this out loud, but Harry was an excellent teacher. He had a stern, commanding presence but he was also gentle and patient.
The first time Harry and Draco kissed, they had just solved their first case together. Harry dragged Draco to a pub, and after several rounds of drinks in a booth, the alcohol loosened Draco's tongue and reduced his inhibitions. Before they knew it, they were making out right in the booth, unhidden, out in the open for anyone to see.
"Sure, you can't talk about your job. But you're more than that."
"Even after I helped you solve
As soon as Draco flops onto the Captain's Chair, a hologram panel appears in front of him. There are no seats for Harry, so he stands next to Draco. Seamus and Dean flank the door.
Malfoy lets go and wipes his face agitatedly. He is no longer touching Harry; his body immediately starts shivering. "I thought you liked me. Do you like me only when it's convenient?"
"About what?"
“I like playing alone,” Draco said, looking down at the book in his lap to avoid eye contact.
Draco tore his gaze away from Potter’s muscular thighs and forced himself to look into a pair of brilliant green eyes instead. They weren’t blocked behind those ugly glasses this time; Draco was amazed he found his voice quickly enough to explain, “You were having a nightmare. You wouldn’t wake up.”
him - but he could never figure out what. And Malfoy was always there, because Harry actively sought him out, purposely coming to work early because he knew that was the time Malfoy arrived at work. He told Malfoy stories because he liked having Malfoy listen with that cool, blank expression of his, even if the other man rarely contributed to the stories. Malfoy still called him nicknames like ‘The Chosen One’ or ‘The Saviour’, but unlike when they were children, the names never sounded condescending. Malfoy made them sound so matter-of-fact, Harry didn’t mind them. He could listen to Malfoy say his name or monikers all day.
Harry then introduced Draco to the other man. “This is my godfather, Sirius.”
“Don’t flatter yourself,” Draco snapped.
Of all the responses Draco anticipated, this was not one of them. “I beg your pardon?”
Potter laughed, letting him go. "You're early. I didn't expect you to be here before bedtime."
Davies accepted the handshake easily, barely giving Draco a second look. Draco wondered if he had done something wrong.
When he snaps out of his reverie, Harry finds himself leaning forwards with his nose buried in Malfoy’s hair and his breaths ghosting over Malfoy’s warm nape. He jerks back with a sharp inhale.
“I believe
"I don't care how you know my father," he hissed through gritted teeth, "but keep him off the court."
Draco had assumed Harry would be dropping him back, so he nodded. “Alright.”
Annoying Lucius had indeed been Draco’s intention, and he had gotten as far as getting Pansy to accompany him to the store, but he had chickened out after the first piercing. Repeating the process with his right ear hadn’t been necessary, because wearing only one earring was enough to make Lucius give him the silent treatment for weeks. The peace and quiet, while it lasted, had been worth the pain.
“Indeed you are,” Draco agreed, smiling playfully.
Harry wonders if this is against any Federation rules. He is pretty sure this is fair game. He isn’t Draco’s captain. They do not share the same chain of command and are part of different crews. The only person who could potentially take offense is Lucius Malfoy, which doesn’t scare Harry.
"Take the yellow potion every morning before 11 o'clock. It has antifungal properties. The pink potion is for local application only. Only use it if you develop pustules. Apply several drops directly on them and the pustules should disappear instantly without any scarring. Please make sure you and your partner do not miss the antifungal, even if you feel perfectly fine."
. He bowed deeply at Draco, the tip of his nose touching his toes. "Kreacher would be honoured to be cooking for Mister Malfoy, descendant of the Noble House of Black. What would Mister Malfoy be wishing to eat?"
The first week of the semester had been exhausting, so when Draco suggested they order food for dinner, Harry happily dialled for pizza delivery. They sat on the floor, a large box of pepperoni pizza between them, as they talked.
Uncle Harry starts to grumble but stops when the man places a gentle hand on Uncle Harry’s arm.
"Gentlemen," she greeted. "I'm afraid I have some grave news for you. We grew the spores you two inhaled in our lab and studied the fungus. We have identified several protein receptors that could cause worrying symptoms, namely loss of consciousness and respiratory muscles paralysis.”
"Draco?" he asked, receiving a grunt in response. "When was your first kiss?"
“Why not?”
Sitting up, Harry rubbed the spot and was relieved to feel only smooth skin.
His motorcycle glasses had rectangular frames that fit closely and snugly around his eyes and head. Harry didn’t like the way they looked on him; he had a soft spot for round-rimmed spectacles because those were the kind his father had worn in all his photographs.
Emotional instability and excessive chattiness are the other two side effects Madam Pomfrey mentioned. Harry doesn't comment on the tears on Malfoy’s cheeks, instead gently wiping them with a thumb. Malfoy’s stricken expression morphs into mild confusion and then resignation.
Harry stared at Malfoy, who acted as if this wasn’t the first time he shared something personal since they started working together. But it was, and it was amazing. It never crossed his mind, but as soon as Malfoy said it, Harry
But Malfoy had laughed and given him a genuine, almost relieved, smile that had caught Harry off-guard. “I can’t believe I’m saying this Potter, but I’m glad it’s you.”
At the main campus, Ron dropped Dean and Neville off at their respective schools before he and Harry continued towards the Business School building. They took some time to find parking, which made Harry grudgingly admit that they should have come earlier. Eventually, they found one and hurried on foot to the spot where Hermione had been waiting for them.
“Sir, why can’t they be monitored here? At St Mungo’s?” asked Weasley. A really good question, Draco admitted.
Ron watched his best friend stare forlornly at the table for several minutes before he threw his hands up and sighed dramatically. “Fine! I’ll keep an eye on him for you.” When Harry’s face broke into a grin, Ron pointed a warning finger at him. “But I’m not playing wingman or matchmaker. Go woo him yourself.”
Draco conceded. “I don’t hate it.”
“More!” Teddy squeals, jumping back and spinning as he watches the paper crane fly. “Draco, more!”
Harry felt something heavy fall onto his head and promptly blacked out.
“Mother,” Draco muttered, waiting for her to blow her nose and look at him. “There’s something I need to tell you, about me and Harry…”
This became a routine. They ate together almost every night, learning about each other gradually.
but was stopped by Harry. "I need to tell you something," he said. "About my nightmares."
As if right on cue, a puff of white smoke wafts from Harry’s mouth and out the window.
Draco stepped back, pointed his wand and shouted “
“Don’t you have cats to save from trees and poor damsels in distress waiting for you?”
Harry’s whole body convulsed as he coughed in surprise.
Harry took the helmet and slowly placed it around Draco’s head. It felt suffocating at first but got better when Harry lifted the visor, allowing cool air to brush his skin. Draco took a minute to get used to the feeling before pulling down the visor over his own eyes.
“I can’t imagine being trapped in this place alone,” Harry remarked as they lounged on the couch. Glancing at the open window, a thought dawned on him. “Hey. Do you think we can climb out the window?”
“Okay,” Harry murmured, unsure where Draco was getting at with this, but he kept his arms around him.
me, you idiot.”
Harry sputtered, blushing. “It’s not a date. It’s for an assignment. At the
“I don’t think Rosenberg is much better than us, but why are we having so much trouble?” Snape wondered aloud, eyeing each of his players as though he expected a serious answer.
A long banging against the door sent them springing apart.
“Don’t you have another tournament match tomorrow?” Draco asked worriedly when they were in the university gym the next morning. “You should be resting.”
Because every time his shot flew through the hoop, the crowd cheered; Blaise and Greg gave him high-fives and Weasley slapped him on the back; Snape nodded at him approvingly. During these short moments, Draco felt a sense of happiness and belonging that he had never experienced before.
Suddenly a strong gust of wind blasted around them. Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist and pulled him towards the direction he came from. Harry followed Draco into the wheat field, but as soon as he stepped between the tall stalks, his surroundings changed. Gone were the yellow scenery, replaced by a vast landscape of a snowy mountain valley.
"Are you kidding me? I
Potter! We’re out in the open.”
Harry leans closer, and closer still, until he is pressing Draco into the sofa, his hand trapped between the armrest and Draco’s nape. He feels Draco give in to Harry’s weight on top of him, even bringing his legs up until he lies supine across the sofa and allows their hands easier access to roam about the other’s body. Harry trails his free hand up and down Draco’s chest while Draco has his in Harry’s hair and on his back.
As soon as Harry stood up, Draco clutched his arm and Apparated them both straight into his workroom.
“Excuse me, sir,” said Draco. “I’m sorry for my behaviour during the first half, but I think I know how we can catch up. I can do it, but I need everyone’s cooperation.” With Snape’s permission, Draco shared his ideas and plans.
“Yesterday you said spattergroit is horrible because a virulent strain can make you lose your memories. You also don’t drink because you lose control of yourself when you’re drunk. That’s pretty consistent.”
Pansy shot him a look that was a mixture of exasperation and pity. "Whatever. I have a shoot out of town tonight. I won't be back until tomorrow. Please remember to lock the door before you leave." When Draco nearly choked on his food, she smirked. "I know you go out every night, darling. Don't act so surprised. One day you'll tell me what you're up to."
“You chose a flavour I like.” Malfoy seems flattered. “Is this another one of those products new companies ask you to try out and give ‘honest reviews’?”
Potter automatically reached up to touch his own forehead, where his lightning bolt scar was partly hidden by his fringe.
instance where they were in the Quidditch stands, watching a match from the teaching staff box, and the wind was blowing Harry’s black hair into his eyes; Malfoy brushed his fringe back, gloved fingers grazing Harry’s forehead and scalp before withdrawing his hand as though nothing happened.
Harry laughed until his stomach hurt. “So
Harry's heart skipped a beat.
When put that way, it did appear really simple. “Right,” Draco replied. “Make sure you catch my passes and score.”
“For you?” Draco raises his eyebrow knowingly. “We’re in the middle of a war, if you recall.”
Harry was glad when Ron remained quiet. He needed to say it but wasn’t prepared to face the ramifications of his confession. Maybe this was what Draco had meant when he said he wasn’t ready.
He looked around his imaginary scenario. "No. They're here but they don't look angry at me. They're with Potter."
“Done. Didn’t even leave a scar,” Malfoy reported, impressed.
Harry’s arms automatically grip Malfoy’s shoulders but instead of pushing Malfoy away, he simply holds on, completely flummoxed. “Um, Malfoy?”
Sensing positive energy from the team, Davies nodded his approval. “In that case, we better make this work.”
“If you want to shoot it, you have twenty seconds to do so, Captain Potter,” Draco says. “I suggest you make haste before its friends get any closer.”
Being Draco’s roommate had a steep learning curve.
” A jet of water rained down upon Potter’s head like a waterfall.
“No,” Malfoy answered. “Before you suspect me of dosing your milk with a potion or something, I assure you I did no such thing.”
Draco’s eyes flickered over Harry’s face for a second before he dropped his gaze. “It’s my job to figure out how it works. I managed to dismantle it. See these cracks?” He pointed at the lines over the sphere, careful not to touch it. “I was able to decode the spell inside it, layer by layer, until I reached the key inside. When I touched it with my magic, I blacked out and woke up here.”
Pain forgotten, Harry grabbed his glasses, shoved Neville aside and raced downstairs.
Draco appears amused. He places both palms on the carpet and regards Teddy fondly. “What do you like about dragons?”
“The things you
Harry tasted bitterness in his mouth. "We're not enemies."
"Me too," he replied in relief. "Me too."
They don’t manage to make one thousand paper cranes that day, of course, but Teddy manages to fold one entirely on his own without Draco’s help after about twenty attempts. He is so happy with his achievement that he gives Draco a hug, his own hair mimicking Draco’s shade of blond. When Teddy pulls back, he catches Uncle Harry smiling happily at them.
Draco returned to his bedroom and went to sleep with a small smile on his lips.
Draco bought gifts for Harry for no apparent reason, aside from “This reminded me of you” or “I thought you might like it”. The gifts varied from a simple button badge to a 3D printer Harry had drooled over since the beginning of the semester. Harry soon stopped refusing them once he realised that it was Draco’s way of showing his feelings. His love language.
“A Dimension Transporter, perfected by Granger herself. This is powered by your magic,” Draco said almost reverently. “I can feel it.”
His heart thrummed vigorously against his ribcage and he struggled to breathe for a minute. He closed his eyes and concentrated, trying to make sense of the mash-up of joy, pleasure and hope swirling in his chest.
“Try me,” Draco gasped when Harry’s half-hard erection rubbed against his own.
The idea of the sphere falling into Draco’s hands and potentially harming him made Harry angry again.
“Oh, shut up,” he says fondly before crashing their mouths together again.
Harry takes the plate from Malfoy and sends it together with the fork back to the coffee table. "Let's go back to bed?"
Harry took a step closer, right into Draco’s personal space. “Stay still. Trust me, okay?” he whispered before gently tucking Draco’s long hair behind his ears. Draco froze, barely noticing Harry’s hand brushing the back of his head to flatten the hair there because he was too busy staring at Harry’s face.
Draco, usually very attuned to his surroundings, yelped in surprise and dropped the vial he was holding. It crashed into its cousins in the display. Harry heard Draco’s panicked inhale before quickly yanking him back, but the action caused Draco to fall back against Harry’s body, sending them both crashing into another cabinet.
"Sixth year. Sectumsempra."
Holding back tears, he got off the bed and opened the door.
"I don't think you're silly or pathetic. I think you're brilliant." Harry gently pulls Malfoy's hand away from his mouth and, because he can’t help himself, runs his thumb along Malfoy's sharp jaw. "You don't need to feel embarrassed. I get it. The effects of the potion will wear off tomorrow, right? I'll take care of you until then."
Harry lowers his chin and gently plants a kiss on Malfoy's forehead. "Goodnight."
“As fast as
Malfoy looks so vulnerable and unsure; Harry has an intense desire to kiss him, to whisper love confessions into his ear — but Harry simply smiles and vows, “I will.”
"My feelings towards him are… complicated." Harry glanced behind him nervously, but Draco was reading on the couch, not hearing a word thanks to Harry's strong Silencing Charm. After Healer Kim's warning, they had agreed not to separate unless for toilet breaks and showers.
They were from two different worlds. Draco still smelled of expensive sandalwood and fresh vanilla. Harry still felt like he was corrupting Draco every time their bodies touched.
Harry pressed his burning face into a cushion and fought the urge to scream.
The effect was instant. Potter shot up and leapt off the couch, shaking his wet hair. “What the
, Potter.”
Unable to help himself, Harry took the other wizard’s hand and held it to his chest. “I'm glad you're alright. Don't scare me like this.”
Harry had lost count of the number of times he caught himself staring.
Fantasising about it was one thing; hearing Harry express it while they were both in bed and one of them shirtless was another, and Draco was not ready for the latter. He opened his mouth but failed to string any words together because,
Harry beamed. “Just a gut feeling. It looks good on you.”
“Don’t do that!” Draco yelled irritably. Blaise knew perfectly well how much Draco hated being caught off-guard. They were supposed to be
“Potter? The guy you’re on the phone with practically every night?” Pansy cackled. “Is he also the one who brought you home on his motorcycle at the beginning of the semester?”
Harry was inside with Remus and Sirius, talking animatedly with his two guardians. Remus had an arm around Sirius’ waist while the latter rested his head on Remus’ shoulder. Harry didn't even bat an eyelid when Remus bent down and planted a kiss on Sirius' cheek.
“There.” Potter sounded smug. “No one can see us now.”
The annoying smile vanishes as Zabini settles a cold stare onto Harry. “I beg your pardon?”
"Now, hang on." Harry's own throat constricted. "Not useful? Your colleagues spent 48 hours going round in circles, no idea how to find you, until one of them suggested the soulmate route. They taught me a spell to make me aware of the soulmate connection, and then I could locate you easily." He gestured at the medallion around his neck, pointedly ignoring the green glow of the jade. "I only needed one jump."
“You want to ask them for
Draco was not the only one who got scolded. Weasley was told his "footwork was sloppy" and Theo apparently played like "a constipated corpse". Several players, including Greg and Blaise, were completely ignored during this briefing; Snape must have been happy with them.
Draco had been watching him closely at the match the previous day.
Malfoy ignores the question. “Is that why you brought me to this place? Because the hotels we always go to don't allow smoking?”
This made Harry pause. “Are they next door?”
Patients in isolation wards were not allowed visitors. The door was locked from the outside. There wasn't a fireplace to make Floo calls and the windows were simply panes of glass to let light through; they couldn’t be opened and were resistant to blasting spells. Harry probably could have blown the wall to bits if he really tried but he was too distressed; he didn't want to actually leave. He just wanted to see Draco.
“What do you mean it’s not real?” the voice of Ron Weasley chimed in. “How do you get treated then?”
Draco quickly sized him up, a habit his father had ingrained in him. Harry’s black hair was unkempt, and his clothes were mediocre and cheap, but somehow he still looked presentable.
Harry was falling in love with Draco Malfoy.
Draco introduces his team to Harry. Hermione Granger has discarded her surgical cap and lets her large hair loose as she speaks clearly into the comms. She allows Harry to send several good words to Ron before pushing him aside.
Harry carefully extracted the beverage from his roommate's hand and put both bottles away. He then wrapped an arm around Draco's torso.
“You better hold on.” Hermione grabs Harry’s hand.
Madam Pomfrey smacks her lips unhappily. “It appears Professor Malfoy is experiencing some rare side effects of the Anti-Sniffles Potion. This potion is very effective; it can eradicate a flu in just a day, but the side effects of extreme cold, emotional instability and excessive chattiness make it a less desired option than Pepper-up.”
why you didn’t want me to follow you shopping!”
"You want to parade me around like I'm a trophy, like I'm your plaything?"
It had been all that and more, but instead, he said, "Yes. That's what I meant."
Malfoy’s cheeks are rosy pink. "I’m sorry. Just— You said I'm hot. And then asked me to go to bed. Are you trying to court me, sweetheart?"
It had been five years since the war but holding Harry Potter in his arms still reminded Draco of Fiendfyre. He shivered and almost ran out the door but Potter stopped him with an arm around his waist.
While Harry hastily parked and chained his motorcycle, Draco unlocked and opened the front door. Pansy had gone home for the weekend, so the house was empty and silent. He waited while Harry fumbled with his pockets and switched his spectacles.
Potter took a sip of his tea before asking further, “Why don’t you drink?”
A curious compulsion drove Draco to fold up his right sleeve and present his forearm to Potter the same way.
When the blond stood up, Harry clambered to his feet too. Harry’s heartbeats were still loud in his ears, so when the man spoke, he only caught the second half of his sentence, which was spoken in a posh and confident accent.
Until he asks about the weight and mass of his
“Draco,” Harry said pleadingly. “I’ve liked you ever since I bumped into you in that hallway at university at the beginning of the semester.
Draco embodied at least a dozen contradictions but was unaware of all of them. He was a son so lonely and severely overshadowed by his father that he struggled to see his own value.
“Snape is picking players for the starting lineup,” Draco said anxiously.
“Well, if you insist,” Draco gestured at the house, face beet red, “my room is upstairs.”
“What? Why not?” Harry demands, affronted. “You’re sick! I want to take care of you!” Because that's what friends do. To their friends. Regardless of other potentially more-than-friendly feelings one might have for the other.
Harry’s cheeks turned pink. “I, uh, I usually lie down across the back seat.”
"I'm thinking about it," said Draco, who was already coming up with ideas. The difficult part was to convince Snape and his teammates to try them out without much practice beforehand.
"From Head Auror Robards," Healer Kim explained when her head returned. "I'll see you again tomorrow. Have a nice day!"
“Wait!” From his pockets, Draco removed his wand and a small item Harry didn’t recognise. He cast a spell on the item; it took him a few tries but it eventually turned into a bouquet of red roses, which he presented to Harry.
Harry couldn't help but grin back. Their conversation moved on to other topics, including Hermione's studies and, much to his friend's amusement, whether one needed to brush one’s teeth again after drinking milk.
Harry,” a female voice sighed. Granger, of course. “But that’s not the point. That’s not even a real treatment!”
Malfoy cursed under his breath as he slipped his wand back into his sleeve and walked further into the room. While he summoned his briefcase and started unpacking his clothes on the bed, Harry continued surveying. The bed was directly in front of the door. There were small bedside tables on each side of the bed, two wardrobes side by side against a wall to the right and a large window to the left. Just adjacent to where the wardrobes were was a door that led to an en suite bathroom.
Afterwards, Davies sent more opportunities for Draco to score three-pointers. Every successful shot further widened the gap between their scores. They didn’t
“She won’t,” said Draco confidently. “She’s the
of Ron Disapparating, but he kept his eyes on Draco, whose cheeks were flushed. He was wearing a dark blue shirt underneath a crisp black jacket and matching black trousers. The blond cleared his throat and shoved a large white box into his arms, mumbling, “Happy Birthday.”
Harry chuckled. “Are you just trying to make me feel better?”
Harry Potter was always around, but Draco never knew what the Saviour was up to.
“My mother used to give me some whenever I had trouble sleeping. It might not work for you, but it doesn’t hurt to try, does it?”
Sometimes their eyes would meet during classes or meals — silver with green.  Potter would stare at him, unblinking. Draco was always the first one to look away.
Draco gasped when Harry’s hand ventured lower. “Really, Harry? We’re doing this in my parents’ house?”
"You're the best," Harry exclaimed, grinning. Harry hated paperwork, and Malfoy was excellent at it, so he always entrusted it to Malfoy. "Oh, I forgot to ask her about the Quidditch World Cup!"
Draco fell into step next to Harry. “You have a car?”
And like the wise, resourceful man he was, Harry confided in Hermione.
Potter’s cheeks went dark crimson in a split second, and he shyly avoided Draco’s eyes. “Hey, um, can I ask you something? How come you never join me when I invite you to pub nights?”
And even after doing all this continuously, sweating and breathing heavily, Harry never made any mistakes; his movements never lost power or speed. The
“You can’t drive?”
The wards buzzed, alerting him of a presence outside the door. When Harry lifted his head, the house appeared to light up, the air felt cooler. Only one person Harry knew could make the house respond so favourably like this. He leaped off the couch and ran towards the entrance, breathless with anticipation as he opened the door.
He glared at the redhead. “How do you manage to block me every time?”
Right on cue, the bathroom door opened, and Malfoy walked out, fully dressed in a navy blue shirt and grey trousers, a towel hanging by his neck. “Oh, good morning,” he said. “Did you sleep well?”
Harry counted seven, maybe eight men. Too easy.
Draco paused to recall what he did yesterday that could be relevant. “You saw me in Financial Reporting class?”
The scientific name of the plant is long and convoluted, so it went over Harry’s head. What he understands from Draco’s long explanation is that it’s a new biological source of energy.
“Not in front of the students,” Draco replies, still holding onto Harry’s chin and staring at Harry’s mouth.
“And to Draco, without whom we would still be rushing to wrong conclusions,” Harry added with a wink in Draco’s direction. He delighted in the flush that spread on Draco’s cheeks.
Malfoy so angry with him, anyway? Sure, Harry was the one who rushed to capture the suspect without taking the necessary precautions. It was his magic that ran wild and did extensive collateral damage to the warehouse, that resulted in them being doused with infectious spores. If he hadn’t done all this, they probably wouldn’t be stuck in this situation.
“Sorry?” Harry replied hesitantly, handing over the bag anyway.
Now it was Harry’s turn to look confused. “Why? Isn’t it normal for university students to have part-time jobs?”
let me kiss you.”
“You got it back,” he noted, smiling. “Just in time for our cruise tomorrow.”
When he materializes inside the
"No, they don't," said Potter firmly, but Draco didn't believe him. "I can't do this, Draco. I don't want to have to hide you from my friends
With a grunt, Harry tucked away his wand and trudged across the muddy soil until he reached more solid ground, taking note that Draco was also moving in his direction. “Saving your arse, obviously. What the fuck were you thinking? Sending your soul to another dimension?” Harry shrieked. “Where the hell are we, anyway?”
Harry straightened and gently tucked Draco’s silky hair behind his ears. “I know. I won’t steal his star player.” He touched Draco’s earring, something he had always wanted to do but never did until now. He was obsessed with it.
"Draco, you're not defined by your job. You're brilliant and intelligent. I like you for
Draco was relieved to find the wards still intact. Jumpy was confused to see them but let them in, stating that his parents were asleep. Jumpy took their jackets and showed them to Draco’s old room. Upon reaching the doors, Narcissa rounded the corner and hurried towards his son.
The last thing Draco remembered before losing consciousness was being irritated at Potter. This was somehow all Potter’s fault. When he woke up, it was to the noise of Harry Potter shouting.
“You’ve always been my wank fantasy,” Draco blurts out before slapping a hand over his own mouth in horror. “Sorry, it’s the potion. Please forget what I said.”
Malfoy was at the kitchen door, a finger pointing towards the living room. "Weasley is on the Floo. He asked for you."
is two-thirds the size of
“Go out to dinner with me,” he said hastily as Draco unrolled his sleeve.
Harry laughed. They were sitting side-by-side on Harry's bed, backs leaned against the wall. "Are you drunk already?"
One day, while playing with his stuffed baby dragon in the sitting room, Teddy overhears Uncle Harry talking to Grandma in the hallway.
"That's… that's not what we agreed."
“But I must have gone insane, because I have decided that I
“Basketball is a team sport!” he bellowed for everyone to hear, before lowering his voice into a creepy drawl, eyes narrowed. “Learn to work with your teammates or spend the whole semester warming the bench.”
Mrs Kelley was a stout, elderly lady with grey curls. The poison in her system had created streaks of what looked like moss and algae along her sickly grey skin. There had been a red bubble around her nose and mouth, helping her breathe. She had remained unconscious throughout their visit.
“At least we’re alone,” Harry remarked, smiling as Draco traced the veins along his arm with pale fingers.
Snape shot Draco a look that clearly said 'We'll talk about this later' before focusing on the game. The two teams were neck and neck but Rosenberg had a small lead of two points.
Draco cast spells to lock his shop and switch the sign to Closed before lowering his wand and eyeing Harry's hand suspiciously. "I can Apparate to St Mungo’s myself."
So that was how Draco ended up with Harry’s head in his lap, the only thing separating Harry’s black hair and his thighs was a pink pillow. Admitting defeat, Draco brushed Harry’s wild, damp hair with one hand while Harry took his other hand and clutched it to his chest. He could feel the faint rhythm of Harry’s heartbeats against his fingertips.
Draco closed his eyes, feeling himself fall deeper and deeper as Potter's fingers brushed against his palm. "Might as well, Harry."
“Allergic. To Pepper-up,” he repeats slowly and patiently. “I’m brewing an alternative.”
City Stadium actually consisted of many different stadiums. After Blaise dropped him off outside the stadium compound, Draco spent a minute being lost. He was searching for a map or signage when he heard a familiar voice calling him.
"Tomorrow," Malfoy croaks hesitantly. "Come to my flat tomorrow. I'll make you dinner, and then you can stay over."
“Fire,” Harry orders.
“What kind of pub night guest would I be if I order pumpkin juice while you hooligans drink whatever mind-numbing beverage you all like to consume?”
“I actually picked it up after. This is my first time joining a club.” There was something about Harry’s charisma and the way he looked at Draco expectantly that Draco could not refuse to answer. He imagined how disappointed his father would be if he found Draco sharing information about himself with strangers so freely like this. “Anyway, what about tomorrow?”
“Car accident,” he answered curtly. He took a deep breath before changing the subject from his deceased parents to his existing ones. “You know, Remus and Sirius… I am their son. They are my parents, for all intents and purposes. What do you think about that?”
Potter's face went red with anger. "That bastard! He took advantage of you!"
They were all at his and Pansy’s house, around the dining table. Greg, Vince and Daphne were on one end of the table, huddled together over a game of UNO cards while Theo, Blaise and Pansy sat close to Draco. Daphne had turned on the radio, which was currently playing
Harry automatically grinned; he
Harry was already planning to go anyway, so receiving a direct invitation from Draco was a big, fat icing on the proverbial cake. He could not stop smiling; his cheeks were starting to hurt. “I’d love to.”
The next day, Harry watched nervously as Malfoy took the first bite of a pancake. “Well? How is it?”
unleashes her missiles onto the enemy ship. Harry watches the explosion while behind him, Draco’s crew frantically works to do… something.
Draco awoke to new surroundings. He vaguely remembered being alone in a small room surrounded by glass, with a Ventilator-Bubble Charm over his mouth and nose. Now he didn't need that charm anymore because he could breathe on his own again.
“I’ve entered the coordinates,” Draco says calmly.
Harry got up and walked to where Malfoy was. Malfoy heard him approach and looked up. He must have noticed Harry’s tense face and shoulders, because he asked, “Are you alright? What did Weasley say?”
As much as he hated it, Ron was right. After the war, he had a nightmare every night, about everything and anything. He dreamed of being trapped in cupboards again, of being eaten by gigantic serpents, of falling into veils, of his friends dying in his place, of himself dying and never choosing to return. Therapy had helped him, and slowly, the dreams reduced in frequency, until the only nightmares left were of almost killing another boy in a dimly lit bathroom. Those were the only ones his Mind Healer couldn’t help him with.
Blaise held up both hands in surrender, smirking. “I’m hardly to blame, Draco. You would have noticed me sooner if you hadn’t been busy drooling over Potter.”
“Er, I panicked,” Harry admits, searching for more appropriate places to put his hands. Eventually, he just flops one arm against the mattress while keeping the other at his side, unintentionally trapping Malfoy’s arm between Harry’s flank and elbow. He still doesn't trust himself to lay his hands on Malfoy, especially not when they are this close physically. “Are you still feeling cold?”
deserve this, to which I say, yes, darling, neither do you.” Draco smiled fondly, reaching for Harry’s arm. “It’s not your fault.”
"Hey Malfoy, are you sure you don't mind doing all this paperwork?" Potter asked as he went through Draco's completed reports on the couch. Draco was confident in their quality, but he always showed them to Potter to double-check before submitting them. "You know I hate doing them, but you shouldn't have to do everything yourself."
“If you want to get started immediately, why don’t we meet up later today?”
Malfoy stares at Harry incredulously. "You really do like me?"
Malfoy lifts his forearm, where the red-pink outline of the Dark Mark still mars his fair skin. “The Saviour sleeping with a Death Eater? That can’t possibly go well with public perception.”
matters.
"I…" Harry pulled him closer. "I think I like… both."
“What? You’re
So instead they spent time outside of classes, working on assignments or homework. Sometimes they even grabbed lunch together, just the two of them.
Teddy glances up at Uncle Harry, who nods at him in encouragement. “They can fly,” he answers.
The more time Harry spent with Draco, the more mesmerized he was. Harry learned that he had a sweet tooth and couldn't stand spicy food. Draco’s friends were all in Arts School because unlike Draco, their parents had let them choose (or didn't care) what they studied. Draco once complained that it was getting tiresome to tie his hair during basketball practices, but never made any efforts for a haircut; instead, he liked to touch it — twirling a lock around a finger, combing or pushing his sidebangs back with a hand, basically anything that drew Harry’s attention to his white-blond hair — when he spoke with Harry. Draco liked to act cool and blasé as though nothing could bother him, when in reality he was socially awkward. And, despite Draco never outright admitting it, evident in his appearance and fashion choices was a rebellious side that festered beneath the surface.
It was like a dam broke inside Harry. Desire flooded his every cell and he found himself unable to keep his hands off Draco after that. Every kiss lit a fire within him. He could even feel his magic spark whenever their bodies connected.
He waved a hand at his cheek and muttered a wandless numbing spell. Back in the bedroom, Malfoy had his back turned towards him, facing the opposite wall. Harry gingerly slipped under the covers and whispered, “Good night, Malfoy.”
“I assure you it makes perfect sense!” Malfoy says pointedly, turning around. “You have nice chocolate skin and I lo—” He slams his mouth shut and glares at Harry, who is wiping the corners of his own eyes.
The sack was pulled off his head. His spectacles were gone, probably having fallen off during the kidnapping process. His wand was missing too, but Harry didn’t need it. He muttered a quick Vision Correction Charm, which never lasted very long, but was good enough for the current situation. He was in a vast room that lacked any windows. It was obvious that they were still on the cruise ship. Probably in the lower decks.
Malfoy replied with a curt “good night”, and then the rest of the night went by in silence.
“You’re not the only one who’s left a mark on me," said Draco. "These scars don’t bother me. They never do, not as much as this one has.” He nodded at his left arm. He wondered how he could make Harry understand. "Do you forgive me for being a Death Eater?"
Draco reached up and pulled him into a searing kiss. “Then why haven’t you cast it yet?”
Draco spent his childhood and teenage years holed up in a mansion. His parents were strict and overprotective. He only knew curfews and restrictions. He was showered with toys and gifts but was never allowed to hang out with his peers. He had never gone to concerts or parties, never drank alcohol or smoked, never had sex. He only registered for Business Studies because his father made him. His dream was to be free.
Draco watched him go, thinking how yes, he would absolutely like to meet Harry outside of class again.
Harry grinned and tried again. “You look ugly in your fancy clothes.”
Potter apologised again for having nightmares but was tight-lipped about discussing it further. Draco continued his work on their case report while Potter wrote letters to his godson and friends on the couch. From time to time, Draco asked Potter to confirm details about the case, but the day was as uneventful as quarantines went.
Draco turned his body so that he faced Harry. "Do you?"
To make matters worse, Draco — and every fibre of his body — wanted to leave a good impression on Harry’s friends and family. This was incredibly important to him. He judged that using whatever social tactics his father had taught would fail him since none of them advocated warmth and acceptance. His father was not a warm or accepting person.
"See that writing desk over there? Open the drawer. There should be two green bags with St Mungo's name and logo embroidered on it. Yes, that's correct, Auror Malfoy. Please bring them back here."
“Oh. Um, I… I don’t mind,” he stammered, uncrossing his legs.
“You know, like the Sorting. I went directly after you.”
“Sorry,” he said hastily. “I called you this time last week and you were awake so I thought—”
“Have a drink?” Seamus suggests, to which Dean nods enthusiastically.
, I want it too, but can we wait a bit? You took the potion yesterday evening. Madam Pomfrey says the potion stays in your system for twenty-four hours, so…”
Paparazzi catching Harry Potter in front of Draco Malfoy's flat building is the exact kind of scandal they wanted to avoid.
After a while, Harry stretched his arms and laid back onto the grass while Draco remained seated, having no desire to ruin his cashmere sweater. “Draco, when is your birthday?”
Draco couldn’t remember what classes Harry had that day, and the idea of peeking into every lecture hall in Business School in search of the bespectacled boy was too daunting for him. He didn’t even see him during lunch.
Draco sighed, pressing a hand to his forehead. “Oh
“Oh,” Draco muttered, remembering that he had questions to ask Harry. “Why do you have a part-time job?”
Draco still refused to learn any volleyball terms, but Harry was sure that would change soon. Peppering kisses along Draco’s jaw, he jokingly asked, “Join the volleyball club with me?”
"Are you going out?" asked Draco, disapprovingly picking at several loose threads on Potter's sleeves.
“Then I’d love to.”
Draco worked as a Potion Master at St Mungo’s, so this apothecary was more his scene, rather than Harry’s. He was merely tagging along on this shopping trip because he had been busy running his orphanage lately and they hadn’t gone out together since their wedding three months prior. Draco had appeared reluctant at first, but eventually agreed to let Harry follow him.
Malfoy sniffles, the towel over his nose and mouth. “I’m allergic to Pepper-up.”
Kreacher appeared in the room with a loud
Even after the motorcycle slowed and finally stopped, Draco kept himself pressed against Harry’s back for almost a minute to calm his nerves. Harry’s body was hard and steady, like a pillar, but also warm and comforting.
Malfoy handed Harry one of the bags and kept one for himself. Inside were 13 vials containing deep yellow liquid and 3 vials of pink. Each vial was the size of Harry's thumb.
Harry flopped back down on his pillow. “Full of press conferences with Ron, Hermione and Kingsley. People should
Over the next few months, they slowly opened up to their close circle of friends and families about their relationship. They had discussed it, and even though Harry could see it frightened Draco to death, they promised to go through with it. Harry’s family
Draco’s lips are soft and sweet; they tremble slightly as Harry tenderly sucks Draco’s bottom lip between his own. They part willingly and beautifully when Harry coaxes them open, a groan escaping from deep within Draco’s throat.
Harry and Draco never got the chance to talk much during actual lectures; they only shared one class per week and Professor Scrimgeour was generous with his insults to students who chatted during his lectures.
So when Weasley passed him the ball, Draco got into his shooting stance and sent the ball straight through the hoop.
Draco stood up so fast, his chair toppled over.
In a flash, Malfoy got up and went to grab the St Mungo’s bag from the bookshelf. Harry lifted a hand to check his face but stopped when Malfoy yelled, “Don’t touch it! It’s about an inch above your left eyebrow. I’m telling you so don’t touch it!”
“Um, Draco, you said you don’t go to pubs,” said Harry. “Does that mean if I had invited you to anything else, like a dinner, you would have said yes?”
Draco had never ridden a motorcycle in his life, so when they reached the parking area, he stared at the two-wheeled vehicle in trepidation. “No way,” he breathed. “This is a hazard.”
It was bright out, but she tucked him under the covers. She lied down next to him. "Darling, we are going to fix this, okay?"
Draco was useless in the kitchen, of course, much to Harry’s amusement. He eventually was assigned to helping Granger set the dining table while Harry and Weasley worked in the kitchen.
Draco’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. "I see you, but... Potter, if I do this with you but we don't work out," he whispered, "I won't be able to handle it. I'm not… strong enough."
Harry's only response was a big yawn.
As he was being introduced to Neville Longbottom and Dean Thomas, Draco started to feel uneasy. When Harry had to leave Draco in favour of salvaging the fruit salad (apparently Granger had tried to sprinkle crushed vitamins tablets on it), Longbottom pulled Draco to the window and started bragging about his garden. Then Thomas excitedly asked him extensive questions about Daphne, after having found out that she and Draco were old friends. Even Granger started conversations with him, mostly about studies.
“Er, yes,” Potter admitted sheepishly. “I’m bad at keeping this a secret. Are you upset?”
“I still can’t believe all of you let me go to Business School alone,” Draco remarked indignantly, tying his hair back with a hair tie and using bobby pins to keep it neat.
Draco opened his mouth to retort, but the front door opened and Pansy emerged from the house, wearing a short, lacy black dress and tall dark boots. She didn’t hold back on the black lipstick and black nail polish today. She crossed her arms and glared at Draco with heavily shadowed eyes.
Instead of replying, Malfoy wheels around briskly but in his haste, he accidentally sends his elbow right into Harry's ribs. Harry collapses back onto the cushion, moaning in pain while Malfoy kneels between Harry's legs and apologetically rubs the spot he hit Harry.
“I just shared with him what I saw. He figured out the rest himself.” Harry stood up, watching Goyle and Zabini envelope Draco in an awkward yet ecstatic group hug. Amidst the cheers and celebration, Draco caught Harry’s gaze over Blaise’s shoulder.
Harry laughed in response. “We’ll see.”
Harry shook his head slightly and pulled his visor back down. “I had a great time with you, Draco. We should do this again.” He bid farewell, pushing his motorcycle back to the road.
Sighing, Draco leaned back. "I'm falling… for Harry Potter."
Draco and Potter repeated at the same time, both in horror.
Ron smirked. “It’s a different kind of ‘partner’ now, isn’t it?” When Harry gaped at him, he laughed and waved a hand dismissively. “Don’t worry. I won’t rat you out to Robards. He’s my boss, but you’re my best friend. I’m just glad you took our advice.”
Harry's world changed the day he met Draco Malfoy.
Their new strategy required Draco to observe the entire court and predict his teammates’ positions even before receiving the ball; and once he did get the ball, he’d utilise his pinpoint accuracy to send the ball wherever he needed. It was harder than he had anticipated, with everyone moving rapidly and erratically. As a result, there were several times his teammates couldn’t catch his passes in time.
The Potions Professor is unimpressed when Harry tells him about the trip, instead rolling his eyes at Harry’s enthusiasm.
“It’s perfectly safe, Draco,” Harry said, amused.
“I know,” Harry sighed, almost dreamily. It had only been a few years since Harry accepted that he liked men. Society during this time wasn't kind towards people like him, so he shared this secret only with a selected few. Aside from Remus and Sirius, the only two other people who knew about Harry's sexuality were his two best friends since high school.
Draco snorted. “You sound like my coach.”
Harry's eyes were fixated on Draco. This was his first time seeing Draco in his official sleeveless basketball jersey and shorts, and the sight made Harry breathless. Draco's pale skin matched so well with the dark green colour. His arms and legs were wrapped with lean muscles. His blond hair was tied back neatly, away from his face, and Harry could see his black earring from afar.
“A phone call for you.” Neville jabbed a thumb over his shoulder. “Someone named Malfoy. Isn’t he on the basketball team with Ron? I think he—”
of feelings for him. Even though the blond’s words are still sharp, rude and scathing, his body language is often the opposite. He has a certain smile that he only gives Harry, one that makes his sharp features turn soft and — Harry would never say this word out loud — pretty. His hands, when they aren’t gesticulating or working, often find themselves on Harry’s arms or shoulders. There was
“Being the most intelligent of that department of halfwits is no achievement.”
“What’s this?” Seamus asks, a little out of line but instead of chastising him, Harry looks at Draco expectantly.
Snape made everyone introduce themselves. Aside from his friends and the captain, Draco didn’t know anyone else. He did, however, look twice at Ron Weasley, because he remembered seeing him with Harry that morning. Unlike his bespectacled friend, there was nothing particularly special about the redhead. He was taller than Draco, skinnier with too many freckles.
It was Potter saying that he wanted to meet.
"You're helping me a lot with this." Potter's voice was quiet. "I don't deserve this."
Harry looks up at the screen and gawks at the large green planet that now dominates their view. The planet wasn’t there before. The incoming fleet of enemy ships is nowhere to be seen. The debris of the exploded ship has vanished.
Harry’s mouth quivered with a barely-concealed smile, which he quickly smothered after one look at Draco’s expression. “Ron is taking care of our other cases today.”
When Draco turned back to Harry, the other man was awfully quiet. He was still wearing his helmet and those sporty tinted spectacles, so Draco couldn’t see much of his face or his eyes.
he made — fuck Merlin and Godric. Harry considered himself extremely blessed to be the only one hearing those delicious sounds from Draco’s throat.
“That’s not what I—  I meant the least idiotic!” Draco flushed and scowled. “Let’s get back on track, shall we?”
“Yes, so he doesn’t have any other options,” Madam Pomfrey declares, pointing a finger warningly at Harry. “I trust you to take care of him, Professor Potter. The potion will stay in his system for twenty-four hours at most. He will return to his normal self after that. His cold will be gone by then, too.”
“There is a fine line between blindly obeying your parents’ orders and deliberately going against them,” Blaise pointed out. “We’re all on different sides of this line.”
He eyes the cigar in Harry’s hand with contempt. “You know I don’t like smoke.”
Seated on the Chair was a slender young man with short white-blond hair, dressed in the same dark green Starfleet Federation uniform as Zabini, but Harry has never seen legs – crossed gingerly at the knee —that look
"Our fathers are vastly different."
“Then you’ll like this gift from me.” Draco reaches into his jacket and takes out a square piece of yellow paper. He shows it to Teddy and then starts folding it.
With a huff, Captain Malfoy gives the necessary permissions and cuts the comms.
“Draco?” Harry called from the cashier counter, where a staff member of the apothecary was patiently waiting. “What’s taking you so long?”
just enough for two adults
"I regret this immensely," Draco hiccupped half a bottle of beer later. "Tastes like piss."
His side of the bed is empty. Harry immediately sits up and Summons his glasses, hastily shoving them on. When he can’t find Malfoy in the sitting area, he goes to the bathroom. The door is closed, but there isn't any noise from behind it. Harry knocks on the door. “Malfoy? Are you in there?”
Potter sent the drenched couch a look of utter defeat before spelling it back to its original (and dry) form and following Draco to the bedroom.
Harry released Malfoy and pushed him back before quickly hurrying to the bathroom. There was a strong dull ache in the back of his skull. He leaned against the sink, closed his eyes and concentrated on his breathing.
The idea of being with Harry was very appealing. It was similar to how Draco had felt when he first fell in love with basketball, but to a greater degree. The feelings that flooded him were
Malfoy stopped drinking his tea to look at him, and Harry immediately flushed.
He tied the letter to his owl with shaking hands and watched it fly away until it vanished from sight.
"My dad taught me there's no such thing as being too kind."
Potter's smile widened as he looked at Draco and nodded. He drank the milk in one go and beamed at Draco again once he was done. "Thanks, Malfoy," he said, putting the glass and his spectacles on the bedside table.
But just like Blaise had foreseen, they learned from their mistakes and adjusted their speed accordingly. Draco never held the ball for longer than a second, instead swiftly diverting and redirecting it to his teammates. There was no room for hesitation or indecision. More and more, Draco’s touch passes assisted his team to score. By the fourth quarter, they had already surpassed Rosenberg’s score and taken a twelve-point lead. Rosenberg hadn’t managed to score a single point in the second half.
The waiting game is torture. Harry is never good at doing nothing, so he reads a random book he grabbed off of Draco’s bookshelf, an arm around Draco’s waist as the Potions Professor grades students’ essays. Harry quickly gets bored of the book, and tosses it aside in favour of leaning against Draco’s back and holding him tighter. He rests his head against Draco’s shoulder, breathing in his apple-scented soap.
cases," Draco huffed irritably, "the Ministry still sends its favourite lapdog to babysit me? Merlin, help me."
“How was your first day?” asked Blaise, jamming his bag into the locker next to Draco’s.
His anxiety skyrocketed when Harry removed his glasses, pocketed them and slid on a pair of sporty-looking sunglasses. The lenses were translucent grey, hiding his green eyes. He looked different. He looked… what? Handsome? Attractive?
Preparing breakfast was a disaster. Harry's head was in the clouds, drunk on Draco; his concentration was all over the place. He could feel Draco's gaze following his every move, which both titillated and unnerved him.
The wards around Grimmauld Place had been modified to allow certain people to Apparate in and out. Aside from Harry himself, the only two people who could do this were Ron and Hermione. So Ron only needed to walk to the edge of Burrow wards before Apparating with Harry straight to his living room.
He allowed himself a glimpse of Potter’s happy grin before he headed out, stifling a smile of his own.
fixed your robes and now you're going to go there covered in Floo powder?" he practically shrieked in alarm as he pushed Potter away from the fireplace. "Be a civilized wizard and Apparate there, you idiot."
"It's faster if you come with me. There’s a special room near the Potions Damage ward I can Apparate to." Harry nodded at his outstretched hand, getting impatient. "Trust me."
Draco was a nervous wreck. He practically turned Harry’s wardrobe upside down in search of the perfect dress robe, which of course never existed, and definitely not in Harry’s closet. They went to Diagon Alley under glamour and returned home with more articles of clothing Harry could count.
Sirius and Remus took their leave at around 5 o’clock, excusing themselves to a hotel to spend the night. They promised to come to Harry’s next tournament match on Monday before departing on Sirius’ motorcycle.
Uncle Harry waits for a while before speaking. “There’s someone I want you to meet. He’s your family.”
Potter would never feel that way towards him. He would be insane to think otherwise.
Draco’s Mother arrived in the evening, accompanied by Weasley. She sobbed while Draco held her hands reassuringly. Healer Kim had kept her updated every day, but she couldn’t visit him until he was out of isolation. It was torture for her; she had just lost her husband a few years ago and could not bear losing her only son. While his Mother pressed a handkerchief to her nose, he glanced at the other side of the room, where Harry and Weasley were whispering by the windows.
Harry thinks if Draco had offered him his hand, Harry would bow down and kiss it. Thankfully he does no such thing, because apparently Draco isn’t a hand-shaking kind of person. He is the let’s-get-to-work-pronto type of person.
Draco shrugged. His father was in Azkaban, his mother was sentenced to home arrest for 15 years, his family name tainted, his family fortune would deplete quickly if he didn’t take over the family business once he graduated.
Lucius had said, when he first learned of Draco’s new interest in basketball, that sports like these were a waste of time for visionaries like the Malfoys. He had been even more annoyed that Draco had played it “just for fun” and had not intended to join any clubs.
Harry laughed. “You only say that because you hate cooking.” Instead of denying it, Malfoy simply shrugged and continued eating.
“No,” Teddy blurts out, immediately biting his tongue after. Seeing Uncle Harry upset makes his chest feel heavy and he hates it. “I can meet him today.”
