‘Wow, you’re right. I’ve never actually thought about the court cases before…’ Potter was looking at him weirdly, like he was… mesmerized? Impressed? Whatever it was, Draco decided not to focus on it, because it was giving him a funny feeling somewhere in the pit of his stomach.
‘Sure. I can manage on my own for a couple of hours. Pick up some Firewhisky on the way back? Regardless of the outcome, I’ll be needing a drink.’
Yasmine was on point tonight dressed in dark green lingerie (Slytherin green, Draco thought bitterly) and high heels, her long hair straightened and flowing down her back like liquid silver, makeup impeccable. The only thing that could potentially seem out of place was a long strip of emerald silk wrapped carefully around her left forearm, concealing what was the only link between her and Draco Malfoy. No amount of skill in self-transfiguration and glamour charms could hide the Dark Mark, the dark magic used to brand him was too strong, so Draco had to resort to Muggle means of disguise. At first he was scared his clients would want to know what’s under the fabric, but he soon learned that none of them really cared – Yasmine quickly learned how to distract them from it.
- I… I don’t know, Harry. I love you, I really do, but my actions ever since the beginning don’t paint a pretty picture. I don’t know if I’ll be able to change, to control all the violence that’s in me. I’ve been in this cycle for years now, you can’t just shake it off. Frankly, I don’t know if we can do this.
‘But then, it seems like a very suspicious coincidence that you would be there to effectively help them…’
his unhelpful brain prompted) was just the testament of how good he’s gotten at managing his own orgasms over the years. But then, why would he find Potter’s enthusiasm over the case that much endearing? And what was with the instinctive agreeing to Potter’s offer (because no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it to himself, if he was to refuse it, he would’ve done it flat out, not said he was going to think about it). He groaned and got up from the couch. He needed to figure this out, and figure this out quickly, because those sleepless nights didn’t agree with him. He was rapidly loosing weight again and his brain was getting all foggy. So once again, Draco was back on the windowsill, smoking and trying to analyse what on Earth was going on with him.
- No buts. If I wasn’t ok with it, I wouldn’t think of all the things I want you to do to me right now, you know? – Harry smiled. Draco loosened instantly. So his boyfriend really didn’t mind the mark.
‘Not really. It’s a normal thing there – if the parents are at work for half a day and cleaning by hand takes so much time, the kids have to help out or there would be just work and cleaning all the time. Besides, kids make a mess too, so it’s only fair they lend a hand at cleaning.’
‘Yeah. He started out by yelling at me for using the keys he gave us. He said I was acting like I owned his house or something. And then he admitted he’s been drinking and said it was my fault…’
‘I have to do this. If you’re willing to go for it and try the transfusion at all, I will give you my blood and that is final. You said it yourself, we will both survive this.’
‘Yes, I know, you’re innocent, blah-blah-blah…’ Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘Lucky for you, someone recognized you at Hog’s Head, so for now, your alibi checks out. At least until we get a more detailed report on the autopsy that would tell us specifically when Longbottom died. Or until the almost-widow is finished answering questions. In any case, as much as it pains me, I can’t keep you locked any longer, so for tonight, you’re free to go.’ He turned around to leave. ‘Oh, almost forgot – you’re not allowed to leave London. There will be seals placed on your house in the morning and someone will come to put a tracker on you around 8 a.m..’
- Oh, give me a break. – Harry snarled. He was too disturbed and disgusted to feel sorry for Malfoy right now. - You and your family brought this upon yourselves. I could tell everyone after what you’ve put me through! Imagine the headlines: “Disgraced Death Eater turns up as a Muggle whore!”.
was out of the question entirely – he didn’t have his wand, he left it in Scotland, and he wasn’t going to off himself with Potter’s one. It seemed inappropriate and he knew that it would be rather difficult for Potter to prove that he wasn’t the one to kill Draco (although why that particular aspect of it stood out to him, Draco had no idea).  Then, there was a possibility of poisoning himself – that would prove rather difficult, he concluded, since Potter seemed to rely heavily on Muggle medicine, at least judging by the contents of his bathroom cabinet, and Draco had absolutely zero idea what any of the little white pills might be for – they all looked the same to him and the names (or what he assumed to be names, for they were displayed on the labels of the bottles) gave him no indication whatsoever. He immediately disregarded any of the methods he considered ‘violent’ like shooting (why did Potter keep a Muggle gun in his drawer anyway?) or hanging himself – he knew he looked bad enough already, there was no need to do any more damage than strictly necessary. By sunrise, Draco came to a conclusion that the only viable option was slitting his wrists.
‘Spare me.’ Draco laughed dryly. ‘You know as well as I do there is no coming back from this. I might as well just end it all now and be done with it.’
Alone. That seemed to be the theme for his life right now. He had nobody by his side. Potter was forced to take him in, like he was some shelter dog, but it was clear he didn’t want him there. Sure, they managed to act like adults around each other, there wasn’t any hostility between them anymore, maybe even they had some fun working the case for a couple of brief, fleeting moments, but that was no friendship. As soon as he was cleared, Draco was planning to get the hell out of Potters apartment and never return. He would go… Well, where exactly? The bitter realisation that he had no
They talked for hours that night, Draco crying and trying to convince Harry that he really loved him, that he never wanted anybody to get hurt. It was almost sunrise when he managed to fall asleep, still not knowing if Harry believed him that he was ashamed of himself and terrified of his recent actions.
from Potter) – and even if he decided to let go of any last shred of who he once was (not that he was sure there was anything to let go of left there at all) then after his display last night, that particular ship has sailed.
- I’M not paying attention?! Your bloody trunk is still in the middle of the room, you spent the last week annoying me on purpose and you’re the one that never thinks of anything besides their own arse! – Harry groaned internally. God, arse comment again?! What is going on?!
‘Unless…’ Potter looked like he had some strange idea that might work if it wasn’t too far-fetched. Draco knew this look all too well, it was the same look Potter had anytime he accused him of something back in Hogwarts.
- God, you spent one night with him and you already sound like him! – Ron sounded shocked. – I knew this was a bad idea! What have you been doing that made you turn like that?!
The moment he stepped foot in Diagon Alley he started looking for any stray copy of the Daily Prophet he could snag, figuring that if he’s been outed it would be all over the front page. He had no luck however, the Diagon Alley seemed unusually clean. He sighed and decided to go back, he’ll need to try his luck elsewhere.
The room fell silent. Everyone was watching the trio with their jaws on the floor. It wasn’t exactly a secret that neither Harry nor Malfoy were happy with the arrangement, but nobody expected that amount of hatred there – and from Harry’s end of the equation, no less.
‘Well…’ Draco was visibly perplexed with being addressed like that. ‘I’m thinking of a Healer training at St. Mungo’s.’
‘No, it’s not what you take in school.’ Harry laughed ‘It’s a university course. Like, after you graduate school, you can go to a special teaching institution that offers sort of advanced courses and things. Different universities specialize in different things - you decide what you want to do for a job and then apply for the degree that will get you there. You can go for engineering, or medicine, or law and so on. You spend a few years there, studying only the subjects that would be useful in your job and then, when you graduate, you move on to work.’
‘I think I best owl Arthur and Hermione’ Draco said. ‘You know, to thank them for their recommendations. I couldn’t have done it without their help.’
Draco knew there was no use trying to make Potter get up and see Slughorn. He decided to finally close the door and just stay with him checking for vital signs and monitoring the situation. After all, if things got serious, he could always get the Potions Master then – or at least he hoped.
And then there was the confession he was forced to spit out under the influence of Veritaserum – apparently, even though he didn’t realize it, he was hurt by Harry’s relationship with Malfoy. Apparently, somewhere deep inside him, he felt tossed aside and exchanged for a ‘new best friend’. Weirdly, Ron realized that the feeling wasn’t entirely new to him – it was like he had already felt this way at some point in his life, although he couldn’t quite place when or who caused it. It was only when the phrase
That was all he needed to say apparently, because the next thing he experienced was a lightning in his head when Draco pushed on finger into him. His head fell back and a cry ripped through him. He didn’t even care that he was being loud and they were still standing by the open window, all he was focused on was Draco placing open mouthed kisses on his neck, sucking at his pulse point ,while stretching him more and more. Harry never wanted this to end, but the need to actually feel Draco inside him was too strong.
‘We’re staying at the Manor for now, with my mum.’ Draco said quietly. ‘She insisted she needed to teach us how to feed ourselves and stuff before we…’
‘It sure sounded like you’re into guys, Potter.’ Malfoy smirked and raised his eyebrow. Was he somehow sober right now?
– Do you know what exactly he took? – Draco handed her Potter’s list with a blank expression. The longer Pansy’s eyes followed the note, the more it seemed like they were going to pop out of their sockets. It would be a comical sight if not for the gravity of the situation. – Holy bloody fuck! Is he suicidal?!
They walked up to the house in silence. When they got to the door, it opened soundlessly and this time, thankfully, all of them were able to step inside without issues.
‘No idea. Probably standard Ministry seals.’ Neville shrugged. Harry started lifting the enchantments.
, but you will not be permitted to leave your residence alone for any purpose. That would also effectively mean that Mr. Potter would have to remain on
Draco thought he was going to pass out. There was no way out of this, there was no way he could fix this. He always thought he would be able to rise to a challenge in a time of a crisis, but this was a fuckup of utterly epic proportions and he had no idea how to handle it, short for reaching for the razor again. But this was not an option right now, at least not with Granger sitting there looking at him. He was just starting to think that maybe if he somehow got hold of her wand there would be a chance for him, when the door opened and the small wizard came back again to escort him downstairs to listen to the verdict.
- It’s not us I’m worried about, Harry. It might come as a surprise, but I don’t really need that much. I didn’t like blowing money on stupid things like my father did. All of those extravagant things I had he gave me, I never wanted them. But I’m worried about my mother, if father gets wind of the fact she’s supporting us, he’ll cut her off. She has it rough enough as it is, if she has no house and no money, she won’t survive.
- Don’t mind Henry, he’s had it rough. He doesn’t trust people easily, especially in London. I’m Mina, by the way. And you are…?
‘Why? Any experiences you’re willing to share?’ He tried to shake the bitterness of, but it didn’t leave him.
- That bloody fucking… - Draco was fuming. He was seeing white and all he could feel at that moment was pure rage. If anyone would approach him hight now, there would be Unforgivable Curses flying in the air. Suddenly he caught a glimpse of Harry’s frightened expression and came back. He softened instantly. – Harry, listen to me. I told you that last night and I will tell you this over and over, until I get through to you. You are normal. We are normal. There is nothing perverted about what you’re feeling. And if you need some time to figure out if this is really what you’re feeling or if I planted all of this in your head, I will give you as much space as you need, regardless of what comes out of it. Do you understand me?
He turned to the side, pressed his chest to his boyfriend’s back and lightly ran his fingertips along Harry’s bottom. When he heard Harry breathe out, he brushed his lips on the Gryffindor’s ear and reached for his wand. He quickly muttered a lubrication spell and began circling his boyfriend’s entrance. “Tell me how you’re feeling…” he whispered, but Harry could only manage an encouraging moan. “Tell me” – it wasn’t an order anymore, he just needed to make sure Harry was okay with what they were doing. He felt the brunette’s hips push back against his hand and understood everything. There was no greed in him this time, he wasn’t doing this for himself, but to make Harry feel just as he felt minutes ago. They both went slowly, pressed together, Draco’s right arm wrapped around Harry’s chest, fingers entangled in Harry’s own hand, while his left delicately stretched his boyfriend out. There was no need to rush things this time, it felt so right doing this this way that Draco was happy to wait for each squeeze Harry gave his hand before adding another finger. The room was filled only with the sound of their breathing and Draco was listening intently for any hitch, any sign of distress from Harry, but they didn’t come. Instead, Harry turned his head, looking Draco in the eyes and whispered “I’m ready”. Draco leaned in to kiss him and removed his fingers. He flipped Harry on his back, and wrapped his legs around his own waist, not breaking the kiss. “Are you completely sure baby?” he asked, looking down on his boyfriend. Harry seemed certain, but he needed to be extra careful. “I am. I need you.”.
If coming to terms with that he was actually feeling was difficult, having to deal with it now was even worse. If he didn’t know better, Draco would think he was lovesick – food was barely a necessity now, sleep was evading him, but worst of all, he grew to hate the sound of the running shower. It was idiotic, really, that hearing the stream of water hitting the glass doors and screeching of the old pipes (why would Potter choose to live in this dump anyway? He had a house, hell, he had enough money to get something that was at least built in this century!) gave him
It was two hours later when Ron entered Harry’s office only to find his best friend crying, clutching a piece of paper. Without a word, Harry handed him the note. There was only one sentence on the card: “I decided to go for good. D.L.M.”. The world slowed down. Like through a thick, concrete wall, Ron heard Harry say “Malfoy is dead. And it’s my fault”.
‘Calm down, dear, you need rest.’ She was pouring out some potion to give him. ‘It took our best healers three hours to get you to a reasonable state, we can’t have you undo this. Drink this, you’ll fall back asleep…’
‘I’m sorry Draco, it wasn’t my decision. And I swore I wouldn’t tell anyone, not even you.’ Lucius hung his head. ‘I don’t know how to open it, I don’t even know if the Dark Lord opened it himself after he created it. All I know it was sealed with my blood and enchantments in parseltongue. As to what’s inside – I have seen several things like potions and vials of blood, a couple of books, but I don’t know the details.’
- Please… God… Please… - he didn’t know what he was pleading for, for the person to stop hurting him or to hurt him even more.
‘It does. Imagine having to wipe everything down when you just have a cloth, and then you have to clean all your windows manually, vacuum the floors, wash the dishes, scrub the toilets…’
‘Oh, I see.’ Narcissa was nodding her head. ‘So it’s just their job to go and clean people’s houses? That doesn’t sound too hard to do…’
was enough to figure out what happened there), but also Draco managed to fuck up his own questioning rather spectacularly with just two words.
now? God, Potter, if I didn’t know any better I would’ve thought you have the hots for me.’ Draco laughed. ‘Were you ever into any guy anyway?’
- Love, in all honesty, I think I went a little too much into the direction of me telling you what to do for now. Tell me what you want to do now. – Draco had to come up with something to mask what he really wanted. This night was about Harry getting used to the idea of them having sex, there was no need to force his fantasies on him just yet.
- That doesn’t matter. – Harry said determinately. – I still have Grimmauld Place, so we’ll have a place to live. And even if there was some agreement that made the money joined, I have some of my own, we’ll manage.
- So, you feel well enough to tell me what the hell happened? – He really needed to know what caused Harry to nearly kill himself.
It was only when the room was completely empty and the door was shut behind him, that Harry snapped back. He found himself clutching the last vial of some potion in his fist, standing face to face with Draco, who was still staring ahead with an empty gaze and bleeding something black. Harry realized just then how much he was shaking – he felt sick and cold, his whole body was trembling and the fist surrounding the vial was getting tighter and tighter. He could only manage to get out ‘Get him help!’ before he felt a sharp pain cutting through his skin – the glass broke and whatever was inside was now seeping into his bloodstream. He had no idea how long it took before the whole world around him went completely dark and he felt his body collapsing on the floor.
- I don’t know. Draco and I split, this is why I’m sitting here with Ron and Hermione talking. That’s all I can tell you. I have no idea who’s up there.
- Toss off, Zabini. I’ve been here the whole time! – Draco was too preoccupied with his own analysis of the conversation he overheard to come up with a more clever insult.
After the war has ended, Harry had nowhere to go. Ironically, he was the hero everyone cherished and he knew that if he was to ask anybody, they would welcome him in their home with open arms. But he didn’t want to be cherished and looked up to. He knew what staying with any of the people he knew meant – he would end up solving disputes and making decisions when others couldn’t agree on a particular issue. They would wait for his opinion like he was some sort of authority on all subjects possible all of a sudden. He had a taste of it right after the final battle – people were asking for his input on the best way to repair the castle (like he knew anything about ancient architecture!), he was asked for “expertise” during the Death Eater trials (since when was he a lawyer?!) – hell, even Ron and Hermione wanted to know if the thought they should go look for Hermione’s parents together, as if he ever held more than a 5-minute conversation with them or was an expert on post-obliviation procedures (was there even such a thing?). No, it was way too much to handle. He had been making decisions for a whole year, his friends told him point blank he was the “boss” – and look where his decision-making has led him? Of course, Voldemort was defeated, but at what cost? Lupin and Tonks were dead, two Wesley twins became one, countless other people lost their lives. Of course he knew this was what war comes with, he wasn’t stupid enough to believe nobody would get hurt. He knew he couldn’t possibly have prevented what happened. But what if he could’ve done something to spare even one more life? Hell, if he had figured out where the diadem is sooner maybe Malfoy and his minions wouldn’t have caught them in the Room of Requirement and Crabbe would still be alive today? He never really hated the guy on his own, it was just the residual hatred he felt towards Malfoy that radiated off to the other two. His death was not needed, it didn’t accomplish anything or help restore peace. With the others, he could at least try to convince himself that it was for the greater good (he shuddered realizing he’s using Grindelwald’s motto), but with Crabbe it was not the case – it was the same thing as it has been with Sirius – it was his fault and his fault only and it served no purpose.
‘Well, there is one other option…’ Kingsley seemed hesitant. ‘I was hoping we would be able to avoid it, both because it’s less reliable than what we did, and because it might prove even more painful than revisiting your memories…’
- Of course, Draco, don’t be stupid! We can’t have her living on the streets. Besides, you said yourself, she’s a Black. And Grimmauld Place was a Black family home, so it seems appropriate. As long as she teaches us how to feed ourselves and keep the house liveable, I’m completely fine with it. I’m not saying I want to turn her into our housekeeper, I mean we need someone to tech us how not to turn into complete slobs, because if we were to be left on our own, we would turn the house into a complete disaster zone and live off of takeout.
It was only when he lit a cigarette that the memory jumped out at him – Potter’s hand on his wrist, the two of them frozen solid in time and space over the coffee table, and Potter’s words:
Over the next few days Draco and Harry slowly settled in, becoming more and more helpful around the house. Despite his earlier protests, Draco proved to be rather skilled at cooking, even if he occasionally forgot to put out the fire under their dinner, causing his mother to have to rush in and save it from burning.
Fair warning: Next chapter is mainly my poor attempts at describing sex (Turns out, it's way more difficult than I thought!). I'll try to post it later today :D
It was almost midday when Harry, after getting a reluctant ‘go ahead’ from Ron and a considerably more enthusiastic one from the Minister himself, finally forced Draco to get off the couch and put on some mostly-appropriate clothes – they’ve both been living in sweatpants almost the entire time they were quarantined off in Harry’s apartment, and Draco didn’t exactly bring any luggage with him, so, having to improvise, they landed on an all-black (‘because what other colour would Draco Malfoy wear?’ Harry thought and chuckled) outfit comprising of jeans, a t-shirt and a leather jacket. Draco tried to protest, saying this was entirely inappropriate for the situation, but Harry knew he was just stalling. He fixed the size of the clothes (since they were his own, they were way too short and way too wide on their own), grabbed the blonde’s wrist and apparated them straight into his office.
- Maybe if Your Highness decided to raise out of bed with the rest of us mortals, he wouldn’t have to wait for me to be done?
‘Suit yourself. I’ve gotten pretty decent at treating cuts over the years, but if you’d rather suffer just please, do it in silence. And don’t bleed all over the place – there’s some hydrogen peroxide in the cabinet.’
‘I see you really are moving on with whatever this is.’ Dean said. ‘And I was so naïve I thought it was just a phase…’
- I’m not stupid! – Ron was yelling at her. – Of course I tried it! I don’t know what the bloody hell he casted there, but I don’t know how to break through! Just as well if you ask me, I don’t have any desire to talk to him. Not after everything that’s happened.
on a human being?! Are you out of your mind?! You NEVER use that on people! What were you even thinking?! Did you even consider that you might kill him?! And on his spine?! You’re both lucky he’s still able to walk after this!
- Come on, I’m only asking. I’m not laughing at you. That little scene you and your boyfriend caused was intense, to say the least.
He felt Harry’s breath on his cock and knew it was only a matter of seconds before he came. He could hold off longer if he really tried, but somehow (most likely instinctively, because all of his ability to use logic and reasoning was gone the moment his boyfriend touched him) he knew it was better not to. He felt Harry’s tongue on him, running up his length mimicking what Draco himself did earlier, and moaned. This seemed to encourage the Gryffindor, because Draco felt his whole cock being swallowed. Harry chocked the moment Draco felt his erection hit the back of his throat. He wouldn’t admit it out loud, but this was precisely what got Draco off. He loved the sensation of choking his partners with his dick. He felt his orgasm getting closer and closer and when he saw Harry’s head go back down for more, all he could do was succumb to the waves of pleasure that overtook him. It was the best orgasm he had in months, certainly way better than anything he could ever achieve on his own. His brain went into overdrive, he was hypersensitive to every touch, every sound, every sensation. He pulled Harry back up towards him, looking in his eyes. Potter seemed content with himself, and justly so – after all, he just gave Draco the finish of the year.
- Who, not what. – Draco softened. He couldn’t bear Harry still referring to himself as “what”, even if he was bracing himself for being inevitably rejected. – You need to stop doing that, it only reinforces your idea that there is something wrong with you. Once again, there isn’t.
‘Exactly, Draco.’ Arthur chimed in. ‘None of this is your fault. You were just a child, you were lead by what your father taught you. And what you said just now proves to me, and I think that to my wife as well, that you are not your father. In fact, you seem like a complete opposite. Lucius would never say those things, even if he didn’t mean them.’
- No, no, no. – Draco sighed. – It has nothing to do with being a pushover. It’s just that sometimes a person, an otherwise very well-functioning, independent adult, gets into this mindset where they need to relinquish all control over their lives to someone else. It can happen on its own or because of something that happened to them in a particular situation. Sometimes, if they are in a long enough relationship with a person that is willing to gain that control, which is called a “dominant”, the other person can provoke their partner to get into that headspace with particular actions or words.
- It’s cool Neville, thank you. I thought for a moment that maybe you were siding with Ron on this one, I’m sorry I assumed.
‘Will you stop this, please? You’re not helping!’ Harry was, once again, quickly getting angry at his best friend.
- I have this thing where I can somehow sense people like you. – Draco was carefully choosing his words now. He knew that one false move could send Harry back into the spiral and if that happened, nothing would convince him he’s not a freak.
- And I’m assuming, since you say you can sense if someone is a… sub? – Harry hesitated, but continued when he saw Draco nodding with a small smile – that you’re the other type?
‘Go ahead, what did the Saviour of All Wizardkind come up with so far?’ Draco stretched. It occurred to him that trying to help Potter crack the case might actually do him some good – he’d have something to occupy his mind at least.
‘I just do. There’s still time to sort all of this crap out, you know?’ He looked Draco straight in the eyes, not releasing his arm. Draco suddenly felt like he was being burned to a crisp by the intense gaze.
‘Harry, you’re much more valuable than me.’ Draco’s words suddenly reminded Harry of what Dumbledore said years ago. ‘You will survive. We both will.’ Draco added determinately and Harry was just hoping he was right. He pressed his lips into a thin line and nodded – he knew there was no changing Draco’s mind.
would he want this if this was going to be just a temporary thing? And finally, Hermione, I told you already – this has
- Hm, kind of. It’s not as simple as being ordered around by someone, it’s deeper. It’s a kind of relationship where you trust the other person completely to not hurt you so you just give them all control of you for some time. – Harry saw Ron scowl. – And besides, I don’t know if I want to have that kind of a relationship with Draco. Last night I did, but when he asked me if I was sure, I wasn’t.
‘I found him in Scotland.’ Ron explained ‘You know, the swindle case? I have a feeling he might be a part of that.’
- I’m getting to it. So I was hiding practically all summer. I just wanted some peace, I didn’t want to be a leader anymore. – By now, all of Harry’s reservations were gone. He was entrusting all of his mental battles with himself in Draco. – I just wanted to be taken care of for once, not take care of people around me. I was hoping when I came back here I would have some peace and quiet for a change, but it didn’t last. When McGonagall roomed us together, I was furious and scared. I didn’t want there to be anymore confrontation, any more choosing sides. But it was all ok for a while, you know that. And then, after that last argument we had in the common room, it was like I was back at square one. Like the war never happened, like we were 6
, an owl flew through the window while they were having breakfast, holding a thick, very official-looking envelope. Draco opened it with shaky hands and read out loud.
- Yeah, but it’s more than that. It’s not just about sex. I’ve never even had a platonic relationship with a guy before and on top of that, I was only with Ginny for a couple of weeks and that was more like a friendship then anything. We kissed seriously only once.
All Draco could focus on was the sensation of Harry licking stripes across his chest and stomach. When he felt his jeans and underwear being pulled off, he groaned and fell back. Once again, Harry was on top of him.
‘I don’t know. I’m just saying, don’t be surprised if this sort of thing goes on for a while. People have been wondering where you are and now they have a story to latch on to.’
‘Actually, Minister…’ Harry interrupted. ‘I think it would be best if you go with Ron and Neville and I’ll stay with Draco here.’
They cuddled for a while and then got up to take a shower together. To both of them it seemed more intimate than just casting a cleaning spell. No, a cleaning spell sounded like something you would do after a one night stand, in a relationship a shower seemed more appropriate.
- You know. – Pansy’s voice was like a knife in the silence that followed Harry’s statement. She was now standing next to Seamus and Dean with a determined expression. – We both know who’s in there with Draco. And you should know what that means.
‘An Auror, here? It must be serious! Come follow me, I’ll make you a cup of tea and we’ll talk, you look half-frozen, dear!’ When they reached the house, Ron sat down in an armchair and looked intently at the woman. He cleared his throat and spoke.
- And I have been up since 5 a.m. and yet, as Our Saviour so insightfully noticed, I’ve been there for 30 minutes. Which means, it would be enough to wake up at 7 a.m..
‘I’m fine. And besides, it’s not like we have that kind of relationship…’ Draco felt a wave of bitterness filling him. After all the events of the recent weeks they didn’t exactly have
‘Are you questioning your own wife’s judgement of her abilities, Mr. Weasley?’ Kingsley was clearly expecting this reaction from Ron. ‘I would’ve thought you’d be a more supportive husband than that… And I didn’t hear you protest when I placed Mr. Malfoy in Mr. Potter’s apartment. Are you trying to tell me that not only does Mrs. Granger overestimate her own capabilities of defending herself, against a person who, as far as I know, has no wand, but also that said capabilities of hers are that much below Mr. Potter’s level of expertise in your opinion? Well, if I were you, I would expect a stern talking to from your wife tonight – she’s not going to be happy when I tell her we’re going a different route with this whole affair, because her own husband protested violently.’
‘I don’t know. I just felt like it’s not my place to go spilling your secrets. I saw your reaction to me seeing you then and I saw it a couple of days ago and it felt like it was more than enough that I knew…’
- Sorry?! After all he’s done?! – Wesley almost shouted. It was clear that he didn’t believe what he was hearing.
That evening, Harry and Draco spun out of the fireplace at Ron’s house. The Burrow looked exactly the same as it always have – cluttered, full of strange noises coming from every corner but warm and welcoming like no other place could. Harry inhaled deeply and sighed. It has been far too long since he’s been here. He grabbed Draco’s hand, smiled at him reassuringly and dragged him to the kitchen. He stood in the doorway, Draco behind his back looking uncharacteristically timid, and smiled brightly when Molly, Arthur, Ron, Hermione and Ginny turned their heads in his direction. Within seconds he was being hugged and patted on the back.
It was only two days later that Draco finally brought himself to actually following through with his plan – it was surprising, because when the idea first occurred to him, he thought he was certain that’s what he wanted, what he needed to do, but the moment he actually decided on the method, doubts began to surface. What if there was some happiness in store for him? What if he was about to cross out any future he might be able to carve out for himself somehow? And why exactly was he planning to do this in Potter’s apartment of all places? It wasn’t like he had any deadline to stick to – he could very well wait until he was finally let out of the place, he didn’t need to scar Potter with his actual death any more than he already did with his ‘pretend’ one several months ago. That last thought proved disturbing – why was he concerning himself with what Potter felt anyway? They hated each other, they were locked together only because of the idiot’s boss’s bloody stupid decision to place Draco under house arrest and it’s not like they exchanged any words ever since the kitchen incident. No, he didn’t care how Potter felt about his death, it was just a matter of convenience and appearances – he was shunned all right, but he wasn’t quite hated like his parents were. And if he was to commit suicide (the longer Draco thought about it, the more it became clear that that’s what he was planning to do – and it was unnerving in itself) in Potter’s living room, the latter would surely spiral even more than the last time, and then Draco would be widely seen as the cause of wizarding community’s loss of their no. 1 hero. And that would lead to hatred. But then again, why would he care? He would be stone cold by then, so let the people think what they want, it wouldn’t make any difference to him.
- Well, I don’t know much about the gay scene to be honest. But I suppose it isn’t that different from my work, so I can try. What do you want to know?
- You like that baby? – For Draco, the only thing better than sex itself was hearing the other person tell him they loved what he did to them.
‘Who did what, Potter?’ Draco was looking at him with a mixture of curiosity and a slight bit of annoyance – Harry knew he never liked pointless exclamations.
‘Whatever it is, if it’s going to hurt him more than what we’ve done so far, than it’s not even an option!’ Harry stood up.
‘I like you in black, but you definitely look way hotter naked…’ Harry climbed up, whispering in his ear. Draco felt the weight of the other body pressing him down and thought briefly that he could stay like this forever, just lying there, feeling Harry on him. ‘You want this?’
- Look what you do to me… - he moaned. – I… can’t… take… anymore… - Faking a scream, Draco threw his hands behind his head, clutching green curtains that were hanging from the ceiling and draping the headboard of his bed. Potter definitely liked what he saw, because the last few thrusts became much more forceful, almost violent. Draco felt his forearms hitting the headboard and drew out the remainder of the scream while Potter came inside him.
‘Yeah.’ Draco winced – Harry knew it wasn’t due to pain. At least not physical one. ‘East wing, top floor, last door on the left. How do you not know this anyway? You were the ones that figured out there might be something unopened yet.’
‘No, I’m not. And just to make sure we understand each other right now: I was sleeping at night, alone, and when I woke up, he would go to my bedroom and sleep.’
- Don’t you do that! You’re the revolting one here, don’t play the victim now! You knew who you’re having sex with and you didn’t say anything! YOU had a choice!
The next evening Harry was still shaken by Skeeter’s writing – he couldn’t believe anyone would stoop that low and suggest that he not only had any ties to the Black family, but also that something happened during the war and as a result he was now afraid to show his face to the community. He thought his mood couldn’t get any worse, but upon seeing Ron’s expression when he stepped out of the fireplace, he quickly changed his mind.
‘How do you even know that? Your life is not over yet, maybe something will happen and it’ll all turn out for the better.’
- You can’t be not good enough for me, Draco. You’re amazing… - Harry was slowly coming back to their bed.
Harry laughed slightly. ‘Anyway, we should probably focus on the assignment. So, if what Lucius said is correct, the room should be somewhere… here.’ He touched the black wallpaper behind Draco’s bed and winced.
Catching Kingsley’s glance Harry tried to silently plead for the Minister to let them leave the pensive. Kingsley seemed to understand because he nodded and the next thing Harry registered was all of them landing back in Ron’s and Neville’s office.
‘Ok, sorry, I’ll remember next time.’ It looked like the excuse worked this time. ‘You want me to fix this?’
- RON! – Hermione couldn’t believe what she was hearing. – He’s your best friend! And something clearly happened! He’s alone right now, someone needs to talk to him before he does something to himself!
‘But a year ago you thought I killed myself. And now you know I didn’t, so why not tell him now? The ‘reaction’ you had to go on proved false.’
‘Wait a second…’ Narcissa looked at them warily ‘Did I just hear you refer to Harry as your fiancée?’
That night Ron cast a Disillusionment Charm on himself and set out to wait in the field the woman described in the middle of the night. He was still not convinced his plan was entirely sane and would actually bring any results – for all he knew, he was planning to ambush some poor Muggle that had no idea what Death Eaters were. Because surely, his initial inkling that he has somehow, miraculously, came across Draco Malfoy magically resurrected after over a year, was completely asinine. And yet, he couldn’t get this idea out of his head. He didn’t know if it was the Auror ambition of cracking every case, or if it was for Harry’s sake, but he just needed to find out who the stranger was.
‘It sounds like Muggles spend a lot of time in school…’ Narcissa remarked. ‘I wonder if maybe we should try and borrow some of that for our system. Clearly, judging by you two, we could use some more general survival courses…’
- That’s the second comment about my arse you’ve blurted out since you decided to grace the world with your presence this morning, Potter. Are you gay for me or are you just now learning how to appreciate the finer things in life? – Draco decided he wasn’t going let that slide. It was his time to have some fun for once.
‘I just have one question.’ Draco definitely didn’t like the sound of it. ‘Did you, or did you not, hug Potter the moment he stepped out of this courtroom?’
- I don’t know. I have better things to do with my time and intellectual capacity to pay attention to you lot. – He should know better than to insult the only people who still talked to him, he noted.
- You’re not so brave now, huh? – Draco was completely blinded by fury now. – Scared for your pathetic life? You should be. You want to talk to Harry like that? You want to know how it is to be with someone with a Dark Mark? I can show you right now… - It was like everything was in slow motion. He could feel all his anger collecting at the tips of his fingers, starting to form itself into a curse in his wand, when suddenly he felt someone twist his wrist from behind him. He turned around. Zabini was standing in front of him, panting, with Draco’s wand in his hand.
- Please what, baby? You want me to go faster? You’ll come too soon baby, I won’t have a chance to do other things to you… - all Harry could manage in response was a whimper.
When they finally reached the Leaky Cauldron, Narcissa breathed a sigh of relief. The bar was empty so they stood there for a minute before continuing on to the Diagon Alley.
‘Oh, we’re feeling adventurous I see…’ But he lost his train of thought the moment Harry’s tongue touched his skin. ‘Jesus,
‘Harry, I’m sorry… For… For everything. I was a complete idiot for not believing you…’ Harry was sure nobody but him could hear Draco right now, but it didn’t matter. It was their conversation to have, it was their own moment and it wasn’t meant for anyone else. ‘I thought you were saying this only because you didn’t want me to try and hurt myself again. I was sure you couldn’t love me. You and me? After all that I put you through? I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…’ Harry felt Draco shaking slightly. He knew the blonde was crying now and he knew he had to, needed, to tell him everything was fine, to protect him. And it seemed like this feeling alone was enough to finally break Harry out of his entrapment. He opened his eyes and looked at the frame next to him. Everything was blurry, but it was unmistakeably Draco sitting on the floor next to his bed, resting his head on the covers. Their eyes met and Harry managed a small smile – he still wasn’t strong enough to talk, but he hoped that it would be enough to convey what he was feeling. ‘I love you. I’m sorry for everything. Can you forgive me?’
‘I know, but MALFOY?!’ Weasley seemed outraged. ‘Don’t you think it’s irresponsible to trust his ideas?’
‘No, no, it makes sense!’ Potter was back on his barstool again and Draco felt cold all of a sudden. ‘They must have been there at least for a couple of days, right? Observing their potential victim, you said so yourself. They spotted you and decided that was proof enough.’
‘It is!’ Draco was getting excited. Plotting schemes was, after all, a very Slytherin thing to do. ‘You see, if I know that the testimony might be thrown out, the Auror Office would know too, right? So what would they do? They would look for other evidence to keep my father in prison, even with Rowle’s and Yaxley’s confessions not usable anymore – and the first thing they would do is go search the house. Enter me – I’m supposed to want my father out of prison, so I need to clear the house of anything that might implicate him. And to do that I need to know where to look, what to look for and how to get rid of it quickly.’
- No, Theo. Don’t. Make it hurt. – Draco knew deep down he deserved the same pain he caused Harry, he wanted to feel it.
‘And yet when he made you stay home longer, you did nothing! AND you requested a leave instead of working from home!’
‘Well, I think this plan might work. I’m impressed, Mr. Malfoy, I really am.’ Kingsley was nodding. ‘Just for the sake of the case, I am going to tell you that we did, in fact, use Veritaserum during the trials, both on Yaxley and Rowle – but it was according to all procedures.’
- Well… - Harry hesitated. He wasn’t sure that pouring his heart out to the blonde was the best course of action, but somehow, at the same time, it didn’t seem like a completely idiotic idea.
‘No!’ Harry stood up, shouting ‘YOU don’t understand! I’ve caused this! Were any of you there with me? No? Then stop acting like idiots and listen to the person that ACTUALLY knows what happened, ok? This is my fault and your stupid, incessant faith that it’s all only Draco’s fault, is not helping! You know what? If you’re going to be like this, just better leave me alone!’ He stormed off. They could only hear the front door shutting behind him as Ron was staring ahead in stunned silence and Hermione was sobbing into her hands.
- Yeah, sure, thanks guys. – Harry sat down between Nott and Zabini and grabbed a roll. Silence fell over the Great Hall. Harry could see everyone looking at them in disbelief, 8
‘If that’s still on the table, I’ll think about it.’ Draco had no idea why he said this. But what was even more unnerving, was the fact that even though he knew he should be kicking himself for it, he wasn’t. That somehow, although Draco couldn’t figure out how, it was the right thing to say.
Oh, and also, I have no idea if using Diffindo on a human being really is that dangerous, but it seems like it might be, so it fit, so I decided to borrow this one from the HP universe rather than invent something of my own (I was briefly debating Sectumsempra, but that one was waaaaaaay too likely to just kill Draco in this scenario).
That was all Draco needed to hear. He was hard himself, harder than he has been since they’ve been together. The sight of Potter desperately trying to prevent himself from finishing was enough to send Draco’s head into a tailspin. He bowed down and took all of his boyfriend into his mouth. That was all it took for Harry to explode. He came, in violent outbursts, practically screaming, in Draco’s mouth. Merlin, if it wasn’t the hottest sight Draco’s ever seen, he didn’t know what was.
year heard the scream, but somehow only the two of them came to investigate. Gryffindor bravery can be a bad thing, Harry concluded. He didn’t particularly want to be seen sitting there with Ron and Hermione while it was obvious someone (if he was being honest with himself, he’d admit that it was rather apparent who) was screaming his name during sex. – And what the fuck is Potter doing here? With you two?! From what we’ve just been treated to, you’d think he was balls deep in his psychopathic boyfriend right now!
‘Fuck!’ He exclaimed, colliding with concrete. As soon as he stepped back, the wall disappeared. ‘Guess they didn’t foresee me being here for anything other than stealing something…’
It was nearly a month into his forced cohabitation with Potter and Draco was growing increasingly tired of the situation, especially now that the bloody Chosen One insisted on keeping his eye on him to ‘make sure he wouldn’t do anything stupid’. Someone might think he started caring for the blonde all of a sudden, but Draco wasn’t an idiot – he knew all Potter was doing was ensuring that he didn’t land in hot water if a suspect in a case he was working on, the very same one he was supposed to watch over, turned up dead in his own apartment. Regardless, Potter’s incessant need to hover over Draco 24/7 was quickly getting on his last nerve.
Ok, so this is - in my humble opinion - kind of dark, even by my standards. So brace yourselves for flashbacks to torture and mentions of murder.
‘Seriously? You were about to be sent to Azkaban for years for all you knew, and you were worried about me?’
. ‘I mean, we don’t hate each other anymore, at least I don’t hate him, but we’re not friends. We just act civil around each other, but mostly we’ve been ignoring each other as much as possible.’
Draco didn’t think. He just saw Harry’s face go blank after what Thomas said and all rationality flew out of him in an instant. He couldn’t bear his boyfriend being spoken to like that. It wasn’t even important that Thomas was talking about one thing Draco loathed and wished he could rip off of himself, all that mattered in that moment was that he needed to stop that bloody piece of garbage from hurting Harry anymore. He vaguely registered Pansy screaming “Draco, don’t!” and just like that, he was on top of Thomas, his right knee at his throat, keeping the Gryffindor firmly on the floor of the common room. Draco reached for his wand and pointed it at Thomas’ face.
‘Oh, those. Took them long enough, I almost forgot about it. Do they always take this long to do simple paperwork?’
‘Turns out not everything was according to procedures, so Wizengamot might throw their confessions out. And without them, they don’t have enough to keep you here for much longer.’ Seeing his father’s expression he quickly added: ‘Now, I don’t know what went wrong there or if it will even be enough to disregard their confessions. As I’ve been informed, the Auror office is still trying to assess the risk themselves. Which gives us a fighting chance.’
‘You. What would happen to you if they convicted me. I realized that if I’m found guilty, there was no way you would have no problems because of that.’
The interrogation seemed to go on for hours. Harry was stuck with Malfoy in a small holding cell in the Ministry, his head pounding and whole body shaking – without his wand because it has been taken for examination. After what felt like a hundredth time he told Malfoy he didn’t know anything, Harry snapped.
‘But who? You?’ Ron looked up from the paper. ‘You’ve been off the grid for three years now, you’re not bothering anyone and you’re not a threat to Malfoy.’
‘Mr. Malfoy, I appreciate it, but none of those are valid options in this case. Legilimency can be blocked and Veritaserum can be used in strictly controlled conditions, under very specific circumstances so as to assure only the necessary information is revealed, and nothing more.’ Harry glared at Ron. ‘However, since you say you’re willing to do whatever it takes to clear any suspicions, I will have to ask you for your memories.’
- They’re not together anymore. – Pansy closed the book she was reading. – I don’t know what happened, but Draco is completely broken, so I figure it must have been something major. He’s been drinking again.
There was a wave of pain and pleasure as Harry felt Draco push inside him and bite his neck at the same time. There will be bruises and marks tomorrow, he thought faintly, but it felt so incredible that his brain was melting now, so there was no way he was going to focus on that. Somehow, even though it was his first time, being stretched out by Malfoy’s cock felt so good that Harry only wanted more. He pushed back again.
- Oh, go fuck yourself. – Yes, this is the best course of action. Pretend the arse comment never happened. Harry shook his head and headed in to brush his teeth. Maybe he would somehow regain some balance over the sink.
?’ She didn’t raise her voice but it was even worse that way. ‘You killed my fiancé and all you have to say is you’re sorry?’
‘That much I figured, thank you. So what was the best sex of your life anyway?’ Draco didn’t really know why he asked that question – it must have been the fog that clouded his brain at the memory of his own history.
That was it. All the hunger that was building in him for the last couple of months overtook Draco. There was no going back now, he couldn’t even think. He stood up, pressed his whole body to Harry’s and slid his hand down.
‘Don’t get used to it, once we both start going to work it’s all food from the food courts. Now, stop distracting me, because I have to focus. Do you know what ‘heavy cream’ is?’
- Good… - It was clear Harry still had trouble coming back to reality. – Amazing… I’m sorry… - It made absolutely zero sense to Draco why his boyfriend would apologize after what they just did.
They all walked through the quiet street while people were turning their heads behind them. Narcissa was slowly regaining her composure, but Draco seemed like he was shaken to his very core. Harry never let go of him, gently pulling him closer for support from time to time. Harry and Draco left Narcissa at Flourish and Blotts to look for some new herbology books and continued on alone.
‘Conspiring is contingent on intent. That means that if the Wizengamot finds that he did this TO protect you, at least in part, he would be found guilty of sabotaging and conspiring and that would most likely lose him the job.’
, with Mr. Malfoy temporarily being your roommate, I don’t think it would be appropriate for you to actually question him, but you will be allowed to observe the process. As for the other suspects, I don’t see any reason why your role should be reduced compared to how this things normally go, so you will be able to be there and ask questions, while we place Mr. Malfoy under some other arrangement for a couple of hours.’ Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He didn’t even think of the logistics of the whole operation, but that was clearly what Ron had in mind when he spoke.
duties until you are back from the dead, so to say. Now, Mr. Potter, will you agree to such an arrangement?’
‘How am I supposed to know? I have never baked in my life! Go add more, I think since this looks dry you might have not used enough.’
‘Draco, please. I’ve known you for eighteen years, I think I can safely judge who was the one to propose.’ She looked at her son clearly amused. ‘Anyway, that’s fantastic! We need to celebrate! It just so happens I might have some elf wine stashed in the cellar and there might or might be a roast beef that is nearly ready! Harry, dear, I trust you like roast?’
- Well, we’ll see how tonight goes, beautiful. – Potter pulled Draco closer and ran his hands down his back. All Draco could think about was alarm bells going off in his brain. Through the panic he decided he needed to get this whole ordeal done as soon as possible. He leaned in for a kiss and unzipped Harry’s trousers.
‘Madame Kessley, the motion was yours, why don’t you start asking the questions?’ Kingsley’s deep voice brought Harry back a little.
‘Well… I don’t really know what to start with, it’s a complicated story…’ Harry was stuttering. How much did he actually have to tell them? He sighed. ‘I’m sorry, I’m nervous. I wasn’t really expecting to be questioned today. Ok, so a little before I told everyone Dr- Malfoy was dead, we actually met in Muggle London. Not on purpose, we just ran into each other. We talked, it wasn’t entirely pleasant, to say the least, and about 2 weeks later I got an owl from him that said ‘I decided to go’ or something like that. I knew he wasn’t really doing that good there and that he felt like there was no place for him here, so my conclusion was that he killed himself.’
Potter was lying there, on his bed, staring at the ceiling, his face the epitome of indifference towards the world. He barely even registered Draco’s dramatic entrance. On his bedside table there were four or five different half-empty potion bottles. On the floor beside Potter’s bed there was a knocked-over empty goblet. Right in front of Draco, on the floor, there was a piece of parchment with barely readable writing on it. Draco picked it up and tried to decipher what was written – “draught of peace, draught of living death, forget-all potion…”. He couldn’t understand anything else written, but what he deciphered gave him goosebumps.
‘Fine, Malfoy, have it your way. Tonight – you, me, Harry and Neville. I’ll bring it – I don’t trust you enough to drink anything you give me. Grimmauld Place?’
- Wow, first morning together and you’re already abandoning me? That was cold Harry… - he feigned wiping away a tear.
‘Draco…’ Harry forced his chin up. ‘Draco, I love you. I have for a long time. I was just scared you didn’t, so I didn’t say anything.’
- Honestly, it’s like you two never read anything besides school books… - Hermione sighed. – What I mean is, if your parents haven’t signed any agreement when they got married, whatever each of them had then, and acquired later, remains theirs and theirs only. For example, if your mother had some gold to her name the day of the wedding, that gold doesn’t belong to your father and he has no say over this. Then, if she, let’s say, inherited…
‘I’m not an emotional support here, Harry, and neither are you. Although you seem to have forgotten that. We’re the ones prosecuting this case and so far you’ve only managed to convince me that you think your own suspect is innocent.’
suggestion, but so far there’s nothing. And how exactly did you arrive at the conclusion that Shacklebolt’s asinine idea was because of my hunch? He could’ve just as easily sent him off to Azkaban.’
If he was able to in his current state, Harry would cry. The thought of Draco dying terrified him more than his own prospects of death. Selfishly, Harry thought that this might be the worst possible time for that to happen – he still wasn’t fully able to convince the blonde he wasn’t lying when he told him he loved him, but there were a few moments back during the assignment that made him hope that maybe his declarations were somehow going through. After all, Draco did let him take his hand at the gate – he wouldn’t do that is he at least partially didn’t believe him.
- Did you want me to? – Harry didn’t know what to make of it. Neville didn’t show any hostility towards them so far, but Harry wasn’t sure what went on behind the closed doors of his and Ron’s room. – Well, for now we’ll have to work together, but if you’re uncomfortable I’ll work with someone else next time.
‘He always was, Longbottom, it’s…’ whatever Draco wanted to say next was cut off by one of the healers.
The elf wine Harry brought (because he decided Firewhisky wasn’t festive enough for the occasion) was already nearly empty when Harry, emboldened by alcohol, spoke again.
- Please… - By now, Harry was reduced to incoherent moans and that was the most verbal response he could manage. All he could think of was the sensation of his boyfriend’s fist moving along his swollen cock. He felt he was a minute away from exploding.
Draco spent the next three weeks in Mina’s apartment. He tried desperately to find any sort of work, but it quickly became clear that he had no skills that would be useful in any Muggle job and those rare openings for physical labour seemed to instantly be filled by people much more suited for this type of work than he was. He suspected it was rather obvious that if the employers were to choose between a thin, rather androgynous 19 year old and a muscular ex-fisherman type, they would choose the latter. And so, Draco was quickly becoming desperate. He was now even thinner than when he came to London, having lived off of nothing but a loaf of Henry’s bread a day, since he was still too proud to let Mina feed him. One Friday afternoon he made up his mind and hesitantly knocked on Mina’s bedroom door.
That night Harry couldn’t sleep, he needed to know if he can actually trust his boyfriend to be the person he was so convinced he was. I was nearly 6 a.m. when he finally came up with some form of plan on how to achieve it. It was no use to try and fall asleep now, so he got up, took a shower and headed towards the common room. On his way there, he bumped into Hermione.
‘Yes, Mrs. Wesley, we’ve been together for some time now and we’re moving in together once the jobs start.’
It was nearly 4 a.m. when Draco woke up. He was never so cold in his life. He sat up and rubbed his eyes desperately hoping that it has all been a bad dream and he was still in his bedroom at the Malfoy Manor. The realization that he was in fact sitting on a park bench somewhere in London (he wasn’t even sure where he was, he didn’t recognize any of the buildings nearby) hit him like a bag of bricks. He knew he needed to do something, anything, to find himself a more suitable place to stay – staying out in the open like he did was not safe. He didn’t know anything about Muggle culture, he wasn’t sure he would even be able to interact with the non-magical people without it being apparent that he had no idea what was going on around him. And that, in turn, meant that he was practically defenceless if anything was to happen to him. His stomach grumbled. He realized he hadn’t eaten since the previous morning, but it wasn’t like he had any Muggle money (or any money for that matter) to just go into a store and buy himself food. He looked around. Nearby, he spotted a man pulling a cart of freshly-baked bread. The smell was so delicious that Draco practically whimpered. He had to swallow his pride and do something, he couldn’t just sit there staring at the man, it wouldn’t accomplish anything. He braced himself, stood up, and approached the man.
- “Most Slytherin of us all”? What is that even supposed to mean? – Draco raised his eyebrows. – Anyway, I have no time and no patience to deal with your ridiculous idea that I love him or something. If you’ll excuse me, I have to make sure I stay at Hogwarts for the foreseeable future, than you.
‘Weirdly, he seems tamed. He’s still walking around like he owns the place, but he doesn’t insult people. For now, at least. Once he gets comfortable, or, God forbid, actually becomes an Auror, he’s going to be insufferable…’ Ron scowled.
‘Hardly, Weasley. I like being comfortable, I just don’t share my parents’ taste in interior design.’ He shot Ron a sideways glance. ‘For instance, my mother would always choose some antique, French excuse of a bed, just because it has cherubs carved on it, even if it meant you’d be sleeping on top of your partner all night and waking up with a broken back every morning. Me, I’d much rather get myself a super king size with a good mattress, even if it means lack of naked angel butts.’
- If that was it, why was there light coming from under your door all night? – Nott raised his eyebrows. – Some trying-to-keep-you-alive shagging perhaps?
‘Don’t play dumb, Potter. You can’t convince me that you didn’t know.’ His face changed from amused to threatening. ‘You know what I see? You thought she was going to wait for you, but she didn’t. You received a wedding invitation, saw that she was marrying Longbottom, one of your closest friends, you felt betrayed and you wanted revenge. So you summoned Longbottom here and now Longbottom is dead. My only question is, Potter – did you plan it from the start or was it just a spur of the moment decision?’
‘Gentlemen, I think that’s quite enough for now.’ Kingsley’s voice brought Harry back to Earth. ‘Mr. Potter, you’re excused. You’re free to remain in the courtroom, but you’re reminded you’re not allowed to ask any questions for now. Do we understand each other?’
‘You will do no such thing, Mr. Potter.’ Chief’s voice came from the doorway. Ron and Harry fell silent. ‘You are not quitting. Now, I have carefully considered your request, Mr. Potter, as well as Mr. Weasley’s objections to it. I must say, it is a rather unusual development of events. You know very well that we do not usually employ people associated with the Dark Side.’ Harry groaned. There was no way Draco would get this job. He was fully prepared to storm out and never return, when he heard his boss continue. ‘And Mr. Weasley’s threat to quit does not make it any easier. As I have observed, the two of you need to take some time apart to resolve your issues. Mr. Weasley will be assigned a different partner for the time being and you, Mr. Potter, will have to work solely with Mr. Malfoy.’
‘Either you never had amazing sex, Potter, or women are overrated.’ The irritation in Draco was subsiding slowly. ‘Because in my experience you don’t just
- It means you’re ideal. No one can even come close to you. – Harry was placing small kisses on his neck as he spoke.
- Oh, I see. And you thing that 10 minutes of stacking shelves warrants a loaf of bread, boy? – The man laughed. – Look, I haven’t a clue where you come from, but here you work for what you eat. Tell you what, you sweep my store and clean the back room and I’ll think about it.
- Well, actually a change of pace might do me some good. Let me just use the restroom real quick and I’ll be right back.
‘Not so fast, Mr. Malfoy. You were declared innocent, but the matter doesn’t exactly end here. Now, it has been brought to my attention during the deliberations, that the issue of your presumed suicide posts several problems. Firstly, you do not currently have a wand and therefore you are, legally speaking, unidentifiable, and we can’t have that. If I recall, your wand, if it’s still intact, should be somewhere in Scotland, right?’ Draco nodded. ‘Well then, since there is only one person, besides you, who knows where that wand might be, it is my order towards Mr. Weasley that he retrieve it and bring it back to you within 14 days.’ Ron looked like he was about to hex the Minister, but Kingsley didn’t seem to notice. ‘Secondly, since you were declared dead, you were removed from all official registries. That matter needs to be resolved by the Census Bureau. If I were you, Mr. Malfoy, I would brace myself for a long wait, they do take their time over there. Now, the only issue that remains is your residence – so long as you are legally dead, you cannot exactly live and travel on your own, I’m sure you understand. Shall Mr. Potter agree, I will reinstate your previous arrangement, albeit with a slight change – you will no longer be placed under house arrest
So this one is a little longer than the previous ones, but I couldn't figure out what to cut, it's all going to be important later.
‘Oh, well, thank you for your faith in me, my future husband!’ Harry was offended by the fact that Draco didn’t even seem to consider him as a character reference. ‘If they don’t take my word for you into consideration, they’re just stupid.’
‘Thanks, dad…’ Harry picked up on the sarcasm but something inside him decided to ignore it, just for a laugh.
He didn’t even think it was possible to feel worse than he already did, but the next night the physical agony Draco was still in (slightly less excruciating than what he experienced on Potter’s kitchen floor, although not by much) seemed to have found itself a friend in a mental one. Around 3 o’clock in the morning he came to a glum conclusion that he would much rather go through the same pain he was in the night before – at least the feeling of being subjected to something akin to an Unforgivable Curse shut down his brain periodically and he didn’t have to battle the constant stream of self-loathing and crushing disgust with what he’d become, on top of feeling like his whole body was being sliced with a knife inch by inch.
- I didn’t. Crabbe did. And he paid for it. – All of the previous smugness was gone. At the mention of Crabbe, Malfoy’s face went completely blank.
‘Mr. Longbottom and Mr. Weasley have uncovered what might be a secret room, we don’t know for sure yet, in one of the ex-Death Eater’s houses. Problem is, we do not know how to open it or what’s inside.’
- Muggle thing. You order food from some place, like a bar or a restaurant, and get it delivered to your house.
‘Of course, Harry. All of us, on that side, deserve at least a trial. Us two included. And all of those who are yet to be captured proved that they deserve to be in Azkaban.’ Narcissa said determinately.
- How are you feeling? Talk to me. – Now that Draco’s lust has subsided (even though he was still hard, almost painfully so) he could focus on what Harry felt.
been a horcrux. I know it’s gone, but your mother’s protection is still in you and if there is even an ounce of what Voldemort did to Draco left in him, the consequences might be catastrophic. We don’t know what the interactions would be…’
- Are you telling me you’re falling for him? Merlin’s beard, I knew you had a thing for blokes, but-… - Wesley was obviously so shocked he couldn’t find the words. - -but him?! Harry, mate, I’m sorry, but if you’re honestly telling me that you have feelings for- for this wanker, then I cannot support this. He is the most disgusting person we both know. And you should know this!
- All the jabs at him being gay. That’s too far. You know that if you want to keep all that private, you need to be more careful. – Merlin, even Nott was cryptic right now.
- Ron and Hermione know. I had to tell someone, I couldn’t keep it in me. – Harry said quietly, not meeting his gaze. – So if you want to tell Pansy, I’m okay with it.
- No mate, I’m sorry, but I can’t support that. I’m ok with you being gay, even if I wanted you and Ginny to end up together, but this I can’t stand by. Not only is this whole submissive thing bloody twisted, but with Malfoy of all people?!
‘I was a whore.’ Veritaserum wouldn’t take silence, so Draco had to say the truth before he would suffocate to death. ‘A
‘They have more practice than you do apparently. Go stick your hand under some running water while I…’ Harry’s statement was interrupted by a sound of doors swinging open when Narcissa ran into the kitchen.
- But how do I know that’s what it is? What I am, I mean? – Harry raised his head to look in Draco’s eyes.
‘Harry, relax.’ To his surprise, Narcissa smiled. ‘I know what we did, I’ve made my peace with it. It doesn’t mean I don’t regret it, I probably will for the rest of my life, but I don’t want you to concern yourself with this. This is not about you, it’s about our mistakes. You’re right, neither me nor Draco ever wanted to stand by Voldemort, we just wanted a peaceful life and we just followed what Lucius believed in. If it makes sense, I stood by my husband, not by who he followed. And I know you’ve forgiven us – if you didn’t, you wouldn’t be here with Draco. And for this, I’ll be eternally grateful. Don’t even think about the press, dear – I can’t be any more hated than I already am, and if anything, if I was cynical enough to try and use you like this, I’d say that you standing by us and continuing your mission at the same time, would only be beneficial.’
‘What gave you that idea? My letter to Potter?’ Malfoy raised his eyebrows. ‘I barely said I’m going, I never said anything about committing a suicide. So I went. Here. Which brings me back to my initial question: looking for someone?’
‘Good evening Mr. Wesley, thank you for having us.’ Draco was still apprehensive as him and Harry were being led to the table.
‘Nonsense, dear.’ She spoke in the same tone she used on Harry when he refused another helping of food. ‘You’re always welcome here, just as any of our friends are!’
‘No! Not a chance! You’ll never force me to do this!’ Draco was flailing his arms comically, protesting. ‘That’s an asinine idea!’
- You’ll what? Curse me? As I recall you tried to do that once before and I didn’t end well. For you obviously. Feeling in the mood for some slugs again I see? – Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about Draco’s attitude when he said those words. On one hand, Ron deserved this for all the shit he’s been giving them lately, but seeing Draco so easily snap back to his old self was unsettling.
- If that’s what you need to tell yourself, then fine. – Malfoy mocked-shrugged. – Although you don’t sound like you’ve convinced yourself. At least not judging by the groaning that comes out of your bed every time I leave the bathroom in the morning… - he raised his eyebrow and smirked knowingly.
He decided to start with the Burrow, since even if they weren’t there someone was bound to know how to get a hold of them. He stuck his head into the fireplace and seconds later he was staring at the Weasley’s living room. It was Molly who noticed him first.
- I do, Draco. This is actually why I wanted to talk to you. After that argument with Ron I started thinking and I know why I asked you that question yesterday. – Draco tensed. This was it. This was the moment he was going to find out that he needs to let go of his feelings and start rebuilding himself yet again. – I’m falling for you. Last night I wanted you to be with me because of you, not because I just needed someone.
. And if I was you I would assume they saw the Dark Mark and used it – I wasn’t hiding it really anymore and if they’re as good as you say, they wouldn’t risk using someone random, there would be too much of a chance for fuckup. Besides, this was the only time they did that, right? So, if it was just a coincidence, this type of behaviour would pop up every time – why would they only do it once if they were just using a completely random person? They would do it every time if that was the case, there is a lot of unsuspecting Muggles out there they could use to strengthen their argument.’
‘Come on, give me your hand, I’ll seal this up.’ She looked to the bowl on the table. ‘Draco, dear, why is there a whisk whipping lard…?’
‘What’s going on, Draco?’ Harry asked, expecting a string of complaints about the speed of the train or the size of the seats (his previous experience with Hagrid taught him that wizards were usually very unimpressed with the time it took to travel the Muggle way).
- No, Ron, there’s no need. I’ll just go back to ignoring him. That has worked for now, it’ll work again.
– The last part of this sentence came out in a low growl as Draco added the third finger without warning. Harry screamed and this was what pushed Draco over the edge. His vision went completely white for a second as he exploded.
‘And I told you I’m not coming.’ Malfoy tried to reach for his wand, but he wasn’t quick enough. Ron jumped forward, grabbed his wrist and apparated them both straight into the office he shared with Harry.
‘Now, I do realize, Mr. Malfoy, that you are probably quite anxious right now…’ The Minister spoke again ‘but I do need to address a few issues before receiving a verdict has clouded your, or the prosecution’s, judgements. Mr. Potter, let me start with you. What you did during this case was at best irresponsible. It might even fall under gross misconduct. I want you to know that I will be filing a report with the Chief of the Auror Office and urging him to take appropriate action against you – you
But despite his best efforts, the question came back to him throughout the whole week, appearing in his head seemingly out of nowhere at the least convenient times – Hermione must have elbowed him in the ribs at least three times during Charms the following Wednesday because he had been so lost in his thoughts he stopped paying attention.
- Well, if the house is your fathers and he really does throw her out, she can stay at Grimmauld Place with us. Or we can rent something small and let her keep that one. We’ll figure something out. – Harry smiled. – And besides, Hermione said there might be something that forbids this sort of thing.
‘But… but why did you come up with this idea in the first place? You know that Ron will not hesitate to ask about everything!’
- So that’s why you always direct all the other Slytherins? – Harry knew he shouldn’t ask that question, but he couldn’t stop himself.
‘Marginally better. It doesn’t hurt as much, but my hand is still numb.’ Draco stood up. ‘Thanks, Longbottom.’
- It’s not running away from being an adult. It’s just that you sometimes want to not be in charge of anything, sometimes you want to, like you said, be taken care of. – Draco’s expression softened. His eyes were careful and somehow… tender? – You really think everyone wants all the glory and recognition all the time?
- Hey, just because I’ve now poured my heart out to you doesn’t mean you’re free to insult my friends! – He didn’t really look that angry. Draco registered that Harry agreed with him, even though he didn’t want to admit it flat out.
‘8, so we better get up. You’re showering first? I’ll make coffee.’ Draco felt a little tinge of sadness poke him. He had hoped they wouldn’t just go back to their normal lives like nothing happened.
‘What my father wants, most of all, is to get out of Azkaban and go back to his old life. And if I tell him I want it too, he’ll believe me, because, to him, no life would be better than what we had. So I need to convince him that there is a chance his conviction might be overturned – to do that, I need to have something that would cause the Wizengamot to throw out the evidence against him. The only thing that could potentially do that is if you used Veritaserum on Rowle and Yaxley, since they ratted out everything my father ever did wrong.’
Like in slow motion, Harry watched Draco pluck the knife from his hand and slide it vertically across his whole left forearm, practically cutting the Dark Mark in half. Once again, for a brief second, Harry experienced a flashback to Dumbledore. But there was no time to dwell on that, because Draco was now resting his arm against the door. The moment he touched it surface, there was a metallic click of the lock and a piercing scream – it lasted maybe a fraction of a second, but to Harry it was like a lifetime. Draco’s hand slid off the door, leaving a bloody trace, but he just stood there, transfixed at something in front of him. The blood was now dripping onto the stone floor – only it wasn’t red, like it should be, it was black and thick like tar.
‘If I may, Minister…’ Ron looked furious ‘…you claim, Potter, that you’re not friends with Malfoy. So how exactly did the subject of this case come up in your, supposedly nearly non-existent, conversations?’
‘Not entirely.’ Harry was sweating. ‘I was just annoyed with the case one day and I was taking it out on him, so he got irritated himself and asked how much longer were we going to be stuck together. So I told him that I don’t know, and that me being on what the Minister called
‘I opened the door and… and I…’ He didn’t know how to put what he felt into words. ‘The room was calling me, sort of. I thought I had to go inside to…’
On his part, Draco didn’t notice anything being different. Potter has been his usual bratty attention-seeking and inconsiderate self – his habit of waking up as late as possible and then loudly complaining to his circle of admirers about not being able to use the bathroom any time he damn well pleased (as if he had ever put any effort in his appearance!) was really starting to annoy Malfoy.
Suddenly Draco realized that he’d been so preoccupied with his own fate that he completely ignored the fact that this whole case would mean at least charges on gross procedural misconduct for Harry. Fuck, this couldn’t possibly go any worse! If he gets demoted to some measly assistant because of Draco there is no way he would be able to live with himself.
‘To determine the nature of the relationship between the accused and the prosecution. After all, we do not know how much of Mr. Malfoy’s knowledge of the case would be his own, and how much would come from Mr. Potter, so we cannot accurately judge the validity of Mr. Malfoy’s testimony.’
When he first woke up, Draco didn’t recognize the room. Everything around him was starkly white and completely silent. When the initial shock passed and his eyes got used to the light again, he looked around. It looked like he was lying in a hospital bed –
‘Yeah, mate, no problem!’ Ron was beaming with excitement. ‘But honestly, I think it’s better if you have Hermione do it, she’s way better than me at this sort of thing. Tell you what, why don’t you two come over this evening and we’ll work this out? MOOOOOM!!!’ He bellowed into the house. ‘Can Harry and Draco come over this evening? We have something important to do!’ He waited for a second and turned to Harry. ‘She says it’s fine. So, come by around seven and we’ll talk?’
- Sure, no problem. I’ll go tell Yasmine to get ready. Meet me outside no. 20 in 10 minutes and I’ll introduce you two. – Jeanelle smiled and rushed off.
‘Not nearly.’ Ron looked like he regretted saying this. But he too drank the potion, so there was nothing he could do about it.
It took Draco nearly a minute to come back to his senses. The high of the orgasm was so intense that he didn’t see or hear anything until it subsided. But once it did and Draco started registering his surroundings again, his heart sank. He knew in an instant he went too far. Harry was still facing away from him, but by now his arms were dropped to his sides and his head was resting on the tiled wall. He was shaking. Draco knew all too well that it wasn’t a good sign. He tried wrapping his boyfriend in his arms, whispering “Oh God, baby, I’m so sorry, I never should’ve… Oh God, please, baby, forgive me… Please…” but Harry only tensed at the contact. Draco felt like a monster. He knew he fucked it all up.
‘But I shouldn’t have… I’m a monster…’ Draco’s eyes were clouding with tears again. ‘How do you even…’
- So far! You don’t know if you’ll wake up tomorrow after what you downed! – Draco was frantically leafing through the book to find the chapter Potter “consulted”. If the list was taken from his book, maybe he would be able to figure out what the last two ingredients of Potter’s little cocktail were.
- But… - Draco didn’t know what to say. He never thought of the skull that branded him for the rest of his life that way.
year ex-Gryffindors shaking their heads in disgust. Hermione looked like she was slapped in the face, Dean and Seamus exchanged pointed looks and Ron was bending his fork in his fist. A couple of feet away Ginny looked like she was petrified. So Ron must’ve talked to her about everything, Harry bitterly concluded.
Draco saddened. So Harry had no real feelings towards him. All the hope he felt a minute ago vanished. It must have reflected on his face, because Harry spoke again.
‘I guess. I’ll have some first-year trainee look through the archives. But I’m keeping an eye on you both, I’m still not convinced you’re in your right mind.’ With that, Weasley stood up and left the apartment, without even looking at Draco. Potter sighed and rested his forehead on the counter.
‘So now you have a daddy kink? This is getting interesting…’ Harry smirked and took a swig straight from the bottle.
‘Yeah, because they’re going to take me over literally anyone else…’ Draco said glumly. ‘And besides, where am I going to find character references? I’m not exactly friends with anyone who they would consider helpful to my case…’
- You should be. – Draco’s words came out as a whisper. It was clear everyone in the room was terrified. Harry didn’t know if he was more afraid of Draco or angry at Ron. He put his hand on Draco’s shoulder. It seemed to snap the blonde back into the room, because the next thing he did was to turn around and go back to his own table, without looking at anyone.
dark magic. And on top of that from what you’ve told us, it looks like even that has been tweaked by Voldemort, so I’m not sure if I’m correct, but this is the only thing that fits.’
- I know. I told you, it’s rough out there. If it makes you feel any better, I think that with your looks you shouldn’t have a problem with finding yourself a spot in a high-end place. Looks are important, you know. You need to seem, well, luxurious, if you know what I mean.
- Draco, we all know how you feel about what Thomas was talking about. But that’s no reason to kill someone… – Nott was hesitant.
- Since when do I take any orders from people? I’m the one that gives orders around here. – He briefly glanced at Harry. He thought he saw just a hint of scarlet on the Gryffindor’s cheeks, but he couldn’t be sure.
- So, there was this guy and Draco liked him. You know how he is when he is with someone, right? – She looked at Harry expectedly. Harry knew what she meant and nodded. – And one day we all went for a walk, when this other dude, I think he was older than us, but not by much, I remember his face from Hogwarts, although I don’t know his name, came up to us and started insulting Draco’s friend. He was saying things like “oh, so that’s who you’re with now, my sister is crying because of you, I thought we were friends” etc.. And he was using really disgusting slurs. The guy Draco was with was starting to panic, he looked like he was about to cry. I don’t know how it happened but the next thing I knew the guy is backed up into a tree, Draco is completely in his face, his wand is at the guy’s throat. And Draco is like “say one more word and you’ll be begging for me to kill you, I dare you!”. It was the same tone he used on Wesley yesterday. I was never this scared of him, I really thought he was going to Crucio the guy. His eyes were all narrow and he was so tense it looked like he was going to hex him only by how furious he was. I had to physically pull him off this guy. – There were a couple seconds of silence between them. Nobody knew what to say. Finally, Nott spoke.
- Oh, I think I know what you mean! I read about it in a Muggle psychology book! – Hermione exclaimed excitedly.
‘That’s genius! So there’s no need for whisks and bowls?’ Narcissa’s eyes widened. ‘Do they have more things like this?’
- It sounds like it’s a lot to handle for you. I know how it feels. I’ve went through the same process since Thursday. But… - He hesitated. He really shouldn’t say anything else. Admitting how he truly felt right then and there wouldn’t do any good.
- Chill out. If we let it slip it’s you, Slughorn would know Pansy lied to him. And we can’t have that. – Yes, this was the argument he was going to present to his friends. There was no need for them to know the true reason.
‘At first, yes. And then they have to observe their victim to make sure they got it right. They can’t accidentally approach any Muggles, can they?’ Draco’s mind was in full riddle-solving mode right now. He was really starting to enjoy doing this with Potter.
Harry sighed. All his hope for a safe and quiet Friday afternoon went out the window. He reached for a Transfiguration book to get started on his homework, but it was no use. It was already almost midnight and his mind was racing yet again, so he knew he would accomplish nothing. He’d have to copy off of Hermione’s (obviously already done) essay tomorrow. He sighed again, shook his head, and left his friends without a word to go to bed.
‘That I wasn’t what, Potter?’ Somehow, flustering the other man like that seemed funny. ‘Jesus, don’t be a prude, spit it out.’
‘Once again: I have no kink. And your sexual preferences are much more interesting than my non-existent fetishes anyway.’
‘Well, it went on…’ Ron hesitated ‘and now Malfoy is walking around like he knows something but won’t tell anyone. Nobody believes him, at least not in the office, but if he goes on like that there is a chance people will start reading into it.’
- Of course, sir! No problem! – That went better than expected. He didn’t have to beg, he just had to put in some work, he could do that.
- Sorry mate, I just can’t think straight right now. I don’t know. Honestly, all I can picture right now is you on your knees in front of him and I don’t think I can even eat after that visual.
‘Harry, great news!’ Hermione clearly couldn’t contain her excitement. ‘Ron has been offered a position in the Auror office and I’ll be a Junior Undersecretary in International Magical Cooperation!’
‘YOUR suspect, Ron. Not mine. That part of it is YOUR case and YOU are the one prosecuting this. I want no part of that. The rest of them? Bring them on, but as far as Draco goes, you’re on your own, mate.’
you…’ Harry tried to stop Ron, but it was too late – he managed to get out a big enough portion of a question for Veritaserum in Draco to work.
, looking for any blurb, but there was nothing. This alone was more than enough to put him in a crappy mood, but what he found in the Sunday edition made him want to smash something in anger.
‘Jesus, Potter, chill out! I’m an adult, you don’t have to baby me.’ Draco wasn’t even sure if what he was feeling was panic or anger. ‘I fell. I told you to not leave the floor wet!’
‘I was a whore.’ Draco froze. Despite what he told Harry, this was the last thing he wanted Weasley to know.
‘Of course. How often does a suspect solve his own case better than the Aurors that have a whole institution behind them?’
your fault. If you haven’t come up with this ridiculous idea that he’s involved, Shacklebolt would’ve never decided to place him on house arrest and we wouldn’t be stuck here. Are you doing anything with the case anyway? It’s been ages!’
‘To know he doesn’t respect me enough to come to me if he has a problem. It’s been going on for over a year now – first he doesn’t tell me what happened between you two, then he screams at me and Hermione for trying to help, and now he’d rather use your help than mine. You – of all people!’
- I suppose it’s fair… But not here. I’d rather not everyone know what I did. – Draco hung his head. – Can we go into your room?
Harry nodded and left, and Draco was suddenly feeling weird about how that conversation ended, like there was something
‘Guys, I think we went too far tonight. Ron, are you satisfied with the answers you got?’ Harry said.
‘Once again, I’m going to ignore the insult, because the rest is much too interesting to focus on that. So you consider what you said
‘Nothing of the sort. I’m merely commenting on your, rather pitiful I might add, inability to catch a band of snatchers. Although now that you mentioned it…’ he smirked ‘…it does seem rather odd that the person who supposedly killed the Dark Lord would be defeated by a group of hobos with wands.’
He has already spent three days trying to locate victims of this rather heinous scam to interview them – so far, to no avail. He was almost ready to give up when he spotted an elderly woman in maroon robes walking along the only road in a small village Ron was planning to apparate back to London from. He sighed and decided to make one last effort – he didn’t really want to go back to his desk, not with Harry just beside him, sulking and not talking to him.
It took almost two weeks being stuck in insufferable silence, avoiding each other, before Draco finally received his paperwork from the Census Bureau one morning.
‘I wish. In some newer trains there is sort of a tank underneath, but in older ones that’s just how it works’ Harry shrugged.
The person was lying on a bed, stretched out on his back, left arm folded underneath his head, holding something that looked like a hand-rolled cigarette in his right hand. In the dimmed candlelight inside, he looked even more sick and wasted than before. Ron stood rooted to the spot, not believing his own eyes.
The room was silent once again. Draco was having trouble breathing from all the stress, his vision went blurry and there was an incessant voice in his head that told him over and over again
His definitely-less-than-pleasant conversation with Harry was still weighing on his mind, so Ron decided to walk to work. He could’ve easily apparated straight into the office, he got those kinds of privileges years ago, but he needed to clear his head, and besides the case seemed to have been stagnant for now, so it wasn’t like he was needed there.
It didn’t help that his carefully selected combination of herbs, designed to make him forget about everything he has ever experienced in his life, was far out of his reach, left behind in his hut in Scotland when Weasley came and forced him to come back to London. And to think the damn redhead showed up merely weeks after Draco managed to perfect the blend! The first attempt made him jittery and anxious, the second rendered him unconscious for days, the third made him excruciatingly hungry and the fourth seemed to set his lungs on fire – it was only after months of trial and error that he finally figured out the correct ratios to just feel calm, collected and – for once – not in pain. And now it was all gone – just like everything he ever had, he concluded bitterly and sighed. The universe seemed to be conspiring against him, for as soon as anything even remotely positive shined on the horizon, it was promptly snatched away, sending Draco into complete darkness over and over again. He groaned and turned to the side. He was too exhausted to battle all the crap that his life has become, so it seemed like getting some sleep was a reasonable idea.
‘That I cannot stand the git and I’ll quit if he makes me work with him.’ Ron shrugged like it was nothing. Harry felt absolutely livid.
- Love, I want it too, but… - Draco sighed. He knew what he had to say, but it wasn’t easy. He had been picturing fucking him even before they got together, so it took all his willpower not to do it right then and there. But he knew Harry was far from ready for it just yet, he knew he would hurt him and possibly scar him for life doing this right now. If it was anybody else, what he heard would be all the consent he needed, but he didn’t want to do it to Harry, not to him. – We can’t do it right now. You’re a virgin, you aren’t ready for this yet. It takes time to prepare.
Malfoy was still up, reading. He gave no indication of registering Harry’s presence in the room, which Harry actually welcomed. He got into his pyjamas and climbed into the bed.
‘And how exactly are you going to accomplish that? You’re stuck here with me until I give my deposition, they won’t let you leave me alone. And besides, Weasley will not even consider you questioning these snatchers, he thinks I messed with your head and he’ll think you’ll do anything to protect me.’
‘You offering?’ Draco’s hand was underneath his jeans and underwear, fingertips digging into Harry’s skin and brushing over his slit lightly. He thought he was going to lose his mind from these touches alone. All coherence was completely gone, all he could think of was how much he wanted this.
The universe for once sent him a small smile the next day, when he found a roll of parchment on the kitchen counter in the morning.
year when everyone thought he was the Heir of Slytherin), and Gryffindors were flat out accusing him of being a traitor. Saturday evening Harry overheard Ron loudly complaining to Seamus.
Days went by and there was no news of the Auror Office receiving a new Chief. Harry read through every single issue of the
stupid, Potter. There has to be something else.’ Suddenly, an idea sprung to his mind. ‘Do you have any reports on what happened in those locations days before they showed up? They might just travel around the country following events they didn’t cause and using them.’
‘Well then, remember how Ron told you I wanted to help you over a year ago? I thought that maybe if you had a place to live and a job you’d be willing to come back from the Muggle side, so I came up with the idea that… that I would give you keys to Grimmauld Place, you know, since I don’t use it anyway, and that maybe you’d work with me in the Office. You were acquitted, but you still were a part of, well, that side, so I thought that your perspective on some things might be useful.’ He had the same expression on his face as when he admitted Draco was the best sex of his life.
‘No, Mr. Potter, you cannot. You are to stay with Mr. Malfoy and keep an eye on him. I will have all the necessary paperwork regarding your current cases owled to you, and you will remain on what they call
When Draco opened his eyes for the second time, it was already dark outside. He sat up and noticed someone was sleeping in a chair next to his bed. Even in a half-lit room he recognized Hermione.
‘Well, I happen to be, in my humble opinion, a rather smart man, Mr. Weasley, so I pretty much figured on my own, why Mr. Potter requested this switch, and made some moves towards making it possible. It just so happens that your own wife, Mr. Weasley, has luckily come back to work, as you obviously know, and volunteered to serve as a, if you forgive my expression,
‘With my mother.’ Draco said quietly, not raising his eyes from the tabletop. ‘She’s been, well, quite alone now that…’ He paused. It was clear he didn’t want to finish that particular thought.
‘I fucked up, Draco, I fucked up big time…’ He whispered. He couldn’t even bring himself to look at the man. ‘I’m so sorry…’ He was bracing himself for tears, when suddenly he felt he was being wrapped in Draco’s arms, pressed into his chest.
Harry spent the next few days in the same cell. Once or twice Malfoy stopped by to repeat the same questions over and over again, but nothing new ever came up, so Harry assumed the office didn’t find any more evidence against him. He figured this would be the case when the door opened on Friday night, but this time, instead of Malfoy, Ginny Weasley entered his cell.
- He WAS my best friend. Until he started hanging around that wanker! Didn’t you see what they did to Dean? What his BOYFRIEND – Ron twisted his face at the mention. – Did to Dean?!
Draco gave Harry a small, barely visible, smile when they passed each other and Harry sat in the witness chair. His mind was completely blank, he was cold and panicking. He saw that Ron was white as a sheet, but otherwise he seemed determined. Harry didn’t know if he liked the look on his face.
‘Ronald, you cannot quit.’ Harry knew it was serious when Hermione addressed her husband by his full name. ‘It’s only a temporary situation, they will choose a new Chief soon and everything will go back to normal!’
Thankfully, her attitude towards their new relationship status made up for Ron’s obvious (and according to Draco, clearly theatrical) disgust. She tried to be as helpful and optimistic about the whole situation as possible (even though Harry concluded that it was a tad bit exaggerated – he didn’t blame her though, she was clearly trying to keep Harry’s spirits up after the disastrous confrontation with her boyfriend), whereas Ron, on the other hand, seemed to either ignore Harry’s existence completely (in all fairness, he was doing it to Draco long before he and Harry got together), or scoffed and rolled his eyes in fake disbelief anytime he heard him. Tired of his constant attitude, Harry retired to his bedroom early and spent the whole evening next to Draco, each working on their homework. As a result, none of them managed to broach the subject of their relationship going public.
In the common room, three ex-Gryffindors sitting by the fire were suddenly torn out of their conversation by an agonizing scream that came from behind Zabini’s and Nott’s bedroom. They looked up just as a deafening, wailing “HAAAAARRYYYYY!!!” tore through the night air.
Harry grabbed the book Draco was working from and began to read. ‘Are you sure all the ingredients are there?’
- Harry, is everything ok? – Hermione was visibly worried, looking up from an armchair by the fireplace.
- Actually… - Harry hesitated. – It’s not all there is to it. I mean, of course I don’t want to make you wait too long, but aside from that, I came to a conclusion that I want this for myself.
It was almost an hour later when Kingsley, Ron and Neville emerged from the pensive for the second time – if it was possible, they looked even more horrified and shocked than before: Neville’s face had a sickly greenish tinge to it and Ron was visibly shaking.
- I needed it. I thought that after what I did to Harry it was the only way I should be treated. That it was the only way to even things out and try to move forward. That’s why I ended up in his bedroom in the first place. This whole thing, me hurting you – he looked at Harry – and loosing you was just like what happened before.
‘How? You said it yourself, their depositions are today. How are you going to get mine before then?’
‘That I don’t know. All father said, is Voldemort used his blood and parseltongue. And that it might kill whoever tries to open this.’ He added quietly, looking at the floor.
‘Why am I even with you…?’ Draco sighed but it was obvious he was just joking. ‘So far, I’ve been reduced to a housewife, a rather poor one at that.’
- Well, I, for one, have no idea what are you talking about. – Ron looked sceptical. – Do you mean to tell me that you want Malfoy to tell you what to do?
‘I am.’ However grateful for Harry’s protection Draco was, he needed to prove he was trustworthy. And he decided that confronting his past might actually bring some benefits. ‘But I will need a cover story – Harry is right, he’ll never trust me without it. Is there anything I can use to persuade him that he might gain something by telling me?’ Suddenly, an idea came to him. ‘Minister, I’m sorry for asking, but… Did you use Veritaserum during the trials?’
‘I’m…’ Draco didn’t know what to say. He was scared, he didn’t want to do it, but he knew this was the only option if he was to prove that he didn’t know anything.
Draco – Harry figured, that if he was in his room, next to him, he must have come out of whatever possessed him back at the Manor, but it didn’t mean that he was all fine by now. After all, nobody seemed to have any idea what actually happened, and that made Harry worried. If they didn’t know what caused this, or even why did Draco behave like he did, there was no way to fix this. And that would mean the damage could be much more severe than they would be able to see. And that black substance dripping out of the slice? That wasn’t blood, Harry knew that for sure, but what could it have been? Was it possible that Draco might die because of this?
‘Hold on, I think Ron wrote a list at some point’ Harry stretched over Draco’s lap to reach to the other side of the couch for another stack of parchments. Suddenly, it felt very warm in the room. ‘Yeah, here it is.’ Harry sat straight up again and handed Draco a list.
- I’m fine with it if Draco is. Theo, if you want, you can come too. It’s only fair for both of us to have equal support through this. Draco, are you ok with them being there?
‘Oh my God…’ it came out barely audible. ‘Was… was it real? Did Harry die there?’ Draco was past the point of panic – it was something he never experienced before, like there was nothing left inside of him.
Both Ron and Kingsley were already there – Ron looked like he was already regretting his decision to let Harry switch the order of the interrogations at the last minute, but the Minister was seemingly just happy to put the case to a close finally. He cleared his throat sitting behind Harry’s desk (now uncharacteristically clean, since all the paperwork was currently cluttering every surface in Harry’s apartment) and gestured them to sit down.
desired, and that his slip-up with the quote would go unnoticed – if Draco knew how Harry felt, he would back out of the situation faster than it took to disapparate. He sighed and glanced at the clock – his meeting was due in five minutes, so he left the room without even glancing at Ron sitting at the second desk.
‘Well, I told him he doesn’t know shit and his father doesn’t either, because nothing happened, and I might have added a few expletives…’ Ron shrugged ‘you know, to get my point across. He got angry, started insulting me, and we got to fighting. As a result, he has to go to anger management and I’m suspended for two weeks.’
- Anyway, they won’t know. For now, only Pansy, Zabini and I know and I’ll talk to them. Slytherins are quite good at being discreet.
‘There is a lot of time between now and 4 p.m., Draco. Go get a shower and I’ll message Ron and Shacklebolt. We’re doing this.’
Draco’s mind was swirling. So Potter was gay and he had feelings for someone. Some part of his brain was coming to a conclusion that maybe, just maybe, it was him they were talking about – after all, how many people Harry (he was back to “Harry” at this point) has hated for seven years that he would still be in contact with today? But the cold logic he always relied on took over. There were many people they might have been talking about. The Chosen One had just as many enemies as he had admirers. And on top of that, Harry wasn’t even sure if he had feelings for the mysterious man. He looked at Pansy – it was clear she heard the whole conversation and she was looking at him like she wanted to say “I told you so” – although, what that “so” was, Draco had no idea.
Draco, on the other hand, had no idea why Potter went back to being so guarded after their conversation. He thought they managed to reach some form of mutual understanding and regardless of the fact that they would quite possibly never end up together (in fairness, Draco wasn’t even sure that was what he wanted, despite admitting to himself that he was, in fact, falling in love – being even close to Harry Potter was not easy, and he didn’t know if he would be up for all the drama that would inevitably ensue shall they start dating), Draco hoped they could become friends. He had just reached a rather bitter conclusion that maybe not all the potions taken were out of Potter’s system when they talked and he simply didn’t remember last night, when he heard a knock on the door. He called for the person to come in.
the body?’ Malfoy was back to mocking Harry. ‘Don’t play dumb, Potter. You’re under arrest for suspected murder of Neville Longbottom.’
- For fuck’s sake, you know I’m annoyed with you hogging the bloody bathroom all morning! – Harry yelled in silence that fell on the room somewhere around the arse reference.
‘Well, I overheard him talking to Neville. About you. He said that it doesn’t surprise him you’re hiding and that his father said that you would never have a place in the office. So I asked him what was he getting at, you know, to call out his crap, but he just laughed.’
So he spent practically the whole summer isolated, slumped over in Sirius’s old bedroom, reliving memories of war. He barely slept, and whatever sleep he did manage to get was almost always interrupted by nightmares. By the end of the summer he was so used to them that they just drained him instead of provoking a panic attack.
‘You’re not supposed to drink, you already fucked up your liver.’ Harry frowned, but turned towards the kitchen. Truth be told, he could use a drink himself.
‘I don’t know…’ He was stalling. This was the question he didn’t want to answer. ‘I’m not exactly sure what my thought process was back then. Well, no, actually, I know what it was, but looking back on it, it makes no sense. You see, I assumed that if he was living there for some time and he didn’t kill himself, and then he ran into me and we had an argument, that would be the reason why. Because I had no other information about his life, other than what I knew from the time we met there, and that conversation wasn’t exactly friendly. We have a history of hating each other after all, that’s public knowledge.’
‘What force? Draco, you need to tell me everything, the healers still don’t understand what’s wrong with your arm, nobody has any idea how to fix this – they just managed to patch you up enough so you wouldn’t bleed to death…’ She looked worried. Did it mean she was worried about him or was there something else?
‘Whew, that was intense…’ She whispered once the brick wall behind them was solid again. ‘I thought we were going to die out there, honestly. Harry, dear, thank you so much for getting us here safely.’
- Oh, no, no, no! – Draco wasn’t even sure how he knew what the man meant, but he did – That’s not what I was talking about! I was thinking maybe I help you unload your cart or something.
‘Thank you. Now, how would they prove conclusively that a person is first a witch and second, a potential target…?’ He got lost in thought. ‘There must be a trigger of some sort, but what would it be…?’
‘Trust me, they are. And besides, if I was part of that scheme do you honestly thing I would do it for free? I wouldn’t be living in that God forsaken place if I had a way to make money and get out of there.’
All effort was futile though. 10 minutes later Harry emerged from the bathroom still angry. It didn’t help that Malfoy still didn’t move his bloody trunk from directly under the window, like any considerate person would do, which effectively prevented Harry form opening it and checking how cold was it outside – they were having Herbology first, so it would be rather useful to know how many layers he needed on to survive in the greenhouse. But no, Malfoy didn’t care enough to think about anyone besides himself.
- Oh, so you’re not a sex worker? Sorry, I just thought, since you’re here at the break of dawn you must’ve been up all night for some reason and you don’t strike me as a party type. Again, I’m sorry…
- I… I don’t know. – Draco’s previous rage evaporated and he was left feeling ashamed and terrified for what he did. He knew very well that if it wasn’t for his friend, Dean Thomas would be lying dead on the common room floor by now. – I didn’t think. It just came over me. It couldn’t stand… - He looked at Harry, who was sitting opposite him with an unreadable expression. – I couldn’t handle the way he was speaking to Harry.
‘Exactly. So I’m assuming Voldemort just used that old spell, not thinking about what happens when someone branded with dark magic comes to contact with it.’
But it appeared that not even sleep was in the cards for Draco. He tossed and turned for the whole night and when he finally, miraculously, managed to drift away for what seemed like a fraction of a second, he was woken up by none other than Harry bloody Potter making himself a cup of coffee.
‘Nothing. Not like I would’ve answered you anyway, you called me a twink, so now I’m pouting.’ He jokingly crossed his arms at is chest. ‘Who were you into? You never answered.’
- I think we’d best not tell Normani that, handsome. – Draco forced a laugh. – From what I hear, she’s rather fond of you.
‘Honestly, that’s what I’m worried about. You know how you said that maybe being stuck with Malfoy will give him a chance to heal? Well, I think the healing went too far…’
- That doesn’t mean you’re innocent! The fact that Snape was the one to kill Dumbledore doesn’t make you any less guilty! And since you’re so keen on details, YOU FUCKING TRIED TO KILL ME IN THE ROOM OF REQUIREMENT!
He took a deep breath and made up his mind – his fellow ex-Slytherins were still up, if he asked one of them to go find Slughorn and ask for help, they will surely lend a hand. On shaky legs, he made his way back to the common room. Zabini was no longer there, but Nott and Parkinson were still sitting by the fire discussing something.
‘Ok, so as far as we know, they travel all over the country convincing elderly witches and wizards the Death Eaters are coming back. From what Ron gathered, there was at least one instance when they pointed someone –
‘If there was no objection to allow Mr. Potter to question the remaining suspects in the case, we will have to check what the bylaws state on the matter of questioning prosecution’s representative.’ Shacklebolt said hesitantly. ‘This is a highly unusual situation and I am not completely sure if Mr. Potter’s appearance in this case as a witness would not prohibit him from acting as a prosecutor.’
- Yeah, thanks Jeanelle, just been busy. Is Normani around? – He asked for his favourite escort. If anyone would be able to lift his mood tonight, it was Normani.
year, but now, after the war has ended, he wasn’t so sure anymore. He felt guilty enough about deaths he caused involuntarily and indirectly, how would he feel if he actually had to kill another human being on purpose? Wouldn’t that make him like Voldemort? No, he didn’t know what he wanted from life anymore. And now the “inter-house unity” (which he regarded as pure and utter bullshit on McGonagall’s part) only made the dream of some peace and quiet that much more unrealistic.
- You know, Draco, if I didn’t know you’re the most Slytherin of us all, I’d think you’re trying to rescue Potter’s life for other reasons than just to not end up in Azkaban…
year, during Christmas. – Pansy was whispering so that nobody else could hear her. – I was staying with his family because my parents went to Bulgaria for vacation and I didn’t want to go. He was starting to hook up with this guy that lived nearby, I think he was our year in Ravenclaw, but I’m not sure. – Harry winced.
- But I should’ve known it was too soon! – Draco’s eyes filled with tears. – I should’ve known you weren’t ready for this, I should’ve seen you weren’t doing it for the right reasons!
- I don’t know! You think it’s easy for me?! At least you didn’t know who I am! I had to lay here knowing who you are! Fuck, I all but bleached myself after last time!
- He’s un-fucking-believable! – Draco burst. – Does he really think that I want to have any connection to him whatsoever? Is he really so deluded that he still thinks that being a Malfoy would get me ahead anywhere? – Their friends fell silent at the outburst, looking at the pair worriedly. – I don’t give a shit what he thinks of me, he’s been convicted to life, he can’t do anything to me! Can he even make any decisions about the money from inside Azkaban?
‘I don’t know how to tell you this…’ Harry was looking at the floor. ‘Well, to put it simply, you scared me.’
‘Thank you, Mr. Shush.’ Kingsley said. ‘If that’s the case, which of the distinguished judges are in favour of granting the motion?’ Several hands were now raised in the air. Harry couldn’t count if it was over half or not, but Kingsley was already tallying up the vote. ‘The motion passes. Mr. Potter, will you please take the witness stand? And Mr. Malfoy, you will be escorted out for the time being.’
It was already August when both Harry and Draco finally received responses to the job applications they’ve sent weeks prior. Harry was offered a year-long training position in the Auror office under the leadership of John Dawlish, without having to undergo formal testing and training (Harry suspected that his actions during the war seemed enough for the Ministry to forgo the official path of career in his case and he hoped Ron would receive the same treatment).
‘Yeah, because your boyfriend was implicated!’ Harry hated the way Ron said ‘boyfriend’. Even more, he hated that Ron used the word in the first place.
‘Which was…?’ Draco wasn’t sure he really wanted an answer to that, but he went too far to backtrack from the conversation now.
And yet, the thought of it all made Draco’s hands shake uncontrollably. He was sitting there, on that bloody couch, razor in hand, and he was shaking like a leaf. He needed something to calm him down if this was to be a successful mission. He sighed and made his way to the kitchen – he knew Potter kept a couple of bottles of whisky and vodka in one of the cupboards. He selected what he knew to be some Slavic abomination that burned worse than Firewhisky on its way down, and poured himself a shot. God, it was disgusting! And what’s worse, it didn’t work at all. Shaking his head he concluded he needed more of it. He sat back down on the couch, looked suspiciously at the bottle and decided that shot glasses were too much of a hassle for his purposes. Throwing his head back, he took a couple of big gulps before nearly spitting it all out – he never liked Muggle alcohol. He waited a few minutes and decided it still wasn’t enough. He sighed again and braced himself for another go at the bottle. This time, when he was finished drinking, it was already half-empty. If this much alcohol in his system wouldn’t work, nothing will, he thought. But just as he arrived at that conclusion, something began rising inside him – and it wasn’t courage nor warmth he usually felt after drinking. Abandoning the vodka next to the razor on the table, he ran to the bathroom – if he was going to be sick, at least he would hurl into the toilet bowl.
Now that he made up his mind, he only needed to figure out how to approach the task he has set for himself. Even in his own head, Draco refused to call it what it was – it was just a
‘Well spotted, Potter.’ To his relief, Draco noticed a complete lack of arousal on his part, although the sensation of Potter’s body against his own still burned. ‘It wasn’t my campsite, so there must have been someone else. But why would that make a difference? We know the snatchers were there, so it doesn’t change anything.’
What exactly is there to hide from? There is nothing, he just got a little lonely now that he couldn’t go out and hook up with the girls like he used to.
‘I was afraid of losing you. I thought it’s better than nothing. I knew if I just moved out we would never see each other again, and that made me want to find that razor again.’
- Did you just say something about me? – Harry stood up. He’d been trying to ignore this kind of thing for too long now, he had enough.
‘Well, I’ve been wanting to look into becoming a healer. You know, I liked Potions and it seems like it would be a good thing for me.’ Draco still didn’t look up at anyone and Harry was understanding less and less from the supposed connection between Lucius acting like an arsehole and Draco wanting to work at St. Mungo’s. ‘But to do that you have to go through a two-year training and from what I’ve been told, the pay is ridiculous. You would have to basically carry me through for two years, I wouldn’t even be able to make a liveable wage for one person, not even with the extra hours they offer. Not to mention, there is no way I would be able to make a meaningful contribution for the both of us. I mean, it was an option when I had that vault at Gringotts’s, but now that it’s gone…’
. Although you were close with that one.’ Harry supressed a laugh. ‘As I said, they sell all different kinds of things that run on electricity that Muggles use. Like microwaves or vacuum cleaners. A vacuum cleaner is a machine that sucks dirt from your floors. It’s like sweeping, but instead of moving the dirt into one place, gathering it up on something and throwing it out, the dirt gets sucked into the inside of the vacuum by air pressure.’
‘Well, he applied for the healer job at St. Mungo’s and… and they requested character references. Some new policy or something. He needs two – I’m going to write one, but he can’t have his mother or any of his old friends from Slytherin do the other. So, I thought about you two. You know, if you have the time, maybe you could… But it’s fine if you don’t want to, we’re going to figure something out if…’
- Harry, I love you. This last year was the happiest I’ve ever been in my entire life and it’s because of you. I don’t know how I would manage without you. The only regret I have is that I didn’t admit how I felt about you sooner. But I hope we have the whole rest of our lives to make up for it. And I hope you want to spend that rest of our lives together as much as I do. – He dropped to one knee in front of Harry, still holding his hand. – Harry James Potter, love of my life, would you do me the honour of being with you forever? Will you marry me?
- Yeah, he was really unpleasant. He said it’s not normal, he said we’re perverts and that I probably want you to cut me up to get me off.
– they are really good at hiding their tracks. Why do you think the case ended up in the Auror Office anyway?’
‘Well, then, without a wand that’s as much as we’re able to do. I must say, Mr. Malfoy, your situation presents quite the conundrum to the Wizengamot…’ He paused briefly and then addressed the rest of the witches and wizards ‘Distinguished judges, I feel I need to inform you of some very unusual circumstances in this case. As you know, Mr. Malfoy had been presumed dead some 18 months ago, on the basis of the words of Mr. Harry Potter, who just so happens to be Mr. Weasley’s partner in the Auror Office, and a would-be second prosecutorial representative in this trial. Now, I say ’would-be’ because the issue of Mr. Malfoy theoretically being dead is not the only problem in this case – given that Mr. Malfoy had no permanent residence of any sort, and at the time of his capture, as done by Mr. Weasley, the rest of the suspects were yet to be found, I had to place Mr. Malfoy on house arrest, to avoid him vanishing again, and what is more, I have decided that such house arrest would be held in Mr. Potter’s apartment. As the matters now stand, Mr. Malfoy has been living with Mr. Potter for quite some time now, so it seemed only appropriate, in my opinion, that Mr. Potter would be prohibited from questioning Mr. Malfoy. I do not find, however, any grounds for such prohibition in regards to the rest of the suspects. Now, do any of the distinguished judges have any objections to this decision?’ Nobody said anything. ‘Fine then, I find that Mr. Potter will resume his prosecutorial duties after this hearing is over. Are there any motions?’ This time, a rather sour-looking witch in the second row raised her hand. ‘Madame Kessley, yes, what’s the motion?’
- But why this particular bedroom? We have no shared wall with any other bedroom, it’s the last one in the corridor, if something did happen, nobody would hear us. That cannot be safe! – he realized he was getting worked up again.
‘Never took you for a delicate flower, Malfoy.’ Harry laughed. ‘Although, it would fit…’ His voice trailed off suggestively.
‘I’ll manage to survive that responsibility.’ Draco smirked, but there was no bite to his words. Truth be told, he grew to like working with Potter on this – and it wasn’t only because it was keeping his mind off other things, although he wasn’t prepared to analyse any other reasons behind it.
- Somehow I don’t believe you. – Draco thought his hand on Harry’s shoulder must’ve done the trick, because Harry was way calmer now.
‘Draco?’ His father was a shadow of a man: he looked worse than when he came back from his previous sentence – worse than Draco ever did, even after his exile in Scotland.
- No buts, Draco. I know what I’m talking about. I felt amazing with you. The only thing that went wrong was the end and that is something we need to figure out for the future.
‘Harry, relax.’ Draco stood next to him and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder. ‘It’s normal they wouldn’t trust me with this, it is… well, was… my house. Minister,’ he looked Kingsley directly in the eyes ‘I’m prepared to do whatever you need me to. Legilimency, Veritaserum, I’m open to anything.’
‘No problem, it’s the truth. Now, since we have the job side of it figured out, do you still want my other place? I’m not using it, so it’s up for grabs really. Although I warn you, it’s rather depressing.’
‘Pace yourself, Draco, or you’ll want to stay here forever. We can get more later, it’s no good when it’s warm. Besides, I didn’t know if you’ll enjoy this. Now, are we ready to continue?’
Draco returned to his room and collapsed on the bed. His thoughts were all over the place. He knew he didn’t have much of a choice if he didn’t want to starve to death, but the thought of Draco Malfoy, the heir of what was once one of the most powerful families in the wizarding community, selling himself just to get by, made him nauseous. He laid there, going over his options again and again, until he finally fell asleep. He didn’t even hear Mina shutting the front door behind her.
‘You can’t. I’m sorry. You’re supposed to be asleep anyway – how did you wake up? They gave you two doses of sleeping potion and you only slept four hours in total…’
‘Now you’ve gone too far.’ For some reason Draco felt like he had to cool down Harry’s enthusiasm just a little. He grew to like working with him and he didn’t want the case to get blown because Potter was a hot head. ‘You can’t just arrest them for use of magic in front of a Muggle, you’ll have to wait until they actually make a move to approach their victim. If you arrest them too soon, there would be no way to establish a strong enough connection for a conviction. It’s an issue of evidence – you may know you’re right, but you need to think of how this is going to look in front of the Wizengamont. Honestly, you really need someone with at least a little bit of procedural knowledge in that office of yours…’
‘Fine, let it be. You two keep your secrets. But let me ask you this, Malfoy: how can you even touch him knowing what you were before? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’
- Okay now, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Try and relax. I’m going to go slowly, ok? – Harry nodded and closed his eyes. He was tense, but it wasn’t entirely unpleasant.
‘Not necessarily. Look at your list of victims, do any of them have any family or wizard neighbours? My guess is, they’ve set to sought out the lonely ones – if they have nobody to talk to about their decision to spend money on this ‘protection’, they’re an easier target.’
He might have been sitting there for minutes or hours or even days, he had no idea. He paid no attention to the outside world, all he focused on was Harry, and making sure he was still breathing. Once or twice a pair of hands tried to pluck him from the floor but he stiffened at the contact and they went away. Several times he felt someone pour something on the slice on his forearm, but he didn’t even register the pain. He thought he heard Weasley tell him ‘Malfoy, you can’t be here’, but he didn’t react – they didn’t know what he felt, none of them knew. So he just sat there, for however long it was, trying to silence that one, incessant voice in his head that stubbornly kept echoing ‘you lost him, he’s never coming back, you lost him
‘Malfoy.’ Harry spat, looking up at a tall, blond figure leaning against the doorframe leading to the kitchen. He had to admit, the Auror position suited the Slytherin – he was still thin and somehow ethereal, but a couple of years on the job clearly caused him to develop some muscles, because even under his uniform robes it was clear he wasn’t just skinny like he used to be. This impression only got confirmed when Malfoy moved to push his hair, now reaching his shoulder blades, out of his face – the sleeve rolled back, revealing that the blonde, must’ve indeed gotten stronger.
Faintly, Harry felt the ghost of the other man’s fingers on his own, like an imprint of what they shared back at the Manor. He didn’t know how or why, but the sensation provided him with a sudden wave of strength – very meek, in fact, not even enough to open his eyes, but in his current state it was a lot. Concentrating as hard as he could, Harry raised his hand and tangled his fingers in the blond strands next to him. He felt Draco stiffen under the touch.
‘This is my main concern right now.’ Hermione shook her head. ‘If there is nothing to replenish, because there is no loss, I’m not sure what good that will do.’
‘Harry…’ Hermione interjected. ‘Actually, I’m not sure this is the best idea. Not for your sake, even though Draco is right, you are still weak, but…’ She looked panicked ‘you
not nearly as catatonic as he was all this time. In fact, he was the complete opposite. So maybe his ‘healing process’ went a little too far? He sighed. He really needed to talk this over with Hermione, she was the only one that had a chance of solving this one. He sent a quick patronus message to the office saying he’ll be at home and to get him if he was needed and apparated to Oxford.
‘I assure you that you can. The groundwork can be done by one person and all the paperwork will not suffer if it’s being handled in the comforts of your own homes for a period of time.’ It was no changing Shacklebolt’s mind.
- Ugh, shame. It would be useful to know what he did. You know, for academic purposes. – Somehow he wasn’t ready to tell Pansy the whole truth yet.
‘You’re that impatient?’ He heard a low whisper in his ear and could only moan in response. ‘Well, since you asked nicely…’
Draco whispered another lubrication spell and bowed down to kiss Harry again. This time it was more forceful, more lustful. When their tongues collided, Draco pushed forward, breaking the barrier. Harry threw his head back and groaned. Draco froze, looking at him worriedly. “So… Good…” Harry moaned, meeting Draco’s gaze. Slowly, hesitantly, Draco pushed on, burying himself deeper. Harry’s breathing was irregular and loud, to the point Draco could barely distinguish the words that came between them: “Fuck… Just… Like… That… Fuck… Yes… You’re a god…”. The sight of his boyfriend biting his lower lip and screwing his eyes shut was sending Draco’s head into a tailspin as he thrusted into Harry faster and faster. When tentative pushes and hesitant whimpers turned into slams and unapologetic moans, he knew he wouldn’t last. He braced himself on the wall behind the headboard of the bed, looking down on Harry – he saw the Gryffindor nearing his own finish and all he could manage while holding off his own release was to drawl “Come for me, baby” through clenched teeth. That was all both of them needed. Harry came in long, white arcs, all over them both – the sight sent Draco over the edge and he collapsed under the weight of his own orgasm mere seconds later.
‘I need to use the toilet…’ Draco looked embarrassed. ‘Do they even have those here or are you supposed to just hold it for hours?’
year Gryffindors. Looking at them he began wondering if he too looked that small and innocent at their age. God, it seemed like eons ago, he couldn’t believe he was only 5 years older than them. They looked like they weren’t old enough to be out of their parents’ care – even if that care was exchanged for being looked after by a whole body of staff and house elves.
Draco, on the other hand, once he snapped completely out of the daze the room at the Manor put him in, wasn’t showing any signs of improvement. The gash on his arm was still open and the only reason it wasn’t bleeding was copious amounts of various potions and spells, and nobody seemed to be able to close it. Even Hermione, who showed up the same day Harry said his first full sentence (apparently the nurse found her petrified on the floor just minutes after Draco ran out), seemed at a loss of ideas on how to deal with the injury.
‘So then I’ll do it. There is still time for me to get stronger, because Draco is not bleeding yet.’
‘I cannot tell you that, Mr. Malfoy…’ Kingsley seemed suspicious. ‘But what I can tell you is that nothing was illegal during the proceedings.’
‘God, Draco, I…’ Harry didn’t even care if anyone heard him, it was not important. All that he cared about was that Draco was hurting and he needed to do something, anything to stop it. ‘I didn’t know. I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…’ he was once again running his fingers on Draco’s back, holding him tightly. It took a while, but the blonde seemed to calm down enough to look at him.
- I said don’t lie. If you don’t tell me what’s going on by yourself, I can make you do that. – Potter was furious by now. – Oh, but I suppose you already know that, don’t you?
‘Granger…?’ His voice was almost a whisper. He was afraid to even ask this question, but he needed to know. ‘What’s going to happen to Harry when I get convicted?’
‘Don’t forget, I was raised by Muggles. I know it’s not dangerous for me. If this is your only chance, I’ll do it.’
‘Somehow, I don’t trust you. I’m going to stay here until I’m convinced you’re stable enough to be left alone.’
…’ He didn’t even think it was possible, but that last word sent Harry even further into a high. He was moaning, head thrown back onto Draco’s shoulder as he thrusted repeatedly sucking Harry’s neck.
- I said don’t talk to me. – Harry stopped yelling, but his voice became as cold as Malfoy’s. – But since you’re so clearly desperate to know what I really think of you, here we go: you’re a pathetic excuse of a human being…
- Honestly, I don’t know. If I was talking to you and you acted like you’re acting right now, I’d believe you, but I can’t speak for other people.
‘Malfoy…? But… But how?’ Harry was really scrambling for anything coherent to blurt out. For a whole year he has been battling guilt and mourning over Malfoy’s death, blaming himself for what he thought happened and yet, here he was, defiant as ever (although Harry suspected, by the faint smell of some unknown smoke that filled the room as soon as he and Ron arrived, majorly drunk or stoned) and clearly bemused by Harry’s expression. Harry was rapidly growing furious with him – he must have known what his letter would do and now he was showing his face in Harry’s own office like nothing ever happened!
- As it happens, if I was trying to kill you, I’d just let you be. That little cocktail you so eagerly downed earlier today would’ve killed you by morning. What I “shoved” down your throat was Slughorn’s antidote.
Harry pressed the tip of his wand against Draco’s lip. They were standing so close that Draco could clearly smell that familiar mixture of scents he first encountered in Potter’s bed. Suddenly, it was way too warm in the room again. He braced himself for another hard-on, but to his surprise, nothing happened. Only when Potter stepped back there was that cold breeze again. Draco flinched and walked to the bathroom to look in the mirror.
‘There is one more. Only the Dark Lord and I knew about it, not even your mother knows. The Dark Lord created it himself…’
Once he threw himself onto Potter’s bed, he felt like he was in another world. However much Draco hated him, he had to admit the git knew how to choose a mattress. He stretched himself along the bed and drifted away almost instantly, faintly noticing being surrounded by warmth and a hint of a masculine scent that smelled like a weird but pleasant combination of sandalwood, pine and freshly cut grass.
- What do you mean? Are you going to end this right now? I’ll understand that, I mean it would be logical if you didn’t want to…
That night, lying in Draco’s bedroom, wrapped in his arms, Harry felt like he might after all fit in with Draco’s family, regardless of what Lucius thought about it – they had a plan, after all, and they didn’t need his approval when all the love Narcissa has shown them so far was more than enough to feel supported.
‘Well, if you can’t sleep, which you caused with your stupid hunch, you have to do something, don’t you?’
- Because I won’t do it. – Nott said determinately. – If after being almost cut in half Draco still didn’t feel like it was enough, than this is way beyond my level. And I know him well enough to be sure he wanted more.
This particular thought brought Malfoy back to the question that started it all – what on Earth was McGonagall going to do with the sleeping situation? His gut told him that whatever it was, he was not going to like it. But surely, she couldn’t be so stupid as to force him away from his friends, right? Sticking him in a dorm room with some random Hufflepuff would be the cherry on top of a sundae of her idiotic approach. Because if it came to this, it would have to be the shyest, most docile Hufflepuff there is – there is no way she’d room him with a Ravenclaw, they were too outspoken to risk it, there would be too much potential for a confrontation. And Gryffindors were just out of the question entirely, she can’t possibly be THAT naïve and moronic.
‘Wow, I seem to have misjudged you, Potter. I never thought you had it in you. I thought you hated me enough to use this.’ Why was he saying this? Draco was already mentally reprimanding himself for this sudden outburst of sincerity.
