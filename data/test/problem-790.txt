Draco brings his hands to Jamie’s chubby face, cups the both sides of it, “Listen here baby, I will never ever leave you, I will never think of leaving you because you are my son so don’t ever think that I will leave you someday.”
“I was just joking, Draco. You don’t have to get overly protective brother mode on!”, joked Blaise as he raised his hand in surrender. “That’s what I thought.”, said Draco as he rolls his eyes.
Keeping an arm around his waist, body as closed as possible as they walk away, Draco looked up into his emerald eyes.
Aunt Narcissa became Mother and Uncle Lucius became Father, Cassiopeia was known as his sister.
‘Flattery won’t help you out Mr Malfoy but thank you for complimenting my cloak,’ she said with an amused smile.
They were having a great time until Pansy called out to people in the common room to play a game. They were told to gather around the circle, Draco was hesitant because it was Pansy but Harry pulled his hand to the gather crowd and sat down around the circle.
He shakes his head, not wanting to stop reading and memorising, his hands reaching out for his pen to write when he is stopped by Harry. Pulling the blue pen and chucking it away, he suddenly stood up and forcefully pried his book from his hand.
“Ron and I thought that you and Malfoy were having a secret relationship and so we thought you would think we would disapprove of the relationship which we don’t -”
“But the problem is, I don’t want that. I don’t you to stay away from me. I tried so fucking hard to get your attention but you just kept on avoiding me and when I can’t take it anymore, I know I had to do something.”
‘ Of course not Professor, who do you take me for’, he beamed down at his professor. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Weasley’s face planted with disgust. He decided to continue, ‘I just try to look at the new broomstick that Potter got. Potter had been send a broomstick, did you know that, Professor?’ said Draco as he looked down for Flitwick reaction.
Severus was looking at him with a slight smirked at the corner of his haughty mouth and he was not quite sure if he liked it.
She decided to turn her head instead to look at the woman. She looks so pretty, she doesn't know if it’s her or the view that is pretty but she didn’t give a fickle.
He knows how to use the muggle camera now that he went to the Muggle Studies professor for help discreetly without anyone notice especially his Slytherin’s friends, what would they said if they saw him having a conversation with the professor.
Being in the manor was dreadful since he had to attend the Christmas Ball, it was an horrendous idea but thank Merlin, he escaped to the kitchen after a few minutes of showing his face to the guests. Being the proper Pureblood that he is.
Since the starts of Eighth Year, Muggle Studies have been a mandatory subject for the students that comes back from the war. The Muggle Studies Professor thought that it would be a great idea for students to own their own phone so each one of the Eight Year own one.
The dinner affair went well with the occasional of Draco asking them if the food was good or if there's something he can help them with. They locked eyes a couple of times with Draco giving him his sweetest smile he could muster.
“Just like your son, both of you are addicted to my boobs”, bringing his hand to his hair, stroking the identical messy hair his son had, an action he always do with Jamie's messy bird nest hair.
He complied and gave in.
A moment later, he tilted his son’s face, looking at him, “What’s wrong my baby?” Jamie was silent but his mouth was trembling with fear, “Mama don’t know how to fix it if you didn’t tell me.”
He saw red at that time but now he felt bad. Maybe he should delay the due date.
As she walks around the school with the Invisibility cloaks she nipped on the way out, draped around her so tightly, afraid that she would get caught sneaking around in the middle of the night, she thinks back to the time where life was easier but then, her life was never easy.
When he felt the spell lift off of him, he quickly stand up and dust his robes off while glaring at his sister.
Harry gave his seat to mother and instead he stood near the hospital bed, once Jamie saw Draco laying on the bed, half dead- no he was just exaggerating. Jamie ran to him and Harry helped him hop on the bed, Draco introduced his twin brothers to Jamie.
‘I don’t want to sound like I don’t appreciate living with the Malfoys, Mother loves me as much as she loves her very own daughter, she really could have just treated me like Father did, put a lot of expectations in me and Cassie just to show that the Malfoy’s are better than other Pureblood family’, with his arms stiffed besides his body, he didn’t dare to hug him back because he never hug someone who is Father’s age, especially Father.
As they were walking to the study room, Iris took her hand in hers, “We got this, Cel. I know we can go through this. We go through war and we surely can go through this together.”
He crawled to the other side of the bed, he got on his hands and knees, displaying his cute butt in the air.
‘Then how in the bloody hell you took the right ingredients’, asked Draco. He was confused since Potter is the one who took the ingredients, how would he not know how the ashwinder egg looks like.
Draco turned his attention to Weasley, ‘Did anyone in the Slytherin break your heart,Weasel? Maybe you can’t move on from the heartbreak, that’s why you have trust issues with the Slytherins and you, Potter”, he turned his head addressing Potter, ‘Did he already brainwash your close-minded head like him? You better find a new friend Potter or is he the only person who wants to be friends with The-Boy-Who Lived?”
Their kisses turned messy, Draco just took whatever Harry gave him.
The moment is precious to him. He promised to himself that he will marry Draco one day and have little Potters running around his house. He doesn’t care anymore about their huge age gap.
“Stop teasing him, Draco,” said Harry, “You know how he gets when things don’t go his way,” rolled his eyes at their antics, resting his elbows on the trolley’s handle, pinching Jamie’s puffed cheeks.
“What does that have to do with Potter not going to Hogwarts? - wait- wait I know, so that he realised that his friends doesn’t write him anything and then he will feel isolated. You want to make he thinks that his friends doesn’t want them to be his friends anymore so then he that makes him don’t want to go to Hogwarts”, said Draco as he carefully wrapped the bandage around the injuries. He looked at Dobby for confirmation as Dobby nodded his head yes.
“It is not wrong to want freedom. Everyone wants freedom. I promised you Dobby, one day I will get you your freedom.”, murmured Draco softly as tiredness taken over his body with Dobby sleeping next to him.
Writing the caption for his post, as he is attaching more various posts of sleeping Draco on his page.
Maybe he was feeling jealous with Potter looking good in that. Weasley looks hideous added with his red hair.
“Yes, I would love to.”
“Thanks, baby. Besides you are 16 years old while I was 11, it would be totally weird.”
He have to say something because right now, he was not joking, he rather got hang by the wrist then going inside an unknown territory.
They were in Slytherin Common Room when he finally told them what happened, Pansy smacked him right in the head for acting like a Gryffindor. Blaise was mouth agape since he told them about the offer.
He was going to skip a few class today because he doesn’t want to face Potter so he lay on his bed looking up at the ceiling without realizing his eyes are slowly closing until blackness took over.
Draco quickly run to his place, entered the key on the lock, turned it and closes the door with a loud bang once he was inside, he immediately ran to his bed and hide his face into his soft pillow, screamed as loudly as he can until he was red in the face and out of breath.
Harry was looking at him up and down and crushed their lips together, he slides his hand to Draco’s neck and pulled him closer.
He knows he shouldn’t because scared that it will get Draco pregnant but time like this makes his brain go fuzzy and he can’t think straight. He vanished his cum inside Draco as quickly as he could when he felt it trickle down to his cock that was still inside of Draco and out of his hole.
When Potter’s enormous length hit his prostate, he screamed so loud that he came.
“Jamie, why don’t you come here for me. I miss having you in my arms.” coaxed Draco softly as they were sitting themselves down on the bench they installed in the perimeter of their house.
‘I’m getting sick of you, Malfoy! You know that, you are just a snobby Pureblood and like to act tough in front of your friends but trust me, if you are alone, you will coward away just like every single Slytherin that had been sorted before’, shouted Weasley furiously, he was standing up now, fingers grasped tightly into a fist.
When they finally arrived, Harry put him down and hand scrambled into the basket, finding a blanket that he had prepared and laid the blanket on the grass.
Her stomach churned with how nervous she felt right at the moment but she’s the chosen one. If she can kill Voldemort, she can obviously meet her girlfriend’s parents. Celestial let go of their intertwined hands, wiping the sweat on her dress.
And that is when he realized that it was his turn when he heard Professor McGonagall called his name.
He woke up to a sound of his husband cooing their newborn sons, he slowly sat up on the bed. When Harry noticed his husband was awake, he put his children down on the hospital crib and walked towards him and helped him put a pillow behind his back, Draco gave him a soft thank and lean back.
So, he obeyed and moaned, his moaning rang around the room, he don’t know what happened but then he felt the tip Harry’s huge thick cock around his opening.
Professor McGonagall was running towards them with a face as furious as Father when he got caught going into his father’s chamber that was full of dark objects.
“Whatever I say, you don’t interrupt me.” She is inclined, Iris on the other hand is about to step up and defend her girlfriend in every way, no one can make Celestial feel worthless, not even herself.
As the lesson goes by with Harry’s palm rested on his left thigh, Harry was very distracting as he was trying very hard to concentrate on the lesson.
“Wait for me in the living room, let me prepare your food while you pick any movie to watch on the telly”, said Draco as he turned his body around, continuing preparing food for his tired husband. Harry gave him one last kiss on his cheeks and left the kitchen, leaving Draco alone.
Draco was minding his own business when he heard the trio talked about a dragon, so he decided to listen for more.
“How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, very reasonably priced-”, his sentence was cut off, poor old soul, Draco thought.
She doesn't know how she feels about the knowledge Hermione spits out of her mouth, she wants to believe her since she is the Miss Know-It-All for a reason but what if she gets her hopes high and it was actually just a rumour? But what if it’s all true? Would Celestial want a woman like her?
“Could you be any louder? Besides, it’s none of your business but if you must know, it’s someone really special to me.”
‘I was furious with her at first when she informed me she’s marrying Sirius Black because he gave me hell at school. He and James Potter gave me a lot of hell but she told me that he had changed and that I should not dwell on the past.’
When Slytherin scored a point, everyone from the Slytherin was cheering furiously for their house, everyone seems to have their eyes on the Quaffle but Draco’s eyes was on Potter on finding the Snitch. No one seems to noticed that his broom was acting strangely.
Aidan is the only sibling of Harry who is younger than him, a year younger. He was a shy boy who loves to play video games in his room, his first impression of him is that he looked like an arrogant arsehole but fortunately, he was none of them. They sometimes even play video games together.
“I’m close Harry.”, said Draco when he can feel the intensity on his cock. He knew he was going to come undone- as he spread his legs wider on the ground.
There are three long tables, on the first table, there were a lot of birthday gifts, and on the second table there are a lot of foods for the guests cooked by the house-elves obviously. The house-elves in the manor were treated poorly by his father and he came to hate the action of him. So he will always thank the house-elves whenever he asks and orders them.
“I’m going to take a shower first”, informed Harry to Draco, he nodded his head, opened his eyes as he watched his husband walked out of the room and quietly closing the door behind him after giving him a loving smile directed at them.
“I would rather go through war again than facing them.”
Draco took his hand and held it into a fist, Dobby followed his instructions slowly and when their fist collided, Draco let out a soft puff followed by Dobby's own.
She pulled Celestial to her and hugged her tightly, her hand giving comfort by stroking her back in a slow motion, while kissing her forehead.
Harry brought his rough hand to Draco’s red tinted cheek, Draco curled his face into it, he let his guards down because he felt safe around Harry.
The end of the school year finally came and he was already twelve years old three weeks before, he was showered with a lot of gifts since he was a spoiled brat, he appreciate it nonetheless.
“I beg your pardon, sir?” now Draco are getting angry because this bitch doesn’t understand English. Before he gets to open his mouth to speak again, arms slides around his waist, hugging him from the back and their chin rests on his shoulder.
‘Something, I wish she didn’t leave me too early. Maybe she could persuade Sirius to not go after Pettigrew, maybe I got to grow up with them.’ He brought his hand to his face to wipe the tears away but the tears kept on streaming down his face and he can’t make the tears to stop.
She knew the blonde head too well. It was her former rival turned crush. Celestial Malfoy is the woman who makes her realize she is not as straight as she thinks she is.
Finally, the truth came out of his mouth. The bed squeaked as Harry sat down.
He knows that he was acting like a child not getting their favourite candy from the store. He was muttering under his breath, not satisfied with Harry’s action.
“Don’t you think that you put too much pressure on yourself, star?” Harry asked with a frown, worriedly scanning Draco’s whole body. Seeing the effect of his overworking boyfriend. “Have you eaten yet?”
He doesn’t know why Longbottom would be scared of Theo, he was the most coward person Draco ever knew before Longbottom, Theo was scared of literally everything, he was even scared of Nott Sr.
‘At least we are not looking for attention, as you know Gryffindor love to be in the centre of attention’, shouted Theo as he cupped both of his hand around his mouth.
Their eyes was shone so brightly.
Pansy rests her phone on the windowsill, position the phone perfectly against the window glass the way she wanted. When she was ready, she stand in the frame and set the timer and pressed the button to start.
Draco wound up his arms around Harry when he felt a rough hand squeezing his buttocks that made him whimpered into the kiss.
The argument stops with just a single word from Mrs Malfoy calling out to his husband, in a way that tells him to stop acting like a child and let her take over.
‘I didn’t mean to be rude professor but I was mildly curious. I wanted to be a healer when I grow up’, he grinned widely as he added the piece of information which is a lie obviously, he wouldn’t want to be a healer, a job to tend someone is not his cup of tea.
Longbottom did not just say that, Draco don’t know about Blaise and Theo but he never said that to Longbottom. He only giving him advice saying maybe he shouldn’t be in Gryffindor because he not brave enough, he did not use the word ‘coward’, he used ‘not brave enough’. On a second thought, he did say that but he didn’t mean it in that way.
‘ Professor!’, he called out to him. Professor Flitwick stopped his walking and waited for him. When Draco was at his side, he asked him if there’s a spell that could make someone invisible.
“Apologize for the trouble, Mr Borkin.”, said Draco as he followed behind father, Cassie swiftly put the skull back on the shelf he took from it. He whispered his gratefulness to her.
“I know and that’s why they fled and didn’t share the compartment with me for too long, you are the first actually,” said Lovegood as she smiled innocently at him.
“Who do you think that might charmed the Gryffindors?”, asked Cassie curiously as she looked around the hall, probably trying to find the guilty person.
They at least find six constellations when Draco finally notices his Draco constellation. He gets excited and slaps his broad chest and shows it to him eagerly.
The nubs came into hardness as he bit the nubs softly but still can leave bruise. His fingers was flicking and twiddling his other nubs.
As he thrust into Draco, Draco’s body slowly dropped down to the bed and Harry’s arms were the only support to hold himself up.
“Well - yes but no? Does that make sense?”
Both of them are stunned, look at each other and grimaced while shaking their head, “Nope, it’s okay, Draco could take the title, I surely do not want to kiss Father's cheeks, most important I don’t want to see the expression on his face.”, said Cassie while shaking her head aggressively. Draco agreed with her.
“You really can’t let me and your mama have our own moment huh, my little Jamie?” hoists him of the ground and into his father’s strong arm, ruffling Jamie’s black messy hair that was identical to his with his free hand, kissing his head.
With trembling hand, he hid the skull and turn his back towards father and Mr Borkin, walking slowly to his destination.
He laughed and asked about Caleb and Aidan - Caleb is a mean flirt who is the middle child of the family, after Dahlia of course, he sometimes would flirt with him just to spice his big brother up. He’s a musician and loves to write songs and sing.
“But Father I - “
Leaning down, he connected his lips to Harry’s, even when they were out of breath, their lips never stray away from each other. With his position, laying on top of Harry like this, someone might see his knickers but as he said - no one was around and he doesn’t care.
Crabbe jr and Goyle jr were looking at their parents with admiration.
“Sorry baby dragon. I forgot myself whenever I looked at you”, said Harry looking not sorry at all, grinning mischievously at his Draco.
Although his vision was blurry, he can see his husband was holding on to his second child, he still haven’t know the gender yet because when they did their monthly check-up and the healer told him if they wanted to know the gender of their babies, they’re both shaking their head no, they wanted it to be a surprise.
Harry stopped for a second and took a deep breath before continuing with the encouraging look from Draco.
“Ewwww ugleee eww”, pointed Jamie and laughed at the stranger, the stranger’s smile dropped and sneered at his son.
“Oh, I put it on the counter before I left.”
“The fact that your partner is a girl. I thought you were dating Nott’s only child, Theodore. What happened?” she asked in a stern motherly voice.
When Mother waited for him at the door and saw that he brought no trunk with him, she asked, “Draco, where is your trunk, we have to be quick it's half past ten now, we don’t want you guys to miss the train on the first day.”
“You know Mr Filch, if you want to punish us by hang us then do it. It’s better than listening to you talk about nonsense you know; maybe as you hang us, you could find yourself a partner for life. Heaven knows you needed that. I was even nice enough by using formality”, said Draco as he bite back, sneering at him but he wasn’t finished yet.
“I want to borrow one of Weasley’s books, I heard he was rather good at some subject.”, said Draco without waiting for Madam Pomfrey to ask him questions.
‘I’m going to go out there and die at the hand of our Transfiguration professor, I’m digging my own grave now’.
And just like that, Celestial took her head into the palm of her hands and kissed her hard. Iris eyes wide open like saucers until she grasps the possibility that it is in fact her crush’s mouth on hers.
Harry broke the kiss and went down on him. Leaving bruises on the way until he reached his breast. He gave his nipples full attention by licking the nubs attentively, Draco was groaning beneath him.
Father spokes so he looks back at him,“But right now you are under my roof so you should listen and do not disgrace the name of Malfoy, understood?” Father looked him in the eye and Draco nodded.
“Yeah, definitely angel like you”, teased Harry sarcastically. Draco was pinching Jamie soft chubby cheeks while he was playing with Draco’s long platinum blonde hair.
He breathed harshly in Draco’s ear, murmuring dirty words. His fingers came up to Draco’s perky tits, pinching the soft flesh.
“Mother, I love Iris so much. She makes me want to be a better person and if you don’t want to accept our relationship, I won’t back away. I’m coming here to inform you instead of you finding this out from the newspaper.”
She looked down at their intertwined hand and mumbled to herself but most of the students can hear her including them.
When he finally arrived in front of the portrait door to the Slytherin Common Room, he whispered the password and the door opened involuntarily, the common room was filled with students, some of them were looking out into the huge window that shows the Black Lake, he doesn’t even know what are they looking for, probably the merman but they rarely show. Some of them are studying since final exam are coming and some are playing with their mates.
She smirked at him as if she knows what’s he’s doing, ‘Okay tell me what actually happen in summer 1994?’.
As they were looking at the stars, they talked more about their life, how living with rich parents was like, how does it feel living as an only and being the older brother to three younger siblings on Harry’s behalf. His last sibling was one year younger than Draco.
‘Merlin’s pants that’s must be Filch’s cat’, he thought to himself.
“Ooh not very friendly”, he smirked as his eyes landed on Weasley’s schoolbag and had the brilliant idea to mess with his schoolbag, he did told Madam Pomfrey he wants to borrow some of Weasley’s books.
She then turned her head from Harry Potter to the ginger head boy who Draco realized is a Weasley, she reached out her hand to him and introduced herself, “Hello, My name is Cassiopeia Ma-,” the boy stop her and look at her with disdain, “Yeah, I know who you are, you are a Malfoy”, he spat when he said the word ‘Malfoy’.
“Goodnight Jamie”, whispered Harry.
Longbottom is brave if someone train him to be. He just need to be trained.
Sorry for the late update.. I really try but anyways I haven't write chapter 6 so you guys better be careful.
Draco gave a heavy moan when his cock hit his prostate, he regained control when Draco slumped down to his chest, already tired.
He then walked into Draco’s nursery room, taking in the surroundings trying to remember it. A room that will never be resided by Draco, he will never watch his boy growing up but he hopes that Draco will have a good life with The Malfoys.
“Fuck- Harry of course Harry! Fuck I love you - I love you my fiancé. Of course I would be your husband, Of course I’ll be Draco Potter. It’s a yes Harry, a thousand yes.”
“Where are they right now? I want to see them right now” asked Draco, trying very hard to lift his tired head so he can look at his sons? So he gave birth to twin sons, he smiled at that thought.
Professor was calling Daphne when he was dazing out of thought. He turned to her when she walked near him and gave her a squeeze on her shoulder and Cassie walked to stand beside him.
Draco was going nuts, he can’t think straight if Harry kept on doing that to him, he’d been obsessed with his hole since the first time they tried rimming.
They walked together into the classroom, Goldstein called to him and pointed his fingers to a chair besides him but Potter looking rather annoyed, took his hand and intertwined their fingers together, walked him to a table that was occupied by Pansy and Granger.
Peeves was a pain in his arse at midnight although he haven’t been caught by him yet. He still haven’t learn the Disillusionment Charm and it was a risky situation that he took when he wandered at night.
He then followed Hagrid back to the other group, face still fuming red. This is all Longbottom’s fault, if it was not for his cowardice, he wouldn’t even be in this situation but at least he caught everything on camera, memories he could never forget.
“NEXT TIME HARRY, YOU AND YOUR STUPID BIG COCK SHOULD STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME,” shouted Draco at his face, the grip of his hand on Harry’s tighten, breathing in and out from both his mouth and nose.
‘ CONFUNDO’, he shouted as he pointing his wand at the troll and then he realized it did not work.
When they walked in Potion room, Severus was embarrassing Potter with questions, Potter looked at his Weasel friend hoping that he knows the answer but his friend shrugged his shoulders, Potter obviously doesn’t know the answer but the bushy-haired girl eagerly raise her hand but was ignored by Severus. Draco walked quietly and took a seat at the back of the class so no one realized that they were late but Severus did notice.
‘I didn’t mean to -’, said Weasley at the door.
And he decided from there on he liked this weird girl, she spoke whatever came to her mind without filtering her words and he quite liked it.
Before Draco gets to pocket it so he could give it back to Longbottom, Potter speaks up. ‘Give that here, Malfoy,’ said Potter quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Draco who has the brilliant idea says hastily, ‘It’s none of your business, Potter. I’m just going to give it back to Longbottom.’
Draco let out a frustration groans and gave his friend a look that dare her not to test him but his friend just waves him off.
He regrets those decisions instantly as he bent down, Harry smells like he just licked his butthole. He pulled a disgusted face as he walked away from him.
“You know Longbottom, I heard there’s a missing spider in the train, it might be on this one though so be very cautious all the time,” teased Draco and walked back out. He heard a shriek as he closed the compartment door and cast a sticking spell so the door would be open when it arrived at Hogwarts.
“No wonder you are so old,” Draco smirked while looking at him up and down, teasing him.
Draco laughed and he sensed a prickle of tears coming out of his eyes, he wiped it away as quickly as he could before others saw him. They both turned their heads and looked towards where Jamie is, he was being pampered by his grandma’s.
“Oh wait,” she pulls her phone out of her Coach sling bag, and with a quick tap, she hands him her phone and tells him to add his number in.
It was a late Christmas gift from the information he received on the letter that came with the camera.
They have been going on like this for one and half years.
He scrolled through her Instagram account without a word, his big finger swiftly tapped on Draco’s account which he was delighted when he could see his feed full of photos of Draco smiling, doing some action and a few pictures of him with his friends group.
“Are you busy right now, Mother?” Draco asked, concerned since he doesn’t want to bother her. “No, no I’m just analyzing the restaurant's success, that’s it. What can I do for you?” looking up at him, as she took off her reading glasses.
“Everything about you are so beautiful, how can I be so fucking lucky? Fuck maybe I’m god’s favourite that he sent down his own angel to me.”
When Draco looked over at Granger with a binocular he confiscated from Pansy, which he get a whacked from.
When Draco and Cassie were little, they would practice riding the broom with Mother watching them cautiously, scared that if she turned her attention away from them, they would be missing or worse break a bone, sometimes they would sneak out without Mother. Sometimes, he would ride with the house-elves, mostly Dobby because most of them are afraid of Father and although Mother disagreed with the behaviour, she kept her quiet.
Draco looked back to his friends and signed in defeat, ‘Tell Cassie I love her and that I was and am sorry that I can’t spend my life longer with her’.
“Draco! The twins just woke up and wanted to be fed,” Molly shouted at the door while holding Adrian, trying to lull him to stop but failed miserably.
Now he was terrified, where did she go now. He last saw her when she was rushing somewhere but at that time, he didn’t care to notice where she went because he just got back from the library, eyes tired trying to find any information about the stupid dog.
“I’m- fuck Harry- I’m gonna cum”, whimpered Draco beneath him, he was fucking Draco so hard like there is no tomorrow. He pushed himself into Draco frantically, the creaking sound of the bed made as he kept on fucking him hard.
He turned his head to look at Dobby. He was still sleeping while clutching his injured hand, Draco felt bad for him, he wished he could free all of the house-elves because no one deserve to be a slave.
“Such a happy kid your son is,” said Draco as he walked up to them, one hand supporting his belly while his other hand grabbing Harry’s free hand and together they walked to the shop.
Of course, of course it was bloody Peeves, the insufferable Poltergeist. Although he had only been here for a month and a half, he already hated the poltergeist present.
He leaved enough hickey to last for three days or more for people to see, he then comes down to his chest, kissed the scar and sucked lightly on his nipples. Draco was trashing under him. Draco can’t wait anymore, ‘Harry, please fuck me, I can’t take it anymore, I want to feel you inside me’, begged Draco.
He stood up from the stool and bowed in front thousands of Hogwarts students and smirked, everyone was speechless. He walked towards the Slytherin table and sat next to Cassie who had saved him a seat. She then questioned him and told him that he was a hatstall, he was proud of himself because only a few people were hatstall.
She detached herself slowly from Harry who sleeps like there was no tomorrow, a mumbling protest from his boyfriend as she walks to the bathroom to clean herself.
“I love you, baby.”
Draco was so fucking angry at this moment, he wanted to wreck havoc this dirty, ugly and cheap store but the hand smothering his back reminds him that he have to keep his cool because he’s a pureblood.
The twin on Draco’s arms suddenly cry, so Draco pushed his labor gown open and groped his breast, moving slowly to his son’s tiny mouth, his fragile moved around trying to find his mama’s milk and when he found it, he quickly latched onto Draco’s nipples, draining the milk into his mouth.
‘Cassie!’, he shouted as the door unlocked by the spell, he pushed the door open, Cassie was pointing his wand at the troll, Granger was hiding behind her, both of their faces shown an emotion of fright.
The dragon will be sent to somewhere on Saturday night; Potter and friends are on it, they will bring the letter to the tallest tower which is the Astronomy Tower at midnight. Should he tell a professor on them? If he did tell on them, it would be Professor McGonagall since she was the head of their house and they will get in so much trouble than any other professor.
‘Jeez, sorry you don’t have to be mean and Stop calling me Draco Black, I live with the Malfoy and they are my family,’ he rolls his eyes at the sorting hat.
‘He knows!’ , screamed Draco at the phone and end the call, threw the phone on the bed and decided that he need to sit.  He sat down at the edge of the bed and hunched over and rubbed his face with both hand.
With a hoarse voice, Draco speaks quietly, ‘I’m sorry for Sirius action towards you when you where at Hogwarts.’
‘You remind me a lot of her that him actually.’
ps: I read back this chapter for any grammar mistake and let me tell you, I fucking hate it ;)
Iris took a swipe at her girlfriend’s bottom lips.
“You do know that I only have my eyes for you,” murmured Harry, Draco turned his head and looked up into Harry’s eyes, brushing his fringe out of the way, stand on his toes since Harry was taller than him, kissed him on the lips.
He was the first person to show up when eleven o’clock hits, what can he say he was a punctual person. He was waiting patiently while hoping he could probably give a few punch at Filch’s face for smile cruelly at him.
‘Oh shut up’.
His attention turns towards Draco, his eyes bored into Draco’s face with loathing sometimes, Draco always noticed but he never confronted him about it. Severus’s  would never fix on him for too long as if Draco’s face reminds him of his sour past.
“What do you want barging in my room unannounced”, said Draco annoyed because she disturb him while he was sleeping peacefully, he take it back- it was not peaceful because it was bloody hot right now that he had to cast a cooling charm around his room.
Pansy waved him off and told him that she already prepared for it.
To everyone including the teacher, he was the innocently brilliant at every subject student but mean and snarky towards the one he thinks are not worth his time but at night his sneaky side emerge to the surface. No one realised he sneaked out at night including Blaise and Theo.
“I understand if you hate me,” said Draco, giving up, releasing Jamie from his embrace and getting up from the bed.
He with his back on them, raised his voice so they could hear them, “Next time, I think you should change your attitude when meeting someone new, you know because people look down on the poor, Weasel, Good day”, and nodded his head.
His body hurts with the way his husband railed him last night. Harry didn’t even give him time for a rest but he loves those moments because he’s a horny bastard who is carrying his child. It was the least Harry could do.
Before he gets to question himself in his mind what Harry is trying to do. Harry declared his proposal, his hands are slowly opening the red coloured ring box.
“The Weasley boy surely has a problem with everyone,” he thought to himself and a piece of hatred towards the boy grew in his heart.
Few minutes later, the floo flame ignites and Harry’s legs rushed inside the house, with his Auror robe still on him to where Draco was sprawling on the floor with Jamie.
Father was giving him a look and he wanted to say something but Mother cut him off.
“I want to mess with Potter for a bit.” Before he could walk to Potter, he was held back by the earlobe. He stumbled back as Cassie dragged him far away from him, “Not on my watch, you better be on your best behaviour.”, scolded Cassie. Pansy and Blaise had to clamp their hand to their mouth so they don’t show that they were laughing at him.
For the first time in forever, he was agreeing to Weasley’s statement, not that he hate Theo, it just that Longbottom need to be tough and just inform McGonagall about the bullying he received.
He scrambled out of the room once the door was open followed by them and rushed to the dungeon with Blaise and Cassie trailing behind him.
He just has to be particularly patient for 16 more years after the Battle of Hogwarts and now he finally receives the gift from the universe and he will never let Draco go. He didn’t care if they had an older man and younger man relationship.
“Harry- I’m ready, shove your cock in me, Harry!”, said Draco, Harry raised Draco’s body up, holding his cock from the base, giving it a few tugs and slide home.
He came up to him and gave him a chaste kiss, Harry took his hand in his as he deepened the kiss, his hands then coming down to his husband’s bum and squeezed the soft globe firmly.
“Yeah it’s alright. Thank you,” giving him a charming smile as he handed the menu back to him. Tucking the pen in his breast pocket, he collected the menu from his waiting hand and continued to  stack up the menus from all of them into his hands.
Father continues, “Now, remember what I said at breakfast, do not disappoint me.”
“Look mama look, birdie,”, said Jamie as he pointing his tiny finger to the bird that was flying freely in the blue sky.
“I realised that I have fallen in love with you since last October and now it’s almost October again,” Iris confessed while sitting on a rooftop of her late godfather’s childhood house. They were cleaning the house, throwing away everything they deem shit to make the house bearable to live at least.
Before they were walking to the Apparition point, he saw a pet that caught his eyes in The Magical Menagerie and he wants to own it so badly but he knows that Father won’t allow any animal in the house, while there are a freaking albino peacock outside in the garden but Mother on the other hand, has a soft spot for him so he use his sneaky side and grinned at her.
Mother should pay him well today because he doesn't know why today has to be the day where customers would suddenly love to have their dinner here. They could have another day to come, oh but no they have to choose the day he decided to work.
I gave you a 7k+ words now thank me.
He hates feelings like this, the sad emotion that he tried to suppress for so long. Since he found out about them he tried not to dwell on it.
Mother sends a lot of presents for Cassie for her birthday in September such as clothes, accessories and a bunch of chocolates from around the world. Father gave Cassie a necklace of the House of Malfoy that was to pass on to their first-born daughter at the age of eleven. Draco did give her something, a prank to change her hair colour for a day and she was not amused.
‘I’m not mad at you, just at Nott’, she sighs heavily, arms crossed each other. The winter air hits them as they were walking outside. She was breathing heavily as her mouth and nose producing a small, misty cloud from her breath.
He was sucking on in his hole, Harry’s face was literally buried into his arse that his glasses went askew.
The hat answered him proudly, ‘You can judge me how you want Draco Black, but I held the knowledge that the Wizarding World doesn't, so now let me ask, where shall I put you?’
“It will only happen in your wildest dream, Draco. You are too pale for me,”, answered Pansy as she rolls her eyes, checking her nails.
“Merlin, not just the hat could sort people, it could also sing, please make it stop, I rather listen to Dobby singing that piece of dirty cloth”, he thought to himself and grimace.
Her cheeks went red when she looked around and saw that everybody was looking their way. “Uhm - now I’m embarrassed,” she looked down, walking away like a bolt of lightning from the attention with Iris in tow, without them realising that they were holding hands.
“Don’t, we put both of these in my room and then we come down for the party,” he stood up and walked towards his room, he then put the newspaper and the moving photo on his study desk.
After he had given Harry his address, he then carefully lifted one foot up and climbed on it. Believe it or not, he has never been on a motorbike because Father has never been a big fan of one. He would look down on someone who owns one, and he doesn’t know why.
Sounding annoyed at Harry’s antics trying and succeeding in scaring them as he is speaking with Harry through his mind using the bond they shared since their mating day.
Bye! See you next time! leave me some comment that I could reply and kudos if u liked!
‘Hi Malfoy’, said Goldstein as he smiled at him dauntlessly. Draco noticed that he was standing too close to him that their shoulders brushed together.
“I know why you are trying to stress yourself out. Who gives a shit what your devil of a father might say. I know for damn sure that Narcissa would be proud of you no matter what marks you get. Stop trying to prove to him,” he emphasized each word so that it could get through his head.
‘Five points to Ravenclaw’, said Slughorn as he lays the Amortentia on his table. He then continues, ‘What did you smell if you don’t mind telling the class?’
“What the bloody hell, Cassie!”, shouted Draco as he picked himself up off the ground. When he looked back at Dobby, he was awake because of her horrible voice and she had the audacity to cackle at both of them but especially him.
“So what do you thing about it?” asked Pansy again after he has taking out his frustration by flicking the owner of the book’s face on the cover.
“Yeah, when we were smoking cigarettes like right now.”
“Want to see Mama?” he asked, as Jamie rubbed his red rimmed eyes with his chubby hands, he nodded his head. “Let’s go then,” kissing his son’s head.
The feeling of Harry’s huge cock in him will always amazed him since the first time they had sex in Eighth Year in Hogwarts. Reminds him of the year where Harry was trying to pursue him, where he didn’t even bother to even look at Harry and Harry was having none of it, forced him into an empty classroom and the rests were history.
Harry’s head went to his round stomach, kissing it lightly all over the area he could reach. “How are they doing today?”, asked Harry, his hand are coming up to Draco’s thigh, knead it smoothly, inch by inch, he can feel two fingers invading his hole but not quite inside yet, rubbing his fingers at his opening.
“How would you even know about that,” if looks could kill, he would be dead now by Cassie’s furious and annoyed look.
“Let me carry him, you are pregnant, Draco. Don’t put too much pressure on your body.”, said Harry as he bend down to pick his exhausted son, walking to his room with Draco trailing behind him, walking slowly.
Suddenly, he felt a strong arm on his waist pulling him, pulling him closer to Potter. Draco looked at him but Potter was looking at Goldstein with a hint of possessiveness in his eyes. The arm on his waist squeezed him tighter the longer Goldstein looked at him.
‘ I think we’ve lost him,’ Potter panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiped his forehead. Draco casts a cooling charm at Cassie, Blaise and himself since they were sweating furiously from the running. Longbottom was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. He decided to take pity on him and cast the spell on him too.
Mind full with lust, his aggressively trying to take Harry’s shirt off by lifting the hem but was denied by Harry.
‘Well, first of all I know if I used you for the trend, it will blow up because you have a body of a china doll, it’s delicate and it makes guys swoon and girls jealous over you. Second of all, a lot of guys on the app want you again in my account since you don’t have one. Third of all, showing off your skin with less clothes will make mans go savage over you. Is the reason enough or I have to add more ?’ asked Pansy as she tucked away her phone into her pocket.
Draco had to snort that his husband was being a cheesy flirt.
‘Where you want to go Cass?’, asked Draco as he was just done with the food. Draco looked at Theo and his eyes was angry with fury because of what have Cassie said to me, which he might add was true. Blaise was avoiding everyone eyes as he looked down at his plate and eat in silent.
He picks his new born baby up and cradle him to his chest, he spoke quietly not wanting to wake his wife up, “Hello my beautiful son, welcome to the world, I'm your daddy and she is your mommy, your mother is exhausted right now so we should let her sleep a little longer. We have decided to name you my baby”, he turned to his friends and introduced him to them.
‘I really am grateful for Mother and Cassie but sometimes I just imagine a world where I lived with them, you know?’, he can’t control the tears that streaming down his face.
“Dobby took his letters for now, Dobby do not want Harry Potter to go back to Hogwarts.”, said Dobby as he watched Draco carefully.
“We don’t want Madam Pomfrey to know about your dragon bite, right? It would really be a shame for the gamekeeper to lose his job, his only job.”, said Draco evilly, waiting for Weasley to give in.
They then walked to their table to enjoy their breakfast, both of them are wearing a Slytherin colour cloak. It suits them well actually if he must admit.
“Right, silly of me,” said Draco, forgetting that Muggle men couldn’t get pregnant like wizard could. Sometimes he forgot all about the information about non-magic humans. Draco looked behind him at Jamie, he was enjoying the view, hand trailing the clouds.
Finally, after a long minute of Professor McGonagall looking stunned, she came back to her senses and addressed him.
He was at the front gate of the Malfoy Manor and a house-elf appeared and walked him to the hall. In his arms, Draco was wrapped in a blanket. He held his son tightly knowing he had to let go of him. He doesn't know what the future holds but he knows for sure that he will never meet his baby again, or at least for a while.
“Jamie, can you please fetch mama’s wand on the table,” said Draco as he pointed his finger at his wand, Jamie ignored him because he was too focus with playing his toys so maybe he didn’t hear him so he repeated himself again, shouted as he felt another jab of pain.
Draco folded his arms together and told him that he left a lot of hickey on him and Harry had this smug look on his face that he wish he could punch it without ruining the beautiful face.
He was with Crabbe and Goyle, since they decided to follow him today and not Cassie, when he saw Potter holding the large parcel with Weasley followed by so he decided to mess around or rather, bothering them.
“But I don’t think you are a Malfoy, you are confused about yourself,” continued her again. What does she mean he’s confused? “Your head is full of Whackspurt, it makes people’s brains become unfocused and confused,” she explained her theory as one hand up in the air, waving it on the thin air as if she’s trying to chase out the Whackspurt.
“Yes, love. Just to have your parents' blessing and what makes it even weirder is that I asked for your father’s blessing - for fun because I want to marry you anyways with or without his blessing, he actually gave me his blessing and gave some future warning if I ever do you harm.”
The Slytherin table was abrupted with cheers and shouts louder than others first year Slytherin maybe because Cassie is a Malfoy.
Harry Potter, 35 years old DADA professor, desires Draco Malfoy who is 16 years old. He knew it was a huge age gap, he knew it was wrong.
Harry gave the phone to Draco, he held it in his hand, stretching his arms so that Harry’s face could be in the frame too and he answered all of her questions and then decided to ask her about her day filming the upcoming new movie she starred on.
Draco knows Pansy and he knows that she going to blackmail him by telling Potter his crush on him and Draco was not ready for the world to know it. ‘You will not!’, shouted Draco.
They were preparing for bed after he had checked up on the twins, they were still sleeping soundly, unbothered by their surroundings. With a wave of his hand, the lights were turned off and his arm wrapped around Draco tightly, bringing him closer to him, legs tangled with his.
Draco rushed towards them and slowed down his pace when he was trailing close behind McGonagall.
The fingers on his hole assault his hole and it inch in, one finger in, he moved his finger until it reach its knuckle and repeat the movement for a few minutes, when he felt Draco’s hole loosen up a bit, he added a second finger meanwhile his mouth are trying to leave hickey on his neck.
When he realized something, his eyes were wide open with the realization, his mouth was hanging open, he looked down at the newspaper and showed it to his sister, her sister's mouth too was open wide as if trying to suck up the information.
He turns his back on them and walks away, eyes are blurry with tears that he can’t hold on to it anymore. Finally, when he was out of the manor and apparate to his house. When he entered, he was whimpering. His mothers portrait of course hears it.
“I did everything I could, it’s not that I was abandoning him,” muffled Draco into his hands, Harry knew that his husband was stressed and tired because Draco slept earlier than usual, he helped where he could, especially with Jamie, trying to replace the void of absent Draco whenever the twins needed Draco.
It was the time of the year where their journey to Diagon Alley begin, to buy some few supplies for school, of course. He don’t understand why they must go when the sun is blazing up on their head that when he touched his altered his original hair to straight blonde hair.
When they arrived in front of the classroom’s door, Draco tried to shook Harry’s hand off but Harry just tightened his grip and pulling him inside and inside they went.
‘ Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,’ said Madam Hooch. ‘Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two-’
He felt movement and in seconds, Harry took his face into the palm of his hand, looked him in the eyes, denying his own accusation about himself. “No, Draco, never. You are the best Mama our children could ever ask for. It’s just - you know how Jamie felt about sharing you. He was even jealous of me, his own father when I showered you with love and affection.”
The door to their private quarter opened and walked in a male healer, coming in to check on Draco, he bent his body down, told Draco to split his legs apart and checked on his private part, then told them that Draco was indeed in the moment of giving birth.
Draco chuckled at Dobby’s antics but hugged him back nonetheless. Draco picked both of them up from the ground and carried Dobby back to his bed, laid him on down.
‘ I-told-you’, gasped Cassie, clutching her stomach while Granger nodded in agreement.
‘You know when I heard you are going to have a duel at midnight, nonetheless while I was accompany Neville at the Gryffindor Tower since he forgot the password and the Fat Lady was not at portrait anyways, as I heard these two dunderhead talking about a duel with you two’, she pointed her fingers to him and Blaise. Crossing her arm and eyed both of them, looking rather annoyed.
He was bored out of his mind. He just can't wait for the party to end. He heard the doorbells ringing and the house elf opened the gate for them. Most families look at the house elf with disdain, as if they were the most disgusted creature ever and he sneered although no one could see his face.
His feet touched the ground safely when a loud screech shouting Potter’s name. The students are all turned towards the voice and it was Professor McGonagall. Draco’s heart sank, if people told her that Draco too had been flying without the teacher's observation, he too would be dead like Potter. He wanted to get on her good grace but now he can’t anymore.
He didn’t expect his babies are going to be two weeks early from the due date and he was not ready.
“Uwh feisty,” although he was concerned, he still loved trying to get a rise out of his girlfriend. That is what makes their relationship work.
“Alright - alright Jamie,” said Draco giving into his son’s demand and place the fruits inside the trolley, they continue on walking around and picked more fruits and vegetables. As they walked, they could hear whispered of ‘is that Harry Potter?’ or ‘Oh Merlin, he’s so hot’ by some girls at the age of twenty.
“Nothing great about you I realised,” she lied and then she realised her mistake because she just sounds out-right cruel.
He brought his hand to his cock and jerked it, dribble of his cum are leaking out of him, he can feel it, his balls are tighten and a few second later, he come on his stomach while Harry was still fucking him harder and harsher.
‘Who send the message’, asked Draco.
“Cassiopeia! Draco! Come now. We don’t want to associate ourselves with these kind” called father for them but none of them move, they were paralyze on the spot because father’s face are red, it means that he was so angry.
Without thinking twice, Draco sprinted to the room with Blaise and Pansy trailing behind. He tried to open the door but it was locked so he scrambled to get his wand out and muttered “Alohomora”, he heard a loud shrinking screamed that made his heart drop.
Right now, both of them are full on laughing at how dramatic Harry is. Jamie crawled to him, giving him a big sloppy kiss, leaving a splotch of saliva and went back to cuddle his mama.
“Well - are you though? Dating her?”
Draco is his and no one else.
It’s probably why he was not on speaking terms with his Father but Mother told him that he will come around one day, it’s been seven years and he still hasn't come around from the Pureblood’s ideal.
With a blink of an eye, they were already at Draco’s when Harry’s motorbike slowly parked at the designated parking spot for bikes. Draco climbed down without a word because he’s already sleepy and it’s probably two in the morning.
“Please move baby.”, begged Draco seconds later when he was comfortable , he tugged Harry’s body closer to him. Harry’s mouth went back to attack his neck as his body move continuously forward and backward.
Draco’s face is red from the intense sex they had moments ago. Harry quickly crawled to him, he was on his knees, massaging the pale soft flesh of Draco’s arse, slipping back his massive cock where it belonged.
Enjoy this fic, not much Drarry moment but it's whatever. sorry again if this fic won't be your cup of tea. But this fic dive deeper into relationship between Lucius and Draco, the family relationship. You would know that Draco sometimes are conflicted about the Malfoys.
Draco came first before Harry, both of their stomachs covered in his cum, Harry followed a few seconds later, coming inside Draco.
Thanks for reading until the end. I read The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and let me tell, it's devastating.
“Almost there, love” answered him softly, the corner of his mouth lifted into a smile.
“No, your daddy had a lot of things to do last night. Let’s give him some time, okay? In the meantime, you want to go for a morning run with your dear mummy?”
Draco wiped his mouth furiously and asked Goldstein if the sauce are still there, Goldstein chuckled softly and brought his hand to his face and wiped the sauce off his face. Before he got to thank him, Slughorn opens the door to the Potion room and ushered them in while The golden trio with an additional of Pansy and Blaise come up to them.
‘No, I don’t like it. Again.’, as she put her phone against the window glass. Draco decides to roll his eyes instead of saying no because he is a pussy. Pansy was scarier that her Aunt Bella when she was mad or when things don’t go her way.
Draco was sick of it not going to lie so when September first came, he fisted his hand up in the air. Happy to get away from the big manor, it is quite lonely there when the people he could communicate with are Mother and Cassie - sometimes if he’s in a good mood, Father.
Harry release their intertwined fingers and told him that he was going to get a drink for the both of them so he decided to find an empty seat.
Harry bit his lips and pulled it slowly, they both groaned and again, their lips were connected. Harry swiped his bottom lips, silently asking his permission to enter his mouth - to taste Draco on him.
“Scorpius looks exactly like you when you were born, Draco,” said mother finally after being silent for a long time, she was probably so shocked that Scorpius looks a lot like Draco it reminds her of the time when she gave birth to him.
‘When I heard that students have to come back to continue their Eighth Year, I said to myself that I will do anything in my power to be your friend and going more from there, to make you mine’, with his strong arm around his waist, Potter lead both of them towards his bed as his mouth continue trailing kisses down on his neck.
He recorded the whole thing on his camera, the humiliation and he recorded Cassie’s face because why not. Before they walked to Hogsmeade to ride the Hogwarts train, he dragged his friends to the front of the castle, took a few group photos as he recorded the whole process of them trying to be ready for the camera.
“Or better, I can just go to Lyra’s account and stalk her following,” he spoke smartly and did just that.
“Sorry, Papa”
“It’s not like once you bought me the broomstick, I would magically be on the team.”, mumbled Draco under his breath. Actually, that was a good idea, if he did terribly for the try-out, Flint wouldn’t even give him a second thought for joining the team.
“Why would I be jealous?”, said Draco aggressively as he walked beside Harry, holding his arms firmly, daring anyone to look at his husband with lust, he swear if one more person look at him with lust, he’s going to burst in the middle of the shop.
Draco was trying to figure out what the problem with this boy was when Cassie’s voice rang through his ears.
“Oh no no Jamie, Mama will never leave you because you know why?”
He was rubbing his eyes, trying to force himself to stay awake when a familiar fingers caressing his hair, pushing his fringe away from his eyes. He doesn’t look away from his book with his boyfriend’s action.
“I want you to scream for me”, whispered Harry into his ear. Harry’s fingers are moving furiously inside of him as he added the third and the fourth finger. His hole wrapped perfectly around his Harry’s fingers.
When the song end, Pansy took the phone into her hand and shakes her head furiously, looking unsatisfied.
Nobody spoke a word once they arrived at their destination. Cassie walked towards the girl dormitories while Blaise and him walked to their room. They slide under their blanket in their respective bed and cover their whole body. There is one word flying through Draco’s mind. Wicked.
Draco never felt this feelings before because Father was not the type of person that shown emotion, he was a cold heartless man so he doesn’t think that he needs a father figure who shown emotion but he do now after what had the mirror show him.
“Oh nothing,” he got back up. “Where are you going?” grabbing his hand, trying to force him back down beside him. He do wanted to, he wanted Harry’s body on top of him because he craved sex but they didn’t have the time to do more thing than kissing.
As they were hiding from Potter and Weasley behind the darkness, the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside, then slouched slowly into the room.
It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
‘Sometimes, you can be really reckless, maybe you should have been in Slytherin’, said Blaise while filling up his plate with food. ‘And if Cassie and Pans hear about this, we are going to be a dead meat feed to the giant squid’.
“Bet you loves that, didn’t you, Potter,” he said looking purely amused and his signature smirk came crawling to his face. “Famous Harry Potter- can’t even go to a bookstore without making the front page.”, he teased him as he lifts the corner of his mouth, half smiling.
“Would you, Draco?”
“Harry, are we there yet?” asked Draco for the thousand times of excitement. He wondered where the place was and what the occasion was for.
What happened to the muggleborn that died last time and how did they die?
Draco Lucius Sirius Black was greeted warmly, he has his mother sterling grey eye on the left side and his father sky-crystal blue eye on the right side. He was loved by the people in the room.
Potter thrust into him slowly at first as he kissed down his neck leaving more hickey. ‘Finally, this tight little hole belong to the rightful owner. Mine!’, said Potter as he kisses him on the mouth soundly, his thrust become frantic when his possessiveness took over.
His breasts were full with milk leaking out, his shirt was stained with it even though the babies plus Jamie drank quite a lot, well maybe he was made for this - to become a soft hearted mummy to the boys, someday he wondered where his past attitude goes - his cold blooded heart went.
“Let me think about. Who knows? Maybe I might be in the bad mood on that day and the only thing that could cheer me up is you guys.”, smiled Draco wickedly. Before he gets to hear Weasley’s dull protest, he walked away from him with his book tucked under his arm.
Before they walked away from the car, Harry took out a picnic basket he placed behind on the passenger seat.
‘Oh hello, sister’, he said when he saw the owner of the hand’s face. He gave her a cheeky grin because he had already been caught by her. He looked around the room and found two unwanted Gryffindors in the room and turned his head towards Potter, ‘This is not in our agreement,’ he sneered as he crossed his arms.
To say that Draco was late for his part-time job (well basically he would call it his quarter time job since he can choose what time he felt like working) is acceptable and understandable since it was her mother’s restaurant he was working at.
Hands rubbing Draco’s waist as he kept on taking his cock up his arse.
What power does she have? She could read his mind fairly quickly. He read something about this type of magic before but where? Whatever, he’ll search it out once he reaches Hogwarts.
“Can you what Draco?, ask me properly, how should I know what you want”
“Are you okay, love?” voicing his concern. Draco just nodded his head, replying to his comment, he took a few breaths and started to lift himself up and down on his cock.
“What are you going to do about it, Potter?”, asked Draco as he raised the corner of his eyebrow, he might looked like a prat right now but he actually was not, he was finding some sort of entertainment taunting the trio.
Draco crossed his arms together as he smirked, looking up and down at Weasley. He then looked at Potter and it seems that he agreed with Weasley.
They have been together for two years now, they’ve been through all high and low together. Harry was always there when Draco needed him, never once he wasn’t there.
“ Uhm, Draco I don’t think it's a good idea, let's just head home, shall we.”
Harry gave him one last kiss on his lips, drinking the honey taste as they walked out of their college.
“Hi.”
‘ PANSY! BLAISE! DO SOMETHING, I’M UNDER PRESSURE RIGHT NOW’, shouted him at them when he saw they stood at the door, wide eyes looking at the hideous troll.
She just wish that she wasn’t as stupid as she was seven years ago just to find comfort in which she thought of him as her mentor, desperate to please others.
Finally, he gave a long breath and looked into his cousin's eyes, “I need you to take care of Draco for me, I know that you will cherish him and I know Lucius will take him because it's his sister's son”.
Right now, Ronald was teasing Harry that they got three children before they got to the age of thirty years old and told Harry that he was the one who was helping him to court Draco and that he should be grateful to have a best friend like him, Harry retorted on his behalf by saying that while it only took him like nine months to confess to Draco, it took him seven years to have the balls to kiss Hermione.
“About Blaise? He could do whatever he wants and whoever he wants but leave my sister out of it, she won’t be getting any kiss until she at least reach the age of fifteen or even better twenty.”, answered Draco honestly.
It was not his fault that he had the brightest idea to poke him in the back of his head to get his attention, trying to get anger rised out of him, bambling on how the Gryffindor picked their teammate and ‘accidentally’ insulting Longbottom who was beside Weasley.
“Jamie, why do you act like this?” asked his father, looking down at his first son, trying to understand him better.
His feet stopped when he was basically in front of the mirror, the image the object provided for him made his heart stop.
“Yes, father.”
When the school reopen, Potter came back looking all tall and broad, he’s not the scrawny kid he met at the robe shop instead he was tall, taller than Draco. His features are rough that makes him look like a man, not that he’s not a man. His hair is just the same, messy and look like a bird nest but that makes girl and some additional boys swoon over him including Draco but Potter didn’t even bat an eye on them.
At this point he even think why has he agreed with his mother to continue his study and he felt annoyed to Professor McGonagall that she made Muggle Studies a mandatory subject, he was annoyed at Professor Chillburg, his Muggle Studies’s professor on giving them a bloody mobile phone but most importantly, he felt annoyed and irritated towards whoever created the damn application in the first place that he could set the Forbidden Forest on fire.
“Regulus James, I can’t just force your sister out yet. She was still comfortable being inside of me,” Draco explained,
He looked at her with disgust and turned his head towards Harry, he then explained to Harry, “They are the Malfoy’s, their family are the followers of You-Know-Who, they were loyal to him.”
The door behind him closed magically once he was inside. Draco looked around, the room was dusty as if no one ever step foot inside the room.
Regulus whined and when Harry released him, he ran to Draco, hiding behind his mummy. Like his father-like son, he rolls his eyes and licks Regulus’s head, grooming him as he lays down on his belly on the ground, carefully not putting pressure on his belly.
Draco’s petite breasts are just in front of his face, milk leaking out of it just for being horny. Without thinking, Harry brought his mouth to his nipple and sucked hard, harder than his babies ever did.
‘Shut up, Peeves- It seems that I was lost that’s it.’
They walled up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. The big giant then raised his big hand and knocked on the castle door.
She wants to hold grudges against Dumbledore for ‘raising her like a pig for slaughter’ exactly as the words Snape’s used in the memory she viewed in the pensieve before she surrendered herself to death.
WHAM - a loud thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay, face down, on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily towards the Forbidden Forest and out of sight.
Who is he kidding? He hates pickles since he can remember, his parents know this knowledge. Even his siblings are giving him a slight knowing smirk while looking at him from the corner of their eyes. He acted like he saw nothing, took out his phone and went into Instagram, attempting to search for Draco’s Instagram account.
Tracing his index finger where his face once stood, before it got burned off. Although he was burned off the tapestry, It still shows the link to whom he got married to and under them is their son.
It didn’t help at all but he was still grateful for it.
“So this is Harry Potter,” he thought to himself.
As he sat down besides Cassie, laid down the new book on the table, Blaise and Theo were snickering while Cassie was looking at Longbottom with a frown and she turned her head to glare at Theo.
Draco suspicion’s towards Quirrell only grew bigger as the day past by. The first ever Quidditch match was held in November, that is when the mystery on Quirrell grew on him, his curiosity had taken over him.
“You shouldn’t joke like that. Neville is already afraid and you make him even more terrified”, said Potter after ten minutes of walking silently beside each other with Fang sniffling the ground.
“Great job, Dobby.”
They paused and looked into each other’s eyes. Most specifically, he was looking into Harry’s emerald green eyes, his eyes can’t seem to tear it apart from it.
He really hopes the hat doesn’t put him in Ravenclaw because he doesn’t want to get a Howler on the first day of school from father.
“You sure about that, Sirius?” his dad added, looking at Sirius amused while sipping his drinks.
He realised that he have to control his emotion for the Christmas break since Father will held an extravaganza Christmas ball, only the pureblood family and a few important people from the Ministry will be invited to the Malfoy Manor. He was not ready for the holiday but when he thought of his Mother and Dobby, he can’t wait to go back to the manor.
He recognised the attacker as his husband, the prankster. He barked at him once Harry helped him sit down, his paw took a swing at Harry’s face, Regulus too, annoyed with his dad’s action, jumped at him and tackled him to the ground.
“I swear Malfoy-”, Weasley chimed in, his face are the same colour as his hair.
Harry came up to him, running his hand through Draco’s hair and whispering their baby’s gender into his ears, he smiled when Harry told him that it was a boy who is a carbon copy of him and Jamie, but the baby’s eyes are still close.
At this point, Peeves was messing around with them but he’s not going to call for Flich until the wanker, Weasley shouted at him.
“Hello there, you have the same shade of colour hair as mine. Quite captivating actually that I’ve never met someone with hair like us before. You are the first person,” said her in her dreamy and soothing voice. He never heard someone speak like this before, it was like her soul was in another world she created in her head but her body was in reality.
The twins, Adrian and Scorpius, when one of them starts crying, the other one will follow by - usually it will always be Scorpius who starts crying in the middle of the night and Adrian usually cries when they are taking their evening nap.
‘Malfoy, Draco,’ she called.
“Hey, after everything I’ve done and this is what I get? You calling me old, it’s insulting, “ he pouted, poking Draco’s cheeks when he laughed at him.
Before Sirius walked out of the hall, he came closer to the sleeping baby and whisper for the last time, “My little dragon, I love you so much, you will always be in my thoughts and I hope you will understand why I did it, I hope when you grew up, you can forgive me for leaving you but I know this is for the best, they will take good care of you,” he kissed Draco for the last time on the forehead and on both of his cheeks.
It took them ten minutes to come back from their sex euphemism. While Harry is still inside of him, switching their position so Harry was laying on the ground, Draco laid on top of him while he was still naked but the spare blanket Harry bought helped them cover their naked parts.
The Malfoy’s are still the pureblood purist the Wizarding World known as, still looking down at their inferior but that doesn't affect Draco's personality at all. He respects all people and the house elves, He is friends with a house elf named Dobby, Dobby and he loves to play together when he was little but when Father found out, he was furious.
He tried to refrain himself but when a 15 years old Draco tried to seduce him, he knew he can’t deny his desire any longer. Draco succeed in seducing him and they had sex in an empty classroom, took Draco’s virginity right there and then. He was not pleased when he knew that Draco's first kiss was not him but no matter.
Finding out about the three-headed dog was hard enough that It  he had to ask Madam Pince, the school librarian. When she handed him a book about Greek mythology, he admitted to himself that he was a moron. Of course the information about the dog are going to be in there, he should have known, the bog was a mythical creature.
“Mother- How - did you know?” asked Draco as he stuttered with his words as he was taking a very deep breath. “Harry sends a Patronus for me to take care of Jamie while you both are going to the hospital.
He was contemplating whether to talk to Jamie this instant so he couldn’t avoid him but he doesn’t want the others to know that he has a problem with Jamie - a misunderstanding. He looked up into the emerald eyes when he felt an arm wrapped around his shoulders, Harry kissing him on the temple.
Draco pats his pocket indicates that his trunk was in his pocket, Mother chuckles. Draco was confused so he asked her.
“Maybe we can hang out when you are free?” To which he replied, “Absolutely, I’ll message you on Instagram since I don’t have your phone number.”
‘Uhm- Peeves- I was just going to the Hospital Wing because- you know- stomach ache’, Draco lied as he clutched his stomach.
Draco looked back down at his son, suddenly two big green eyes were looking at him back, he was shocked because his son got his papa’s emerald green eyes. He called for his husband, “Harry, he got your eyes.”
“You remember when I save you in the fire?”, asked Harry as he took his face in his hand, turning Draco face to look at him. Of course he remembered, it was one of the memories he couldn’t forget. He was forever grateful for Harry being his saving grace.
“Better is not enough, I want you to do great.” snapped father at Cassie. No it won’t happened, it’s unacceptable, father should be proud at them instead but what makes him irate at father is that he raises his voice at Cassie - this can’t do, he have to intervene.
The girl he shared the compartment with was sorted into Ravenclaw and there’s fifteen new first years sorted into Slytherin, each time the hat shouted ‘Slytherin’, he gave the biggest clap he could ever give.
The man without a doubt shook gratefully and after a few seconds passed, he let go of the Healer’s hand turned to his companions and smiled gleefully, “Wanna meet the new member of the Marauders Junior?” said the man as he was walking towards the room.
On the day of 5th June 1980, a boy came from the two powerful pureblooded houses. His skin is as soft and pale but shines like the sake of his season of when he was born. Son to a man named Sirius Black and a woman named Amelia Black née Malfoy who was casted away by his parents by marrying Sirius Black but his brother, Lucius Malfoy was still in contact with her. Godson to a man named Remus Lupin. A boy that later will lose his mother by the hands of a traitor and a father that will cast away to Azkaban. A lovely intelligent boy that will be handed to the House of Malfoy.
He finally understood why she was silent when an object hit his shoulder really hard, pushed him out of the way. He looked over his shoulder to confirm it and it was true, it was father, his eyes locked with Mr Weasley instead.
“Like I give a damn about their opinion, I just care about you and only you and if they really are my fans, they would be happy for me.” convinced Harry while stroking Draco’s white blonde hair.
They were silent for a second until Draco suddenly jumped into Harry’s lap, legs wrapped around his waist, lifting his skirt up a bit that could almost see his knickers but fortunately, no one was around - beside he wouldn’t care anyways if someone saw him like this.
‘ Oops’, he whispered guiltily as the clanging and crashing sound of armour hit the ground.
Harry carefully laid Jamie on his bed, Jamie raised his arms, calling out to him to lay beside him.
“What is his name?” asked Draco after he realized their sons still haven’t had a name, and before Harry could suggest, “Please don’t be Albus nor Severus please, they’re both manipulative and a bastard,” said Draco fiercely, he is not going to let Harry named their sons after the manipulative bastard, not on his watch. When Harry first suggested that they should name one of the twin Albus Severus, Draco had to run to the toilet to puke out the idea because it was too gross.
Although he knows Jamie are tired, he still won’t close his eyes because he’s stubborn when it was time for his nap.
Finally, when Draco can’t take it anymore, he stood up aggressively and said to the ginger head, “Well, I don't have to know your name to know who you are,” he looked up and down at him and then he continued, “Red hair and a hand-me-down robe, you must be a Weasley”, he sneered.
‘Potter, did you know our lovely Draco right her-’, Draco cuts her off by shoving food in her mouth, stood up and addressed to them that he are going to Potion. Without waiting for a reply, he quickly walked away and out of the Great Hall to the empty Potion Classroom since some students are still in the Great Hall.
‘I saw how their eyes went when they saw that you are wearing a lingerie under the skirt, I can’t take my eyes of you, baby but thank god I recorded the whole process of you making tik tok’, Harry pushed him down to the bed on his back. Harry then flipped him over presenting his arse for Harry’s eyes .
Right now they are lovers, a forbidden love between a 35 and 16 year old but once Draco is going to step out of his private quarter, they have to act like a normal student and a professor interaction, like how Harry acts towards his other students.
“How’s my husband and my babies are doing today?”, asked Harry as he set Jamie back on Draco’s lap, and strip out of his auror robe.
Weasley was struggling to break free from Draco’s clutches but then he heard a spell being cast and his body was petrified. His body landed on top of Weasley, if he was not so mad at whoever petrified him, he would think that their position was weird and disgusting but he didn’t give two shit right now, he just want to be released from the spell.
“No, Jamie. Behave or else you won’t get breastfeed tonight.”, scolded Draco as if Jamie understood every word he said but he did pull his hand away.
The next day while they are in DADA classroom, Draco had a difficulty with sitting and walking that he have to do it very slowly or else a shock of pain will hit him, his friends notice this of course but Bryan, one of his friends was the only one who had the courage to ask him while they were standing closely to Harry, practicing their wand movement and trying the new spell Harry taught for his class.
Narcissa took a deep breathe and explained his family tree, “We are actually your relative, Cassie is your cousin, your biological mother was Lucius’s younger sister, Amelia Black née Malfoy, she died by the hand of two Death Eaters trying to get the information on the Potters because your father, Sirius Black was their Secret Keeper.”
, explained Longbottom to the trio. There’s a part of him that was pity at Longbottom for being the target of Slytherins but he can’t do anything about it. It was not his job and anyways, why would he be sorted in Gryffindor if he was not brave.
“You have nothing to be sorry about, my baby. I should have spent more time with you and I’m sorry for making you feel that I don’t love you because I do, very much.”
His stomach made a happy flip when he finally found Draco’s account through Lyra’s account. His profile is a picture of him holding a book in his hand, a purple flower tucked behind his ear while his eyes were fixed on the camera.
Draco’s cheeks flushed as he heard the word that came out of his mouth, he nodded his head frantically. Draco stand on his tippy toe and brushed Harry’s fringe aside, kissing the lightning bolt shaped scar he had on his forehead since he was one.
“I thought we were supposed to look at the stars,” he chuckled but moaned seconds later when Harry continued abusing his hole.
“Lucius,” said Mr Weasley, nodding coldly. Draco was looking over at Cassie for help in any way that she could, he mouthed ‘help me’ and regrets his decision to torment Potter, maybe for once if he listen to Cassie, he won’t be in this situation.
‘It’s none of your business’, said Cassie over her back as she was walking to her room, her back are facing him.
Dobby’s eyes shed a few tears and he suddenly jumped on him and hugged him, but with his quidditch talent, he caught him just in time before both of them tumbling to the ground.
She didn't know when but she didn’t care. All she knows is that she had fallen, completely and hopelessly in love with her, and the worst part is that she's a straight woman and there is nothing she can do with it but wait until these feelings disappear.
This can’t be but his brain won’t work, even the advance spell that he read from the library, that he was fascinated with won’t resurface to his mind until a spell came up.
When they are done, two fifth-year Slytherin perfects instruct the first-year to follow them to their Common Room. They walked down to the dungeon where the Slytherin Common Room was. On the way to the common room, Draco accidentally tripped Blaise and with exchange, Blaise whacked him in the head, Pansy and Cassie was sniggering from behind.
They were connected in both ways, through their mouths and private parts.
‘What about your clothes’, questioned him.
He knows that Pansy was trying to rile him up and humiliate him in front of these people. She gave him the most devilish smile and he wish he could punch her or something but Malfoy don’t punch girls.
‘Shut up, Draco’, she glared into his soul. Cassiopeia could be scary sometimes, like Mother.
So, before the first of April came, he already worked on the object. A bell that had been charmed so that whoever walked under it, their cloak will change it colour. He had the help of a Slytherin 6th year who named was Sarah Himberland, a half-blood to put disillusionment spell on the bell.
“Let’s go! I’m super hungry. There’s this play Ron introduced to me four days ago and I’m sure you will like it,” he babbled as he dragged Draco to the destination.
Harry could feel Draco’s legs trembling with cold so without asking, he took another spare blanket he had prepared and covered Draco’s milky legs.
“I don’t want this to sound absurd but would you like to go on a date with me, Draco?” Harry asked hopefully, it says it in the eyes, his eyes glistening with hope.
Harry shifted his hand, controlling the steering wheel with his right hand while the other hand, slowly moving towards him and grabbed his small pale hand and entwined their hands together, Draco tighten their hand together.
While waiting for his reply, Draco save Harry’s phone number as Harry Potter, for now.
‘Yes? What can I do for you, Professor?’ he asked while looking behind her at Draco and Potter. When his eyes lingered on Potter, eyed him up and down with the look of disgust and full hatred but never once did his eyes remain on Potter’s eyes for too long.
Draco scoffed at his husband’s words and denied the accusation, turning his body facing his husband, he lightly kisses him on the lips as he wound his arms around his husband’s neck, thumb slightly rubbing the back of his neck.
“You never know because you never ask about it, you just know that we went to the same school,” said Draco, talking with his mouth full, hand involuntarily stroking Harry’s messy black hair as he was chewing his food.
“Do you know who I am? I am not someone you do not want - ”
They live happily for a while.
“James Sirius Potter! If you don’t come out right this instant, I am going to send you straight to grandfather Lucius’s house!” hoping that Jamie take the bait and just come out already.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry devoured his hole with his mouth and taste the liquid.
“Okay.”
He smiled in mischief as Cassie was giving him a lecture.
‘Charming Mr Goldstein, hope they share the same sentiment’, said Slughorn. He turned his attention back to the class and address that they are going to brew a love potion. The sounds of loud squealed from the girls rang through the class but Slughorn waves them off saying that the love potion is not a strong love potion because it will last for five minutes in case anyone trying to spike other’s drinks. Besides, no one would have to taste the Amortentia.
They were regretting their decision to have a walk outside of the castle in the cold winter air because not a few minutes later, their body was shivering with cold so they decided to head back inside to enjoy the warm the castle provided.
‘Tik Tok videos’, answered Pansy as she looked up from her phone and show it to Potter. ‘I want to recreate it with Draco but he didn’t want to’, she continues.
Five footsteps echoed through the silent room. The father of the child walked towards them and looked down at the sleeping baby and wife. The baby as he could sense another present in the room opened his tiny eyes.
“Don’t joke about pickle, it’s disgusting - eurgh” , faking his puking.
“Nah, it's no problem. It’s my greatest pleasure. Besides, I get some benefit out of it,” he chuckled while ruffling his messy black hair.
‘How do you know I want it?’, asked Draco as he examining his new book, finding the page about Disillusionment Charm and quickly read it through without absorbing the information.
Cassie hugged him tightly once they reached his room, “Don’t listen to what father says.”, whispered Cassie in his ears. He did not hug her back and push her off of him and told her that he needs some times.
He told the healer to shove his advice up his arsehole but he actually did listen to him although his attitude was like a bitch right now, he was in pain, the healer must understand so that’s why he didn’t say anything about it.
Draco pulled him onto on top of him, his cock breaching Draco’s hole and moves his hips forward until he was seated inside of Draco. He let him adjust to the feeling of his huge thick cock inside of him.
“So Mother can I?”
He waves goodbye to Pansy and kiss Cassie on her temple, he almost got tripped by Milicent Bulstrode’s cat; his fellow Slytherin, he hates that cat since last year and it was mutual since the cat was hissing at him.
“Oh wait I forgot, your cat is your partner, right? Now shut up and just take us where the detention held at, I already learned my lesson, alright. Got my ear pulled by Professor McGonagall and twisted by my sister.”, continued Draco.
“Okay then. Let me call my driver to let him know,” he called his driver to inform him while Harry walked a little bit down the street, where he parked to start his motorbike, followed by Draco closely behind him.
‘But then I also saw the pride in you, the cunningness, the ambition, let me have a moment to think because you are quite a difficult case’, the bloody hat said.
The boy’s voice rang through and Pansy did silly movement and when it was his turn to jump in, he walked into the video awkwardly.
Severus examined him and nodded her head at Professor McGonagall, she then walked back and out of the classroom with Potter leaving him with Severus and he never left alone with him, always Cassie by his side.
Severus was hugging him like a father would do to their son.
The bloody dog had ran away when he saw no sight of him and he don’t even realized it until now.
He was checking the time and it had only been ten minutes passed when he felt a tap on his shoulder, his body freezing. He slowly looked behind his back and was met with brilliant green eyes.
‘Now, now shut up and let me think where should I put you’, the hat told him.
Draco would rode with Dobby whenever he was done with his punishment from Father, he would let Dobby sat at the front so he can maneuvered the broom from behind easily, Dobby loves it until one day they stopped because they were caught by Father, both of them got their punishment harshly and Dobby never asked for broom ride since then.
Before he could ask how Severus found him, Severus pulled him into a sitting position and gave him a potion to drink. He took the potion from Severus’s hand and gulped the potion willingly without any protest.
“Sorry, professor,” apologised Bryan cheekily without meaning it, he was definitely not sorry for teasing Draco about who he was shagging.
He waited outside since Slughorn haven’t open the door for them yet. While he stood there for ten minutes with a few students waiting and staring into nothing while the students chatted with their friends, he felt a human present besides him.
Pansy knew him too well and she loves to gossip but not about him while Blaise is the type of person who is quiet and loves to observe his surroundings and people.
As they inhaled and exhaled the smoke, a silent night stood between them. None of them decided to talk but for some reason, she didn’t care. She likes it.
‘Now take the rose thorns but be very caref-,’ his sentence was cut off by Potter’s screeched. Potter accidentally cut his finger and now his finger are bleeding. Draco rolled his eyes since Potter never took precaution. He went over to him and took his finger in his hand, examined it.
“I don’t know Iris, I’m just so scared about the future. I don’t know what to do. What if we break up? What if our relationship is not working? What if - ”
Professor McGonagall was explaining to the first year about the houses in Hogwarts, all the first year listened attentively except for Draco because he was halfway done with reading
“I am looking at the star, you are the star, love. My eyes could never look at anywhere but you.” he tilted his head and gave Draco a deep meaningful kiss.
“Remember to write to us, and tell us you got sorted into,” she bent down to kiss his head and hugged him and she turned around doing the same to Cassie.
“I can’t even leave you two on your own for a second, can I?”, complained father as he was motioning his head to follow him to the counter.
“You don’t have to flatten me to get into my pants, you know, in case you forgot, we are already married.”, chuckled Draco with his eyes rolling to the back of his head. The fingers inside him jabbed his prostate that make him moaned louder but he quickly clamped his mouth.
‘Hello Draco, why are calling me in this find lovely morning’, said Blaise over the phone.
Harry nodded his head agreeing to his statement, “I am not going to, besides the name doesn’t suit him, do you have any suggestion, dragon? '' asked Harry.
When they opened the door to the Great Hall, their noses were filled with the smell of food, he looked around for Cassie but he still couldn't find her, probably still with Longbottom. So, he decides to find someone else, which is Potter and friend.
“How many times do I have to tell you Draco dear, it’s Molly,” scolded her lightly at using formality. Draco blushed and nodded his head in acknowledgement. Shifted Addie in his arms, his legs walked him over to his third baby, Scorpius or he called him - Cory.
The sound of their moaning combined are extravagant, he could never get tired of these feeling, the feeling of being in love with Harry, the feeling of Harry inside of him.
“Stop kissy mama,” said Jamie, annoyingly looking at his parents with big grey eyes he inherited from him.
Draco turned out and looked at Potter, he had caught the ball from falling to the ground and now he was flying down to the ground. He saw that Potter was looking at him with a face of what people called when someone felt bad about something.
The flashing light of the camera make them pulled themselves away but slowly from each other, well they are going to be in the paper again but at least they got him on his good side.
Although he hated the idea, he nodded his head with his pursed lips, eyebrows scrunched in an angry frown.
“Draco, I was shocked when I looked at your results but you did good in all subjects except one, which is Defence Against the Dark Arts, I should have send you to Durmstrang instead of Hogwarts. Learning Dark Arts is better than Defence Against the Dark Arts.”, said father somewhere proud in him but he quickly masks it.
He finally pulled away, “Let’s go eat, okay?” Eyes never leave his, waiting for Draco’s confirmation. Draco nodded his head lightly, grabbing Harry’s free hand for a squeeze and he didn’t pull back.
“The firs’-years, Professor McGonagall,” said the big giant.
‘Besides, a lot of people wants me to do videos with you again’, she paused and looked at someone, Draco followed her eyes movement and saw that she stops her eyes at Anthony Goldstein.
“Selling?”, the old man’s voice turned displease since he won’t get any money from father today but instead, he was the one who have to give money to father.
He saw the cloaked figure reached the unicorn, it lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its blood.
“Miss Potter - let me speak,” and Iris was so against it, she stood her ground because she didn't want her girlfriend to be sad.
He picked his usual products because it works well on him, but he kind of wanted to try a new one too, maybe a new scented shampoo for his and Harry’s hair. The only reason why he run out of his hair product quicker than usual is that Harry would use his on his stupid messy thick hair and he uses a big amount to tame it but failed miserably.
‘SLYTHERIN’, the hat shouted after a long minute.
Their cock are brushing against each other, Harry sank one finger inside his tight hole, feeling the cold lube he wasn’t aware of, Draco’s hand brushed through Harry’s messy black hair, curling his fingers tightly and moaned his husband’s name, burying his face on Harry’s soft but messy curly hair.
In his room, he was contemplating on not doing it because the mini skirts is really mini that shows his thigh and the cropped top shows his belly but in the end, he decided to just face the music, another idiom he learned from Muggle Studies.
He let him adjust as he waited for him, his hands spreading on Harry’s chest while he held on to Draco’s lean waist. His knees were supporting himself against the green ground as Harry’s cock in him.
“Yes, I want you to meet my girlfriend, Iris Potter. The same person who is killed the Dark Lord and yes the same woman who has been my nemesis since first year and who is also the same person I talk about since first year through sixth year and she is also the - ”
Cassie, who appeared was joining them in listening to their conversation without them realising, crossed her arms and glared at Theo, abandoning her food.
The ball was held on Christmas Eve, he visited his mom’s grave in the early morning on Christmas Eve where he knows no one was awake yet at the time. He did have to bribe Dobby to Apparate him there, to wish his deceased mother an Early Merry Christmas, just him and her alone at the cemetery.
Hearing those words coming from Harry’s mouth made his mind goes fuzzy.
“Go away! Don’t come near me ever again. I hate you and I don’t want to see your ugly face!” she screamed while trying to find her tampon and when she realised she was out of tampons, it was making her more frustrated.
Draco was rushing since he never been late to class before so he told Harry to walk faster but Harry ignored his demand and took his hand in him and interlaced their fingers together, telling him to relax.
“It’s not my fault,” he retorted. “The teacher all have their favourite, that Hermione Granger-”
He sighed and shook his head, getting rid of the thoughts in his head.
Everybody in the family knows not to take Sirius’s words seriously because there’s never been a day where he was serious despite his name sounding like the word ‘serious’.
The car stopped thirty minutes later, Harry parked his car in an empty space under a tree, they both stepped out of the car.
He then ordered Dobby to leave him for thirty minutes alone for him to spent his time with Amelia, he tell her about everything he did at Hogwarts, about Potter and about the mirror, as he speaks to her, tears fall down to his cheeks before he get to wipe them out.
When Draco was done feeding Harry, he vanished the empty plate to the sink, now with his unoccupied hands, his hand went behind him and fondling Harry’s ball sack.
He thinks he did brilliantly in his end-of-year exam, he can answer most of the question which he gave himself a pat on the shoulder.
He don’t know why he couldn’t. He felt there’s something wrong with him. He nodded his head indicating that he understood what Dobby meant.
A hand grabbed his, intertwined their fingers together and hot breath whispered into his ears, “What are you thinking about?”, asked Harry curiously.
Denial.
As Harry played with his nipples, Draco unbutton Harry’s shirt, pushing the shirt off of him, displaying his olive toned skin.
‘Draco! Stop! Walking! Like! A! Bloody! Stick!’, she screamed. ‘ Walked the way you usually walk’, as she walks back to put the phone back against the window glass.
‘Not at all, Professor’, he said as he took a sniffed of the potion. ‘I smelled vanilla and..’, as he took another sniffed. ‘green apples and chocolates.’ Draco was looking at him as they locked their eyes together. Beside him, Potter made a loud huffed as his eyes looked at him, then to Goldstein and back to him.
‘Well, I was dragged into this’, said Blaise as he raised both of his hands in surrender. That traitor, he thought to himself.
Draco stood there, stoned cold when he heard Mr Weasley spoke about his biological mother like that, he felt angry and sad but most important he felt betrayed by father because he wouldn’t tell him who was the murderers who killed his sister, even if he didn’t know, he was the one who supposed to explain to him everything about her, not Mother since she was his sister.
The healer told Harry that Draco should be allowed to leave the hospital the next day when Draco was in his post exhaustion after giving birth.
‘Okay, remember, Midnight’, he said as he walked away with Blaise. They walked to the Slytherin table and sat down with Blaise besides him.
Draco wanted to storm to Dumbledore and knock some sense into him but he reminds himself that he was a student but he did bang the table loudly- an act of protest.
One thing Hermione is right about is that Celestial does enjoy being with women but she was totally wrong about her and Celestial’s relationship.
Jamie’s little hand lifts the hem of his shirt, silently asking to be breastfeed. Draco comply and lifts his shirt pass his perky breasts, leaving the view for Jamie and Harry to see.
He groped his boob hard enough that milk coming out of it, streaming down his body.Harry was watching it with fascination shown on his face.
“What - What do you mean I’m confused?” asked Draco confidently.
He begged Harry to fuck him as Harry’s fingers works inside of him.
When he looked over at Potter and Weasley, their fist was already held tightly, waiting to attack and Draco was ready too.
The burn when Harry’s cock slide in him makes him howled, his huge long cock hits his prostate the first thrust. Harry was moaning as his cock hits Draco’s prostate repeatedly.
They were speaking softly to their twins when suddenly, they heard a soft knocked on the door, Harry stand up and give Scorpius to Draco and went for the door, there walked in an elegant women he looked up to since he was a child, she was holding Jamie’s hand as they walked inside the chilly room together.
“This is why one of my middle names is Sirius right? Because I’m actually his son, Sirius Black isn’t it?” said Draco as he was hoping that everything that came out of his mouth was a false accusation.
“What makes father punishment worst than usual?”, asked Draco at his elf friend. Dobby was looking down and playing with the hem of his filthy shirt. After a long minute of silent, Dobby finally speak up.
‘I didn’t speak to her for so long that I regretted it, she invited me to their wedding but with me still wrapping my mind about the situation that she was going to marry my arch-enemy I didn’t go but when I finally realised my mistakes and trying to mend my friendship with her, it was too late.’
“I didn’t think you knew anything about Astronomy,” looking at his husband, impressed shown on his face, his Harry rolls his eyes at him and Draco went back to look at his son.
When he decided to open his eyes back, Harry was already laying him on the hospital’s bed in a private quarter. Harry was hovering beside him, helping him change into the hospital gown. When he was done, he tightly held his hand, Draco turned head to the side to look at Harry, “I’m scared Harry,” he confessed as he spoke quietly as possible but softly, tears leaking out of his eyes .
For a week, no red robes are on sight, only blue, green and yellow. They have to endure this type of torture for a week and the best part is, there was no points given to the Gryffindor for a week since the points will be given to the house colour they wore.
Sneaking out at midnight was hard, he was rapidly curious with everything that the castle hidden. He believed the castle hidden hundreds of possessions from years ago that even professors doesn’t even know about but he isn’t quite sure with Dumbledore though.
‘You want it? Come and get it, Potter.’ he zoomed through the air with Potter trailing behind him. He then held the ball tightly and threw it in the air, far far away from them. Potter fly passed him that made him almost fall from the broomstick. He decided to fly down when Potter was off to catch the ball.
“What would your parents think when they find out that their only child is a slut for a 35 years old man who is also their son’s professor, huh?” said Harry in his rough voice. “That get to fuck their son everyday, the one who took their son’s virginity, what would they think?” Said Harry as he snapped his hips further into Draco. The air of sex flowing around of his personal quarter.
“Sit.”, demanded Father once they have close the door behind them and walking to the couch.
Draco moaned into the kiss, his hand rested on his husband’s chest indicating that they should stop before it gets too intense. Harry got the memo and broke the kiss although he don’t want to, Draco then helped Harry taking his auror robe off of him and hang it on the coat stands. Draco took his hand and lead him to the kitchen.
“So, you have something to say to us,” it was not a question, it’s a statement. Celestial was too nervous; she was tapping her fingers onto her thigh, and when Iris saw this, she took a hold of her other hand too.
His arms tightly wrapped around Harry’s built body, head buried into his bulky chest, murmuring his gratefulness repeatedly.
Draco realised it was Filch but he couldn't contain his laughter so he had to sniff his laugh. ‘He called his bloody cat my sweet’, as he held up his hand to his mouth, hoping the sound of his laughter won’t be too loud. ‘The cat was anything but sweet, that’s a demonic red eyed cat’, he muffled his laugh.
When he finally stepped foot inside his dorm, the atmosphere around the room was quiet since most of them had gone to bed. He stripped out of his school robes as he pulled his camera out of his pocket. He realized that his camera was still rolling, he forgot to press the stop button, he must have recorded the whole conversation between the centaur that he didn’t pay attention at.
“But Sirius was in Gryffindor so there is probably a 50% chance that I will end up in Gryffindor,” he reasoned his father.
‘First, you have to drop one ashwinder egg into the cauldron’, said Draco while reading the instruction on how to make the love potion. When he saw no movement out of the corner of his eyes. He put the book down and glared at him. Potter scratched his neck in confusion.
When Draco’s leg hit the bed, Potter pushed him down carefully with him followed by. With Potter lay on top of him, he lay down tiny kisses all over his face. Draco wrapped both arms around Potter’s neck.
“You really don’t have to,” Draco speaks admiringly, surprised enough he could hide it. His heart does a leap, he feels warm in his chest knowing there’s someone like Harry who is protective over someone like him.
He was lost in the image that the mirror shown him. Maybe a part of him was longing for a happy family or maybe some part of him was longing for them.
Carefully, with Draco sitting on his lap, Harry bend his body forward to grab the plate on the table and the remote control on the table. He brought the plate and handed it to Draco while his other hand pressed the button on the remote, turning the telly on and putting it back down.
“What’s your name ?” asked Cassie since she hadn't got the answer she asked when they were at the robe shop.
Dobby has go against his master.
“Now, Mother, can we go home and because my skin is getting redder,” murmured Draco to her mother so that only she could hear him complain.
Inhaling the toxic substance. Her eyes are looking out to the dark sky, her hand is laid behind her on the floor, using her arm to support her body.
“Sleep first baby, later Daddy will give you more of his cock.” assure Harry, Draco’s eyes slowly dropping down.
It has been four weeks since the start of the school year, lessons have been interesting especially Transfiguration, Astronomy, Potion and Charms. His least favourite subject is Defence Against The Dark Arts, Professors Quirrell stutters makes him want to jump off the Astronomy Tower but he can’t because he is just a first year.
With teary eyes, Harry kissed down his son’s small head and greeted him to the world, “Hello Adrian Castor Potter, I’m your papa.”
“Do not speak about that. She’s annoyed me so much when she teased me about her height. I mean that’s not fair- she can’t compare because she was born nine months before me. Besides, I would surely will grow taller than her and when I did, I will drive her so mad”, said Draco as he bend down, searching for another one of the stupid book.
They both snickered when he saw Harry is trying to numb the pain by acting that it doesn’t hurt him at all.
Enough with his internal monologue and let’s get back to him being late.
Draco was having a doubt, he wanted to but he thinks that it was too soon. He wants to enjoy his first year with peace and no stress and he knows that playing in a Quidditch team has to come with a lot of stress. He loves playing Quidditch for fun but it was always with Cassie so it doesn’t feel right if he is going to play without her.
“But Mother, please I will not let the Kneazle roam around the manor, I will just keep it inside my room,” Draco hopes for his begging work.
I swear Lucius is good father? I think.. it just the death of his sister just shook his world because he loves his sister just how much Draco loves Cassie, siblings love are forever. He blamed Sirius for the death of Amelia so that's why he's kind of harsh on Draco.
Draco had to put his hand on Harry’s chest to pull them off from the heated kiss before they went wild. Draco slipped his pristine hand in Harry’s, he brought his hand up to his mouth and kiss the back of Draco’s hand.
Without him thinking twice, he declared that he wanted Fang the dog as he looked at Fang’s long teeth, he doesn’t even know if the dog is a coward or not but best hope with a long teeth like that, the dog would do something when in danger.
Sirius was grieving because it was his idea to change the Secret Keeper to Peter Pettigrew so he made up his mind to go after him but before that, he had to meet Narcissa at The Malfoy Manor.
finding his son in a weak moment and instantly pin him to the ground. He nipped at his son’s neck, demanding for him to admit his defeat.
‘I DON’T BELIEVE YOU- I’M GOING TO CALL FOR FILCH SO YOU HAVE FEW SECONDS TO RUN- BYE’, waved Peeves as he floated away to find Filch.
‘Of course I didn’t want to, you want us to switch clothes, you wearing man clothes and I would have to wear woman’s clothes’, he said when he turns his attention back to them.
“It seems that you are hundred and one percent fucking wrong because his husband IS the boy who lived - twice I might add,” looking at him up and down, eyes intimidating, daring the stranger to challenge him. “And before your children might come from a sperm donor, better get the fuck out of my sight,” challenge Harry.
“You can do it, Draco!” encourage Harry - easy for him to say, it was not him who was the one taking up the arse, he should have just chomp his stupid huge cock while he still could.
He smiles as sleep takes over him, dreaming about Harry. A very erotic and sweet dream about Harry. Mostly erotic scene than sweet he creates in his land of dreams.
There were a lot crowds of people down below and he don’t want to be push aside by those fangirls. He was thinking of a alternative that maybe they should went back tomorrow where there’s would only be a few people in the crowd.
She couldn’t sleep. With the way she’s tossing and turning in her bed, feelings hopeless and millions of thoughts running through her head. She’s been going back to Hogwarts after the war to further her studies.
‘Do you see Cassie after the Longbottom incident?’ whispered Draco into his ear, Blaise shook his head no. They kept on walking until they came to a stop in front of the trophy room. Draco pushed the door lightly, the creaking sounds of the door’s making it stop whatever was happening inside the room.
Draco never felt like this before with anyone else, it feels like Potter took his soul away, it feels like he was reborn for the second time. As Potter kissed him, he brought his hand to Potter’s hair, caressing his hair.
“You know what Weasley, I think I’m going to borrow your book, this book”, said Draco as he hold the book up for Weasley’s eyes to see.
Maybe it was time for him to become the bigger person in the situation so he let out a long breath.
Jamie crawled up to Draco’s lap, hands hesitantly moving to touch his newborn brothers, fingers lightly touching Adrian’s soft cheeks, “Hi baby!” welcoming his brother, he kissed his red cheeks and looked over to Scorpius, “Hello baby two!” and did the same to Scorpius.
Before this Jamie was crying soundlessly, trying to not make any noise but right now, it was a full blown tantrum of anger, he was trying to let out his displeasement. He was punching him so he could get away from Draco, lightly since he was still a toddler and not much energy and strength he possessed.
The harder he hits Draco’s sweet spot, his moaning becomes sweeter and feminine-like.
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!”, said an annoying voice he would love if her mouth just seal shut. He looked down at her and said, “Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” taunted Draco at the girl. She must be a Weasley since she got a red hair. The girl went scarlet as his brother and Granger fought their way over, both of them are clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.
He was greeted by a sight of Longbottom’s legs stuck together as he walked inside the Great Hall, he recognized the spell as the Leg-Lock Jinx. What a fool, he thought to himself as his legs march over to the Slytherin table.
“But.. Mummy, I’m bored,” Regulus whined. “Well, all you have to do is be patient with it.” Suddenly, Harry snores as loudly as he can while his body is twisting and turning around, trying to find a comfortable position, hogging the bed while he’s at it. His legs are tangled with the blanket, mouth agape, his fluffy black hair is messier than usual.
Wallowing in self-pity and questioning her existence as a woman. She doesn’t even want a baby anytime soon or ever so why give her a uterus then?
‘Yeah right, remember on the train? When I introducing myself, What did you say about my last name, Weasley? Turns out you are just jealous that my family had a huge fortune that your family don’t’.
Blaise brings his hand to his face and rubs it rapidly hoping his sleepiness will go away. ‘ Why do I agree with this nonsense, Draco’, said Draco. ‘Sometimes, I wish I could knock some sense into you’, he continued as he rubbed his face continuously.
‘Give it here,’ he called, ‘or I’ll knock you off that broom!’
When the month of February came quicker than he realised, he felt giddy because he had plan a trick  on Potter on Valentine’s Day. He send an anonymous letter to Professor Flitwick, stated that in the letter he should be reading it out loud when Gryffindor had Potion with Slytherin.
The ‘ding’ of sound of the lift chimed in while they were laughing about something and the door of the lift opened, Harry pulled him in.
Draco got lost in his thought when he heard the door opened, his friends must be back so he tucked the letters back in the book. He was going to give it back to Weasley but not until Saturday.
Before he walked out of the door, - yes he said walk because Malfoy does not run nor scramble, he clasped on a bra and he realised that Harry already changed their babies into a suitable night clothes - onesie while they were still asleep like a log.
‘I don’t care and anyways Parkinson always get what they want’, argued Pansy.
Draco watched the interaction between them with butterflies in his stomach, Harry was such a loving father that he was grateful for him coming into his life. Draco then asked him about their third son’s name and Harry decided to have his first name based on constellation instead of his second name because he looks like a Black.
With him, over six month heavily pregnant with two Potter’s spawn ; yes, two! He was heavily pregnant with twins this time and he was going to have such a hard time if his twin sons are going to behave like his big brother, Jamie in the future.
They reach their forest territory, before they start on their morning run, Draco warns Reggie to not run far off the Potter’s territory. He always reminds his son so that bad things don’t happen to his pride and joy.
Fingers tracing and twirling his hairy chest hair while his mind thinks about what's going to happen when the paparazzi get the hold of the news about their engagement.
Longbottom interpreted it wrong, Draco was just giving an advice. Maybe the tone he used on him while he said it makes Longbottom thinks that he was unworthy to be in Gryffindor.
With a heavy hand, she twisted the knob slowly and walked inside elegantly, composing her posture on the way, Draco was walking closely behind her, making him almost stepped on her foot into tripping both of them to the ground but luckily no such thing happen.
Harry was trying very hard not to laugh at his girlfriend’s antics, she was so dramatic and cute at the same time but she saw right through him.
Harry bent his body forward, his chest falling against Draco’s back. His arms wrapped around Draco’s lithe body, covering his body with his own immense one, hands slithering it slowly to Draco’s boobs, groping it from behind. One hand fondled his boob while his other hands twirling and tweaking his other nipple, he held himself up by his elbows.
“Cassiopeia Malfoy, your marks are acceptable, especially on Astronomy, Charms, Transfiguration and Potion but you did unbelievably terrible at the other subjects, although you did not failed, you only got A’s on the subjects. I want you to study hard this year and achieves all O’s. Understand?”, asked father as he looked at Cassie’s results disapprovingly, shaking his head and breathe out a heavy sighs.
Celestial isn’t embarrassed to be seen with the woman, just was scared of her parents reaction, especially Narcissa Malfoy. She used to care about what her father thinks of her but now, the only person she wants to accept who she is is her mother.
Harry says she likes it and well, being a good girlfriend that she is, she kept it for him.
Draco walked towards them and sat at his father's left hand side, he then greeted his family members.
They gave their last waves of goodbye with Harry still touching the spot where his lips made a connection and finally the lift door closes.
Looking at him, he has decided to talk to him right now, “Can you call Jamie for me, he doesn’t even look my way whenever I called for him,” begged Draco to help him. Jamie was having a problem with him but not his father. Save to say that he was quite jealous and wanted to be in Harry’s position.
‘What are you guys talking about?’,he asked while filling his plate with food. Draco was looking around for Blaise because he still haven’t come down for breakfast and he would always come down with Potter and Weasley but Weasley was absent too.
He turned it on and saw a random number.
He then turned his head back towards her sister. She was holding her hand tightly and her eyes were closed, the hall was silent.
“I told him I was sorry. It was a joke at the moment”, said Draco, exhaling a long breath not looking at Potter, putting his attention towards the path they were walking instead. Potter did not speak for a while so they went back to silence of their surrounding.
Draco nodded again and Father walked off to Cassie to give her advice, maybe the same one. When he thought of it, he rolled his eyes because he knew that Cassie would listen to Father since Father doted on her more.
“Harry - stop I can’t think straight.” Begged Draco effortlessly. Harry decided to be nice and started to finger his hole with his saliva.
The soft giggle pull him out of his thought, yeah- he forgot. He have to find his demon of a son.
“You look like a cute angry white kitten. I love you,” pinching his pale cheeks and taking the food out from the picnic basket.
Draco tilted his head to the side, tapping his finger to his chin, giving it a thought before he decided to mess with him some more.
“You teaser”, moaned Draco as another whack hits his arse cheeks.
When all of them are sitting down, Pansy announced that they were going to play Truth or Dare. Before they started, Draco spoke up, ‘You know what, I’m getting tired now’, as he fake his yawned and ready to stand up.
‘ RELASHIO’, shouted Draco. The bat from the troll’s hand fall to the ground near the girls and now he thinks, what should he do.
‘ Did the barmy professor said that the troll was in the dungeons?’, Both Draco and Blaise nodded his head. ‘Our common room was in the dungeons, dimwits!’, said Pansy with a horror look on his face. Blaise was clearly couldn’t care less.
The mirror shown Sirius was sitting on a stool, his fingers was dancing on the piano keys, behind him, Amelia and him was dancing to the music that was playing. Draco saw that his mirror-self was walking to his father and tapped his finger lightly on his shoulder.
Harry held his hand to his chest, dramatically fell down to the bed, “Oh my, no one loves me. I deserve some love too.”
Sirius was throwing little Draco up in the air when Remus bared the information about his wife. When Remus spoke about those four words, His mind was blank. There is nothing that could come out of his mouth, for the first time in years, he was speechless.
The statement made the boy laugh and Cassie continued, “So, what’s your name?”
“Follow me”, said Filch haughtily, ushering them out of the hall as him lightning the lamp. “I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule, won’t you, eh?”he continued, leering at them.
Draco walked passed them and to his shared dorm, Blaise and Theo are probably not in the room, maybe somewhere in the library with Cassie and Pansy so their shared dorm must be empty.
“Am I a bad parent?” a hint of insecure could be detected in his voice.
‘I’m warning you, Malfoy -one more word-’, he was cut off when Granger pointed out to Potter, he was gone into a dive, a spectacular dive might Draco add. He himself was surprised at Potter’s talent, not that he was going to admit to anyone.
He stood up from his sitting position, walked to Dobby and took his injured hand that had been bandage. Before they apparate away, Draco said to Dobby, “You are my friend, Dobby. Not your master, I treated you as my equal. I want you to tell me everything that’s bothers you out, even if it have to do with father.”
Draco would talk to Dobby in secret, or when Father was not around since the last time he found out about it, Dobby was being punished heavily that made him felt like an awful person and he don’t want Dobby to be punished because of him.
He took Cory from Hermione and brought them to their nursery room upstairs close to his and Harry’s room. They usually sleep in a twin size crib that could fit both of them in, it was in Draco’s room because he wanted to monitor them at night, not wanting to leave them alone at least until they are big enough.
He literally can’t stop. He craved Draco so much that they have sex literally everyday. Draco sneaked out of his common room and went to his private quarter and slept with him most of the time that he could. He wrecked and wrecked Draco’s hole everyday, ruining it for everyone. To let Draco know that no one else knows him well like he does.
‘You look beautiful baby, can’t believe that you are mine’, as he was squeezing his arse through the jeans. Harry love his arse so much that he touch it all the time.
They set the books on the counter, and Draco’s arms are numb so he shook it, Cassie pay for the books while he talked to his friends.
“We actually not your real parents and Cassie is actually your cousin and not your sister,”he was so shocked of the word that came out of her mouth that he looks at Cassie for confirmation that he clearly heard it wrong, Cassie nodded her head
“If you keep looking me like that, I might not control myself when I pound into you on the bed tonight,” said Harry, smirking at him while his eyes are still on the road. “You can pound me as hard as you want, love,” bending his body forward and gave his husband a chaste kiss on his cheek. Harry brings their entwined hands together to his mouth and kiss the back of Draco’s hand.
“But I looked good in this.”
He came across Longbottom’s compartment along the way and what a better way to start off a good school year than teasing the hell out of Longbottom. He slid the compartment door open, smirking his way in. Inside, he was accompanied with his Gryffindor’s companion, something Thomas and something Finnigan.
Harry trailed kisses down his neck as one finger turned into two, working inside of Draco. Sucking on his neck hard, leaving hickey.
“Yes, only me and no one else will get my baby because he’s daddy’s baby. Get it,” asked Harry, Draco nodded his head.
he smirked knowing the meaning behind those sentences, at the same time he is trying to win a fight against his young son.
The atmosphere in the room was silence, there is no sound except their quiet breathing until Severus opened his mouth to ask him a question.
“Goodnight, my dragon.” whispered Harry by the nape of Draco’s neck.
“The one that scared of Draco Malfoy wouldn’t want to kiss her”, said Draco while he was thinking about the faceless stranger that are going to kiss his sister one day, he shakes his head at the thought of it.
She loves those moments because they both are kinky bastards and proud of it. The way her back arched as he pounded her from the back, both of his hands were occupied with choking and pulling her to him.
‘You are telling me that you denied the offer because you are not ready?!’ Pansy shrieked.
When they arrived at King Cross Station, he took one last look at Potter, he also heard someone screaming Potter’s name like a lovesick fangirl, when he looked over, it was a red head girl. He sneered at it without anyone noticing and walked away to his waiting parents with him dragging his trunk, Cassie was walking beside him looking at their parents serenely.
He rummaged his schoolbag without asking for his permission, he searched through his books and got curious when his hand felt a letter sticking out in one of the book so he took the book out and turned his back on Weasley.
He was blessed because he doesn’t want to have a conversation with anyone right now.
As always. I am sorry for the late update.
He went in for the hug but this time, Severus was stilled as a stone, he brought his hand to pat his head, Draco quickly released him from the hug.
“What’s the point of being an Auror when I can’t even carry my own son? Of course I can, Draco. Have you look at this body?”, asked Harry cheekily. Before Draco could answer, he already answer for himself.
“Hey, this sappy git got himself a beautiful husband and he’s going to have two more children on the way.”, Harry bite back as they walked them to the dinning room, with one hand wrapped possessively around Draco’s waist, rubbing his round pregnant stomach while his other arm hold Jamie protectively.
“I left my wallet and came here to get it back,” he answered with honesty.
“No I’m not and I won’t be dating her when I can date someone I fancy at the moment. The girl was just trying to experiment with her sexuality like I did years ago with Pansy,” she says and puts a stop on her overthinking mind.
“And what would happen to Draco, what would he think when he found that his father was in Azkaban? What am I supposed to answer, should I lie or answer truthfully? Sirius, you have to think about him, he already lost his mother, you don’t want him to lose his father too,” Narcissa tried to reason him, buy him some time to think it through, but his mind is already made up.
Draco was packing his trunk, the trunk was full of 1st year mandatory books and some extra books that Severus gave to him about Potions, and he bought Spell books which are not in the list. He too packed a lot of clothes.
When Jamie lifted his head up, there were already prickles of tears at the corner of his eyes. Draco brings his hand to stroke his son’s soft black hair, although he still wouldn’t make himself sit in Draco's lap, he let him thread his fingers through his hair.
Fucking him multiple times on that same spot. His hand came down to Draco’s cock, jerking it when he felt his own waves of pleasure are coming.
The responsibility of the pack has been on his shoulders since he can remember when his parents were killed by Draco’s former pack. They met when Draco accidentally crossed their territory, running away from Riddle's pack when he was only sixteen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus sat down next to him with Draco in his arm. “I understood Padfoot, they will understand too”. His words make Sirius a little bit better.
Draco waited for him patiently perfecting whatever he was doing, he realised that they were alone and there is no one else beside them which is a good thing.
Draco turned his head sideways, asking for a kiss, pursing his lips, Harry obliged and deeply kissed him, showing his love toward the 16 years old by the kiss.
The look on Potter’s face was hilarious, the whole class was roaring with laughter at how ridiculous the letter was.
He held tight onto both Blaise and Pansy arms, ‘Have you seen Cassie?’, asked Draco to both of his friends. Nervousness sneaked into his veins and down to his spine.
‘You know what? You want it so bad right? Come and take it,’ said Draco while leapt on the broomstick he had been holding and taken off, Draco soared up in the air. Draco saw Potter too mounted his broom and kicked hard against the ground and rose up. The screams and gasps of girls could be heard below him.
‘So, Draco I found a new Tik Tok trend that I want to create but with you’, she said with a tone Draco knew too well when she wants something from someone. She showed one of the video of the trend to him and Draco’s mind immediately went no.
“I think it was perfect, dragon.”
Deep in her thoughts, her legs involuntarily bring her to the Astronomy Tower. As she climbed up the stairs, there’s someone already there.
“Is it the Ravenclaw guy from yesterday?,” asked Bryan again as he wiggled his eyebrows and smirking his way up to his eyes. His friends are cackling at the assumption.
“I think this Gilderoy Lockhart is a fraud and a narcissistic. How could someone so obsessed with themselves that with have to buy every single book with his face planted on the cover of the books”, says Draco as they were walking inside the bookstore.
“Hey, if I didn’t do that, we wouldn’t be here”, said Harry as he thrust up into his arsehole, punishing him for his clever comment. Draco moaned into Harry’s hairy chest, tightening their intertwined hands.
“She’s a lady, a lady shouldn’t play a gentlemen’s game, it’s improper. I let Cassiopeia learned how to play quidditch, that does not mean I will let her join the team. You will join the Slytherin quidditch team this year, end of discussion.”
It could be simple if he just clicks the follow button waiting for the request to follow him but he doesn’t want to be seen as a creep. What was he thinking, he already is a creeper by stalking his account fixedly.
What’s the point of being one of the most famous restaurants when you couldn’t even afford a lot of waiters? Actually she can but there’s more customers today than before. Let’s just hope that his mother didn’t hear his internal monologue.
Harry came moments after he had come, his cum shooting inside of him as he pressed his cock to Draco’s prostate.
“How’s your ribs? You know, from getting kneed by me and the bruised jaws?”, asked Draco, trying to get some rise out of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
, said Weasley as he avert his eyes to Theo and back to Neville.
He snapped a photo of him and posted it on his Instagram page, showing off his fiancé wearing the ring he proposed to - to his millions of followers.
“Jamie doesn’t seem that he wanted to talk to me for the past two weeks, I just don’t know what to do anymore,” he groaned, slumped his head down and buried his head into his palms.
When Blaise realized it was Draco, he wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders and pointed at the Gryffindors table with his other hand.
Draco too wondered why he doesn't inherit his parents' straight hair when he has a soft wavy blonde and his eyes are soft grey and blue eyes and not like his father’s cold grey.
‘GRYFFINDOR’, the hat shouted
He felt the warmth in his heart knowing how much he meant to Draco.
Left him a little bit bitter inside.
His lips then trailed down to his neck, biting it aggressively that make Draco moaned because it felt so good while it hurts.
“Oh… Are you going to be late? - Oh.. I don’t have any other transportation. No. It’s late at night and I don’t want to call an Uber or ride a bus. Oh- Well I'd rather wait but can you come as quickly as you can? I’m tired - Thank you.” He ended the call and put the phone down, gave a frustrated sigh.
At this moment, Draco wished he could run away, wipe their memories and planted a fake memories so there’s a evidence that he did his detention but sadly, it was not possible. He was not powerful enough … for now at least.
He was threshing on Harry’s lap, while his hand held on to the base of Harry’s large cock with Harry’s fingers up his arse, it’s making a simple task extremely hard. Once he grasped his cock firmly, he guided it to his stretched hole that had been released from Harry’s fingers.
They laughed and some of Draco’s tiredness was fading. Draco invites him to sit on the bench beside him and he finally sits down after standing for what seems like a while. Where is his manners his parents taught him since young.
‘Cassiopeia was worried about you, you know?’ continues Severus as Draco was still silent.
“Really?”
It had been a week since he kept coming back to the same room looking for the mirror. The second day he went back to the mirror, he brought his own mirror with him because the inscription on the mirror made him curious so he reflections his own mirror to the inscription.
‘Wait a minute, I’ll follow you’, said Draco. He stood up with his precious book in his hand and followed Cassie out of the Hall, he have to calm Cassie because an angry Cassiopeia Malfoy is not going to be a good day for him.
He was aware of a hard pinch on his cheek but he shook it off the first time but the second pinched was hard that he had to rubbed his hand to his cheek.
“It’s the same all over”, said Mr Borgin, in his oily voice. “Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere-”
He then took the nipple that he was licking into his mouth, sucking onto it. Draco was a hot mess beneath him, the only thing he could his roamed his hand on Harry’s back and rubbed their cock together.
Draco was on his heels the moment Peeves floated away to find Filch.
And anyways, if you have any idea for the fic, just comment or private message me.. your idea will be considerate :)
‘What? It’s brilliant what Draco said!’, said Theo with his mouth full. ‘If you keep defending them, I might think that you might have fancy on one of them. We wouldn’t want that, would we?’, added Theo, sneering at the idea.
While he was thinking about Potter, he heard a ‘ding’ coming from his phone. He took it in his hand and found he had a message from Pansy forcing him to do Tik Tok with her. He read the message without replying and he knows that usually riles Pansy up.
Cassie brought her hand to the door, suddenly her hand came to a stop as they were both took a very deep breathe and hand hesitantly knocked on the door.
Pansy was sorted into Slytherin and after she was sorted, Professor Mcgonagall called Potter’s name and he was sorted in Gryffindor. Weasley was sorted into Gryffindor too, house of brave people said. Blaise too was sorted into Slytherin.
Harry was circling his fingers around Draco’s tight ring hole, eyes lust looking at him as he picked his head up and kiss him full on the lips, biting his lips.
He crossed his arms and looked towards Weasley, his jaws was bruised from where he punched it. He congratulate himself internally.
Draco kept on feeding Harry until the plate is empty as Harry kept on roaming both of his hands on Draco’s smooth pale body. He still kept on teasing Draco here and there, especially with his cock, thrusting up till it hits his prostate and then abandoned it, the plate on Draco’s hand almost fall to the ground.
They heard footsteps of Filch, running towards the shouts of Peeves from out of the room. Peeves, as always, was picking at the school caretaker, messing with him and heard the sound of whooshing and Filch walked away with rage.
This was Potter’s first match as the “Youngest Seeker of a Century”, he scoffed when he heard about it from Cassie. Since the incident in the lavatory, she had befriended Granger and that leads to her being acquaintances with Potter and Weasley. They were still not friend because Cassie haven’t forgave for what Weasley said about her family.
He was not done yet so with him still inside of Draco, he gripped Draco’s legs with his big strong arms, he dragged Draco’s legs and throw them over his huge wide shoulders.
Harry felt his cock are leaking with his cum but he wanted to tease Draco further. “You want Daddy to come inside of you?” he asked into his ears, his rough sex voice took over.
Draco was wearing a sleeveless, above the knees white dress, blue butterflies pattern printed around the dress, the dress was a little bit loose so that he could be comfortable, sometimes he missed wearing his tight dresses.
“Thanks.”
After a few minutes of two centaur named Bane and Ronan argued with a nice centaur named Firenze, Firenze finally strolled passed them, followed by Draco beside him as the centaur walked slowly so Draco could keep up.
His eyes were met with the messy black hair boy he last saw in the robe shop. There is a boy with ginger haired with him.
‘Your Mother was a noble woman, she had her own ideology that made her disagree with your grandfather that made your grandfather fuming at her, and his last straw was when she told she wanted to marry to Sirius Black’, Draco waited for the long paused before Severus continued.
Did Potter just said that he was a stinky Slytherin? Did he implied that all Slytherins are bad?
He looked around for Cassie and saw that she rode with Daphne and the goons, he nudged both of his friends and nodded his head towards Cassie, they laughed because they knew Cassie didn’t like them.
He tore off the hand from his eyes and mouth agape.
They chatted for hours until they didn’t realize that train came to a stop, Draco and his friends were excited because they were told that Hogwarts was beautiful not by their parents but by
“Draco,” Mother spoke calmly, Draco who doesn't have the time for this waits impatiently for words to come out of her mouth.
“Well she’s not going to because firstly the idea of you and her hanging out is already wrong in my father’s eyes. Secondly, if I heard you tell her, I will tell him about the ‘secret study’ and let me tell you, my father wouldn’t be pleased.”
“You shouldn’t have bite me until leaving hickey, you know my skin is sensitive and it’s going to bruise,” complained as he looked into the mirror, seeing the fresh new bruises that are going to form next morning. Harry came to his side and slid his arm around his waist, leaned down and kissed his temple.
Before she gets to blow her whistle, the Longbottom kid pushes off hard. ‘Come back, boy!’ she shouted, but Longbottom was rising higher and higher - twelve feet - twenty feet, at this point, he felt that Madam Hooch was useless. What is the point of being a Quidditch teacher when she can’t use her brain to mount her broom and save the boy.
They are finally done with their N.E.W.T.s exams, they both agree to finally tell the Malfoy’s that her daughter is dating The Girl-Who-Lived Twice. Celestial was having a panic attack while discussing it until Iris agreed to stop.
Mother and Draco walked towards them and greeted them formally. He then stands next to Cassie while Mother and Father are having a conversation with the families.
Being at the Astronomy Tower brings her back to the first time they were here, months ago. The only thing that changes is Celestial’s hair colour, she dyed it to violet and everytime Iris looks at her, her breath stops, her internal organs are screaming at her to just kiss the girl already.
Harry’s arm being his pillow and him buried his head on the crook of Harry’s neck, kissing the soft skin tenderly.
Draco hopes that Madam Hooch was stripped from her job because she’s doing a bloody bad job at it and thought of what would happened if she really getting fired, an image of her throwing a tantrum, stomping her feet and fly off riding a giant hawk leaving the school ground popped out in his head and laughed at the thought but the Slytherins thought that he was laughing at Longbottom.
When Draco was in the room, he closed the door behind him quietly and addressed his sister,“You know I accidentally found a photo album that mother never addressed it to us, and I wanna see what's in it so let's find the album that has a purple cover. Now servant of mine, SEARCH”, he laughed and started searching.
When Draco asks him for his order, he makes a huge fool out of himself. He was embarrassed at the time he was done but hearing Draco chuckles lift up his mood. He doesn’t know why his brain said that it was alright if his food had some pickles in it.
‘Uhmm- uhmm I-’, Potter stuttered. ‘Just show me, I really have no idea’, said Potter looking at Draco with those emerald eyes that he would always lost into. Draco took the ashwinder and gave it to Potter, they hand slightly brushed together.
He felt that Harry placed his hand on top of his, slowly and tenderly intertwining his hand with Draco’s and drawing his hand back after a few minutes.
He was only wearing a tank top and booty shorts so to him, it was easy to tear it off his body and change into his wolf form. He stood there naked for five seconds as he closed his eyes, his brain conjuring his wolf form image.
Mother was beside him when she whispered softly to his ears, “Don’t listen to him, I just wanna tell you that whatever house you are in, I will be proud,” while caressing his cheek.
Before she can continue, Iris cuts her off with a shocked look on her face, “Me and Malfoy? We wouldn’t be in a relationship! I mean it doesn’t mean when one spends too much time with each other and when one of them is obviously not straight, it doesn't mean they are in a relationship. Malfoy is not even gay.”
“Did you give anything for her on Valentine’s Day?”
He does have a family driver but he told Logan to not pick him up from the university since he thought he was going to spend some time in the library - his sacred place until the sky turned dark blue to scratch some designs since he took a course in fashion designing which was highly disapproved of by father.
He didn’t want to seem vulnerable in front of Severus. He doesn’t like to show his emotion, he was never the type of person to explain his emotion but the image he saw in the mirror makes him want to tell someone everything, he wanted to express his emotion.
They invited their family members two weeks after Draco gave birth to their house, meeting the new members of the Potter’s family. It was the only day where Draco and Harry were free from the babies because the Weasley’s wanted to hold them.
He went to his desk to read, he saw the newspaper and the photograph, the memories from the day before flooded his mind.
He came out of his deep thought and had an idea, ''Cass, wanna make some mischief today?” he raised his left eyebrow.
The troll decided that he wants to swing his bat at his sister. Oh hell where is the professor when you need them.
love you guys and thank you for those comment and kudos! I really appreciate it.
He had informed his mother that he will work today and mother reminded him to not be late and he did exactly what he was told not to - be late. He called for an uber since his bitch of a best friend - Pansy Parkinson, begged him to borrow his car for a day.
Harry leaned down and whispered into Draco’s ears, “Be my cock warmer, I want to be inside you as you feed me. I wanna feel you, I want to be connected to you in the best possible way”.
Draco lifted onto his knees, straddling Harry’s thighs so that they could have an easier access.
“How do you feel, Draco?” Asked Harry when he heard no sound of his voice except for his breathing heavily, slipping his cock out of Draco.
“Ah, so this is the boy’s problem,'' he thought to himself and smirked, Draco didn’t interrupt them because he wants to know where the conversation will go.
Draco was walking besides Potter when he heard she mumbles under her breathe. ‘ These two - just like them- I thought I was done - once they graduate - but - no- they have to reproduce such a - reckless- troublemaker- child’.
Mother rolls her eyes but she puts a tiny smile on her face,” Yes, Draco we should be going home now, do you need anything else?” She asked
Well he knows the answer of course because he rejected most of them who advance in asking him to be their boyfriend, but most of them were too plain or just too cocky, reminding him of his father’s personality which he hates.
Pulling him closer to his chest, Draco cuddling him, arm wrapped around his hard chest, feeling content. Potter wrapped his hands and legs around Draco, not intended to let go, leaving no space between them. Potter sneaked his hand down to Draco’s arse and squeeze it fondly as he laid down kisses on his face.
Iris decides to speak up, “Lucius, just let your daughter say whatever she wants, you have no authority over her anymore.”
“No, you should be in Slytherin no matter what,” he said while Mother gave his Father a stern look.
Once they arrived, Draco looked around the common room, the room has a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling, from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was cackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece. The wall was decorated with tapestries.
Draco’s legs automatically wrapped around Harry’s waist as he fuck him hard, arms wrapping around his neck. Harry’s hand went to his nipples, he pulled his nipple, pinching it until the buds is hard, he then twirled his nipple around with his fingers while his other hand groped his boob.
“Well you can be in too deep with the girl you kissed weeks ago, right?”
Harry was wearing a slim black jeans matching with a blue short sleeves shirt tugged inside, he looks so hot right now - not that he was never not hot in the first place.
“It’s not my fault that you were made for me.”
He paused to examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to read, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals :
When he walked inside, both his mother and Cassie greeted him but he didn’t have time for it and shoveled the newspaper and the photograph to his mothers arm and waited for an answer.
‘Dumbledore told me about the mirror’, Severus spoken those few sentence careful, watching his reaction.
“Smart Dobby, do it more”, said Draco encouragingly. He shouldn’t encourage Dobby but what’s the harm in that.
“Yes, like an hour ago. Why?” eyes never leave the telly, intrigued by the show he watched.
He was scowling as he looked at them but thank goodness he didn’t ask for any explanation on where they were. Their journey back home was silence, nobody dare to speak about the scene father and Mr Weasley cause in the bookstore.
He turned away and saw a cabinet right in front of him. It was a big black cabinet that could fit at least four people inside, he walked forward and stretched out his hand to touch the exterior design of the cabinet, he realised the cabinet has a handle instead his hand went for the handle.
“Yes, please.” Jamie smiled brightly that his gums were showing and made a move to lay beside Draco. Jamie’s head immediately connected to the pillow lying facing his mama, Draco was laying in between his husband and his son as his body was facing his son - of course.
As she smoked the cigarette, her brain was describing Celestial’s features. How her face has aristocratic features. Just everything about her is so perfect.
“Does Father know who the Death Eaters were because he clearly was one before the end of the Wizarding War,” he spatted. How dare father, still in rank of the Dark Side even after his sister died by the hand of his side.
Draco, being a good brother that he is, held her hand and squeezed it like he did with Daphne. She squeezed back and walked toward the hat.
“What do you have for me, baby?” asked Draco because he was done playing the guessing game and he knows Harry actually wanted it to be a surprise anyways.
At night, they would meet secretly at the tower. There’s no need for a conversation because they are comfortable with just each other’s present.
“Daddy, move please Daddy,” begged Draco when he realised that he hadn't started thrusting into this body.
He did brought his camera with him because he wanted to capture his first experience getting a detention.
When he heard the sound of Dobby’s Apparation, he stood up from his sitting position and conjured her some purple hyacinth on her grave that was covered with thick snow. He left the cemetery with Dobby as the elf took his hand and dragged his body away to apparate back to the manor.
Draco casts a cooling charm at Dobby’s burns and waited ten minutes, after ten minutes, he conjured a bandage from somewhere.
As days went by, Draco was giving less and less attention to Jamie like he used to. It’s not because he loves him less than before, the twins grabbed his attention all the time by crying out loud. When he succeeded in making the twins stop crying, it was already late at night.
“Scorpius - Scorpius Hyperion Potter,” announced Harry as he hiccuped with fat tears rolling down his face. Seconds later, Scorpius cries his eyes out, and Harry hands him to him and takes Adrian in his arms as he is breastfed from him.
When the last item was put in the trunk, Draco stood up and walked to the dining hall. He opened the door and observed the room, there was his father who sat at the end of the table which is the head sit where father always sits, while Mother sat at his right hand side, Cassie was beside her.
Few more weeks until they could get out of the hellhole called home. Draco did informed Dobby about the book and he confirmed that the book was curse - and now he has a mission to take the book from girl Weasley before something bad happen, at the same time, he might want to know what was the book about. Curiosity really might kill him one day - without a doubt.
As Harry picked on a movie to watch, Draco rested his head on Harry, waiting for him  to choose, fingers trailing slowly on Harry’s muscular arm, the arms he felt safe in, the arms that wrapped possessively around his lithe body all the time. The arms he hold onto when they had a wild sex.
Cassie spoke after minutes of silence,“ You are still my little brother you know although you’re actually my cousin, I love you like I did before, nothings changed,” He was so touched that he hugged her tightly while holding the photo.
She turned to the rest of the class. ‘None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say “Quidditch”. Come on, dear’.
He took Harry’s arm, closing his fingers making it into a fist with only his pointer finger standing tall, he pointed it to the sky, slowly tracing one of the stars and then connected it to another star until it formed one complete constellation.
“I know right! Whoever did it, please be my friend except if they are Gryffindors but I don’t think so because they targeted Gryffindor’s students”, said Draco agreeing, proudly praises himself and flattered at Pansy’s comment.
“Want to play Exploding Snap?” he asked, holding the cards on his hand he magically conjured (in Draco case, he stole it from Cassie on the way out) she nodded her head, putting the magazine down for the first time, and for the rest of the train ride, he focused on winning the game and did not think about Potter at all.
“Harry- right there - yes baby suck me,” moaned Draco breathlessly.
He took the letter out and unfolded it, scanned through the letter and find the message very useful. He read it half way when he decided that he was going to borrow the book so Weasley will not raised any suspicion of what he was going to do with them.
Harry is always texting him to remind him to not wear himself out and he believes he will ace his exam. Harry might have some faith in him but truth be told, he doesn't have any faith in himself. He just wants his score to be perfect.
Blaise were kissing someone in the corner of the room but he didn’t who did he kissed but one thing he knows is that it was a man kissing Blaise.
Draco had been walking around his house, trying to find his troublemaker son when he realized that he had not seen him since he told him that he was going to cook dinner. He thought for once his son listened to him but when he had done with his cooking and called out to his son. He heard a sound giggle somewhere in the house.
, said Wealsey to Granger, he was trying to convinced Granger something about dragon.
‘Professor Dumbledore told me about you, he knows you have been to the room for most of the night before the Christmas breaks and he knows you will come here again once you come back from the break’, explained Severus as he sat himself down beside him.
Silently asking permission to enter her mouth, Celestial gave a soft moan once her tongue entered her mouth. They tongue battled for dominance and Celestial won only because she let her.
‘Good one, Draco’, said Blaise between the laughs.
The thud of a metal went flying pulling him out his thinking, when he looked over, both Mr Weasley and father went tumbling to the ground, they were tussling on the ground, Cassie was holding his hand really tightly that it hurts and she was closing her eyes, afraid to look at them.
Hagrid gave a little chuckle and protest at the idea of writing lines. The big oaf then gave them a precaution on what do the when they are in the forest. They must find a unicorn because they were badly injured that their silver blood spilled out of them.
“Come love - show me how much I affect you,” growled Harry into his ears and he finally came, cum shooting out of him and to Harry’s shirt that he didn’t take it off.
‘Holy Merlin’s beard’, he whispered quietly hoping the beast in front of him didn't sense their present but from the eyes that were staring dangerously at them, he knew his luck had ended or maybe his life would end.
(See the end of the chapter for
She turned the volume up for, ‘Listen, I would be the first in the frame from the start because it was going to be a boy’s voice that’s going to sing and you jump in when it was the girl’s voice, understand?’
The creaking sound the floor made as he walked up to Jamie’s room, slowly opening the door as he saw his first son, crying soundlessly, slapping himself on the cheeks as he repeatedly chanted, “Bad Jamie, bad bad bad boy.”
“After this we are going to buy your racing broom, I want you to be in the Slytherin quidditch team this year.”, said father as he place the chest on the counter, his arms lazily rests on top of the counter.
He knows he’s a Malfoy so he tried to type in @dracomalfoy in the search bar and nothing came up but some random accounts, he tried another user and still the end result is another random account.
‘Do something you brainless fool of a teacher’, shouted Cassie beside him. When he looked at her, she saw fear in her eyes. Madam Hooch decides to ignore her.
He starts to thrust into the tight body slowly as he follows Draco’s rhythms of his body.
Without giving them a second glance, she walks up to her room, slamming the door behind her once she arrives, fucking throw away her schoolwork. She didn’t care if it’s ruin or not. All she cares about is how to deal with her jealous heart.
‘Well isn’t it the know-it-all girl’, he rolled his eyes and continued. ‘First of all, we are already in trouble since we are all out of curfew and the duel is just an addition to the trouble that we already caused’.
When the chance comes, he walks to Jamie, who was playing with Teddy and Victoire - Bill and Fleur’s daughter, they were playing with Jamie’s car toys, he sat beside Jamie and took one of the toy car into his hand, moving the car into the thin air as he makes a vrooming sound. He of course was being ignored by Jamie, he should have known.
‘Why can’t they wait until next week, now I’ve lost a bet to Pomona’, as she shakes her head hating that she had lost a bet.
“Do you love to you see your mama in pain, Jamie?”, asked Draco as he chuckled at his son’s antics.
Harry stopped tickling him when the door to his level opened, he stepped out with Harry pressing his finger hard on the closing button.
‘ What is she doing with her?!’’, said Draco bitterly. He had no problem with students from Gryffindor excluding Weasley and Potter since Sirius was a Gryffindor but he do have problem with Granger. She’s a nuisance, always one step ahead of him and he didn’t like it one bit.
They were going to have a detention with Hagrid but it must not be that bad, right? Without him voicing his opinion, Filch saw the delight grin from Potter’s face and quickly squashed it away, because he said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy - it’s into the Forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.”
Draco scrambled and stood by a broomstick near his friends, Pansy was looking down at the broomstick with disgust since she doesn’t like Quidditch unlike Cassie. Blaise was enjoying the expression of Pansy’s face, Pansy crouched down and took the broom in her hand, knocking Blaise’s head with it.
“You don’t have to be afraid, Cel. We are going to be just fine,” she reassured her violet-haired girlfriend, laying on the hard floor of the Astronomy Tower, hands pillowing their head. The place has been their spot for months now. Probably since the first month of school but they find solace here and they first understand each other here too.
She was glaring at Theo as if she was wishing that her glare could burn a hole on him but Theo only listen half-hearted as he waved his hand on her, telling her to shut up because they were more interest in the Gryffindor’s conversation.
Draco nodded his head yes as he looked up into Harry’s green eyes.
He was loved by the people close to him. To Sirius, Draco is his light. Always.
The crack sound of an apparition indicating that Dobby finally heard he was being called. Dobby bowed down to him, his pencil-like nose touched the ground. “Draco called for Dobby, sir?”
She helped him tie his hair to make it stand up. After she was satisfied with her work, she pulled out her phone from the pocket and open the tik tok application.
“Your obsession with Harry Potter is not healthy, Dobby.” Draco laughed at Dobby's embarrassed face at being caught. He patted Dobby’s head just because he felt like it. Dobby giggled while hiding his face with his dirty clothes, not that it help or anything.
Holy fuck. Draco knows that doggy-style is one of his favourite sex position. Harry gives a slap on the smooth of his arse, his huge palm imprinted on Draco’s arse cheeks, thanking him.
Mother looks at him with a questioning look before looking down at the item in her hand, when she realized it, she quickly glanced up at him. He stood there waiting while Mother tried to come up with an explanation, Cassie who was clearly enjoying her breakfast stopped her chewing.
‘Stick out your right hand over your broom,’ ordered Madam Hooch at the front, ‘and say, “Up!” ’
“Are you alright?”
Draco looked at him as if he was out of his mind without releasing their joined hands since he loves the feelings of Harry’s body contact on him.
‘ I don’t think it was fair actually’, he looked down and sighs as he shrugged his shoulders, giving a dramatic effect to his situation.
It was hard feeding two babies at one time, he had to find a good position which took him ten minutes when he felt his body didn’t accumulate to a certain spot. He settled on a double rugby ball hold position, which he read on an infant care book he bought on his first pregnancy with Jamie.
‘Okay let’s continue the game’, said Pansy but she was interrupted by Harry.
He touches his snout with Harry’s, asking for an apology for laughing at him and Harry ignored him, he kept on going rubbing their snout together until Draco licked up Harry’s face and bit his ear off.
‘ And now I kind of regretted it’, he said as he took Draco’s hand to stand.
Although he was far from them, he could hear and see Mr Weasley cheeks flushed darker than when he was taunting his children, few minutes ago.
“Well, I am yours so what are you going to do about it?”, asked Draco seductively into his ear.
“Aren’t the both of you a pumpkin pie”, mocked Cassie as she was looking down at the camera in her hand, the photo she just took of him and Dobby. She showed her great picture taking skill to him. He regrets teaching her how to work the camera.
Mother walked up to him and kissed his head, they greeted each other, he closed his eyes as he felt his mother’s mouth on top of his head.
Last night terror was still fresh in his mind, he become curious about the three headed door not that he was meddling in the situation or anything but he wanted to know why in the bloody hell would Dumbledore place a massive dog inside a school full of students.
“Did you do anything to Harry Potter”, asked Draco suddenly, he don’t know why he did but he knows Dobby looked up to Potter fiercely, he felt a little jealousy in him because Dobby is his friend and not Potter but he didn’t say it out loud.
Both of them stopped walking in the middle of Diagon Alley, Narcissa looked down at her nephew who has been her son for the past ten years, she loves him dearly just like she loves her own daughter.
“We will do better this year, father.”, answered Cassie, her voice are trembling although she try very hard not to.
“Do you think this is funny? We see if it’s funny if I kick your balls and blood is coming out of it instead. We'll see who’s the one laughing in the end.”
Before darkness greets Draco, his last thought were that Harry was going to be jumping in glee when he breaks the news to him that there are already a baby growing inside of him.
‘What was that for?’, he asked her but her attention was towards the Gryffindor. She was helping Longbottom from Crabbe and Goyle.
Draco and Cassie entered the compartment, he sat down while Cassie put her trunk under the seat.
“Hogwarts are in danger, Draco.”, answered Dobby finally. Draco let out a long breath.
“Uhm- Dobby could you bring me some food? I’m hungry and don’t call me young master when we are alone, I already told you that”, ordered Draco, eyes curiously analyzing Dobby’s body.
Draco moaned louder than before when three fingers enter his hole and hits his prostate relentlessly, precum shooting out his length.
“Oh so that’s the big giant name”, Draco thought to himself.
’Yeah yeah whatever, are we going to duel or not because I’m getting tired looking at your face’, said Draco with boredom planted on his face, fake yawning as to add to the effect. He looked at Potter, waiting for his signal but Cassie beat him first.
They run around the forest, jumping on the lodge, sounds of dried leaf as they trudge through the familiar path.
I'm going to say sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the late update. It was just hard for me to sit down and focus on one thing. This chapter is second to last before the end of first year, so I have decided that next chapter was the end for first year.
Draco was embarrassed because this should not be the image of a respected pureblood he learned from him years ago, his eyes went to Pansy and Blaise - he kinda forgot that they were still here, witnessing Lucius Malfoy and Arthur Weasley on the dirty floor.
“You promise?” she asked in a weak voice, sounding unsure of whatever was going through her mind right now.
“You are a weird girl -”
Before she gets in too deep with her thoughts running around her head, she is determined to solve the problem by walking, it usually helps her to clear her mind.
“This year, Harry Potter will go to Hogwarts and I want you guys to associate yourself with him, understand?” Father speaks sternly while finishing up his last bite.
He sat there silent, waiting for a word coming out of his mouth. They stare into each other's eyes when out of nowhere, Harry chuckles.
“Three packs of tampons and make it quick,” she ordered without any sweetness in her voice.
Jamie kept on patting his cheeks with his soft chubby hand as they went to the couch, with Jamie in his arms, he slowly sat down and moved Jamie to his lap, carefully not putting pressure on his pregnant stomach.
Harry introduced their new babies to his best friends while Draco just lay on the bed looking at him, grateful for having Harry in his life, when he was a kid, he never thought that he could have a family he loved very dearly from heart because father would always tells him that marriage is an obligation to the Pureblood custom but once in Eighth Year, Harry was trying to court him with the help of Hermione and Ron, he threw his so called ‘obligation’ to the window.
He stayed sitting on bed for his body to adjust, his leg was hanging but not touching the floor. After a while, he stood up and walked towards the bathroom. Towel drapes from his shoulder.
“Don’t be such a dramatic bitch, Draco,” said Pansy as she rolled her eyes at him after a few minutes of him keeping his silence, Blaise nodding his head agreeing to what she said. “You said I was obsessed! With him nonetheless.”
When he finally kissed his mouth, Draco felt the butterflies in his stomach broke free.
Longbottom with his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch followed by Cassie who was holding his arm carefully, Madam Hooch told her to stay with the rest of the students but she tells her that he needs someone by his side so they walked off to hospital wing.
Since they don’t have Transfiguration with Pansy, he last saw her yesterday morning and he was glad for it.
“It was not our fault that Granger girl is better than us, you should be proud we did great on the exam that we could advance to our second year, but instead you-,” before he could finished his sentence, father slapped him hard on his left cheek. Beside him, Cassie clamped her hand around her mouth.
He added after a few seconds of waiting.
“What do you want, Malfoy?”, said Weasley finally as he gritted his teeth, looking rather annoyed.
She fucking loves the night view and the woman in her arms right now.
Finally, the old man shut up but give him a nasty look and he held their eye contact until Filch broke it off. Out of the corner of his eyes, the Gryffindor was amazed by his insults, even the corner of Potter’s mouth lift a little.
Draco gulped while still looking at her and accidentally bumped Longbottom, he tripped, grabbed Weasley, who was close to him, around his waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armour.
“I could walk beside you, no trouble”, added Draco and the centaur nodded his head. Potter jumped onto the his back but then two bloody centaur came over and they argued with Firenze.
