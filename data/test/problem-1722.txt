Harry doesn’t know. It’s just easy to talk to Draco. Not simple,
Malfoy gestures for him to have a look around, as he pulls the clothing out of his tiny bag.
“Well, let me just get the diagnostics running, and we’ll see what’s manifested between the two of you! I’m not getting any hints of Dark magic at this point, from the preliminary runs. Does it feel foreign to either of you, like someone else's' magic you don’t recognize?”
“Oh, come on, Harry. You know you’re going to take the job. You’ll be the married couple of Hogwarts, the kids will be fascinated by you two,” she says. Ron and Hermione have already gone to the kitchen and are exclaiming faintly over the table spread.
“Are you? Or are you not,” Harry asks.
drain your magical energy. Bonds are meant to strengthen a couple, bring their magic together. The bond needs to become used to the two of you. Simply nurture it.”
“What would I have to gain, really, in lying,” Draco says dryly.
“Draco,” he yells over the music, which has seemed to get louder. Draco leans down to lend him an ear. “You’re my baby.” He kisses that very ear, quick and smacking.
He sounds young, his voice soft. Harry feels like Malfoy maybe hasn’t shown anyone this before. The room is lit with beautiful Victorian fringed lamps, in reds and pinks, and fairy lights twirled around the tops of the vanities. Harry realizes, as he is walking along and looking at the clothes, that there is a small corner with a worn armchair and fringed pillows with a little side table, where a book on groupie tell-alls sits, with a half drunk cup of coffee. It makes Harry’s heart skip a beat.
“I like that you know about this stuff,” Harry says. Draco breathes an assent through his nose. “It’s nice. I like when you teach me.”
I could feel her fear surface the moment I touched the memory, her breathing went from relaxed to sharp and panicked. I could see Lupin throwing the spell at her and then a rise of her panic remembering the battle at the ministry of magic. She had PTSD. The memory went grey as soon as the spell was fired and all emotion vanished.
The thought that he could feel anything but hatred for me after what happened was not realistic. I’m sure thinking of what happened would bring up bad memories for him.
“Unfortunately, concessions have to be made for the endgame result. He has too many supporters right now.” Snape said seriously.
"I see. Are you not able to feel that it was cursed by Voldemort, or do you just not care? How on earth would you find a missing diadem anyways? Did you want even more knowledge? Is this how you've been passing all your classes?" She ranted hotly, her normally pale cheeks red with fury.
"He can give you the world you know." He said pacing towards me stopping just short of me.
"You think she is trying to bond with ME?" I asked with a sarcastic chuckle. It was ludacris.
I would never normally consider dabbling in the dark arts. It was forbidden and I knew how dangerous it was, how addictive it could become. I was desperate though and I knew if anything held the answer, that was the most likely option.
"You guys go without me, I'm going to be a while and I don't want you late too."
"I love you." He said breaking the kiss and whispering the words as he kissed down my stomach, each kiss lighting up a new part of my body.
"I have a class to teach."
"I didn't know you could cook." I said walking over nervously to see what he had made. Eggs and sausage were already done, he was just flipping some perfectly made French toast over. He looked at me skeptically with a raised eyebrow.
"Snape left this for you." Ginny said, handing me the pocket watch. I nodded numbly and ran upstairs grabbing the diadem. It was in the far corner of my trunk almost forgotten and I had to dig a bit to find it, my hands shaking.
When I went to my safe place during torture, I saw her. Somehow I had summoned her in my mind, the fact that she left to go find me and had shown up where I was proved that she wasn’t just a figment of my imagination. I pushed away a stray piece of her hair from her face and let myself indulge looking at her despite feeling guilty.
"Oh, I'm sorry, but CLEARLY you wanted it. Right?" I asked him smirking at the dumbfounded look on his face. I slammed my book shut and stomped off not caring if I got points docked or not. He had no idea what I was going through, how confusing this all was. Who was he to mock me asking if I wanted to be put in the position of dying or doing whatever Voldemort wanted?
"Finally, Minnie has found Mister and his friend!" A slightly annoyed house elf said appearing before us with a start. She wore a nice uniform of black and white that fit her perfectly and she was quite round in the middle, which was something that was uncommon with house elves. She had a tray of hot chocolate she gave to Severus who gave me a hot drink before grabbing his own.
"Severus?" He said pulling me back to reality, his worry stronger now than before.
"Why else would Voldemort be interested in me? I mean, it makes sense. Snape said the plan was to make me bond with him, it was Voldemort's plan. I assumed he just meant to develop affection, but now that I think about it, I think he meant magically bond. Which Empaths do." I confessed realizing as I said it aloud that it really did make perfect sense. He was quiet for a long moment considering.
"I've been busy!" I said defensively all the while knowing it was incredibly foolish to not have thought of such a thing before. I was royally fucked if I ended up having the child of a death eater. My studies would go out the window in an instant, not to mention the rumors that would swirl around me for the rest of my life.
"Let me make something perfectly clear. I don't care." He said squeezing my arm even tighter for extra effect I glared at him and Hagrid stepped in between us forcing him to release me.
"JUST a witch? No. You're the future. The present. Your everything you desire and more." He said dramatically, his sincerity was just overwhelming and I could entirely understand why people would fall for him. I could humor him while remembering he was a psychopath. Other people would fall for his charm like dominos.
Everyone worked silently and since it was a repeat potion they mostly did a tolerable job. I finally got up part way through the class and did my rounds. Neville had managed a slightly less toxic sludge than usual. Draco's was almost good enough to be sold in my company. Almost. Potter had done good for the first time this year, perhaps even better than Draco. Weasley's was a barely passable mess that might or might not turn the drinker into a troll.
“I HAVE been kind. I haven’t insulted her recently.” I retorted annoyed he would assume I’m so stupid. He sighed and rolled his eyes.
Mine was almost ready, but I stared down into the simmering pot considering my chances. They never combined potions and spell work, it was explicitly taboo. I shouldn’t even try it and I knew Snape would kill me if he found out I did it. I bit my lip nervously before gathering up courage.
“She is a task the Headmaster has assigned to me. That’s it. I don’t love her.” I said forcefully. He sighed, his aged features softening quite a bit.
He just sighed thickly as if expecting company, but extremely annoyed at their presence.
I sat down in the chair lost in thought, just absorbed with watching the trusting way she looked at me.
“I have spent the nighttime studying curses and spells to protect Harry and I. Don’t act like you don’t know where this war is headed Professor.” I said quietly watching his stern expression with a mixture of my own curiosity now. He raised an eyebrow to this.
"Surely you know what you are, don't you?" He said after a moment, his expression becoming serious as he gazed at our reflection in the mirror.
My body ached for more than just a kiss, my desire for her was building with each say and her showing she wanted to be with me was enough to test my capabilities of restraining myself. The kiss was hot and intense and sadly far too short. She pulled back panting, slightly out of breath and her smile intoxicating.
"I want to trust you, but you're literally the most fucked up person I know. You tell Voldemort you're on his side to appease him, you say the same thing to Dumbledore, two of the most intelligent, bright people I know. Honestly I don't think your loyal to either of them." I said wanting to trust him, but not quite there. He seemed surprised. Clearly he wasn't used to being called out for his trickery.
"Not me." I said staunchly.
“I suppose your right…a boy wouldn’t want a bookworm…a man though…” She said trailing off with her own knowing smile. I choked a bit on my hot chocolate realizing her innuendo. She seemed so sweet and innocent.
"Of course it's worth it! Why won't you fight back Hermione? Did you want it or something?" He asked giving me a disgusted look. The air thickened around me and in a split second Ron was thrust back out of his chair, spilling over in a messy heap on the floor.
“What does it matter to you anyways?” I asked with a huff of annoyance at him making conditions to our arrangement. He gazed at me for a long moment taking me in. The intensity of his gaze was so strong I felt myself shifting nervously.
This time I was the monster hurting people.
I glanced down and couldn’t figure out what she meant.
I was silent on the walk and endured Professor McGonagall’s lectures without being bothered. By the time we got to the headmasters office she had spent all her energy lecturing me and seemed calmer.
“What?” I asked distractedly.
Harry nudged me pointing to the side of the room and I gasped seeing the bodies of the previous administration lying piled together lifeless.
It was perfect. I just hoped my suspicions were correct. I had spent years going through every corridor in the school and never saw anything of importance like the diadem, but I knew it had to be around here somewhere.
I wanted to stop him, yet another part of me was curious what came next. I didn’t know I had a rebellious side to myself, but it came out full throttle and I wanted to continue and push the limits of what I was exposed to.
"Nevermind. What is the last thing you remember?" I asked worrying how deeply the memory issue went.
I was angry at Ron so didn’t want to talk to him, but Harry and Draco had snuck off to a secluded corner somewhere to hang out uninterrupted. I found myself going into my favorite place, an old bookstore at the very end of Hogsmeade that was neglected and no one ever went in. The books it held were unique and high quality, not like the newer book stores low cost knock offs.
"Severus, Severus. Rise my trusted servant." The Dark Lord hissed from his throne at Malfoy manor. My heart was pounding from screaming from the cruciatus curse for so long and my throat felt swollen. His good mood from the holidays was gone and I had managed to royally piss him off.
“I know that. I want to make one.” I said firmly. I expected him to laugh. Me? Make a spell? It was insanity.
"Well, don't you think you can just give us some privacy?" He asked pointedly, obviously wanting me to put up a silencing charm. I shrugged trying not to look too suspicious.
“Would you preferred I let Lucius do the honors? Granger, I don’t know what you wanted me to do.” He said his anger seeming to die down a bit after a moment. I could see his own tension at the memory come through his mask that was heavily thinned by the alcohol.
“Yea, after you had your fun, huh? Dumbledore will never let you stay at Hogwarts after this!” Harry yelled from the floor getting back up ready for round two. Snape ignored him and turned his focus back to me.
"Kill me then." I said looking up at him, my devastation turning to anger.
I tried to focus on his conversation, but my thoughts went back to her and what I saw and felt in her mind. She was not dark, she was full of lightness and emotions I couldn't even place. She deserved so much better than me and I had a feeling having someone know her secret would bring her back to reality. I tried to tell myself it would be fine and I didn't care, but part of me knew I had already decided she was mine and would lose my mind if anyone else ever touched her.
"Yes well, your forgetting the bonding goes both ways Miss. Granger. You didn't just fall in love with me, I fell in love with you." He said as if that explained it all. He sighed a bit seeing my confused expression.
"THIS!" She said throwing the paper at me. Part of the daily prophet tumbled to the floor, but the other part I managed to grab just to see my picture in the first page.
“Don’t miss another class Granger.” He warned me darkly before sweeping away. Just as he was leaving the door opened and Harry came in. It was well past curfew, but Snape said nothing, the silent agreement being you keep my secrets and I keep yours.
“Lavender isn’t the best source for what girls want…and maybe so…but when there is already feelings there. I don’t feel that way for you.” I said bluntly since hinting wasn’t going to work on someone as thick headed as him. He looked at me bewildered then his expression changed and darkened.
"You gained access to my magic, but I also gained access to yours. While you were over there panicking I was stealing enough of your magic to heal myself. When I was done I gave that and as much of mine as I could spare to you. Hence the giant explosion." He said, his eyes shining mirthfully.
I woke up panicked. The dream had been so vivid, so realistic it seemed like I had actually been there. My heart was racing and I knew something was wrong. It was hard to explain, but I was confident that something had happened to Snape.
"You knew…didn't you. About Granger." I hissed knowing there was no way such a big detail would get by him. He sighed quite used to my temper.
I was such an idiot. I was supposed to be making her bond with me, and here I was hitting her and letting her freeze to death on my very own property.
I for some reason assumed he wouldn't show up and that it was some sort of trick, but I saw his shadow by the lake, the moonlight reflecting off him just enough to see him.
Please wake up
“Granger, instead of flirting with your classmates, focus will you?” Snape said startling me out of my thoughts. I glared at him matching his rudeness easily.
“Then why would you give it me!” Dean said indignantly.
"You can't be alive. I watched you die." I said sure of what I saw. He sat down cool and relaxed, also going through the gifts for something to eat. He grabbed some caramel popcorn.
"Just a few things for Hagrid." I said wincing realizing he hadn't actually realized I got into his stores yet. He shook his head but thankfully didn't blow up.
"Oh dear. I think you need to grab the Headmaster, will you?" She asked Draco who left almost immediately. Poppy patted my shoulder confusedly, but tried to console me nonetheless.
“You still haven’t explained how you ended up like this.” The Headmaster said sitting down in the armchair, the stress showing on his old wrinkled features. I had noticed earlier that his hand was blackened, but I was silent. It looked dead and disgusting, generally only dark evil curses could do such a thing to someone. Snape coughed a bit clearing his throat getting my attention.
I watched him sleep and couldn’t help but smile at how non intimidating he was like that. He had made it a point to make my life hell for years, but the way he had gasped my name before collapsing had made that all seem like such a distant past.
"Yes, so one time Harry and I were fooling around in the room of requirement. We wanted to get lost so told the room that. Well, low and behold there's a room just for lost stuff. Including her diadem. It fell off a shelf during some of our...more physical moments." He said trailing off with a happy smirk at the end, innuendo full in his explanation. I didn't believe he would be so lucky to have just stumbled across something so important, but when we got to the room and he showed me the diadem, it was for sure Ravenna's.
“I can teach you.” He said. I was sure I misheard.
“I specifically said NO dark arts books Granger.” I snapped stalking to her intimidatingly. Her eyes widened at first in fear, but then she smiled a bit. My annoyance increased.
"Oh yes, I can feel him on you. My most trusted servant Severus. Bonded to an empath? I am truly the greatest that ever lived. With you at my disposal..." He trailed off watching me with admiration and pride.
Voldemort didn't try to kill him. He somehow seemed to know he wasn't strong enough. But I was.
"I have to go." I said leaving him alone in the darkness. Every irrational part of me wanted to run back to him and the safety he promised me, but I knew it was smoke and mirrors. A false mask just like the death eater mask he donned and just like his work as a teacher.
I wanted to get rid of the diadem, but there was never a time I could practice the fire spells without anyone else watching. Not to mention I needed the slytherin pocket watch back from Snape who I was currently ignoring.
“How am I a babysitter?” I asked as he sat across from me sipping his drink.
"Imagine my surprise the first time she responded to my thoughts in my mind. I thought she had learned some sort of wordless spell to read minds. Foolishness now looking back." I said tipping over a small magnetic contraption darkly annoyed at my own idiocy.
“Yes.” I admitted knowing I couldn’t deny it. I had felt very confident in myself, but something about him always made me nervous. I would be upset if he were mad at me for some odd reason.
“Then why yous has his magic Misses? House elves give their masters some of their magic to stay bonded with them. You want to bonded with Professor Snape.” He said earning himself a rush of whispers from the other house elves agreeing with him.
I wouldn’t be going with anyone again. Of course I would be alone, I always was. I had no time to socialize just trying to find a way to end a war that I didn’t want to exist and hoping I didn’t get kidnapped again for a madman’s amusement.
"She hates me." I said with absolute conviction. The Dark Lord chuckled sitting back down.
I was stunned by how the fuck he was alive, but I nodded numbly following his lead. I would fight until the death even if that was only minutes away.
He tilted my chin to look at me his fingers lingering on my face for just a moment longer than needed.
"Do you think they fired him?" Ron asked pointing to the empty seat at the head table, his mouth full of food like the hyena he was.
Harry would be so happy here. I could see him falling for the ruse easily seeing what he could never have. Even I felt a pang of envy realizing my own family had become so distant that I could hardly claim them as family. I couldn't just openly talk about Hogwarts with them having casual light hearted conversation. They had their life and I had mine. I was isolated in so many ways staying in the Wizarding world and the older I got, the most isolating it became.
“Think it’s rather lovely,” Harry says, low. Draco burns up with a flush, and Hermione stifles a giggle. “‘M not worried about it much.”
He knows that this is why one evening he and Harry go to bed and find their twin beds shifted into one king-size, soft, curtained heaven. Draco laughs at Harry’s complete bewilderment.
Somehow they end up in Malfoy’s little living room, on the couch under a throw. Malfoy had insisted they both strip down to their underwear, and now he lies on Harry’s chest, making patterns in his skin with his finger. Harry keeps getting a chill, and then Malfoy will put his palm down where it starts and Harry will be warm again.
“You just say that because you’re incapable of toning it down,” he says. Malfoy scoffs, runs a careless hand through his hair. He jerks his chin up and Harry stares at the long lines of his neck.
, Potter, and I’m saying you do as well, so you’d do well to take the compliment. I’m not one to just hand them out.”
“Yeah,” Harry says, not understanding the point. He’s okay, so long as Malfoy stays for a while.
“I know you do. He is quite something. Maybe you could drape your bed like a tent, with scarves and things, he likes that vintage Biba feel-”
the look.”
It was seeing Harry’s head in front of him, in the air, the breeze against Draco’s ears making a rushing sound, like fire, and everything coming crashing then in his chest, Draco says. And all he could do was reach for Harry.
“The- Merlin, Potter, don’t- get my dick back in your mouth, I’ll tour your fucking house later you arse.”
Harry is so comfortable and satisfied to his core that he falls asleep again and wakes up refreshed rather than even further muddled in the head. Draco is sleeping too when he wakes, and Harry leaves him to rest to go cast a
“I like you. I want you. I’m bonded to you, I mean,” Harry raises his brows meaningfully. Draco scoffs. “I like you. I-”
“I know, I know,” Draco mumbles. His fingers brush freezing to Harry’s stomach, bringing a gasp out of the bottom of his belly where he has touched him. “I know. I need you, Harry.”
“Me. And Luna. But it was all my idea, really. Commissioned her this room, and the bathrooms.”
Malfoy shifts in his seat, Harry can feel the bond shift along with him. He is hyper aware of it now, that buzzing feeling between them, on a plane he knows his magic to be on.
“Do you think we should invite Hermione over?” Draco asks once they are finished and sprawled across the tabletop. He is drawing circles on the wood with his finger. Harry watches his perfect fingernail and his sweet knuckle. “To tell her, I mean.”
“I do really like you, you know,” Harry says in a rare moment of feeling like he will die if he doesn’t say it. Malfoy blushes a bright red.
, like all their lives they’ve known each other. And they have. He knows Draco in a way that he will never know Sinistra, or Flitwick, will never know Sprout, who is set to retire after this one last year. Conversations with Draco are sometimes minefields, rife with bombs of
“Harry.” Draco speaks his name, voice cracking on the second syllable, into the pillow. The smell of Harry’s hair chokes him, male and deep and good. He found one of Harry’s long curls on the shoulder of his coat the other day. Harry’s fingers dig into his hips. “Hurry.”
and make an early dinner curry for the both of them. He starts another pot of coffee while he is in the kitchen and then marvels at how easy it feels to be with Draco. Only one day of this and he is already comfortable. It’s likely to do with how they had already been codependent, since that party at Luna’s, except he still thought that there was some kind of conflict bound to start up at every moment, then.
The look on Malfoy’s face makes the decision for him, once he is back to Grimmauld.
Draco raises his eyebrows in question. Harry laughs again, shakes his head. He takes Draco’s hands in his and apparates them into his front hallway.
As the time approaches, Harry dutifully sits in the hallway as Draco obsessively checks his eyeshadow in the hall mirror, insisting that it has the best lighting in the house, up until the moment Ron and Hermione arrive, with Ginny trailing behind them.
“Shut up, Potter. I mean I cannot be with someone who
Everyone comes fairly on-time, dressed in what Draco had written as being a Studio 54 theme. They all look lovely, and high, and Harry’s lips are soon sore from kissing everyone hello. He gets drunk in the welcome line, with everyone passing him one champagne flute after another, Draco by his side so warm and lovely, charming and on his best party behavior.
Draco moans, half from the pain of hearing him say it and half from his cock hardening against the sheets. He wants Harry so much, and it means it all to have him.
“It’s Harry,” he says. Draco closes his eyes. His long, pale lashes glint softly. “Do you want another cigarette?”
“Will you stay?” Harry asks, muffled. Malfoy nods. And it’s all the confirmation he ever needed. “Even if I am an eccentric?”
He isn’t so sure when he first called Malfoy
The kitchen is heavy, sticky with silence. The walls are black with shimmering blue pinstriped wallpaper, in the night. Potter uses his finger-flame to light his cigarette. Draco keeps watching. That hard pit in his stomach won’t go away. The night around them is winterfallen silence. The kind that is muffled further by the snow, dementor-snow, now. Heavy snow that is rare in London. Potter’s line of long black hair blocks half of his sharp face in waves, while the warm glow of the fireplace lights the other. Draco cups his hands around his teacup. His fingers are perpetually cold. The hot makes them sting. He does his best to contain a shiver.
“Yes, I. You were quite adamant.”
In the morning light, when he wakes up to read the letter again against his better judgement, he finds it easier to send off a casual response, reminding Malfoy that he can come to look at those shirts whenever he feels so inclined.
He is among the blue when he knows, instinctively, that Draco is flying up to him. Harry hovers in waiting. His heart pounding in his fingertips.
The two of them get roaring drunk as Harry watches happily from the couch. Draco turns up the music and tries to teach Hermione how to waltz, but she is so drunk that she ends up nearly destroying the coffee table again. She ends up sitting on the floor, hiccoughing as Draco acts out Puccini’s librettos from memory.
“Here we sit,” Malfoy says. Harry snorts, and waits. He knows more is coming, is so used to Malfoy’s casual theatrics by now. He watches Malfoy’s long fingers smooth over the wrinkle in the middle of the folded spine of the paper. “I mean, they’re all… the same. And we’re so different.”
know. I think I know her better than you do, just because I’m a Gemini and therefore better at psychoanalysis,” Draco offers. Harry laughs and stands to walk over and grip the collar of his pajama shirt. “What?”
But now, with Potter’s face in the firelight, it is silent but for their breathing. Draco’s eyes lift upwards to the ceiling. He can’t truly place where it is in the dark. Just pitch black, oblivion above their heads. The house swirling family magic in the spaces that they do not take up.
Harry pries and pries, digs through Draco’s Muggle music collection and makes him play Harry his favorites. Draco plays him
They start to take lunch together, once the both of them realize that they have the same lunch hour free. Draco mostly grades, and Harry reads. It’s sweet. Draco sometimes hums in an interested, impressed way at what Harry is reading. It makes Harry roll his eyes and flick him off.
first.
Malfoy swallows visibly, looks as if he is going to be sick. Harry nods, sighs, despite feeling marginally relieved by Malfoy’s assertion. He reckons they should just go to St. Mungo’s, then. Malfoy agrees solemnly.
“And leave my own welcome home party?”
Draco looks lovely in the snow. Snowflakes look like sparkles in his hair, on his scarf. His cheeks, nose, fingertips, and ears turn a deep, sweet red. Harry likes to watch him best when he comes in from outside, takes off his black scarf and fur hat. His long limbs are graceful even with heavy robes and wool draping them. Harry knows that Draco sees him looking, but he does nothing. Draco sometimes pushes out his lips when he is writing in red ink on a student’s paper, quirks his right eyebrow. Harry is charmed by him.
“Alright, but assume we’ll be picking this discussion up sometime before spring. Daphne has already had to take over Defense for two months because you’ve got cold feet, and she doesn’t mind it, but that’s just because she loves to work herself to death, you see.”
“He does not. Merlin, you sound like a teenager. Why don’t you just talk to him, tell him you like him? I’m too old to be playing wingman for you. You’ve done all of these lovely things with your life, you’ve lived abroad, you’d think you could just confront your reality at home as well.”
“I do like him,” he says. She pats him on the head.
“You absolute fuck,” Harry laughs.
“Well!” The healer says. She waves her wand and the diagnostic spell disappears. “You’ve got a perfectly healthy, natural soul bond here.”
They all eat slowly, drinking and toasting Draco and Harry so often Harry has whiplash from turning back and forth to opposite sides of the table. Ron makes a speech that lasts a few minutes too long, and Hermione is too drunk to bother pulling him back to his seat, simply stuffing her face into his hip and plugging her ears. Harry is embarrassed almost the whole time, so many people give him and Draco genuine well-wishes that it catches him entirely off-guard. He doesn’t know why he assumed it to be any different, but he is filled with love for all of them. Draco sometimes shrinks into his shoulder, turning and hiding his face behind Harry’s back in humiliation, but a hand on his pretty knee pulls him back to the party, simple as that. The bond seems to enjoy the attention and the sparks everyone keeps sending off with their wands at the end of each toast, for it is warm between them and growing thicker, more full of the cool, effortless magic Harry can feel as being Draco’s. His fingers tingle with it, and he chain smokes to soothe the feeling of being so in love it makes him on edge.
Malfoy has a dual energy where he seems to be totally willing to write to Harry and be civil in conversation, but sometimes he will snap right back to his old ways. It isn’t an easy medium between the two but a hard boundary that gives Harry whiplash. It seems random and inconsiderate. Malfoy is driven by himself and himself only. Harry’s only comfort is in that Malfoy seems to want him, for how often he writes back.
Harry dragged himself so he was sitting up, rubbing his eyes. He was trying to stay calm, but all of that was thrown out the window when harry twisted his head and saw a piece of paper placed delicately where Draco had been the night before.
The chosen boy had a rule; no matter how far things went with Draco, no matter how deep the other boy took him – he would not hurt over him. He wouldn’t let Draco break him.
That wasn’t something harry expected.
The ex-chosen one looked at his roommate like he had grown a second head, “Valentine's day?” Draco raised an eyebrow, “you know, love, candy, inflated importance.”
“I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry flexed his hands, “I mean, I am sorry. It’s just – I didn’t want,” he sighed, “I tried to help.”
It was a secret that burned differently from its former.
“Why are you taking your trousers off?” Harry's eyes bulged.
Once again Draco found him in an abandoned hallway; It felt all too familiar when Draco pushed him up against the wall, but instead of pressing his wand to the chosen one’s neck, he pressed his mouth against Harry's.
“Why does there have to be a point?” the Slytherin furrowed his eyebrows. “why can’t we just forget for a while?”
It was far too late; the sun had dipped under the valley as the rest of Hogwarts slept peacefully around him. Harry couldn’t sleep though – his mind running too fast and too far for him to dose off.
Harry chuckled, “I didn’t have a ring.”
“Thanks,” the raven-haired boy rolled his eyes, “I was so worried.”
“NO!” Harry screamed, pointing a finger at him, “no, if you’re coming in here your underwear stays on.”
“tragically,” harry slurred, pulling Draco out of his seat, “only for a com - companion on the walk.”
“I threw you your wand and suddenly every monstrous act help with is suddenly forgiven.”
“Why are you saying this shit?” harry pushed the other boy off him, standing up.
“you’re a prick.”
Harry cringed, realizing how much of an asshole he sounded like, “I’m sorry,” he leaned back. “I get it okay. I know what it's like to feel like you have to be what everyone says you are – that you have to live up to some impossible standard that was put on you.” He tried to smile, it didn’t feel right, “I’m the boy who lived.”
Harry pulled Draco so they were looking in each other’s eyes, “No one says who we are tonight.”
“so, it really should be ‘happy valentine’s day, let’s kill a priest.” Draco threw his arms in the air.
The dark-haired boy rolled his eyes, smiling. And yes, sometimes Draco purposely forgot about stupid muggle holidays to see that stupid cute face Harry made when he had to remind him.
Harry tried to remember the boy before him was his enemy, that hours ago he thought Draco was evil, pure cartoonishly evil. The chosen boy was rethinking all he knew about the death eater in front of him. Death eater? He was not like one of them; he was afraid. He was just a teenager – just like Harry was.
Draco waded over to where Harry was, kneeling so all the chosen one could see was him, “so I won’t be cruel this time.”
Harry threw his hands up, “you could be someone people root for.”
“could’ve fooled me by the way you’re shrinking into yourself.”
Harry waded towards him, “something?”
“Don’t,” Draco said, “don’t act like you fucking know me because we use to kiss when we were silly little kids.”
“Hi, Hagrid,” Harry called up to him, “how are you?”
?  No way, you’re taking the piss!”  Draco understood Ronald’s excitement.  Harry bloody Potter was sitting in the same compartment as them.
“What do you mean, Pansy’s obsessed with girls?”  Harry’s voice was dripping with careful confusion.
Draco was stunned.  “It’s
Draco hugged his mother one last time, holding tight for as long as possible before the first whistle of the train rang through that air.  His father made no motion to hug him, but nodded at him with a passive face.
Draco was still skeptical, and worried he would soon be pieces of wizard flotsam, but his father had already started counting
Slytherin first-years had a study period first, so Draco and Harry made their way to the library after breakfast with Theo and Pansy.  Draco listened as Pansy nagged Theo about whether he thought the Gryffindor or Hufflepuff sixth-year prefects were prettier.
“Brilliant!  We’ve got double Potions on Friday mornings!  What class are you looking forward to most?”
Someone tripped over the corner of a carpet and everybody laughed except Draco and Harry.  So this was how it was going to be, everybody looking out for themselves and nobody caring about what happens to their fellow Slytherins.  Just like home, except without Mother or Dobby to keep him company.
“GRYFFINDOR!”  Ron was smiling as he sat down next to his horde of brothers at the Gryffindor table.
get caught.  We want to win the House Cup this year, thank you very much.”  Higgs stepped back, apparently finished with his speech.
“Draco,” Lucius interjected, “the train is about to leave.  Hurry along now.”  Draco was far from surprised at his father’s lack of sadness over his leaving.  He never seemed to show any emotion besides anger.
“Ronald Weasley!”
“Do you really have the scar?”  Ronald’s eyes were full of wonder.  Draco bristled at the boy’s lack of tact in the presence of a celebrity.
“Gather ‘round, children!” Higgs shouted across the common room, his hands cupping the sides of his mouth.
Harry’s face went red and he looked at his feet.  “That’s all I’ve got,” he mumbled.  Draco could see in the way Harry wrung his hands together that he was embarrassed at how little he possessed.
“Now, this is probably our most important House rule; Whatever you decide to get up to, whatever rules you choose to break, absolutely do
After stuffing his face with copious amounts of eggs, sausage, toast, pancakes, and puddings, Draco looked at Harry’s plate.  There was a half-eaten sausage and a slice of dry toast with one bite taken out of it sitting in front of him.
“It’ll be alright Mother, I’ll be coming home for Christmas.  The time will fly by, it’ll be as if I never left.”  His words seemed to reassure her a bit, because she stopped crying.  For now, at least.  Draco sat again, scarfing down the delicious treats.  His mother may not be the best cook most of the time—hence the army of House-Elves, but her pumpkin pasties were amazing.
“I didn’t –“ harry wiped his palm over his face, trying to articulate himself. “I don’t think we’re doing anything, Draco. I just thought maybe we weren’t enemies anymore.”
“so, do you have a lesson planned for the valentine day.”
Draco didn’t look up from his parchment, “whatever curse he could think of first.”
Draco’s brow furrowed, “why do you need cards?”
War, war, war.
well,” the former chosen one said, “the origins of valentine’s day are a bit too… mature… for a bunch of 9-year olds.”
The Slytherin made space between the two, saying, “and I’m the prick.”
Harry didn’t look up from his arts and crafts when he said out of the blue, “It’s valentines’ day in a few days.”
Harry nodded, “if you’re going to use me,” Harry said, frowning, “at least have the decency to not remind me how much you despise me.”
Draco snorted, “well now we have one, so what’s the point of dancing around.”
Draco stopped Harry from walking, using his shoulders to balance himself, “I should have fought with you,” he dug his fingers into the fabric of the other boy’s shirt, “I should have stayed with you.”
“all of it,” Draco whispered, moving so they were close again.
It didn’t work, it never worked.
“I know it was you who told Dumbledore I was in the forbidden section.”
The blonde boy watched him closely, wading so he was in the middle of the bathtub, “when did I say I did.”
The dark-haired boy's breathe became shallow and short as his brain raged. He couldn’t think straight – couldn’t collect himself enough to stop himself from screaming through a clenched jaw.
Because of him, because of him, because of him.
He wasn’t going to -
“forget what?”
“scared, potter?” Draco finally said when he got his beer.
The blonde thought for a moment, “nope, nothing.”
“I should have known this was a fucking bad idea,” Draco looked at him like he was nothing, and at that moment, Harry believed it. “and it’s over.”
Without a second thought, Harry dunked his head under the water and let out a mangled scream.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered, “I’m sorry for everything I did.”
Draco took a breath, closing his eyes, “that’s all we’ll ever be.”
Draco gripped at his boxers.
Harry perked up, always ready to go off about muggle history, “well, some historians think it was adapted from the pagan ritual Lupercalia, which was a festival all about animal sacrifice and sex. So, if we were to celebrate properly, we’d be running around naked and killing goats.”
“yeah.”
Draco pushed him further into the wall, “you’re putrid.”
Draco brought the drink to his mouth, “Yeah, I heard. I also heard you’re the reason I’m a free man.”
He wasn’t going to do it. He wasn’t going to do it.
“Oh! Like that dress-up holiday, you told me about.”
Draco looked at him, clearly not all there. “yeah,” he mumbled, “turns out that kinda magic is hard to undo.”
He finally said, “I wish I’d let you save me.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “it would help if you were actually funny.”
All it said was sorry, potter.
“who better than someone who doesn’t care what you say.”
He needed someone to acknowledge the truth, no matter how bitter it was.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed, his silence weighing.
“Darling,” Draco drawled, trying to sound sarcastic, “if you were going to propose, you didn’t have to break out the ribbon.”
“what?”
Harry looked at the other boy, who was only wearing a t-shirt and pajama bottoms – with his arms exposed the chosen one could clearly see his mark. A tattoo on his forearm that proved who he belonged to, who he was loyal to.
Draco watched him for what felt like hours, and Harry could feel the burn of tears in the back of his eyes. The blonde reached his hand out, hovering it over Harry’s shoulder. Their skin didn’t touch, but the black-haired boy found some sort of comfort in the closeness. It felt strange.
Harry watched the other boy fidget in his seat, and asked, “does it matter?”
“you had one rule, chosen boy.” He whispered to himself.
So, harry spent most of his nights at the hog’s head’s bar, drinking and trying to forget – even if it was just for a moment – what was expected of him.
“no to asking or no to sleeping?” Draco took a long sip from his coffee.
Harry smacked them away, sitting up so the two boys were properly staring at one another. “and you care because?”
“Love,” Draco said like it was nothing, “infatuation, tenderness, feelings.”
Both boys were silent after that, Harry’s heart racing as fast as his mind was.
“fuck ‘em, you need academic integrity.”
“yeah.”
The Blonde rolled his eyes, placing the larger sized mug next to the teacher’s knee, going to sit on the floor in front of him.
“no, I thought valentine was like – some dead dude. Why is he your dead dude?”
“yes, he does, don’t you get it? We have rolls to play – the hero, and the villain. I can’t choose not to be the bad guy.”
Harry thought of everyone he loved, everyone who took him in even though they knew who he was – what could happen to them just for caring for him. Harry pounded his fist against his head. If he fails, they’ll die.
Harry chuckled, “you’re not very scary Draco.”
The chosen boy tried so hard to keep his secret, but it came crashing down like Harry always knew it would. No secret can hold forever.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, “okay.”
“Do I even have to ask if you’ve slept?” he didn’t.
“Nothing, Draco,” Harry sighed, “it’s a stupid joke.”
“Cool. I don’t really care.”
This isn’t how this was supposed to be.
The war was over, and despite how Harry thought it would play out, he was alive. He was alive and had no idea what he would do next; he didn’t think he would get this far. People wanted him to be an Auror – he was the savior of the wizarding world, of course, people wanted him to be the one to protect them. Harry didn’t know if that was what he wanted though; he had spent his whole childhood fighting (even when he didn’t want to) he couldn’t imagine spending the rest of his life fighting too.
He wasn’t allowed to be a kid anymore though; he knew that all too well. Even if he didn’t choose this life, he had to bear it, if he didn’t people could die because of him.
Harry ignored the flutter deep in his gut, and laughed, “and you’re vile, what’s your point?”
He didn’t need confrontation now.
The dark-haired boy bit his lip, “well, yeah, but I feel like the PTA would be a bit cross with me if I said that.”
“you think your clever, potter?” Draco growled.
“Oh, yes I am.”
“tell me about it,” Harry said, scratching at his forehead.
“that’s just another way of saying yes.”
he could feel Draco inhale, the other boy staring at him with such an intensity Harry was afraid he was going to hex him.
The chosen boy floated forward, placing his hands on the edge of the bath so Draco was trapped between his arms; and before he lost his nerve, he swooped his mouth down to Draco’s. he could feel the blonde hesitating, fearing. He pushed his mouth against his harder, prodding at his lips with his tongue until Draco opened up, kissing back with the same force.
Harry scoffed, “your mark says you do care.”
“This is strange,” Harry said, carding his fingers through the other boy’s hair.
“why were you screaming?” Draco asked, very much not going away.
“Vent,” Harry repeated, “to you?”
“I – I can’t deal with your cruelty tonight,” Harry tried to ignore the tremor in his voice, “seriously just go.”
Harry leaned forward too, to the point their noses were brushing, “and yet you don’t let me tell you who you are.”
Harry kept his eye on the Slytherin, his mind racing. He wasn’t going to tell Draco his fears, was he? He didn’t trust Draco even slightly, and he certainly didn’t trust him with his thoughts on he who can’t be named. He hates you, harry had to remind himself, he doesn’t care if you are hurting. But maybe that was why he should tell him – because he doesn’t care. It wouldn’t be like with Ron or Hermione, who would lie over and over again. Saying they would be fine, saying everything would end up okay, saying he was strong.
“maybe,” Harry said, “out there you can’t but right now, you’re just Draco, and I’m just Harry. No one gets to say who we are tonight.”
“what are you scared of?”
He shrugged, “doesn’t everyone?” Draco chuckled, “no one wants to be the bad guy.”
Until one night when Harry was sneaking out to get some air. The weeks of Draco’s silence was getting to him, and no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it, he missed Draco’s annoying presence every day.
Harry dug his nails into his skin, grounding himself with the pain. He wasn’t a soldier, he knew that, he was just a kid.
The Slytherin stared at him for a second, and for the life of him, Harry couldn’t see what was going on behind the grey. Without warning, Draco stripped his shirt off.
Harry took in a sharp inhale of breath, running his hands over his face to try and get that thought out of his head. He slapped his fingers against his cheek as hard as he could in an attempt to keep himself present.
“what do you think your father would say if he could see us now?”
“the what?”
“Eh.” Draco shrugged, “I’ve been in Hogsmeade a lot lately.”
“so that is why you’re upset?” the blonde boy said listlessly, “you know who?”
“oh.” Draco’s heart sped.
“you were just a kid, Draco. A kid who had his entire life decided for him by people he trusted, and you were brave enough to walk away.”
Draco rushed forward, pressing one hand to Harry’s mouth, the other on the back of his head. “have you lost your mind?”
But it was true, his mind argued, if you don’t win that means you know who does.
“I’m not embarrassed,” the Gryffindor scoffed, hoping his cheeks didn’t look as hot as they felt, “I’m repulsed.”
But it still burned.
“you have a funny way of showing it.”
“names have power,” the blonde leaned forward, whispering, “boy who lived.”
Draco put down his assignment, crawling up to harry until they were nose to nose. The chosen one lifted his head up to kiss him, but Draco pulled away before he could. There was a look in his eye that Harry couldn’t pinpoint, and Harry didn’t like it. “don’t make this out to be something it’s not.”
Harry tugged his bottom lip in between his teeth, “I couldn’t save everyone though.”
“Do you want to be forgiven?” the thought had never crossed the chosen boy's mind, that this person he had built up in his mind as everything he hated – wanted to be good.
“Go on then,” the chosen boy whispered, scrubbing his hands over his face, “why are you here?”
Harry chucked a paper bag into a pile of identical paper bags, reaching for glitter. “well, the kids love it. It's basically an excuse to eat candy for them.”
the barrier, you’re going to go
“Who’s that?” Harry whispered to Draco.
“Gather around, children!  The sorting ceremony will begin soon!”  There was an old witch in emerald green robes standing at the top of the stairs.
Draco was sitting close enough to Harry to feel the heat radiating from his face, though Draco thought he did a fine job of disguising his discomfort at being singled out.
The Slytherin common room and dorms were located in the dungeons below the Great Lake.  Looking around on their way down the corridors, Draco saw that every other student his year was shivering from the cold, damp air, and was obviously afraid of Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.  A tall man, he towered above the mass of eleven-year-olds.  He had a hooked nose, almost beak-like, set between two dark eyes.  His hair was chin-length, and black as night.  Draco could see how this man could intimidate people, but Draco had known the professor his whole life.  Draco couldn’t be afraid of his own godfather, after all.
“Would you like to sit with us?”  Harry began cleaning his candy wrappers off the bench next to him, but the girl cut him off:
Dumbledore recounted a list of rules and restrictions that the students needed reminding of, and Draco couldn’t help but notice that the man’s voice was gentle and kind.  The real Albus Dumbledore was nothing like the picture Father had painted of him; overweening, decrepit, corrupt.  He seemed more like a friendly grandfather.
Mother placed one platter of pumpkin pasties in front of Draco, and another in front of Father.  He gave her a curt nod and folded up his newspaper.
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle and tell Harry under his breath, “Theo and Pansy and I have known each other our whole lives.  Our fathers are all friends, so we were always together while they were in meetings at the Manor.  They’re the same as they’ve always been; Pansy is obsessed with girls and Theo is obsessed with books.”  He cast a fond glance at his friends’ backs and turned to see a quizzical look on Harry’s face.  “What?” he asked.
“I guess I did, I just never thought about it much.  Aunt Petunia grumbled a lot about ‘filthy homosexuals’, now I think about it.”  Harry’s face became thoughtful again.  “So it’s not a bad thing, then? I mean, they can get married and stuff?”
like?  Do they really keep their food in big boxes with fake ice?”  Draco had a million questions about Muggles just waiting to be answered.  He’d always wanted to know how Muggles got along without magic, but Father would never have approved of his interests.
“I want to be in Gryffindor,” Ronald said, “that’s the house the rest of my family has always been in, it’s the best one.”
“Oh, Draco, I’ll miss you so much.  I want you to write me as soon as you get a chance.  Use your new owl, alright?” She blew her nose into a tissue that she got from her purse.
The boats were, for lack of a better word, magical.  They glided across the lake without a paddle or a guide, and if Draco squinted, he was sure he could see the mermaids and grindylows beneath the surface of the water.  Turning a corner, Draco felt all the air rush out of his lungs.  Rising into the night sky above him was the most magnificent thing he had ever laid eyes on.  The castle was massive; the turrets pierced the clouds.
There were even more people on the platform than he could have imagined.  Parents saying goodbye to their children for the last time until maybe June, first years and younger siblings staring wide-eyed at the magnificent train, older students catching up with the friends they hadn’t seen since June, and a group of professors chatting amongst themselves.
“Yeah, but I was just a baby.  I didn’t know what I was doing!  I want to know how to protect myself, you know?”
Draco could hear the other first years whispering to each other, and Ronald’s voice rose above the others’.  “Fred and George told me that nasty thing’s got a penchant for biting you on the head when McGonagall puts it on you.  They said the test is about how you handle the bite.”  Draco sure hoped that wasn’t true.
“Raised by
Higgs grumbled something about first years technically still being children while Farley rolled her eyes and got up to stand next to him.
Harry scanned his schedule again before he answered, “Defense Against the Dark Arts sounds interesting, and I guess Potions will be cool, right?  Since it’s our Head of House teaching it.”
“’Course they can!  Why wouldn’t they?”
“Right,” Gemma started.  “Welcome to the first Slytherin First-Year meeting.  I’m Gemma Farley and this is Terence Higgs, we’re two of your prefects this year.  We’re here to go over what it means to be Slytherin and our code of conduct.  Higgs, do you want to start us off?”  Gemma looked like she knew what his answer would be, and nodded at him when he declined.
“It’s just… you know there isn’t a single Slytherin who didn’t go bad.”
“Yeah, why?”  Now Draco was the confused one.  Did Harry think there was something wrong with that?  How odd.
“Boys’ dormitories are down the hall to the left, girls’ to the right.  You will know which is yours when you see the plaque outside with your year.  Bathrooms are located off each dormitory.  Anybody caught trying to sneak into the other gender’s dormitories will be assigned one week of detention with me, and I can assure you that it will be unpleasant.  Goodnight.”  Snape flicked his hair out of his face and walked away, leaving the students to find their rooms.
“ALL FIRS’-YEARS OVER ‘ERE, NOW!  COME ON, OVER HERE!”  As Draco stepped off the train at Hogsmeade station, he saw the giant of a man yelling for the first years.  Ronald, Harry, and Draco made their way over to him, shouldering their way through clusters of older students and to the right of the line of lanterns delineating the split between the first-year and upper-year paths.
“Father!  Have you lost it?  I can't run at a brick barrier, that’s ludicrous!”
, of course.  Haven’t you read it yet?  It was on the supplies list.”  Draco didn’t like the mordant tone of her voice.
“Splendid.  Now, who here knows the four traits attributed to Slytherin House?  Potter?”  Gemma looked at Harry expectantly.
“I would first like to welcome our new first-year students to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  At this school, you children will hone your mental acuity, multiply your magical prowess, and, most importantly, you will make the best friends of your life.  You will learn to cast spells by perfecting the nuances of spoken magical word.  Now, I know the ramblings of an old man only serve to enervate you young folk, but I ask that you hear me out for just a moment longer.  I would like to remind you all that the third-floor corridor is out of bounds…”
The train was even larger on the inside than Draco thought it could possibly be.  He walked down the aisle looking for a place to sit.  Near the end of the train, he came across an empty seat next to a funny looking pair of boys.  One had thick black hair and strikingly green eyes, his rounded spectacles taped in the middle.  Draco thought he must be a Muggleborn, since he was wearing funny-looking blue trousers.  The other, Draco gleaned, was a Weasley; ginger hair, hand-me down robes, spellotaped-up secondhand wand, and a pet rat.
“All unpacked already, Harry?  Where’s all your stuff?  Your pictures and things.” he asked.  Harry’s shelf next to his bed had a few sets of neatly folded school clothes and some textbooks on them, but there were no books or photos anywhere on his desk or side table.
Draco’s heart hurt a little at Harry’s words.  As much as he didn’t like Father most of the time, he couldn’t imagine not having him or even any photos of him.  He silently resolved himself to finding a photo of Harry’s parents for him, and decided he would send Mother an owl soon to ask if she could help.
By now it was already three o’clock, and they would be arriving at Hogsmeade station in about three hours.  The boys had been speaking for hours and were becoming fast friends.  Harry was  a peculiar boy.  He had grown up with Muggles, and had no idea about anything that went on in the wizarding world.  It was quite funny when he opened his first chocolate frog.  Potter gave a little yelp when it jumped out of the package and out the window, and again when his Dumbledore card began speaking to him.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said.  “The Dursleys don’t like me very much, so I don’t have any photos with them—not that I would want them, anyway.  I don’t much like them either—and I don’t have any photos of Mum and Dad.”
His father had warned him about families like the Weasleys, poor purebloods, and blood-traitors, at that.  He said they were bad company.  Draco would be damned if he let his father incarcerate him in the pusillanimous traditions of pureblood families.  He knocked on the doorframe of their compartment.
“Of course we’re in the same room, Harry.  We’re both first-years.  Is there warm water in the showers?”
“With my luck, I’ll end up in Slytherin.”  Harry pointed to his scar.  “That was Voldemort’s house.  Big surprise,” he obviously hadn’t been surprised by this.  Draco might have been a bit offended by the Slytherin comment had he not been taken aback by Harry’s use of the Dark Lord’s name.
“Draco!  Come and stand close to me now, we wouldn’t want you getting lost and missing the train,” Father called to him from behind.  Draco was excited to see the platform.  He had never been before.
“Right, any questions, then?” Gemma looked expectantly at the crowd of eleven-and-twelve-year-olds sprawled across the couches in front of her.
Draco jumped, eyes widening.  “Not Ravenclaw!  Please!  I’ve got to be in Slytherin, like Father and Mother and Aunt Bella and—”
Harry was quiet for a moment, and then his eyes went wide.  “So, if girls can fancy girls, does that mean…”
At the end of class, Flitwick awarded five points to Harry for “paying close attention to the lecture”.
Harry smiled at him, said “Sure,” and stood up, offering a hand to help Draco up.
Draco nudged Harry with his elbow.  “Harry, mate, eat up.  You’re skin and bones.  Come on, nobody’s stopping you.”  Draco scooped a heap of eggs and a couple of slices of bacon onto Harry’s plate.  Harry looked embarrassed again, but after a minute he started eating more.
“Thank you, Mother, these are my favourite.”  Draco stood up and hugged his mother tightly.  He would miss her so much.
“Draco, darling, wake up,” were the first words he heard that morning.  They were the first words he heard every morning, the comforting voice of his mother waking him from his long recumbent periods.  He would miss her, he knew.
“I suppose…. Anyway, Snape’s my godfather and he’s taught me some potions already.  Partner with me and I bet we’ll be top in our year.”  Draco liked being able to offer something to Harry.  He would be making Father proud.  The little nagging voice in the back of his head reminded him of his vow to himself not to play into Father’s expectations of him, but he pushed it down for now.
Harry shook his head.  “No.  Mum was Muggleborn.  Does that make me Half-Blood?  She was still magic, not Muggle, so would it be more like five-eighths?  Either way, Mum’s sister and her husband raised me after Mum and Dad… you know.”  Harry’s face fell at the end of his sentence, and Draco felt his gut twist.  He hadn’t known Harry for very long, but he knew he never wanted to see that look on Harry’s face again.
“Potter!  You said the Dark Lord’s name!”  Draco’s eyes were wide with surprise.
”  Daphne immediately stopped whispering to the girl next to her and looked down, blushing at being called out.
Draco reluctantly dragged himself out of bed one limb at a time, and walked across the cold stone floor to his bathroom.  That’s the way the Malfoy Manor was, a bastion so large that every bedroom had its own bathroom.  He had lived there his whole life, all eleven years, and he was sure there were parts he hadn’t seen.
When Draco opened his eyes and sat up on the first day of classes, Harry was already sitting on the end of his bed, fully dressed.
As he walked up to the stool, Draco’s heart pounded in his throat.  He sat down, facing the dining hall.  Everyone’s eyes were on him.  The Sorting Hat was placed on his head, and Draco heard a voice in his mind.  “Ah, a Malfoy, eh?  And the heir to House Black, as well.  Your families have been in Slytherin for hundreds of years, you know.  All except your mother’s cousin, of course.”  The hat paused for a moment, then continued its rambling.  “You’ve a fecund mind, young Draco.  You would do well in Ravenclaw—”
“No reason.  Just curious, I guess.”  Draco would have to check tomorrow morning.  For now, he was knackered. “Let’s go to our room.  I’m so tired I could sleep for a week.”
“Sod off, Goyle.  He just packs light, right Harry?  Less rubbish to distract him from school.”  Draco didn’t want Harry to feel bad about not having much stuff.  He made a silent promise to himself to bring it up later, though, when the whole dorm wasn’t listening.
“You mean she fancies girls?” Harry whispered after settling into the seat across from Draco.
After they left the greenhouses, Harry told Draco he didn’t much feel like going to dinner.  Draco would hear nothing of the sort.  “You have to eat, Harry.  We can go back to the common room after, though.  Just come eat with me first, yeah?  I reckon everyone in our year’s going to rush down to be early for the meeting anyways.”
“The picture’s talking!  Where’d it go?  He just up and walked away!”
“I read about it in
“Harry, you know him?  How?”  Ronald was stupefied.
“I suppose we’re about to find out,” Draco whispered, still giddy over his own and Harry’s Sortings.
“Harry Potter!” McGonagall called.  The room went dead silent at Harry’s name.  He sat on the stool, his eyes locked with Draco’s.  He smiled, probably at something the hat had said inside his head, nodded, and the hat called out, “SLYTHERIN!”
Draco snorted, “Harry, you of all people
“Potter,” Harry mumbled.
“It’s huge!”  Ronald’s voice was shrill, his expression bewildered.
was something else entirely.  The castle was massive.
“We do not run to professors about the things our Housemates get up to.  We
Their room was amazing.  The beds were half the size of Draco’s bed at the manor, but he didn’t care.  They were all four-posters done up with green quilts and heavy drapes, and next to each was a small end table and a desk.  The six beds were separated by windows that looked into the lake.  Draco sat down on his bed and laid down on top of the covers.  He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, still in his robes and trainers.
Harry scrunched his nose, “what is it not?”
Draco didn’t actually tell Harry where they were going, just stumbled out of the pub, and started walking down the street with the raven-haired boy following him like a puppy.
Draco saw him though, sliding into the chair next to him and whistling at the bartender to get him a beer. Harry couldn’t breathe, he felt like he did when he was a child, downing his drink to give him something to do while his mind raged between his ears.
Harry tried to keep the feelings that burned in him to himself. He knew there was a shame to it, not just because Draco was a boy, but because he was Draco. Shitty, self-absorbed, evil Draco. He was not someone who held a high status in the chosen boy’s head; but that didn’t stop the blonde from being in his head. all. The. Damned. Time.
Harry leaned against the bar, not making eye contact with the blonde in front of him, “we won, Draco. We don’t have to fight anymore.”
There was something in the way Draco said it that made the Gryffindor not believe him. He didn’t know how that seated with him.
Draco Malfoy. Harry’s first crush, whether his adolescent mind was willing to admit it at the time or not. He was snarky, sarcastic, and far too dramatic for young harry to deal with – and he was all the teen thought about at night.
Harry had built an army too after that, which was the weirdest part. He was preparing for war, just like his enemy was. Because the war was coming.
“I think the kids and I are just going to stick to handing out Valentine's day cards and eating candy in class.”
“what in fucking Merlin.”
Draco smiled, “are you propositioning me, potter?”
“huh?”
“what are you doing?” Harry shouted.
Draco sighed, pulling away from him, “I – I’m scared too.”
“I was hoping maybe I could convince you to be on my side instead.”
The two boys avoided each other for weeks after that, and the chosen boy almost preferred it that way, no matter how strange it felt. Harry waited for Draco to tell the whole school what happened in the hallway, too mock him, too sneer at him. It never came, though; Draco didn’t seem to acknowledge the fact that Harry existed at all. The chosen boy didn’t know how to feel about that. For so long he wanted Draco to just leave him alone, even if in the back of his mind he reveled in the attention he got from the other boy. But now, Draco’s eyes on him, Harry felt wrong – like a part of his world had crumbled away overnight.
Draco resting his head in his hand, listening to his dork roommate ramble about things Draco didn’t know anything about with such enthusiasm it made the blonde want to learn.
“I hate you.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “So I’m not going to win the beauty pageant?”
“You still have your mark.”
Harry followed suit, and soon the tension between the two boys faded into drunk reminiscing. They laughed and talked about Hogwarts and their lives before and after until the bar rang its last call.
“I think that’s all you are.” Harry spat.
The marauder's map came in handy sometimes, no matter how petty the cause.
Draco was gripping desperately at the cups of coffee in his hands, trying not to drop them from sheer shock. The living room floor was covered in red paper hearts and pink strings, and in the middle of the mess was his roommate, Harry potter – an extraordinary 4th-grade history teacher, who looked like he hadn’t slept at all.
They didn’t kiss like teenagers anymore; both more aware of where to put their lips and their hands. The two men melded their actions together into a rhythm. They should be stumbling more, harry thought, they hadn’t done this in years – they shouldn’t fit together this well.
“No, I couldn’t.” Draco yelled, “my family, my mark, proves I can’t.”
“I have to do something,” he breathed, “If I don’t, he’ll kill my family, he’ll kill my mother.”
Draco laughed, “no need to be embarrassed, potter.”
And one-night Harry swore he saw a ghost.
Harry laughed between drinks of coffee, using his foot to kick Draco in the knee.
He wouldn’t let Draco get to him, he couldn’t.
“You seem upset,” Draco said, taking some of the bubbles and flicking them at the other boy.
He didn’t answer, instead of ordering a shot.
Again, he thought, rubbing his hand against the stubble of his chin, he let that boy pull him in again just to shatter him.
“Something,” Draco nodded, his gaze wouldn’t meet the raven-haired boy. “Unforgivable.”
After that, the two boys kept a different secret. A secret that hid in towers and the room of requirement. A secret he shared with another through glances and inside jokes while the rest of the world watched – and when no one watched a secret the two boys reveled in.
“Draco,” Harry tried.
the two had moved into a tiny old two-bedroom after Harry had finished university, though it had worked in both of their favors financially, Draco was starting to see the holes in their living arrangement. When Draco doesn’t hate Harry, he rather fancies him.
They’ll die, they’ll die, they’ll die.
He couldn’t think, so out of instinct he slammed his lips against the other boys, ignoring how Draco’s wand pressed into the vein in his neck. Harry didn’t know how long their lips touched. a second? Maybe two? Before Draco pushed him away, a look of shock on his face.
Harry was unraveling.
“You are not coming in here!”
Without thinking, Harry banged his fist against his head, muffling the frustration he felt. “why are you even fucking here?”
“Okay,” the blonde drawled out, “I’m lost again.”
“Seriously? It’s everywhere right now.”
“Yes,” Draco said, scraping his teeth against Harry’s pulse, “but we can deal with that later.”
He knew why he couldn’t sleep, even if he was trying to ignore it as best as possible. His scar throbbed. Proof of his connection to a monster that was still out there – that was rebuilding his army. When his scar ached, it sent his mind and body into a panic.
“Harry?”
Draco smiled faintly, “No one but us.”
“Valen-what?”
“someone does, Vold-”
Harry furrowed his brow, “Yeah, uh, that’s probably for the best.”
Draco smiled, “Oh, I love mature, do tell.”
“will you – uh – will you be my valentine?” Draco couldn’t breathe. Wait, shit, he really wasn’t breathing.
He could tell Draco wasn’t expecting that, taking a pregnant pause before saying, “so maybe we should dance around a few things.”
“Why do I put up with you?” the blonde practical screamed.
“Halloween.”
Draco was going to jump out the window. “sorry that was – I shouldn’t have said – I don’t want you to be – “
“it’s so easy to say that when what you did was save the world.”
“How would I know you were in the forbidden section,” Harry challenged, “it’s forbidden.”
Harry shot out of the water, whipping his eyes to see Draco standing in front of the bath staring at him as if he’d grown a second head. The chosen boy pated his shoulder; no, still just one.
Draco dipped his arms under the water, crossing them, and floating back so he was leaning against the other side of the tub.
Harry didn’t give him a chance to find his thoughts, chasing after him only to stop short of pressing his chest to Draco’s. he didn’t know what he was doing, he wasn’t thinking. “is it okay if I -?”
“what are you doing?”
It sometimes dawned on Draco that this interaction – this life – was supposed to be weird. Back at Hogwarts, if you had told him he would end up here, in an enchanted flat in a muggle city, roommates with his former (sometimes it felt like current) nemesis, he would have laughed, or groaned dramatically about needing the dementor’s kiss in the instant.
“He hates me.” Harry fiddled with his fingers. He had completely abandoned his essay.
“feelings,” Harry echoed.
The kissing soon turned into scattered pecks in between breaths, Draco pressing his mouth against Harry’s neck.
It wasn’t a ghost though; it was Draco Malfoy. Harry didn’t expect to see him at Hogsmeade; Harry didn’t expect to see him anywhere, really – the Malfoy’s had left England after the war, and after Lucius was put in Azkaban.
He could feel it in his shaky breath as he eased himself into the bath he’d drawn.
“I’m into it.”
“what the hell did you do to the living room?”
“it doesn’t matter anymore now,” Harry whispered, without thinking pulled Draco closer, “what we did doesn’t matter anymore.”
And if you know who won – If he lost -
There are somethings in life we cannot escape; heartache is one of them. And heartache had a way of fallowing Harry through life like a ghost. No matter how far he ran, no matter how hard he fought – Harry Potter was haunted. And nothing haunted him quite like Draco Malfoy.
Draco frowned, shoving at his chest, “I’m not – you’re not. I’m not afraid of you.”
“why would you do that?”
They weren’t at Hogwarts anymore, though, the war was over and done and left the scars it was going to, and the two boys had fallen into their living situation more by necessity than want. Both were freshly out of school and sick of the magical world and all it left in its wake, a shaky but confident friendship growing between the two. But unlike Draco, who kept one foot in the wizarding world, Harry left with no intention of going back.
“if I don’t, who will.”
“mmm, yes, tragic.”
And what brought him the most stress was the fact that despite what everyone was telling him, he knew his enemy was out there, he had seen it with his own eyes. He watched Cedric Diggory die to him.
“Yeah. But these kids are like 9 so putting romantic pressure on them is stupid and creepy so hence just candy and cards.”
The fidgety boy didn’t want to deal with this right now.
“you worry too much, Draco,” Harry said with a smile.
And then Draco lunged forward again and pressed their lips together in a frenzy.
Harry rubbed at his eyes, “where are you staying?”
“If I fail. If I – die,” Harry said, “everyone I love dies. I can’t – I can’t win though, he’s too powerful and I’m – I’m just me. How could I stop him?”
