“I...I mean I think that sounds like the best plan we’ve come up with so far, but why do all of you have to be involved?” Hermione and Neville glared a little, but Draco hadn’t meant to be insulting. “Not that I want you specifically not involved, it’s just that the less people who go, the less risky it is.”
“No,” Draco said. “Our date went fairly well but we really haven’t talked about our relationship since. Things have been really crazy with my family so I don’t think he wanted to bring up anything.”
Sure enough, a few minutes later the door opened and Bill Weasley ducked to enter the kitchen. Draco tried to focus on his wild hair rather than the scars that ran across his face. Fleur Delacour entered shortly after, wearing a loose sweater. There were grins and hugs, and even some tears on the part of Molly Weasley. Draco felt a lump in his throat and looked down, embarrassed. The air was heavy with love, and Draco wasn’t used to the chaos or the warmth. Harry kicked him under the table. “You’ll get used to it,” he said quietly and with a soft smile.
Draco was loathe to speak right now, but his curiosity got the better of him. “I did always wonder how in the world you lot managed to get into the Department of Mysteries as fifteen year olds.”
I think people bash on Ron way too much—he just seems aggressive at times because he’s so loyal to Harry! Anyway, I think this part of the story only has a few chapters left. I’m going to end this part of the series once they officially get together, which will likely be soon! Let me know if there’s anything you want to see and what you think.
Ron looked at Harry for a long while. Then his gaze switched over to Draco. “Harry tells me you’re trying to be a better person,” he said, as if Draco hadn’t been sitting there while Harry was talking to him. “But what exactly are you trying to do here?”
His main concerns were two. His first was the upcoming holidays. He was going to home to both of his parents since his father was no longer required to go back to Azkaban. Draco had some apprehension about seeing his father again. The visit at St. Mungo’s had not gone well. Lucius had been openly hostile, and he claimed that he knew a secret about Draco. Did Lucius know about Draco’s relationship with Harry? It wouldn’t surprise Draco, but what did surprise him was the fact that Lucius had not taken any action against it. Certainly that would change over the break. Harry also seemed to want Draco to visit the Burrow with him, which is where the Weasley family dwelled. Draco knew that they were a part of Harry’s family, but he wasn’t sure he could stomach a dinner with people he had insulted every chance he got only a year or two prior.
“Right, but I was with you. We were all with you. If you had gotten caught, we could have helped you, and at least I would have gotten caught with you.”
The Manor house elf, Tilly, was busy making a breakfast Draco knew he would not eat. When Draco’s family returned home after the Battle of Hogwarts, Tilly was the only Manor house elf that had not ran away. The Dark Lord had enslaved the creatures, not Lucius, and so when their master died they were not magically bound to the Manor. He wasn’t sure why Tilly stayed behind when the others left, and he didn’t have nearly as much interaction with her as he did with Dobby. He wasn’t even sure his old house elf and playmate had survived after Aunt Bellatrix...and afterward...
“Alright, we don’t have to talk about it today. But I’m serious, it’s the only thing that helps. I was on a huge downward spiral this summer until I opened up. So whether it’s with me, your friends, your Mind Healer—anyone. You need to talk about it.”
“Shut up, all of you!” Greg finally spoke up, jerking Draco to attention. “Just...shut up.” Daphne patted Greg’s arm.
Draco nodded. “Alright,” Blaise put his hands on his knees. “Let’s get some lunch. And yes, you’re coming, Draco.”
Potter looked regretfully at him. “No, that’s not what I mean at all! Actually, quite the opposite.” He sighed. “So many people think that I just know everything. It wasn’t even my idea to start Dumbledore’s Army—it was Hermione’s. And then she was just telling me how great of a teacher I’d be because of what I’d gone through and what I’d done. I told everyone at the time, that was all mostly luck.” He smiled to himself. “Later on, I actually got accused by a lot of adults of only being able to cast the Expelliarmus charm. But that’s not really something to teach an advanced class.”
“Well,” Draco said, contemplating. “I guess I don’t know. All my friends’ parents have marriage contracts, and I assume they began with relationship contracts. Betrothal contracts only ended in our families about a century ago. And I don’t have any friends who aren’t...” He trailed off. Before, not having any friends who had mixed blood was something to be proud of, but now he was ashamed.
Draco loved seeing Harry’s face light up like a Christmas tree. Though Harry was astoundingly bad at making snowballs and Draco had to smooth every one that his boyfriend contributed to the pile, Harry seemed to be having the time of his life. Draco realized that he rarely saw the Boy Who Lived be excited about anything. Happy or content, certainly. But rarely looking forward to something. Draco wanted to make him feel like this every second of the day.  “Whose idea was this?” Harry asked.
Let me know what you think! Isn’t Harry so clueless? It’s adorable but it reminds me of how he handled the whole Cho Chang situation, lol.
I really enjoyed writing this one! Only 3 left in this series—I should have the next one out maybe by Thursday or Friday. Love you guys, as usual let me know what you think!
Draco nodded. “I—“ his heart rate was starting to increase and his breathing turned to hyperventilating. He felt Potter hesitantly place a hand on his back. Draco flinched at first, but Harry started to make small circles with his palm and Draco eased into the touch.
“Professor Snape taught you, right?” Harry nodded. “He tried to teach me, too. Surprisingly, he wasn’t that good at explaining to me exactly what I needed to do. He was very skilled himself, but just couldn’t get the point across.”
Harry rolled his eyes but did not look unhappy as Draco dragged him out of the eighth year dorms, bundled him up, and nearly pushed him into the fresh air. “What in the world—“
Draco walked through his memories, wondering what he could share with everyone that would show them he didn’t have the best year either, that would demonstrate that he had been on the receiving end of the Dark Lord’s wrath, too. The only one he could think of was...but he couldn’t handle that.
“Tell them we’re dating? I was going to talk to you about that. Aren’t you visiting your parents this weekend?”
Draco walked off the Hogwarts Express with a new determination. He was going to show Potter that he didn’t need “help” and that he didn’t have Muggle ailments. While many students were gawking at the Thestrals pulling the carriages, now finally able to see them (Draco was able to see them last year for the first time), Draco looked for Gregory and any other potentially friendly faces.
Draco didn’t say anything for a moment. “Well, I brought it up to Granger. Then we worked together on it.” When Harry looked at him pressingly, he continued. “I hated the thought of you never having an authentic snowball fight. And I know you don’t want me to worry about it, but—Merlin, Harry, you never even had a childhood. I wanted to give you a piece of that back.”
Smith sounded far too curious for Draco’s liking. “No,” Harry retorted. “It’s just very new. You could proclaim it to the whole castle if you’d like, but I doubt anyone would care.” Draco understood why Harry was saying that, but it still terrified him. Smith would love to know that Draco was scared of people knowing, and then he would do exactly that—tell the whole castle. It was best to let him know that wouldn’t affect Draco or Harry—even if that was a lie.
. If the Dementors were bothering him this much when they were at least a floor apart from him, how were his parents feeling?
He wasn’t sure what to do. Should he try and visit Lucius again? What if his father had gotten worse? What if his father had seen a
Greg shrugged. “Nothing, really. My mum just sent me a letter telling me about Dad’s sentence, warning me to not have any communication with Theodore Nott. What about you, what’s happening with your parents?”
“I don’t get it,” Daphne said. “If your father wants to improve the Malfoy reputation, wouldn’t dating Potter be the best way to do that? I know that’s not why you’re dating him, but it’s sort of an instant boost, isn’t it?”
“I—I don’t want it. I have a new one, but thank you.” Potter looked confused. “I’ve done things with that wand that I never want to do again,” Draco said quietly.
or whatever—I certainly don’t like it, but I’ll make it useful when it comes to people I care about.”
However, this plan was derailed when he received a mysterious letter one early November morning. This was not unusual, but after the fiasco with the black liquid, Draco no longer opened letters that came from owls or had handwriting he didn’t recognize. As his friends and himself were sitting at the Great Hall, they were shocked by the owl that swooped down in front of them, cooing softly and dropping an envelope onto Draco’s plate.
Draco hesitated. It seemed that Greg was sad, but Draco knew he’d never been good at comforting people. The roaring fire made him uncomfortable as well. Swallowing, Draco settled on the floor next to Greg, staring into the flames. They sat in silence for a few minutes.
“Um...” Draco said, giving Harry pause. “Actually. Um. I know that you want to take things slow and that is totally fine with me. Better than fine actually, I don’t care in the slightest. Wait! No, I care, I just—“ Draco’s face was screwed up in confusion, and Harry looked amused. Sometimes it was difficult for him to find the line between being nonchalant about something and just blatantly rude. “I was wondering if maybe you would be willing to sleep in my bed tonight?”
“Yes, and you nearly killed two students at this school while refusing help.” Kingsley did not say this unkindly or with a sneer, but merely as a matter of fact. “Theo should have learned from your mistakes, yes? Besides, he is an adult. He can make his own choices.”
Draco was shoved inside somewhere that was much too bright, and he heard the sound of a dog barking. Warmth started to envelope him but it was extremely unpleasant at first, and burned his hands and feet. He made a strangled sound as Harry put him on a couch and began to take off his shoes. Draco had previously stopped shivering but the warmth brought the cold back. How was that possible?
Everyone was silent for a moment. Then Greg spoke up. “I agree with Daphne. I’m—I actually signed up with McGonagall yesterday to see one of those Mind Healer people. I don’t want to feel this way anymore.” It was more than he had said in the past day, and Draco’s head perked up in surprise. Greg met Draco’s gaze with a small smile and shrug. “What harm could it do?”
He knew he was going to black out. He looked around—it couldn’t be here. The hallways were too open, anyone could come along him. This did not help his panic. He tried desperately to remember what his Mind Healer Christine had taught him as he ran looking for safety.
!” Draco let out a hiss of pain as the skin on his right arm split open. He put his hand on the wound and pushed past the two students. The hallways were extremely crowded and he was far from his dormitory. The chaos mostly covered him, but he was quite tall and caught some students’ eye. They gawked, glared, yelled at him, and a few even tripped him as he was rushing to get back to the dormitory. Blood started to drip on the floor—as much as he didn’t want to go back to his quarters, he needed to find Blaise or Daphne so they could heal his arm.
Without looking at anyone’s reactions, he left the common area and went to a place he knew very well—the place where Moaning Myrtle still howled throughout the day.
a memory, let it fill you up inside. Instead of trying to shove everything down like you do when you empty your mind, you have to puff everything up. So, what are some of your happiest memories?”
“You alright, mate?” Gregory put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and he flinched. Draco downed the rest of his drink.
As it was Friday evening, the hallways were blissfully empty and Draco had an uneventful walk down to the Hospital Wing. The last time he was here was in his sixth year after Potter split his skin open in dozens of places with that curse he used. Draco remembered lying on the floor, only barely aware of what had just happened, and frankly, ready to die. His last thought before his swimming vision registered Professor Snape healing him was about his mother.
“Hi Draco,” Daphne Greengrass said quietly. She was sitting next to Greg and across from Blaise and Draco. Blaise did not look unhappy to see Draco, but raised his eyebrows in surprise. Greg looked down at his feet.
As he passed through the crowd searching for a place to lay low, parents were thankfully mostly distracted. Some turned their child away and clasped them to their chests, glaring at Draco as he passed. Some looked at him as though they were aware they knew him (probably from the cover of
!” He was knocked to the ground as about a half dozen students came forth out of the woods. While he was stunned and the world was moving slowly, someone took his wand from his pocket. It was too dark to see anything except for a flash of deep red.
This action immediately brought Draco back to first year, when he offered Harry a place by his side. He had made some stupid speech about not wanting Potter to hang with the wrong crowd, and then he extended his small hand to reach Harry’s. Harry Potter refused him. After his father had told Draco to try and befriend the Boy Who Lived, Draco was horribly disappointed in himself. In Lucius’s first letter to him at Hogwarts, the first question asked how close Draco had become with Harry. Draco remembered writing his reply admitting defeat, gripping his quill so hard that some of the feathers fell off. He turned his sadness into something easier to deal with—hatred.
Yarney shoved Draco roughly into a chair, then pulled the blindfold off. Draco blinked for a few moments, adjusting to his surroundings. The room he was in had a greenish tinge from moss growing on the walls. It was freezing in here, and only got colder with each step Yarney took away from Draco. There were metal plates on the ground—presumably to hold chains in place for prisoners—and a simple table in front of Draco with another chair. The room was barren apart from that.
Draco nodded uncomfortably. He swallowed. “Are—are my parents alright? Dolohov had mentioned my father...”
“You know exactly what he was going to say. This is why something like that would never work, Hermione. You’re a better person than all of us for wanting to try, but look: they haven’t learned a thing. I was naive to think otherwise.” Harry put down his fork and walked out of the Great Hall. Hermione looked as though she were going to follow him, but Neville put his hand on her shoulder, whispering to her.
The weeks right before winter break were some of the best that Draco had at Hogwarts. He was finally feeling a little at peace with himself after his last panic attack. The Time Turner had weighed on him more than he thought as well. Knowing that it was safely out of any Malfoy hands made it easier to sleep at night, though Draco’s dreams still included nightmares of Theo Nott. Draco felt really stupid at burning his letter so many weeks ago—he should have read it. But, as was the theme of his life, he could not change the past.
Harry looked at him. “I know you’re not the same. You’re still a rude prick, but...you’re not like how you were on the train sixth year.”
Harry’s colon and parenthesis looked like a little sideways smiley face, which Draco loved. He couldn’t wait to just be back around Harry. He felt so safe knowing that the Boy Who Lived was sleeping in the same room as him, not because of what Harry did in terms of defeating the Dark Lord, but because he knew he was with someone who could help him through nightmares without smirking at him in the morning, like Theo used to do, or without doting on him and smothering him like Pansy.
“I want you at this school, Draco. Please, if you ever feel—and I’m not saying you did,” she interrupted herself, noticing the protesting look on Draco’s face already. “If you ever feel like harming yourself in any capacity, please come to my office immediately. I won’t tell your parents, I won’t make you discuss anything. I’ll just...” she sighed and looked down, seeming at a loss for words. “I’ll just make you some tea. Alright?”
“I’ve heard of a certain ‘Dumbledore’s Army’ that existed starting three years ago,” she smiled at Harry. “That’s why I almost feel unequipped to teach you all. It seems that you have much more you could teach me. This will be our first project, and it will last the greater part of the term. You will pick one skill to use against dark spells or intentions, and learn it inside and out. Learn its weaknesses, its strengths, and most importantly, how to use it in many situations. Then you are to teach the class this skill. Your grade will not just depend on how well you can perform the skill, but how well your peers can by the end of your teachings.
Draco’s friends were relieved at the outcome of the trial, but Draco knew that his parents weren’t out of the woods yet. After the events at the Ministry, he finally decided to poke his head out from under the sand and research current events. Thanks to old copies of the
“Ten minutes ago?” Harry stated. “Here, you guys go ahead and talk to Kingsley. We’ll meet up with you in a little bit.”
“That’s because he doesn’t know if you like him! Fevered confessions of love aren’t the same thing as sitting down with someone with your entire mental faculties intact and telling them how you feel.” Draco wasn’t sure what Granger was saying about fevered confessions of love, but she had a point. Maybe he should tell Potter how he felt. What’s the worst that could happen? “My point is,” Granger continued. “He’s not going to talk to you about it, regardless of how many hints you drop. He’s clueless. So it’s up to you.”
“George and I are just trying to, you know...” Ron lowered his voice. “Spy on the competition. See what products they have that we don’t, try and make ours better.”
Draco’s first day back at school comes with a return to Defense Against the Dark Arts, and a disturbing new project...
“—I could have sworn that something was wrong, especially when I got the letter that my dad’s sentence was extended—“
The eighth years sat gathered in the common space one late October night. It was only about a week until Halloween, and it was storming outside. Draco assumed everyone else felt cozy next to the fire, but it made him more nervous than the lightning outside. He was sitting by his friends, but Harry wasn’t far away. Draco kept looking at him, wondering what he was thinking and how he was doing. It was getting harder and harder to only speak to him at night—Draco found himself waiting all day to hear Harry’s voice. Harry met his gaze and gave a small smile. Draco returned it and turned away.
“Draco, look at me for a moment,” Harry said, his tone serious. Draco met his intense gaze. “I want you to know that you’re...I was going to say a totally different person, but that’s not it. It’s like you’ve kept all the best parts of the Draco Malfoy I knew and got rid of the little git inside. You’re still just as funny and witty, but you’re so much more kind and open. And that’s a good thing. You’re still you.”
“Enough.” Harry said quietly. Draco tried to unclench his hand from his glass. “I’m done with the fighting. Ron, you’re my best mate. You’ve had a really rough summer, and I understand that. But Draco is trying to be a better person. And you’re making that a little difficult right now.”
“Draco!” Potter stormed into the Hogs Head and rushed over to him. “Are you alright? What are you doing?”
Normally he could afford to lounge in bed for a little while—well, all day really. There was nothing for him to do this summer and barely anyone to converse with once the lawyers stopped coming around. The first month of the summer was filled with back-and-forth. First, it was thought that the Malfoys were certainly going to Azkaban within a week after the Battle, and they were only placed on house arrest until the paperwork could be settled. At that time, Draco felt a small sense of satisfaction, and in a way, protection. The world was being righted again—justice could still be served. He was so unburdened by this realization that he didn’t even care if order being restored meant his end.
“I just wanted someone to go with me who wouldn’t try and comfort me the whole time. As great as Ron and Hermione are, I knew you would just...let me be.”
The last hour of the evening passed in silence as Draco prepared for a long night. There was no way he was going to fall asleep now, not with Potter right there to listen to his every cry and plea. Not after he had rejected Potter’s handshake. He got some rest on the train so he would be alright until the next day. That was a good plan—he would sleep during the day and do all his homework at night. Draco was sure he could find six hours during the day to sleep. Maybe he could even learn to make simple meals in the kitchen, it was good to learn domestic spells anyway—
“You spent the better part of Transfiguration yesterday chasing down your alarm clock that had sprouted legs and was kicking people!” Draco could not argue with that.
“Nothing. Well, I guess it’s not nothing. You’ll find out on Halloween.” Harry turned over and went to sleep. All he had told Draco was that he would be accompanying Harry somewhere on Halloween, but hadn’t provided any other details, including how they would leave the castle.
“Because a wizard mind and a Muggle mind are the same,” Neville argued. “There’s nothing different about how we think. We just have magic and they don’t.” Murmurs of displeasure scattered about the crowd. Draco heard Daphne scoff.
Draco wasn’t sure how much time had passed when the Healer came in. She was a nice woman, but either refused to answer Draco’s questions about what was going on, or truly didn’t know. She gave him a potion to help with his head and told him that he would be fine, but he needed to take it easy over the next few days.
The second was the week before the Death Eaters were planning to invade Hogwarts grounds, in his sixth year. He was still in bed at the hospital wing, spending his time staring at the ceiling. Strangely enough, he had absolutely nothing to do. He had given up on homework long beforehand. His only focus had been fixing the Vanishing cabinet. Now that he was done, he just had to wait to face the consequences.
Morning certainly came with a vengeance, though. Still recovering from his one excursion outside this dormitory, Draco now had a full day of classes to worry about. “I’m fine, Potter,” he responded curtly, and moved to get ready for the day. His answer wasn’t one hundred percent accurate—he honestly still felt quite dizzy and anxious about the day ahead. It sunk into him later yesterday evening that he truly had almost died from something as small as that. He had no means of defending himself, and now he had to view everything and everyone as a threat.
Of course Ron wasn’t going to stand for this. Draco had truly been horrible to his entire family. Sure, he hadn’t much to do with Fred’s death, but he certainly had a lot to do with the eldest Weasley’s mauling by Fenir Grayback. That would have never happened if Draco hadn’t let the Death Eaters into the castle. He sighed as he leaned against a bunch of jump-scare products. This wasn’t going according to plan in the slightest. Draco glanced at the clock—it was only two. They had been out for three hours and already Draco nearly had a panic attack, got thrown out of a pub, got completely pissed, and now they have run into Harry’s best friend who hated Draco’s guts.  Draco felt exhausted and defeated—he was just ready to go back to school.
Draco was close to bursting into tears at the hopelessness of his situation. “Your mother is one of the strongest people I know. She’ll be alright,” Potter said quietly.
“But, Draco, today I want to just ask you some questions and try and diagnose you so I can see how best I can help you during our time together.”
“Well...would that have been true?” Draco looked at the ground, unusually unsure. “Here—“ Harry said, and led him to a secluded bench in a quiet corner of the castle. They both sat down, waiting for the other to speak.
After what seemed like ages but was probably only a few minutes, Draco saw a flash of blond hair. Yarney entered the room with Narcissa and shut the door behind him, the glow of his Patronus brightening the room.
The two companions caught the train to Hogsmeade, and it was a short ride. Draco was thinking about how far he had come from the boy who had a panic attack on the train going to Hogwarts. Though he somewhat felt on the verge of an anxiety attack right now, he took pleasure in the fact that it was because of butterflies in his stomach rather than sharp daggers of fear.
As if Ginny could read his mind, she spoke again. “Dolohov, the Carrows—they’re in Azkaban. So we don’t have to worry about them. As for the rest...”
“Rest assured, I have expressed my displeasure at the situation. I am no fan of your parents’, Mr. Malfoy, but I believe that what is happening inside the Ministry right now is more of the same—wizards and witches ruled by fear. I think Minister Shacklebolt has done an excellent job with the current reforms, but only he can go so far. I’ve been in contact with him about this particular situation, and he has agreed to consider what I have to say. Hopefully in the next week or so we’ll learn how long this stint in Azkaban may end up being for your mother and father.”
He dropped it like it was a burning hot pan, and his heart dropped with the package. “Where the hell did you get this,” he growled. Things were getting serious now.
Draco sighed again. “I guess you’re right. If you’re really sure about this, then it would be the greatest privilege in my life to call you mine.”
Auror Yarney turned back to face him. His stoic face had been replaced by a glare. “My colleague just sent me Mr. Potter’s statement on today’s events. Apparently Dolohov said,” he looked back at his parchment. “‘They know more than they’re letting on’, referring to your parents.” Yarney looked back at Draco. “Well?”
“Just remember that he isn’t going on a date with you because he wants to do something in particular,” Gregory chimed in. “Vincent and I—“ he paused for a moment while Blaise and Daphne looked very surprised. It was rare for Greg to mention Vincent, both because of his own pain and because Vincent was so hated among the students. “We went on very few actual dates. Mostly we just talked, snuggled by the fire in the Room of Requirement, that sort of thing.”
“I have this application to see my parents before their retrial. I know I want to see my mother, but...I’m not sure I want to see my father.”
“What’s going on here?” Draco turned around to see Blaise, Greg, and Daphne standing with their arms crossed, looking suspiciously at the other Gryffindors.
Draco tensed beneath Harry’s fingertips. He swallowed thickly before answering. “They told me all their stories. Everything that happened to them because of what I did. It was just overwhelming to hear it all, I guess.” That was an understatement, but Draco didn’t feel that he had the strength to consider it any further right now.
that even the younger Nott was wanted for questioning, and anyone who had an inkling of his whereabouts needed to report to the Ministry.
It was finally the end of the first week of school, and Draco had mounds of homework to do. He found a quiet study corner in the library on Friday afternoon. Greg had gone to his first session with the Mind Healer, and Blaise and Daphne were enjoying the autumn winds. He just wanted to be alone. He normally hated privacy and constantly surrounded himself with friends back in the day, but he spent his entire summer in isolation. Having all these deep conversations this week had made him realize just how much he was suffocating.
“Don’t worry about breakfast, mother.” Draco quickly shifted the jacket so that he was sitting on it. His mother would know that it wasn’t his. Thankfully he managed to conceal it by the time she fully came into the room, looking like she hadn’t slept at all last night. He felt a pang of guilt that he didn’t stay up with her, make her some tea, or do something to try and comfort her. He had been so busy thinking about how he felt about seeing Lucius that he forgot what a big deal this would be for her. “We can—“ he was about to suggest they go out to brunch after seeing Lucius.
With his friends not planning to confront him until next week, Draco only had one person to worry about in the current time frame. Potter certainly noticed Draco’s thinning figure and self-imposed isolation in their bedroom. In fact, a situation like the following had occurred multiple times throughout the week:
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, Potter, we all know that you’re so incredibly good at everything under the sun. Good for you. Just pick something and let’s move on with it.”
“No,” Draco said. Purebloods tended to have children in specific generations so that they would be close enough to marry each other. His friends that did have siblings were still close enough in age so that Draco couldn’t remember them being babies.
“It’s fine. They’re just helping me with something.” Draco tried to ward them off before anyone started an argument.
Harry strolled into the Three Broomsticks with Draco following close behind him—it was too bad that he towered over the young wizard. Sure enough, Madame Rosmerta caught his eye and morphed her face into an immediate glare. She stamped over to the two, with Potter looking disturbed.
There were murmurs throughout the courtroom, and Draco saw various reporters scratching at their notepads. Apparently they had anticipated that Draco would be called as a witness, or that
Draco wasn’t going to stick around to hear the end of this argument. “Out of my way,” he said quietly, and began to move past them. He wasn’t scared of the two young Ravenclaws exactly—he had been tortured many times before. But he knew that he wasn’t able to defend himself, and didn’t want to slink back to his Slytherin barely-friends injured or weakened.
“It’s no use trying to get through to him, Minerva,” a familiar voice drawled behind her. “He has a tight rein on any emotion that doesn’t allow him to exude arrogance.” Draco tensed, recognizing the hurt in his former mentor’s voice.
“I—I don’t want to hear about what you went through, Potter. You and I are totally different. I don’t care what you have to say. I’m fine. Just leave me alone, I don’t know why you’re bothering me so much.” Draco thrust open his trunk and started gathering his robes.
“Ah, fantastic. I’m sure he’ll be delighted to see you. If you all could just stick out a hand for me—“ she pulled out a wand and begin doing diagnostics on the group, presumably checking for any hidden spells or glamours. She got to Draco last, and he outstretched his right arm. “Let me just check one thing really quickly,” she said, frowning and walking away.
“Who exactly is ‘us’?” No one answered, but Draco was pulled up roughly by someone and marched toward the Forbidden Forest.
Draco took it, his voice filled with emotion. Harry acted as though Draco was no longer disliked on both sides, but Draco knew the truth. “It is well-deserved.”
“I’m not for you. I’m to make sure he doesn’t try anything.” The man nodded his head at Draco, whose heart fell.
“My mother went to dinners there all the time as a kid. It’s a very well-known property in the pureblood families. It’s nice that you own it, even though it’s of course awful that your godfather died.”
The home had certainly seen better days, and was not being touched at all, apparently not even for preservation purposes. The window panes were shattered and the door was slightly off its hinges. Draco shuddered at the sight, almost feeling the Dark Lord’s presence.
Harry took off Draco’s shirt and threw it to the ground. This normally would have driven Draco crazy, but something had already captured his sanity. He loved the boy in front of him who didn’t care about being careless with expensive things. He loved the man in front of him who loved so deeply. Draco took off Harry’s simple shirt rather quickly, and moved to unbutton his own trousers, still trying to keep one hand on his boyfriend at all times.
“Actually, no. That’s not the best way to start—trying to empty your mind is truly very difficult. First, we’re going to start with you trying to show me a very specific memory. Think about...hmmm...think about your first Quidditch game here.” A small smile shone on Harry’s face as he leaned back and closed his eyes. “Think about what you felt. What you smelled, what you heard. The feeling of walking onto the pitch, the wind in your face as you flew through the air. Stop at that point—don’t think about the whole game. Just think about walking onto the pitch, anything Wood or your other teammates said to you during the huddle, and the start of the game.”
“Probably,” Harry admitted. “At least you’ll be out for a bit, let people focus on something else. Gossip doesn’t stay in the same place for too long at this school.”
“Harry said he was sitting with us today.” Blaise sounded somewhat unhappy next to Draco, and gave him a look that Draco couldn’t decipher.
“I mean, only if you want to. I don’t really care. Well, I mean I invited you so obviously I care, but...”
“Weren’t your parents the one who made you do bad things in the first place?” Myrtle crooned from beside him. He was now sitting below the sink, knees drawn up to his chest. Most of the time he felt much older than eighteen, but right now he felt very small. He nodded, touching his forehead to his knees. “Then you shouldn’t worry about what they think. You should be happy. If I had lived, I wouldn’t have listened to my parents.”
“Harry!” Kingsley boomed, and got up to shake his hand. “It’s so good to see you! How are you doing?”
“I didn’t...” Draco gestured feebly at the desk beside the bed. Potter picked up the note that he wrote.
“Relax, Malfoy. From my understanding it’s just as much for their safety as it is for everyone else’s.”
He felt a little less cold than he did when the first got back, but he couldn’t shake his father’s words out of his head. He was confused—if anything, Lucius had always been upset with Draco for his lack of interest in his father’s business dealings. Now Lucius accused Draco of wanting his parents in Azkaban so he could have the Malfoy family fortune.
“I don’t care. I can’t control how many Death Eaters are still out there, I can’t control how many people have nerve damage from the Cruciatus curse, but this? This I can control. And so I will.”
Ron took a sip of his drink and set it down a little forcefully. “And how are your parents, Malfoy? Still locked up?”
“Come on Malfoy, I know you’re a right prat, but they’d never turn away any guest of two recipients of the Order of Merlin,” Ron beamed with pride—Draco pictured him slipping this into conversation any way he could.
“No thanks.” Draco was far too nervous to eat breakfast. Even without the impending doom of a possible first-date, he usually only had the stamina to eat one meal a day.
A few hours later he found himself early to Professor McGonagall’s office, waiting for Mr. Burke. She had offered him a biscuit as usual, but he declined politely. His hands twitched involuntarily on his knees as he struggled to avoid looking at the portraits of Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape.
“I’m sure he doesn’t really think that about you. I’m sure of it. I hate the guy but he isn’t...that.” Harry said. “That must have been really hard to see your parents like that. Do you know when they’ll get out?”
“Yes Mr. Zabini. As the new leaders of this school, it is important for you twenty to unify. We’re going to talk more about your role as the first—and hopefully last—eighth years of Hogwarts later. For now, please take a seat.
The face slid into focus, and it was Harry Potter. Draco grabbed the concerned face. “Potter! Potter please listen to me—“ Draco’s chest was heaving with sobs. “The snake, it’s going to eat her, you have to kill the snake, please, you have to do something—“
The woman came back with a burly looking man behind her. “You’re all cleared to see the Minister,” she said, opening the gate that led to the entrance of the Ministry of Magic.
. Draco sighed. “I suppose. Don’t worry if you need to ditch me at some point, I have some shopping to do anyway.”
Harry bit his lip. “They’re trying to bring Voldemort back. At least, that’s what Kingsley tells me.” Draco couldn’t believe Harry was on a first name basis with the Minister of Magic—actually, it made sense. He shuddered at the prospect of the Dark Lord coming back. “They suspect that Nott has a Time-Turner.”
“As you know, we are in charge of figuring out how to honor the fallen. Yes, both those who fought with the Order of the Phoenix and those who fought with the Death Eaters.” There were some displeased murmurs in the crowd at this statement, and Goyle tensed. “This will not be easy and will take a lot of discussion. But that’s why we have the whole year.”
It was surprisingly difficult for Draco to take leave of his mother. She was extraordinarily talkative and nearly filled all the space in the extravagant Manor with her words. Tilly the house elf was still present, but seemed less keen on taking orders than usual. Draco had to throw in a “please” when he asked her to make dinner for the two of them, though he was already a little full of cookies. He interrupted a long gossip session about Pansy Parkinson’s escapades in France to ask a simple question.
“Because you will feel so much better down the road! Look at me,” Harry said kindly. Draco met his eyes in the darkness. “You’ve been through a lot. You deserve to get better.”
The sky began to darken, and Draco’s heart began to beat faster with the dimming light. Knowing he still had a few hours left on his journey, he decided to settle down in a compartment and get some rest—he wasn’t sure if he would be able to get any tonight. He opened his trunk to reveal something that he stole before he left—though he hoped Harry wouldn’t notice or miss it. He didn’t want to come across as needy. He laid down on the soft train seat and draped one of Harry’s warm, Muggle jackets over him. Hoping that the smell would ward off any nightmares, Draco drifted off to sleep.
Draco looked at her with hope. “Can—can we just sit here, and you can give me a good report? That’s the only thing that will help any of this.”
He clenched and unclenched his fist in frustration. How would he be expected to act in front of Harry? Would they hold hands in the hallway? Would Harry tell anyone, or would he want to keep their relationship a secret? For once in his life Draco had fully stepped onto a new path. Asking Harry on a date sure was a step in that direction, but he could have always gone backward. Now, he couldn’t undo what he did without risking one of his greatest friends. And he was pretty sure he would never want to do that.
“But it didn’t, right? Only Mr. Burke saw you. Only he’s making a big deal about it. It wasn’t in the Prophet, there weren’t any attacks, everything was fine! You did absolutely nothing wrong.” Harry took Draco’s hand. “Trust me. I’m always the first to blame myself when things go wrong, so I completely understand what you’re saying. I would tell you if you screwed up. You didn’t. You just...existed. And that’s not a mistake.”
“Wha? Wha’s wrong?” Harry said groggily while turning on the lamp with a flick of his wand and putting on his glasses.
“Well, that’ll help,” Draco drawled sarcastically. “Actually, why don’t you just cast Expelliarmus on the thing? That usually solves your problems.”
“Your sympathy ploy isn’t working on us. Even if you’re not a liar about your tongue, you probably deserved it. It’s nothing compared to what my family suffered,” Finch-Fletchley continued.
“I—um...sure. Thanks.” Draco knew that it would not be polite to turn down anyone’s tea after they knew his intentions of making his own. He poured himself a cup of tea and moved toward his room. “Well. Goodnight.”
was so beautiful. Draco wanted to kiss that scar, to kiss all of his scars and have Harry kiss his until both of them felt whole again.
“I appreciate that,” Harry said to Greg. He looked somewhat at ease, but his bouncing leg beside Draco gave away some of his anxiety. “I know this is weird, and I know it hasn’t been easy for you guys to be back at school. But—“ Harry looked at Draco, silently asking if he could mention anything. Draco smile and nodded. “—Draco and I have begun dating.”
“Well, they’ve managed to get a little out of Dolohov. A lot of the information is secret, but it seems that Nott—the older one—is taking the lead on the new Death Eater movement.”
Draco could hardly focus in his next class. Squirming in his seat, he was reluctant to raise his hand at all to answer any questions. He was terrified that he would blurt out “
“No Malfoy, we have to go to the Hospital Wing. You lost a lot of blood. You’ll be just fine, but you need the right potion—“
“Well I can’t do magic now, can I?” Draco mumbled as he was finally able to drop the trunk. As part of his probation, he was required to wear a magic bracelet that blocked him from using magic until he graduated from Hogwarts. He was very irritated that he was not able to practice with his new wand for the entire summer. Not only would he return to school as a criminal, but also terrible at magic from disuse.
When Harry and Draco arrived in Hogsmeade, they then made use of the relatively abandoned Hog Head’s Floo network to travel to Diagon Alley. Harry entered the shop first, without the cloak, and made small talk with the person at the counter before Draco entered as well. The poor shopkeeper that he disturbed upon entry looked confused, as his fireplace had erupted in green flames with no floating head or person waiting to speak with him. Harry took his leave and guided an invisible Draco out the back door, both of them stifling laughs.
“That’s okay Sweetheart. Everything’s going to be okay, I just know it. I’m so happy to see you. You’re doing okay? Is school going well? Are people treating you alright?” Narcissa fired off questions, one after another.
He no longer felt helpless. In fact, he was even a little proud of himself. So far, he hadn’t involved anyone needlessly in his latest crisis, but he hadn’t been so arrogant as to assume he could do things all on his own either. He only hoped that this plan would work better than his others. If not that, he begged the universe to at least minimize the casualties.
He couldn’t have spoken for more than half an hour, but he felt like his voice was a train where the brakes had been removed. A few times it seemed like the portrait of Professor Snape was going to interrupt him, but it was shushed by Dumbledore’s portrait. Draco told Professor McGonagall nearly everything—about the letter he had received and burned from Theodore Nott, about the newly resurrected Dumbledore’s Army (though he did not give up their location, and didn’t mention any name except for Ginny Weasley), and about the Time Turner. He did not, however, mention his relationship with Harry, but merely told the professor that he was being blackmailed. Professor McGonagall watched him evenly the whole time. A few times he paused, waiting for her to ask a question, but her silence encouraged him to continue. He felt empty by the end in the best possible way.
So that’s what Ginny was doing in the woods! What do you think they’re going to do with Draco? Do you think Harry is going to rescue him, or is he going to have to save himself?
“I’ll tell you later; it’s kind of an interesting story,” Harry said, smirking. Draco wondered exactly how much he would have to unravel and deduce about Harry before he knew every inch of the man sitting next to him. And my god, he wanted to know every inch so badly. “Do you want to talk about what happened? I mean, I think I can sort of guess...”
Lacking the strength to argue, Draco treaded beside Ginny. His emotions were so confused at the moment that he had forgotten the girl beside him used to be with Harry.
Draco wasn’t around to hear Potter’s finished thought. He had a hunch that the moving star he saw in the night sky was actually the Snitch. Hearing Potter right on his tail, Draco finally spotted it. His heart rate increased and he tried not to wobble as he dove downward after the pesky ball. He was so close, and could hear the commotion of the small crowd as he and Potter flew back toward the ground. The Snitch leveled out, preventing them both from diving straight into the pitch at the last second. Stretching out his left arm, Draco leaned forward, fingers barely grazing the object—
Ginny was silent for a moment before speaking again. “I don’t care about you in the slightest, Malfoy, not even enough to torture you like you tortured me. But I care about Harry a whole awful lot. Regardless of our history, he’s like a part of our family. So if you’re just being cheeky, you better stop and consider who all you’re messing around with. It’s not just Harry. You’ll have a whole army after you, literally, if you hurt him.”
Draco’s mind was so sluggish, and he reached for the water glass but found it to double before his eyes, and he didn’t know which one to pick up.
. Draco remembered that the Aurors were quite unhelpful with the events of the past seven years. Lucius would often lead them away from any findings regarding the Dark Lord. The professor who had You-Know-Who on the back of his head was Dumbledore’s fault, the Chamber of Secrets being opened had reflected further incompetence of the Headmaster, Cedric Diggory had died due to negligence...the list of excuses continued, and everyone believed the Malfoy patriarch. Draco had believed him, too.
“Hey,” Harry said, smiling at Draco. Though Draco still felt like he was on the verge of a panic attack, he couldn’t help but smile back. When he sat down, he made sure to touch his leg to Harry’s under the table.
“What do you want, Looney?” Blaise was aware that Luna had been imprisoned in the Manor for the better part of last year. He probably thought that she was going to try and hex Draco. Draco felt a sudden rush of affection for his distant friend—
Feeling very tired, Draco carefully climbed into bed next to Harry, and did just that. With the small kiss that Draco planted on Harry’s forehead, the man opened his eyes sleepily.
Draco figured he was particularly good at Occlumency because of the way he organized his emotions. When he was younger and faced difficult situations, like rejection by Potter in his first year, he would lie in bed at night and close his eyes. He pictured a long hallway similar to the ones he found in the Manor, but with different colored doors. Brighter doors were for his good emotions—happiness, excitement, and joy. His father always told him that those emotions should be moderated as well. “No one likes someone who never takes things seriously, Draco,” he would say. “If you’re giggling like an idiot all the time, stumbling through the world without a care for real problems, you’re never going to succeed.” So when something really good happened, Draco stored it in the room with the light green door, like pets waiting for him after a long and dreary day.
Draco decided it wasn’t worth his time to inquire and continued to write his essay. “Why don’t you ask Granger?”
“Certainly worth it,” Draco said through chattering teeth. “Although I do wish we would have won.” The combined strength of the Ravenclaws and the Slytherins, with Draco having put himself on the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff team, had overpowered even the Boy Who Lived, who had to fix his glasses at least ten times throughout the course of the nearly two hour match.
Without knowing why, Draco quickly moved and flung open the compartment door, finding himself looking down at three small first year girls, clutching notepads and portable quills to their chests. “Your stupid Savior isn’t here.” The girls looked horrified, likely both by his manner of greeting them and by the fact that he was Draco Malfoy, the only student Death Eater. “Go bother someone else.” He slammed the door shut and slumped back down.
“Call me a Death Eater one more time, Finnegan,” now Goyle had his wand out and was getting ready to rise from his seat, sending the room into commotion again. It was true that Greg wasn’t a Death Eater—Draco had been the only student who was marked. Vincent was the next closest, he even interacted with the Dark Lord once or twice.
“Draco Malfoy. Who on this bench has died before?” Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. “I’m serious! I’ve died. And when I was standing in the Forbidden Forest, waiting for it to happen, it comforted me to know that overall I didn’t have many regrets. Now if you don’t want to date me because you’re worried about you, that’s okay. But I’m a full grown man and I’ve been through the ringer more times than most people have in their entire lives. So if you don’t want to date me because you’re worried about me, that’s ridiculous and impractical. And while you are certainly ridiculous—“ this earned a laugh out of Draco “—you’re not impractical.”
still saw it their right to intersperse personal remarks within factual news stories. The article about the second Malfoy trials labeled Draco’s parents as being absolutely pathetic. Where Draco had seen his mother’s courage in her perseverance to protect her family, the
Draco stiffened a bit at the mention of his father, and looked at Harry for any sign of malice. Finding none, he cleared his throat. “A lot of the former Death Eaters hated my father, actually. Still do. You heard Dolohov, they think he’s two-faced. And he is, they’re right, but they don’t think the Dark Lord was hard enough on him.”
Draco was silent as he gave Harry a few moments to bask in the memory. Finally, he took out his wand, which the Professor had given him access to beforehand. “
“Where does it say in the law that someone on probation needs an escort to walk through the Ministry?” Granger spoke up. “And it isn’t as if he is alone. Did the Minister order this himself?”
“I bet it’s going to be a dragon. Doesn’t your mother call you that?” Harry said as they were walking back from a practice session.
“There...there is something I want to talk to you about,” Draco said for maybe the first time in his life, fidgeting in his seat.
The next few days passed by in bliss. Draco spent the rest of Saturday evening catching up on homework and relaying all the details of his outing with Harry to his friends. They were very supportive, and sympathetic to his situation regarding Madame Rosmerta. Sunday was also a lazy day, but Draco did manage to squeeze in a Quidditch game with the other eighth-years, this time with no painful flashbacks marring the experience. Harry and Draco continued to spend their nights in bed together, with no physical contact, but exchanging whispers about the past year to each other. Each story exchanged helped to ease the burden on both boys, and made their dreams a little nicer.
“You see, when two people really really like each other—“ Another slap. “That’s a ridiculous question! Because we want to? Because we like each other?” Draco was exasperated. “You’re trying to find Death Eaters and you choose to interrogate me about my relationship status? Why don’t you make yourselves useful and focus on an actual threat.”
Draco was silent for a moment. “I didn’t have a choice.” He was hoping in the quiet moment before he spoke that he would come up with a better answer than that. Draco was left with a sinking feeling as he let his mind move with the motion of the train.
Everyone was gathered around the living space, mostly sorted by house. Blaise, Daphne, and Gregory sat at a table, talking softly. The Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws seemed somewhat intermingled, munching on breakfast pastries that someone must have brought or made. Hermione and Neville were sitting on a couch they had moved to the center, facing everyone, while Harry talked with the other Gryffindors on the floor in front of them. By a quick count, it seemed that Draco was the last one up. Potter nodded his head at Draco, who moved to sit at the table with the Slytherins.
Draco decided to leave—no one would miss him. He got up just as Daphne was invited to join Granger’s group and Greg was invited to join Longbottom’s. He refilled his coffee cup and started to sneak back to his room.
“Afternoon, Yarney,” a bored wizard sat at the only desk inside. Draco took a seat in a hard waiting chair across from the desk and gazed around at the room. Massive filing cabinets filled the areas he could see, and there were hallways leading to other rooms as well as a staircase. Though far from the Dementors, the wizard’s Patronus (a leaping squirrel) kept any effects from reaching the building’s occupants. Still shaking, Draco was glad that this office space kept out the cold.
Draco turned and open the door to Professor McGonagall’s office, coming face to face with Potter who had raised a hand to knock. Potter’s expression changed from one of anger to one of concern. “Draco! Are you alright?”
Even with the Invisibility Cloak, remaining hidden was a daunting task. He was sure that he bumped into at least ten people on his way down to the courthouse, and he always had to wait by a door for someone else to open it. Thankfully, oddities were the norm in the Ministry, and no one stopped to investigate what may have knocked their coffee over.
“Well.” He started, and sighed. He could do this. Maybe it would make things better, sharing a bit. “I’m sure you all have noticed that I tend to have...flashbacks, I think they’re called.” Granger nodded knowingly. “I know that I wasn’t...in danger in the same way that you all were. I know that. But I wasn’t out of danger either—“
The two walked mostly in silence for a few miles, even passing Hogsmeade. “Why can’t we just Apparate there?” Draco whined.
“Not just any lizard,” Blaise said through laughter. “A bearded dragon. It’s native to Australia. Get it? Since your mom calls you dragon? It’s hilarious.”
Draco was left standing alone and feeling horrified. Did he do something wrong? Did he ruin one of the only things that he lived for? Maybe he was overthinking things, maybe the elusive figure in Potter’s altered consciousness wasn’t him. That had to be it—Draco was thinking too much about himself again. He decided to consult his friends at lunch.
“Of course it is,” Draco said, because it was, and also, what else was he going to say? He tossed and turned in bed, preparing himself for another sleepless night. His face was flushed with the excitement and happiness of the day, and he dozed lightly with ideas of how soft Harry’s lips would be on his.
“Apparently we’re only rooming two-by-two,” Daphne chimed in. “To give us some privacy. I don’t think it’s a terrible idea, actually.”
“Oh. That’s...nice I guess?” Draco was silent as Potter mulled this over. “Have you ever dated anyone?”
“One moment,” Harry said. “Like I said, I want to do this properly, and a normal first date doesn’t end with being swarmed with autograph requests.” He pulled out his wand.
Narcissa sat on the edge of her husband’s bed and leaned in closely. “He owes us. I saved Harry Potter’s life.”
“No you’re not,” Greg saw right through him. “You’re going to keep them to punish yourself. Give them to me.”
“Just—just out for a walk,” Draco said while squinting, putting up his hands to shield his face from the strong
Soon after that conversation, Draco’s friends returned to their studies. Draco pulled on one of Harry’s Muggle sweatshirts and climbed into Harry’s bed. Blaise’s words echoed in his head. His life right now was probably the best it had ever been. Draco pretended to sleep when Harry came in, not having the words to express how he felt at that moment. As Harry’s arm settled over Draco’s chest, Draco wondered if he really deserved the treasure sitting next to him.
This was probably one of the most difficult chapters I’ve written! I hope it’s at least halfway decent. What do you think is going to happen? What should Draco do?
Draco was dumbfounded and stared at his uneaten plate. He rubbed his chest, feeling as though his heart was breaking. Lucius’s behavior came as no surprise to him. But for his mother to suggest that he live his life as a lie? Maybe it was foolish, but he expected her to be accepting. He was her dragon. Wouldn’t she give up anything, even an heir, to make him happy?
Draco found it hard to meet Hagrid’s eyes. He was grateful and embarrassed. He also couldn’t forget the fact that he tried his very best to get Hagrid fired, both in his third and fifth year. It was almost easier to confront mistakes and wrongdoings from the past few years than from before he became a Death Eater. Even though the former memories were much more traumatic, he was not one hundred percent in control of his situation. In his younger years, he was just a jerk.
Harry was silent for a few moments, and Draco reveled in Harry’s slow circles on his palms. “So...your panic attack...?”
“That’s enough,” Granger said, face flushed partially from anger and partially from drink. “Now isn’t the time or place to talk about any of that.” She looked around the room. “Keep talking everyone, there’s nothing to see here.” Slowly the atmosphere in the room returned to normal as Hermione stepped between Dean and Draco. “Come on, Dean, let’s go play the next round of Exploding Snap.” She steered Dean away from Draco, who stood paralyzed.
“Please eat something, dear. It’s a long journey.” Draco had to make an effort after looking into Narcissa’s eyes across from him. He grabbed a plain piece of toast from the table and took a bite.
“What’s it look like m’doing?” he slurred. Inwardly he cringed—he sounded like Lucius. “Jus’ go, Potter. You don’ need to be here.”
Draco laughed, and then swallowed. His rising panic from earlier was starting to slowly make its way back up his throat. “How um...I mean, what are the parameters of this relationship?”
Draco and Harry have a much needed conversation the day after his panic attack. Also, the burden of the Time Turner is lifted.
There was nothing else in the room to look at, save for a single chair and a cart full of potions and uneaten meals. Draco was forced to look at the figure in the bed.
“I think if you can go to the Malfoy Gardens, that would be a really cute idea,” Daphne said. “You could bring food, take a walk, get to know each other.”
“Shh, we need to get inside, okay? We need to get to somewhere warm. I know where we can go and it isn’t far, but your fingertips are turning blue, love. Can you stand?”
“No, I reckon not,” Draco said. He was surprised by how humble Harry was. “You’ve got to be good at something else though, you made it this far.”
“EVERYONE SHUT UP,” Potter yelled. “Alright, that’s it.” He grabbed a basket containing blankets from the ground and dumped its contents on the couch. “Wands in here. We can’t keep threatening each other.” Everyone looked very hesitant. “Come on, I’ll go first.” Potter dropped his wand into the basket and the Gryffindors soon followed. After a few moments, the rest of the students put their wands in the basket. Draco had no qualms about giving up his wand—it was useless to him as long as the manacle was on his wrist anyway.
Apart from all that, his life was mostly uneventful. He found he was cruising through his days with a bit of apathy. Sure, his Slytherin friends got him to smile or laugh every once and a while. But the one thing he truly looked forward to all day was getting to spend nights with Harry. The boys mostly ignored each other during the day, not out of animosity, but merely giving each other space to do their own thing. Draco often found himself gazing at Potter during class, wondering how his former nemesis was feeling. This scared him—why was Potter making him so happy? Should he try and stop feeling so good when Potter was around? How did Potter feel about him?
Draco straightened his robes as the train came to a stop. He made sure he was fully composed before he stepped off the Hogwarts Express with his trunk—hopefully for the last time.
Draco was no longer used to his friends being so subdued. Daphne, Blaise, and Greg lounged glumly on the seats of the train compartment. No one had much to say—most of them were going home to places and people they would rather not remember.
“It’s...it’s normal, honestly. Of course there’s dust around and everything is old, but it’s not scary.” Draco didn’t want to pressure Harry, but his tone lightly suggested that Harry should go in.
“Shut up,” Draco snarled playfully. “Besides, it’s not a ‘big date.’ We’re just...you know...walking around. I may get something for my mother since I didn’t have the chance to the last time.”
Other than that, he kept a low profile. Well, as much as he could, give that he was dating the Boy Who Lived. Harry’s conversation with Ginny and the rest of the DA seemed to have changed some people’s attitude toward Draco. Mostly, he was ignored, which suited him perfectly fine. It was odd to bask in the comfort of no one caring about him when he spent so long trying to be the center of attention.
“First of all, I’d never hear the end of it if we taught a disarming spell for first years, as important as I believe it is. Second of all, I have full faith in you. We just need to try something else. Think of something you want to happen instead of something that has happened in your life.”
Just when he was starting to get comfortable at Hogwarts, he now was told to retreat back into his former self. He wanted to protect his mother more than anything. If he had to stay in his bedroom for the better part of his school days to do that, so be it. It wasn’t any different than what he did all summer, and what he would likely have to do for the rest of his life. Why he ever thought he could have friends like Goyle and even Potter, he had no idea.
“I’m not going to be anyone’s scorekeeper,” Blaise grumbled. “Especially not for a bunch of goody two-shoe Gryffindors.”
“Well, I can’t make your decision for you. All I can ask you to do is be kind to yourself. You’ve been so good about trying to be kinder to others—I think that you could do with that change as well.”
Finally, everyone had said their piece. A few times, Draco wanted to retreat far inside of himself, and his brain went fuzzy at the edges, trying to protect him from what he was feeling. Bringing himself back to the present was no easy task, but it was a necessary price to pay. Draco swallowed thickly as everyone looked at him. “I know words aren’t enough. But I’m really sorry. And if you ever need my help with anything, or if there’s anything at all I can do to make this better, just—just let me know.”
“That’s why you have to make them proud here. ‘What’s the point,’ you ask? The point is that you are here for a reason. You could be dead or in Azkaban, but you aren’t. I could be dead, but I’m not. We’re both right here, sitting next to each other for Merlin’s sake. I don’t think that just happens by chance.”
...of course Potter wouldn’t care about Draco’s parents. But he did care about Draco, didn’t he? He cared enough to search for him in sixth year until he found him crying in a bathroom. He cared enough to pull Draco on his broom in the Room of Requirement last May. For Merlin’s sake, he invited him out today!
“It’s not that he had something you didn’t. It’s just that...well I’d been around Muggles who hated me my whole life. I didn’t want to make friends with someone who did that to others.”
Crawling on three limbs, his injured arm pressed to his chest, in an attempt to avoid falling again, Draco made it to his room. With a very unsteady left hand he scribbled out what he hoped was a legible death-not-suicide note, and he drew the curtains around his bed. He rested his head on his pillow and let go of his right arm, feeling both mortified and incredibly relieved.
“Yes,” Draco said firmly. Sure, he didn’t deserve a single moment with the Boy Who Lived, who was perhaps the greatest person in the universe for reasons ignored by many. But as long as Harry wanted to be with him, Draco could never hurt him.
Draco was horrified and certainly did not want to find out what kind of mail he would get if people discovered that he was dating Harry Potter. They pushed open the door to the eighth-year dormitory having stopped holding hands, and people paid them little mind. The other eighth years seemed to be getting more used to the idea of Draco and Harry being friends. Everyone was too wrapped up in studies to notice them anyway.
“He’s doing worse, Draco. I don’t know how much longer he has, and his only son is refusing to see him.” Mr. Burke shook his head sadly.
“Blaise, it’s okay,” Draco put his hand on Blaise’s arm, not roughly as he used to do when Vincent and Gregory weren’t doing what he wanted, but enough to tell the Slytherin to back off. Blaise stepped aside, and Draco was face to face with Luna. He noticed that she looked a lot better than she did in his home. Her face had some color to it and was more full. Her eyes were always vibrant, even in captivity, but she looked more happy than he remembered. He wasn’t quite sure what to say. “Thanks, Lovegood.”
“You know, Malfoy,” Harry said Draco’s last name good-naturedly and shoved him teasingly. “I would even say we’re halfway to being mates. What a strange world it is.” And with a smile, Harry pushed open the door and walked toward where Hermione and Neville were playing Gobstones.
As he sat back, breathing deeply, he realized that part of him expected Harry to come in and comfort him. Apparently the sound of his retching hadn’t woken Harry this time. He hugged his knees and wiped his face, wanting some comforting. He wondered if it would be okay to wake Harry up and confess his terrible thoughts. At the same time, the thought of doing so made him even more nauseous. How could he date that same person that, only a year ago, he wished dead? Why would Harry want to date him, after a confession like that?
Draco moved to leave and then looked back at her for a moment. She seemed to have no intention of moving for quite a while as she pulled her knees up to her chest on the uncomfortable, wooden chair. “You terrify me,” he said suddenly, shaking as he pulled himself to his feet.
Where did the pureblood families belong? Was it okay to ask for help, was it okay to move on? Or should Draco leave people like Theo behind? Any choice felt extremely inauthentic. If Draco helped Theo, it may show people that he hadn’t learned anything from the war, that he was still a Death Eater sympathizer. If Draco didn’t help Theo, he would be an even worse friend than he already had been.
“Dragon?” A voice woke him up at what he felt like must have been a very early hour. He wiped his face as he heard his mother test the door carefully—she, too, had been subject to his makeshift barricades. “It’s time to get ready, sweetheart. Our escort will be here soon, and I’m already worried you won’t have time to eat breakfast.”
“Did any of you guys hear from Theo this summer?” Daphne asked. The boys shook their heads. “Me neither. I’ve always felt something was a little off about him last year. We all knew what you two and Vincent were up to,” she addressed Draco and Greg. “But Theo was so...quiet. We rarely saw him, too.”
Harry was so clueless that he just stared at Draco blankly. “Have you gone mad? Did you make all these blocks?”
“I know both your parents are alive, and that’s about it. I meet with them tomorrow. I’ll send you a letter if they ask me to pass anything along to you. Do you have anything you want me to say to them?”
Harry looked down as his face flushed red. “I’m so sorry, Draco, I know that you probably don’t want to be involved with me like that and I wanted to give you some space—“
“Oh, shoot! I’m so sorry,” Dean Thomas had spilled ice cold water on Draco, who had jumped up and was trying to stop it from damaging his suit jacket. “I was just taking this to my room and I guess I slipped. Here, let me help you, Malfoy.”
Harry looked confused. “Why not? You almost died, Draco, and everyone deserves the right to defend themselves—“
Draco’s head snapped up. He slowly took the wand from Potter’s outstretched hand, brushing his fingers up against Harry’s, and feeling something inside of him tingle.
Greg shook his head. “We’re not giving up on you, mate. And we’re not going to let you give up on us, either.” Daphne murmured agreement.
“It did! You’ve got some pretty shrewd friends. I rather enjoyed their company, especially given that they’re Slytherins,” Harry said jokingly.
When Harry and Draco entered their bedroom, it seemed that they were both unsure of what to do next. It was certainly unusual to be dating your roommate, and the beds were staring at them forebodingly. “Shall we each sit on our own?” Draco suggested awkwardly.
Draco has a heart-to-heart with Goyle, works with Harry on their DADA project, and meets with his lawyer.
Harry raised his eyebrows and grinned in a good morning to Draco, while George and Arthur gave him a polite nod before continuing with their conversation. This was just fine with Draco; in fact it was somewhat of a relief not to have to make conversation.
Finally, Ron put down his drink and gave a happy sigh. “I should be going now. But it was really nice to see you, Harry. I should be around soon to see Hermione, but feel free to come by the Burrow anytime. Malfoy, good to know that you’re not as big of a nuisance as you used to be. I hope that continues.” Ron gave Harry a hug and shook Draco’s hand.
The Burrow was likely the most bizarre building Draco had ever seen. It looked like multiple shacks stacked on top of each other, a dwelling that surely would collapse without the use of magic. Certainly everything Malfoy Manor wasn’t, the Burrow was warm and inviting. Pesky garden gnomes tried to smash Draco’s shoes as he walked up the rickety front porch, with Harry helping him with his trunk in front.
“Not a physical one, no. But I imagine you’ve gone through some pretty damaging things in the last year.”
“He’s hit his head,” he heard someone say. A large figure loomed over him, and then the worst of the pain was suddenly gone with a flick of someone’s wand. Draco sat up, feeling significantly better, but the world still swimming a bit. The first face he was able to see clearly was Harry’s.
“Lovely, no thanks necessary, I’m sorry but I’m running a bit late—“ Harry thankfully was able to escape this woman as well, but the onslaughts kept coming. Is this what Harry dealt with every time he went out? Draco was starting to wonder if maybe Harry was as trapped as he had been this summer.
Draco made it down in the depths of the Ministry without drawing suspicion. To his surprise, everyone was mostly milling about, chatting with each other excitedly, rather than in the courtroom. He stopped to listen to a reporter who was interviewing a member of the Wizengamot.
“About seven or so in the evening,” Madame Pomfrey said. “You came back about two hours ago and promptly fainted in Professor McGonagall’s office. She brought you down here.”
Harry sat next to Draco on his bed and put his arm around him. “I don’t think your mother wants to abandon you. Not at all. And just think, you’ll get to meet another relative tomorrow!”
“I do still mean to talk to Kingsley about your band there, though,” Harry said, nodding to the manacle on Draco’s wrist.
“Potter...he asked if any of our friends should come. He definitely does not think it’s a date.” Surprisingly, Draco’s friends looked disappointed when he said this.
“No,” Draco said. “There’s no need. I’m going to the Ministry tomorrow morning. I promise I’m just trying to get through the year. I have no clue who sent me the Time Turner or why.”
Harry looked at Draco for a second. “You really don’t know? You don’t know why I’m mad.” The last part was more of a statement than a question. Harry sighed. “Come with me.”
Draco suppressed a shudder at Harry saying the Dark Lord’s name, but the young man used it so nonchalantly nowadays that he was nearly used to it. “I still think he would have done something. You were always his favorite.”
What do you think is going to happen? What do you want to see in the next installment? Love you guys!
“It wouldn’t matter.” Draco was avoiding the question. “They don’t want to hear my apologies, they want...I don’t know, they want me to suffer I guess.”
Gossip may flitter back and forth, but it always seemed to center around Harry Potter in some way. Draco knew this was only the first of many negative interactions he would have about his relationship in the next few months, and he was already exhausted from it. But, students could be handled, or ignored.
Draco gave his mother a kiss on the cheek and then began to climb the stairs somewhat shakily. Not only did he have his father to think about seeing tomorrow, but the prospect of seeing Pansy and her family in a month was terrifying. Pansy Parkinson had been his oldest friend. They had met when they were babies, and because of their close birth dates, their parents thought that a marriage was destined in the stars for them. The two of them excited their families even further when they attended the Yule Ball together in their fourth year.
“UGH!” Draco yelled in frustration, and kicked one of the only pieces of furniture in the room. There was a hard wooden chair in the corner—the room had no windows. There was a table with a lamp, some parchment and quill, and a pitcher of water with a glass. There was also a file cabinet in the corner—locked, Draco soon found out.
“Of course not,” Gregory finally spoke up, meeting Draco’s eyes for the first time with fire in them that made Draco think he was seeing the ghost of Vincent. “Thanks to Saint Potter, Malfoy got off clean. The whole family, even though the lot of you deserve to rot.”
He tried to push it out of his head over the next few days. He and Harry were continuing with their lessons, both making some progress but Harry shining far brighter than Draco. Harry seemed extra focused after his visit to his parents’ grave, which had actually brightened his mood considerably, but Draco’s mind couldn’t be stilled.
Draco walked into class in a much better mood than he had started the day with, but with yet another weight on his shoulders.
“I’ll go next,” Dean Thomas spoke up, already glaring at Draco. “I was on the run for most of last year, traveling with various people who would get killed by the Snatchers. I got caught and was imprisoned at Malfoy Manor because I’m a Muggleborn. Malfoy over there was present for some of it, and he didn’t do a thing.” Draco didn’t want to move a muscle—he felt as though he were surrounded by angry werewolves.
“It’s not, really. He was the one who cast the Fiendfyre. Besides, I doubt we would have all made it out of the Battle alive.” Greg sighed. “Thank you though, for your apology. Everything just feels so messed up right now, I don’t know how anything is going to end up being alright.”
After brooding by the lake for the better part of the afternoon, Draco decided to go to the informal Quidditch game happening in the moonlight—but he was bringing his friends with him.Holding his old broom in his right hand, he felt somewhat optimistic about the evening. He was feeling much better physically after visiting Madame Pomfrey, and he was looking forward to playing Quidditch again. The sport had to be cancelled last year due to a lack of students interested in participating. Most of the older Gryffindors quit the team, Draco assumed in some kind of protest move, and the rest were often too injured and tired to be any good. Draco hadn’t actually stepped foot on the pitch for a long time.
I think we deserved a very fluffy chapter! So sorry for not having updated. It has been really crazy, as I’m sure you can imagine. We only have a few more chapters in this installment before we’re done! What would you all like to see next? More of Harry and Draco, or something else? Maybe a time jump? Let me know. As always, all comments are appreciated. I love you all and I hope you’re staying safe.
“I guess it’s just more complicated than that.” Harry offered Draco a tight smile, signaling to Draco that the conversation was over.
He sighed. “Fine, I guess you’re right. We need to be a team.” He looked back at Draco. “I kind of understand what you’re saying. It’s just really overwhelming sometimes, you know? How much we did...”
“I’ll have to come by and visit soon, if only just to get a decent meal.” Harry turned to Draco, trying to integrate him into the conversation. “Mrs. Weasley is one of the best cooks I’ve ever met. She can make just a simple soup and it’ll still be the greatest thing you’ve ever tasted.”
Noticing Draco’s discomfort, Harry changed the subject. “Could you imagine our faces a few years ago if we told ourselves that we were sitting at a restaurant together, holding hands?”
I am SO sorry for how long it’s been! I’m a campaign manager, so things have been crazy with the upcoming election. But I hope everyone is staying safe. This story is almost complete! I’m still trying to decide what will be next—another part to this one, or something else entirely. But there will be something!
Greg nodded, to Blaise and Daphne’s displeasure, and set the letter on fire. Draco felt a little ill. He was wondering if Theo truly did want to bring back the Dark Lord, or if the younger Nott was experiencing the kind of anxiety that Draco had for the past two years.
better. And that’s what counts. Even Ginny has noticed. Yeah, she may never forgive you, but she doesn’t hate you, Draco. If more people knew you and took the time to listen to you, they would realize that you truly are a better person. And I’m proud of you for that.” Harry squeezed Draco’s fingertips and he couldn’t help but give a wince at the dull ache that increased suddenly. “Now, we should get you to the Hospital Wing.”
Harry Potter gave Draco a wry smile as he looked at their surroundings. “I promise not to slice you open if you promise not to attempt to torture me.”
“Yes, he came to the Manor. It certainly surprised us when he knocked on our door, but we let him inside. He claimed that he needed to talk to us about something important, something that could impact both of our children.” Narcissa choked up on the last word. “We served him tea, and he explained that our sons were not safe in this world. He said that his son, Theodore Jr., was in hiding abroad, and that he couldn’t believe we allowed Draco to return to Hogwarts. He claimed that he had a way of...allowing our families to have better standing. To allow our children to have better lives. All we had to do was abandon our home save for a few key items and come with him. He said that we could have Draco back in our arms within weeks.”
“You being his son doesn’t mean that you need to take everything he throws at you. You’re allowed to protect yourself.”
Most of the room groaned at the realization that their relationship with their roommates did not end in the dormitory. However, Draco found that he was a little relieved. He and Potter have been able to get along quite well over the past day, and at least Draco knew that he was safe with Potter.
“No, listen,” Harry said roughly as he paced. “You—you just left! You just left. You didn’t tell me where you were going or what you were planning on doing. You just up and left. After hearing all that about the Time Turner, after being accosted constantly in the hallways, my nerves were already on fire. And then you just leave when you knew I couldn’t follow you.”
Draco hadn’t realized how much his behavior had affected Harry. After a moment he spoke, sure that he wasn’t finding quite the right words. “You’re right. I should have at least told you my intentions. I’m really sorry.”
“I remember reading that one of the students that passed was in your year. Vincent Crabbe, right? Were you two close?”
Draco had to control himself not to run outside. He made sure he went a few paces closer into the Forbidden Forest, not wanting to run into any of the others heading back to the school. Taking large gulps of the cold air wasn’t helping. Every breath he took seemed not to enter his lungs but his stomach, and he put a hand on it to try and steady himself. He stumbled against the nearest tree and sunk down into the grass, which was wet with forming dew. His teeth clenched together and he tried his best to keep his tongue from getting hurt—but even the mere thought of his tongue caused him to vomit on the ground.
on the day of his trial) but could not place him. All in all, his first outing was not going too poorly. Draco leaned against a pillar out of sight, to lurk and people-watch.
“Wonderful,” McGonagall seemed oblivious to his rage. “That will be your appointment slot for the next three weeks. If you wish to continue after that, you may, but it will not be required.”
Harry gave a small smile. “Of course.” Draco let out a huge sigh of relief. “But no funny business,” Harry joked as he climbed next to Draco. With a flick of his wand, Harry turned the lights off, and lightly touched Draco’s hand under the covers. Draco was glad that it was dark and Harry couldn’t see how much he was blushing.
“Oh, right. Crabbe. Almost forgot about that. I heard he was too stupid to control his spell and killed himself. Not a bad death for such a buffoon. Good riddance, too.” Dean’s voice was ice cold and Draco could tell he chose his words deliberately.
“—so you better make sure you’re serious about all this before you get too far. It’s not going to be easy. People on your end are going to be angry with Draco, people on our end are going to be uncomfortable since you two can’t produce an heir. They may think you’re holding something over Draco’s head, too, since you’re not even a pureblood. If you’re not ready for the full wrath of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, you may as well tell us now and take your leave.” While Draco certainly didn’t like Daphne claiming that he wasn’t actually tough, she had a point about the pureblood families. He remained silent while Harry contemplated this.
“That would be enormously foolish,” Professor McGonagall said, but it wasn’t a ‘no’. “And complicated. I’m not sure it could even be done, and I know that it shouldn’t be done. Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, have you apologized to them?”
Harry looked amused. “You look like you belong on the streets of Paris, smoking a pipe and solving a mystery.”
“Alright everyone,” Potter got their attention. “Thanks for coming out tonight. I just figured this would be a fun way to blow off some steam and end the week. I know many of you haven’t been on a Quidditch team before, and that’s okay. We’re just going to have fun.”
After a few moments of silence, Blaise spoke up, a look of anger on his face. “If he is a prat to you, you let me know and I’ll kill him.”
“I’m fine,” Lucius said, embarrassed. He never liked being doted on. Even when he would get sick when Draco was a kid, he shrugged off Narcissa’s attempts at assistance and carried on with his duties. “Even in spite of these poisons they’re making me take.” He gestured to the potions on the side table.
“You don’t know a damn thing about me or my family, Weasley. If you think the Dark Lord is terrifying, try having him in your home for a year.”
Having finally gotten away, Draco took one more look at Harry before he left. He actually felt pretty good. Talking to Harry about the Weasley’s had made him realize how much pain lingered in them all. If he felt as bad as he did, not having lost anyone too significant in the war, he couldn’t imagine how Ginny felt.
The train ride back wasn’t nearly as anxiety inducing as it had been a few days ago. Draco didn’t feel so alone—he felt like he could rely on his mother for emotional care again. Although thinking about his father sent nervous pains through his heart, he knew that he wanted to make it through this. During the war he had been almost indifferent about his own survival. He had just gone through the motions, not having the energy to do much of anything. But he wanted this relationship with Harry to work more than he wanted anything in his life. And he was going to make that happen, whether Lucius was in the picture or not.
Now it was Draco’s turn to touch Harry’s arm, though he did so hesitantly and with a shaking hand. “That’s awful. I’m serious. Even you, the biggest prick I know, didn’t deserve that.”
Draco and Harry deal with some fallout from their little outing. Draco also gets very ill, leading to another flashback
With a flick of her wand, Madame Pomfrey transferred Draco’s diagnostic results to a piece of parchment. “There are a few things of concern that we need to address here. You’re still recovering from blood loss, so I’m going to have you take one Blood Replenishing potion today, but that should be all that is necessary. You also appear to have some vitamin and iron deficiencies, so I’ll give you nutrient potions for that. You need to improve your diet though, you are also underweight. Additionally, you appear to have some nerve damage.”
“Enjoying yourself?” Draco startled at Ginny’s voice and dropped the sheet of paper, then quickly shifted it away from the flames.
He found Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabini, and Gregory Goyle boarding a carriage together. He quickly hopped on before the thestrals trotted away.
“Ahh...” the Ravenclaw gave a humorless laugh and smirk. “You don’t remember me, do you? Don’t remember torturing me for nearly half an hour?” His voice quieted as he took a step forward. “Maybe I should do the same to you...”
Draco was thankfully that Harry couldn’t see him at that moment. He took off his jacket, feeling warm from blushing.
. How in the world was this going to work? He cluthced his stomach, trying not to vomit. He could still smell smoke and charring flesh, he could hear Vincent screaming—
Harry put his hand on Draco’s left arm, which tingled where his scar remained from the Mark. He gripped it tightly and spoke in an even tone. “Don’t go there, Malfoy. Don’t.” Draco was confused at his sudden disappointment when Potter used his last name. “Look, I’m sorry for snooping, but I thought you were up to something since you were acting so weird. And, well...” he trailed off. Both men looked at their feet for a long time.
“Like, how public is this going to be? How often should I take you out? How often should we reexamine the relationship? The standard stuff.”
His stomach turned—he had not eaten much at the banquet but it was certainly enough for a whole day—maybe two. He was thinking about his classes from last year—the information that is, trying to refresh himself on spells and potions before continuing his education, when he felt himself jerk awake.
Everyone sat in silence for a few moments. Draco was used to his parents occasionally bickering, but about nothing as serious as this. He almost willed the escort to come back in and announce that the half hour had passed. This was too reminiscent of what happened nearly every day for the past two years when he and his parents were together—tense silence.
“It’s not a cure, exactly. Mental ailments can’t be cured, but the effects can be reduced significantly. There are dozens of Muggle studies—“
Draco pictured the moment just days ago when Harry told Draco that he loved him. He felt the crisp air of the snowy day and the gleam in Harry’s eyes as he spoke. In his mind, he ran his hand along Harry’s lips, becoming chapped from the cold. He felt calm and peaceful.
“Over there on the kitchen counter. Brewed the Muggle way by Granger. It’s not that bad though. There are some crumpets too, if you want.” Daphne looked a little tired, with her long black hair pulled back into braids not concealing the bags under her eyes. Goyle was silent beside her, not even looking at Draco.
“Psh. Speak for yourself, Potter,” Draco said good-naturedly. He pulled off the cloak and reached into his long trench coat. He got out some glasses with the frames cut out, a long scarf, and a beret which managed to hide his platinum blonde hair. “There. People won’t know who I am unless they look really closely, and thankfully it is perfectly acceptable to wear berets indoors.”
“Yeah,” Harry choked out. “Thanks, Draco. I’ll see you later.” Draco heard Harry’s footsteps as he left the classroom.
Draco went back to Hogwarts and immediately sent the application back to Mr. Burke, with only his mother’s name on it.
“No, thank you Mother. I’ll be ready in a few minutes.” He was embarrassed to admit that he still had problems eating at times. He hoped that part of it was just being in the Manor, trying to find somewhere to eat where he hadn’t been, but he also felt like he should be over that by now. The past was the past, and he was a Malfoy. Although, he wasn’t sure what being a Malfoy meant anymore. He often found himself wishing that his father had either defied the Dark Lord or was a successful Death Eater. Draco didn’t know how to interpret the fact that his father lay cowardly in between good and evil.
Dean and Ginny shared a look, and then Dean went to a nearby table and picked up a small package. He handed it to Draco—it had his name on it in familiar handwriting. Draco turned it over and found that the seal had been broken. He looked inside to see a small clock hanging on a golden chain...
“They really are family to me.” Harry continued telling Draco about his first experiences at the Burrow, and how he felt that the small and cramped house was the most perfect place in the entire world. He talked about how protective Mrs. Weasley was, often to a fault, of him, and how special it made him feel. How he thought that no one was going to show up for him at the Triwizard Tournament, but that the Weasleys were there. As Draco listened, planting kisses on his cheek whenever a drop of water would fall there, he felt like he finally knew what to do.
“So what, you’re just supposed to sit back, lock yourself in your room and do nothing? You’re eighteen Draco, you deserve to live your life.”
“I don’t take glee in it, Draco. Not a bit.” They were both silent for a moment. “How would you like to honor him? Or Goyle, what does he think?”
“5798.” The wizard retrieved the application, then stamped it. After Yarney signed some paperwork, the wizard handed him two cloaks.
Harry looked at Draco, who bit his lip but nodded. He didn’t want to draw attention to himself by saying he didn’t want to go. Hopefully either Madame Rosmerta wasn’t working right now, or she wouldn’t recognize him. After all, she had been under the influence nearly every time she saw him.
“That’s probably true...” Smith said, hand on his chin. “What about your parents though, Malfoy? They’re out of Azkaban—well, for now. Do they know?”
He felt like he couldn’t even be elated yet. It was only a matter of time before Potter would surely change his mind and realize what he had gotten himself into. Draco just had to savor the moments until that day came. And he vowed to himself to soak up every touch. Maybe if he gathered enough, he could put the pieces together and make a happy memory.
There were murmurs going around the court. Some of this was known from Draco’s trials, but some was new information. Certainly some of it was new information for Harry Potter, who looked at Draco under the Invisibility Cloak. Draco felt the familiar sick feeling and started to shake.
Finally the doors shut, and it seemed like the trial was about to begin. Draco and Harry carefully coordinated sitting down, and Harry grabbed Draco’s hand, stroking the palm with his thumb. Draco couldn’t speak without drawing attention, but he wasn’t sure he would be able to anyway. He was filled with fear for his parents and an overwhelming sense of appreciation and adoration for the man sitting next to him.
“I don’t know what happened. I had a conversation with him a short while before he started acting oddly,” Greg whispered. “We talked about some heavy stuff, and since we were talking about Vince I told him I was gay. Do you think that’s why he’s being all weird?”
Draco gripped the back of the chair in front of McGonagall’s desk and leaned on it heavily, feeling like he may pass out. Professor McGonagall stood up and helped him sit. He sat breathing heavily for a few minutes, unable to think, unable to move—he could only try his best to contain the anxiety deep inside of him.
Flickers of last year went through his mind as he ran around corners of the castle. He had been required to return to Malfoy Manor every weekend in order to help the Dark Lord and attend the Death Eater meetings. He remembered hearing her screams as she was tortured, refusing to give any sort of information on Potter’s whereabouts. Once he had remarked to his father that she probably had no clue where Potter was, and for that he earned a clubbing on the arm with Lucius’s cane.
Harry nodded as the stumbled back toward the castle. Everyone else was at classes, so it was blissfully empty of wary stares. “So what do you want to do?”
So sad :( We’ll have to make sure there’s some fluff next chapter! As always, let me know what you guys think. Lots of love!
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He had no comforting words—how could he? His parents were in Azkaban, he was hanging on by a thread, and apparently former Death Eaters were out to capture him. For now, the most he could do was sit with Greg in this uncertain space. Both boys took comfort in knowing they were not alone.
“Absolutely,” Harry said. “Don’t sell yourself short, Draco. You’re really fun to be around. And I’m really proud of you for the way you handled everything—well, apart from immediately turning to alcohol when you felt sad. Next time, just come and talk to me, okay?”
After spending the better part of the night begging morning to come, the sun shone far too soon for Draco’s liking. Something inside of him lifted after he broke his own wand, and he was able to get a few hours of quiet sleep. Though he knew this was good for his body, his mind felt fuzzy and was pleading for more rest now that it had gotten a little taste.
Draco kept his eyes on the ground. He knew that one of the Weasley twins had been killed in the battle, and he also knew that he had mercilessly teased the Weasleys for years. He couldn’t bear to meet Ron’s eyes.
“Yeah, sure it did. Potter, choosing whether to share a room with you or an elephant would be a hard decision indeed, but I certainly don’t deserve to room with both.” Draco rubbed his eyes, trying to work up some energy.
“Yes,” Narcissa said to herself. “Yes, and you need to stay at Hogwarts, do you hear me? No more Hogsmeade trips, at least not for a while. I know that’s probably not how you want to spend your eighth year, all cooped up in your room, but I promise you it will be worth it once all this is over.”
They both sat staring at each other, communicating more with their eyes than words could ever say. They were only interrupted by a Ravenclaw battle cry as twirling, charmed snowballs hit Draco right in the face. Harry laughed, and led Draco into battle.
Draco fell asleep on his couch that night—he felt like he would have been at war with himself in the bed. Though some chilly air was sneaking in through the window, he only wrapped himself in Harry’s jacket. This time, it did prevent nightmares.
Draco looked around, waiting for his father’s gaze watching him reproachfully, making sure he didn’t misstep. The Astronomy Tower was blissfully empty, though. He knew he was taking a long time to respond, but Luna just smiled up at him, waiting patiently.
Draco wasn’t exactly trying to be funny, but Harry laughed anyway. “That is true. You did complain about me for a full ten minutes, and I couldn’t even get a word in to contribute.” He looked thoughtful for a moment. “You know that you’re a really good friend now, right? They care about you a lot.”
“Yes, but it wasn’t your fault. You have nothing to apologize for.” Blaise looked straight ahead, gritting his teeth.
“Shush.” Draco clasped his icy hand over Harry’s mouth. “You’re going to give away our position. We’ve only got five minutes, I reckon, before the ambush.”
Harry hurriedly led Draco upstairs to Kingsley Shacklebolt’s office, where presumably the others were waiting. Draco was shaking, knowing that he didn’t have the emotional capacity to handle any snide remarks at this point, but his small disguise worked well enough for him to escape notice. Harry, though, was not so lucky.
—and his heart shattered. He pulled away, the movement awkward both with his embarrassment and illness. “Right. I understand.”
“I can meet with you tomorrow, Mr. Potter. There are still many people I need to talk with tonight about what transpired today. Goodnight, you two.” Professor McGonagall shut the door, leaving Harry and Draco looking at each other blankly.
He was never sure if during these attacks he actually fell unconscious or just became unaware of what was happening. But the next thing Draco knew, he was shivering and his head was aching. Nausea overcame him, and he heaved into the toilet, miserably wiping his face, which was already wet with tears.
“One who probably hates my guts. And who has a little one who will hate my guts, once he finds out what I’ve done.”
Finally he finished his story and was gasping, Harry still rubbing circles on his back. “Malfoy,” Harry said, causing Draco to look at him suddenly—he didn’t often use Draco’s last name. “That’s awful. I’m serious. You don’t deserve that.”
Draco laughed. “No poison for me anymore, I just burn letters from people I don’t know straight away now. No, I’m fine.”
“Actually, mum, I’m really tired. Is there any chance we could talk about this later?” Draco met her concerned eye. “I promise I’m not angry or anything, this is just...a lot to think about.”
He tried to summon the happiest memories of his life. Riding on his toy broom as a child with his father and mother cheering him on. The first time he played the piano. Meeting Vincent and Gregory in his primary school academy. Winter balls at Pansy’s house where the kids snuck out to go sledding at night. His pride at being sorted into Slytherin. Lazy summers in Italy and France with his parents, back when they were happy and in love.
He always wondered what spell Potter had cast on that fateful day—it was so unlike him to do something that...violent. Though, Draco had been about to torture him.
It was then that Draco realized how little his friends actually asked him for advice. “It seems like you made the right decision.”
Looking around, Draco saw Gregory Goyle, also skulking near the back of the train station. He, too, was alone; his father was in Azkaban, and Draco was not sure where his mother was. He looked thinner than Draco had ever seen him—likely Vincent Crabbe’s death did a number on him. But at least Draco knew he would have one friend to help him survive the year. He mustered his face into what he hoped was a friendly and warm expression. Greg caught his eye, and Draco nodded encouragingly. Gregory Goyle glared at him and turned away.
“They went back inside. It’s about eleven now, they didn’t want to break curfew. But I think McGonagall can make an exception for me. Your friends really did want to stay though, we practically had to drag Goyle away.”
I’m so excited for you guys to read the last two chapters of this part! I don’t have them written yet but I know what’s going to happen. I know that you guys wanted the other students to realize more what Draco went through, so I decided to have him do a little confession. How do you think they’ll treat him now? What do you hope to see in the next part of the series?
“How many days? I guess tomorrow will be the fifth.” Harry sighed and settled on the bed next to Draco, who revered in his closeness. “You’re an unlucky bloke, Draco. I guess you had a paper cut or something? So the poison got into your bloodstream. You’d be better by now if it were just on the surface of your skin, though that would have made you sick too. Magic spells aren’t working on your body as well, that’s why it’s taking you so long to heal. Madame Pomfrey has even had to use Muggle methods.” Draco suppressed a shudder—he was not prejudiced anymore. Muggle methods were fine. “And that’s why it’s really important that you rest. I can’t believe you walked up seven flights of stairs to come see me.” Harry shook his head, but Draco could see he was suppressing a smile.
“It’s alright,” Harry told him gently. “Sit down. I talked with Professor McGonagall this morning. And with Ginny, last night.”
As soon as four figures entered the tent with ease, Draco knew it was one of the enchanted ones that wizards often carted around to sporting events. The inside had plenty of practices areas as well as places to lounge. It was still no larger than the eighth year common room, but sufficient for the size of the group. Draco was sat in a hard wooden chair, and the members of Dumbledore’s Army stood off to the side. Draco recognized Zacharias Smith, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Dean Thomas, and a few other younger students whose faces he recognized but could not name. Ginny stood directly in front of Draco with her arms crossed. They all sat in silence for a few moments, which unnerved Draco more than anything else.
Draco scoffed. “The day that you go to Hogwarts and anyone can relax is the day that Kneazles will take to the skies.”
“For the better part of the last year of his life, yeah.” Then Harry looked quizzical. “How do you know it’s on Grimmauld Place?”
“Just make sure it’s a good enough one,” Blaise chimed in. “I got one of those for my thirteenth birthday and its magic ended up wearing out right as I was about to catch one of my mother’s husbands cheating on her.”
After quickly making himself presentable, Draco walked downstairs to a loud dine-in kitchen. George Weasley was talking to Arthur and Harry about the latest Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products while Ginny was eating some pancakes. Mrs. Weasley immediately straightened when she saw Draco, and shoved him into a chair that already had a full plate.
“Oi! Get up!” Draco barely had time to register what was happening before a rough hand took him by the shoulder and pulled him up. “I don’t got all day!”
Draco wasn’t sure he could possibly move yet. He felt just as paralyzed as he did when he was on the ground with a bleeding nose.
Still shaky from the nightmare, Draco’s heart dropped into his stomach. He was almost back at Hogwarts, the place where he planned his Headmaster’s death and almost executed it, the place where he tortured first years—don’t think about it don’t think about it don’t think about it
As he put his hand on the door handle, though, he realized he couldn’t leave either. What if there were people waiting to see if Potter came out, and they saw him? What jeers would he have to endure then? He would certainly deserve them, he knew. But he didn’t want to face it. He was a coward. And he was trapped.
The two spent the rest of the day frequenting the smaller shops around Hogsmeade. Many of the store managers kept a wary eye on Draco, but their anger with him seemed to be balanced out with their reverence for Harry. The two certainly made an interesting pair, and Draco kept an eye out for press. If something came out, he might even be grateful that his parents were in Azkaban and wouldn’t be able to see the tabloids. Draco was also able to get a necklace for his mother—a beautiful and pure emerald on a golden chain, to reminder her that she was a Slytherin through and through.
“It’s...somewhat unclear,” Professor McGonagall spoke gently and poured Draco a cup of tea. “Potentially perjury. Obstruction of the investigation. There was also a rumor that there were suspicious artifacts in your house not handed over to the Ministry to begin with.”
Draco was reminded of the manacle still on his wrist. If his father chose to attack him, there would be nothing he could do. “I will live my life as I see fit, Father.”
After a few moments taking in the comfort of Harry’s scent, Draco leaned back in the chair and wiped his eyes. “Shouldn’t we get back to the trial?” He wiped his eyes with his sleeve.
“I didn’t know that, either. I always assumed you were constantly surrounded by people who worshipped your very presence.”
“No, it wasn’t,” Gregory Goyle stood up and sat next to Draco. “You’re an actual human being, I don’t know if you know that, but you are. I saw you wither away these past two years on the inside but become even more of a prick on the outside to compensate. It’s nice to know that you actually have a heart.”
“I’ll tell you what I’m going through, then,” the heat wasn’t helping Draco’s anger. “This is literally the last place on Earth I want to be right now and the last thing I want to be doing, but I don’t have a choice because if I don’t sit here and talk to you, I might get chucked into Azkaban along with my parents. I wouldn’t even care if I got sent to Azkaban, but I don’t want them to punish my mother even more. So once again, I’m trapped in a goddamn room, and everyone’s acting like I have a choice in the matter even though I don’t. I never have. Even now that the war’s over, it’s like I’m out of the frying pan and into the fire,” Draco stopped to catch his breath, having ranted without taking one. He closed his eyes and clenched his fist. He felt as though he could feel the Fiendfyre inside the room.
“Here we are,” Hermione stopped in front of a door with a gold number eight on it. “This door is not actually password protected—it knows our hands when we touch the doorknob. That way we can invite in whoever we want, as long as they have permission of one eighth-year.” She led them all inside the spacious grounds. The common room was mostly red, but had areas of each color. It had a small kitchen, plenty of seating, and board games in the corner. Window seats were adorned with pillows and had bookshelves below. The space looked lovely, but unfortunately for Draco, very open. There were few nooks and crannies in which to hide or skulk. He would have to keep to his room.
“It’s hard to write,” Ginny said softly. Everyone stopped murmuring to look at her. “For a lot of reasons. Mainly because of how many times you and your friends put me under the Cruciatus curse last year. My hands shake. And sometimes the words move across the page and distort themselves because of the stupid diary your father put into my cauldron when we were young. Do you know how it feels to be possessed? Every night I run through everything I did that day to make sure I remember each hour, to make sure there are no gaps.”
Draco bit his lip as he filled out his mother’s name—he wanted to see her for sure. But what about Lucius? Draco wondered if he would be able to contain his anger if he saw his father. No—he should see his father; whatever wrath came out of him at that time was what Lucius deserved. He slammed the quill down and finished the application.
Draco shook his head. “I have no idea. My lawyer isn’t telling me anything, no one is.” He pressed his palms against his eyes and sighed. “I’m sorry to disturb your nap, Potter. Thanks for listening to my tale of woe. I can pay you for your time, if you’d like.”
Draco lay back on Greg’s bed and listened as his friends talked about both incredibly large problems and meaningless things. Their voices lulled him to sleep, as his body wrestled with both an intense fear for his and his parents’ future, and an intense love for the people he still had in his life.
“I’m sorry, I know it’s late,” he heard Harry speak, but not to him. “But he’s having a massive panic attack and I think he’s got hypothermia.”
“No,” Draco shook his head. He took a peek outside—it was probably around dinner time. “I’m not that hungry, though.” His stomach filled with dread at the thought of going to the Great Hall right now.
Draco was frustrated by how often lately he had been speechless. “Lovegood, you shouldn’t be thanking me,” he finally said, looking down at his feet. “You were imprisoned in the dungeon. I’m—“
Draco managed a small smile. “What time is it anyway?” He wanted to change the subject since he wasn’t able to quite believe what Harry was saying.
. He had never before been in complete control over a decision. Most of his life had been ruled by his father, or the Dark Lord, or the expectations that come with being a Malfoy. But this? Granger was right. This was all him. Suddenly, Draco didn’t feel that he could wait a moment longer to tell Harry how he felt. He abandoned his half-made cup of tea, and stopped to thank Granger over his shoulder. She was smiling.
Draco looked at Greg in time to see a tear roll down his cheek, and then quickly looked away. “Draco, there’s something you don’t know.”
“Draco,” Harry said seriously. “I know how you feel. I was worried for the longest time that I was an outsider, intruding on the Weasley’s. But they’ve welcomed me like one of their own. I truly feel like they’re my family.”
“Oh, hello Blaise. Draco and I never finished our conversation the other day, and I want to make sure that he knows I accept his apology.”
She had a pitying look on her face—Draco couldn’t stand it. “Mr. Malfoy, your parents have been sent to Azkaban.”
“As some of you know, St. Mungo’s has started to put more of an emphasis on mental health. They’re partnering with Muggle-Born wizards to train mind healers, since the Muggles are far ahead of wizards on this sort of research.” Blaise rolled his eyes beside Draco. “Some of us already see these healers. I do.”
I’m SO sorry this is late! I literally got held up trying to think of who in the world would teach DADA after the war. Everyone is dead! So I had to make an OC which I’m not a fan of. Luckily they’re just a plot device. Hope to have the next chapter out in a few days! As always, your comments are lovely and help me keep going
“We’re all adults now. Theo needs to make his own decisions,” Blaise added, doubling down on his opinion. “I doubt it’s your fault. Even if it were a tiny bit your fault, trying to fix that mess would undo a lot of the work you’ve done here.”
“Hey—“ Harry stopped him in his tracks. Draco hadn’t noticed he had been furiously rubbing at his left arm, which was as much of a nervous tic as Harry rubbing his forehead was. “It’s going to be okay. Even if you don’t manage to cast a full Patronus during the presentation, it’ll still prove that you learned something.”
Now Harry was the one staring wistfully outside. Draco’s heart clenched every time Harry mentioned the horrible Dursley’s. It was almost too painful to hear about, but Draco knew his pain must be nothing in comparison to how Harry felt talking about it. Draco had learned to be quiet when Harry brought up memories from hips childhood. At first, Draco blamed anyone he could—Dumbledore, the Weasleys, anyone that had knowledge of how Harry was being treated and chose to do nothing about it. Then Draco realized that his anger wasn’t helping Harry. Harry needed a safe person who would listen without judgement. But Draco would give anything if Harry could have some of his childhood back.
“What are you doing?” A sharp voice called, startling him nearly to the ground. Ginny Weasley stepped out from behind a tree, her wand shining in Draco’s face. The blinding light obscured her facial expression, but Draco knew it couldn’t be friendly.
“Let the Death Eater speak for himself, Harry,” Ernest Macmillan spoke up next to Justin. He was a blood traitor, and was therefore also on the receiving end of some Unforgivables last year. “Why the hell are you here anyway, Malfoy? Were you hoping to become Head Boy again so you could terrorize the school like last year?” Draco and Pansy Parkinson were Head Boy and Girl respectively under Professor Snape, but their duties became very different than what they normally would have been. Instead of providing guidance to new students and making sure everyone enjoyed themselves at Hogwarts, they patrolled the hallways at night, listening for conversations against the Dark Lord.
“She’s strong, Draco. You know that. Her love for you is the strongest part of her, too. She’ll make it through to see you again. I promise,” Daphne put a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Professor McGonagall’s words echoed in his head later that night as he lay next to Harry. He kept going back and forth from being terrified at the power that Dumbledore’s Army had over him to almost laughing at the ridiculousness of it all. They were all students, they should finally be worrying about their exams and their future. He didn’t understand why they couldn’t put all this behind him.
As always, comments are much appreciated. If I don’t respond to your comment, I have certainly acknowledged it and read it, but sometimes it’s hard for me to take criticism on a piece that I write just for fun. I’m not a professional writer and these are my takes on the characters. You absolutely do not have to like them, but please be kind! Love you all.
He ran into the bathroom that he and Harry shared with Neville and Greg. He ran his arm under the warm water, but the blood kept coming. The healing spell for something like this was quite easy, but Draco could threaten his probation if he cast even a simple charm. He wasn’t even sure if the manacle on his wrist would allow him to do so. But the wound wouldn’t stop bleeding until the spell was cast.
Draco felt restless and helpless. He decided to go out into the common room and get a cup of tea. He flung his covers aside and closed the bedroom door behind him, not bothering to be soft so as not to wake Harry.
“No, we can just go to Hogsmeade, or even Diagon Alley if you want to avoid the other students. I just want to spend time with you, that’s all.”
“I am,” Lucius responded, almost defensively. “But I’m more interesting in how you are doing. Have you enjoyed your extra year at Hogwarts?”
“I think you would know if you had responded to any of my letters, Mr. Malfoy,” Draco had not noticed Professor McGonagall approaching their table. She now addressed everyone. “I suspected some of you may want to end your night early. You will not be receiving your class schedules tomorrow, as we are still working some of that out. However, we will be having a discussion about your freedoms as past of-age students, and the responsibilities that come with those freedoms. Ms. Granger will be serving as the Head Girl of your year, and Mr. Longbottom will be serving as Head Boy. Ms. Granger, could you show everyone to their quarters?” Hermione nodded.
“Well, they’re not gone. But they do happen a lot less often, and when they do, I can wake up, think about it for a bit, and then go back to bed pretty easily. If you don’t want to go see a Mind Healer that’s fine, but you should talk to someone about the nightmares.” Draco was silent. He wasn’t sure he had anyone to talk to. “If you don’t have anyone, you can talk to me.”
Draco did not wait for Professor McGonagall to return—no doubt she thought the meeting would take longer than the five minutes that Draco spent being scolded. Instead, he walked out of her office numbly, nearly stumbling down the gargoyle steps. What had just happened? Had he really been shut out of his parents’ trial, just because he wanted to enjoy his life?
Draco had decided not to tell Harry about his nightmare the previous night, or about the encounter he had with Ginny Weasley. Apparently she decided to also keep it a secret, because Harry didn’t mention anything to him. Time passed normally throughout the rest of the week. Draco and Harry did make a conscious effort to increase the amount of time they spent together in public to test the waters. Harry would go to dinner with his friends on the earlier side and then would stay for Draco and his friends. Draco assured Harry that his avoidance of seeing Hermione and Neville wasn’t due to dislike, but because he wanted to avoid jeers from others. Blaise, Daphne, and Greg were really coming around to like Harry, though. Harry and Greg both had a soft side, and he could bicker playfully with Blaise for the whole meal. Daphne and Harry didn’t speak much, but she was always kind to him.
Sleep, sadly, did not come easily to Draco that night. He tossed and turned for a bit, trying to calm himself using the sound of Potter’s even breathing and occasional mumbling. When he finally drifted off into sleep, fire consumed him. He was back in the Room of Requirement with Vincent, but this time Potter chose to fly away on his broom rather than save him. The Fiendfyre closed in on Draco, and every time he gasped for breath he inhaled the flames. He saw Greg and Vincent’s faces melt next to him, and he was next.
Draco, still catching his breath, slammed the lid of his trunk down in frustration. Stupid Potter. I don’t need his help.
And so, Draco invited his friends into his room and back into his life. They talked for hours about things both large and small, and he felt his heart grow with the ebb and flow of the conversation. Possibly the new family the remaining Slytherins had made would fill the gap in his heart that his parents once occupied.
“With that being said,”Granger continued. “We wanted to take today to publicize chances for healing. There’s going to be a group for eighth years that meets every Monday at seven. There’s one for each year, and it’s just an informal thing so that everyone can feel as though they aren’t alone. All of you are welcome.”
“I was trying to talk sense into Madame Rosmerta. She said that she’d be willing to let you enter her pub as soon as your parents are retried and she knows that...that you’re not up to anything.”
, until we know more information. But you have to be ready to leave everything behind at a moment’s notice. If he puts his plans in motion, we’ll escape to one of the villas. Start a new life abroad.”
. Draco squirmed uncomfortably at this realization. “Therapy has become quite common in the Muggle world.” Draco couldn’t help but scoff.
Draco sighed, becoming a little agitated with all the circling around different plans. He was also still emotionally exhausted—his meeting with Mr. Burke felt like it was a year ago and he hadn’t been able to relax since. “I appreciate everyone’s help, but if it’s not possible, it’s fine.”
It was extremely fitting to him. A Malfoy dying not a heroic death, not even a notorious death of a villain, but a completely avoidable, mediocre death.
“How can you say that to him?” Hermione was furious. “He just saved your life and you’re being rude to him!”
It seemed that Harry could read his mind, because he looked at Draco with affection as they made their way down the halls. “I know you’re risking a lot by doing this with me, and I really appreciate it. I hope I get to make it up to you somehow.”
Draco had Alchemy this morning while Harry had Ancient Runes. Normally they wouldn’t see each other until the end of the day, or possibly at mealtimes. Draco was certainly happy at the surprise encounter, but also nervous—he certainly wasn’t the best version of himself today, not at all the person that he wanted Harry to see. But what else could he say? “Of course,” and Harry fell in step beside him.
However, Monday came soon enough and hit Draco like a bunch of bricks. He heard Harry get up to head to the Great Hall before him, as usual. Draco usually waited until about an hour after Harry left to go himself to avoid any unwanted conversations with students at breakfast. This time, however, Harry rushed back into their room while Draco was getting ready for the day.
Potter met his gaze and serious tone. “Dean put a Stinging Hex on your arm so that you wouldn’t get the Snitch. I don’t even think he meant for you to think...I think he just didn’t want you to win. That’s all.”
“It doesn’t matter! You didn’t need any of your own magic to curse Katie Bell, did you? To nearly poison Ron? Or to let the Death Eaters into the castle, one of whom mauled Bill nearly to death? Your father didn’t need magic to plant that stupid diary into my cauldron. When is everyone going to realize that you don’t need magic to do serious damage?” Draco knew that Ginny was a very strong person, but she seemed to be in near tears.
Draco cursed, realizing how stupid he had been back in the shack. He should have made a run for it with the Time Turner. If he turned it in himself, he probably would not have gotten into much trouble. He also should have triple checked to make sure it was the one stolen from the Malfoys’—there could be others in existence. The “hows” and “whys” didn’t matter, though. What was he going to do about Harry? He tried to push down any doubt he had about his relationship with the Chosen One.
Harry seemed to be thinking about something, but then left anyway, making Draco sob even harder. However, a few moments later Harry returned—with another pillow. Without a word, Harry lay beside Draco and turned off the lights, leaving both of them side by side in the darkness.
Draco looked at the ground, unable to think of a response. “I know you guys are upset with me, and you should be, and—“
Draco scoffed. “Yeah, right. That’s why you hexed me on the Quidditch pitch, and did it again just a few minutes ago.”
ready to send in the morning, thinking about his conversation with Hermione Granger. He truly couldn’t believe how much she and he had talked this term, and how civil they were being toward each other. Apologizing didn’t feel so difficult anymore. Before it was as though every apology he made only had relief a long time after, and until then they smothered him. Now it felt natural to admit mistakes, it felt safe. He just wanted to stop feeling so guilty after talking to Hermione. It still felt like he was disobeying his parents. In a way he was, but he was eighteen now.
“You at least shouldn’t walk around here alone,” Blaise said decidedly. “Not until things settle down a little. Who was the prick that attacked you anyway, Looney Lovegood?”
“I don’t need him to walk me back,” Draco interrupted. “You guys can talk about whatever. I’m fine.”
It was odd to actually try and experience so much emotion. Draco spent the entire summer trying to swallow everything down and sit in the numbness. But Draco tried to listen to Potter, and let the feeling of his father’s love in particular ease over him. “
“Hello, dear,” she said coolly but politely. Draco knew from Harry that Molly Weasley was quite the hugger, but her arms remained at her sides as she gave him a once-over. Harry cleared his throat, and something in Mrs. Weasley’s demeanor changed. “You must have been freezing, sitting outside for so long in December. Come, come in.”
“You’d risk coming here and being caught just to get revenge?” The more Harry stalled, the more Draco felt like vomiting.
Draco doubted that Potter wanted to be alone. He believed that Potter conveyed that with his attitude, but Draco knew how it felt to pretend to want privacy and really need comfort—or just someone to sit with and ride out the flashbacks. But how was he going to talk to Harry without the other two noticing?
It was particularly hard to fathom on a day like this. The grounds of Hogwarts glistened with freshly fallen snow. It was cold enough for the snow to stay fluffy, but not too cold to be outside. Draco could hear the happy screams of students who were participating in snowball fights, particularly the first years who could finally conduct their battles using magic. This was one of the few times that one could visibly see inter-House unity taking place.
“Thank you, mother,” Draco replied. He cleared his throat. “I actually may go to Blaise’s house early next week. For dinner.” This was Draco’s backup plan, his way to get to the Weasley’s if he could possibly avoid broaching the subject with his parents.
Blaise scoffed next to Draco. “I can’t wait to tell everyone exactly what I ate for breakfast every day last year, because that’s all I’m sharing.” Draco laughed.
How could Harry do this? How could he befriend him, make Draco trust him, and then just stop participating in a significant ritual for him with no prior warning? Draco felt like this was the rejected handshake ten times over. Another part of Draco wasn’t mad but resigned.
Draco already had a headache by the time he got to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. He was sure it had something to do with the fact that he could feel waves of disgust flowing off of his Ministry driver, who did not say one word to him during the whole car ride. The platform was more crowded than last year, but there were still less eager and confused first years than when he started his Hogwarts journey seven years prior.
There was a long silence as everyone absorbed what he said. Then Dean spoke. “So you’re not going to break up with Potter?”
“Upset with you? No, you’re not a right prat to us—well, sometimes you are I guess. But you’re mostly a prat to yourself. What, did you think that we’d just forget about you if you ignored us?”
One more left in this series!!! I’ll be sad to see this part go, but I’m also drowning in final exams. The chapter should be out by Friday, and then that’ll be it until January 1st!
“Well, we’re still keeping it quiet. Give Harry time to change his mind about his reputation getting tarnished,” Draco stabbed at his food.
“The eighth-years were thinking about putting together an informal Quidditch game tonight, just us. You want in? We need at least two Seekers.”
The journey back to the Hospital Wing was horrendous, even though it was downstairs rather than up. After a while Draco had to resort to sliding down each step on his bottom since he was too weak to stand, and the height difference between him and Harry was too much for Harry to carry him. When there were only three flights left, Draco finally closed his eyes and leaned against the railing. He could still hear, but he couldn’t move or speak.
“Well you thought wrong,” Harry stated bluntly. “And it isn’t as if the Ministry cared for me that much in the past few years, anyway. We’ll take it from here.”
The rest of the Gryffindors smirked. “It was remarkably simple,” Hermione said. “But the point is, it’s not anymore. So we’ll need—“
“I have something to give you. Before you go.” Draco smirked. “No, nothing like that,” Harry objected, blushing again. Draco loved messing with him in that way. Someday those jokes would actually mean something, and he couldn’t wait for that. Harry pulled something out from beneath his desk. It looked like two very old, bound journals.
“Not until I spent Christmases at Hogwarts or at the Weasley’s. At the Dursley’s, Dudley enjoyed pelting me with snowballs, but it was hardly a fight. He’d bring them in the house and fling them through the cupboard. I got him good a few times, but Uncle Vernon would be furious.”
“He’ll be fine. He just gets antsy in crowded situations. There are still a lot of Death Eaters that the Aurors haven’t been able to round up, and Harry sees them in almost every face.”
“I’m sorry. You’re right,” Daphne said, though Greg hadn’t really said anything that warranted an agreement. “We need to stick together, not argue with each other.”
, he was able to determine a few things. Theodore Nott Sr. was not in captivity, and neither was his son. The Time Turner was in fact missing—
Kingsley stood, ready to leave. “It depends on if he’s willing to help himself. Should he turn himself in, we may be in a position to offer amnesty in exchange for information on his father. It will be different if we capture him while still performing criminal activity.”
“I think the opposite,” Daphne said. “I think that the more of us go, the more believable our story is.”
“Does that mean he wasn’t a Death Eater, though? Maybe he had some sort of special assignment,” Blaise said thoughtfully.
“There’s going to be a lot of people telling both of us that we shouldn’t do it. All I ask of you is that if you break up with me, it’s because you don’t want to be with me. Then I’d accept it fully. But if it’s because of what other people are saying, it will actually break my heart.”
He waited in the same damp room for a few moments, and then Yarney led his mother to Draco in chains. She looked quite a bit worse than the last time Draco was here. Her eyes were sunken into her pale face, and her features looked so pointy that her face had lost most of its renowned beauty. But she still had a spark in her eyes—she was still his mother. He wanted to hug her more than he had ever wanted anything in his life.
Dolohov tilted his head toward Draco. “Give up the traitor without a fight. There are still scores to be settled.”
“It’s a big deal!” Draco said, taking mild offense at Harry’s nonchalant tone. “I’m not even supposed to be outside Hogwarts grounds, let alone Diagon Alley a few days before my parents’ trial! We have to go.”
“Not at all,” Draco said. “I just...listen.” He stood up. “There’s something I want to say. To all of you.”
Draco was somehow both comforted and hurt by what Greg said. “Wow, I’m not sure I’ve ever heard you talk seriously for that long in your life,” he said somewhat jokingly.
Draco refuses to leave the Ministry without seeing his mother. He also learns the full extent of Harry’s “saving-people thing”.
? Draco thought after he was finished vomiting. He washed his face and rinsed his mouth out, unsure of what to do next. He was looking at himself in the mirror and contemplating his next move when he heard a cacophony of voices in the hallway. He cursed as he realized it was eleven, and the first period of classes was over.
That did get a small laugh out of Harry. “Well, I wasn’t successful in dropping out so you’d have to be on your own there, mate. No, I just—“ his smile disappeared. “It’s just that the Ministry is clearly struggling, you know? You were literally almost kidnapped and they’re more concerned about throwing your parents in Azkaban without a trial or solid evidence than they are about your safety. There are dozens of Death Eaters still around waiting to...well, I don’t even know! And that’s the problem! No one knows what they’re doing.”
The journey to Hogsmeade was quite casual. Draco was silent for most of the way, and no one even mentioned his incident the previous night. The three Gryffindors chatted happily as the train pulled into the Hogsmeade station. The village was serene, with only a few shoppers milling about, and no one paying any attention to Draco or Harry.
“Yes, Granger, he took glee in what we did. He was the only one. And now he’s dead, so congratulations.”
Harry helped a stumbling Draco out to a small park in the middle of Hogsmeade. They settled on a bench as Draco leaned back and closed his eyes, letting out a groan.
Harry exhaled through his nose. “It must have been hard, to have been disliked on both sides,” he said quietly, extending a hand across the table.
“I see,” Christine said, though it was obvious she didn’t believe Draco. “Tell me, how is the eighth year project going? Building a memorial for the fallen...”
Draco sat in the hard plastic chair in St. Mungo’s, waiting for his doom. The waiting room he was in had a small waterfall in the middle, likely in an attempt to soothe the occupants, but Draco was only made more anxious by the white noise. His leg bounced up and down, earning him glares from an old lady sitting across from him. He didn’t care—-he was about to see the Mind Healer for the first time and needed to get rid of any excess energy before his behavior was monitored.
“Turn in the package,” Dean finished. “Tell the truth. Say that we were worried so we were looking through your mail, and we found the missing Time Turner in a package addressed to you. But, if you do stay away from him and just keep to yourself for the rest of the year, we’ll destroy it for you. No one will ever know that you have it.”
Draco groaned. He totally forgot about that. His parents had been just about the only thing on his mind for the past few weeks, and now that they were out of danger for the moment, he had pushed the issue out of his brain to focus on Harry. This weekend it would be time to pay the piper. “Yeah. I’m definitely not going to say anything to my father, he’s still in the hospital and he already hates me.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “But I may be able to broach the issue with my mother cautiously.”
Draco learns exactly what will be in store for him this year, and learns what his new flat mates think about him.
“No way,” Draco said, though a flicker of doubt rose inside of him. “He’s just always around. Particularly when embarrassing things happen to me, I guess.”
Harry swallowed, like he wanted to say something else to Draco. He seemed to decide against it. “Well, shall I teach you some spell work while we wait, then? We still have to work on our Defense Against the Dark Arts project, too.”
“Draco, sweetheart,” Narcissa said, putting her hand on Lucius’s outstretched arm. “You’re very young, and have been through so much in such a short time. I understand that you may be having these...feelings, but perhaps they will change. Even if they don’t, it is not uncommon for men with your...preferences to take wives for the purposes of carrying on the name, and fulfilling their pleasures covertly.”
“It’s—“ Draco balked, feeling a bit odd talking to a portrait. How much of his mentor was captured in the personality of the painting? “It’s not dishonest, I do feel that it’s unnecessary. I’m fine!”
Blaise didn’t move for a moment, and Draco was worried he was about to pull out his wand. Instead, he reached for other cushions and made room for the three of them beside Draco. “Anything they can help with, we can also help with.”
Draco didn’t respond but heard movement behind him. All of a sudden something was covering him and he tried to throw it off.
Things took a turn during the next year. Draco was under a lot of pressure now that the Dark Lord had returned, and their parents wanted to solidify the betrothal. But Draco rejected all advances on the part of both Pansy and his parents, the latter of which had more important things to worry about at the time. However, it desperately hurt his relationship with Pansy. Finally, in sixth year, Draco had no other choice but to tell her that he was gay. She was a little smug about this, because she had worried that he liked another girl. Showing the strong bond of their friendship, she agreed not to tell anyone.
“Yes, dear, of course.” Madame Pomfrey seemed to forget all about Draco and rushed to get whatever Potter asked for. Draco rolled his eyes.
! Trying not to disturb Harry, who was reminiscing amicably with Kingsley, Draco coaxed the cloak out from Harry’s side. Harry noticed at the last possible second and tried to grab the end, but Draco was able to pull the fabric away. “Excuse me, Minister, I have to run to the loo.”
Draco pushed open the bathroom door and stepped unsteadily into the still empty living room. The world tilted beneath his feet and he stumbled, hitting his side on a table. He sank to the floor, feeling nauseous. There was no way he could make it to the Hospital Wing—he had lost too much blood to make it down five flights of stairs.
“You’re welcome. I want to see you back in a week to check your weight and some of these deficiencies. Let me go grab your potions—oh, hello Mr. Potter!” Draco turned to find that Harry Potter walking toward them. He immediately averted his eyes, feeling embarrassed.
Draco smiled, but then was torn out of his stupor when his father’s cane rattled against the wall. “Yes, good to see you,” he said dismissively. “Dinner is ready.”
Draco gave a small laugh, remembering making fun of Potter endlessly over that. “I guess you’re right. I probably wouldn’t have even made fun of you if I wasn’t so...” he sighed.
“And you think it doesn’t get any worse than a band on the wrist? Were you even here last year?” Daphne raised her voice and glared at Blaise.
Draco swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat and pushed that thought aside. He closed that emotional door in his mind before its contents could spill open, knowing full well that the next time he wanted to open that door, there would be a huge mess to clean up.
“No, Potter, you really don’t.” Justin turned to Draco, his eyes narrowed and fists clenched. “Do you know what this summer has been like for me? My sister can’t even drink a cup of tea without it spilling everywhere. She has permanent damage from you torturing her dozens of times! And yet you’re here while she’s in a long term program at Mungo’s learning how to write properly again. How can you live with yourself?” He stood, seeming ready to duel, and Draco put his hand in his robe pocket to grip his cold and unfamiliar wand.
“Maybe I shouldn’t—“ Draco stuttered. “I mean, it just seems like there’s a lot happening. A lot of...family stuff. And I don’t want to be around to make things odd—“
This is where the romance officially begins!! You guys have waited long enough. I’m thinking there will be a few more chapters in this installment of the series, then a week long break so I can recharge my creative juices, and then we’ll start the next installment! Let me know what you think and if you have anything you want to see—I feel like I’m pretty good at accommodating your guys’ requests!
. Anger he understood. He wanted his body mangled, wanted it to reflect how he felt inside. Fighting would be a good opportunity to release some of his energy that bounced back and forth in his mind, unable to escape. Most disgusting was the fact that Draco wasn’t even quite sure what the Hufflepuff’s sister looked like. He tortured many Muggle-born students, and made a point of trying not to look at his victims. In order to cast the Cruciatus curse, Draco had to feel hatred in his heart, which he found impossible to do while gawking at crying kids. His hatred for the Dark Lord propelled him through the task, but he also had to be careful to protect his mind while doing it. It was not easy, and he would often return to the Slytherin dormitory to vomit and then immediately collapse into bed.
“If there’s a cure, why can’t we just take it and be done with it?” Parvati spoke up from where she was sitting beside her twin sister.
Draco nearly had to roll over to make it to the Cloak in time, but he managed to get almost his entire body covered before the door opened. Narcissa moved to the other side of the room so that the guard would make eye contact with her when he entered rather than with Draco’s obvious foot.
It was sort of a jumble of random well-wishes, but Draco knew there were logistical limitations to the magical object. He smiled, and couldn’t find the words to respond. Even making the notebook glow with thanks wouldn’t match the brightness in his heart.
The door opened and Potter walked back in, flicking his wand to light the lamp on Draco’s side. He was carrying a glass of water, which he held out to Draco. Draco glanced at it, not wanting to reveal to Potter how badly his hands were shaking. But he wanted to settle his stomach, so he took the water. “Thanks.” Harry nodded and sat on the end of Draco’s bed, looking out the window to give him some space. “Sorry I woke you up. You should probably cast a charm to block out the noise, I can’t do magic outside the classroom, otherwise I would.”
“They need to heal too, mate. All of us do,” Harry spoke up from the floor. “Trust me, I know as much as any—“
“No! They’re mine and I can do whatever I want with them!” Draco adopted the whiny tone that he often had in their early years of school.
“Draco? Malfoy, are you in here? Malfoy, I’m coming in, okay?” Draco opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. He was just falling asleep—who was waking him up and what did they want?
Harry read over Draco’s shoulder, then looked at him with eyes full of loving concern. “Do you think he knows about us?”
“How is being locked up and forced to relive your worst memories over and over again keeping them safe? My father is barely sane, Weasley.” Draco was struggling to keep his voice even, and he could tell that Ron was as well.
The same wizard who interrupted her before spoke again. “Are you aware that lying to the Wizengamot can land you in Azkaban for life?” Draco clenched his fist at this stranger taking this tone with his mother. He wasn’t sure if he recognized the man from his own trial or not—that entire time period had been such a blur.
“Oh will it?” Draco sat up quickly, furious with Potter. “You really want to know? Fine, Potter. After your friends escaped from the Manor, the Dark Lord murdered nearly everyone in sight and then literally cut my tongue out as punishment for not confirming it was you. I had to go a week without a tongue before he finally gave my mother the potion to regrow it. There you have it—oh, you’re right, I feel so much better!” Draco said the last part sarcastically as a new round of sobs began.
After a nearly sleepless night, only two days before their date, Draco decided to consult his friends, who were absolutely thrilled that he and Potter had finally expressed their feelings for each other.
“GRANDPARENTS!” Mrs. Weasley finished Fleur’s sentence. “Arthur, did you hear that? Fleur’s pregnant!”
“However, I’m not going to be held hostage because of something that I didn’t do and that I don’t want any part of. I’m going to the Ministry first thing tomorrow morning to report everything that I know about the Time Turner. I’ll leave your names out of it, if you’d like, or you can come with me and help me explain things. Or you can destroy it yourself if you want, but I want to watch it be destroyed so I can know for sure. I’m not going to be blackmailed anymore. I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart for everything that I did, and I know that it will never come close to being enough.” Draco took a deep breath. This was the hard part. “I probably don’t even know half the things that I’ve done to you all. Some of you have hinted at the consequences of my actions in the discussion groups, or in private, but if you at all want to tell me something you’re mad at me for, or something you hate about me or my family, or whatever you want, I’m willing to listen. I’m serious,” he added when Ginny and Dean looked at each other.
, what more is it going to take? I’ve insulted your family my whole life. It’s because of me that your brother was mauled by a werewolf. It’s indirectly because of me that another one of your brothers was nearly killed by poison. And didn’t my father plant You-Know-Who’s stupid diary into your cauldron so that you’d be possessed and—“ With a sharp pain, Draco fell to the ground. He writhed only for a moment under the familiar Cruciatus curse before the pain left nearly as quickly as it had come. He made to get up, looking at Ginny suspiciously.
Draco crossed the room quickly, dropped his trunk, and grabbed Harry’s face in his. With a hand gently on Harry’s neck, he tilted his boyfriend’s head so that their lips were able to match despite the height difference. He heard Harry give a yelp of surprise before the Boy Who Lived settled into the kiss, his posture melting. Draco steadied him by lowering him to a bed—whether it was Draco’s or Harry’s didn’t matter in the slightest in that moment.
“You privileged prick!” Justin Finch-Fletchley shouted. “Of course you were out of danger, your family was close to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!”
“Then what do they want from me?” Draco was getting upset. “I’ve done horrible things, I know this, I acknowledge this. But I can’t take them back, I can’t undo the past.” Suddenly, Draco shot up. “Wait. You don’t think they want me to use the Time Turner to change the past, do you? Or that they will?”
The rest of the short carriage ride passed in mostly silence, with only a few remarks here and there hypothesizing what was to come. Draco was starting to feel more comfortable with the idea of going back to school. He was around individuals who knew a little bit what he had gone through, what he had done...and they were still speaking to him.
“He will likely be able to get away for a weekend to make sure you’re settled in. But only if he behaves himself—you should send him a letter at once telling him to end his antics.”
“But I can’t follow your full instructions even though they’re fantastic. I told you, we should have done a different spell. Or you should have insisted on having a less—less
“My gran told me that the Ministry requires a blood sample now to make sure no one is using glamours or Polyjuice Potion,” Neville added. “But we didn’t need any of that in fifth year...”
The couple sat on the steps, trying to stave away the cold by keeping close, and looked at the stars. Draco began to calm down, and Harry asked gentle questions to extract the past few hours from Draco as though it were venom tearing away his body. By the time it was too cold to bear, Draco felt lighter.
“I know,” Harry said. “I would too. If I—“ Draco guessed how Harry was going to finish that sentence.
The afternoon was no better for Draco. He botched all of his spells in Charms and Transfiguration, barely managing to get a passing grade on his quizzes. He was also starting to feel a little ill—not in the familiar way that he had all summer, but rather feverish. By the time he sank next to Harry into Potions, he was trembling.
Draco wasn’t expecting this. Whenever he complained to his father, the first thing he received was detailed instructions about exactly what he should do. He never had to lead the other person there with him. “I just...I guess I just wanted some advice. I don’t really want the Ministry involved at all, if I can help it.”
“No, not without getting yourself killed, or your entire family killed! Don’t kid yourself, Draco, everyone seems to think that we’re a lot more powerful than we actually are. We couldn’t have changed anything, we only could have made it worse—“ Blaise was nearly yelling now and people were starting to stare.
“Though he did stay in our house, my husband was punished severely for his past renouncing of Death Eater ways. My son was also punished greatly.” Draco tensed. He didn’t want Narcissa to relieve any of his punishments in front of the Wizengamot.
“It—doesn’t matter.” Draco didn’t want to admit that it was his Aunt Bellatrix who taught him Occlumency, and that she was actually a fantastic teacher. The only fault of hers, in Draco’s opinion, was excessive punishment. “Okay, take a deep breath and close your eyes.”
“Would you two calm down? People are starting to stare!” Daphne hissed. It was true; Potter and his friends were now looking at Draco, who had both hands flat on the table as though he was going to spring up and attack Goyle, who was incredibly red in the face.
Professor McGonagall waited at the entrance where Draco, Gregory, Daphne, and Blaise were gawking at the bright scene before them. She looked better than she had last year, Draco noticed, but was still aged more than she should have been since Draco first walked through this hall as a first year. Despite the sufferings of last year, her eyes gleamed, and Draco was surprised when she met his gaze and gave him a small smile. “Ah, good to see you four. Please have a seat at the new table for eighth-years.” She gestured to the small back table.
