Next chapter on Sunday. Hope to see you then.
I know Draco is kind of OOC, but I think it's understandable in his situation.
“So better late in the evening when the children are already gone.”
Disclaimer: Not mine, I don't even own a stuffed dragon.
“About Draco’s reparations?” I am surprised.
“Oh right,” I yawn, moving to get up, “Give me a moment. Breakfast is ready soon.”
I still don’t know much more about the mysterious man’s identity. Like I said, I know he’s male. His mother is still alive, at least she was during our fifth year, so it is likely that he is still relatively young. Also he seems to have a vast knowledge of me or at least behavioural patterns. My guess is that he is some pureblood son who was forced into becoming a death eater and then rebelled by putting his life on the line as a spy. I am also sure that he lived in Malfoy Manor during the year leading up to the final battle.
“Did your parents know about that?”
“Still,” he lowers his head, cheeks flushing to my surprise. I smile at how he gains color, it makes him look more healthy, “Leave now.”
Another, more vicious, glare, but when I don’t relent he sighs dramatically and runs the brush down Shenan’s flank again before answering, “It is calming to me. My…” he shakes his head, “I was supposed to let the house-elves prepare the horses when I wanted to ride, but I never liked that. Brushing and preparing them yourself is supposed to establish a connection and a first amount of trust between horse and rider. So yes, I prefer to do this by hand and by myself,” angry grey eyes snap at me, “Problem, Potty?”
Draco only blinks. Yes, any kind of (human, he seems to be working quite well with any kind of animal) social interaction is still his biggest problem.
“It’s to establish the basics after you spoke up for him at the trial,” he explains patiently.
And getting proof is an entirely difficult matter. Those who could tell me are dead. I asked Snape’s as well as Dumbledore’s portrait but I got the same answer from both of them. ‘I am only a portrait, I don’t know everything the original knew.’ Tilly won’t tell me anything either. The only possibility would be to take memories forcefully but that’s against the law and I would never do anything like that. Also to get into the Manor would involve weeks of waiting again to get the permission. It would be easier to talk to Malfoy directly. But to get permission to speak with him in his cell in Azkaban is even more difficult and I don’t think even Luna has managed to get through yet. Not that I think he would just tell me.
“Draco,” he says softly, “Can you hear me? Here are people who want to take you out of your cell.”
I smile soothingly, “No, don’t worry. I just got held up in Hogwarts. I wanted to finish something before I left.”
“What if I don’t want to?” he glares.
“Because he was in the back,” she grins then walks over to the front desk, “Okay, do you have everything for him at home?”
“No, please!” he suddenly screams and I jerk my hand back, “Please no punishment! I’m sorry! I will be better, I promise! I will pay better attention.”
On our way out of the room, he suddenly reaches out to a book. My balance is nearly upset by his action so he manages to knock the thing over. It tumbles open and reveals the pictures of horses inside. He gives a sound somewhere between a laugh and a squeak. As urgent as he is capable of, he pulls downwards. He manages to touch one of the animals, humming excitedly. His fingers tap against it. I chuckle.
Life has caught up with me again. The school year finished with me not finding so much of a scrap of new information. Hermione and I tried every last loophole to get Draco out of prison but no chance.
“Of course you can have it,” I choke, “It’s been yours and now you can have it back. You might normally not be in the age for stuffed toys anymore, but right now you need the anchor. So you can have it for as long as you want. It’s yours until the day you don’t need it anymore.”
He blinks nervously, “Sl-Sleeping,” he mumbles, “Fell asleep playing.”
Of course it’s left to me to coax Draco away from the horse he is currently petting without him causing a scene. He is certainly not happy but hangs his head eventually and follows me. I sigh, recognising this as a mechanism he kept from his prison days when he had to bow to each of the guards’ whims. I stroke his back to make sure he doesn’t confuse this with the prison. We already had episodes where he mistook some action and flew into a flashback that brought him right back into forcefully learned behaviour. Let’s just say it wasn’t pretty.
“They will, but of course the first thing they will argue that he could have lied or that I could have simply made the answers up to serve my case – “
She smiles her dreamy smile, “I didn’t think you would. You fight for their rights and just punishments just like we do.”
“Malfoy!” I shout down the Alley.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
Hermione swallows, skin paler than before, “That’s… harsh…”
I exchange a smile with Hermione. Yes, he is indeed getting better.
“I managed to get them to return a few of the Malfoy properties they confiscated as well as a small part of the money they took.”
I nod in understanding while the guard puts all three wands into a box and seals it. Waving at us, he walks on through the door on the other side of the room. We follow him through a corridor of bright cells. A proper bed and furniture. That’s the top layer. More like a more confined version of house arrest than an actual prison. The prisoners inside look up as we pass, apparently hoping for some kind of visitor for them. Some sneer or grin at me but all stay calmly in their cells. We pass many faces I have seen at the trials. At the end of the hallway Michael leads us into an elevator, clearly only for visitors. He presses the lowest button and I swallow.
“I think so, but we made sure everyone on the list was being accounted for as far as I was told,” Molly says.
Comments and kudos are always appreciated. See you next time.
He shrugs, never looking me in the eyes, “I was ten when my father bought her for me. ‘Karina’s Dream’ just seemed like such a mouthful. So where my parents couldn’t hear me, I called her ‘Kari’. It was what she responded to.”
“I know,” I wave it off, “That’s why I visited that house elf who was taking care of the prisoners again. And I got her to confirm that it was Draco who gave that order. That’s her memory,” I pour it into the bowl.
“In private,” I say and lead her over into a side chamber which they use as a pantry judging by the different food stuffs everywhere, “It’s the same matter as last time.”
My first instinct is to run outside but I don’t think I will get far completely on my own. I need someone to help me. A trace spell still comes up empty. Draco used to be a very good wizard and when he’s clear, he has nearly all of his abilities. His control is a bit wonky, but he can perform any simpler spells he remembers, including blocking spells, so he can’t be tracked. Hermione is the obvious choice for help. For a moment I think of running to the fireplace but instead I summon a Patronus to send it off to my friend.
“Bullshit,” I give back, frowning, “I was worried, Draco. I came back and you were gone. I thought someone kidnapped you,” I tell him, purposefully leaving out that I was worried about him being out on his own as well.
“So what?” he snorts, wet silver eyes glaring at me, “It’s not like anybody asked.”
“Not yet, I would say. As much as it might help, it could also be that he might also react negatively to another living, moving being in the house. And if it doesn’t work out you are stuck with a probably hyperactive kitten on top of taking care of him.”
Disclaimer: Not mine.
So you told your son about your past. You really changed, didn’t you? Your former self from our time in Hogwarts would have never told the own child such a shameful thing. Did you also tell him about his mother? No one else knows after all. Do you plan to take that secret to your grave?
“It’s unfair,” I correct, “Draco didn’t even commit most of the things they charged him with. And there was no way he could have defended himself either. I am sure the decision was set before he even stepped into the courtroom.”
“Sure.”
finally I am updating a new chapter. That's the main reason I dislike uploading unfinished stories.
“Then can you sign his freedom now,” I urge him.
Seeing as he is about to break down, I instinctively wrap my own arms around him. For a moment he fights me. Then he drops and I already want to sigh that his mind is lost again, but then his left hand clenches into his shirt.
I stop at corner to hold onto the wall for a few seconds. My eyes dart around frantically and I gasp when I spot a flash of white towards the end of the small alley I am staring down. Immediately I push off the wall and approach, making sure to not run to fast in case this is who I’m looking for.
Hello everyone,
“Well, you remember how I asked you about that Spy A. And Ginny said I look like I am in love when I think about whoever this is. But I don’t know him at all. And it’s a guy!” I grumble, burying my face in Teddy’s soft hair (currently black to fit my own locks).
She regards me for a moment, “There was a house elf who would come when no one was around. She would bring us additional food, blankets, clothes and even medicine once.”
“You’re safe,” I repeat, trying again to hand him the meowing Dragon.
I can’t help but sweat-drop. That’s what you told your son about me? But I should have expected it, it’s just so you, that it makes me smile unconsciously. At least I heard no worse insults yet. And you still see me as Harry and not the saviour of the wizarding world. I still can’t help but be thankful for that even after all this time.
thank you for the comments and kudos.
“Draco?” my voice probably sounds severely confused, “It was an accident, it’s no problem.”
“You can’t move?” I frown, “Why? Is it a spell? Did someone hex you or did you trigger a trap?”
“He’s using his left arm,” Andrea whispers to me, “I thought you said he couldn’t.”
“Harry, I understand you want to help him. But maybe he really did what they said…” Hermione trails off when I throw her a look.
“I look like someone tried to turn me into ground meat!” he yells back, shooting around, rage and despair in his eyes, “My looks used to be the only thing I really had control over and now!”
I actually get his attention and grey eyes land on me. Luckily the steps are just broad enough for me to walk up them next to him. He follows once again and eventually, we stand with the horse’s back at the height of our thighs. I nudge his right leg, at a loss on how to get him to make the last move from the steps onto Shenan’s back. I breathe a sigh of relief when apparently muscle memory from his youth days kicks in and he moves his leg over the palomino’s back. His strength gives out halfway through and his knee lands on the middle of the cloth. But Shenan doesn’t even twitch only gives a soft snort. I support Draco from the side, so he manages to slide completely onto the horse’s back.
“What do you want?” my voice is cold.
She only waves me off and bustles away into the back rooms. A few minutes later she comes back, a small leather-bound book in hand. Her face holds a sad smile, but she comes over eagerly nonetheless. Grinning she plucks the sleeping baby from my arms and pushes the book at me. Staring at it curiously, I turn it in my hands.
“Calm down? I have no idea where I am or how I got here,” he crosses his arms, Dragon scrambling to curl around his neck, “And what are you doing here? Is this my new punishment?”
I choke on air, “What? You want to… No!”
“It’s alright, Draco,” I try to sooth him, “No one is going to hurt you. We are just going to meet some new horses, how does that sound?”
We have been training with him so we can take the toy from him for a short amount of time. It wouldn’t do to have him stuck to it forever. So he only twitches momentarily when I carefully push his hand from the dragon. I take the stuffed animal up and set it on the table out of his reach. It only earns me a blank stare from him. I try to smile and stand up to head over to the girl. She hands me the little cat with an apprehensive face.
“That’s good,” he smiles a sad smile, “I wish you the best luck with him. I hope you can bring him back. He did not deserve this and I don’t want him to suffer any further.”
“Yes, I can see that,” I wave him off, “What do you want?”
“Ginny,” I groan, taking a step away, “I have told you before that I am not in the mood for your games.”
Eventually we reach his room again. I lower him on the bed and he lays down on his own. His apathy is starting to wear off, slowly though. He is mostly only reacting to himself unfortunately. Outside influences like other people or his environment are still basically non-existent to him. Well, like I told Hermione, every step forward, no matter how small, is progress.
I hum in agreement and reach for the bottle, but am stopped by the girl’s hand on my arm, “No Harry. You had enough for now. I understand that you are angry about what happened to Malfoy, but drinking won’t help. You should rather think of a plan on how to get him out again. Or at least lighten his punishment.”
“Mr. Potter,” he bristles, “Even if you are the Saviour, you can’t just – “
~ * ~
“I told you last time that I had to take care of your cousin Draco, didn’t I?”
Again that measuring gaze, “He did. He said you were his school-time rival. And annoying. With a saviour-complex.”
“I think the only one who really knows can’t answer you right now,” she answers pained, “What do you plan to do now?”
“You want me to read it to you?” I ask, we have done that a number of times before, but usually with more distance between us.
She smiles at me, “No, that is somewhere between the one we’ve been using before and a real saddle. He seems to have made progress since last time and since he expressed the wish to go faster before, I thought we might give it a try. The stirrups should give him the needed hold for that.”
“The first year? You mean Malfoy?”
“Right, sarcasm is still beyond you,” I murmur as I help him onto his feet. It takes him a few moments to get his balance again, but he has gotten much better at walking and moving in general. For one he is getting proper nourishment and at least a small bit of exercise each day. Hermione told me that I will have to consider physiotherapy for him at some point but that’s still in the future. I am hoping that he will gain that during horse therapy, judging from what I read about it while researching it. For now though we are working on him walking the distance from his bedroom to the living room on his own. Right now I am still supporting him, but mostly to make sure he doesn’t fall and give him the strength his muscles don’t have yet.
“I am fine, Potter. And don’t call me by my first name,” he snaps back, eyes fixed past me on the front door.
“What can Matty do for you, master…?” big blue eyes with wrinkles around them focus on me.
“What is going on?” a new, cold voice interrupts us from the doorway.
“Tilly is honoured by young master’s words,” she squeaks happily, “Now what does young master wish Tilly to do?”
“It’s fine. From the diagnosis you gave me I expected something far worse anyway,” she cringes, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be inappropriate.”
“I don’t think anyone would believe you this,” the judge snorts, “But you have a chance to prove it, don’t you? Will you let us question you under Veritaserum?”
“How can Tilly help young master?” she squeaks as Draco’s brow furrows.
I sigh, but continue on, “When did you start working as a spy?”
That earns me a scoff, but the slightest hint of a flush rising on pale cheeks. Noticing that, he immediately gets up and does his best to storm haughtily out of the room. It is kind of ruined by the fact that he still takes the longer route around the table to avoid us though.
He doesn’t react, unsurprisingly, his attention completely on the stuffed toy once again. I sigh, but the smile stays on my face as I coax him out of bed and to the living room for breakfast.
“No,” I cringe, I can’t tell her that he used magic to lift it up.
I smile as I carefully approach him a few minutes after he has regained control over his right arm and is stroking Shenan’s head. His eyes land in my direction but he doesn’t move from his position next to the animal. He doesn’t even twitch when I settle on her other side. My staring at him is interrupted by an amused chuckle next to me though.
Still I am encouraged and happy every time I see his progress. Another one of those moments happens this Sunday. We were riding yesterday and he fell asleep smiling, the dragon only sitting next to his head instead of pressed against his chest. Since I have an exam in a week, I have been studying in every free moment I have. So I sat down as soon as the blond was asleep, opening books and making notes until I fell asleep with one of the heavy tomes on my chest, sprawled across the couch.
“Does he have enough coordination to get up on the horse by himself if you make a ladder for him?”
“His mental health?”
I want to know where you are. I am not exactly sure why, but I need to know. I have been keeping an eye on you since the beginning of the year, mostly to find out what you were planning. But now? You are a risk for no one since you are gone. But I can’t stop my mind from straying to this subject. I wonder why you suddenly disappeared without a trace or warning. Are you dead? No, a corpse would have been found. Besides your parents declared you missing. Not even they know where you are, apparently. If you would have been killed or assigned to a mission by Voldemort, they would have known. So you really disappeared without a trace.
“Do we really have to go into this? It’s an invasion of his personal sphere if you ask me,” I frown.
“I know,” he snorts, “But it sounds prettier when they announce it during a competition, than just ‘Kari’.”
“Luna. Are you okay?” I ask worried.
“Of course,” I snort, “And he will have to come to the trial to speak as both witness and accused I guess.”
“So you took it for her,” I realise with wide eyes.
“Draco, please, wake up. Look at me,” I plead, tears running down my face, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push you. Please, focus on me. Come back, Draco.”
“Has Dumbledore ever spoken to you about another source of information from Voldemort’s army, apart from Snape?”
“This warrant is correct. The minister signed it and it’s on Draco Malfoy’s name. According to these papers he was an unrecognised spy during the war,” he looks up at us, “Fine, I will lead you to him. However don’t expect much of him.”
“You’re welcome, just make sure you don’t send any more idiots to my doorstep.”
I don’t know how long we just sit there, on the cold floor of the empty corridor. At some point Dragon has crawled back onto the blonde’s lap, purring and pawing at the boy which helps calm him as soon as he has recovered from his panic attack. I continue to hold him until I feel him slowly drifting to sleep, drained from two memory induced panic attacks in one day. Softly I shift him to pull him into my arms when I’m sure he’s asleep. The cat curls on his chest, claws extending just far enough to hold himself in the blonde’s shirt without injuring him. I stand up and give a small smile when the gaunt face cuddles a bit into my chest. I carry him and the cat to his room and tuck him in his bed. I sit there even longer, staring down at him with a sad smile until his first nightmare rips him from his sleep.
Hermione opens her mouth and closes it again, “I guess he has way less self-esteem than we thought. All just a mask,” she shakes her head, “Another issue you will have to work through once he is clear enough.”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
Hermione smiles at me for a moment, then she focuses down on the parchment before asking the next question. Time passes that way while I keep an eye on Draco.
“Visitors?” he repeats and tilts his head.
Yeah, not fast may have been the best answer. It’s six days later and I only have managed about three quarters of all the files in here. Mind you the worst part were all the papers just randomly flying around the place and the fact that no one seemed capable to only put one kind of information in a folder. So sometimes I had to sort every single sheet from the same folder somewhere different. And since McGonagall asked me to make sense and sort out all the papers I find too… Well, you see my problem. Luckily there are only some boxes (and a few flying leaves) in the back left and the shelves. But I guess that’s the only thing in this damned place that is halfway in order.
Kreacher, even though we are good now, only very rarely responds. Draco never does, he hides in his rooms. So at first I don’t think the complete and utter silence of Grimmauld Place any strange. I decide to go to the kitchen first to make some coffee, still yawning. The house elf isn’t there. When I wander back up however, I am greeted by Dragon ambling out of one of the living rooms. When the cat sees me, he meows and bounds up eagerly, winding around my legs.
“Malfoy?” I repeat confusedly.
~ * ~
“Hm?” dazed grey eyes snap up to me and I sigh.
(See the end of the chapter for
Disclaimer: not mine.
“Hm?” I blink up at him and he mirrors my action, staring at me curiously.
“The cane?” I state with confusion and dread at the realisation that that fancy walking cane Lucius was carrying around was not just used for hiding his wand. Swallowing past the bile in my throat, my eyes land on the old umbrella again. The thing is broken, part of the colourful screen torn off. With a lot of imagination or maybe a panic-clouded mind, it could be mistaken for the walking cane of Lucius Malfoy. When Dragon knocked it over it must have somehow triggered a flashback of when his father tried to hit him with it. I sigh a heavy breath.
“I cannot say much,” he shakes his head, “Every prisoner reacts differently. For now he shows apathy but that can change in seconds and he could fly into panic. Be careful is all I can tell you.”
“So you got him out of there now,” she sighs as I let myself fall down next to her.
“Hey Harry. Have a nice weekend?”
“Alright,” she grins while leading me towards the back, “Is there anything else I need to know? Like something he is especially afraid of?”
Still shaken from my own nightmare I don’t remember how bad an idea touching him is until it is too late. As soon as I lay a hand on his shoulder, he screams, shooting up straight in bed. Panicked grey eyes skit around the room, not even seeing me. The first thing that comes to my mind to calm him down is Dragon, so I hurriedly look around the room for the little cat. For once I am glad that I could never teach the animal to sleep anywhere else but Draco’s bed. But my search turns up empty. So out of panic with a screaming Draco in the room, I simply summon the protesting cat wandlessly. Ignoring the meows, I put the warm creature in Draco’s lap. The animal blinks for a moment, then seems to notice the blonde’s panicked behaviour, he immediately starts purring and pressing himself against pale skin.
“What?” she looks back at me in surprise, not the response she expected to the diary, “That one you talked about? Not that I know of. Why do you ask?”
“Hermione? What are you doing here?” I blink my eyes open tiredly.
“Well, you are surely a difficult customer,” she smirks, “Maybe there is not the right cat for you here,” then she bites her lip, “But I have one last idea. Give me a second and wait here.”
I smile but don’t really dare come closer, lest I interrupt his peace. For a few minutes he busies himself with the two horses nudging at him from left and right. Then, just as I take a step closer a soft whinny from the other side of the stable seems to draw his attention. At first he stiffens whether from me approaching or the unexpected sound, but then he looks in the direction of the noise and spots Shenan, the horse he rode during his first therapy session. His face brightens slightly and he takes another step.
“Maybe,” he snorts, “But it also gives you the best connection to the horse. Difficult yes, but also the most relaxing to me,” he sighs again as he positions his arms differently because his muscles are still weak and a saddle is heavy, “I am well aware that I don’t have the balance and strength for that at the moment, but I am perfectly capable of riding with a saddle.”
“Tracking spells don’t work,” she repeats my words, “But when you said Draco was gone, I grabbed this,” she pulls out a strange device made out of swirling rings and a face of glass.
“Come on. I think we need to do some research on how to best treat trauma patients,” she smiles wryly as she leads me out of the room and down to the living room.
Ignoring Kingsley’s laughter and Hermione’s comment of ‘Many people would think otherwise if they saw you right now’, I hurry out of the door, the girl always on my heels. Out of the office, down the corridor, back to the atrium we go. There Hermione offers me her hand as I have never been to Azkaban, but she has.
~ * ~
“Yeah, the scars are mostly old. From a time when he was still free. None of Voldemort’s followers would have destroyed the dark mark. However someone who didn’t take it out of free will and hates the belief attached to it, would maybe do something like that,” I explain, stroking the shredded skin.
“I should be comforting you, not the other way around,” I muffle into his throat.
But you don’t remember and so we are back to shouting insults at each other in the corridors. There are moments where I wish so much you would remember. Remember that you were the one who came to me while I was just sitting out on the Hogwarts grounds, trying to escape my fears. I never wanted to be a death eater, but in a family like mine, you don’t really have a choice. It is either take the dark mark or have yourself as well as your mother killed. Remember how you told me that you were sick of all the expectations they put on you, how you asked why we couldn’t just be friends. You were the one who kissed me first after I put my arms around you.
“It makes sense, I guess,” it earns me a shrug, “That his memories come back all in one, so he remembers you as well.”
“NO!” I say with as much force as I can muster, grabbing her hands, “I believe in him. If we give him the chance and help him, he will come back. I am sure. But we have to believe that he can do it,” my eyes fill with sadness, “This is not about me at all. He deserves a normal life too, Hermione. A life where he can be free and live like he wants to. Without his father, his name or Voldemort looming over him.”
That’s my last thought as my vision turns completely black and my whole body gives away. My awareness leaves me as I land next to your grave in the grass. I doubt they will bury me here though. Pity. But that’s for them to take care of. I am finally free of all my responsibilities. Of my masks and false truths. You know all about that, don’t you? How about in death we finally shed all those masks and just be truthful to each other? How does that sound to you? At least to me it sounds great. Even if Ginny is waiting for me there, I want to be with you.
His legs look as awful as the rest of his body does. Bruised, scarred and white skin on bones. And my suspicion strengthens, judging by the reddish-brown substance, which I guess is blood, still clinging to the inside of his upper thighs. I can’t help but shudder, trying to hide it from my sensitive charge, but he apathetically sets foot in front of foot and follows me to the tub. I stop him in front of it, but before I can get him into the half-high water, he twitches and shies away from it. I softly stroke his back.
“Not anyone can be a healer. Everyone has a different affinity for this kind of magic. And unfortunately this seems to be one of the few things I am not good at,” she pouts, looking slightly pissed, “You on the other hand have a high affinity for healing magic. I mean, you’re studying it. So it should be easier on both the caster and Draco if you would do it instead.”
“Are you sure? Draco’s still there after all?”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated
Now it’s my time to snort, “He might never be able to stand on trial again, even only as a witness. And even if he can do it, it will take months, probably years until that. They can’t expect it to be accepted to wait that long.”
“Mr. Potter. You seemed a bit distracted today. What can I do for you?”
“Come on, Draco. Let’s get you to bed. It’s been enough for today I would say,” I say to him softly.
But when I got the first 3 grades today, they all came back with a 1, at the beginning (german university system where 1,0 is the best you can get and 5,0 the worst). So my mind is collected enough again to upload, yay ^^'
She raises an eyebrow but writes the name down anyway, “Since I doubt he is in a state to be making his own decisions, what about his guardians? Have you talked to them?”
“No, no,” I hurriedly move to correct her, “That’s not it. I have just never thought about it. I mean I can appreciate it when a guy looks attractive and I have never found that weird. But actually being with another man…”
So that you finally know that I love you, Draco Malfoy.
“The old Black house?” he continues to glare, “Did you kidnap me? How did I get here?”
“I’m being honest. That’s part of my job as a friend, keeping you from being stupid. You’ve been running yourself ragged over Draco. And while I get that you desperately want to help him, you need a break, Harry. You are too close to him, too sympathetic in general so it’s extremely hard on you. You need to take a few days off.”
I can’t help but chuckle, “We will see. You will have to ask him that yourself when it’s time.”
It takes me several minutes until I am calm enough to lean against the cold tiles. My breathing is still ragged and tears are still running down my cheeks.
“What? He would never do that. Everybody knows that I am a Death Eater. I don’t think I need to show you my mark to remind you of it,” confusion is added to the swirling chaos of emotions in his wide eyes.
“So they want me to stand as accused again,” he cuts her off, his fingers clench in his sleeves and he seems to ready himself to flee again.
This chapter is also as far as I ever uploaded on fanfiction.net. I have more already wrtten chapters on my computer, but for whatever reasons I could never motivate myself to update them there. Not sure if I'm ever going to do that. I will probably just continue here.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
“Here, you have to eat that,” I lean forward, nearly touching his lips with the food, “Open up, Draco,” I say with a pained chuckle, “I never thought I would ever feed you. Eat it, please,” I urge.
“What’s her name?”
He only huffs before seeming to drop into deeper sleep. I sigh and let my head fall onto the pillow behind Draco. Well, he’s not letting me go anytime soon. It’s nothing new that he tends to be clingy after a nightmare, but usually I can just detach his hand and go back to my room until the next alarm rips me out of sleep again. However today he is not letting me go and wants me to sleep here instead. I guess a bed is a bed. It will work, my tired brain supplies, already half on my way to sleep. I barely register how I wrap an arm around the body in front of me before completely dropping off.
“That’s not what I – “ I start up again but then take a deep breath. Arguing like we’re back in school isn’t going to get us anywhere. I know he is only deflecting the helplessness and hurt he is feeling right now into anger. He is riling me up again to divert me from his show of vulnerability. That tactic worked perfectly back in school but I refuse to let him do it again. I pinch the bridge of my nose, “That’s not the point here, Malfoy, and you know it. Don’t try to turn it on me.”
She snorts, “You know I could take care of Draco now and then if you want some time to actually live your life.”
“Why are you that eager to find whoever that spy is? He’s just another death eater,” he grumbles.
“What exactly is his state? The ministry never got a medical report.”
To my surprise he leans forward without a moment delay. His movements are still slow but determined this time. And then I freeze, because his mouth wraps around my jam covered finger without one second of hesitation. I twitch uncomfortably. Thankfully he stops soon and sits up straight again. His eyes become vacant again.
“I have papers here that tell of the existence of another spy in Voldemort’s ranks, nearly as high as Snape himself,” I say handing the papers over, “I found them in Hogwarts. The spy is only ever referred to as ‘A’. Here is Draco’s original birth certificate. His third name is Abraxas.”
His thin arm stretches out again. I stay very still to not disturb him when he is finally doing something on his own. His progress is slow but eventually his fingers reach me. I stiffen at how much the pale appendage is still shaking. He is so shockingly weak nowadays. No matter how bad his mental state is, the first thing we have to do is get his body back to health. But I am ripped out of my musings when I feel an ice-cold touch on my fingers. I can just so stop myself from jerking. With wide eyes I look down, only to discover Draco’s bony fingers on mine. His fingertips are laying against the back of my hand. I smile brightly at him.
He apparates away, leaving me in the too-still entrance hall of the Manor. A shiver runs down my spine. I can hardly imagine spending as much as a week in this atmosphere. But growing up here? I would definitively not want that. No surprise Draco turned out a bit messed up if he spent his whole life in a house like this. Hopefully it was better or at least lighter when he was younger. Before Voldemort decided to use it as his main quarters. But I am ripped out of my thoughts by the crack of another house elf arriving. She is smaller than Matty but also younger, with big greenish eyes and a newer pillow case. Curious eyes stare up at me.
In the end neither Andromeda nor I notice how much time has passed until I hold up a hand to stop the flow of her words when I think to hear soft feet padding down the hallway towards us. And indeed a few moments later after listening to the steps getting slower the closer he gets, a white blond head pokes carefully around the doorframe. As soon as grey eyes land on Andromeda he tenses again. Nonetheless he finally steps inside. Only then do I notice that he has Teddy cradled against his neck, holding him in a way that one arm is enough to keep him safe. The toddler’s eyes are closed.
I see you automatically freeze. My heart skips a beat too. Do you still hate me that much? The brunette next to you lays a hand on your arm and I can just keep myself from glaring at it or her directly. She is levelling a calculating stare at me behind a mask of polite smiles. Am I really being jealous of the woman who is allowed to stay by your side while I am nothing but your former enemy? Alright, I admit that I am. But I guess you will never know that in this moment I want to be your friend. That I even want to be in her place. That you look and laugh at me like you do at her. That I am the one at your side.
“My name is Harry Potter. And can I come in?” I ask softly
“How do you know so much about his childhood?” I breathe shakily, moving back again, to look at her.
So I glare as I stomp down to the front door. Scowl clear on my face, I open it. The man in front of it is wearing the ministry garb too, but luckily it’s a different one from last time. I would have cursed that jerk into next week. Instead the guy bows his head politely, despite being clearly startled.
When we reappear on a forest path close to the stable it takes him a second to register the definitive unknown surroundings. He stiffens immediately and he looks ready to bolt, eyes wide. Hermione throws me a worried look over the blonde’s shoulder. I know she is questioning whether it’s not too early but I have trust that Draco will be just fine. So I carefully nudge the other man forward, supporting him, and press his stuffed dragon, which I took from home as a caution, in his hand. He seems to calm down a bit, but his distress is still clear.
“You deserved it even less,” I say with conviction.
I choke again, “A whole life! What do you mean?”
Hope you liked it. Kudos and comments are always appreciated.
“Oh,” Hermione has caught up faster, “Was Malfoy’s trial today?”
Hello everyone,
“Yeah,” I nod, “Can you do me a favour and take the food to the living room? I will get Draco. I would like to get him to eat something before I leave for the lecture again.”
I nod tensely. You don’t know and it is to stay that way.
“Will he ever become like he was?” I blurt out.
“Kari, I think,” I agree, “The name of his horse, Karina’s Dream. I would guess she was a similar colour.”
“Yes, you said you are not allowed to say. I don’t need you to give me a name either. All I need is a yes or a no,” I take a deep breath, “The one who ordered you to do it was Draco, am I correct?”
Your reputation as the Slytherin sex god. I am not sure whether I am supposed to be jealous of that (or of who). My whole life is filled with being prepared and playing the hero so I will one day fulfil my destiny and kill Voldemort to do so much as dating, not even thinking about sex. Besides I don’t think I have found the right partner yet.
“He tried to, but the judge wouldn’t even let him say more than that he didn’t do it. And he refused the potion. God knows why.”
“But what if they were death eaters? I don’t think they would have been too open about it,” I bore because I am sure that Spy A was a marked one, otherwise he would have never had so much information.
“ – depends on the person, I know,” I shake my head sadly, “Never thought I would wish for him to return to infant-state.”
“Malfoy?” I approach him carefully and lay a hand on his shoulder.
“Draco?” I ask, only to receive a grunt in response. With a slight smile I amend, “Malfoy. I am going to put my hand on your shoulder, alright? It’s just me.”
Anyway, the next chapter finally. With actual plot this time.
I apologize for the long delay in posting.
Now to you and your wife. First I guess I have to say sorry to Lou for being angry at her all this time. I stole my own chances at being with you, not she. She just looked after you when you needed someone to be there. I wasn’t, she was. And she did great with Orion, our son, and your own child. You chose her well. I also have to thank her for taking care of you. But I can talk to her after I am finished with you. I will say everything I never could while you were still alive. I am not going to forgive you easily for never telling me the truth, but that’s not the most important thing. It is that you finally learn how much I care for you. That I want to be with you.
“Well, you can be sure I was,” I rub his shoulder and to my surprise feel him relax, “Without you many people would be dead and we might have lost the war.”
Unfortunately not everything goes perfect as Draco proves to me on the afternoon two days after Dragon’s arrival. I have just brought him back to the living room from a nap after lunch. Hermione and I have been trying to establish a clear daily routine for him to make him feel safer. The nap is part of that. After seating him in his usual chair, I leave for the kitchen to prepare some tea. Only to be startled out of my peace when a loud crash sounds from the other direction. It is followed by a surprised hiss and something that sounds like a squeak. Immediately I am on full alert.
“I guess so. Usually he at least turns the head towards you when you try to speak to him. Do you want to get him out or should I?” he asks finally, not seeing any use of further calling anymore.
A bit tentatively I stroke the top of the animal’s head. She purrs but somehow it doesn’t feel right. So I shake my head slightly.
“Helping the patients is my goal. Seeing him and the others smile is the best reward.”
“That sounds good,” I smile thankfully.
“You want me to stay? Here? In your room,” I look at him surprised.
When I look up the waitress, Lena, is standing there, holding two menus and staring at us. Draco has jumped and, in an attempt to bury deeper into the corner, banged his sensitive left hand on the table. Now he has his other hand over his mouth to stop himself from making any noises and is staring at Lena in wide-eyed fear. Luckily he looks still clear and is effectively fighting his instinct to run.
Yes, the Ministry does care so little about Draco's case that they don't inform their employees that Harry has already been questioned and Draco can't speak.
She hums approvingly but then frowns, “Wait a minute. I remember that report about this. The warning about that attack on the muggle governor’s family.”
Orion came to me yesterday. He handed me a letter. I am well over 100 now so I guess he wanted me to see it before I died. It was the last thing you wrote apparently before you left this world. He seemed ashamed when he gave it to me because the letter said to never tell me. But according to him he felt that I had a right to know.
“An innocent?” they are staring at me confused.
She gives him a short smile, which he ignores, before she turns to me, “Keep an eye on him and ask him the rest of the questions when you think it’s the right time. It would be good if you could do it within the week though.”
“New horses? Where is Kari? Will she be there?” he asks confusedly, “You said I could keep her.”
“Soup?”
With interest I turn the scrap around. I nod eagerly when I read through the words on it.
I sigh, “Agreed. Do you know any spell that could do that?”
Carefully I coax Draco through. The woman takes a respectful distance but he is shying away nonetheless. Hermione follows us and thanks the stranger tensely before focusing back on us. But she knows better than to touch Draco right now. In such an anxious state he could react negatively to any touch. Luckily, the horses once again work like a charm and some tension leaves his frame.
“Okay,” I agree and as she says, scoop up a spoon of mashed potatoes and hold it to Draco’s lips. He doesn’t react like last time, so I sigh and prod the chapped lips, “Hey Draco, you have to eat. I said it this morning already. Draco!”
“That mare,” he points at the grey one Draco is petting and by now nearly leaning on, “Is one of the most difficult horses we have. She used to be a racing champion, but after an injury she got retired, unfortunately it also turned her volatile. Nowadays there are only few persons who can so much as touch her without her trying to bite them.”
“What did she look like?” I keep on asking.
I'm back. Exams are over and except the last one it went comparatively well. I think...
Sorry for being a day late. But I was busy with university and driving yesterday. My internet cut out right before I could post.
Hello everyone,
“But,” she sniffles, “But we wanted to marry one day and…”
“Hm,” I mumble, “I don’t know. I always felt that they somehow loved me for the fact that I am Harry Potter, the wizarding world’s saviour. At least partly. I don’t want that. I want someone who sees me as Harry and only Harry.”
Hello everyone,
Two weeks later there is no solution in sight yet. Granted none of us has had much time to look into it because we are still working on rebuilding everything. My favourite place is still Hogwarts despite the memories of the final battle now connected to it. I am clearing some hallway from rubble when professor McGonnagall approaches me.
“What’s wrong?” I ask, but when I try to reach for him, he steps back and burrows his nose deeper into a slightly exasperated looking cat.
“All right now, Draco?” I ask and he nods, “Okay. Goodnight then.”
“Andromeda?” he tilts his head in confusion.
Suddenly a soft hand on my clenched fists makes me look up, only to meet Luna’s clear orbs, “You have to get him out of there,” she says with an unknown urgency, “Azkaban is harrowing and soul-destroying enough for a stable person, but someone as imbalanced as Draco…”
He is making progress but it is only a tiny piece of all we have to achieve. He has still not made a single sound apart from a few whimpers, groans and sighs. His left hand hasn’t made more than a few twitches, it’s immobile no matter what I try. But I wouldn’t dare to push him again. I know that to cure him we still have a few episodes like that ahead of us, but he desperately doesn’t need me triggering even more than strictly necessary. And I don’t want to see that again either.
“I am,” I repeat patiently, “I believe in you.”
“No, of course not,” she soothes, “What I meant to say is that his body is going to heal, yes, but the risk is high that his mind never will. He is operating on little more than instincts and muscle memory right now. The rest of his mind has shut down after all the trauma he went through.”
I know you saw me and you saw Orion. Will you recognize your own eyes when he’s sitting in your class? I hope not. As far as he knows, his other parent is dead. That they died a hero, but Orion knows he should not speak about both of his parents. I am still not really accepted in this society and I thought long whether to send my son to Hogwarts instead of a different school, but it seemed wrong not to. I’m pretty sure you know he’s in Slytherin. Again ironic, don’t you think? The saviour’s son in the evil house of snakes. But he’s strong, you can feel his magic. He is making me so proud, you would be too if you knew. But you won’t. You still don’t remember our night so you will never know.
“I’m sorry,” I averts his eyes, “I didn’t know.”
He gives me another unintelligible sound, but doesn’t twitch when my palm makes contact with his coat. I start rubbing calming circles. They do little to actually relax him but at least it doesn’t get worse.
Hello everyone,
“Sorry, I don’t know what you are trying to tell me,” I shake my head.
“I know. Just a short answer, maybe? Otherwise the question is going to come up in the middle of the trial and you might prefer not to say it in front of countless people.”
I chuckle, “You switched from supporting me during the war to fighting for the rights of death eaters. Am I supposed to feel offended?”
Summoning a paper and filling out the blanks on it, he fixes me with a stern gaze, “Take care however, Harry. I don’t know exactly what will await you down there. I am sure Malfoy will not be who you remember. You have to be careful with him. And report to me about his state please. Just a last question. Where do you plan on where he will stay?”
“I’m sorry,” I offer but he only smiles.
“Me?” I ask incredulously.
“So, you can stand?”
“Who didn’t deserve what?” Ron yells after me while the two follow behind.
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t get you out of there earlier. You never deserved that. You sacrificed everything and had to pay even more. It’s not fair,” I lean forward a bit, “But now you’re free. You are never going back to Azkaban again. I will take care of you, I promise. I will make sure you can become a normal person again. Just give me a sign you’re still in there.”
When that question causes Dragon to meow even louder, worry creeps into my chest. Draco didn’t respond to me calling out but that’s normal. Seeing an agitated cat without any blonde human is far less usual though. I stand up straight again, calling out Draco’s name. Worry rising, I feel out for the diagnostic spells I put up around him, but I can’t feel them. Once again that doesn’t necessarily mean anything bad since he has come into the habit of disabling them with his own magic when he is clear. He clearly doesn’t want to be under constant surveillance.
I finally got a new laptop. I'm still struggling a bit with it though so this chapter is still rushed.
~ * ~
“No one cares and no one should care. I am disgusting and broken, so leave me alone and find a different charity case!” his voice breaks as I am just sitting there frozen. He changes to mumbling, “Father was right. I should have just…”
“Did someone maybe kidnap him?” she frowns.
“Why? Because you couldn’t finish your newest project to satisfy your saviour complex,” he snorts, now forcefully ripping himself away.
“I’m sure you didn’t do that on your own,” a shaky nod follows, “Who ordered you to do it?”
Have you ever though what I would feel? I snort. I guess you did and that’s what landed us in this situation. Now that I think back, my thoughts land on that argument we had over why you quit playing Quidditch. Solved that too, but you must have been pregnant while we shouted insults at each other. I can only imagine how painful that must have been for you. Why, Malfoy, no Draco? Why? I cared so much for you. Did you feel differently? No, you wouldn’t have slept with me and tried to spare me the embarrassment afterwards if you did. I would have loved to take care of Orion and you. To become a family with you. Instead I had to wait until our grandchildren married.
Unfortunately before I can say anything more the door behind me creaks open. As it catches Andromeda’s attention, the flames brighten once again. I don’t even have time to look around before a scared screech sounds from the door. Immediately I am on my feet to see Draco cowering against to the doorframe, his hand gripping the cat in his arms so hard, it causes the animal to screech in protest at the nails digging into his flesh. Hearing Dragon’s sound, Draco lessens his grip and pulls the small body in front of his face, palm flattening so that he doesn’t hurt the cat any further.
“Then we will have to believe the reports of eyewitnesses and what other death eaters told us about you. That makes you guilty of all charges,” he explains nearly gleefully.
“Yeah, apparently he has started remembering things past his infant years. That means he gets panic attacks about everything and anything.”
“But you bought us time,” I have approached him during our talk and am now close enough to lay a hand on his arm. He stiffens at the contact and tries to pull away but I squeeze minimally and he relents even though he still looks ready to run, “Enough time to manage an escape.”
“For one, I should apologize for the behaviour of my colleague yesterday,” he bows his head.
He nods, “Goodnight,” he repeats with a nervous smile, before his eyes fall closed.
But just as I am about to take his left arm to put it in the sling, it twitches. Twitches away. But the rest of his body didn’t really move, so it could only have been caused by a muscle directly in his arm. I smile softly. ‘Small progress once again,’ I think while I rub said arm in encouragement. That earns me a wide-eyed look from the blonde, but he doesn’t make any move away either.
We do still spend some time wandering mostly aimless, but with the strange device we at least manage to find a direction. In the end we land in an area of housings with several small side alleys. There the device tells us that we are in the closest radius.
“That would be good, yes. Maybe also a horse with a lighter colour. He’s seen god knows enough darkness. A patient animal but one who sometimes initiates contact by themselves?” I just ramble of what comes to my mind.
“You have to understand. The judges are biased. All they hear is the name ‘Malfoy’, they think deatheater and the last thing they want is to do him any good. They were disgruntled enough that he won’t come to court, but relented when I handed them a censored version of the list of his problems. Every step towards justice for him is a fight and the more he cooperates, the easier it will be,” she seems just as desperate.
Where are you, Draco Malfoy?
“No problem honestly. I understand your desire to help him and he needs it. Besides Mrs Weasley nearly forced me to come here no matter what Ron protested after I told her about it. She nearly came herself but since we found out that Draco has an aversion against the colour red we decided it’s better that she stays away,” she nods to me.
The next day I take off from my work at Hogwarts, it’s a Sunday anyway. Instead I pour over the papers I got about Spy A. There are quite a lot for the last year of the war. Sometimes there are breaks but after such a hole there is always a whole lot of information. And it is fascinating. Whoever reported that really must have been close to the source, voluntarily or not. Positioning of many death eaters. Planned attacks. What exactly Voldemort knows and what he doesn’t.
“What’s the last thing you remember?” I ask.
“Uhm Draco, not to interrupt. But are you sure you should be taking a normal saddle? You haven’t used one before,” I ask him cautiously. He throws me a disdainful, unbelieving look and I amend, “Alright, maybe you used to. But a lot of things changed since then,” he rolls his eyes and turns away, “Draco, please. I’m worried.”
“Neither do I,” I agree.
“Hello Harry. Great that you are here,” she walks over and embraces me.
“What?” her question catches me completely off guard.
“I know,” now I can’t help pulling him to me, “Believe me I know. But I also know that you can do this and overcome your trauma. You have made it so far already,” I feel a bit like a broken record by now, but if it helps him heal, I’m happy to repeat it every day again and again.
She pulls a face, “Yes and no. Technically it’s not allowed to simply take a family’s money and properties as long as there is still an heir of sound mind. However they declared it as reparations for what the Malfoys did during the war, which made it kind of a grey zone. The wizarding world didn’t complain though.”
Comments are always appreciated and see you next time.
Three weeks later I’m running out of ideas. At the beginning going to the café seemed to help Draco, but recently he has turned worse again. He is more easily startled, scaring due to the smallest things sometimes. I have no idea what to do anymore. Bringing up the fact that we should maybe stop going out to the blonde, only has him glaring at me and snapping at me, even if the hands he is clutching Dragon with are shaking badly enough to have the cat meow in complaint.
He smiles back at me, grey eyes who so oft sparked animosity at me are looking at me with complete trust. A warm feeling fills my chest. I push the thoughts of what is ahead of us aside and instead lean down and burrow my nose in the bright strands.
running his right hand over it and pulling it to himself when he fell asleep.”
“No, actually I didn’t,” she glares at my relieved expression, “No, it’s from Mrs. Weasley. I told her about the situation and she was surprisingly sympathetic and immediately cooked up a variety of foods since I wasn’t sure what Draco liked.”
“Too often he doesn’t,” the man answers sadly, “On his good days he is alert enough to recognise his own name. But on the bad days… A bomb could go off next to his face and he probably wouldn’t even notice it.”
“And if he falls?” I can’t help but ask.
Eventually he seems to manage to get the right grip to lift the saddle. He grunts and I see the weak muscles in his arms strain as he lifts the heavy saddle up. Instinctively I take a step forward to help him but he glares at me and I stop. I follow him closer on his way back though. I can see the strain the weight is putting on him when he sways and his arms shake. I see his face twitch as well which has me worrying that he is about to drop off again. I hurriedly take another step closer. Luckily there is a stand for the saddle in front of Shenan’s window and he manages to put the equipment on it before his arms completely give away. He stumbles and bangs his shoulder against the wall. He cringes and slumps.
Second, these chapters were written years ago and now reading through them again to find mistakes I missed last time, I am not as happy with how I wrote it, but it's too late to make major changes. But it's only a few chapters before I like my own story again.
“You will?” Still suspicious.
I don’t know what I expect but it certainly isn’t this. Again it takes some time until he even does anything. But then he slowly reaches out one of his bone-thin hands towards me. It is slow and shaking but he certainly does react. Then his ice-cold hand lands on my cheek, that crooked smile still on his face. He isn’t even really looking at me. I gasp and my pained face falls against the bed.
I shake my head, “No, she… had an accident. And Draco on the other hand went through a lot of trauma. From childhood on.”
“That’s great,” she says, “You’re doing great, Draco.”
I stare at him, trying to read him. His hands are still clenched in his clothing, but his posture is straight. He won’t back down about this. So I sigh.
“That would be good,” I thank her.
The next question has me glaring and I turn to Hermione, “Why isn’t that one red?”
“Good,” I smile.
“Good!” he smiles, “He play with me?”
True to my word just after Hermione has left again, I walk down to the room where I stored the two boxes with the few things left after the burning of the Manor. After ruffling through a bunch of paper I finally come across the stuffed dragon I remembered from the first time looking through the boxes. A sad smile comes to my face when I pull the toy out. It still mostly smells of fire and ashes. With a sigh I pull out my wand and mumble a few spells over the toy. I manage to clear it from the awful smell and change it to that of fresh grass. I run my hand over the back of the dragon where some of the green fabric has been rubbed off a bit.
“Okay, now I still need you to turn over. I know you hate this, but I can’t leave it like this,” I urge him, softly pushing him from the side. He goes lax again, causing me to cringe, “Sorry, I really am. But I have to do this.” As he is completely pliant, I can turn him over, so he is leaning against the wall on the other side of the tub. My cheeks are bright red, but I run the washcloth over his backside. I run my tongue over my lips nervously, “Look I hate to do this too, but you have to endure it,” my own hand is shaking as I clean the last of him.
“Clear moment over,” I say sadly as Andrea nods and walks off to fetch the gear.
“Taken everything from him that mattered and then broken him further,” Michael answers from the door, “Come on, let’s get him out of there. He has stayed here far too long and now he can finally leave. Don’t make it longer than necessary.”
His hand comes back to slowly running over the dragon. He tilts his head at me in what I take as thanks. I smile when I see him focus on the toy, right hand closing around the animal. I smile a last time as I lean forward again to ease him down into the sheets again. He pulls the dragon to his chest, nose rubbing against the animal’s snout. He looks so much like a child in that moment it clenches my chest further. I stroke his hair until his eyes fall closed completely and his breathing evens out into calm sleep. Then I bend down, stopping just before pressing a kiss to his forehead like I do when I tuck in Teddy. But knowing he could react badly to the unexpected touch I instead straighten up and after another look to him, leave the room again.
The time of the healer exam, Friday morning, finds me tired and on too much caffeine. But Draco had a relapse yesterday when a dog threw a fit close to the house while the other man was in the backyard. I wasn’t there and only got called out there by him screaming. The dog wasn’t anywhere close to him, but it still sounded loudly into our garden. I am not surprised he jumped and got scared. Nonetheless it caused a bit of a relapse and I spent the afternoon and most of the night soothing him and trying to coax him back to bed. He only fell asleep past three this night. Since I lost a whole half day of studying I had to make it up in what little time was left until I had to be at the school. Hermione only came back from a trip this morning, so I couldn’t call on her. She only arrived early today, looking as tired as me. During the night I have drank so many coffees I lost count long ago. I suppose I look half like a zombie as I stumble into the room.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
It earns me a round of laughter but I ignore it and drink another gulp from my newest coffee. Instead I stumble over to my chair and bury myself anew into a summary of what I have to know for the exam.
The cat only purrs and pushes against my hand. I take it as an agreement and walk to the stairs. The girl follows me, furball still in her arms. I motion her to wait for a moment in once we reach the door to the living room and enter first. Draco is sitting slumped in his chair as usual. His long blond hair is combed and pulled back, fresh but simple clothes hanging off his still bony figure. He doesn’t really react when I enter, just keeps running his fingers over the stuffed dragon still in his lap. I kneel in front of him as I do often to be in his line of sight.
He only whimpers and from what I can see without glasses, he is curled under the blankets. Squinting my eyes I approach the lump on the bed. When I call out, all I get back is another whimper. With a sigh I sit down next to what I think is his head. I summon my glasses while he still completely hiding his under the blanket and can’t see the magic use. It’s a very childish move, so he is obviously not clear right now. But that’s always a gamble after a nightmare.
“I wouldn’t advise it, but if you think he is alright…” he stares at the horses, “You know him much better than I do.”
“Then what?”
She squirms a bit but relents in the end, “I did a few scans on him and his mental state while you were preparing the tea. Right now he is still at toddler stage, somewhere between mostly instinctual behaviour and more elaborate ones, but his mind is slowly starting to wake up more and more.”
Just as I am finishing that thought, the cackle sounds again. But this time I am unable to move and a figure that looks like a dementor floats down on the other side of the clearing. I scream when I realise that the being has Voldemort’s face.
“You also presented new evidence that he worked as a spy during the war, do you know more about that?”
Big Warnings: mentions of domestic abuse, torture and rape.
thank you for all the comments and kudos.
Draco screams.
I can’t help but release a breath in relief. So she isn’t your lover or wife then. I don’t even need to question why I feel such relief at that revelation. So she is most likely that Lou-person Orion talked about. Something like his adopted mother. But hearing that you lost a lover is sad. Just another bad thing that happened to you. Did you ever have luck in your life?
I deeply apologize for the delay in uploads.
I just smile and lean back into my armchair, taking a sip from my tea. After a few moments of silence her brow furrows though.
“Hey Draco,” I try to catch his attention, “I brought a new friend for you,” nothing more than another blink, “Do you remember the cat you had when you were young? I think she was called Dhalia,” I exchange a look with Hermione, “So I thought maybe a new cat could be a nice friend for you.”
He only huffs and I chuckle.
“His mother has mental problems too? Could it be an inheritable condition?” she frowns.
“You didn’t really either,” she grins, “Yet here we are,” then she shakes her head, “I’m not specifically doing this for Draco. I believe in justice and it’s not been served here, so I want to correct it.”
“I think those prisoners on the lowest layers are treated way too awfully. Every person, criminal or not, deserves to be treated at least human. They aren’t. He thinks the same,” she smiles.
“What do you mean?” immediately I am down at his level again, eyes scanning his form for injuries, “Are you hurt? Did you fall?”
“No, but you have no idea how glad I am to hear you insult me,” I can’t stop the giddy feeling.
“How did he react?”
Today’s study session though is interrupted by the floo flaring, alerting me to an incoming call. I throw a cautious look towards the door to make sure Draco isn’t coming in. It’s been a long time since he saw the green flames last, but when he did it ended with him hiding in the corner for the better part of an hour. He might be better adjusted now, but that would probably stretching it. When I see that he’s nowhere close I step in front of the fire, the floo telling me that it’s just Andromeda calling.
“I am here to take – “ he starts to repeat, annoyance seeping into his tone.
“Draco,” I call as I approach him carefully, “Draco, wake up!”
I nod, but the smile never leaves my face, “I know. Believe me I didn’t forget that. But we have to be happy about the small steps he takes. And that is one of those steps. There is a difference between an unmoving toy and an actual animal. So I will stick to that for today and think about his next breakdown after I woke him up tomorrow.”
Another blink followed by some moments of silence then, “Won’t hurt him?” wide grey eyes turn to me, making my heart clench.
You will never know we spent a night together in sixth year. You will never know you have a son even older than James. You will never know that I still love you. Because of one Obliviate, because of one sentence maybe carelessly spoken by you, you will never know any of this.
“No, I don’t think so,” I frown, something coming to my mind. Instead of the spoon I tear off a chunk of bread and push it in his hand. I smile when he, as I expected, grabs the food securely and starts pulling little pieces from it, slowly eating one after the other, “It’s not that he can’t eat by himself. He did it with a croissant this morning too. It’s just that he isn’t used to eating with cutlery anymore. I doubt they got any spoons down there, so he used his fingers for everything.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter. Of course,” she nods, “I’m sorry. There is always so much during the day it must have gotten lost,” I just wave it off and she smiles brighter, petting the light horse which had been nudging me before, “So what can I do for you?”
“I know, I was just worried,” I sigh, tuck Draco’s arm back against his body and stroke his hair a last time before standing up.
I have also found nearly everything in here by now. From prototypes for school letters over grading sheets and lists of pupils. From personal letters between Order members over meeting protocols to attack plans and even the occasional spy report. I also found some knitting magazines that belonged (with 99% certainty) to Dumbledore and a few of the aforementioned sweets bills. I sigh and cough as I pull at a dusty box in the corner.
“I agree. He reminded me of a child today.”
“How long have you been awake?” I ask him.
Eventually he grabs it and then nearly makes a run for it, as much as he is capable of that, away from us other humans. Shenan snorts but follows the boy happily, moving into a slow trot to catch up with him. Andrea shakes her head in amusement and we retreat to the door of the hall. We watch him lead the horse around the space at an even pace, his movements more stable than they were without her along. After about ten minutes he stops. I frown but this time it’s Andrea who stops me. So I just watch him. He loops the rope loosely around his shoulder. Then with sure movements he starts to fiddle with the girth around the mare’s stomach. Andrea stares with something close to astonishment how he carefully tightens both straps by two holes.
“Do you like the horses?” Andrea asks.
Anyway it works in my favour as all the Malfoy house elves are still in the Manor. But unfortunately the Manor is classified as a dark magical site. That means you need a special permission to be allowed to enter the wards that were placed around it. Ridiculous if you ask me. The ministry should focus on other things than that. And it apparently it does sometimes since it takes me two whole weeks and three letters until I finally get said permission. Sometimes they are unbelievable…
He shakes his head wildly and tries to dive back into his blanket, but I prevent it, “White-white skin… evil face… snake…” he forces out, burying into my thigh instead.
“Broken bones, 16 in the last year alone…” Hermione breathes, a shocked hand on her mouth, “Bruises and cuts, more than I can count… Severe damage to internal organs…” she chokes, “Heavy anal scarring…?!”
Sorry for the long break. Hope you like the chapter nonetheless.
“Yes, if someone is a confirmed spy they can’t be accused of crimes they committed while hiding in the dark lords ranks,” he agrees, “However I don’t see what this has to do with Malfoy.”
We ran another diagnostic spell over Draco because we knew that a clear diagnosis would be required. Hermione helped me put it in a way that muggles would accept with official doctor’s signature and so on. I see Andrea carefully studying the sheet, her forehead creasing. Eventually she looks up at me, a pained expression hiding in the back of her eyes.
“That’s interesting,” he says as he tips the silver into a nearby pensive, “And you are sure this memory is not altered?”
It earns me a strange look but in the end she dismisses it, “I have seen riding students who are worse at saddling then he is.”
I sigh at his stubbornness, “Okay, but at least let me help you.”
“Why me?”
Hello everyone,
“You’re hungry?” he nods and I throw a look at the clock. My eyes widen, “No wonder, it’s already past ten in the morning. Damn, I overslept quite a bit. Sorry,” I rub the back of my neck, “Give me a moment, alright?”
“He sneaked up on me and got me at wandpoint with my back to him. He had enough time to kill or at least stun me but he didn’t. Instead he waited until Hermione came around the corner and fired a spell at him.”
“What? A mistake? Why?” he stumbles out, still shocked.
I sigh, does he have to see the worst in everything I say? “That’s not true as I already told you. My professors don’t even know that you live here.”
She only nods, then grabs my arm and before I can so much as open my mouth, she apparates us both. Only to reappear in the middle of the ministry’s atrium. With a determined face she pulls me towards the elevators.
Hermione stands up, only to pace in front of the sofa, “It’s… He’s a bit like you.”
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
“It’s fine,” she waves it off, “I will give Shenan time to calm down and clean her up myself. You take Draco home.”
“Yes, sleeping on the ground must hurt,” the voice sighs, a hand tapping on my shoulder, “Get up, Harry.”
“Leave me alone, Potter. I don’t need your pity! Go away!” he screams.
Hello everyone,
“He’s fine,” I respond, “Still asleep, last time I checked.”
“Unfortunately I don’t know anything. But this came through the fireplace one day. It had an urgency marking on it and when I showed it to Remus he cursed and flooed away immediately. When he came back he told me to destroy it but at the time I thought I had misplaced it so it survived until now,” she explains hurriedly, handing me the paper and taking Teddy back into her arms, “I think that could perhaps be useful to you.”
Hello everyone,
The guard (it reads Michael on his nametag) nods and makes a short notice over the magic walkie-talkie on his belt. Then he comes out from behind their desk and waves to us. Entering the first room, he turns around.
He is sitting in his usual chair, still slumped but his posture portrays a bit more strength than when he came here. Like I said, small victories. He also looks cleaned up now. The nearly white hair is pulled into a neat ponytail at the back of his neck. A green band secures it in place. His face is comparatively relaxed. Nothing can change his pale skin except getting outside, something we can’t do at the moment. He is still thin and looks somehow hollowed out but again he is a good deal better than before. Dragon is curled up on his lap, purring contentedly. The stuffed toy is on a table not far, but the blonde’s focus is on the cat, whose tail is twitching lazily. Draco’s fingers are running through the white animal’s fur, face soft. He is even making a small humming noise in the back of his throat. It’s not speaking yet, but it’s something new either way.
“Awake as in not sleeping or completely aware?” he glares viciously back.
“Night,” the blonde mumbles into his dragon.
I nearly fall from my seat on the sofa, “What? Why would the Manor burn down?”
At her sharp intake of breath, I remember with a shock that I never mentioned what exactly we read in her sister’s diary to her. But before I can argue she just waves her hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” she nods thoughtfully, “Anyway,” she motions to the book, “I may have some ideas on how to start with Draco.”
“Okay, for now it’s the stuffed dragon then,” I smile at him as he finishes his biscuit and tentatively twitches with his hand towards the food tray for another. He doesn’t have the strength yet to get it himself so I grab behind me and hand it to him.
“What?” I shake my head, “The cup? It – “
I also didn't proofread it another time.
He only snorts. I yawn, sliding further into the sofa. I can’t keep my eyes open for long and doze off with his head still on my shoulder.
I wrote that note years ago, but since I never uploaded the chapter on fanfiction.net, it remained in Word.
From the first lesson on I can feel Orion’s magical strength. Were you similarly strong back then? I never noticed. I remember sitting at the front of my classroom as the Slytherin and Gryffindor first years trickled in. Suddenly I felt a magical presence much stronger than I expected in elven year olds. When I looked up I immediately spotted the blond head. Surprised I stared at him and couldn’t help but wonder who his mother was. Again I feel that strange sting in my chest at that thought but defiantly ignore it.
“So no official guardians. That means you are the one taking care of him I guess?”
“How is your father, Orion?” I try to be unsuspicious (I guess I fail; but I don’t really care, I want to know what you are doing these days).
“If you want that I never will,” she answers softly, running her fingers through my hair.
For a moment he tilts his head in a confused or nervous gesture then blinks in a way that I have come to associate with his way of saying ‘yes’ to something. I smile. A small step, but it’s moving forward nonetheless. So I place the croissant back on the plate.
I love their moment at the end though :)
Hermione giggles, “That’s true. But you should go catch your toddler before he hurts himself or causes some kind of ruckus.”
Disclaimer: The two of them have never been mine, just Dragon is.
I teach your son for about two months until my curiosity gets the better of me. I constantly feel the urge to talk to him. Is it because he is your son? I never managed to get myself to stop talking to (or about) you, no matter how much we fought. So one day when he stays after the lesson to ask some more questions about our current subject I lead the conversation to the topic of his family.
“You too,” he grins up at me, “Where is?”
“How do you control your horse then?” I stare confused.
She pouts, “These are no games. I love you.”
“They did get the alarm. But whoever was responsible for keeping track of it ignored it and let the intruders do as they pleased. The suspicion is that they were working together with the group that attacked.”
So the next morning finds me sitting anxiously on Draco’s bedside. My wards didn’t give any alert during the night so he should still be calm. Hermione is here as well. But she is still sleeping.
“I agree, I want to get out of here. And Malfoy really needs some fresh air,” Hermione nods as well, darting nervous looks around.
“I know,” I sigh, but before I lose myself in thoughts about Malfoy again, I focus back on the actual reason for my visit here, “Since we are already on the subject of Malfoy Manor, I want to ask something.”
There is not much time for me to fall into these thoughts again though because my fireplace flares up angrily again and a chaos of dark robes and frizzly brown hair tumbles out of it. I am on my feet before I have registered it and catch the person who turns out to be Hermione. Pulling her up, I look at her face concerned.
“That’s not a quill like Skeeter’s is it?” I eye the thing worriedly.
“No, too tired,” I mumble back.
I apologize for the slow updates.
He is gaping at me, completely frozen. I take that as a yes and slam the door in his face. Just to convey my anger further, I forcefully erect new wards which throw the ministry employee right on his ass in the middle of the sidewalk. I huff as soon as that is done. But then Draco’s picture reappears in my mind and all anger leaves my body and I slump against the door. Burrowing my face in my hands I groan. All I can do it hope is that the set-back from today’s incident won’t be too bad. Tiredly I send off a message to Hermione before I manage to sort my limbs out and walk upstairs to Draco’s room again. On the way there I summon myself a hot chocolate. I need the comfort.
“It’s sweet how he reacts to those commands from you,” she smiles.
There Draco is indeed, still looking paler than two days ago, his muscles slightly tense. Nonetheless he looks up from the book on his lap when the door creaks open. He gives me a tight smile as he spots me. I smile back and let myself fall onto the sofa next to him. My left hand strokes his hair and he calms down, letting his head fall against me.
“I doubt that is going to happen, but the one memory should be enough to convince the ministry. Together with the reports,” I say as I dip my head into the fluid, the girl following me.
She ushers me over, smiling, and stuffs me between Ron and George at the table. I don’t have the heart to tell her that I am not that hungry since all I have been doing was sort papers all day, not clearing and rebuilding the castle as she most likely thinks.
“Good,” I smile back, “Can I see him? Or is he already sleeping?”
Blinking once, grey eyes focus slowly back on me and he tilts his head curiously. His right hand stretches out and pats the bed. After a few moments of confusion he starts to make distressed noises. It takes even longer for me to realise that he is looking for his stuffed dragon.
“Horse therapy?” it earns me a curious look.
“Not really. I just discovered how deep his abuse really went,” I sigh wearily.
I am not entirely sure what to think of what he said but I can’t help but smile as I happily comply with his request, “Of course I will stay, Draco. But you have to move over a bit.”
He snorts but doesn’t move. I see Lena approaching our table carefully, a questioning look in her eyes, but I shake my head and she turns away again. If we order something I will walk up to the counter myself to order and collect it.
“That was close,” I breathe, “Alright. So you can drink on your own but hold nothing even a bit heavier for longer than a minute. We might have to work on that.”
‘Ah, Voldemort,’ I sigh. To no one’s surprise this or some variation of that time is the most common subject in his nightmares. I’ve tried to talk to him about it, but he refused. His childish self didn’t understand, only that he was terrified, and when he was clear, he simply told me to go away. Therapy would technically be a good option, but he can’t even remain clear yet, so I have to postpone that.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“Alright,” she nods, “How about we go to riding hall. We have a smaller one where no one else will bother us. A horse is already waiting there.”
Deep wariness in his eyes Draco detaches his moving hand from the doorframe and carefully reaches for Dragon, like expecting even a toddler to pull his cat away from him again any second. When his fingertips touch soft fur, he twitches away at first. But when the cat gives a loud meow, he reaches out again and carefully grips the small creature. Lifting the cat out of Teddy’s hands, he hurriedly pulls the animal to his face and nuzzles the soft fur. Dragon releases a soft purr and Draco relaxes for a tiny bit. That earns them a satisfied grin from the toddler on the floor. Andromeda has a hand over her mouth, her eyes suspiciously wet.
“You were enemies and now you’re taking care of him. What changed your opinion towards him?” he carefully phrases it differently.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“Yes,” a sad smile returns to her face, “But you never knew him as who he was in the beginning, did you?”
“It’s fine,” she is smiling as well now, “Thank you for your words.”
Thank you for all your comments.
“That’s good,” she gives a soft smile.
“He seems more subdued from usual…” she mentions.
He doesn’t respond, so I repeat my question. When he continues to remain silent, I carefully nudge his face from where it’s buried in my stomach. Only to discover his grey eyes closed. His face is still pulled in a frown and he is not sleeping completely peacefully, but he is asleep. I am very tempted to bury my face in my hands. It’s not the first time one of his alarms ended with him falling asleep again after talking to me for a few seconds. Sometimes he can’t even remember that in the morning, but I certainly wakes me up every time. Luckily I have adapted to sleeping for a few hours only from my days on the run.
“He’s…” she stares in confusion, “Where did he get – Did he saddle Shenan?”
He snorts with something that might have been disgust, “I would if I could.”
bit late, I know.
“So he is really getting better?” her surprising question brings my thoughts immediately back to the subject I have been trying to unsuccessfully avoid in the last hours.
“Is that good or bad?”
And if I am honest I miss the fights I had with Malfoy. His retorts, no matter how insulting, and the flashing of his grey eyes. But he isn’t at Hogwarts, rather he is rotting in Azkaban for crimes he didn’t commit. I haven’t given up on getting him out of the prison, but I haven’t gotten any further either. Neither is there any progress on the matter of Spy A. I have looked through any material the Order had but couldn’t find anything. Also school caught up with me. Only because Snape is not here anymore doesn’t make it any easier. With schoolwork, Quidditch and friends there is little time to ponder over mysterious men. I am already getting teased about having some unknown girlfriend (or boyfriend according to Seamus).
“I won’t let that happen,” I whisper, eyes locked with beautiful grey ones. Not looking at the girl, I clear my throat and change topic, “How is the trial going?”
“I have the money theoretically,” I answer, a good horse can’t be that expensive and with both my vault and whatever Hermione can get back for Draco we should be able to pay for it, “But if you have your own horse you need to take care of them every day and I don’t have the time for that. Draco can’t go out alone and he’s not clear every day.”
I sigh, “You’re right… I just…”
“Better than expected, I guess,” I answer with a scowl on my forehead, “I mean, he’s still responsive. Granted he lost some things but all in all I think it could have been worse.”
Fate seems to hate me however, because like in our school times our ways cross each other permanently on coincidence. This time it’s Diagon Alley. Lou and I are just returning home from work. Orion’s still at school, but as a teacher you can leave whenever you want.
“Can you do me a favour?” she asks.
~ * ~
“Just a small spell so that both of you can have a few hours of peaceful sleep,” she strokes over the pale cheek, “Never thought I would care about Draco Malfoy so much.”
He makes a sound of denial as he shuffles deeper into his blanket, “No… Don’t… Alone…”
“Now listen!” I growl, “I have a very unstable person in my house who just had a severe panic attack because you couldn’t fucking wait a few minutes until I opened. I see not a single reason to yell through my house like that. Not to mention that the ministry itself is mostly responsible for how bad a state he is really in, you respectless jerk.”
“I don’t know,” I shrug, “He doesn’t let me comfort him anymore. Whenever I try he just pushes me away or even gets aggressive.”
~ * ~
No, you won’t. Because you die earlier than me. Wizards usually live up for up to over 100 years but you don’t, just like your wife. Lou died in an accident two years earlier. You on the other hand die peacefully in your sleep from what I could find out. I am at your funeral, you know. Disguising myself though. No need to create a new headline for the Daily Prophet after all. Even now they are still haunting each of my more significant moves.
She shrugs with a sad smile, “You were someone he trusted and I feel like he would have wanted it like that.”
She chuckles, “Are you against being with another man?”
Until today I shiver when I think of that day. But no matter what I have tried I didn’t get any bit further in freeing Draco from his imprisonment. As for Spy A I still lack the final proof that it’s actually Draco. By now I have also checked off every other possibility just to make sure. The aurors found lists of the death eaters in Malfoy Manor. I managed to get a copy with the names of everyone who followed Voldemort. I went through every male name that had an ‘A’ in the initials. Half of them are dead, of the other half over two third are accounted for and I talked to them. In the end I can rule out all of them. That leaves me with five more who are either missing or have moved to other countries. But none of them seems anywhere believable. Three were lower ranked, another is nearly 70 now and the last proclaimed his belief in the dark lord even before he joined the death eaters. That leaves only Draco in the end. But I still lack the proof.
She nods with a soft smile, “I wasn’t denying that. I am always glad when the patient has someone who believes in them like you do. All I was saying is that it will be a difficult recovery. In all honesty I have only rarely seen a patient with such a bad condition,” when I want to open my mouth she holds up her hand, “Again, I am not turning him away. But are you sure horse therapy is the right way? Your friend’s problems seem to mostly be psychological while horse therapy tends to be used more for bodily issues.”
“I know,” I repeat her earlier answer, giddiness now gone from my tone, “Believe me I know. It’s actually sad seeing him like that once you sit back to think a bit about it. I meant it when I said I wanted a normal life for him. So what is it that you want to tell me?”
“Please,” I urge, “I don’t want anything bad. I want to help whoever it is. He might be imprisoned on unjust reasons. I want to free him. But I need his name, proof that he really did it.”
“Hermione Granger,” she answers, “I am a friend of Harry’s.”
I know I'm one week late, but I've either been actually busy or falling into holes which meant I was in no mood to do anything, updating included. Since I've been repeatedly told not to apologize for having a life, I won't even though I want to.
“Man seriously, you are going to empty Azkaban of prisoners if you continue like that,” Ron sighs, causing Hermione to giggle and me to glare at him.
~ * ~
I laugh softly, stopping Draco’s hand as it shoots out as if to hit me, “No, really, I’m fine. Besides I… Hm…” I break off embarrassed.
That smile was so familiar but not from you. Talking about it, I don’t remember ever seeing you smiling genuinely. It’s sad if I think about it. I would have loved to see you smile. A real smile that is. Were you ever truly happy? Your childhood was, wasn’t it? I always thought you were a rich, spoiled child. But after finding out about how much you hid behind masks, I really don’t know what to believe about you anymore. Will I ever know the truth? I want to, but you would never tell me. What is your story, Draco Malfoy? Your childhood, what you really felt and thought during Hogwarts, why you disappeared and what happened to you afterwards. Your true story. I want to meet you so badly.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
Some scars are just too deep to heal over, no matter how much time passes.
“That’s a story you do not want to hear, believe me.”
“Yes, thank you,” I say, shaking her hand, “Until next week.”
He frowns at me but nods hesitantly, “I will take an Earl Grey and… some pastry, I guess,” he fiddles with his sleeves beneath the table.
“Yes, see you then. And don’t forget your homework,” I shout after him.
“No, daddy said the Manor was too dark. He sold it and built a new mansion twenty miles outside from London,” he answers carefully.
He tilts his head to the side, eyes still wary. Then he detaches his hand from mine and rubs over his stomach. I understand after a moment.
“Bad experiences with fire?”
“Alone the fact that he managed to saddle her on his own. How did he get the saddle on her back? I didn’t think his arms were strong enough for that,” she frowns at the horse, “Did you help him?”
At least he’s calm, I feared he would be worse. But when I ask him what he wants to eat he doesn’t point at it anymore, like he started to in the last days. Instead we have to go through the longer routine of me picking everything up and him conveying ‘yes’ or ‘no’. In the end it still works out and he is peacefully munching on a biscuit when Hermione stumbles in tiredly. The door opening a bit quickly, startles Draco once more and he drops his food. I sigh and run a calming hand up and down his arm. Soon he accepts a new biscuit and eats it slowly. The girl seats herself on the sofa furthest from the blonde, a cup of coffee in her hands.
“Sorry, really. I didn’t mean to scare you,” I speak in a soft voice, kneeling on the floor in front of Draco, “You just startled me. I’m sorry. Draco, hey?”
“Yes,” I smile at her, “Thank you.”
I jump and try to force my tired legs faster. I would recognise that cackle anywhere. Voldemort! Not again. He’s dead and I know that but my body just keeps running.
I listen to her ramblings, the feeling of dread strengthening. I never thought they would treat him well. I have never been to that part of Azkaban (or the prison itself) but that it was that inhuman? Well, I should have suspected it, the prison is known to drive even perfectly sane people crazy. One of my hands clenches in my lap. What have they done to Draco?
She smiles, a fake smile, she’s as good at pretending as I am, “No, I am just a friend. Nothing more. Orion’s mother died long ago.”
“Is he alright?” Lena asks me worriedly, indicating towards my companion.
~ * ~
“I am sorry,” I immediately relent, “Thank you for telling me. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time. I will give you an excuse slip for the next lesson.”
Lou has experienced sexual abuse from a young age, so she is very sensitive when it comes to someone touching her. But apart from that she’s the best person I could imagine. And Orion loves her like a mother already. He even asked when I would marry her, so he could have a mommy.
I nod, “Thank you for your assistance. Is there anything we should know about him?”
Anyway, next chapter is here and I still don't own them.
“You always have a choice with me,” I try to reassure him, but all he does is raise his head completely. I stand up again, only to notice that he’s not following me. Worry shoots through me again, “Aren’t you coming?”
“Some do, but since when have we cared. We do what is right and most of the death eaters are as human as we all are. Even if the light side sometimes tends to forget that. Especially when they were forced into their role,” she explains, giving me a knowing smile.
Disclaimer: I don't own them.
“Like I said, it’s psychosomatic I think. He’s been having clear moments in the last weeks. During those times he’s mentally there enough to move his arm. Though never to this extent up until now,” I answer, watching the other boy with fascination.
She clamps a hand on my shoulder and nods, “It’s fine. We will help him however we can,” she motions in the direction of a door at the end of the stable, “How about we sign the papers and draw up a first appointment?”
“Sorry, but you can’t do that,” she hands him back the brush instead, “Shenan is well trained but even she can’t hold up her hooves on her own for that long. So to clean them you would need two hands, not just one.”
“But then,” I frown slightly, “Who is the boy then? Who are his parents?”
“It would seem that way,” the woman smiles, “Even now he seems to know exactly what he’s doing.”
“I don’t think it would have been a good idea,” Hermione shakes his head, “Yes, you might have prevented him from getting out today, but you would have locked him up. Even if it is for his own good, he would have seen it as just another prison. If he tried to get out to today only to realise he was locked in, you would have lost a big part of the trust you have worked so hard to gain.”
However the current situation isn't doing me any good. I used to shut myself inside my room one to two years ago due to my mental health on my own. It simply wasn't a good time for me. I got better during the last year but now that I'm forced to stay inside, everything is coming back which makes it difficult for me to update. So I'm sorry, I will try to do better and if I'm lucky germany might lighten the restictions again on the 20th of April.
“So there is no way around?” I cringe.
“Sounds good,” then I frown, “But the Manor burned and with it everything from Draco’s childhood didn’t it?”
Since a few weeks he is preparing and putting away Shenan on his own as far as he can do with one hand. He’s still not really allowed to go faster on the horse, but Andrea is not leading the horse as close as she did at the beginning and they did a few steps of trot the last times. He is also capable of walking by himself basically all the time, just prefers to still have something to hold onto.
long chapter today.
“We should also bind his magic for the time being,” I hear Hermione’s voice from behind me, “I mean, usually that’s not advised because it can hinder a patient’s development, but we are going to a muggle place. The humans and especially the horses have no experience with magic and we really don’t need him scaring any of them since he can’t control it.”
With a sigh I pull the boxes towards me. I take the lid of the first one. It smells slightly of fire and ashes and I pull a face. With a grin I pull out the first object. A small, stuffed, green dragon. It is worn like the most loved toy of a child. A wistful smile makes it’s way onto my face when I realise that it was most likely Draco’s. My search produces a small medallion. Some photos of the family in happier times, a baby Draco which makes me giggle at the sweet picture. The next are papers containing information especially important for the Malfoy family. The second box is the same but mostly stuffed with papers. Malfoy business and ancestry. Then I find what appears to be the marriage certificate of Narcissa and Lucius.
“Thank you,” I say again as I take the paper he is handing me.
“Fifth year at Hogwarts,” he answers what I have already read in the reports, “My father was trying to include me into deatheater business more and more. I started seeing that it was wrong, so I went to Dumbledore.”
Short warning, some more mentions towards rape. Just a short line, nothing happens.
“He suddenly woke up in an unfamiliar place if he didn’t have any memories of the past years,” she shrugs, “It was to be expected.”
I nod in his direction, stopping anyway, “Yes, thank you for the concern. I am just tired. Didn’t get any sleep last night.”
“And you want to protect me by not telling me that it can’t stay that way?” I make a guess, voice steady even though my stomach clenches at the thought of losing the joy now residing in Draco’s eyes.
“Because what the dark lord did and was planning was wrong and he needed to be stopped. I discovered that Severus was working as a spy, so I decided to go the same route, no matter how much he tried to dissuade me,” he answers in a cold voice.
“He think… Do… and… suprising… Shenan…” he mumbles softly.
“There might, but,” she shoots back, pulling the paper back, “I worry that he also may be too far gone already.”
From this passage it seems like Spy A also made sure that the prisoners kept in Malfoy Manor were at least treated properly. That may be a way to find out his identity. While I still doubt that he could have done that openly, maybe the prisoners know something. At least a clue.
thank you for the comments and kudos.
I roll my eyes, “Don’t play stupid. I know you think you are protecting me by trying not to burst my happy bubble or whatever, but I am old enough and we have been through enough by now, don’t you think? There is no reason to keep anything secret.”
In the morning I am woken by something prodding me and soft curious noises. My brain is slow to register and so it takes me some time until I manage to get my eyes open. Because I am still half-asleep the only thing that really registers in my brain is pale skin and white blond hair. Mind still in protective mode, it snaps back to the time of the war, when this hair colour could only mean one thing. That danger is here. Instinctively my hand goes to my wand, it flying into my fingers.
For a long time I had no idea what Draco's horse was supposed to look like (nor her name), until I saw a horse called 'Carenina' at the Munich Indoors 2018. White front turning into dapple-grey towards the hind legs. Legs, mane and tail nearly completely black.
“Great. I love my job and my kids,” you grin at me, are you somehow high? “You have a child too, don’t you? He’s in Hogwarts already. Orion was it, right?”
“I want to check it over. Just to make sure you are really not injured,” I say softly, “Can I see your arm? Please?”
“On the horse’s bare back?” I stare at him. How is that supposed work? I touched Shenan’s fur, it’s kind of slippery, I can’t imagine getting any kind of grip on that, “Isn’t that difficult? Or dangerous?”
I frown at the next question, “When did you get your Dark Mark?” I say hesitantly.
“You look like death, Harry,” Hermione’s voice sounds eventually.
“Better a mute toddler than comatose,” she sighs, but kneels next to me to hold Draco’s right arm still, “It’s quite nice to watch how he’s progressing, even though it’s still far from what we want to achieve in the end,” she chuckles, “And until then you have to take care of a six feet tall toddler. No problem, right? I mean you took care of Teddy didn’t you?”
“Maybe but he saved more lives than he hurt.”
Comments and kudos as always appreciated.
He just tugs at my hair, causing me to look at him. The crooked smile is back on his face and for once his empty orbs are focused on me. His eyes seem to say ‘Don’t worry, I can deal with it. I am past it’. I only shake my head and pull him close another time. And chuckle wryly, tears still on my cheeks.
“You are welcome,” he waves towards the door, “And now go. You can barely stand still anyway. Go and free your boyfriend.”
Days pass and Draco has his clear moments but never longer than a few seconds. Today I am sitting in my office, studying for an exam on magical diseases next week. The blonde is in the next room, playing with Dragon the last time I checked up on him. I have a listening spell on him that works like muggle baby-phones.
“Draco?” she smiles carefully, “Good actually. From what I can tell at least. You are better in tune with him than I am. But there was no problem while you were gone.”
“No one deserves that.”
“Yes, last time I visited her. But I told her, I can’t,” I answer.
Hermione smiles and carefully lays a hand on my arm, “And you are right in your opinion. I agree with you. Whoever this is should be honoured and not imprisoned. But what will you do if you come to know his identity only to find out that he died in the final battle.”
He is doing his walk around the hall with Shenan right now. I am watching him and following at a safe distance. Only to see him lean close to the horse’s head, like he is trying to whisper in her ear. Activating a discrete listening charm, I notice that he is actually doing exactly that. It’s difficult to catch and even with the spell I can’t understand proper sentences, but it’s true. He is talking! Actual words. More than some sounds or unintelligible mumblings.
“Thanks,” I say, letting my head rest on her shoulder.
“Why?” he brow furrows, “Something happen to Draco?”
By now I am panting after what feels like an eternity of jogging through the neighbourhood, calling out Draco’s name. He doesn’t respond and I did not expect him to. By now he might be talking but never at a loud volume and very rarely if we’re anywhere outside where there are no horses.
“I know,” I growl, my magic getting out of control like every time my feelings grow too strong. But Luna doesn’t even flinch when the glasses on the table explode into pieces, “I want nothing more than get him out of there. But the new wizarding world is little better than the old. They still live as much on prejudices as before, only the other direction this time.”
Hello everyone,
“I will be fine,” he glares at me, “Now stop bothering me, Saint Potter.”
“You will be,” I say, slowly pulling his cold body towards mine until his forehead rests on my shoulder, “You will probably never return to who you were before, but I’m sure you will recover. You are strong enough for it,” I stroke his hair as he shudders, repeating words I said to Hermione many months earlier.
The laugh he responds with is more of a choke, “And how well that went over with Voldemort. Mother wouldn’t have survived the punishment he wanted to dole out to each of us.”
“Piss off, you git!” Oh, how you annoy me, but on the other hand you always get under my skin so much faster than anyone else.
“Would you mind specifying that?” my brow furrows.
“He looked so tired in the memory,” she says softly.
Motioning me to sit down on the chair in front of the (slightly chaotic) desk, she goes to the other side. After a bit of rummaging she draws out a few sheets and snaps a pen from the side of her computer.
I stay there for a bit longer, just stroking his hair and face with a slightly goofy smile on my face. Eventually I leave his room to go back down. But I am too giddy to go to sleep right now, so I decide to use the free time and study until my eyes fall closed.
He stares at me distrustful, “Have to be there?”
Another nod then she motions towards Hermione, “Could you bring the steps standing next to the entrance, please?”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated. See you at the next chapter.
“Don’t ever leave me alone,” I mumble to her.
Another deep breath, I nearly forgot how he gets under my skin, “Stop going off topic. I’m not stupid and you know that, but that’s neither here nor there,” I lift my eyes to stare into his desperately defiant grey orbs, “I will not fight with you, Draco. The war is over, we’re not on opposite sides anymore.”
He shrugs defeatedly, “What evil am I supposed to be doing? I don’t have my wand.”
But apparently it was the wrong question as he only narrows his eyes and taps his chest again. As I only look at him confused, he stares at me. Then he stretches his hand again and does something that could vaguely be interpreted as pointing of fingers. His fingers again splay over the dragon’s form, then again points at his own chest, the movement from the animal to himself a bit faster than usual which visibly needs focus from him. I frown until a sad idea comes to my mind.
But he only whimpers in his sleep and shakes his head, pulling at my shirt.
But it only gets me another head shake, “Tilly wants to help, she really wants. Both the master and Master Potter. But she can’t. Master especially ordered that Tilly never tells anyone about him.”
“How is he?” Hermione asks from behind me, staring at the blonde.
“You want to hear a statement from Draco?” I am forcing my magic to calm down, “Well, tough luck. He is not even capable of speaking,” I growl, “And guess who’s responsible for that. Yes, your Ministry who stuck an already unstable person into Azkaban without proper trial.”
“I don’t!” I growl, frowning at her, but they only laugh and for a moment I feel myself set back to lighter times. I allow myself to enjoy that and laugh with them.
“Silver Light,” he tilts his head, “But your friend called her something else earlier, didn’t he?”
“When he’s cured, what do you want?” her eyes are unreadable.
I nod eagerly, “There is a passage in those papers where the spy speaks of taking care of the prisoners in Malfoy Manor. With Luna’s help I found the house elf who supplied them with food and blankets. And just an hour ago I got this memory from said house elf,” I say, holding the vial out to the man, “It clearly shows Draco giving the order that she has to make sure the prisoners stay well.”
“I didn’t kidnap you,” I snort, “Saved would be the more appropriate word.”
Your father gets the kiss, no one could have stopped that, not even me. You don’t seem all that sad about it either and watch with an impassive face as the judgement falls. Narzissa is a different case though. Her mental health had been getting worse ever since you disappeared back then. By now she is something between insane and not aware of the world. She gets sent to St. Mungos for lifetime. This time I see emotion flitter over your face, but I can’t tell what it is exactly.
I sigh again, still glaring angrily at my innocent coffee, “I guess, that’s the best we can hope for.”
“I guess so,” my heart clenches as I look at the list, “But some of this is older actually.”
“How does he do that?” it startles me when the owner steps next to me.
“I’m not sure, I didn’t know him yet at the time,” I shake my head in amusement, “From what I gathered his family had horses when he was young. He loved them, they apparently were his sanctuary from what we guessed.”
“Only because you don’t have friends doesn’t mean I’m the same, you bloody spoiled prat,” I scream back at you.
Disclaimer: Michael is an OC, but the rest is not.
“You mean like a gang?” she frowns.
‘Ah, he’s clear,’ I think, shaking my head to settle from the sudden shift position, “You had a nightmare last night,” I start.
A sad smile comes to my face, “Positive. At first he seemed very unsure but he managed to communicate whether he was allowed to keep it. And he reacted to it,
“I agree. My apologies,” Sergio repeats, “He has been punished. Nonetheless there are a few question we would like you to answer if it’s okay.”
Thank you for the comment.
But he follows her nonetheless when she leads Shenan out of the door, though he is more likely following the horse not her. He keeps a proper distance to the mare’s rear but he can’t manage to catch up with her yet because his walking is still slow. Inside the riding hall, Andrea hands Draco the long rope she has attached to one of the bridle’s rings. His hand reaches out to take it but looks ready to pull back the moment the woman so much as twitches the wrong way.
“I know,” she sighs, nervously twirling her spoon in her cup, “It’s just… You looked so happy when you told me that Draco spoke,” a snort, “You are even looking at him like you are somewhere lost on cloud nine right now.”
Hello everyone,
I saw you today. Nearly twelve years have passed since that night. You defeated Voldemort like was your fate. You married Ginny Weasley like everyone expected from you. You are a DADA teacher at Hogwarts now. I bet that was a shock for everyone, I bet they all expected you to become an auror. For once you didn’t do what they wanted, I am so proud of you. Joking. I haven’t seen you for years. Since the trials to be correct.
“Maybe,” she muses, “Maybe not. No one can say how well someone can heal from mental illnesses or trauma.”
“But yes he told me that you saved him. I hope you don’t expect a thank you from me now for that. It was before the time I can remember,” he continues and does a good impression of your sneer.
“Is he sleeping now?” I ask while pulling off my jacket and leaving my bag by the door, yawning widely.
“No,” I immediately correct him, “You are traumatised, not insane. But alone the fact that I am talking to you now is great progress. Never before have you remained clear for so long. I know that you can recover.”
“Hng,” I groan, eyes having trouble to open.
“I fell,” he glares over my shoulder, “The concrete broke open over there,” he nods at a hole in the pathway I didn’t even notice when I ran up to him, “The impact of my face to the floor stopped my panic at least enough so I could drag myself here.”
I really don’t know how it came from making out in front of the lake to hot steaming sex in my prefect room. Do you know that you were the first male I slept with? I tried it twice with a girl before that, but it never felt right. All the rumours about me sleeping around are lies, made up to keep my reputation up. But it was the best I ever had. I don’t know how it felt to you, but afterwards you laid down with me and held me in your arms. I was so happy that just for a moment we could be what I always wanted, friends and later on, more than friends.
“Trauma patients? That’s a difficult subject, Potter. It depends on the situation and the person. There is no single solution for that. But yes, the basic rules count for both situations. Nonetheless you would have to be more specific. But why are you asking?” his eyes narrow at me, “Is there something else behind it?”
“No, my father might have told Voldemort and my mother’s occlumency shields weren’t strong enough to hide it properly,” he still seems comparatively calm, “Too much of a risk.”
Hello everyone,
“I managed to get your case reopened after I brought proof of your spying. However they are not content with what I already presented them…”
I give my charge an encouraging smile when he catches up to me. However no matter how collected he looks on a first glance, he is breathing far too heavily for my liking. His eyes are still a bit too wide if you look closer and his hands are clenched, artfully hidden in clothes to keep people from seeing their state without making it obvious he’s hiding them. I shake my head, amazed and kind of saddened by how good he is at hiding his inner state behind a mask of haughtiness.
That causes my eyes to snap her again, “What do you mean nice?”
~ * ~
He glares at me, “Azkaban. They put me there…” he stops, “No, I was at the Manor and father…” once again he shakes his head, “That’s not right either. A palomino horse…” he chokes, arms wrapping around himself, “No, shit, why I can’t I remember?”
“Is it really that bad?” she frowns worriedly.
“What?” my eyes shoot to her, “You want to visit Malfoy in Azkaban?” I look at her in surprise. Why would she do that? He was one of the people who held her captive in Malfoy Manor after all.
“You should maybe look into getting him proper riding lessons instead of the therapy?” Andrea says, “Or maybe in addition might be better for now.”
Draco apparently considers fifteen minutes appropriate warming up time. When they have passed though he starts urging Shenan on. Since his movements have gotten a good deal more precise since that first time, she recognises the signals immediately and happily falls into a slow trot. Andrea snorts but with a sigh starts jogging next to the horse. A look back to the boy shows that he is doing something I haven’t seen him do very often. He is moving up and down in time with Shenan’s steps. Up until now he preferred to sit back or just did this for a few moments before he lost strength.
Disclaimer: They are not mine.
I sniffle a last time, before I lift the still way too light body. He is unconscious, so he is only dead weight now. Slowly I carry him back into his room and lay him onto his bed. I rub some tears off my face while I pull the duvet over him. He doesn’t so much as twitch. I sigh sadly. He was so well today and I destroyed it. I stroke his head and face. Still caressing him, I sink down next to the bed.
well, it's Sunday, not Saturday, but my parents decided that yesterday was the perfect time to restock our firewood.
Running through the woods. Where am I? After a moment I recognise the Forbidden Forest. I swallow. Nothing good comes from there, especially when it’s as dark as it is right now. And I am correct when I hear a cackle from behind me.
I watch him in fascination until someone puts a hand on my shoulder, causing me to nearly jump out of my skin.
“No, really,” my friend presses, “Just let us through please. The horses should calm him down again.”
Nonetheless I get the impression that his eyes look a tiny bit less fogged over when I put him in bed the same evening. Progress, I hope, as I stroke his hair a last time and leave the room to fall onto my own mattress and drop off before I even pull off my clothes.
I stroke his head a last time before I try to stand up to get away from him. Only to fail. Draco’s hand is clutched in my shirt and he is holding me too tightly. I smile softly and shake my head. Carefully I try to detach his hand. Only for it to barely work. His grip is tight, the hand clutching like a vice.
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
“Master Potter called for Tilly,” she squeaks.
Hope you liked it, comments and kudos are always appreciated and see you next time.
“The scars just show what you survived through,” I argue, “Yes, it doesn’t look the most pretty, but it shows how strong you are.”
“Now that’s certainly a pleasant image to walk into,” she grins.
“Nice to see you too, ‘Mione,” I chuckle, only to suppress another yawn, “I slept godawful last night.”
“That’s for sure,” she agrees, “But as awful as that is, we are losing sight of our main point. Draco has basically spent his whole life in pain. I can’t say if he has ever truly experienced something good and if yes then what. The only method to get someone who is in a state like Draco out into reality again, is not something I think we can use in his case. You have to make said person latch onto a good memory, a very happy part of their life. However I more than doubt that there is anything strong enough in Draco’s past to make him believe that it is worth for him to return to us.”
“Of course not, how am I supposed to prove something like that,” I frown at him, “I just know that the evening when he was supposed to kill Dumbledore he couldn’t do it, despite the death eaters around him forcing him forward. Even with the threat to his life hanging over him he didn’t want to kill anyone in cold blood. So yes, he has committed some smaller crimes but none of the major ones all listed in his charges.”
He sighs as he sits down at his desk, “The council won’t be happy with me if I do it without asking them first. However I agree with you that Malfoy should not spend a second longer in that hellhole.”
“It’s just since I can’t ask Dumbledore anymore who Spy A is, I wanted to find whoever is behind the second handwriting who continued the reports after the headmaster’s death.”
“But it can be reopened, right? He didn’t completely delete it, just put a barrier up after all,” I press on, there has to be a way to help Draco.
His head shoots up in surprise then he nods again, “Yes, for now that’s enough. Thank you for your time, Mr Potter.”
“Hey, Draco,” his eyes get slightly more focused but he doesn’t move, “I’m back,” he just blinks, “And I brought you something. Rather someone who wants to meet you, okay?” he blinks but does nothing more, “Is it alright if I take your dragon for a moment?”
“Exactly,” she nods, avoiding my eyes.
Still eyeing the mass of paper with wariness I nod, “Okay. But don’t expect me to be available for anything else anytime soon. This is going to take some days.”
She only hisses, “I can see it in your eyes. When you pour over those mysterious papers no one but Hermione and Ron are allowed to see. You are in love with her, aren’t you? Or is it a he, Harry? Is that why you never seemed to react much to me,” she sneers.
“Mr. Potter. What are you doing here? We didn’t know you were coming to visit someone today,” one of them says urgently.
“I won’t. I won’t. I promise I won’t let anyone hurt you ever again if I have the possibility of stopping it. I promise,” I repeat into his hair and keep on mumbling it as I slowly feel him start to relax in my arms.
“Oh yes you are,” she laughs, “Don’t take me for stupid. I remember our conversation about loving another man perfectly. And only a year later you drag a boy you were supposed to hate into your home and try everything you can to cure him of a possibly fatal mental condition. Gratefulness for saving you and perhaps all of us is not enough to warrant such actions.”
Sorry, just needed to rant. Comments and kudos are always appreciated.
“Fine,” I lift an eyebrow, “Show me the incantation then.”
I shake my head tiredly, “You have nothing to be sorry for,” I say softly, carding my fingers carefully through his hair, “I have nightmares too and honestly I would be more surprised if you didn’t have any. It’s fine, Draco.”
“Isn’t that a good thing?” my brow furrows.
“Please Draco. I need to know why you can’t or won’t move your left arm. There has to be a reason for it. If it really doesn’t hurt, then that can’t be it. You don’t have to be ashamed of anything, I promise,” I plead with him, but he just shakes his head again.
Somehow it hurts me when I think he could be your son. Why? I have three great children with Ginny to whom I am married happily. Well mostly. Sometimes I have the feeling something is missing. I can’t say what. I still mainly feel like a sister for Ginny, but that was what everyone was thinking would happen so I proposed to her and she was deeply in love with me either way, so it was perfect. Wasn’t it?
My hand raises and I stroke through his light hair. He hasn’t moved the tiniest bit since I laid him there. His face is hollowed out.
The rest of the night stays free of nightmares for me and Draco too as far as I can tell. In the morning I wake up with him still in my arms.
I breathe a sigh in relief seeing his interaction with Dragon. At least he can work past his fear now. Careful I approach him. Hearing my steps, he stares at me with wide, slightly nervous eyes. I hold my hands up to soothe him.
Half an hour later finds me on my way home with Dragon happily laying in a transport cage. Since he is a nonmagical cat I didn’t want to force him through apparition already, so I am walking home. It’s not far after all. A twenty minute walk later lands me at Grimmauld Place again. I unlock the door, walk in and set the cage down. I hear rustling from within, indicating that Dragon has moved to peer through the bars at his new home. Just as I am pulling off my cloak, I hear footsteps coming down the stairs. When I look up, my eyes catch with brown.
“But Harry,” she pulls a pained face, “He is – “
I shrug, “It was exhausting for him, I guess.”
He jumps to his feet the second he sees me. His usually unresponsive left arm is holding Dragon against his chest while the right searches for his missing wand. Grey eyes narrow at me as he stands defensively.
And indeed it works. After a few times of this, Draco’s head turns down to the little animal who meows when he feels the grey eyes settle on him. Another bump and the right hand lifts again. Dragon purrs and rubs his head against the pale skin. The blonde’s movements are slow and unsure as he runs it up and down the cat’s head, but the animal rewards him with a loud purr nonetheless. It’s like Dragon can understand how damaged Draco is and purposely encourages him. I smile and turn around to my friend who has come closer by now.
“They are all dead,” he deadpans back.
We say our goodbyes and I leave the room. When I step out onto the street outside of the stable, I have a careful smile on my face. I have a good feeling about this. With a bit of luck this will be as big a help for Draco as we hoped. Keeping that thought in the forefront of my mind I apparate back to Grimmauld Place where Hermione is watching over Draco.
“As few people around as possible. It’s actually best if no one interferes when he’s riding.”
Unfortunately that’s Draco’s only clear moment for the rest of the week. He spends most of the time in his childish haze. At least his panic attacks have eased a bit, even though only little. But every additional hour without one means more peace for Draco and some sleep for me.
But you. You are mentally healthy and you are part of the Malfoy family. The judge wants to sentence you to Azkaban. Bullshit in my opinion. You were only sixteen when you disappeared and all the big events happened afterwards. You have never done anything wrong. Granted I was shocked when you revealed that you had the dark mark on your left arm. But during questioning under Veritaserum you said you were forced to do so by your father. The judge didn’t believe you, what an idiot, you are not capable to lie while under Veritaserum. But in the end, they believed me luckily when I spoke up for you. For once I am glad for my influence as the saviour of the wizarding world. It still took some convincing but in the end you were let go free. Thank god.
“Probably no one would have been there at the Manor to keep Bellatrix from calling Voldemort,” he says hesitantly.
“Yes, I’m sure,” I smile tiredly at the wide, childlike eyes that land on me, “What happened?”
It’s so low that I nearly miss it, but thankfully I hear and whirl around immediately.
First, thank you for all the comments. The encouragement means a lot to me. :)
It takes me a moment of confusion until I realise that he probably thinks I am referring to Bellatrix. A shudder runs down my back. The last thing I need right now is her.
“You don’t have to answer the questions if it’s too much,” I immediately throw in but it only earns me a scathing look.
Bit shorter chapter this time, but I am uploading two today anyway.
I stare down at my coffee, “I don’t know. If he’s clear he should be able to, but it might trigger memories we don’t want him to relive.”
There she takes the long rope from her arm to her hand and starts unrolling it slowly, motioning towards the mare. The horse starts walking again in circles around her, that become larger with every new bit of rope. Eventually the woman stops. To my surprise Draco is wearing a look somewhere between disdainful and annoyed.
It means I have to search by hand. My first direction was the internet since I am not particularly familiar with navigating the magical market. I come up empty, of course. Sure, I find a few horses called Karina’s Dream, even a pretty famous one among them, but none of them fit Draco’s description. The only dapple grey I found is long dead, some show jumping Grand Prix winner from the 1950s.
“What are you doing here? Do you have an appointment with the minister?” she immediately rises, but I ignore her, striding past. I can use my saviour persona too if I want something. Be the hero everyone wants me to be.
“Yes, you’re a fine one, aren’t you?” he murmurs.
Hello everyone,
See you next time.
“I mean it’s not like he is dangerous,” I frown, “If it’s allowed I would like to bring him out of there.”
“Hm,” I hum, taking up another spoon, “I think it’s less my commands than he just needs some time to understand what he is supposed to do before he reacts.”
He stares at me with nearly frightened eyes but repeats cautiously, “Night?”
“Last minute studying or the friend who is staying with you?” he asks when he steps in front of me.
She just nods, purposely ignoring my slip about the male pronoun. Bless Luna and her acceptance.
I perk up immediately, “That’s great. I talked to my professor and he had some suggestions as well. He also gave me the contacts to a psychologist who could treat him. But I only want to use that as a last resort. As much as I trust my professor’s opinion on his friend I don’t really want to force Draco to talk with some stranger he has never seen before. At least not until he isn’t somehow better. So what are your ideas?”
I sigh, “Let’s just say, he’s better. He’s still far from good, but we’re getting there. Horse therapy is helping him a lot.”
“Are you fucking with me?” he hisses, “Or is this some kind of ploy to make me trust you?”
I smile, “I am always glad to come. I enjoy spending time with Teddy.”
A small commotion rises in the back then the familiar house elf pushes through to the front where I am standing. Her eyes are nervous as they focus on me again.
“Look, I know, and I understand you. I am serious,” she seems desperate, “But this,” she waves the list in front of my face, “is bad, like really bad. Draco is in a really awful state.”
The closer I got, the more relief loosens the pressure on my chest. The white comes from a long shock of white-blond hair hanging from the head of a person huddled against the wall. He is sunken down, curling in on himself. Thin legs in black pants and expensive looking shoes are pulled as close to his chest as they will go, bony arms covered by a black cloak are wrapped tightly around them. His head has fallen forward and his hair spilled from the tie, which means it’s falling around him like a light curtain. I am not seeing his face, but I am still pretty sure it’s him.
She smiles absent-mindedly, “Like I said, he doesn’t deserve a punishment this severe. Also I don’t think anyone else will even try to see him. It’s lonely,” she takes a short break then continues with her eyes far away, “And he wasn’t that bad. He was actually relatively nice during our stay there.”
“So do I. He did look pretty bad at that moment though,” I hang my head.
“Yes, yes,” I reply, pause for a moment and then ask, she was a member of the Order after all, “I just found something. Have you ever heard the name ‘Spy A’?”
“I have the warrant here that you are to immediately release a prisoner,” I hand the paper from Kingsley over, “The minister has signed it. I wish to take Draco Malfoy with me now.”
He snorts, but hurriedly changes the subject, “But you still haven’t told me what happened since my trial. Stop avoiding the question.”
The man looks up surprised then sighs, “Harry. I was just waiting for you to do that someday. What is it?”
“Draco, it’s just me,” I carefully stroke his back, “You are safe here, remember.”
His glare worsens, “Oh yes, poor saint Potter. Always such a bad life and everybody else has it so much better.”
“So how are things at school?” she asks, “You seem to be a bit unsettled by something.”
Breathing a sigh of relief at finally being finished with washing him, I open his hair and let a last rush of water run over his body. He splutters a tiny bit and blinks when the water hits his face. I have to basically lift him from the tub. Outside I settle him on the floor on a fluffy towel, leaning him against the tub, warmed by the water. His empty eyes stare right past me while I treat recent cuts and bruises with an ointment. I sigh when I step back from him. He is clean now, but that leaves a white skinned skeleton, covered in a mess of scars and bruises. Not a nice view. Suddenly his eyes though snap up to me. I nearly jump at the minimal second of clarity passing through them. Just that one moment and then they are back to empty but the thankfulness in them was clear. I smile.
“And you think I wasn’t?” I snort.
“Fine, do it. He’s sleeping by now and all that is going to happen is that a sheet of paper will appear, right?” I reluctantly agree.
I will try to put the next chapter up as soon as possible, perhaps today or tomorrow.
“Three,” his wife corrects him, “That boy jumped off at the last second.”
