Malfoy. Who couldn’t face his reflection. Who’d been forced to wait for Harry’s acknowledgment before his work came to anything. Who’d somehow pieced together folders and folders of evidence while bring ignored and harassed and despised. Whose eyes and taste and touch Harry couldn’t stop thinking about. Who now faced taking the fall for case upon case of wrongdoing at the hands of two pieces of work Harry should have called out from Day One.
found, as you’re so keen to insist.”
“It makes sense,” Malfoy said, voice quiet. “Anonymity is a powerful thing.” For a moment, he let his hands rest on Harry’s chest, a light pressure, dancing against him. They dragged down, then pressed harder, and Malfoy used the leverage to push Harry back a step. “But there’s a difference between Harry Potter catching a break and Draco Malfoy getting one.”
Draco swallowed. He had said Harry was the exception on that point, but they’d both known he was lying. The small laugh that Harry huffed felt private, shared.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Harry said, letting one of his hands slide slowly up through the curling, wet strands of Malfoy’s hair. It rested along the curve of his neck, grazing first over the collection of birthmarks he adored. Malfoy’s eyes fluttered closed, his head giving the slightest turn into the hand still resting against his cheek. His expression remained pained. Malfoy opened his mouth, trying to speak, until Harry’s fingertips slid over to silence him.
Potter cursed, then stood again.
Merlin, it sounded like a Regency romance. He settled on a mumbled “before last week” and drank the rest of his champagne.
“Rude.” Harry poked at Draco’s thigh. “Understand how you only became a ‘self-made man’ after your training was over. What about all that other time spent in the kitchens, that didn’t count? Very proletariat to me.”
Harry balked. “Weren’t you listening? I didn’t like the real him. I liked the him that was there. Away from everything.”
“You’re a real tosser, Potter,” Malfoy said, accepting the biscuit and taking a small bite. Harry nearly ate the other half in one. Grinned and held his arms out wide.
Harry finished sliding his arms through his jacket before zipping it up. “Yeah, figured I’d get a look around before dinner. You heading out?”
“None at all, unless being a bit of a swot is a crime now. He sat in the front for every session.”
“And I will work on communicating my feelings better and not sitting on problems.”
Later, waiting for Hermione to sit with him in the canteen, Harry averted his eyes as some of the junior Aurors walked by Malfoy, seated a few tables away, and knocked his tray to the ground. Harry counted to four before glancing back. For the next several seconds, Malfoy just sat there, his fringe too long and loose, hanging over his eyes. Harry reached up slowly for the strands of black hair brushing the tops of his glasses. He needed a haircut, too.
“Do you stay in touch with the Malfoys at all?”
“It means I engage in a dalliance or two. Once in a while. There’s a lot of fit people overseas. And no one knows me over there. The expectations aren’t the same.”
When she opened the door, Harry took in her shining, reddened eyes, the pyjamas and overly large jumper.
a ‘dirty martini,’ it was not fun to drink it. Also, he shouldn’t eat so many of those crab legs from the seafood platter, it would make him ill, and Merlin, what was wrong with him today?
In front of him, Malfoy didn’t look at anyone. He’d taken out a book—black header and white background, from what Harry could see—keeping only a slightly stooping posture all the while. This close, Harry picked up on something else. A cologne, maybe, or shampoo. It smelled expensive, somewhat minty. Harry followed it forward and stopped just before colliding entirely with Malfoy’s person. He tensed, but Malfoy didn’t turn around.
She paused, eyeing him. “What are you going on about? The two of you are together all the time. Didn’t you just go to Paris?”
The Deniden. Two glasses later, sprawled on his mattress, it came to him in Luna’s whisper-soft voice.
When he heard of their plan, Ron had immediately scoffed, but relented in helping once the food was ready. “Are you serious? Doesn’t this just validate everything I’ve told you about that place for all these years? And Harry, you are lucky you’re my best mate, because I cannot believe you knew about this and let it go.”
“The Ministry would just stop me, not the packages, if they knew. Someone else would deliver them instead.”
The first time one of Malfoy’s memos had landed on Harry’s desk, he thought it was a joke from Jenkins—that Harry’s
, nevermind done under."
It was better Malfoy left. Harry’d only made dinner reservations for one.
“You still don’t have to share.” Harry shifted in place. A part of him was curious, but England was a few hours away now. The List. Spain too. Maybe Draco
Draco shrugged. The daily sun protection charms were a bother. The terminology of the magical community here still confused him. But no one ever called him a Death Eater. Nothing echoed through the walls but the exploits of his neighbours and the white noise of city traffic. Maybe it was enough.
There were twenty-four folders to go.
“No, no drama.” Ron reached over to take one of Hermione’s hands. “Harry, you’re our best mate—”
Malfoy’s gaze on him lingered. After a beat, he nodded. They took a few steps over the dirt and climbed the hill.
“So you finally admit it then? Robards sent you here.”
There were a few other groups, a lot of people in their late twenties, like him. Mostly friends, he guessed, based on their appearance. Then again, his research had said work attire here tended toward the casual side of things. So who knew, maybe they were meeting for work.
Harry stared at his mug. The details hovered at the edge of his tongue, ready for sharing. She’d given him the go ahead. “No reason in particular. Just considering. I thought it might be interesting for Teddy to see more of the world before he’s at Hogwarts. It’s supposed to be good for children to travel while they’re young.”
“Ugh, I already told him that and he didn’t care.”
“I thought we could start small,” Harry whispered, meeting Draco’s eyes in the mirror. “But you say when we go farther.” Keeping their gazes locked, Harry trailed his hands hands lightly over Draco’s and waited. Draco pressed back into him. Harry could see his focus turning away from their reflections, then drawn back. He wondered how long it had been since Draco stood to stare at himself properly. Looked at his reflection and really saw what was staring back at him without the filter of memories and regret.
“Then what is your problem, I thought you were friends? And blink soon, please, I can’t describe what that does to your face, but it is stupid.”
Harry woke alert to several things. The curtains had been left open, and his world burned red until he slowly blinked his eyes open. Second, his hands found no one else when they searched the bed.
Harry nodded. A few feet away, the group had split into couples, Vickie and Dave off and chatting to the side down the hill a bit. Vickie’s hand lingered on Dave’s shoulder. Harry put his hand in his pocket before it did something dangerous, like wrap Malfoy up in it.
He traced one shaking finger over the waxen seal, dipped a nail into the grooves. His family's seal had been simpler, but only slightly. 'To mark with care,' Father had said, 'only that we deign to gift with our imprimatur.' The waxy surface reflected nothing. Draco withdrew his hand.
She pushed at him then. “Please, where would I fit that big lump in my little flat? Not that you’ve seen it—it’s modest, but works well enough for me. Besides, I couldn’t do that to Ron.”
So instead, he’d been sitting there alone for a good thirty minutes with his cloudy, terrible drink, eating too much seafood and counting the string lights over the bar instead of acknowledging that maybe, some small part of it could have been that at the time he’d ordered, he'd wanted to focus on something fun, anything at all really, rather than the tightening grip of anxiety that had been growing beneath his ribcage since he sat down. Like the sinking despair he’d filled with inching up to the peak of a roller coaster he rode once with Hermione for a Ministry-sponsored Muggle Education Outing. “It’s always worse before the drop,” she’d said.
Draco waited until she fully disappeared. “Why is everyone closer to my trainee than I am?”
“Well, um. Thank you for inviting me along for this. I should go meet the others. I’ll have to figure out how to reach them from here.” He turned swiftly toward the main street. Harry watched him until he turned a corner and left his sight. Harry reached for his own lips then, relieving the sudden ache there.
They reached for their drinks at the same time, sitting in silence for a while. The apartment felt small. The couch seemed too worn, like the cushions needed to be replaced. How he thought coming home would be easier, he wasn’t sure. So Gin had been a good sister. Who did that leave for Hermione?
“It doesn’t matter. It would go against the Quota, anyway."
“So you’ve said,” he settled on.
): permanently. He had the option now. At the end of his last mission, when the Spanish Minister had called him for a private meeting in her office, Harry had worried he’d missed something (or worse, his recent captives had escaped). Instead, Minister Salas had offered him a seat and asked him questions. About his family and his hobbies. How much time he spent abroad. What his aspirations were. And at the end of it, she made her offer: “Come work for me. Things are changing. We need younger, open-minded leadership. Someone collaborative and experienced. International Operations are only going to become more important. And to be frank with you, Auror Potter, you sound like you are more than half out the door of England already. Your leadership is stuffed with old men that will cling to their strongholds until they die. Don’t let them hold you back. You don’t have to answer now. I can’t actually offer it to you anyway until you get your credits (and I would not accept that kind of last minute nonsense if you worked here, by the way). But get the credits and let me know. We’ll go through the formal process, but it’ll be yours if you want it.”
“You took the Mark, Malfoy. No, wait, that’s not, I’m not saying that to punish you. I told you it can happen to people, too. The circles and the hands—they’re meant to pull out the dark in these places. And it worked, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
Malfoy’s gaze dropped to his mouth for a moment. It was brief, but Harry’s breath hitched when he saw it. “Right again. Guess some of it’s getting through to you.”
To his complete lack of surprise, Harry had no problem saving a seat for himself and Malfoy in the very front row. No one cared to sit there if Malfoy was gone, it seemed. His own preferred seat was already spoken for. Back in magical company, Harry had no qualms about hovering four cups of coffee along with him, assuming Malfoy could use the usual jab of caffeine that Harry needed most days. He set out the requisite number of sugars and cream—Malfoy’s foods were consistent. The morning speaker only got two slides in before Malfoy slid into the seat beside him, avoiding his eyes.
Draco pulled away from her fussing, hitting his back against the bar. “I can’t believe you, I have to work with her, and how am I supposed to do that now? And if Harry ever shows up, I reserve every right to toss his gift for you into the Thames.”
Draco dressed, put on his skates, and started his day. For once, winds had cleared the smog, and he took his time appearing and disappearing across Los Angeles under a close blue sky. The houses sat on quiet and busy streets, in crowded neighbourhoods and posh ones, and all of them were occupied. Well kept. Lived in. Like it should be.
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment before he reached down to remove Draco’s fingers. “None of that. Yet, at least.” He lifted the hand to his mouth and pressed a slow, wet series of kisses to each knuckle. “Your turn.”
Malfoy nodded as they headed out.
Two more days of work; then, he’d get to see Teddy. And start his campaign to get Andy inclined toward Spain. That had to be enough to get him through.
“Did you forget?” Hermione had a knowing look lighting her face.
The wooden stairs had faded centers, worn from years of trodding feet stripping the varnish. As they passed the breakaway to the third floor, a television blared loudly. It faded once they reached the stoop of Draco’s place. In the quiet, only the sound of their breaths and Harry’s rustling bags, it took Draco two tries to get the door.
“You can always wait for the next conference yourself, if it would be that much of a challenge. I could try to find someone else to monitor him and go in your stead, though that’ll be another bloody phone call. Maybe one of the junior Aurors, they’re easy enough to strong arm. You’d have to prepare yourself to take a few months of leave, though.”
Their efforts to make everything Harry did some heroically intentioned nonsense continued to baffle him. Almost as much as the fact that people bought those papers. And it didn’t matter that he’d limited himself the last few weeks to nothing but Floo travel to and from work. Any other ventures were restricted to The Burrow, Grimmauld Place, and one (
Pansy smiled. “Much obliged, Pots. Just for that, I’ll be sure to correct Charlotte: you’re not nearly as yuppie-looking these days as she said.” She kissed the air beside his cheek, took the bag, and disappeared around the bar, the sweetness of her perfume trailing in her wake.
“How’s that?” Harry picked up a sparkly pom and tossed it between his hands. Malfoy gave him a look, and Harry added another couple poms, doing an alright job of juggling them.
“After all the effort you put into this place to convince me to live here? It hadn’t crossed my mind, no. We’ve settled in here with our little routine. We go to The Burrow once in a while. Teddy’s got his friends at school. It’s not impossible. I just hadn’t considered it. Why?”
“Twenty-nine.” He rubbed his eyes. He always remembered the people that had stayed once he arrived, in those early years. "We were down to eight last year. It’s not impossible for five of those people to be dating someone a year later. Even if one of them is Michael Corner.” They cringed simultaneously. “Six! Shouldn’t I include you as well? Or are you still in the shagging phase?"
about them? Send them to Robards. Internal Affairs. Shacklebolt if you have to. You don’t need me to handle it. You’ve never needed me with all those Aurors tossing you around. You’ve always seemed more than capable of handling it yourself.”
“Oh.” Draco turned to him. “Do you think so?”
"Wanted to fill up her place, now that she can ‘afford one bigger than a broom closet’," Ron said, tittering in a mild impression of his baby sister. "She also very firmly stated that it was her bookshelf as she hauled it out, and I wasn’t going to argue for it.”
“Sure, that’s fine. Er, just me?”
“I’ve got a decent bottle of firewhiskey we could share.” Draco shifted some of the bottles around. “Or some elf wine if you want something lighter.”
The thought must have shown on his face, because Malfoy’s darkened eyes had widened noticeably.
Harry’s skin tingled at the increasingly familiar vibrations coming from the other man. That coiling of energy contained in a lean, quiet frame. He wanted to look. He tightened his grip around the book instead, tearing several pages.
“No,” Harry said. He was shaking his head and reached out for the edge of Robards’s table to steady himself. “No, it’s not Malfoy. I can prove it.” He bent over to dig into his bag. “I have pages and pages of proof.”
“You can always pick out the gunners at these things, can’t you? Five bucks says they have a question after ten minutes or less.” He nodded his head toward the front row. Malfoy was still in his seat, front and centre, though a dark haired woman with similarly sharp features had taken a seat beside him. Malfoy had a few to go cups around him again, like the night before at the lobby.
“Nervous?” Hermione asked, once they entered the lift doors. Harry leaned back against the lift wall.
“Potter,” he called. Nothing. Something hung from the ceiling—he could see it through the entryway and the window frame to its right. Several things. Their shape evaded him. The sun glowed strong from behind the structure, beginning to set in the Western sky.
They did not. They were in a shining wooden one from New Orleans. The crowd followed them in, forced them close, but Harry kept Malfoy’s attention on him at first, describing how jazz lingered in the air down there, how everything was amplified, the heat in the food, the strength of the drinks, how every laugh came from deep down in your chest. Harry tried to pay attention to San Francisco, once they were moving. The crowds continued to be young but posh looking. He counted two Starbucks. But his attention kept darting to Malfoy and his impressions of things. What made his eyes widen or his mouth quirk. It seemed like everything. They were far afield from London and Wiltshire: even more from the world that Malfoy had known. And he seemed open to what it had to offer him. His eyes were light, reflective.
Harry nodded. “No reason to stay once I get all this going.”
"Mate," Ron said, swinging the door open wide. The hallway filled with the smell of cooking onions. "You don't have to use the doorbell, we've told you that, this is your flat." Under his freckles, the skin was flushed to match his hair, and a large blue apron swung down to his jean-covered knees. Harry gave him a tired smile and stepped in for a quick half hug, careful with the box.
Harry relaxed and didn’t even mind when Ron knocked out a bishop. “Now that I can do. With any luck, it’ll be the only thing I have to say to anyone all day.”
Harry stamped out the cigarette and made his way back into the club. The atmosphere had clearly shifted. The lights were darker, but the strobes beamed brighter, beacons in a roiling sea of skin and sweat. The tobacco and liquor ran through him, pulsing with the music. Harry could be anywhere, in a place like this. Anyone. They were variations of the same thing, whatever the country.
“To… look after you?” Harry looked at him, then put on a pair of sunglasses. “Like a nanny?”
“He was so upset, and I asked, ‘how could you possibly be so surprised, of course this would be the next step.’ I suppose I expected some of the feelings had simmered, you know, with my work in Magical Beasts. And I tried to explain how much more I could get done, the good we accomplish, being involved at that level. He couldn’t believe I was even considering it. ‘What about the Malfoys,’ he said, ‘and all the other deals that office has made?’ So I told him that if he couldn’t wrap his head around it, maybe he needed some space to think. Usually he’d just go in your room—sorry about that—but this time he up and left. Ginny came by to pick up a few of his things yesterday, and I’m not—” Her voice began to crack. “I’m not sure what's going to happen.”
Harry slowly stopped cleaning his lenses and put the pair back on. That red circled conference date, the one bit of freedom getting him through, seemed to mock him now. What kind of break would it be if
To his left, the sand mixed with gravel into a lane. It connected to no road he could see, but it was something, so he started skating forward. Without buildings or mountains, the sky seemed farther than usual—even the celestial kept its distance from this place. He shared the sentiment.
So he didn’t. He made his way back to the group.
“Haven’t you heard of locking the damn door?
Draco turned to him, intrigued, but Harry’s face had disappeared behind a deep drink from his glass.
“So you like him,” she said finally.
I am on tumblr (jackvbriefs) and would love to chat any time!
Harry glanced between them, already regretting he’d asked, but she kept on: “The families are good. Bill and Fleur are having another baby. Charlie’s got a few new dragons at the reserve. The shop is?” She gestured to Ron, who gave a shrug as he moved a knight.
They watched him go. “Bye, Potter.”
were there?
Harry stepped in as well, truly wound up now. “You mean the information the
“And when you came back from San Francisco, did you go through any kind of check with the local Healer? For potions, Imperius and the like?”
Harry went back to the bed and fell into the middle of it. He stared at the bedside table clock. 2:32 a.m. He gazed up at the ceiling, his feet tapping in the confines of his shoes. He stilled. Took a breath. Pressed each shoe off with a steady push of his right foot to the left heel, then again the other way. Now his fingers tapped along his sternum.
Ginny laughed around her drink. “Oh, this is definitely going to be drama.”
“I think I’ll manage,” he said, already dipping a skewer with three bits of bread into the nearest cheese pot. “I can eat more than you’d think.”
He focused on the hallway closet instead. Unpacking his room would be a waste anyway: he’d probably be moving soon. Maybe. He couldn’t think about it here. His head was starting to hurt. It took him all of an hour to sort through the closet. The former bookshelf had held mostly folios from his International Operations training and language textbooks, as well as some of the knick-knacks he’d collected from his travels. An ornately carved owl in Italian Alabaster, wings spread wide in mid-flight. An exaggerated Victor Krum model from Japan. The owl stayed in his room. The books and other items went out to the shelf reserved for him on their new bookcase.
Minister Salas’s offer came to mind. Looking over Ginny’s head to the door, where Hermione and Ron were hopefully making peace. The reasons to stay kept disappearing.
Malfoy Disapparated the moment they landed in Ditcheat. It was raining heavily, and a stream of voices casting Impervius sounded around Harry. He just sighed. It felt appropriate. Cathartic. He waited for the lingering remains of the crowd to disperse, then removed his Glamour. He dug his glasses out of his pocket and put them back on.
A few hours later, a bit unsteady on their feet, Harry tucked Hermione into bed.
“Yes! Almost there.” Dave started to jog. Harry shook his head. A jog was asking too much.
“Me? Oh, yes, of course. I just thought I’d prep a little for the conference first.”
. Harry reached out to grab Malfoy’s wrist and connect his hand to the umbrella spoke Harry already held.
A little groggy, Harry stood up, then veered toward his suitcase. He’d change into his pyjama bottoms first. That done, the shower kept running. Harry turned to his clothes. Now was as good a time as any to get ahead on his packing. He waved the light on beside the bed, to the lowest setting, and folded up his things.
Draco followed the movements of Harry's sturdy hands. “If it's all worth having.”
Draco hmmed, his fingers drawing along the inches of Harry’s skin and parting the belt until he could slide the whole thing over Harry’s shoulders and toss it to the side. “Better now,” Draco admitted, lower lip pursing a little. His fingers pressed down and around the edges of Harry’s hip bones, sliding against the skin.
“Precisely,” Malfoy said, replacing his hand in Harry’s with several shiny, whole shells. “So you’re not that special at all really. No need to be dramatic about it.”
“I did something similar, actually. Pulled in some experts for the trickiest bits, but tried to handle as much of it myself as I could.”
“Potter?”
“I’m not sure she’d agree with you, but I’ll tell her you think so. And thank you.” Harry folded it back into the box and set it aside. “Now open yours.”
“It is. I did a bit of research before we came here, and the city’s only about 7 miles by 7 miles.”
It was his credits all over again. “I thought you were supposed to be helping me. And in case it hasn’t already become clear to you, Hermione, the department you’re about to join is involved in all of this as well.”
“I gave him about five days to do as he pleased. Luna and I’ve been spending most of our time up in Holyhead, anyway, so he watched the cats at the flat. We came by for dinner. Today I told him time was up and he had to come talk to her. Been in there about an hour now.”
Nothing would stop Draco from going inside. Getting a little closer. Reaching down into that dark—
She shook her head and refilled it again. “There is something else I hoped you could speak to Teddy about when you take him today.”
Ron shrugged, unrepentant. “Just being strategic.”
“It’s not. Above board, thank you very much. I’m a courier.”
He began to pick up on Malfoy’s tenor. Something like words, a steady tone interrupted by the occasional breath, hummed through the wall. Like a chant. Harry leaned in further until his cheek flattened fully with the door’s cold surface. He cast a silencing spell on the air conditioner. In the ensuing silence, the words struck him clearly.
“Do you have any clue how impossible it is to hear you in there over that noise? And I won’t have you yelling at me.” Malfoy’s eyes flitted over to the mirror, Harry’s reflection there, then away. Malfoy switched sides to lean against the furthest edge of the doorframe. “You were saying?”
Draco picked over his dinner, another day of deliveries behind him. Someone would value knowledge of Potter’s whereabouts pretty highly. Moreso if Draco hinted at what the man was up to. The Saviour dabbling with dark arts in the desert? It had a lingering appeal, to bring Potter down a little. Except no one would believe Draco Malfoy. And if they did, they wouldn’t pay him for it. So Draco washed up the dishes, his forearm covered and damp, and went to bed.
“If you really liked me, you’d have taken your time getting undressed,” Draco said, pouting now as a lone finger slid lower, past Harry’s stomach. “Let me get over my nerves first.”
“Potter,” he shouted. The skulls wrenched free of their posts and moved forward in a jagged line through the front door of the main house. A loud snapping rang behind Draco, and he crouched just in time to miss the Do Not Enter sign flying swiftly past his head. “That almost hit me, you arsehole!”
Harry had just nodded at her, his arms squeezing both of them tighter. She nodded back, and the three of them had stayed there until sunrise. The Burrow was quiet when they returned. They put Ron to bed. Hermione showered. Harry had breakfast. And then Harry went to his training, and the days repeated themselves.
Harry almost snorted his first mouthful of stew at Hermione’s flustered expression. French had been the first language Harry picked up to qualify for International Operations, and she’d initially tried to help him.
Draco wiped his forehead and proceeded at a slower pace, his hands clenched around the strap of his bag.
Harry smiled at that. “Maybe I will.” He rose and offered to take her mug.
“No colours this time,” Draco asked. The sight of a Deniden was not supposed to be comforting. He’d take the familiarity, nonetheless. After he spoke, the Deniden turned away. Its gaze fixed toward the main house and the farthest right corner of its deck.
If the tease landed, Harry’s face didn’t show it. “Just some advice,” he said, almost to himself. “From a friend.”
“So you live with Nott?”
At the edges of sleep, minutes later, Draco answered back: “Goodnight, Harry.”
She sat back at the question, the edges of her mouth tightening. “Not at all. I get invitations to their balls though, now that they’re back on the circuit. I can’t imagine what Narcissa is thinking.”
shouldn’t see me as anything but what I am.”
"First, you’re always welcome, obviously," Hermione said, leaning her head back over the couch to get a look at him. Her hair fanned with her in a wide wave of curls, and she had a smudge of red ink on her nose. “Second, it would never be a surprise if you told us when you were coming home.”
“Mm.” She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. “I didn’t tell him, so much as he found out.” She groaned. “We went to Ginny’s game on Friday and everyone was there, so of course we all went out to dinner after, had some drinks. We got to talking, and Susan Bones was there. She’d heard about the offer and congratulated me, right in front of everyone! Said she hoped I’d take the job.” She grimaced, pausing for another sip.
She shrunk into the seat, looking miserable. “I know.” She avoided his eyes and swirled the contents of the pitcher. “You were in a state, though. Avoiding us. I didn’t want to add to anything.”
Mint. It floated around him. Swallowing, he stepped around the cubicle wall and stopped for the stretch of lean, white-blond man leaning back in the chair before him. Jenkins’s old desk.
“You have pets?” Harry asked, as they wandered through a set of organic foods for Kneazles. Malfoy nodded, picking up several varieties.
“You helped me out, I returned the favor. I know the bloke at the certifications desk. Just asked him to process your credits faster once they came in. I know how much you like getting back out in the field.”
“Thanks,” he said under his breath, glancing at what he now realised was Malfoy’s shirtless shoulder, still damp from his shower. The highest of the three birthmarks was just visible.
Harry spoke into his ear, the warm breath curling down Draco’s neck as Harry slotted them chest to chest. “I’m quite thick, I’m told. When it comes to feelings. According to everyone who realized before I did.” He drew the edge of Draco’s ear between his teeth and pulled. “But I’m a quick study.”
“Prickly pear,” Potter continued. “Cholla. Ariocarpus. Organ pipe.”
Malfoy looked up at him. After a moment, he brought his hand up to block out some of the sun. “Not a fan of being a walking PSA?”
Harry considered asking for more, but chose to leave it be. Ron’s approval didn’t matter if Malfoy had no place in Harry’s life. And that was what would happen. He’d solve the case, and then he’d go. To Spain. Without him. Or saying goodbye. Harry put his file down, the lilting, sinking feeling distracting him until he picked up the next file.
Malfoy shook his head, arms crossing as he looked over the various kiosks and duty-free shops. “Not allowed to.”
“Ah yes.” She grunted with the effort of tying up a bag of practice jerseys. “And to show off how important ethically sourced furniture is to you.” She snorted. She’d seen the Prophet article, then.
He didn’t make it to the Ministry’s block before the photographers found him. There were two this time. He wanted to assume they’d been in the area to cover something important, like a visiting dignitary, but knowing his luck, they’d been waiting for him. Maybe someone at the Ministry was leaking his itineraries. He’d have to check in on that.
“Well, obviously, but why not? I went through a lot of trouble bringing that to you, by the way, especially given your apparent vagrancy, and to extremely discomforting places, I might sa—”
Harry watched him go, wondering why Ron was walking in the wrong—.
“Not all of it. Sharon, the owner, lives on the first two floors. The third is rented to a pair of uni students. I’ve got the top.” He waited for Harry to pass through the gate, then locked it behind them and led him through the dead garden plants to the entrance and up the stairs.
A fire crackled nearby. It almost sounded like rain, at first. Then Draco felt the warmth. He kept his eyes closed.
. It doesn’t change anything. Who I am doesn’t go away because you don’t want to see it. Trust me, I’ve tried.” He took another step away. “Willful blindness got me where I am. So yes, you, all of us, need to keep an eye out. All these sessions, they’re meant to highlight the power of observation, being seen. Wealth hid my family and so many others for years as they supported the Dark Lord, blood supremacy. What power does the Ministry have against ancestral homes larger than its office building, ages away from anyone or anything? There’s no accountability there. But things are changing. With Muggle technology and our magical abilities, we can see so much more. What’s a Knockturn Alley with recording charms? An estate in Wiltshire with overhead infrared scans?” Catching his breath, Malfoy shook his head.
“What are you doing,” Draco said. His hands had reached out, and he drew them back.
A Deniden. Luna’d been studying the creatures the last time she’d visited. Local to the area, she’d said, important for... something. He hadn’t been listening.
The next morning, Harry rose early to set the pot for Hermione and display her gifts from San Francisco. He went back and forth on being around when she woke up. She liked her morning routine. Thanks to his sleeping habits, he didn’t know how it changed when she was upset. He compromised on leaving her a note offering to meet up for lunch, if she felt up to it. If that wasn’t the right approach, well: she’d let him know. After their discussion, and a few more dives into the cocktail mix, she’d let him know a great many things she’d been thinking the last few years. He needed to keep his hair shorter. It started to curl when it went past his chin, and curls made him look too young when he needed to exude authority. The cologne he wore worked well, but he only needed one spritz, not three. His formal robes were flattering, but maybe a shoe with a heel would be helpful so he could be a little taller in the photos.
“No.” Harry held her gaze as he took a large bite of churro himself and spoke around it. “Can’t make it.”
“No, Potter.
Draco nodded. He had mentioned it the year before; a few rounds of salted caramel martinis gave him the recklessness to be more available in front of Harry. Or at least, to try again when his attempts in years prior had failed. But Harry had again seemed uninterested at the time—had not been paying much attention at all, in the midst of an arm wrestle with Blaise (Harry lost horribly)—so the resurrection of the information now, well: it was surprising.
“Well, yes, but this one in particular… I had some things I wanted to think about. Without, er, distraction.”
At the end of the dancefloor, near the base of the stairs, he caught a breath of mint. It stood out, delicate, against the heady musk of the dancers around him. Harry scanned the crowd for the nearly white-blond hair. Took a few steps before he lost the trail. When Harry turned around, though, he froze. A man in Malfoy’s clothes stood where the dancefloor met the stairs, arms crossed as the length of him leaned against the wall. His face, though, was rounder: the same fringe falling in his eyes, but wavy, and a dusty rose colour. Harry’s feet drew him forward. He meant to turn away, to step by. He saw too late that he’d reached out, his hand hovering, reaching, between them.
Harry walked over to keep up with her. “I dally.”
Harry sensed the dismissal and nodded, tossing the towel through the gap in the open door and into the sink. “No problem. I’ll, er, meet you there.”
“Well, speaking of sophisticated,” Draco said, summoning the gold wrapped package. “Your gift.”
Draco stilled at the finality in Potter's voice.
Once. Harry had seen those grey eyes this resigned, this wide and open and raw, just once before.
Draco shifted under the scrutiny. “Indeed.”
“Merlin, I wish.” Harry swallowed the glassful down. “There’s something I didn’t tell you about the conference. Or, er, my own job offer.”
Once he made it to Level Two and stepped into the Auror bullpen, the familiar hum washed over him. Paperwork flew overhead. Voices argued. Criminals shouted from the pages tacked up across cubicle walls and poster boards. HIs shoulders unwound some as he walked down the aisle to his desk in the middle row of the room.
“I don’t understand,” he said after a third scan. Robards frowned.
“Shiiiiiiiittteee,” he growled, throwing the covers off and scrounging in his suitcase for a change of clothes. He’d have to pay for that. Like he was paying now for the group of law students he’d joined after dinner, downing several delicious but expensive drinks in celebration of their recent job offers. He might’ve taken it easier, if he hadn’t needed a distraction. Eating alone, Spain and Malfoy on a loop in his mind, had been a terrible idea.
“And what is that exactly? Hopefully stealth isn’t a requirement.”
Hermione drew back from him then, just enough to look at him. Pity tinged her sorrow now.
Except she was late.
The exhilaration from the confrontation didn’t last to the Ministry Atrium. The familiar faces and calls for his time drained him as always (he’d left Ministry and charity events on The List), and he begged off with claims of an important meeting. When the lift reached Level Two, though, and the wooden doors to the Auror Department loomed in front of him, he wondered whether it may not have been better to hear what the crowd had to say. Might’ve bought him a little more time.
Except for Malfoy’s desk. Harry stilled. The blond had probably gone to lunch. He usually went around this time.
“Next!” A grim looking man with salt and pepper hair waved Malfoy forward. Malfoy handed over his Auror identification, and the official gave it a scan and entered into the system before Harry caught a brief flash of red. The official waved over one of the officers. Harry strained to catch what they were saying, but heard only enough to understand Malfoy was being asked to step into another room. At least Robards had not been exaggerating. Harry watched them walk Malfoy away, then stepped up to the same official.
information. You really think anonymous owls picked up on those tube stations? Figured out your first suspect was the right one? Half the time I’m reading horrible suspicions about myself and how I got the job. The other half are rumours about you.” Malfoy must have seen the expression spreading on Harry’s face, because he pressed on, buzzing with energy. “It was
Hermione, so I can’t take all the credit if you like it. Or hate it, I s’pose.”
"To my greatest defenders,” Harry said, raising a glass. They cheersed, then drank. “Except for the things that ‘don’t suit the room,’” he added with a sardonic look at Hermione. He sank into the plush brown cushion of the nearest bar stool. “I’ll have words with her when I take Teddy to her game in a couple weeks. Isn’t there a statute of limitations or something? Can’t come back for your stuff after like, three years? I'm going to add her to The List if she's not careful."
Draco inclined his head. “More than Charlotte, at least.”
He spoke first: “Thirty-seven minutes. That’s how late you are.”
That evening, Harry sat with Ron and Hermione after dinner, the files spread out among them. On his own, Harry had managed to get through and confirm the contents of a little over half the files. With his departure date drawing closer, he'd recruited Hermione to help him. She’d agreed to give him Friday night at least. She and Ron were going away for the weekend.
“Oh, Harry. I suppose this all seems very sudden to you, trivial even, but it’s…” She ran her hands over his shoulders, picking away bits of fabric on his jumper. “It’s been building for quite a while, I’m afraid. In little ways, though it’s always been there in the background. It can’t go on like this. Ron and I have to—” She paused to take a shuddering breath and wipe her eyes clear, but each was quickly replaced with another. She tried to clear her throat before starting again. “He and I have to decide what we’re going to do.”
“So you read the files I gave you?”
“Five seconds,” someone said.
“I have to hold their losses in my mind. I made a space for them, to remind me. I just took out—” Harry felt sick, he was dizzy with it, too much crowding him. “Whatever part could stand to look at me.”
“Conference went well?”
Harry crowded him, the want rising at his fluster. “That’s the wonderful thing about travel. People everywhere else don’t care. They don’t know. We’re a footnote in their textbook.” Harry nodded to Vickie and the rest of the group, barely in sight now. “My first mission overseas, I sat in the meet up place for fifteen minutes before I realised I had to actually introduce myself to people because they wouldn’t just know my face.”
With the conference over, he had less than a day left in the States. The idea cheered him. After that, it was only a few days more in London waiting for the credits to come through. Then he could head to Spain. Maybe he’d just have his things sent over, after it was all official. For a new start. A new home. He could leave even earlier then.
“Are you crazy? He’ll never forgive me.”
“Fine.” Limping, but trying to hide it, Potter walked over to the deck and sat in the chair. Draco felt the ropes disappear. Potter still didn’t trust him. He made no effort to hide the wand still held at the ready in his hand.
Beneath his fingers, Harry could feel Malfoy’s tongue twitching on the other side of his lips. The blond strands wrapped in Harry’s other hand spilled soft and liquid over his knuckles, his palm. This could be so good. Harry closed his eyes as well and dragged his fingertips down Malfoy’s mouth, his throat. Harry's hand settled over Malfoy’s fists between them. He needed a signal. Something to mark the transition.
“See?” Harry poked at the bag. “It’s wrapped.”
Downstairs, Harry disappeared into the crowd of people walking the pavement. The restaurant he’d booked would take about forty minutes by foot, the front desk said, and he had a few hours to spare before that. Spain lingered in his thoughts, Minister Salas echoed in some of the brunette women in power suits passing him by. Except he could taste the salt in the air here, see a city arching toward the sky with towering buildings in stone and glass. Compared to the cathedrals of Spain, the castles of England, the city was emerging, flowing with new ideas and a significant number of blonds per capita: he saw them everywhere. Twisting the scarf a little tighter around his throat, Harry walked on.
“Really?” Malfoy pierced him with his gaze, his posture lounging but his hands strung tight. “Then explain how it was me saving those cases for you and your expert team of Aurors.” He took a step closer.
“I’ll wait as long as you need,” he murmured against the skin, letting his tongue mark a path now back across Draco’s shoulders. Draco relaxed by the third rotation, pressing almost boneless back into Harry’s arms. At that, Harry returned his gaze back to the mirror, his lips along the edge of Draco’s ear.
Andromeda smiled. “I have. You’re not the only person who ever travels.”
Draco frowned down at him. "I was just about to get that. And what are you reading?" He reached over the back of the couch and nipped the magazine from Harry’s hands. Ginny Weasley winked out from the cover of Quidditch Weekly, freckles attractively marred with dirt, and Draco tossed the thing aside.
“Several. Unwillingly, for the most part.” He picked up a few of the toys.
Harry remained as he was, bent over the side of the bed, while he considered. The physical distance had to go, if his memories from the night before weren’t completely bollocksed. Harry lay back out on the bed, then turned onto his side to face the windows.
“Figure it’s good if I can’t hear it either way.”
As if summoned, a glass was pressed into his hand. Draco squeezed it. “And I’m supposed to assume this isn’t poisoned?”
Malfoy did roll his eyes then. “Nevermind.” He fell into pace a few steps behind Harry, content for now, it seemed, to let Harry take the lead. Malfoy said nothing when the front desk asked how many keys they wanted for their single room, or on the lift up to their floor. When he walked into the hotel room itself though, and through the short hallway to the sole king-sized bed, he let out a long sigh. “There’s one bed.”
Harry couldn’t give a toss—wine was on The List now—and grabbed his jacket before stepping into the bathroom for a quick check of his hair. “Takes you several Apparitions, does it? Usually manage it in one myself.” He flicked the light on and reset his Glamour.
“I found the mother trespassing in my shed. She looked pretty beaten down, so I fed her. And a few days later, she returned my generosity with seven kittens. Not sure why I keep feeding her,” he said, reading over some labels. “She never pays rent.”
“I’ll take that bet. I’ve wondered what the city looks like from up here. You can see those woods up there from our hotel room.”
“Not your Quota thing again, I thought we were past that.”
Draco turned his head to look at him. “Why didn’t you kill me?”
He watched Draco stand up and start to head up the stairs toward their room. Harry just spoke louder: “Going to pitch in on the finances, now? Interest is tricky to calculate, you know.”
“But you’ve gotten so far being an impolitic scamp.” Draco poured them each a few fingers of firewhiskey. “Why stop now?”
Draco let out a long sigh. His face looked extremely put upon. “Do I have to?”
Draco kept quiet.
Harry took it and summoned over one of his bags as well. Draco pulled it from the air. The weight settled into his palms as the spell lifted. Much heavier than his gift to Harry.
“You can wait for him out there. Might want to grab a beverage or something. It can take a while, depending on what we find.” Harry nodded, glancing back at the door they’d taken Malfoy through. He thanked the man when he got his ID back.
When her sniffles quieted some, Harry pressed his cheek to her hair. "Ready to go inside?”
Harry nodded. “S’fine. Gave us an excuse to freshen the condo up a bit.”
Draco watched Harry’s fingers dragging along the seam. “Understand what, French? They work miracles with food, not people.”
Draco reached up to cover Harry’s hand. He bent his head, hesitated, then kissed the seam where their hands met.
A small door opened from a wall panel near Malfoy’s desk, and several bags tipped out. Each one bore the marks of the Ministry’s mailroom. Malfoy picked up the closest one and started to unwind the twine holding it shut. Harry watched, noticing the length of his fingers, the elegant arcs of his hands. Malfoy set the twine aside and opened the bag. Letters upon letters were stacked inside.
The leave kept Harry away from the media circus that engulfed the Ministry that Friday. And over the weekend, he enjoyed sharing the adventure with Andromeda over breakfast. Took Teddy to Ginny’s next game. But he still slept poorly, that day and each day after.
Teddy bounded back down the stairs, dressed head to toe in his Harpies gear, broom swung over his shoulders.
“What do you mean?”
Pansy didn’t fully return to her seat, but she did rest her hip against the end of the bar stool. “Go on. Before what?”
“Should we join those two over there? I can catch up with you—I was going to get another round.”
. His office was as charming as he was. He took some of the biscuits from her plate when his cutting look had no clear effect. She raised her eyebrows at that, but said nothing.
After an age, Draco unwound, leaning back until Harry understood he could turn over. Harry expected another closed expression, but Draco stared at him, face wet, his gaze steady.
“I don’t know, Potter. Surely not every life is worth the bother.” With that, Malfoy drank deeply from his drink and slipped into the crowd.
The venue reminded him more of a converted home in Little Whinging than a government building or conference centre. The walls had been painted a butter yellow, and the white paint was flaking off the buttresses that lined the seams of the walls. The stairs to the upper floors were wooden and well-worn. He expected them to lead to a set of bedrooms rather than the main offices of the organisation putting the conference on, some local MACUSA affiliate. The other attendees didn’t seem as surprised. He assumed it must be a San Francisco thing.
Hermione curled her feet beneath her and listened while Harry summarised the offer from Minister Salas and Robards, his decision to go to the conference, and the events while he was there. By the end of it, she was frowning, her fist pressed into her cheek as she rested her head.
Harry had leaned against the wall to watch Malfoy’s progress, but straightened against it now, his arms uncrossing. “I asked at the front desk, but they said they were out of doubles.”
The humor faded from her eyes when she saw he was serious. “I mean, where would he sleep, if I took the bed?”
“What did you pick?” Harry asked, tossing his tote into the corner and pulling out the few jumpers he had not yet worn.
The List of Things With Which Harry Potter Cannot Be Bothered was an ever extending scrap of paper held in place by a magnet that said ‘Practice Mindfulness: Mind Your Business.’ Hermione’d come up with the concept and charmed the list to expand ad infinitum. The magnet was Ginny’s idea (“In case you forget.”). Maybe kitschy home stuffs ran in that family.
Wetting his lips, Harry stepped down the hall and paused in front of the door. Sliding a palm along the wood, he leaned against it to listen for any other movements. The shuffle of a curtain. Clinking personal care items.
A note from Robards’s assistant was tacked to his desk when he arrived.
“Will you gents be ordering any drinks?” The bartender leaned forward on the bar in front of them. Harry pulled back.
He’d been so certain that all he needed, the one thing outstanding, was the truth he’d ignored in the Department. That final case left unresolved.
Harry smiled, even if Draco couldn’t see. This Draco.
“No! You can’t take it back, this is my lovely gift.”
Harry nudged him with his foot. “Silence is, er, good, right? Talking is what you do for a living?”
“Did the Ministry send you to look after me?”
Malfoy sniffed. “Probably both.” He pulled them toward a magical pet shop from the map.
“Now we shuffle over here,” he began, sliding a cautious foot behind them and pulling Draco along. He stopped at the press of the tub’s farthest edge against his calves. Draco kept coming forward until their bodies aligned from chest to knees.
Robards’s eyebrows rose at that. “Certainly. Just report back before you leave next.”
He headed to the doorway, saying good night as he closed the door. He took issue with the characterisation—surely Ron was more stubborn—but he wasn’t challenging it now.
“I thought you’d like having the advantage.”
Pansy paused in the middle of removing her coat to stare at him. The moment passed, and she shrugged the coat off entirely. “Well, he’s very late.” When she picked up a shrimp from the display, it drooped in her hand. “So, this is what it’s down to, then? Wasn’t so long ago Bachelor’s Eve was so stuffed with single men we’d have half the bar to ourselves.” She ate the shrimp after one more dubious look. “What did we start with, twenty-five?”
“Naturally, Ron asked me what job, and Susan just told him.” Hermione trailed off, gesturing large with her hand before shaking her head. “We came back here and had a terrible row. I want to say that I wish I had cut her off or something, or distracted Ron. It would have made everything easier for a while longer. But at the same time—the two of us can’t keep dancing around it: what I want to do with my life puts me at the Ministry. It’s been years. And Ron is going to have to accept that. Or not.” She stared at the contents of the carafe.
“Goodnight, Draco.” Harry murmured it into Draco’s skin. There was something beneath the mint, a fresh warmth, like new laundry. He chased it briefly with his nose, closing his eyes.
“—conversations about the next step, a few times. Several times. So I was not completely accurate when I assumed the job was the problem.”
Malfoy laughed. It was a light sound, free of the meanspiritedness it used to carry. It was nice.
“Yes. I mean, some of they are, if you mean people were murdered in them, but not all of them. It’s not about that.”
“Yes, at
Harry eventually stood and stretched. More coffee was needed before he could progress to the next set of files. It’d taken almost four hours to get through the first. As he cracked his shoulders, he saw the Auror bullpen had filled up now.
“Is that code for, ‘I’m getting old’?”
Draco gave it a final tug before sitting back. “You’ve been seeing Aunt Andromeda too much.”
Malfoy nodded and murmured something too quiet for Harry to hear. The official stepped away with a wave, and Malfoy closed the few feet remaining between them. He avoided Harry’s eyes, his fair skin flushed. Harry watched the rhythmic brush of his right arm along his left.
Harry Apparated back into a dark hotel room. In front of him, the bed remained undivided, the sheets made up from room service. When he looked down the small hallway, he saw Malfoy’s shoes near the door. That answered that: he’d made it back at some point. Harry took a step toward the shoes and made out the closed bathroom door. He could just discern the shower running over the hum of the air conditioner. Again, the space beneath the door was dark. Like the day before. And the day before that.
The vibrations were getting stronger. Harry could see the shake in Draco’s hands. “As I’ve already explained,” Draco said, voice hushed but forceful. “I can’t do it
“Please form a line: form a line please. Families to the right. Individuals to the left.” A MACUSA officer amplified his voice as he walked around the group, his uniform navy blue and militaristic. “Welcome to the United States. Please form a line.”
“You want to go to mine?”
“It’s a good colour,” Harry said. His hand reached for some of the strands. It matched the flush on Malfoy’s face. Warmed him, like all those jumpers. “Nice, isn’t it?”
“Great.” Draco started down the road. A worn fence stood a few feet high on either side of him, wrapped with barbed wire. At the top of each vertical pike hung a skull. Cows, in some cases. An elf. At least two coyotes. Several he would not acknowledge as human. At the end of the fence, the Deniden sat, its feet curled into the empty sockets of a thestral skull. The tips of its wings glowed soft and golden in the dark and reflected off its milky white scales.
Somehow, Potter had heard. He looked up.
Harry peeked at him, but Malfoy’s gaze was focused forward. “Well, I read about this chocolate shop based here when I was doing research. The owner had some creative flavor combinations I wanted to try. And chocolate always makes a great gift for people, though he’s got some snobby ideas about how long it should be kept before you eat it.”
Harry rolled his eyes, leaning into the touch. He watched Draco’s Adam's apple bob as he swallowed. “That’s very presumptuous of you.”
Harry shook his head and pulled back the edges of the tissue paper. He shifted in his seat when the green cashmere came into view and thumbed the light fabric between his fingers. Draco sucked the inner side of his lower lip between his teeth to keep himself in place.
“I thought we could take the trolley. They’re sort of a staple of the Bay Area experience, I’ve been told.”
The rest of the group made plans to check out the second floor. Harry waved them off with a vague promise he’d join them, then navigated around the bar until he found a stool along the outer wall. The large glass panes separating the interior from the street had been pulled wide open: if he reached out, he could touch the people passing by. The cardres of young men in little to nothing. The almost Amazonian drag queens with large, brightly coloured hair and shoes as tall as Harry. He had to hand it to this place—for being so constantly grey and cold, it shone with colours. He resisted the urge to touch, but leaned toward the street and let the cool wind wipe the flush from his face.
When he returned to an empty room, he sprawled on the bed. Out in the hallway, a group debated best films near the door, waiting for a lift. Harry reached for the unsettled space below his ribs. Checked the right side of the bed. The pillow wasn’t dented. Malfoy hadn’t come back yet. He closed his eyes, slipping into sleep with the quiet epiphany that the conversation at the bar had been the most Malfoy had said to him… probably ever.
“My thumbs are too big for this tiny ass keyboard. How is this progress? I was better on my flip phone, and God knows I didn’t have to mortgage my house to buy that.”
“Yes! Exactly. Hogwarts. And wasn’t there some kind of government business, too? Anyway, that’s what I remember. I hate to say nowadays the school tragedies kind of blur together.” She picked up some food then waved her fork at Harry. “And we don’t really get that involved with those things at our level. But you were a part of that?”
“I’m stronger than you are.”
Harry looked at the leer on Jenkins’s face. “What do you mean?”
Harry sat up, almost upturning his glass. “A week ago? I was here a week ago.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together. “
“Mr. Potter, welcome back! Anything you’d like to share with our readers? Another success for the Wizarding World?”
“You’ll have to wait for another portkey, Death Eater,” someone said. Malfoy made no response: not even a flinch.
Harry kept his focus on the carpet all the way back to his desk. He couldn’t shake the impression he’d left something back in Robards’s office. The office air was muggy, almost thick. He slid the file into the top shelf of his filing cabinet, after unlocking it. It wasn’t very orderly, but kept anything he needed to reference in the long term: some of his notes on the unsavouries beside him, his last round of credits. He closed it and locked it back up, his heartbeat pressing in his ears.
“You made it.” Ginny jogged up to him in time to watch Teddy take off.
Draco took care as he twisted the stem of his glass. His dirty martini remained mostly untouched and cloudy from the brine. He’d eaten the olive garnish first—stuffed with blue cheese, the perfect amount of tang—only to take a drink and remember that actually, vodka was terrible.
Malfoy sniffed before turning his back to him with a pointed (albeit graceful) roll on the bed. Holding in his laugh, Harry dug a change of clothes from his suitcase and returned to the bathroom to get dressed and put his Glamour back in place. When he stepped back out, Malfoy sat upright again against the headboard.
of all people, couldn’t get much worse), even if Ginny had been bothered, Harry wouldn’t have noticed.
Ron wiped the steam off his face, but kept the wry twist to his mouth. "Ginny said she comes home more, so she deserves the welcome home. Something about the principle of the thing, blah, blah. Didn’t think you’d mind, truth be told.” Ron paused to check Harry’s face. His cavalier tone ebbed a little. “And I got that new one just for you. Seemed poetic, for a man of the law."
When Ron and Hermione left the next morning, Harry put up a pretty good front, in his opinion. Of course he’d finish, he told them. Really, they’d just slow him down, so they should forget all about it, have some fun together, and they could celebrate his triumph over the paperwork come Sunday night.
Draco, England or no. He heard and felt Draco’s tentative steps into the bath.
To Harry Potter.
Malfoy smiled, warm even in the overcast light. “Exactly. You become an unknown. Wear a disguise.” He inclined his head, glancing at Harry’s Glamour-lightened hair. “Work in the dark. Operate out of something that seems like something else.”
“We did," Harry said. "Should be out in the papers by now, if not in the next few days. We found them when someone tried to sneak out of their base and meet up with a local girl he’d been seeing.”
“Well, you still have to sign for it. None of my business what you do with it after.” Draco floated over the release form and a quill. Potter considered him.
research. You think anyone notices I’m away from that desk?”
“It’s been a bit lonely, really, being your friend.”
“It was a busy time,” Harry said. “It wasn’t my business what you were doing.”
Harry shrugged, assuming his appearance reflected the last few days. He hadn’t slept much or made any decision about the conference, but he had shaved, gotten a haircut, researched some interesting places in San Francisco to explore, and made significant progress through the paperwork pile on his desk. “If I hadn’t already promised Teddy an afternoon of flying before Ginny’s game, I’d take you up on that offer. Compromise on coffee?”
“You’re only saying that to annoy me, and let me tell you, it’s working. ‘Like a shawl,’ honestly.” He reached over to wrap it properly once, twice, around Harry’s neck. His hands hung on the edges. Harry’s eyes glowed, now, against the colour. Disaster.
Ah. Well then. Harry gestured down the walkway. “Shall we?”
Harry nodded. “It’ll be an adventure. And these trolleys are from all over the world.”
Draco opened the exit door, then froze. The compound shone under the dark night’s sky with a bloody crimson light. Wind kicked up in circles around each of the buildings, rising from glowing lines on the ground—Potter’s casting circle. He ducked. Planks of wood spiraled overhead as they snapped free of the fences and deck. Shrubbery, too, and rocks from the road were drawn into the sky.
The dining area of the Matterhorn Restaurant, done up in pale wood and tiles with bright, hanging lights and country flags, reminded him of an Alpine lodge he’d stayed in during a disastrous attempt to learn snowboarding. A broad woman with a kind face showed him to the bar area, per his request, and seated him. She stepped away once he’d asked for whatever beer and fondues she liked best, he wasn’t picky.
Pansy tapped a sparkling white fingernail on the wrapped gift. As she did, he could just make out the little skull and crossbones painted on it in a pale gray. “So, what did you get him?”
“And your clients are that exciting, then?”
He closed his eyes against the torturous images her question conjured. Only that made it easier to envision the dimples in Harry’s lower back, the things Harry would whimper (and in what breathless tones). Draco forced his eyes open wide. “No. And bad guess.”
“It’s a few steps to the bathtub, okay? I’m going to guide us there. So, er, you can close your eyes, or you can just kind of shuffle step along with me, alright?” Harry didn't want to force him to face the mirror along the wall any sooner than necessary. Draco nodded. Harry could feel Draco’s shoulders pitch a little higher.
Draco’s thumb ran back and forth over his name. When the question reached him through his haze, he nodded. “They got my name wrong.”
The image—Harry Potter, his hands in his pockets, hair still slightly damp from the cold and clinging in dark curls to his skin—there’d be no forgetting now. Draco looked down at the baked goods and tumblers. The recipe for romance, to be sure. Fuck.
“Wait, Pans.” Draco stood as well, cornering her between the bar and their chairs. None of the several scenarios he’d hypothesized for the evening accounted for her absence. The pit in his chest nearly gutted him as it returned in full force. “You’re not leaving. You can’t.”
Malfoy’s hands paused, half into the bag, then carried on. “No need,” he said, his voice the same low timbre as before. "Only doing my job.”
She scowled. “Yes, I can see how Draco Malfoy riding the Chosen Dong would blow the Earth’s natural alignment or whatever, launching us all into the moon.” She stood at his sigh, ignoring the few eyes her heated statement garnered. “Well, if that is all, I am actually leaving you. I’m meeting Charlotte shortly, and I’m already late because I’ve indulged you enough as it is.”
“Yeah, I’m sure Robards won’t mind. He’s got some bigger stuff on his mind about now, I imagine.”
"She'd probably take it as a compliment, getting a spot on there," Ron said, ladling out portions. He set the dishes aside, tossed off his apron, and took a seat next to Hermione. "Alright, bone-ape-tit, or whatever.”
“The what?”
“Oh, sure. Another Manhattan please. And, er, whatever that gentleman last ordered.” The bartender nodded, returning a few minutes later with the drinks. Harry charged it to the room, then walked across the floor space. London had begun to build its own share of tall structures, but nothing like the ones in front of him. His gaze swept across the colours, the glimpse of the water further on. Stories below, he could make out the small shapes of people beginning to hustle onto the streets. They seemed so far away.
Harry felt the cold through his jacket, sinking deep to his skin. “If that’s the case,” Harry said, tone harsh to his ears. “Then let me be clear about ‘Harry Potter.’ You do not tell me what I can and can’t do. It’s my business what I think of someone—whether I think of someone. And it’s pretty rich, frankly, for someone who sits behind a paperwork fortress, avoiding eye contact all day, to talk to me about keeping an eye on things.”
