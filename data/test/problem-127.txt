"Hm?" Morag started at the irritation she heard in Draco's voice and looked up, blinking at him in surprise. "Oh, it's nothing against you or Aria personally, Malfoy. It's just that..I already
Frowning, she shared a troubled look with Draco before they pushed past several teary-eyed 1st years and walked over to where the 8th years were sitting by the couches.
While most of the students gasped and chattered loudly amongst themselves, Fleur took advantage of their distraction to finish securing her hair back up onto the top of her head. Afterwards, she turned to smile at the class again, chuckling when she saw that most of the males had finally snapped out of their entranced staring and were shooting each other embarrassed grins.
"Yeah, kid." Lewis, another Healer (a robust-looking wizard in his thirties), commented as he looked up from his clipboard and gave Draco a good-natured grin. "What's with the long face? After today, you'll finally have more time to spend with that girlfriend of yours. Haven't you been neglecting her by being so busy all the time?" He kidded.
His mother gave him a pointed look. "The reason your wand wasn't working for you before is because its loyalty was still with Aria; and even though she returned it after the war, it wouldn't have just changed loyalties without you disarming her or winning a duel against her. Seeing as you did neither, I'm pretty sure that wand still answers to her."
"Neville! Are you okay?!" Aria called out as she ran over to the fallen Slytherin and knelt down on the ground beside him. "Can you walk the rest of the way?" She asked him, wincing when Neville's reply came in the form of a tortured groan.
Eventually, a few of the other members of the wedding entourage were called to join them. Draco could only sit back and scowl (desperately trying to control his jealousy) as George and Aria began waltzing together, not too far from where Draco was seated.
, sliding lazily up her leg, twisting behind her to squeeze her ass, before climbing back up, past the curve of her waist to fondle her breasts. Every little patch of skin where Draco touched and groped her tingled deliciously, sending tiny sparks of electricity coursing through her entire body.
As soon as the words reached Aria's ears, all of the blood rushed out of her face. Her eyes widened and she stared helplessly up at Draco's worried features as her entire form was suddenly encased in a bright, yellowish glow.
"I suppose, what I'm trying to say is…The reason I came to see you here tonight is because I wanted to let you know that I can't continue this – whatever
"Oh yeah, speaking of girlfriends, that reminds me." Blaise narrowed his eyes and pretended to give Neville a chastising look. "I do believe I saw Pansy trying to sneak out of the boys' dormitory this morning. Obviously, all that alcohol you both drank last night must have made you two a bit more promiscuous than usual." He whistled innocently.
Sighing, Aria reluctantly took the seat beside Blaise, careful not to accidentally knock over the piles of books scattered around them. Blaise grinned at that and rewarded her with a wink before turning back to his essay, which, Aria couldn't help but notice enviously, looked about halfway finished.
"Always with the subtlety." Blaise snorted as he took the hint and began moving towards the door. "Are you going to kick the rest of us out of the room?"
Following Blaise's gaze across the field, Aria couldn't help chuckling in agreement when she saw exactly
she's not—" At her words, the confusion on Draco's face cleared and he shook his head, giving her a slightly amused smile. "—it's definitely not her. Astoria is just…well, she's an old family friend of mine."
"Potter, you're in my seat." Draco said flatly, taking great care to keep his face an indifferent mask.
Eventually, they reached the hospital wing and Aria hissed in pain as Ron deposited her carefully into one of the beds near the back of the room. Fortunately, the room was empty of other students as most of them were probably still gathered outside in the quidditch pitch. With a sigh, Hermione pulled the thick curtains around Aria's bed, shielding her from view.
"Okay." Aria struggled not to let the frustration on her face show as she walked over to where Corey stood and positioned his arms into the proper wand stance. "It's very simple – the spell is 'Stupefy'. You just have to make sure you aim your wand properly when you execute the movement."
"Corner was making inappropriate remarks about you in front of all those other boys and you're mad at
She waved it up into the air; but as soon as Draco recognized the official seal of the Wizengamot printed on the back of it, his eyes widened and he felt all of the blood rush out of his face.
Greg's left eye twitched at Draco's flippant response; and he looked as though he wanted to say something else but that was when Aria drew his attention back to her.
"Wow…I uh—" Aria couldn't help the amused grin on her face as she sat down and stared at the other occupants of the table – Neville, Hannah, Morag, and Zacharias. All four of them were sitting stiffly in their seats and looked as awkward and uncomfortable with the whole situation as she was.
When the class fell silent and most of the students glanced at each other in confusion, McGonagall directed her attention to the classroom doors again and nodded.
When Draco gaped at her, completely stunned as to how she arrived at that deduction without him actually saying anything, Narcissa's eyes narrowed and she gave him an accusing glare.
"Oh come on, stop lying. Don't tell me you don't agree with what he said." Draco scoffed at her reaction and looked away. "I
By the end of the day, after Draco finished saying goodbye to all of his patients and he hung up his St. Mungo's uniform for the last time, he was a little embarrassed to admit to himself that he got a little teary-eyed too, especially when Estelle, Lewis, and the rest of his supervisors surprised him with a cake and a small goodbye celebration after his shift. It was late afternoon by the time the celebration ended, and after everyone wished him luck and Draco finished thanking all of them for their time and patience, he finally signed the official release papers Estelle handed him and slowly made his way to the elevator that would take him down to the main lobby of St. Mungo's.
It was a few more minutes after that when Blaise finally broke the silence by slamming his book shut.
She gave Draco a slightly sheepish look. "That's actually partly my fault. I...sort of...owed Blaise a favor, and in exchange, he asked me to show him where the Chamber of Secrets was and to let him organize a drinking session down there. Unfortunately, he decided to turn his little 'drinking session' into a massive party instead."
Aria didn't answer; and she continued to glare at Pansy with narrowed eyes. Before either of the two girls could say anything else, Neville spoke up again and he drew Aria's attention back to him.
made offers to muggle governments to regularly provide Sanguine potions to their vampire community but, being the bigoted muggles they are, I don't think they've quite acknowledged the fact that there are vampires living amongst them just yet." Wood snorted and offered her a halfhearted shrug.
Sighing, he was just about to head towards the Hufflepuff Common Room when another familiar face among the crowd of boys waiting nearby caught his attention. Draco glanced to his right, arching an eyebrow when he recognized Theodore Nott leaning casually against the dungeon wall a few feet away from where Draco stood.
A few minutes later, when they finally managed to pull away from each other, Draco shook his head to himself and let out a breathless laugh. As Aria slid her hands up his chest and linked them around his neck, Draco closed his eyes and bent down, pressing his forehead against hers.
She was sitting quietly between Longbottom and Abbott and was currently scribbling something into her parchment, pausing every now and then to look up and listen to whatever their DADA professor was saying. When she felt his gaze lingering on her, she frowned and suddenly looked up, glancing at his direction. Draco flushed and hastily tore his gaze away, hiding his face behind his thick textbook.
Ignoring the confused look Blaise gave him, he snatched the other boy's wand and held it up in the air, wordlessly summoning something from the bottom of his trunk all the way back in the dungeons. He knew it would take a while before the summoned item would reach them, so Draco reluctantly turned his attention back to Aria.
"I don't know if I can help you out there, kid. I'm not even sure if I'll be on the team, that'll depend on this year's Captain." He drawled.
"...I was hoping to work as a Junior Prosecutor for the Ministry. I actually already received a provisional job offer, but whether I actually get accepted is contingent on me passing the Bar Examinations first." He told them.
She sighed and sat down onto one of the empty chairs near the front of the classroom. "Either way, both options sounded good enough for me. I really just wanted it all to be over. I didn't actually care about anyone else."
"A little possessive, are we?" She snorted at his hostile reaction. "Ten seconds, Malfoy. That's my last offer."
Seconds later, a small, blue winged creature zoomed out from under the cabinet and began flying around the top of Pansy's head.
—" Before the other boy could protest, Draco shoved him towards his broom. "—get on your broom. You and I are going to have a talk in the locker room."
"Of course it is, Ronald." Hermione waved his words aside and bent down over Aria's form again, inspecting her fully extended veela wings with a frown on her face. "Wow, that stray bludger really did a number on your wing, Aria. It looks really bad." She stared worriedly at Aria's left wing, noting the way the upper part of the wing, near the pointed edge at the top, was bent at an awkward, painful angle.
"Knowing my luck, I'll probably be paired with Parkinson. Or Bulstrode." Aria muttered under her breath to Hermione from where the two of them stood near the back of the room.
"Let's get you to the hospital wing." Ron was back at Aria's side, peeling off his gloves and helmet before he resumed his efforts at trying to extract her from Draco's arms. When Draco seemed to hesitate again, Ron gave him another exasperated look.
"I see." Draco blinked at that, genuinely surprised at her words. "New flat in Westminster...So you're selling the house that Black left you?"
mate. In fact, if anything, it looked as though he was even trying to hide your wing from everyone else."
Fortunately, they spent the remainder of the evening in relative silence after Pansy's little outburst, broken only by the occasional loud 'thuds' from the impressive stack of thick books that Morag was currently lifting from her trunk and arranging on the desk beside her bed.
They tried a few more times, chasing haphazardly after the pixie as it flew in circles around the empty classroom. Finally, Pansy declared that she had enough and growled as she raised her wand, pointing it at where the pixie was circling around the back of Aria's head.
Much like you are, Malfoy." Morag gave him a look as though she was trying to explain a simple concept to a five-year-old child. "In this day and age, why have only one sexual partner when you can get physical stimulation from many others at the same time? Not only is it more efficient, it's also far more pleasurable in my experience."
Seriously, the guy couldn't take a hint. Draco wasn't interesting. Go an bother someone who gave a damn.
Draco shook his head, edging closer towards the boy. “Let me let you in on a little secret.” He whispered dramatically. “Lavender isn’t as hung up on Weasley as everyone thinks she is.” He stated simply.
Abruptly, Draco stood up and started to walk back towards the castle. He was a coward. Draco was dangerous. He was a Death Eater. Draco had to save him from himself.
He collapsed onto the floor, howling in sheer agony. He’d never felt anything like it. it was worse than a crucio. It was worse than the fear he felt for the Dark Lord. No, this was pure torture.
“Well, I don’t think that I need to listen to this attack for any longer.” He huffed, rising to his feet in a swirl of robes and blonde hair. He’s said it before, and he’ll say it again, Severus Snape would be jealous. And as he should.
She rolled her eyes, “I wasn’t asking what you were doing before you got here. I asked what the hell are you doing here?” she growled.
Ever since he were a little boy, he’d been lonely. He hadn’t had many friends, and the ones he did have his father never let him play with. It had hurt him more than he’d ever care to admit.
“But one day you will be happy again. And I will do everything I possibly can to make sure that I’m the one to make you happy.” she promised him.
Bill had shook hands with him, Fleur his girlfriend had excitedly commented that she was sure that he had veela blood.
Draco opened his mouth to object, but quickly closed it. Where was the lie? He’d been obsessed with Harry Potter since he was eleven. Hell, he’d been obsessed with Potter long before that.
Weasley gave him a warm smile. “You’re a better man than me.” he said in admiration and Draco decided that couldn't be further from the truth.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her. “Well she’s not yours, so you can’t decide what happens to her.” he objected.
“I want to be different. I want to be better. I want to become someone that I can love and be proud of. But I can’t” he sighed defeatedly. “I can’t and it’s all your fault. You taught me how to be this. You pressured me into getting me the mark. You filled my head with all these toxic ideas ever since I was a child. I never stood a fucking chance.”
Potter took an intake of breath, “it hurts so much.” He said with a shaky breath. “And I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I feel like this. Why you make me feel like this. Hell, I don’t even know what I feel like, never mind what
Pansy pulled away after several moments and sat back down, she took a deep breath. “Then seventh year began and you were shadow of the person you had been around Potter. I tried mentioning him once..” she started and Draco’s breath hitched.
Potter groaned at his action, tightening his arms around Draco’s waist as if he never wanted to let go. Draco couldn’t help but realise that the only time he’d felt safe, truly safe, was when he was in Potter’s arms. He didn’t know what to think about that. He didn’t know what it was about Potter, but Draco was addicted to him.
He nodded, before turning on his heel running through the mass of people. He felt all eyes on him, but he didn’t care. He needed to find Potter.
“I know I’ve been horrible to you. There’s no excuse for it. I’ve been a real git.” He attempted. “You don’t deserve it. You don’t deserve any of it.” he admitted. Couldn't he see. Didn't Potter understand? He did deserve it. He couldn't begin to explain how much he deserved it.
He sighed, Potter had gone to get a few of his things from Gryffindor tower, and Draco was surrounded with confusion.
“But I don’t feel sad anymore.” She continued. “Ever since you helped me, I haven’t felt alone anymore.” She beamed. “You make me not sad anymore. You make me happy.” She gave him a massive heart-warming grin.
Draco repressed a smile, “I suppose you muggles call it drawing,” he quipped, placing his pencil down gently next to him.
And Draco loved him. He loved him with his own being, he knew that he’d never stop loving Harry. In fact, he fell a little bit more in love with him as each day passed.
He had a choice. One that could determine the outcome of the war. One that could return the Malfoy name to glory. One choice. One life-altering choice.
Draco stared at him for several seconds. His black curls were messier than usual. His eyes were greener and brighter then he’d ever seen them. His oversized pyjamas hung effortlessly to his golden skin which glowed in the moonlight. How the hell did Potter manage to still look so good this late into the evening?
Draco wasn’t even surprised. Currently, Draco and Theo were making their way towards Honeydukes, a band of Hufflepuff's trailing behind them led by Kat.
Mrs Weasley glared at her two boys. “Fred and George Weasley. I’d keep your mouths shut, or so help it I’ll cut of both off your tongues!” she threatened and Draco decided that he liked this woman.
Theo shook his head reaching over and placing his hand atop of Draco’s. From the corner of his eye, he could see Potter sit up a little straighter as he stared at them intently.
She averted her eyes to look at the floor, “I’m lost.” she stated and he couldn't help but notice how adorable she sounded.
Suddenly, he felt two arms wrap around his waist. It took a moment for him to realise that he was being hugged, it had been so long. Again, he felt a warmness invade his stomach and he gave her a small hug back.
Ah Theo! The very person that he had been trying avoid ever since he'd step foot into the castle. It wasn't so much that he didn't want to talk to him...
Draco smirk, “I live to serve.” He flared dramatically, as the sleeve of his robe was tugged quite forcefully.
Draco stood uncomfortably outside a quaint three storey home situated in muggle London. The war had ended three weeks ago, and Draco had been acquitted of all charges held against him. His trial had been a well-documented event, with many commoners attending, all hoping to see the Malfoy heir shut away in Azkaban for life.
He coughed. “I’m fine.” He repeated again and the Headmaster’s eyes flashed with disappointment before returning back to their naturally warm state.
He nodded, walking towards his mother, and launching himself into her strong arms. He’d missed this. It took him back to a time where his mother’s arms were the safest place in the world. They still were in a sense.
All of a sudden, he felt a healing charm wash over him, and he jumped to his feet. He crawled towards Hermione, desperately pulling her close as he tended to her wounds.
“But of course, Pansy. There’s nothing better than a little bit of anarchy to feed the soul.” He bit out.
Draco felt his eyes start relaxing, a bout of tiredness washing over him as absently heard Potter whisper “You’re so beautiful Draco.” before everything went black.
Draco shot her a confused look, “most people tell me that I look like my father,” he replied dejectedly.
“Yes, yes I’m extremely generous. Now please do get on with it. I’m a very busy man.” He said quickly, feeling as if he'd drop dead if he didn't sleep soon.
“Please Draco?” She asked again. “I’ll be good, I’ll be very, very good. I promise I won’t laugh or anything, even if they’re bad. Not that you could ever draw anything bad. Please Draco. Please, please, please, plea—”
“Fuck, Draco. I need… I need.” He said, sounding completely wrecked. He adds another finger, groaning onto Draco’s cock. Urghhh. It’s perfect. So… so perfect. Sparks ignite within him, clouded by waves of pleasure. He pushes his fingers in and out and Draco starts to shake forcefully.
He gulped as he took in the nights sky, a familiar feeling residing in his stomach. He couldn’t explain it. He just knew that he needed to write. He needed to write to Potter.
Draco blinked. Potter was right, he was pathetic. He sighed before making his way towards the potions classroom, he was already late.
“Draco!” Pansy gasped, her eyes shining with tears and Blaise wrapped his arm around her, pulling her in for a tight squeeze.
Hermione beamed and mouthed a genuine ‘thank you’ to Draco, who nodded. They didn’t call him the Prince of Slytherin for nothing.
Draco peered down at the small boy; he couldn’t have been older than twelve. He wondered what in Merlin's name was up with mini twelve year olds wanting his attention
Draco lies there, watching silently, as he works on his own bottoms, carefully taking them off. Potter’s cock is thick, long and Draco just wants to ravish it. Once they were both naked, Potter grabs hold of his feet, placing them firmly upon his shoulders. Draco started to squirm. “Shhh, shhh.” Potter whispered, stroking Draco’s face. “I’ll make it good. I promise. I just want you to feel so good.”
“Doesn’t look like nothing, you look like death” she bit out. For a ghost, she was oddly immune to the mention of death. It was quite peculiar indeed.
. He realised that he wanted that. He wanted all of Potter, and he wanted to give all of himself to Potter. Suddenly, all that his mother had said finally made sense.
Anyways, since Draco was obviously older, Potter should have the upmost respect for him. Didn’t he realise that what he was doing was wrong? Hadn’t his parents ever taught him that it was rude to follow those older than him? Oh…wait.
Draco smiled maliciously. “I mean exactly that. A puppet.” He said. “Would you like me to book you in with an appointment at the healers?” he asked innocently. “It appears that your memory isn’t what it used to be.” He quipped.
Potter. Of course, it was. Stupid Potter. With his stupid hair, stupid glasses, and stupid green eyes. Stupid perfect Potter.
Kat beamed. “Were you listening to what I was just saying?” she queried. Truthfully, he hadn't heard one word of what she'd just said.
He felt the warm hand of Pansy entwine with his, as he cried silent tears. The Headmistress carried on, “she helped those who she could. She loved those who needed it. She accepted those who couldn’t accept themselves.” She choked out whilst pulling out a ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badge and pinning it onto her robe.
Theo shook his head, “You haven’t said yes or no.” Draco opened his mouth to correct him but was abruptly cut off. “If I were you I’d keep your mouth shut.” He warned, and Draco decided that keeping his mouth shut seemed like a pretty good idea.
Pansy hummed, “Maybe they just see you for the big old softie we all know that you are.” She joked and Draco wanted to bite her head off.
He nodded. “Yes, very much so. In fact, I think that she’s beautiful.” he said in awe, the same wistful look dancing in his eyes that he'd seen on Macmillan just moments before.
She squeezed his hand painfully hard. “So, promise me Draco. Fucking promise me that if you still feel just a smidge of love for Potter, you’ll go to him and you’ll never look back.” She begged him. “We all dream about finding someone that’s made for us. Someone who doesn’t care what we look like. Someone who appreciates all our misgivings and faults. Someone who loves us unconditionally. You and Potter had that.” She gave him a weak smile.
His aunt gave him an encouraging pat on the back. “So, the question is, what would you do if you had no fear?” she asked and Draco finally knew.
He was alone. He had to be alone. He was the only one that she’d known. The only one that he hoped had truly understood her.
He loosened his tie as soon as he entered Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, approaching the sink and splashing water onto his pale face.
Draco was currently sobbing on his bed, an abundance of Portkeys spawled beneath him. He hadn’t managed to give them to the Muggleborn’s yet and he was running out of time.
Draco smiled through the tears, giving the Headmistress a grateful look. Gathering all his strength, he looked up into the sky, his eyes stopping on the brightest star.
Suddenly, he heard Hermione shout as she, Weasley and the house elf came running towards them. His parents and Bellatrix were down, but they wouldn’t stay that way. Not for long.
Giving your heart wholly to another, that had to be the scariest thing that he’d ever have to do. If he’d ever be brave enough to do it.
It had come up a few days ago in potions when Weasley had told him of his questionable plans for the future. The one and only thing Draco had thought upon hearing them was that Hermione was going to fucking kill him.
“So, do you want to tell me why you were crying outside the big bad Slytherins dorms?” he asked her.
Damn it! This guy didn’t seem like a threat at all. In fact, he seemed like the perfect candidate for Kat’s heart.
He dismissed her with a wave of his hand. “No don’t give me that. I don’t want your pity.” That was the one thing he couldn't take.
“And how do you suppose we test if the potion works? Because I’m sure as hell not drinking it.” Weasley grimaced.
Severus pushed into him harder, “I’ll release you after you’ve answered my question.” he stated with authority.
Kat smiled at him sheepishly. “I’m sorry. I just missed you.” she told him, and Draco reasoned that she should never be sorry for that.
Pansy gave him an almost sympathetic look, “you’re right… they’re just pathetic.” She deadpanned and Draco wanted to strangle her.
Draco arches against him. He barely knows what he’s doing. He just knows that he has to be closer. To have this with the person who accepts him. With the only person that he feels safe with. Who he feels at home with. Potter looks at him with determination, with pure awe and admiration as his hands move all over his back. His kisses become more demanding, and then he grips Draco’s arse, pulling him onto his lap. He was dizzy. He closes his eyes once more, and he can still feel him, can smell him, can’t taste anything but Potter. It’s harder now, louder.
hope. But it was something he could never have. Something that he didn't deserve. He shifted uncomfortably, but it was a feeling that he had. And one that he feared would never go away.
A rustle from outside his bed curtains caught his attention. Oh, for Merlin sake, what now? He thought grumpily.
He shrugged, putting on the façade that he knew all too well. “I made my peace with that fact a long time ago.” He mocked. “Life just becomes so much greater when you accept such fickle things like that.” He said.
He kept on running. He ran and ran without a care in the world for the intrusive looks he was getting.
All that he had fought for, all that he had lost, all that he had found. It had all happened so that he could be here. So that life would lead him down this path. He was free.
They stayed like that for several moments, before Potter pulled out of Draco, murmuring a cleaning spell before pulling him close. “Sleep.” He whispered softly and Draco hummed, feeling safer than he’d ever felt.
changed him. It had made him ruthless, wary, and cruel. But, it had also made him strong, accepting, and loving. War had given him some of the qualities that he hated most about himself. But if given the option, he wouldn’t go back. For war had given him everything that he didn’t realise he so desperately needed.
Severus sighed. “You really are a foolish young boy.” he told him and Draco scoffed. Tell him something he didn't already know.
Potter sat up slowly to face him. “It was nothing. A couple bottles of Polyjuice potion, a Slytherin heir and some bollocks about how Crabbe couldn’t read.” He stated as if what he’d just said had made any sense.
“That would be great.” He answered and she beamed and immediately started to lecture him on the properties of a common healing potion.
Is this how it felt to let your child roam free in the wild? This was horrible. Why did people do this?
Draco took a deep breath. He had to stay calm, he couldn’t break. He had to remain strong for Kat. “Helped me?” he whispered brokenly.
Happily, full of chicken, Draco sat on the couch as he watched Potter play with Teddy in complete awe. He looked so relaxed, so free. He looked almost as happy as the day at the manor when he’d seen Draco again for the first time. Knowing that seeing Draco again had made him happy, filled him up with welcomed delight.
“Good.” He carried on. “Make sure you’re there at exactly seven sharp and I’ll be there to greet you all.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “What is it Macmillan? I’m extremely tired and I do not have time for your babbling right now.”
It was medium sized, composed of a big circle, with two mini circles on top, as well as, a large circular centre which had numbers inscribed onto it.
Hermione gave him a thoughtful look. “Maybe if he spent half as much time working on his relationship as he spends looking at you, then they’d probably have a shot at something real.” She mused.
They lie there, catching their breaths for several seconds before Potter gives him a small peck and sits up. “I need to get going.” He states, hastily putting his uniform back on. “I’ll see you later. Get some sleep.” He whispers, pulling Draco into one last expression filled kiss before reluctantly shrugging on his invisibility cloak and sauntering out of the room.
“NO!” Draco shouted a bit to loudly and Kat’s face fell. He softened his features and sighed, “I mean, no, it’s okay, I’ll only be a few moments.” he smiled. Totally saved it!
Draco was amazed how they could even stand to look at him. How they all managed to appear somewhat functional after all they’ve had to endure.
Well, he didn’t think that he wanted to be a Malfoy anymore. He admitted as he allowed the tears to softly fall.
Theo took an almost calm breath, “I think you should leave, Potter.” It was calm. Too calm. A calmness like that in a situation like this, well.. that was dangerous.
He took a deep breath. “War has changed me.” He honestly stated as simply as he could without going much into it.
It was stupid. He knew it was. Potter would never read the letters. He didn’t even want Potter to read the letters. That was the furthest thing from his mind. It was an outlet. Someone to speak to that hardly knew him. Who didn’t know who Draco really was.
When she’d first told him that, he’d barely understood it. Maybe it was because he was seven at the time, or maybe it was because he just wasn’t that smart. He gulped, yeah, it was probably because he was only seven. Draco wasn’t anything but smart.
Hermione looked at him with tears in her eyes before pulling him into a tight squeeze. “Thank you.” She whispered softly.
Her words startled him. He knew for a fact that he wasn't the person she thought him to be. It was hard, being like this. Putting on a mask that he had become so accustomed to wearing that it seemed less of a mask than a second skin. Going through that everyday, being someone that he hated, but continuing to being that person anyway. It was harder than anyone could ever imagine it to be.
Draco coughed slightly as he attempted to look anywhere but her eyes. He hadn’t been asked that, not for a long time. Many people hadn’t noticed, he doubted that anyone even cared. He gave her a small smile and shook his head hoping it to be an acceptable answer.
“No.” she said abruptly as she stood up to face him. Draco looked up baffled, as he stared into defiant eyes. “She will stay here. With you.” She said determinedly.
He sighed light-heartedly. “Well, I was going to wait to give you this until the last day of school.” He started, “but since you’ve already gifted me your amazing present, it seems only fair.” He finished handing her the present.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, they’re stupid.” He took a deep breath. “I just want to tell you how grateful I am that I found you that day outside the Slytherin dorms. You’ve changed my life for the better.” He choked out.
Harry abruptly got up, making his way to the edge of the cliff so that his gaze was overlooking the sea, Hermione followed suit. “I
Y'all, my heart is breaking for Draco. Drarry will get WORSE before it get's any better. But I promise, it will all be worth the angst. Anyways does anyone know of a good Beta?
Something inside Draco snapped as he marched towards the scene, “Stop this!” he growled, “stop this at once. You’re hurting her.” he yelled.
. We have a chance to do better. To be better than we were yesterday. You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”
“Do you think I don’t know that?” Draco shouted. “Of course, I know that he has my fucking mother. I think about it of every minute of every day.” He didn't want to do this. He didn't want to think about this. Why was Severus doing this? Why was he hurting him so?
Draco took a frustrated breath. “Then don’t say stupid things.” He countered and he had to admit, he was quite proud of that comeback.
Hermione glanced at him solemnly, “Please just stay away.” She whispered and Draco felt his hear smash into two.
His mother had always been so strong. A visionary, filled with hope. Now she was defeated, giving into the darkness that threatened to submerge them all.
He felt raw, exposed, vulnerable. So, he cried. He shook violently in him mother’s arms, until his eyes became swollen from tears and his voice was hoarse because of the sobs.
Draco looked away, his eyes filling with tears. “I’m sorry, I just can’t.” he chocked out before running away like the coward he was.
His father carried on. “What you have with Potter is the real thing. I can tell by the look in your eyes when you speak about him. It’s the same look I get whenever I speak about your mother.” he admitted, a wistful look dancing in his eyes.
He sighed. “Draco. My name’s Draco.” He stated. In all honesty, he felt quite sorry for the girl. She had no friends, no one to talk or laugh with. Draco may as well be dead, but in a sense he was glad that his heart was still beating. That he was still
Potter shook his head violently. “Then I’m staying with you. I don’t care what happens to me. As long as were together.”
He cared. Potter really cared! Knowing that gave Draco the last piece of strength that he needed. He opened the box, taking out the letters, and holding them out to Potter with shaky hands.
“I’ll help, and I bet if we tell Blaise, he’ll help as well.” she promised him, and it were if everything changed.
Draco furrowed his brows, “Did I or did I not already say that I decline your Hogsmeade offer. Or am I going barmy here.” He sarcastically stated.
“Draco.” A voice called from behind him and Draco walked faster, the voice was oddly familiar. Too familiar.
She shifted closer to him, entwining her hand with his. “No, you’re not.” She said defiantly. “You’re the strongest person that I know.” she told him, and no, no, NO! That wasn't right. That wasn't what she was meant to say.
Draco’s heart stopped. Potter’s lips were chapped, the warmness of them igniting a fire within him. Their lips fit perfectly together. Mashing together in a surge of power and dominance. Potter kissed like he fought. Assertive and with a bout of passion.
Draco glanced at Hermione briefly, her wounds seemed to be recovering nicely. Well, everything but that hideous scar. Certain that she would awaken soon with strength, he got up and ran into the battle.
Draco and Potter were sitting by the lake, the stars above them, shimmering in the moonlight. Their hands entwined together; palms sweaty.
He turned around to face Draco, “They were always there for me, as if they were my little friends in the sky. When I was younger I’d tell them all kinds of different stories, and they’d always listen. They’d never judge me or snap at me. No, they’d just listen. For once I felt wanted, as if I belonged.” He said wistfully.
Potter gave his hand one last squeeze. “If you can forgive me. I don’t deserve it and I understand if you didn’t. But if you did, please know that I’ll change. That I have changed. That it’ll be different this time. I understand now. I almost lost you and I never what to lose you again. I care about you far too much.” he finished, and Draco's head start to spin.
He sighed, “fine.” So, Draco told him everything. He spoke about the beginning of his seventh year and his newfound feelings for Potter. He told his father about how he’d been detached and lost all year, and how Potter had been one of the only things to keep him going.
Draco hoped that one day he could be happy. He was tired of this temporary happiness. He wanted to feel truly happy. Without the weight of the world weighing down his every step. Without having to think of moves and countermoves. Without all of the lies and deceit. Just happy. Draco wanted to feel only happiness.
He hadn’t seen nor spoken to Potter since the night that Draco had gifted him the letters. Potter had deemed a moments peace to allow him to think necessary, so had flocked off to the Dragon reserve in Romania where Charlie Weasley worked.
He blinked back the tears that threatened to stain his cheeks. He was in public. A Malfoy never showed emotions in a public space. He took a deep, defeated breath. Perhaps he hated Potter far less than he envied him. Above all, he knew one thing for certain. He could never hate Potter as much as he hated himself.
“NOOOO!” He yelled frantically. “Take me, take me.” He begged as he was dragged out after Potter tears streaming down his face.
His mother sighed, reaching out to grab his other arm. “I don’t think any of us can truly trust our feelings. But if they’re real, we’ll know.”
that they can just get away with it.” he said defiantly, as he turned towards the Hufflepuff's raising a fist to the air. "They. Will. Suffer!” he shouted urging them to follow.
“Do you find the painful death that the Dark Lord is planning for you funny?” He asked and Draco's blood ran cold.
Anyways, he wasn’t likely to run into Potter if he was with his Hufflepuff’s. His Hufflepuff’s kept him safe and Potter only approached Draco when he was alone.
Draco assessed the situation. He could lie, but what would he say? Defeated, he settled for the truth. “I’m going to the Great Lake.” He replied.
Plus, do you have any idea how bloody hard it is to plan a murder, when you have tiny little Hufflepuff balls wanting to pet your hair?
Which is why, Draco felt his heart break as he gazed down at the tear stained woman lying on his lap. “It’s okay mother.” he repeated over and over as he gently threaded his fingers through her hair.
Draco sighed. How could he love somebody like that? A father that took pleasure in murdering innocents. A father who housed the darkest being in wizarding history. A father that hurt him when he misbehaved. A father who chose his Lord over his own son.
So, this was how he wanted to play it? Well, they didn’t call him Draco Lucius Malfoy for nothing. Well, okay they did, but that was besides the point. Activating Draco’s inner Ravenclaw! “You don’t believe me do you? Are you an inbred? Spiders are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and their really fucking hairy.” He commented pointedly.
Theo came to an abrupt stop, lifting Draco’s chin to face him. “Draco, you seriously don’t know how gorgeous you are.” Theo beamed, “Well, let me inform you.” He said matter-of-factly. “You. Are. So. Fucking. Gorgeous!” he exclaimed.
Her eyes widened with determination. “I’m not stupid Draco. I know that it will take a lot longer for you to be as happy as I am.” If his emotions were anything to go by, then he was sure that it would take a lifetime to be as happy as she was.
He couldn’t let anything happen to Potter, not after what he’d admitted just moments before. He loved him. Harry Potter
If he thought that avoiding a bunch of Hufflepuff's was hard, then this was impossible. How in Merlin’s name did you look the man who you plan to murder in cold blood in the eyes?
“I’ve not changed.” He blurted out suddenly. She gave him a baffled look. “I’m still the same git that I was before.” He carried on.
Harry shook his head manically, turning his head from her burning gaze. He couldn’t bare to look at her, not when he was like this. “He doesn’t remember me. He really doesn’t remember me.” He cried out.
Scared, Hermione looked at Draco for help. He shrugged pretending not to look the least bit interested.
Draco was in the library attempting to defeat a particularly violent piece of potions homework. He growled, like hell would his homework be victorious, he was the king of all things potions.
Weasley sighed. “Anyways mate, it’s you who he looks at. You who he drones on and on about. You who he goes out of his way to find. You who he obsesses over.” He started and Draco looked at him in disbelief. “Whatever’s going on between the two of you is downright mad.”
He mused that recent events showed that you could somewhat forget occurrences. But feelings, now those were something that could
He knew he’d never tell Potter. He knew that nobody would never know. But he had to do it. He had to write to Potter. It kept him sane.
Crabbe chuckled unkindly, “we don’t have to do what you say anymore. Your father isn’t as bad as he used to be Malfoy.” He hissed and Goyle nodded.
Draco splutter incredulously, “But I’m dirty. I’m tainted. You need to stay the hell away from me.” He shouted.
It was breezy on the cliff. The air was stuffy, the grass was long and overgrown. Harry dropped down to his knees as soon as he’d hit the ground. Tears were felling down his face; his eyes were red and puffy.
Draco sighed. “What in Merlin’s name did I do to deserve such dramatic friends?” He joked. But was it really a joke.
“The ‘Snarky responses to prevent having to talk about anything of importance’ game”. Dang it! But Draco loved that game.
A smile as large as space lit up her features making her eyes sparkle. “Hi Draco, whatchya doing?” she asked, curiously peering at his sketchbook.
Draco entered the potions classroom with a swish of his robes. Wow, he was feeling awfully dramatic today.
In all honesty, he would have left even if he had no where in particular to go. Theo's questions were becoming too much. It was
“You’re so beautiful.” Potter hums. His mouth sucking onto his neck, his teeth dragging over his sensitive skin. Draco mans, grabbing a fistful of his thick hair, tugging hard.
Potter turned a shade of red darker than humanly possible. “And will you two be getting back to whatever you were doing when I leave?” he challenged.
Draco let out a small sob, his body threatening to shake with tears. He didn’t like this. He didn’t like this at all.
Draco sighed as he attempted to swallow down the bile that was creeping up his throat. What Weasley didn’t realise, what nobody had truly realised was that Draco and Malfoy were the same person. And they were both gits.
Draco ignored him. “And you” he spat at a red-faced Smith “You need to stop acting like a blooming saviour, we’ve already got one of those. And trust me we don’t need nor want another, one’s annoying enough. There’s seriously nothing worse than a Hufflepuff acting like a Gryffindor.” He teased.
Draco narrowed his eyes at his friend, “I’m not miserable, I’m simply just detached.” He countered, secretly hating how pathetic that sounded.
“Potter…please.” He starts to beg in between sobs. “I want you inside me. I need you to come inside me.” He pleaded. Potter adds a third finger and Draco almost black out. He’s sucking him again and again, and he’s full, so, so full, so good.
Severus’ eyes glazed over. “I’m glad you’re okay. And please stay safe.” He said and Draco nodded before exiting the room.
In fact, he looked kind of good. Less prickly and more defined. Less uptight and more relaxed. The soft waves of his hair framed his face, soft wisps of hair brushing his forehead, bringing out the silver in his grey eyes.
. The badges sat proudly on the robes of nearly everyone in the Great Hall. His eyes teared up at the sight, it was truly overwhelming. The smiling, accepting faces of all those around him gave him the last piece of hope that he’d never really realised he’d lost.
“You’re not. By the way. Fine, that is. I know you think that you’re strong, and that you don’t want to hear it. But, it’s okay not to be okay. You need closure. Whatever or whenever that may be. You really need it.” His father said.
He didn’t want this. He didn’t bloody well ask for this. He just wanted to be free. Free from the expectations. Free from the guilt. Free from the pain. Free to be Draco. Not Draco Lucius Malfoy. No. Just
Severus nodded. “I figure that it may pose as quite the challenge.” He reasoned and Draco internally thanked himself.
Draco cringed, imagining his father’s face if he ever found out that not only had his son ventured into muggle London, but he was also using muggle art appliances. He shuddered, silently praying that he’d never have to find out.
“You’re gorgeous.” He breathes and then he’s pushing inside of him, holding his wrists above his head, and pressing them deep into the mattress. Draco struggles as Potter slams into him, relentlessly fierce and sure, giving him just what he needed. What he’s always needed.
He carried on, “But if you can’t, then don’t. I wouldn’t judge you either way. I understand. Believe me, I do. I’ll stand with you no matter what you decide.” He shook Draco’s hand standing next to him so they were side by side.
She shook her head. “Silly Draco. I’m not a young lady. I’m a big, grown Hufflepuff.” She said defiantly.
Kat shook her head in annoyance, “you have got to stop lying to me Draco.” She bit out. “If you do, then I can’t help you.” she said so earnestly that Draco couldn't help but give her something.
“No. No. No. No. NO!” he shouted tears streaming down his face. This wasn’t real. It was a dream. No, a nightmare. One that he needed to wake up from. “Wake up.” He ordered more to himself then the sleeping girl.
“Wow. That’s just pathetic Malfoy, after everything?” Draco couldn’t look at him, he couldn’t face him.
It warmed his heart to see Potter so innocent. So completely oblivious towards Draco's feelings towards him. Didn't he realise just how much he meant to Draco?
“You can’t picture it, can you?” she stated. If he weren’t so concerned about how right she was, he would’ve agreed that he couldn’t picture a thing. “Try it again, but this time, let go of your fear.” She instructed softly.
Although, he couldn't help but acknowledge the small part of him that maybe wanted it to be that he had changed. Maybe, he
But despite everything. Despite the insults, the disappointment, and the doubt, he had become Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter at age nineteen. It had been the best decision that he had ever made.
He huffed. “Yes, you bloody well are and you know it. We both know the real reason you’ve been ignoring me.” Draco remained silent; his eyes glued to his shoes.
She cackled, “That wouldn’t be very smart now, would it?” she bit out. “I’m going to deliver your traitorous body to the Dark Lord.” She admitted with glee.
To Draco’s utter surprise, his father started to chuckle. “Of course, I am. I’m absolutely furious.” He said and Draco’s face fell. “Not because you’re gay, but because you’re dating Potter. My son, a
Draco sighed with boredom, “yes, yes Pansy dearest we’ve established that I don’t care. Now if you could just move out of my way, that would be ever so helpful.” He drawled as he tried to move past her.
A long time ago he would've loved this. He would've craved the attention, basked in it even. But that wasn't the case anymore. No, now he hated it.
So, Theo was obviously upset. To be honest, one part of Draco hated that, but the other part, well... that part was tired and wanted him to fuck right off.
Draco’s eyes softened. “Of course I’m happy to see you, I was just a bit surprised that’s all.” he admitted quickly, not wanting to upset the girl further.
?” she spat out exasperatedly, “Draco your mini temper tantrums put Snape to shame.” Putter old Snape to shame... he could get on board with that.
It was a mesmerising sight. He’d never in his eighteen years had seen his father cry. So, to see him, so raw and exposed, grieving for all that Draco had lost, but proud of all that he had become, was the best gift anyone could’ve possibly given to him.
His father eyed him sceptically, “I’m not one for talking about things so miniscule such as feelings, but even I can see that your caught up in them.” He stated.
“You’ve been a very, very bad boy.” She whispered in his ear, raking her sharp nails into his hair. He visibly shuddered, willing himself not to throw up. “I tired to fix it.” she spat out and Draco froze.
He raised up a hand in protest. “Draco.” He stated. “You can call me Draco.” He offered. Might as well get to know his future son-in-law.
“Anyways,” Blaise perked up. “Why ruin a little girl with your absmayl makeup skills.” He remarked. “You look hideous, darling.” He mocked. Sadly, Draco couldn't help but agree.
Draco felt broken as he watched Potter leave, deep down knowing that Potter had taken his heart with him.
Weasley gave Draco a slight smile, “You know what Malfoy, I still hate your guts, but I think we’ll work together just fine.” he told him, and Draco was surprised at that.
If the Dark Lord thought him complacent, then he'd become expendable. And if he was expendable, well... he didn't want to think about that.
Reluctantly, he scooted a little closer to the girl so that his knee was just touching hers. He opened the page onto a sketch of the lake, long, glowing, and vast. She gasped, a small hand flying towards her mouth.
Ignorance was bliss. And pretending, or even forgetting the life he led before this was safer for everyone. The only thing that drives someone is hope, and if that was lost then there was only fear. And if there was only fear there was acceptance. And if there was acceptance then no one got hurt.
“Draco,” his mother spoke softly and Draco eye’s snapped up immediately. It was the first time his mother had spoken to him in over a year. His mother, his beautiful, brave, compassionate mummy. “Come.” She whispered, nodding her head warmly.
“And who’s fault is that?” he answered scathingly. Giving his father a pointed and somewhat frustrated look.
Truth be told, ever since first year, Draco hadn't really planned on working at all; and given his inheritance, he didn't actually need to anyway.
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry into something that personal." Aria said quietly, drawing his attention to the guilty look on her face.
"Just a little piece of advice, Potter. If you keep hiding this, Draco's bound to find out sooner or later. You should stop underestimating just how sharp Slytherins can be." She said in a smug tone of voice.
"Just one more left, I think." He answered, skimming through the list of ingredients before tucking it back into his pocket. When she looked relieved at his answer, Draco snickered under his breath. "Don't tell me you're getting tired already, Potter?"
Aside from Blaise and Pansy, Draco also saw Morag MacDougal sprawled on the rug in front of the fireplace, surrounded by a dozen books all haphazardly scattered by her feet. Hannah Abbott, on the other hand, was reading by herself in a lone corner of the room, though the former Hufflepuff kept looking up every now and then, her eyes darting nervously around her.
Shoving his hands into his pocket, Draco was just debating with himself whether he should bother walking back with them or head off on his own when he heard Aria clearing her throat. Looking up, his gaze flicked down to the dark green sweater that she was holding back out to him.
"You know what? Forget I said anything." Draco caught the brief flicker of hurt on Aria's face before he turned his attention back to Astoria and gave her a well-practiced, charming smile. "Of course I'll go to the Yule Ball with you, Astoria. In fact, it would be my pleasure to accompany you. Oh and please do relay my regards to your father for me." He added.
"You and Pansy always have such repressed, murderous rage. You both really need to get laid." Blaise drawled sarcastically, rolling his eyes as he bit into a treacle tart - only to wince and accidentally spit it back out a few seconds later when Draco stomped on his foot at the exact same time Pansy kicked him in the shin.
As she began walking away from him and up the steps towards the owlery, Draco couldn't help but notice the thin cloak she was wearing and the fact that the bloody git wasn't even wearing a scarf. Oddly enough, he also noticed the strange, unfamiliar markings that looked tattooed on the nape of her neck just behind her braid.
"Hey, Aria! Come on, babe! You like me, r—remember?!" Blaise choked out, wincing in pain and trying to twist himself away. "I thought we were good friends by now!"
They heard an indignant gasp and looked up just in time to see Hermione walking over to them. She stopped beside Weasley and leveled Luna with a disapproving look. "I can't believe you're condoning his actions, Luna! He's a prefect, he's supposed to be setting an example!" She pointed out, glaring at Blaise's shamelessly impenitent smirk.
"What exactly were you waiting for anyway? At some point, you had my feather and my veela name, you could have made me do anything you wanted!"
"Please tell me you're wearing that anti-bewitchment necklace that Hermione gave you." She muttered.
The elderly nurse shook her head and gave Aria one last doting smile before she nodded at her in approval and stepped back out through the curtains. As soon as Madam Pomfrey was gone, Aria sighed softly before turning to give Ron a wry smile.
Thank you so much for all the love and positive reception for this story! I know there wasn't much Draco - Aria interaction here but there will be in the next chapter, I promise. As always, reviews, comments and kudos are love! :D
"Alright then. Since everyone around this bloody table already knows." Aria set her fork back down onto her plate and sighed. "Go ahead and say what you want to say. You've obviously seen
Blaise called their attention when he suddenly knelt down, holding his wand above an orange lump of fur on the ground. He waited until Draco and Pansy crouched down beside him before he lowered his wand, illuminating the figure of a dead, orange fox.
"I don't understand. If Malfoy's here, how will this even work? What am I doing here?!" Aria pointed out, tapping her foot impatiently on the ground. "I mean, aren't
"Aria." She paused in the middle of reaching for a valerian root and looked up at him, meeting his slightly surprised look with a small smile.
"Well, lucky for us, we seem to be doing just fine." Aria assured him, chuckling as she watched him bend down to adjust the fire underneath their cauldron. "Besides, we're almost done anyway. After the potion is ready, one of us just has to leave it in a cool place for the remainder of the lunar cycle."
At this point, Aria had heard enough of their conversation to feel mildly annoyed at Corner's persistence. She finally stepped out of her hiding spot and drew their attention with a long suffering, heavy sigh of exasperation.
That was when Draco realized that it actually didn't matter to him if they lost today's match after all.
"Alright, enough with that. Let's assign your new partners for the remainder of the year, shall we?" He chuckled at the chorus of groans he heard from the class and reached over to pick up the roll of parchment from his desk.
been resorted into their new respective houses – something that Ron (and a handful of other horrified students) was definitely not happy about.
"Y—you will?" Greg's eyes went so ridiculously wide with incredulity that Aria couldn't help laughing and shaking her head at his reaction. "I—I mean, seriously? You'll actually go to the Ball with me? You, Harriah Potter?" He asked again, his voice cracking.
I did it! If it makes any difference, I wasn't planning to use it against you anymore! And before that incident at the Yule Ball, I was actually planning to give it back to you."
"How did you learn about your veela name?" He leaned down and followed the path his fingers had made on her skin with his lips.
Blaise leaned back lazily against the couch, crossing his arms over his chest and casually resting an ankle against one knee. When he didn't answer and just continued to smirk at her, Aria rolled her eyes at him and decided to take his silence as a 'yes'.
The harsh sound of Draco slamming the heavy doors of the dormitory shut reverberated all the way until the common room, making Blaise, Pansy and the rest of the remaining Slytherins flinch.
"I think she's the loveliest, kindest and most graceful girl I've ever me met." He reached up to wipe the single bead of sweat above his eyebrow. "I've been in love with her since we were five years old. Ever since the day our parents took us to the same party and she was the only kid there who bothered to talk to me, even though I was so shy and quiet. I want nothing more than for her to be happy. I only wish she could feel the same about me." He said quietly.
sensitive to direct sunlight, yes, and it causes us enough pain and discomfort to be a nuisance. To solve this, we just drink a sunscreen potion or use sunscreen charms whenever we go out during the day."
He stopped when he reached Aria's discarded glove a few feet away from where she was crouched and bent down, scooping it into his hands. Then, ignoring the confused look on Draco's face, he walked over to her and carefully handed her the gloves without saying anything.
When she saw the way Aria was gaping at her, Hermione rolled her eyes and gave her an exasperated look.
He didn't wait for Aria to say anything else after that as he shot Pansy one last, angry sneer before he turned on his heel and stormed off, his footsteps fading away down the long, narrow corridor. As soon as he was gone, Aria shifted her gaze over to Pansy in question. When she saw the way the girl was sniffing and hugging herself, purposely avoiding her eyes, Aria let out another exasperated sigh and fought the urge to roll her eyes.
Draco let out a breathless laugh, grinning as he lay back down onto the bed and finally allowed himself to submit to her powerful veela pheromones. His hands moved to grip at her hips, pulling her down against him and adjusting her position so that he was better seated inside her tight, absolutely perfect warmth.
"I know who you are, Zach. You can call me Aria." Aria answered, giving his hand a firm shake before pulling away and winking at him. "We met back in fifth year during DA, remember?" She teased.
He noticed the nervousness in Aria's eyes when she spoke and carefully schooled his expression into a blank mask, not wanting her to find out just yet that he had seen a part of her broken wing sticking out. But mostly, it was because Draco wasn't sure if he was ready to confront her about it just yet.
"Oh." Draco's gaze involuntarily flicked to his wand in surprise, belatedly realizing that he had been twirling it around in thought. "Yeah, she returned it to me right after my acquittal at the Ministry trial but for some reason, it stopped working properly for me since then. I had to buy a new one." He admitted.
Aria had just reached over to give Neville a comforting pat on the shoulder when a loud, obnoxious click — followed by the bright flash of a camera behind them suddenly caused her to stiffen and whirl around in shock. As soon as she recognized the tacky yellow curls of Rita Skeeter's hair and the wide, predacious smile on her face as she approached their group, Aria's expression hardened and she took a careful step away.
"At this point, there's nothing for us to do but wait." Aria told her, sighing in defeat. "I'm willing to bet that he'll act again soon, anyway."
To his relief, Aria actually sounded more amused than horrified at seeing him there, and when she just chuckled and went on with what she was doing before she noticed him, Draco frowned and shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
"Corey's my younger brother." Pansy looked annoyed, rudely cutting Hannah off before she could finish her question. "He's in second year, same as the two boys who were punished.
Nodding, she reached out, clasping his hand in her small, gloved one and giving his fingers a firm squeeze.
"Different veelas are attracted to different types of men – wizard and muggle alike. It does not matter if he is handsome, rich, smart, tall, fit, pureblood, half-blood or muggleborn. Each veela is different as to what she considers attractive. When an unmated veela touches a compatible mate, her veela instincts take over and may cause her hormones to go crazy. Conversely, if an unmated veela touches a horribly
They were both laughing when Aria practically ran away from him, scurrying down the corridor before he could try anything else. She had already gotten a good couple of meters ahead of him when her eyes suddenly widened in alarm and she froze in her tracks, hastily squeezing her legs together underneath her skirt. Grumbling, she made a face as she looked up and glanced around, looking for the nearest bathroom. Fortunately, there was one nearby, and before Draco could say anything, she shoved past him and rushed toward it without another word.
"So that means not everyone will change house?" Hannah Abbott asked hopefully as she and a handful of other nervous looking Hufflepuffs joined them.
Draco flushed and immediately tried to step back to lengthen the distance between them but she leaned in even closer, tiptoeing her feet up until her lips were dangerously close to his ear. His breath hitched, and alarm bells started going off in his head at her nearness, but still, the sweet scent of her hair drew him closer; close enough so that he was all too aware of the inviting heat emanating from her body.
After everyone had finished with their awkward introduction attempts, Blaise took the liberty of ordering everyone another round of snacks and drinks. The conversation remained stilted for another hour or so, but when they got to the point where Blaise was ordering their fifth (or perhaps
After they both finished the water and placed the empty glasses onto the bedside table, Aria pulled off the shirt she was wearing and snuggled back into the bed beside him. They crawled under the thick white comforter to get warm and Draco pulled her against him so that he was spooning her from behind, his arm wrapped around her waist and his lips kissing and nipping possessively at the veelish symbols along her nape.
And lastly, though Aria was reluctant to admit it, Blaise's skill as a keeper was easily on par with Ron's.
Teddy Lupin and Victoire Weasley came in first, hand-in-hand, as the ringbearer and flower girl. They were closely followed by the bridesmaids (which consisted of Ginny, Luna, and, surprisingly, Millicent Bulstrode) and the groomsmen (Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, and Percy Weasley). The last pair to enter before the Bride and Groom themselves were George Weasley and Aria, as the Best Man and Maid of Honor. When Ron and Hermione finally entered the reception area and walked through the wedding arch, hand in hand, all of the guests stood up and welcomed them with cheers and a warm round of applause.
"Stop staring at her!" Draco suddenly snapped at the other boy as he untangled the thick green blanket from around his shoulders and tossed it at Aria's face. "And bloody hell, Potter! Cover yourself up when you're in the common room! There are
"So?" Blaise looked bored at that as he shrugged and gave Pansy a questioning look. "What's so bad about that? Their family is filthy rich. Honestly? Given the shrinking pool of men out there considered 'acceptable' under your father's antiquated standards, you could do a lot worse." He pointed out bluntly.
They walked to their assigned classrooms in cold, awkward silence after that, broken only by the occasional clacking of their heels against the floor. When they reached the fifth floor corridor, Pansy spoke up again just as Aria was pushing past one of the classroom doors.
The three feathers burst into bright green flames. Fisher slumped back down onto his back, exhausted, and not ten seconds later, Draco heard the soft, ruffling of the leaves along one of the tree branches above their heads, followed by the sound of a wing flapping in the air.
Draco frowned at her in concern and he would have asked her if she was alright had Bentley not shoved him again, causing Draco to growl in annoyance as he snapped his attention back to the younger boy.
Rolling her eyes, Pansy was just about to walk off when several shouts coming from her right caused both her and Aria to look up. They glanced to the side, their eyes widening in surprise when they saw Hannah arguing loudly with Ernie Macmillan near one of the refreshment tables. The former couple was so engrossed with shouting at each other that they barely noticed everyone else around them watching their altercation.
Aria rolled her eyes at him but allowed him to pull her closer until her wings folded up neatly against his chest. He rested his chin on her shoulder and reluctantly turned his attention to the rest of their group just as Ron Weasley and Seamus Finnigan burst into cheers and laughter.
To everyone's surprise, Fleur didn't bother hiding her amusement at the question as she immediately covered her mouth and giggled. Once she had gotten her laughter under control, she waved her hand and gave a slightly embarrassed Susan an apologetic smile.
Draco smirked at the irritated look on Granger's face when most of their classmates chuckled at Wood's mention of muggle bigotry.
"I've heard from a lot of sources that your mother is quite an interesting character." She mentioned.
Aria muttered the password and they entered the common room together, ignoring the surprised stares they received from some of the seventh year Slytherins lounging in the living area. As they trudged up the stairs towards the girls' dorms and Aria reached for the doors, Pansy stopped her again by giving her a quick, barely noticeable nudge on the shoulder.
Draco squinted in the darkness; and he paled in realization when he recognized the three white feathers Fisher was holding in his hand.
As they were making their way around the perimeter of Russel Square, Draco stopped underneath a large tree and gently pulled his hand away from hers.
Fleur Delacour, still looking as radiant and beautiful as she did four years ago, stopped in front of the classroom and flashed everyone a wide, dazzling smile.
Without warning, she began bobbing her head up and down while stroking the base of him with her hand. Draco tangled his fingers into her long hair, whispering pleadingly as he pushed her head down and tried to bury himself deeper. Aria closed her eyes and obliged him by taking his entire length into her mouth, all the way until he hit the back of her throat.
Of, if she was being really thorough and tried to analyze the situation as methodically as an Auror would, there was also the possibility that Greg could have simply
He stifled another urge to smirk when he saw the miserable way Aria was looking down at her feet, refusing to look up at him as she snatched the gloves and goggles from his hands.
"Er, yes. I did." Aria arched an eyebrow, a little disturbed by his peculiar reaction. "In fact, I'm actually their new seeker."
He immediately looked away and forced out another laugh, reaching out and taking a long sip from his glass of wine. Once he managed to set the glass back down, he steeled his nerves and finally looked up, meeting her worried gaze.
"No! Bloody hell, of course not!" Aria countered angrily, her shoulders slumping in exasperation. "It was just an
"But don't worry, Aria. I'll spend the entirety of this year protecting you and making sure those Slytherins know their place. I won't let any of them touch you." He declared wholeheartedly, his unnervingly blue eyes gleaming with something Aria didn't quite understand.
for me. And to be honest, being with him kind of sucked. He was always so distant and distracted all the time. Plus, it didn't help that he spent most of fourth
Aria rolled her eyes and deliberately ignored them, turning her attention to Luna beside her. She smiled and accepted the bottle of butterbeer Luna offered to her before she took a long sip.
"Whether or not the school board acted impartially regarding the vandalism case - and whether or not their decision is just another consequence of this so-called 'hate campaign' against Slytherins, the fact of the matter is, the evidence found
They broke apart instantly, looking up to find Ron and Hermione watching them with matching smirks on their faces. Hermione raised an eyebrow and glanced pointedly at their clasped hands.
noises she was making. Her hands trembled as she trailed them up his back, linking urgently around his neck. She pulled him closer and kissed him back with equal fervor, her tongue clashing wildly against his as they both seemed desperate to taste as much of each other as they possibly could.
He didn't wait for the younger Slytherin to respond before he grabbed him by the collar of his robes and began leading him back towards the main area of the library. After grabbing his bag and muttering a quick farewell to Greg and Astoria – though Draco doubted they heard him as the two were too busy giggling at another one of those weird inside joke of theirs that only
Potter took a deep breath. “I just lose it when I’m around you. I get so angry and I just can’t control it.” he sighed.
Draco pulled back hastily, barely comprehending what he was hearing. He saved her? No, he had killed her. He was the reason that she was dead. She’d still be alive if it weren’t for him. His best friend would still be here to make him happy.
Draco blinked a few times, as if he could not believe his ears. He looked shyly at her big beaming smile, and felt for the first time, that she may be right.
he thought deviously. “Muggle?” he said hopefully and Potter grinned. Draco stared at the contraption in complete awe before his face started to fall. “But I don’t have my turny breaky thing.” He muttered sadly. “How am I supposed to look inside it?”, he started to shake it frantically.
Was she doing this to get a rise out of him or something? Peculiar. Peculiar! No, what was peculiar was the amount of makeup she caked onto her face each day, but she wasn't ready to have
He brought Draco in for a bone crushing hug, “Oh So Dark One!” he cried, sobbing into Draco’s hair, which he didn’t find particularly amusing. “You saved me.” He whispered quietly.
He sighed realising that she wasn’t going to let this go.  “My mother wasn’t able to get the potions cauldron that I so desperately wanted.” He lied through his pearly white teeth.
“But do I think you’re dirty? No. Do I think that you’re tainted. Of course, not. Will I stay away from you? No chance in hell.” He carried on looking straight into Draco’s eyes. “You’re not a terrible person Draco. You’ve apologised to Ron and Hermione, you’re even good friends now. You help those in need. You make people happy. You stood by me even after all the crap I’d put you through. Hell! You’re even best friends with Hufflepuff’s.”
He sighed, “Did you need anything?” he asked with a huff. All he wanted was to grab his sketchbook and leave. Was that too much to ask?
Draco sneered at him and Potter grinned daftly, “Well, Potter I didn’t tell you to accept any of my invitations and you did, so I guess we both don’t get what we want.” Potter bit out and Draco almost smiled, because that maybe just a teeny bit, that sounded a lot like Draco.
Draco shook his head, “they haven’t done anything to me Potter. You sound crazy right now.” he pointed out.
Okay, maybe he was being a tad dramatic. He had to admit, it was quite nice to have people follow him around. And not because they thought they were up to something, or they wanted to cure or hex him. No, because they actually admired him and thought him a good person. Must be what perfect Potter was used to, he mused.
Kat shook her head, “I want to see the look on your face when you open it. So, open it. Open it. Open it!” she ordered excitedly.
“You have to help me out here Draco.” Potter sighed in frustration. “You have to give me something else. Something more.” He urged almost pleadingly.
Hermione pulled him in for yet another hug. “Just don’t ever do anything like this again. I’ve been so scared Draco.” She squeezed him even tighter, as if she were scared he would slip from her fingers.
The Headmaster nodded. “Are you sure that you wouldn’t like a lemon drop?” he asked, gesturing to the bowl.
“Maybe not, but I’m not sure that was every really me. I just can’t go back to being that narrow-minded idiot.” he admitted almost honestly to Weasley which shocked him to no end.
She held him tightly as Draco shook violently with tears. He could bare understand it. He’d done this? He’d helped Kat? It couldn’t be true. It just couldn’t. “You
be.” She told him. “I’ll make sure of it.” she declared. “I promise.” she breathed out and Draco just couldn't believe her.
Against his better judgment, he absently wondered what Potter would do if he found out what Draco had planned.
Draco glanced at the shelve beside him, dread lacing the pits of his stomach. To his right, lay a necklace. He shuddered, he felt physically sick.
But at the same time, they were so different. He’d been raised by the Dursleys, and even though they’d been less than good, at least he knew they hadn’t loved him. At first it had been a tough pill to swallow. They were his family. He wanted them to love him, so, so much. But they hadn’t and he was so thankful for that, because if they had, he knew that he would’ve turned out just like them.
Draco made his way over to the refreshment table at the end of the room. He heard a loud thud from somewhere behind him, followed by a chorus of loud, boisterous laughter. When he turned around, he saw Zach drinking with a group of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws a few meters away from the entrance. Draco noticed that amongst their group, Zach was obviously the only one who wasn't drunk (though not for lack of drinking, if the nearly empty bottle of firewhiskey in his hand was any indication). Zach's friends, on the other hand, looked just about ready to throw up — and Justin Finch-Fletchley was already passed out on the floor.
The anger on Ron's face instantly disappeared; only to be replaced with a grimace as he stared at her in confusion. He grunted and turned to glance at Hermione with a completely baffled look on his face.
Draco shrugged off Pansy's insistent tugging on his arm and moved to stand near the back, behind one of the classroom doors. He crouched slightly and watched as Aria reluctantly hung back from her Gryffindor friends and turned her attention to Fleur.
"It gets worse." Blaise added, drawing Draco and Aria's attention to him as he approached them. He sighed and raked a hand through his dark hair in frustration. "The Headmistress summoned Corey this morning for questioning. Apparently, all of the evidence this time points to him."
Blaise grinned at her, leaning back against the couch pillows and lazily folding both of his arms behind his head.
"Is that so?" Draco stifled a smirk and obliged him with an amused grin instead. "Alright, I suppose you can tell me all about it on the way—hey! Watch where you're going, you filthy blighter!"
"Oh come on now." Aria laughed at his sullen expression and cupped his cheek. She noticed the way a lot of students sitting nearby turned to gape at them, shocked at her public display of affection, but she ignored their reactions and leaned in closer, pressing her mouth teasingly against his.
really bad." She flushed at the way Draco was holding her and squirmed in his arms again, turning her face away. "It might be broken. I can barely lift my shoulder." She whispered.
They made the trip to the hospital wing in tense silence. When they reached the doors, Draco was just about to make his way to the private wards when Ron stopped him. He shook his head and pointed Draco towards Madam Pomfrey's office.
"Oh stop making such a big deal about it, Longbottom. It's not like I soiled your shoes or anything. Knowing you, they were probably already filthy to begin with." Pansy drawled nastily.
Draco, Blaise, and the rest of the Slytherin 8th years were in the middle of breakfast when the two girls plopped down beside each other opposite them and wordlessly began helping themselves to some food.
wasn't the idiot who nearly killed the savior of the wizarding world." Draco countered hotly, his arms involuntarily tightening around Aria and pulling her closer against him.
Ignoring the suspicious look he gave her, she turned away from him and closed her eyes, furiously shaking her head to clear her thoughts. When she managed to regain her composure a few minutes later, she took a deep, shaky inhale of breath and turned back around to face him, giving him a forced smile that didn't quite seem to reach her eyes.
That infuriating, completely deadpan expression on Morag's face was back as she simply arched her eyebrow higher, watching him with a smug, knowing look.
To those who continue to wait for updates, thank you so much for your patience and support! Rest assured, I do intend to finish this story so try not to worry if I take longer than usual between updates. ;)
They were both chuckling by the time they reached the small, narrow hallway leading to the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room. Aria stepped forward, the password already on the tip of her tongue but she stopped when she noticed the way Pansy seemed to hesitate behind her. The short-haired girl was giving Aria a strange look that she couldn't quite place.
"Not as bad as I think it is?! Salazar's sake, Hermione!" Aria's horrified, enraged screech was loud enough that Ron winced again and had to cover his ears. "Have you seen yourself?! You're a
"No, that won't work. He's already's going with Demelza Robbins." Hannah answered dejectedly, looking away to hide the miserable tilt to her lips.
Surprisingly enough, everyone (including the older veelas who sat beside her) just laughed at her words. Shrugging, Aria leaned back against her seat and continued with the rest of her statement.
She didn't elaborate but Blaise sensed the irritation in her voice anyway and he chuckled, giving her a knowing look.
She chuckled at his impatient reaction. "He says that the transaction went exactly as you expected it would, and that he'll even pick it up himself tomorrow morning. So you needn't worry so much."
"A little." Aria admitted ruefully as she self-consciously adjusted her braid. "Unfortunately, suppressing my appearance doesn't do anything to dispel the veela allure. Just as Fleur said, I have to keep my hair tied back all the time to lessen it."
Ilyana just smiled dotingly at him. "Miss Granger can stay, obviously, as she is still bedridden. But the rest of you, yes, if you please."
Instead of answering, Draco scoffed at her and looked away, pretending to busy himself with his glass of wine.
"You sound like Draco." Blaise snorted and rolled his eyes, waving her concern aside. "I realize it's a bit risky but the war is over and I, for one, would like to forget about it and move on. I think this new resorting thing is a great opportunity to get past all that, wouldn't you say?"
Fleur smirked when she noticed the way most of the boys had suddenly snapped their heads up to look at her.
stayed up the night before to finish her essay for the very same class she missed. Aria had no doubt that having to deal with an entire evening of Parkinson's annoying little temper tantrums would be the
"—I never got to thank you properly. You know, for catching me during our quidditch game." Aria began uncertainly.
Rolling her eyes to herself, Aria was just about to return to her task of cleaning their table when a strange movement from the corner of her eye suddenly caught her attention. Following the motion, her gaze flicked over to the side to where Greg was standing a few feet beside her – only for her to pale and stiffen in horror at the sight of a giant, hairy
He waited until Aria lifted her gaze back up to meet his before he winked and gave her an appraising grin. "Personally, I think it was brilliant of you to do that, by the way. That bloke needed a serious boost of confidence after Astoria chose to go with Draco to the Yule Ball instead of him." He pointed out.
Her wings closed in around her, shielding her face from view; but before she could walk away, she felt a pair of strong arms wrapping tightly around her, turning her back around and gently coaxing her wings open. A few seconds later, she found herself pressed firmly against a warm, hard chest.
Aria growled and tried kicking Draco under the table but it was too late. Blaise's eyes widened and he burst out laughing at the exact same time Hannah let out a horrified wail and covered her face with both of her hands.
An amused, feminine voice to his right broke him out of his thoughts and caused him to stiffen in surprise.
"You seem a little too accustomed to all this, Malfoy. Is that why you insisted on eating down here instead of in the Great Hall?" Aria countered, narrowing her eyes at him. "Exactly how many girls have you brought here with you?"
"I have a pretty high alcohol tolerance." Aria looked amused as she flashed them both a smug smile before tipping her head back to finish the last of her drink. "Though I'll admit, my hand-eye coordination and balance does tend to suffer a bit when I'd had too much to drink but that's about it." She told them.
Meanwhile, Pansy continued to keep mostly to herself, and it wasn't until she had finished unpacking her belongings and was sliding under the covers in her pajamas that she addressed them all again.
From the seat across Blaise, Pansy snorted derisively at Aria's disbelieving expression and glared at her.
"Are you sure I can't convince you to join?" Wood asked again, completely oblivious to the way Draco was sneering at him from over Aria's shoulder.
and looked up with glowing blue eyes, glaring furiously at Draco from way on the other side of the pitch. He signaled impatiently to Jenson, who in turn nodded and flew over towards him.
"It's not like that. The truth is, after you and I broke up, I was devastated for weeks. I immediately regretted it afterwards and I
"How's this? I'll start preparing all the instruments we'll need, and you can start gathering the ingredients?" She offered him another grin, waiting patiently until the Gryffindor sighed and eventually placed his much larger hand in hers.
A few days ago, one columnist had printed a feature about the details of Aria's veela ancestry; and just yesterday, a notoriously disreputable tabloid actually published a list of possible candidates of who they thought would be the most 'acceptable' as Harriah Potter's mate. It was outrageously in-depth, providing a detailed analysis of why each of the 30 bachelors mentioned would be a responsible mate for the Girl-Who-Lived; and the list itself was diverse — ranging from young, up and coming male celebrities, to older, powerful politicians born from traditional pureblood families.
The day after that, during the NEWT exam for Arithmancy, Draco saw Hannah hyperventilating and having a panic attack of her own outside the entrance doors of the Great Hall. Luckily, Pansy and Neville were with her and managed to calm her down before the actual exam started — nevermind the fact that Neville didn't really look all that good either. In the days leading up to his Herbology NEWT, Neville had actually taken to ignoring everyone and walked around with a thick, enchanted earmuff on his ears, repeatedly muttering all of the notes he was trying to memorize under his breath.
Fortunately, all of the new 8th year Slytherins – Potter, Longbottom, Abbott, Mcdougal, and Smith – mostly kept to themselves and didn't cause any trouble during their first few days. Even Abbott, who always looked like she was going to burst out crying whenever she saw Draco, Pansy
Thankfully, when he noticed that neither Draco nor Aria was able to form any coherent sentence in response to Morag's question, Blaise took pity on them and deliberately drew Morag and Neville into a lively discussion about a few subjects they were taking together. Surprisingly enough, the tactic seemed to work and Draco let out a shaky exhale of breath before taking a
Draco stared at her for a long moment, and he made sure to keep the expression on his face completely blank. He struggled to form the most appropriate response to her question.
with you, darling?" Narcissa frowned in concern, reaching across the table and placing her hand on top of his. "You've been distracted and lost in your own head all morning. Is there a problem? Are you feeling ill?"
Needless to say, Draco didn't dare open his mouth, much less speak to anyone, until the damn spell wore off.
She figured it was the best decision anyway, especially since Ron and Hermione would be spending their break separately with their families this year. Of course, as expected, they
"Because it's Aria." Luna answered, looking up and meeting his doubtful gaze with another knowing smile. "All she's ever really wanted is to be happy with someone she loves and loves her back. And she obviously loves
Sighing, he pulled his gaze away from the former Gryffindor trio and turned back to rifle mindlessly through his notebook.
seekers was unmistakeable as Ginny effortlessly tailed after Aria, their distance from each other barely a feet away. It was only when Aria did an impressive swerve around one of the Gryffindor goal posts that Ginny lost her momentum and pulled back; and Aria used that opportunity to close in on the golden snitch.
Aria felt a familiar twinge of sadness at the thought of George, suddenly reminded of how much the war last year had cost him.
Thankfully, Aria never left him alone with any of the Weasleys for too long, and when the rest of the wedding guests finally began to show up the next morning, Draco was finally able to go off on his own and mingle with their old schoolmates.
She couldn't help but think back on how she herself had mistakenly suspected Pansy for the first vandalism incident a few weeks ago. And now, the very same circumstances –
Draco peered at Morag through the spaces between the bookshelves, noting the way she pursed her lips and the way her shoulders had gone completely rigid when the two Ravenclaw girls suddenly burst into mocking giggles.
up. She stared anxiously at him for a long time, fiddling nervously with her hands, before she finally seemed to make a decision and looked away, snapping her mouth shut.
on her and ask her some obscure question about something that had taken place during the Goblin – Werewolf war in the eighteenth century.
The entire Great Hall, led by the Gryffindors of course, had burst out laughing and watched with glee as the Slytherins glared at them and struggled to continue with the rest of their dinner that night, hiccups, bubbles and all. Thankfully, the effect had worn off in a few hours and by the time everyone was back to normal, Aria and Blaise had already planned out a counter attack.
"Hey babe." Blaise grinned impishly at her, pointedly ignoring the way Draco's eyes flashed and flicked to glare at him in annoyance. "We were just talking about heading over to Hogsmeade and getting some celebratory drinks. Would you care to join us?" He asked.
"Is that so?" Aria chuckled at the exaggeratedly self-assured look on his face. "Alright then, Malfoy, I suppose you can tag along with me if you want." She shrugged and gestured for him to follow her into the train.
"She's fine, I think." Draco answered, running a hand through his wind-swept hair. "Weasley brought her to the hospital wing. I think she just has a broken shoulder."
Draco couldn't help but notice the way Fleur's expression changed somewhat and the way her eyes twinkled mischievously when she saw Aria sitting in the middle of the room. When Aria winced and hastily looked away from her, Fleur just smiled again and turned her attention back to McGonagall.
When Aria faltered and scrounged desperately through her mind for an answer, Draco sneered again and stepped closer towards her – much,
I wasn't on the quidditch team! That doesn't mean I can't become a professional quidditch player! My
"Of course I know that, you bloody idiot." At his words, the irritated scowl on Aria's face dissolved into a genuine, albeit exasperated smile. "If you think for one minute that you going all sappy on me will get me to take it easy on you at quidditch tomorrow, you've got another thing coming, Weasley." She teased.
Zach rolled his eyes at her quip while Neville reddened and gave her a sheepish grin, deliberately looking away when Pansy turned her head to glare reproachfully at him. Chuckling, Aria gave them one last smile and wave before she walked off, heading towards the doors of the common room. As she left and everyone resumed their earlier conversations, Blaise turned to Draco.
Sprawled out on the grass beside Draco, Bentley shot up to his feet and looked close to tears as he ran towards her, his features twisted into a guilty wince.
Draco made a disgusted face and immediately washed the cake down by taking a long sip from the bottle of firewhiskey he held in his hand. "Bloody hell, that was way too sweet, Potter." He complained.
"Looks like Gryffindor didn't have any problems getting replacement Beaters after all." He commented, smirking.
"All those hours she spent training certainly kept her mind off what happened during the war. To be honest, all of us have been trying something new nowadays. It helps us forget about—" Ron's voice broke and he immediately cut himself off, averting his gaze from Ginny to stare at the ground by his feet.
"You have to take a shot." Blaise ignored Neville's comment and handed Aria the shot glass in his hand, rolling his eyes when Aria's first instinct was to sniff suspiciously at it. "It's just a little liquid courage, Potter. To help you loosen up a little."
In spite of himself, Draco couldn't help chuckling at the oh-so-clever and witty name she used to sign the letter at the end, thinking back to how she had deliberately avoided telling him her name back at that train station.
He paused and narrowed his eyes at her, inspecting her appearance from head to toe. "Don't tell me you've been suppressing your true form since the year started? You really shouldn't do that, Potter."
He continued to ghost his hand all over her body, exploring and experimenting with their new connection.
breathing hard as he closed his eyes and rested his forehead against hers. The reprieve didn't last long, however, because as soon as he opened his eyes again, he saw the way Aria was staring hungrily at his mouth. She licked her lips, now bruised red and swollen, and lifted her burning gaze up slowly to meet his eyes.
"Come on." He noticed the way she was beginning to shiver and took out his wand, wordlessly casting a charm that conjured up a small, invisible 'umbrella' over their heads to shield them from the rain. "We've gathered enough ingredients. Let's head back to the castle before you catch a cold."
"You wrote down her name?!" Pansy screeched and whacked him hard on the arm. "What the bloody hell were you thinking?! Did you not learn anything in class?!"
him, causing Neville to choke back a startled laugh as his arms immediately went to wrap around her waist to keep himself steady.
involved, believe me. So if we can just forget about the whole thing, please?" Aria growled, still blushing as she turned back to her plate.
The drawn out syllables left his lips in a way that vaguely reminded Draco of parseltongue, and he couldn't help but smirk at how oddly fitting it was.
"Of course I do." Wood automatically answered, finally turning his attention to Draco and acknowledging him with a nod of his head. "You were the Seeker for Slytherin back when Marcus Flint was Captain, weren't you?"
"They also beat the shit out of Michael, if you must know." Pansy added with a small smirk. "But after that, I told them to let it go. Besides, Michael only showed those pictures to his friends anyway so I figured as long as I keep my head down and make sure to cover all my tracks, my father won't find out."
"You're lucky. Pansy only gave us a 'tour' around our room." Aria quipped wryly, reaching behind her and absentmindedly tugging at a loose lock of hair from the clasp around the tail of her braid.
He noticed the way she bit her lip when she glanced at him, a dismayed frown marring her beautiful face.
He rewarded them with another smile - and this time, everyone saw the unmistakable gleam of the long, sharp fangs where his canines should be.
Ron and Hermione shared a worried look; until Hermione eventually answered her in a carefully restrained voice.
"I don't know." Aria answered quietly, watching as Blaise and Pansy rushed down from their dorms, both still looking a bit bedraggled as they shot each other identical looks of confusion. Wordlessly, they followed Slughorn and the rest of the prefects out of the common room.
Draco pulled the hood of his cloak down, covering his face from view, before slowly making his way towards the crowd.
Aria was beginning to think that the resorting McGonagall had arranged for everyone was a welcome breath of fresh air.
He continued to hug Aria tightly against his chest as he set her back down onto her feet, and when he eventually felt his mother, Andromeda, and even Teddy close in and envelope them both in a warm, tight hug, Draco's eyes stung, and he felt his chest constrict with so much heartfelt emotion that he thought it was going to burst.
happened between me and Bentley Fisher on the night of the Hogwarts Yule Ball — as well as all the events that led up to the incident."
"That's not even the worst part." Hannah's mood grew serious and she lowered her gaze to the floor, shaking her head. "The person who did it, whoever it was, used
"A—and when I confronted him about it, he broke up with me! He actually broke up with me on Christmas, that no good, cheating bastard! I can't believe I ever fell for him—I just...I feel like such an idiot!" She wailed again, pushing past Aria and Pansy as she walked over to her bed and buried her face into her pillows.
When most of the class looked up from their notes with wide eyes, their interest suddenly piqued, Fleur sighed and leaned back against her chair. "The use of the Feather Curse is not punishable by law, nor is it regulated because it is not widely known or understood. But yes, it works pretty much the same way as the Imperius Curse. The only difference is that the Feather Curse only works against unmated veelas, and
Aria would have been amused by how much the school's atmosphere seemed to remind her of her fourth year, had she not been on the receiving end of
"Based on my personal research about what happened, Miss Potter, would this 'someone' you're referring to be former Death Eater and fellow schoolmate of yours, Draco Malfoy? The son of another convicted Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy? Is he the one you were dating?"
"Well, first, it is quite painful. A veela's wings are very sensitive, and to cut them off would be as painful as…pulling out each of your fingernails." She paused when nearly everyone in the classroom cringed at the image. "Also, cutting off our wings will significantly weaken our magic. So, quite understandably, a veela will only consider doing this in the most dire of situations. Like, say, when her intended rejects the mate-bond."
At that, the smirk on Draco's face vanished slowly and he gave the younger Slytherin a worried look. "Corey, you should listen to your sister. You
Her vision blurred with tears of pain and she stumbled to her knees, gasping as the spell ended nearly halfway down her wing before Bentley yanked his wand back up. She winced, feeling dizzy as she felt blood gushing out from below her shoulder and pooling into a small puddle on the marbled floor beneath her skirt. Bentley's eyes widened, gleaming red with hunger as he dipped his finger into the pool of blood and brought it up to his mouth, licking some of her blood off the tip. Then, with a smile, he raised his wand up into the air again and Aria stifled another scream, crawling backwards by her elbows along the blood-stained floor in a feeble attempt to move away from him.
"It wasn't because of some inspiring, altruistic reason like me wanting to save everyone else and make the world a better place." Aria swallowed and gave her a tired, self-depreciating look. "The truth is, I was just so sick and tired of it all."
"You shouldn't scowl like that, Potter. You're scaring the first years." Zach commented with a smirk as they rounded a corner and spotted a few first year students scurrying away from them.
2. I apologise if I offended anyone with that plastic surgery or 'perfected flaws' discussion, I didn't mean anything bad by it, it's purely for entertainment purposes of this story. ;)
"I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question to ask, but did you even bother planning out the logistics of your romantic evening? I mean, you can't exactly bring him back to our dorm room, can you?" She mused, smirking.
"Ow! Hey!" Zach scowled, reaching down and rubbing at the spot where Hannah had kicked him. "Did you seriously just curse at me right now?
"I don't know." She admitted, sighing softly. "I still don't know if I believe in that whole 'mate' thing, to be honest."
Aria sighed again, reaching up to massage her temples in exhaustion. "The whole idea of him finding out
She turned to Draco again, her features softening into another smile as she gently pushed the necklace across the table towards him.
actually, but the harsh, resentful tone of his voice almost made Aria wish for him to go back to ignoring her.
Aria gasped when one of his hands suddenly ran up the back of her thigh and squeezed her ass. Draco smirked at her reaction and tugged on her earlobes with his teeth.
happen anyway? Other than the fact that I attacked you in the Room of Requirement and you responded by saving me from that fiendfyre like the bloody noble hero you are?" Draco retorted snidely.
want to believe he was losing interest already; especially since he didn't even know her bloody name yet.
"Well, anyway, it was good seeing you again, Aria. Let me know if you're ever interested in joining professional quidditch, alright? I'd be more than happy to pull a few strings for you." He mused.
"…It's good to see you again." Draco finally got out once he managed to untwist his tongue, fuming inwardly at himself for displaying the kind of embarrassing ineloquence that, no doubt, would have had not only his father, but
He stared back calmly at her, the expression on his face a perfectly composed mask. In fact, Draco looked so completely unruffled by Skeeter's presence that Aria backed off, somewhat assured that Draco knew perfectly well how to handle himself. Unfortunately, Skeeter took them all by surprise when she suddenly squealed and swooped down on Neville, causing him to cringe and hastily step away.
about what anyone else thinks or whether I deserve you or not—" He continued speaking in a low voice, using his free hand to yank the hideous glasses off her face so he could gaze directly into those beautiful green eyes. The fingers he had intertwined with hers tightened firmly and Aria gave out another gasp, shaking her head as she made a pitiful attempt to yank her hand away.
As the Hogwarts Express began pulling slowly out of the platform, he watched with a scowl as several squealing witches and wizards began chasing after the train, waving frantically at them and screaming Aria Potter's name. They continued to chase after the train all the way until it finally left Kings Cross Station, their frenzied cheers and fanatical screams echoing even through the train's glass windows.
you get the guy, Potter?" He asked again, and for a moment, Aria forgot her anger when she saw the wounded look in his expression for the first time. "What do you do if the poor sod actually wants something more from you? Do you just tuck tail and run away?"
"It's nice to know I've been reduced to a source of entertainment for your boring life, Zabini." She drawled sarcastically, sneering at him.
"You forgot about how there'll probably be hundreds of mindless blokes hounding you, offering themselves to become the mate of the girl-who-lived." Blaise acquiesced with a snicker.
When she heard the Gryffindor side of the classroom groaning loudly in disappointment, Aria's eyes narrowed and she flicked her gaze to the back of the room, glaring halfheartedly at Ron. Her best friend just gave her a sheepish grimace and pointed frantically to a grinning, completely unrepentant Seamus Finnigan sitting beside him.
"It's not that it bothers me, it's just that it's not exactly a story I find particularly pleasant." Blaise shrugged and made another dismissive gesture with his hand. When he noticed the somber expression that continued to linger on Aria's face, however, he chuckled softly and reached over, gently ruffling the top of her hair.
idea how much the Daily Prophet will be all over my ass when they find out about this?! Not to mention how those bureaucratic assholes in the Ministry will probably force me to publicly declare and register my status – which of course, will make the entire issue blow up even more. I've spent all summer trying to get under the press' radar so I'd rather not deal with all of that, thank you very much." She growled.
"Excuse me?!" Skeeter scoffed, rolling her eyes and trying to yank her arm out of Aria's grasp. "I am obligated to do no such thing! Now let go of me—"
He winced again when he heard Hermione's horrified gasp but he continued, careful not to meet his girlfriend's glare. "—thankfully, Malfoy was able to catch her before she hit the ground." He shrugged, looking up and giving Hermione a contrite smile.
"I'll have you know that those robes are made out of the finest material because they were specifically designed and tailored for me! And not that it's any of your business, but those robes were hand washed, starched, dry-cleaned, and ironed by my family's house-elves
"Everyone, let's all give a warm round of applause to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley." Aria added, smiling before she began clapping her hands.
"Well, you're in luck, Potter." Draco gave her a haughty smile and spoke up in a deliberately arrogant voice to lighten the mood. "Architecture happens to be a particular hobby of mine, so I can help you assess if your flat is ready." He drawled.
"Really? I hadn't noticed." Aria retorted sarcastically, rolling her eyes before collapsing back against the pillows in exhaustion. "At least it doesn't seem to hurt as badly when my wings are fully extended like this." She admitted.
"Aria!" Ginny Weasley cried out as she reached them, a look of shock and worry etched clearly all over her face. "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry! I didn't realize you were injured, I wouldn't have caught the snitch if I did! I'm so sorry—"
I can't predict how he's going to react. He might even think that I expect him to reciprocate the whole 'compatible mate' thing because he's indebted to me after I saved him from Azkaban."
Since Greg appeared to already be in the middle of putting away his things, he just gave her a thumbs-up and quick nod in reply. With a sigh, Aria took their vials and, after submitting them to Slughorn at the front of the room, she signed their names on the completion sheet and began making her way back to their table.
"Seven would be perfect. I'll wait for you outside your Common Room." Draco answered, struggling to keep from flinching when he felt Pansy kicking his shin under the table.
About ten minutes later, Neville finally stopped and suddenly passed out in exhaustion, slumping uselessly against Aria. When Aria grunted and nearly buckled under his weight, Draco rolled his eyes. Reluctantly, he crouched down, helping her pick Neville's limp form off the ground by making sure one of his arms slung over Aria's shoulder and the other slung over Draco's.
learn from the Prophet that Bentley Fisher was still locked up in the Ministry; and that the Aurors in charge of him were still waiting for Aria's statement before they decide on what formal charges will officially be filed against him. Draco also learned that the Department of Veela Affairs would be holding a public press conference to deliver Aria's statement sometime that week, though no specific details as to the time and place of the event was actually given.
"If I wanted to, with enough control and practice, I can actually channel it and concentrate all of it onto a single target." She smirked at the way his eyes widened in alarm and leaned in closer, her fingers slowly crawling their way towards his left hand. "Shall I show you?"
"Oh don't even bother trying to hide it, Draco." Pansy muttered under her breath, rolling her eyes at him and looking away with a huff. "Blaise told me all about how you and Potter decided to be all 'chummy' with each other after quidditch practice last week. Congratulations, by the way." She mocked.
Just as they reached the middle of the room, they were forced to stop when they inadvertently ended up running into Neville and Pansy. The other couple had been making their way towards them from the other side of the Chamber.
Smirking to himself, Draco was already making his way towards her when, to his annoyance, Hannah suddenly grabbed Aria by the wrist and whisked her off to the opposite side of the room. He was just deciding on whether or not he should even attempt to go after them when Neville suddenly appeared beside him, drawing his attention by nudging him lightly on the shoulder.
Aria melted against his touch for a while and pressed herself eagerly against him, desperate for more, before she suddenly realized exactly what he said. She forced herself to snap to her senses and hastily pushed his hand out of her skirt.
"I see." Aria seemed to find his answer amusing because she laughed again and shook her head, a small, knowing smile lingering on her lips. "What an utterly predictable answer, Malfoy."
Without his permission, his eyes dropped down to Aria's lips once more, staring hungrily at them before he licked his own and hurriedly tore his gaze away, his heart racing as he tried to take several sharp, shaky intakes of breath to calm himself down.
Draco arched an eyebrow at the way Zach's shoulders flinched upon hearing his name and he began scuffling his feet nervously along the grass.
By some stroke of luck (or fate, as Aria knew Draco and the rest of her teammates would have preferred to believe), Slytherin actually made a complete turn-around during the latter half of the match.
Bloody woman—urgh." Blaise glared at her from the corner of his eye, ignoring the way Draco was shaking his head at their antics. "Anyway, as I was saying, our very own celebrity, Aria Potter, will be our new seeker this year. Aria, meet the boys."
"Estelle's right, you know. I'm thinking even big celebrities like Harriah Potter have a time limit. You take too long and she just might decide not to wait anymore. I should know. My wife almost left me because I took too long to propose to her." He told him, nodding solemnly.
She stiffened in surprise at his use of her first name and reluctantly lifted her gaze to meet his. He hesitated, nervously running a hand through his disheveled blond hair before he finally let out a frustrated sigh and began to speak.
"Hannah, do you want to know the truth?" Neville suddenly spoke up in a firm, reassuring tone of voice, drawing everyone's attention to him. "Being 'sexy' has nothing to do with your appearance or how much skin you show. The truth is, if you really want Ernie to notice you more, you just have to be yourself around him. Sexiness is not just about physical attractiveness." He explained.
"You don't know half of it." Draco snorted at her words and began scanning through the list of patients that Estelle had given him. "If we didn't live together, I doubt I'd be able to see her during the weekdays with all the missions she's been assigned lately. She's the 'darling' of the Ministry right now."
A harsh, irritated voice suddenly spoke up, causing all three Slytherins to pause in the middle of their conversation and look up to see Parkinson standing behind Blaise and glaring impatiently at his back. Malfoy was standing beside her, though unlike Parkinson, he looked more surprised than irritated to see Blaise interacting so casually with Aria and Neville.
"This is such a beautiful venue." Hannah said dreamily, turning to Theo as everyone around the table sat back down into their seats. "I'm tempted to hold our own wedding in a place like this. What do you think?"
She was the bloody Chosen One, the vanquisher of the Dark Lord, and possibly one of the most powerful witches in their generation. Without even trying, she drew attention to herself everywhere she went.
"—is that vampires can easily blend into society without causing trouble. Whereas veelas, because of their sexual...
"Of course. I'll go now. Have a good night." He gave her another wide, lovesick smile before he finally took off and reclaimed his seat with a few other Gryffindors at the very end of the table.
the perfect, rosy little picture that all those stupid magazines make it out to be, you know. You, and a lot of other people, may think I'm living some kind of dream because I'm the 'Chosen One' and because I defeated the Dark Lord but the truth is, I had to go through absolute
"I…kind of have a busy year ahead of me. I don't think I'll have the time to meet you with you again in awhile. My life is a mess right now, I think I need to fix that first." She whispered.
Draco barely noticed that he was breathing very hard; in short, shallow pants. Though if it was because of her closeness or because of all the adrenaline still pumping through his veins, he wasn't sure.
The disgust he heard in Pansy's voice broke Draco out of his thoughts as he flinched and immediately turned away so she wouldn't see the pink splotches on his face.
"Since we're all technically of legal age now, we don't actually need to wait for Hogsmeade weekends or ask permission from the Headmistress anymore to go out of the castle. There's this nice, cozy little pub that Draco and I really like, and I figured tomorrow would be a good opportunity to get to know everyone. And perhaps get everyone drunk, maybe get some good blackmail material early this year." He mused.
we'll still sit with you at the Gryffindor table tonight—" She noticed the way Ron's face lit up at her words but before he could react, she went on in a firm voice. "—but starting tomorrow, we
"Malfoy." Bentley's eyes narrowed, and the adoring smile on his face quickly transformed into a cold, vicious glare. "At least tell me it's not
"I wouldn't worry so much about that." Emma cajoled lightly as she walked past him on her way to her first patient. "We've all seen how hard you've worked and studied in between your shifts these last two years, so we're absolutely sure you passed."
"No, actually—" Aria hesitated, her eyes wide with uncertainty as she flicked her gaze back and forth between Draco and Firenze. "—um, we're
not the one who's getting worked up over a stupid chair, Malfoy." She grinned widely at him, crossing her arms over her chest and purposely leaning back to recline obnoxiously on the armchair's backrest.
Her back was turned to him and she was talking animatedly with Hannah, so she didn't notice him at first, but when Draco cleared his throat and both women spun around to face him, Aria's features immediately lit up into a smile.
She paused and waited until the murmurs and whispers that rippled through the crowd died down before she spoke again.
He frowned disapprovingly at Draco over Aria's shoulder, causing the blond to scowl back at him and hide his face behind his textbook. "I need to go back to the dorms anyway and fetch a notebook I left in my trunk." Neville added with a nonchalant shrug.
"There is no fixed age for when a veela first manifests. It has happened for women at many different ages and is completely random. I, myself, manifested at the age of 16. My grandmother, at age 13. My younger sister, Gabrielle, has yet to manifest - though we are still uncertain if she is a veela or not. Only time will tell." She added with a delicate shrug of her shoulder.
A soft hoot caught his attention and Draco noticed that the owl that had delivered the letter was still waiting on the table in front of him.
“Hello Luna,” he spoke quietly at the sleeping girl. He felt the familiar feeling of guilt wash over him when he looked at her. Her face was dirty, her clothes hung off her bones. It was a sight that should never have existed in the first place.
Draco gulped. He knew he was being ridiculous. He knew that Theo wasn’t someone that he truly deserved. Theo was loving and kind. Draco was cruel and cold. He didn’t deserve Theo; he wasn’t even one hundred percent sure if he truly wanted Theo.
Slowly, Potter looked up at Draco. Vulnerable grey met emotion filled blue. With a deep breath, Draco pulled up his sleeve to reveal his mistake. “
Mr Weasley had given him a strong pat on the back, whilst thanking him for being there for Harry and his son.
Draco crossed his arms firmly across his chest, shaking his head stubbornly. “I will do no such thing.” He bit out, over his cold dead body.
He smiled, this was going to be fun. “Well, I could never do it. Mercilessly murder those chickens. Spend years upon years with mud up to my eyeballs. Don’t even get me started on the sweaty factories, the time and effort just to check one chicken. And all for minimal pay.” Draco droned; he was lying through his pert arse of course.
Weasley sighed in defeat. “I don’t know how you’ve done it. But you’re his rock, and I suspect he’s yours.” He said. “Blimey! You knows there’s something wrong when Draco sodding Malfoy becomes Harry Potter’s rock.” He joked and Draco chuckled.
Oh he hated her. How he hated her! He'd never liked the Weaselette, he'd always seen her as something close to a bully. And not like Draco had been, no, she was worse.
Draco chuckled. “That may be true for eighty-seven percent of the time. But it’s not right now.” he stated. “Well, not really.” He admitted.
In one quick motion, he rounded on Piggy. “What in Merlin’s name do you think you’re playing at?” he seethed, red faced with anger. “You could have been killed! No, you
A pain fiercer than he had ever known ripped through him, as he fell to the ground, withering in pure agony. It was as if millions of hard electric impulses were flowing through him. It hurt. Merlin, it hurt. Tears were streaming down his face; his heart was beating erratically.
is it to send an owl Draco Malfoy? Or even reply to one of my owls?” He opened his mouth to speak but she silenced him with a wave of her hand, “and don’t give me some rubbish excuse about how I could’ve come to the manor. Your wards wouldn’t let me in.” she pointed out.
He sat down next to Luna. She gave him a searching look, “it’s not your fault, Draco.” She said with assertion.
Draco rolled his eyes trying to put up a brave front. “That cabinet is nearly impossible to fix, and do you know how bloody hard it is to kill one of the supposed greatest wizards of all time.” he supplied almost truthfully.
As he reached the manor doors, he gave himself a reassuring smile as he opened them with determination. His breath hitched with pure surprise; the doors opened to reveal no other than Harry Potter.
Dark Lord to come and kill the Headmaster his damn self instead of leaving it up to a sixteen-year-old boy.” He spat out.
Both Weasley and Hermione gave him pleading looks. “I’m sick of this! I’m sick of everyone interfering, thinking that they know what’s best for me.” He carried on, “well newsflash, none of you bloody well do.” He seethed.
Ah Snape. Severus Snape, the current greasy, haired git that Draco had been trying so desperately hard to avoid. Was Snape blind? Or did he have to charm 'Fuck off Snape!' onto his forehead?
Draco sighed rapidly thinking of a bullshit answer.. “What’s better than having Purebloods follow the Dark Lord?” he mused. “Having Purebloods
He started to formulate his plan quickly in his head. He needed to find eighteen objects, preferably disposable ones. And he needed to find them quickly.
“Draco.” His father hissed and he turned to face him. “Would you care to tell me what exactly overcame Potter and yourself earlier today?” he enquired.
Suddenly, the walls started to shake and Draco turned his neck just in time to see that a mound of rubble was just about to collapse over a Weasley twin.
Draco felt his insides heat up, “You saw me yesterday.” He pointed out rationally, reasoning that maybe they both had a few attachment issues.
She beamed. “Draco. What a pretty name.” she decided, before giving him a concerned look. “Anyways, Draco why are you sad?” she asked, and part of Draco was grateful for her constant interference.
Part of him winced at his words. They were harsh, even for him. But, sadly you could take the boy out of Slytherin but you could
“That’s the point.” His aunt turned to face him, giving him an angry sneer. “What’s wrong little baby Draco?” she cooed. “Come to try and fail saving this mudblood like you failed to save you little Hufflepuff mudblood filth?” She spat and Draco saw red.
Theo huffed. “You’re even defending him!” he pointed out. “Draco Lucius Malfoy defending perfect Potter, how can you defend him, then tell me that things between you two are just platonic?” he almost demanded.
He howled in pain as he reached the lifeless figure, his aunt laughing in glee. “I killed a mudblood. I killed Draco’s likkle mudblood.” She chanted and he saw red.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “They were pesky little creatures, not fit for efficient adolescent stimulation. I was well in my rights to do away with them.” He muttered grumpily.
Severus shrugged giving Draco a demanding glare. “Then why haven’t you fixed the cabinet? Why haven’t you killed the Headmaster?” He asked and Draco frantically searched for an exuse.
He was currently on his way to the potions classroom to meet Weasley. They’d agreed to meet at seven, it was now two minutes past seven.
His father sighed. “That you were confused about your sexuality because of Potter.” He stated as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
Draco turned his attention back onto the Hufflepuff. “Hmm that is a very accurate observation.” He quipped.
Draco didn’t want to think about it. Because deep down he knew that it was true, and if it were, then this was going to become a lot harder than he knew it would be.
The Dark Lord sat on his couches, he ate his food, he breathed the same air as him. Draco wanted to puke; the air was like poison.
Draco started to laugh manically. “My condolences, but I’m afraid I don’t care much as to what you want. I’ve spent sixteen years of my life caring and look where it’s gotten me.” He seethed at his father. “I’ve betrayed those that I care about. I’ve broken relationships that mean much to me. I’ve got the symbol of everything I fight against tattooed on my arm. And that’s all because of you.”
Funnily enough, it wasn’t the whole ‘first-year Hufflepuff's stormed into the potions classroom and hexed the shit out of Smith’ incident that the Headmaster was discipling him about. In fact, he hadn’t even brought it up.
Weasley groaned. “Listen Ferret and listen closely. I don’t like you; I really don’t like you. But I’m willing to work with you because despite what many people might think, I actually care about my grades.”
Draco sighed, folding up the letter and stashing it safely in his pocket. He gently brought the ring that hung silently from it’s chain, into his hands. Squeezing it tight, as if it could leave him at any second.
“War took you from me. And I will spend every moment of the rest of my life resenting it for that.” He took another deep breath, “I was meant to protect you. I promised that I’d keep you safe. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I can’t change the past. I wish more than anything that I could, but I can’t.”
“Wingardium Leviosa!” Draco frantically pointed his wand at the rubble, so that it barely hovered over the Weasley’s head.
Draco?” she asked genuinely completely ignoring Weasley’s cries, to which Draco thought was the funniest thing ever.
His words sent shivers down his spine. Draco knew that he should run. That he should walk away and never look back. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t.
Coward. A word thrown around so lightly, many not truly understanding it's meaning. Potter wasn't a coward. He was far from it. No, he was one of the bravest people that Draco knew.
Draco felt Potter abruptly being pulled off him, his arms replaced with stronger ones. “Foolish boy.” Someone snapped, but Draco was too far gone to even attempt to recognise who it was.
They shook their heads. Draco smirked mischievously, pulling out his wand. “Would you care to find out?” he threatened pointedly.
Although, he had to admit. He'd be an amazing trophy wife. Just gorgeous. The potential. Oh! The potential.
He stopped a few steps in front of the pillar and took a deep breath. “Who’s there?” he asked, embarrassed to find that his voice started to waver.
Potter looked up at him intently, vulnerability lacing his feature. “Then look at me.” He started, and Draco on reflex looked into his eyes. “Look at me and tell me that you don’t have feelings for me. Tell me that you don’t
She narrowed her eyes and growled. “After what you’ve done? Do you mean apologising and making amends with all you’ve wronged. Do you mean helping and loving innocent little Hufflepuff’s who idolise you? Do you mean making portkey’s for all at risk Muggleborn’s as well as
If were all to expose criminals to the same way in which they treated us, then we would be no better than them. Those who were not kissed were forced to spend part or the rest of their lives completely cut off from the world. Wasn’t that punishment enough?
His two best friends sighed. “Fine, it’s much better than attempting the homework that I know we’ll get set. It’s just homework, it doesn’t matter all that much.” Pansy said and Draco felt dread pooling in the pits of his stomach.
He still hated Potter. He hated Potter with his whole being. But after all, you could still hate someone and need them just as much.
Okay, so all the evidence may point towards Draco not always being right. Well he was only human! Or was he? He’d never really figured out if having magic meant that he was less than human. All he knows is that he isn’t as infallible as the Great Merlin. We can’t all be Perfect Potter.
“You don’t have a problem that I’m gay?” he whispered hesitantly. His head was spinning and his face was red as he waited for an answer.
He needed to be alone. He needed to get his emotions in check before attempting to deal with the cabinet again. And he
The little girl said nothing, too weak to move or speak. Draco’s eyes widened, and then it was all moving in slow motion.
So, that's it! 'The Draco Malfoy Incident' is officially over! I just wanted to take the time to thank each and every last of you for your continued support, it allowed me to finish the fic. So, thank you! I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed writing!! :) :) :)
Long story short, Pansy thought it appropriate to scream at him in front of those present in the Slytherin common room. She screeched and clawed like a blooming hyena. He’d seriously feared that the inhumane vibrations she was sporting were going to collapse the dungeons in on them. No kidding. He could swear he saw cracks forming in the edges of the ceiling.
Potter smirked. “We are a bossy bottom today, aren’t we?” he doesn’t give Draco a chance to reply as he kisses a long trail of kisses down his stomach. Wet, long, and desperate. Draco groans as Potter ripped off his bottoms in one quick tug.
Draco focused on keeping his head down, refusing to rise to Weasley’s taunts and jabs. A year ago, he would’ve been more than happy to shoot a few insults right back at Weasley. Hell, he’d probably had been the one to start the insults. But he was different now. Perhaps it was partly because he’d grown up and realised that there were more important things than taunting and bullying your classmates. Mainly, it was because Draco was already a terrible person, he didn’t need to succumb to things that would make him worse.
He huffed, glaring at them in determination. “Did I or did I not wiggle my arse suggestively as an indicator for you all to follow?” he growled out.
Draco had always had a sneaky feeling that the greasy haired git had always been jealous of his dazzling smile. Who wouldn’t be? It was fabulous.
Draco raked a hand through his hair, stopping her from answering. “Because I’ll tell you. It’s really fucking hard.” He spat out with an ounce of hysteria.
Draco crossed his arms stubbornly, “I am not running, nor am I hiding, from any problems.” He told her again, because technically it was true.
Draco’s face lit up with excitement. “Oh, that is my toasterer.” He smiled proudly. “I’m trying to find the bread.” He declared.
There was nothing. He tried to imagine the future that he wanted, but the truth was, he didn’t know what he wanted. He had no idea.
He tried and was very sure failed to mask his confusion, as he secretly told himself to do better at this whole parenting thing. He gave her hands a squeeze, “what does that have to do with it?” he enquired.
She raised a brow, “And why’s that, pretty blonde one?” she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively and Draco paled. He knew that look, he knew it
Blaise shook his head. “Can’t a guy check up on his best friend? Or are you too pretentious, even for little old me?” he joked.
“Draco. Hello— Dracoo. Are. You. Ignoring. Me? Draco. Draco. Draco Lucius Malfoy-Potter, you will answer me and you will answer me now!” A voice bellowed at the other end of Draco’s mobile, and he sighed, pulling the phone abruptly from his ear.
Draco sighed, deciding not to burden Pansy with all that. “I have no fucking idea.” He half-lied, half-admitted.
“Yes, yes. Very interesting.” Weasley cut in, “Now let’s talk about the chicken that I gifted him.” he chirped.
Draco ran faster, quicker than he ever had. The Death Eater readied her stance, readying himself to utter a life ending curse.
Typical. Of course, when he wanted the infuriating bastard to speak, he kept quiet. His father may have changed a considerable amount over the years, but Draco was sad to say that he was still the proud git that he’d always been.
They had been promptly escorted from the courtroom after that. Draco smiled slightly at that; he loved his Hufflepuff’s.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “and what game would that be?” he questioned, he had a sneaky suspicion that they were playing a game right now.
The taunts. The jabs. The sneers and spits. The letter that he wrote to Potter and Potter only. The unyielding faith and hope that he had in him. Draco didn’t know exactly what he felt for Potter, but it was definitely something. He’d be a fool to think otherwise.
“I don’t know Pans,” he admitted, “I thought I needed time to sort out all these crazy feelings I have for Potter. But I’m not so sure anymore. I mean, do you know how hard it is to be in love with someone you can’t remember falling in love with?” he prompted.
Pansy eyed him sceptically. “Are you sure?” she questioned. “Because it always has something to do with Potter.” She said, and that was true in a sense.
She gestured to the badge, “she created a place that anyone could go. Somewhere to be safe. To be free. She believed in tomorrow. And it’s up to us, to carry on the light that her memory and so many others have gifted us with.” She urged them all.
To have ones free will ripped on them. To think that he was free, then be told differently. He didn’t know how to comprehend it.
Kat sighed. “That’s a shame. I hope that when you get a new one, you’ll be able to draw something happy.” and he thought about telling her that was unlikely, but decided against it.
It felt nice, safe, to have another person hold you. A person that you trusted, that you loved. So Draco let it out, he let it
Where the hell was the devil? Ha. Excuse the pun. Why was hell so dark? Where was the flames, the fire, the dragons? Why weren’t there any dragons? Draco wanted dragons. Was that too much to ask for?
you, you insufferable woman." Neville cut her off with another laugh, shaking his head in amusement when Pansy's eyes suddenly widened and she gaped at him, her pale cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He smirked at her reaction, clearly enjoying the flabbergasted look on her face.
He couldn't help but revel at how it was so much easier to do this now; especially because the tingling waves of pleasure she was subconsciously sending him through their mate bond basically instructed Draco exactly where and how to kiss, bite, and suck so that he gave her the most amount of satisfaction; and soon enough, Aria was reduced to a sobbing, moaning mess beneath him.
"I see." The look on Aria's face was strange as she stared intently at the ring, green eyes narrowed slightly in contemplation. "Is that your family's insignia?" She asked again.
"Don't try to turn this around and blame me! I didn't do anything wrong! I mean, what did you expect me to do back there?" He cut her off with an angry, exasperated sigh.
At her words, the excitement on Corey's face immediately died down and he scowled, looking up to give Pansy an annoyed look. "Well, not just this year to be honest." He admitted begrudgingly, scuffling his shoes along the floor. "I've
, regarding the other Slytherins who were implicated in all this, I'm afraid that amending the circumstances of their cases is outside my authority. If you really want to help them, you'll have to meet with me tomorrow afternoon and convince the school board
He declared loudly with a firm shake of his head before he turned back to watching the flying Gryffindors through the window.
Shoving the smaller boy off, Draco cast a worried look over at her, noting the way she began fidgeting nervously with her hair and the way she blanched when she realized that the long black locks had come loose from her hairtie. It was actually the first time Draco saw her without her braid, and the first time he noticed that Aria's hair was actually much,
Blaise held up his wand and cast a protego over himself just before Fisher flung a hex at him. The spell shattered Blaise's shield, but before Blaise could retaliate, Fisher disappeared again and this time, he reappeared directly behind Pansy.
In the week that followed, Headmistress McGonagall ordered an immediate investigation, as well as disciplinary action, against the perpetrators responsible for creating the terrible mess in the Great Hall.
"Hey Draco, do you mind helping me hang this banner up along the walls over there?" Neville asked, holding one end of the long, glittery banner in his hands out to Draco.
reach back and take his hand in hers, interlacing their fingers together and giving his a comforting squeeze.
A few hours later into their task, just as Aria and Pansy were about to finish cleaning their last classroom for the evening, Aria was taken back when Pansy broke the comfortable silence by speaking up in a soft, uncharacteristically vulnerable voice.
"Why are you two just standing around here and talking?" Blaise smirked when Draco just growled at him and finally managed to shrug his arm off. "It's a party, for crying out loud. You should be drinking and dancing."
4. To those asking, I don't actually have an update schedule for this story, though I do try to update at least once a week or every two weeks. The reason updates were so fast before was because chapters 1-9 were all pre-written. This last update took longer because I had to write this chapter from scratch. ;)
More groans were heard as Fleur chuckled and settled herself onto the chair behind the teacher's desk situated at the front of the room. She and McGonagall shared one last nod before the Headmistress walked briskly out of the classroom, the heels of her boots fading as she disappeared down the corridor.
In all those times, they had barely acknowledged each other with anything other than an awkward nod and grimace – an awkward grimace on Potter's part and a nod on his.
" Blaise ignored the rest of Malfoy's crude insult and deliberately looked away, turning his attention back to Aria. "Before you arrived, Potter, we were just talking about how everyone's first few weeks in Slytherin were. Remember, I
my pity, you miserable slag!" Aria finally felt her control over her temper snap as she clenched her fists and glared back at Pansy, her eyes suddenly blazing with unkempt anger. "But I wasn't about to sit back and watch an asshole like Corner treat a girl like that – even if that girl was
"No, I was uh…" Potter bit her lip and tugged nervously at the tail-end of her long, black braid. "I was just on my way up to get some fresh air. I like going up there. It's really nice and quiet.".
but yeah, that sounds about right." Neville kidded weakly as he turned around and watched as Blaise Zabini, their new House Prefect, smirked at their expressions and gestured wordlessly for Neville and Zacharias Smith to follow him and Draco Malfoy down the stairs to where the 8th year dormitories were.
For a second, Draco thought that Pansy was actually going to tell Aria off, but when she eventually spoke; the words that came out of her mouth did not at all match the resentful scowl on her face.
Aria spoke in a teasing voice, but there was a strange anxiousness and vulnerability in her expression that Draco recognized — even without having to feel it through their mate bond. And after being together for two years, Draco knew Aria well enough by now that he understood exactly where her fears were coming from.
"Please don't tell anyone else that I'm a veela. Not even the Headmistress." She said softly, struggling not to look away when she saw the surprise on Madam Pomfrey's face. "I know it's not that big of a deal and that it's nothing to be ashamed of but…Since I don't intend to register with the Ministry of Magic anyway, I would really prefer that nobody else find out. It would just draw too much attention to me again." She admitted, lowering her gaze to the bed.
"Don't worry about that. It'll be fine, trust me." Draco shared a quick smirk with Blaise over Aria's shoulder before he reached out and handed her the minuscule golden ball in his hand. "Now, as I said, I reckon it's about time Blaise and I introduce you to your new teammates, Potter."
seem like Potter had gotten taller. Back in their 6th year, Draco remembered that she had been shorter than Granger and Weasley. Now she was taller than Granger, and almost as tall as Weasley was. Her hair had grown longer too, but instead of keeping it loose and messy like she used to when they were younger, it was pulled back and styled into one very tight braid that ended just above her waist.
When she nodded, he grinned and hopped up onto the Comet 260, zooming up into the air with an elated smile on his young face.
Aria flicked her wide eyes over to see Blaise watching her from one of the tall, thick armchairs situated in front of the fireplace. He noticed her startled expression and smirked, walking over to her and plopping down onto the couch beside her.
The expression on Wood's face was tinged with a hint of annoyance as he answered. "Why in Merlin's name would we be terrified of holy water or crosses?"
"How dare you?" Hannah's eyes widened and she glared indignantly at him. "I most certainly did not—"
As the furious scream left her throat, she shoved him away and sat up. She raised a hand as though to slap him — but then she stopped halfway — because he was her mate and she
Aria hesitated again, but as she was trying to think of an answer, the doors to the Headmistress' office suddenly swung open. Glancing over her shoulder, she watched in surprise as Blaise and Pansy both hurried into the room and headed towards them.
A few hours later that night, as Aria was making her way across the castle to start on her assigned chores, she heard a pair of angry voices nearby that made her pause in mid-step. She recognized one of the voices easily as Pansy's, and, when she heard the clear distress in her housemate's voice, she frowned and pressed herself against the wall, peering carefully around the corner into the adjacent hallway.
Draco blinked. Ignoring Pansy’s concerned gaze, he surveyed the array of young faces situated in the Great Hall. Some showed deep traces of fear, others determination, a few dusted with complete boredom. He was disappointed but not the least bit surprised that the bored few were Slytherins, nevertheless. It wasn’t that long ago that he would’ve been one of them. He would have internally laughed at Dumbledore’s words, showing nothing but disinterest. That wasn’t the case anymore. It hadn’t been since the day his existence had been reduced to nothing but a choice.
He absently heard Potter sink down next to him. “Draco!” he screamed, fear lacing his tone. “No. No. No. NO!” he shouted, cradling Draco’s almost limp body in his arms.
Draco sighed; this wasn’t working. “Do you really think that I’d waste my time lying about this?” he tired a different approach, he wasn't a Slytherin for nothing.
He’d realised in that moment how much he loved his best friend, and how much she loved him. It was easier thinking that she’d never deceive her parents in favour of helping him through these difficult times.
Draco sighed, clutching his want tightly from his robe pocket. “Anyways, I need the names, years, houses, and addresses of each last one of them.” He put simply, hoping that they'd agree with no objections.
It had been Potter. It had all been Potter. It had been him the whole time. Caring for him, protecting him, loving him. It was Potter. It had
He reasoned that no one would ever live up to Kat's level. Oh well, what a shame. Kat was going to be single forever. How very, very sad.
“Did you or did you not tell him that you wanted him to take time to think whether he wanted a relationship with the real you?” she had asked, to which Draco had replied with a simple “Yes”.
Blaise smirked, “well, my hair is pretty fabulous.” He said cockily. “There was also that time where you decapitated all of Pansy’s dolls because you thought they were quote on quote ‘blood-thirsty monsters intent on draining ones intelligence and individuality.” He laughed.
“Nothing. Except from the fact that you’re my boyfriend and I care about you. That I want to make you safe and happy. And that it makes me feel genuinely sick, whenever you feel sad… do you want me to continue?” he deadpanned.
“I can’t feel it.” he cried out hysterically, his whole body shaking in pure despair. “I can’t feel it.” he screamed as Weasley but a comforting hand on his shoulder, his own face stained with tears.
He opened his mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off his father’s drawl, “because if you were feeling alright, then you would have no excuse as to why you were associating with mudblood filth.” He angrily spat.
He shot Pansy one last reassuring smile, received a soft squeeze from Blaise and left the dorm in a swirl of robes.
Draco nodded, deciding to let Weasley's last comment slide, before taking a deep breath. “And how’s Potter?” he asked hesitantly.
She smiled. “He was so scared. He ran away like a big fat coward.” She preened and Draco couldn’t help but chuckle.
No! He thought. He didn’t want the blood. He didn’t want to be saved. He wanted this. He needed this. It was perfect. It was poetic. It was his way out. The darkness was his only way out. He would be free. He needed to finally be free.
It was weird, he decided, sitting here with the two of them. It had been months since the three of them had all been together like this, but having them here was something that he hadn't realised he'd needed.
He believed that emotions were just fickle things that one could control. That he could decide how he wanted to feel, and he’d decided to feel nothing.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t care. I still have to stir the potion, whether he shows up or not.” He snapped, before stomping out of the common room.
“Holy fuck,” he gasps out as Potter pushes gently inside, his tongue still lapping the head of Draco’s erection. He pushes in further and Draco clenches around his thick, long finger.
His hot tears were sticky against his skin. He just wanted it all to be over. He just wanted it all to turn out to be a terrible, terrible nightmare.
His father visibly paled. “Draco.” He hissed almost pleadingly. “He could be listening, you insolent child. Do you want to die?”
What if she agreed with him and renounced the Dark Lord? Draco had to carry out his tasks, he had to play the part. If he didn’t, he’d have his parents deaths on his hands. Pansy didn’t have such a burden. If she wanted to renounce him, then she could really do it. And then what? She had no one to go to, nowhere to run. She’d be dead in a matter of days.
“And Potter” he started again, “I don’t know how to feel towards him.” he admitted, and he felt his head start to spin.
Draco nodded acceptingly. He supposed that made sense. It didn’t explain his recent split behaviour though. One minute he spoke to Draco as if they were friends of sorts, the next he glared at him as if they were mortal enemies. It hurt Draco more than he’d ever care to admit. It also confused him greatly, and he suspected that even the likes of Granger didn’t have the answers to that particular question.
Potter chuckled. “Shower sex.” he smirked mischievously, a suggestive glint residing in his velvet eyes, That
Draco brought an embarrassed hand to his face as his father continued. “And whilst I may appreciate your quidditch opinions, I do
Draco tried not to snort in disbelief. He knew better than to trust in fickle things like feelings. They only caused upset and heartbreak. Nothing more, nothing less.
A soft pulsing was vibrating gently on his chest. He looked down, picking up the ring that hung silently from it’s chain. It eloped him in it’s warmth, it’s protection thrumming through him.
Weasley huffed, crossing his arms firmly.. “We still should have never gotten involved in the first place.” He admitted. “Whatever is going on between the both of you is absolutely mad.” he huffed out and Draco couldn't help but agree.
Draco breathed in a sharp, terrified breath. The Dark Lord was smirking at him, his arms opening in welcome. He was preaching about forgiveness, how the death of Harry Potter had guaranteed the survival of Draco. How Potter had died so that Draco could live.
that. He even could have that with Potter. If he’d just allow himself to take the great leap of faith, instead of carrying on like a coward. Maybe, just maybe if he allowed himself, he’d have a chance at something real.
“Well, MAYBE if you let me talk once in a while, then FUCKING MAYBE, I’ll be able to answer your questions.” Draco spat angrily and the boy started to quiver.
He missed Draco. He missed him so goddamn much. It was as if someone had taken away the piece that made him whole. The most important part of him.
Begrudgingly, he walked towards the floo, where his father’s face was impatiently staring back at him. His father looked good considering. Except from a few dark circles that hung from under his eyes, he still looked as proud and healthy as Draco had ever seen him.
“Dark forces attempt to penetrate this castles walls. But in the end, their greatest weapon… is you.” The old crow concluded, and Draco looked up, straight into the burning green eyes of
Draco nodded. “Wouldn’t dream of venturing over to your domain, on the odd chance I’d catch something.” He spat.
“That may be the case for some Slytherins.” He started “but I happen to think that Hufflepuff is one of the most loyal and dearest houses.” He was lying through his pure white teeth, of course. But he found himself wanting to say anything to make her feel safe.
Hating someone because you felt you had to, hating them and not knowing why, was something Draco was far too acquittanced with. After all, he'd been doing it for most of his life.
But they’d treated him like crap, and that had made him determined not to turn out like them. Did he condone their actions? Fuck no. But did they help him become the person that he was today? Absolutely.
His father chuckled. “And I’m the king of England.” Draco wanted to point out that his father indeed had royal blood but decided against it.
, we wouldn’t have known to follow you without it.” she mused. “And your arse wiggle made it look so perky" she admired, and in that moment he was reminded why he loved her so much.
“Trust me, you’ve changed, you’re different. I’m just not sure of what kind of change yet.” she said honestly and Draco’s face fell.
Draco couldn’t look. It had been four months since their first encounter at the lake. Four months of meeting up every single night. Four months of Harry talking and Draco listening. Four months of him sharing his deepest fears and happiest thoughts. Four months of handholding and watching the sunrise.
“Draco… years ago I knew a boy, who made all the wrong choices. Please let me help you.” He pleaded. Draco scoffed.
Draco didn't like him one bit. The idea that this guy knew when you were sleeping and knew when you were awake. And not to mention the fact that he knew where all the children of the world lived. It had to be the creepiest thing he'd ever heard.
He realised that right now Wizarding society was broken. People had lost family, friends, themselves. But, it would heal. They would all heal. They’d already begun healing. The smiles dusting many of the students faces proved that.
Blaise’s eyes softened slightly, taking in the distressed state of his best friend. “Fine.” He held up his hands in surrender, “but I’d give him a chance if I were you, he really likes you.” he attempted to be convincing.
They’d kept in contact with Ms Pritchett over the years. She was Kat’s godmother. She had become a part of their little family. It had taken some time, but Draco could finally look at her without being riddled with guilt. It hadn’t been his fault. He knew that now.
“You’re coming to the end of your book.” She carried on, gesturing to his nearly empty sketchbook. “Are you going to get a new one?”
Jerry huffed. “And what does that have to do with anything?” he bit out and Draco wanted to hex him.
“You really are a naïve child. What do you think the Dark Lord would say to that? You’re ever so lucky that your aunt is keeping the little event that happened at the Manor a few days ago to herself.”
He howled, feeling all the strength slowly leaving his body. He was cut, torn, bruised. He couldn’t breathe. The pain was far too much to bare.
He was currently sitting on his ’throne’, visibly shaking. Potter’s outburst a few moments ago was unexpected and had completely rattled him. He didn’t know what to say or do. It was too much. It was all too much.
He returned Draco’s nod, “it’s nice to see that you’ve finally decided to pay your father a visit, son.” He said, trying and failing to hide his glee.
He needed a moment. Draco blinked a few times. Was his hearing staring to deteriorate? “I’m sorry, what?” he asked in pure disbelief.
It also didn’t help all that much that Draco kind of liked Potter’s stalking. It was pathetic. No, he was pathetic. He couldn’t help it. Potter’s stalking made him feel wanted. Less alone. As if Potter actually cared about him.
With a deep breath, Draco walked out of the common room and to the only place where he felt truly free.
Draco grinned. “But it isn’t Christmas yet.” He pointed out, trying and failing to mask his excitement.
He missed Hermione and although he would never admit it to him, he even missed Weasley. They had become good friends of his, friends he’d cherished and adored. Not that they’d ever look at him now. Not after what he’d done.
Harry sighed as he threaded his finger through the ring that he kept so close. Through teary eyes, he looked back into the nights sky. He knew his parents were up there watching over him, and deep down he knew they were doing the same
He said the only thing that he could. “I’m sorry.” Draco choked out. “I’m so, so sorry.” He put his head in his hands, shaking with sobs. Shame rushing though him, making him dizzy.
Potter nodded before pushing inside of him so carefully, patiently, as if he were scared he was going to break. It hurts mainly because it’s his first time but knowing that Potter was inside of him. That Potter wanted him, was worth it.
Draco looked down at his feet avoiding Potter’s gaze. His heart was beating rapidly within his chest. He was confused. He could understand why Potter was acting like this. What did he want with him?
He took a deep breath, “she’s as well as she can be.” He answered shortly, taking in the concern on his aunt’s features. He decided to take a risk, “I know that mother would love to see you, if you ever get the chance.” He offered.
Kat put a small hand onto his and squeezed, “I know you’re lying” she started knowingly, “but that’s okay. We all get sad sometimes, but all we need is someone with a bright smile to remind us that we’re not alone.”
Draco’s features softened because he’d never thought about it like that. “That’s true. But doesn’t the things people say about you hurt?” he questioned intently.
Confused, Draco abruptly pulled away from Potter. “What the hell do you think you’re playing at?” he spat at a dazed Potter.
She stared at him with pure disbelief before running out of the Slytherin common room and into her dorm.
Bellatrix smiled viciously before dropping Kat’s broken body to the floor. It falling with a tortured
He tilted his head slightly, darting his eyes to the side as if in search for something. “I’ve nearly got it. Almost, there… Nope. Still nothing.” He shrugged.
“I don’t know Harry. I really don’t know.” She whispered as she started to pull Harry away both her and Weasley shooting Draco and apologetic glance before leaving.
Plus, Draco couldn't bare to think what would happened if the Dark Lord ever found out. No, he had to keep it a secret.
“So tight.” Potter gasps out as he takes hold of Draco’s wrists, pinning them above his head, as he presses into him with small, soft strokes.
“Fuck, Draco…” He kisses the line of his jaw, working down slowly towards the nape of his neck. “Is this okay?” Potter asked in between kisses and Draco nodded, pulling Potter closer. His hand slipped under his shirt, his fingers possessive and full of wanting as they slide over his skin.
“I think you’re brave.” A second girl pointed out and Draco blinked at her. “To love someone besides their faults is very courageous.” She said dreamily.
It was quite funny actually. So, after a few days of Hufflepuff's following his every move, it was hard for a man not to get attached. So, now you could say that Draco had adopted them. And he was most definitely better for it.
A gasp! That was a good sign. He took this as confirmation to carry on. “How do you truly know what good and bad really is. What if there’s no good or bad? What if there’s only grey?” he asked.
Red hot rears were streaming uncontrollably down his cheeks. He didn’t dare look back, because if he did it would all be over. He’d run straight back into Potter’s arms, the place where he felt safest in the world.
He was not going to stand for this pure disrespect. No one insulted Draco Malfoy and got away with it. Well, unless you were Potter...
Scared of him! Well, he had to admit, that brought a smile to his face. He quite liked the idea of being intimidating.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, “I’ll show you extreme measures.” He threatened, picking up a pair of scissors waving them around frantically.
“Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she’d bare a cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of Meade with one laced with poison?” he said and Draco froze.
Would he just stop intruding? Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “It doesn’t matter if it was nothing or if it wasn’t. I don’t see how any of it is your business.” He quipped.
He pulled away from Pansy to face the worried stance of Blaise. “Are you okay?” he asked hesitantly.
That sounded like a good plan Draco decided, before he spun on his heel and got the hell out of there.
His relationship with Potter had been going from strength to strength, and it were those moments spent with him, that Draco felt happiest.
Weasley nodded. “Fair enough.” He shuffled slightly in his seat. “If anything, though it’s Mione and me who should be apologising.” He said honestly.
Where were they? Where were they? He absently thought as Draco grabbed hold of a velvet green coloured box. Found them.
He felt his eyes starting to close, his breaths becoming shallower. Myrtle’s screams and Potter’s cries could be heard echoing throughout the room. But Draco didn’t have the energy to try and even care. As he descended into darkness, he felt his blood slowly trickle back into his body.
"What are you two still doing out here?" He growled, practically the hissing the words out in his anger. "Shouldn't you be scurrying yourselves back to the castle, Gryffindorks?"
"Bullshit! Stop lying to me!" Pansy slapped him, cutting him off, and as she spat the words out, Aria heard the unmistakeable way her voice began to break. "If you cared about me, you wouldn't have spread all those ugly rumors about me! You wouldn't have taken those pictures behind my back and showed them to all your disgusting friends! You ruined me, Michael!" She cried.
The sharp intonation of Pansy's voice finally broke Draco from his trance. He flinched in surprise and blinked up at them, staring at both Slytherins as though he had only just realized they were there.
"No!" Pansy blurted out, looking exasperated as she shoved the smaller girl away and turned back to her breakfast.
"Well, nothing terrible. He just went on and on about how his father didn't donate so much money to the Hogwarts board of directors for them to force him to associate with Slytherin scum." He winced at the memory, shaking his head.
Before either of them could say anything else, their orders arrived and Draco breathed a sigh of relief as he welcomed the interruption. Fortunately, they were able to make their way through dinner while engaged in significantly lighter conversation. After some time, once their plates were cleared away and their wine glasses refilled, she turned to him again and gave him a reassuring smile.
bother him, however, was the fact that everyone seemed to look at him as though he was some crazed murderer who was likely to just randomly cast the killing curse on someone on the street without so much as batting an eyelash.
Suddenly, the door swung open, and everyone looked up to watch as a tall, incredibly beautiful woman in a stylish white blazer and perfectly fitted tan pants stepped purposefully into the small room. She was smirking as she strode over towards them, but it was only when she stopped by the foot of Aria's bed that Aria noticed her appearance.
As it is obviously smut, I decided it post it separately instead so as to preserve the mood and Teen rating of this story. Since it’s not relevant to the plot, it’s entirely your choice if you want to read it or not. :D
were the one who never wanted to play with us back then! We knew nothing about you!" Pansy shot back, her eyes wide and her cheeks flushed with horrified realization.
When he saw the curious smile she gave him at this words, Draco flushed slightly but decided to explain himself. "My mother is…well, she's quite beautiful too, you see. And I've always hated the way men hit on her all the time – even in front of me." He admitted grudgingly, still blushing. "It's a shame how there are only a few men out there who really know how to act properly around beautiful women."
Morag just smirked at them and acknowledged Blaise's comment with an obnoxiously smug look before turning back to the thick textbook in her lap.
As soon as the conference was over, she rushed toward him, shoving through the crowd of persistent reporters that blocked her way. When she finally caught up to him, just as he reached the middle of the atrium lobby, Aria spoke.
At the look of utter incredulity on Neville's face and the way Ron looked as though he was ready to burst into tears, Aria couldn't help it anymore. The whole situation was beginning to feel more and more ridiculous by the second and before she could stop herself, a snort of poorly muffled laughter escaped her lips.
When her brain finally caught up with the situation, Aria mirrored the embarrassed grimace on Pansy's face.
There was another long moment of silence that followed, and Aria frantically wracked her brain for something else to talk about so she could keep the conversation going. She eventually gave up and looked away, lowering her gaze to the floor.
so she wrapped her wings protectively over herself instead. Behind her, Draco wrenched himself out of his coat and draped it over her head to cover her face.
Instead of answering, Draco glanced at Aria again but this time, he looked directly into her eyes, silently
And it wasn't a situation he intended to remedy anytime soon; at least not until he was able to look back on all of the horrors he experienced as a Death Eater without feeling a surge of bitterness toward the man.
So a few days after his trial, he moved out of the manor and decided to purchase a private flat for himself in London a few blocks away from Diagon Alley. He had spent his last few weeks before school there, mostly by himself, and had only gone back to the manor to visit his parents whenever his mother owled him to visit.
Without any hesitation, she nodded slowly and closed her own eyes, taking a deep inhale of breath to ready herself for what was going to happen. Draco kissed her again, pulling her closer against him.
Yes, I know you're all very eager to get to the Yule Ball but unfortunately, there's one more chapter we have to get through before that. Please be patient, the Yule Ball is sort of the 'culminating' chapter of this story, so obviously, there are some things I need to wrap up before I can get to it. Besides, there are 5 chapters left to this story anyway (excluding the Epilogue) ;)
Madam Pomfrey was strangely silent, and when Aria reluctantly looked up to meet her eyes again, she realized that the older woman had simply tutted at her before resuming her task of disinfecting the wounds along Aria's left wing.
"So does that mean that for me to score a hot veela girlfriend, I just have to smell good and she has to like touching me?" He asked loudly, causing another chorus of amused snorts and rambunctious laughter to erupt from his classmates.
next. Minimum of three feet of parchment. You will also be meeting with a new guest lecturer, as I understand."
year here at Hogwarts without seeing you in the hospital wing, I swear." She let her voice trail off and sighed in exasperation.
"Wait a minute." Draco froze and he turned to glare suspiciously at Neville, belatedly realizing that he hadn't even reacted to something else Draco had mentioned when he and Blaise had been talking. "Longbottom, did you actually already know that Potter's—"
"And you know what's worse? Now, I don't even have a date to the Yule Ball. And Ernie will be there, all happy and slow dancing with that blonde bint. It'll be so humiliating." She grumbled, grabbing one of her pillows and hugging it tightly to her chest in comfort.
"Did you tell anyone else?" Aria pressed him further, panicking slightly when she saw the mischievous gleam in his eyes.
When Draco reddened and tried to hide his embarrassment with a haughty glare, Aria laughed and gave him a kiss on the cheek.
"I think you've been hanging around all those Slytherins too much." Ron added with a snort, shaking his head when Aria snickered at their reaction.
"It's two miles away, Potter!" He blurted out, glaring at her as though she was crazy. "It'll take us more than an hour to get there! Couldn't we just apparate or use the floo or something?"
"Shouldn't you be celebrating with the Gryffindors? You guys did win after all." Aria joked, trying to divert Ron's attention from her injury but his eyes just narrowed at her in warning.
exactly. Because it's cold." Aria agreed, glancing pleadingly over Luna's shoulder at Ron and Hermione, trying to get them to change the subject.
"—Instructor." Aria rolled her eyes in exasperation but she didn't protest when Fleur giggled and took her by the arm, pulling her towards a private nook in the corner of the classroom.
