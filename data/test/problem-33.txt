His nostrils were flared and his knuckles had turned white from gripping the mug so tightly but Harry was not about to back down. He did have a few inklings of distaste for Malfoy, even though he had thought he had gotten over his hatred. Part of him needed to vent his anger out as the arguments he was having with Ron and Hermione were just too much to bear.
Harry suddenly felt rather silly, as he wasn’t prepared to answer any questions asked. He looked at Draco sheepishly, and back at Murphy, unsure of what to say. He must have been silent for a while because Murphy was starting to get a little impatient, judging by the way he tapped his shoes on the ground. There was no way of escaping his question so he might as well answer the boy. He also felt somewhat obliged to do so, since Arnold was a good lad and Murphy seemed like one too. He leaned over, whispering into his ear.
Malfoy hastily pushed himself off Harry’s chest as soon as Flitwick’s door unlocked itself with a click as if sensing the two boys standing outside. “Come in!” Flitwick chimed.
But that was a long time ago, and they’ve all changed immensely since, forced to grow up faster because of The War. Once, Harry would’ve confidently said that Ron and Hermione were the only people who really knew him, through and through. Harry felt a wave of sadness when he realised that they haven’t truly been close since the day they defeated Voldemort.
The game commentator was a Sixth Year Ravenclaw named Arnold Essertg. Draco knew his family relatively well and he was a good kid. When he passed Draco in the hallway, he said hello and even gave him a hug. Shocking but it was gladly appreciated.
Harry barged into the hospital wing, searching miserably for Madam Pomfrey and calling her name before she appeared, clasping her hands in horror.
to you, Malfoy! How can you be sure that it was my spell? You could have had an allergic reaction to, I don’t know, the alihotsy or something!”
Harry was already at his breaking point of the night and the fact that Malfoy was here taunting him, at his mercy, was almost comforting in a horrific way. He could let himself take his anger out on Malfoy, it would be so easy. Harry stopped repressing his emotions and let the anger take over him.
“I think we should start speaking to each other on a first-name basis. We know each other well enough and this rivalry between us is pointless. We need to work through this soulbond together.”
“Oh? Is that what you think of me, Harry? Pray tell, am I too forthcoming? Too friendly for you? Is this all too disgusting and unnatural for you? Tell me,
He ignored the customary team motivational speech and in turn, they ignored him too. It wasn’t like his duty as a Seeker was that important. They could do without him, everyone knew the Gryffindors were probably going to win anyway. He was about to hop onto his broom when someone grabbed him by the arm.
The elf nodded, bowing again and Apparated with another pop, leaving Draco feeling a little lonelier than he did before. Don’t, he scolded himself, don’t get too attached to elves, you know what happened to Dobby. Sad memories of his old friend flooded his mind and he waved them away, he needed to focus on today’s match and show everyone he still had skills.
“It’s alright, as cheesy as it sounds, all you two can do now is work together to solve this problem.”
foy. So suck it up,” Harry whispered, ignoring the looks of sympathy his fellow Gryffindors were sending him for being stuck with the vilest of Slytherins in their eyes.
Malfoy rolled his eyes in reply and looked over to Flitwick expectantly. The professor looked deep in thought.
He was fortunate to have his own room. McGonagall had allowed him to have his own common room and bedroom which was nice. At least carrying the burden of being the perfect saviour came with some perks, Harry supposed. Maybe having special privileges wasn’t so bad. He had time to reflect each morning and he knew that if he slept with everyone else in the Gryffindor dorms, he would wake his roommates up with his sleep talking and pained cries.
He got up, brushing off the dirt from his pants and slowly stumbled away, not turning around when Harry growled, “You should know that villains don’t get happy endings.”
The hour flew by quickly and before he knew it, Potions was over. Harry picked up his books and waved goodbye to Draco, heading off for his next class. It was kind of Draco to back him up when he spoke to Murphy.
Harry woke up at the third chime of the twelve o clock bell and jumped out of bed, realising he might be late for the Quidditch match at twelve-thirty. Blast his useless alarm clock! He scrambled to the bathroom to brush his teeth and spray some deodorant on and threw on his Quidditch robes, tripping over his own feet as he rushed out of his room and into a familiar blonde biscuit.
He didn’t want to cry but he couldn’t help but sniffle a couple of times and swipe at his eyes to stop the prickling sensation. Draco couldn’t believe that he had ever thought that Harry saw him as who he really was and genuinely respected him as a friend and equal. He should've known from the start that the friendship they formed would end in a disaster because Harry was right. Villains don’t get happy endings.
Draco had been the Seeker on the Slytherin team since his Second Year, and no one had challenged his position even though he had a black spot on his reputation. He might not have been the best player when he’d joined but by doing the team a favour and replacing their pathetic school brooms, he was helping them improve. They’d thank him one day. It wasn’t his fault that the Gryffindor team had acquired a Harry Potter and became impossible to beat.
Harry pumped a few handfuls of his spiced cinnamon shampoo and began to lather it over Draco’s locks, ensuring that none of it got into his steadfast and penetrating eyes. He massaged his fingertips along his scalp and temples, working his roots and then rinsing it off with cool water. A pump of vanilla-scented conditioner and he made sure to really work his way through Draco’s hair, knowing that he was extremely particular about it.
Tonic of Precision, a potion that was primarily made out of plants and flowers. Harry frowned as he stared at the ingredients provided. Baneberry, bugleweed, ageratum and bleeding hearts accompanied by feathers of a skua and musk of a desman. What even was a skua? Harry snickered as he pointed to the words, nudging Draco and trying to make him laugh.
“You defended him back there too, Harry! Are you forgetting that he’s a Death Eater? He almost killed us back in the Room of Requirement last year, for God’s sake!” Hermione yelled, looking bewildered that Harry was still staring at the two of them furiously.
Thankfully, they made it to Flitwick’s office without running into any students. Harry thanked his lucky stars none of his friends had come looking for him only to see his arm around Malfoy, almost dragging him forward with every step. He wasn’t sure how to explain to them that he had not only cursed Draco Malfoy to the point of possibly endangering his life, but also had no idea how to take it back and needed to seek a professor for help. Madam Pomfrey had instructed Harry to escort Malfoy back to the infirmary after meeting Flitwick to rest for the remainder of the school day, so Harry still had to stick around Malfoy for a little bit after Flitwick (hopefully) helps them resolve the curse.
Draco was pleased to see that he would be working alone for today as the seat next to him was empty. He would have to do twice the amount of work compared to everyone else but it was more than worth it to not have to deal with a pesky partner. Potions were his expertise anyway.
To prove the point, Malfoy immediately started spouting his story of headaches and blood in napkins to Flitwick who looked amazed at his inability to hear Malfoy’s words. “Oh, forgive my excitement, boys! It’s just that this may be the first time I’ve encountered anyone under this kind of soul bond.”
What had happened? Just seconds ago they were sharing a tender moment and now, Harry looked ready to Crucio him into oblivion. Draco threw his firewhiskey to the ground, standing up despite the increasing ache in his chest and blinding hot pain in his head.
He happened to be early for all of his classes again, sitting alone until some student sat next to him, gleefully exclaiming that they were seated with the Saviour of the Wizarding World. He gave them a customary smile, ignoring them for most of the time. They didn’t seem to mind, always chatting away even though Harry didn’t respond.
Draco turned around to face Harry and his lips parted slowly. They made eye contact and Harry tentatively placed his one hand on Draco’s cheek and the other on the nape of his neck. They leaned closer to one another, tilting their heads slightly and Draco’s soft and flirtatious lips were centimetres away from Harry’s sweetly curved ones. Was this really about to happen? Harry thought. Was he about to kiss the person he thought he hated the most? They could feel each other’s breath on their faces, lips so near the others and just as they were about to kiss…
Harry greeted Seamus as enthusiastically as he could manage, promising to grab a butterbeer with him soon. He headed over to Ron and Hermione who’d been staring at him ever since he stopped by the Gryffindor table and sat down opposite them. Ignoring the odd looks they were sending him, Harry looked over at the Slytherin table for a familiar blonde head of hair.
He was not about to have a restful night. The day’s events had only served to stress him out which would increase the likelihood of a terrifying nightmare. Tonight would be one of the worst.
Just like that, Harry felt like he was back in the hallway, carrying a bloodied Draco in his arms as Ron and Hermione stared down at him, looking disgusted. A surge of white, hot anger filled Harry.
He left the bathroom, leaving Harry missing his touch. Was he actually attracted to Draco? No, he couldn’t be. This was just the result of curiosity and it meant nothing. Draco and he were friends now, nothing more than that. He continued to relax in the tub, closing his eyes and taking a moment to breathe after the hectic day. He stayed there until his food got cold, but it was alright. He just needed some time to think.
Harry had spent his weekend cooped up in his room, only leaving once to find a book he needed as a reference for his Defence Against the Dark Arts essay. He had been feeling perturbed since he had yelled at Ron and Hermione on Saturday. It was unpleasant to have left that encounter on such bad terms with his two closest friends, but learning that their hatred of Draco was so strong that they barely even cared that the boy nearly
Draco lay on his back, staring at the ceiling while fiddling with thumbs in annoyance. Goddamn Potter and his stupid spells. He refused to dwell on it any longer, simply hoping the curse would die down on itself soon. Flitwick hadn’t seemed overly concerned just now, so whatever other effects the curse was going to have on him was probably not going to kill him.
He disappeared into his thoughts for the rest of the day, not realising that time would go by so quickly. Merlin and Morgana, he forgot how tiring classes were. He needed to stretch his legs and get some fresh air.
Besides, staying away from Potter would be good for him. Draco certainly didn’t think their past day spent together was anything close to pleasant, and being seen with the Golden Boy himself would only bring him more attention. It would certainly ruin his plans of staying unnoticed in the background this school year.
The class had been prepping their potion ingredients for twenty minutes when someone barged in through the back door, panting heavily. It was none other than Potter himself, looking dishevelled and unprepared.
“I’m sorry, I must have missed that,” she said politely, indicating that he should tell her again. Her tone, however, implied that she gathered the two must have knocked themselves on the head on the way to the infirmary.
As Harry wiped away his sweat and tried to calm himself down, his thoughts subconsciously drifted to Draco Malfoy and his eyes that were a mixture of stormy lightning and calm cloudiness. Pretty pink lips enunciating melodious word after word. Beautiful.
Before he could reach for his wand to throw a hex, Potter drew his, yelling a spell that Draco hadn’t heard of before. It hit Draco square in the chest, causing him to be flung violently back into the wall.
Slughorn raised his eyebrow questioningly but waved his hand in dismissal. The moment he did so, Draco sprinted out of the classroom and toward the bathroom, slipping on the smooth marble and bumping into walls in his hurry. No one could see him like this.
When Harry hesitated, she narrowed her eyes and he reluctantly held his hand for the sake of it. Malfoy’s head wound started to close, leaving nothing but a small dark, sulky bruise.
It had been 122 days since the war ended. Harry had counted every single day since Voldemort died. Things in Hogwarts had changed. McGonagall was the Headmaster now and she had decided to let those affected by the war retake their classes. Seventh Year was now the Eighth Year.
“The magic from the soulbond is ravaging his body, specifically hurting his lungs and heart. He should be avoiding all strenuous activity, I cannot believe you let him go out on the field! I expected better from you, Mister Potter.”
Draco woke up earlier than usual, yawning and stretching his arms, working out the kinks in his bones before jumping in surprise after noticing a prodigiously hearty breakfast laid out on his desk. He wasn’t expecting it but judging by the temperature of the fragrant earl grey tea, Honky must have laid it out a few minutes ago.
As Draco began to stir his potion, he felt his throat clench up. He could only describe it as the feeling one got when about to cry and unable to speak. He coughed into his silk handkerchief, the itch in his throat too persistent to ignore. He was horrified to see flecks of vermillion dotting the pure white cloth. He began to cough violently, rasps shaking his whole body.
Slughorn waltzed off, rambling about the tonic and its properties. A light tap on Harry’s shoulder made him turn to his side. It was a Gryffindor he didn’t personally know. His name was probably Murphy or something like that if Harry remembered correctly.
“What the hell happened to you? He’s a Death-” Ron choked on his sausages mid-sentence, coughing violently into his plate.
He took a breather first, sitting down and using a stick to draw shapes in the mud. He was reminded of an argument he had with Sirius while he was still alive.
He leapt out of bed, throwing off his blankets and trying to get a sense of where he was. His eyes quickly adjusted to the darkness and he ran his hands along his whole body, sure that he was going to have gashes everywhere.
Draco rolled his eyes, unwilling to reply to his jibe. He subconsciously knew that he would accidentally let slip something bad and he didn’t want to ruin the lighthearted mood. Harry could sense that something was a little off from the way Draco’s smile momentarily disappeared. It could possibly be due to Draco’s misadventures and the things he had to do while working under Voldemort, such as the accidental poisoning of Ron and the cursing of Katie Bell. No, Harry told himself, the past is the past, do not let these mishaps ruin your impression and friendship with Draco.
A snarky comment from the boy brought him back to reality and he immediately felt guilty once he heard Malfoy’s accusation.
He lurched forward, vomiting onto the floor, almost puking on Harry’s shoes but he jumped back at the last moment, pitying the boy as his heaves sounded painful. Tears began to flow freely from his eyes and a bout of coughing took over the puking. Not only was there vomit on the ground but blood as well. Harry decided that he shouldn’t be so unhelpful and rubbed a supporting hand over his back, telling him it would be alright.
Harry threw his mug of firewhiskey into a tree, yelling out loud in frustration. The moment Draco left, he immediately felt regret that he had been so cruel. He didn’t mean any of those words, but did he? Some part of him must have felt that way, if not he wouldn’t have thought of it, let alone say it.
He ran off without another word, leaving Draco standing confused in the dimly lit corridor. Not that Potter noticed but Draco had actually found his hair rather adorable. It showed him just how chaotic and forgetful Potter could be and he did look far better like this, instead of having his hair plastered to his head like a common Ministry worker.
He entered the dark and dreary dungeon, multiple stenches hitting him in the face at once. It was cold, temperature cold, and it was unlike the coldness that used to emanate from this room when the Death Eaters had taken over Hogwarts the last year. The mood was cheery now, which was the result of Slughorn’s bright personality.
Not everyone returned for the Eighth Year, however, and Harry only recognized a few of his batchmates. He had agreed to return because he felt that it was the only place he had ever truly belonged, and staying at Grimmauld Place had only forced painful memories of Sirius to resurface in his mind.
The crowd went dead silent and the game stopped, all the players running towards the two boys. Harry sat up, frantically searching for Malfoy’s heartbeat and brushing the bloodstained silver hair out of his eyes. Thank Merlin, he found his pulse. Though it was weak, it was better than nothing.
“Murphy’s a nice guy, don’t tease him too much. But it was pretty funny,” Draco agreed, bumping Harry with his hip cheekily.
The Great Hall was almost prettier this time, floating candles now replaced with exuberant chandeliers and cutlery embedded with small jewels. It seemed as though it was a brilliant fresh start for Hogwarts. Harry knew better than to hope that returning would allow him a fresh start as well.
He wanted to run after the blonde boy but it was pointless. He was certain that Draco would not accept his apology and rightly so. He had done something so horrible to the already broken boy.
The once spotless handkerchief was on the floor, soaked in red and Malfoy was gripping the sink so tightly his knuckles were white and his knees were shaking. Malfoy whipped around and rasped out a “Get away from me Potter!” but he was unable to utter out another sentence before collapsing to the ground in another fit of coughs.
“If you’re taking me to the hospital ward, I do not want anyone to see us on the way. Is that clear?” Malfoy commanded.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he realised he was unharmed. It felt too real to him. Thank Merlin he’d been given a separate room from everyone else in the common room. Slughorn must have done so so suddenly due to Flitwick telling him about the current soul bond situation between him and Potter. Yes, the disadvantage was that he was near to that arse but it was better than humiliating himself in front of all the Slytherins. Hopefully, Potter didn’t hear him from the next room.
“We’re halfway through the match and it’s neck to neck, both teams are on one hundred points! Who will find the Snitch first? The daring devil Harry Potter or the valiant knight Draco Malfoy?”
He watched over him the whole day until the sun began to set. His tea had gone cold and his back was stiff from sitting in the small chair but he could put up with it for a while.
Draco was lost in his thoughts and paid no attention to the names being called out, nor did he notice the numerous glares he received as the list fell upon his name. Draco was used to the dirty looks sent at him by now but they still stung. He couldn’t believe that he used to be popular and adored by his housemates, it all seemed like a faraway myth now.
Accusations were being flung at Draco and Harry was getting tired of it. Couldn’t they see that he wasn’t hurt and it was Draco who was injured? It was the stupid prejudice getting to their heads. He couldn’t stand it anymore.
‘Oh, fuck’ was his only thought when his grip on his broom loosened and his head exploded with pain. His vision went dark and he fell unconscious, losing control of his body immediately.
“Will all of you shut up! I don’t want to hear anyone speaking of him like this! Fuck off, all of you!” He bellowed, tone venomous and he stormed off, leaving everyone stunned. They weren’t expecting this kind of outburst from him, especially defending an ex-Death Eater! He must have been enchanted, they whispered to one another as they watched him disappear.
“Fuck it,” He said to himself, ditching the Snitch and diving after Malfoy. He was falling so gracefully, an expression of peace on his face and hair flying around gently in the wind. He was getting so close to the ground, Harry wasn’t sure he could save him.
“Ah, Mister Malfoy, how are you? I heard from Headmistress McGonagall that she managed to get you a room next to each other, which was the result of my persuasion skills.”
“I did not know Master Harry and Master Draco were together. Honky was given instructions to bring food to Master Potter and then to Master Draco, forgive Honky’s intrusion!”
With a ‘pop’, the young house-elf appeared, bowing as he removed the tray. “Master Draco hasn’t eaten much. Master has only eaten a piece of bread, Honky is concerned.”
Finally, Harry headed to Potions class with a small skip in his step, as he looked forward to seeing his partner. It was their first Potions class since the incident and well, Harry needed to catch up on what he had missed. He sat next to Draco, smiling and raising his eyebrows as a greeting before flipping through the pages of the textbook, waiting for other students to arrive.
Malfoy squawked furiously. “It was Potter! He-” Madam Pomfrey squinted in confusion. She could clearly see Malfoy’s mouth moving rapidly but couldn’t hear a single word.
As Draco walked back into his room, hair soaking wet and smelling exactly like Harry, Onyx greeted him with a loud meow, brushing himself against his leg.
Being reminded of his godfather was painful, and the argument was also his fault. It seemed like everything was his fault. He never apologised to Sirius for that and it would forever weigh him down. Merlin, he needed to make that change and make it soon.
Jars full of pickled slimy creatures, unknown fluids, dried herbs and tentacles. Dirty cauldrons lining old oak tables that were stained and worn down from aeons of use. Ah, Potions class. The dishevelled state of the room was normal to the students by now. Memories flooded Draco’s head and heart as he remembered his old Potions Professor, Severus Snape.  He missed him now that he was gone, just like everyone else he had lost. He shook his head, trying to rid himself of these intruding thoughts. He had to focus on class, not get distracted by his feelings.
“Soulbond?” Harry mused, wondering how the spell he’d found highlighted on a random scroll he picked up could have been this powerful.
“You’re not you! It’s just the stupid spell making you act like this. The first night we came here, we were already at each other’s throats. A Death Eater like you and a hero like me aren’t meant to be friends and you know that,
Draco looked like his usual composed self again. If Harry hadn’t been there, he would never have guessed that Draco had had such a close brush with death mere days ago.
If it did, Draco mused, he could just haunt Potter for the rest of eternity. The stupid, annoying git and his stupidly firm chest deserved that at least. Merlin, had that chest been comfortable…
“Chicken? I’m not a chicken! I’ve gotten away with loads of things before, probably even more than you have,” Draco sneered.
Harry then realised he was holding the arm which once had the Dark Mark and he trailed his fingers over the scars and he didn’t realise it, but a meagre tear slid out of his eye and splattered onto the sand. He was panting heavily from the exertion of saving him but now it was time to get him to Madam Pomfrey. He picked Malfoy up bridal-style, draping his limp arms over his shoulders and hurried past the crowd as fast as he could.
Draco stood at the sink, scrubbing his face and watching as the cool drops of water trickled down his face, tapering as it ran down his neck. The man he saw in the mirror had a calm, proud demeanour but deep inside, Draco could see the torn brokenness of his soul. The only physical signs that ruined the whole facade were his dark purple eye-bags and sunken eyes.
As Harry sat through his lessons and lunch alone, trying to avoid Ron and Hermione, he found his thoughts drifting time and time again to Draco. How he’d smiled at Harry this morning, how his hair had glistened in the bath. He figured that it was just his excitement at forming a new friendship, his first in a while. The day passed agonizingly slow as Harry counted down the hours to Potions class which he shared with his
“You called me Draco. Right now and back at the pitch,” He murmured, licking his lips to moisten them as he tried to sit up but ended up laying on his back, too tired to move.
He got to his feet, smirking at Potter who was frozen and looking at him with a horrified expression. He was probably mad that his puny little spell didn’t work at all.
Harry stared at Madam Pomfrey dubiously. “What are you talking about? He just told you I was responsible for the curse and the whole coughing out blood thing.”
Harry stumbled along with the rest of the students to Hogwarts, the once flawless castle structure crumbling in certain places, still in the process of getting repaired. It did, however, look much better than it did the last time Harry had seen it. The castle’s familiar smells brought back a myriad of memories and Harry took a deep breath to steady himself before following the crowd into the school’s entrance.
Luck was on his side and as the pair turned a tight corner, Draco managed to overtake Harry and his nimble fingers reached out to grab the golden globe when a Bludger came out of nowhere. He heard someone scream his name but it was too late. The solid ball slammed into Draco’s temple and another yell came from behind him.
Harry stared at him in surprise, not expecting that from him. He nodded, dumbfounded by Draco’s proposition.
The moment they shared in the shower had given Draco a tiny tinge of hope, but he quickly squashed it down, not wanting to set himself up for disappointment. Harry was
“Goodbye, Potter,” Draco mockingly whispered before walking out, deciding to head straight to the Slytherin common room. He needed a good rest if he was going to have to deal with all these pesky Gryffindors for the rest of his school year.
For a moment, Draco feared that he was going to bleed out on the ground again. This spell sounded far worse than Sectumsempra to him but surprisingly, nothing happened after he laid there waiting for a moment. In fact, he didn’t feel anything at all.
As he ran through the hallways of Hogwarts, he heard Hermione’s voice call him from behind. “Harry, what was that back there?”
He supposed he would have no choice but to confront his friends at breakfast today. He’d been avoiding running into anyone he knew over the weekend, having Honky bring him his meals over the weekend - the elf was an unexpected blessing. However, he didn’t want anyone to come checking on him after skipping meals in the Great Hall for two days, so he reluctantly got out of bed for breakfast with the rest of the school.
“There, happy?” Harry looked over to Malfoy who had been nodding along angrily throughout Harry’s explanation of his symptoms.
“Are you stalking me, you freak?” He demanded, eyebrows creasing in annoyance. It had been three days since they last spoke to each other. It was Saturday now and he was surprised to see that Malfoy hadn’t died yet.
“You were such a prat, a right royal stuck-up one,” Harry laughed, “I bet deep down you still are one, eh?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Ron and Hermione staring at him and he almost felt bad for ditching them. He then remembered what had transpired at breakfast the other day and all feelings of guilt disappeared. No point crying over spilt milk.
Harry sighed, knowing that Malfoy was right. He wasn’t sure how to sugarcoat the events of the day and Malfoy’s symptoms so he told Flitwick what happened exactly how Malfoy would have done it - emphasising how Harry was to blame for everything.
Malfoy’s slender pale hands scrabbled at his neck as his grey eyes were flooded with panic and Harry kneeled next to him, holding his head up as blood splattered onto both their uniforms. It reminded him of Sectumsempra, and how Malfoy was on the ground with blood and water surrounding him. A beautifully painful scene.
His gaze drifted over to the Gryffindor table where Potter looked like he was on the verge of exploding and lashing out at someone. Draco could tell, he had been in that same situation many times as well. Granger must have said something to him when Draco walked by a few minutes ago and the others had the table seemed to erupt in laughter and agreement. Strangely, Potter had been glowering at her since. She’d probably insulted his perfection or whatever.
It was Hermione who responded first, but Ron’s anger became more apparent when he slammed the fork he was holding with a death-grip down onto the table, startling the students sitting beside him. Always one for dramatics, Harry thought to himself, resisting the urge to roll his eyes.
He had changed, both physically and in terms of behaviour. His skin was paler than usual, hair so blond it was almost white and he had grown much taller. He was less lanky and more buff, clothes fitting him perfectly. The elegance and pride he once carried himself with were nowhere to be seen. For a brief moment, Harry let himself wonder if Malfoy no longer saw himself on a level above everyone, but could not imagine his former arch-nemesis possessing even a shred of humility.  Harry knew his calm demeanour was all a facade, he was probably broken inside, just like himself.
“He could’ve died, Ron! Are you going to ignore that fact?” Harry shouted without thinking. He felt rage boil inside him when Ron and Hermione remained completely unsympathetic towards Malfoy’s injury. Instead, he saw confusion bloom on their faces.
Harry stared at both his friends. He almost saw them in a completely new light, disbelieving of the fact that they had no care at all in the face of someone so obviously injured, and so desperately wanting to have something to blame Malfoy for, even though the boy hadn’t done anything to Harry during the match.
He sprinted towards the nearest bathroom and found Malfoy hunched over the sink, coughing harshly as blood trickled out of his mouth and into the grimy sink.
His voice was quiet, not much louder than a whisper and Harry held him closer, running his hand up and down his arm, pouring water over him.
Draco felt like Harry had just stabbed him in the heart with that statement. A Death Eater? No, he could not believe Harry had just called him that, no. No, no, no, he did not want to believe Harry had said that to him. It was just too gut-wrenching.
As they traversed the corridors, Harry did their best to make sure no one saw them, but as they were turning the corner, they bumped into a Hufflepuff First Year who held back a small shriek when she saw the blood on Malfoy.
“No! I’m staying here in the room next to yours, thanks to Slughorn. Fix that rat’s nest on your head that you call hair before you insult me. Did you even comb it today?”
Unbeknownst to Harry, Draco was suffering from the same afflictions as him. The other boy couldn’t erase the image of his parents’ sad expressions and Voldemort’s icy glare from his mind.
Suddenly, he saw Potter swerve and speed up and a golden blur made him realise the Snitch was right there. He sped up, dodging the other players until he was right next to Potter, looking at him coldly in the eye.
By then, most of the Gryffindor table had heard Harry’s outburst. Most of them just pretended not to have noticed and awkwardly picked at their food, while some just stared openly at Harry. Harry couldn’t care less, waiting for whatever words his friends were gonna yell back at him.
“You are not going to die!” Harry roared, grabbing Malfoy just as he was about to hit the ground. The momentum of doing so caused him to roll off his broom and he instinctively held Malfoy closer to him, shielding his face and neck. The coarse sand scraped their skins until they came to a halt in another pit of sand.
“Hey, if you don’t mind me asking, why’d you run out of class the other day? You left your potion brewing and it burnt. It stunk up the whole place,” He said, looking genuinely concerned.
Making a decision, Harry cleared his throat. When he’d gotten Ron and Hermione’s attention, he spoke. “Look, guys, I know just as well as you do what Draco was like in the past. He’s still an annoying git, sure, but he suffered from The War too. He’s just as human as we are, and you should think about why you’d give no care at all to another person who nearly died.”
Murphy’s face morphed into one of shock and confusion before clarifying, “Indigestion? Did Malfoy eat it too?”
“It’s the best I could do. Like I said before, the magic from the soulbond prevents me from fully healing him. I’ve done my best to heal the head wound, but do you want to hear what other conditions he’s suffering from?”
“I can’t bloody say it, Potter! Remember what happened with Madam Pomfrey?” Malfoy huffed, leaning on one of the room’s pillars to steady himself.
Harry paused to lean on a wall outside the Great Hall, catching his breath and trying to regain some of his calm. He’d go to the bathroom in a minute, just in case anyone had decided to follow him out.
“I defended you twice from other people and you misuse my help, such filth! Can you believe that? No one would risk their reputation for someone like you,” Harry spat.
“Draco, you’re awake,” He said sotto voce, smiling with relief. He suddenly pulled his hand back when he realised he hadn’t let go of it since Madam Pomfrey had asked him to. He tucked it into his pocket before the other boy could notice it. Merlin, that was embarrassing.
Ron snickered and everyone at the Gryffindor table went on with their conversations, some still whispering about Malfoy and his public breakdown after the War. For some reason, Harry felt a sudden and immense need to stand up for the blonde. This wasn’t like Hermione at all to be this cruel, even to Malfoy. But then again, Harry reminded himself, people change.
Malfoy tried to push him away the entire time, succeeding in doing so once but nearly falling down the staircase. Harry gave him an ‘I told you so’ look and helped him up again, much to Malfoy’s chagrin.
Just then, Malfoy walked past the trio on the way to his table and Hermione’s cheery smile contorted into an ugly sneer. “Death Eaters shouldn’t be allowed back into Hogwarts, especially not
. Slughorn didn’t say anything to Draco before walking to observe another desk, lest Draco snapped back at him and caused a scene.
He wondered if he should have felt more upset that he’d potentially just ruined his friendship with the two people who he’d cared about the most. His own apathy towards the situation surprised him. They’ve had fights before, of course, but one of them usually sided with Harry. This was the first time he’d been left completely alone.
Unsurprisingly, Malfoy let out a yell as well, thoroughly freaked out by the little girl. Harry put a finger to his lips and whispered, “It’s alright, I’m helping him. Now, run along and don’t tell anyone you saw us, alright?”
Potter didn’t bring up further plans to “work together” with Draco to find out how to break the curse and the bond, clearly not giving a rat’s ass about Draco potentially suffering more from it. Whatever, Draco thought, if Potter didn’t care, then he wouldn’t either. Draco doubted any spell Potter was capable of performing would really bring that much harm to him. After all, this was the most righteous, noble and
A purr was his response and he picked up the kitten, placing him on the bed before dressing himself. Did Harry really offer Draco his clothes? It could have been done out of pity. And did they really almost kiss? That was insane. He wasn’t sure how to feel about that. He sat on the edge of his bed, stroking his cat’s head.
He grabbed a dinner roll, biting into the soft bread and chewing it slowly. He looked forward to seeing Harry tomorrow, luckily they had Potions class together.
Without saying another word to the pair, Harry turned and continued to hurry towards the infirmary. Malfoy was in need of treatment immediately, and Harry didn’t have the time to continue listening to whatever bullshit accusations Ron and Hermione were going to make up about Malfoy. He’d deal with them later, he told himself.
Harry raised his eyebrows in mock surprise and crossed his arms, sticking his tongue out like a small child.
“Yeah yeah, I know what you’re thinking right now but you’re no chicken, are you?” Harry teased, flapping his arms wildly as a friendly jibe towards Draco. He knew it was going to make Draco stand up for himself and was pleased with the response he got.
Unfortunately for him, there were none left, but he supposed the next best thing was a carriage with just Ron and Hermione. It had been ages since he had spoken to anyone other than Kreacher. After the war, he had drifted from everyone he was close with because they just couldn’t understand why he didn’t want to move on.
As the elf disappeared, Harry let Draco sling his arms over his shoulder and put on his shoes, leading him back to their rooms. As he led them up the stairwell, he contemplated taking him into Draco’s own room but in the end, settled on bringing Draco into his larger dorm. It was time for him to get rid of his unnecessary hatred for him and to move on.
Watching the amber firewhiskey seep into the ground made him remember the soulbond. Oh Merlin, the soulbond. How was he going to stay near Draco now? He needed to apologise and fix his mistake.
He closed his eyes, resting peacefully as he breathed in Harry’s scent, a comforting aroma which helped him sleep.
“You’re the reason why my parents are dead! Don’t tell me I’m the one acting like a hot-headed brat!”
A quiet murmur from the pale boy jolted Harry out of his daze and he turned to face him, watching intently as he blinked slowly.
Draco felt comforted knowing that he and Harry weren’t at each other’s throats anymore. Their newly developed friendship was almost too good to be true, but Harry seemed to genuinely want to work together with Draco. With Harry’s help, it would be much easier to get to the bottom of the curse and their soul bond.
“Sorry,” He muttered, realising that this was kind of his fault. Upon seeing his dejected face, Madam Pomfrey calmed down and healed his scrapes, giving him a warm cup of chamomile and lavender tea to calm his nerves.
“Malfoy? What the hell are you doing here?” He screeched, pushing his glasses up and frowning at him. No one was usually lurking in this corridor, especially since he was the only occupant in the hidden dorms. As far as he knew, there were only two rooms and he occupied one of them, meaning Malfoy was either stalking him or stalking him. There was no other option.
He didn’t know what to do now that the fate of the wizarding world wasn’t hanging on a quest Dumbledore had sent him on, and he figured that drowning himself in school life would at least help distract himself from his traumatic memories of the War and his inner demons, even if it was a temporary escape. Everyone he was close to had chosen to move on, and it seemed like he was the only one stuck in the past reliving the war. His ‘victory’ was nothing more than a nuisance to him, leaving him with no clue of the purpose of his life after he had already defeated a villain that had plagued his mind since he was eleven.
“Something’s happened to you. I don’t even know who you are anymore, Harry.” Ron muttered. “We were always there for you, supporting you through thick and thin. We had to put up with all your pain and suffering and have you ever cared to think about what we feel? How have we been impacted by your destiny? No. I bet you haven't and I bet that you’re not going to do anything about it either. I’m sorry Harry but you need to fix yourself.”
“You’re suffering from shock. Here,” She said, wrapping him in a thick blanket. She asked if he was going to stay with Malfoy and he said that he would.
Draco was nowhere to be seen, probably enjoying breakfast in bed in his room at that very moment. Everyone was used to Draco not showing up to meals and never bothered him, hence he could easily get away with having meals in private every day. Harry felt a pang of envy, wishing he could do the same and not care about what others thought.
They were silent once again, the only sounds in the room were muted scrubbing and an occasional splash of water. He let Draco rest his head on the crook of his shoulder and he washed with one hand, the other hand wrapped around the boy’s thin waist.
The cat massaged the mattress, curling up into a pile of fur. Draco laughed, laying on his back and staring at the ceiling. Being touched affectionately was a nice feeling, he’d like that to happen more often.
“You’re not scared of getting in trouble, are you? I’ve gotten away with sneaking out of Hogwarts multiple times and even if we do get caught, what are they going to do?”
As Draco wandered about with a childlike expression of glee on his face, Harry stayed a few paces behind him, trying to hide his ever-growing grin as he watched Draco ease up and thoroughly enjoy himself. He couldn’t stifle his chuckle of happiness when Draco stole a small baby blue periwinkle from the flower shop and tucked it behind Harry’s ear. Its pale colour stood out against his unruly jet-black hair and Harry sighed contentedly.
Even though his best friends were seated right across from him, Harry felt more alone than he ever had. He’d expected the feeling of emptiness in his chest that he had grown accustomed to in the last few months to at least fade slightly in the presence of Ron and Hermione.  Distantly, Harry’s thoughts wandered to Malfoy who was currently alone in that carriage as well. It was horrid, he mused, what war did to some people.
Harry, even if Harry didn’t love him back. Soulbond or not, Harry was always going to despise him. Thinking of that, he really couldn’t stop his tears from falling and he crumpled at the roots of a tree, sobbing softly to himself. How did this ever happen to him?
It was meant to be a light-hearted joke but unfortunately, it came out spitefully and Harry knew Draco had picked up on his true meaning. He had tensed up and his smile had begun to contort into a frown.
When Potter ignored the comment and turned to walk into the stalls, Draco felt the sudden need to strike again. Did Potter think of himself too high and mighty to grace Draco with an acknowledgement? “Come to catch a break, Potter? All that glory and praise too much for you? Don’t think you’re worthy of that either, do you?”
Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes, reading the instructions in their textbook again. Harry could be so doltish at times, he mused. He didn’t notice it but Harry’s eyes were on him throughout the entire lesson.
No one responded to the potions professor, partly because his query seemed like a rhetorical question and partly because there was still that remnant of a fierce rivalry between the Slytherins and Gryffindors. Slughorn wasn’t about to stand around waiting fruitlessly, so he jumped straight into taking attendance for the class. No point hanging around and waiting for a response that would never come.
Soon after, they both reached Hogsmeade. Warm memories enveloped Harry’s mind as the delicious scent of butterbeer and spicy aroma of firewhiskey filled the chilly air. It was gorgeous. The place had been rebuilt after the War but it remained almost exactly the same. Cobblestone pathways, brick walls and thick oak doors kept the cosy medieval feeling of the village. Pleasant.
Harry looked up as Slughorn entered and waved his wand at the board, revealing this lesson’s instructions.
“Thanks, Honky,” He said, talking to the empty air. Who knew, maybe the house-elf could hear him all the way in the kitchen.
“Harry, boy, you said that you were the only one who could hear Mr Malfoy when he spoke about his symptoms?” Flitwick frowned as he summoned a dusty book from one of his shelves.
Malfoy clutched his arm, whimpering as gargled gasps escaped him. The look of helplessness in his eyes was enough to make Harry tear up. After a few more jerky jolts from Malfoy, his body went limp, blood oozing out of his mouth and landing on the ground with a muted pitter-patter. Was he dead? Harry’s eyes widened as he stared at the unmoving body of Malfoy.
He sat down on a fallen log, holding two mugs of steamy firewhiskey and beckoned for Harry to sit down. Harry did so, trying to steady his pounding heart and shaky hands as he gladly accepted the drink.
He held Malfoy’s head up so he wouldn’t choke on his own blood as that would be a truly horrible way to go, collapsing in a dingy Hogwarts bathroom. Merlin forbade he became the male counterpart of Moaning Myrtle. Sworn enemy or not, Harry couldn’t just leave him to die alone in a bathroom.
He’d spent his weekend trying to make excuses for Ron and Hermione’s utter lack of concern for Draco’s life, believing that they would’ve realised how wrong they were by now. Harry had felt the same about Draco once, but their recent encounters had changed his mind. Draco was just as much a victim of The War as the rest of them were, the physical scars Voldemort had inflicted on him proved as much.
“Hogsmeade? Now? Are you out of your mind? We have classes!” Draco protested, shocked upon hearing Harry’s suggestion.
He had to remind himself that this was not a date and that they were just two friends spending time together. You and Malfoy are just friends, he lectured himself, get a grip! He almost said it aloud but stopped in his tracks when Draco hurried back to him, clutching his hand as he dragged him out of the village and into the nearby forest.
Harry manoeuvred his way around the train carriages of the Hogwarts Express, trying to find an empty carriage so he could wallow in his thoughts by himself. Just as he was about to enter one, he spotted a familiar blonde. Draco Malfoy.
He’d tried to defend their lack of concern from the last time in his head all weekend, and thought that they would have regretted it for sure by now, realising just how unsympathetic they had been. Ron’s statement today clearly proved that wrong.
Madam Pomfrey’s eyes widened and she magicked away the mess, giving Draco another healing potion to help with the nausea he was experiencing. She helped him sip some water and encouraged Harry to stay with him as much as he could. The closer they were, the less damage the spell would cause to Draco’s body.
The crowd booed when he said Draco’s name and he rolled his eyes, unperturbed by it. He wiped the sweat off his brow, clutching his head when it throbbed. It was getting worse but he wasn’t about to make everyone hate him more by quitting the game. He had to push on.
Harry was frozen after seeing Draco run out. His thoughts weren’t processing at first, but once he snapped back to reality, he darted after Malfoy, ignoring Slughorn’s exclamation of protests. It didn’t matter, Harry thought, he was Slughorn’s favourite student anyway and will be able to get away with this.
“You hit me with a curse you read off a random scroll? You’ve truly lost your mind!” Malfoy yelled, looking absolutely horrified. Bugger, had Harry said all that out loud?
He had placed his arm on the sliding door and Harry could see the marred skin where the Dark Mark used to be. Everyone knew of his mental breakdown after the War. He had witnessed the death of his parents, murdered by Voldemort as they tried to save Draco. A traitor, they had called him, and the Death Eaters had orders to kill Draco on sight. His parents had pleaded for Voldemort to spare him but in return, they had been killed. Harry had been one of the people who had to restrain Malfoy from running back towards the forest where his parents’ corpses laid. The Malfoy heir was reduced to nothing but a sobbing mess and he had to be dragged away to St. Mungo’s after he nearly bled to death from his self-inflicted wound. At least the mark was gone now. All that was left was a mottled scar on his once spotless skin.
Again and again, Harry was forced to relive seeing his friends brutally slain by Death Eaters and Voldemort. The haunting scene of his godfather falling through the veil and Bellatrix’s cackles rang in his ears.
“It’s your bloody curse that did this, Potter! I almost died because of you! You do have a penchant for trying to murder me in bathrooms, don’t you?”
Lost in his thoughts, Harry didn’t even realise that he’d reached the Great Hall until he felt a hand clasp his shoulder. “How are you doing Harry? Haven’t seen you for a while, eh!” Harry looked to the person speaking to him.
Malfoy threw his hands up in frustration and looked at Harry expectantly. “Aren’t you going to help me up, Potter?”
Harry scanned the room looking for a seat. Unfortunately for Draco, the only available seat was the one next to him. As Harry plonked his belongings onto the desk, Draco shifted away, twisting his face in displeasure.
” He cried out, knowing Harry would easily block it and he did. Draco wasn’t quick enough to react when Harry simply flicked his wand, a large force punching him in the gut and sending Draco crashing back into a tree trunk.
“Sorry I’m late Professor, I overslept,” he wheezed, clearly worn out after running to class from his
Malfoy could tell that Harry was staring at his arm and brought it down quickly and almost defensively, slinking into the carriage without a word with an obsidian coloured cat at his feet. He hadn’t realized that Malfoy had acquired a new pet. Harry had never seen a cat that’s looked so poised and elegant before. It was a very tiny cat as well, and much like Malfoy. Small but carrying a lot of grace. Harry gawked at Malfoy through the glass of the carriage’s sliding door in surprise. He had been waiting for Malfoy’s snide retort since he had spotted that pale, pointed face and felt a pang of disappointment when Malfoy had left without one. The sense of normalcy Harry yearned for felt even further out of his reach. Malfoy had never once walked away without having the last word, most often an insult aimed at Harry. The shutter of the blinds down the carriage window that Harry was mindlessly peering through snapped him out of his thoughts. Malfoy must have caught him staring again. Looks like Harry had to find another carriage for himself.
? What was he going to do with the body? How was he going to explain this to the professors? Let alone explain it to himself!
“I thought you weren’t like everyone else but you’re just the same. You think that you’re better than me and well, the truth is, maybe you are. But don’t make me the villain and cause of everything bad that’s happened to you.”
“Boys!” Madam Pomfrey interrupted, “Stop fighting! Now, go and seek out a professor and come back when you can tell me what happened.”
The plump man chattered, unaware that the two boys weren’t fully listening to him. Harry stifled a snort, nodding while Draco blushed furiously. The other boy was not used to this attention, it had been far too long since a professor had taken an interest in him. Merlin, it was humiliating to see that so many teachers knew about their predicament.
Harry grinned at that, it was nice seeing Draco happier and more relaxed. It had barely been a few weeks since their awkward encounter on the train and their friendship had really evolved since then. He also appeared much healthier and less pallid. Spending time with Harry certainly seemed to calm the effects of the soulbond.
The way he said it made Draco feel like that was the bare minimum Harry could do for him, that defending him from the onslaught of insults and abuse was the best he could do and that hurt him deeply. It hurt him even more than the words Harry said to him all this time.
Despite the extensive healing spells Madam Pomfrey had performed that had taken effect in his sleep, Draco still winced slightly in pain while trying to stretch and reach certain parts of his body while showering. He hadn’t completely understood Harry’s suggestion to help him last night, but he realised now that it certainly would’ve been painful for him to bathe himself before the healing spells fully kicked in overnight.
“I never wanted you to die, Malfoy! Hell, I’ve never even wished anything painful unto you, all that blood was probably just the spell’s fault.” Harry refuted.
The sound of a door slamming open caused him to jump and he looked in the mirror to see who had come in. Just his luck, it was none other than Potter. The situation felt like an obvious set-up and shivers ran down Draco’s spine as he recalled what happened the last time he and Potter had run into each other in the bathroom. The scars from that encounter throbbed in phantom pains as he straightened and turned to face the other boy.
The kid choked out a quick ‘sorry’ before looking back at his table and laughing. He evidently thought he was some hotshot and would be ‘cool’ in the other Gryffindors’ eyes if he targeted an ex-Death Eater. Draco gave him a pained smile in annoyance before striding out of the hall to clean himself up in the bathroom. It would do no good to his already wrecked image if he fought back and he didn’t want to give the Gryffindors the satisfaction of seeing him crack. His father had always taught him that Malfoys would never sink down to the level of those unworthy of their attention. As Draco walked to the bathroom, he didn’t notice Harry stood against the wall outside the Great Hall and the other boy didn’t notice him either.
“Malfoy? You’re playing? Are you insane? Your condition…” Harry said while wiggling his eyebrows. He was obviously referencing the soulbond and his illness but nothing was going to stop him today.
Harry was awoken by Hermione shaking his shoulder, letting him know that they had reached their destination. He forced his eyes open and stood up groggily, bumping into the door on his way out. He saw Malfoy in the corner of his eye once again but his former nemesis did the exact thing he had done earlier today; stare at Harry then walk away. It was slightly infuriating to Harry, how Malfoy treated him with such indifference when taunting Harry used to be the boy’s biggest obsession. One could argue that Malfoy himself was also  Harry’s biggest obsession in the last few years, but Harry certainly wasn’t going to ever admit that.
He picked up his broom and headed down to the field, breathing in the warm crisp autumn air. It felt good in his lungs, making him feel just a tad more powerful. He loved autumn because of all the glorious colours but there was a despondency to it. The leaves of the trees were dying, just like he was inside. Draco had never found such solidarity in leaves. “You and me both, buddy,” He said, watching as a single orange leaf fluttered to the ground helplessly and was crunched on by a stampede of students.
The cat sneezed in response, sniffing him and giving him what appeared to be a frown. Well, if cats could frown.
He gazed wistfully at the window, watching the raindrops trailing down the glass. As his cat settled down in his lap, he thought to himself, at least I have one friend with me to make it through this school year.
Harry grimaced, not knowing whether he should laugh or try to help his friend. Hermione reacted before Harry could make a decision, reaching over to thump Ron’s back with a look of concern on her face.
No, you can’t think of Malfoy like that, he thought to himself. It’s Draco, not Malfoy, another part of his head told him.
As he stood still among the bustling crowd, he watched as couples lovingly held each other’s hands, pecked each other on the forehead whilst giggling and sharing jokes. How painfully beautiful.
The harsh coughing stopped after another minute. Ron must have managed to swallow his food, Harry realised. As Ron took a moment to recover, Harry reconsidered his friends’ words about Malfoy.
Harry sat up with a jolt, panting heavily as he blinked away the images of Sirius’ stunned expression right before he fell through the veil to his death. Lost, never to be seen again. He’d been afflicted with similar nightmares since the day they’d lost Sirius, but they seemed to be worsening as of late. He couldn’t think of the last time he’d woken up after a peaceful and full night of sleep since the War had ended.
