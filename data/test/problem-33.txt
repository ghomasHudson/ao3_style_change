“Hmmmph–“ he groans, grabbing two harsh handfuls of Draco’s ass and squeezing. “You’re goin’ to be the death of me.” Draco could say the same thing back.
“I really don’t, love,” Harry says.
He keeps it up for good ten minutes, until the monotonous movements of his hand has made Draco completely relaxed and loosened up and him just as sleepy and satisfied, so he stops it and maneuvers Draco’s limp body to the side. He’s heavy, unconscious like this, but Harry still somehow manages to fit his chest to Draco’s back, his knees to the insides of Draco’s. He kisses his nape and wraps a protective hand around his waist and just as he’s about to drift of too, Draco shifts in his hold.
“There?” Harry asks, but Draco doesn’t have to say anything to confirm it, it’s evident in the way his legs shake, his hole clenching around the shaft stretching him. “Hold my hand,” Harry whispers finding Draco’s hand that’s once again crumpling the sheets.
He leaves the Charms classroom with a dumb smile on his face, thinking about how that last soft whisper Draco sent his way felt dangerously promising. He doesn’t want to get ahead of himself, but tonight might just be the night it finally happens. The world might just find out Harry Potter has a boyfriend. Yes. That’s what they are. He knows it. Something tells him Draco knows it too.
They don’t use cleaning charms or conjured lube on Sundays. They take a boiling hot shower instead and Harry always complains about it but stands through it nonetheless. Draco has a feeling it’s only because he washes his hair under them.
It’s Draco.
“It’s not him, don’t worry,” Harry promises.
“I did just say so, didn’t I?” Draco snarls.
It sounds baffling admitting it but that doesn’t make it any less true.
He fiddles with his tie for a bit, blindly trying to get it into place as neatly as possible and when it’s done, he sprints down the corridor, hoping that McGonagall won’t kill him for being late.
(See the end of the chapter for
He moves from where he’s leaning against the wall and squeezes through a mass of people until he’s at the center of the room where several armchairs and a low wooden table are placed. He plops down onto one of the empty armchairs, pouring himself some Butterbeer and swallowing down a heavy gulp of it. It feels refreshing and cold on his throat and just as he takes one more sip and reaches to place the glass back on the table, Seamus shows up. He sits one of the armchairs opposite of Harry, his eyes glinting in the mostly dim room, like he’s already had too much to drink.
That’s what I tell myself when falling asleep becomes a chore (
“I am,” Harry says, moving backwards to the door, “I’ll wait for you tonight, though.”
It’s been great fun at the beginning, what with the breathless groping in the abandoned dark corridors and the endless rutting in the library’s forbidden section (All of the Golden trio had gotten a pass to visit it freely from McGonagall back in September. Turns out defeating your generation’s darkest wizard had some advantages after all. Not that he used the pass for any actual reading.
“Did you hear me?” Harry asks again, when Draco makes no effort to answer his question. “Draco?”
? She never says yes and I never believe her.
Actually, it’s not even morning anymore. It was roughly around noon when Draco woke up so now it must be around two o’clock, but it doesn’t really matter anyway, for Harry is still greedily going at it, not showing any signs of slacking or Merlin forbid getting bored of Draco writhing on their bed.
Ron says I should socialize more.
And that’s when Harry gets to experience it in its full glory.
Some things we just can’t speak about.
Draco doesn’t answer anything to that, but he does turn his face away when Harry tries to catch his lips in a kiss. He sulks a little just because he can, finding that Harry’s still chasing his mouth and placing a tiny kiss on it even when it’s pouty.
my bed anymore.
It’s clear that we don’t fall under those categories, so who are we? Who am I when I buy purple grapes in October because they’re your favorite, Harry? No one eats them. They ripen and rot on my table until they’re nothing but a home to a family of fruit flies and poor Blaise has to throw them out because I can’t fucking look at them without falling apart and he can’t figure out why. Who am I when I wake up in agony, seeing nothing but crimson flames and he has to hold me while I mouth
He slicks back all the long strands (these days mostly all of them are long and shiny, for he’s growing it out) and tucks all the short strayed ones behind his still flushed ear. Draco hums a little raspy thing, reaching out a feeble hand to touch Harry’s pecs in acknowledgement of the gesture. He lets it stay there, hot and flat on Harry’s skin, but still so gentle and pliant, still so uncharacteristically Draco, unlike every version of him Harry’s used to seeing on every day basis. It makes Harry still the movements of his fingers between the silky strands just to relish the fact that he is the one that gets to make Draco feel like this. Make him feel this safe, this calm and unworried.
“Or rather how,” Hermione adds. This conversation is getting more and more awkward by the second and still all Harry can think about is whether him wearing Draco’s tie means that Draco is somewhere out there walking around in a Gryffindor tie. In
Sunday
Draco’s eyes widen at the mention of the unholy acts he
“Who’d you hear that from?” Harry asks, even though he already knows Ron had to pay Seamus for losing in a certain bet on Harry’s love life they had going.
He wasn’t about to add that ‘please’ but he knows how Harry gets when he does, all wide-eyed and drooling like a dog over Draco’s body, like he can’t quite comprehend the information that Draco would want something from him so much so that he would literally
It’s not the eyeshadow that destroys Harry today, however, and nor are the velvety lips, constantly brushed by Draco’s pink tongue, or those white cheekbones that could kill a man.
Yes. Harry’s had multiple things up there. Let’s not count.
. I tried the other day and got so furious at myself when it turned out shit that I cried over the sink for half an hour, all the spilt coffee residue smiling wickedly at me like it’s happy to be going down the drain. Like I did it some sick favor. I don’t really know how to deal with anger lately. I guess I never did. My coping mechanisms have changed though. Now, if it angers me I cry about it. For example, the other day at work I went through a whole year worth of files, selecting and organizing them in chronological order (you would’ve loved it) and then Robards stepped by to tell me I’m going to have to do it all over again for some reason I didn’t stay around to hear, for my eyes were already wet so I had to excuse myself. I cried at the second floor toilets, under a weak Silencing Charm that kept wavering over my nasty sobs. I organized the files again after that, of course. Wasn’t even that loathsome, once the anger was out.
Harry looks down for a second and then to the side, thinking if exposing him and Draco like this is actually a good idea. Even though he feels that he’s close to getting Draco to go out with him in public after this morning’s shenanigans, he’s still not sure if Draco would say yes to
In fact, I haven’t been able to step into the bedroom at all since. I bet the tulips you brought in that morning are all wilted, the petals fallen and dried out into brown on the floor.
. He tastes like chocolate pudding. And like safety and comfort and something else too. Something Harry’s a little bit afraid naming. Something that feels too big for his chest, too precious to hold.
Love, Draco
Draco's response letter.
He finally sees it when he catches his reflection in the mirror of the second floor’s loo.
“Yes–! Umphhh, you git. Of course it’s… agh… of course it’s good,” Draco’s balling the sheet in his fist, desperately trying not to crush Harry’s head between his legs as they rest on his shoulders. It’s the most vocal he’s been all morning and he hates Harry for being so self-conscious. How can the tosser not see that he’s literally making Draco fall apart? Or he can see it and he just likes to hear that it’s good for Draco verbally.
You’re not naïve, love, you don’t fall under the hands of homicide, you seek them out and cradle them, and I am not reckless – I choose my tormentors carefully and learn them all the tricks.
It’s such a cheesy sentiment that Draco would probably punch him in the face if he said it out loud, but thank Merlin he has all the freedom to mull that thought over in his head as much as he likes. And it seems that he likes to mull it
Harry slows down his thrusts, instead making them deeper and more calculated, rocking his hips so that he finds that spot inside Draco and when he finally does Draco whimpers almost soundlessly, biting his lower lip.
Blaise is good to me. I understand this might not be what you want to hear right now, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s true – he does make it easy. He’s easy to care for, he makes me breakfast (and doesn’t burn it), he kisses my forehead and mother loves him. He does all the things you did, except he doesn’t adore me as much. I don’t blame him though. I don’t think anyone’s ever adored me the way you did, Harry. And I’m also not sure that’s a compliment.
Harry almost squeaks with joy and he probably would if he had any more time to react, but then Draco sits on his lap, tucking himself into the cradle of Harry’s arms, moving them around himself, like they’ve been doing this for eons. He smells of that citrus shampoo he loves and of chocolate pudding they had for desert. He probably tastes like it too.
on Harry’s sheets, it makes Harry’s heart ache as it expands even more for this lovely creature resting peacefully beside him.
I overwork myself to stay sane, go out for drinks with Pansy and reread the same murder mystery over and over again. It’s the comfort of knowing the plot by hand, of having already psychoanalyzed the character’s actions. I know who’s about to die, I know who pulls the trigger or sharpens the knife, who ends up weeping over the coffin – I just have to read it through.
“Don’t get all mouthy now–” Harry says. “When I’ve had you close to sobbing a second ago.”
(See the end of the chapter for
You said he makes it easy but, darling, I can’t
that’s no way to speak to someone who’s literally got their mouth full of your ass darling,” Harry teases and Draco knows he’s meant for it to be all playful and snarky, but fuck it comes out sexy and wanton instead and all it does is it makes Draco’s cock twitch on his stomach. “You do know I could stop at any moment–“
“You’re not going to tell us, are you?” Hermione implicates in Harry’s silence. She’s always been able to read him. Most days even before he can read himself.
And Harry really can’t really argue with that, so he obliges and moves the white cotton sheet down so that it covers just the slender curve of Draco’s bum and leaves the beautiful ivory skin of his back on display. He experimentally runs the tips of his fingers over it, just how he knows Draco likes it best – loose and slow – and immediately feels rewarded by the little blissful smile that appears on Draco’s lips. He looks so pleased and dazed as Harry lets his fingers wander over his spent muscles, his breaths silent and puffy. Harry’s rough finger pads trace the shape of his shoulder blades and follow the path of his spine, roaming over a couple of dark moles that embellish the white surface of his back. He touches the narrow line of the silvery scared tissue that’s peeking out from his front on one side and watches as Draco’s breath comes out more balanced, his back rising rhythmically as it does.
Harry plunges his head back to where it was a second ago and Draco automatically curls his toes as his boyfriend licks a wide long strap over his continuously fluttering entrance. They’ve been doing this ever since they woke up. Well, to be frank it’s Harry that has been doing anything since they woke up. Draco’s just sort of laid there for the past two hours reveling in Harry’s dedicated work. It’s not his fault that his boyfriend just loves eating arse. He wasn’t about to complain. There wasn’t really much he could do about it anyway (and it’s not like he wanted to), because he opened his eyes to Harry already kneeling down at the edge of the bed, mouth full of Draco’s rapidly hardening cock. From there on out he proceeded to give Draco a beautiful Sunday morning orgasm that would’ve been just enough on its own for Draco to carry on with his day satisfied, but it turned out that Harry was just starting out with his ministrations.
he gives me, I still walk around with my head in the clouds most of the time now. And it’s not the good, cotton-candy pink kind either. It’s the gloomy, inflated with impending rain one.
“First of all,” Draco begins, placing both of his hands on Harry’s chest to make some distance between them. “Don’t
“So…” He starts, dragging out the word unnecessarily long, “I hear you’ve been up to some funny business with some lucky Slytherin.” He makes a quick uncoordinated gesture with his hand, and Harry assumes he’s pointing at the tie.
hope you liked this little story and if you did leave a kudo and a comment!! :)
Harry slowly pulls out, shamelessly watching as Draco’s hole twitches and oozes his come. He hooks a thumb into it, causing Draco to flinch a little and then brings it to Draco’s lips parting them and pushing it inside. Draco gladly swirls his tongue around the bulky digit, sucking off Harry’s come and letting his eyelids flutter in what he hopes is at least a little bit attractive way for someone who’s just been fucked out of his mind. Harry smiles serenely at him, that big stupid smile that Draco could very much live off of.
“Jesus! Transfiguration started five minutes ago!” He says, looking around for his bag and glasses in a rush.
“Get out, Harry,” Draco says softly.
He really ought to take it off, he probably looks stupid and overly cocky, but he doesn’t want to make this feeling of belonging to someone disappear just yet. It’s good. Even if no one knows to whom his heart belongs to (stop being so sappy, Jesus), they now that he is taken. It’s good. He only wishes Draco was as enthusiastic about belonging to Harry. Maybe he’s just not ready for commitment. Maybe he wants to keep his options open, find someone to fuck him better (highly impossible, Harry fucks him best, Draco admitted so on one occasion even).
“’Night love,” Harry says and holds him tighter, finally letting sleep take him.
The moment he would probably fight another war over if he was in danger of losing it.
He does that sometimes. It drives Harry mad.
He doesn’t take the tie off not even when the so called party at the Gryffindor common room begins.
“Why did no one tell me I was walking around in a bloody Slytherin tie all day?” He practically cries out once he’s stepped out of it, like his friends are to blame for the mismatched tie.
Harry really doesn’t know what he means by the “Don’t Draco me”. As if Harry’s been doing anything other than that. He’s been calling him by the first name for weeks now. It didn’t really feel right to stay at the ‘Malfoy’ basis after he’s had so many things up the blonde’s ass.
“If you’re implying that we’ll be attending the event at the-“
They’ve only just come down from a miraculous orgasm and Harry is perfectly aware that he’s using Draco’s pliant and affectionate state in the aftermath of it all to persuade him to come to the rejoicing at the Gryffindor common room tonight, but he doesn’t care. He’s okay with some gentle manipulation if it means he’ll get what he wants finally.
Hearing those words come out of Hermione’s mouth makes Harry burst out laughing. He puts one hand on his sternum, right where the sloppy knot of what he’s only recently found out is not his tie ends and tries to calm his breath.
I’m sorry to hear about your recent sleeping inconveniences. No matter how much I wish I weren’t sharing the same sentiment right now (and I do wish upon it very hard, trust me) – I am. I’m writing this out on the balcony, while Blaise is asleep in the bedroom. It would be a lie if I said I couldn’t smell the tobacco we’d smoke out here together right now. I don’t smoke anymore. It was a habit we shared, much like all the other addictions I got hooked on while with you. It doesn’t feel good doing those things on my own. It doesn’t bring comfort or satisfaction, just a painful sort of nostalgia. It’s same with the tulips. I don’t buy does anymore either.
The half-conscious snoozing Draco is the only Draco that will let Harry do this. Well, this one and the one that’s had a shit work day at the Ministry and needs some extra loving but won’t actually properly ask for it, but will instead choose to drape himself over Harry on the too small sofa and silently beg for attention in the form of hair petting.
I guess he’s right. I don’t really talk to people anymore. I don’t have anything to say to them. Last Tuesday I complimented Neville on his new robes, but that hardly counts as social interaction.
October 17, 2005
a Slytherin bloke. Or something of such sorts if I’m correct.”
enjoy!!
“You are?” Ron asks in a surprising tone, his eyes widening. “So I was right!” He makes a fist and a short hissing sound, looking somewhere down the corridor when he mumbles to himself.  “Seamus owes me twenty.”
, Draco. I’m fucked up. I swear I can smell you in some parts of the house, in the habitual misty crack of side-alonging someone to the Ministry, in stranger’s cologne and my own toothpaste. I still haven’t thrown your toothbrush out for fuck’s sake. I keep telling myself I ought to do it, but I’m afraid I like the comforting look of it a bit too much for such an act of abandonment.
He rolls over lazily picking up whoever’s wand is closest from the bedside table or summons them with a wandless Accio from wherever on the floor they ended up on and fixes them both up with a cleaning and freshening charm. Draco mumbles something that resembles a “Thanks”, but his cheek is already squished against the fluffy pillows, his eyelids already fluttering sleepily.
Before he could help himself, Harry answered: 'In a corridor with Malfoy.'
The way they'd cornered him also told him it was either a bold Gryffindor or a sly Slytherin and of course the first wasn't even an option. He shuddered again. The idea of the Weasel kissing him was as bad as Millicent was. Thomas was involved with that Irish bloke and Longbottom was rumoured to be dating an Hufflepuff girl. For a moment Potter crossed his mind but he shook his head.
now, he didn't even have a home anymore since the Ministery had seized the Manor.
He wrapped his arms around Draco and gently pushed him forwards. As soon as Draco heard the door close, he was pushed against it. The boy pressed his body against his and pressed his mouth to Draco's in a frenzied haze of lust. Draco groaned and kissed him eagerly back.
His patented Malfoy glare hadn't worked on her since second year, so he bit the inside of his cheek every now and then, and tried to be patient. Having patience wasn't one of his virtues though.

Thanks for reading, leaving kudos or comments <3 <3
Harry didn't even notice this time that he unconsciously had lifted his hand again until he almost touched Malfoy's face.
Pansy nudged him. The glare he gave her was a rather weak attempt and they both knew it. His fingers were trembling a little, while he unravelled the piece of string.
His head hit against a cushioned armrest and before Draco could even think that this was most certainly distractive, Potter had reversed their roles and straddled him.
Honourable. That sounded a lot better. Like a Gryffindor trait actually. He remembered hearing the Sorting Hat about chivalry amongst bravery and boldness. So, like the true Gryffindor he was, he put the red candy in his mouth and went to the bathroom. The other boys were waking up when he re-entered.
The weird thing was that the things, the beings, seemed to slow down, one by one. Almost as if they were frozen, Which was odd considering how hot his body was.
The notion distracted him long enough for him to have lost the way back to Gryffindor tower. Irritated with himself, he turned around to find a shortcut to the seventh floor and … froze.
Slowly he raised his head, a fiery red colouring his cheeks, and said to Malfoy: 'You go get those… flowers, I'll help Harry.'
'Well, it's supposed to last only for three hours, so I better look for some distraction in the meantime.' Harry supplied.
'Eager much?' he taunted. 'Is that just for me or is the Weaselette withholding?'
All too soon the sensations stopped though. To his disappointment teeth, lips, and hands disappeared, and within moments, Draco was left blinking against the sudden light.
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
Although Harry was grateful for his dry clothes, he couldn’t let Malfoy think he could boss him around, therefore he replied: ‘Ah, that’s right, you’re too short to look down on me, aren’t you?’
Suddenly Harry felt something inside that he hadn’t felt for years. Hot blood seemed to flood his brain and extinguish all reasonable thought.
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
Leaning on one hand he pressed his lips to Draco's jawbone. Potter touched the faint stubble with the tip of his tongue.
Malfoy was standing between his legs, and his face was so close Harry could feel his breath on his face, and those silver-grey eyes just looked at him as he put pressure on Harry’s muscles … It was almost the same as his fantasy last night, and it was too much. Some voice in his head screamed that he should end this. Unfortunately, all his thoughts were lost in the pleasurable haze that was the caressing of Malfoy's hands over his chest. He was getting more and more aroused and to his utmost horror a tiny moan left his lips.
The dorm was quiet when Harry woke up, except for some heavy snoring coming from Ron's bed. His hand accidently brushed against his morning wood and before he knew it his mind rushed back to last night.
Hysterical laughter almost escaped him. That wasn't something to worry about? Knowing that the same person who assaulted him yesterday stood before him?
Ron threw him a nasty look, but started reading anyway.
'I know you Gryffindors act before you think, but if you'll look at this, we can explain,' Malfoy drawled.
Unless Draco decided not to share the whole letter with us of course.
He passed the rope and started wandering through the quiet aisles. When he turned a corner, the sudden darkness that fell upon him made his heart start pounding increasingly.
Potter shook his head.
But then he remembered the things the boy seemed to know about last year, about him, and the way it almost looked as if he was … wooing him through the Christmas song. If he were to be honest with himself, he'd have to admit that he could maybe fall for that boy. So, would he let the chance that it was one of those three ruin the best thing that happened in a long time?
‘Fuck!’
He was disappointed when hours went by without his sight being concealed. Trepidation made him so cranky that his housemates avoided him as much as they could. Only Pansy kept testing his temper, asking him why he'd suddenly disappeared from the library, where he went, if he'd met that mysterious person and so on.
‘Come on, I’ll show you the massage room and the relaxation area I have here at home.’
Only one more day. Are you as anxious about Draco's decision as Harry? Well, probably not ghe ghe
Once again he was left staring until the darkness disappeared. The first thing he noticed was an enormous dish on the side table, still half full with ice cream and cherries. He took the spoon and began to ate, but it wasn't as good as before. He pondered if the boy had ruined his favourite dessert forever.
He gave her a tiny smile, grabbed his bag and left, the letter still clutched between his fingers, as if he was afraid he might lose it.
George called this one 'The Wing that sets you on a pedestal'.
Draco does a lot less sneering and mocking in this story than usually, so hopefully you don't find him too out of character.
'Hey, Harry!' Ginny smiled and tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'Wanna go to the lake this afternoon and have some fun?'
‘That pain is almost certainly caused by the muscle problems in your neck. Sleeping in such a posture will strain the muscles without a doubt. It’s a good thing I’m known for my skilful hands then. Right, Potter? I can work those specific muscles to reduce the spasm which causes the pain.’
He startled when Ginny and Parvati exclaimed: ‘You’ve got to be kidding! She lost twenty pounds? Which modelling agency?’
Unfortunately, Seamus had heard him and teased: 'Still thinking about your hot date, Harry?' While Ginny burst into tears, Harry escaped the Great Hall before he would answer the Irish boy. 'Potter! Need some distraction again?'
His lips then moved up his throat, kissing his jaw and then his chin. It wasn't enough so Draco bent his head until their lips met. The familiar taste left him lightheaded. Just as he was about to deepen the kiss the boy stepped back. Draco's groan was only answered by a soft chuckle.
‘Harry?’ Vaguely he recognized Hermione’s voice. He shook his head as if to clear his mind. Hermione sounded a little worried, but she had that curious look in her eyes like she always had whenever she stood on the brink of figuring something out. He took his glass in order to avoid her eyes and was glad to see his hands at least were steady.
The hand stilled. 'Trust me, Draco, you don't want to know,' the boy answered sadly. 'You wouldn't want me to kiss you, if you knew.'
'No, of course not,' his friend responded. 'But maybe we could try talking to her.'
'You let someone nibble on your ears, after they'd kissed you on Christmas Day, yet you don't know who they are because you were blinded,' she said in a flat tone and looked as if he'd given the Weasel his last Galleons.
He managed not to stumble on those last words, but Pansy picked up the slightly hopeful tone all the same. She rolled her eyes and sighed: 'Honestly, Draco!'
'What?' Malfoy sounded incredulous. 'You noticed my –?'
Draco blinked against the sudden lights of a Christmas tree in the alcove and gazed around him, still stunned by the whole exchange. He didn't see anyone or heard even the slightest sound. 'What the hell?' he muttered. He tried to feel enraged but instead he just felt curious as he touched his lips in wonder.
'You'll probably don't believe me when I tell you that I know you very well. In fact I think there aren't many people at Hogwarts who know you the way I do.' The voice sounded calm, yet convincing. Draco wanted to snort but found himself listening intensely when the boy continued. 'I know you didn't want to do those things last year. I know you didn't have much choice with Voldemort holding your family hostage.' Draco's mouth fell open in shock. 'You weren't a killer even though you've made some pretty bad choices. And I think you've paid for most of them. We're probably more alike than you think, although that thought would shock you if you knew my identity.' He sounded sad but went on, 'Most of all, I think everybody deserves a second chance. I watched you, Draco, these last months and I've seen the changes in you, whether you'll admit it or not.' He squeezed his hand again. 'Little by little you won me over without even knowing it. And then one day I saw you flying and the sun gave you a golden halo and I thought you were the most beautiful person I've ever seen.'
His eyes snapped southwards and he discovered that his lower body was covered with a blanket. The woollen fabric felt weird on his naked bits, he thought. Then realization hit him; it must have been Kreacher doing the covering up thing. Mortified he closed his eyes and let his head fall back on the back of the couch.
Sighing internally, Harry went on. “Ground Quidditch is basically the same as normal Quidditch, except, you know, no flying, and the Snitch doesn’t fly any more than seven feet above the ground. The team who wins will get a prize, but I’m apparently not supposed to tell you what it is until after the game. You’ve been pre-divided into teams, so go ahead and choose your roles and we’ll get started!”
“That’s what I’m doing, darling.” She blew him a kiss, and he rolled his eyes.
something, something that said ‘you’re important to me.’ He found a small cafe to have a bite at and bought a sandwich, sitting down at a little table by the window to think.
“Yeah?”
He looked
“Oh, piss off,” Harry said, but he was smiling.
“I haven’t, exactly,” she told him, “but I’ve taken a couple of anatomy classes, mostly to understand how all the parts of our bodies work together. And I like drawing, so…” She gave a graceful shrug. She was wearing a long sundress with thin straps, and the movement emphasized her narrow but muscular shoulders and prominent clavicle.
Gabrielle gave a wet little laugh, turning her head and wiping away a tear. “You heard that?”
Draco poked at the gaudily-dressed witch featured in the ad for Gladrags that had just been dropped onto his desk in distaste. The witch squirmed away from his finger and glared at him, obviously offended. He rolled his eyes. It wasn’t
He returned to the warm bed as quickly as possible, shivering from the cold of the floors on his bare feet, and Harry immediately curled into him despite seeming to have fallen back asleep. Draco allowed the comforting warmth of him to pull him back under.
“Isn’t he always?” Andromeda sighed.
“—traitorous little—”
As what Pansy was saying sunk in, Harry felt himself pale. If ‘everyone’ thought that they should leave it alone, that meant that they all
. And, he thought as he watched him catch a wooden dragonfly as it tried to dive off one of the tables, laughing, it was...
“How’s Cassie?” he asked Blaise, changing the subject to the younger Zabini sibling. “Any plans for post-graduation yet?”
Harry blinked and then gave a disbelieving laugh. “I can’t believe you just compared me to Jesus.”
“I’ll go fetch Teddy,” Narcissa said as the other three moved the food into the dining room.
Pansy sighed, her exasperation written all over her face. “Draco, can you talk some sense into him? I can’t deal with his nonsense, and we’re going to be late.”
Warm arms wrapped around his waist, grounding him. “Bad dreams?” The voice was gravelly with sleep, but it sounded like salvation, and Harry nodded as he leaned back, letting it call him home.
“Well!” Blaise announced once the front doors had swung shut. “Hilde, Jack, Leela, Perry, Sadiyah, Sullivan—welcome to the final six. From here, you will each get a chance to have a day-long solo date with Harry, after which he will narrow his choices down to his top three and then, ultimately, one. Congratulations! I’ll be in touch soon. For now, enjoy your day.”
“I’m afraid I can’t,” Draco said, feigning regret. Then, steeling himself, he added, “I’m on
Silence. “Why?”
“I’m going to be sick,” Draco answered.
Harry shook his head in amusement. “Alright, get out of here you lot, I need to sleep this day off.”
flexible when I want to be.”
He raised an eyebrow at her, and she laughed. “It’s not a fetish or anything! It’s just a dancer thing, I think. Plus, feet are interesting to draw.”
“I think we must have used salt instead of sugar,” Harry said dejectedly. There was no other possible reason that their lovely looking muffins could come out tasting like Play-Doh. Perry groaned next to him, looking at the assembled ingredients on the counter top.
“Might have to try a few more, just to be sure.”
glad that it’s all being recorded,” he muttered, his words muffled but still clear enough for Harry to hear. “Okay,” he said, dropping his hands and standing up. “I’m going to walk you through this, and then I’m going to get extremely drunk and pretend that I pulled a Sadiyah and gave up on my own. Alright?”
“Yeah? Tell me about it.”
“I do not wish to spread tales. I should not have said anything, I apologize. The dates have been lovely, and the house is very nice.”
“Oh, I was in the woods, mostly,” she told him, waiting patiently as he climbed out of bed and began rooting through his suitcase for clean clothes; after his shower, he’d collapsed on the bed and fallen asleep almost immediately, towel still wrapped around his waist. Not all that long ago, he thought he would have felt self conscious changing in front of Luna, but now that the lot of them had witnessed Blaise prancing around in the buff, it felt rather unremarkable.
Sitting and watching the pair converse while Andromeda and Narcissa exchanged bits of news, occasionally looping him in to share tidbits about people he knew or ask about his upcoming plans was, again, bittersweet. Basking in the feelings of family, of belonging, but knowing that it was only for now; that he would be leaving in two short weeks. Still, he would do his best to enjoy it while he could.
Harry took a deep breath and tried to smile through his nerves. “Right. Well. Thank you all for humoring me today in my Quidditch adventure. It was certainly one of the less conventional games I’ve been to! And it was great getting to know some of you a bit more tonight.” He stopped and cleared his throat. “Unfortunately, though, as Blaise said, I have to send two of you home. When I call your name, please step forward.”
The final contestant to arrive did not come from one of the limos; instead, they roared up the long drive on a motorcycle, parking it directly in front of Harry and pulling off their heavy black helmet, shaking loose a luxurious fall of thick, wavy black hair that reached their shoulders. They were sporting a well-fitted leather jacket, dark jeans, and black leather boots, and their low-cut white tee shirt revealed hints of stark black ink across their clavicles. They reminded Harry a bit of Sirius, although their eyes were dark instead of grey. They were also very,
Sullivan was grinning as he took Harry’s skis from him and helped him climb back on board for the umpteenth time. Their spotter stood to the side with her arms crossed, looking vaguely amused. She’d insisted on taking the lead on getting Harry out of the water the first few times he fell, but had eventually decided that Sullivan was up for the task and let them handle it themselves. “I think you almost had it that time,” he said, and Harry laughed, pushing his sopping hair out of his face.
Once home, there was a scramble for the three showers, everyone wanting to rid themselves of the accumulated dirt, sweat, and bug spray. Harry, by virtue of having the Master Suite to himself, was able to claim first go with no trouble. He basked in the multiple streams of water, first cool as he tried to bring his elevated body temperature back down, and then blissfully hot to ease the tightness of his muscles. He sighed happily as the steam billowed around him, luxuriating in the heat. He should get one of these for Grimmauld, he thought absently.
He spent an extremely pleasant day with the children, reading them the story he’d promised the day before and losing spectacularly at hide and seek due to being roughly three times the size of the smaller kids. It did wonders for his mood, and by the time he was scheduled to meet up with Leela, he felt much more himself.
“No.” Harry rolled his neck and grimaced. “Maybe.”
Draco had arrived at breakfast sated, a tad sore, and almost impossibly happy. He should really, he supposed, have predicted that his father would manage to immediately ruin it.
Harry stood there, feeling extremely lost. “But how can they be gone? Did anyone see them leave?”
“Fuck it,” he heard Harry say, and then there were hands on either side of his head and he was being—quite thoroughly—kissed, right there in the alley. He melted into it immediately, pulling Harry closer to himself almost instinctively. There was an iron tang of blood as their tongues met, and Draco wasn’t sure whose it was, but he didn’t particularly care. He didn’t care about much of anything, right now, besides Harry’s hands, and Harry’s lips, and the press of Harry’s chest and hips against his own, and whether Harry might want to reenact this moment later but somewhere with a bed and a lot less clothes.
Draco shook his head. “No one has seen them at all since yesterday morning.”
“It’s hard to say. It would probably be easier to tell you what I’m actively looking for instead of what I’m not.”
“Nothing to worry over, I told you,” Luna said serenely from over by the window. “You might need to rest for a few weeks, though. Ribs are tricky things.”
“It’s already been arranged, dear. It would be rude to back out now. You may disagree with your father’s tactics, but Astoria has done nothing wrong and does not deserve to be embarrassed by your refusing to accompany her.”
Draco rolled his eyes but couldn’t help but smile. He’d missed his friends, no matter how much they annoyed him.
Harry grinned. “Just don’t insult it, and you should be fine, then.” Draco pinched him, and Harry laughed. This was the first real interaction he and Draco had had since their awkward morning encounter, and Harry was relieved that Draco also seemed content to just forget all about it—or, at least, pretend to.
ing noise and pulled back slightly. “Hey, none of that. It’s not the end of the world.”
. It’s bad enough when we aren’t all in close quarters, but this week has been truly unbearable. Make. A fucking.
Jack’s drawing was mostly hazy and grey—soft swathes of shadow that Jack told him was vine charcoal. It didn’t include Harry’s whole body; rather, it was focused largely on his chest, the angle from which Jack had been sitting apparently giving them a mostly unimpeded view. The strongest lines of the piece were in stark white chalk against the grey: a meticulous mapping of his scars—both the oval left by the Horcrux locket and the spreading lightning of the killing curse. It was, overall, eerie, and Harry couldn’t decide whether he wanted to stare at it for hours or get away from it as quickly as possible. He opted for the latter, trying to slow himself enough to not show his discomfort, and moved on to Leela’s canvas.
He might kiss you.
“One more for me!” Harry crowed, scratching a new tally mark next to his name on the chalkboard behind Draco’s head. “Better luck next time, Malfoy.” The board had a partner behind Harry’s desk, and the tallies recorded on one would reflect on the other, but Harry took great joy in invading Draco’s space and rubbing his victories in his face at every opportunity. Not that Draco was any better. It was part of the fun.
Draco blushed furiously. “I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.” Determinedly, he snatched a clean sheet of parchment and began concentrating very hard on his work, ignoring the quiet laughter coming from across the table.
His skin, his hair, his arousal, his home
“Right. Sure, of course.” He faltered, trying to find something else to say. “So, you still won’t tell me about your job?”
“No, that’s alright, we won’t be long,” Owen said. “The thing is…” He trailed off, glancing helplessly at Rose.
“I’m sorry.” Harry reached out a tentative hand, touching Draco’s shoulder carefully. “I didn’t know.” Draco let out a shaky breath before looking up and meeting his gaze.
Suddenly, a peal of laughter in the near-distance startled them apart, reminding them that they were still outside and probably very much in plain sight should anyone choose to wander around the corner. Harry cringed as his awareness of parts of his body other than those currently engaging Draco returned; his elbows were sore from leaning against the hard wood of the balcony floor and he was a bit cramped up, not to mention a little chilly. Draco wiggled his shoulders uncomfortably against the deck.
“Merlin, no. I doubt I could even put together a dinner party without help. Not that I’ve tried. I’ve never done much hosting, to be honest.”
“Draco.” Softer, this time. And then, surprising him, “Are you happy in New York, on your own? Truly?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And what did you have in mind?”
They chatted about this and that—rumored Quidditch trades for the new season, the hideous art that Harry was now burdened with after his brief stint as a figure model (which Harry assured Draco was very much a one time thing, no matter how much Draco teased him that perhaps he’d finally found his calling), and Pansy and Ginny’s upcoming nuptials, which managed to lead back into why Harry was here in the first place.
Harry shrugged and bit one soft earlobe, just above the silver stud that adorned it, before kissing the corner of Draco’s sharp jaw. “Wasn’t listening.” The sound that Draco made in response wasn’t quite a word, but his hands had begun to slide purposefully up Harry’s back, taking his shirt with them, and Harry thought that was answer enough.
“A group?” Draco felt the beginnings of alarm bells going off in his head; ‘a group’ sounded like more people than just their small Slytherin cohort.
When dinner was done, Harry, Draco, and Teddy made their way to a pond on the outskirts of town that had been temporarily converted into an ice rink. Spintwitches had set up a booth to rent skates out of, and several benches had been arranged nearby. Sparkling lights (charmed Muggle ones rather than live fairies, Draco was smugly pleased to see) were strung overhead between tall wooden posts that had been spaced along the ice’s edge.
Come swimming with me?”
William gave Harry a disdainful look. “These shoes are new. I’m not going to roll around in the dirt and destroy them over a silly game.”
“You’ve got your potion now, though,” Harry pointed out, ignoring the smirk that Pansy shot him. He hadn’t done anything exceptional by buying it; any good friend would have done the same.
“I don’t know,” Draco said, voice somehow teasing despite his heavy breathing.
Hilde danced with the same confidence with which she’d licked his hand; something about her body language clearly said ‘I know what I want, and I know that I can get it.’ Harry let himself be drawn in, let her undulate sensually around him, pulling him in her wake. Colored lights flashed above them, highlighting her hair in green and red and blue, and her skin was warm under his hands. Harry’s head was spinning; he thought hazily that maybe he shouldn’t have taken that shot after all.
“He said he was incompetent, that he didn’t deserve his job and was too stupid to be more than a clerk, and all this...” Harry gestured vaguely and trailed off before finally meeting Draco’s sympathetic gaze. “So I punched him. Didn’t even think about it. Just—” He shrugged. “And then it all went to hell.”
“I mean, you aren’t getting paid for the rest of the season, I presume, so you may as well capitalize on the incident.”
“Sorry, what?” Harry shook his head. “Sorry, I’m sorry. My brain’s all over the place. You were talking about, um…” He trailed off helplessly.
“I don’t know; depends what else your wooing process entails.” The look he gave Draco had just enough of a hint of lasciviousness to it that Draco barely contained a shiver. Instead, he winked.
“I don’t know if I can tell you that without getting him in trouble,” he answered, “but it’s been very much appreciated.”
“Potter, those are— they’re astounding.”
My friends know we hang out. I told them early on, because if there was going to be a big blow up about it, I wanted to get it out of the way. Everyone was pretty chill, though. I think, since the war, we’re all more aware of how our world set us up to hate each other on purpose and of how much we don’t want to be a part of all that anymore.
“Oh wow. That must have been strange.”
With the crowd back up to fifteen, Harry was having a bit of trouble staying on top of what was happening again. It didn’t take long for someone to convince him to get into the pool with them, but it seemed like mere minutes later that he was pulled away to another corner by someone else. There was an overwhelming amount of flesh on display, and Harry’s eyes flitted from Sullivan’s perfectly muscled chest to Sadiyah’s long, shapely legs to Rose’s previously hidden back, which sported a pair of beautiful tattooed butterfly wings. As the bubbles of his champagne tickled his tongue, he wondered how the hell there were so many beautiful wix who were interested in dating
“He’s a handful anyways,” Draco said wryly.
“Oh, I’m sorry, dear. Come in.”
Harry kissed Draco’s lips, his cheeks, his forehead, his neck, and Draco laughed and pulled him closer, rolling his hips up invitingly. Harry ground down in response, and the friction was almost too much. Draco seemed to agree, as he pulled back from where he had begun kissing along Harry’s shoulder to say, “you didn’t happen to bring lube with you, did you?”
Frantically, they rocked together, until they found their much needed release.
The green eyes got a stunned expression. Whether that was from guessing it right or Draco being somewhat polite, he didn't know.
Pleasure whirled in his groin and overwhelmed he whimpered. '
‘Why didn’t you stop working in the salon, once you learned the massage techniques?’ Harry asked all of a sudden.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Draco remembered how he'd kissed him and had rubbed against him and how guilty he had looked before he'd fled. So the Gryffindor really had been a willing participant, he thought hopefully. But why … he'd even told Draco … Oh Zalazar! Potter had told him, Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin, his nemesis for years, that he was a virgin! And, he'd pleaded not to ask him questions!

'Would you please kiss me again?' When the boy did, Draco felt his own smile copied against the other's lips.
Harry is still effected by the Wing that makes him feel honourable.
'Good morning,' said Hermione.
'Draco,' the Slytherin said, 'call me Draco!'
'Incarcerous manus,' the boy said. Before he could do anything ropes appeared out of nowhere and wrapped themselves around his wrists, after which they pulled his arms above his head and tied each of them to a bedpost.
's brilliant,' he gasped and couldn't image that it could get any better. And then warm, wet lips closed around the head and sucked lightly. He whimpered helplessly and threw his head back against the bed. When he started trashing about, the boy held his hips and took him further in his mouth. Draco thought he would have come right that moment had he been able to watch it. The boy pressed his tongue against the vein at the underside of his cock and then started bobbing his head. Draco's world spiralled out of control and it was too much and yet not enough. Never enough.
While Harry was still trying to soothe the grumbling in his chest, in order to understand those words, Malfoy summoned a large, strange looking device. He then pulled Harry out of the armchair and waved shortly with his wand.
The Slytherin stuck his chin in the air in a mock-offended manner and Harry's eyes immediately strayed off again.
Have a wonderful New Year's Eve!
He, too, turned sideways and reached out until the tips of his fingers touched Draco’s shoulder. He let them slide over the pale skin to his hand.
Even Harry rolled his eyes at this blatant display of shallowness. He was just thinking of something, anything, to change the subject, when Dean beat him to it.
The first Moodwing Harry tested was called 'The Wing that makes you feel blue'. The second one: 'The Wing that makes you feel honourable'.
Which was why it took him by surprise when Potter started pushing him away.
‘Yeah, Potter?’
He looked at the two of them, but felt nothing. Dean was feeding his girlfriend tiny biscuits and kissing the crumbs off her lips. When Ginny caught him watching them, she smiled. As Harry returned the gesture, he realized that the only feeling in his chest at that moment was happiness for the two of them.
A hand on the other side of his face pulled him out of the horrible memories. The boy must have stepped closer because he suddenly felt knees bumping against his. Draco could feel a warm breath on his face. It smelled cool and sweet, like peppermint, and he suddenly realized he was about to be kissed. By this stranger!
'Yes, I could,' he reacted.
‘Come on, let’s have a look then,’ Malfoy said, and for the second time that day he offered his hand. Harry took a steadying breath and let his eyes wander over Malfoy’s impeccable outfit for a second. It would be very satisfying to mess it up, but maybe it wasn’t a very smart idea; the two of them in a hot tub. His monster begged to differ, but he ignored it. Malfoy, however, seemed to agree.
Harry turned around in terror when he heard the familiar drawl behind him.
A slow smirk appeared around Malfoy's lips and Ron saw red. He raised his wand.
He was silenced by Draco’s finger against his lips.
Although he didn't really want to believe that, he shivered. And although it wasn't really the cold that made him do that, he was grateful for the warming smell that hit him a moment later.
‘… and now all he does is cut fabrics. So much for being a fashion designer.’
His fingers tightened in the soft hair as he rocked back and forth.
Four fingers.
And then it stopped. The boy pulled out of his grip, and Draco was momentarily disorientated. He blinked his eyes and realised that the other was panting with the effort.
'Open your mouth,' he told Draco next. After a slight indecision Draco did as he was told. He felt something cold and hard, and automatically closed his lips around a spoon. He moaned when he tasted his favourite ice cream flavour; delicious creamy chocolate ice cream with chopped Maraschino Cherries.
But Draco was having none of that, 'Yes, I'm sure!' he exclaimed. 'I'm as sure as I'm ever going to get. I don't care any more, even if you'd turn out to be Harry Bloody Potter himself, so kiss me.'
'Ron, wait,' he heard Harry tried to interfere. But he didn't listen and continued to the surprised looking blond: 'I don't know why you'd want to poison us after the way we welcomed you and Harry and I don't know why Harry would want to help you. You have him under Imperio, do you? You sick bastard!'
'Oh, Merlin! So amazing! Feels like flying,' Draco panted.
'I knew they'd tasted like heaven on your skin,' he said simply before he kissed him deeply. The taste of chocolate invaded his senses and it reminded him of …
All of a sudden he felt a wave of magic and he yelped when he felt almost all of his clothes slither off his body, leaving him standing in nothing but a pair of black pants.
There were two bedrooms with two twin beds each on the ground floor and three doubles on the upper, one of which was definitely a Master Suite.
Draco’s hands stilled. He closed his eyes.
“Hell yes,” Ron answered. “Harry?”
“Thank you, darling,” Blaise said, preening. “It’s immensely flattering that you view me as a threat to your aesthetic.”
Harry quickly downed the rest of his drink and set it on a tall table before turning back to Perry. Perry was… well, Perry was awful, if Harry was honest. He had no rhythm whatsoever, and his moves were oddly robotic. It was actually quite comforting. Freed from the pressure to actually look good, Harry busted out some of his most ridiculous dance moves—the ones he and Ron employed at weddings when they’d gone a bit too heavy on the champagne. Perry caught on immediately, and soon they were in an absurd sort of dance off involving moves like the lawnmower and the shopping cart. Harry was laughing in delight when he felt someone move in close behind him.
“Pansy, those shorts are
Harry’s eyes twinkled good-humoredly in the low light and began, his voice taking on the cadence of a storyteller. “So, I was still kind of panicking even after we’d talked, because I didn’t know who else might have heard and I was afraid something might get back to you. Ron was a total arse about it at first—kept refusing to tell me and laughing when I’d get mad about it—but he finally gave in when I threatened to stop babysitting.”
“...Not exactly. We were interrupted.”
friendly, per se. Not antagonistic, at any rate. But certainly not platonic. He blushed at the memories and then held a pillow to his face and groaned in frustration, willing his erection to go down.
“Oh.” Harry’s heart plummeted back downward, taking his stomach with it to land somewhere near his feet. “That’s… right, it’s fine, don’t—” He slid his hands from Draco’s neck and moved to step away from him, trying to hide his disappointment.
Harry shook his head and gave a huff of amused exasperation. He couldn’t help but smile, however, as he landed a final blow. “You’re sharing a room with Greg,” he said, pushing off the counter where he’d been leaning.
“Don’t bother,” Draco cut him off, waving a hand dismissively. “We both know you were lying about that assignment.” Harry’s eyes went wide and he hissed a ‘
“And they were all things you really liked or really wanted to try, right? Except for the escape room, but I can see why he thought that would be up your alley.”
Sullivan laughed.
“Fuck it, let’s try the tubes. It’s not like I ever got to try them as a kid, and I don’t think my ego can take another wipe out.”
“Do you want that list alphabetically?” Harry had asked, once he was able to process what she was suggesting. “Because I can’t do that off the top of my head, but I can get back to you.”
The pair watched, skating slowly side by side as the two children raced around the pond, laughing and yelling. Draco tried to enjoy it, but he kept thinking about Teddy’s reaction to his imminent departure. His mood must have been visible as his gaze tracked his cousin, because it wasn’t long before Harry broke the silence.
“Oh, yeah!” Leela chimed in. “Aren’t you, like, related to one of them?”
He thought of Harry in his workshop, carving this frame for him, knowing how important this moment had been to Draco and wanting to give him a way to keep it with him. Then his thoughts drifted, and he thought of Harry lifting Teddy to help him decorate the tree; of Harry laughing and talking with Teddy as he took him to do all of the things he’d never gotten to do himself as a child. And then—then, he thought of Harry warm and sleep-tousled and smiling. He thought of him grinning, hands in his pockets, backing away down a cold winter street after a kiss that had felt like home. He thought of him naked above him, eyes full of things that Draco hadn’t been ready to understand.
“Hell yes,” said Ron, his face alight as he made eye contact with an equally excited-looking Greg. Harry couldn’t help but smile fondly at the pair’s unrestrained enthusiasm.
There were also a handful of well-known faces that Harry welcomed with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Romilda Vane seemed normal enough when she greeted him, other than perhaps looking a bit starry-eyed, but Harry couldn’t help but think back to her disturbing attempt to drug him with love potion back in his sixth year. Cormac McClaggan’s arrival was a less than pleasant surprise, but he didn’t initially seem as arrogant as he had been when he’d briefly played for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, so it was at least possible he’d grown out of the obnoxiousness of his school days. Harry was a bit ashamed to admit to himself that although he hoped that he had, it was primarily because Cormac had grown up to be extremely attractive. The biggest surprise, in truth, was Gabrielle Delacour.
He was doing them a disservice, he knew. Perry wasn’t sharp around the edges, and he might veer a bit more toward a match than a balance, but he was definitely caring and funny and easy to be around. There hadn’t been much in the way of physical affection yet with Sadiyah or Leela, but that was perfectly normal at this point; they were just testing the waters. He still hadn’t had his one on one date with Sullivan, but from what he could tell, although he appeared to be more genial than snarky, he checked the rest of Harry’s boxes. On paper, only Hilde truly seemed like a mismatch at this point.
“Technically, they’re aquatic macrophytes,” Hermione told him without looking up from the nature guide she had apparently switched to while he was changing. “There’s a whole section in here on the various species, if you—”
“No, wait!” Draco cut him off, grabbing him by the arms before he could get very far. “That’s not what I meant.” Harry watched him warily. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, gripping Harry tightly to make sure he didn’t move. “I do. Mean it. I just didn’t mean to…” He shook his head.
“Erm… well, since you moved out there.”
“So?” Harry asked, turning on his side to fully face him, not releasing his hand. His heart was beating so loudly that he thought it might be drowning out the crickets.
“Hmm.” Blaise looked pensive, in a studied sort of way. “Too little in common in some ways, too much in others.”
for your twenty-seven-year-old son, who has been neither obligated nor willing to take orders from you for almost a decade, without even consulting him.”
Warning for general dating show shenanigans: lots of people touch Harry in this chapter in mildly-to-moderately suggestive ways, and he does not mind. HE’S TRYING TO FIND LOVE, OKAY?
Draco leaned in and kissed Harry one more time. “Absolutely.” Stepping back, he slipped past him and down the stairs, where he pulled his apron back over his head and resumed his decorating, trying not to laugh at the fact that Teddy’s hands, shirt, and grinning face were now almost completely covered in a fine layer of glitter. He
“Hardly.”
“Oh, that’s a good one!” Harry did smile now, and Draco laughed.
Sadiyah quirked him a sad half smile. “Well, we were all around when the elves went to collect his things, and the crew are terrible gossips. Usually it’s a bit fun, but…”
Harry stared at her, shocked. “And you didn’t say anything because...?”
“You still came to sleep in my bed, though,” Harry said, smiling a little, remembering Pansy’s exasperation at that fact.
“The pasta is already boiling. You don’t want overcooked pasta,” Harry insisted, smiling.
Finally, they reached the front of the queue. The bouncer checked their wands, spelled a wristband onto each of them, and waved them in, looking bored all the while.
He hugged her back, letting his cheek rest against her temple, her bushy curls tickling his nose in a comfortingly familiar way. “Yeah. I think so. Thanks.”
“Thanks.” Harry reached up and squeezed the hand still resting against his arm. Perry opened his mouth to say something else, but their little bubble abruptly burst as the show concluded and the lights around them came back on. Shutting his mouth, Perry gave him a small smile and moved away, letting Harry reintegrate into the group.
Harry stared at him. “What on earth are you talking about? Perry’s been nothing but lovely since he got here.”
He allowed himself to dress down a bit for the evening, assuming that Harry would prefer to keep things a bit more casual in his home, and arrived at Harry’s door promptly at seven once more, a bottle of wine in hand.
. It’s possible that Harry almost kissed me yesterday.”
“Goodnight.” Harry made his way up to his room, brushing his teeth, stepping into the shower, and absolutely not thinking about the feel of Draco’s flushed, slick skin under his hands.
Hermione ruffled his hair as she stood herself. “Don’t be stupid. Of course you do.” Turning to leave, she called back over her shoulder, “By the way, you should go shower. You smell like sex.”
“But stay for a while, let me get you a drink.” Molly bustled away, and Ron turned to watch her go before turning back to Draco and putting a hand on his shoulder.
Harry laughed. “I wish! But no, honestly, I have no idea. There are some people I’m more drawn to than others, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself.”
After graduating from Hogwarts, Harry had made the decision to move to Muggle London. He hadn’t cut himself off from the Wizarding world—not in the least—he’d just wanted a bit of privacy after everything. Being able to lose himself in the bustle of millions of people who didn’t care about him one way or the other had been a breath of fresh air after having his every move scrutinized for upwards of eight years. He’d also had a strong urge to do all of the things he hadn’t been allowed to as a child: go to movies and restaurants and the beach. Read books and listen to music. Eat whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Play computer games.
The slam of a door and the clink of a belt buckle
Two down, twelve to go! In tonight’s episode of The Bachelor: Magical Edition,
Perry gave a wry laugh. “Well, I won’t say it was fun. It’s difficult to realize that someone you think you’re starting to fall for has already fallen for someone else. But I don’t regret any of it. The whole experience was wild, beginning to end, and I’m happy that Harry found the right person for him, even if it wasn’t me. I wish him and Draco all the best.”
“Good.”
“Well, don’t these look nice!” Nancy exclaimed as they approached, and Harry beamed. Perry looked hesitantly optimistic, relaxing further when he cut them into pieces and they looked almost identical to Nancy’s samples on the inside. “Wonderful job, boys. Now, let’s see how they taste.”
“Well, don’t you clean up nicely?” Draco greeted him as he made his way to the hightop table Draco had commandeered. “I’m almost convinced you actually mean to give this a go and aren’t just here to make a point.”
“That might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.” Harry pinched Draco’s side and Draco wriggled, trying to shove him off.
“Luna!” Harry hissed, feeling, if possible, even more self conscious than before.
She leaned against the table, stretching her long legs out in front of her and smiling wryly. “Teaching. Young ballerinas might look delicate, but they can cause complete chaos without proper guidance. I’ve perfected my ‘pay attention, class’ voice.”
He stayed on the couch, curled into himself, for a length of time that he didn’t see any real point in quantifying. He was alone, after all, and he had the whole night ahead of him. His external stillness was a stark contrast to the turmoil going on inside of him as he struggled to process what Sadiah had said; her complete certainty about how Harry felt. He knew that he struggled to identify his own emotions, but he couldn’t have missed something as big as having fallen in love with Draco Malfoy, could he?
The sudden darkness frightened him. It reminded him too much of all those times the Death Eaters had used Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder to cover up their crimes.
Draco's heart started hammering against his ribs.

Author's Notes: Transferring another FF story. This one was written in 2010, and it broke all my personal records at that time; longest, fastest written and smuttiest. It had the most chapters, most reviews and alerts and it's still my favourite story. Never anticipated that I'd be able to write more than a drabble in English.
May it be as sweet and joyful and exciting as Chocolate Frogs a-jumping ;)
'Draco,' repeated Harry, granting him the favour. The Slytherin sighed and kissed him again.

"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
A scorching pain travelled from the jaw line to the side of the head, followed by the hot needle-like pain behind his eye. He rubbed the side of his face. Putting some pressure on his temples seemed to help. Malfoy stepped from behind the chair.
This version of it is mine!
It has undergone some modification (not the plot, just editing).
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
He tried to grab the boy and whirled around with waving arms. The thought that he must look ridicules only fuelled his anger.
But for some unknown reason he didn't. Didn't hex, didn't move, didn't speak a single word. He just waited, and held his breath.
Harry was stunned that Draco trusted him enough to share something so personal with him. In a way it felt even more intimate than sharing his body. A warm feeling flooded inside his body. Emotions, that were still small and fragile, but could become something more, found there way from his toes to his fingertips.
Draco tried to stifle a moan when the second cherry was crushed and the Maraschino flavoured liquid flooded his mouth. A third cherry, a fourth … he began to feel a bit dizzy although he didn't know if he should blame the liqueur or the kisses. He swallowed and his tongue slipped out. He licked across his cherry stained lips and was met by yet another cherry.
In three steps he reached Potter, straddled his lap and grabbed his wrists, just in case. 'So, if I asked you again if you enjoyed the distraction, you could lie?' Potter looked astonished for a moment but then …
'I think you could safely say that without my friends I would live like a hermit. Although I do enjoy other people's company every now and then, I like to wander around alone and observe others more.'
Magical Healing was a subject that Headmistress McGonagall had added to the school schedule of the eight years. While Draco felt triumphantly, the boy continued, 'I'm amazed with all the possibilities that magic gives us to heal children and how it is so much faster than Muggle medicine. I never considered it before, but maybe I'd like to have a career in healing.' His arm brushed against Draco's as if he was shrugging his shoulder.
Pansy's warnings still echoed through his head so it was quit a shock when the boy in front of him, said: 'My intentions aren't to hurt you, Draco.'
They stood there for Merlin knows how many minutes, kissing and touching, before they desperately needed some air.

'Patience,' Draco heard him whisper while his footsteps slowly disappeared.
But Muggles were the last thing on Draco's mind when a calloused finger brushed lightly against a nipple. A wave of pleasure was sent through his body and his hands snaked to the boy's back, so he could press them flush together. Their erections brushed against each other through the thin fabric of Draco's pants and the boy's trousers. They both moaned.

Author's Notes: Transferring another FF story. This one was written in 2010, and it broke all my personal records at that time; longest, fastest written and smuttiest. It had the most chapters, most reviews and alerts and it's still my favourite story. Never anticipated that I'd be able to write more than a drabble in English.
All, with the exception of Hermione who watched the girls with slight exasperation and rolled her eyes.

'You know!' It wasn't a question but merely a statement. Knowing Pansy often could read him like a Legilimens, he didn't bother to deny. He just nodded warily.
The fantasy was too much, and the feelings overwhelmed him, and he wanted … he needed … his whole body shuddered at the same moment that he realized the truth.
Guided by the enraged inner beast and Malfoy’s hand on his arm again, he let himself be led through the Manor.
He tried to come up with a clever question, but what left his mouth was, 'How do you find me every time?'
The redheads?
Potter opened his mouth and said: 'Sometime … he writes …'
Oh Merlin, now would be a very good time for the floor to swallow me!
'Uh… well, I suppose. I mean … do I look kind of blue?'
He hugged her briefly and went on with classes. From time to time he felt Granger's eyes upon him. It was obviously that she knew, at least some things.
When she looked around, it became clear that whatever was wrong, it only affected the Gryffindors close by. The Ravenclaws appeared to observe the situation with curiosity, the Hufflepuffs seemed on the verge to join and hug everyone and Slytherins scowled at the spectacle. But although she heard Malfoy shout: 'You must be joking!', she noticed that he was gazing intensely at Harry. For a moment there was something odd about his expression; slightly familiar but she didn't think she'd ever seen that look on his face.
He groaned softly. ‘Sorry to have bothered you then, Malfoy! Won’t happen again!’ He turned to leave, wanting to get away as soon as possible, but a hand grabbed his arm.
‘I happen to be the co-owner of the place,’ Draco said in a smug tone.
And then he kissed him. A sweet, tender kiss that took Draco's breath away. He didn't notice that the boy undid his buttons, until he felt cool fingers on his chest, sliding up to his shoulders, pushing away his shirt. After a short struggle he lay down again, the sheet cold against his skin.
They lapsed into silence while they ate their cheesecake and drank tea, which Harry found oddly comfortable. But eventually they were finished and when Harry looked up, Malfoy was watching him with interest. His eyebrow was raised as if to encourage Harry to talk.
At home? Malfoy was working from the Manor, too? Massaging wizard clients near his rooms? Where they could easily take advantage of him?
After a whole summer of thinking about Potter, dreaming about Potter and even – well okay, he'd admit it – wanking over Potter, this was a dream come true. He didn't know what caused the Gryffindor to act so strangely the last two days – even more strange than usually, he meant – but he recognized an opportunity when he stumbled upon one.
'Do you favour crowds or solitude?' Draco asked his next question. He found himself getting caught up more with wanting to understand this person then trying to solve the riddle of his hidden identity. The boy laughed softly. The sound of it still didn't ring a bell.
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
‘It’s nothing, really,’ Harry said. ‘There’s this kink in my neck because I fell asleep on the couch last night.’ At the same moment he felt his face warm up when he remembered just why and how he’d been in that position.
The same Malfoy who was still waiting with a raised eyebrow as if to say 'Yes or no?'.
‘What?’ Harry asked, thoroughly confused.
'Merlin, no! I wish we could stay together in this room. Wish you would always be this way around me.' His breath hitched.
Potter's eyes flashed and he clenched his teeth, but responded: 'She hasn't … we've … never …' He pressed his lips together as if trying to keep the truth inside.
Draco wondered if the wine would help against the tremors. Because he certainly hadn't required the wine for any other purpose, had he? He took his wand and pulled the cork out. No time for proper airating, he thought, as he filled both glasses to the rim. Although his body temperature was high enough as it was, thanks to the fire, he could use some Dutch courage, he decided. After all, he was already acting more and more out of character and didn't even know what Potter was going to tell him about the candy.

Despite himself, Harry couldn't stop looking at it. Throughout his eighteen years, he'd questioned his insanity sometimes on a daily basis, but this obsession was something else completely.
‘Wait,’ Harry protested but the house-elf had already disappeared and Malfoy, his hand still on Harry’s arm, guided him through the door and into the Manor.
Still standing in the middle of the room, Harry sat down in the nearest arm chair. Unable to resist, he switched off the voice of Ron in his head that screamed: ‘Poison!’ and ‘A snake will always be a snake’ and took a bite.
The feeling of their cocks against each other, separated only by their pants, made stars explode behind his eyes. Helplessly he started moving against the other, rubbing franticly. The boy pressed his lips in the curve of Draco's neck and kissed the faded hickeys he'd made earlier. When Draco tried to shove his leg between the other's thighs, he made a small sound in the back of his throat.
‘How can I help the great Harry Potter, defender of the wizarding world?’
Harry pulled his hand out of Malfoy's pants and tenderly cupped his chin instead. His thumb caressed the pale skin. Slowly he lowered himself so he could slip his other hand along Malfoy's neck and tangle his fingers in the silky looking blond hair.
'You could,' the Slytherin replied. Their mouths were hovering above each other and Harry kissed him. It was nothing like earlier kisses. The feel of Malfoy's lips was amazing, their texture and pressure and how they moved slowly against Harry's, the longing almost tangible. Malfoy parted his lips and touched Harry's tongue with his own. When Harry gasped in surprise, Malfoy slipped his tongue into his mouth and began mapping every nook and crevice he could find, with an accuracy as if he tried to store them in his memory for ever.
Ron finally couldn't take any more. He pushed the door open and barged inside, his wand in his outstretched hand.
Harry said nothing for a few moments. He seemed to ponder about something and Draco waited, although he stepped a bit further into the room and closed the door.

'Potter,' he moaned.
‘Raspberry, white chocolate or black cherry, Potter?’ Malfoy waved his hand with a vibrant flourish at the side table. It was only then that Harry noticed an assortment of the most amazing looking cheesecakes he’d ever seen. This time it was his stomach that rumbled.

Harry joined in with the others and laughter echoed from the walls of the Leaky Cauldron.
He scowled at Malfoy, but the man arched his eyebrow again which rendered Harry speechless.
Draco was trying to determine which Ravenclaw the familiar voice matched when suddenly he smelled the sweet scent of flowers. He sniffed and asked curiously: 'Did you bring roses?'
The mental picture haunted him for the rest of the day. How would it feel against someone's fingers? If someone were to stroke their lips alongside those soft hairs? If Malfoy would kiss someone?
In the window behind the Slytherin, Harry saw his face; a horrifying blue face! While his eyes almost dropped out of his blue head, Malfoy's hand cupped the bulge in his trousers and said huskily: 'It seems you'll need more distraction.'
He smiled and intertwined their fingers. ‘Yes, you were,’ he answered.
He wanted to get up, but was afraid he’d be revealing more than he already had; there was only so much his pants could confine.
‘So … you thought I would try to save your mother, didn’t you? Or maybe save you from working at a beauty salon?’ Harry asked with a hint of curiosity coloring his voice.
It's what makes me keep writing ;)
'So you got one experimental candy each day for the last four days. Never at the same time. You don't know when and you only know what they do or for how long when Weasley explains it in a letter.' He ticked off every fact on his fingers while he paced in front of the fire. 'Am I right, so far?'
'But why me?' Draco asked, knowing that now he'd only one question left but not caring anymore. He was unaware that his own thumb was stroking the boy's hand.
‘But … but I heard you didn’t have a wand, and that you worked in a beauty salon?’ Harry shook his head with incomprehension. Why would Malfoy work with Muggles if he didn’t have to? Another thought crossed him mind. Why would Hermione nag me about returning this wand?
In order to distract himself, he let his mind wander back to last evening.
'What would you do if I had?'
The cheesecakes looked creamy, and smooth, and rich. Moist layers of cake and soft, fresh cheese were covered with fresh raspberries on one, and shiny black berries on another. But Harry’s eyes were caught by the white chocolate cheesecake, which was swirled with chunks of dark chocolate bark, topped with white chocolate mousse and finished with chopped dark chocolate.
‘Malfoy,’ Harry started, unsure of what he wanted to say. He still didn’t know what he was doing here. It was very unsettling to say the least.
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
‘WHAT?’ Harry blushed when he realized that not only had he drawn the attention of all of his friends, but most of the other customers as well. ‘But … how … why?’
His lips closed over Potter's earlobe and when he sucked on the tender flesh he heard his breath hitch. Potter's reaction made his heart beat faster. While his tongue traced the rim of Potter's ear, his hand trailed the waistband and then moved southwards. He squeezed Potter's cock through the thin fabric of his trousers and found that Potter was already hard. His throat got dry and his trousers too tight. He released the abused flesh he'd been nibbling on because he had a sudden urge to see Potter's face. Their eyes locked. Potter's were wide, the green darkened to nearly black. He looked almost desperate. Desperate for what? Draco wondered. For more? For an escape? He squeezed again and watched with interest how Potter pulled his lip between his teeth.
‘How do you know?’
He didn't know what Malfoy saw in his eyes, but suddenly the Slytherin captured his mouth and kissed him. When Harry let out a surprised gasp, Malfoy took the opportunity to slip his tongue inside Harry's mouth and slide it against his. Harry whimpered and the sound only seemed to encourage Malfoy. The fingers in Harry's hair tightened and he felt an arm wrap itself around his waist and pull him closer.
'Ah, come on, Draco,' she pouted. 'Since when don't I get to look at your fan mail?'
His courage seemed to have left him; as Draco felt the hand slip from his neck.
Harry pondered over the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' candy he just ate. He didn't actually feel as depressed as he should, but if even Malfoy found he was looking down, then that first Moodwing he took obviously worked.
He took his wand, casted a cleaning charm on himself, and pulled his pants and trousers back up. He wanted to grind his teeth, but that didn’t sit well with his neck. With a sigh, he went to the kitchen.
For a moment there was silence. Hermione expected to be ridiculed but except for Harry, whose eyes had grown even larger, nobody seemed to take notice of her. Even Ron only had eyes for Harry and yelled: 'So when are they going to give you the Order of Merlin, first class. If anyone deserves that it would be you!'
‘Ah, the Chosen One has a taste for contrasts,’ Malfoy said. ‘Surprising, Potter, I would’ve pegged you for a raspberries kind of guy.’ He levitated a respectable wedge of the white chocolate cheesecake onto a saucer and handed it over to Harry. After he had handed out the tea he sat down with his own cake. The chocolate cheesecake too, Harry noticed.
'No, wait, Draco! You don't understand,' the boy sounded slightly desperate, 'I just didn't want it to end so soon. You're so hot and I've wanted this for so long. Kiss you, hold you, touch you!'
'You too … too many clothes,' managed Draco to say. The other seemed to understand as another wave of magic now prickled his almost naked skin.
His fingers tightened in Potter's hair as the Gryffindor murmured against his lips: 'I've wanted to do this for days. Wanted to touch you the way you touched me.'
'What?' he responded in a defensive tone. 'I was surprised! It's not as though they could humiliate me by kissing me in the dark or take pictures or anything. The fact that I might have kissed him back doesn't prove that I'm into boys. So blackmail is out of the order.' She stared at him in disbelief. 'They could've done Merlin knows what, Draco! You were alone, in the dark and you didn't even have your wand on hand.' She glared. 'And don't snicker like that.'
‘Are you sure?’
‘Ah!’
He remembered vividly the times he'd taunted Potter that he didn't have a family who'd want the Boy Who Lived to come home. And look at
'Chocolate Frogs,' he exclaimed breathless. The boy chuckled but didn't answer. Instead he started to remove every trace of the candy from Draco's body.
o~0~O~0~o
Malfoy looked at Harry as if he were insane – well, even more than usual – and said with disdain: ‘After all you’ve learned you honestly don’t believe Ollivander is the only wand maker in the world, do you?’ He shook his head in disbelief and told Harry: ‘We went to Monsieur Arceneau in France right after the trials. He may not be as well-known as Ollivander in the British wizarding world, but he’s just as good.’
'Don't worry, Potter. I'm not going to harm you. I won't even try warming you up. Just want some answers about that candy,' he said flatly and continued to drag the other along.
But Draco only focussed on the words that
‘Is this the way you treat all your clients? Not that I’m a client or something,’ he said. ‘I didn’t know what to expect, it was my first time after all. ’
Malfoy looked up at him with an expression that Harry had never seen before.
It has undergone some modification (not the plot, just editing).
'No!' he quickly denied. 'I was just thinking out loud.' He had to keep a clear head in order to find out who this boy was. 'What's your favourite subject at Hogwarts?' That would eliminate a few candidates.

A hand touched his cheek and a familiar voice murmured softly: 'Hi.'
(See the end of the chapter for
Apparently the Slytherin considered that a yes, because he took another two steps and without hesitation grasped his shoulders and slammed their lips together.
Draco knew the boy was more solidly built than he was, had strong arms, and longer hair. The fact that he was interested in Magical Healing didn't ring a bell however. The eight years all shared that subject and there was nobody standing out in class except for Granger, but that was nothing unusual.
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
After Harry'd almost fled the Great Hall – really there was no other word – she'd asked Seamus and Dean what had happened. Other than some teasing about Harry having a date, they didn't have a clue.
It didn't take long. The friction between their erections grew wilder as they neared completion. He felt it in his balls and low in his spine and he was not the only one who was close. Potter was shaking badly and making mewling, pleading little noises just before Draco thrust a final time. He felt his knees buckle and the wetness that was seeping through his trousers. But most of all he felt pure bliss. He couldn't even start to remember when he'd felt this good, this content.

To keep away from that line of thoughts he stepped closer and took a better look.
There would have been a time that just the thought would have made him angry, but this time it gave him hope.
If he hadn't been afraid to get caught red-handed, he would have indulged himself right at this moment, just like he had last night, on the bed in 'their' room, as he had began to name it.
'It's – I've been noticing – Are you growing a beard?' he blabbered. He felt his cheeks flush and closed his eyes in horror.
‘Have a seat,’ Malfoy said as soon as Harry stepped into the room again and he pointed to one of the chairs in front of the fireplace.
The sound of the cupboard doors reminded him of the spare hangover potion he kept in his kitchen. Just for occasions like this.
He could almost hear the boy smile when he answered that indeed, he did bring roses with him. 'For you.' His voice sounded a little shy and Draco's heart jumped a little.
‘Yeah!’ Malfoy breathed. ‘But … we should … bedroom.’
Draco felt him lean in. He could hear his heartbeat in his throat when the boy breathed against him lips: 'Feel them.'
'That wouldn't help, now would it?' Then, more sincerely, Harry added: 'But maybe I could hold you until you stopped shivering and I could kiss you without my tongue being bitten off?'
'Are you questioning my ability to make a decent potion?' Draco replied. He cursed and Ron heard that he threw something on a table. 'That damn knife!'
I hope you've enjoyed this.
Draco gasped. Involuntary he lifted his hands and his fingers groped about until they found the heavy fabric of a robe as if to anchor himself. Just when he considered kissing back, the wet lips left his and pressed little, teasing kisses, on the corner of his mouth, over his jawbone, and up to his ear.
So Harry said, albeit reluctantly: 'Maybe.'
'Potter?' His voice sounded hoarse and a bit anxious. He'd known that it would be over as soon as they were done, but he hadn't expect to see those eyes filled with guilt.
The faceless people who went for a massage from Malfoy everyday. The thought was clawing at his insides like a wild animal trying to break out of his cage; after all this time his chest monster had woken up again.
Apparently Malfoy found something, because the next moment he stepped closer so their bodies touched, and crashed their mouths together. Malfoy. Was. Kissing. Him!
‘You were a virgin?' Malfoy asked, shocked.
When he opened his eyes reluctantly, Pansy was watching him with an thoughtful look in her eyes.
Harry, however, couldn't explain it to them. He didn't want Hermione to start analysing this obsession he'd gotten. And he certainly didn't want to see the look on Ron's face if he told him that he was fascinated by the little white blond hairs he'd seen on Malfoy's once-smooth chin all of a sudden during the Quidditch match last week.
He felt the other tense beside him before he responded with a guarded tone, 'As long as you don't ask anything regarding my identity.'
The rose was placed next to his fingers and then he felt another one stroking his throat. When the rose petals touched the three bruises lightly, Draco whimpered. It felt like he was being worshipped, by one rose after another. A fourth, a fifth, a sixth … the sweet flowers surrounded him everywhere.
'Wow!' Draco breathed. 'And it wasn't even topped with whipped cream.'
He found Hermione and Ginny waiting for the boys to go to breakfast.

'Expelliarmus!'
'Are you sure this is the right thing to do?' Harry asked.
An explosion of taste erupted in his mouth – crushed, buttered biscuit, the fresh cheese, the sweet white chocolate and the bitterness of the dark. A moan escaped before he could help it.
The words wouldn't come. He'd always learned how to demand, not to
Ron shrugged his shoulders and asked Harry about his last assignment.
He paid no attention to the chair which had tumbled to the ground. His eyes were fixed on Draco, who had stood up at the same time. He slowly walked around the table and approached Draco, who tried to look less nervous than he felt. He stepped up to him so close that Draco could feel his body warmth. Time itself seemed to stand still.
Nevertheless, when he opened his eyes, there wasn't anyone to be seen. In fact, everything around him was pitch-black again.
I hope you had as much fun reading it as I had while (re)writing :)
Pansy, though, was doing a bit of thinking herself.
'It's a book, Weasley! I'm sure you've seen them sometimes while making out with Granger?' Malfoy mocked him.
Even Hermione seemed interested. Harry, however, was just speechless. He stared at Dean with his mouth hanging open. Draco Malfoy visited a Muggle establishment? He could see the ponce in a beauty salon, sure, but a Muggle one?
'What if he hadn't been alone? What if it is only a trick to get you to trust him? He could hex you next time!'
'You know that wouldn't work. She's too smart for that, Harry!'
'It from that stalker, isn't it?' she whispered in a sharp tone.
'Your eyes are so beautiful,' another one said.
'You know I haven't gotten any 'fan mail' in a very long time, Pansy,' he told her. The thoughts of fan mail and Potter at the same moment in his mind, made him a bit flushed however. It was all she needed to press for more information.
'Feeling blue, Potter?'
'Well, I just did, okay! No big deal. Probably lots of people have.' Harry didn't dare look Malfoy in the eyes. 'It just looks different. Than mine, that is. Softer, I mean.'
He wanted to move, to run away, but he just stood there, his hand lingering in mid-air.
This version of it is mine!
I hope you've enjoyed it :)
‘So now you’re handing out memorabilia? I get to have my wand back from the great Harry Potter?’ Malfoy scoffed. ‘Well, you know what, I don’t want it!’
The boy chuckled. 'Maybe later?' He gave Draco a final kiss and stood up.
Hermione watched how Harry's eyes grew wide with horror, after he'd put some kind of candy in his mouth. He looked as if he was ready to bold. She wanted to ask him what was wrong but what came out of her mouth instead was: 'Harry, you're the bravest person I've ever met. If you want me to do your homework for you just ask me!'
Malfoy’s hungry kisses and his firm body pressed against him made Harry succumb immediately. There was no possible way to fight this. Years of hating the Slytherin, yet obsessing over him at the same time, fuelled his own response.
When he heard Dean and Neville laughing about some joke, the near catastrophe in the dormitory came to mind. Why hadn't he been able to keep his mouth shut? Or at least told them a lie.
'Oh Harry,' some fifth year girl said and she looked ready to faint, 'you should be on the cover of Witch Weekly every week.'
Something large and scaly erupted in Harry’s stomach again and a sudden madness got hold of him. Nobody was allowed to bathe with Malfoy, to see all of that smooch, pale skin, and watch how much his blond hair would change from silvery to gold when it was wet.
The boy laughed again and gave him a nudge. 'Straight on to the big ones, right?' He hummed for a bit but then carefully said, 'I have a magical object which shows me where people in Hogwarts are.'

As he rounded a corner he almost fell over someone who was huddled up against the stone wall. A face was lifted and green eyes stared defensively at him.
Draco raised him arms, desperate to keep him from escaping again, but the other was faster and leapt backwards.
'Draco,' he said softly. Nothing else. Just his name, but it sounded like a prayer.
I'd love to hear your thoughts about the Moodwings. I have planned any more parts for the future, but if I get some good idea's from you for a new Wing, perhaps I might ;)
The tremors seemed to have decreased because Potter reacted without faltering: 'Fuck you, Malfoy!'
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
That night as he wanked, he imagined it was Harry's hand that squeezed his cock. When he spread the moisture coming from the slit over the head, he imagined it being Harry's tongue. He thought about how Harry had done just that the day before, how he probably had looked at him from between Draco's thighs, his hair the usual mess, his glasses awry, and those vivid green eyes looking at him with passion, while he screamed his name.
'I'll go get the redheads and you'll sharpen the knifes.'
The steam exuded a wonderful scent. It drew Harry closer and without conscious thought he stepped onto the wooden steps, wondering how many clients had sat in that hot, steaming water, and if Malfoy had joined him.
He pauzed as if waiting for Draco to react.
He squeaked when he was suddenly pushed down on the bed. Sprawled on the cool, untidy sheets, his vision still gone, he waited for the other to join him.
He was still considering how he could refuse that in a … well, chivalrous way, when his mouth opened and he blurted out: 'If I want to have some fun, I'd rather go snog the Giant Squid!'
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Draco stilled. 'You didn't want to leave me?'
Harry tried to press his lips together but Malfoy was too close and the wing was still working and his traitorous mouth opened again. 'Yes.'
Happy New Year!
'You're so beautiful!' It sounded awestruck as if the boy couldn't believe he was able to look at him in such way. Draco felt his cheeks flush by the overwhelmed tone. The mattress dipped and then the boy was cupping his face in both hands.
'For a person who claims to have waited so long to touch me, you're not very eager to get me on the bed,' he complained, with an attempt at a bit of levity.
Malfoy snickered. ‘Problems with a roaring lion, Potter?’
'Well,' she said, 'what are you waiting for?' She nodded to his fist where the letter was getting more crumpled by the minute.
'NO! I mean, it was my first massage.’
, had been confiscated by the Ministry; just two days after his parents were hauled off to Azkaban. The lump didn't want to disappear. And that bloody tinsel made his eyes water.
Malfoy sighed in desperation: ‘I meant your clothes, Potter, not the chair.’ He took his wand and cast the spell himself, on Harry, and on the chair.
But again he wasn't the first to arrive. When he opened the door the room was already dark. Briefly he wondered about the magical object that obviously made it clear he was coming.
Harry moaned and writhed on the bed, while admitting to those crimes, but his eyes belied he was feeling very sorry.
Although those quills were quite inventive and erotic – he'd loved to know more about that spell – he'd discovered he'd missed the boy. The soft voice, the sweet kisses and the gentle, yet strong, touches.

'You almost got me, Harry.' When he went down to the common room, Harry was still a bit bewildered. What the hell possessed him to tell them that? Seamus would tease him relentlessly and Ron would kill him if he knew what happened. Or at least throw up.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Could it be possible that a boy – not a Slytherin – liked him? Really liked him?
I can't believe this little story already got so many hits and kudos after just four days! I really appreciate it.
Harry looked into the same silver-grey eyes he’d thought about just yesterday and blinked for a moment. By Merlin, he hoped that he wouldn’t blush. To avoid those damned eyes he let his own travel over the man. A pristine, white shirt, which looked like it had just been ironed, underneath a black jacket, matching the trousers. The man looked impeccable. Like … he had a date? Harry’s chest monster woke up and rumbled warningly.
'I couldn't lie!' The words although nearly whispered, rang in Draco's ears and made him dizzy when he recalled the things he'd asked Potter.
'Don't worry, it's me,' a soft voice said.
Bloody hell, Ron thought, what in Merlin's name is going on? He didn't know who Malfoy – they – held hostage, but he didn't care; he had to do something. Anxious he leaned in and listened, while he reached for his wand.
Pansy had given him more and more complaints the last few days about the fact that he was constantly missing. It was getting harder every time to get away without her noticing, so he had gotten to the room right after breakfast this morning and spent a few hours in front of the fire with a book he'd brought.
He tried to remember who'd been near, but was distracted when the other shyly added: 'Although I really would like to kiss you again.'
Even better, Harry decided, after Malfoy had drawn Harry’s body towards his. The feel of Malfoy's erection pressing against his own was simply amazing, even –
Draco wondered how the boy was always able to find him. He didn't want to be an easy score, even though he was anxious to meet the other again. So after diner that evening  he went looking for an abandoned classroom to hide. He found a place that was dirty, and gloomy, and filled with school-desks, old armchairs, a cabinet, and lots of other knickknacks.
‘Are you really working as a masseur in a beauty salon? A Muggle salon?’ He blurted out, and immediately cursed his thoughts for sending him this way. Malfoy looked at him for a moment, a smile ghosted his lips.
Harry could almost hear a blond eyebrow crawl upwards. ‘No, yes, well, of course not,’ he denied half-heartedly. ‘I just think you ought to watch out for people who might have an ulterior motive for wanting a massage. Some might even have bad intentions.’
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
be at, because we’re doing all of the new player announcements.”
“He’s always here for Christmas!”
Draco smirked. “Told you. Really, has no one ever taught you about personal care products?”
They spent the rest of the afternoon bickering good naturedly as Draco bossed Harry around, directing him to separate the pieces by color and then grabbing them out of his hand half the time to do it himself.
He turned from the window to face her. “Well, I’m having a nice time.”
“Oh wow,” Ginny breathed as they drove further into the dense forest.
After enduring a several-hour chewing out by Montague, Harry was feeling exhausted, guilty, and just generally awful. He couldn’t bear the thought of going back to Ron and Hermione’s to face Ron’s pity and Hermione’s disappointment. All he really wanted, he realized, was to see Draco.
Draco had stepped even further into Harry’s space now, smirking. “Leather’s a new look for you,” he commented. “Trying to be a bad boy, then?”
He heard Draco laugh beside him. “Well, you are extremely stupid, I’ve always said so.” Harry snorted. “But,” Draco continued, “you’re also one of the
“Nudity is nothing to be ashamed of,” Luna observed airily.
Sadiyah looked over at him. “I don’t mean this in a rude way, but you’re surprisingly well adjusted for the sort of childhood you had.”
pleased to meet you.” It came out embarrassingly breathless, but he couldn’t help it.
“Hey. No. I’m sure twelve-year-old me would have thought so,” he said, trying to inject some humor to lighten the mood, “but I promise I’m much more aware of the invasiveness of the press, now. It’s why I’ve never bothered having the
His monster growled and Harry had the sudden urge to jinx those strangers into jelly. Unfortunately his lower body was in disagreement with the creature in his chest. The thought of Malfoy’s long, pale fingers on firm buttocks had caught the attention of his cock, which seemed to be very interested.
He stepped up to the front door and knocked. When the door opened, he automatically looked downwards, but to his surprise, he didn’t see the big, hairy feet of an house-elf, but a pair of expensive leather shoes and some neat, black trousers.
'Hufflepuff!' he scolded himself for lacking his usual self-confidence. But his arrogance was merely a sham these days and he knew it. He also knew how people looked at him in these post-war times.
He applied more pressure to the muscles, but it wasn’t painful. In fact it was anything but. Malfoy chuckled when a blissful groan escaped his throat. Harry expected a ‘Told you so’ but the man just went on kneading and moulding his back muscles until Harry felt like putty in his hands. And why was that thought not as repelling as it should be?
Harry wanted to react but it was hard enough to try and keep his emotions in check when he felt Malfoy’s fingers combing through his hair in search for a bruise or swelling.
This version of it is mine!
'I – I need – ' Even though he never finished his sentence the boy knew exactly what it was he needed. He increased the speed of his mouth.
As he heard footsteps approaching, he shifted to sit up. The familiar soft voice halted him though, 'Please, wait.' Curiously he lay down again and waited for the boy to reach him. The boy sat down next to him on the bed, took his hand and asked, 'I would like to blindfold you this time. Do you trust me?'
Even if they didn't know his name, his distinct looks gave him away as a Malfoy.
Finally he said slowly, 'Yeah, I trust you.'
‘… not a visitor. He works there according to Dean!’ Ginny giggled.
Harry struggled to get up from that blasted massage chair, which wouldn’t have been easy, even if Malfoy hadn’t put his hands on Harry’s chest and pushed him back. The traitorous monster laid down and purred.
‘Because I can assure you, I am very good with my hands.’ Something wicked suddenly crossed Malfoy’s features. He stood up, walked over to Harry and offered his hand. Totally stunned, Harry let himself pull up.
'W-where?' came the next question.
‘My, my, someone’s happy to see me!’
His patience was rewarded by a gentle touch on his cheek. Just like last evening the other boy cradled Draco's face in his hands and angled it before lips were pressed against his. He didn't hesitate as much as the first time, but kissed Draco like he, too, had secretly hoped –
To Draco's astonishment the boy leaned in and licked a trail from his abdomen to his collarbone.
‘What the hell, Malfoy?’ Harry yelled, looking around in bewilderment for his Vanished clothes.
What? Butterbeer spurted from his nose while he looked with wide-open eyes at his best friend.
o~0~O~0~o
‘But …’ he started, ‘… but how did you know Dean would go with her?’ But then he remembered the girl has lost all her relatives in the war during a Death Eater raid. ‘Oh.’ He berated himself for asking and tried to retain his composure. Malfoy was still watching him.
Panting for breath he looked up. The Gryffindor's face was lined with tension.
He considered pulling his hand away, but then thought better of it, he wanted to get the upper hand before the boy became aware of it. That was his explanation and he was sticking to it.
The silence that followed didn’t last longer than four seconds, and then Dean was bombarded with questions.
Harry recieves another Wing from George. Hermoine has started to notice strange things.
Instead of laying him down, he put Draco to his feet and started undressing him. He moved reverently. He ran his hands down Draco's chest and tugged at his shirt. Warm, searching hands slipped beneath the hem, up along his chest and onto his back.
Time seemed to have stopped. There were no masks this time. Harry felt like Malfoy could look right into his heart. Yet he had no desire to shut his feelings down, whatever they were.
Hermione came to his rescue and explained in her no-nonsense voice: ‘Well, it’s kind of logical, isn’t it? The Ministry did seize large amounts of money and properties, so I suppose he can’t live off of daddy’s money, like he used to.’
Potter looked like he wanted to start a fight but all the shaking must have exhausted him, because he only nodded.
'He what?' exclaimed Pansy astonished. Draco scowled at her because Madam Pince looked up from the tome on her desk with an irritable expression.
‘I can’t sit there,’ Harry protested, ‘I’ll wet it and ruin the fabric.’
He was really turning into a lovesick Hufflepuff, wasn't he? Just six days and this boy had him wrapped around his finger, and he still didn't have a clue who he was. He scowled into the blasted darkness and decided to act up like the Slytherin he was.
Harry expected Malfoy to show him what was behind the curtain but the man surprised him again by crossing the room and stepping outside, through the open door. He stared at Malfoy in obvious confusion. Was he playing tricks with Harry? First he didn’t want his wand back, then he wouldn’t let him leave but served him tea and cake, and now, after a tour about the Manor, he wanted Harry to go outside instead of showing him his working area?
‘So, why do you have that special chair?’
When an unfamiliar owl dropped a little package just beside Harry's plate, the nagging and joking started again. Harry felt so relieved that George hadn't sent his own owl this time, that he just smiled while Seamus said something about a secret admirer. The seventh year girls close by heaved a sigh and told each other how romantic that would be. Only Ginny scowled and stabbed viciously at her scrambled eggs. Harry sighed and focused on the letter that had been tied to the package.
Draco couldn't have anticipated what the twelve days of Christmas would bring him.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
‘How often do you treat patients at home?’
'Why the darkness?' he blurted out. 'Do you still see me or can we both not see each other?'
His fingers pressed into the naked flesh of the boy who reacted by bucking against him.
What? Harry tried to read Malfoy’s expression but the man just stared at him without giving anything away. He didn't know what to make of it. It was unnerving.
Harry wondered why Malfoy wouldn't spell the facial hair away. Was he afraid it would become more abundant and coarser, vain git that he was? Or did he deliberately let it grow? But why? He tried to imagine the Slytherin with a stylish goatee, which would undoubtedly call attention to his lips.
'Did you enjoy your dessert last night?' the boy sounded almost shy, which was a bit odd, considering the fact that he just tied him up to the bed. The thought made a certain part of his body heat up more than the spell had done. When he heard a smile at the next sentence he knew the other had noticed it. He nodded, feeling embarrassed and aroused at the same time.
, Draco thought with a stifled moan, when the boy swiped his tongue roughly over the pale pink nub of a nipple. He thumbed the wet surface while licking the other as Draco's hands clenched around the ropes. He suddenly stopped and Draco wanted to scream and curse the boy but the other merely moved over to his legs and started nibbling on his thighs. But it wasn't before long that he moved back and kissed Draco again.
Only when Ginny desperately shouted: 'Harry, I belong to you!', could she suddenly grasp what she'd seen; Draco Malfoy'd looked just as hurt as Ginny had the other day!
And then their tongues met, and he gasped in surprise, making it easy for Harry to slip his tongue further in Draco's mouth. He started exploring every sensitive place. Someone made a groaning whimper but he couldn't say who made the sound.
Ah, the wand!
she continued.
Shouting 'what the fuck?' he had pushed Malfoy away so hard, the Slytherin had stumbled and fallen against the brick wall. Harry had fled like Umbridge for a herd of centaurs until he was in his room, where he'd laid down on his bed, panting. From the stairs of course! Not because of Malfoy. Just the stairs!
'I have discovered that I really enjoy Magical Healing,' the boy said thoughtfully.
The Gryffindor looked intensely at him as if he was searching some answers. Something tugged at the corner of his mouth but Draco was afraid to hope for a smile. Just when his lungs began begging for much needed air, Potter opened his mouth. 'No, I wouldn't. And yes, I did.'
'You keep away from my family, Malfoy!' he shouted.
The high-pitched squeals coming closer from the girls dormitory drew his attention back to the present. Afraid Pansy and Daphne would bother him next; he decided to escape to the empty class room already. Maybe he could take a nap again.
Although he was almost certain who had sent it, the tawny school owl that waited patiently, confused him for a moment until he remembered that Potter's Snowy Owl had died in the war.
Are you just as excited as Draco to find out what he gets on New Years Day? ^^
Just as he was dozing off a little, the room went pitch black again. His heart jumped up. It was amazing how just in one week the boy had changed his feelings about the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder from anxiety to anticipation. The awareness seemed to make the darkness a bit softer, if you could say something like that.
‘Of course it’s good, you twit. Although I'm not surprised to hear it. Malfoy house-elves obviously have standards to uphold in whatever they serve to our guests,’ Malfoy stated. He was looking like the arrogant sod that Harry remembered again.
Suddenly hands grabbed his wrists and stopped him.
Harry's last thought for a long time was: 'He tasts sweeter than a Moodwing.'
He would never tell a soul – not even Pansy – but in hardly a week the boy, Pot – Harry, had captured his heart.
He felt awkward and asked slightly defensively: ‘What? It’s good.’
Draco tried to keep his expression blank, but his heart jumped up at the thought of a next time. 'Don't you think he would've hexed me the first time if he'd wanted to?' he asked scowling. 'But if it sets your mind at ease, I'll ask for his intentions the next time he kisses me.'
Hermione had told him that it was just sixth year all over again, but Harry disagreed. This time he didn't think Malfoy had evil plans and he certainly didn't follow the Slytherin everywhere to see what he was up to, he'd said.
Draco shook his head and rolled his eyes at that last statement. 'Gryffindors!' he said. He didn't bother asking Potter why he hadn't gone to the Gryffindor tower but decided that this was an opportunity he couldn't pass.
Spending a whole year at Hogwarts was one of the conditions of his parole, and with his parents in Azkaban Draco hadn't cared much where he'd spent the holidays.
So there he was, in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor, with Draco Malfoy who was pouring two cups of tea while he politely asked: ‘Raspberry, white chocolate or black cherry, Potter?’
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
When he heard his given name, Draco gasped into Harry's mouth. His hands had found their way to Harry's arse and he squeezed. Harry could feel his blood pulsing in his crotch, when Draco’s voice – barely a gasp – started chanting Harry’s name.
He didn’t even protest when Malfoy manoeuvred him around so he sat with his back to the cushion, and adjusted the headrest so Harry’s head was lying comfortable again. It wasn’t until Malfoy started talking, that Harry realized the vulnerable position he was now in.
Malfoy had been right, Harry thought few minutes later. He certainly did know what he was doing. Worried that his chest monster would interrupt the comforting treatment, Harry tried to focus on anything but the question of what could have caused such expertise.
'Malfoy,' Harry murmured between kisses.

‘Sorry, Hermione, it’s been a long day and you’re explanation made me think about …’
Harry didn't know what to make of that statement and his chest monster was confused.
Harry put up his hands in mock surrender and decided to remain silent. At least until he’d finished the cake.
Draco made an indefinable sound and the other explained, 'A Muggle expression.'
Fuck! Not a wise action.
Fingers glided to the nape of his head and pulled him closer. Before Draco's mouth would be occupied, he asked, 'Can't you tell me who you are?'
Draco turned towards him. He didn’t seem insulted, like Harry would’ve expected, but he smiled a little. His mouth was swollen and Harry wanted nothing more than to kiss him again. Draco must have sensed it, because his eyes turned a molten silver again. He leaned in and softly pressed his mouth against Harry's lips. But before Harry could deepen the kiss, Draco leaned back and said: ‘No, I don’t. I’ve never invited anyone in here.’
At once Harry forgot all about feeling down. This was brilliant! Why hadn't they done this before? Eagerly Harry participated until they were both out of breath. Dazed he looked over Malfoy's shoulder and then screamed in horror.
‘Don’t you dare, Potter!’ he warned him. ‘This is a silken shirt and it will be ruined beyond repair if it gets in hot water.’
'For how many days?'
She gave Harry a short, but meaningful look before she continued: ‘And besides, he doesn’t have a wand of his own anymore.’
, Draco told himself, while the lips pressed a bit harder against him. However, that action got delayed when he heard that humming noise again. The scent of their mingled breaths flooded his senses and he felt dizzy for a moment. He startled when the lips suddenly left his, the hands fell away, and he heard feet shuffling backwards. Something rustled in the empty corridor and a voice, a bit hoarse, whispered, '
It was fortunate that the Slytherin was quite intelligent and understood him so well, thought Harry, when they shuffled towards a four-poster bed. As they stumbled onto it, Harry climbed on top of Malfoy, dizzy from lust. Draco arched his hips, grinding his erection into Harry's.
Hands slid down to rest upon his shoulders and, to his surprise, teeth began nibbling on his ear. The hot breath on his ear made him dizzy, and his own hands - as if acting on their own – found a waist to hold on to. Absently he noticed that the other was more solidly built than he was, but then the boy began peppering a trail of tiny kisses along his jaw, distracting him. Draco whimpered and wrapped his arms around whomever it was that kept kissing him in the dark. He bent his head to the side in anticipation and the boy didn't disappoint him. He began nibbling on the other lobe like it was a gingerbread cookie.
‘Potter!’ Malfoy exclaimed, in a shocked voice.
But the mention of chest monsters immediately brought his thoughts back to Draco sodding Malfoy. In a lavender uniform, which would look ridiculous on someone else, but would only highlight Malfoy’s silver blond hair. Something his clients would most likely appreciate. His chest monster roared its disapproval. The idea that Malfoy would put his hands on Muggles was repulsing. Since Harry never had a massage himself, he could only imagine where Malfoy would put his hands; on some stranger’s shoulders, probably, or on their back, and maybe lower on their buttocks. Soft and feminine, or firm and masculine.
‘Well, well, isn’t this a surprise,’ a familiar voice drawled. Harry’s head snapped up and a sharp ache shot through his neck again. His vision blurred for a moment and when he opened his eyes Draco Malfoy was standing before him, looking obviously amused, and maybe a bit curious.
'N-no,' he started, looking more and more despondent by the minute. 'You don't … understand … that candy …!'
Hermione looked apologetically at him and handed him a paper napkin.
'It has come to my attention that you've been acting very weird since you've taken a Bludger to the head.' Malfoy cocked an eyebrow and Harry watched in fascination as the action made the little blond hairs above his eye move.
'Yeah?'
‘Oi, Hermione, let him enjoy his Butterbeer. You can push Harry into doing that again tomorrow,’ Ron said from his other side. Hermione grumbled something, turned her back to them, and started a conversation with Susan.
Harry let himself fall on the couch, too exhausted to climb the stairs yet, and too intoxicated to Apparate without the risk of splinching himself. ‘I shouldn’t have taken those Firewhiskeys Seamus kept offering,’ he grumbled to the empty room.
With a little help the boy managed to pull his arms from the sleeves. He was startled however by the next spell.
‘Is there something wrong with working as a masseur, Potter? Or do you think my hands are unworthy of touching anyone, be it wizard or Muggle?’ His expression had changed from amused to guarded, and Harry hastened himself to deny that statement. But the thought of Malfoy’s hands touching wizards and Muggles made his chest monster growl again.

'Out of a misguided feeling of responsibility or just Gryffindor foolishness you ate candy from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?' he asked rhetorically. Potter glared but Draco lifted his eyebrow and smirked.
Malfoy went to stand behind him and took Harry’s head surprisingly gently in his hands, before Harry heard him say: ‘Has no one ever told you, size really doesn’t matter?’
‘Brilliant!’ Harry repeated. ‘Where?’
'Do you have all the candy?'
The hands stilled only for a nanosecond. ‘It doesn’t belong to me anymore, Potter. It wouldn’t listen to me as well as it used to do. Besides –’ He hesitated a moment. ‘– I don’t want to be reminded every day about the things that wand did.’
The boy chuckled, but Draco was too busy chewing the chunks of sinfully rich dark chocolate to respond. He wondered how in name of Merlin's lacy garters the other knew he simply loved this frozen dessert.
'Same time every day?' Shake.
The smell of coffee was coming from the kitchen and Harry debated what to do. Embarrassment told him to hide in his room, but the hammering sound in his head demanded he face his house-elf and get some coffee. He was brave. Wasn’t he? Well, that’s what people always told him anyway.
Harry tried to keep his monster at bay but knew he had failed when Malfoy’s hands stilled and he asked: ‘Jealous much, Potter?’

Little feet or maybe paws tripped over his skin. The more rustle he heard, the more he felt moving. He was confused and excited and a little horrified at the same time.
And please, don't hesitate to point any mistakes I might have made. Especially since English isn't my native language.
'Wait!' The single word hit him like a Bludger in the stomach. The other obviously wanted to push him away and he had enough of it.
Harry squeaked with an embarrassingly high voice when all of a sudden he was naked, with the exception of his pants.
The boy walked towards the bed and then Draco felt the mattress give way. While a hand scanned the contours of his body until it found his head, the boy responded: 'You can smell them!'
‘I know,’ she said, ‘I shouldn’t have made that comment earlier, but I don’t understand why you just won’t give it back to Malfoy.’
Although Harry had a great evening, once in a while the thought about the monster in his chest crossed his mind, and he wondered why the beast had risen after all this time. If he remembered correctly, it had erupted into life in Harry’s stomach during sixth year when he and Ron had caught Ginny snogging Dean.
Suddenly 'the kiss' was on his mind again. Well, to be honest, he hardly had
This version of it is mine!
When nobody answered his knock on the backdoor, Ron carefully opened it and stepped inside. There was no one in the kitchen, but he heard familiar voices from the back room. Remembering the last time he'd barged in – he still had nightmares from that sight – he hesitated by the door. A loud voice in the other room startled him.
He saw surprise and triumph flitting in the depths of Malfoy’s eyes before he closed his own in embarrassment. Expecting a humiliating comment, he was completely flabbergasted when he felt thumbs caressing his nipples. His heart skipped over and then was racing again. So fast he felt dizzy, and so, in order to prevent himself falling off the chair, he grabbed Malfoy’s upper arms to steady himself.
The boy chuckled lowly. 'Did you like it?' The question turned into a moan, when Draco buried his hands in soft hair and pulled his head back. Draco's nose bumped into a firm chin and he nibbled on it before he leaned in to lick a trail to the boy's collarbone. The hiss it elicited sent awave of energy surging through him. Franticly he began to tug at clothes, cursing the darkness, that prevented him to find the buttons any faster.
He took Potter by the arm and pulled him up.
'But I can't see them,' he complained.
o~0~O~0~o
‘....’
His eyes lingered on the last word. He thought about his sister, who didn't cope very well with her ex-boyfriend leaving her for Malfoy and who had evidently become more and more dependent on Dreamless Sleep Potion.
The clean, citrus scent from an expensive cologne wafted towards Harry’s nose. The smell was tempting and begged him to come closer. It moved to his brains and short-circuited his ability to talk. Instead he shook his head.
Harry was startled by the familiar voice that came from the alcove he just passed.
The admission surprised Harry. He looked into those silver-grey eyes and asked: ‘Why?’
Draco exhaled slowly before he answered. ‘It’s for mother,’ he said. ‘Ever since the war she’s been having these neck pains and headaches and the Healers at St. Mungo’s won’t treat Death Eaters, so I studied Muggle treatments, learned some massage techniques and set up that room.’ He gestured towards the door they had come through. ‘Father doesn’t know.’ He added.
'Seventh floor,' was all Draco replied. Surprisingly, Potter stopped asking questions and attempted to walk beside him. The only sound he made was the chattering of his teeth.
Of course Malfoy immediately did that stupid thing with his eyebrow and Harry wanted to give him an annoyed look but to his horror, he discovered that he was getting aroused.
So, it had to be a Slytherin. He just started contemplating the seventh and eighth year Slytherin boys, when he heard something rustle softly nearby.
He did what he promised. Draco never saw the b – no, Harry during the rest of the day. He talked to Pansy, who surprisingly told him, just for once, to go for it. Not for the family name, or out of fear, but because he seemed to want it.
‘Brilliant!’ Harry panted.
Something rustled and all of a sudden he felt something on his chest. And it moved!
‘Why, Harry, I don’t recall admitting to be working there.’ Draco sounded amused.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘Ever heard of a Drying Spell, Potter? The perks of being a wizard, you know?’ Impatiently, he pointed again. ‘Or should I consider that proof of the fact that you did indeed bump your head?’
Draco stretched his arm and felt around he got a hold of the boy. He pulled him in his arms and kissed him softly. 'I don't want to lie to you, or make empty promises, but I'll try to keep an open mind and keep in mind what I learned about you, okay?'
He closed his eyes, not able to meet hers, and wondered, not for the first time, why people thought Pansy was dense. He should have confided in her a week ago, maybe they'd have figured it out sooner. But a voice in the back of his head told him that he probably would have hexed Potter and then he wouldn't have gotten this chance to get to know him.
