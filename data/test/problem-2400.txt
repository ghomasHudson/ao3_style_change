“Fuck it.” That hardly seemed an appropriate response to Draco’s well-considered argument. Draco was about to say so when Potter continued, “But I’m still curious… why would they admit you as a student when you have a Dark Mark?”
Only with Harry’s briefs did Malfoy linger, holding that last garment in both hands as he brought the cloth to his face and
“Why is this box closed?” Draco asked when he reached the desk.
Harry nodded.
“Are you sure you don’t need me to heal something else?” Draco asked.
“No, I’m not. And I don’t think you’d enjoy it if I was. I don’t think
His careful focus was interrupted when he heard the creaking of the door opening in front of him, but Harry didn’t think that had been caused by his quietening magic.
“Anyone would’ve done that.”
As they moved closer to the living room, Ron and George sounded like they were teaming up to fend off an enthusiastically affectionate Pygmy Puff. Harry smiled. It was probably just as well that Draco couldn’t knock him up, the family Harry already had was enough of a handful.

don’t want to.”
“Potter. An ink blot does not constitute legible writing.”
Once again, Potter had rendered Draco speechless.
Feeling steadier when objects once again had clear outlines, he raised his gaze to look at Draco.
When silence fell again, Harry pushed a tendril of magic out towards Michael; merely a gentle nudge to remind him what Harry was capable of and try to promote honesty. He waited a few moments while his power ruffled Michael’s hair, then asked another question, “And what happened when he spoke to you?”
“Don’t feel the need to rush,” Draco replied in a voice which Harry thought had been meant to be scathing but hadn’t quite managed the venom.
“I don’t much give a shit, Draco. But if you want me to stop, just say so.”
“Yeah.” He lifted his head to look at Malfoy again, keen to show that he was serious. “Like you mentioned, I have a fair bit of time on my hands now. Maybe a project will help me not to dwell on the… other stuff.”
“Uhuh. I suppose.” Harry was worried though, that this might give the wrong impression. “I don’t want to do more than… I did there.”
This could be more complicated than Draco thought, if he’d be required to deal with a jealous ginger. It was best to know upfront, so Draco enquired directly, “Are you and Weasley… a couple?”
Draco placed himself immediately in front of the couch where Potter could be sure not to miss him.
Draco tried to correct his mistake. It shouldn’t be so difficult, was just a

Potter tipped his head to peer into the gap between cotton and Draco’s stomach. “Every bit as pretty when it’s not wet.”
Not Malfoy. Harry hadn’t been angry with Draco, not really. He’d just been the only person available to yell at. Malfoy didn’t appear to be pushing him for an answer, so Harry reviewed his options. Harry did have a vast team of lawyers within the Ministry… but it was probably unlikely that they’d help him to work

him before my mind cleared.”
whore. To be willingly used as desired.
“No… you don’t need to go anywhere,” whispered Draco.
“Your presence… assists me. I need you.” Harry scrunched his brow, trying to understand how that could be. “Life is better when you’re around. Now, I’m required to put up with a more unfortunate strain of Weasley tomorrow, so I’m going to need some beauty sleep. I must look my best if I might have to obliterate a ginger person.”
“I… the letter,” Harry began as Draco drew his wand from his sleeve. “It was from Michael.”
He doubted that Snape considered himself to be Draco’s Head of House anymore. And McGonagall certainly didn’t. She had welcomed Draco into her fold with frosty reluctance but made it abundantly clear that she wasn’t responsible for him. So, Draco dwelled in limbo between the Houses, given accommodation by one, accepted by none.
“Hold this.” Luna thrust a light blue silk handkerchief into his left hand. “It belongs to Mr Plonkengarret.” At Harry’s questioning gaze, she added, “Personal belongings gather a little of their owner’s individual magical signatures. It helps to create something tailored to their needs.”

Harry was so taken aback by the suddenly salacious tone of Luna’s voice that his hand twitched, and he almost dropped the wand. He gaped, but she was halfway out the door.

issues at all.
A nudge to the left side of Draco’s ribs brought him out of his musings to notice that his breath was fogging Potter’s glasses.
help. So, I helped. That’s all.”
“Come here. Unclasp your hands and crawl to me,” Malfoy instructed.
Harry squirmed. The pressure from Draco’s motionless groin had been maintaining the growth of Harry’s erection, even during the unfortunate interval. He tried an upwards thrust, but it didn’t seem to be inspiring movement from Draco, so Harry enquired, “
Harry waited for Lucius to notice the change. He didn’t have to wait long; Lucius angrily stood, snatched up his cane from beside the desk and turned away from Harry with a grand sweeping gesture that reminded Harry of some of Draco's mannerisms when he was in an extravagant mood. The painted man stomped towards the left side of the scene and halted abruptly. Lucius looked elegantly befuddled, but swiftly changed direction and strode to the other side. Halted again.
Harry supposed not. It was logical. But Harry had trouble applying logic to this subject.
“You all right?” Draco enquired.
“But you know they’re already aware of that. And besides, it only makes them keener.”
He had no clue what a snarfkler was, but he’d keep that in mind.
“Did he?” whispered Harry. The question sounded more ominously hostile than he’d intended.
however
So was Harry. He couldn’t believe it, but Harry was going to come on Draco’s arse and Draco was going to come in Harry’s fist, and Harry had done this of his own accord without any sign of manipulation.
. Harry had become an expert in pulling out orgasms from the men he was fucking. He’d been so keen to get each incident over with that he’d put effort and dedication into learning what actions produced the best results and efficiently implementing them. Granted, every man was different, no one set of rules worked for all, but over the years Harry had also become accomplished in noticing individual reactions. Seeing and feeling tiny tells which would inform Harry of what his partner preferred. The key though, had been to not
The sunroom delighted Harry. He liked the open space created by the huge windows and colourful foliage which overshadowed his own conservatory at home with both intricate beauty and design. And there were many nooks and crannies built into the space where a seemingly endless assortment of wonderful small objects had been deliberately hidden to be discovered. But he wanted to see Draco happily flicking through piles of books, so he chose the library.
Connected. He felt connected to the wood and to the sliver of plant within it. Like there was a direct link from Harry, through the wood and straight down the core. He wasn’t sure how to describe it, but it was strong, balanced, secure.
Held in place, Harry didn’t know how to respond as Draco began to rock against him. But Harry’s cock knew; of course, it did. The length began to fill as a lovely, low level of pain blossomed in Harry’s scalp, Draco’s fingers dug in through the denim of his jeans, and teeth nibbled and nipped at Harry’s jaw and neck.
for sentimentality.
, to make sure I learn my lesson well.”
Impaled by what felt like just the tip of Malfoy’s erection inside him, Harry had a way still to go. He gingerly lowered himself, using his thigh muscles to control the movement. Malfoy’s hands remained on him but offered no further assistance to his descent.
“I’m not taunting you, Draco. You’re right, no exam results can change anything on their own. But you can take what’s sure to be your perfect grades and then walk away.”
Another sigh. “I know.”
“What did I do to deserve a personal escort home today?”

“That’s right. Thank you for being honest.” Being

deep. And
“Do you think someone as worthless as you could be a decent whore for me, Potter?”
“Spit in my palm.” Eyes widening, Harry gasped. “This is your only chance.” Harry paused, unsure. Dirtying Malfoy’s skin seemed disrespectful. “I won’t offer again. You have until the count of three. One, two…” Somehow, Harry managed to desperately gather enough saliva to spit in Malfoy’s palm during the last second. It didn’t look very much. The hand cupped and retreated.
Harry watched as Draco opened the bottle in his grasp and poured a liberal amount onto Harry’s palm.
Harry slid to the edge of the mattress and stood on shaky legs. Draco was looking extremely pleased with himself as Harry toddled unsteadily towards the pile of clothes upon the chair.

As requested, Draco didn’t come any closer. Instead, he took two careful steps away. Harry felt guilty about that too.
“So, should I?” she asked.
credentials?”
Michael seemed a bit upset about that, Harry observed as the flaming wand still grasped in Michael’s fist was waved frantically through the air. Oh, well. Harry dropped a disillusionment ward and silencing charm around the area in front of the shop to prevent any distress from passers-by.
“I told you, dear. It’s not happy.”
“Umm,” Potter started, but didn’t continue.
Another tut. “But that's not for you to decide, is it?”
“I know that I’ve said this before, but you don’t need to be doing this. Let someone else stress over all this crap. And I thought your first meeting this morning was meant to be the first step in arranging that. I spent ages completing that paperwork for you. Didn’t you give it to them?”
Unable to think of anything better to say, Draco asked, “Should we go back inside?”
Fidgeting awkwardly, Harry felt like he was stalling on Draco’s behalf. He knew that Draco had destroyed the other portrait of Lucius, but he understood why Draco couldn’t take this final step himself. This was the only remaining active link to the man that Lucius had been. Although Harry was more than willing to follow through with his promise, removing the last trace of Draco’s father was no insignificant act.
“Do you still think of… that as an option?”

“Minister Potter,” a low voice drawled from behind him. Harry closed his eyes at the familiar tone. On reflection, that probably should’ve been predicable. Against his better judgment, he turned around.

Harry didn’t quite believe that though, even now. No-one worked in the Ministry for three years because they thought Harry was… what, attractive? Utter nonsense. Harry had learned that there was no point disputing it with Draco though.
“Do you need help with it?”

“Yes, Draco. Practically perfect in every way.”
Harry barked with laughter. Bloody hell, Harry loved him. Although he couldn’t say the words, it was no less true.
“You have two more strikes remaining to receive, and you will
Potter looked abashed. “Sorry. I just…”
Malfoy took a step back and extended his arm in a graceful arc of almost theatrical encouragement. A silent gesture of trust that Harry had regained enough control to safely accomplish the task.
“Yes, but I failed to think it through properly.” That was becoming a worrisome habit. Potter looked confused, so Draco expounded. “You’re… you, and I’m Marked. The fact that they’re allowing me to attend the school doesn’t mean anyone trusts me. Even if I did do you a favour in Potions one day. Everyone will soon forget that.” Draco knew that one noble act wouldn’t change the outcome for him in the long run. “And Death Eater or not, I'll always be a despicable Malfoy. And you’ll always be their Saviour. The two will never be complementary or acceptable within society.”
Harry imagined that he could hear Draco’s voice.
“I’ll take that under advisement,” said Draco.

“Okay… I’ll repair them.”

Well, Harry’s day, his
Harry stayed fully sheathed for a few moments, using the respite not only to let Draco adjust, but also to control his own level of arousal. But Harry needed his vision; this time would also be invaluable for learning. Opening his eyes, Harry shifted his hips in tiny motions. Locating the prostate was not enough, Harry was searching for the most appreciated angle. He watched every twitch of Draco’s body and expression. Listened to the pitch of his gasps and groans. Felt each shudder, squirm, and other physical response to Harry’s presence.
Potter didn't even blink once. Draco has been looking into his eyes for such an unusually long time now, these past couple of days- So much staring and now-
He's going to suffocate- That's certain, he's going to die.
He wonders why, out of all people, he has been commissioned
Anything.
"Are you stupid?!", he shifts in his seat, and notices Madame Pomrey peeking at them, "It's not a good idea." H esays in much lower voice. "Things can change and this vow- This vow can be the end of us at some point. And we'd need a third party for that, anyway. So. Think of something else."
"Fine."
She was nervous. Mother told Draco once that when they were kids, Aunt Bella would get very nervous around their father. It was quite hard to grow up in such an aristocratic family, and even though Bella would rather die than admit it, the pressure coming from high expectations would always take a toll on her. Especially if she was the first child.
Potter rolls his eyes and reaches to his pocket, taking out a not-opened-yet pack of tissues.
How much Draco would love this, for someone to come and save him, take him away from this all, make him feel safe. If it could be as simple as that, this someone could even be Potter.
Nothing even akin to this comes.
It's going to be fine. Maybe they will work it out. Draco doubts it, but-
Draco eyes Potter, unconsciously squeezing the wand in his hand.
"Let's not talk about Sirius."
Potter visibly seems to relax, his shoulders slouch down and Draco could swear he lets out a breath he's been holding in.
"I need to kill him."
Draco nods.
"Shut up, Malfoy. I just wanted a place where we could talk in peace." Potter walks to the table. "It looks like we've got hot chocolate."
He felt the wizard coming closer along with the snake.
He doesn't feel safe even in one bit.
"Because-" Draco feels confused. He doesn't know whether he should tell him the truth or lie, it feels like it would be better just to not say anything. However, Potter is there, anticipating, and Draco can't find a good explanation. He just thought he will be able to talk Potter out of this idea, that he will say no and that will be it. He didn't expect he will need anything more than this and now if they go there, maybe Potter will see-
"Shhh! You smell, that's why I'm asking."
Draco just straightens up and gives the boy before him a once-over.
"Also- You've just said-"
"Why don't you understand there are things that overwhelm people, even the wisest and the bravest?"
It's bullshit. He can't control it.
need to cut my hand."
The steps get closer.
He hopes it will work out. Mixing his blood with Potter's and holding hands with him aren't things that Draco would exactly eager to do if it wasn't for the good cause.
He just smirks, knowing he's being watched.
"Did you really forget that we are wizards, Potter?" Draco raises an eyebrow. "There's plenty of things that can make us keep our promises. Keep us from betraying each other."
"What has got into you, Malfoy? Are you suddenly respecting people?"
"Did someone die?", she inquires with apprehension in her voice, and her brows furrow so strongly they nearly meet in the middle of her forehead.
He's had enough. It's not like Potter cares, anyway.
"You mean Bellatrix?"
Well.
Draco runs his eyes around the room. He can't think, he doesn't have thoughts- There's just breathing and the certainty that he's going to end.
Potter seats on the floor.
He wants to push her away.
"Let me eat. You keep saying I don't eat, but when I try to, you successfully stop me from doing so."
"What? I just wanted to help you get up."
Madam Pomfrey hums and turns her back on Draco, heading to her office once again with the big bottle of potion. Draco thinks that she must walk a tremendous distance every day, going between her office and the hospital room time and time again.
"I just thought about her and all these times she would brag to me about her killing this-"
Draco snorts.
"I- I-"
"That I didn't expect."
"I-" Draco doesn't know what to say. He's scared of the consequences. Hell, he's not even scared, he's terrified out of his mind. What's going to happen if he tells Potter all of this-
Potter nods.
"Whatever." He speaks finally.
Draco knows what they have to do.
Draco turns so that he lies on his back and looks at the ceiling. Maybe it's because he is so tired that he feels as if this day didn't happen at all.
"Let's get into the business, shall we?" Potter asks, taking a seat on the coach.
Draco feels awful and pathetic because he can already feel his eyes water and Potter doesn't take all of this seriously, which is what Draco should have expected-
"Okay. So, to sum up, you are a Death Eater, Malfoy- Okay just don't get mad at me for this, I'm simply curious. We followed you in Nocturne Alley, was it then-?"
Narcissa let out a loud, shaky breath.
It's just breathing. Draco can breathe, he does it all the time.
But there is a chance, the slightest possibility, that Potter decided to just now, at last, let demons do their thing and screw Draco over. It could happen.
Draco stands up and ignoring his pounding heart, he starts to roll up the sleeve of his shirt, staring at confused Potter. Not even blinking once.
If there's something Potter values more than anything in this world, then it's his family and his friends. Even Draco knows that. He swallows audibly, reminds himself that he can still use obliviate on him if there will be a need to, and raises his eyes at the other boy.
"You know this is Lucius' favorite."
The sudden shift in Potter's demeanor makes Draco's guts twist.
He inhales deeply and exhales slowly.
"Well. I heard you. It wasn't normal."
Draco snorts.
"Where is my wand, Potter?"
"Great. If you'll need anything, just call me."
Potter snickers. "I can't believe you're like this."
He doesn't fit there, and now he knows it. He got the Mark and didn't feel a bit happy because of it. Of course, he could brag about it to Slytherins whose parents were Death Eaters as well, and it could mean something to them, but these people didn't know- And Draco wasn't in the place to enlighten them.
Draco is not dying.
"What's so funny?"
Potter looks at the ceiling with annoyance.
She glanced up at Him and Draco thought she looked like a beaten puppy if that term was anything near appropriate to describe her with.
"I won't disappoint you."
"How are you going to do this?! Do you even have any idea what-" Draco bites his lip, it was close. If it keeps going like this, he's going to break, tell fucking Potter everything, and then regret it.
"No, I won't, you will cast obliviate at me the moment you get it. So no," Potter shifts in his seat, turning more in Draco's direction," I'm not giving it back to you until you've listened to me and we've settled something."
But of course, it's the Potter who managed to get Felix Felicis during the potion class.
Potter blinks a few times, visibly confused.
"Let's get you off this floor, okay?"
Draco doesn't protest. Potter takes Draco's mug and places it on the table, then-
Potter clears his throat.
He feels so exhausted.
It feels good to say it out loud. It's like Draco -at least for now- can stop pretending that he stands with all the cruelty happening.
The air gets heavier and for a while, the only audible thing is silence interrupted by Draco's loud, still ragged from crying, breathing.
"I don't fucking ca-"
"To humiliate us. Or more to punish us." He opens his eyes. "Don't think I'm stupid, Potter, he has so many people that could do that instead of me. You don't have to search for long, he has my Aunt-"
At least Draco was finally certain who dragged him through the snow next to the Shrieking Shack in the third year. It must have been Potter.
He looks back at the floor. It's not spinning. Nothing is spinning.
And this breathing, he's going to suffocate-
The second thing he sees in the morning (first was Madame Pomfrey who had woke him up to give him some water and meds) is the door opening on their own, but it isn't something that surprises Draco the most. It is the fact that soon after that, Potter's head appears right in front of him, and Draco nearly chokes on the potion he's drinking.
Fuck.
"Won't you say anything, Draco?!" A note of hysteria in Bella's voice, who has got up by now, made Draco even more paralyzed.
Potter rolls his eyes, snorting.
Draco didn't look up. He was too scared. He didn't want to see these eyes or face again.
"Of course not, my Lord."
"Yes, Malfoy, I heard that."
Draco sighs. He really wishes Potter wasn't present in the room.
"I told you, my Lord, Draco is also an excellent, ambitious and young wizard, am I right, Cissy?"
Potter's voice is small.
Potter stands awkwardly above Draco, who's still sitting on the floor, curled up into himself.
"I see. It's done, I don't want you to help me, and I can't see why you'd want to help me anyway. This whole thing is suspicious and I'm seriously losing my patience, Potter. Stop. It's not going to work "
Draco wanted to run away.
"We must be really in need, then. Normally it takes much longer."
"Is it better?" Potter's voice is so soft Draco has issues with believing that the boy is talking to no one else, but him.
The door is made of dark wood and looks old, like any doors to classes in Hogwarts.
"What? Are you-" he nods his head in Malfoy's direction-"planning on crying all day long?"
At last, his vision gets clearer, and he sees that he didn't manage to knock Potter out as he tried.
Draco snaps his eyes at Potter.
His head doesn't hurt, but he feels rather uncomfortable laying on the cold floor.
"It was your idea, Potter, and we've already settled for it. So say it. If I agreed to that shit, then you do that too."
"I know. Take your time." With these words, Potter turns on his heels, striding to the door, and when he's finally there, he stops. He bows his head, taking a deep breath.
Draco rolls his eyes.
Draco turns from side to side on his bed, unable to sleep. He thinks about everything that has happened.
Draco shakes his head and hides his wand in the pocket of his pants.
Potter just snickers.
"Why not?"
At that, Draco raises up and his eyes gleam for a fraction of second.
"Ron and Hermione don't know. No one except me knows. I'm saying the truth, I just want to help you."
Draco comes to the conclusion there's nothing left to do but to erase Potter's memory.
"Okay, that was a bit out of place," Potter mutters, visibly perplexed.
"There have been better days."
"And you can't destroy it, it will last until we die? Are you sure, Malfoy? We'll be bound by that for the rest of our lives." Potter clearly tries to talk Draco out of this idea.
"No, I have not."
"We'll figure it out, I promise."
"Now you go, Malfoy, or I'm going to kill you myself."
"I think- I need you to pull me up." He mumbles in spite of himself.
Draco feels hopeless. There's no one he can turn to, not that he doesn't have anyone. The reason is, he frankly can't. It would ruin everything if he tells anyone, he's going to be dead, and take his family with him to his grave. He can't allow this, ever.
"Did you call me by my name- When I was- You know?"
"Just so we're clear- What's the problem, Malfoy? Is that why you're crying or-"
"Don't change the topic."
Draco nods, not looking up.
"I didn't-"
." Draco's voice is just shy of a whisper.
Draco nods, trying not to focus at the feeling of their blood literally mixing and their hands touching.
Draco can feel his heart picking up the pace. It won;t end well if he gets angry.
He remembers when Mother came into his room the day he had come back from Hogwarts.
The woman gives them a warning look and leaves with the sound of her footsteps echoing in the room.
Draco clenches his fist around his wand, ready to protect himself if there will be a need to.
Draco wonders why all of the places they could possibly go to, The Noble Potter wanted to go to the Room of Requirements. Going there would be the most stupid, along telling Potter about his mission, thing Draco could imaginably do.
Potter clenches his jaw and slowly hands the wand to Draco.
Potter looks puzzled.
Potter sits cross-legged in front of Draco.
"What I'm talking about-" Draco pauses for a second, leaning on the backrest-" is blood pact."
But he could be wrong. Nearly certain is not good enough.
"Can't you leave me in peace for a day?"
"I know you're uncomfortable, but trust me, I am as well. It's for your own good, so try not to be crass."
Draco did as he was ordered.
"Fine." He glares back at Draco. "I promise to trust you."
Potter keeps glaring at him impatiently.
But Draco doesn't want his help. Draco doesn't want anyone to die.
Objectively, Potter could use Draco's weakness against him. Draco was terrible, he admits. And Potter hasn't been a saint either.
"Do you want me to pull you up or do I just give you my hand?"
Draco's scalp hurts, he's been digging his nails into it this whole time.
Draco feels his heartbeat speed up even more and his throat getting tighter. He's afraid to speak, knowing very well his voice will sound breathy and unsteady if he does.
Draco takes a deep breath.
He's there, sitting next to Weasley. Strangely enough, Granger is not with them.
Calm, maybe, but that's only because of the meds.
"Wait, Malfoy, shouldn't you be happy-"
Maybe now-
"And what? Am I supposed to let you cry until you choke on your fucking tears and die?"
"What do you mean exactly? We can't do the Ubreakable Vow, we've talked about this."
The voice is so loud and annoying. Draco wishes he could just open his mouth and tell Potter to fuck off.
Draco snorts.
Draco rolls his eyes.
"Are you talking about yourself?"
"Why are YOU doing that, not me?"
As if it was a reason to kill.
Potter's eyes are so green.
"I already said I won't do it. I won't tell anyone."
"I'm sorry, I really mean it, Malfoy."
The Dark Lord seemed to read his thoughts because He gave Bella her wand back and called His snake closer.
"None of your fucking business."
"Stand up and give me your left arm."
Draco follows it with his eyes, mouth slightly agape, focused as if nothing else mattered at this moment.
"Okay. Stop being annoying and speak."
Just a while more and he's going to be there. No one is going to interrupt him, no one is going to ask questions, he will be able to just calm down and get himself together. Just a little more.
His hands are so itchy- he wants to scratch them, but he can't move them.
Draco just nods, not looking at her, he's already hid his face behind his hands. He only hears the wheezy sound of Myrtle disappearing in one of the drains.
"Yeah, yeah, if I wanted to kill you, you would have been dead by now. Just- Just get this over with."
"I understand." Potter nods.
This is so exhausting. Why did he even want to help Draco in the first place, if he had known he was going to behave like a spy and not a helping hand?
"Something is wrong and I want to help you."
Draco tries to suppress a smirk.
"What now?"
"Why are you doing this, Potter?"
He thinks about Severus. The man for sure has sworn to his mother to protect him because he told him that if Draco doesn't know what to do, he will do the job. It's certain that he wouldn't do that out of his goodwill, or because he's a good godfather.
Draco purses his lips.
He is
Draco hides his face in his hands.
Potter's mouth falls agape, and all he does is stare. The silence is unbearable for Draco.
Draco doesn't protest. There's no point, he's defenseless and helpless without his wand.
She patted Draco's cheek and went to the cabinet with alcohol. She got a bottle of whiskey and chugged from it right away.
Potter, stubborn as he is, stares at the ceiling.
But then, Snape would enter his mind, read his thoughts too, and that Draco can't allow. It's not like he would learn it in a week anyway. Legillimency is difficult as fuck.
Potter opens his mouth to say something, then shuts them. Draco waits.
"Have you even eaten breakfast?"
"You could have killed Katie. You're lucky she survived." Potter speaks in a low voice while glaring daggers at Draco, and it's more disturbing than if he started to scream.
Draco rolls his eyes.
Draco then realizes that Potter has a point, the quick action caused nausea in his stomach.
"But-"
"I'm so tired." He mumbles more to himself than to Potter.
He dreamt of this. Of some hero coming for him and taking him and his family somewhere far away, where no one can hurt them. He wished for it to happen, prayed for it.
It was even worse when his father was absent. With him, they felt as if they had some sort of protection. In the end, it was Lucius who believed so firmly in the Dark Lord's ideology. He didn't have a particularly close relationship with Him, unlike Aunt Bella, but still. Draco felt more at peace when his father was with them, because that way, he could do all the talking. He was the one speaking for them, always, regardless of whether they wanted it or not.
"Do you think it will be enough, Potter? Because I don't think that words will work well in our case."
"Why would I believe you?"
"You promise you won't betray me, turn me in or try to screw me over in general, Potter. You'll do what you can to help me and let go of assumptions you've made about me through all these years."
Cinnamon.
"Of course it is, but I don't think that these dark circles under your eyes are natural."
To the last words, Potter gives a small nod and it seems like he is very pleased with himself for some reason. Maybe he thinks he has Draco all figured out.
"Like a high-five?"
He turns so that he lays on his back and looks at the ceiling.
"Ouch!"
"Just- Your hand is so cold," Potter mumbles, pointing his wand at Draco's palm, and then his eyes land on the black tail peeking from the sleeve-

It was interesting to Draco that no lions leapt to Potter’s defence. Instead, Weasley kept his head tilted down towards his book and Granger sat quietly, regarding the exchange in curious silence while the rest of the occupants seemed to be doing their utmost to pretend that nothing of interest was occurring. Draco often marvelled at the alternate universe in which he now lived.
Not knowing how to cope with this particular aftermath, Harry offered a vague shrug.

Malfoy's fingers brushed across the wetness on Harry’s left cheek, a light touch so different from anyone else’s. It was the same touch that Harry had sometimes felt in quiet evenings, when he’d been exhausted from his demanding schedule and on the brink of sleep, too tired to contemplate anything other than to lie in Draco’s arms.
“And how can you help us, Lucius?”

to be doing that?”
Perceptively, Malfoy commented, “I seem to remember that you don’t like this building any more than I do.”
Harry blinked up at him, trying to clear his head. “Huh?”
“Harry,” Malfoy interjected, “you don’t need to do that.”
to relinquish the role. And that he’d never wanted it in the first place.
Written on the document was that day's date and time, and below it read:
It was delicious. The insistent inward shove stretched him to the perfect edge of painful. Harry was aware that despite his words, Malfoy was being careful not to damage him. At least during that first inward slide. Malfoy shoved in gradually but ceaselessly until Harry felt the tickle of pubic hair against his arse and basked in the glory of being filled.
“I made my first wand,” Harry said, keeping his answer simple.
“Very good, Potter,” Draco said in a lower volume as he walked down to stand next to Harry. “We’ll knock that false sense of duty and obligation out of you yet.”
it when he did that. The primal expression of completion almost ripped out Harry's climax with Malfoy's, but Harry frantically delved deep for willpower and somehow prevented it.

It wasn’t necessary to ask what ‘that’ was, but Harry would be surprised if Michael didn’t understand
The drivel which Potter had spouted was an absurd daydream. It didn’t make any
But judging by Malfoy’s chuckle, he wasn’t displeased by Harry’s presumptuousness.
“You looked like you needed it. I can see how much you want to do this, but you’re letting fear hold you back. You just need to get out of your head, Harry.”
Draco turned to regard Harry with wide eyes.
Several hours later, Harry was standing in the Manor beside Ron in front of Lucius’ desk in the study, trying for what felt like the umpteenth time that day to prevent a calamity. The room had been mostly cleared out. Previously book-laden wooden shelves were empty, and the ornate desk now only played host to five small boxes carved out of different materials. Near the desk was an ugly padded brown leather, thin-legged ottoman upon a large, nauseatingly purple monstrosity of a rug which had been moved from one of the bedrooms. The type of plush decorative item which Aunt Petunia would’ve referred to as a shag rug, much to Harry’s youthful amusement.
“I’m aware of that,” she chortled. Hermione pointed at the menu on the table in front of Harry. “Pick something. I need caffeine.”
let that new document reach you. The terms in it are worth nothing until you receive it.”
The noise which emanated from Harry was more guttural than he was accustomed to hearing from his own throat.
“Stop it,” growled Michael. To Harry’s amazement, the glass immediately stilled and he could pull in air. The crackle of Harry’s magic remained on his skin but dimmed to more of a passive buzzing. He wondered whether Michael could feel it. “That’s better,” said Michael, indicating to Harry that maybe he couldn’t. “I just want to talk to you.”
“And I am. But not for
He kept staring down at his hands, trying to recall the instant when his magic had removed the letter from existence. It worried him that he hadn’t controlled that. Harry thought he’d been getting better with his accidental magic. And a massive anomaly had occurred: Harry’s own magic had
Harry slowly lowered his body and sat, feeling self-conscious as his bum rested upon Malfoy’s thighs. Being on top, even in this manner, felt too much like the type of sexual encounters that he’d allowed himself to be pressured into before by other men. Harry on top. Harry in control. He hadn’t thought that this was what his deal was with Malfoy. Had believed that Malfoy understood that. Harry wanted to be on the
"Thanks, Potter."
Draco lets out a breath he didn't even notice he was holding.
"Stop it, Malfoy." Potter frowns and adjusts his glasses. "You had your little speech, now it's my turn."
The snake wrapped itself around His leg, and then they were gone, with a characteristic pop that always follows teleportation.
Draco drank some nerve-calming tea with a bit of something that most probably was Restorative Draught. Now his mind is more tired, but also more clear without blood rushing through his head and a palpitating heart. Thanks to that, he's realized by now what he nearly did.
So that's what Draco is trying to do until he finally does.
Draco is certain he has never seen such a face on Potter before. The boy looks at him intently, his gaze is piercing Draco through. Draco wants to believe him, yet he can't bring himself to respond to that.
"It's just for tonight."
"So you didn't let my skull crush against the floor, this is only getting more suspicious, Potter."
Potter gulps and looks away.
Potter seems caught off guard a bit and remains unmoving for a while. Eventually, he closes his eyes, concentrating.
Draco feels sick of it. The porridge would taste so homey and comforting if only he was in a stable state of mind, but Draco isn't, and neither is his stomach. He leaves the unfished food and stands up from the table, trying not to look at Potter again. His gut is telling him that something is odd, but he ignores it. He's got his own problems he needs to deal with.
Draco shakes his head.
"Like I said, it's very old magic. There isn't a spell for it or anything of that sort. I just know you need to cut your hand with a wand, and then you need to touch your hands flat with the other party so that the blood mixes. You say your words, intertwine your fingers, I suppose it's to seal the vows and the blood forms into a vial. That's it. And no," Draco notices Potter opens his mouth to interrupt him," No, we can't mix our blood in a separate vail. It's the skin on skin contact that makes it work."
"I would have done that on my own, Potter if only you didn't have my wand."
Draco doesn't obey.
Draco is not even crying anymore, he feels all hot from anger. He feels furious, so furious his cheeks turn crimson.
"It took me so much," Draco sniffles, "so fucking much to trust you, I'm trying- If you know the Dark Lord so well, and you are aware of what the Death Eaters are capable of- You know what, judging from how you treat me I'm fucking certain, Potter, that you have no idea! No fucking idea what's going on there! You don't have a family of Death Eaters, none of your friends are Death Eaters! You think it's so easy to be either the good one or the bad one, but it's not!"
"That's all you have to say?"
Draco purses his lips. If Potter tries to get more information out of him, Draco swears he will clear his memory and leave. He didn't come here to be interrogated.
"Potter." This time Draco's voice is more demanding, closer to a hiss.
Draco fights a smirk and then remembers that he also needs to say the same actual words.
"Bella." Narcissa glared at her- "Do you even- Draco is so young! He's just a kid-"
"Yes, I am sure, Potter. It's not like we have much time left to live, anyway. Now, give me back my wand."
"You- You didn't say anything about it, though?"
He closes his eyes, feeling the burning tears filling them.
Draco just breathes heavily. If it's another panic attack, he's going to-
"But it's true. I just didn't want to go to the same house as you and Voldemort- Nevermind. I swear, I swear on my parents I won't use it against you."
"I'm losing my patience, Potter."
"It's a secret," Potter whispers back.
"Nothing."
"You say you didn't come to spy on me, then what is all that for? I will help you, I can't just let you cry like that, what was all that for?!"
Draco wants to be saved, he wants to feel safe, he wants someone to take off the burden from his shoulders, and yet, it's not just about him. His life doesn't belong to him anymore. And so much can go wrong-
"The Sorting Hat wanted me to go to Slytherin, so-"
"What?"
"So this is the only son of Lucius." The hissing voice pierced through Draco's ears.
"You're not going to die"
"I'm helping someone who needs it."
Draco shuts his eyes.
"Shut up." Commands a loud whisper.
"Draco!" she squealed, pulling away. She squeezed his arms from both sides, shaking him "Do you even realize what great of an honour this is?!" she exclaims with a note of hysteria in her voice, "This is- Cissy-" She glanced at her sister, who was now standing, leaning on the back of the chair, staring at the floor. "Cissy!"
"Speak clearly, Potter," Draco takes a deep, shaky breath, "I don't have a whole day."
"First, you eat. Then we talk about whatever the fuck is going on here, and then maybe I'll give you back your wand. Maybe. What's that, anyway?" Potter nods towards Draco's plate, now stably resting on his knees.
"I- I talked to Myrtle."
He sobs particularly loud now, and it reminds him of times when he was little and his father would hit him with the stick of his wand if he cried too much. His mother would tell him to stop it, that it "isn't the way to teach a kid how to behave" but his father knew better, of course.
As soon as Draco feels Potter move away, Madam Pomfrey comes back, the sound of her footsteps rings in the big room. She carries a big, brown bottle in one hand and a spoon in the other.
The awkwardness in the air is so dense it could be cut with a knife.
Draco is nearly sure Potter won't lie when there are his parents considered and he's ready to hear a "no".
He turns around, walking back to Draco.
It sounds like a plead, Draco's shoulder shake one more time due to sob, and maybe that's what makes Myrtle back off. In the end, it's not the first time she sees him like this, and she has learnt that insisting won't help her to get anything out of him.
"I don't want to hurt you."
He exhales loudly with a wheeze, growing more and more irritated with the whole situation. Potter makes him anxious, Draco finds it suspicious that Potter came to the bathroom just when he was in it.
Or maybe he's not. In the end, the prize that he will need to pay to keep them safe is, frankly speaking, high. A bit too much of what he has in him.
"Of course." She whispered and got her wand out of her cloak.
He's not going to die.
Draco knows he needs to get himself together.
"Whenever you decide, just come to me." He gets up. "I don't know, write a letter or something. Whatever you decide so that I know where I'm standing."
"See, it was all safe and sound. Now. There's this thing, but before I tell you anything, just- Don't act like a stupid Slytherin and try to kill me before I finish talking. Or at least give me a warning."
"What?" Potter furrows his eyebrows and his voice goes way above a whisper.
"I dare say our case is quite radical."
"Do you believe me now?"
"Don't-" Draco can utter this much through his breath.
And he didn't let Draco skull crush against the bathroom's floor. Which again, could be a part of a trap, making Draco trust him, nonetheless, it doesn't sound quite like him. Potter just doesn't seem like that kind of a person.
"Okay, but first give me back my wand."
"Yes, Potter, not mudbloods, but- but people coming from muggle families."
On the other hand, Draco feels deep inside that Potter can't be that wicked.
"Stop smirking, Potter, and excuse you, but why can I only see your head?"
He stood up.
"For fuck's sake, Potter, can't you be serious for a second?!"
Draco has never thought about Potter in that way, never took into account what the boy might be feeling. He didn't look at him like at another human being, because it was Potter.
Draco has an adequate comeback for that but doesn't have the strength to argue with Potter, who seems completely unbothered anyway.
Draco's head is a mess, he's tired out of his mind, he hasn't had such an exhausting day in a long time, and Potter just won't give up. Taking everything into account, maybe Draco shouldn't give up on this just yet as well. If Potter swears on both on his parents and his redhead friend and "I-Know-It-All" girl, then Draco should probably trust him. Words hold power within them, so if he lied, that could end up badly for either him or worse, his friends.
If he doesn't speak about Severus, he will have to lie.
He rushes his hands to his head, squeezing it from both sides. He's going insane.
Potter has already heard probably most of his sobs, he's heard worse than this.
"You think I enjoy this, right?" He looks at Potter with a grimace. "The thing is, I don't fucking enjoy any of this. And it's not even the worst, Potter! It's not the worst!"
Draco bites his lip to not say too much and closes his eyes.
"Well spotted, I applaud you."
Draco looks to the side and snorts.
These words made hair on Draco's skin raise.
"No, I just don't want to get bound to you without making sure-" Draco pulls himself up from the backrest, giving Potter a daring look- "Okay. Do you know the spell?"
"You heard me. I don't feel safe when you're standing above me like this."
Draco sighs, his breath trembling. He bites his lip and thinks about the answer.
Actually, this isn't a problem itself. The problem is, what is going to happen if anyone improper except Potter gets to know.
Draco feels like falling under the ground and burying himself there all over again. He wanted everything to be set as quickly as possible, but now that it's come to it, he feels panicked. Everything is going to be clear.
Draco felt rage starting to slowly burn in him. It's because of Him. It's His fault that-
If he does speak about him, he will have to lie as well.
"No."
Draco takes a deep breath and places the glass back on the bedside table.
"I knew it was you back then, Potter!"
"I will let you know. Go now, Potter."
"Listen here, Potter," Draco speaks through gritted teeth. "Remember when my father kind of let the prophecy slip out? Well, You-Know-Who got mad, really mad-" his voice breaks- "And let's say we're lucky they put my father in Azkaban because otherwise, he would have been dead by now."
"Malfoy, I said something about you using your wand without giving me a warning." Potter's voice sounds more firm than before. Draco glances at his hand and sees that without even noticing it, he clenched his fist around the magical object. A little against his will, he lets go of it.
Potter to open his eyes.
She furrows her eyebrows, looking from Draco to Harry several times, visibly hesitating.
Draco is sitting in the Great Hall, next to Pansy and Blaise, trying to force himself to eat anything. He settled for a toast with butter. Better anything than nothing.
A breath in, and a breath out.
Only if someone would help him out of this-
"Understood." Potter gives the woman a little, terribly awkward smile.
"Do you think either of us would have enough nerve to kill the other?" Draco wrinkles his nose.
"It's not that bad, Malfoy." Potter gives a lopsided grin.
"No." He says weakly. It's the truth.
But Draco doesn't trust that easily. You have to earn decent treatment.
It's okay, but Potter should go. It's not going anywhere.
Weird.
Draco would drink as well, but he was sure that if he drank, he would throw it all up at sight. He hasn't been able to eat anything.
(n.) a crossroads; a critical decision or turning point in one's life
"Mr. Malfoy, are you talking to someone?"
"Okay. I'm leaving." Myrtle says in a small voice, slowly flying away, still facing Draco. "But if you'd ever need me, you can talk to me."
"A deep inhale, a slow exhale."
Most importantly, Draco is stupid, because Potter will find about it sooner or later since Draco is going to tell him if it turns out that Potter's intentions are genuine.
"Why can't we go there?" He asks, his voice smoother and quieter now.
"You are right, I thought you'd love the idea of, how you put it, running around with your wand and killing people. But I promise, I'll try to change the way I- perceive you, even though it won't be easy. And only if you do the same regarding me, I don't think I'd like to know what is it that you think about me there, in your twisted mind."
He doesn't even blink once while speaking, even if he's staring directly into Potter's eyes, even if he's close to his face and he should feel uncomfortable about it.
"Like what?"
His breathing is heavy and ragged, even though he tries to calm it down.
All of the self-control he managed to take over himself when the ghost appeared goes away.
Potter seems very reluctant.
He may as well hear out whatever it is that Potter thinks they should or shouldn't do.
"I know, Malfoy." Potter sounds deadly serious. "I have encountered Him a couple of times already, and not only Him but actual Death Eaters that aren't my aunt or cousin of- I don't know, my dog."
"As I was saying, I do realize it's weird, but he's not doing that because- Because he thinks I'm capable, no." Draco feels ashamed. "You should have seen him telling me all of this crap, redeeming my family's name when he knows just how- Pathetic we are now. Despicable."
"Is this the same thing you put on when you spied on me on the train?"
Draco slightly tilts his head.
No, it's not even "so much can go wrong", there's simply no way it can go well.
He reaches for Draco's hand.
Draco keeps on breathing. He's breathing, but he can't feel the air in his lungs.
Potter is an idiot, but Draco highly doubts he would come to fight him without a wand, and if he had wanted to, he would have done it. They have fought before over the most stupid, pathetic things that they should have let slide, but they chose not to. If Potter had come to fight, he would have done it.
Potter studies Draco through narrowed eyes.
“The joke shop from Hell?” Harry asked, suspecting he knew exactly where Draco was referring to, but surprised enough that Draco would willingly go there to want to confirm whether he was right.
you. And I wish you’d
The bell above the shop door jangled, and Harry’s head swung to the right to watch the door open and Draco step out into the street.
“Just do your best,” Draco suggested, replacing the blanket on the bed and crawling under it while trying not to make it too obvious that he was visually examining Potter’s head.
After what seemed like a lengthy hesitation, Draco stood. Hopeful, Harry followed him upwards.
“No, we didn’t,” said Harry. Neither Harry nor Draco had agreed to anything.
Barely able to speak with increasing anticipation, Harry resolutely pushed words out with his breath, but his volume was faint. “Yes, I’m very grateful. Thank you.”
“Now, try again.”
Malfoy’s eyes ominously narrowed before he visibly took a deep breath of restraint. He looked like he wanted to hit Harry. And Harry
. And I think they… might be. If they’re not,” Harry glanced at Draco. “Then I still won’t be alone. I have someone who thinks I’m
Draco smiled. “Acceptable.”
Encouraged by this spark of openness from Potter, Draco tried to prompt more. “Why?”
When Draco awoke from a fitful sleep the following morning, he followed his habitual practice of rising before the Gryffindors, trying to pretend while he dressed that he wasn’t listening for any sign of movement from Potter’s bed.
To his ears, Harry's despairing laugh sounded more like a sob. He wished that Malfoy would touch him, but also prayed that he

“Umm… yeah.”
will ever be Master of you.” Harry watched as Draco removed his briefs, the last remaining garment, and crawled back onto the bed. Draco smiled. “But we have more fun things to be thinking about just now.”
“So, what else?” Harry pressed. Draco’s silence was ominous. “Do I want to know?”

“So… do you hate me?” asked Ron, beginning to gnaw his bottom lip.
“So, what should I do n -” Harry jumped as the smoke abruptly reversed its route, drew back into the wand, and had entirely vanished within seconds.
there anymore?” Ron noisily inhaled through his teeth. “There’s so many things that I struggle to keep track.”
But Draco wasn’t going to let Potter flee.
“But if you -”
Something was wrong. But as Draco emerged gradually from the drowsiness of sleep, he couldn’t determine quite what it was.
“I want to hear your answer,” prompted Malfoy.
Draco sat curled in the corner of an annoyingly squashy chair in the darkest corner of the Gryffindor common room. He would’ve preferred to study in the peace of the dormitory, hidden behind the curtains of his bed, but experience had taught him that squirreling himself away only provoked Potter to come and fetch him. Consequently, Draco had eventually consented to working amid the pack, and attempted to block out the rabble around him.
Lucius glared.
? Why is it a
Focussed as he was on Harry’s face, Ron didn’t appear to notice, even as the shaking moved to Harry’s hand. Harry tucked the offending limb behind his back and tried to remember his breathing.
“Yes, I do.”
Potter’s fingers encircled the base of Draco’s cock, the side of his hand brushing against pubic hair as Potter held Draco’s shaft securely.
Not too bad. Harry hadn’t even touched Draco’s cock.
“I think…” Draco cleared his constricting throat, “a silencing charm would be a good idea… Harry.”
“Knowing what I do
The creaks and rustles of fabric from behind Harry indicated that Malfoy had settled again on the couch. And the faint slosh of liquid suggested that he’d poured himself a drink.
“Get… off me!” Potter’s voice cracked on the second word, a betraying waver. Potter yanked at the arm in Draco’s grip, but Draco didn’t let go. “
help him?”
Harry remembered his earlier question. “Is there another portrait of your father?”
“Do you like that feather, Harry?” Luna asked.
During all the recent excitement, Harry had completely forgotten. “Ah, shit. So, I do. If Hermione counts as a date.”
“Where are you going?” Potter asked. As if it wasn’t obvious.
Another excellent point. “Right. Let’s go. Where to?”
Potter nodded. “Okay. How about this… if you don’t ask me to pretend that I’m happy, I won’t ask you to pretend to be happy either.”
Sitting back on his heels, Harry revelled in the moment.
Harry sucked in a startled breath at the same instant that something in the corner began to rattle.
“I… don’t know,” answered Harry honestly. “It feels… like the thing to do. Maybe.”

Draco appeared to consider Harry’s objection as he lowered his arms to encircle Harry’s waist. “Desires, then. But that seems a bit… erotic trash novel. Which I own an extensive collection of, by the way.
“We?”
But Harry couldn’t just watch it happen. He waved his free hand to cast a stasis spell. No reaction. Harry tried an alternative. And another.
Malfoy tutted. “You’re looking far too chuffed with yourself.” Harry attempted to appear less eager. “I’ve changed my mind. Here, have your pillow back.”
Luna walked closer until she was peering at the wand from about a foot away.
“And remember… you are not permitted to dirty my mouth with your filthy come. I will be
“Why is it only ever ‘
Potter’s fist pumped slowly, not with dexterity but with purpose, squeezing and sliding against skin. Clumsy, hasty and harsh, it wasn’t perfect by any standards. Maybe Draco’s growing excitement was merely the irrepressible teenage thrill of being touched by another person, but he didn’t think so. Tucking his face into Potter’s shoulder, Draco leant helplessly against Potter’s sopping, strong body, Draco’s hands hanging useless by his sides, not reciprocating, just trying to cling on to thin air.
fifty-four inkwells? My family was crazy. I’m going to sell them to that weird bald bloke on Diagon Alley. He likes this kind of stuff.”
Draco cleared his throat before his mouth curved into a smile which was evidently meant to charm and soothe. “Have I mentioned how much I love you?”
“It’s freezing.” Potter shivered slightly, his wayward hair already drooping with the weight of water, but he offered no further complaint as they began to walk in tandem away from the castle. “And by who?”
be free. No matter the outcome of the war,” Draco said.
As usual, Malfoy already had scorn to offer. “Yet another new romance fizzled out, Potter? Shame. Was Wood not meeting your high sexual standards? I imagine you can be quite a lot of work.”
Harry watched Ron tilting his head to the side as he surveyed the obvious positions of their concealed hands.
“I reserve politeness only for those who deserve it,” Draco said.
“Huh. Your people were very strange.”
Malfoy reached out, his hand tantalisingly close to Harry’s groin as he plucked the glass from Harry’s hold and set it on the table. Harry hadn't been drinking from it, anyway.
Ron tutted loudly before he said, “Not everyone has the sheer

With an effort, Harry called his wayward magic back into his core before he stomped back over and around his desk, stopping to loom close to where Malfoy stood, chair providing a feeble barrier between them. Harry glared. “Maybe you should have the
“Yes. Pesky bugger.”
“Isn’t that the eternal question? Get off your lazy arse and find out,” Draco taunted, turning his back on Potter and striding towards the portrait hole. Potter would either follow, or he wouldn’t.
Breath hissing rapidly through his teeth, Harry didn’t comment further. But he was certain Draco was going to.
Nodding, Harry waved cheerfully as Ron walked back out the door.
“Really? But you didn’t -”
… stretching… Harry was wrong, there were definitely
“You are about to receive eight strikes of my hand. And every single one deserved. You will count each strike, and you will display appropriate gratitude for each of them. If you miss one, we will of course begin again.” Of
But Malfoy didn’t appear to think so. Malfoy’s hand extended towards the bedside table to lift his wand and lazily wave it in the direction of the light hanging from the ceiling above them as he uttered a charm. The room was bathed in soft illumination before the wand was placed back down.
In truth, Draco was exhausted. Both mentally and physically from all the recent events. But of course, he presented a lie.
. Harry
! They refused! And your useless paperwork didn’t make any difference!”
“Stay in position,” growled Malfoy as Harry felt him move away.
“Why the sudden change of mind?” Potter asked, finally looking directly at Draco.
Harry stopped, frowning at the strange tickling sensation he was feeling on his left butt cheek.
Potter’s look of bafflement was insulting. “But you don’t like me.”
Harry stormed into his office, taking pleasure in swinging the door shut behind him and the resounding thud as it slammed back into the frame. He hoped it’d cracked the wood. Striding forward, he walked quickly around his desk, eyes searching for the file required for the next item on his never-ending agenda.
not the one to has to shag him. And he’s not so bad anymore. Kind of funny, now that he doesn’t rant on about blood status.”
“Yes, you
Potter’s gaze had flicked to Draco’s arm, and it was too late for Draco to correct his mistake.
Draco looked more reassured as his uncertainty was replaced by a preening grin.
“Okay,” Draco whispered. Harry raised his hips to distract Draco from his needless concern. As he felt an answering press, it seemed to have worked.
“Yup,” Malfoy nodded against Harry’s head. “Most of it, anyway. There is some stuff in there that’s worth keeping. Could be an interesting project, sifting through everything. Finding unsuitable new owners for pretentious antiques.”
Harry didn’t reply as she disappeared into the shop.
The change in Malfoy’s tone switched their roles back in a flash.
Those words were so perfectly sweet that Harry had no fitting response except to kiss the top of Draco’s head.
As he frantically maintained his mangling grip on the pillow under his head to curb his growing urge to reach out and touch Malfoy’s hair, maybe for a more intimate connection, maybe to encourage a fast pace, Harry bit his lip even harder, and realised that he was in trouble.
“Since you’re so precious about your wand, you’ll just have to do without. Or
“Yes, that too.”
Potter was so bloody messed up. And caring about that was threatening to take Draco down with him.

“I think we’ve been over the issue of ‘mattering’ before.” They had. A lot. Harry was still working on it. “But Weasley did… something, didn’t he?”
An authoritative form of address could be expected or a repetition of Malfoy’s words. Unsure what he should call Malfoy in this situation, Harry took a chance.
“Wow,” muttered Ron. “That was… effective. You would’ve made a
“Yup. To be honest,” Draco sighed again. “I’d been thinking that it would’ve been a satisfying sort of retribution if Weasley lost the promotion to Corner.”
“Sit up.
That should be much better news than it was. “Good. Because I wouldn’t like you to get the wrong idea.”
“Morning,” chirped Potter when he reached Draco, the brightness of his smile not echoed on the face of the accompanying Weasley.
“You’re a very strange person,” observed Draco.
The sound of cracking glass signalled the fate of another window. Concentrating, he tried harder to regulate the flow of air that filled and left his body; the expand and contraction of his lungs.
. I mean, here I am… trying to do something
“I’ll compromise,” muttered Potter as he reached one arm over Draco to pluck Draco’s wand from the nightstand. Draco was too amazed by the sheer audacity to stop him. A whispered spell later, and the sound of the window creaking open was shortly accompanied by a distinct flutter of wings, followed seconds later by the disturbing indentations of sharp talons trying to penetrate the thick drapes around the bed.
The glare swung to Draco.
Two: Draco’s channel contracted around Harry’s shaft, and Harry could sense impending victory.
“Well…” Harry tried to nudge his thoughts back on track as he lowered his cheek to the warmth again. “Maybe. I

“Yes, I can. It’s my job. In more ways than one now. As your Personal Assistant, Minister, it is the essence of my role to ensure the smooth running of your professional life. Attending more meetings today is evidently not in the best interests of either yourself, your governmental aims, or the officials that you are scheduled to meet with. I fear that the damage could be catastrophic.” Harry could only stare dumbly at Malfoy as he continued, “And as your… whatever, it has become my high priority to ensure your personal wellbeing in other ways. Therefore, for the rest of the day, your office is closed.” Malfoy reached over to pluck Harry’s nearby robe from the floor. “Did you marinade this robe in coffee, Potter? It reeks.”
“Potter -”

“It’s a Pensieve. It’ll… actively find bad memories and erase them. Store them in there, I think. I don’t even
“And it came to me from a reliable source,” added Harry.
Malfoy’s fingers were around Harry’s wrist again. Closing his eyes, feeling steadier, Harry Apparated.

“I’m going to split you in two with my cock and pound you into this table.”
But that was a patently untrue kneejerk reaction. Potter
Desperate to voice an angry or pleading question regarding Draco’s absence and his supposed preferred occupation, but unwilling to risk it, Harry settled for raising an eyebrow in Draco’s direction. Living with Draco had taught him a few nifty facial expressions.
“What’s wrong with boyfriend?”
“But you
One thing in the world could always be relied upon: Harry’s absolutely
“Ermm,” said Harry, watching Draco’s flushed expression as Harry removed his hand from Draco’s clothing.

“Because I love you, Potter. Because you’re kind, generous, irritatingly brave and smarter than you give yourself credit for, infuriatingly argumentative, handsome, and can wandlessly hurl very heavy shit at me when I’m being a prat.”
Malfoy sounded far too hesitant for Harry’s comfort. There was so much more he hoped they could discover together. Worried that he’d inadvertently ruined this, he tried to sound confident. “Don’t stop pushing my boundaries just ‘cos one idea went to crap. That’s what we have the safe word for, Draco. And it worked fine.”
Looking nervous, Ron nodded.
But Harry hadn’t explained his past properly to Draco. He’d simply told Malfoy that he didn’t like topping and left it at that. Hadn’t given details, didn’t want to think about any of it, let alone talk about it. Especially
“So, because you’re magically powerful, you think that you shouldn’t be afraid of someone who hurt you?”
to work that charm out!”
Oh, yeah. So, it was.
compliance that they’d never forget it.
When Harry’s hands found Draco’s bum and squeezed, Draco moaned and shuffled suddenly forwards, bringing the bulge in Harry’s jeans to the ideal angle to nudge into the crease of Draco’s trousers. Harry’s breath caught in the back of his throat. Possibly interpreting the sound as a spike of panic, Draco quickly adjusted himself backwards to line their cocks up again and shifted to urge Harry’s legs apart.
Although startled and irked by the volume of the outburst, Draco reached for the patience not to yell back. “Slytherins don’t brood. We plot.”
Ron’s face instantly blossomed into a fiery red blush of mortification. “
“No, it’s sweet.”
There may have been a glimmer of hurt in Potter’s expression. Excellent, Draco could use that to his advantage.
Frantic at the continuing lack of his experienced employer’s appearance and worried about customer safety, Harry decided that he needed to do

“What has?” Draco asked. The answer was at least partially obvious, but Draco wanted to keep Potter talking now that the subject had been breached.
argue when he had been given an easy way out.
“Come on.” Draco reached out his hand, intending to tug Potter nearer and direct him back inside.
infallible?
And god, Harry wished he would. But he also wished he wouldn’t. Harry's erection was sandwiched between his and Malfoy's stomachs, providing not enough stimulation and
“Yeah, I know the one.”
“Feel how dirty you are,” Malfoy instructed.
Ron seated himself in Arthur’s favourite armchair, clearly intending to give Harry and Draco space as he gestured that they should both sit on the couch. Harry lowered himself onto the right side of the couch, closest to Ron. Draco stood in front of the left side but didn’t sit until Harry lightly tugged on the cuff of his sleeve. Draco had not camouflaged any of his scepticism about Ron’s innocence. Harry was prepared to wait and see.
Malfoy did appear almost concerned. “We should go have a drink.”
“You know, you’re not always very good at this submission shit. Get up.”
“Oh,” Draco replied, and Harry cringed in anticipation. “What do you suggest, Weasley?”
“That would’ve been chivalrous of you, Harry. But I’m quite capable,” she said as she rested the pile on the counter.
Harry couldn’t look directly at Malfoy’s expectant smile. Inspecting the glass in his grasp was safer. “I… it’s… I…” He trailed off into silence. Sighed. Sighed, again.
of less competition, but he was pissed off with me. The thing is though… I didn’t
It was Harry’s worst fear. No-one else had wanted Harry for who he really was, so it stood to logical reason that Draco would grow tired of him. But Harry didn’t know what he’d do if -
The large painting high on the wall in front of Harry was an artist’s depiction of the same room in which Harry currently stood. Lucius was seated behind the desk, leaning back in the leather chair, hands clasped over his chest and looking down his nose at Harry in that special
When Harry sauntered into the kitchen, he was wearing a wide grin of delight. Frowning with apparent confusion at how entertaining Harry had apparently found his bathroom break, Draco rose from the table. Harry greeted him with a kiss, chaste enough for Molly and Arthur’s presence, but also a silent promise of so much more.
Potter gaped. “Are you asking for my sexual credentials?”
.” Draco’s attempt at tone moderation was a tenuous thing. “My father will be waiting for me, when I leave here.” Lucius didn’t need a Dark Mark to hurt Draco if he didn’t comply.
“I suppose not,” laughed Harry. “It was… I wouldn’t be opposed to more of that.”
She nodded but appeared more interested in peering at the contents of the cup than looking at Harry. Or answering as silence hung between them. Eventually, Hermione raised her gaze to look at him.
“Yup. Still need to listen to her though,” Harry yawned, tangling his legs with Malfoy’s, getting comfortable. “I’ll sort it out. Then I’ll get to the rest. I always do.”
So now, Harry would trust that Draco would be there when Harry left this room. Draco would be waiting for him outside the door, like he’d promised to.
“But Draco… do you
Feeling off-balance and oddly emboldened from Granger’s apparent show of support, Draco commenced his most supreme act of foolishness thus far and enquired, “Potter, will you tell me what’s wrong?”
In reply, Draco merely raised an eyebrow.
To make matters worse, or better, the resting of Harry’s bum upon the mattress forced the vibrator even further inside him. Sandwiched between the bed and Harry’s anus, the round ball nudged his cheeks wider until it was unable to go any further. It was like sitting on a snooker ball attached to a thick, long cue: a mental image which Harry thought shouldn’t have been at all arousing, but this experience was addling his mind. Desperate for release, Harry arched his body up, trying to maintain no more than a tentative contact with the mattress.
As he leaned back slightly in Draco’s embrace, the arms around Harry didn’t move, but also didn’t restrain him. Harry had cultivated a faint hope that Draco would never directly ask. Foolish to dream, he’d known. And if Harry wanted an honest relationship with Draco, then he had to be completely honest. But honesty, Harry was discovering, took strength. Harry’s strength felt debatable at best.

“Are you enjoying being

, Draco was permitting the contact.
“Kiss me, and we’ll see. Unless of course there’s a reason why you don’t want to tell me about your not-special someone.”
Potter reclaimed the blanket between clenching fingers and appeared to be examining it intently.
A second later, Michael reacted to the danger and raised his wand. The wood was already on fire when Michael pointed it at Harry.
When Malfoy’s bare feet eventually lowered from the mattress to the carpet in front of Harry, he kept his head lowered and watched their progress as they walked over to the comfy armchair that Harry kept in the corner of his bedroom. From Harry’s vantage point, he could just still spy the feet in his peripheral vision. It seemed that Malfoy had sat on the front edge of the seat cushion.
“What did I imply?”
“Too late now, I’m soaked. What was wrong with being in there? At least it was dry.
Harry didn’t really understand how he helped Draco. It always seemed to him that Draco was a force of independence. But he wasn’t given time to contemplate further as Draco nudged him to sit up straighter, providing space between them to better access Harry’s clothing.

advice?”
Harry tried not to laugh at the mental image of Draco walking unsuspectingly into that brand of ‘busy little boy's room’. Best to get to the point instead in case Draco commenced a hasty retreat back to the main room. And if he didn’t return within an acceptable timescale, Harry would want to go in there and get him. Just for a brief peek, of course. “Why would you want to ask me something?”
The pause before Draco spoke was filled with Draco’s evident awkwardness and Harry’s forced patience. Eventually, Draco mumbled, “I felt… awkward about it. If people are only making offers to me because of you, it’s not very… flattering.”
Snape was delivering the latest in a deluge of derision towards Draco’s perfect work when it happened. Clear in Draco’s line of sight over Snape’s shoulder, a drop of liquid from the bottle fell and Potter’s cauldron emitted a sharp, piercing howl of angry vapour before purple froth rose above the rim. As Draco raised his wand, Snape’s eyes widened, perhaps in horror that Draco might finally have found the courage to hex him, but Snape had still failed to react in the seconds it took Draco to hurl a shielding charm at Potter.
"Ah, Harry!" said James brightly, catching sight of him. "You came, after all! Hey, what did you think of that last play with the Peruvian barrel roll? Spent all summer coming up with it!"
"Uh— never mind," said Harry. He lowered his wand, struggling not to look as stupid as he felt. "Anyway. You wanted a word?"

as pissing in his bed.
Harry propelled himself out of bed before he realized he meant to. His hands were shaking, his breathing coming in ragged gasps.
His world was getting smaller, tunneling. He was nothing but labored breathing, a pounding headache, rushing pulse.
Maybe he'd had to change to become the person the wizarding world needed him to be.
"Isn't he the Seeker, though?" asked Harry, thinking back to the photograph he had found in Sirius's room at Grimmauld Place. Regulus, he was positive, had been sitting in the Seeker's usual position within the team formation.
Dolohov grinned, quick and sharp like unsheathing a knife. "No, no, boy," he said softly, tasting the words like fine chocolates. "I'm going to make you
"He's not my—"
Wordlessly, he cast a cleaning charm on Severus's sheets and pulled his own curtains closed. He sat awake, pretending he was reading into the early hours of the morning.
"Too right you are, Padfoot!" James bounded up to them, straightening his bookbag and sending Lily a winning smile. "Timing is crucial to a good joke. What are we talking about?"
"Merlin help us," muttered Lily. "What have they come up with now?"
The baby Death Eaters had their first mission from the Dark Lord.
Draco and Potter trailed behind.
He glanced back at Sirius and gave an infinitesimal shake of his head.
Harry's chest went cold, an invisible pressure squeezing his lungs.
"Honestly, what do you see in him, Evans?" James's voice carried behind him. "He's
"Any advice, Scar-head?" Malfoy's lazy drawl came from just behind Harry's shoulder.
, the three of them. Mysteries like this were their bread and butter. He'd never had a problem like this before without having Ron standing right beside him, a staunch supporter, and Hermione running several steps ahead spouting information at them as fast as she physically could.
They started walking again toward the Hospital Wing.
There was Harry, wholly naked and bleeding from more wounds than Draco could count, hunched over the unconscious— or dead— body of Ron Weasley. Potter's eyes were bloodshot, his cheeks shiny with tears, and his whole body curled around Ron as if he could shield him with that alone. He was clutching Ron in both hands. His wand was nowhere in sight.
If he was planning a secret revenge prank, he was a damn good actor. He seemed genuinely pleased to see Harry.
what he wants."
A girl who looked startlingly like Gertrude McKinnon was already there, chatting coyly with a sixth-year boy and his friends. As soon as she saw Harry, however, her eyes widened, and she ushered the boys up to their dorm.
Harry didn't know what to say to that either.
He stumbled to his feet, finished tucking in the Cloak under his robes, and half-ran from the Great Hall.
"So, you're going as a
He shook himself, shuddered briefly at the thought of
"Right," said James encouragingly. "So, it's not lycanthropy, but maybe some other curse—"
She started swishing her wand before James could stop her. Horrified, he dove across the table at her, shouting like a madman, "No, the wax! THE WAX!"
Harry saw it in Hermione's eyes that she didn't trust the offer. She would never eat anything produced in Malfoy Manor.
" came Flitwick's voice, and a gust of hard wind whipped the Great Hall, buffeting the steam towards the front doors to dissipate.
"Also, we are delighted to have a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher joining us: Professor Bowie!"
"Yeah," said Harry, not meeting his eyes. "Yeah. We had our own troubles. At Ilvermorny, I mean. People were dying. Nobody cared about
"Sorry," said Harry, dry enough to crumble at a touch. "
A bit of a show-off— and Wormtail needed a bit more time to get back from the Hufflepuff table on foot— he had the candle lights change color in a fluid, unending wave, like a rainbow rippling across the surface of a lake.

Draco threw himself through the hole in the wall and dove to intercept the Killing Curse aimed at Harry.
, he repeated to himself like a mantra.
James stared sideways at his friend. "Uh, I think you might have hit your head harder than we realized. I didn't step in."
Draco looked as repulsed by the scene as Harry.
The long, lean lines created by Malfoy's torso, back, and arms as he stretched were far more interesting than the horribly dense Old English tome he had been struggling through. And— Harry just couldn't get used to him being a
"I agree," said Remus. "He seems… out of place, but I have hopes for him. I think he's maybe just missing home."
at me. I would have been toast if you hadn't stepped in."
Harry turned around to scowl at him. "Well, what would you call it?"
James knew he was on treacherous ground, implying that Sirius was a bad person for his latest prank. Nothing was more volatile than a Sirius Black being likened to his shitty family. But even if James couldn't say it, Sirius needed to hear it.
"You're looking chipper," Lily observed as she joined Harry beside the fireplace in the common room. "Good study session?"
Malfoy's eyebrows shot up.

Lily and James should have given him permission in his third year. Sirius, despite being on the run,
"Think you're up to this, Evans?" he asked in his cockiest voice.
Regulus's brows furrowed. It wasn't Sirius's look of stormy anger but more quizzical, puzzled.
, and he's just screaming the whole time,

Harry rewound what he'd said in his mind and had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Regulus was going to stand on propriety when Harry had been in his bedroom, had lived out of his house at times and inherited his house elf. He was going to stand on propriety when Harry knew how he
McGonagall made the usual show announcing the first years, and the Sorting Hat burst into a rather slapdash song about House traits and its role in sorting them.
Harry caught himself staring, distracted by the sudden movement, he was sure.
"So, what animal are you going for?" asked James. He lounged beside Harry, amiable and relaxed, his feet kicked out in front of him, sideways in the desk with an arm draped over the backrest.
He closed his mouth and looked away, eyes burning again.
That did it. Michael turned on his heel and strode unsteadily down the Alley away from them.
“Hands behind your back, fingers clasped.”
Harry was on his knees again. Sighing happily, he reflected on how fond he was of being here. Kneeling helped him to feel secure, wanted and

.” Draco believed that the Dark Lord had truly lost all sense of logic or reason before the end. “And I think he only kept me alive afterwards because he knew I’d rather be dead.”
The process of Harry topping wasn’t over though.
He was apparently not in the correct place. “Kneel here.” Malfoy pointed to the floor immediately to the right side of his legs. Harry corrected his location.

have allowed Potter’s fingers to curl under his belt. But all he could find the energy to do was meet Potter’s steady gaze, feel Potter’s unexpected bout of dexterity, listen for the inevitable chink of metal through the noise of the pouring rain, and gasp as the fabric covering his groin was peeled away.

Well, that request had been quickly granted.

doubt about the rest.
Nodding, Harry watched Molly exit the back door before he stood and made his way out of the kitchen into the pantry which was accessible a few feet down the hall. As he opened the door, he realised that the pantry was already occupied.
Seconds later, they appeared together in Harry’s lounge. The fingers released Harry’s wrist as Malfoy turned to examine his surroundings.
“Umm,” was Harry’s productive comment.
Hermione’s eyes widened, but she appeared too intrigued for Harry’s comfort.
now, but… but…
Draco’s smile held steady. “Then you never say it. The lack of the word doesn’t mean that you don’t feel it. I know that.”
But brilliant wouldn’t help him right now.
“I’m sure the Wizengamot would have vetoed his choice of assistant, anyway,” said Draco.
Potter preceded the question with what was apparently meant to be a hopeful, amiable smile. “Are you coming in for breakfast? You could sit with us.”
Harry just watched him, gaze steady on Draco’s face, hands stroking hair and scalp until Draco met his eyes again.
“I’m sorry about that,” Draco sighed. “I screwed up. And the… ottoman thing was really inconsiderate. Sorry.”
Resigned to the fact that burrowing was probably not the bravest solution, Harry aimed himself in the direction of the chair and crawled until he was in front of Draco, where he sat back on his heels again and tried not to die of shame.
. A bit sore in several places, but happy, nonetheless. He nodded, carefully bringing his arms down to his sides and gingerly stretching out all his weary muscles.
It was the little things which Draco noticed most of all. The tiny, irritating details which were rapidly becoming the bane of his existence.
still naked,” said Draco from somewhere behind him.
Harry didn’t reply. He was too focussed on the increasing blurriness of his vision. He hadn’t previously been so emotional; he was certain. But he supposed that refusing to acknowledge personal issues for years could cause a bit of a backlog. He didn’t like this tendency though, so he blinked at their clasped hands, determined to bring the world back into sharpness.

Draco let him. There’d be time later for returning to it, he’d make sure of that.
“And some things don’t, if you give people a chance. The important people will love you regardless.”
Sweat beading on his forehead, he opened his eyes. The scroll and his hand appeared unchanged. Not knowing what to expect, if anything, Harry unrolled the contract to examine it. The alteration was immediately obvious. A new addendum had been added to the top of the parchment in bold, curving, deep red script.
“He’s been

So, Draco had grasped the chance to leave his family, although he knew this was only a temporary reprieve. Not even that. Draco had fled from the cauldron into the fire.
They were about halfway down when another shouted voice stopped Harry in his tracks. “Did you like the vibrator, Harry? Is it big enough?
And this time, Draco was going to come. He didn’t try to stop it, there didn’t seem to be much point anymore in delaying the inevitable. Draco only wished that Potter would come first, he had
be offering more than Draco his trust. He’d think about that, but not today.
“That’s… not a solution,” Harry blurted out, wondering if he could discreetly manoeuvre a cushion over his crotch. But Malfoy wasn’t blind; there was no possibility that he hadn’t already noticed the tenting of Harry’s trousers during his examination.
“Hi. Back to your old level of timekeeping, are you?” She grinned, betraying a lack of any real ire.

“You will be. And I shall selflessly allow you to practice on my equipment to help you hone your skills. After all, you assisted me with my project.”
“I… no.” He supposed he wasn’t, if he was on the floor crying about it. “I’m… not. About that, anyway,” he admitted. “I trusted him.” The sting of betrayal had been devastating. “But… things are better now. With…
“I’m… tired. Shut up.” He closed his eyes, rubbing his temples with weary fingers as he tried to block out the world. Harry would dearly love it if he could skip today all together. And possibly the rest of the week.
“Hello, Harry,” Luna said, as if she hadn’t already been aware that he was in here.
“For fucks sake, Senior Auror Weasley… you need a ruddy minder. It’ll let you go by itself shortly.”
But Draco was feeling a little too shaky to prise himself up from the bed and proceed with that cunning plan.
sounded for a few infringements. Harry had received reports from MLE after each one. He’d believed that due to the individual consequences of those, people had been deterred by the risk of committing a crime anywhere within the premises.
“What’s with all the racket?” Draco demanded as he strode through the open door to the study. “I had to cast a silencing charm before all the screaming scared what’s-his-name out of buying the estate. But thankfully, I think it only made him more intrigued.”
here together?”
. Harry’s cock made use of the lengthy interim to slowly thicken within the confines of his trousers. This is why Harry needed to relocate Malfoy to another country, not invite him home. It wasn’t the first time that his penis had experienced an inappropriate reaction to the words that spouted from Malfoy’s mouth. Humiliation and arousal were steadily combining to become perfectly complimentary for Harry, but that was a nightmare within the context of this terrible conversation. He wanted to crawl into a corner and hide. He wanted to cry. He wanted to wank himself raw while Malfoy berated his pathetic existence. Harry had admitted his frustration to the worse possible audience and given Malfoy ammunition to make his life a living hell. He expected the contempt to begin shortly. And the twisted side of him actually wanted it.

Feeling frighteningly tempted, Harry wrenched his hand away from the box and hugged it to his chest. With a nudge of his magic, the lid slammed shut.
. You’ve done enough. Let the world fend for themselves, it’s about time they did.” Harry would try, but the guilt still gnawed at him. He nodded, attempting to appear more confident than he felt. But Malfoy wasn’t fooled. “
Harry didn’t stand though; he was still assessing Draco’s reaction. That had been… a lot of information. Even Harry was trying to decide what to do now.

by himself. The surveillance wasn’t intended to spy; recordings would only be looked at in the event of the spell detecting something illegal. And even then, it had to be above a certain level of wrongdoing before the spell would alert the Auror department. The Wizengamot had been aware of that. Harry didn’t care if people were nicking supplies from their offices or other such misdemeanours. He’d only wanted to keep people safe from anything that would harm them. The Unforgivables were at the top of that list. And the Wizengamot had deliberately left people exposed after Harry had assured those people that they’d be safe.
With Draco’s fist wrapped around his erection, Harry’s venture reached a new height of arousal.
When their lips parted, Harry rested his head in the nook of Malfoy's neck and inhaled the scent that had come to mean ‘home' to him far more than the building they were currently within. He’d been a fool to refuse himself the discovery of what Malfoy could be to him for so long. But he often also debated what Malfoy saw in
What greeted him was a gentle kiss to his forehead.
“Maybe it’ll give us both someone to be honest with. That’s all I originally wanted.”
Malfoy gasped. “Did you
Potter’s latest go at smiling went much better than the last. “That, you can.”
Realising that neglecting to deal with the mess might be issue number one, Harry waved his hand to cast a cleaning charm over both of them. As usual, Draco shivered at the sensation of his magic, but at least Harry knew that wasn’t from dislike. He was certain Draco must have complaints. It might break Harry’s heart a bit to hear them, but he would rather Draco was honest. That way, Harry could work on becoming better.
Draco snorts and shakes his head.
Draco turned to look at his mother. Her voice wasn't tremulous, maybe because she has met the Dark Lord before. She didn't look at Him. Her head remained slightly bowed.
"Bella."
He moves back.
"Since your family served me so obediently for years,-" Draco could swear he heard sarcasm in His voice"- you will be able to make a name for both you and your parents, and the whole family of Malfoys."
"Potter, now
"You do the same, Potter."
And nothing has been solved.
Because he had failed, and Voldemort was furious. That was enough.
Potter proposed to meet on Saturday, at the seventh floor, and Draco found it suspicious since the very beginning. He thought about the Requirements Room but hoped Potter has some other place he wants to go, just picked this place for the sake of convenience since not a lot of people go there.
"Right. Let's go in."
Draco felt one last strike of pain, and the Dark Lord pulled Bella's wand away.
A breath out.
"Shh! Someone may hear you!"
Draco looks down at his lap and sniffs.
Draco can tell that Potter is mocking him.
"You mean, right now? Shouldn't we first go to Dumbledore-"
"What are you scared of, Potter?" Draco gives Potter a daring look. "Perhaps you don't really have the best interest of mine in your mind?"
"Said a guy who's head always looks like a nest."
Potter raises as well.
"No shit, Malfoy."
