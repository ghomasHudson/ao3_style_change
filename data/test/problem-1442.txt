I squeeze his hand, then notice the red skin there, as if it was recently scalded. He yanks his hand from mine and tucks it underneath his thighs, "I'm learning how to cook."
As settled as my life has become over the months, I can't imagine having a child as many others are. And I do want children, enough to fill a house the size of Grimmauld and a table the size of the Weasley’s. I'm just not in a mad rush like some.
I rest my head against the grubby window just in time for the rumbling bus to screech to a halt. I brace myself against the driver’s seat back, then shoot to my feet and towards the exit.
"Uh...right," I agree, not sure whether to be happy he wants to go or let down that he only wants to go out of practicality. I shake the feeling and smile at Draco,
I decide to take a shower to pass the time until Luna shuts her shop down at nine o'clock and heads over. Maybe she'll think of something to return Tasha to her body.
He scrawls the information quickly and slides it towards me, "500 Gallons even. For the bag and all."
"Stop looking at me like that!" I shout and a dam bursts inside me, anger and grief and worry overflowing, spilling out as daggers aimed towards him. Always him.
I glance over at Draco to see his soft smile and gleaming eyes as he strokes Tasha's scales. His face is open and relaxed, long fingered hands lightly petting the content snake. His longish hair is falling over his forehead in fluffy white locks.
I close the front door of Grimmauld Place and search for the faint strands of the houses magic, pushing my will out I lean heavily on my blood magic. The door bolts shut with a solid
Draco's gone quite, head rested on my shoulder when the Night Bus screeches to a halt. I let him down and help him up the steps. The shrunken head is singing a Latin song and the driver isn't the same one I remember, but a quiet, tiny witch with bulging eyes.
I smooth down my slacks and examine myself in the glass of the building. The backup white button-down shirt was nowhere near as flattering, but it did its job.
I rush over to the counter and the strange machine there, trying to smile at a twenty something year old man. The rest of the flock break off and find seats, leaving the man to order.
Seeing no response, I beat the door again before switching to the morbid knocker which dented the ancient door further with a resounding bang.
I nod, eyes stuck to the food despite the wriggling snake trying to worm her way underneath my shirt.
Harry clearly hadn't known what to expect when the I rapped my fist on the scared front door of Grimmauld Place one uneventful Saturday. I waited a good minute at the stoop, anxiety a boa constrictor around my ribs, trying to keep Tasha from slithering into my cloak.
Kneeling at eye level, I call lightly, "Tasha. Hey, Tasha wake up." I peel the Gryffindor red and gold jersey back from her face and she sleepily lifts her head.
"I've...been avoiding the Wizarding world after everything and don't have Floo access where I'm staying. Harry's been the only one I've been in contact with for a while and that's only because of Tasha." I admit, color surely painting my cheeks at the confession. Luna's scrutiny is never a pleasant force to be subjected to.
The years long tension with Draco hadn't disappeared yet. He was obviously uncomfortable, from his polite manners to his ram rod straight back. The power balance was fucked.
Dean and Seamus dropped into the store a few hours later and I went from there to a new wizarding bar that opened up, this one not kid friendly unlike the Leaky.
"I got a new bulb from Luna's the other day. I'll go get Tasha, she's up in my room." I hold up my paint splattered arms, "I've been working on the master bath."
I shrug, painstakingly trying to appear casual, but my heart is beating in my ears at seeing the sunlight stream across Potter's face. And his wild hair where a stray feather is trapped in the untamed curls.
Its decor is as dreary as the rest, old fashioned even for a pureblood home, with a wood stove and water basin. The only new appliances are a large white box humming by the pantry, taking up an unfair amount of walking space and a matching smaller one on the counter with a glass front.
So did Harry figure it out? And what about Drunk Draco? I couldn't help myself, Harry had to give Draco a piggy back ride XD
I re-read Rent Snake yesterday and have decided to pick it back up! ....About dang time too. Thank you for waiting!
The stubborn door swings open and she beams, "That's awfully sweet of you. I really did enjoy seeing him yesterday, it felt like both closure and seeing an old friend, you know?"
I'm not laughing because this is funny. It's just the affects of my brain rattling around in my skull and bile rising in my throat.
I grab the carton of eggs and crack three into a skillet over a open flame. With a spatula I attempt to flip them after the edges have turned brown, but the bottoms are stuck. Pale yolk breaks and runs all over the pan.
His face falls slack with wonder, "How is that even possible? You're telling me there's a train under us?"
Pansy was my date, strictly as friends and to please our parents, we never danced and it was a miserable affair. Watching other's dance under the enchanted ceiling, obviously in love and high on life. Potter was with Parvati and both looked so happy.
I shake my head, swallowing another mouthful. I'm sure I look ridiculous stuffing my face like some unmannered cretin, but I can't seem to stop.
I probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place. It's out of line, Malfoy just wants to see his snake, not be caught in dinner plans he didn't consent to. But he may appreciate a nice meal and stay around longer, that he'll feel welcomed.
My head snaps up and I swallow my partly chewed bite which scraps my throat on the way down. I cough and take a drink of water before composing myself.
"Nobody will even care if you trip up. You could do any number of horrible acts and you'd still be the Savior."
Luna hasn't changed at all, her expression earnest and her day-dreamy words holding no motive. I'm more than happy to call her my cousin regardless of her blood purity. How I didn't find out our shared family tree before the war I have no clue, as much as I had to study my family’s history and how similar the two of us look.
I wake up to a bed spring grinding into my hip and even though I’m up to my nose in blankets, I'm still shivering. I curl into a tight ball, tucking my frozen feet closer to me until I'm gripping my knees to my chest, morning erection squished.
He shakes his head and stands as well. The apron he was wearing still had some stains despite my earlier cleaning spell. There's a name tag that reads, "Annabeth."
I try not to look at her trying to reach me, it's just adding salt to the wound. Best have a clean break, or however that Muggle saying goes.
Snakes with healthy, thick bodies are curled up inside hides and laid out for me to see the richly patterned scales and severe faces. A tank of tiny vipers mists water all on its own, coating the live plants with droplets for the high humidity the brightly colored vipers require.
Anything more than an hour could be harmful to her, but how can I teach differently when it's her instinct?
The business was down the street from my apartment building and quaint. It was on the corner and the front was made of glass, a sign above it reading 'The Java Bean' in a squiggly font and a charming little coffee bean to the side.
Another one?! Sorry for the wait! Didn't edit very closely since I didn't want you waiting any longer.
While writing this I had a thought- In reality owls are nocturnal so why do owls deliver mail during the day in Harry Potter? It makes no sense lol so I just decided they're magical owls.
She never takes the floo, convinced it leaves a person weakened towards invisible creatures of some sort. As much as I appreciate her friendship, there are some things she'll never be able to convince me of.
No. The real answer was no. Draco was not alright. His mind was reeling. He didn't know what to make of all of this.
“It’s time, Harry,” Remus said. And Harry wasn’t stupid—he could tell Bill Weasley had his hand on his wand in his pocket.
The Deathly Hallows would bring Draco back to life and he would get over what happened eventually and live a fulfilling life full of joy. Hermione and Ron would grow up and eventually get old, Hermione likely changing the magical world somehow, Harry just knew. And everyone else he loved…they would live a life without being concerned about Voldemort. Just like Harry was now. It was all over.
lmao ngl i started writing about hermione being pissed about the ministry not doing anything to protect the school when their lives were being threatened and like,,,,,HEEEE, i live in america and my brain was like 'fuck this is--this is--how yours truly feels about gUNS' like i didn't intend it that way i was in the middle of writing and i was like fyUCK
After they laughed for a few minutes, Harry wiped at his face, still smiling. “Fuck, sorry. I grabbed it from the broom stores that Gryffindor uses. Thought it would be fine.”
So there they were, two teenage boys in the middle of a war who had feelings for each other, pressed close together under a single cloak.
Bill and Snape exchanged a look before Bill put the Deathly Hallows back so they were making contact with Draco, figuring it couldn’t hurt.
“He doesn’t even trust us,” Ron said. “Because we tried to convince him in the forest to let Draco be and rest finally. He hasn’t even let us talk to him. I’ve never seen him like this.”
For a moment, the conversation lulled and neither quite knew what to do. It was the first pause, the first time either truly stopped to think about what was happening. Were they sitting and sharing a drink? Catching up on the past like they were old friends?
Nodding, Draco recalled the memory again. “The circumstances aren’t clear right now. It’s like something just—“ He snapped. “—brought that up but I can’t get what immediately surrounded it. He was telling me to do something and was pointing his wand at my mother and threatening to kill her if I didn’t. I don’t know what it was, though. And I think that’s the scariest part of this all. He could have made me do anything and I would have done it.”
He started to slip past everyone, despite how much they kept asking what the letter said. Instead, he went upstairs. It was only eight pm but Harry knew he likely wouldn’t get much sleep tonight, worrying about Draco. Between that and the fact that everyone seemed to want to be asking him questions, Harry decided to just go to sleep. He would go to Madam Malkins in the morning.
If he was being honest, McGonagall and Snape were doing most of the work. Because Harry had reached his breaking point.
Harry let out a laugh at that. “I don’t think anyone’s reacted to me like that in a couple of years. It’s interesting, really. But, yes, I suppose. I am
Turning to his right, a mirror had already appeared on the wall. Crossing behind his chair, he walked up to it, staring himself in the face.
Sitting up straight, he decided he would try and send a letter to his mother. The one from the school would most likely have been addressed to his father: everyone knew that if anything happened to a Malfoy, Lucius was going to come for them, so the letter had likely explained the situation and pleaded for forgiveness. But his mother would likely be the one to respond.
Hermione resized the body bag and was about to lift the invisibility cloak off of Draco’s body when she was silently disarmed.
The entire room seemed like someone had hit the pause button as both of his friends processed. Neither moved, neither spoke and minutes seemed to pass, time moving in agonizing slowness for Harry.
Harry laughed. “Well, it seems you succeeded, doesn’t it? I’m here. I’m dead. And there’s no Deathly Hallows. And the thing is, Dumbledore? I walked into that forest knowing it was a trap; I walked in there knowing that I was going to die and there was nothing I could ever do about it. And I did it anyway because it was the right thing to do. So I’m here. And I accepted my death and I didn’t even try to fight it. So, congratulations, Dumbledore. All your hard work to craft a seventeen-year-old martyr worked.”
Narcissa nodded. “Yes, dear, you need your rest. That was a lot to take in. Why don’t you go back to sleep and Snape and Bill can go talk to Harry? I’ll be right here, dear.”
For a moment, the world settled for Harry and he just held his best friend. They didn’t let go of each other as Ron began to whisper, “It’s over, Harry, it’s all over. You-Know-Who’s dead, it’s all over, you’re okay, it’s all over.”
She took one long look at Ron and then smacked him upside the head. “I wasn’t asking about Potter you idiot! If I wanted to know how Potter was doing—he’s sitting right there—I’d just ask him!” She whirled on Harry. “How’s Draco?”
“I’m just saying that, looking back on it, many of Harry’s actions make more sense if you factor in him having feelings for Draco. And, if you think about him being bisexual it only fits into place a lot of other questions like why he used to stare at Oliver Wood and Cedric in that way that we would make fun of him for.”
“Harry,” Ron started and the pity was clear in his voice. “It’s been over twelve hours and they haven’t worked yet. You can’t wait forever.” He didn’t want to start in on how the Deathly Hallows had been found in order to bring Harry back and that Harry had come back without them. Harry had told his friends about his conversation with Dumbledore and his friends had thought they had come to the conclusion that the Deathly Hallows were just a legend but that in the end, they did not conquer death. But Harry couldn’t let go.
It took less than a minute for Draco to not be able to breathe. Less than thirty seconds more for Potter to notice.
PLEASE READ::: TIMELINE::: I just want y'all to be aware that we're jumping back a little bit. Remember like 2 chapters ago when Snape went to talk to Narcissa and then Narcissa walked to Draco's room and just as she got there Bellatrix was also getting there? That's where we're picking up for this chapter.
“Based on the way she’s reacting, she probably won’t even let you read it in front of anyone,” Blaise added, coming to take a seat, looking a little exhausted.
“There was one time not too long ago when Draco called me on the mirror. It was our last time talking. And he talked really quickly about desperately wanting to tell me how much I mean to him. He said that he has had feelings for me for a very long time—strong feelings—and I wasn’t able to tell him that I feel the same. My whole life, I’ve never been able to really say goodbye to the people that I love. I wasn’t able to say goodbye to my parents, and just when I got Sirius in my life, he died and it was so sudden. He was just gone and I didn’t get to say goodbye. I know that I’ll be able to say goodbye to you and to the rest of the Weasleys, but Draco’s the only person I’ve ever really liked
There was silence in the room a moment, a lot of people looking awkwardly at the floor or the walls. Ron in particular looked a little chastened.
She straightened her shoulders. “Do we need a reminder of our conversation that day in the Room of Hidden Things?” Harry cringed, remembering her wrenching grip on his ear.
Draco was opening his mouth to ask who exactly “he” was, not wanting the cold fear spreading through his body to be confirmed when the door opened and there was his aunt Bellatrix.
To Draco's astonishment, Ron burst out in a hearty laugh. Oh. So that was a definite no, then. Who would want to be friends with him? It made sense, really.
It took a few minutes for them to pull apart, both of them knowing that Draco couldn’t stay long and they needed to get on with the conversation. So pulled tight against each other in an alley, they got to talking.
Hermione worked quietly, applying the stasis charm and then levitating Draco into the body bag. She didn’t remove any of the three Deathly Hallows so she quickly put an invisibility charm on the bag.
They each held the gaze of the other. It was like old habits were resurfacing. These days, Harry found that he was less and less competitive. He just didn’t see why it mattered anymore and to tell the truth, he kind of missed that in himself. It was like he could feel himself growing up and it was quite offputting.
He let out a sharp gasp, his hands flying up to his mouth. “Wha—How—I—“ He stumbles over his words, not knowing what to say or how to react. There were two thick scars bisecting his chest. They were about half as thick as his finger, white and scraggly against his pale skin. “What?” He sobbed, his fingers coming down to lightly touch them. He felt nothing.
She stopped struggling, still fuming in Ron’s direction and then she just began yelling. “How many times do we have to fucking say it, Weasley? Just because we aren’t best friends doesn’t mean that we want to see Voldemort
Her face turned worrisome. "Well, Draco. This isn't exactly an easy thing to tell a person but, you've been obliviated." Draco's eyes went wide. He— what? "Now, I know this can be a lot, but not to worry. It didn't seem to be too bad. While we unfortunately believe you will not able to regain the memories you lost, it is a bit spotty and we can't be sure. We believe you should still have your general memories— for example, being at Hogwarts and knowing who people are, things like that— but may be missing some details. Some obliviated patients find a total wipe of the memories while others find it much more touch and go. But, we'll see how it is in the coming days."
“Well, fuck, are you two dating now or something?” Ron asked. Harry noted that Hermione was still looking off into the distance, blinking occasionally. He could practically see her working all of this out in her head.
i really wanted to leave this off at a little slice of life-type scene so sorry if you feel like its not a good ending i like it
“Draco!” Harry whispered, coming up and embracing him immediately, feeling intense pain in his heart. At least when he died, his doing so would make everyone he loved safer.
Draco shook his head. He wished he would have known about that earlier. When McGonagall first offered him the job, he had been hesitant because he was uncertain what kind of memories being at Hogwarts would bring up. Especially because he knew that Longbottom was the professor of herbology there and all that shit. But now that Harry was going to be there? Fuck, it would almost be like he was back in the war.
Draco kissed him one last time. “Of course, Harry.” Then, just before he slipped out from under the cloak, he said, “I love you, Harry.”
and I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know how to stop it but Snape came in and he healed you but you were left with some pretty bad scars and I’m so sorry, Draco, I’m so sorry.”
Draco had a hand covering his face as his shoulder shook with silent laughter. “Snape is my godfather.”
sorry for the long time no update but trying to graduate in three years is the WORST don't do it kids ride your scholarship money as far as it'll take you
Draco glanced down at his hands, unsure of himself. Why was such a cute boy that he had apparently previously bullied being so nice to him? “I always wanted to play quidditch.”
Now Draco looked like he didn’t quite want to say. “For the most part, I wanted to come back. France was getting stifling. I also realized that I only left to run away from my problems. That and I wanted to come back because the French Ministry is just...chaotic and I couldn’t stand it anymore.”
“Firstly, we have a student watch going on. They’re monitoring everything that is coming on or off the grounds of Hogwarts through some heavily modified copies I made of the Marauder’s Map.”
“If you would recall,” Dumbledore continued. “I told you that the true master of death is someone who does not seek to run away from death, but accepts that he must die and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.”
Again, Harry laughed. “Well, we didn’t exactly start things out right. But, we don’t need to go over that right now because we’re busy starting again. So. Draco Malfoy, would you like to be friends?” Draco stared into those open green eyes and he knew that even if his mind didn’t remember meeting Harry, his heart did.
Draco crashed down in an armchair in his flat, thinking about all of this. Was he really pursuing a...relationship with Harry Potter? Harry James Potter? The same man from his childhood?
Her eyes were dark and piercing, and Draco felt like looking into them made him want to squirm. Something about them was so intense and Draco felt compelled to look away.
The upside, Draco supposed, was that he had his memories back. But really, there was no upside. He had his aunt digging through his mind for hours with the Dark Lord and several Death Eaters watching over it happening. He had spent the last hour alone just recovering from the ordeal his body had been through.
He spoke in the voice that still felt too foreign and new. It was too deep. How old was he? "The last thing I remember is packing for Hogwarts."
But, of course, he had promised all of his friends years ago that he would not purchase alcohol and keep it in the house. It was a pact they all made. After the war they found that if they had it in the house, they would drink it and things tended to not end well. So a drink in the pub it was.
He placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead, glad that he had gotten that moment to tell Draco that he loved him back.
He couldn’t be inside because everywhere he went he would get some form of harassed. The only place to be inside and safe was hidden away in some empty classroom. And then that became suspicious. He had at one point considered the Room of Hidden Things but he hadn’t even made it to the hallway in front of the door when he turned back. He just couldn’t do it.
“Mr. Malfoy, to help me understand if you’ll be getting more pieces of memories, I have to understand about how you got this one and what it was about. Or do you not want to know?”
Harry nodded, stopping where he was for a moment as Draco went off ahead of him. Then, he blinked harshly, snapping himself out of the trance he was in. What was he doing? He couldn’t let him just walk away.
Is it just me or does this fic have Entirely Different Vibes from when it started lmfao sorry for taking y’all on a TRIP you signed up for a lighthearted fic and uhhh,,,now we’re uh? here??
Brutally, his aunt had pulled up every memory she could find. She began with the most recent and started working her way backwards, finding a small gap from the past year and then able to pull up memories from his fifth year. From there, she continued moving back through Draco’s life, pulling up memory after memory. It was so painful, but he could access them all. Every memory that was moved away from Draco’s access by the head trauma was now found. They were raw like fresh burns, but he could touch them. He could remember them. She had only stopped when she found the extent of the damage, back just before he began at Hogwarts.
? I have to get back to the hospital wing. There’s supposed to be an obliviation expert from St. Mungo’s coming today and I hope I haven’t...missed...” Draco trailed off as he turned, looking until he spotted the door and running to it, flinging it open. His entire focus of coming here was to get answers but the expert could potentially give him more answers than Harry Potter.
? Where had he learned that? It would explain why he had such a reaction to someone being in his mind if he had had someone in there before. The only question was...who? Draco shuddered to think that it could have been
Tears welled up in his eyes. No, he couldn’t—how could he have—no. Biting his lip, He screwed his eyes shut. He couldn’t do it. Just—no.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Isn’t he hopeless?” He said to Hermione before turning his attention back to his best friend. “I think step one is talking to him, yes? Get together, have a good time, at the end you can arrange to meet again, but this time make clear that it’s a date. That’s all you have to do.”
Draco nodded in response, uncertain to whether Harry was still even there to see it or if he had already turned to walk away. He could only hope that he hadn’t been discovered by Pomfrey.
“No, wait, what did you mean?” Draco ran a little to catch up with him, finding Harry blushing and sputtering.
Okay, so if you don't follow me on tumblr, you didn't see the status update on this but I actually wrote this chapter and then didn't back it up before I fell asleep and LOST IT (hhhnnng it's fine i've only been backing up every single thing i've ever written for the last like ten years in like four places and the one fucking time i forget i lose everything i haven't been eye-twitching for days over this shit or anything)
“No, no, no, no,” he chanted, not even aware that he was saying it. “No, no, please, not another one, please, no, not someone else.”
“Drink up, Mr. Potter.” McGonagall set the teacup down in front of Harry but he didn’t reach out to take it, still staring at the opposite wall.
Their eyes met. “It’s the result of years of the two of us crossing lines. But,” he wiped his face on his sleeve. “This year was by far the worst. It started out and I kind of was...eavesdropping on you and your friends on the train underneath my invisibility cloak and you realized I was there and you petrified me and then stepped on my face and broke my nose and covered me with the invisibility cloak and left me there, hoping I would get taken all the way back to London.” He sniffed.
It seemed like a strange sort of fit, Draco teaching children. Not only that, but there was one other thing that Draco had neglected to mention to anyone else—even Harry on their date: McGonagall wanted him to be head of Slytherin house.
As he turned away, Ron was there for him to turn into and Ron wrapped his arms around his best friend while Harry sobbed. While he comforted Harry, Hermione approached Draco’s body.
me, a slytherin, crying in the corner: they're not evil!! they just want to do things!! ambition! does! not! mean! evil!!!!! let them know they are not bad, draco!!!
It was the same room that Draco had hidden out in that night before his father had come to pick him up. Harry had sat on the wall just outside the entire time as Draco sat in the chair and forced himself to not move because he knew that if he did, he would run to Harry and beg him for help. Like a coward.
Draco sat back against the pillows now that he was alone, terrified at what he had just done. Did he know
Both of his friends were quiet for a moment, trying to figure out how to talk him down from this through his grief.
“You know, I was thinking,” Harry began. “It’s kind of a shame neither of us are on our house teams anymore. I’m pretty sure you and I have some kind of Quidditch rivalry to settle.” He extended the broom. “Maybe once and for all?”
Not meeting Harry’s eyes, Draco cut him off. “I remember. I remember him threatening my mother.” It was true. He didn’t know where the memory had come from, but it was playing out in front of him so clearly; he couldn’t deny it.
Harry sighed. “I’m not coming on to you or anything. Just...unbutton your shirt. Take a look at your chest.”
Leaving Harry behind, Draco emerged out into the alley and quickly began walking towards Knockturn. It wasn’t until he reached the end of Knockturn that he found his aunt waiting for him.
After sending him a withering glare, Pansy turned around and followed, but not before saying, “I will be back in a moment and we will talk about this. Just after I go help Blaise.”
But he could also overhear more discussion. “We need to let him rest, we can’t all just go barging in there.” “But, please, can’t we just see him?” “We need to wait for him to be cleared by a mediwitch so that we can be sure—”
But here he was, sitting across from Draco Malfoy, neither of them wanting to be the first to speak, the first to break eye contact, the first to leave. Like a third year game of chicken.
Despite the nice tone of the night so far, Draco could feel it getting worse by the moment and while he was sort of hoping that he could fall asleep and dream about a certain pair of green eyes, he was a little afraid that a pair of red ones would creep up and cause him to wake up screaming so he stood and crossed the room.
Standing up, Draco knew one thing: he needed to look at himself in a mirror. He needed to know who he was.
Still crying—but softer now—Harry stood up. He gave a small nod and then pulled out his own wand. Casting quick before his friends could stop him, he put another spell on Draco.
“That’s bad,” Pansy said. She crossed her arms, looking at all the faces in front of her. “Well, do we at least know where Potter is or where he’s been for the last week? I don’t even really care about the git and I’m starting to get worried.”
am i throwing in a love triangle? no lol. i personally see blaise and draco as kind of doing the whole "I'm pretty sure i like guys maybe i should, *wink wink* kiss one and find out" thing together as lil baby gays yk two boys who are like "this is totally for research about how to kiss a girl we're just practicing" and while they both feel very deeply for each other, its more like a mix and mingle of platonic and romantic feelings and they know that it would never really work out together. harry has nothing to worry about, blaise and pansy just care about draco very very deeply.
He cast a quick glance around before getting out of bed and starting to creep over to the door. He would just have to sneak off to the owlery and—
“What did I say about the initial thing sounding like the news but not actually being the important thing?” Harry asked, exasperated.
So, yes, this was turning out to be a shit fucking day. And all he wanted was to have one motherfucking drink. Alone.
::::::CURRENTLY ON SEMI HIATUS--all my works are on semi hiatus while I am working on writing a long multichap so stay tuned and I will be back to this!!!
The man's eyes went wide, but his friends were watching Draco with guarded expressions, Ron’s hand still outstretched seemingly to protect the girl. Why?
With a sharp shake of his head, Draco pulled the sleeve back down. He knew he shouldn't torture himself with starting at it, but he always fell into that whenever he was feeling guilty. He would stare at the Dark Mark, think about the pain it had caused him and the difficulty it still brought him socially, and lose himself in guilt, thinking that he deserved it. After all, it wasn't like a Death Eater earned their Dark Mark by just asking for it. You had to do something. And Draco....Draco let them all in. He caused the death of—
as he had told Draco to call him after their third sign lesson—threw his hands in the air, once again exasperated with his own inability to perfect a signed phrase. He’d soon be throwing them up in triumph when he conquered it, just as he had all the others. Draco smiled at him good-naturedly, all too familiar with the ups and downs of learning a new language.
They moved in together two months later, after Draco’s lease was up. While they’d continue sharing a bedroom, they also knew it was important to each have their own spaces, so they outfitted a room in Grimmauld to Draco’s taste.
Rocking chairs sat in opposite corners, waiting for Harry and Draco to rock their tired children to sleep. For now, they provided a soothing place to get off their feet and rest. There was a shelf for storybooks to ease bedtime where a growing library had already started to form. The twins were well-loved and well cared for already.
Harry laughed at him again, louder this time. Just delighted with the world and his husband and their baby. “Your secret’s safe with me.” Harry kissed him, rolling Draco onto his back and climbing over him. He smiled wickedly. “Now it’s my turn, before I get too big to do this.”
They cohabitated well, though they weren’t without their arguments. Petty fights that sent one or the other stomping out of the room or the house to cool down (Draco complaining about Harry constantly leaving the top off the toothpaste so it dried out and became gross; Harry complaining about Draco constantly straightening his things, but never putting them in a place Harry could find). Sometimes they ran ranting into the ear of a sympathetic friend who listened to them vent, sometimes taking their side and other times not, and then telling them to go mend things. And they always did. Returning to each other with calmer attitudes and kinder words, letting the love they felt for each other be stronger than the fights that pitted them against each other.
Harry bound Draco to him, arms around his waist and pulling him down harder while thrusting his hips up. He slicked his hand with a wordless spell and grabbed both of their dicks in a firm grip, squeezing and sliding his hand up and down.
“That’s fine. You can carry our second little one,” Harry smiled, soft at the thought of their growing family.
Harry smiled at him. “Yeah. But don’t think I don’t know you kept a lot of that information in mind for when we would have kids. I saw your notes. Aren’t you glad to have that knowledge now?”
"They're beautiful," Harry said, watching a lotus blossom bloom under his gaze. Then his eyes returned to Draco's face. He looked reverent, like Draco was beautiful, too.
Harry finished unbuttoning and slowly peeled the shirt off, revealing a riot of colour and movement across Draco’s chest and up over his shoulders to mid-sleeve on each arm. Waves crashed and koi fish swam against the current and lotus flowers bloomed along Draco's skin. They didn’t cover his Dark Mark. Draco wanted the reminder of his past, so he knew never to repeat it. And they only partially covered the scars Harry left littered on his chest.
Harry and Draco were in the twins’ room, stuffing it full of more baby items. They’d decided not to know the genders before delivery, so the room was a soft grey with splashes of both blue and pink. Harry was putting sheets into the two mahogany baby beds that would change with the babies as they grew. There were beautiful star, moon, and cloud mobiles over both cribs that played soft music to lull the babies to sleep. Changing tables were built into the cribs and each had drawers full of changing necessities and diaper pails sat on the floor beside them.
Harry’s eyes widened in wonder, and he involuntarily placed a hand over his own growing belly. “No way,” he said.
actually had a routine and would not depend on Harry’s 3-in-1 shampoo/conditioner/shower gel combo to get the job done. He didn’t even have a facial cleanser! He just stared at Draco blankly when he’d asked about it and replied simply, “Soap?” Ugh.
Harry and Draco were tired, so tired. At month nine, it became nearly impossible to sleep comfortably and they spent as much time tossing and turning as they did actually sleeping. Body pillows didn’t always help and they’d curse when they just wanted to turn on their backs, but couldn’t. There were nights where they both gave up and retired to the couch to watch the telly into the early morning.
Harry similarly had an assortment of things scattered around Draco’s flat. Clothes and puzzles and aftershave. It was like they were a joint unit maintaining two households, spending near equal time in each.
Draco slowed down, bringing Harry more into the conversation, and Sophie naturally followed suit. When Draco and Harry got lost in a tangent, Sophie stomped her foot, bringing their attention back to her so that she could continue to contribute to the conversation. Draco coloured at having gotten lost in Harry, which was becoming a frequent problem. Sophie smirked at him knowingly, but said nothing else on the matter.
Assorted grandchildren ran around the house and all of them took pleasure in putting a hand to Harry’s belly, swiftly withdrawing it when they felt his baby kick, squealing and laughing among themselves, then placing their hands back to his stomach to start again.
Harry didn’t need any more invitation than that, hands coming around Draco to hold him impossibly closer, intentionally grinding into him now, moving his hips and making Draco’s brain short circuit. A moan burst from his lips that Harry swallowed down greedily.
Draco also introduced Harry to his muggle friend, Sophie. The muggles had a better and more extensive Deaf community than wizards did, so Draco branched out when he didn’t get exactly the care and training he needed after his accident. And he’d met Sophie, who was a leader and teacher in the local Deaf community and had taught Draco loads, as well as become his friend.
“You’re not getting fat,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “We don’t even gain more than a pound or two during the first three months.”
Harry looked at him in confusion before finally noticing the few people who were still staring at them. He coloured slightly in embarrassment before grinning to himself over his own inattention.
Draco was folding yet more baby blankets and putting them away in the closet. The closet was nearly full to bursting with the number of baby clothes they’d acquired. Not only was Draco fond of shopping for the twins, but their friends and family kept them well supplied with all manner of baby accoutrements. There were rattles and teething rings and baby pillows and bath toys and bottles at the ready.
By the middle of the fourth week, still neither of them was pregnant and Draco was gathering the list of ingredients for a new batch of fertility potion in his head, assessing which ingredients they still had and which he’d have to go buy more of. He was just about to write them down lest he forget any when he heard a crash come from their living room.
They learned about each other’s odd habits. Harry talked to himself rather a lot. Just thinking aloud, but often saying only part of his internal monologue, rather than the whole thing. Draco probably watched Harry more than was normal, but he noticed when Harry’s lips moved in silent conversation, his expression changing as he discussed something with himself.
Harry stuck his head in the doorway. “Hey, Draco, what do you—,” he cut himself off when he saw Draco staring absently, one hand on his stomach and the other dangling a forgotten spritz bottle. He caught Draco’s gaze and both of their eyes widened in realisation.
Harry didn’t bother answering Draco, but went to the closet and pulled down exactly the jumper Draco was looking for.
These Harry put his hand to, looking at Draco with remorse. A silent apology was written across his face, regret for the mistakes of his childhood self. He bent and kissed them, the closest to atonement he could get after so long. Draco pulled his head back up and kissed him. Forgiveness.
Potter was still speaking when he leaned forward, taking his mouth out of Draco’s direct line of sight, to grab his own box of tea. When he straightened back up and placed the tea in his own basket, he looked at Draco expectantly, as if he’d asked a question and was waiting for Draco to answer him.
Draco tried to stop the lunacy, grabbing at Harry’s hands to still the performance, but Harry kept on signing his ludicrous story. It turned into a play fight, them tumbling off the sofa and rolling on the floor. Laughing in each other’s faces and hands tickling at vulnerable skin. Their legs tangled and Harry’s pressed against Draco
Harry tended to crave the sweet things, asking Draco to bring him back all manner of treats when he went out. And when Draco wasn’t out, poor Kreacher and Tippy were sent scurrying, trying to fulfil the desires of both Harry and Draco’s tummies.
When it snapped, they were on top of each other again. Draco took the lead, pushing Harry back onto the sofa and straddling his legs, attaching his mouth back to Harry's. He ground his hips down into Harry's lap, both of them emitting gut-deep groans into each other's mouths.
After another few minutes, his pleading worked. Harry helped ease him from the floor and they retired to their bed, both crashing down amongst the covers like they hadn’t laid down in years.
But even if there was no love yet, there was worship. Harry took tongue and lips to Draco's skin and paid homage. Whispering praise into Draco's body like a prayer.
year and began dating shortly after graduation. Draco helped him fix up Grimmauld and then moved in with him their second year together. After three years of dating, Harry decided he knew what he wanted for the rest of his life and asked Draco to marry him. They were married less than a year later and had only grown closer in that time. And now, they were ready to expand their family.
Harry laughed at him and grabbed his hand, urging him to leave his flowers be and bring his book so they could retire back to relaxing on the chaise. Draco gave his roses one more spritz before joining his husband.
Draco brewed the fertility potion himself though they had to wait a month for it to finish stewing. When it was finally complete, they both ladled a serving into their glasses and toasted.
Harry stared down at their children, their small faces turned up and their tiny limbs ensconced in blankets.
Draco watched Harry in the corner of the club, laughing with Pansy, and showing off his arm muscles as he lifted his glass to drink. The disco lights flashed and threw Harry into even greater relief, illuminating every lightning-bright part of him. He suddenly looked over and spotted Draco by the bar, his eyes warming upon recognition and a tiny smirk played about his lips. He winked at Draco before returning his attention back to Pansy and Draco’s insides melted before sinking.
Draco was relaxing on the sofa when he felt a flutter in his stomach. His eyes widened and he immediately put a hand to his belly, hoping to feel it again. He knew what it was, of course. Pansy and Hermione had prepped them for this and a million other things when they found out the boys were pregnant. But while Draco had heard what it would feel like, he hadn’t expected how it would make
He had just grabbed the sampler when a hand touched his shoulder. Draco jumped, startled, and twisted around to find the owner of the hand. Harry Potter stood there, blushing and smiling sheepishly for having frightened Draco, and withdrew his hand.
When he found it, he pressed a kiss to Harry’s sweaty chest before withdrawing from his body. He helped Harry resituate and they both crashed onto their bed, too tired to clean themselves up just yet. The house elves could freshen their bedding later.
, with muscles rippling under his shirt, a wide back and shoulders, and thighs that Draco would happily let crush his skull. His bird’s nest was still a dishevelled mess, but it looked more intentional now, more artfully tousled or “just shagged aftermath” than crime against style. His jaw had become strong and square enough to cut glass. His eyes were still piercing and his magic still electric, but only
with him to do it, his pent up desire for their relationship to evolve into this, but Harry bent his head slowly, giving Draco ample time to stop it if he wanted, as if Draco
He was just beginning to think he’d like something sweet when Baby A gave a confirming little nudge.
Harry hadn’t had quite the mental crisis Draco did when his stomach started to “balloon,” as Draco called it, but that’s because he’d never been as uptight about his figure as Draco was. Harry liked his lean body well enough, but there was always something about it that reminded him of the malnourished kid he’d been. But still, it was a body Draco liked. Would he still like Harry’s changing figure?
“I think it feels more urgent now,” Harry remarked. “We have one more week before the potion wears off.”
On the final day of the third week, Harry had just collapsed on their bed after pounding away in Draco. Draco lay exhausted, arm thrown over his eyes and chest rising and falling with his laboured breathing.
He could look back with the fondness that time allows, despite how irritated he’d been during the process himself. Grasping British Sign Language had been a task. Draco’s fingers had tangled around the unfamiliar patterns, his mind stumbled over translating English sentences into BSL grammar patterns. But in time, he grew faster, smoother, with his words. Getting his name right had taken ages. He’d been as slow as a Dementor at first, slogging through each letter of D-R-A-C-O M-A-L-F-O-Y when introducing himself to someone new. But as he got better, moved from beginner to a more proficient intermediate, the sign came like muscle memory: fast, but still legible.
Harry buried his hands in Draco’s hair, sweeping the long locks aside to get at more of Draco’s neck. As he moved to start unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, he suddenly stopped.
It would linger in their bodies for a month, ready and waiting for one of them to activate it and start changing their bodies, preparing them for the coming baby.
“Me, too,” he said and signed. “Months now. I love you so much, Harry. I just didn’t think it could happen.”
Harry had a girl and they agreed on the name Aurora. Their little sunrise. Aurora Ava Malfoy-Potter. She was born first and Harry just knew she would hold that over her twin’s head when they got older.
And the makeup sex was always worth it. It would often be fast and furious, fully releasing the pent-up emotions from their fight, before turning slow and tender, an apology and expression of their love.
Harry ran his fingers across his belly. He’d felt little Baby A flutter a while back and they’d moved on to jabbing Harry with their knees and elbows, making him wince in discomfort frequently. Still, Harry loved when he’d speak softly to his baby and Baby A would respond with a little movement of their own.
Draco softened, reached over to smooth his hand across Harry’s cheek. “I can brew some more potion, Harry. We can try as long as we like. It’s bound to happen eventually. Not everyone conceives straight away, remember. We knew going in that it could take a while.”
The café they used to frequent for their sign lessons became their regular date spot when they wanted to get out of the house, but not necessarily see their friends.
Potter’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, but to Draco’s even greater astonishment, Potter made no remark on his condition. He only vocally repeated himself and freed his hands to start slowly making some rudimentary signs, spelling words out when he didn’t know how to sign them.
Draco noticed how Potter began talking slower after his confession so that Draco could read his lips better. He signed the words he knew and used his hands to emphasise in places where the signed words were beyond him. Draco dropped his guard some, unconsciously relaxing his shoulders when Potter proved he wasn’t an arsehole like many hearing people Draco had met, and actually knew how to talk to and treat deaf people.
hear them, and could they please repeat themselves where he could see them speak? Draco wasn’t ashamed of being deaf. Not at all. It may have been an accident that took his hearing, but he’d fought a long, hard road to get him to where he was now and he felt proud, accomplished. It was just that he could never predict the reaction of others when they found out, if they’d start looking at him as
Draco coloured slightly as well. It was always a little awkward when meeting someone, or seeing them for the first time in a while in Potter’s case, when they didn’t know Draco’s condition and spoke to him without his knowing.
Harry pushed into Draco slowly. Their sex drive had been barmy for weeks now and they were taking each other nearly as much as they had that month when they were trying to get pregnant.  Draco grabbed onto Harry’s arms like a lifeline. Luckily, sex wasn’t yet awkward for them. Though they’d started showing into their second trimester, their bumps were still small enough that they only had to be a little careful not to put too much pressure onto their tummies.
Harry drew Draco into his arms, trying to comfort him. “You just said it. We’re pregnant together. We’ll get through this together, just like everything else. And we’ll have help. Hermione and Pansy are a frightening team when they’re organising things. Our lives will be micromanaged to perfection; have no fear.”
Well, Draco assumed he shouted. Harry’s balled fists were thrust in the air and his mouth had opened rather wide, and more than a few eyes in the café had turned in their direction to see what all the fuss was about. Though they could have been staring because there was sign language happening at their table. That always drew the eyes of the hearing, for some reason.
Draco plopped down on the sofa and settled in for another movie when Harry sat down beside him, much more tentatively than Draco thought warranted for a Marvel movie. He turned his attention to Harry, who was looking at him hesitantly, and raised his eyebrows in question.
Potter had moved into the house his godfather left him after finishing Hogwarts. It’d taken him some time to make it liveable, apparently, but it was finally a place he enjoyed being. Draco was surprised to learn it was the Black house. He had vague memories of being there to visit his ancient aunt. She had scared him as a child, stern and disapproving.
Nothing happened for the first few weeks. They were going at it daily, sometimes a couple of times a day. Draco taking Harry hard and fast during one of their lunchtime rendezvous. Harry making love to Draco nice and slow in the evening as they wound down from the day.  Draco licking Harry open, making him whimper and come with his mouth on his hole alone before sliding into his heat. Harry teasing Draco to distraction, sliding their cocks together so slowly that Draco cursed him up and down before begging Harry to fuck him, and Harry finally obliging.
Draco settled himself in front of the telly and turned on Graham Norton. Graham used to be a guilty pleasure of Draco’s, but he didn’t have the patience to pretend anymore. Graham was hilarious and had Draco laughing uproariously weekly.
He smiled at Draco in a way that was full of both joy and jealousy, as if he wanted to feel the baby within him move, too. Draco knew he’d feel it within the next week or so. They didn’t share all the same pregnancy symptoms, but the major developments tended to happen to both of them almost simultaneously.
“And since the sign for the letter D is this….” Draco used his left pointer finger to make a straight line and the pointer and thumb from his right hand to make a backwards letter C and combined the two.
Harry looked up at him again, clearly trying to figure out the question. Draco stared at him, knowing too much and not enough was painted all over his face. It didn't take long for Harry to get it.
It was after one of these makeup sessions that Draco lay panting, Harry hovering over him and mouthing something into his skin. Draco thought Harry was just kissing him at first, until he recognised the repetitive lip movements as a pattern, and one he had seen on Harry’s lips many times. It took him a while to realise Harry was mouthing “I love you” directly into Draco’s skin.
Harry smiled sheepishly, a direct contrast to his ferociousness while he’d been annihilating Draco’s insides, and continued to rub Draco’s back.
Draco groaned when a particularly hard spot was worked and felt like he practically dissolved when the muscle released. This was exactly what he needed. He and Harry giving each other back rubs and foot massages were great, but there was magic in the hands of Draco’s masseur.
“That’s true. But you also know I am more than up to dealing with your tempers. I can work those right out of you,” Harry answered, wagging his eyebrows in a ridiculous manner that he surely thought was lascivious.
now and Draco honestly thought that was a bit unfair. He laughed like thunder. Deep and loud with his head thrown back and a vibration that reverberated through Draco, awakening every part of him. And when Harry smiled, ...well, Draco didn’t quite have words for how good it made him feel. Warm and light and buoyant.
Draco wasn’t sure how it happened, but the more he and Harry hung out, the more time they spent in each other’s homes and lives and with each other’s friends, Draco realised that he was seeing Harry and feeling about Harry in a more than friendly way. Harry had always been attractive, even if Draco wouldn’t have admitted such a thing when he was younger, even if he was on his deathbed. And to be fair, Harry had been a speccy git and scrawny to boot, with a bird’s nest on his head that had apparently never seen a comb in its life. But he’d had those eyes that pierced into you and magic that, while not all-powerful like the press enjoyed pretending, could still be explosive and dazzling when brought to the fore.
It was a pleasant surprise to find that they both lived nearby. Draco had moved to muggle London following the war. For a time, he’d been shunned by the wizarding world and sought the anonymity of muggles to escape the scorn. But even after he’d fought his way back into wizarding respectability, even becoming a member of the esteemed Unspeakables, he preferred the peace he found in places where no one knew of his past.
Harry moved over to him and looped his arms around Draco’s waist, both of them looking at their reflections in the mirror.
“How did this even happen?!” Draco complained. Fretted. “Shouldn’t your sperm have deactivated once you got pregnant?!”
Draco let his hands wander, finally getting them on Harry's muscles like he'd been dying to. Squeezing his shoulders, his back, his abs. He grabbed two fistfuls of Harry's arse and Harry broke the kiss to groan into Draco’s neck, the vibrations of it tickling Draco’s throat. Draco chuckled, massaging the arse he would rather like to bite and, as if hearing his thoughts, Harry sunk his teeth into Draco’s neck instead.
They somehow got closer after that. While they had spent plenty of time together before they’d kissed, now they were practically inseparable. They each still had their own interests and their own friends (though the friend group was becoming increasingly difficult to tell apart), but they were much more likely to be found in each other’s company than not. Draco may sit around idly painting while Harry worked on one of his several-hundred piece puzzles, but they were together.
“The BSL sign for flower looks like this.” Draco pinched his pointer finger and thumb together with his other fingers spread out, as if he held a flower. He drew his hand across his face, under his nose, like he was smelling the flower, while also mouthing the word.
Harry smiled at him and leaned over to give him a kiss. “You’re right. I should stop worrying. It’ll happen soon enough.”
Draco got used to reading lips, though it was one of the least effective communication methods at his disposal. Too many lip-shapes and tongue patterns were the same, their meaning lost without enough context. But for predictable exchanges, particularly with people he knew well, it was still a beneficial skill.
Draco’s brows rose further before he really considered the idea. Really, they practically lived together already. They were together almost every day and rarely slept alone. They cooked together, cleaned together, and were already as domestic as could be imagined. Draco was now privy to more of Harry’s disgusting habits than he’d ever cared to know before, and he still loved him more than he thought he could bear. Harry now knew of Draco’s neediness and insecurities and was never hesitant to give him the attention and reassurance that he needed. Draco could readily believe that they were in this for the long haul.
Harry cursed, taking what felt like his fiftieth piss of the morning. Little Baby A was causing him to lose quite a lot of fluid.
Eventually, Draco was able to breathe and he looked up at Harry, knowing his face was red and wrecked with tears.
Draco laughed at that, his eyes crinkling alongside his smile. Harry’s heart could have melted and honestly? Fuck that feeling. “You’ve always been unobservant.”
“Hey, sleepyhead,” Harry said, a smile on his face. “Welcome back to the land of the living. You know, I think you and I took different routes back.”
“Calm down?" Ron turned towards his friend now, his tone changing from lighthearted to a tad angry. "Harry, he's done nothing but insult us for five and a half years. I don't particularly care if he's distressed."
Did I ever mention that I LOVE Ron Weasley (AKA Best Friend Ever AKA The Samwise Gamgee of This Series AKA Our King) SO MUCH
“I don’t suppose you know anything about what the Slytherin dorms look like...?” Draco asked hesitantly.
he had to never go back there. It was so strange to have these feelings but never be knowing where they were coming from.
Still unable to look down to see the Dark Mark marring his skin, he turned back to look at Harry who was sitting with his elbows on his knees, hunched over.
“Oh,” Hermione said, realizing what he was thinking about. “Right. Ron, that has nothing to do with Blaise and Pansy. Just because—”
Sitting up, he ran his hands down his face, sighing. Would this relationship with Potter even work out? What was he getting himself into?
Moving closer, Bill dropped the invisibility cloak to the side and held his hand just below Draco’s nose.
It wasn’t his style at all, of course, and he could never pull off that causal sort of wear but they were just very different people, is all. And it just so happened to be that everything about Harry that Draco wasn’t, Draco was attracted to.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Malfoy said but nothing about it said that he was sorry. “I mean, not that I’m that surprised; I was gone for seven years.”
He was on a pathway out of town when something caught his eye at the edge of a building. It was Draco, and he was walking towards Harry.
He met Draco’s eyes, fully recovered now. “Sorry. I was just a little...confused. I could have sworn you were dating Parkinson.”
Harry was aware that he was sitting with both of his arms out and his eyes wide, staring off into the distance like he was absolute batshit high but this was a game changer. This was a bring-the-train-to-a-full-stop kind of situation because that was the most unbelievable realization that Harry had made ever since he learned he was a fucking wizard.
Rumor was that after eighth year he had run off to France and stayed there for a damn while. Permanently was the info that Harry heard. What was he possibly doing back?
Because at the end of this, through all of it, they were still Harry and Draco. And that didn’t even consider everything that was going to happen when the goddamn press found out.
A little embarrassed now, Harry raised one shoulder in a half-shrug. “Every year Minerva offers me the defense position. It’s still sort of cursed, you know. They haven’t been able to find a teacher that lasts more than a year. But, I don’t know. I don’t feel like I’d be a good teacher.”
His and the wediwitch's attention were both drawn away as the door burst open and three teenagers barreled in, one slung between the other two. Two were in deep maroon, Gryffindor quidditch gear, the other was a girl of the same age. But Draco's eyes were immediately drawn to the one in the center.
It took a long second for Harry to process that information. No, that was wrong. They dated. They definitely dated. Harry clearly remembered...on the train sixth year. Weren’t there other things? They dated. They definitely dated. “What do you mean you didn’t date Parkinson?”
“Okay.” Draco took a deep breath. “The Death Eaters are at their endgame. They’re going to invade Hogwarts. I need the Order to act like they are entirely unprepared. My cover as a spy has been blown. Snape’s hasn’t, but it’s close. You—”
. That doesn’t sound to me like the position that I want to be in, especially considering that if Harry doesn’t get a hold of it, he won’t have all of the Deathly Hallows. So yeah, it sounds really fucking bad to me.”
With a deep breath, Harry steadied himself for the avada. But his concentration was ripped away when he saw the Dark Lord’s wand fly from his hand.
Immediately, Harry stood and walked to Draco, hands outstretched. Seeing that Draco was clearly beginning to panic, he placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Hey, hey,” he said softly, looking into Draco’s eyes. “You need to calm down.”
Naturally, legilimency can open a two-way street and Draco had tried to use that to the best of his advantage.
Draco let his shirt fall open and took one last breath staring at Harry’s face before looking down, hoping that whatever this was wouldn’t change things.
Silence hung heavy in the room as both women at the foot of the bed stared at him in incredulity. Eventually, however, Ms. Topfeld righted herself and straightened her jacket. Without a word, she turned and headed back in the direction of the floo. Ms. Pomfrey shot him a bit of a glare before running off after her.
Draco heard a cry as the world righted itself, his consciousness coming back into the hospital wing. Ms. Topfeld has crashed onto the floor and was staggering to her feet, holding her forehead. She glared at him angrily.
Quickly, Draco stopped, fisting his hands in the sheets, eyes wide open, and began narrating out loud to himself. "I am in my flat. I am in Hogsmeade. I am in bed. I am safe. I am twenty-four years old. The war is over. I am safe from the feindfyre. I am safe from the feindfyre. The war is over. I am safe from the feindfyre."
The date had gone well (up until that last no-kiss bit), Draco would admit. He even made Harry laugh a couple of times. Most of the time it felt good, but there were a couple of moments when that same guilt would creep in and seeing Harry happy would hurt. Not because he wanted him to be anything but happy, but because he felt like it was his fault that this hadn't all happened sooner. It was like after the war everyone had to train themselves to be normal again.
“Why don’t you come with me? Let’s go sit in another room and you can say goodbye to Draco at the funeral.”
“Okay, fine,” Ron said. “What about Draco? If everyone is moving to their endgame, then what are the Death Eaters planning to do with him? He could be drawn into this somehow and—”
Draco was still reeling. What did she mean he had been oblivated? When? By whom? He was at Hogwarts? This didn't make any sense. He was going to have to tell Father and—
, sorry I know he’s your head of house. I just hate him. And he used to teach potions and now he’s teaching my favorite subject, defense, and— Why are you laughing?”
Pausing now, Draco stared off into the distance in his state of utter terror. Harry remained where he was, giving Draco space.
With that, Harry turned and began to walk away from the place of death, wanting to be as far away as possible.
Slowly, Ron put his hand over Harry’s that was holding the two extra wands. “It’s okay, Harry. He’s the last one—you aren’t going to lose anyone else to this war. I know it hurts. But you have to let him rest. You can’t wait forever.”
After Draco finally let go of him, Harry pulled back. “Should we go someplace else to talk?” Harry asked.
Malfoy’s eyes didn’t leave Harry’s as he wrapped his fingers around the drink, his body turning so that he faced Harry. Regarding him for only a moment, he left the counter and walked across the room, stopping only when he was a few feet from Harry’s table.
He had told Ron and Hermione about the letter and where he was going, just in case. Clearly, it was from Draco, but these days, Harry knew he could never be so sure. He didn’t want to die before the time was right because then everyone would be even more screwed. And there was something about the letter that felt odd to him. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.
Harry stood frozen for half a second too long as Voldemort screamed, his anger ruffling through the entire forest. Wandlessly, Voldemort disarmed Snape from next to him—Snape clearly distracted as he tried to mentally recalculate his own useless plan to get the Elder Wand to Harry—and before anyone could do anything, Voldemort yelled, “Avada kedavra!”
Sitting in the parlor at the Manor, Bill Weasley sighed. “He really hasn’t come out? In two whole days?”
“What was it?” Ms. Topfeld asked, again looking him directly in the eyes. Draco jerked, avoiding her gaze. Something told him to do so.
It was barely a few minutes before she wandered over to him, clearly surprised at seeing him. “You’re awake,” she remarked. “I’m so sorry for this morning, Draco, but that student got a nasty burn in potions that I had to work out. Well, I just wanted to come and give you a heads up, as I’m fairly certain the expert from St. Mungo’s should be on her way.”
He blinked his eyes open, the harsh light making him wince. With more rapid blinking they adjusted and he found himself inside a hospital wing he had never seen before.
So, anyway. The first draft was /much/ better and I tried to write in as much as I remembered from it and because of that the writing might seem a little clunky or forced so forgive me but I've written this chapter twice in the last week and my brain is SHOT but it's FINE so please have a little forgiveness about this chapter.
But Remus put a hand on his shoulder, effectively stopping him. “Let’s all go upstairs, okay? I’ll fill everyone in.”
Draco had assumed she meant his potions ability and the fact that he was a Slytherin, but there was more to it than that, as she had said. And what McGonagall told him was actually what made him take the job in the first place.
Once they were in a room upstairs with the door closed behind them, Ron, Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise all looked expectantly at Remus. He was the adult here, after all, and he was really the only one with any kind of access to what the Order knew about.
But the Dark Lord had looked at Draco and when he expected pain, none came. Instead, the Dark Lord spoke to him.
“The Deathly Hallows weren’t what brought me back. Dumbledore was there and he—he said all this about what really makes you the master of death and all of this and—” Abruptly, Harry pulled back. “If the Deathly Hallows aren’t what really make you the master of death then that means…” He stopped and all the fight left him. Slowly, Harry laid back down on the bed.
Harry walked quietly around Hogsmeade, trying not to draw attention to himself. He had made the decision: that day he had given his notice at the aurors department and had spoken to McGonagall about the Defense position at the school. She told him it was all his for the next year. Everything was set up. Now, Harry was actually considering moving to the small town, now that he had fewer commitments elsewhere. He typically flooed or apparated to see his friends anyway.
Time hung heavy in the air, palpable, before Draco smiled and said, “Sure, Potter. Owl me,” and turned to continue on his way.
“No,” Harry said and his voice was surprisingly steady. “We’re not going to touch him. No one is going to touch him. You have to at least give the Deathly Hallows their—their—their time to work.”
Draco said “Okay” and it was barely audible before he succumbed to sleep. When he woke up again, Harry was sitting next to him on the bed, his back against the headboard.
“Ron, you made him cry! He doesn't remember anything since he was eleven. Can't you see how difficult that would be? I don't care how he treated us because that's not what he needs right now."
Well. Now Harry’s brain was on a whole new rollercoaster. Because all of this made great sense when you put together the Parkinson thing and the Greengrass thing and not to mention all of that—
And his head hurt like...well like someone had thrown him against a wall. He reached a hand up, groaning. That sound alerted what he assumed to be a meditwitch to come bustling in.
“Yeah, thanks for the philosophy lesson. But turns out, I do know that. Through intimate experience. I didn’t run away, did I? I knew what was going to happen and I accepted it. And of course I know there are far worse things than dying.” Harry began to tear up, thinking of all of his lost loved ones. “When you’re the one that dies, it’s all over. You don’t have to worry about any of it anymore, you don’t have to fight anymore. But to be the one that survives…that’s worse than dying. To watch Sirius fall behind that curtain. To grow up without ever knowing my parents. To watch Draco die in the final moments of the fight—just before things ended for good. Being left behind is far worse than dying.”
Everyone in the room looked at each other, confusion clear on their faces. Because if the Deathly Hallows had worked, wouldn’t Draco have woken up already?
Grimacing, Harry squirmed a tad. “I don’t know. Lots of things. Paperwork is boring, being in duels gives me war flashbacks, I hate the Ministry....Things like that.”
He felt Harry’s warm hand closing around his right wrist, compelling him to open his eyes. Draco did, meeting Harry’s green ones but still refusing to look down. He couldn’t bear to see that ugly thing marring his skin.
harry, staring at pansy confused because didn't he already know that draco found that parseltongue stuff hot? draco, panicking because There Is More To It Pansy Has All The Secrets
In the end, he had to sacrifice himself. He fed Bellatrix pieces of information—mostly true, but containing a few fabrications. He gave her the memories from the hospital wing at Hogwarts. She looked through the memories of him realizing he was a Death Eater, and realizing he was in love with Harry Potter. She saw everything about the mirror and the conversations and Draco deciding he was going to become a spy. But he was able to fabricate a small piece that made her believe he had been feeding Harry the information directly through the mirror, leaving Snape and his mother out of it.
But Draco couldn't have anything easy in his life, could he? Not a simple relationship with a nice man. No. It had to be Potter.
Draco began to tear up. “You know Bellatrix has desperately been trying to get in my mind. She wanted to see the extent of the obliviate so that the Dark Lord could send me back to the work I was doing sixth year as his insider at Hogwarts. The Dark Lord convened a meeting and everyone just sat there as he commanded me to look into her eyes and she tore my mind apart. It was all I could do to not let her know about Snape and Pansy polyjuicing into me. So I had to feed her something that she thought I was hiding in order to trick her. And I gave her you and the mirror and me reporting on the Death Eaters to you.”
Whelp, folks, this is it!!! The last chapter!! (Well, okay, there’s also an Epilogue coming after this but this is the last official chapter)
There was, indeed, an owl downstairs and many of the Order members were attempting to coax her into being a little calmer. She had a note with her, but was flying around the room, determined to not let anyone take it. A few of the Order members appeared to be bleeding on their hands and forearms from where she must have pecked at them if they tried to take the note.
Without thinking—just on feeling—Blaise reached out and grabbed Pansy’s wrist at the same moment she reached for her wand.
“Well, I do." Draco peeked out through his fingers at that. Harry was trying to stand, leaning up against the chair arm for support."And you don’t have to be here so you can leave.” And leave Ron did.
The man was crying out in pain as his friends tugged him in. The boy on his left—a redhead with sloppy freckles—looked to the meditwitch. "Pomfrey, he fell off his broom. Again. Trying to pull off some fancy trick, no doubt."
Draco’s mind was so overrun with fear that he barely was listening to what was being said. Until, that is, the attention of the Dark Lord was on him.
i promise they're gonna be professors in like 2 chapters lol finally gonna deliver on my tags fowfscsoiesgfkzj
To tell the truth, he had no fucking clue how it worked. But he did know one thing—Voldemort was currently in possession of the Elder wand.
draco is RIGHT. abt what, you ask? well draco is right abt many things in this chapter take your pick
Pomfrey gave him a stern glare that said he shouldn't be interfering but he didn't seem deterred. They both looked to Draco for the answer.
He felt her beginning to push into his mind and his arms came up as if to fight to her off. But what could he do? He had no idea how to defend from her invasion. All he knew was that he wanted her
also after writing To The Memory Of Love, i have just felt so exhausted to like "write through the war" like its just so much work all the horcrux hunting and the deathly hallows like its exhauuuuusting and i didn't want to do it again sooo.... hence where this fic is headed lmfao
Pulling him close, Draco whispered hurriedly into his ear, “They made me. They made me lure you here. I’m so sorry, Harry, I love you so much, please tell me you didn’t come alone?”
It would be more difficult later in the semester when it got too cold to be sitting outside all the time without a warming charm, but for now, it was pleasant and he would spend the afternoons and evenings either here or in the kitchens, depending on when the teams were practicing. And the only person who knew he was here was Pansy.
“Well, if you’re feeling better, we should probably get walking. At this point, we’re not getting back until well after curfew and I think it would be wise if we were found together so you don’t get into an unnecessary amount of trouble when this was my fault, really.”
The room stopped, looking at Harry as the owl came to rest atop a bookcase. Harry outstretched his hand to her. “If that’s for me, might I have it?” But the owl didn’t move.
This is it!!!! This is THE chapter, folks, the whole reason I started writing this fic. The speech in this chapter is what inspired me to write the entire fic and I am so glad that we are finally here and I hope you all love it!
That’s when it clicked for Harry why Malfoy had such an intense reaction. “Hey! Our exes are dating each other.”
The tension melted out of Harry’s shoulders. After years of fighting this battle, it was time for him to rest. To give it all up. Whether or not Voldemort could be killed after all of his horcruxes were destroyed was beyond Harry’s concern now. He had done his part—he had done all that he could. And now it was time for Harry to set it aside. Maybe, in whatever form of afterlife that existed, he could find a time to be happy. Happy and unafraid and surrounded by those that he loved.
But then, Draco blinked, releasing a single tear to roll down his face. Quietly, he spoke, his voice raw. “It’s not just me that needs help. It’s my family. He threatened my family.”
Harry stopped him, holding him by the shoulders before he could leave the safety of the cloak. “I need you to do me a favor.”
He was required to come back to Hogwarts for his eighth year as part of his probation (although he couldn’t imagine why. If it were up to Draco, he would try and cut off all magical education of someone who he perceived as his enemy but it was probably just so they could keep a close eye on him). Unfortunately, none of his friends had come back except Pansy and she was piled under studies. They were still great friends, of course—they were practically all the other had. But even they both had to admit that they needed a break from the other’s theatrics every now and then. There were times that being drama queens went perfect together and times that it just made them both frustrated.
YES draco keeps a button in his pocket at all times in case he ever needs to transfigure anything into anything and when he's done turns it back into a button and puts it back in his pocket. if harry could figure out something like this, it would have saved his ASS many times as an auror
Still avoiding those piercing eyes, Draco responded. “The memory was triggered by a conversation I was having. It was involved my mother and the conversation began to steer her way and I remembered it. It was also a memory with a severe emotional attachment, as I was very distressed in the creating of it. It seemed to come from the past year or two. Is there any other information you might need, Ms. Topfeld?”
Now, Ron’s eyes lit up and he pointed at Hermione excitedly. “Holy shit, you’re right! We had all these theories about Quidditch players but in actuality he just had a few crushes.” Ron crashed back in his chair and muttered, “Holy shit, that makes so much sense.”
Narcissa’s eyes looked sad, likely remembering how recent it was that her son suffered from amnesia. “What do you remember, dear?”
“You really don’t remember anything?” Harry asked. Draco shook his head and something in Harry’s eyes changed. “Well, then. I’m Harry. Harry Potter. Nice to meet you, Draco.”
Reaching into his pocket, Harry withdrew the resurrection stone and placed it in Draco’s upturned, empty palm.
“Harry,” Hermione said, standing slowly. “All I’m going to do is move him into the body bag and we’ll take him back to the Manor. Narcissa has already arranged the funeral. Let’s bring him home. To his mum.”
“I—” Narcissa began before she paused, finding it hard to speak past her grief. “I think I would like to wait here with him. I know I have to, but I’m not sure I’m ready to leave him yet—” She cut off, her eyes jumping down to her hand.
This chapter is slightly longer than normal cause we’re getting close to the end so I had more I wanted to fit in :)
Draco gladly offered him the broom and Harry climbed on, intending to fly around in circles a few moments, but he wasn’t able to get off the ground for more than a few seconds.
He blinked his eyes open, wincing in the harsh light. His head hurt like hell and he reached a hand up, covering his eyes while they adjusted. Once he lowered it again, he realized he was in the hospital wing.
JFLAJFL these notes were on the first draft of the chapter, not this one, but i still feel like y'all would like to see them:
Harry waited, hearing the mangled sound of anger that told him Voldemort was somewhere to his right.
His friends thought about it for a moment. “I don’t think it’s likely,” Hermione said. “If he’s relocating from France to work at Hogwarts, then he would break off any relationship, most likely, unless it was very serious. I think you have a shot. Hey,” she said, her eyes lighting up. “I do occasionally work with Zabini down at the Ministry. I know the two have kept in contact over the years. I can talk to him about it.”
Laying back down, he pulled the covers up around him and took a few deep breaths before dropping back into the dreaded world of dreams.
Draco shook the thought of their death away from him. If he lingered on it, he just may go insane. There was always the possibility that the letter had gotten intercepted or, less likely, lost. Of course. That had to be it.
“No, really, it’s not, I promise.” Harry set his firebolt down and walked over to Draco. “Here, let me try it.”
"Well, shit," he muttered, as he realized something else. Dating Harry Potter was going to be a lot of things like that. Probably a fair share of humiliating from the press, Harry's friends. He supposed he would just have to get used to it and try to get some
Draco was silent a moment, breathing deep like speaking was difficult. “I remember…Bellatrix. Gave me the memories back. And then…Harry. It was a trap. And then. I took the Dark Lord’s wand. And after that…Nothing. How did I get here?”
and no one particularly cares if he ends up making it out of this war alive! So excuse me if I want to know
