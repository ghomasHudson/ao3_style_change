“Shh,” Harry says. “Sit down for a minute, honey. I’ll go talk to the police.”
Harry bolted to a standing position and threw his hands in the air. "Draco! You
"Okay." Harry grinned, dopey. "You know, Draco, I was thinking."
They tumbled out of their little apartment and all the way to the nearest courthouse. Draco insisted the baby would be okay if they apparated, but Harry couldn’t stop looking between the stars dimly shining through the city lights and Draco’s face, white and happy in the darkness. So they walked. And when they got there, the courthouse was closed.
dying!"
Draco glanced to Harry, who was still staring vaguely out the window, and smiled. "Just a minute, darling, thank you."
Harry puts the ladle down and turns. "What do you mean?"
"I think we should call her Molly," Draco said after a moment.
Once they're inside and the door shuts behind them, Draco's breathing eases a bit.
At first, Draco ignored it. He spoke to Harry constantly without being able to hear his own words, unsure of his volume, tone, or sounds. But he spoke, and Harry traced words into his skin for him to interpret, and the burning grew worse and worse.
Clattering footsteps sounded on the other side of the door and Draco leaned back on the pillows and sighed, closing his eyes lightly. Another baby, he suspected. Probably a baby that someone actually wanted.
"Why?"
"Draco," Harry interrupted. He pressed his fingers down into Draco's kneecap. "I'll stay."
Wilson shrugged. “Nonexistent apparently.”
"No, not at all," Draco said. "
"She's not a Potter yet," a voice came from the door, slurred from sleep.
Harry tells them he’s Draco’s partner. They tell him in serious voices that they checked Draco over, and he might have a mild concussion, but he’s going to be okay. Harry nearly faints with relief.
The photos. Well, there was very little that Draco could say about those. He might say that he had recently acquired an interest in photographing civilization. His father wouldn’t be pleased in him trying to pursue a craft other than business and horse breeding, but if he couldn’t put together that all the photographs were of passerby Draco found attractive, then maybe he could play it off. If Lucius did figure that out… Draco would have to come up with something else.
Harry rolled his eyes and grumbled something unintelligible into Draco's neck before standing up straight and unloading their groceries onto the conveyor belt. Draco smiled and rocked gently back and forth with his arms still cradled around Molly in her baby carrier.
Harry groans as Draco pushes him away, all the way off of the bed.
Harry stands up and brushes off the front of his robes. “You most certainly may not, Miss Wimblefon. As much as I am pleased by your interest in the subject, it’s not appropriate nor safe to produce the enchantment even when one
It’s another two hours of watching them clean up Draco’s and the girl’s smashed cars, of talking to the police and watching the ambulances drive away, talking to the girl’s parents when they get there. She starts crying as soon as her mum’s car pulls over to the side of the road. They tow the cars and the police put together insurance papers. Harry talks to everyone, buys water bottles for the girl and Draco from a nearby petrol station, holds Draco close to his side, and tells the girl who won’t let go of her mother that it’s all okay.
"Off getting rich in America and running the entire fashion industry, respectively."
Draco runs the next night, and Harry does not follow him this time. He stays in the little house and hovers over the stove, turns the wooden ladle around the saucer of sweet apple cider, and lets the silence of the night and the distant water drown him.
The paramedic nods. “She’s okay,” she says gently. “There was no one else in the car with her. She’ll be bruised tomorrow, but she’s very lucky. Your partner - Draco -” she gestures to him. “He hit the left side of her car. The air bags on the driver’s side didn’t even go off.”
He did the next best thing.
Draco sighed and patted Harry’s back absently. “You’re so predictable, dear.”
"Sorry?" Harry choked out.
Except that they were nineteen - Draco could not get over this fact - and Draco had no money, and Harry had donated all his money to various organizations after the war because he hadn't imagined he'd ever need to use that much money. Draco had shouted at him when he found out, said he should have saved at least a little, had no one ever taught him anything at all about finances. Harry said no, in a very small voice, no one had ever taught him about finances. So they sat down, had a long talk, and decided that Harry would work so they could buy diapers and food for the baby.
“Did I really?” Draco said. “The curse must have addled my brain. I didn’t mean to write that at all.”
Harry's back rose heavily with his breath, and Draco paused, his hand hovering over Harry's skin. When Harry's breath settled back in again, Draco continued lettering words into Harry's skin. Just one word.
The three of them talked, and occasionally looked to Draco as if expecting him to make some comment or jibe, and then quickly looked away again when they realized he had no idea what they were talking about.
Draco leaned back in his seat and huffed. “Yes, well, I’ve had a fair amount of time to think about it.”
“Professor Potter?”
Draco’s eyebrows tip up at the corners. “Harry,” he says softly. He reaches his hand out, and his fingertips brush over the veins winding over Harry’s knuckles. “Don’t look like that.”
Draco speaks before he can. “Miss Wimblefon. What is my name?”
“Hey, honey,” he whispered into Draco’s shoulder.
Draco laughed aloud and shook his head. “You didn’t do anything.” The truth was that Harry had done something, and that something was existing. The truth was that Draco had realized he might fancy Harry Potter, and he couldn’t handle the notion. The truth was that Draco both wanted Harry to sit as close to him as he could, while simultaneously wishing him to disappear from the face of the planet. He said, “There were other things on my mind. Not your fault.”
Draco swallows hard and shifts his gaze from Harry to the smashed cars sprawled across the intersection. “I was going straight,” he says. “The light turned yellow. A car pulled out to turn, but I couldn’t... I couldn’t stop in time.”
Draco has never been one to hold back what he's thinking, and he continues. "And here I thought you were coming along because you liked me. Because you were giving me a second chance. Because you wanted me." He rubs his eyes with the backs of his hands. His neck and ears are extremely red, but Harry doesn't know if it's from the crying or the sun. "And all you wanted was an excuse."
Last part for this little fic! I hope you all enjoyed!
“Okay,” said Harry, already falling out of the bed. “Okay.”
"I love you," Draco says, in response, moments later.
"No!" Draco screamed. His entire torso seized up in a blinding jolt of pain, and Draco wildly grabbed onto the rails of the wheelchair he was seated in. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to ignore the tears dripping down the sides of his face. "Please. Please. A baby is trying to exit my body."
He wishes so desperately that they weren’t doing this, that they didn’t have to do this. He wishes that he had told Harry yes when he asked him to move in barely a week before the confinement order went out. He wishes he hadn’t been so afraid and so insecure that he’d said no, and he wishes more than anything that Harry had been stubborn enough to stay the night instead of going home the night before everything went to shit, three months ago.
"Pfft." Harry stood and dropped his mug in the sink. "You walking to the Ministry today?"
The tension seeped out of the muscles in Harry's back. He knew how much Draco hated getting information later than everyone else. Harry turned back and slowly lowered himself on the edge of the bed.
"Yes, yes," Draco said. The cashier coughed. Draco reached over and handed her some bills Harry had counted out for him before they left for the market. "Is that what you were thinking?"
Draco politely excused himself from afternoon tea soon after that in order to read his father’s letter privately.
Harry kissed the top of Molly's head, and then the back of Draco's hand. "I love you most in the world," Harry said, still smiling and easy. Draco's stomach clenched and he stared at Harry, rapt and so in love he could die. "I will do anything for you, whatever you ask," Harry said. "If you want Molly to stay with us, she stays, and I am happy because the two of you are the most precious beings in the world to me. If you want her to stay with the Weasleys, then she will, and I am happy because I love being with just you as much as I love being with both her and you."
“I gathered you were avoiding me.” Harry’s face pivoted to Draco’s. “Were you?”
“Draco?”
"Right, of course," Wilson said. He rubbed a hand over his robes. "Is it overstepping to ask what it is?"
"I would," Draco said miserably. "I can't leave you out here alone."
All the flowers I mention in this story have meanings, even if I don't explicitly write them ;)
“Harry,” he gasps when he sees him, and starts coming forward with his hands held out.
Draco waited a long while, breathing in the scent of Harry's cologne, before he said anything else. When he did speak, he spoke slowly, haltingly. "You gave her to me," Draco began, looking down at Molly draped across their laps, her toes in the air and her fingers in her mouth. Harry had a hand over her leg, holding onto her, making sure she didn't roll away from them. Draco smiled, and let Harry's hand, protecting their daughter, give him the courage to continue. "And you gave me you." Harry's shoulder shifted under Draco's head. "And there is nothing I love you for more than that. Having you and having her, it's all I could ever want. It's what I love most."
“It doesn’t gross me out,” Draco says, his eyes still settled on Harry’s face. “I like it. I like being close with someone. I like knowing that every part of me is close to every part of someone else. It’s about intimacy, and feeling good.”
Draco had written a paper on
Draco opened his mouth. His lips split a little and he flicked his tongue out to taste the blood.
, at Draco with wide eyes, and then promptly burst into tears.
“Quite,” said Draco happily.
Harry finally looked up from his feet and let his eyes wander across the names on headstones that they passed. Draco watched out of the corner of his eye as Harry's footsteps stuttered when they passed the statue of James and Lily and baby Harry. Draco did not look at it. He had seen the statue countless times, and he did not like to think about Harry as a tiny, tiny baby with no family. He also did not like to think about how familiar the shape of the trio was wrapped around each other, too similar to the family photos they had up on the mantle in their home. Draco and Harry leaned together with a little baby Scorpius in between them. James and Lily with their arms wrapped around each other and a little baby Harry in between them. It was close, so terrifying. Draco couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose his family, Harry and Scorpius. What it would be like if him and Harry died, and Scorpius was left alone in the world.
Draco laughed wetly before turning around and opening his own sock drawer. “I’m afraid I’m no less predictable than you.”
“Hm?”
"You," Harry said.
Harry nodded and blinked furiously. "Right, of course. I know. I just一four months. How did we not realize something was going wrong inside of you for four months?"
Daisy laughed again before taking another sip of her tea. “Yes, I’m sure.” She set her cup down, and straightened the folds of her trousers neatly. “Daisy mentioned to me that you might have some interest in going out to town.”
Not that it mattered. The Mortem case was still occupying the entire Unspeakable department with no new leads in weeks. Draco was about ready to punt someone's head off their shoulders about it.
Draco smiled a little and reached over the edge of the bassinet to lift her out. No matter how many times he woke to the sound of Molly's desperate crying, no matter how many times he had to pat her back to sleep, or wipe her spit up from his neck, he never got tired of her. Her cries, her thick curls, the cast of her eyelashes over green eyes too big for her face. Draco was addicted, obsessed, in love with her.
Draco stared down at the inscription.
, Draco's mind supplied,
Harry's face went white, and he said nothing more.
“Cleansing,” Draco answered after a long pause. “Lemons are a natural disinfectant, so I suppose it must symbolize being clean.”
“Draco,” Harry greeted.
“Okay,” Harry says. “Okay. I need you to get off the road. Get out of the car. Are you in the car?”
"I'm quite aware," Draco said loudly, sticking his nose up. He sneezed. Harry tried hard not to smile.
“What?” Draco pulled back a little, his arms still tight around Harry’s waist. “What?”
"What does that mean?" Draco asked. He reached his hand out and Harry caught it between his.
So sorry, this was mostly world building and set up. Hope you enjoyed though :)
Draco paused. "I'd rather hear whatever it is from you than from one of the Healers, please."
"That Molly wasn't staying with us tonight," Draco said. He stared down at his hand on Harry's knee. "I just - I haven't been away from her for longer than an hour before," Draco said, trying to keep the anxiety out of his voice. "And that was only once so I could go pick up new bottles for her at the store." Draco swallowed hard. "And she was with you."
"Glad to hear it," Wilson said, and Draco turned to make his way to his desk.
Draco took the envelope and slipped his thumb under the seal. He couldn't think who he'd be getting mail from that would send it through his work address. Nearly all of his correspondents simply sent messages through his personal owl.
“You’ve been saying that for a week,” Harry said.
When the baby was born it hardly seemed like a question who she should be named after.
Draco left his room, checking over the buttons of his new clothes before stepping out into the halls and striding out of the house. He didn’t pay too much attention to where he was going, and his feet carried him to the little cove by the lake that he’d been avoiding.
Draco blinked. “But we already have the whole wedding planned for January.”
Harry lifted his head off the pillow and stared at Draco. “Hogwarts?”
“No one can agree on it,” Draco said. “Some people believe it is longevity, others believe it is love or friendship. Still others think that it revolves around bitterness and disappointment.”
Harry cried harder.
"Your friend? And she's a children's Healer?" Wilson asked. Harry nodded. "Then she was likely sparing your feelings by not sharing the whole Latin phrase. Assuming that death was inevitable, she likely assumed it would be easier for everyone if the illness didn't explicitly say death in its name."
“Yes, my love?” Harry smiles at him. Innocently, very innocently.
Draco turned on his heel and began to walk through the living room, weaving through his papers and photographs. "Fair question. I drank his coffee."
"She's pretty," Harry murmured.
were linked. There’s a countercurse, you daft twit. You are, by far, the best versed on that ridiculous case. I
Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling and holding onto Harry’s hands so tightly he was starting to lose circulation, so he took that as a good sign.
Draco sobs. "Can you leave then?" he says through tears. "Since you don't want to be here anyways. You could go to California instead. Or Georgia. America is big enough for both of us."
Draco sat, his head on Harry's shoulder, in quiet. Letting Harry listen to his words over and over again, in the space between them.
They’re in greenhouse four, so Draco can collect clippings for a potion in his classes the next day. Harry hovers by Draco’s side, not doing anything particularly useful.
Kit waved her hand at him and turned her gaze out to the gardens sprawling out around them. “Daisy does that. Assumes she knows what people want.” She looked to Draco and tapped her fingers on the table to get his attention. “She’s usually right, though.”
"Oh, yes," said Draco.
Harry swallowed hard. A tear slipped out under his eyelashes, slow and catching.
"That's okay."
“What is it?” Draco asks, emerging from the bathroom and leaning against the door frame with his toothbrush stuck out of his mouth. “Jane flirting with you again?”
“I’m going,” he says. “I’m... off the road. I’m off.”
"Anyway," said Draco. "The point is, neither part of the phrase can exist without the other. So when Adam Hornby tagged his smuggling ring
Daisy gave him a pointed look. “Maybe it’s about time you do so.”
Wilson stared at him hard, before shrugging. “Suppose it won’t be too long before it’s true, will it?”
“’M not,” Harry mutters, shaking his head so hard his cheeks wobble.
The apartment is quiet and comforting in the way it always is, better than it always is because Draco’s here tonight, and they don’t usually come to Harry’s because the clicking heater annoys Draco. All the same, it’s nice. It’s being here instead of at Draco’s that gave Harry the strange burst of courage to tell Draco what he hasn’t been saying since they started dating five months ago. Which is that he doesn’t like sex.
Harry stood abruptly, so fast he almost slipped and fell head first out of the tub. Draco grabbed onto his hips to steady him. "That's not fair," Harry said loudly. He was buck naked. "I want to marry you. I'm asking you. If that's what you want, and it's what I want, then we should get married."
“Okay,” Draco says. There’s a long beat before there’s a horrible scraping noise on the other end of the line, and Harry flinches before realizing it’s the sound of Draco sobbing.
The sheets lifted abruptly off Draco's torso. Draco didn't bother scrambling after them. It felt nice, the cool air swiping over his skin. He smiled into his pillow and burrowed further down into the mattress.
"It's going."
Draco nodded.
lost this, and now it was back, and Draco wasn't going to let go of it.
Harry took the bags numbly. "Draco."
They roll.
Harry doesn't respond.
"The Healers say it's
“Right, I think,” he says.
Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he remarked Harry turning his head to stare out over the water in a mimickry of Draco.
"Draco's assigned Healers didn't know what it was," Harry said, his eyes flicking between them. "Hermione figured it out. She works in the children's ward normally, but she was the one that told me it was
“We do have a secretary,” Draco said pointedly as he sat down. His knees ached today.
Harry’s throat goes dry. “You- what?”
"Okay," Draco said, and followed him back, Molly still clutched in his arms.
"It's going to be okay," Harry whispers to him. It is okay. Everyone was safe. Harry keeps telling himself that over and over. Safe, safe. Everyone was safe. Draco is safe.
"How did Bailey's imposter get in so smoothly without anyone noticing anything amiss?"
“Our baby,” Draco mouthed into Harry’s skin.
"Draco." Harry set a hand over Draco's knee and smiled at him, his smile crooked and his eyes honey warmed. "It's alright, really. I'm not going to make you go if you're not feeling well."
When he had come to rest facing Draco, Harry leaned his face close into Draco's on the one pillow. He was so close that Draco could hardly make out the features of his eyelashes, the straight of his nose, full lips. The only thing filling Draco's vision was vivid, golden, brilliant green.
“And what else?” she demands.
He shook his head. He had to think about this like an equation: one part at a time that could be solved with a sharp process.
"Quite a lot." Draco's voice came out soft, more hurt than he intended it to.
"Draco一"
Draco looked down at the top of Molly's head, a tiny pink bow lost in the dark curls. He smiled and pressed his lips to her head and breathed in the sweet powdery scent of her skin and hair.
Draco's door clicked open, and he raised his head without opening his eyes. "Everything alright?"
"Hey," Harry says. "Does a bath sound alright?"
Draco takes his hand, gentle. “Why did we choose this career path anyways?”
Draco smiled. "Sort of. Spent it at home."
Harry’s stomach twists around and drops, and his heart thuds, and the rivers of blood winding over his knuckles are pounding, pounding, pounding.
”So tell me if I’m wrong here,” Draco said, later. His head ached where his eyebrows were furrowed, and his arms had long ago gone numb from directing papers, photographs, and glowing links through the air with his arms.
Harry is silent because, truly, what has made the hurt quieter is Draco. Draco's smile, his skin, his words, and the precious sensation of his hand in Harry's. So Harry holds the pinch close to his heart and says nothing.
Harry holds Draco close to him in the bath, water lapping up around their sternums, and Draco's hair tickling at Harry's nose, and thanks any higher power that might be out there that Draco is safe and alive. "I love you, too, Draco. So much. So, so much."
Kit nodded and shifted her eyes away. Draco got the sense that she wished to continue looking at him, but knew that it made him uncomfortable.
“Well, you signed your name Draco Potter on the card.”
"Sweetheart," Harry whispered again.
Draco thought idly that they were talking about him.
Draco startled and glanced down at the Oxfords Pansy had sent him for his birthday a few weeks ago. They came late, which Pansy apologized endlessly for while simultaneously cursing out the Owl Post.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed. “Sorry the subject was so out of nowhereー”
Harry picks up a piece of bacon. “Almost correct. The enchantment doesn’t die after death. That’s why it’s so complicated. It must be a mutual bonding, and both parties must be truly in love with the other. And the bond doesn’t break after death, which opens up a certain realm of questioning about putting intention behind spells.”
Draco's stomach swooped and Harry grinned, his eyes crinkling up a the corners. "Head over-?"
“Looked like you took quite a tumble there!”
"Tea?" said Harry.
Harry looks at him, all the things that Draco is. Silvered strands of hair glowing orange in the reflected light from the fire, dropping over his cheekbones, tangling around his ears. His eyelashes, too dark for the rest of his face, shadowing over his eyes. The jut of his collarbones through his shirt, the bony knobs of his knees and his elbows. His hands, warm and big and real.
Harry took one long breath, and then the muscles in his back tensed. Draco set his forehead down between Harry's shoulder blades and felt Harry's back twist and tighten as he stretched before relaxing again.
The Healer glanced around the waiting room carefully before turning back to Draco. "Not even your mum or dad?"
"I love you," Draco whispered down to her, smiling. He smoothed down the front of her sleep swaddle, pale green with tiny daisies that Luna had given to them at their engagement party. "Molly Potter."
"Robards went on leave in March," Draco said, waving his hand to draw forth an official work record with the attendance of all employees in the DMLE. "And Bailey stepped in immediately after Robards left."
She bustled in with an armful of parcels concealing her face. “You’ll be glad to hear I got the chance to go in for some new clothes.”
“Right,” Harry says. It’s probably best to get this over with. Maybe if Harry answers all her questions, she’ll leave him alone. “Go on then.”
He holds Draco’s hand as he helps him out of his car and leads him up the stairs to the apartment. Draco keeps flinching and flicking his eyes to the sides like a car is about to come hurtling out of the dark towards him, and Harry tries very hard not to squeeze his hand too tightly.
Harry sighed, and Draco relished in the noise. It still hadn’t quite sunk in to him that this was all his again. Harry’s irritated puffing, the smell of his skin, the feeling of his collar bone under Draco’s ear. It felt new all over, like how it had felt when they first got together ten years ago. Exciting, and confusing, and precious.
Draco rolled his eyes at himself and pushed his body off the ground into a sitting position. He rubbed his hands over his face, and mumbled incoherently to himself. There were few greater fools than he.
“They don't work anymore, I’ve taken too many.” He smiled sadly at that, ashamed of what he had just revealed. “I’ve taken so many that my body got used to them. I tried everything, stronger doses, I combined a couple together, but nothing ever happens anymore.”
“I can, I just don’t see the point if it’s just me. I mean, I’d love to come home and cook for someone, but if it it’s just for me then I don’t care.”
“Nothing to be sorry about, I just want to see you happy and comfortable.” He kissed his forehead and went back to cooking his risotto with mushrooms. “Now please be a dear and slice up my bell peppers. Cut them in half, remove the seeds and the white parts, then slice them.”
“Just because you seem about to pass out, I will close the curtains around the bed and pretend I don’t know you are on the bed with him.”
“I love you, too.” He hugged him and hid his face against his scarf. “Thank you.”
“I will make it short if it happens.”
“Is this the first time you two see each other after the war?”
“Here, let me introduce you two.” He took his hand and brought him to a beautiful eagle owl. Its eyes were a deep orange, and its feathers white, black and grey. It was simply beautiful, even if it looked like an old man with very thick eyebrows. “This is Max.”
“You do the talking then.” He crossed his arms and looked at him expectantly.
“Let’s get out of here.”
They quickly reached ‘Amanuensis Quills’, where Draco spent way too much time deciding between a green quill and a red one, until Harry gave up and bought them both for him, ignoring his protests and shutting him up with a sneaky kiss.
“Don’t be scared, we don’t bite,” George said, smiling at him.
“Yes?” He felt like he did when he played quidditch. Adrenaline pumping through his whole body, his heart beating like crazy, his vision blurry at the edges and only focused on the snitch, but instead this time Draco was all he could see.
“I’m sorry, I just really wanted to come today.”
“I’ll do it for today.” Hermione smiled at him and kissed his cheek when he settled the pensive in the middle of the table. “Alright, let's do it.” She pointed her wand at her head, and immediately a string of silver came out of it. “Who's coming?” she asked, keeping her memories just a bit over the pensive.
Draco's mother opened the door, and before they even had the time to put some space between them, she was already hugging her son. “Draco, love, how are you?” she asked, holding his face and checking him.
They ate as fast as they could without looking desperate or crazy, then they left under the scrutinizing gaze of lots of kids in the hall. Some of them were whisperings, others just watching.
“That would be nice.”
“Oh you know, my job takes up most of my time, and I’m always scared some people might not be into me for the right reasons. I trusted him only because he was a colleague, he knew me and we had always gotten along.”
“Not my subject, sorry.”
They parted, slightly breathless, with Draco's hair all over the place and Harry’s shirt half off his shoulder.
“His life.” Suddenly his mouth was on Draco's neck, and he was screaming so loud that some animals ran away.
“Its not, but I was expecting it to be worse.” If he could appreciate something about him, it was how blunt he had always been. Trust Malfoy to always tell you the truth.
“I will panic if you leave me here and I don’t know how you are doing.”
“That’s exactly why I’m like this, ‘cause I didn’t have it either. I don’t want to leave you wondering how I’m feeling, I will always tell you whatever is going on in my mind.”
“But you were okay with me being in the room?”
“Good to know. Next time I’ll come out naked.” He winked and left him there with his mouth half open and his mind imagining Draco's naked body. The fucker.
“Try not to forget why you did it though.”
“Do you think McGonagall is gonna let us use Dumbledore's pensive?”
He apparated them in a street close to the restaurant but not as trafficked, and they immediately started walking, hand in hand, for the first time without worrying of who could see them.
“They are my family.” He smiled at Draco, happy that he had said yes. “Thank you, it really means a lot.”
“Good night, love” he whispered in his hair.
“Or I could just say sweet nothings in your ear, bet you’d like that even more. Just me talking very close to your face.” He reached out again, and he started caressing the back of his hand with his index finger.
“What did you see?” she asked, her tone very calm and controlled.
“Of course, should I open the connection in your room or Draco's?” she asked, far too smug for someone who supposedly didn’t know the answer.
“Do you want to come with me to the owlery?”
“Is there a chance that what I’m about to say will be used against me?”
“Professor Malfoy, could you please escort our guest out?”
“So Gin is right?” He really didn’t like how smug he looked.
“And you like reading, and teaching. I think you just need a little push. You’ve been sad for so long, you don’t know how to enjoy basic things.”
“We are trying to find a safe path, but since none of us ever went into the forest alone, at night maybe, with absolutely no protection, it’s hard to figure out something.” Subtlety was not one of his many talents.
Malfoy snorted and turned his head, focusing on his plate and on cutting his food with care.
“Stop it.” He could feel his blush spreading down to his neck.
“Yup. My sixth unofficial gift so you can’t chop my dick off.”
“I don't care, I just-I need to be with you.”
“Why is the Ministry not doing anything?” Hermione asked, clearly frustrated.
They were showered and clad in their festive pyjamas – some horrible matching ones with moving reindeers that Draco had bought them. Harry loved them –, sitting on the bed with four gifts between them and Theo cuddled up between Harry’s crossed legs.
“Whatever you want it to. I mean, earlier you were freaking out about the possibility of people thinking we are together, so I’m not really sure what you want from me right now.”
“Yes, who’s going to wear the cloak?” They had realised that leaving the castle together, both wearing a suit, might have looked a bit suspicious.
His hair was slick with sweat, yet somehow still sticking up in places.  He had shrugged off the robe and his shirt was stuck close to his body.  A smudge or two of dirt across Harry’s face gave him a rugged look he didn’t often sport.
“You know what I’m talking about,” Ron said sternly.
“So, it seems you have some insight into my son’s sensibilities after all, Mr. Potter.”
Blaise huffed.  “As if that’s not the whole point of the game.  Of course you’re supposed to have sex.”
“Did not,” protested Ron.
He lead them to a reception area, with another man sitting behind a desk.  There was a wall of compartments to the rear of the room.
Saying nothing in reply, Harry resumed gazing out the window.  He said nothing more than a few words at a time the rest of the trip to King’s Cross Station.
Harry however, leaned forward and licked the sauce off Draco’s lips, nearly knocking him off balance.  The Potions professor gently pushed him back.
She nodded, then turned to Blaise.  “So, you’re still going to Romania?  Even though you’d much rather be a vintner?”
“I wish I was going with you,” Draco pouted.
“Moment of truth,” he said with a small smile and unwrapped himself from around Harry.
“Oh, no, I couldn’t.”
“Harry, I think you did it,” Draco said cautiously.
“Uh, yeah, sure.” Draco placed the tray on his dresser and turned back to face Harry. “On second thought, why don’t we skip the tea.”
“I’d like to be able to say no, but Ron knows I asked you to study and he’ll badger me until I give him at least some details.  But that’s all, honestly.”
“During the day, yes,” Harry said gently. “I’m here to care for them after hours.”
“He’s fine. You can’t get out of bed every time one of them cries.  Look at you, you’re done in.  You need sleep.”
“Neville and I just happened to be coming back from one of the greenhouses.  Professor Sprout said we could take some cuttings with us to start our own herb gardens,” Draco explained. “I’m going to set up a terrarium in our place so I can have fresh herbs for potion making,” he told Harry excitedly.
“Yeah,” Harry said absentmindedly.
It was ironic that when they first arrived, Harry was nervous and unsure, and Draco at ease.  Now their roles were reversed.
“Don’t worry.  The books won’t take priority over them,” assured Harry.  “Nothing is more important than our family.”
Harry nodded.  “That’s smart.  What are you interested in?” He reached out for the bottle once more.  Draco handed it over.
At the moment, however, all of that melted away as he moved in sync with the man he loved.  He could feel, through their joined magic, all the love Draco was feeling.  The emotions were nearly overwhelming, and Harry knew that if he chose, he would never be truly alone again.
“All right.  Why don’t you floo call them tomorrow and see if we can visit.”
“It’s not a fling, Ron,” Harry insisted.  “I love him.”
children.”
“Fuck, that was amazing,” He declared, panting.  Harry lifted his head to find Draco with his head lolled to the side, groaning.
With renewed fervor, Draco stripped the clothing from Harry’s body faster and nudged him backward through the door to Harry’s bed.  Harry fell back, clad in only his violet colored pants. As Draco rid himself of the rest of his own clothes, he admired Harry’s fit form, including the impressive outline of his erection.
“But you called his name when you were making love to me,” she pointed out.
“You haven’t cum?  Why did you stop?” Harry asked.
“Hello,” he smiled pleasantly, as though Rose’s crying wasn’t bothering him in the least.
Once in Charms class, Harry opened the note and read it.  He liked the idea of working on the project with Draco. Not that Ron wasn’t a perfectly fine partner, but the thought of spending long hours with Draco under the guise of schoolwork was brilliant.  Harry frowned when he read the part about Hermione exchanging Ginny for Blaise.  That would take some convincing on his part.  Not to mention, he’d most likely have to tell Ginny why.  He’d been avoiding that.
“Fine by me,” Blaise glowered.  “I don’t want you either.”
“Please, let them in,” Harry told the mediwitch.
Nodding, Harry went on. “I confess that I did as well, until Draco began picking out books about Quidditch or something else of interest to both of us.  Occasionally, he still reads poetry or romantic novels-- or at least he tries.  His voice is so calming, I still fall asleep sometimes.”  He played with the hem of his shirt and lowered his voice. “Or it sounds so erotic, it makes me randy.  Either way, we don’t get much read.”
“Your conviction will not be overturned. You understand that?”  Harry asked.
“I hope it’s not too short notice, considering you’ll be performing the best man duties.  It’s April the tenth.  Molly has been quickly sending out invitations and we’ve secured a Minister.”  She paused.  “What’s wrong?”
“I’m sorry, Mother.  But it’s Valentine’s Day and I want to spend what’s left of the evening with Harry.  The two of you have some celebrating of your own to do,” Draco smirked.
Blinking at first, while his brain processed Harry’s words.  Slowly, he glanced around the room.  Nearly every single pair of eyes was on him.  His face reddened and his mouth gaped open, but no words came out.
“You bet.”  Harry couldn’t wait to get away from the fashion show.
“We would if we stayed ‘til midnight.  Everyone is supposed to be revealed,” he told her.
“All right. I look forward to seeing you here Harry,” Healer Cummins said as he dashed away.
“Draco, let go.  I don’t want to cum before you.”
“I don’t understand what he sees in you.”
“Like I said, who knows how we’ll feel in a few years?  Maybe I’ll be ready by then.”
“Master Draco,” she bowed.  “It is good to be having you home again.”
“Are you not going to also thank me for dressing you?”  Draco quirked an eyebrow.
“Professor McGonagall,” he started.
Draco began to move away to retrieve the lube.
Harry shuddered at the thought of Draco bending over for him and the image that thought conjured in his head.  He let out a small involuntary moan.
“Then I shall have to speak with both of you.  Enchanted to meet you Ms. Tifft.  Glenda, always a pleasure.”  Miranda walked to the floo and disappeared.
He scratched the back of his neck. “I wanted to ask if it was all right with you two if I write about you.”
Harry wandered about the castle for a while, cooling off from his tirade against Hermione and Ron.  Poor Ron didn’t even know what hit him.  He decided to head back to his dormitory on the seventh floor to apologize.
Blaise pursed his lips and snorted.  “You wouldn’t.”
Harry decided he needed to tell him about the dreams.  Either Draco would be upset and try to convince Harry that the dreams don’t mean anything, or Harry would see deceit in his eyes.  He’d be looking for both. And hoping for the best.
bad.”
Draco bit his lip.  “Does it disappoint you that I’m not so certain I ever want children?”
“You just woke me from a wonderful dream,” he said.  “A handsome man was giving me the most wonderful blow job,” he smirked.
“Eh?  Blibbering what?”
“Something must have gone wrong.  Otherwise, Harry wouldn’t have missed giving the signal.”
The pair met along the hallway.
Lucius stood a moment longer with the wand pointed at Harry, then turned away and raised his hands.  He recited an incantation under his breath and closed his eyes.  In a matter of minutes, the Manor was no longer protected.  They would be able to get Draco out, but then anyone would be able to get in.  It didn’t matter much to Lucius anymore.
“You’re welcome,” Harry looked down at the report on his desk.  He’d have to change a few things now.  He decided the report could wait.  “If you’ll excuse me, I have to be at Ron and Hermione’s for supper.”
“I think you’ve grown since I left,”
“I see,” Harry cleared his throat.  “Do you need help getting back?” His wall was firmly back in place, his emotions neatly tucked behind it.
Blaise crossed his arms over his chest. “Well, she came in third.”
The pair shook hands, and Harry went off to find Draco.  They’d been separated far too long. On his way, he ran into Narcissa.
“Well, today is the fourteenth.  How about Saturday in two weeks?  That would be . . . the twenty-eighth?”
“I want that framed,” Draco smirked.
Draco snorted.  At first, he stood his ground, scowling at Knox.  But a nudge from Harry attracted his attention.
“Does it protect against unanticipated . . . excitement?”
“Aw, never mind,” Seamus grumbled.  “Let’s just go to the fuckin’ forest.”
“It doesn’t matter,” he waved it off.  “The point is, I’ve been with a few girls.
“Seven.  You?”
“That was before I knew how bad at it I am,” Harry gave a little chuckle. “I was only a year when my father passed away. He didn’t really have a chance to be a father.  Maybe it’s the Potters, not the Malfoys who are pants at fatherhood.”
Ignoring the guards, Hermione addressed the senior Malfoy. “It’s an urgent matter.  I’d like you to reconsider assisting with the capture of Fenrir Greyback.”
“And none was given.  No one was more qualified when the board approved your hiring.  Mr. Malfoy took it upon himself to take extra measures to insure that he would be taken seriously.”
“And why would you want to do this?”
The other Fourth Year, a girl sat with her eyes glued to the floor as she nibbled a crumpet.  She was blushing furiously.  Euan nudged her.
“Yes, we are.”
Harry looked up. “What?”
Pulling away, Hermione was in disbelief.  “Again with the bloody cake.  This is what I think of your stupid special cake.” She picked up her foot and stomped squarely on the slice of chocolate dessert.
“Does he really think there’s more to it than an accident?”
“If you think it feels soft on your hand, wait ‘til you feel it on your cock.”
“Protego,” Harry followed, in preparation for a return hex, pulling Draco behind him.
“Don’t worry about it.  It was Skeeter’s fault.”
Miranda raised an eyebrow.  “And how would you know?  I understand the two of you have been rivals since childhood.  Frankly, I’m surprised that you are so friendly.”
“Harry?”
“Come say hello to Grandmama first,” Draco called to his seven-year-old son.  It was difficult to deny him with his friends standing right there.
Harry stretched and yawned after a peaceful night’s sleep.  Draco was still dozing next to him, so he carefully got out of bed and pulled on a pair of pajama bottoms and t-shirt.  Stealthily making his way out of the room, Harry stepped into the hallway and realized that he really didn’t know his way around the Manor.
“It’s not a big deal.  Just something I thought you could use.  Open it.” Draco made himself comfortable as he watched Harry.  Leaning on one elbow, he lay on his side and stretched out his legs.
Draco nodded.  “Go on.  I’m not angry with you, Pans.”
“It’s all right.  I know I’m fat.  I hear what people say.”
Immediately, the frown disappeared and was replaced by wide eyes and a gaping mouth.  Harry was lying, not on the usual small pad he conjured, but a bed covered in green satin sheets.  There were candles everywhere, and a basket with a bottle of something on the floor.  Harry was already nude.
“Ron--”
“Congratulations,” Harry offered. “I hope you’ll be happy there,” he said sincerely.
“Why don’t you ever use it?” Blaise wanted to know.
Walking into the kitchen to hugs and toasts, Harry feigned ignorance. “What’s going on?”
“I wish I could wear a mask all the time,” he confessed.
“Keep fucking, keep fucking,” Harry urged. Draco would not stay hard much longer.
“You really have changed a lot.”  Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco’s, deciding he was right.
“Sorry.  I was trying to get you to say something.  The first time you said you liked
“Yes sir,” Michael answered. “May I be excused for a moment?  I need to use the toilet.”
“It’s Harry, please.  And it doesn’t matter to me.”
“There’s nothing wrong with that, Neville,” Harry assured him.  “I’m sure most of the students here haven’t.  Are you sorry it was with Pansy though?  I mean, wouldn’t you rather it be with someone you love?”
“I came to see if you were all right.  I didn’t see you at any meals, or in the hallways.”
“Please, a small token of my appreciation. Lunch here isn’t quite a proper thank you. But it’s the least I can do for now.”
“Just give it some thought,” Harper begged her.  “You won’t be disappointed,” he called as Blaise dragged him out.
“Because you said
“I’ll bet most of those men didn’t even know Draco,” Harry added.
“He was nice enough I guess,” the blond shrugged.  “There was no chemistry. No . . . passion.  We could barely carry on a conversation.”
Blushing just a bit, Harry admitted, “I need a blue rose as well.”
“Oh,” Harry said, slightly self-conscious. “Of course.”
Finally, Harry whispered, “Perhaps another time, then.”
Harry laughed. “Oh, I almost forgot.”  He knelt down on one knee.  “This is definitely for real, Draco. You have to say yes to get the ring, though.  So, will you marry me?”
“Is that any way to greet me?” Pansy smiled.  “Didn’t you miss me after you left the Manor?”
“Okay,” Harry said, stroking Draco’s silky hair. “But you never did tell me your favorite colour.”
“Bloody hell.  I may not last any longer than you.”
Harry shifted from side to side, pressing his back into Draco’s front.
“It’s not a phase, Mother,” Draco broke in.
“Draco?” Lucius had knelt by his son, trying to revive him.
Harry had no idea Ron had noticed him kissing Draco, but he was pleased to find out that even his best friend didn’t know it was him.
Draco’s face paled a bit.  “What did you do?” he asked Cornfoot slowly and deliberately. He took his wand out.
Hermione’s brow furrowed.
“No, thanks anyway,” Harry smiled.
“If you tell him, it may put ideas in his head.  The mind is a powerful thing.  He may convince himself that it was the spells all along, whether or not it’s true.”
Frowning, Draco looked at the wand again. “Well, that’s not very flattering.”
“I think we’d better be going,” Harry said.  “Come on, Draco.”
Harry walked into his room and glanced around.  Though it was mid-week, he was hoping to find Draco there.  He was finding it more and more lonesome during the week when his lover wasn’t with him.  The pair had even taken to staying in one another’s quarter on weekends they had duty.  Not that Harry had been trying to actively go against McGonagall’s rules.  He simply found that he was much less distracted with Draco by his side than he was thinking about the man when he wasn’t.
“How do you know Potter didn’t just forget?” Lucius interjected.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw someone stand up. It was a Ravenclaw boy named Stewart, a few years behind Harry.
“Your father told you about him possibly testifying in exchange for early release, yeah?”
hdhdhd
“You had just turned four.  And I did read to you, nearly every night.  But I suppose you were too young to remember it.  I was pregnant.  Very pregnant.  I was having difficulty sleeping at night and was exhausted during the day.  My healer prescribed a potion.”  She paused.  “The apothecary had made a mistake in brewing it. I, along with several others, became ill from the poisoned potion.  I lost the baby.”
“We don’t
“Of course.  It’s a modified Evanesco.  You don’t think I would let someone with a blade near my knob, do you?”
It had taken Draco years to accept that perhaps he was good enough for Harry Potter.  Harry wondered how long it would take for him to realize he was good enough to raise their children.
“What’s his problem?” Ron asked.
He must have stood in front of Draco’s door for a full five minutes before gathering up the nerve to knock.  When he did, the sight that greeted him was not at all what he was expecting.
“I suppose we could.”
Grinning, Draco played coy.  “I may need a lot of convincing.”
“Promises made that you probably wouldn’t understand. And even if I explained them all, what would it change?  I did my time in Azkaban. But I still don’t have my daughter and you still hate me.  That is a prison from which I will never escape.”
Harry smiled.  “Are you all right?”
A server walked by, then realizing he’d bypassed the hosts, turned around and offered a bite from the tray.
Harry bent down to retrieve his trousers, unceremoniously shoved his now deflating cock inside and zipped up.
“What sort of business?”
Most of the day had been spent dividing Snape’s belongings and rearranging the things Draco decided to keep.  He offered Harry a few trinkets as keepsakes and put the rest in a small box for McGonagall to donate. Before too long, most of the office had been restored to functional, if not comfortable.
Hermione continued to grumble while the class began.  She had almost forgot that she meant to observe Harry and Draco during class.  She noticed that when Draco went to retrieve ingredients, he gently placed a hand on Harry’s back as he walked by.  To the casual eye, it merely looked like Draco was trying to fit between Harry and the table behind him.  But when the hand lingered for a moment, Hermione made note.
“What are you doing here, Ron?” Harry appeared next to him.  “I thought you two decided not to come.”
They both downed their drinks.  Draco made his opening move and waited for Harry to either move a piece or answer his question.
Harry responded in kind, pressing his body into Draco’s.  They slowly made their way into the bedroom, where Harry pushed him onto the bed.  Dressed only in their pants, it was clear that both were more than ready to make love.
“I told you I wasn’t angry, just disappointed.”
“Really,” Harry affirmed.  “I think there’s more to tell after all.”
“No, of course not.  We haven’t slept in two weeks.” Ron tugged at his hair.  “She cries all the bloody time. The doctor said it’s something called colic.”
Finch-Fletchley grew more anxious that he would revert back to his usual insecure, unconfident self once he was revealed and made a quick decision.  Without warning, he kissed the girl.  She broke the kiss quickly and looked at him in shock.
“I am Hermione.  I know, it doesn’t make sense.  A year ago, if you would have asked me, I would have said that I planned to get back together with Ginny and marry her someday.  I thought that would make me happy.”
Draco hesitated, but Harry turned his over.
“Yes, it is,” Ginny smirked.  “And we’re going to kick your arse Friday on the potion contest.  You should have stuck with Blaise.  Harry’s not very good at potions.”
“No, professor, I didn’t.”  She looked up at Draco with a sort of sadness.  Tucking a strand of her golden locks behind her ear, she regarded him with deep, forest green eyes that rivaled Harry’s for beauty. And yet, they were still not her most striking feature.  Her perfect peaches and cream complexion competed with the soft, pink pouty lips beneath her delicately upturned nose.  She was one of the most beautiful girls Draco had seen.  At fifteen, she hadn’t even come close to reaching her full potential.
“So, what did you do after I left last night?” Draco asked subtly.
“Twenty-five Galleons for a used bracelet?” Ron questioned.  It was a lot of money to spend on one gift. Even if it was for his girl.  He turned to Harry.  “Do you think Hermione will
Draco shrugged.  “I’m not unhappy,” he answered cryptically.
“You’re full of yourself,” Draco teased.
“I’m ready,” Harry groaned.
“But Harry, the lab is going to think it’s your sample.  What if there’s something wrong with mine?”
Raising his eyebrows, Harry smirked.  “He did?” He sat down across from the others and picked up a piece of fruit.
“Pft. Drilling potions,” muttered Draco.
are.”
“She doesn’t cry every minute of the day, Ron,” Hermione said, bringing another tray with milk, sugar and almond biscuits into the room.
“Come on.  You have to dance.  That’s the whole point.”  Draco continued to cavort around Harry, tugging on Harry’s hand to encourage him to join in.
“Really?  What do you write?” Draco’s interest was piqued.
Draco continued lavishing attention while Harry grew closer to his own climax. Harry kept Draco on the edge with an occasional lick or suck.
Harry shook his head.  “If I have to choose between Draco and children, I choose Draco.  I know I’m happy with him.  I can’t say for certain I’d be happy as a parent.”
“It took some time to convince him it was in his best interest to cooperate.”
“Mm.  This does smell good,” Harry said, scooping up a handful of bubbles.
“Again, why should I care?” he asked smugly.
“I wanted to.  Really. I was afraid to talk to you all week though, because of my punishment from the game,” he explained.  “It was rather embarrassing,” Michael blushed.  “You have
For a brief moment, Harry imagined this same scenario, but with their own child. His heart suddenly ached for something he was never sure he wanted in the first place. The moment was ruined when Victoire ran into the room screaming about wanting more cream on her pie. Fleur followed closely behind, scolding her.
“Right,” Harry muttered.  “Um, how is the Potions office coming along?” he asked, changing the subject.
“Are you certain?”
“Or at least lust.”  Neville blushed.
“It is.  Harry, this
“When you say deadly, do you mean for the person brewing the potion or the person drinking it?”
“What do you mean?”
“Oops,” Draco said unashamedly.  “I’ll help you cover it up.  Later.  I want you to open my present now.”
“You should probably go back to your room now, before somebody sees you,” Draco said softly.
“A bit?” Ron raised an eyebrow.
Feeling dejected and more than a little sorry for himself, Draco opened his paltry liquor cabinet and took out a bottle of Sherry.  He reached for a glass.
“Oh.  I see.” He lowered his mask and pulled his beard back up over his mouth.  “Sorry to have bothered you.” He frowned and turned to leave.
“Like what?” Ron queried.
Draco shuddered.  “You want to fuck me?”
“And once you leave Hogwarts, it’ll only get more difficult to renew your relationship.  What if he meets someone else?” Pansy asked.
“Draco,” Harry sighed.  He was mesmerized.  He’d never seen another man cum.
“You did that on purpose.”
“And you’re being a tease.”
“I was at my wit’s end. Nothing I did worked.”
“Of course,” Draco strode to him.  “We’ll take it.” He took the parchment and quill and walked to the desk.
“Magic has a frequency, like sound waves or light waves.  And each wizard has a relatively unique one. Not nearly as unique as fingerprints, mind you.  But as long as Harry and, um,” Cummins paused.
“I won’t be there.  I’m not allowed to bring Rose to that part of the hospital.  But the rest of Ron’s family is there,” Hermione told him.
“A novel, eh?  Got tired of reading about Quidditch matches and history?” Draco asked.
“Me?” Harry frowned.
Ten minutes later, Lucius arrived, escorted by two more guards with wands trained on him.  He was dressed in embarrassingly drab grey prison attire.  When he saw Hermione, he sneered.
“But those books are only about what I did, not who I am.”
to do that?”
Hermione giggled and covered her mouth. “I’ll try to get books on Quidditch,” she said. “But I might try the poetry, too.” She nudged Harry.
“What about you?”
“There’s no glamour strong enough to cover up two people having . . . um,” Draco glanced around to see if anyone was paying attention, then lowered his voice further. “In a compromising position.”
“Uh, right, sorry.” He tried not to sound like he was panting.
“No, I do.”
Draco grinned. “It’s not your turn to ask a question.  I can ask you another, so you can ask that one, if you’d like.”
As luck would have it, Draco happened to be walking by at the time.  He snapped his head in Hermione’s direction.
The boys broke apart, Harper scrambling to get away from Draco.  Draco merely remained as he was, he had done nothing wrong.
“Oh,” Pansy started when Harry appeared in the passageway.
The more Draco thought about it, the more worried he became.  He had to get Harry back to the safety of Hogwarts.
“That’s odd,” Harry commented, not thinking it was odd at all, given the circumstances.  “When was that?”
“Forget it. You already think I’m ridiculous.”
“Then I’ll have them come here.  We can have the house elves make us supper.  Or they can bring take away.  Please say yes.”
“Fine, yes I saw her.  But that doesn’t mean she’s the children’s mother.”  Harry stuck his tongue out at the book.
“Rose is a baby.  How can you be in love-” Harry paused, trying to grasp what Draco was saying.
“I hope the same goes for Draco,” Harry said mindlessly.  Then realizing he’d said it out loud, blushed.
“Really?” Ron’s eyebrows raised and his nose wrinkled up. He laughed.
“Thank you.” His voice trembled.  He moved to the bed and rested his head briefly on her shoulder.
The banging of a bed frame against the wall became louder. And now, right outside the Seventh and Eighth Year room, grunts and moans could be clearly distinguished.
Harry looked at Leo snuggled in Dean’s arms.  “I suppose I wouldn’t be upset if it happened sooner rather than later.  It’s not as if I’m going to go looking for it though.”
“Oh, Draco,” he whispered, kissing the blond’s neck and nuzzling his hair. He pumped his hips with more vigors and reached around to grasp Draco’s erection.
“He’s fascinating, isn’t he?  I can’t imagine how long it took him to identify thirty-one different types of magical ferns,” she said excitedly.
Ron glanced about and rose to his feet.
“I didn’t waste it,” Harry protested.
“That’s all in the past.  And hopefully, the two of you can put your past behind you as well.”
“Malfoy has a visitor.”  The guard looked Hermione up and down.  “Some young thing says she’s got some personal business with him.”
“No, not at all,” Draco said.  “In fact, I’ve never felt better since it happened.”
“As some of you may have known, Professor Flitwick had intended to retire at the end of this term.”
“May I have your wand, Lucius?” the Interrogator asked.
“We’re celebrating,” Harry told him.  “Come, sit down.”
“You’re beautiful, Gin.  Really, you are.”  Harry averted his gaze from Ginny’s.
Harry smiled unconvincingly.
“I thought you were tired of wanking alone?”  Harry pointed out.
“Did they say how much longer?” Ron asked.
“I am being civil,” Harry told her.  “Believe me, that answer is toned down.” He addressed Duchess.  “Write it down.”
In the new position, Draco’s cock sat deeper into Harry and the Gryffindor enjoyed having more control.  He leaned back a bit.  Partly to see more of Draco, partly to get Draco’s cock to rub against his insides just the way he liked.  In time, Harry would teach Draco precisely what would bring him the most pleasure.  But for their first time together, Harry took it upon himself to hit that sweet spot.
“As exemplary as you have conducted yourself this evening, it was difficult for me not to observe the way your attention has been split.”
“Then you need to put her in the mood.  Light a few candles, put silky sheets on the bed, maybe a few toys . . .”
“Instinct,” Draco said dryly.
“Harry,” Ginny called after him. She caught up with him on the lawn. “Harry,” she said sympathetically.
Harry reached out to hold Draco’s hand.  It was trembling.
Ron let out a sigh of relief.
“I have to talk to Draco,” he said to himself.
“Um, Granger, I wanted to ask . . . have you chosen a writing partner for the History essay yet?”
“Yes, can’t you feel it,” Draco leered. “If you’re hesitating because of my injuries, I assure you–”
“No,” he paused.  “It’s for you.”
Draco raised an eyebrow.  “Really?  You never told me about that.  Hmm.  At least that was a good one that came true.”
“No,” she answered.  “I am part Veela.  Our magic isn’t completely compatible that way.”
Draco put down his fork.  “Do you really have to ask?” he said in a hushed voice. “Or did you forget already?”
“I beg your pardon?”  He gave her a stern look, causing her eyes to go wide, and Draco thought perhaps she was rethinking her request.
“Are you ready Harry?” Hermione asked, walking up to him and straightening his bow tie.
“Humdingers.  Haven’t you heard of them?” Luna questioned.  “Come on,” she said, taking Seamus’ hand.  “I told you we would have fun tonight.”
“Nothing.”
“Well, I was hoping we could babysit her together.”
He closed the manuscript. “But it’s only my suggestion.  Maybe it’s a little selfish on my part,” Draco said. “I would like to know more details about your exploits.  I have a feeling they could fill several books.”
“That, or he just wouldn’t be able to keep his hands off you,” Harry chuckled.
“Read,” she said, opening the book.
“You give me too much credit,” Harry said.  “Any changes you see in Draco, he made himself, before we met back up at Hogwarts.”
Narcissa smiled.  “That’s good to know.  But what I was really getting at was how the wizarding world is going to view the pair of you.  So far, knowledge of your relationship has largely been second-hand information in the Prophet written by Rita Skeeter.”
“Oh, hi,” Harry said with a small smile.
“And you think you’re ready to raise a baby?”
Harry’s heart sank. Through his Auror training, he knew that Draco was going into shock. There wasn’t very much Harry could do beyond basic first aid. “I’ll be right back.”
Draco shifted his weight slightly and began to stroke Harry with his free hand.  The constant moans coming from his partner were too much to bear, and Draco slid from his knees to his belly, trapping his own erection between his body and the satin sheets. He ground himself against the bed with the same rhythm he used on Harry’s cock.
She nodded, easily reeled in. “Yes. The Healer on duty thought he was dead when he first came in. It was a miracle that he survived. And you saved him, huh?”
hdhdhd
Nudging him in the side hard, Hermione responded, “I did not keep bugging you. I asked once or twice perhaps,” she blushed.
“Are you bloody blind?”
He gave her a hug. “I’d ask how you’re doing, but Ron’s already filled me in.”
As they made their way to the head table, students stared up at them.  Draco finally saw the newspapers and grabbed one off the Ravenclaw table.
“And you believed him.” Harry’s heart nearly broke at the hurt in Draco’s voice.  “Not that I should have to explain myself, but . . . I did hug the boy.  It was only because he was crying over a girl-- his former Potions partner.  Turns out, he got tongue-tied and nervous around her.  That’s why he was screwing up all the time.  And why he could make the potions when he was working with only me.  I know a thing or two about deep, unrequited crushes, so I was sympathetic to him.  I can’t believe you really thought I was carrying on behind your back with an underage boy.”
“Casper?  You want to tell me what’s going on?”
“Are you sure he’s all right?” Harry asked anxiously.
“And he didn’t go completely unpunished.  He lost a significant amount of points for his House.  And, I suspect, the respect of more than a few fellow students.” The professor smiled softly.  “Draco, there will always be people in this world, or the muggle world, who will persecute and harass those they don’t like or understand.  And it’s difficult not to want to fight back.  But you must rise above hurtful words.  If you give in, and become violent, you’re no better than those who persecute you.”
He walked back to his quarters a little less optimistic than Harry but looking forward to proving to his mother that Harry was right for him.  Though more open-minded about his sexual orientation than his father, his mother had been skeptical that a relationship with Harry Potter would work out.  Still, Harry was willing to give Narcissa the benefit of the doubt and reach out to her.  Draco sighed.  It didn’t matter if his mother didn’t accept his relationship with Harry.  Nothing could keep him from falling even more in love with the man.
“I was wrong.  I was wrong to make generalizations about Voldemort’s followers, the way purebloods are wrong about muggle borns.  I understand now, the fear and manipulation Tom Riddle used to control people.  And I’ve matured enough to recognize that a person’s character should be judged by his own actions, and not by those around him.”
Harry was touched.  Most people were supportive of his decision to become an Auror.  It was almost a certainty, given who he was.  But deep within himself, he wasn’t sure of his motives.  Draco had questioned them the night they first met in the Astronomy Tower.  There were many decisions and paths Harry was taking because he thought he was supposed to.  Draco had caused him to question them all.
“Professor Malfoy,” Harry returned.  “Are you here for lunch?”
Harry rolled his eyes, without letting Draco see, of course.
“There’s nothing to tell,” Harry said.
Unsure how to respond, Harry proceeded to show Draco around the room.
Harry opened his mouth to make a snide retort of some sort.  Instead, he simply said, “Thanks.”
Molly was the first to throw her arms around her son.
He removed her hand and pushed her legs apart, her knees up.  As he leaned forward to kiss her, he positioned the head of his penis at her entrance.  She was more than ready for him. He felt a small bit of resistance as he pushed his way in.  Her cries were muffled by his mouth over hers.  He continued to press on, even as her cries became louder.
“You two can go. I’ve already seen all these things,” Harry answered.
“Thanks.” He wriggled in his arms just to get settled, no other hidden intention.
“You know where I work, right?”
“I’m fine, thank you.”
And then in a couple of seconds it was over. Voldemort just pointed his wand at him and shouted an Avada Kedavra.
“I most certainly did not.”
“Okay then. You go, coffee on me.”
“White eyes. It was like... they looked empty, just white.” He held the branch of a tree up and let Malfoy through. “Be careful with this pl-" he didn’t manage to finish his phrase that the plant in question exploded in front of them. “Shit. Take off your shirt.” He started stripping, and was pleased to notice that Malfoy was doing the same. He really didn’t want to argue in that moment.
“Is it because of the guy you have a crush on?”
“I’m messed up.”
“I literally just told you. I believe the things I said.”
“You look like a barbarian.”
He decided to wander around the castle for a bit before going to his room, something he had never really done before after curfew without fearing for his life in case Snape had found him.
“Do you need anything?” she asked, gently.
“What wedding?” Was Draco still dreaming?
“Fuck you, Potter.” He elbowed him, not hard enough to hurt.
“Looks like it,” he panted, and he reached down to stop Draco’s hand, feeling way too overstimulated. “Shower and breakfast?” he proposed.
“Would anyone like coffee?” Narcissa asked, interrupting them when it looked like her husband was going to explode.
All three boys nodded, looking rather ashamed.
“Obviously I’m not, I eat canned tuna four times a week.”
“I know, but I was so scared. I need to be close to you now. Is it alright?” he asked, already laying down to be more comfortable.
“I don’t use that apartment a lot, it's more symbolic really,” Draco said.
“I already told you why. You are a loving and nice human being, who is patient and lovely to his students, who got a cat just to help me overcome my stupid fears, who came in the forest even though you were scared just to make sure I wasn’t going to get myself killed. You are a good person, Draco, and you deserve love. Mine, Theodore's, whoever you want. And if you don’t want to believe me, I will just try my best every day to make you feel loved, sounds good? Are you ready for some of the sappiest letters ever written?”
“I like him, I’ll get him.”
“Hello,” he said, politely, “I’m really sorry for intruding today, I’m here for work.”
“I hate this," he whispered, and he was pleased to notice that Malfoy was fighting back a smile. Maybe it was going to work. After all, they weren’t that different. The things they had done during the war, they both had done them to protect their loved ones. He knew Malfoy wasn't the same person anymore, he was just raised with the wrong ideas. He, of all people, knew something about being raised in a household with questionable ideas.
“Very well. I would like it if you didn’t give my teachers a mental breakdown, though.”
“Well you slept with him, you two have a history, I really doubt he’s gonna be my favourite.” He was getting nervous, he could feel his hands shaking a bit and he was now gesticulating wildly with his free hand. He really didn’t want to talk about their ex partners on their first date.
They left the shop with a lot less money and a crying kitten.
“Even if it's Malfoy?”
“Boyfriend it is then.”
They took the man and brought him outside to apparate with him.
“You too.” They awkwardly shook hands, and Harry had to really fight his huge grin at that. Seeing his boyfriend and his best friends in the same room was making him so happy and giddy. Even if they were never going to get along, it was so important to him that they were trying, for him.
Ron opened the door to his dormitory and placed his small trunk at the foot of his bed.  When he turned around, he was greeted by the sight of Harry in bed sleeping, one arm propped up under his head.  The other was resting on a sleeping blond wrapped around him.
“I want to see you.  I don’t want you behind for the first time,” Draco told Harry.
“Like, clothes or something.”
Harry hit Ron on the back of his head.  “Shh, she’ll hear you.”
He held the key out.  Draco stepped forward and reached for it, their fingers touching briefly.  Harry noted that Draco’s hands were soft, for a man.
“I didn’t mean it like that.  I have a hard time understanding why you don’t believe me when I say I love you, and only you.”
“Do you drink every weekend?” Harry asked.  “Is it a problem?”
It wasn’t the ‘no’ Hermione was expecting.  She cleared her throat.  This was uncharted territory for her.  And although she had an open mind, she wasn’t sure what to say to her friend. His answer left room for the possibility that he was attracted to men, or at least one in particular.
“Then why would you risk everything you’ve worked for?”
Sighing heavily, Draco gave in.  “All right.”  He plucked a small box wrapped in elegant gold paper with a red ribbon from Harry’s pile and handed it to him.
“I haven’t given it up.  Merely put it on hold.”
“The weekend after, then,” Harry suggested.
“Thanks Mione.”  Harry hugged her tightly. Knowing that Ron would follow her lead, he was grateful for her favorable reception.
Hermione glanced around the Hall, noticing that it was more sparsely populated than usual that morning.
“I hope Rose didn’t give you too much trouble.”
“I know it may be difficult at first,” McGonagall interrupted Harry’s thoughts.  “But I hope you’ll give him a chance.”
“As long as they agree with you,” Harry smiled.  He knew he was getting under Draco’s skin. It was fun.
Tentatively, Harry mimicked Draco’s earlier actions.  All up until he reached Draco’s arse.
“Are you sure?” he asked his love.  “This is what you want too, isn’t it?”
“I shouldn’t have told you any of that.  I was only venting my frustrations.”
A waitress came by to seat them at a table, breaking the melancholy mood they had fallen into.  She led them to a corner booth with a candle on it.  Harry thought it would have been very romantic if it had been a date.  And if there weren’t a bunch of rowdy drunk wizards singing loudly in another corner.
Draco stood listening to Blaise go on.  He’d never considered any of the things Blaise said.  Draco saw their differences--the rich boy with the prominent, pure blood family, versus the seemingly poor orphan who didn’t even learn about magic until he was called to Hogwarts.  Opposites in many ways.  He’d always thought of them as enemies, opponents, rivals.  Famous, and infamous. Truthfully, Draco never realized Blaise had that much insight into his own life.  He supposed that was why his friend had stuck by him after the war, when so many others looked down upon him.
Harry opened the door and let Draco inside.
“Actually, Blaise wants to work with you.”
“Did he say why?” Draco asked.
“I didn’t mean to say that,” Draco admitted.  “I got caught up . . .”
“Miss what?”
“I should have realized it was just a game,” Parvati explained.  “But Michael and I got each other’s wands twice.  I thought that meant something more than it did, I guess.”
“Please.  Keep going.  I’ll be fine.  This is what I want,” she assured him.  “You promised to make me feel good.”
“I think I would do anything to save you, too.”
He downed his glass and headed for the front door. The wards around the house were still strong, and he had to step outside to disapparate. First, he went to Harry’s favorite cafe in Diagon Alley to pick up a late supper, then made a quick stop at Hogsmeade to get chocolate roses from Honeydukes.  Finally, he went to the Three Broomsticks for butterbeer. Armed with the goodies, he used the floo to travel to Ron and Hermione’s flat.
Draco tenderly attended every inch of Harry’s body until neither could stand the teasing no more. He bent Harry low and moved them forward so Harry could brace his hands against the wall. Taking Harry in quick, hard thrusts, Draco progressed toward his climax swiftly.
“How do you mean?” Draco questioned.
They stopped in front of a door.
“I’ll need something bigger.” Draco picked up a blanket and tried his best to blot up the spit up.
“What?” Draco looked hurt and confused.  “But I was sure . . .”  He gave Blaise a sideways glance.  He did not want to say too much in front of him.  Draco pushed his plate away and stood.  “You’re such a slag!” he yelled at her and stormed out of the hall.
“Don’t worry,” Stephen answered.  “I won’t come anywhere near you from now on.”  Mandy began to follow him into the Great Hall.
“Nothing has,” Ron told him.  “At least not from where I’m standing.  And frankly, Harry, I’ve sort of suspected it for a while.”
The school year got off to a busy start and November seemed to arrive quickly.  The new Charms professor was a woman who taught at Beauxbatons for twenty-six years before moving to Hogwarts for a change of pace. Draco had remembered her from his days of student teaching, but didn’t know her well.  Harry was just thankful that the new professor was a woman, with no designs on either of them.
“I did professor.  That’s why I snuck out.”
“I don’t think so,” Draco said smugly.
“Oh,” Draco said quietly.  They walked the rest of the way up the stairs in silence.  Now that he had calmed down a bit, he was able to fully appreciate the state Harry was in.
“Nothing that bad. He just said you must have gotten overly excited about the win.  I wonder what he’ll say when he hears about us.”
“Fuckin’ hell, don’t do that again,” Anthony scolded.  “Let’s go to the kitchens and see if we can get something to eat.  We got nothin’ better to do.”
“Yes, I understand that,” Lucius replied.
“Huh?” Harry was pulled from his musings.
“I thought you were going to try and make me cum without touching.”
In a matter of seconds, the moment was gone.  But Blaise had gotten the message.  Draco cleared his throat.
Harry followed suit, but only shook Lucius’ hand, whereas Draco hugged him. The two flooed back to their quarters.
Harry grinned, “But I really am excited about starting our life.”
Reluctantly, Harry returned to his earlier task. It felt like he had sifted through the wreckage for hours, making little headway. Intending to take just a short break, Harry checked on the sleeping blond. He was shivering.
Sensing that Harry was inwardly rolling his eyes at him, Draco was regretting visiting Harry.  He wasn’t looking for a chiding.
baby?”
“Yes.” He was puzzled by her statement.
She dragged him into the sitting room.
“I’m not going to sit around while you manipulate Harry into saying---”
George arrived, with tea in hand for Molly and Arthur.
“Yes,” he agreed. “Another time, though.  I need to get back to Harry.”
“What are you doing?” Harry’s hand on his wrist stopped Draco from going past the waistband.
“Lumos,” Harry said, holding out his wand. The room was dimly lit, but bright enough for Draco to find some candles to light.
hdhdhd
“I’m sorry,” Harry said to Draco.
“McGonagall said the best revenge was living well.  Or something along those lines.”
“I still don’t trust him.  He can’t have turned off his feelings for you that quickly.”
They sat in silence contemplating the days following the Battle of Hogwarts.  The server brought their soup and asked if they needed refills on butter beer.  They declined and switched to lemonade.
“Um, thanks.  You’re new here?”
“You’ve been awfully quiet,” Hermione observed.  “It might help to talk.” She placed a glass of water on his desk and slid it toward him.
“Don’t lose your nerve now, Potter.  I know there’s more you want to know.”
“Mione?”  Harry’s voice pulled Hermione out of her woolgathering.  “Are you sure you’re all right with this?”
“So am I.” Draco sighed. “I don’t know exactly where this will end up. Nobody ever does. Do they? But I’ve never felt this way before. No one else has ever made me literally feel weak in the knees.” He paled a shade.
Ron laughed heartily at that.  “I reckon that must be strange for you.”  His smile faded.  “But, seriously, I have to admit, this thing between you and Harry seems to be working.  And you did try to save my life.  I guess you’re not so bad after all.”
“That was reserved,” Harry commented.
The word
“Why?” Harry asked.
“All right,” Harry said gently. “We don’t have to talk about it. You’re right, it’s much too soon to even think about.  We need time to be together.  Just you and me.”
“Hello!” he shouted louder.
Ron grinned.  “Well, the other blokes are going to the party.”
“Harry, it’s none of your business,” Ginny defended her man.
“Thank you.”
“Never again,” Harry replied.  Draco settled down on top of Harry and rested his chin on Harry’s chest.  Harry wrapped his arms around his lover and clasped his hands, keeping him in place.
Between the substitute professor’s thinly veiled attempts to get in Harry’s good books, and the other professors tittering about his relationship with Draco, Harry’s mood was falling.  He couldn’t wait for his lover to return.
“But, Master Harry will do,” Draco said.  “You’re dismissed Clara.”
Harry yanked on Draco’s cock and within seconds, he was covered in a viscous white mess.  Draco stilled his hips and sighed heavily. “Oh, yeah,” he breathed. “Are you close?”
“Uh . . .” Draco just realized what he’d said.  “Harry, I . . . okay, yes, I let you win.  But only because I didn’t want you to feel bad.”
“Still,” Ron sulked.  “You could have told me.”
Ron and Hermione remained glued to one another’s side, visiting with their former professors, as well as Charlie and Percy, who’d both been out of the country for the past year.
Slowly, Draco crawled onto the bed.  He ran a hand up Harry’s right leg and cupped his arse.
“Me too,” Harry whispered back.  “We’ll work on that record another time.”
Whistling a happy tune, with a goofy look on his face, Harry strolled into the Gryffindor common room.  A few students sniggered, but he paid them no mind.  Nothing was going to bring him down.  Not this day.
“What can I do for you?”
“Because I’m going to re-edit.  And then you’re going to do some research on muggle agencies and write a new query letter. And, you’re going to use your real name.”
“Forgive me,” he said quietly.
The pair stood silently, straining to listen.  Faint moans came from the pitchblack section of the castle. Harry turned to look at Draco but could only see his dim outline from the scant light of the window nearby.
Ron sat up straighter and gave Harry a scowl.  “Do you think I’d be so fucking miserable if I didn’t?  I could go out and get Lav right now if I didn’t want Hermione back.  I’d go to that party tomorrow night if I didn’t want her back.  I mean, sure, the prospect of fooling around with someone new is exciting.  Don’t get me wrong.  Who
“Not at all,” he lied.  “Actually . . . I have a confession to make.”
Harry swallowed. “Draco? Are you still with me?”
They each ordered a proper beer and a starter of fried cheese.
Draco sniggered.  “Public drama, I can handle.  Or have you forgotten all about my family’s trials?”
Harry complied and continued to pump.  He rose to his knees for better leverage, holding Draco’s legs in place.
Dean and Ginny snacked while they sat on her bed and talked.  Summer plans to classes to failed romances were among the many topics they discussed.
“You’re still such a Gryffindor,” Draco laughed.
“Oh. Okay.  Well, if you’d rather continue to work on things
“She wants me to sow my wild oats so when the time comes, I’ll marry Astoria and be content.”  Draco laughed humorlessly.  “Daphne refused.  She said it was too awkward that we both jerked you off.  She doesn’t like to share. Me, that is.”
“Oi, where are you going Harry?” Ron asked.
“Mother, you’re back a bit early,” Draco greeted his mother with a kiss on her cheek. “I wasn’t expecting you until tonight.”
The staring contest between Harry and Lucius dragged on far longer than any of them expected.
As a child, Draco overheard Knox’s great grandmother talking about how the two of them could pass for brothers.  She had gone so far as referring to Draco as the evil twin.  He knew it was what they all thought of him on that side of the family.  The fact that Lucius had been a suspected Death Eater only fueled the rivalry.
“Even you said you thought I had a thing for him Sixth Year.”
“High praise,” Draco smirked.
“Oh, yeah,” Harry said.  “I guess I forgot all about that.  What with the other bit of news.”
“Are you finished packing?” Harry asked.
“No word from Father yet?” he asked.
“What was that all about?” she asked her sister.
“That was fucking brilliant timing,” Draco sighed.
.  And his eyes.  Have you ever noticed?  They’re so . . .”
Hermione cleared her throat.  “Every moment you waste thinking it over could mean peril for Draco.”  She deliberately used his son’s first name to help persuade him. “I have special permission to escort you to the Manor.  In return for helping to rescue Auror Potter, your sentence will be reduced.”
“Let’s go get supper, then,” Hermione said.  Shaking her head, she muttered, “Boys.”
“Malfoy?”
“Will you marry me?” he exclaimed.  “Blimey, Ron, you didn’t tell me you were going to ask Mione to marry you!”
He nodded in reply and quickly left before she could change her mind about his detentions.
“Good night,” he whispered in her ear.
“You did eat a lot, Harry,” Draco said, leisurely twirling a lock of Harry’s hair.
Draco put his arms around Harry’s neck. “I’m not upset. I enjoy hearing your stories.  That’s why I’ve encouraged you to write it.”
“What,” the blond sneered.  “Finished already?  That was fast.”
“That’s Potter-Malfoy,” Harry repeated impatiently.  He was tired of people refusing to use their hyphenated names.
“Really?” Flitwick was surprised.
Finally comprehending what it was she was seeing, or more precisely, not seeing, Narcissa cried out.
“Happy birthday son.  Twenty-six.  I was twenty-six when you were born,” Lucius commented, but said nothing more about the subject.
Hermione smiled as well.  “That dream doesn’t sound so bad.  What are the children doing in the dream?”
Once in his office, he sat behind his desk and relaxed for the first time since leaving the Manor that morning.  Hermione went to the lounge to get some drinks while Harry gathered himself together.  She found him sitting and staring at the wall when she returned.
Harry immediately dropped the clothes.
“That’s Mister Potter-Malfoy,” Harry smiled at her.
Harry laughed.  “No, I would think not. But it affects me too.  And if I can help you and Narcissa, I will.”
Standing at the gates, Harry was filled with more conflicting emotions than he thought possible.
Slughorn inspected her cauldron and spooned out a bit to smell.  “Beautifully done Miss Granger.  You are my winner today.”
Bill picked up a plate to help Victoire choose some treats, while Harry loaded up a plate for Draco and himself to share.  Draco didn’t have much of a sweet tooth, but Molly had made a cinnamon crumb cake he thought Draco would like.
“Excellent idea,” Pansy agreed.  “Which bed is yours, Seamus?”  His eyes went wide and he pointed.  Pansy jumped on and slipped under the covers.
“Um, yeah.  I lost track of time working on something.  Everything is fine.”
He turned around to face Harry, who hadn’t responded.
“That’s all well and good,” Ron interrupted.  “We all did things we regret.  But how can you forget?  He called Hermione mudblood for years.”
“I’d love some.”
She cleared her throat. “Can you read this please, Draco?”  Her demeanor had changed quite a bit from she first approached him. Not quite compliant, but respectful.
Pansy began to laugh along with Blaise until she saw the expression on Draco’s face.  He was glaring at her in disbelief.
“Your magic is going a bit crazy, I can feel it.”
“It’s just that you usually need to make a good first impression with your boyfriend’s friend, and I’ve already made so many bad ones.” His other nervous tic was running his hand through his hair, and only saying that sentence he had done it three times.
“We can do that, yes.”
“With less hate than he has for most people?” he wondered.
“Haven’t done it in years.”
“Fine by me. I’ll just leave when he calls.”
Draco looked simply beautiful behind his desk, with his platinum hair in a messy bun, the glasses that he only used to read perched on his nose and his black robe that contrasted perfectly with his skin. God, he really wanted to kiss him.
“We are dating, I think it will happen sooner or later. Unless you don’t want to?”
“Not at relationships nor at confessing my feelings,” he said bitterly.
Harry looked at him for a couple of seconds, then he went back to doing his job.
“Good for us.”
“Yes," they all said, clearly way too excited at the idea.
“I forgot where I was going with that," he lied, trying to keep busy with cleaning his hands and his coat, turning around so that Harry could not see him.
“I feel safe with you, probably more than I ever have in my whole life. Which is quite pathetic now that I think about it, but oh well.”
Less than an hour later, Draco was sleeping on his shoulder and his fireplace was coming alive with Ron’s face.
He walked around the hall for another half an hour, only a couple people had the courage to ask him for advice, but other than that it was quite uneventful and everything went smoothly.
He woke up to Draco caressing his head, his other hand on his stomach and their legs intertwined. “Hi, love,” he whispered, immediately holding him closer. “How are you feeling?”
“Sounds like a plan. Get the water warm, I’ll go feed Theo.”
Harry obeyed immediately, just like he had been taught. Don't wait to see if your partner is right, if they tell you to move, you move. “What did you see?”
“Let me know how it goes.” He finished his coffee in one go and relaxed against his chair. Bad move.
“What did it mean?” he asked, barely more than a whisper.
Despite himself Harry took a sniff, and he couldn’t exactly say he was surprised when he smelled apples and the typical smell of the lake, followed by the posh perfume Malfoy bought every time he visited his parents in Paris. “Apples," he simply said.
“Of course.” He watched them leave, then he collapsed on his chair and hid his face behind his hands.
“I can do that, I know how important this is to you.”
“All good, Hermione says we can wait, that she just wanted to bring up the idea but she is okay with waiting a bit more if I’m not sure right now.”
“And Ginny is seeing someone else, too. I love her, and I loved what we had, but it ended for a reason, and now I just want to see where this will take us."
“Oh, you poor thing.” He only sounded relatively mocking, betrayed only by his concerned expression.
Draco smirked at him, smug, and reached inside his boxers. He muttered a spell, and soon enough the hand around his dick was covered in lube. “The only wandless spell I’ll ever need.”
“Kinda,” he said, and the way he said it and looked away clearly meant that he was done talking about those things.
“Yeah, but it sounds less romantic like this.”
“Well, some of us have to go back to work, I’ll fire-call you later this evening, alright?”
“I am, I just don’t like this. I don’t want to be the bad guy again, okay? The death eater who blindsided the saviour.”
“Since when do you follow rules?”
“Same old Potter," he said, but it lacked the venom it usually held. Even when he said his name, or well, surname, it didn’t sound like it used to back then, there was less bite to it.
“I love your dick, you know I’d never do it,” he said, because a sleepy Draco meant a very blunt Draco.
“Yeah, that sounds nice. Although you must know that I’m clueless at cooking.”
“Of course, thank you.” He smiled knowingly at him, and silently put a red collar in his hands. The cat had been put inside his carrier and all his other things shrunken inside a bag.
“I figured out what spell they used.” His eyes were basically sparkling, Harry could not remember ever seeing him so happy and proud, and it made him feel happy. Seeing him so confident, smiling and jumping around like a kid at Christmas, and he realised in that moment that he wanted to see more of this. He wanted to be next to him when he accomplished something, because he wanted to support and cherish him. He was fucked, and not in the good way.
“He makes me feel like it's worth it," he admitted, looking down at his hands. “And he gets me, like no one ever has. I never understood what you and Hermione had, how you always got each other and just knew immediately what the other was thinking, how you could be so compatible. But now I do. It's like we are on the same wavelength, and we can talk about everything. He even told me things about his dad, things he’d never said before.”
“Draco.” Maybe it wasn’t the best time for a love confession, but seeing Draco in his arms, with Theodore sleeping on his tummy, just made him feel so happy and at peace that he couldn't help himself. “I love you,” he whispered against his hair, marvelling at the fact that his hair still smelled of apples.
“Thank you.” Draco followed him to pay, while Harry ventured around the shop for a moment. He stopped to say hi to the owls, then he moved to the cat section and selected some toys for his new adopted baby. Even if Draco had said it wasn’t his cat for now, they both knew Harry was going to spoil him so much and be a very annoying pet parent. “Harry?” Draco found him with a toy mouse wriggling in his hands. “Ready to go?”
“You were seventeen too.”
“That’s what I like to think. It’s weird, you know. I don’t know anything about them, only stories I’ve heard. I don’t know what their favourite colours were, their favourite food or song. It’s like they are strangers at times, and yet they are still my parents. I just wish I had had more times with them.”
“I’m sure you’ve seen worse,” he said, trying to smile at him.
“Thanks.” He got up, doing a pretty good job of ignoring everyone's stare, and went outside.
“Well this is unexpected,” she muttered, leaving him alone for a couple of minutes while she retreated her vials.
“No, you don’t, you wouldn’t be spending all this time with me if that was the case.” He quickly looked around, then he got closer and grabbed his hand. “I really like this. Can’t wait to do this Saturday evening.”
“Stop it, of course it is..” He stepped back and helped him wear his coat again, then he put on his own and draped a scarf around his neck. “Ready.” He took his hand and squeezed it. “Ready?” he asked softly.
“Quick, dad discovered videogames yesterday.”
“Maybe.” Hagrid laughed, but became serious immediately after. “So, are you here for a visit in the forest?”
The mere idea of seeing Lucius Malfoy after all those years was rather unpleasant, the fact that he was his boyfriend's father was straight up terrifying. He had tried to convince himself that it was impossible to impress them and get close to them, that all he had to do was be civil and educated, but he was dreading it so much.
“I’m sorry this all happened to you,” he said, clearly shaken by what was going on.
“So you think it's the right time?” he asked, hopeful that Harry had all the answers.
“Whatever helps you sleep at night” he said, flicking his hand.
Someone took their coats, leaving Harry very confused and frankly feeling out of place, then Antoine, their waiter for the night, appeared behind them, and brought them to their table. The whole room was very red, from the floor to the chairs, everything except the walls which were green, and the thought of Draco surrounded by his colour almost made him laugh. All the tables were covered by a white cloth, and most of them already had people sitting around and eating their very expensive meals.
“Why would that be?” Draco asked, and Harry could see by the tension in his shoulders that he was trying really hard not to get angry.
“Uff, now you sound like McGonagall.”
“Thanks.”
“Well, I’ll leave you to it,” said Malfoy, making his presence known once again.
“You were.” He didn’t try to hide his smile. “But I know you apologised to Hermione and a lot of other people, it’s enough.”
“But of course, after the lessons. I won't ask if you need a room.”
Only in that moment he realised that they were both staring at him. “I’m sorry, I got lost in my thoughts for a moment.”
“Of course. We are going to do things properly, I really think we can make this work. Despite our past and what happened between us, I truly believe in us.”
“It's hard,” he said, because if there was a thing his therapist had taught him, it was to always be open and honest. “I thought it was going to be worse, but this is still home, always will be.”
But that year was ever more special.
“I'd love that. What do you say we make dinner for Ron and Hermione? So we could stay at my place instead of going over. Would that help?”
“How do you know?”
“And me,” he whispered.
“Bye" he said, laughing quietly.
“I know that now, but at seventeen I was just a dumb kid.”
As soon as they were all seated, a house elf appeared in the room and silently started serving them.
“Why did you say Blaise's name like that?”
“I do. And I’d like to sleep in your bed, with clothes on and no inappropriate touching.” He was openly mocking him, but Harry really couldn’t blame him. All of a sudden, he was nervous at the idea of sleeping with Draco. What if sex was terrible between them? How was it even going to work? He knew Draco was bossy, but was he bossy in bed? Because he wasn’t sure that was going to work for him. But then again sex wasn’t everything, was it?
“I’m scared,” he whispered.
After another check-up, and a long scolding about keeping an animal loose in the infirmary, they finally managed to go back to Draco's room and spend their last hours together.
“They are perfect, thank you,” he said, smiling to himself when Draco relaxed. He was such a perfectionist.
“I’ll go with Hagrid.”
“Yes, Mother's cousin. I never met him, but I admired him. At times I wished I could be like him and leave my family behind, get away from that madness.”
“Alright, thanks.”
“What do you mean? We work together, we have a professional relationship and we are trying to be friendly.”
“And the point is? Do you think I care about their opinion? I spent my whole life trying to please them, doing whatever they wanted because I thought they would love me more, now I just want to do whatever makes me happy. I don’t depend on them anymore, I have a job, my own apartment, I have a cat, they can cut me off whenever they want.”
“I’d never say no to a pizza.” He almost sounded scandalised. “Whoever think they were above pizza is just a sad person with a god complex.”
“I’m just glad you are okay. I’ll be fine.”
“Shall we move to the living room?” Mrs Malfoy asked, already getting up.
“So you want me to what? Come here in the evenings and teach the kids how to defend themselves?” He didn’t like this, he didn’t like this at all. This would mean more time at Hogwarts, and even more time with Malfoy. Sure, they could be civil, but for how long?
“No, I’m sorry. I’ll get a coffee when I get to the office.”
“He won't hurt you anymore, I promise you.” He got closer and put his hand on his back. “We don’t have to. I can do this alone to freshen up my memory and then I can finish the Map with Hagrid.”
“I can release a statement if you want. Tell them to shut the fuck up ‘cause it's none of their business.”
They changed in silence, for the first time in the same room, then took turns in the bathroom. It all just felt so natural, and it would have been lovely, had it not been for Draco's worried face.
Harry’s eyes were so wide it must have been painful. “You said it.” He was staring at him, his lips parted.
“Are you not pissed?”
“Of course, sir.” He picked up their menus as soon as he finished writing down everything Draco had said, and then he left again.
“Why did it change its mind?” another one of the boys asked.
“Here.” He sat down and moved the chair next to his for Malfoy, who sat down quickly and moved even closer.
He got closer to the animal to try and inspect it, but there was really nothing to look for. He scanned it with his wand, and he got his confirmation that no organ was inside. “What the fuck,” he muttered to himself. He tried to get samples from over the body, hoping that Hermione could find something, and put everything in his robe. When he turned around to leave, Malfoy was very pale and he was using the door to hold his weight, his knuckles white where he was gripping the handle. “Shit.” He reached him quickly and helped him step outside. “Breathe with me, Malfoy,” he instructed, but the man seemed in a sort of trance. “Draco, " he said, softly, and that seemed to snap him out of it. “There you are. You scared me for a second.” He pulled gently on his arm until Malfoy sat down on the grass, then he positioned himself in front of him.
They kept bickering throughout their whole meal, barely noticing the waiters bringing them food – a tarte tatin with roasted vegetables for Draco and stone bass and pastilla for Harry as their main course, and an apricot and Cointreau for both of them as dessert – and wine.
“Great.” He ran away to his room, looking for the Marauder’s Map. He knew it was a long shot, but it didn't hurt to have it with him. Especially if it meant he could catch students sneaking out and scare the shit out of them until they refused to even look at the forbidden forest.
“Good night, Malfoy” he said, not able to hide his smile.
“That’s why I like you, you are my special boy.”
“Oh God, why? It's going to be so embarrassing.”
. Could you please pick the wines for us?”
Draco simply passed them over, and looked at him expectantly.
“I don’t care, I’m just so happy right now.” He let go once again, and Draco was relieved to see how big he was smiling now.
“About what, exactly?”
“Okay so, the spell is the Homonculous Charm. The word homunculus refers to a human or humanoid, so I guess you weren’t too far off when you said it probably catches on to free will and stuff like that. Now. It's really hard to see the dots and names in the forbidden forest, mainly because it’s too intricate, but I was able to find something. There are a couple centaurs here and there, and I think I saw an acromantula.”
“You are fucking choking me you prat,” he said, with a lot less venom than usual.
They went back to Draco, who had sat up and had managed to put the carrier on his bed to play with Theodore.
“Thank you,” he said, a bit forced because of how embarrassed he was.
“I know, I just-I felt really vulnerable and scared, I hadn’t felt like this in so long. I think I’ll start going to therapy again, my semi-annual check-ups are not enough.”
He finally made his way upstairs and he was relieved when he found Draco still fast asleep, with his mouth hanging open and his hair in his mouth. He smiled to himself and left the tray on his nightstand, then he sat down on the bed and brought a hand to his face to move the hair away. He took his time just looking at him and gently touching his face, just taking him in and thanking whoever had made it possible for Draco to become his boyfriend.
“Mother,” he laughed, slightly embarrassed. “I’m fine, they feed me every day and I sleep a lot.”
“Yeah? Me, too.” He quickly kissed his shoulder just because, then he started eating, looking at Draco from time to time to make sure he liked his food.
“You don't have to tell me, but you can if you need to talk about it. I won't judge you."
“Of course.” He smiled softly at him, and they quickly made their way downstairs, leaving a very disgruntled kitten on their bed.
“Well, yes, but he seems... comfortable. I’ve never seen him looking comfortable. It’s like he really trusts you?”
“What a stupid fucking question,” he muttered, reaching out to touch his cheek. “Kiss first,” he demanded, puckering his lips.
“Okay then.” He sighed, resigned, and went looking for Theodore. He found him on the sofa, not scared like he thought he was going to be at first, no, he looked like he already owned the place. And them. “Hello there.” He sat down next to him and started petting him slowly, not wanting to startle him too much. “Your dad is pissed, can you help me?” He picked him up and went back to Draco, who was now setting up a corner for his toys. “Dad,” he said, putting Theodore in front of his face.
“It does, it’s more you.” He rested his chin in his shoulder, and Harry brought his hands up to cover Draco’s.
Harry's eyes went wide. "Her?"
I think this has kinda departed from the original thing I wrote, but it's kinda fun, so here it is.
"Very," said Harry, and pulled on Draco's hand. Draco moved with him, barely a step towards the bedroom door. He knew what Harry wanted, and knew that he was right. They both needed to sleep, to rest, and know that for once一for the first night since Draco had collapsed onto the coffee table一Draco wasn't in danger of dying in his sleep. "I bet it'll be even faster tomorrow."
"Good."
"Me?" Draco almost laughed, but his lungs hurt too much to get the sound out. "I'm not the one who leaves for month long missions. What do you have to be scared about me for?"
Draco sat and stared at the water, still shaking and rippling where Harry had left it.
Draco smiled a little bit. "My brain is very fast."
“You weren’t going to even go back for the new term?”
Draco thought.
Harry untangled one of his hands from Molly's grip and set it over Draco's. "Draco, love, don't look so worried. She can stay with us tonight, if you'd like." Harry shrugged and pulled Draco's fingers tighter in his. "It's not like we have some elaborate wedding night planned. We're just going home." Harry lifted both their hands and tilted Draco's chin up. When Draco looked at him, Harry was grinning. "Obviously, we've already done the deed." He looked pointedly at their baby in his arms. "There's no pressure to do anything special."
Four days left.
“I feel like I’ve lost you,” Harry said, interrupting Draco’s reverie.
Draco tilted his chin and flicked some of his hair behind his ear. "Glad you feel entitled to take advantage of my services."
Bailey whirled around. “Ah, Malfoy. I was looking for you.”
They roll again.
"Yes," Harry said absently.
Harry rose to his knees and pressed his mouth to Draco’s. There was no hesitation before Draco opened his mouth under Harry’s and pushed his hands up through his hair, holding him closer and closer by the nape of his neck. Harry went with him, wherever Draco moved and breathed.
“Don't apologize,” Kit interrupted. Her lips spread open in another wide smile. “I am glad to hear it. You don't say much. I want to hear about the things in your head.”
“I’m not,” Draco said, quiet.
, he said.
"I want to marry you," said Harry, simple and clear. "Really, really. And I want to raise this baby - Molly - with you. And I want to be a family, an official family, when we do."
Draco hugged Molly closer to his body. "I changed my mind."
There was no harried agitation about Draco's last day. He lay in their bed. Harry lay next to him, his body lined up beside Draco's, and very, very close.
pamphlets. The desk was in their living room, crammed into one corner by a tiny window, because Harry had insisted on leaving the spare room free for their friends to crash if needed.
. Draco had had quite enough of it. The case was already several months over schedule because of it. Several months wasted that Draco could have used in various other ways. New cases, Unspeakable recruitment, employee training, a week of vacation with Harry, appealing to Sullivan to get rid of the interns. The Unspeakables could get their own coffee, for heaven's sake (Draco had been making his own beverages for years for fear that one of the young interns would poison his cup on some diluted revenge path).
Draco looked to her. He didn’t need to ponder the issue. There were very few people in the world that Draco held interest in, very few that he enjoyed spending time with. Only one that he enjoyed spending time with, really. “I would love that,” he said.
Draco patted Wilson's shoulder. "Perfectly Harry."
Harry likes this as much as he likes Draco’s chatter. He likes knowing that Draco is quiet because of
“Yes,” Harry said, like he’d been waiting for Draco to ask that very question.
"Glad to hear it," Wilson said, and Draco turned to make his way to his desk.
“Okay,” Draco says. “Anything.”
“Lasagna!”
Very little time passed before Draco was reminded of why he had been avoiding this clearing in the first place.
Harry lets out a breath and holds out his hand for Draco to take. “I think you’re right, love. They really are getting dimmer.”
Harry nodded and looked around at the early sun glinting off windowpanes and crooked door handles, but Draco was sure he hadn't understood anything Draco had said or anything that was passing around him. Draco didn't mind. He held Harry's hand tightly in one hand, and held Scorpius' weight in the other arm, carrying the three of them along the stone pathways through Godric's Hollow. They passed the church, where Mrs. Hughes was toting her five children with her out the front door. She waved at them, and Draco nodded in return.
“Harry, let go of me.  We need to concentrate on you making it into that cup.”
They sat down and set up their pieces.  Draco poured a shot of firewhiskey each and pushed Harry’s across the table toward him.
“I can’t use that as an excuse for everything I’ve done.  I acted like a prick before I even knew there was a war.” Draco turned, not realizing that Harry had made his way over.
and he didn't want to have to look into a child's face that he was going to take care of for the rest of his life, and know that someday he would say,
Harry stiffened, held onto Draco, and that was that.
Draco sat up. “Well.” There was a pause. “That’s so dull.”
It wasn't long after the taste incident that Harry started taking Draco's work home with him for Draco to complete in the comfort of their apartment.
"He has an anxiety disorder," he tells them, glancing at Draco on the curb, his head in his hands.
So he held Scorpius tight to his chest and ran his fingers through the hair at the back of his head. He sang quietly in his ear and rocked gently from hip to hip. Scorpius murmured into Draco's neck in what Draco supposed was an attempt to sing along.
Harry laughed aloud. "Draco, we're in the middle of nowhere America-"
“Harry?” Draco said again. The sink in the kitchen turned off, and the sticky sounds of bare feet making their way across hardwood floors approached on the other side of the bathroom door. Draco tapped gently on the door from the opposite side. “Harry?”
"All spells, hexes, charms, jinx, and curses are based on Latin," Wilson said, as if it were obvious. It was obvious, but Draco shot him a stern look anyhow.
Draco watched Harry's mouth as he turned to the Healer and spoke. He couldn't do more than guess at the words, but he could almost hear Harry's voice, cracking and sore.
"You dolt," Harry said, still looking shocked and afraid. "I don't want to do that with anyone else. I want to do it with you."
? What does that even mean?"
Harry nodded, his mouth opening and closing without words, and continued to stare down at the test held between his hands.
. Honestly!”
Draco stared at the wall as Harry sobbed beside him, his ribs expanding desperately against Draco's side.
"I don't need you to do that, darling," Draco said when Harry first came home with a briefcase full of Draco's paperwork. "I can go into the Ministry just fine."
Scorpius held his arms out and Draco took him up in his arms, indulgent. It was okay to be indulgent today. It was a long walk from their house to the cemetery, and Scorpius hated the squeezes and brushes of magic. They had a car, of course, but the day was bright and warm with the beginning of summer, and Draco didn't see much point in wasting the nice weather.
Most Sundays, Harry seemed almost normal. He smiled small smiles that Draco knew were for his and Scorpius's benefit, and kept up polite conversation until they reached the gates into the cemetery. Then he'd get awful quiet, and go on ahead without them. He'd take his time with his parents, and then he'd come back with red eyes, and wouldn't smile until they were home again. That was most Sundays.
"The purifying enchantment is called
"Doing what?"
The first thing he wanted to say was
"Yes," Draco mumbled. "I'm very hot."
Harry sighed. “Oh, you know. Turning in work late left and right, but what I can do? I can’t resist their pleading faces.”
“Harry?”
"What is it?" he murmured, relaxed and dazed.
"Quite." Draco waved his hand through the air. "So. Adam Hornby一ugh, it’s still ridiculous一mastermind of the Mortem smuggling ring took over Robards' position in order to get us off his case. We can dig into how he got in there later."
Harry was staring at Draco's shoelaces. "You got new shoes."
It turned out that only one of his shirts needed adjustments, and one of the jackets was a little too long, but all of the other items Daisy had bought fit Draco well.
So when they rolled the baby into the room in a tiny rolling bed, Draco felt nothing.
”My wand,” Draco said, half turning. “Wand.”
Wilson was shaking his head vividly. "No, no. We got it wrong. Mortem wasn't the man; Mortem was the smuggling ring. The man was Adam Hornby."
Scorpius set his head down in the crook of Draco's neck, and Draco soothed his hand over his back as he walked around the edge of the house to the pathway into the main cobbled road. Harry stood waiting, his head down and his hand resting on the fence. Draco approached slowly and hushed to Scorpius to keep him calm and quiet.
"I don't want to drive," Draco says. "Ever again."
“Of course,” Harry said, breath shaky. “Silly me.”
The students go into a frenzy, jumping up and running from table to table, expressions of shock painted over their faces.
Harry's hand, resting gently on Draco's thigh, brought him back to the present.
Draco had been sitting in the breakroom with the
Harry threw his hands in the air. "Robards even said before we left to kick back and relax while we were out here. He said it'd be like a vacation."
Draco is completely silent, still shaking. His mouth opens to let out small whimpers in between the trembling of his bottom lip.
Harry breathes deeply, and wishes he could push a big breath into Draco's lungs. "Thank you for telling me."
." Draco set the book he'd been reading down and reached forward to run his hands through Harry's hair. He could hardly feel the texture of the strands anymore, but he could still feel the tension easing out of Harry's neck through the stroke of his palm, and that was enough.
“Everyone’s safe,” he tells her, but she still looks scared out of her mind, and Harry understands.
Draco rolled up into a seating position and glared blearily at Harry, tangled in the sheets and curled up facing Draco, still very asleep.
Draco ran his hands through the water and watched the ripples from his movement eat up the bubbles. They sat and Harry watched him until all the bubbles were nearly gone and the bathwater was lukewarm.
"Is that why you like it?" Draco asked finally, his hand still firmly in his lap. "Because it weeps and thunders like you do?"
, Harry said again. Draco nodded and nodded, and kept nodding when Harry fell against him and sobbed, inaudibly, into Draco's cheek.
he'd said.
Draco twirled around in his chair. "Yes?"
Why, in the darkness, was he still breathing?
Harry turned and kissed Draco soundly. “I can’t wait to see it.”
“Oh, no you don’t.” Ron pulled her back.  “You’re not stepping foot out of this room.”
Harry kissed Draco’s neck and sucked on an earlobe. He whispered, “Shower.”
“Wha-what did I say?”
HDHDHD
“I mean the part about me.”
He excused himself and quickly made his way to intercept the boy.  Draco was too late, though, and by the time he got there, Casper was knelt down in front of Penelope Pipshaw.  The girl’s eyes were large as saucers as Casper stuttered out his request.
“I think it’s sweet,” Hermione softened.  She kissed his cheek.
September 1 1998
“Have you done something?  Something you think I won’t like?” Harry questioned, the worst scenarios running through his head.
“Can we go for a walk later?” he asked, still sounding so incredibly sleepy and adorable.
“Looks like we are on the same page then.”
“Well yeah, we’ve been a couple for a week.” He pulled away and tried to hide his embarrassment. He really had fallen quite fast for him.
“I talked with professor Malfoy earlier, and he told me you had some trouble with a couple of Gryffindors.”
“That’s what I was thinking too," he said, trying to ignore Malfoy next to him, who had once again gotten very tense at the mention of Voldemort. “So, what do you think we should do?”
“I just hate feeling so weak and vulnerable.”
“That’s my Draco.”
“I promise you, you can leave whenever you want to. Molly won’t mind at all, and the others just do whatever she says so you’ll be fine.”
“Of course, dear.” Of fucking course, the only pet name Draco used was ‘dear’, so bloody posh once again, Harry was so endeared it almost made him furious with himself.
They followed her inside, Draco still with a hand on his back.
“Better than I was hoping for,” Harry admitted once they were out.
“You can't just go in there,” Draco protested, holding his hand tighter.
He sat next to him and warmed his hand with the cup, trying to buy himself some time. Why he was freaking out all of a sudden, he had no idea. “Great, I found the wizard who was selling stuff to muggles, I had coffee with Ron, and I found the perfect place for our date. How was your day?”
“This is nice, we can do this,” he said, and from his voice Harry could tell how tired he was. He had been working so hard on the Map, and on top of that he had to grade papers and work on their lessons together and he always made it his priority to find time for Harry.
“Take him, boys," Ron told the two guys behind him. “Go ahead, I’ll come soon.”
“I’m alright, I just want to make sure that thing is never coming back and that whatever he did to Draco was not dangerous.”
“What is it?”
“Oh, c’mon, Potter, keep up.” He smiled at him, always so smug but also with something that looked a lot like fond in his eyes. He had noticed it lately, the way Draco looked at him, like he really, really liked him. He was pretty sure his face was even worse considering he had a harder time hiding his feelings.
“They told us to be careful, as if we could control all those teenagers who wants to sneak out into the night. We do what we can, but I’m pretty sure everyone at this stable has sneaked out at least once and has not been caught.”
“Thanks, I needed this.” He relaxed against his chair and took a sip of coffee. “I'm just scared to fuck up, and that Hermione will get pissed at me and my kid won’t take me seriously or something.”
“Isn’t it obvious? We don't exactly have a great history with your boyfriend, she was scared something was going to happen and that you’d never come visit again.”
“Merry Christmas.”
“What do you need to buy?” They were almost there, so they weren’t holding hands anymore, which only made Harry clingier and more annoying because he wanted Draco’s attention and especially because he wanted to distract him.
Hagrid was there, with Narcissa Malfoy, Voldemort, Bellatrix was still alive as well, with her usual manic smile.
“I want you to get along with my friends, but you don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to. Ron is just really happy for me; he knows how important you are to me and he wants you two to get along. Or well, to at least not hate each other?”
“So. You and Draco. Didn’t see this coming,” Hagrid said, trying to keep him occupied.
Harry wanted to left, he didn’t feel comfortable listening in to that conversation, but the door had already been closed and he had no place to go.
“Yes, please.” Without realising it he reached over to take Draco’s hand.
“Sure, whenever you want, just send us a letter.”
“Malfoy,” he said with a quick nod of his head. “Hermione and I would love to have dinner with you two. Do you want us to bring anything?”
“Yes, we will start with
“That’s not it. I just, I kinda liked sleeping in your clothes?”
“That’s great, thank you for letting me know.”
“You’re very welcome.”
“That's exactly why. I know you aren’t as petty as I am, but I was scared of being rejected again,” he said, while still looking around to try and memorise as many things as possible.
“But I also owe it to you two. You did a really great job.”
“Are you as bossy in bed as you are in your day to day life?” he couldn't help but ask.
“I got this, she said I just need to practice.”
“You wanna talk about it?”
“I was cruel,” he said, and it was visible how difficult it was for him to admit it. It looked like he’d rather have jumped down from the stairs than have that conversation with him. He couldn’t agree more.
“Didn’t think you were so eager to meet them.”
“That's the thing though, I feel like I don't deserve to feel like this, especially not when I compare myself to what you went through.”
“No, don’t even try it.” He moved away, ignoring Draco’s sad eyes. “Not working,” he lied. Damn it, now he even had a cat to try and win him over any time they disagreed on something. He was fucked.
Since he always spent most of his holidays with the Weasleys, he put up a tree but never bothered to decorate it too much. He liked doing it, but he wasn’t the best at it and he had always found Christmas balls too boring and pain.
“Yeah? Me, too. A true Gryffindor.”
“It brings back bad memories.”
“Two each.” He reached for the one with his parents and the one of him and Draco, and he took a step back to look at the tree and find the best spots. He opted for centre place for his parents, and near the top for the other one, while Draco put the other two on the sides. “It looks better now,” he said, and he smiled happily when Draco hugged him from behind and kissed his cheek.
“Okay then.” Malfoy took his place on the chair next to Harry’s and folded his hands on his lap, looking quite nervous.
“God, you are annoying.” She pushed him slightly, and then her eyes settled on Malfoy. He knew she was going to be the hardest one to convince. After they had lost Fred, she had not been able to move on at all, and seeing Malfoy in her home must have been very hard for her. He had thought about warning her, but he wasn’t sure she would have agreed to it. He was going to make it up to her one way or the other. “Hi,” she said, clearly tense.
“Let’s go, then.”
“I’m sure you will. Otherwise that’s what I'm here for.”
“You are brilliant at everything, though."
“Two centaurs, a unicorn, some other small animals. Hagrid said he saw a couple of acromantulas as well.”
“It doesn’t matter. Do you want me to check your back?”
“Are you nervous?”
“Shouldn't take too long then.”
It was ten, everyone was there, ready to finally find out what was going on inside the forest.
“Okay, she was married and she wants you to settle down, what else?” He asked, taking another bite of his meal. He was eating so much slower than he usually would, but he was scared of looking like an idiot and he actually wanted to enjoy it. Especially considering how much it was going to cost him.
“You don’t have to. Your mother saved my life, and I believe you did too when we were at the Manor.”
“Okay, you have a point, but you don’t have to leave. Just give me five minutes with Ron and hopefully Hermione and then we can talk about dinner at my place.”
“Yes, sorry.” He mimicked his position and closed his eyes. “Do I know him?”
“It could be if you are up for it. Listen, I think I made it pretty clear, I want stability, I’m in this for the long run, so either you run away now, or I’ll try and keep you for as long as possible.”
“That's fine," he rushed to say. “I know it’s early, I-“
Ron and Hermione were barely out of the door when Harry pushed Draco against the wall to hug him.
He quickly made some pancakes, trying to make their breakfast as light as possible because he knew Molly was not going to be happy unless everyone had had at least two servings of everything, and then he put them under a charm as to not let them go cold. He then went outside to pick some flowers – it turned out that Draco was, in fact, great with plants – and he set them on the tray.
“Love,” he said softly, brushing his hair from his face. “Wake up.”
“Okay, little secret for you since we are dating now.” He got closer, and his breath against Harry's neck made him shiver. “I get off on pleasing people. Shocking, I know,” he whispered. And how his voice went that deep Harry really didn't know, but it was doing weird things to his body.
“Well you did now.” He lifted their hands and smiled at him. “It's fine, I guess I’ve never been taught how to accept no as an answer. I was offended, I took it way too personally, so obviously the only way to go about it was to bully you.”
“Alright then.” She let her memories flow inside the pensive, then she put her head inside of it.
“I suppose.”
“That’s a very good idea, my love. I’m proud of you.”
They tried to walk as quickly as possible through the Leaky Cauldron, keeping their heads down and not talking, and thankfully they managed to get out with only a couple of people saying hi but not stopping them.
“You too.” He pressed a kiss against his cheek, not really caring who was looking at them. “Ready?” He looked behind himself, to check that everyone was where they were supposed to be. Behind him stood one of the new Aurors, Tom, then Draco, McGonagall, the other Auror Mark, and Ron and Hagrid in the back. He started walking, keeping the Map at his side and the wand ready. The forest was thick and dark, but some light still managed to get through, so they had decided to light up their torches only if needed, to draw as little attention as possible.
“Of course you can.”
“Well that must have been quite the scene to walk into,” Harry said to break the silence while they were walking to Malfoy’s study.
“Expelliarmus,” she said, loud and clear.
“Obviously." He smiled at him and looked around as well. “Almost there.”
“He had nightmares about it. He said it was so hard to watch it happen.”
“Then good, nothing would make me happier.” He hugged him, careful not to squeeze Theo, and he just stayed there a moment, enjoying it all: Draco’s body against his, his perfume, Theo still asleep between them, and the whole Weasley family happily chatting all around them.
“You don't need to convince me. I want to protect this school just as much as you do.”
“Because of my breakdown? I will have many more, don’t worry.”
They all said good bye, and once again they were alone.
“Always.” He winked, then he grabbed his pyjamas and left for the bathroom.
“Alright."
“I didn’t protect you like I had promised you.”
“I went out with another Auror for a while, but it never got serious between us. We both just wanted to fool around for the moment being so we called it off and I have not even been on a date since.”
She let him in immediately, and before he could sit down, she already had tea ready on her desk.
“We don’t have to, but it has to happen sooner or later. Mother will just come here all the way from Paris if necessary, I know her.” He started caressing his neck with one hand, moving the other to his chest. If he was trying to distract him and get him to agree, it was working.
“I had a talk with McGonagall,” he started, nervous all of a sudden. “Fuck, not here.” He took his hand and started dragging him toward the greenhouses.
“I know my letter wasn’t very detailed Harry, so I’ll give you some more information. There have been some weird reports coming from the centaurs and Hagrid himself, of animals and other creatures killed in the forbidden forest. We don’t know who it is, surely not a student, so we would like you to give some special lessons on Defence Against the Dark Arts, with the help of professor Malfoy.”
“I mean, I love him, I want to do everything I can to make him happy.”
“Thank you.”
“Then perhaps you can tell Robards you’re working on our case. Listen, Harry, I wouldn’t trust anyone else. Not only are you the best choice to teach the kids, but you know the forbidden forest and its creatures way more than you should. Hagrid said he'll come with you when you start exploring, and he'll show you where they found the killed animals.”
“Shut up, you are here to talk about your relationship. How did it go?”
“I really don't care about what we are doing, I just want to be alone with you and be able to hold your hand in public. Besides, the fact that you are taking me to a place with a dressing code is already promising. And French food is always appreciated.”
“Everything will be fine, I promise you.” He forced him away from the litter box and helped him stand. “Trust me, okay?” He hugged him, relieved when Draco just went with it and kissed his neck. “I have a kid now, I need to take care of him.”
“Very weird period. But we like it that way.” He shrugged, and when he looked up at Draco he was staring at him with wide eyes and a pained expression. “Excuse me, I better go save my boyfriend.”
“The day of the battle, when I went into the forest.”
“I think they buried the poor creatures after a while, but I'm sure you won't have to wait long for another one.”
“Good.” He kissed him again, not able to stop himself now that he could finally do it.
“Anything for you.” He pinched his cheek, then he got up before Draco could get his revenge. “What do you say we get out of here and ask the elves to make us something to eat in bed?”
“Ssh, let me have it.”
“Only the best for my posh... what are you?”
He decided to take McGonagall’s advice and go see Draco at work. He wasn’t sure how he would have taken it, but he still put on his invisibility cloak and left.
“Is there something in my soup that could bite?” he asked, dead serious.
“Did you know that McGonagall used to have a cottage near the school where she lived with her husband?”
“Should we keep it a secret for now? At least while you’re still here.”
“Isn’t he?” he asked, lighting up. Fuck, he was so gone for that little kitten. “We almost taught him how to sit this evening. I didn’t know cats could do it but Draco insisted that our Theo is so smart.” And he was babbling about his cat. Time to go. “Ehm, anyway. Good night, thank you again.”
“It would be better to leave tonight, but I guess I could sleep with you and leave early in the morning.”
“No, it’s different, it's almost like they just left the skin, there is nothing inside. The eyeballs are missing too.”
All the students nodded and started to work. A couple of them managed at the first try, and Draco was quick to praise them, but he never forgot about the other ones. He spent five minutes with a girl who was going crazy, and when she managed to get the spell right, he seemed happier than her.
“Are you sure? Like you do realise what you are doing, right?”
“Of course. I wouldn’t have asked you to come here if I didn’t know I could count on you.”
“Are you sure?”
“Precisely,” she said, not bothered by Harry sounding on the verge of a breakdown. “You could also just stay here, you know? To investigate in the morning.”
“Draco, I legit just told you that I love you. I don’t want to leave you, I want this to work, and I will do whatever I can to make it last, okay? kDo you not trust me or is there more?”
“I hate you." He turned around to give him his back, and Draco immediately pressed himself against him. “Please tell me it wasn’t talking about the Weasleys that got you so worked up.”
“Alright,” came Draco’s amplified voice. “You’ll manage to look at him at dinner and when your lessons start, now go back to the great hall.” No one moved, they just started talking louder and snickering. “Now," he said, and even Harry found him scary. Finally, the students started moving, and slowly they all left, leaving Harry alone with Malfoy.
“I want to say boyfriends, but I’m not sure if it’s too early.”
“Yeah, I’ll work on Christmas morning if they need me. Or maybe I can take a week off. I haven’t been on holiday this year, I still have my days off.” Ron and Hermione had not liked his decision to not take time off work that year, but in that moment, he was very glad for his past self.
They all followed her, Draco and Harry holding hands now that they were finally able to be close again, and Lucius Malfoy just walking quietly behind them.
“You’re even prettier when you smile, did you know that?”
“And how would the press feel if our saviour said those things?”
“I’m not sure.” He stopped without notice and Malfoy bumped into him, almost sending them both to the ground. “Careful.” He turned around and helped Malfoy to stay upright. “Alright?” he asked.
“I'm not completely useless, you don’t know what you’re going to find.”
Malfoy was going absolutely crazy, he had been pacing up and down his room for five minutes with his hands in his hair when Harry decided that enough was enough.
They managed to go outside quickly, but Draco took of the cloak only once they reached the gates. He gave it back to Harry, who shrunk it and put it in his pocket.
“Do you really want me to?”
The next morning Harry woke up with Draco curled up against him. His head was on his shoulder and his hair all over his face, while his legs were somehow intertwined to his. He really turned into a giant octopus during the night.
Harry changed quickly as well, getting into his grey pyjamas with shooting starts. You could tell he had not been laid in a while.
“Yeah? Okay, then.” He turned his head slightly and accioed a book from the table, trying his best not to move Draco too much.
“Good evening,” the maître welcomed them, smiling politely. “Do you have a reservation?”
Malfoy took the Map out of his pocket and opened it on the table. “I'm still working on this. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” The map started forming, and he pointed them to the part he had added, showing a blur of trees. “I made it as simple as I could because I don’t know how the forest is made. We need someone who knows it very well, we could ask Hagrid."
“Maybe, yeah. You two should really rest, though. This case is not yours anymore, Robards finally came to his mind.”
“You don’t have to tell me, I know you also care about me. I mean you got a cat for me.”
“Yeah and you are doing better than all of us combined cause they knocked you off with some good stuff. Get up."
“This is so great. Why don’t you go show Hagrid while I tell McGonagall you made some great discoveries?”
“Don't lose your mind over this. Mine was just an idea, nothing more. It's completely up to you,” he said, noticing how Draco had tensed up at the idea. He really wasn’t good at hiding his bad feelings. Smiles and being happy? He was great at not showing that, but when he was upset it was written all over his face and Harry really couldn’t stand to see him like that.
“You can start wearing them again after our one-year anniversary, when the flame is gone and we are just settling down.”
“Oh, now we are getting married?” He sat up more upright to look at him, and Harry was expecting a more panicked smile, not a huge grin and crinkled eyes.
“We are more mature now.” At that she lifted an eyebrow and looked at him sceptically. “Okay, maybe not mature. But a lot of things have changed. Malfoy has changed. He is a completely different person now, he dropped the attitude and snarky remarks, and kept his brilliant mind and impeccable manners. And the fact that he opened up, with me of all people, it made me feel like he really wants this change. I’m really glad you took him in when he needed it most, thank you.”
They walked slowly, careful not to wake up the little beast. When they reached the castle, a few students were just walking by, enjoying the chilly air of November. They all said hi, but were too preoccupied noticing the cat to even think about the fact that Harry and Draco were coming home together.
“Alright," Draco's voice resonated thought the hall, “that’s all for tonight, please go straight to your rooms.”
“No, it's not that, I love teaching with you and I love having you here. I don’t know what I was worrying about, I’m sorry.”
Malfoy laughed – a real laugh caused by him, wow – and simply said “told you.”
“How come?”
“Do you think you can take all of the twenty-four off to go to Paris?”
“Calm down, it will just be extremely uncomfortable and boring.” He put a hand on the small of his back while they were waiting for someone to open the door. Draco's parents had moved to a smaller house in the middle of the countryside, surrounded by vineyards and roses.
“You are ridiculous,” he couldn’t help but say.
“I have. Multiple times.”
in my house, I’m kind of paranoid, I always feel like someone is watching me.”
“We should go back inside, your nose is getting red.” He bopped his nose and immediately felt how cold it was. “Let’s go, I have some cuddling to do."
“So, what can I do for you?” she asked, her tone always very stern, but her soft smile betraying her.
“You like Christmas?” For some reason, that idea was incredibly funny to him. Draco, pureblood, raised to hate muggles, loved Christmas. “Is it to piss of your father?”
“After you are ready.” He got up and moved to Theodore’s corner to feed him. “Slowly, you little monster.” He sat down next to him and just watched him eat. It was weird, but he could see himself with a cat. He didn’t know if he was ever going to have that bond again, but in a way, Theodore reminded him of Hedwig. For starters, they were both white with a bit of black, they both were little rascals who liked to bite but also enjoyed a good cuddle. Then there was obviously the fact that Draco looked adorable with Theodore, and he really was a sucker for his boy.
“What happened to us? From hating each other to going on dates and talking about our teachers. Oh God we are old." Dramatic as always. He never thought he would even like Draco as a friend, but there he was, smiling at him and finding all his little quirks extremely adorable.
“Draco please, talk to me," he said, circling his shoulder with an arm to stop his shaking. “Love, please.”
“Are you being serious?” he asked, and for once Harry really couldn’t read his expression.
know that?” Well that was weird. He had never stopped to think about teachers’ lives outside Hogwarts. He had heard some of them mention a spouse, but that was the extent of it.
“Granger,” he replied. He was trying his best, he really was, but his shoulder had tensed up and he looked more serious than he had a couple of minutes before.
“I will remind you every day of how amazing you are until you start believing me. How does that sound?”
“You were young, and your father-"
“You were,” Harry confirmed, “pining and pining and then some more pining.”
“Here, Draco will have to bring him to my house whenever he comes visit.” The idea made him sad, which was totally ridiculous considering they’d had him for a day.
He was getting more nervous as the time went by, but for the first time he wasn’t scared about himself. What if the guy wasn’t a ghost? What if he was going to recognise Draco and attack him? Harry had no idea what he would have done at that point. He didn’t want to screw up, but he was ready to if it meant saving him. And that’s why they tell you to never mix work and feelings.
“Okay,” he said, looking almost shy. “Here’s your second gift,” he said, trying to gain back his composure, and he extended another package.
“Interesting. Do you have to look through all of it or can you find a specific person?”
“He’s yours.”
“Yeah, thanks, good night,” Draco said, slightly less embarrassed than before.
“Okay, you went straight from father-to-be to old grandma at family gatherings.” He slapped his hand away.
“Since I’m not a teacher, do you think it would be appropriate for me to sit with them at dinner?”
“I need to talk with you.”
“I’m fine, just give me a minute or two.” He sat down, and Draco was immediately next to him, with an arm around his shoulders.
“I don't know if I’ll ever accept this. Part of me still thinks I don’t deserve anything,” he admitted, confirming Harry’s worries bout Draco not feeling worthy of love.
“I guess.”
Draco just looked at him with a weird expression, which he managed to wipe away with a quick kiss. “I’m sorry, I’m just really happy about this dinner.”
“A tiny detail. You are more like them than you realise,” he teased.
“Well, well, well.” Ron opened the door with his red robe blowing in the wind.
“Scared, Potter?” he asked, smirking at him.
“I don’t know, I was just asking.”
“What do
“You're not going to lose me. I'm not going anywhere.” He stepped up closer and hugged him from behind, leaning his head against his shoulder.
“Why should I be? I just wasn't expecting this.”
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted him. “It's a-" he cut himself of, clearly unsure of how to continue.
“Or daddy?” He smirked at him, smug when Draco adverted his eyes.
“I don’t,” he said, but as soon as those words left his mouth, he wasn’t so sure about them. Did he like Malfoy? He liked spending time with him, he liked that they could talk and just understand each other without the need to explain things, he also liked how caring he was with the kids, and the fact that he was trying to better himself. He was also incredibly hot, especially when he wore his glasses, but that wasn’t the point.
“How is your mother doing?” he asked. He wondered about her from time to time. Even if for selfish reasons, she had saved his life.
“Now rest, both of you. The headmistress will arrive soon, she wants to talk with you.” She left before they could even answer.
“Because we somewhat get along, and I will not watch you break down.”
“What is it?”
He ran as fast as he could, sure that Malfoy would not have appreciated him being late. He was right. When he finally reached the door, Malfoy was standing there with his arms crossed and his foot tapping the floor. “Sorry, I momentarily forgot how big this place is. I had to jump to get on the stairs, I almost fell down.”
He laughed at that. It was slightly amusing to see how he was trying to please everyone. He knew the whole family was aware of that and that they were doing it in purpose to some extent, but he also knew that it was their way if accepting him, they were simply testing him. “I took him to visit my parents yesterday,” he said, as he started filling a glass with water.
“I want to.”
“I guess that too. It’s just really nice to spend time with him, we have fun together but we also have serious moments. Hopefully, now there will be also some cuddles.”
“I know, don’t get used to it.” He started walking, dragging him along. The gate opened for them, and by a silent rule they slowed down, dragging the moment on just a little bit longer.
And then someone screamed, and it wasn’t just someone, it was Draco, and it was a scream of pain. He turned around quickly, ready to kill anyone who had even dared touching his boyfriend, but he had to stop.
“Alright. They moved to Paris after dad was released, now the Manor is mine.”
“What Map?” She simply smiled at him, and for a moment Harry was scared she was going to wink, but in the end, she settled for a little nod. “Keep it away from the kids, and you can do whatever you want.”
“I’m just resting my eyes,” he said, rubbing his cheek against Harry’s shoulder.
“Let’s do it.” He started walking faster, looking for a dark place where they could apparate from without being seen.
“I’ve never tied anyone up, " he admitted.
“He’s brilliant, you're gonna have a great time.”
In the evening Harry went back to his own room to pack his things, and then he stopped by the headmistress’s office to say his goodbyes and ask to be allowed to use the Floo connection the next morning.
“Can you get me some water, please?”
“I know.” He brought him closer so that Harry could rest his head on his shoulder. “I guess you’ll also have to meet my family sooner or later.” He sighed, clearly not happy at the idea. “You really don’t have to, I can’t Imagine you like my father that much.” He left a kiss in his hair, and Harry felt so warm all over. He was so embarrassing, Ron was never going to stop taking the piss.
That same night he decided to start investigating. He finished his food and ran to his room as fast as he could without looking crazy, managing to avoid almost all the kids trying to follow him. He changed into his comfortable clothes and left the room. Thankfully, the students weren’t allowed to leave the castle after dinner, so as soon as he exited the door, they stopped following him.
“Look at you, did you get lucky? Don’t tell me it’s professor Trelawney.”
“All good?”
“Sappy?”
“Thank you,” they said at the same time.
“That’s good, I guess? I mean, it seems like he cares?”
Draco got closer, and the cat looked at him with curious eyes. “How much does it hurt from one to ten?” He put his hand close to the kitten and moved his fingers until he bit him. “You are just playing, aren’t you?” The cat seemed to answer him and rolled on his back on Harry’s hands, looking at Draco expectantly. “Oh, look at you, what a show off. Are you trying to buy my love?” He got closer, so that only Harry and the kitten could hear. “It’s working.” He then looked at Harry, looking conflicted for half a second. “I’ll get him” he said, loud enough for the shop assistant to hear.
