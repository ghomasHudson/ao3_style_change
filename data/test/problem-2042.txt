harry: guys
harry: that it does
neville: so
“Oh.” Pansy said. “They’re worried about us.” She sounded surprised. “I mean, of course they are. They’re- they’re our friends.”
harry: yeah, we could’ve gotten you...
luna: am i right?
sirius: you might even say exclusive
harry: okay yeah i’m coming
hermione: ok and???
draco: well i’m not quite sure what it is nothing’s like official yet
pansy: is it now
harry: then why’d you become a death eater?
blaise: we’ll go on then, ask him to the ball
dean: ha you sound like yoda
harry: no ur not
neville: nvm it’s stupid ur probably busy i’ll just bring ginny
blaise: hey plant boy
harry: hey guys hate to disappoint but i will not be attending the yule ball, sorry babe ur gonna have to find another date
“Alright, this one’s for all my happy couples out there.” Slow music boomed over the ballroom. Seamus rolled his eyes, groaned, and put his head down in his hands. Pansy looked around the ballroom. Luna had just gotten up to dance with Ginny. Everyone and their mother saw that coming. Draco and Harry were dancing. Blaise and Neville. Hermione and Ron. They were the only two left.
Seamus ran. He literally ran away. Merlin, how could he be so stupid. This would ruin everything. Everything.
“That dick. I was gonna finish that.”
sirius: siri yes
harry: eh that’s not that important
dean: i just had to be in gryffindor didn’t i
ginny: right
“Seamus.” The name rang out again, but this time the voice wasn’t Pansy’s. Seamus dropped the bottle of Vodka and whipped his head around. Standing there, he saw a confused Dean Thomas who had Hannah Abbot attached to his other arm. Seamus felt as though he could vomit. Or cry. Or maybe both.
“Try. Or we’ll be contending with your mum and Molly.”
Harry had died today. It hit him all over again. But instead of being filled with grief and confusion and pain it was somehow...funny. He had died. He had walked into the Forest on the memories of a man he loathed to be killed. It was hilarious. It was absolutely the funniest thing that he had ever heard in his life.
“...Thanks, Ginny.”
“Of course, dear. You take all the time you need.” Molly patted his hand before she pulled away. He could practically feel Draco and Hermione share a look over his head.
“Draco Malfoy. I died and came back from the dead and defeated the darkest wizard in a century. And that was just today. I think you and I can manage to stay friends after we walk out of this classroom.”
“It’s okay. We had a good run. Short but good.” Ginny gave him a kiss on the cheek and stood up. “Want me to give Malfoy the shovel talk since Ron apparently isn’t going to?”
“I suppose there’s a reason the Sorting Hat never even thought about putting me into Ravenclaw.” Draco laughed.
“You are family, Harry. You know that right?”
“I imagine that is what everyone will expect of you.” Draco tightened his grip on Harry as if that bothered him as much as it bothered Harry. “I suppose we don’t need to figure it all out right now.”
Harry had rushed in the moment the door opened, rushing towards Draco. His head cleared and all he could focus on was the boy in front of him.
“Potter again?” Blaise asked.
Anyway, enjoy the chapter!
Harry nodded slowly. He clenched his fist to stop them from shaking and steeled his breath. Harry patted his pockets, searching for his wand.
“Well, then,” Ron said. “I’ll be off.” He turned and made his way back up to the boy’s dorm.
I didn't expect anyone to read this, I was posting it for fun, but seeing the hits and kudos made my day!! Thank you so much!!
Although, Harry didn’t really want to think right now.
Thank you all again for the support!
Harry jumped at the touch. He saw who was next to him and sighed. Looking back at Hermione, he gave her a troubled look.
Harry tuned out the voices and focused on getting Draco to safety. All that mattered now was that Draco was alive.
Draco noticed how Harry rarely studied during the day, he instead stayed up late in the common room and studied alone. Harry was always tired after those nights, even if he didn’t show it.
(Subscribe to the work for updates!)
The next chapter is going to be New Years!! I love how this matched up with no planning lol :D
Here is a brand new one for you all :)
TW: SELF HARM & throwing up
So sorry that I've done this to our beloved Draco, but don't worry, it is all going to be okay.
“Ah, the studying thing,” Draco said.
Harry stops and looks up at Draco. He takes a deep breath and opens his mouth to speak, but no words come out.
the next chapter should come out within two weeks or sooner. I don't really have a schedule still, summer is just as hectic and crazy as school is
Hermione blinked once, recovered from the shock, and strode over to the couch. She placed a hand on Harry's shoulder and shook him awake.
Harry ignored it all, turning it to white noise in his mind.
The boys walked back to the common rooms together quietly, each buried in their own thoughts.
“Come on, Harry,” Ron stood and held out a hand for his friend. “Let’s get cleaned up and then we can come back.”
When Draco felt something heavy fall onto his shoulder he jumped slightly. Turning his head to look at what had dropped, he found a sleeping Harry Potter.
“Listen, Potter, We don’t talk to each other, don’t look at each other. Okay? I don’t want to deal with this right now.” Draco said angrily.
Hope you enjoy it!
Draco, instead of smiling back like he wanted to, glared at Harry. He threw a bag of snacks at his head. Harry pulled out his wand quickly, stopping the bag mid-air. He brought it towards him with his wand and grabbed it, throwing it open.
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding, he felt tears roll down his face as he closed his eyes. He wrapped his arms around Draco, burying his head in the boy's shoulder, not caring that people were watching.
And again Merry Christmas everyone!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
Hope you enjoy it!!
Harry started to write the statement that had been in his head before Draco had very rudely interrupted him.
___________________
Harry shook his head. “No, Draco, look it's just,” He took a breath. “I was, am, confused with all of this.”
Thanks for reading!! if you’re liking it so far please leave comments or kudos, seeing it makes my day and keeps me motivated to write more!
Thanks a bunch!! :D
He had no idea why he had started helping Harry. Just days ago he was arguing with him. The truth is, he had gotten used to living with Harry already. He was starting to like it.
“I guess so.” Harry turned back around and continued walking back to class.
We've got some Draco POV in this one as well
Harry looked up at Draco as the other boy stilled his hand movement. They both had tears running down their cheeks silently.
Green vines circled the snake's body, flowers bloomed off of the vines. There were purples, deep blues, cyan, dark reds, and yellow flowers everywhere. The snake's face was covered in red roses, the skull was wearing flowers on the top of it.
Hope you all enjoyed!
Harry glared back at Draco and grabbed a new piece of parchment, his old one ruined by the large blotted line.
Draco would’ve thought it was funny if he hadn’t been so shaken up by the last few days.
Thanks for reading, sorry it was a bit short! Should have the next chapter out soon!
I had a lot of school stuff going on, sports had started back up again too and it just left me exhausted.
Then Ron was next to him, grabbing Draco’s limp arm and removing the blade from his hand. He grabbed a towel from next to the sink and wrapped Draco’s wrist.
People stared as they walked past, the dried blood on Harry’s shirt sending confusion into the crowds. Whispers followed them like snakes.
“Harry,” He whispered, looking down at his hands. “All of that stuff you said to Hermione, was that true?”
Oh yes, Harry was nervous. He was panicked and shaky, but he couldn’t figure out why.
But that was a lie. He knew exactly why he was like this; Draco Malfoy had fallen asleep on his shoulder.
Sorry about the late update, my friends moved and we were helping plus school so i didn’t have much time to write :/
Also please leave comments/kudos if you are liking this, they give me motivation to write and get the chapters out sooner :D
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked up from his paper. “You don’t know what, Potter? Be more specific.”
Ron nodded and pushed his way through the crowd, now bigger as more and more people had grouped together to see what had happened.
TW for this chapter include throwing up and self-harm, please stay safe while reading, and if you have to skip this chapter that's perfectly ok
“And he fell asleep with you?”
TW/CW: Parental abuse, it is warned before the part in the chapter
(See the end of the chapter for
Thanks a bunch!
Draco let out a small laugh and lifted his head. “Wow, how very sentimental of you, Pans.”
Draco gave a fake smile and made his way back to his room to change.
P.S. did I mention it was angsty? no? oh- whoops. yeah, my writing went a little dark here... good luck!
Draco sat down in one of the plush lounge chairs. “I could ask you the same thing.”
Hermione was walking down to the common room early the next morning so she could get to class early. What she didn't expect to see was the two arch-enemies of Gryffindor and Slytherin sleeping together on the common room couch.
____________________
the TW is in bold before the part in the story
I’m posting this from my phone rn... in school...
Thanks for reading!
Harry sighed and made his way up to change too. Once that was done, he headed to class with Hermione.
Ron placed his hand on Harry’s back. “I don't know.” He whispered back.
Blaise snorted from where he was sitting, causing a pillow to fly into his face. Draco followed suit and threw a pillow at Pansy. The three continued this, leading to a full-on pillow fight.
“Draco. You didn't do anything wrong. It's not your fault that Potter is scared of whatever happened. He's an idiot not to see how great you truly are.”
Draco had been listening to Harry and Hermione’s fighting for weeks now. Ron doesn't know him very well, but he could tell that he was upset by what Harry had to say about him.
Merry Christmas everyone!!!!
___________________
Draco took in what he said and thought for a moment.
His mind raced through all the possibilities of what could have caused this. Was it him? Was it his past? Had he known about his constant fights with Hermione?
Please leave kudos or comments if you liked it and want more!
The two boys glanced at each other and quickly turned away.
"Uh, Are we gonna go in or.." Harry said.
neville: okay so maybe not the best, but it could be worse
neville: ...
pansy: i could ask you the same thing
“This is-“ she paused and took a breath.    “- was” She corrected herself. “my mom’s.” Ginny placed a consoling hand on her back while Pansy gave her an odd look.
neville: i really like him gin i don’t wanna mess it up
neville: yeah he needs help with herbology
blaise: uh thanks u are too
Okay, so maybe he had gone soft. It’s just, he would’ve never thought in a million years that Harry Fucking Potter would be texting him, ever so causally, about a funny text that he had received from his uncles. Then again, he never thought in a million years that Harry Fucking Potter would be his boyfriend.
harry: draco stop
draco: i can guarantee you that he wouldn’t keep responding to ur texts if he hated you
harry: yup.
harry: oh nice of you to join the conversation
harry: k cool
ron: yeah he can’t be all that bad
“Oh, um, this? It’s a Sneezewort. They’re quite beautiful aren’t they?” He turned to Blaise who shook his head in agreement. “They’re poisonous to certain animals, and such. Sometimes they’re used in potion making, but they’re most known for their leaves.” Neville was getting progressively more exited as he explained. “They can be used as a bug repellent! It’s quite amazing that just one plant can have so many different purposes.” He looked up to Blaise as he finished. “Sorry. That was lame.” He looked down at his feet. God he has just ruined the whole date hadn’t he? Why did he have to be such a nerd.
draco: i asked him out
ron: why is harry acting all sad and shit
harry: it was, not the best
“Let. Go.” Seamus struggled against him. “Just stop. You pretending like you like me is worse than you just not liking me.” Dean looked at him confused.
pansy: staying here?
harry: i don’t think ur gonna be too happy with who it is
“Poor thing.” She said through her laughs. He looked at her bewildered. That wasn’t funny. That was his best friend thinking that something as stupid as this would ruin them. No way. Not after everything.
harry: sorry not sorry
-it takes place during 8th year
hermione: why don’t u just both wear grey or something
“Just a bit shaken up.” Draco shoved the remainder of his large wardrobe into the small drawer. “That’s all.” Harry hummed in response and then crawled onto their bed.
harry: andthennevillegotmetounblockhim
pansy: maybe....
blaise: yeah i guess
blaise: anything
draco: surprising well actually
ginny: wait what’s going on

(also i was re-reading the other chapters and damn i’m so sorry for all the typos lolz)
harry: gonna take that as a no
“Hi.” He said innocently. Draco smiled and wrapped his arms around him. Harry nuzzled his face into his chest.
draco: i seriously am sorry though. for everything.
seamus: no
harry: nope
draco: mmm
harry: i hope they are
“I’m in love with Dean Thomas.” He laughed  softly again.
blaise: be careful, u might turn into one
dean: i lied
seamus: yeah we missed you guys so much
harry: so 2 to a room besides one?
blaise: i’m glad someone benefits off of my trauma
draco: oh god never say that again
remus: sirius
ron: heyyyy heyyy how y’all doin’
“You know what? Screw our families.” Draco’s voice cracked. “We don’t even want to be there anyways. Who cares if we got disowned? Were you guys really planning on going back there after school anyways?” He asked his friends who both spoke their head no.
sirius: he’s right
pansy: WHAT
seamus: dean
neville: i DO like him gin
harry: sry i have to i just got in trouble for being on my phone
draco: will do

hermione: harry just go they said they were fine with it
ron: it was truly painful without you
ron: nevermind, mums expanding the house for the weeks, so we have 6 rooms reserved for us
harry: get your heterosexual asses out of this chat
“He didn’t deny it.” Pansy looked up.
draco: i’m not a death eater
neville: so, you wanna give us a shot
harry: say it back
harry: i mean you wanted to do it, i figured i don’t really care what i wear so yeah
pansy: you did too

draco: oh thank god
sirius: shit

harry: i told them on the train
draco: ok thank merlin
No, no, no, no, no. Nope. He couldn’t just ‘talk’ to Dean. Not after what he had just overheard. Nothing would be the same now.
harry: k bye
blaise: well yeah
connor: you? love? for reading? that’s the most ridiculous thing i’ve heard.
harry: i’ll ask her
blaise: he’s still gonna get the best friend talk though
“Dad thought that I wasn’t good enough.” He said.
pansy: ur gonna judge me
draco: oh yeah that’s fine

draco: he doesn’t hate me
seamus: outstanding

“Malfoy huh?” Sirius said. Remus glared at him.
harry: ur cute
hermione: i’m not exactly thrilled considering there was just a war
blaise: i just thought since the others don’t really know yet
harry: ik it was a low blow
ron: weird thing to say to ur platonic soulmate
draco: yes yes we do
draco: see ya
dean: well then maybe try and fill us in
“Babe. You’re not the only one that gets them. They suck. No matter how bad they are.” Draco nodded and took a deep breath. He leaned up and quickly pecked Harry’s lips.
harry: YES YES YES YOU DO
“Um, we haven’t gone over that yet. How the hell do you know that.” Neville questioned him, and Blaise stayed silent.
blaise: noted
blaise: ok ok i’m not gonna ask him if it’s a date but it’s a date
draco: oh shit harry i didn’t mean that
blaise: mkay whatever you say

harry: i. cant. go.
blaise: LEGGO
harry: *screenshot of harry’s rant*
draco: that’s not true
“God no!” Draco looked at his phone to see the time. “Shit. It’s 2 in the morning. We should probably head back.” He started to get up from the ground.
harry: aren’t you in detention rn???
sirius: lunch, my office, tomorrow, 12:30, bring malfoy
pansy: yeah yeah whatever who is it
Draco nodded, unsteadily. His eyes had barely left his own envelope since it arrived. He felt Harry take his hand into his and squeeze it.
hermione: ur going
draco: what happened
blaise: feeling-scared :)
pansy: then what?
pansy: you guys totally just texted each other gn didn’t you?
draco: i cant lose him

neville: guys
draco: right
harry: agreed
draco: can u meet me in the restricted section
ron: ????
harry: can u meet me at the astronomy tower?
Harry took a second to think, and he started. “Do you ever think that someone’s evil, but they might not be?” Ron laughed.
“Uh, hey.” Blaise said to Neville who was focused on some weird type of plant at the moment. He jumped and turned to Blaise in surprise.
neville: i know, i’m just sorry that it’s the way things are
draco: i don’t think that i wanna forget it either
draco: ok
sirius: YOU PUT KIDS IN DETENTION FOR TRYING TO PRANK SNIVELLUS
blaise: damn okay
ron: no. no. no. harry i cant believe it. u-u were mean.
draco: also a better reaction than i expected considering hermione was literally tortured by my aunt
(See the end of the chapter for
remus: thank you
harry: hello i have something to say that ron and hermione already know
blaise: sure ya can
seamus: it’s ridiculous
neville: good
“Oh shut up Pans...” Draco looked up from his phone and over to where Harry was sitting with Neville and Hermione. Harry was laughing. Probably at one of Neville’s stupid jokes. Their eyes met, and Draco’s smile grew even wider. Merlin, what was happening to him?
ginny: oh god neville u went to seamus? and dean? jesus christ alright what’s up
remus: expelliarmus.....
blaise: i finished that ages ago
pansy: how are we supposed to drumroll over text
harry: well i didn’t go to the bathroom expecting to kiss malfoy
sirius: he’s dangerous harry
dean: go on
“Don’t say that.”
“Password.” Seamus didn’t remember saying the password, but the door swung open, and he stumbled up the stairs to the boy’s dormitory and locked himself in. Maybe he couldn’t forget his problems, but he could sure as hell hide from them.
blaise: MASS MURDERERS????
ron: yup yeah of course we are harry
blaise: no no no
“Okay.”
harry: he’s wrong
harry: cut me some slack
blaise: *screenshot*
harry: i’ll fight them for u
ron: nope
“God. I’m so pathetic. It wasn’t even that bad. I mean, I’ve had worse.” Harry smiled at Draco and shook his head.
blaise: FINALLY
harry: ^^^^
neville: i’ll try my best
harry: ugh stop being so cute
“What? It’s not like actually like him back or anything.” She spat out.
remus: he’s just hurting because of what you said earlier i’m sure if we talked it out we could figure things out
“Sorry.” He mumbled. “Anyways what’s going on dude? You can talk to us ya’ know.”
draco: promise
neville: oh okay, that’s okay
"Well, yeah. Oh, uh, Blaise here told me that he isn't very good at your class, so I figured that this might teach him something." Blaise looked over to Neville in mock offense.
draco: and the award for the most awkward conversation goes too....
draco: rude, but true
harry: do what?
hermione: told you so
ron: says the one who’s still single
pansy: SHIT HES TYPING AGAIN
pansy: you pick on the people u like
draco: she doesn’t need to know that
harry: well yeah but it wasn’t official
blaise: fr draco never shuts up about you
harry: yeah i uh think they have like the heat on or something
draco: oh yeah definitely a ball is just what i need to forgot about my emotional trauma
harry: i think i’m gonna tell sirius and remus i feel bad for lying

pansy: oh this is hilarious

dean: hermione convinced you to do this, don’t lie to urself won won
pansy: no yeah we believe you
blaise: *actually just passes away*
draco: why not???
"No." Sirius cut him off. "I've already heard what you have to say. I'd like to hear it from Draco." Draco's head snapped up.
draco: ugh idk i just didn’t wanna rush into things
ron: good just write ur parents make sure they know
draco: where are you right now?
hermione: give it some time to set in, sirius has some thinking to do
draco: can’t say i do
draco: grey?

“Everyone’s staring.” Draco whispered to Harry.
pansy: sirius and remus?
harry: PRAISE RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY
neville: i’m sure luna will be happy to have someone to go with
neville: so special treatment
draco: not that weasley the other one
hermione: they’re just mad cause u called them out

pansy: awwww young love
harry: great okay i’m gonna go tell my friends now
hermione: why are you blushing so much???
draco: i feel like they’re forming some sort of cult
“Yup.” Harry said with a pop on the p. He was waiting for them to say something else, but they didn’t. They just sat there in an awkward silence, so Harry took it upon himself to break it.
seamus: why not???
(See the end of the chapter for
draco: i’m gonna assume that everything went well blaise
okay so this basically just the run down of this fic
draco: mhm.

draco: okay just checking
(See the end of the chapter for
remus: yeah okay
“Yeah, and we’ve got Muggle History on Wednesdays.” Draco nodded.
The Dementor looms over him, pulling out wisps of his joy. Quidditch. Laughing to the point of tears over late-night rounds of Exploding Snap. Hedwig, who'd died because of him. Dobby, who'd died because of him. Remus and Sirius, who'd died because of him. His parents, who'd died because of him.
exhausted and guilt-wracked, driven by the sort of single-minded obsession that his friends would've pushed him to seek professional help for if he hadn't hidden it with fierce, stubborn determination.
The room swallows Harry's sharp inhalation, the sound dull and muffled in spite of the cavernous space and the open door to the corridor outside. Harry looks down at his own chest, breathing harshly as he stares at the soft blue light hanging below his collarbone.
Fear, at last. "You don't have to. You can go. It's—it's alright, you'll be—you can rest." Tears blur his vision; he doesn't blink them away. "Or—or I can take you home. To your mum. I can put you back in your body, I can fix this, I—"
before Harry can try again, and by then it'll be too late—
Small spheres of light hover in the space where the Dementor had been, some little more than faint, flickering wisps in the inky black. They begin to disperse, fading one by one into nothingness, while Harry stares, panting and sprawled upside-down on the steps.
"He can't fucking
"Er, hey," Harry says eloquently. By some miracle it comes out fairly quiet, which means his ability to operate on instinct must not be affected by the white noise building in his brain over the way his boyfriend’s biceps fill out their sleeves while he cradles Harry's
," he whispers, voice cracking in the cold. The orb-light barely seems to slice through the darkness as it rises, flickering briefly on the walls as it ascends toward the ceiling. Padlocked metal doors cover the walls all the way to the top: a living crypt, ten levels or more, of a thousand Dementors, burrowed into the walls like honeycomb in a malevolent hive.
has taken up precious real estate in Harry's chest that otherwise might have been used by his lungs. Maybe that's why he feels vaguely light-headed.
been worse than Peeves, haunting Harry's nightmares with a rictus of fear on an ash-white face—
The pendant starts to glow.
This wasn't supposed to happen. The blade won't work if his patronus chases the Dementor halfway to London, and chances are absolute shit that Harry will find it again before someone else, and then someone from the Magical Creatures department or the Unspeakables or whatever fucked-up branch of the Ministry handles Dementors these days will return to the facility and discover the professionally-dissolved wards and the open cell—
On his own terms. On his feet.
this. The Ministry had taken the soul out of a teenage boy, and Harry had let them do it.
, sealing the space off behind a shield of silence and disinterest. They both deserve a few moments before their lives erupt into chaos. An hour, perhaps two, before Harry teaches the Ministry what happens when the only thing the Saviour of the Wizarding World is holding back is the urge to start a fire. He won't play by their rules, not anymore.
In Harry's dreams, just as in his memories, he recalls one detail about Malfoy's final minutes more clearly than the rest.
and Harry wants it back so fiercely that no terrible memory can overpower the feeling surging through him.
Harry can hardly breathe as he watches each experimental shift in the muscles of Malfoy's face, the twitching curl of his fingers: every movement like lights in a house turning on, one by one, illuminating rooms Harry had thought would remain dark forever.
Pulling himself up straight, he cuts the spell.
When the tea's ready, Harry heads into the living room. He casts a stasis charm on one cup, leaving it on the end table where Draco will see it, and then settles on the sofa and waits for Draco to make his way back across the room.
In the morning Harry owls Bill, asking to meet about becoming a cursebreaker, and leaves Grimmauld Place for the first time in two months.
This knowledge that Draco and Teddy are related and might actually have cause to spend time together does nothing— not a damned thing — to prepare Harry for wandering into Andromeda's living room and finding it occupied by Draco, pacing sedately by the large windows overlooking the backyard, with a curly blue head resting against his slender shoulder and a small arm slung over his back.
"He might wake up," Draco warns, but Harry only sidles beside Draco and slips his right arm between Teddy and Draco's chest, gently hooking the boy toward him, his other arm replacing Draco's to support Teddy from beneath. Teddy makes a small noise and then settles against Harry, as if all he's done is roll over in his sleep, and Harry grins wryly.
A darkness starts to gather around the edges of the door, small questing tendrils poking out along the hinges. Another minute, and he won't be able to reseal it. This is it.
sirius: well harry won’t tell anyone right harry?
blaise: nev
ginny: ask luna idk
pansy: NOPE MY SHIP HAS SAILED
harry: you coming to breakfast?
harry: overall, i’m a very bad bf and really mean and i should’ve listened to draco

harry: dray i didn’t mean what i said okay i promise. i was just pissed off.
sirius: how are ur friends doing?
luna: see ya!
seamus: dean
“What?” Ron asked now that he had finally finished chewing. Harry was clearly trying to hide his laughter. He was also clearly failing miserably. “Oh, buzz off Harry.” Ron rolled his eyes and smiled a bit. It was nice. The atmosphere, but that wouldn’t last very long.
blaise: right uh anyways what are u up to
harry: hey guys
seamus: come on i’m stuck on number 6 please just one hint
remus: oh yes
harry: i’m smiling a lot rn but u just can’t see me
harry: because i like you????
ron: anyways i’m pretty sure ginny likes luna
hermione: what’s wrong harry?
harry: what do you mean
draco: SHUT UP
“Go. Away.” Seamus blubbered out. He heard Dean sigh.
pansy: really what?
remus: yes we do.
“Don’t mind if I do.” Well, shit. Here we go I guess.
remus: yeah he is
ginny: well then you should be fine
luna: i haven’t
hermione: he’s definitely going to see malfoy
“You’ll make an excellent Healer.”
“When I leave...we’ll still be friends, Harry. We’ll write to each other and visit if we can.”
“What are you suggestable to, Mr. Potter?” Draco raised an eyebrow and for the first time, Harry allowed himself to acknowledge that Draco was rather attractive. His face was a bit gaunter than it had been at the start of Year 6 but there was light in his eyes. His eyes sparkled with mirth and a little mischief. And Harry thought that if he had just taken Draco’s hand seven years ago, they would have put Snape and McGonagall in early graves. He tried to ignore the stab of regret. Both at the lost years of their youth and at Snape.
“What makes you say that?”
“Don’t worry about it.” Malfoy shrugged. “I suppose he brought it upon himself.”
Draco was watching too and when he looked up at Harry, he gave him a filthy grin. He leaned down and bit and sucked on Harry’s collarbone. There would definitely be marks and bruises when they were done. They wouldn’t stand out as much on him as they would on say, Draco. It was the idea of marking up Draco and the twist of his wrist that sent Harry over the edge with a shout. Harry closed his eyes and tried to catch his breath. He felt Draco’s uneven breathing against his collarbone.
“The dingy old sack was right about that at least. So then why Gryffindor?”
“My help?” Malfoy frowned. “Ah. Right. Well, don’t fall all over yourself about it, Potter. I couldn’t be sure it was you, after all.” He brushed dirt and ashes off of his robes. “And after the unfortunate incident in the Room of Requirement, I think we should consider us even.”
“I agree about not shagging on the floor. It’s pretty uncomfortable. And Snape’s old classroom is not where I imagined having my first shag.” Harry sighed. “But I think they owe me some peace and quiet.”
“A few hours.” Hermione closed her book and set it aside. “We thought it was best to let you get some rest.”
“Why would you ever think that?”
“Sorry, mate. Maybe tomorrow.” Charlie clapped him on the shoulder and stood up. He gave his sister a grin as they passed.
“I never had any concept of what love was like. Familial or otherwise. I saw how Aunt Petunia treated Dudley. When I was little, I tried to get them to love me. At about five, I stopped bothering. For a long time, I wondered why. What had I done wrong? Why didn’t they love me? But then I just got pissed. And started pushing back instead. Uncle Vernon hated it. He hated when I talked back. And he told me to never ask questions. That drove him crazy.
“Most definitely.” Draco sat up and shuffled back to Harry’s thighs. With his free hand, he tugged Harry’s pyjama bottoms and pants down to free his cock. Harry gasped as cool air caressed his hot skin. “Merlin, the things I want to do to you...”
“We are not going to shag on the floor of a dusty classroom with a Great Hall full of people that have surely noticed that you are missing and are looking for you.”
“You don’t say.”
“It makes more sense that people just want something from me than they genuinely care about me.” Harry tried to keep hold of the pillow but Draco wrestled it from him.
“Gee, thanks.” Harry sighed but before he could pull his shirt down all the way, Draco was there. He ran those damn slender hands over his sides.
“Neither is how you look when you wake up, but here we are.”
“Fuck off, Ron.” Harry pushed passed him to climb further into the castle and get the fuck out of there. He rushed up the stairs, taking them two at a time. His mind was racing and he couldn’t make it stop. Away. He just had to get away. His feet carried him without his mind having to give them any direction.
“...Not that I know of. Still, shouldn’t you be with the Weasley’s?”
“Well...” Malfoy cleared his throat. “Looks like you owe me again then, Potter.”
“I suppose you and I had the same idea.” Malfoy shrugged and brushed past Harry into the classroom. The only light was the dim glow of the torches in the hall.
“All evidence points to the contrary, darling.” Draco smirked against his lips and brought them together once more. “Come on. Let’s get you up to dinner. I don’t think you’ve eaten anything today.”
“You really think you can keep us out of prison?”
“You know, where the family member or best friend tells the prospective partner that if they ever hurt you then we’ll kill them sort of thing?”
“A horcrux? You bloody idiots were trying to destroy a horcrux?”
“When I tell you about what it felt like to live with the Dark Lord and how he used the threat of Greyback against us all, am I burdening you?”
“Just what are you saying? That because we are all trying to move on, we can’t help each other?”
“Honestly, mate, I think everyone in our dorm would have tried to murder you.”
“How did you know to do that?”
“No. I mean, not really.”
“No. We have time.” Harry closed his eyes and sighed. “Maybe I’ll travel. Never been out of the country. Or really anywhere interesting.”
What truly surprised Harry was how comfortable it felt. He had always thought of Draco as cold. But he was so warm. And the press of his side against Harry had calmed him. He didn’t want to leave. He wanted to stay here with Draco for as long as was humanly possible. So until someone noticed that Harry was missing. And managed to find him.
“Thank you.” Draco nudged Harry’s shoulder. “Would you eat something please?” He hissed the last part under his breath but Harry saw the look on Molly’s face that said she had heard him.
“Really?”
“Yep.” Harry snuggled closer to Draco. “I did spend an awful lot of time in bed thinking about you.” He turned his head in an attempt to see Draco’s face.
“Do you know, I have no idea.” Harry admitted before he leaned down and caught his lips in a passionate kiss. He knew how to do this. They’d been doing this for a couple weeks now. And he absolutely loved the feel of Draco’s lips against his own. Soft but hard, gentle but unyielding. He tasted like blackberry jam. Harry moved down to kiss along his jaw, down his neck. He bit and sucked on the side of Draco’s neck and was rewarded with a groan of satisfaction.
“Why is Charlie arguing?” Both Draco and Hermione stared at him for a moment. “Oh. Right. Hermione, did I tell you that I talked with Dumbledore’s portrait a few nights ago?”
“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” Draco looked at Harry for guidance.
“Is that so?” Draco raised up on his elbow and looked down at Harry. Huh. Well. This was...new. Only a year ago, this position would have made his blood run cold. That was decidedly not what was happening now. Harry felt his face heat up and hoped that it wasn’t noticeable in the dim light of the room.
Malfoy took big and exaggerated breaths. In through the nose and out through the mouth. Harry watched his shoulders rise and fall. He felt Malfoy’s breath on his face. Breathe. He could do that. Right? He took a breath when Malfoy did. It wasn’t as big or as deep but it was a breath. Harry managed to hold it in before he breathed out in sync with Malfoy.
Malfoy sucks in a shuddering breath as if surfacing from deep underwater.
Somewhere near the bottom—Harry hadn't bothered counting floors—his thoughts rise to a frenzied fever pitch and he finds himself gasping for air, struggling painfully to keep breathing through lungs that feel stuffed with cotton. He falters at the top of the next flight of stairs, gasping, eyes stinging with the urge to cry. No matter how fast he runs, there's no outrunning how hopelessly he's fucked this up. He slides down to a crouch against the wall, his head bowed between his knees.
The Dementor leans over Harry's upturned face, sucking at his soul, tugging it loose, but Harry holds onto himself, digging into a place deep inside.
It doesn't sound any different out here than it does when he's in the house.
Harry returns the pendant to its home around his neck, comforted by its reassuring warmth, and surveys the door's padlock. The wards that wrap around the lock, as well as the ones covering the door, need to be disassembled.
He can't let it leave the building.
And it has been, Harry thinks. Ron and Hermione have Rose now, promising careers, lives that have nothing to do with the war. They've moved on and left it behind, and the miserable path Harry's found himself on isn't theirs to follow.
Harry tries to say, but his throat is raw. Forcing himself up in an awkward scramble, he yanks the pendant off his neck in a shaky panic and thrusts it into the air in front of him.
There isn't much to visit with: just the blank shell of Malfoy's body posed in its soft chair, loose and nerveless as a rag doll. His pale head has been positioned to stare at a painting on the wall: a stately lawn sloping down to a neat garden, and beyond that a broad expanse of field and forest lit by a hesitant spring dawn. It looks and acts like a window, letting in light and showing real weather. It must have cost Narcissa a small fortune.
, Hermione tells him during a Floo call.
Time to end it, then.
Harry had testified at his trial out of a sense of civic duty, and so had Ron and Hermione. But Ron and Hermione hadn't assumed their fame would be enough to sway the outcome of a sham trial. They hadn't witnessed the last five minutes Malfoy's soul had spent in his body from behind the safety of an observation shield. They hadn't watched, revolted and sick to their stomach, as a Dementor stooped over Malfoy and made his struggling limbs go limp like a puppet with its strings cut. They hadn't stood three meters away and allowed it to happen.
as it is, with moments like this.
"You can't just call a fucking baby a wanker, Draco," Harry says, amused.
Some mornings, he wakes with a dry mouth and a pounding heart and stumbles into the bathroom with dread, afraid of what he'll see when he looks in the mirror.
Harry stumbles back into the rail as the Dementor turns its hooded face in his direction with a rattling hiss: it seems to stare
Wordlessly, Harry retreats into the fresh green-walled kitchen and starts the mechanical act of making tea, waving his wand at the kettle and absentmindedly taking out two mugs from the golden-paneled cabinet. Something warm and
He considers going up another level, just to be sure, and quickly dismisses the idea. His intuition has kept him alive and moving forward more times than he can count, and right now it tells him Malfoy's here. Somewhere close.
Harry kneels in front of him. Malfoy's eyes look strangely glassy; he's forgotten how to blink, and a protective spell coats them in a moisturizing film. A thin line of drool runs down one side of his partly-open mouth. He doesn't react as Harry—pushing up one of his own dirty coat sleeves—uses the cleaner hem of his undershirt to wipe it away.
Harry sets his wand down on the cool stone floor. His lungs are still tight as he forces himself up and tugs the knife free from its sheath.
As Harry moves slowly around the second level and onto the third, the pendant begins to brighten and reveal details in the path ahead. Rust, the color of old blood, spreads down the railing and leaks across the stone walkway, forming dark puddles half-crusted with slippery ice.
neville: absolutely adorable
draco: i’m sitting next to u
“Good.” Blaise kissed his cheek and sat down next to him.
"Well that went well." He said to Draco.
harry: he was never really evil i don’t think, his dad forced him to do a bunch of it
seamus: fr

harry: he was manipulated by his father. what about that aren’t you getting. he thought that if he didn’t do what voldemort said he would die, and he was right. there’s is no doubt about it. voldemort was ruthless. he wouldn’t have hesitated to kill him. despite that draco still didn’t kill dumbledore, he still didn’t rat me out when we were in malfoy manor, and he still took care of luna while she was there. he’s not fucking evil. he knows that what he did was wrong and he’s trying to make things better, so shut up already jesus christ. you know what he said to me today? i’m sorry i’m tearing your family apart. he thinks that he’s the problem when he’s not. it’s you and you’re grudge holding little ass that can’t forgive people. get the stick out of your sirius.
harry: woah i didn’t know that this was harry interrogation hour
harry: your AUNT not YOU
remus: i could kill u in ur sleep
“Well, first off it’s called Gurdyroot. Not, um, whatever it is that you said.” Blaise looked at him.
neville: ur cute ya know that?
“No, but-“ Neville grunted as he threw his trunk back up above them. “I have proof.” He held up a book, turned to a page, handed it to Blaise, and pointed at a paragraph. “Read that.” Blaise looked at him and then sighed and cleared his throat.
remus: i know but he usually does tell us everything
neville: draco? as in the same draco that bullied u for ur entire time at hogwarts
blaise: i’m never gonna hear the end of this am i?
hermione: no

ginny: on the train hermione
dean: and?
pansy: i’ve talked to her like twice she’d ruin the vibe
pansy: cause i sure as hell am not going home
“Uh, sorry.” Blaise said as a blush grew on his face. Neville giggled bit and Blaise’s stomach did a flip. “What’s that?” Blaise motioned to the plant that Neville was just looking at. Neville’s eyes widened.
hermione: we’re in class
blaise: it’s quite enjoyable listening mcgonagall announce something to the whole school that you already knew
harry: u really think so?
remus: sirius he has a boyfriend u idiot
hermione: yes ronald i’ll go with u

“He’s just mad and confused. He’ll come around.” Blaise assured him.

harry: guyssssss
harry: wdym
ginny: well it’s obviously something
ron: ...yeah
harry: it’s what she knows
seamus: ha we said the same thing that’s funny
“Just, everything he says is bullshit. Alright?” Blaise spoke up. Everyone else at the table had been uncharacteristically quiet. They had never really heard the Slytherins howlers before. They had always been opened in the safety of their dorm room.
Both of them still had tears in their eyes, trailing down their faces. But now they were smiling.

Everything led back to him. He should have been there for Draco, Shouldn't have been pushing him away for his own selfish reasons.
When they left the parlor, the tattoo was wrapped in plastic. Draco looked pleased with the new design.
If the writing changes that's why XD
All Harry could think about was Draco's face is the firelight, the shape of his sharp, but soft jawline, his eyelashes brushing against his soft pale cheek, his platinum blonde hair swooping around his ears. Just thinking about the boy made Harry flush. What the bloody hell was wrong with him?
I predict there to be about three chapters left!
“Why’s he hugging him… and crying?”
He wouldn't show up to classes either.
Draco smiled and sat in the chair across from him. Setting down his books he asked Harry, “Why do you study so late?”
Welcome back! Hope you all enjoy the new chapter!!
sorry for the cliffhanger and short chapter!
“Ron and Harry helping Malfoy?”
“Draco?” Harry asked. “How do you feel about getting the mark covered up with a different tattoo?”
Harry let out a soft chuckle. “Good question.” He mumbled.
(This is also on Wattpad under fenway_cp if you prefer that)
Harry pulled himself off of Draco, his shirt was wet with blood. He scooped Draco into his arms, carefully protecting the arm he had cut. Draco’s head lulled into Harry’s shoulder and stayed there. He stood slowly and looked at Ron.
“Draco, I’m so sorry.” He spoke softly, one hand traveling from his hair down to his cheek.
please be careful while reading, stay safe <3
“When did you get all of this stuff?” Harry said rooting through the bag.
They sat in Harry’s bed, Draco’s wrist in Harry’s hands, admiring the art on Draco’s skin.

As it happens, the next chapter plan is Christmas, so I'll try to post around the 24th/25th! See you guys then!
Anyway, enough about me, enjoy the chapter!
After a few minutes of listening to Harry's soft snores, Draco lays his head back too.
Harry was startled by the new headmasters’ voice booming over the crowd. Harry hadn’t bothered to learn his name.
They went the whole day avoiding each other. Harry stuck with Ron and Hermione, using them as shields while Draco sulked around the school with Pansy and Blaise.
Hogwarts had given the seventh years another chance for their NEWTS, but they had to take the year over again. He was sitting with Ron and Hermione, but no one was talking. They all knew that the school year would be stressful and sad. Walking off the train onto the Hogwarts ground was a painful thing to do.
“Okay, yeah. Sure.” He said, looking at Harry.
Harry thought.
___________________
They went on studying like normal until they were both too tired to study anymore.
That night was a night when Harry would usually study. Draco walked down to the common room and waited for Harry. After an hour of waiting, he realized Harry wouldn’t be studying with him tonight.
Draco tensed and went back to work, asking the occasional question here and there.
so, aha, it's been about 4 months.. so sorry about that.
(comments and kudos are very much appreciated <3 bookmark/sub to work for updates and future chapters!)
Hope you liked it! The next chapter may not be out for a while, the end of the month is super packed with trips for me.
He sat down at the Gryffindor table, which had been enlarged due to the new situation, and watched the sorting.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, Potter. Hello.” Draco said calmly.
“Then what are you still doing here?” Harry said.
The tattoo that Draco chose surprised Harry. The design was full of color.
Hey guys, sorry for a late update, I’ve just been pretty unmotivated to write.
“Hello, students of new and old! We have one more announcement for today.” The headmaster said. “The eighth year students will not be in their old dorms as there is not enough space.” A collective murmur grew from the four tables.
Harry noticed Draco’s staring and the look on his face and frowned. He wanted to help, he wanted to take that look off of Draco’s face. He wanted to make the other boy smile and laugh. He wanted to make him happy.
“Infirmary, lead the way.” He spoke shortly.
Draco stayed silent for a moment, remembering what Harry had been arguing about just a few days prior.
Thanks for reading!! Comments and kudos are very much appreciated! :)
I marked in the chapter where the TW starts and where it picks back up
“I know, it’s only November, this weather is stupid!” Harry said, letting his eyes scan across the room. “We could move to the fireplace?” Harry suggested.
Harry sat next to Draco, so close their arms were touching.
Love you all, thanks a bunch!!
Draco blinked up at him, confused for a moment before it all came rushing back to him.
The sight before them was not one they’d ever wanted to see.
After a while, they broke apart, both of them rubbing the tears away.
Harry looked up from the notes he was copying and shook his head. “I don't know, ‘Moine. Just haven't been feeling up for it I guess.”
love you all, thanks for reading!
Draco looked skeptical, but he would do anything to cover up the damned snake.
Ron put a hand on his friend's shoulder, stopping him. Magic was probably not a good idea with Harry’s mindset right now.
Pansy moved away, pushing Draco to the floor. Blaise stood and sat down with the other two.
Well, heres to the end of 2020!
“Oh, it’s fine. You don’t have to tell me.” Draco tells Harry, his voice just over a whisper.
Except Harry doesn’t get anything done. He wants to tell Draco why he studies so late, he just can’t find the right words.
Happy freaking new year!!
I'll try to keep chapter updates on a schedule during the summer, most likely every other week.
“What?”
“Wand…” Harry muttered.
They sat in the hallway outside the infirmary, legs curled up to their chests. With the silence in the hallway, they finally had time to think.
But of course, Harry was oblivious to those feelings.
“Alohomora,” Ron said as he flicked his wand towards the door handle. Harry pushed the door open and froze.
After the first week of living together, the two wizards started noticing things about each other.
Thank you all for reading! Comment or leave kudos if you liked the chapter and want more!
Harry took his first step into the school that he had called home so many times. Letting out a breath he walked into the Great Hall with the rest of the eighth year students.
Harry stopped caring about living with Draco and the other Slytherins and started to focus on school for once.
Harry nodded and accepted the hand Ron had offered. He stood slowly and glanced at the infirmary doors, silently promising to be back later.
Harry turned to face Draco. Their faces inches away.
“The year started so great, we became friends and I loved hanging out with you, but then we kissed, I kissed you, and it brought a lot of confusion and a lot to think about, you know. And I started distancing myself from you, which I know now was the completely wrong thing to do. I should've just talked to you, I’m sorry I didn’t.”
Ron swallowed and steadied his own breath. “It’ll be okay, Harry, we’ve just gotta get in there and help him.”
BEFORE YOU START: TW/CW of offensive language (the f slur I’m sorry) and mature content (but nothing too bad idk how to write that... yet)
Harry’s hand cupped Draco’s cheek as he pleaded with him. He could faintly hear Ron behind him, telling someone to go get Madam Pomfrey.
He was heartbroken, it wasn’t hard to tell.
Harry nodded his response and continued working. The two boys hadn’t talked in a while. Harry didn't know why, but he made no move to fix the situation.
“Help me!” Draco groaned, plopping himself down on Pansy’s bed.
But I'm back now as things start to slow down again. I have two more weeks left of school and then I'm free!
TW for self-harm, please be safe while you read.
Harry noticed how hard Draco worked to get good grades and how stressed he got when there was an assignment due soon.
Hello, thanks for reading!

Hello readers! I hope you have enjoyed the chapters so far :)
I might work on some one shots or short stories in the meantime, so look out for those if you’d like.
Back in the dorms, Harry carefully unwrapped the plastic and healed the tattoo with magic.
Draco's head dropped into his hands and Blaise placed a comforting hand on his back. Pansy stood and moved to crouch in front of Draco.
This time, Ron didn’t have an answer. Truth is, he had been thinking the same thing.
((ALSO I posted the art of the tattoo on my Twitter, @ fenwaycp , if ya'll want to see it!))
That weekend, Harry and Draco got permission to leave the grounds and go into muggle London.
He pulls a blanket over them and lays his head on top of Harry's.
Harry gets to his class and sits next to Ron. Draco walks in a few minutes later.
Harry led Draco to the tattoo parlor and went over designs with a tattoo artist. Draco settled on one that partially covered up the mark.
Every Friday night, Draco would bring down snacks with him while they studied. Harry would grab blankets and they would sit together on one of the common room couches and study.
Madame Pomfrey arrived not long after Draco woke up. She did a final check-through of Draco, fussing over his wrists and making Harry give him some space to rest.
Draco turned on his heels and went into the boys’ dorms.
I'll try to keep updates on a 2-week basis, but summer is very busy for me with all of the trips planned!
Harry cut him off. “No, no Draco. I should’ve been here for you, I shouldn’t have pushed myself away from you for my own selfish reasons and left you to deal with this shit alone. I’m so sorry.”
Happy New Years!!
“Okay. Communication.”
Draco was huddled in the corner of the bathroom next to the sink. One of his arms was extended over his knee, in his hands was a blade, now covered in red. His other arm was tucked close to his chest. Blood soaked his clothes. His head was leaning back against the wall, his eyes closed.

“I-“ He started, but it broke off into a sob. Draco turned to him in surprise, and wrapped his arms around him. Harry sobbed onto Draco’s shoulder. Draco was trying to comfort him by rubbing his back. He wasn’t really sure what to do.
draco: you can’t make me pay you for talking about my boyfriend
hope you enjoyed the first chapter!
“Draco Lucius Malfoy. Get you and you’re friends’ asses over her right this instant.” Lucius. Shit.
harry: sorry love
blaise: DUDE BEING EXTRA KINDA COMES WITH BEING GAY, I MEAN JUST LOOK AT DRACO
draco: that’s a new one
harry: i don’t wannaaaaaa
remus: alright to answer your question no we can’t get u onto the train early
seamus: we’re adorable let’s move on
harry: wtf
harry: what’s wrong sorry i was sleeping
hermione: see you guys
“What? Sorry.” He said as he started listening to her repeat what she had just said. He never got a chance to send another text, and he left a very confused Blaise behind.
ron: mate, they are like the most supportive people that i know
ginny: right outside the ballroom
neville: well yeah but i don’t know if he wants that
ron: gross
neville: okay yeah but idc that ur a slytherin and shit
blaise: neville
seamus: OKAY OKAY YES IM HAPPY UR HAPPY NOW WHAT DID U DO AFTER I LEFT
neville: she’ll get me a present or two but other than that we just kinda sit around the house
blaise: keep giving us super secret teacher information
harry: alright prepare yourselves
harry: there will be no killing needed
seamus: aw the git has feelings
draco: nothing why
harry: *screenshot of sirius’ text*
dean: yeah seamus i’m sure that makes him feel 1000 times better
blaise: our first study session is on wednesday after classes
harry: i know
draco: good i think
theo: just thought you might want to know what ur boyfriend is actually up to
neville: oh yeah that makes more sense
ginny: we don’t need a stupid chart hermione
draco: ok....
harry: nothingggg
draco: AHHHH
neville: hey are u awake
draco: tired?
draco: uGH
blaise: U DO REALIZE THAT U ARE DATING SOMEONE WHO IS BOTH EXTRA AND SNARKY RIGHT?
“Shut up.” He looked her up and down. She was wearing a simple black lace dress and some black accent rings. She had darker makeup, and solid black lipstick on. Seamus thought that Pansy was probably the only person that could pull that off. “You look-“ He hesitated. “-good.” Well, Pansy actually looked quite amused.
draco: i mean, like u said earlier, that 7th year in my house seems to have her eye on me...
harry: babe
harry: it was just kinda warm in the bathroom you know
harry: i’ll be there don’t you worry ur pretty little ass
ron: not the slytherin colors...
harry: okay i’ll see you at twelve at the astronomy tower
“Seamus you blithering idiot. This isn’t gonna make me hate you.” Dean said as he struggled to keep Seamus in his arms. For such a tiny guy, he was pretty strong. “You’ve been my best friend since the first year, I could never hate you.” Seamus then gave up and stopped struggling.
harry: *attachment of draco flying off his broom when he was in second year*
draco: well i feel like shit now
“Don’t point over there Gin!” He whispered harshly. Ginny’s eyes widened and she looked back at the table to see Blaise looking at them. She looked back to Neville and groaned.
sirius: tut tut
draco: have you even asked your mum yet ron? i mean, malfoys don’t really have a good track record when it comes to the weasleys
dean: we will?
draco: harry what are you doing?
hermione: WE ARE DOING HOMEWORK
blaise: okay i’ll be right over sweetcheeks
“Hi.” Draco said softly, but it still made Harry jump.
dean: it’s not ridiculous if it’s bothering you
seamus: so harry
harry: something along the lines of i’m not breaking up with draco so either accept that or figure it out
harry: yeah
*harry has unblocked draco*
draco: no no no then we’ll clash, we’ll look like christmas babe, christmas.
connor: yup.
neville: like u didn’t have to ask me i was gonna go either way
neville: hey gin
neville: maybe
draco: i don’t wanna see potter
harry: i mean ur brilliant
“No.” Draco shook his head as tears formed in his eyes. “No, I need a minute.”
harry: hypothetically, if i failed a dada test, what would you do?
They sat, taking turns taking sips out of the bottle.
neville: cool
"Just like that?"
pansy: dibs on the one
harry: cedric dying and voldemort returning during the last one???
blaise: i just expect it to be really bad
ron: she’s so annoying
seamus: sure whatever idiot
remus: i don’t even know
“Exactly.” Pansy said as she shoved some pumpkin pasty into her mouth.
hermione: not if he hurts harry
sirius: yup.
neville: ginny come on
harry: that doesn’t matter
ron: yup.
draco: morning
pansy: i’m somewhat okay now
harry: yeah
harry: yeah cant say i saw that one coming but
draco: blaise
seamus: meanies
draco: yeah......
draco: harry
“Yup. He probably did the thing that all those muggles do. You know? Editing, or whatever.” Harry nodded in agreement. Well, that was settled, so why did Harry still feel like crying? Oh no. He was gonna start crying wasn’t he? Yup. Oh, Merlin he was crying.
dean: star wars?
dean: please i just wanna talk
neville: oh yeah, guess i should start out with that, i'm gay
seamus: okay that’s fine
draco: absolutely not
hermione: “due to the events of last year, we have decided that there won’t be as much separation between houses. you will still sleep in your dorm rooms and have classes with your house, but things such as trips to hogsmead will be separated by year instead of house. you will also be able to sit wherever you wish during meals.”
pansy: draco ur being oddly quite
draco: ur the best
draco: and this is important
draco: harry was really excited
“Sirius for the love of God.” Remus sighed and he pulled Sirius’ waving hand down. “Leave the poor kid alone.”
draco: okay and???
remus: i’m prepared
-not all characters are tagged i got lazy lmao
blaise: no???
sirius: see you at twelve
harry: ok thanks guys
harry: no no no we’re just friends i am very much still more into boys
draco: pls wake up
ron: malfoy
(See the end of the chapter for
draco: chill?
remus: or ya know, we could always do it the harry way and just expelliarmus him
pansy: i cant say it
harry: bitch
“Yeah. Ya’ do.” Just after she said that, Neville’s phone went off.
harry: i was
harry: very sorry but i can’t do that
(See the end of the chapter for
seamus: i mean yeah
remus: he was smiling too much
ginny: whatever just come over here neville plsssss
ron: mione what’d she say?
“Why was he in such a rush?” Neville said as he looked after Harry. “And why is he going to the forbidden section?”
harry: of course i dont
neville: yeah i guess
ron: okay but you have to admit, it was very creepy for krum to take u
pansy: didn’t wanna wake up blaise
harry: yeah, it just felt wrong lying
harry: i’m getting there hold ur horses seamus
-WOLFSTAR IS A THING CAUSE YES
“Oh absolutely not.”
“And how did Sirius take it?” She asked.
draco: yeah like we can go in separately
harry: night babe see u tomorrow
ginny: we’ll figure it out when we get on the train
pansy: no he’s a seventh year
blaise: hehe
“Alright. Alright, so I may have gotten the name wrong, but I know what it does.” He insisted.
blaise: shit
blaise: i do not
connor: only if ur feeling up to it
“Oh darling....” Draco started towards Harry, but Harry held his hand up and Draco stopped in his tracks.
hermione: text us back when u can
blaise: what’s shakin’ bacon
pansy: so why aren’t you slow dancing with your totally hot date
remus: rude
harry: no one helped me
draco: i mean pansy and i knew too
harry: ok?
ginny: ur dating blaise?
draco: well i was going to try and match ur eyes but if u don’t wanna...
pansy: ig harry and ron learned their lesson last time
harry: i’m rolling my eyes at u guys rn
draco: too late no take backs
draco: ik i just ive never done this sort of thing before
connor: that’s probably a stupid question. of course you’re not okay.
harry: that was a lie i just told them that i liked you
hermione: what’d she say harry
"Alright well, I'll leave you boys to it." She winked at Neville as she exited the greenhouse. His face quickly became a flushed pink, and Blaise just laughed at him.
hermione: there’s more, this one is.... interesting to say the least
draco: good
draco: well yeah but its true, dad hates me and my mum was always too caught up with my dad to really care about me
pansy: neville longbottom and blaise zabini
harry: yeah
“That doesn’t fucking matter kid. He still did it, so yeah, forgive me for worrying the slightest bit.” Sirius’ voice was raised at this point, and Remus had a hand on his back in an effort to calm him down.
neville: i dunno, gran isn’t big on the holidays
harry: doesn’t make u any less scary
draco: i really really like you
neville: ah young love
draco: yeah um anyways so i’ve been wondering something
After Pansy had said goodbye to Connor, they all got off of the train together. They were talking amongst themeselves, but as the started to head towards the exit of the platform, a voice rang through it.
draco: okay, me too
pansy: for what?
“Can I kiss you?” Blaise’s eyes widened, and Neville started to panic, but soon Blaise nodded his head because he was afraid that if he said anything it would wake him up from this amazing dream that he was having. Neville closed his eyes and leaned up on his tippy toes to reach Blaise. Blaise helped him out by leaning down a bit. The kiss was everything that a first kiss should be. Gentle, alone, and sweet. Once Neville pulled away, he laughed a bit with a huge grin on his face. He looked back up to Blaise.
harry: never
ron: and?
harry: SIRIUS WILL BE SO EXTRA I CANT
draco: yes
harry: ok i didn’t bring you here to bully my boyfriend
“You sure?”
pansy: yes?????
ron: alright what about sirius
hermione: yes actually that works out perfectly
dean: no
“You okay?” Draco asked him as he slid his arm around his waist. Harry nodded and gulped down the remainder of his pumpkin juice.
“Guys I’m serious. This looks stupid on me.” Seamus said, and he tried his best to smooth down his suit as they walked through the halls of the castle. Harry rolled his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
ginny: neville where did you go earlier
"Alright, well, I believe you." He said. Draco looked at him with wide eyes.
pansy: YO
harry: why are texting me we’re in the same compartment
draco: i’m not a mind reader give me some context here babe
“I’m not acting weird.” Harry responded.
draco: ok
pansy: i mean only if u want to
blaise: then again none of our parents are going to be pleased so
draco: jUsT tUrN oFf Ur NoTiFiCaTiOns

draco: i like it
dean: oh seamus will teach you he never shuts up
hermione: compartment one- neville, blaise, ginny, luna
“So, tell me Mr. Potter...” She started. “How exactly did you become friends with Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Zabani, and Ms. Parkinson?” Harry’s eyes widened.
hermione: okay, that’s it?
“Yeah.” Pansy whispered into the fire that was lit. Another buzz came from one of the side tables. Pansy glanced over to it. “We should probably check those. They’ve been going crazy.” Draco got up and passed out their phones.
draco: :)
harry: why what?
harry: yeah i am
blaise: i just don't want you to get hurt
pansy: to ask neville to the yule ball duh
ron: what?

hermione: pansy
draco: no can do i’ve got an important matter to deal with
draco: no absolutely not
neville: i’m gay
“Yeah, it does.” Seamus agreed as he took another sip. “I don’t even know why I thought I had a chance.”
sirius: but moony
harry: good thing you have me then
draco: i’m rooting for you
neville: how do u know he’s not lying
neville: anywaysssss

harry: damn

neville: bellatrix lestrange
harry: miss u too
remus: ??? if he fails a test we’re gonna fail him sirius
"Neville? Are you in here?" Professor Sprout's voice rang through the greenhouse. Neville stepped away from Blaise quickly as Blaise coughed.
harry: right....
pansy: guy
draco: is that a yes???
remus: why are u texting us we live together
hermione: are you crazy? harry is definitely paranoid about what they’ll think
hermione: that’s cute
hey guys! sorry for not updating. i’m on vacation, but i’m heading home in 2 days. posting should be back to normal then!!! love you all <3
neville: what
“Who ya’ texting?” Blaise leaned over and  peered at Neville’s phone. He quickly shut it off and looked up to Blaise, who’s face was alarmingly close.
pansy: i don’t like anyone
pansy: HOMEWORK PLS ANYONE
“What’s that?”
harry: then i bet she’s looking down right now and saying “good job harry. it’s what they deserve.”
ron: mate, you two have been acting like a couple since the second year
dean: dork
neville: i think that u should just give them a chance, draco’s really good to harry
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t you get it Pansy?” Blaise announced loudly, snapping Draco out of his daze. “He’s gone soft.”
harry: just answer him babe
All in one breath, Draco ripped open the envelope and waited.
connor: you wouldn’t dare
pansy: holy shit wait are we gonna get special treatment from professors black and lupin now
ron: I WAS
harry: what? ginny
ron: you would stay up all night watching the map to see where he was

neville: my boyfriend’s in slytherin
remus: so harry
“Sorry. It’s just, after the war. I feel like everyone’s gonna die, and I just don’t think I could handle losing anyone else.” Neville said as he took a breath. Blaise grabbed his chin with his finger and gently made Neville look up at him.
harry: anything babe
draco: u still awake?
hermione: we know damn well that draco was pressured into everything, besides if things really do get bad we can just kill him
harry: i know i could tell

draco: really?
harry: are u bribing me?
seamus: ...
blaise: i just sent my letter out to the parents
sirius: well it can’t be that bad. girl or boy?
sirius: ......
“I wanted to be comfy. Sue me.” He sat down inside of the fort and pated the ground next to him. Draco smiled and sat down. Harry laid his head on Draco’s shoulder as Draco started playing with his hair.
blaise: i’m sorry
luna: ik when i tried to kiss you last year you freaked out
“I’m gonna need some proof of that.” Neville gave him a look, and then stood up and started digging through his trunk. Blaise and Pansy both started laughing.
draco: yup.
draco: yeah wtf neville
pansy: what about us slytherins
dean: yeah like ur cauldron in potions class
“Lucius, please.” A smaller, much quieter, voice begged. Narcissa. Shit, Draco hadn’t even taken a second to think about his mum.
harry: so u did sent him?
"Harry. Mr. Malfoy."
ron: u good harry? u looked a bit anxious during dada today.
ron: i guess it could’ve gone worse
hermione: yes ma’am
ron: i mean yeah
sirius: so harry
blaise: ?????
connor: you, me, honeydukes, pumpkin pasties eating challenge

“Nott.” A look of realization flashed over Draco’s face.
neville: don’t worry

blaise: see you guys in there then
neville: i’m crying rn, actually crying
pansy: well shit
seamus: go away
“BLAISE ZABINI. I DON’T KNOW WHAT  GAME YOU THINK YOU’RE PLAYING.” It was his mother’s voice. “HANGING AROUND BLOOD TRAITORSSSS?” Blaise flinched a bit as his mother’s voice hissed at him. “BUT JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU GO THROUGH WITH THIS PATHETIC HOLIDAY PLAN OF YOURS, YOU WON’T SEE THE ZABINI MANOR FOR A VERY LONG TIME. BY VERY LONG TIME, I MEAN NEVER.” And just like that, the envelope shredded itself to bits. An unsettling silence fell upon the Great Hall. Blaise cleared his throat.
ginny: yup.
draco: shouldn’t have stayed up till 3 then
hey guys !! i hope everyone had a wonderful holiday break !! sorry it took so long to get this chapter up, enjoy !!
harry: ik but i cant take it back now
neville: i want to be your boyfriend, but if you don't want that, that's perfectly okay we can just be friends

blaise: NO he didn’t that’s the problem
seamus: i just wanna be left alone rn
draco: of course i do
harry: astronomy tower tonight at midnight
“Fine.” Harry said quickly. He just wanted Draco to quite down.
neville: :)
harry: i’m dating draco malfoy
“It’s not funny.” He said as he pulled his arm away from her hands. Her smile dropped and she gave him an odd look.
draco: hold your horses???
draco: oh she certainly did
harry: ok yeah she was pretty awful but ur not
harry: whatever back to the point
neville: ik
draco: okay???
pansy: sooooo what happened with dean
blaise: um we kissed
remus: just a bit don’t worry
draco: i still stood there and did nothing
honestly forgot that deamus isn’t canon bye-
harry: i mean unless u were planning on going with someone else.... i heard that seventh year in ur house has her eyes on you
blaise: says u
pansy: DRACOS GOT A BOYFRIEND
“C’mere.” He opened arms in invitation. Draco sighed, but nonetheless climbed into the bed anyways. They had all agreed to retire to bed early. It had been a long day, especially for their Slytherin friends. Draco couldn’t help but think that maybe, just maybe, he was finally being accepted by Sirius Black. Actually accepted by him. The thought made him smile as he fell asleep in his boyfriends arms.
oops i forgot my password but i’m back now so yay
hermione: that’s kinda mean
hermione: you thought wrong now spill
blaise: so uh what time do u want to meet
harry: harry leave now
seamus: oh that sucks

blaise: to be fair, it was meant for snape
sirius: ok you know that we don’t care if u date soooo
harry: as for why i wanna go out with you it’s simply because i really really like you
draco: maybe
neville: what?
harry: no thanks malfoy
“Why’d you quit Quidditch anyways?” Harry asked as he nuzzled even further into Dracos neck. Draco paused and kissed Harry’s hair.
ginny: why didn't you tell us neville you know we wouldn't be mad
-enjoy!
“You like Blaise Zabini.” She explained. Neville looked over to her.
sirius: mhm
seamus: oh
ron: we don’t wear dress suits for dinner
harry: SAY IT BACK BITCH
draco: fuck u, ur a piece of shit
ron: i wasn’t much help but ur welcome
“Oh, well, I didn’t know that Mr. Malfoy confessing his feelings for you would take so long.”
neville: you’ve killed someone before haven’t you
harry: u texted him right?
harry: can we not do this ron
draco: fucking nott
harry: yeah that would be great
What the fuck. What the fuck. What the fuck. Dean was kissing him. Holy shit. Mother of Merlin. What is happening?
blaise: i don’t even know how to put it into to words
draco: git
harry: didn’t know that u were such a romantic malfoy
