He fully intended to go to class, that is, until he was nearly run over by a group of ravenclaws. They plow right past him with a hexed boy bleeding and passed out levitating above them. Draco looks back at the stairs knowing he should head to class. But he can't help himself and instead he quickly begins to follow them toward the infirmirary.
"Your parents are planning something?" He asks and she nods popping a piece of fruit in her mouth. "Dunno what it is but they're being secretive." She shrugs. "I just want to sleep for like two whole years." She sighs laying her head on the table.
The servant girl scurried off to the kitchens and he was left alone. As he walked he noticed just how busy it was around the castle. Servants were running about everywhere and when he passed the main ballroom he realized that it had been cleaned top to bottom. There were currently candles being spelled to hang midair and a little house elf was furiously scrubbing the marble floors. How blind had he been not to notice? A young man came running through the hall, so focused on his destination and not dropping the wine glasses that he was balancing on trays of each of his arms that he nearly ran straight into Draco and he had to dodge out of the way. He murmured an apology before rushing off down the hall. Draco grows increasingly curious as he approaches his father's office.
Draco has only been in the infirmirary a handful of times and he was always an absolute pain. He would whine and moan the entire time or if it was his friend that was injured he would demand all attention on them even when it was unnecessary. It's embarrassing to think about and how Madam Pomfrey put up with him is beyond him entirely. He looks up when she pulls aside the curtain holding a tray of vials and promptly gets to work carefully measuring each one.
Not to mention those who were imperiused are viewed by purebloods as weak willed. She's risking their standing with purebloods for a ploy that might not even work. As he gets closer to the end she mentions him. Calling him resilient, strong and brave, all things that he isn't. She gave him credit for breaking their supposed imperius curse.
"How long do you think it'll take to get there?" Goyle asks attempting to maneuver around Pansy's dress to get comfortable. "It'll depend on the thestrals." Blaise says with a shrug but by his nonchalant tone they all know it'll be longer than any of them want.
By the time Draco has gotten out of the shower Harry is already gone, for that he's grateful. Instead of trying to traverse another awkward conversation he can take a second to relax. Once he's dressed he stops for a minute to put the now cooled potions into vials and he slips one of the healing potions into his pocket for Pansy. Then he grabs his books and heads to the great hall.
They eventually reach a small town square with a few muggles milling about. The others gawk but with a scowl from Pansy they attempt to be less obvious about their staring. They stop in front of a little inn and Pansy looks back at them to say "I'll do the talking, all of you just be quiet and don't touch anything" then she pushes the door open and she smiles walking up to the front desk. "We need a room for five, just for tonight and a map of your lovely town" She says with a shining smile and the guy behind the desk, not much older than them seems unfazed by the fact that these five strangely dressed teenagers want a room. "Is there a convention or something?" He asks ringing up the price. "Got a couple of people coming through the past few days with-" He gestures to their robes.
He reads over it perplexed. This is obviously a ploy to gain sympathy and it's an outright lie. His mother had never been under the imperious curse, nor anyone in his family. She talked about how voldemort supposedly forced them to house his army. How unfair it was that Lucius was wrongfully imprisoned. Lie after lie written in ink for everyone to see. He knew his mother was attempting to save their image but it feels wrong to lie. They had voluntarily been a part of the war and no amount of lying can change that.
He has decidedly chosen to ignore how close Harry and Ginny are sitting. It makes his stomach twist with jealousy, which he refuses to actually acknowledge. But it's not just jealousy of Ginny, but all of them. Even when he was at the height of his popularity he couldn't claim he had so many friends. There were people who wanted to be close to him, use him for his family's power. Or they had the misguided notion that he could somehow protect them from the dark lord. But aside from Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise and Pansy he couldn't claim a single other friend. He watches from over his textbook as the group talks animatedly, big smiles plastered across their faces.
Draco knocks on Pansy's door impatiently bouncing from foot to foot. He normally doesn't have this sort of nervous energy but he just can't seem to stand still. As soon as she opens the door he pushes his way in. "Is your roommate here?" He asks peering around and she huffs still holding the door open "Oh w
After he feels as though he is safe he makes his way up the stairs towards the owlery. He clutches tight to his letter until the moment he ties it to the owl's leg. He is already yearning to hear her reply and he watches out the window until the owl disappears over the horizon. He stays there a while longer until he hears the voices of other students.
"You haven't been caught once! What's the worst they could do to you?" Draco took a breath in, intending to list a dozen things that could potentially go wrong. But before he was able to Goyle slammed his fist on the table and it shook so violently, that it felt as though it might topple to pieces. "Be bold, Draco! For once in your life!"
Blaise sighed standing from the table as well and running his hands through his hair, a nervous habit he'd developed since it had grown out. "I guess you're right." He said starting to pace around the table. "And with whatever they're planning it would probably require your presence, we can go at a later date if necessary but-"
By the time he leaves it's nearly curfew and he feels far lighter than he has in a while. He still has the same issues he had several hours prior but with herb correspondences floating in his head it feels as though his problems are far more inconsequential. As he passes a boy in the hall he even manages to smile at him. All he has to do is stay focused. He is here to make his family proud and if that means smiling and getting good grades then so be it.
He sits for a moment turning the bottles over in his hand and he sighs. Not only does she expect him to befriend muggleborns but she also wants him to distance himself from the only friends he's ever had. He wants nothing more in this moment than to have Crabbe and Goyle over like old times. But with Goyle dead it wouldn't feel the same." He sighs and burns his mother's letter, something he grew accustom to during the war. She has always had his best interests at heart and at great cost she has tried to protect him. But right now there's no way of knowing what the right thing to do is. Everything he has been asked to do goes against everything he was raised to be.
A frazzled looking servant enters "Sir Malfoy, your mother has instructed you to dress for the evening." She says quickly and although she looks like she wants to run off and hide from her work she waves for him to follow. With a sigh he rises from his chair. And momentarily he looks back at his friends to be sure they haven't changed their minds. But a small nod in his direction tells him they'll go through with it.
"Sleeping curse pact?" Draco asks and she nods holding her hand out to him without lifting her head "Deal" she says and he rolls his eyes. Grabbing her hand he stands and pulls her up from the table. "Come on we've got alchemy" He says and she groans trudging behind him.
"Maybe I'll just go cry about it to moaning myrtle because you've got the emotional intelligence of a toddler." She shoves her chair in and there is a loud shhhhh in the distance but Pansy pays no attention. "A basic level of empathy is all I'm asking for." She hisses then storms away.
"I don't know what sort of hex I'm trying to counteract which makes it difficult to find an antidote." She says wiping at the witch's forehead which has grown sweaty even though she remains deathly pale. "There is always a solution." She says and something in her voice makes him look up to see her brow furrowed in concentration as she scribbles something down on a clipboard. She has saved so many lives through the last two wars it is hard to believe she couldn't heal one hexed child which brings him a small comfort.
Pansy was reading through the prophet, which somehow escaped the scrutiny of wizarding society. She holds up an article to Draco who had been staring at Harry trying to will him to look his way. "Did you know about this?" She asks pointing at the page. He peers over to read the headline
which would have made him far more comfortable. Harry leans down and sniffs the sleep potion "Smells nice" he says a bit awkwardly and there is an intense urge to shove him away. He needs to be far away from Harry. His heart is beating fast and his palms have grown sweaty. Everything in him is screaming to grab his wand and hex him.
"Maybe a little, but you've got one more year and that's all." She says again backing away so that he'll lift his head to look at him. "One more year and the most interaction you'll have with Potter are a few awkward words in passing." Draco is silent for a moment and her smile is so warm and open that he has to look away. The thought of Potter, someone who has spent his years obsessing over, someone who is brave and strong and everything that Draco isn't makes his heart ache. "What if I don't want that?" He says quietly and her smile falls.
Draco paces in front of Pansy's room trying to will himself to turn back. He has never been one to rebel or openly doubt his family. Even during the war he kept any contempt for the dark lord to himself. At the time even his thoughts didn't feel like his own. He wasn't particularly skilled at occulemency but the one thing he was good at was hiding things away. If he felt nothing then the dark lord could take nothing from him. But his father is in azkaban, his future is uncertain, and even after the dark lord has died he still haunts him. At the most unlikely of times fear can grip him and refuse to let go.
Instead of going to his last class of the day he skips hoping he can beat Harry to their dorm and be out before class is over. As soon as he closes the door behind him he throws himself onto his bed. He's ready to sleep, preferably through the rest of the year. He sighs flipping over to look at his plants hanging above him. Some of their leaves have started to wilt from lack of water and he feels mildly guilty. He's been so caught up with everything that he's neglected them.
"I would sooner be tried as a witch by muggles than let you miss this party." Blaise said crossing his arms over his chest and looking sternly at Draco.
As they talk Pansy is quickly accepted into their friend group. It seemed that fit in seamlessly as if she had always been there. And by the time they made it to diagon alley all of them were laughing together as if all of them had been friends since they were children.
They choose a modest little inn for the night which everyone tried to gripe about as little as possible. All of them are used to luxury as a standard so even some of the nicest inns on diagon alley would have been considered subpar. Every single one of them tossed and turned all night though this was partially due to the fear of being caught. To be caught  even before they got to the party would be devastating. They desperately need faster transportation first thing in the morning. The carriage can only go so fast and if they don't want to get caught brooms would be their best bet.
"I'm going to take a shower. You should..fix that" He says gesturing toward the wall and internally cringing at himself. As he passes his desk he shuts off the heat for his potions before he slips into the bathroom. He can feel Harry's eyes on him and if he could just hex him this would be so much easier.
"What the are you doing?" Draco asks standing to his feet. But she only smiles grabbing her dress then climbing into the water. He watches her perplexed then she grins and drops the hem of her dress which quickly  sinks into the water. She smiles and stretch her hands above her head. Her carefully placed hair has started to free itself and has created a soft halo of moonlight around her head. It is a wonder to see someone so carefree, it is hard to imagine that he has ever felt that way. "What I'm doing," She says closing her eyes and turning her face towards the full moon, "Is choosing to be happy" She says and she takes in a slow breath and smiles. Then before he can decide whether she is amazing or insane she looks over at him with a mischevious glint in her eye. There is something in her gaze that screams rebellion, the same fire he'd felt upon planning to flee. "Join me" She says holding out her hand.
Draco has decided that he's going to ignore the very existence of Harry Potter. Whenever Harry enters a room then he leaves. When they have classes together his eyes are fixed at the front of the room. Even if keeping himself from watching him play piano in music and duel in defense against the dark arts makes him feel like he is slowly going insane. In his free time he has found himself in the infirmirary. Mary continues to be in a comatose state and as the days go by several other students are hexed as well. Aside from slowing the process madam pomfrey has yet to find a cure.
"But nothing!" Harry cuts in. "We just have to pass our OWLS and we don't need to be here to do that!" He huffs tossing the cloaks into his trunk. "Besides, we're already cleared for auror training and Hermione can come stay with us at your mum's until-."
"It's a bit much, but where else would I put all of it?" He asks and though Draco keeps himself from saying
"No, not at all." She says with the shake of her head. "Alchemist is a difficult profession." She says which only makes him feel even worse. "So you're saying you don't think I could?" He says ready to up and leave the infirmary altogether. She glances over at him and shakes her head. "You could, I don't doubt that. You're a talented and driven student." The compliment takes him off guard and he stares at her wondering where this is going. "The prestige of the title is very alluring and looks good to the public. Or am I wrong?" She asks and he quickly looks away knowing she has realised he is only chasing the title solely for that reason.
Ron stands suddenly from his seat. "They haven't thrown you in azkaban yet?" He yells angrily but she continues to smile. "This detention will be a family affair I see. A detention for you as well Mr.Weasley." And she is just about to speak again when another voice breaks in. "Maybe you'd prefer a walk through the forbidden forest!" And although Harry seems to have disappeared Draco has fought with him enough over the years to know his voice. This one seems to rattle her and her smile dims for a moment before it is forced back. "Who was that?" She says in a clipped tone and when nobody steps forward. She says tersely, "The forbidden forest is forbidden for a reason!" Then her smile returns brighter than ever.
"My parents want me to finish out school at Durmstrang, seems like a waste to me." Goyle says and Crabbe shrugs "At least it's not beuxbaton. I got an offer to work at a dueling studio, take a good look at this nose because by years end I'm sure it'llbe broken enough times that even an episky won't fix it."
"I can't help it! Just all of a sudden-" She suddenly laughs and he glares daggers at her "What are you talking about? You've liked him for years!" She says and he shakes his head "No I haven't!" He says crossing his arms suddenly defensive. "I just saw him playing piano and he was shirtless and I-"
"I've never met a muggle!" Crabbe says entirely stunned. "I've heard that they're wild! Someone told me they saw a muggle jump off of a bridge with only a string holding them up!" Crabbe says laughing and everyone but Pansy laughs with them. "That's bungee jumping, they do it for fun." Pansy says with a little smirk as they break into a disbelieving frenzy of questions.
"What if..what if maybe I liked someone that I probably shouldn't and-" He says fidgeting as he speaks but she cuts him off to say "You like Potter don't you?" And his horrified silence only confirms her suspicions. "Draco, why now? Do you enjoy making things harder for yourself?"
"Let's just say my relationship is the reason my parents wish to marry me off so quickly." She sighs looking out at one of the fairies bouncing along the bushes.
Draco shakes his head and drops himself onto Pansy's bed "Diabolical" he says reaching for the firewhiskey, the letter in his pocket for the moment forgotten. He takes a drink, the liquid burning down his throat.
"Draco could undoubtedly annoy him into leaving. Merlin knows he's always such a prat." Pansy says but at this Blaise brightens. "Do you think you could?" He asks and Pansy smiles smugly.
What is it that he should want? Does he want to be seen as a deatheater? Does he want to be seen as their enemy? What is he meant to be if the only thing he was told to be is no longer possible? If everything is stripped from him, all of the money, and the politics, who is he truly?
"I've never met her, but I'm sure once Madam Pomfrey is finished helping her you can get all the details from her." She says shutting him down with a sweet tone and a soft smile. "We really must be going" She says grabbing Draco by the arm and he gratefully follows her. The boy tries to call them back but they hurry away
Many of the faces are unfamiliar to him, though they seem shocked to see him nonetheless. He scans the crowd hoping for at least a single friendly face. Even the teacher is unfamiliar to him. However there is one person that he recognizes. As soon as their eyes meet he is tempted to turn and walk back out of the classroom. Because staring back at him, a seemingly inescapable fixture in his life is Harry Potter.
"I can't see properly back there." He says tapping the kid who sighs with relief and snatches his things and switches seats with  murmured thanks. The teacher watches for a moment seeming confused as to what just happened. But after a moment decides to start the lesson.
"We don't take kindly to enemies on our land." Says the one in the middle, who he assumes is the leader. Draco swallows hard, his nerves getting the best of him. "I'm- I'm not an enemy" He stammers and there is a scoff from the centaurs. "I've left the ways of the dark lord!" He says even though this isn't entirely true.
He stands beginning to pace across the room "Pansy! I liked him the whole time! What the fuck?" He cries running a hand through his hair anxiously. "Draco, relax." She says standing with him and grabbing his arm to keep him still. "If you've liked him so long then what's one more year?" She asks pulling him into a hug. He slouches resting his head on her shoulder. "I'm an idiot." He groans and she sighs patting his back.
"Thank you for covering for me." Draco says trying to shift her attention slightly from her frustration. Pomfrey shakes her head slightly "It's not a cover. I fully expect you to be my apprentice, I'll draw up the papers as soon as I'm done here." She says tapping the boy with her wand to check for any other cuts. She flits her hand in front of Draco and he pulls his hands away from the former gash. It is mostly healed over by whatever potions she gave him and she leans in to inspect it. "I didn't realize you were serious..I- I have classes and lots of studying and-" He says trying to think up an excuse but she holds up a hand to cut him off. "You'll live. And it'll look good on your resume if you want to be an alchemist, though I still don't think it's the most practical use of potioneer training." He is quiet for a moment thinking it over.
He rolls his eyes and leans against her. "What I want is a friend that isn't ridiculously perceptive yet ferociously secretive." And she smiles "Like I said, you want what you can't have." At this he huffs a soft laugh through his nose, his lips unmoving and Pansy turns to him to give him one last piece of advice. "Be careful Draco," she says quietly almost as if she is saying in to herself.
He has seen her stabilize multiple hexed students by now, it's the same process everytime. Without thinking he hurries to the supplies puts on a pair of gloves and grabs an iv, syringes and bandages for the boy's head as Pomfrey collects the medicine. He sets to work arranging everything and when Pomfrey returns with his papers and medicine she looks surprised for a moment before her attention moves back to the boy. She flips through his file and readies the gauze. "No preexisting conditions, so he must have been hexed like the others." She sighs pressing gauze to where he is bleeding near his ear.
"I don't know how we're going to live together." Draco sighs slouching down onto his bed. "We've never gotten along, and I don't see it starting now."
Clearly not wanting to admit having not gone through any paperwork left for her Umbridge smiles and nods. "Of course." She says then turns her attention to the unconcious child wanting to quickly change the subject. "It seems clear the diagnoses here." She says and Pomfrey nods. "Clearly he has the illness. He is stable now but-"
When he returns he sees Harry with a brush in hand splattering his nameplate with colors. He sits staring at his own for a minute before Harry looks over at him. "I'm surprised to see you here." Harry says with a quizzical look. "Why are you taking muggle art?" He asks and Draco shrugs trying to figure out how to open one of the tubes. Harry reaches over taking it from him and pulls off a little plastic tab then repeats the same for the others.
The birds have started chirping by the time Draco has gotten to the last ingredient. He can hear Harry moving about behind him and he tries his best to ignore it. In the slytherin dorms everyone knew not to bother him if he was making a potion. The best part is that there had been room to do so. But in this tiny room it feels as though Harry is looking over his shoulder. "What are you doing?" Draco asks curiously hoping to gain a few more nonhostile words between them. He drops in the last ingredient and leaves it to simmer. But as soon as he glances behind him he can see that posters are now splayed across the opposite wall.
Sprawled across the room are papers as well as Harrys whole gang crammed inside. Harry Ron Hermione and Neville are sat on Harry's bed pouring over notes while Ginny and Luna are writing with fervor perched on Draco's bed. When they see him all conversation stops and he sees Ron hide something behind his back. He should say nothing but he gestures to the girls on his bed and turns to Harry angrily. "You have your side of the room, I have mine." He grumbles feeling frustration bubbling up inside him. He wants someone to fight with. Knowing that two of his very limited pool of friends will be leaving makes him feel conflicted. He isn't normally one to feel sad, it's far easier to lash out. But picking a fight with Harry surrounded by so many of his friends couldn't be a worse idea.
"And the other parts?" He asks and Draco looks away trying to think of a way out of this conversation.
Draco manages to stay hidden away in his room for several hours but as time ticks by the servants that his parents have sent to fetch him are becoming increasingly more distressed. He only gives in when their newest servant, a wiry young girl with straw-like hair, begins to beg and seems near tears. He couldn't help the pity he felt knowing his parents probably scared the poor girl half to death.
The letter is longer than the others he'd recieved but instead of comforting him it send a chill down his spine. He has never heard her speak so passionately about things relating to pureblood supremacy. He can't help but worry something terrible has happened to her, wonder if perhaps she wad forced to write the letter. He rereads it trying to glean some sort of secret code. But no matter how many times he reads it he can't find an answer.
"You may be shocked to know that I'm not an awful person." Draco says, though he isn't sure of that but he sidesteps again and Harry moves with him. "I didn't do anything wrong, so just leave me alone." He side steps again now close enough to the door. "Now if you don't mind, golden boy" he spits the name like it is made of venom. "I'll be going" he says quickly grabbing the door and slipping out smoothly. He walks quickly down the hall just in case Harry decides to follow.
He already knows he will get a letter from his mother telling him he should let her take him under her wing. What better way to get ministry support than be well liked by a ministry official, particularly one who is so gifted with bending the truth. He can only hope for his own sanity that that letter will never arrive.
She seems giddy to have someone join her and she smiles and stands raising her arms again and spins her dress flowing under her. As he watches her smiling he thinks perhaps marrying her wouldn't be so terrible. She doesn't seem vapid or dull and she has a wonderful laugh. She is a beautiful girl and perhaps he could grow to love her. His heart beats fast unsure whether it is this sudden freedom or perhaps some sort of rise of feelings. There is a small hope that he might still hold onto his life. Running away would be abandoning everything he has ever known. But with her, maybe he could stay. When she spins to him again he reaches out wrapping an arm around her waist and he pulls her toward him. And with his heart beating frantically he pulls her close and kisses her.
"They'll find us! Idonwannadie-" Draco says his words so fast and fearfully that they slur together. He tries to run but Harry grabs him roughly yanking him down to the base of the tree.
"Who the hell is Pansy Parkinson?" He nearly shouts, and he has the urge to stand, perhaps slam his hands on his father's desk or storm out of the room but he manages to restrain himself though he grips the arms of his chair tightly.
"I'm not a prude!" He grumbles but Goyle laughs shaking his head. "If you're not a prude then you must be a saint!" He chuckles and Draco grits his teeth in annoyance. If there is anything that has been coursing through his veins ever since he found out about his betrothal it is spite. Behind the anger, the yearning for freedom just below the surface it has been bubbling. For years he has made excuses for his parents but this spite has been growing for quite some time. It is spite for his family, spite for the expectations in his life, spite for every moment that he had to be perfect.
He stands there staring at the door feeling as though his ancestors are burning him from the inside out. His hands start to shake and his heart picks up pace. It's as if he is facing down a foe. He takes in a breath and clenches his teeth forces himself to step forward. As he opens the door and steps inside there is a sudden hush that falls upon the class.
She doesn't wait for him to answer, instead she nods to Madam Pomfrey and turns to leave. He watches as she goes and he can't quite decipher how he feels. He looks back at the girl in her corpselike state and for some reason he wants to cry. He grasps for something solid within himself as he stand motionless. The idea that this attack might be from Voldemort's supporters fills him with an overwhelming fear. It has been easy to pretend that the war is behind him, but there is no better motivator than the death of a leader. If there is a resurgence then where do his allegiances lie? It is a question he hasn't wanted to think about.
There is a small town in the distance but unsure whether it's muggle or not they have to go by foot to avoid being spotted. So they all stow their brooms in their shrinking trunks and head off. There is a cold wind and Draco shivers left only in partially pinned trousers. They walk for what feels to Draco to be hours before a cloak is dropped over his shoulders. "Thanks" I says staring at the ground but he can see Blaise's shiny shoes walking beside him. "You seemed cold." He replies instead of pointing out that he would need to at least appear dressed to get an inn. "Thanks" He says again though this time it's not for the cloak.
"You're not getting off that easy, we're not done talking about this!" Blaise said stopping mid stride to glare at him accusingly and Draco groaned slouching back into his seat. "We're going to be having the time of our lives, and you'll be here, bored out of your mind. So at the very least, consider it."
After the war was over Draco realized that in all the time that Voldemort lived with them he had never once smiled. This fact often woke him late at night with a cold sweat prickling his skin. It's horrifying to acknowledge that he is far more like the dark lord than he is willing to admit. This would have been something that he would have celebrated hardly even months before the war had ended. But once the dark lord was gone he was able to see him for what he was. He was cruel, vengeful, devoid of love or happiness. It is a fate he wouldn't wish upon even the worst of mankind. However it would seem that is who he was trained to be. So he has to question whether he deserves it. He was so much like the dark lord, they shared the same ambition, ruthlessness, and bigotry as much as he hated go admit it. And yet the only thing that stood in his way was his cowardice that kept him from killing.
Quickly though his mother breaks the silence,"She is beautiful, well educated, and from a good family, she is a lovely girl andwill make a wonderful wife." and she says it as if she is talking about a particularly nice roast.
"You really think she would leave?" Ron asks shaking his head with an incredulous look and Harry pauses for a moment one of his shirts still balled in his fist. And he huffs in frustration "We can convince her."
The lot of them lounge about a table which is scratched, dented, and beaten to hell. They hide it whenever the Malfoy parents are about so they won't toss it out. It was a memento from the time they'd gotten wasted, this time Draco included, and stole the ugly thing from a pub. It is still sticky and horrendous to look at regardless of how many times it's been washed and buffed by the servants. Even magic couldn't make the tragic thing look presentable. It's a ratty old pub table and it would stick out like a sore thumb among all of the grandeur of the Malfoy manor regardless of how it is dressed. The juxtaposition of it makes them look like a band of misfits who only stumbled upon luxury perchance and they're all rather fond of the idea.
Two weeks have passed before he receives a letter from his mother, but instead of the reassurances he'd wanted from her or an explanation there is a short note that says,
And as he rose to follow her out the door Blaise called after him "Consider it, mate!" before the door closed with a dull thud. They really were more trouble than they were worth, though their insistence on dragging him into their schemes is a great source of entertainment.
"I thought you were a goner!" Goyle says as Draco reaches them. "Let's get the hell out of here!" He huffs still trying to make his heart slow "This way" Pansy says pointing off in the distance and she quickly takes lead.
Draco huffs"Shut up" he says rolling his eyes. "So you're not mad at me?" He asks and Blaise holds up his fingers, an inch apart. "A little." He says then grabs the firewhiskey from Pansy to take a swig. He grimaces at the taste. "We may have been planning to hex you into a ferret if you didn't show up."
Immediately after breakfast Draco rushes back to his dorm. He has muggle studies first thing which he has been skipping when possible to avoid Harry. But as soon as he has settled in front of the pepper up potion he'd been working on the door bursts open and he turns startled with wand in hand to see Harry, Ron and Ginny. Harry is fuming and for a moment he wonders if he is somehow the cause. He's tempted to immediately up and leave but as Harry storms in he starts furiously throwing things into his trunk instead of trying to pick a fight.
She twists a piece of her hair which has fallen loose around her finger and she sighs looking down at the fountain "Happiness is for those who have the choice. We have duties do we not?" She asks wit disdain and she looks down at her dress with a huff "These shoes are killing me" she sighs then hikes up her dress to kick them off. She sighs grateful for the relief as she wriggles her toes.
"Walk with me if you will." She says gesturing for him to follow. He looks back at Pansy wishing she might think up something to get him out of it but Mcgonagall says "That wasn't a suggestion." And he regretfully turns to follow her.
"I'm sure we've lost those guys by now can't we stop so I can change?" And even he can hear the annoying whine in his voice.
"With Umbridge here we won't be getting an education anyways! You remember how it was!" Harry grumbles but Ginny steps between them with a gleam in her eye. "I've got an idea" she says with a mischevious grin. After a moment she jerks her head in Dracos direction who had been sneaking a look. He quickly fixes his eyes on his cauldron again, pretending he hasn't been listening the entire time. Then with the muttering of muffliato the room becomes silent once again. Only the bubbling of his cauldron and every so often the shuffling of feet break through.
He keeps his head down as he walks through the halls trying not to feel the eyes that flit toward him. He fiddles with the end of his wand in his pocket, it calms him knowing it's there even if he knows he can't use it. When he reaches the great hall he's surprised to see that the house colors are gone and the four tables have been arranged in a large square in the middle of the room. It takes him a moment of wandering before he spots Crabbe, Blaise, and Pansy huddled together at one of the tables which seems to be occupied almost solely by slytherins.
"Did you bring alcohol? We're nearly out." Pansy says pouting as she pulls out a bottle of firewhiskey that had been haphazardly hidden under a pillow upon his arrival. When he shakes his head she groans dramatically and falls back onto her bed. "You ignore us then don't even bring firewhiskey?" She grumbles clearly already drunk."I..uh, I'm sorry about that." He say haltingly. He's always hated apologizing but the situation warrants it. "My mom told me to stop talking to you guys-"
He reminds himself of the lessons he was taught as a child to control his emotions he takes a breath "I expect nothing less, Potter." He manages to say in a bored tone even though everything in him is screaming at how close Harry is. He could reach out and touch him, but doing so would likely get him hexed. "I think I'll go study elsewhere." He hisses grabbing his book and marching out of the room. He sighs heavily once he's halfway down the hall equally relieved to be away from Harry and confused at his desire to be closer to him. He hurries down the hall towards Pansy's room in need of advice.
Blaise and Draco exchange a confused look. "Did you know that?" Blaise asks and Draco shakes his head. "I knew there was someone but I had no ckue she was engaged" He says with a shrug. Crabbe and Goyle fly out of the window next. Then as Blaise climbs onto his own broom to leave there is a banging on their door. "We know you're in there! Come out now and we won't hurt ya!" The men say and Drack curses as he quickly shrinks his trunk and Blaise pushes himself out of the window waving for Draco to hurry. There is a loud thump on the door as the two men try to kick it down. There is another thud and there is a terrifying sound of wood beginning to splinter.
With each hexing and every passing day without word from his mother he's sure that there must be a resurgence afoot. Even though she hasn't written him she seems to be on great speaking terms with the prophet. Every other day there is a new story or interview. She has always been charismatic and quick witted which lends itself nicely to bold faced lies. The prophet seems to wholeheartedly believe her and the support of his family continues to grow.
The ravenclaws look anxiously among one another as Umbridge approaches. "What are all of you doing out of class?" She asks with a smile. "Our friend got hurt and our teacher said-" one of them starts but Umbridge shakes her head "Well I say you should stay in class. If your teacher gave you permission would you walk into a room full of angry fae?" She asks with a laugh. "They were just bringing-" Madam Pomfrey starts but Umbridge cuts in.
He'd never been rejected by anyone until that first day of school when Harry decided he'd pick that freckled faced blood traitor over him. It was unthinkable to him that he would do something so foolish. He'd believed that Harry would come around, but he never did. It was strange  to watch him over the years.  Harry nearly died numerous times and somehow he still seemed undeniably happy. He smiles so easily and Draco had always been envious of that. He always found himself searching for Potter at meals and he seemed to always be smiling or laughing. It made him jealous, though he would never have admitted to it out loud. He's never been that carefree for a single moment in his life. His restraint has been ingrained in him every day of his life. It's not as if he refuses to be happy, it's simply that after all these years he doesn't know how.
"Will we really?" Draco asks hating the idea of looking like a commoner. He has always looked regal or at the very least unattainably wealthy. But he is already in a carriage barreling away from his home so that life has to be behind him. "You still haven't answered how you know about Potter's party." Blaise says eyeing Pansy curiously.
‘Coming Potter?’ He asks obnoxiously as I struggle to pull on my own shoes, ‘wouldn’t want to be late for breakfast.’
Hermione nodded, and there ensued a long and detailed conversation about Harry's shortcomings in potion making and many other gripes besides. Almost 15 minutes later, Draco opened the door to a very disgruntled Harry.
‘Do you want to talk about it, Ma-Draco?’ My voice falters and I cringe because its so awkward. He shakes his head and stares up at the ceiling, as though blinking away tears. I don’t think he can see me watching. Maybe he can.
He felt a curious spark in his chest as Draco looked at him, flushed and grinning bashfully. His hair had come down, the curls spilling over his ears as he bent down to put his violin away.
He smiled, and Harry couldn’t help but smile back, because weirdly enough, Draco Malfoy had cheered him up a bit.
“I’m just gonna take a shower, Malfoy” Harry offered to the prone form of Draco on his bed. No audible response but a thumbs up was all that was needed.
They can all see the thestrals now. Everyone. Even the tiny first years, coming back to re-do first year, because the Carrows’ made life a living
‘Didn’t think I’d leave you alone that fast Potter?’ He smirks and starts to settle, leaving me with a curious blooming feeling in my chest.
“When did you last eat a proper meal?” Harry could feel his eyes on my shoulder blades as he paused, hand on the door.
He’s prattling on about some project or other, catching Harry's eye every now and again in the rearview mirror. “…you’ll find that out when you get there!” He finishes brightly and flashes an off-kilter smile over his shoulder.
“We want answers Harry.” The steely note in Ron’s voice made him flinch a little, but he stays silent. Harry unbuttons his coat.
They meet in the middle and Harry was immediately enveloped in a bone-crushing hug from both sides. Its nice. At least he thinks it is. Suddenly it’s not so nice and he can feel himself trying to push back, to
He began to sit up, just in time for him to watch as Draco lifted the violin to his shoulder, eyes shut. The violin nestled there, becoming an extension of Draco, his bow another arm, and he looked more comfortable and at home than Harry had ever seen him. There was a red tinge high on his cheekbones and his hands shook slightly as he composed himself, puffing his cheeks as he took a deep breath.
“Pumpkin pasty? Liquorice wand?” Draco pulled more sweets out of his trunk and suddenly Harry was back in first year, sat with Ron gorging on confectionary, taste buds exploding as he eat more sugar than in his whole life put together. Harry smiled and remembered how entranced he was with the Chocolate Frog cards, effectively his first encounter with Dumbledore.
As the door closes, I hear him groan and slide further into the voluptuous folds of his duvet. I hop in and out of the shower, brush my teeth and leave the bathroom in time to see Draco sitting, eyes shut, on the edge of his bed. His hair is piled in an uncontrollably curly bush on his head, falling over his eyes and so wildly different to the carefully slicked down hair of his youth. I realise that I’m staring when he coughs, shakes his head and suddenly gets up - full of life.
“No Mr. Finnegan, not on this occasion.” Her voice was sharp, and Harry could tell she expected at a little
“awful I know.” Harry cut across him and avoided his eye. He couldn't see why he had to tolerate Draco Malfoy after everything that had happened.
He smiles, and I can’t help but feel he’s laughing at me, mocking me for the way I’m trying my best to make amends, even in the tiniest ways.
“oh, yeah true!” In his eagerness to start a conversation Harry had missed their trunks and uniform laid out next to the beds already. The fake cheerfulness in his voice made him cringe, and he shook his head as through trying to shake something off. Draco flopped down face first on to his bed, eyes shut.
‘Hiya poncy boy,’ Harry grinned back and picked up one of the many papers. ‘What is this stuff anyway?’
Ron and Zacharias Smith were next to be paired and Harry was feeling increasingly panicky, looking at the remaining boys as Seamus and Dean get paired together, which by the way was extremely unfair?? Finally, he was left stood across the hall from Draco Malfoy.
he stood up and began to excuse himself, but before he could even say Thanks! Draco got his arms around Harry and swiftly pulled his shirt up from the hem.
Draco thought for a moment, he didn't want to own up to Harry that he had only began listening, or even contemplating, muggle music since the end of the war. It wasn't that his mother had never allowed it, just that it would have been deeply frowned upon; and unlike his cousin, Sirius Black, had never had the gumption to rebel in any capacity.
The sound of something twittering and scratching at my window wakes me up in the morning, and I drag myself up, bleary eyed, to let Hedwig in with a letter. I breathe in the morning freshness that is unique to Hogwarts and turn in to the bathroom rubbing my eyes free of sleep.
‘I was only trying to help, I’m sorry…’He tried to talk to Draco running after him as he marched away. ‘Draco, I’m sorry, listen to me, I thought I was being helpful! Please!’
“Oh, um Hermione” I look away, and curse the blood rising up the back of my neck. “She thought you might like to look in on her and Ron later.”
Harry follows him out the door and together they haul the trunk to the car. The hug, however spontaneous, was a definite reminder of change in the taller boy’s attitudes, something Harry couldn’t quite pin down. Draco nods, and makes his way round to the driver’s seat;
A short walk later, and the trio were stood at the base of the steps, the doors open, and the returning Hogwarts students flooded in to the entrance hall, grateful to be out of the cold.
Her parting words reassured Harry, that even if the train got picked up by a giant dinosaur, Hermione would make sure everyone was still on time.
He hadn’t expected to be so drawn in to the music as much as he had been. The lilting tune and brilliance of the violinist had captured him from the moment the needle touched the vinyl, with the sweeping melodies and the theme coming back in triumphant orchestral unity. I wonder how many pieces there are, he pondered, surely there must be more, I wonder how much Draco has heard? Who did Narcissa, or more likely Lucius, consider appropriate for their little prince?
“maybe I just want to be the nice one for once Potter” he spits it out like its difficult for him to say.
have been a wizard,’ Harry asked incredulously, ‘no one knows how to contact the devil, that’s some serious dark mag-…what?’
“Well I’m sorry Potter, there’s nothing I can do, the Sorting Hat was consulted, and he seemed to think it best!” She turned on her heel and it was more than Harry could do to not shout after her that I'd
“…seriously Potter, when did you last shower?” Draco was saying “You look like you’ve been washing with wet wipes since last May and honestly, when did you last sleep a full night? I can see your cheekbones where they used to be fleshed out, even during the last few years? Are you eating enough, you’re so thin, I’m worried…
He leant in once more, “Fred is gone. George can’t stand himself and its all. Your. Fault.” He chocked the words out and his spittle landed on Harry's cheek. And that’s it. Harry suddenly snapped and he lost control.
“Lavender Brown and Parvati Patel” Air punches and a rush of feet accompany the first pairing, closely followed by an outburst of chattering as hopes soar.
The song is David Bowie - Five Years (strongly reccomend it made me cry the first time i heard it hehe)
It started with a whirlwind shower, with hair washed and teeth brushed in record time. Then came the dressing, where each article of clothing is selected carefully held up next to each other, styled to perfection, a flick of his wand switching items in and out. His hair is taken care of by a couple of spells – something I
“Don’t mention it” He turned on his heel and walked away and Harry followed cautiously, wheeling the trolley and feeling like a first year.
. All I had to do was wake up, make coffee, have breakfast; and it was so tedious! Pretending that I was ok with all this. Like I wasn’t wondering what I could’ve done if I’d actually gotten my NEWTS? But again no, it was decided
'Sorry Hermione, Harry's not in at the moment' He lied, looking at the curly haired witch standing indignantly outside their room.
The notes were sprightly and his fingers crossed the strings with an incredible agility, leaving nothing to chance. His hands seemed to settle into the music, shifting up and down the strings, stretching and twisting to accommodate the two notes. His bow flew through the air, the bounce creating the beautiful running scales and shapes that seemed to be no effort at all to Draco. The longer he played the more natural it seemed and the more Harry couldn’t believe he had ever been sceptical of the blond boys talent. His face reflected the emotion of the music, his nose screwing up slightly at the trickier passages. He came to a close with a final flourish of his bow and lowered his instrument, chest rising and falling as he looked back at Harry.
“Let me finish what I was saying outside.” Draco put a hand gently on Harry's arm and he could feel it burn where he touched him. Harry couldn’t remember the last time someone touched him, not with real any real emotion
Draco twisted round from the front seat. “you all right there, Potter?” he checks with a grin which Harry can’t bring myself to return. Harry's mind continues to whirr;' why Draco is being so nice? I mean we’re enemies? Enemies don’t suddenly become friends. That’s not how it works.'
‘Of course Neville that would be so good, um could I ask wha-’ He was about to ask what on earth Neville meant by they didn’t agree with Ron but Draco cut across him.
The girls now all done, Professor began on the boys, with “Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom.” Neville’s brave attempt at a handshake fell flat, and Harry couldn’t help but worry for him.
“You did, but I hope you’ll accept that those burns are worse than they look, not that you would look!” the cold mask of the pureblood heir slid back in to place and Harry was reminded that this is the boy who has spent his entire life getting his own way. The hard look unnerved him, and he looked away, accepting that, yes, it is
I smile and wave back, probably looking confused as hell (which I am) and close the door behind me. I pull a few more things out of my trunk, fold and place them in the dresser between our beds. I leave exactly half of every drawer for Harry, trying to make my stuff look as innocuous as possible next to the gold and red. Hmm, so Granger seems to have forgiven me. Interesting, has she bought Weasley with her is the question. He seems really angry about Harry not being exactly on top of the world, which in my humble opinion, is utterly ridiculous and to be honest, he needs to get a gri-...
Memories of Narcissa’s long fair hair brushing my face as she whispered the promise of life; of Hermione and Ron kissing on the stair and the feeling that no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t be happy for them. The overwhelming sense of numbness, nothing as he watched the Weasleys mourn.
Something under Draco's bed caught his eye, it was rounded and a dark blue colour covered in stickers from different countries, conventions, fragile stickers that muggles used on their post and wizard stickers twinkling and moving around.
“Merlin’s beard Draco! Calm down I was only saying thank you and trust me I meant it” He turns away and bends over, reaching for his pyjamas. “aren’t you going to shower?”
‘Of course you can you daft prick’ says Blaise, completely dispelling the impression I had of formality and precision. Draco shakes his head and glances at me as I try not to smile too broadly. ‘If you’re willing Harry, I’d love for us to become friends. Eventually of course,’ he chuckles, ‘I’m not expecting that kind of miracle overnight’
“Harry’s in the shower, come in,” I offer, noting the surprised look on her face when I don’t sneer and bully her.
A few weeks in they were sat in companionable silence during one of their frees when Harry began rummaging about under his bed and pulled out a suitcase shaped black case. Draco was nonplussed until a cardboard box of dog-eared records followed it. Harry pulled it up onto his bed, and began leafing through them humming softly under his breath.
“I’m fine, I just needed a little space” Harry couldn't meet their concerned gaze and felt the heat rising, colouring the back of his neck a virulent red.
'This is your godfather's isn't it' He asked softly, watching the fondness in Harry's eyes as he lowered the needle.
“no, I’m sorry” Harry whispered, voice breaking, tears finally rolling over the edge and he buries his face in Draco's chest, heaving great big sobs that wrack his ribcage and cause Draco to hold him ever tighter, muttering soft reassurances.
a single room! When he got back to the entrance hall, Draco was still there, sitting on the stairs clutching two keys.
“You’re calling them by their names?” He’s looking at me, squinting slightly as he wipes his specs off on his towel. “That’s really nice of you Malfoy”
“Well. After…everything, I sort of, I wasn’t…I um, I couldn’t work out why I was alive.” He was quiet and tentative and it felt like running uphill trying to explain this. “so, I didn’t want anyone to see me that way. I shut everyone out and I hadn’t spoken to anyone for months until Dra..Malfoy came to pick me up this morning.”
‘Do you want to talk about it, Ma-Draco?’ His voice falters and I feel myself cringe at the way he’s tiptoeing around the subject. After all he just had to wake an old deatheater up from a fucking nasty nightmare, in the middle of the night, god knows I’d be scared.
“lord Draco you’ve been working out?” A sharp, upper class accent cut in to Harry's trance as Pansy Parkinson settled down next to Draco, and Blaise Zabini beside him, acknowledging Harry with the tiniest nod.
He can’t see me, but I shrug anyway and slide down into my own bed. It was definitely something, but I also know, he definitely doesn’t trust me just yet. I have so many questions as to why he’s been so receptive to my attempts at friendship and I really don’t want to mess it up now.
“We’ll see you in a bit yeah?” Ron puts a hand on Harry's back like an uninterested acquaintance, as he followed Hermione to sit next to Dean and Seamus.
He didn’t think he was ready for this. It was all too soon. Too soon after Narcissa died; too soon after he left St. Mungo’s with a discharge slip and a stress ball clutched so hard it burst;
It was Monday. There was a long way to go before the promised party on Saturday and Harry could feel it all too well. Draco had begun disappearing off, claiming that he had to practice – for what, Harry couldn’t work out.
Harry eeks out making the tea for as long as he could. Picking mugs that weren’t dirty, pouring in milk. He can feel Draco getting impatient, the atmosphere was frosty at best. Clearly there’s something Draco desperately needed to say but, gentleman he is, wouldn’t, till the tea was ready.
“Thankyou!” He sighed dramatically, and Harry could see that he'd reverted to the new version of Draco: charming and easy going?
Ron stared, and Hermione gaped. Harry hadn’t been planning to tell them this, but it had come out as something to say. The silence became unbearable and Harry could feel the pressure on his chest as it got heavier and heavier. He's about to carry on when...
The only thing that struck Harry as strange that evening was the appearance of Neville at the end of the meal. He sat down next to Harry and smiled sheepishly, pushing his glasses up on his head.
‘What I’m saying is that, er, we miss you, we don’t agree with Ron and would really love it if you came to our party on Saturday evening? Itll be in the Room of Requirement, if we can find it, but we can let you know! Obviously you three are invited aswell’ He added quicky looking round at Draco, Pansy and Blaise. Harry’s head span,
Harry watched as he brushed the powdery rosin away with a soft cloth and strapped it in to the case. Again the love and care was evident in not only Draco’s playing but in the softness with which he handled the violin, as though it was a young child he cared for.
Draco straightened up and laughed, ducking Harry’s punch. He settled back down and grabbed Harry’s essay.
. I’m sorry, but when you were eleven Ron, you were most worried about what it was for dinner or your potions homework. It’s like I’ve had a tiny monster on my back, directing my life, not letting me choose how to end each year, how to end my life. I’ve never been allowed to be normal!” He sat back, breathless and realised he'd been shouting, the rawness in his throat a painful reminder;
'Well, if you must know, I'm more of a classical music man myself' Draco flushed at looked at Harry, abashed but truthfully.
‘Don’t be, I’m just glad you’re awake Draco’. He puffs his cheeks as he slumps back down on his own bed. ‘You were screaming blue murder for about ten minutes and then you just stopped. You started whispering and rocking back and forth.’
“I’m sorry, I just didn’t think that this would be your ideal situation either? You know?” He stated, reasoning that he probably wasn’t high on Draco's bff list.
‘I hope you liked it, it was a little dodgy especially at the beginning but-’ He was cut off as Harry leapt up from the floor, shaking his head.
Harry lay back and looked at the slightly curved ceiling above me. Their room being in the old astronomy tower meant the turrets became ceilings and the wide sweeping vistas became commonplace. Draco had moved into the space at the end of their beds and was fussing with a black padded thing at the end of his violin. Blimey, no wonder he didn’t know any real music he thought, his anti-muggle upbringing was really showing with a stark clarity. Obviously, the Malfoys respected the muggle classical composers more than modern bands and singers. Or maybe Tchaikovsky wasn’t a muggle after all, Harry mused, it wasn’t as though he knew much about it and the music had created its own kind of magic whilst it was playing. He wasn’t sure what to expect, whether Draco’s slightly abashed confidence was misplaced was yet to be seen.
‘Oh dear,’ He made a mocking sad face, ‘Is our charms genius having a little trouble with his essay? Does he need big clever Draco to sort it out?’
‘Well, see you there!’ He waved, beamed, and walked jauntily out of the hall, joining Luna by the door, who also waved back at Harry.
Draco stared nervously and chewed his lip. God, Harry was going to think he was an even bigger loser than he already was.
edit: re-writing this, so just to clear up it wil change from third person to one of the characters first person perspective when i want to show a scene in more than one way xoxo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first week flew by with barely a hitch. Harry sat with Draco, Blaise and Pansy for lunches and dinners, keenly aware of Ron staring daggers and Hermione taking small concerned looks over her shoulder.
‘Draco, that was beautiful I loved every second of it.’ Harry looked at Draco with such an open, earnest expression that he had to look away and choke back the emotion rising to his throat.
“Hannah Abbott and Padma Patel” not quite as enthusiastic, but maybe a newly cautious friendship is good?
. I was sent to the Dursleys because I played a part in ‘the downfall of Voldemort’. I went to Hogwarts and every single year, ever since I was
“How could you think that? Of course…” Draco was the one to trail off this time, he stopped himself as though he was about to reveal something deep and well hidden. “Anyway, I daresay we’ll…we’ll rub along.”
“That I could hear? You only went ten paces Potter” He looked at his feet and Harry felt a pang of pity.
‘Don’t worry about it Harry. I’ll tell you in the morning’ he says weakly. ‘Thankyou for the chocolate, I um, I really appreciate it.’
Their new-found friendship is tested amongst plans and concealment. Harry is left thoroughly confused.
‘Tomorrow?’ A wheedling tone appeared, and Harry could feel Hermione melt, she could never really refuse Ron.
Ugh. Stupid Potter. Idiotic Potter. Why did he have to shower straight away? I’m still lying face down on my bed when I hear a knock at the door and an impatient voice call;
He’s balanced on the front step, rocking on his heels as he watches the traffic go by. Curls tousled in the wind, wand sticking out of his back pocket. He spins round at the click of the door and stuck out a hand, which Harry took.
‘Hermione, stop, I only said it because I care about Harry!’ He tried to justify himself, a slightly desperate note in his voice, ‘I don’t know what I would say, please don’t make me not yet!’
The voice changes and its my mothers, no my fathers, no wait…im being shaken side to side, pitching forward and backwards like a ship in a storm and then…
Harry stared and took in the tender way Draco held and handled the violin, turning it over in his long dexterous hands, plucking the strings and lifting it to his shoulder to tune.
They sat like that for a while, nibbling their way through Every Favour beans and a couple more frogs. The whistle blew, signaling the approach to Hogwarts, but neither boy had their robes on, let alone any room for the welcome feast.
“You’ve fallen out with Ron and Hermione, haven’t you?” He asked quietly as though afraid to upset Harry again.
Instead he hugs Harry. Draco Malfoy. Hard. Not a cursory sorry-for-that hug but a real I’m-here-for-you hug. And honestly? That was what he really needed. He pulls away and looks Harry in the eye.
“well, ah,” Harry started “I dunno” He's not really sure where this sudden willingness to talk came from, but Hermione is giving the two hopeful looks as they tiptoe around each other.
“Just that you look tired but now you ask I’d say, exhausted and,” he took a breath, “look, can I come inside?”
“Merlin’s beard Pansy, give it a rest?” Blaise scoffed and helped himself to pie from the suddenly full plates. “anyway, you know he’s gay.”
‘Sorry, just your face at the thought of actually contacting the devil’ he snickered again but composed himself at the hurt expression on Harry’s face. ‘He didn’t actually sell his soul to the devil, people just wanted a way to explain his ridiculous talent. But you never know, he could have been a wizard.’
‘No, I’d like that too!’ I’m quick to reassure him, even if I don’t know quite why myself. ‘As you might have noticed I’m severely lacking in that department this year.’
I strip off in the bathroom and hop in the shower. Every time I talk to Potter, I make a complete hash of it. Every time. I catch sight of my left arm I die inside a little. The scars crosshatching the grotesquely elegant snake have done nothing whatsoever to hide the abomination that mars my skin. Sometimes I feel I know what my father went through, hiding the black strokes of dark magic from the world. Whether that was with regret at what he had done I will never know. Not now. I wrap a towel round my head, turban style, and make my way out into the dorm where Harry is sprawled out on his bed, eyes shut. I tiptoe around him, grabbing my pajamas and returning to the bathroom, but he opens on eye looks at me lazily and says,
It’s a statement rather than a question and Harry knows that he doesn’t understand. Ron has Hermione. He had someone to worry about him and for him to worry about. Harry doesn’t know what to say. Hermione is hissing in Ron's ear, no doubt scolding him for
? Not, that I got any choice in the matter. No qualifications for me. No! I couldn’t because yet again, Dumbledore didn’t mean for it to pan out like that. Neither of you get, that I had nothing worth living for. There was nothing, nobody to make me get up, so eventually? I stopped trying. I stopped getting up. I stopped cooking because I wasn’t going to eat it. I just shut down for a bit. It took me so long to get out of the door this morning. I wasn’t going to come, I asked for assistance to get to Hogwarts, did you know? I didn’t trust myself.
'Yeah, so sorry, its a potions detention' Draco said with exaggerated regret, 'blasted boy needs to learn not to explode cauldrons, its really delaying the whole potion making process'
“neither of you know how limp I feel. Like a marionette with no puppeteer. Dumbledore left me with nothing after I’d fulfilled my role; all my life he’d trained me,
He pulled out the Marauders Map and began tracing the names of his friends. Ron and Hermione were in the common room McGonagall has organised for eighth years. It was warm and cosy with a roaring fire and a kettle hanging above it for tea now that the weather was turning. Draco was walking down the stairs towards the library, and with a start Harry saw he was accompanied by Luna and Neville. Draco was civil enough with them but was by no means their friend. Harry quickly scanned the map for signs of Blaise and Pansy and was startled to see Pansy with Dean and Seamus and Blaise’s tiny flag with Padma, Parvati, Lavender and Cho in a tight circle.
He nodded, walked to the end of his bed, watched Harry lie back once again - eyes open this time - and began to play.
Harry felt a soft glimmer of love in his chest as he remembered that whilst Ron and Hermione might be his closest friends, they were not his only ones.
'Oooh what's this then' He pulled himself up on to one elbow, looking eagerly at the record in Draco's hands.
“If they’re still angry just come back here, yeah?” Draco called after Harry as he made his way down the narrow corridor.
Harry looked slightly mollified as they sat down at the Slytherin table with Blaise and Pansy and began helping himself to mashed potato. Whilst his eating habits had improved, he still had a tendency to pass food surreptitiously to Draco when it got a bit much. So far Blaise and Pansy hadn’t noticed and if they had they hadn’t said anything.
‘…you should never have said that Ronald and you know it!’ Harry sat back, suddenly anxious to not be found eavesdropping. She sounded so angry, and Harry wondered what Ron had done this time. He was obviously the castigated recipient of Hermione’s wrath and their proximity to Harry made him panic that it was something to do with him.
'I'm not really sure but definitely at least 400 years or so.' He held it up, inspecting the varnish and letting the firelight cast a golden hue over the instrument.
“So, who’d have thought it, our lord and saviour, hanging with the snakes.” Pansy leered and looks at Zabini and Draco, who didn’t return her grin. “Oh, come on, now he’s here can’t we have a laugh at him?”
To feel that fire and to see it in someone else's eyes is an entirely different experience. He had only just met this girl and she wants him to climb into a fountain with her. This would be an odd request from anyone much less a stranger. "I'd much rather my trousers don't get wet-" He starts but she shakes her head and sloshes a step closer to the edge to look at him closely. Then with a nod she drops herself into the fountain, water sloshing at the waist of her dress. "I've fallen in and need saving" she states as if this is a simple fact. "What kind of man wouldn't save his betrothed?" She asks and at that he can't help but smile. All he really needed was an excuse and she'd gladly given him one. So before he can think better of it he climbs in with her the cold water quickly soaking into his shoes.
"And I'm sure her dowry is very impressive!" Draco huffs, and their silence was only confirmation. It didn't matter who she was or whether or not they're compatible, all that matters is that she was from a rich family pureblood family and has a big dowry. There was so much anger growing inside him that he was tempted to throw something across the room and his father's ash tray was within reach. But instead he turned, storming out of the office and fumed his way through the halls.
Draco couldn't retain much during the class. It felt like everyone was watching him and every so often he would get distracted by Harry painting and repainting his nameplate. To his horror they were assigned to paint portraits of their deskmate, meaning Harry. He was near pounding his head in the table. As soon as class was over he took his things and bolted for the door. Two hours of curse breaking was exactly the distraction he needed. He could focus on problems right in front of him instead of worrying about anything or anyone.
"He's been buzzed since noon." Goyle said with a small laugh and Blaise grabbed a coaster off the table and chucked it at him. It missed by half a foot without even a flinch from Goyle. Blaise sunk back into his chair sulking.
fault that they just got their incorrect information from the prophet like everyone else." She is smirking and he shakes his head "You're kind of a genius and truly just so very slytherin." And she beams at him "Thank you!" She says happily then stands from the table to go to class.
"I understand that many of you have faced some difficulties," Draco almost wants to laugh at what an understatement this is. "But it is my job as your headmistress to guide you toward a better future. Setting in place sorely needed structure to aid all of you in the wake of such troubled times." She continues on to talk about the investigation that the ministry has launched within hogwarts, how they plan to reform the school, the safety precautions they will be adding to the school. It all sounds wonderful, but it is difficult to extricate the truth from her words.
But as luck would have it just ad he reaches the doors to the kitchens a hand clasps around his shoulder. Dread settles in his stomach but he plasters on a neutral which is truly as chipper as he can manage as he turns to face his father. "Pansy Parkinson has just arrived, you're  to be a gentleman to her" He says adjusting Draco's tie. "This is an important arrangement for our families. It will keep our bloodline pure and it will be good for business." At this Draco wants to spit back a protest. He wants to ask if that is all he is worth? How long has this been planned without his knowledge? But instead he simply says "Yes father" quietly.
"Then take it off!" Pansy huffs and Draco splutters for a moment before Crabbe cuts in. "He could be dying and he wouldn't do that, he's too much of a prude." He says laughing and Draco scowls at him which only makes him laugh more.
He closes his door with a sigh and everything grows silent. If he simply stayed in his room he could pretend that none of this was happening. But the clothes laid out on his bed refuse to let him forget who he was and the obligations he had to his family. He lifts the coat looking over the fine silk lining the inside. He touches it gently running his thumb along the seam. They're truly beautiful clothes and it's a shame that they're going to be marred by such a gruesome occasion.
When he isn't making potions then he's reading about potions. Even on the weekend he shuts himself away in the dorm. And even though his mother refuses to share whatever her plan is he forces himself to follow along. He even tries to smile from time to time. It truly doesn't come naturally to him.
"Bet your parents love that idea." Pansy says sarcastically and Crabbe laughs "Haven't told em, they're gonna lose it though."
as Harry's fists collide with the dummy, then again. Draco peers over his textbook, which is definitely a mistake. His mouth grows suddenly dry as he stares at Harry.
"You're supposed to smile in pictures" He says looking up at Draco then down at his picture as he furiously starts erasing something. "That's kind of the whole reason Mona Lisa is famous"
As he went back to his room he wondered if she had ever considered running away. Though even if she had there's no chance she would ever admit to it. He quickly changes out of his wet clothes and into a another suit. It's just as stiff and uncomfortable but it won't draw attention to himself. Just as he's throwing on his cloak he hears his door open and is unsurprised to see Blaise slip inside. He is grinning "What a perfect diversion!" He whispers delighted and it makes Draco smile. It wasn't intended to be a diversion but it's genius nonetheless. "Everything is ready, we should head out before anyone comes looking for you." He says peeking out into the hall just to be sure he wasn't followed.
"Are you alright dear?" Draco's head snaps up suddenly alert, ready to fight at the drop of a pin. But Madam Pomfrey is looking at him worriedly and he swallows down his anger and all the emotions within himself. He lets his expression glaze over to a cool neutrality and says as evenly as he can manage "I'm fine, thank you." Though his voice catches on the last word he turns to flee.
He's unsure of how long he's been there when he hears the sound of footsteps rushing down the hall. Promptly is hands are pushed away and instead a spell is cast to take over for him. He looks up at the small crowd that was gathered around them. Madam Pomfrey casts another spell to carefully levitate her off of he ground.
He should be rethinking his plan to run away, but the more thought he puts into it the more he's sure of his decision. Splashing water over his face he looks at his reflection in the mirror for a moment. He is tempted to muss his hair but his mother would fuss about it for at least an hour if she saw him. There's no need to draw unnecessary attention to himself anyways. He brushes it back then goes to pack his things.
They would often bring him tales of wild nights and misadventures in an attempt to make him join in on their shenanigans. Crabbe would speak of a girl he nearly bed, and Goyle would speak of the wine and dancing he'd missed, while Blaise would weave a tale of some fantastical near miss with death or the law. In all honesty it was tempting, sometimes he wished they wouldn't tell him these stories if only to spare him the slow and agonizing passage of his youth. It felt like he was living vicariously through them, yet missing every opportunity to have adventures for himself.
"We'll need commoners clothes to fit in. Even royals don't dress to their station when at Potter's." Pansy says trying to yank off another portion of her petticoat but after accidentally jabbing Goyle several times she gives up.
He pulls it out for a moment then sets it in front of Pomfrey. "A pepper up potion, I don't think I'll be needing it." He says and she looks at him with a surprised expression that shifts into something softer and more fond, the way his mother would look at him when he was young. "Thank you Draco." She says with a smile. He starts to open his mouth to correct her, there are very few people that he lets call him by his first name, but he stops and looks at her for a moment before simply saying "You're welcome" then turning to head off to class.
He's trying to block it out as he looks over a little booklet that makes no sense at all. And that is when Harry takes a seat at the piano. Draco's eyes flicker up and as soon as he starts playing, the music seems to hit him in the chest. It's soft and slow and it doesn't sound at all like a wizard's piano. Something about Harry playing it makes it sound different than anything he has ever heard. Inexplicably his heart picks up and his eyes are glued to Harry.
He ties up the letter and it feels as though a weight has lifted off of his chest. Though that weight slams back down on him when he hears the door behind him open. It's too early, surely class hasn't let out yet. But when he turns Harry is standing in the doorway. He can already feel the anger rolling off of him and he grips the letter in one hand and his wand in the other. "Potter" He says tersely hoping for their normal uncomfortable greeting.
He's always been able to avoid muggle studies. Every single year his parents would find a way to get him out of it, which was welcomed at the time. But this year she'd said "The dark lord is truly dead, so you have to win the trust of the mudbloods." She left no room for argument as she continued. "You need to understand them if you ever intend to use them." Which as foreboding as it may sound made absolute sense to Draco. If their name is to rise again then he'll have to play nice with muggleborns to get there. Though, it feels wrong that she was the one pushing him toward muggle subjects when for years his parents forbid him from so much as thinking about anything muggle. As a child he didn't even believe that they existed. He'd never even had more than a minute of conversation with a muggle as far as he knew. Though this had once been a source of pride it now only feels like a detriment to him.
"It's how I was raised." He says feeling the need to defend himself. Harry shakes his head and sighs seeming disappointed.
She simply nods silently, the shy smile returning to her face and together they leave the crowd. The garden is lit by fairies who emit a shimmering white light. And against the dim lights he can see her smile once again fall away. If they were to marry she would clearly be just as miserable as him. If only they could be happy, or at the very least accept their unhappiness their lives would be far easier.
"They'll think you did it Draco." She says quietly. He silently hesitates but he can feel her pulse thrumming against his fingertips. Just as much as he can't bring himseld to kill anyone letting someone die when he could potentially keep them alive seem just as awful. "Just go." He says to her moving to do chest compression which he has only tried twice both times failing. He hears Pansy run off as he starts even though he's unsure if he's doing it right. She makes no move as he continues and if it weren't for her pulse he would be convinced that she is already dead. She has that same glassy eyed far away look that corpses have. It is eerily familiar to see someone looking straight through him instead of at him but he can't look at her eyes.
Draco glares at Ginny, deciding to ignore Luna entirely. He so desperately wants to argue but he bites his tongue. It only takes a minute of halting conversation as the group tries to get around revealing anything with Draco in earshot before they give up and cast a muffliato. He can't help but be curious and he finds himself continually glancing over toward them. He caught the top of one of the many papers to read The Hogwarts Journal followed be in decipherable handwriting.
With one hand he reaches out and yanks at the pins holding his cloak in place. It immediately flies behind him floating through the air behind him. Then he sets to ripping out the pins along his shirt the sleeves flapping in the wind. "I was only joking! Draco! Quit it!" Goyle says looking shocked as he looks back to see the fabric drifting down to the ground.
“I just want to grab my stuff, and I’ll be out of your way” he hurried to the rack and grabbed his trunk, flipped open the lid and grabbed his robes.
Harry stumbled down the corridor, vision blurred, in search of an empty compartment. He wasn't paying attention to where he was going, so when he ran headfirst in to Draco Malfoy carrying a cup of coffee, they both went down, sprawling across the musty carpet of the train aisle. The burning coffee spilt all down Harry's front and the pain made him yell out. He lifted himself up off the floor and offered Draco a hand up. He took it and they stood, quietly in the corridor.
“oh yeah because its been so hard for you hasn’t it? Oh yeah, that whole year you spent camping? A whole year? Really, Ron? Because I remember you going home for at least half of it because, as you said it’s a
Sirius Black is an ex-convict, a number one escaped fugitive who is so dangerous that he wrangled out of the most secure prisons in the world by transforming into a dog, and simultaneously sings to Madonna at nights when he’s lonely.
Primarily though, it had made him angry. They had known this would be a particularly hard summer for him, especially given that Ron and Hermione would spend most of it together. He was angry that they hadn’t even taken the time to write their best friend a letter, send it through. Harry had briefly wondered whether Dobby had stepped in again, but as the elf was no longer tethered to the Malfoys, he would probably have no idea about nefarious happenings at Hogwarts the next year and was unlikely to interrupt his mail.
He’s gloriously 15 years old, well into his teenage years, but definitely not following the ordinary life of a teen. Harry had seemed to miss out on a lot of the things deemed appropriate for teens, like casual first relationships, and had skipped straight to the death-defying confrontations with the most powerful villain in the Wizarding world who had a personal vendetta against him. Yeah, not exactly a normal kid - not even for a wizard.
Sirius was hauling Harry’s suitcase up the slight hill, then put it down, swore lightly and checked for no passerbys. There were none, and Sirius whispered one of the first spells Harry had been taught - Wigardium Leviosa. Still echoed the laughs and giggles of First Year, before he’d even been friends with Hermione. Before he’d faced Voldemort at 11, and then 12, and then 14. Before discovering he had a godfather. Only just after discovering he was a wizard.
“You fooled me,” Harry mutters. They’re walking along Privet Drive in the most inconspicuous way possible. It is likely Uncle Vernon is still peering out the window to make sure they look normal enough, or one of the neighbours is spying. So they mustn’t do anything out of order, not until they’re in a secluded place. “I didn’t think you liked Transfiguration much.”
.” Sirius ruffles a hand through his hair, completely messing it up from his ministry persona. It’s weird to see what are obviously Sirius’ emotions through a face that just isn’t Sirius. Now he actually looks at his godfather, he can see the clothes don’t quite fit, and the badge on his lapel is slightly skewed. If he’d just looked at him, he’d have been able to tell that that was not Sirius.
This was what happened when Harry was left alone, without school to occupy his brain - his thoughts turned dark. So he continued packing, and thought of Quidditch, because that often managed to take his brain off things.
He snapped out of his reverie as Sirius was saying something about how nice it was to get fresh air when they walked along the forested path. “Hey - hey! You shouldn’t have come yourself! You’re in hiding Sirius, there are manhunts for you, especially now. It’s dangerous for you to even be transfigured.” Seeing Sirius had made all the complaints about being stuck in the house pale away, he’d just been transfixed by his presence at the door. “You could have got someone else — Remus, maybe — to come and get me.”
Hedwig takes the scrap to Sirius, disappearing into the night, and he sits and watches his owl become just a speck in the distance before finally resting his head and dreaming of a month of freedom with one of his favourite people in the world.
Grey eyes haunt his dreams, flashes of them which make him squirm uncomfortably, as well as Voldemort’s laugh and the kicker: Cedric’s death, over and over again. So many variations, all ending in Harry crying over his body, before another flash of unknown grey eyes, saying nothing but everything at the same time, and then he shoots awake with a shiver, at four in the morning, suddenly cold to the bone and thinking of the boy he watched die right in front of him.
The anecdote about his father, James Potter was something only a few people did. Most had either never met his parents, only the memory of them, and some adults couldn’t face telling the orphaned boy stories about the young couple. Of course, he’d been told some tales by his Potions Professor - Snape - that were rather negative in tone. Another benefit of Sirius being around, as well as the exuberant energy. He always had good tales up his sleeve, ones that shone his dad in such a positive light and made Harry ache for his parent’s presence. He’d seen them, last June…when he was fighting Vol-
“Harry, Harry,” The man punches him playfully in the shoulder. “It’s been a while.” There’s a swift change in demeanour, back to the guy who could almost be Sirius in his movements, and it takes him two seconds to realise that the American twang has quite simply dropped.
“No, Sir. We’ll take the boy off your hands for the summer and deliver him to school in September, no trouble at all. We don’t, after all, want him to be let loose.” Surely the Ministry wouldn’t keep him locked there, all summer? No - surely they would put him up in the Leaky Cauldron like in Third Year, when Fudge had visited him after the Aunt Marge incident. Harry wouldn’t just be shut in an office watching wizards come and go everywhere whilst Fudge shot him question after question.
Harry has always seemed out of reach. He was always too noble, too honest, too brave. But he can see the small smile turning up his lips and he can feel his own face growing hot. He swallows, quickly looking away but his eyes continue to flicker back. He can feel himself smiling but he can't stop it. Even if he could, he wouldn't really want to. He doesn't have the words to explain why his heart is beating so erratically or why he's smiling but it feels right.
"Do you really think being expected to save the wizarding world didn't come with pressure?" Harry spit back back at him suddenly matching Draco's anger.
As he walks back he takes several wrong turns, most of them intentionally to waste time. If he has to deal with the golden trio right now he might just pull out his own hair. With the approaching curfew there are only a few people scattered about the halls and he walks by them swiftly hoping not to be recognized. When he arrives back at his dorm thankfully the room is empty. He can hear the shower running in the attached bathroom and he sighs with relief. He falls onto his bed happy to be alone even for a short time. He stares up at the ceiling and takes a moment to breathe.
He watches Harry over the top of his book as he pulls something out of his trunk. Then he quickly uses a spell enlarging it to reveal a training dummy. He starts pushing things around to make a bit more room and Draco wants to ask why but talking to Harry casually is probably the last thing he should be doing. Harry hasn't so much as looked his direction but the spite and anger he can feel in the room is overwhelming. He waits until Harry has stowed his wand in the pocket of his trousers before he takes a breath in, steadying himself to speak.
"I'm not sure, it wasn't any hexes that I know of." He says and Pansy is quiet for a moment. "Who do you think hexed her?" She asks but he knows the real meaning behind her words. An innate fear that has prickled in the back of his mind from time to time as well. "It wasn't him, you know that just as well as I do. We watched the dark lord die." She nods quietly then sighs and rests her head against his shoulder.
Strangely Draco doesn't see Harry or any of his friends in any of his classes. It should feel like a reprieve but instead it feels as though one of them will pop out from around a corner. He can't help but feel he'll be ambushed and accused of something heinous. Harry has always been suspicious of him in the past, though it was normally warranted. The thought brings him no comfort.
"Meaning you were bigoted" Harry says in far too casual tone. It takes him by surprise and Harry watches him with a calculating gaze. He can't help but squirm uncomfortably. It's strange to think about his beliefs and how harmful they have been. He wants to hold on to his family's values but the undeniable truth is that they are rooted in pureblood supremacy.
"The Weaslette has always had a temper." He says with a dry laugh "At least it wasn't Granger." He says with a shrug, and Pansy chuckles looking back at Draco. "I wouldn't want her to punch me" She says laughing and Draco sighs in exasperation. "That was ONE TIME!" He huffs but Pansy continues to laugh.
that was just friendly rivalry?" She asks incredulously. He stares at her a moment ".....Yes?" He says slowly beginning to feel unsure himself. She gives him a pointed look and his brain seems to sluggishly click things into place. "Oh god...I...I've liked him the whole time" He says horrified as he thinks over the last few years. All the times they've fought and the way his heart would race whenever Harry was around. It's easy to pretend that it's anger, hate, maybe even fear, because having a crush is pretty forgein to him. It seems to mundane, such s simple and pure thing that is oh so dangerous.
"I don't think so, just trust me." Draco says and Blaise sighs shaking his head. "I didn't realize under all of that pompous attitude you were hiding a complete lunatic" He laughs and Draco can't help but laugh with him Then at the end of the hall they catch up to Pansy and he points her to the left where the door that lead out onto the stables await them. "Is it Potter's party that we're going to?" Pansy asks entirely giddy as they push through the doors.
"The best way to learn about art, is to make it. Any materials you need will be in the cupboards along the walls. Everyone has five minutes to gather their materials. While you make your name plates we'll be learning about one of the most famous names in muggle art." Says the professor who Draco has only just noticed has a colorful nameplate of her own reading Professor Fletcher. She waves everyone over to the cupboards as messes with a black box on her desk. Draco stubbornly refuses to acknowledge Harry as he gets up and goes to the cupboards.
"What do you mean? What are they planning?" Draco asked confused and annoyed that they aren't listening to his refusals.
He can feel his panic rising as the centaurs close in on him and he searches for an opening. Then for a split second, there it is. He dives forward pushing past them and he scrambles across the ground to avoid their stamping hooves. He runs for the thickest of the trees hoping it will slow them down in their pursuit. He weaves between the trees his eyes scanning the ground for rocks and roots that could trip him again.
That’s strangely comforting to know, that I’m not the only one being driven mad by memories, and flashbacks. No, not even memories, cruel fabrications planted in my mind by months of revisiting the warped version of the war I experienced. Dreams where Hermione is attacked by Bellatrix except, in this version, she doesn’t make it out alive; mudblood isn’t confined to her arm, its scrawled across her cheeks, her belly, her thighs and chest. Her corpse is dropped at Shell Cottage – the starter for another nightmare, where Bill and Fleur’s home is compromised all because of him.
“No thanks, I’ll let Harry come in his own time, actually.” She smiles grimly and turns down the corridor. The doors almost shut when I hear,
“HARRY, COME O-” she stops abruptly as I wrench the door open. “uh, Malfoy, sorry I didn’t realise, er…”
‘If you knew what it was supposed to sound like, you wouldn’t be saying that,’ He laughed and strode to the door, ‘Come on, its dinner time’
When I remerge from the bathroom, Harry is in bed, glasses off, squinting at a crusty old parchment. He’s absorbed completely and doesn’t seem to notice me putting my stuff away in the various drawers, sliding my violin discreetly under the bed.
‘I’ll see you in our room’ Draco called over his shoulder as he vanished up the staircase to the astronomy tower.
He laughed nervously but Ron just shook his head and stalked out of the compartment, robes swishing behind him.
She nodded and looked away, “I’ll go and find him ok? Make sure you’re changed by the time we arrive though!”
He got up and marched to the front of the hall, aiming to find McGonagall and get to his room fast as possible. However is seemed that wouldn't be happening, because it feels like he's emerged in to a vacuum as soon as he stepped out of the Great Hall. People are stood on all the stairways and in the classrooms, watching the waiting 8th years as they waited, apprehensively.
They passed the meal talking about this and that, laughing as Blaise tipped peas all over the floor and into the pockets of Pansy’s robes causing her to whip out her wand and spell his hair a violent acid green.
‘Fuck sakes Potter!’ Draco’s words are slurred as he raises his head. ‘what’s with the open window? Its September? Do you want me to freeze to death?’ he slides out of bed and promptly slams the window shut. I’m reminded of Pansy as he slinks back in to bed and buries his head under the duvet.
“hmm, sure” Draco looked at him appraisingly and grabbed Harry's wrist, pulling him in to the closest compartment. He sat Harry down and started rummaging in his trunk for a tissue.
Harry carried the laden tray to the coffee table and found that Draco had already made a space, piling the dusty magazines and doodles neatly in to stacks on the floor.
“What the hell Harry?” Ron got up and braced himself against the luggage rack, looming over Harry, anger written all over his face. “Don’t you think we all felt like that a little? Don’t you? And we didn’t hide away in our fucking mansions? Did we huh? DID WE?” He’s right up close, and his breath was hot in Harry's eyes. Hermione stood and grabbed the back of Ron's shirt pulling him down with a scared look but he’s not bloody finished.
‘Hey scarface’ Draco said, plonking himself down in the seat opposite, placing his violin on the floor and scattering sheets of music all over the table.
“I ran in to Malfoy, with some coffee, er…and he mopped me up and gave me a couple plasters.” Harry wished he didn’t sound so awkward and false, “who knew coffee could give you third degree burns eh?”
He walks past me into the bathroom unbuttoning his pyjama top, the picture of efficiency. I barely have time to nod before I hear the shower turn on and the Draco Malfoy Morning Routine began. I’ve never seen anything so well-organised. Whilst I am a get-up-with-plenty-of-time to take it slow, Draco had his mornings down to a fine art, with no room for distraction.
He wrote. Stopped. Ate a chocolate frog. Wrote a bit more. Then heard animated whispering approaching from behind the shelves. Harry’s ears pricked, and he listened in, not caring if it was interesting – just that it was a distraction. However, he could hear Hermione’s voice scolding and low and someone’s chastised response.
Harry sat back in the squeaky leather of the car on the way to Kings Cross. The tightening feeling in his chest got heavier and heavier the closer they got. When he had recieved the letter, inviting him back to finish his last year properly, he didn’t reply for weeks. The follow up letter from McGonagall was full of
The Weasleys were stood about 10 feet from him, bag and baggage gathered round them. Harry looked round desperately for Draco, but of course he’s gone, melted in to the crowd of people like a mirage. 'I shouldn't expect him to mother me' Harry chastised himself angrily. Pulling his coat closer to hide the now oversized shirt, he began to make his way towards them. Over the heads of his siblings Ron spots him and begins to push his way through, dragging Hermione with him.
Hermione had called at their room again a few days earlier to try and talk to Harry, but he had promptly shut himself in the bathroom shaking his head vehemently at Draco as he answered the door.
He was lost in thought when Hermione poked Harry in the ribs, pointed to the laden tables and grinned. He smiled weakly and looked away before his face betrayed his feelings. With no appetite, and having not eaten properly for months on end, too much food at once would probably make him sick.
‘No problem Draco, help yourself anytime, you know where to find it’, I’m not really sure why I said that but it’s not like I don’t mean it. I guess. But it is strange that my subconscious is inviting a known deatheater to rummage around in my personal belongings, but, nothing this year is really going to plan so…
“Well, you shouldn’t be” Draco muttered darkly, pushed away from the table and strode out of the hall. They watched him go and Zabini follows, shaking his head at Parkinson who just rolled her eyes. And just like that, Harry is alone again.
He trudged his way through Monday’s potions, charms and herbology and sat in the library, at his usual table, surrounded by books, quills and empty chocolate frog wrappers. He began to wonder what exactly this was all leading to. Did he actually want to become an Auror, given his response in the last six months. His subjects didn’t necessarily confine him to that, and he’d always had an interest in healing maybe? He shook his head and returned to the charms essay in front of him. It had evaded him all afternoon and bringing it down to the library in the vague hope that inspiration might strike proved pointless. He looked around idly, hoping Draco might appear, violin slung over shoulder clutching a pile of confusing sheet music but nothing.
Harry is leaning over me, hair framing his face, no glasses and desperation written across his face. I have the strangest urge to kiss him.
“Thanks? Uh, Potter, straight?” He blushed and looked down as Draco raised an eyebrow. “for now, at least”
Draco snorted and began pointing at the top of the sheet. ‘Sheet music, it’s like instructions of what to play. So the numbers mean the time signature and those symbols are…’ he rose up and twisted round to get a better look, bracing himself with a strong arm next to Harry’s resting elbow. ‘Sharps and flats, the key signature so I know what kind of notes I guess. And the actual shapes on the line show the value. Minims and crotchets and the like.’
“I don’t really think that Draco Malfoy is the best roommate for me?” he ventured, not quite meeting her eye.
to learn myself – so the curls bounce on top in an endearing mop on his head, nothing too crazy, just like when he came to pick me up. A spritz of cologne, a pair of beautiful leather brogues laced magically, and he’s ready to go all within the 6 minutes he had left himself.
He was assigned his room first and dismissed from the great hall and he waited anxiously for his roommate, still holding out hope that it might be one of his friends. But  as soon as Potter walked into the his heart sunk. There was an immediate palpable tension in the air. His fingers itch to grab his wand, to strike first, but he holds back. Harry hasn't attacked him and he can't act as rashly as he has in the past. Without his family's power behind him he has to tread carefully.
"Take your time and write your name, I've got to get to know everyone. And don't worry it doesn't have to be perfect. Mistakes are a part of the journey." She says her smile never wavering as she looks at him which is strange. Normally he'd sense at least a bit of scorn, but she seems excessively chipper.
He looks down at the girl then to the headmistress "Why did you bring me here?" He asks feeling his chest constrict slightly around the words. Mcgonagall looks at him for a moment longer. "This is a warning and an extended hand. Dumbledore told me before his death-" Draco flinches slightly at the mention of dumbledore but Mcgonagall continues. "He told me that after the war is over and Voldemort is dead that there are still battles to be won. This," She says gesturing to Mary who hasn't opened her eyes nor moved a muscle. "Is one of those battles. I am asking regardless of whether you were or were not a part of this attack, what do you value and what side are you on? That is entirely your decision."
The others go silent for a moment then break out in cheers. Draco smiles slightly. If he's going to be married then at the very least he can go out with a bang. Blaise sits down with a mischievous gleam in his eye. "We'll use the ball as a cover!" He exclaims then quickly quiets himself to a whisper leaning in close. "If we slip out near the end people will be too drunk to notice" the rest of them lean in close. "How long will we be going for? We'll have to get everything ready" Goyle says nearly vibrating with excitement. They look to Draco and he shakes his head "I don't intend to come back" he hadn't even realized this was his plan until he says it but once it comes out it feels right. "At least not if I'm to marry a stranger" his friends look at him with shocked expressions.
“Eighth years!” Professor McGonagall looked down from on high as she addressed the motley crew of eighth year returnees. “As you may well have noticed, there are so few of you this year, that I have taken the decision to merge the houses for your final year. This means you will be placed in to rooms of two this year.” Her last few words were swallowed by a sudden outbreak of muttering.
“Who was that?” I spin around to find Harry, dripping on the carpet, glasses steamed up, with a bath towel round his waist – his protruding ribs reminding me how bad he's gotten. Gone is the soft but very visible strength from his quidditch training days.
Harry stood at the bottom, bewildered and alone and wondered how they had got there quite so fast. Still, as he made his way to the Great Hall, if he gave Draco some space it would all be ok he was sure of it. What with Ron and Draco and Neville it was proving to be a very confusing day for Harry.
“Yeah well, its one way to die isn’t it?” Harry can’t look at his face. It would be disappointed and pitying, just like the councillors at St. Mungo’s, just like Hermione’s; and Harry couldnt stand for Draco to see him cry
I slouch up to the door and pause running a hand through my hair, but it gets stuck in the knots, so I give up.
They had been whispering animatedly as they approached but snapped apart as Harry and Draco sat down. Blaise just nodded at Harry as Draco raised his eyebrows in a slight reprimand as Pany began to explain to then just how hard and traumatic doing ancient runes homework was for her.
As Harry walked down to Ron and Hermione he noticed the people stare and somehow, he didn't think it’s because he was in muggle clothing. Coming to a stop Harry could hear the messy noise of kissing and hesitated before he knocked on the door.
Harry needed to do some digging he decided, there was something happening across all the eighth years and he needed to know. If they were planning to ambush him and cross-examine him like Ron had done on the train, then Harry wanted to be ready.
when they came around to help. I shut them out in the hope you'd all forget about me and live your lives; the lives they’d always dreamed of, before Volde-bloody-mort got in the way and they spent last year camping'.
The trunk was sat in the doorway. Harry Potter watched it from the sofa as though wary of attack. It had his whole life, in there one way or another. It was steeped in memories and emotions; good times, bad times, glory and despair. It had been his most prized possession for years. And now it was getting another outing.
“Give me time? I’m trying to help him, really I am” She sniffed and stepped back and wiped her nose on the back of her hand.
‘Ron, you better actually do it,’ a sharp rustle suggested that Hermione had drawn her wand, Harry stifled a laugh as he imagined Ron’s face – it was all he could do to not turn around and watch.
Mafoy looks at him and for a moment Harry think he’s going to leave. 'he’s going to leave, and I’ll be left to get myself to Hogwarts' Harry thinks panic rising in his throat like bile.
‘what’s that?’ I ask after about ten minutes of being ignored. Bleary eyed, clocks me and stuffs the map away out of sight.
“Right then Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter, you’re together!” McGonagall rolled up her parchment and gave them each an over-enthusiastic smile before she quickly walked away, up the stairs. Harry ran after her, knowing that there’s no way a mistake was made, but going all the same.
“Calm down, I’m eating!” Harry berated him, with a grin as Draco looked over at Harry for the hundreth time. Harry relaxed, biting in to his own frog.
I laugh and look up as Draco clenches his jaw and doesn’t say anything as Blaise and Pansy begin arguing over the toast. I’m trying to eat something when Draco nudges my foot under the table and mouths ‘you ok?’ at me. I smile and take a big bite of my toast, chewing and swallowing even as it turns to glue in my mouth. He watches as I finish the slice of toast and gives me a small smile. I’m not sure if he cares or if I just looked a bit green which is quite likely, but as we walk out of the hall he drops a little ‘well done’ into my ear as we all make our way to potions. Ah. So he realises. He knew. Of course he knew. He’s Draco fucking Malfoy and I practically told him on the train.
He felt so uncomfortable. In the dark reflection of the window, he could see his prominent ribs and skinny stomach; nothing compared to the manicured strength of Draco. Harry watched his muscles move through his fitted t-shirt, sliding neatly as he worked on reassembling the bottles on the bench.
Harry had zoned out until he heard, “Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson” accompanied by a shriek of rage and strong muttering as Hermione and Parkinson made their way up to the front.
‘we’re going to be sharing a room Ma-Draco, you don’t need to disappear every time one of us needs to change, and besides,’ he grins, ‘I’m not looking.’
caring about me. I realise that just because I’m back around people, back in Hogwarts that doesn’t immediately erase those feelings and emotions. I swallow hard and sit down in the warmly lit dungeons, so changed from the days of Snape.
They followed, feet shuffling, in a close huddle. Harry had been hoping to slip in without the stares and whispers, but now that was out the window. They troop in to the Great Hall as the last first year was called to be sorted, their footsteps echoed as heads whipped round to watch them come in. As one unit they sit at the back and Harry found himself opposite Draco again. Harry could feel Ron watching his back intently, probably feeling
He got up and wandered round to his side of the room, looking about under his own bed. Draco had owned a vinyl copy of the Sibelius and Tchaikovsky violin concertos for some years now, having found it in a dusty corner of the Malfoy manor, but had never had a record player to play it on. It was a muggle violinist called Kyung Wha Chung with an orchestra called the London Symphony orchestra. Draco had always played the violin but after the war, finding himself at a loose end, he had decided that was what he wanted to do. He listened to muggle radio absorbing as much music as he could, Radio 3 was his permanent soundtrack - but he had never managed to find a place to play his record. He shyly carried it over to Harry, still lying back on the floor and waited for him to open his eyes. They were coming to the end of Moonage Daydream and Harry opened one eye, perhaps to see if Draco was enjoying it, and saw him nervously clutching his record.
Draco blushed a pale pink, colouring his pale cheeks as he pulled the odd shaped thing out and began to undo the clasps.
“How’ve you been? Harry?” Hermione is the first to speak, tentative and cautionary, notes of fear dancing in the air.
Her awkward attempts at conversation all fizzled out, and they passed the journey listening to the soft murmurs of Neville and Luna, and the rattle of the harnesses. Harry's mind turned to the question of rooming for eighth year. They don't have enough of us returning to warrant four different house dorms, but what other alternative werethere?
Draco shook his head and wondered how to explain to Harry that he had always admired Sirius and his complete conviction and genuine love of life despite everything Walburga and Orion had put him through. He settled for a wry smile and settled down on the floor next to Harry as he lay back and closed his eyes. Draco watched him practically drink in the music and wondered how he had ever survived without knowing this beautiful side of the boy who lived.
We reach the Great Hall at the same time as Pansy and Zabini, meaning of course Hermione and Ron are there as well. Ron’s ears are burning red signalling some kind of offense (presumably committed by Zabini) as he rapidly whispers his grievances into Hermione’s sympathetic ear. Zabini on the other hand is the picture of complacency, his dress immaculate as he greets Draco formally. Pansy smiles cautiously at me and then at Hermione as Ron leads her off to the safe retreat of the all-Gryffindor table.
“Why are you doing this for me?” Harry asked him quietly as he drank tea and Draco busied himself clearing the kitchen table and wiping away the dust from the mantlepiece.
‘Thanks Longbottom, that’s really kind and we appreciate it’ He smiled warmly and Neville nodded, getting up, hands in pockets.
'Um, well I've had this record for a really long time now, but I've never, ah had a record player to hear it on and I was wondering, you don't have to say yes, I realise it's not really your style and if you do-' Harry cut him off by tugging it out of his arms, taking Ziggy Stardust off the player, and gently lowering Draco's vinyl on to the player.
The doorbell rang again and this time he answered it. 'I know he’ll look at me with the usual mixture of disdain and something like pity' Harry thought, steeling himself. He let down the chain and pulled the door open.
The journey up to the castle passed in a tense, awkward silence. Ron glowered at Harry from time to time, and ignored him at others. Harry felt bad for Hermione, though; because if there’s anyone who deserved a peaceful eighth year, it was her.
Harry glanced at him and saw that once more; the normally ice-cold Malfoy blushed red and avoided his eye.
I’d sat down in the back corner, not sitting near anyone, just keeping myself to myself. I can see the back of Draco’s head as he turns round trying to find someone. He gives a start and seems to find them as he scoops up his stuff, quill, bag, and books balanced precariously as he navigates the closely packed desks, hips twisting and swaying as he tries to not knock anything over. I don’t clock that it was me he was looking for until his belongings are dumped on the desk next to me and I’m hit in the face with his robe, which is draped from his arm.
He got Harry to stand up and looked at the damage before dabbing various ointments and potions on the harsh red marks. He worked softly and gently, and Harry began to feel relaxed as he pulled out the heat and layered plasters over the worst of it.
"I have to wonder, if she was not hexed there, then where was she hexed? Did her attacker move her body? If so then how did they move her without being seen by others?" She says slowly and Draco nods silently as they reach the doors to the infirmary. "I don't know if you can answer my questions but I would like for you to see her regardless." Then she pushes the door open nodding to Madam Pomfrey as she makes her way to a bed in the back of the room. He can't understand why she wants this, especially if she doesn't think it's him but he follows behind her until she moves aside a curtain to reveal the young witch.
This year Draco packed his schedule full of classes. Everything from alchemy to xylomancy. He'd always expected to simply take after his father when he got out of school. It's not as if he didn't study but when you expect life to be handed to you on a platter you don't put in much effort. He always did just enough work to ensure the grades that were expected of him, nothing more and nothing less. Though it was always quite annoying to find that Granger had better grades than him even when he studied. He'd resigned himself to it a few years into schooling, though it still bothered him.
He goes to clean up the vials and in that moment he realizes that for the first time in a long time that he's happy. It's a conflicted happiness, but happiness nonetheless. When he returns Pomfrey is checking through paperwork. "I need all the help I can get, so as soon as you're cleared to be my apprentice then I want you here at the very least twice a week for several hours." Draco nods looking down at the unconcious boy in bed. "You'll probably see me before then" He says and when she looks up at him she smiles. "I know." And something about it makes him feel a pinch of pride. "You should head to class now" she says and Draco shuffles his feet not really wanting to leave. He shoves his hands into his pockets surprised when he feels his hand brush against a bottle before he remembers he'd made pepper up potion.
After a while he gives up, deciding to go back to his room and try to sleep. He'd have to start classes in the morning and the students are going to be brutal. It'll be the first time many of them have seen him since the war and it would be easy to blame him. Nobody really knew the extent of his help in the war. Some people claimed he wasn't involved and others say he was instrumental in the fight.
"No! I already told you, your cloaks are too expensive we wouldn't even be allowed through the gates." Pansy says as they make their way down the hall of identical doors.
He shuffles into the muggle music room taking a seat. Upon seeing Harry sitting amongst the other students he wants to hide but there's really no use. When Harry glances his way his stomach twists and the icy glare chills him to his core. By that look alone he has undoubtedly read the article. He can feel his insides shrivel up and if he could disappear through the floor then he would.
But when he peers past the door he curses under his breath seeing several large men trying to grab his friends. He hesitates a moment but if it weren't for him none of them would be here. So he takes a steadying breath grabs his wand and runs forward shooting spell after spell. He manages to jinx one of them and he can see Crabbe snatch up a broomstick. Blaise disarms another and as he scrambles for the wand he snatches up brooms for himself and Pansy. They start pushing out of the door onto the street. Goyle stuns one of them and manages to grab a broom as he hustles out. And with a quick accio the broom zooms into his hand and he ducks under the swing of a fist and out the door.
He trudges down the hall towards his muggle art class and there is a sense of dread in him. He has slowed himself so much that the halls have cleared. It's just him left alone in the corridors. It feels like more than the fear of being judged that is holding him back. It is a feeling that comes from his gut that he shouldn't be here. The jeers of relatives at the expense of muggles and mudbloods ring through his ears. He stops at the door for a moment feeling as though stepping into the room would be a betrayal of his blood purity.
"How?" Draco asks holding the cloak around him closer even though there wasn't a gust of wind to give him a chill.
"I just got lost" He says trying not to sound scared. "If you point me in the direction of hogwarts then I'll be on my way." He says but their faces stay impassive.
thing for you but it has a very positive spin in your favor. I expect your mum to send me a gift basket." She says with a smirk and Draco can't help but be amused by her. Then something dawns on him.
Harry leans over to him making Draco's heart suddenly speed up "It's a projector" Harry whispers and he can feel the breath against his cheek. When he looks over his stomach seems to tie itself in knots with Harry so close. He's pointing to a little black box connected to the ceiling but Draco is far too preoccupied with the fact that Harry is in his space to care anymore. So he simply nods and slumps in his seat trying not to wonder why he's so flustered.
But he takes the journal, which is more a pamphlet than anything and right on the headline is his name in big bold letter. But instead of the normal accusations or a nearly slanderous piece the headline screams
"I just want one week of peace." Draco sighs only realizing he'd unintentionally walked back to his dorm once he is stopped in front of the door. "Your dorm is back this way isn't it?" He asks pointing down the hall he begins to walk away when Pansy grabs his collar and pulls him back toward his room.
It feels like he is missing a million things, but surely anything of true importance he would have remembered by now. Draco carries with him his wet clothes just in case they need a reason to be out in the halls. But they are for the most part empty. Other than some house elves who scurry away at the sight of them they don't see anyone along the way.
As they fly eventually the city gives way to the countryside. Goyle has joined Pansy in navigation even though she seems to know exactly where she's going. Crabbe has started sneaking snacks and Blaise is trying broom tricks. Draco however is sulking and anytime anyone tries to cheer him up he snaps at them unintentionally. To be uncomfortable for such a long period of time has made him short tempered. Each time he asks Pansy when they'll be there she says "Soon!" Which pacifies him for only a short time. The pin in his side has been jabbing into him for the last half hour and that small pin is bringing him waves of absolute rage.
