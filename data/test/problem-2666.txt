“You’ve had time to find a suitable wife on your own, Draco.  I don’t have to tell you that a great deal is at stake.  You’re a man now, and it’s time for you to meet the responsibilities of your family.  You’re a Malfoy, my Dragon, and it has never before been so important for you to marry well, marry respectably.”
“Really, Aunt?  I would have thought that I made that quite clear earlier.  I’m very fond of Harry, and I am interested in pursuing a relationship with him.”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Ron muttered.  He cast a quick spell, and said, “Gin’s magical signature is here as well.  I don’t see anything to help us find Harry, but at least we have more evidence to support our theory.”
One little boy seemed to be an oasis in the storm.  He was carefully holding something that appeared to be wriggling in his hand, and watching the chaos unfold.  Harry quickly transfigured his outfit into a Police uniform, and strode into the fray.  “Excuse me,” he said calmly, “we were called for a noise compliant.  Is anything the matter?”
“Yes, sir?”  Harry turns back.
“Of course it’s your wand, Cass.”
I don’t expect her to laugh at me, but she does, peal after peal of delighted, musical laughter.  It goes on for such a long time that I start to regret saying anything.  I can feel my cheeks heat, and I look down, embarrassed.  “I’m sorry,” Luna finally gasps, just as I’m considering how I can kick her out of the flat when she knows more magic than I do.  “Honestly, Harry, I don’t mean to make fun.” Her face darkens for a moment. “I know what it’s like when people make fun of what you believe.”  She reaches out and touches my face, her hand gentle, and I risk looking up at her.  She’s solemn now, and her eyes blaze with sincerity.  “You poor, sweet thing.  I didn’t realize just how confused you were.  Hermione isn’t involved in a conspiracy to target anyone.”
“Draco, did I ever tell you about the night that Sirius died?”
“Wow, that is a surprise,” Harry said.  “Believe it or not, it isn’t the strangest thing I’ve seen.  I’m going to call some of my colleagues to sort things out, but if you didn’t mind, I’d like to come inside with you, have a cup of tea, and explain some things.”
“Scorpius, you good?”
I gift him with a tiny curve of my lips.  There’s more that he has to say, and he won’t get a reaction before I understand exactly where he’s leading.  I see a tiny flicker of resignation in his eyes as he mourns my placidity, and he continues, “That’s why I was awfully surprised to see the article in the Prophet this morning.”
“Alright.  I’ll send an owl with whatever he needs, and I’ll be back when I can.”  Weasley disappeared into the floo quickly, a bit desperately, if Draco were being honest, but at the last minute, he popped his head back into the room.  “Malfoy, do you even know how to look after a baby?”
The elf popped into the room, took one look around, and squeaked in alarm.  With a snap of his fingers, the toys were the correct distance apart, and he threw himself down at Draco’s feet.  “Pippy is sorry, Master Draco.  Pippy was unwell last week, and Dippen was doing Pippy’s cleaning.  Pippy told Dippen to get it right, but Pippy didn’t check.”
Cass hesitated for a moment, and then threw her arms around her father.  “It doesn’t matter,” she muttered.  “I don’t care if he doesn’t want me either.  You’re still my dad.  It’s okay.”
“I did, Miss Cici!” Scorpius brandishing the dragon.  After it had been thoroughly admired,  she eyed him appraisingly.
“Draco, why?”
“What did you do?”  The awful voice thing is contagious, it turns out because my voice doesn't sound okay either.
“Yeah, I’m glad we live so close, at least the walk is quick.  The wind took a bunch of shingles off my shop.  Oh, I brought you something!”  Harry reached into his bag, and removed a small plastic container containing a single, beautiful cupcake.
“Harry hasn’t mentioned that he feels any obligation to provide the stability you speak of, Aunt.  I would think that he has done more than his duty to our society.”
“You monster!” Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“It’s just that…he was always the other side of the coin.  He fascinated me, how he could be so effortlessly good.  How he was able to put aside what he wanted for the good of all.  And he…”
It’s a seaside, and a slightly older Harry is kneeling beside the prone figure of a house elf.  As the burial proceeds, I watch his face keenly.  His expression is hard, but within his eyes lies a galaxy of anguish.  It is as though, if he were to allow any of his feelings to emerge, that they would dissolve him completely.  He draws his wand, and inscribes an epitaph on the gravestone.
“Her place?”
Later that afternoon, the floo chimed and a familiar face appeared.  “News travels quickly, I see,” Draco said dryly.
“What do you mean, stop the cycle?”  My gut is churning, and I desperately hope that he doesn’t say what I think he’s going to.
“That sounds fairly final.  As though you’ve written us all off.”
“Yeah.  Can I see you?  After you’ve changed?”
I stifle a groan, but luxuriate in the imagined sensation, his tongue swirling around the length of my cock, the way he sucks hard and the feel of the head pressing against his soft palate.  I imagine those grey eyes looking up at me, his slim, clever fingers caressing my balls, whispering along my perineum, ghosting across my hole.  That’s when I realize that there’s another presence in my mind, watching alongside me.  I picture myself gripping that soft blond hair, pulling just enough to keep him present.  He pulls out of my mind abruptly, reeling back physically, and sitting on his haunches.
He summoned a vial of the inoculation, and a sanitizing wipe before donning a set of Muggle rubber gloves and approaching the chair.  Auror Pritchard was sitting comfortably, looking around his lab with interest.  “Mister Malfoy, you have an incredible setup here.”  She was an older witch, around fifty-five, Draco guessed, and she’d been one of Draco’s biggest combatants when he’d first started consulting to the Aurors.  She was Muggleborn, Draco knew, and had lost a family member during the war.  Old wounds remained deep in the years following, and she’d been vocal in her disapproval of an ex-Death Eater interacting with the Aurors.  Still, Draco had been one of only four Potions Master in Europe, and the remaining Death Eaters that were still at large after the war had access to Snape’s formulas.  They’d needed a great deal of help in counteracting the potions during their many attempts to round up all the remaining baddies, and, after Draco had been able to cure the effects of a bone-liquifying potion that had been threatening her partner, she’d quickly changed her tune.  Since then, she’d been collegial, but Draco remembered everything she’d said before.
“Kreacher has work to be doing,” he mutters.
“Well, maybe we’ll try a little something,” Draco said.  This wasn’t the time to begin a battle over eating.  Maybe after he wrestled Scorpius into his clothes.
Hermione’s there, with a hastily packed bag, and Harry’s Gringott’s key and a pair of shoes for Draco.  “I’ve made you a Portkey, it will take you to the Order safe house in Scotland.”
Draco took encouragement from this.  “Harry, I was wondering if I could chat with you for a moment?”
“Budget cuts, which, of course, is complete crap, because they’ve just hired from the newest crop of graduates.  It's because I was a Slytherin.”
“Of course it is.”
“I’d rather not,” Harry says.
“It seems wrong, somehow, to wake him up,” Draco said, despite his better judgement.  “Leave him, Hermione.  We’ll be fine.”
“I know, but I’m the dad, and you’re the kid. You don’t need to worry about me.”
“Kreacher is a good house elf, and there is no trouble for serving his Master.”  And, just like that, he’s back to being offended.
“Yes.  I’ll make arrangements for us to Portkey to England.”
“Now.”  The tone brooked no argument, and Cass, white-faced, ran up to the spare room to gather her possessions.
“Draco, don’t,” she warns.  “He needs to face justice for this.  If you kill him, the rest of the people who are responsible will go unpunished.”
“I’m nearly positive,” Draco agreed.  “I’ve created a tincture of the four ingredients, and we just need to perfect the ratios, then I can create an antidote.”
“Well, it gave me an idea of the difference between what my life is, and what it could be, to start with.”  Harry peers at Draco from beneath his lashes.  Draco’s biting his bottom lip.  Harry has never noticed that his two front teeth are just the tiniest bit crooked.  “Listen, Draco, you know that I’m terrible at this kind of thing.  But that kiss?  It felt like an invitation.  I’m going to fuck things up way more often than I get them right, and I’m certainly going to freak out sometimes, and be prickly and terrible, and maybe make you hate me.  I haven’t got the slightest idea why you have any interest in me at all,” he says, and suddenly, he’s terrified that he’s gotten this all wrong.  “That is, if you do…have interest.”
Draco is surprised to see him, then, immediately, the surprise is masked by Draco’s normal haughty stare.  “Potter,” he says, his tone revealing nothing.
“Yes, certainly.  What was your biggest concern with getting back your memories, and with them, the ability to truly feel your emotions?”
“That’s an excellent question,” Cici replied.  “The good news is that, once she donates, her body will generate replacement bone marrow to make up for what was taken.  Although there are minimal chances for infection, it is a small risk, and once she’s healed, her life will continue as it did before.”
“Oh.  No, no.  Draco, you’re her father.  I’m not going to tell you how to parent her.  I know that the two of you will figure it out.”
Draco’s mouth twists for a moment, before he breaks into the most heart-stoppingly beautiful smile that Harry’s ever seen.  “Yes, Harry.  I have interest.”
“Little ducks,” he said softly, giving her a fond little look.
“Draco,” Hermione hesitated.  “Do you fancy Harry?”
“That’s not fair, though,” Harry argued.  “I didn’t give you a chance to be there.”
“I thought so.  Draco and I have been catching up.”  Draco looks up at me, and his eyes are suspiciously bright, as though he’s been crying, or near to it.  I place a kiss on the top of his head and sink into a chair beside him.
“How did your family manage?” Draco didn’t seem disdainful of his relatives at all, merely desperate for a solution.
“You have a past, the two of you.”
As they walked home, the grey skies clearly trying to decide whether to spit rain or snow, Cass gave him an arch look, and raised a single eyebrow.  “Was Amy’s dad asking you out?”
She suddenly brightens a little.  “Don’t get me wrong.  It was fascinating.  You wouldn’t believe what I’ve learned about magical inheritance and the way that magic manifests in Muggleborns and…” she trails off before she can get carried away.  “Anyway.  It was obvious that your magical outbursts were tied to your emotional state, rather like accidental magic happens in children who haven’t learned control yet.  I found a Muggleborn witch who had an advanced degree in Psychology, and we brought her in to consult.”
“Nah, Ravenclaw,” Cass said.
“They haven’t changed much, I’m afraid.  A sibling donor would be the best option, but I’m certain that you’d have much to discuss before making a decision to have another baby.  In addition, you know that the chances of your next child having the same condition are higher than in other families.”
“Maybe it’s good that you’re here tonight.  Maybe you two can put things to rest.  Harry just wanted some answers.  He hasn’t really been the same since.”
“Do you think he would have stayed with you?  If things had been different, and he hadn’t needed to marry a lady?”
An absolutely adorable blonde boy was peering up at Harry with unmistakable interest.  “Are you Harry Potter?”
“Harry, do you want to go to your Aunt and Uncles?  I assumed you were doing okay here, but we can-”
“He wouldn’t have approved?”
“Fucking Wendell,” Ron spits.  I heartily agree.  “About that, though,” he continues.  “We couldn’t very well leave him there to destroy evidence, or run away or something.”
Draco and I are ejected from the Pensieve and we sit on the floor of the room, quiet.  “Did that help?”
Draco paced the floor of the drawing room, hoping to dispel some of the tension that threatened.  He’d already lost his lunch more than once throughout the afternoon, but, since he was prone to doing the same thing before a game, he wasn’t that surprised.  Usually, a bout of pre-game nerves gave him a precision focus that ensured he played well.  Today, he just felt a lingering queasiness, and his hands shook no less than they had when he woke up.  The house elf who seemed to be in charge popped into the room, and, with a serene bow, pressed a calming draught into his hand.  It seemed as good an idea as any, so Draco downed the draught and gratefully passed the vial back to the little elf, who disappeared from the room again.  Suffused with potion-induced calm, Draco ran a now-steady hand through his hair and straightened his robes.  It felt strange to be wearing Wizarding clothing again, but Draco comforted himself by wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with a grinning wolf, the mascot of his team back home, under his jumper.
Draco could hear Molly muttering to herself and banging pots and pans around, but he followed the Weasleys like a duckling as they crossed the wide orchard and down a hill.
“I see.  When you were in school, you never held hands with anyone?  You didn’t date?”
It makes sense, but I have a terrible feeling in my stomach about what's coming next.
Too much talking, I decide.  “You’re so beautiful,” I whisper, and his eyes widen.  I can’t look away, and it’s awkward, because I can’t see what I’m doing, but the friction of our cocks against one another is exactly what I need.  We kiss, and kiss, and I suck his lower lip, his tongue
“Yes, well, Cissy took to gardening very well.  Bella, on the other hand…didn’t enjoy the hobby.”
She looks up, and Draco can see that the cheesy line has indeed turned her head a little.  She beams at him.  “You’re just as nice as I always thought you were,” she gushes.
“Yes, it can be.  It’s very difficult to see the people that we love in pain, and Harry has had more than the average person.”
?” Draco finally demands when Blaise stands for ages, looking at him as though he’s something disgusting.
“I wouldn’t.  Undo it, I mean.  It actually helped me figure some stuff out.”
To Draco’s surprise, Lara jumped to her feet and started to clap.  “Well done, Draco.  My goodness, you’ve come so far.  Even six months ago, you would have been telling me that you had to do something to prove to him that you deserved a chance.  Accepting that you’re not responsible for someone else's feelings is such a huge step.  We discussed this before, ages ago, but I suspect that Harry’s past might make it very difficult for him to extend trust to others.  It was an unfortunate circumstance, but you acted in the most honourable way you knew, and if he’s not able to accept that…”
Draco has just enough presence of mind to recognize how much Potter has grown up.  He doesn’t sputter, his face doesn’t redden at the abuse the woman is now hurling at him.  He merely blinks at her for a moment, and then, in a calm but quiet voice says, “You don’t know what my parents would think, and you don’t get to tell me your opinion.  Remove yourself, madam, or I’ll floo the Aurors.  Take your filthy words and your disgusting opinions somewhere else.”
“Yeah, that’s the other thing.  I spent my whole life being thrown into mortal peril, and literally
I give up.  If she knows something about Smith, she’s way too good at bluffing for me to see through it.  Besides, this is the first time she’s made a joke.  “Well, if I start dating Smith, you have my permission to intervene.  In fact, I need you to agree right now, that you will never allow it.”
That prompted the ghost of a smile.  Miriam continued, “So?  Are you there with me?  Living in a world where you could have anything you wanted?”
“It’s hard to show solidarity for a relationship that four people know about,” Harry says.  “And the only reason you two know is because you stumbled in on-"
“And you’ll owl me?  I want to know what house you’re in.”
Harry
“Why didn’t Mill tell me that you were looking into that?”
After breakfast, Cass insisted on taking her own plate to the kitchen, much to the disapproval of the house elves, who wailed and trailed after her, wringing their hands.  Draco vividly remembered a similar scene at the Manor, when Harry had horrified his mother’s elves just as much.  He told her so, and Cass grinned.  “Dad said that the worst thing that happened after the war was that he inherited a House Elf, and he had to figure out how to get along with him.”
“I think you’ve met your match,” said a voice behind him, causing him to jump.
“Kind of shit,” Ron supplies, and I grin in his direction.
There’s something awfully close to grudging admiration on his face, and I can’t help but bask in it a little.  “That is…surprisingly well reasoned,” he finally says.
Mill laughs again.  The lifts have spat us out onto a long corridor, and she’s leading me along as we talk.  “You aren’t a dumbass.  You care too much, you throw yourself in front of danger to protect others.  You’re also shockingly lucky, so that helps.”
“What’s a Dumbledore?”
Draco has had enough.  He’s nearly undone, with Potter’s constant visits, with the tiny, stupid bolt of hope that ratchets through his body every time Potter flirts with him.  With the ridiculous notion that Potter might be serious before Draco realizes that of course he isn’t.  With the embarrassment of the intensity that he wishes that Potter
“So, we thought that if we could do some strategic obliviation, and tweak some of the memories that fed your super-ego, it would reduce your unrealistic expectations of your ideal self, and make you less likely to constantly fall short of impossible ideals.”
“That’s the extent of it, but it was much more complicated at the time.  My family is an old, Pureblooded family.  We have been wealthy, and entitled, and powerful, for generations.  The Manor you saw today has been in my family for centuries.  People who have power will go to great lengths to preserve that power, and so my Grand-Père, and my Papa were both very interested in how a man named Tom Riddle believed that he could preserve that way of life.”
He sighs.  “I don’t think anything will be enough, really.  Scorpius’ life has been altered, no question.  This will affect his marriage prospects, amongst those who care about bloodlines and such.  It’s not that I care, really, but…” he trails off and looks up at the ceiling.  I understand immediately.  Narcissa Malfoy will care.  In truth, I’ve barely seen her since Draco and I have exiled within the wards of Malfoy Manor, and she’s been coolly polite each time, excusing herself nearly immediately.  She’s taken every meal in her quarters since the breakfast we shared.  Resolving to deal with that problem another day, I return to the matter at hand.
Hermione hesitated.  “Are…are you sure?”
Harry did so, and it was a very surprised Hermione who opened her front door to let Crookshanks out some time later, only to find a man sitting on her front step.  Although his back was the to the door, the tousled hair was a dead giveaway.  “Harry?”
“We have to find them,” Draco said.  “Who knows what she’s doing to Harry.”
“Of course, mate,” Ron says easily, and Harry is so grateful for his friend that he wants to weep.  “The next few days are going to be weird enough without adding something so undignified as
I can’t look at Hermione.  I knew that something wasn’t right, but I trusted her, and somehow she was involved with the evil bastard that hurt Draco’s baby, and…she was supposed to be my family.  Because I didn’t have one, and somehow along the way, she and Ron became my people, and even when I woke up, confused, with no memories and no idea what was going on, she felt safe, but she isn’t.  This whole time, she’s known who the person who hurt me was, because it was her.  Because she thought I was turning into a Dark Lord.
“If you want.  It’s mostly repetitive hard work, so I can’t promise anything sexy.”  Draco cursed himself as the words slipped out unbidden.  Stupid!
“Scorpius, it’s time to get dressed now,” Draco said firmly.  “Mama already told you that.”
Because Thursday's chapter was a little short, and this one isn't much longer, I'm posting a little Saturday morning bonus.  Make sure you haven't missed one, because I think the story would get a bit confusing without them in order!  Thanks, as always, for reading, kudo-ing and commenting.
“I think so,” she says miserably.  “I was being so careful, Harry.  And this couldn’t have happened at a worse time.  Vi’s preschool fees are due in a week, and…” She sighs.  “I could go home to Mother and Father, but I was working so hard to get away from all of that Pureblood traditional crap.”
“It’s just so unfair, Pansy.  Draco deserves so much better, and I refuse to let it slide in front of our daughter.  She shouldn’t have to listen to a complete stranger say such awful things about one of her parents.  And Draco shouldn’t have to listen to it either.  Oh Merlin.  Is he furious?  Does he want to murder me?”
“'Course I did.  Draco, I’m so sorry.  Your mum was…amazing.”  Harry crosses the floor, and Draco wards him off with upraised arms.
“Harry,” Hermione tried, “we actually know you quite well.  You’re our friend.”
“I’m so sorry,” I confide.  “I had a bit of an accident.  I’m having some troubles with my memory.”
Ron looks reasonably placated by this, and I’m relieved.  I can’t help feeling a bit annoyed that my every decision seems to be vetted by these two, but there’s something in this dynamic that I am still piecing together.  “Hey, Harry,” Ron says suddenly.  “You should go for a run.”
“Not terrible,” I pant.  “Brilliant news, actually.”
Draco followed more slowly, wondering what Harry meant.  There had been something a little wistful in his gaze since the night they’d shared a drink in Draco’s office.  When he caught anyone looking, he’d quickly smile, and jump back into the conversation, but something was on his mind.  As he neared the ground, he allowed himself to hope, just for a moment, that Harry was also wondering if there could be a future for them.  Now that he'd banished his initial anger and hurt, Draco could admit to himself that he'd surrendered his heart to Harry, years ago.  He'd done his duty, produced an heir, even built a life with Astoria and Scorpius, but a part of him remained Harry's.
“Cass, stop.”  Harry’s voice was firm.  Cass looked at him pleadingly.
It wasn’t long before Rose got cranky, and Hermione had to get her home to nap.  Draco sat, finishing his tea, and pondered the situation.  That was when the idea came to him.  He’d give it one last try, and if it didn’t work out, at least he’d know.
“Dad.  What’s the worst part of all of this?”  Her tone was blunt, and Harry knew that if he didn’t answer her, he’d further fracture their relationship.
“Do you have a few moments?  I would dearly love to try an experiment.”
“Are you enjoying it?”
The Ministry is, as I should have predicted, a madhouse.  Draco learns right away that they’ve called an emergency session of the Wizengamot, and that Kingsley will be testifying as to his involvement in the conspiracy.  The Atrium is packed with reporters, employees and citizens, and when they see us, the chatter rises to a roar as everyone seems to clamour for a statement from us both.  I start elbowing my way through the crowd, but Draco casts a much more effective spell that pushes people back by a few feet and clears a path to the lifts.
“Not terribly, today.  Thank you for returning.”
Whatever had taken Blanket was moving away, and Harry tried to stop crying, but he was afraid, and he couldn't stop.  The voices were louder, but far away.  They sounded mad, and whenever a mad voice came into Safe, bad things happened.  He curled into a ball, and tucked his head in.  This went on for quite some time, and Harry decided he had no choice but to cope with his new circumstances.  He’d lost Blanket, and Darkness, but as long as he had Safe, it would be okay.  He curled tighter into the corner, and let his thoughts drift.  He thought of a little girl, and in his mind, she was beautiful, and her laughter was the best sound he’d ever heard in his life.  He wasn’t sure how he’d managed to dream her up, but he didn’t need to think about why.  Just watch, as the sun played on golden curls.
“Would you like to take some of this potion?  I think it will help with the headache.”
“I don’t know.”
“Yes, very much so, although she is quite concerned for you.”
“All the more reason to start,” Peter said hopefully.
Draco summoned it from the cupboard door and handed it to her.
sport, I suppose, a missing ear.  Jesus, what has
Harry took a deep breath, clenched his hands together to stop them from shaking.  “Mister Malfoy and I were close after the war, but our association ended prior to my learning that I was expecting.  When that occurred, I wished to avoid, quite frankly, the media circus that was likely to result, and so I left the country without sharing my location with any of my friends or acquaintances, save the Headmistress of Hogwarts.  Not to be insulting to your esteemed profession, but my adolescence, and the years following the war were made significantly more difficult by the fact that the press was quite intrusive. I believed that my child had the right to privacy.”
“It’s also possible that she’ll end up the youngest Minister for Magic in history, truly it could go either way, with that one.”
The sound that came out of Potter’s mouth sounded nothing like ‘Kreacher’, but somehow, magic compensates, and the oldest, filthiest house elf Draco had ever seen popped into the lab.  “Master Potter, the filthy mud-”  Kreacher’s words cut off abruptly as he laid eyes on the scene.  “Master Harry is being a baby,” he said, his tone reverent, and his goggle eyes widening.
“A week?  I’ve been here a week?”
“No, I don’t, but he’s still a pain.”
“Harry, she tried to hand you over to Voldemort on the night of the battle!”
“When will she be back?”
“Vaults.  Yes.”
“What?”
“Luna, hello.” Draco forced a smile on his face. “It’s been a long time since I saw you.”
“Yours.” Draco nodded, shouldered his hockey bag and started walking out of the arena.  As they were leaving, he saw a few of his teammates.
“I don’t want to.  He hurt me.”
“That’s not true, Cass.  I care.”
Draco still hadn’t returned by Tuesday, and Harry had gone to his Healer’s appointment without speaking to him.  Three hours later, shocked, clutching a carrier bag full of potions, Harry had placed a hand on his still-flat stomach, his mind reeling with the new information he’d just absorbed.
To those of you who wanted to bounce Draco's head off of the nearest wall for just being so fucking CLUELESS and STUPID and oh god, Draco just use your head and your WORDS for once, I hope that his character arc has been a satisfying one for you too.
, but the sound of a door opening jarred him from his mind’s efforts to self-destruct, and he took Scorpius’ hand and looked up.
.  I imagine that, with a title like ‘Unspeakable’,  first names aren’t to be revealed, and it spikes a bolt of vindictive joy in me, even as I’m grappling with the disappointment that I was wrong about Smith. (That fucker.)  Hermione goes to the cupboard, spells it open with a wand, and removes a tiny vial filled with clear liquid, and a crystalline orb.  She taps the orb with her wand, and says, “Unspeakable Hermione Granger-Weasley, issuing a challenge to Unspeakable Wendell Bright.”  She rattles of the date and time, and gestures Wendell into a nearby chair.  He moves as though he’s compelled, each action jerky and automatic.  The Department of Mysteries is truly weird, I decide.  The moment he sits down, Draco and Pansy rush to Scorpius’ side and start casting spells on him.
“Why would he, though?  It’s not like I’m going to shag him again if he talks to the press.”
“He’s sleeping, and will be for the next several days, but you can certainly look in and give him a hug.  I expect that you’ll be needing to see him with your own eyes, won’t you, sweetheart?” The Healer had given Cass a kind smile, and she nodded.
“Then it can be whatever you want.”
“That’s progress.’
Arthur Weasley opens it and stands looking at them.  “Kids,” he says softly. “You’re here.”
Draco purses his lips.  If there’s anything he likes more than sweets, it’s surprises.  “How’s Dennis?”  His voice is a little too loud.
“Worse,” Luna replies.  “He used the insecurity of the Purebloods to fuel his rise to power.  Some of his followers were fearful that allowing Muggleborn witches and wizards into our world would expose us to those who might persecute us.  Some were terrified that they’d have their assumptions challenged.  The members of the Sacred Twenty-eight were viewed as special, more powerful, and they raised their children to believe that too.  When a little Muggleborn witch got higher grades than everyone else, it was a threat.”
Harry nodded.  “I bet.  Sometimes breathing too quickly can dry it out.  I have a throat sweetie here, if you want to take it.  I’ll have one too.”  Once they were sucking their sweets, Harry smiled.  “You’re doing so well, Scorpius.  I know that it can be really scary when unexpected things happen, and you don’t know me very well yet, and so I’m really glad that you’re giving me a chance.”
“Fuh!” Harry answered.  “Fuh Pottah!”
using the baby blanket in the ritual to find Scorpius, even if symbolically.  Draco wears a simple linen set of robes, and he’s so pale, standing there, his hands nervously twisting.  Hermione sets the bowls of herbs atop some of the runes, and Pansy hands her a silver dagger. I note, managing not to roll my eyes, that the hilt is intricately carved in the shape of a snake.  Walking stereotypes indeed.
She shrugged, “You talk in your sleep.”
“Of course,” Draco said smugly.  “I never doubted.”
“That’s right,” Harry says.  “He’ll need to have people around him.  This is more important than my hurt feelings.”
“Um,” he says.  “I have to…” and then he’s getting up, casting a Lumos, and pulling his pants back on, and a robe.
“Cass.”
“Yeah.  From our year.”
“You may,” Draco said, “but please be careful with the wand.”
They found a subtle spot behind the rink to apparate and before long they were in Draco’s condo.  He threw his hockey bag in the closet; he’d deal with that later.  “Beer?” he asked
Cass took her hospital robes to the attached loo, and soon emerged wearing them.  They had yellow ducks patterned all over them.  “Look Dad,” Cass said.
“Minerva, and Uncle Professor.  They’ve got this.  You focus on having a good time and enjoying your family, okay?”
“You’ll fit them soon enough,” Draco said, and felt a little pang of something at the idea that soon Harry would be an adult, and would be leaving.
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured, removing his hand and standing up.  Perhaps it was better for him to just leave.  He’d obviously caused enough damage, to Harry’s heart, and, it seemed, his liver.
“This is it,” Mill says, motioning towards a door.  There’s a desk, behind which a stern looking old lady sits.  She sees me, and her lip quirks.
“He saved us all.”
Cass shook her head.  “He said he lived with his Aunt and Uncle, and that he didn’t know he was a Wizard until Hogwarts.”
“I don’t know, but it’s wrong.”
“Arbitrated by?” His voice is thin now.
Cass nodded.  “It’s a bit weird.  First night without my Dad.”
I open the door and regard the stranger standing on the opposite side.  She has tiny features, close set, and her nose turns up at the end.  Her dark hair is long, hanging lank against her face.  She glares at me, so I stare back, an eyebrow raised, until she says, “Potter.”
“Once my apprenticeship with Garrick Ollivander was concluded, I moved to North America to begin my own wand-making practice.”
“About that,” I say.  “Maybe when we’re done, you could show me where I live.  You should enjoy your holiday, not babysit me.”
The team they were playing was aggressive, skilled.  Draco found himself checked into the boards, and saw a familiar flash of green through the plexiglass.  It reminded him of something, but he shoved the thought to the back of his mind, and focused on trying to draw the opposing right winger into a hooking penalty.  Instead, the player mouthed off at him, and his temper gave way.  Gloves flew onto the ice, and before he really knew what was happening, he was shoving the guy, punching him.  The guy’s helmet went askew, and Draco punched him in the cheekbone.  The referee was there before he was able to inflict much damage, and Draco found himself in the penalty box.  He scanned the crowd again, and could swear he saw a familiar mop of unruly black hair.  Before he could look further, his penalty had ended, and he was back on the ice.
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.  “Then, what is it?”  His voice was small.
“Oh,” Cass said.  “Yeah, sure.  I sort of forgot about school, but yeah, I don’t want to fall behind.  It’s been strange, it feels like holidays.”  Something occurred to her.  “Papa, do you have a job?  I’ve just realized that Astoria goes out to work, but you’re home almost always.”
“Partially,” I allow, “but something tells me that my strengths are in the field.  From what I can tell, I rely on others for the strategic thinking, and succeed because of a lack of self-preservation and dumb luck.”
An older man bustles out from the back room.  “Yes, my treasure?”  He suddenly spies me, and says, “Mister Potter!”
Harry grabs him, sets him down on the bed.  “Why are you here, then?” he finally asks.
“Do you know what happened to hurt her?”
“No, I can’t imagine that it will either.  But I have to try, even if it’s just to let you know that…well…I don’t know…”
“Sure,” Draco said.  He heard the whoosh of the floo a few moments later, and stood for a moment longer, watching his schoolboy nemesis sleeping peacefully in his crib.
“Draco?”  Lucius looked at him, a little blearily.  “Are you home for Easter break?”
“Right, but I haven’t the faintest idea how much.  Look, I was cursed, and I’ve lost a bunch of my memories.  I didn’t see any account statements at my flat, so I just need some help figuring out where I stand.”
“I understand the point that you’ve been making with your friends.  Nobody has the right to tell you what makes a full life.  However, having the last word isn’t a victory if you punish yourself by locking yourself away from what makes you happy.”
“The next thing I have to tell you, is that all of the things that you got into trouble for?  That’s not your fault.  You should never have been punished for that.  You’ve magic, Malcolm.  You’re a wizard, just like I am.”  Malcolm’s eyes grew impossibly big.  He shook his head.  Harry nodded.  “You are, and magic is a wonderful gift that only some people have.  I don’t think that your Mummy and Daddy understood it, and sometimes, when people don’t understand, they get frightened.  But that’s not your fault.  Every single little witch and wizard does accidental magic.”
“We’ll see,” Draco soothed.   The potions that Scorpius had taken at St. Mungo’s took effect quickly, and he started to droop over his hot chocolate.  “I’ll just take him to his bedroom, if you don’t mind waiting a moment?”
She huffs impatiently.  “Honestly, Potter, we need to talk.  Stop being so suspicious.”
“You’re little,” she said doubtfully.  “You don’t look four.”  Draco stiffened, ready to intervene.
Draco’s yawn nearly split apart his head.  “That’s it,” he said.  “I’m knackered.  I’m going to bed.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, Harry.  Let’s go home.”
Severus was watching Harry very closely, his dark eyes keen, but his face wholly impassive.  He seemed to recognize something in Harry’s expression.  “Harry,” he said softly.  “Go for a walk.  Get some air and clear your head.  You do not need to make any decisions now.  Minerva and I will be here for Cass.”
“Of course,” Draco answered.
As Cass and Harry sat next to one another on the sofa, Harry said, “Are you excited?”
“How dare you?”  The woman is shaking her fist in Draco’s face.  “You think that we’ve forgotten?  What you did?  What your whole Merlin-damned
“Yes,” he says, and it’s clear that he’s answering unwillingly.
“Yes,” Draco whispered.  “Of course she is.”  He was gazing at her in awe, and Harry was so ashamed he’d robbed him of this for nearly ten years that his nails bit into his palms within his clenched hands.
“I know,” I soothe.  “I wouldn’t suggest this if I didn’t think that they could help.  It’s the only idea I have.”
“That’s not what I’m saying,” Hermione said, her voice raising a bit.  “I’m saying that you are always a bit sensitive to kids who you think aren’t being treated well, and with your history with that family, you don’t think you’d be looking extra hard to see if there’s anything wrong?”
“Shut the fuck up!” Another voice commanded from elsewhere in the house.  “I have to work in the buggering morning!”  Pansy.
“It wasn’t nothing, Draco,” Harry argued.  “I just don’t see the value in holding onto hurts from the past.”  He took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt, unwilling to look Draco in the eye when he went on, “Let’s be honest, my childhood was terrible.  If I continue to hold on to the grief and loss and fear, I wouldn’t be able to function at all.”
Hermione groaned.  “I’m the worst sort of coward.  I can’t find any proof, and I haven’t managed to tell Ron yet.”
He smiles.  “It makes you human.  Voldemort lived his life without love, Harry.  Love saved you.”
It’s still only half ten, so Fortesque’s is empty when I arrive.  Louise is carrying a heavy barrel of ice cream to place in the cooled counter.  I rush to her side and grab it from her.  “Thanks,” she breathes, and she looks delighted to see me.  “You’re becoming our best customer!”
If Harry needed to destroy him in the process of gaining closure, well.  Hadn’t that been what he thought he’d been doing the first time he ran away? Resolved to his fate, Draco vowed to let Harry do whatever it was he wanted.  Then, after, his Mother…well, after, Draco would return to Canada and see if there was anything left of him.
“You did, though,” Mill says.  “Last year, when Pansy first came to me, and asked for help, I talked to you about it.  You went straight to Shacklebolt, and he assured you that the probation officers were monitored, supervised by the Auror Department.”
“Hullo,” I say.  “I’ve lost my memory, so I’m sorry in advance if we’re friends and I’m being rude.”
Cass watched him for a long moment, her eyes appraising.  “Team Canada’s doing well,” she finally said, and it wasn’t much of an olive branch, but it was something.  Harry’s smile widened a little, and Draco quirked his lips at Cass, a silent sign of support.
He took Cass’ hand again, and as he led her out of the room, she turned to Draco, and said, “That's how my Dad parents me.”
She frowns.  “I’ll need ten minutes.  And I’ll have to bring Rose.”
“I think I used to be a bit of an arsehole,” I confess.
Cass nodded, and they picked their way back across the room, stopping a few times as Grandfather Arthur gave her a hug, and Uncle George wanted to show her something.  Fortunately, Hermione rescued her from whatever ‘something’ it was, and soon they were outside in the fresh air.  Auntie Hermione cast an efficient warming charm, and they settled into the swing.  As she pushed it with her feet, they swayed back and forth.  It was nice, and Cass was relieved to be with someone who felt restful, similar to how Dad was.
“Come sit by me.  Astoria is just putting Scorpius to bed.”  Harry went to sit in the armchair next to Narcissa, wondering if he could just snatch his daughter up and leave.  “Harry, she’s absolutely charming.  Just a lovely girl.”
“We don’t forget the ‘Puffs” Hermione said, giving Hannah a little squeeze.
I try to go easy, honestly, but I overestimate my ability to hold my drink.  Hannah convinces me to eat some chips, and stops serving me after a while, but the damage is done.  She seems to find it hilarious that I’m completely sozzled.  “Harry, let me call Ron and Hermione to come fetch you,” she says, when it appears that I’m falling asleep on the bartop.
I’m surprised by how insulted I am.  “Hermione, I know you think I’m thick-”
As I finish reading, I look up at Draco, who’s been reading his own copy.  “Well?” I ask.
“No, Papa, not hungry.”
“I’m glad you’re doing well, Hermione.”
He purses his lips slightly, regarding me with suspicion.  I want to kiss him.  I want to
“Maybe don’t bother breaking the curse then,” I say, mostly joking, but a little bit not, and kiss him again.
“No, you have to swear, first.”
, Draco thought absently.  Scorpius clutched his new book tightly in one hand.  They’d made it to Flourish and Blotts to obtain his reward for his good behaviour at the Healer’s, but Scorpius had been too tired to visit any of the other shops.  As Scorpius snuffled, and rolled over, the blanket slipped from his shoulders.  Draco tucked him in more firmly, and smoothed the hair away from his brow, placing a gentle kiss on his forehead.
“You know what.”
“Oh.”  I don’t know how to feel about all of this, but my mind does note a salient point.  That Draco doesn’t have a wife, that he is gay, and that he hadn’t lied, so much as chosen not to share personal information with me. “I’m sorry, then.  I overreacted.”
, he thought.  Scorpius flung the front door open and thundered inside, yelling “Papa?  I’m home!”
“You’re vile,” Hermione says.
“Potter.”
“That’s the best part,” he said, and she snuggled into his side and told him all about the things she’d seen in the Castle the day before.
“I thought you were done living in a cupboard while everyone else got to sit at the table,” she remarks, and although her tone is light, her eyes pierce him.  It feels like when he’d spoken to the snake and everyone had
“I need to tell you this, my Darling.” His Mother’s voice was reedy, unlike the confident tones he’d grown used to as a child.   He took her hand, giving her time to gather her strength.  “I wronged you, child.  In the time following the war, I was desperate for a way to restore our name.  Your Father was in Azkaban, but I knew what he wished for you.  I fell back on the traditions that had served us well in the past.  In doing so, I forgot to listen to you.  And I chased you away, and destroyed any chance of happiness you may have had.”
“And what do you do for a living, Malfoy?”
“A speaker?” the snake asks.
“Oh,” Harry said sadly.  “So it’s my fault then, that they’re dead.  How come he didn’t kill me then?”
“Malfoy?”  Harry stared at his former childhood nemesis, and his breath caught in this throat.  He looked again at Scorpius, and yes, of course he could see a resemblance, now that he was looking for it.
“It’s not really a nice story, and you’ll remember it after this afternoon.  Are you sure you want me to tell you?”  Draco warned, desperately regretting diving into this cauldron of fish.
“Yeah.  I don’t really want to give her another chance to manipulate me.  Luna said I should look at them.  She seems to think that Hermione took more than my memories.”
“Of course it’s real,” Draco said.  “Do you mean to tell me that your Muggles never told you that you were a Wizard?  Or Dumbledore?”
Peach.
Malfoy coughed discreetly, and Harry was certain that he was stifling a snort.  “Scorpius, why don’t you go and help yourself to a snack from the fridge.  Mr. Harry and I will have a talk, and then, later, we can go to the park.”  Scorpius gave him a somewhat dubious look, but obediently disappeared.  “Sit, Potter,” Draco said, his voice not welcoming, exactly, but also not full of scorn.
“Yeah.”
“Just a simple sterilization spell, Malfoy.  Perfectly harmless.”
“Yes.  Of course I did.  But looking back, I understand.  We were still just kids, and, Merlin, the War had broken us.  Draco had so much pressure to redeem his family.  And I was just so desperate to find someone who loved me for who I was.  We both got what we wanted, in the end, even if I hurt Draco by hiding you away.”
“Draco.”  The voice is deep, rich, and Draco would know it anywhere.
Draco suppressed a disappointed sigh.  Clearly he hadn’t been doing a good enough job of hiding his feelings, and Harry was letting him down gently.  Perhaps Harry was going to tell him of a new boyfriend.  At least Draco still had the kids to focus on.  Anyway, Harry deserved the best.  He deserved a wonderful partner, someone who would treasure him, and put him first.  Someone who chose him over everything.
“Oh, right, I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, embarrassed that he had brought it up.  The Malfoys had been sentenced to House Arrest after the war, but the Ministry had made them remove their ancestral Wards, replacing them with standard, Ministry-issue ones.  Two years later, a Ministry employee, nursing a grudge, had stolen a poorly-secured wardkey, breached Malfoy Manor, and killed Narcissa and Lucius while they slept.
Hours passed, Cass slept on, and Harry seemed to shrink inside himself the later it got.  His face, devoid of its usual good humour and confidence, was grey and blank.  When Draco’s eyes met his, he barely recognized them.  They’d lost all of their sparkle.  Draco had thought that the day he’d broken up with Harry was the worst he’d ever seen him.  He’d been wrong.
“And a promise is a promise,” Harry said faintly.  The words obviously held some sort of deeper meaning to him.  He was unsure how to respond, when Harry suddenly asked brightly, “So, do you have a dog?”
“Cool?  You’re going to just let me wander around in your mind?”
Draco wasn’t sure how he managed to return to the dinner table, and, somewhat woodenly, ask his mother to take Scorpius for the night.  She gave him a look, one eyebrow arched, but he merely shook his head and she didn’t press the issue.
“What fort?” Draco asked quickly.
“Of course you didn’t.  I never mean to either, but it happens sometimes.  And you and I both know that she doesn’t mean to hurt our feelings or make us mad.  She cares about us, both of us.  And when Hermione cares about something, or someone, she throws herself into making sure that they have the very best.  It’s something that makes her an amazing friend.  It’s also something that makes her a pain in the arse sometimes.”
“God, Draco, of course,” Harry said.  “This is the best present I ever got.  This is better than the pictures of my parents and my invisibility cloak combined.”
“Like he was thinking about something else.  His eyes were funny.  I can’t explain it, and I’d
“Yeah, I’d like to spend more time with the family.  But I know it’s hard for you.”
A few days later, the floo chimed, and Draco was surprised to see the freckled face of Ron Weasley in the flames.  “Hey Malfoy, can I come through?”
cruel, not anymore.  “Yeah, Potter.  I could do that.”
“Feel better?”
“Yeah.  She’s screwed.  One of our friends, Blaise, left England as soon as the war ended, and became a solicitor in Italy.  He’s been trying to get back to try to do something to mount a defense, but his portkey applications keep getting lost or misfiled.”
“Don’t be silly, Draco, I’d never stand in the way of a child getting needed medical treatment.”
Draco wordlessly pointed in the direction of the dining room, and a moment later, heard Scorpius exclaim delightedly, and Cass’ answering greeting.  He stood exactly where she’d left him, considering her words.
With a sigh, Harry climbed the stairs once again.  He crept to the side of the thin mattress again and said, “Malcolm?  Are you still awake?”
“Six.”
“And how do you feel about that?”
Ron takes her hand, his eyes suspiciously shiny.  Hermione continues, “But you became an Auror.  And you were amazing, and so dedicated, but it’s impossible to prevent every loss.  Each time you were too late to save someone, each time a criminal got away, it weighed on you even heavier.  Your magic has always been powerful, and after Voldemort died, it became more so.  At the time, we didn’t know if the Horcrux had transferred his powers to you when you died, or if you just came into your magical maturity.  Regardless, when you experienced high emotions, your magic reacted.”
“Er…no?”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry whispered, squeezing his hand and putting a hand on his shoulder.  Draco felt that endless cavern of misery that he’d somehow awoken in Harry’s bedroom stir.  With a frantic shake of his head, he pulled his hand away.  If he allowed himself to feel anything right now, he’d fall apart and never be able to put himself together again.  He needed to complete this like a Malfoy.  For his Mother.  For his Father, the bastard.
“I’m not sure.  Do you really mind?”
Ultimately, though, Harry had coped well with his new circumstances.  He was still very quiet and withdrawn, and tended to shy away from new situations and people…the Weasley-Grangers had caused him to hide in a corner for over an hour.  The true success, however, had been late on the second afternoon, when Draco had been conjuring wisps of coloured smoke that whirled and danced around the room.  One had taken the form of a hippogriff, and when it bowed low in front of Harry, he’d reached his hand out and smiled.  It was the first time Draco had seen anything other than a frown or a blank, stoic face, since Harry had turned three.
“Maybe I’m not the one that needs to change. I didn't do anything wrong!"
“Merry Christmas.  I assume you’re here to see one of my lot.  Please, come in!”  Given the noise level from within, Draco was a little overwhelmed by the idea of entering, but he didn't fancy dragging this armload all the way back to London, so he stepped through the doorway, and followed Mrs. Weasley to a large parlour that seemed to be teeming with people.
Harry sighed.  “I don’t hate it, exactly.  It was my home for so many years, but it’s sometimes hard to be here.  Brings up a lot of memories.  I’m thrilled that I can show you all of the things I love about England, though.”
“Why were we there in the first place?”
“M-mother!”  Draco’s voice was higher than he’d expected it to be as well, although not quite in dolphin range.  “What a surprise.”
“Your cheeks are salty.”
“‘Course.”  Hermione is leafing through the book, and Draco is peering over her shoulder.  They go over the ritual together, and Hermione says, “I assume you have a ritual room?”  Draco nods.  “Alright, well, if you want to show me where it is, maybe Parkinson can help gather the things we’ll need.”
“Good idea.  Hey Harry?”
“You picked a terrible best friend for that,” Draco remarked.  He was feeling more like himself than he had in years.  Who knew that it took the return of two-thirds of the Golden Trio to keep his mind off his problems.
That had been the question though.  After spending the past seven years driven by a prophecy, Harry wasn’t sure what it would look like to do what he wanted.  Harry contented himself with focusing on what he knew, and figured the rest would take care of itself.  He spent the summer after the war playing Quidditch, hanging out with Ron at night after Wheezes had closed, and visiting his Godson, until Andromeda decided to move to France.   A few things were harder to sort out.  There’d been an awkward conversation with Ginny, when he’d finally had to admit that he thought of her like a little sister, and had been dreaming of Oliver Wood on a broomstick far too often for him to be entirely straight.
“Either.  Both.  I took myself to the Leaky Cauldron yesterday, and got too drunk.  I felt awkward about calling you guys to get me home, so Hannah called Draco.  He took me to his house, and I learned, at an inopportune moment, that he has a family.”
“Good, I don’t think she knows much about the Hungarian Horntail.”  Scorpius wriggled down from his booster seat, and ran from the room to get his model Dragon.
“Your opinion is noted.” I say, and my voice is stiff.  “Thank you for your help to this point, but I’ll sort myself out from here on.”
“But…” I prompt, realizing that people rarely make statements like that without a ‘but’.
Harry nods, understanding completely.  “Later,” he murmurs.  “What do you need right now?”
“Interesting that there’s been no negative press though, only a lot of speculation about star-crossed lovers in Wartime.”
“I didn’t
Later, Draco would be unable to remember whether he kissed Harry first, or if Harry had kissed him, but it didn’t matter, because once their lips met, nothing mattered other than holding him close.  The puppy squirmed between them, and someone cleared their throat pointedly, which caused them to break apart, blushing.  “Er, well, it’s been a long trip, and I forgot to give him a chance to wee before I brought him in.  Harry, maybe we should take him outside for a bit?”  Draco said finally.
Jesus fucking Christ.  Why was this version of Harry so much more astute than the one Draco knew?  Maybe this was the sort of Harry you got when he wasn’t being abused, or stalked by a Dark Lord.  “In a way, yes.  My brain works a bit differently than most people.  I worry about people getting hurt, and sometimes I get a bit carried away.  It causes me to do a lot of things I wouldn’t ordinarily want to, in order to convince myself that they’re safe.”
“Some.”
“If I want…Draco, it’s a dog,”  Harry’s eyes had filled, and enormous tears were dripping onto the puppy’s head.  The puppy looked up at him, and tried to lick his face.  Harry laughed, which turned into a tiny sob, and tears continued to roll down his cheek unchecked.  He buried his face into the puppy’s head, and it wriggled and tried to lick the tears away.  “It’s a dog, for me.  My very own dog.”  Draco looked helplessly at Hermione, who was wiping away tears of her own.  In fact, as he looked around the room, hoping that someone would help him navigate these unexpectedly emotional waters, he noticed that many of the Weasleys were crying.
“This gets you much drunker.” Draco assured him.
For a single, insane moment, I consider yelling, “Wait!”, and offering up my magic instead, but of course I don't.  It would be stupid.  Besides, the last thing I need is Mother freaking Magic pissed off at me.  Instead, with another blinding flash of light, Mother Magic disappears, leaving Draco panting and prostate on the floor, and a golden parchment where the chalice was.  Magic is freaky, and impressive.  I also note absently that Mother Magic didn't tell him that she'd be taking Draco's
it.  I saw him send it.  Hallowe’en, right?” At Draco’s nod, she continued, “Hallowe’en is always a fairly difficult time for Harry, he misses his mum and dad.  But I saw him with that postcard, and when he sent it off with the owl, I asked him who he was sending it to.”
“Are you any good?”
“Harry,” he corrects.  “Can I come in?”
He’d fallen into a fitful sleep when his charmed Galleon warmed.  Blinking his eyes blearily, he straightened his glasses and read the message.
“I didn’t imagine I’d ever hear myself say these words, Draco, but I honestly think that you’re in a healthy enough place that, if you still wanted to pursue it, I can’t see any reason why it would be unhealthy.  I can’t imagine why you’d want to, when there are easily ten dozen men who would be less work, but…”
“Exactly!  Keep your eyes open, because an attacker wants you to be distracted.  Good job.  Second rule?”
He tells himself that until Blaise comes into the shop, an hour before closing, and flips the sign on the door.  “Grace,” Blaise calls, “take off a bit early today, yeah?”
Hermione and Ron looked at one another and laughed.  “Remember what I said Draco?  We don’t plan anymore,” Hermione said, through her giggles.  “Harry pointed out once that we plan, and then it all goes to crap anyway, and we just blunder through.  The appeal of planning rather wore off after that.”
“Why did he think that you wouldn’t let him share?”
“Luna, I’d like you to meet Malcolm,” Harry said.  “I’ve been telling him all about you.”
Pansy looked like she wanted to say something, but she stood and smoothed down her dress.  “Yes, we’re done.  I’ll send over contracts for you to sign tonight.”
“Do you know her?”
“Harry,”  he says, stopping in his tracks to look at him.  Harry absently notices that he’s not wearing shoes, which is a bold choice for November.
“You didn’t, Mother,” Draco hurried to reassure her.  “Even if you hadn’t been encouraging me to arrange the betrothal, I would still have left.  I wanted Harry to have the sort of life he deserved.”
“Oh.  Are we not friends?  I got the impression that we were.”
“That’s not true.”
For those of you who just enjoyed reading a ridiculous Lucius Malfoy, I'm still not quite done with him, and maybe someday he and Narcissa will get a ficlet of their own.
Since he hadn’t any idea why he’d set an entire family to tears, Draco started to back out of the room.  He felt like he was intruding on something, but he still wasn’t sure what.  Harry looked up then, and saw Draco awkwardly trying to escape.  His eyes, made even more shiny than usual because of the tears, looked enormous.  “Draco,” Harry said, and suddenly Draco didn’t think that he’d screwed up after all.  They stared at each other for a long moment, neither of them moving.  Then, suddenly, Harry was across the room in front of him, and he threw his arms around Draco’s neck, the puppy held awkwardly between them as Draco’s arms encircled Harry.
“Where do you get off, Blaise?  This is none of your business.  Potter doesn’t want anything to do with me, and it was
As I emerge from the Ministry, and into the sun, I consider what I’ve just done.  None of quitting my job was about Draco, not really.  I know that this decision has been brewing since my first meeting with Kingsley, but I’m a bit shaken by the finality of it.  It’s clear that the old me didn’t have much of a life, outside work, and to me…current me, that just seems like a waste.  Why didn’t I just stay dead, if all I planned to do was work, and languish in a comfortable, but ultimately unfulfilling relationship?  Still though.  I might end up furious when I get my memories back.  Ultimately, since old me isn’t around to ask, I decide to make the most of my new found freedom, and go eat some ice cream.
Harry moved closer to the bed, and, with a glance at Cici to make sure it was alright, climbed up beside his daughter and wrapped his arms around her.  Draco could see him whispering in her ear.  Draco gestured Cici to the door and stepped out into the hall.
“I am looking out for my family,” Andromeda snapped.  “Don’t forget, Draco, the Black family, your family, wanted nothing to do with me when I became a Blood Traitor.  Harry is my family.  And I will keep him safe at any cost.”  She leaned in very close to Draco’s face, and her black eyes were so devoid of warmth that Draco shuddered.  “You might recall that my little sister Bella had a rather creative approach to protecting her interests.  You should know that I taught her many of the things she knew.”
“Papa!  Did you hear that?”
Harry considered this for a moment and his smile, impossibly, widened.  “Let's go then,” he said, a little shyly.
“Yeah, about that.  Are you going to be able to fill me in on what happened?”
, Cass thought, but she smiled at her Papa anyway.
“And she doesn’t know anyone who would have a potions lab?” Draco said.  “A friend from school or something?”
“Well, we can, if you want to wait, but I imagine you’re getting tired of Hogwarts.”
“I’m very, very good at worrying about myself, Cass.  We’ve discussed this.  Plus, I have a meddling portrait and a very overprotective old lady who, apparently, is coming to visit.”  Harry’s eyes softened as he took her hand.  “You’re nine years old, my heart.  I want you to enjoy being a kid.  Adult worries will come along soon enough.”  He suddenly grinned, “Plus, you give terrible advice.”
“Do I even have to?  You know that I’m going to help him.  I have a brother, Dad, and it’s not his fault he’s sick, and it’s your fault I don’t even know him.”
Harry shrugged miserably.  “It was the first thing he said.  She’s family.  You know how he is about that.  And my position is indefensible.  I didn’t tell him he had a daughter.  He has rights, Pansy.”  He stood.  “I’ve been waiting for this to happen for ten years.  At least I got some time with her.  I remember a lot from the first ten years of my life, I’m sure Cass will too.” Saying the words made him feel so suddenly lonely, that he said, “It’s been an awfully long day.  Are we finished for now?”
I’m sitting there, listening to her passionate words, and suddenly, I feel exhausted, as though the next things she says will change everything, and I have no idea whether that will be better or so, so much worse.  “Look,” I interrupt suddenly, “maybe we shouldn’t be focusing on this right now.  We’ve got a bound Ministry employee in the basement, and we broke into the Department of Mysteries earlier, which, I imagine, has raised some questions there.  Maybe let’s just…leave off this for a while, and figure out what to do with Wendell.”
“Why did we bother fighting a war, Hermione?”  I bang my fist on the table and she jumps.  “Sorry,” I say hastily, “but it’s true.  If we’re just going to replace their prejudices with ours, what’s the point?”
“Seven miscarriages.  Before Violet.  Seven desperately longed-for babies that I wasn’t able to carry to term.  Seven children that I lost, and grieved, and-”  Her words cut off in a bitter little sob.  Harry was filled with enormous compassion for the woman.
“Or a Muggle.”
“I’m afraid,” Draco admitted.  “This was probably the last day I’ll spend with him.”
“Idiot.  You’re my person.  You’re my family.  Besides, we’re wizards.  It’s not like we can’t get Portkeys anytime we want.”
Harry laughed.  “He does sound like a nutter.  Imagine being afraid of a baby!”
“And yet he’s not staying in anyone else’s spare room.”
The next memory is of a showdown with someone who’s clearly Lord Voldemort.  I can’t really bring myself to listen to what the younger me, and the terrifying snake-man are saying, but it’s interesting to watch the spectators.  They’re looking at old Harry like he’s some sort of saviour.  He’s so young.  Why would people follow this child onto a battlefield?  Because it's clear from their expressions that they would…or
His smile is sad.  “I’m not exactly objective.  And I don’t really know what the right answer is.  I fell in love with ‘old Harry’, as you call him.  You’re scornful and dismissive of some of his best qualities, qualities I miss.”
I remember an unwavering fixation to stalk around in my invisibility cloak to figure out what was going on, and determined grey eyes across a Quidditch pitch, and a hunched figure crying desperately over a broken sink.  I remember how not identifying someone can be as heroic as a broom rescue over an inferno.  I remember a set of dimples, and a cheeky smirk, and a father who would give his magic to save his son, and how when those grey eyes look into mine, I feel seen, and treasured.
“Can I come?”
He looks at me strangely for a moment, and then grins.  “I already have an old house, and a pile of mad house elves.  I couldn’t possibly have another.”
“Never mind,” Draco said, “I’ll figure something out.”
“I must insist.”
Luna had fetched the album cover.  “Nina Simone,” Harry muttered.  “Luna, I know this song.  I
Like that morning, when Harry had been late for work, and had stolen a piece of perfectly buttered toast from Draco’s hand as he raced through the kitchen looking for his wand.  Draco had been outraged, and his offended gasp had made Harry smile all the way to the office.  Harry had heard about it when he’d brought Draco a conciliatory sandwich at lunchtime.  “It’s about
There’s a tiny, savage part of Draco that feels redemption, like a lock clicking home.  The childish, self-destructive part of Draco’s personality that registers that he’s struck back, that someone else is damaged as much as Draco has been.  The rest of him feels as though he’s suddenly died.  That he’s been cruel to the one person who deserves it least.  But, he stubbornly ignores that part, and clings to the petty, stupid part of himself that affirms that what he’s done is right.
“Very well.  I’ll send you formal notice within the week, Minister, but thank you for your consideration.”
“I just got defensive.  I don’t like feeling like an idiot, and I don’t think she sees me as capable.”
“No, I’d love to, but I…just need to…um.”
As manners dictated, Draco didn’t say anything about her abrupt departure, but after a few moments of awkward silence, Draco said, “So do you think that you’ll be able to approve Scorpius’ application?”
“I know,” Draco’s voice was heavy with unshed tears.  “It’s the worst thing I could have done.  I wanted to be a hero for you.  I wanted to sacrifice myself for you like you’d done for everyone else.  I wanted you to have your happily ever after, and I saw how much you loved Teddy, and...” Draco felt his lips form the shape of a little sob, and couldn’t keep it from escaping.  He took a breath, tried to get his shaking voice under control.  “I was so afraid that you’d end up staying with me out of loyalty.  I know what you’re like, Harry.  If someone threatens someone you care about, you’ll do anything to protect them.  I wanted to protect you for once.  You deserve so much happiness, and Andromeda seemed so certain that you were betrothed to Ginny.  I realized that if I stayed, you'd give it up for me, give up Teddy, and your wife.”
Draco’s voice was low, and dangerous, and Harry’s heart felt like it had stopped.  He’d been terrified of this moment for ten years, but hearing Draco confirm the only thing that he ever truly feared, was worse than he’d imagined.  He tried vainly to get a breath, but it wasn’t working.  His heart seemed to notice that it had lost track of things, and so it sped to catch up, and then, all Harry could hear was its thumping.  His vision started to grey around the edges.  Suddenly, cool hands were bracketing his face, and Astoria was there, directly in his dimming line of sight.  “Okay,” she said.  “You’re okay, Harry.  Just focus on my voice.  You’re here, and you’re okay.”
Draco freezes.  “What?”
, he thought, but instead he touched her cheek gently and encouraged her to get some rest.
Heedless of the onlookers, Harry gathered Scorpius in his arms and touched his hand to the portkey he wore on a charm around his wrist.  They spun away, landing in the Welcome Witch’s hall at St. Mungo’s.  “DMAC Emergency,” Harry barked, and sprinted the three flights of stairs to the Magical Accidents ward.
“’s fine.  He’s playing with Violet.”
“Thank you for wanting her,” he answered, and took off towards the ground.
Running does help, and clearly I do it a lot, because a half hour later, I’m still running smoothly, no sign of exhaustion or pain.  My thoughts are blissfully tranquil.  I listen to the slap of my trainers against the ground, and the methodical sound of my breath.  I’m aware of the wind against my face, drying the sweat, and the tension that I didn’t even realize I was carrying dispels with each footfall.  It’s nearing dark by the time I return to Ron and Hermione’s, and, once I’m showered and back in the living room, gratefully accepting a beer, I feel much better.
“And even though I contract to the Ministry, it’s never been public knowledge,” Draco said, a little ruefully.  The Ministry had been desperate for someone with Draco’s skills, but insisted that he sign a binding magical non-disclosure agreement to prevent him from publicizing the arrangement.  They were clearly trying to avoid the bad publicity that would result from having an ex-Death Eater working with the DMLE, but unfortunately, it hadn’t done anything to restore Draco’s reputation.  Before he’d been completely housebound, he still got hexed and spat on in Diagon Alley.  Yet another thing that Paul had been unable to live with, he recalled.
“Pretty much,” Pansy agrees.
“I doubt that.  You don’t seem to have the same crippling ambition that he did.  It would be a lot of work to become a Dark Lord, and you seem to want to work in an ice cream parlour.”
Her face is stunned.  “Well, of course I can, Mister Potter.”  She looks at me strangely.  “This seems a bit out of character, if I might say.  The last time you were here, Miss Granger had to drag you, and you refused to try anything on.  Then you got into a terrible argument and stormed away.”
That surprises me, especially because, as I consider it, it’s true, sort of.  “Kind of, but not exactly.  It’s like I’ve forgotten things, but I’m not sure what.  I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything to be guilty about.”
“Alright then.”  Grace puts her wand into her back pocket and leaves without another word.
“You can call me Harry, if you don’t mind,” Harry said.  “I was hoping that you could take these up to the owlry for me, and have them delivered immediately.  Would that be okay?”
“What have you done?”
“I think we’re reaching the outer edges of how many times the Obliviators are willing to intervene,” Harry replied, his voice gentle.
“Are you seriously asking me that?  You can’t be forgetting what’s at stake.  If I get this wrong, then Harry’s going to die.”
, it had the added benefit of making them completely aware of the passage of time around them.  Aurors used it to subdue rioting Quidditch Fans, but Harry had found that, in the aftermath of accidental magic, it gave him the ability to take stock.
“Draco?”  Hermione Weasley-Granger was standing in the doorway to her office.  “Come on through.”
His mouth twists.  “The old Potter would have been furious, or tried to fight to keep me.”
“Merlin, Mister Potter, we’d never be able to pay you what you’d deserve.”
“Mommy?”  The voice inside the room was tiny, and Harry could hear that the child was scared.  “Is my punishment over?”
Draco felt dangerously close to tears, and so he took a step backward, and was about to whirl around and run from the house when he heard Harry’s voice say, “Draco?”  He looked at Harry, who was handing the baby off to Hermione.  His face was unreadable now, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was about to hex him, or maybe to shout at Draco about how stupid and presumptuous he was.  “Can I see what you brought me?”
“You’re just going to leave?  With no destination in mind?”
“So it is,” Draco agreed, stretching and giving a final longing glance at his fluffy duvet.  “Shall we have pancakes for breakfast?”
“But I don’t have any, not anymore.  I quit my job at the Ministry.  My biggest responsibility now is making sure that the ice cream scoops are cleaned after each serving.”
He escaped to the bathroom, took another vial of Pepper-Up from the cabinet, and showered, cleaning every part of his body with a separate portion of the flannel.  As he emerged from the loo, his hair still wet, he heard little voices in the nursery.  They weren’t using words, but the babies happily babbled to each other.  Harry seemed shocked to find someone in his crib with him.  His pudgy hand held Rose’s and he placed a disgustingly wet kiss on her cheek.  She giggled and pushed him over.
“But you’re going back?”  After, she meant.  After she was dead, and Draco was alone.
Kreacher returned with a crisp white linen napkin, and as he bent down to tie it around Harry’s neck, the child flinched as though expecting to be struck.  “‘M Sorry!” Before Draco could react, Harry had disappeared under the table.
“I almost lost my mind when she got hurt tonight.”
“Excellent, Draco.  That’s amazing progress.  I wondered, though, what does this have to do with Harry?”
“Of course I can, Draco, honestly.  I’m not a child.”
Draco thought for a moment.  “I think I’d say that I was sorry he was so hurt by what I did.  It’s a terrible thing to have your trust abused, and I’d never have wished that for him.  But, I also wouldn’t have done things any differently, not on the whole.  If Harry
“Took an elbow to the face during a game.  Muggles don’t know ‘episky’.”
All of his good humour gone, George dispelled the rest of the wards with a wave of his wand.  As the door creaked open, Ron and Hermione rushed in, and George stood, completely still, in the hallway.
He wasn’t supposed to be on call the next day, but Tamsin had received a letter from her Mother, and Harry knew that their relationship was already a torn and broken thing.  She had floo called him early, begging Harry to switch shifts with her.  Harry had agreed instantly.  He was a big proponent of maintaining family relationships.  Nonetheless, he’d hoped for a simple, event-free shift.  Other than his follow up visit with Malcolm, the morning had proceeded quietly, but just before eleven, as Harry was sitting in the canteen, eating a late breakfast, his Galleon warmed.
It takes more than a second.  He holds Scorpius tightly, and buries his nose into his little neck, and he cries, which freaks the baby out, so he cries too.  I stand, passively watching, uncomfortable with all the feelings, and I hope that it ends soon.  As it turns out, I don’t have to do anything, because that’s when Ron and Hermione show up.  Draco lets them through the wards, and I have an unbearable urge to just run out the front door, and keep running, down the stupidly long driveway, past the ridiculous peacocks that roam the grounds, through the ostentatious gates with the giant ‘M’ in stylized wrought iron, and just keep running down the country road until I find a place where none of this is a problem.  I have no idea if old Harry was any good at dealing with conflict, but the Harry I am now is shit at it.
“Yes, but he will come back to you as well, Harry.”
“Yell!”
Draco’s mouth went dry.  She knew.  Somehow she knew.  He looked wildly toward the stairs, considering just fleeing from this.
Harry looked at Malfoy, who gestured him to a seat.  “I’d appreciate knowing what happened,” he said.
“What about a contraceptive potion?  Could she have told your mum that?”  Draco asked.
“I got an email from him yesterday, saying as much.  He needs some time, he said.  He asked me to keep an eye out for you.”
George sits next to Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordon on his other side.  They speak quietly to him, and at one point, Harry is pleased to see a little smile appear on his face, even if it drifts away just as quickly.  Percy and his girlfriend Audrey appear, followed by Bill and Fleur.  As the night passes, Harry looks at Molly and Arthur, taking in their weary countenance.  “Maybe you might like some rest?”
“What was that about?” Draco asked.
“Well, you were a child!  And the offside rule is
Please come see me in my office first thing tomorrow morning.
I’m about to open the window when Violet screeches, “Wait!”  My arm skids off the windowsill and I look at her in alarm.  “You didn’t cast the spells.”
“Well that’s no good.”
“Later,” I beg.
“Okay,” Draco said.  He waited a moment, in case Harry would take pity on him, and save him from having this conversation in front of a horde of curious Weasleys, but Harry merely looked at him, the polite, not-entirely-hostile look planted firmly on his face.  Well, fine.  Harry didn’t trust him to be alone with him, but he’d come all this way, and Harry’s present was getting awfully heavy.  Fine.  He’d do this stupid thing, and lay his heart bare for Harry, and then it would be over, and he could go to the Manor and the elves would give him brandy, and his Mother would say comforting things.
“I don’t think you understand how unwilling people are to help her.”
“Yes Mister Potter!”
I raise my eyebrows.  “Formal notice of my resignation, of course.  I can’t possibly support a Ministry that doesn’t support equality for all.  And I can’t work for a Minister that doesn’t allow my past actions to speak for my character.  I wish you the best, Kingsley.”
“Thanks,” he said roughly, and he summoned a hoodie, shoved his feet into a pair of ratty trainers and disappeared into the night.  The minute his feet hit the steps of the porch, he started running, and he didn’t stop until his lungs felt like they were on fire, and his t-shirt was soaked with sweat.  He turned and started walking back, but as he passed a park, he diverted, and sat on one of the empty swings.  Not far away, he could hear laughter and talking from a group of kids.  Teenagers, likely drinking underneath the bleachers near the baseball field.  He pushed himself with his feet, feeling the wind cooling his sweat-soaked hair.  He closed his eyes for a minute, pretending that was yesterday, before this had happened.
“Harry, I’m a professional.  Whatever schoolboy conflict you continue to have with Draco is none of my concern.  I can promise you that if you hire me, you can rely on my discretion, my secrecy, and I will advocate for you, not let my personal friendships sway me.”
“What’s a…Harry,” Draco said, a sudden sinking feeling joining the usual roiling anxiety in his belly, “how much do you know about magic?”
“You think you might not?”
“Good idea.  Very smooth.”
She grins.  “Yes, that one.  It seems someone has filled you in on the important details.”
think that you can stay balanced, but I wanted to know that you’d considered it.”
“No, not in the slightest.  We’ll also hire a security firm who will ensure that they deal with any intrusive photographers or fans.”
“Merlin, I hope not.  Draco, come back to me.  Be with me.  I don’t even care if we stay here, in your poncy Muggle condo.  I just don’t want to waste another fucking second.”
Hermione wrinkled her nose at the rats, but obligingly summoned a scalpel.  Some time later, she said, “It’s strange, isn’t it, that the magic seemed to overwhelm them.”
“Scotland,” Cass corrected.  “If I’m going there, I want to see Hogwarts.”
“I am.  I love wandcrafting, and it’s nice to be back where I had a lot of happy times.”
“Hmm.”
“Ah well,” I say.  “Mrs. Weasley will be pleased.  And he can’t be worse than the man he’s replacing.”
“Of course I do.”
“Harry," Miriam smiled at him, and the kindness of her eyes, and the gentleness of her face was too much.  He looked away, ashamed.  She placed two fingers on his wrist.  "I think that you’ve been keeping it together for a long time now, and your mind and your body are telling you that you need to take care of yourself.  I’ve met Cass, she’s wonderful.  You’re doing a great job, and I’m certain that, very soon, you’ll be back to continue where you left off.”
“But what about the postcard?” Lara asked.  “Now that you have a little distance from the event, I wondered if you’d considered what it meant.”
Kreacher, who nearly wept when he found out that Draco was coming over, appears with two glasses of dark liquid.  “Master Malfoy, Kreacher wishes that he could be welcoming the true Black heir to the Noble and Ancient House of Black, but it is still being an honour to see you here.”
“No darling.  You’d know this if you bothered to firecall, or owl.”
“What?”
“Dad,” Cass laughed.  “Remember when my hockey coach called me a hopeless idiot because I was offside?”
There’s a diary sitting on my desk, amongst a pile of parchment that all seem to be case files (surprise, surprise!).  I flip the diary open, and page backward.  Court dates, mostly.  The only people I seem to see with any regularity are Ron and Hermione.  There’s a healer appointment a month back, with the annotation ‘wild magic’, but knowing me, it’s research for a fucking case.
“No, he can stay.  Of course he will want to spend time with his sister,” Astoria said.
“That’s not much to go on, is it?” I say.
He looks gobsmacked for a moment, before he smooths his expression.  “You’re joking.”
Cass met Draco’s eyes, and gave him a little smile.  “Thank you,” Draco said to Cass, and she shrugged it off, looking about as comfortable with the attention as Harry had been back in school.
“So you can take him, now?”
It’s clear that Mill has had a bit of a
“I don’t get it.”
Hermione looked conflicted.  “You have to promise me not to breathe a word of this to anyone.  I’d never abuse Harry’s trust if you didn’t absolutely need to know this.  I don’t know if you ever heard, but Harry and I spent a fair bit of our…camping holiday during seventh year…on our own.  We got separated from Ron, and, well, there was a lot of time with just Harry and I, alone in a tent.”
Harry handed Draco Cass’ overnight bag.  “I wasn’t sure what your plans were, so I’ve packed a lot.  Formal robes, Muggle clothes, and everything in between.”
Harry fidgeted with the neckline of his stiff, scratchy robes.  He absolutely hated the way that formal wizarding clothing felt.  He wasn’t sure if it was because he’d not grown up wearing it, but they always made him feel like an imposter.  Cass stood next to him, wearing her own set of robes.  She looked impossibly grown up, and Harry could already see a tiny hint of what she’d look like as a woman.  It made him simultaneously want to clutch her close in pride, and weep in a corner that she wasn’t a baby anymore.
His brow furrows.  “Formal notice?  What do you mean, Harry?”
“Where are you going?”
“I understand, Harry.  You’ve just summarized the great struggle of my life.  How do I balance the duality of what I am?  The man and the wolf?”
I don’t look at him as I tuck myself away, and I say nothing as I walk through the alley.  Despite my release, it didn’t compare to the bliss that sex with Draco brought.  Deflated, inexplicably ashamed, I decide to head home, but as I’m walking past the line in front of the club, which now snakes even farther down the sidewalk, a distinctive flash of blond catches my peripheral vision.  I can’t apparate, not from here, but I walk more quickly.  “Harry!”
“Draco, it’s bad.  Harry was…he
“Are you seeing someone?” Hermione asked.  “I sort of assumed that your parents would go the arranged marriage route, after the War ended.”
“What’s that about?” Ron asks.
“It’s pretty.”  Harry reaches a tentative finger towards the delicate crystal amulet, and Draco slaps it away.  “Sorry.”  He grins sheepishly.
“I won’t, and you can’t keep me here.  You’re a nutter,” Harry said mulishly.
“Draco, darling,” Pansy kissed his cheek.  “Do you have any responsibilities today?”
“Mama, you look tired, please, can’t you sit for a moment?”
Just like that, I
“Okay.”
,” Harry said, his tone turning a bit pleading.  “I didn’t want to wreck things for you, and Cass and I, we would have complicated things so much.  I know that I didn’t fit in to your image rehabilitation plans, and I told myself that Cass didn't either.  I mean, I didn’t really think of much, right then.  I was a bit...upset, but I’ve thought about it since then.”
“You can thank us by dropping our reports off at the office,” one wheedled.
“Missed you,” Harry breathed softly, pressing a soft kiss against Draco’s pulse point.  Draco’s arms tightened around Harry, his face buried into Harry’s sleep-rumpled hair.  Harry’s hands ghosted down Draco’s sides, his rising erection warm and persistent against Draco’s hip.  Before Draco could do anything, Harry had slithered down the bed and took Draco’s cock into his mouth.  Draco felt a gasp escape his parted lips, Harry’s tongue and lips and the warmth of his mouth around his cock.
After the initial three dates, Harry had detected an initial softening of Draco’s attitude.  It wasn’t easy and the changes were subtle.  Draco was still prickly and difficult, prone to snide comments and offended silences.  Harry was…smitten.  He liked how Draco was all sharp edges and angles, how it took effort to push past the boundaries that Draco had built up to prevent being hurt.  He loved how, every once in a while, he’d catch Draco looking at him with a little wrinkle in his brow, as though Draco were trying to figure out what the catch was.
“I am, Draco.  I’m alive.  I’m here.”
“That’s nice,” Potter replies, leaning closer again.  Draco feels the hair on his arm standing up in reaction.  “It was a rubbish game anyway.  Did you have a good time?”
Draco felt tears prickling at the back of his throat, and swallowed hard to prevent a wail from escaping.  If he allowed himself to, he’d never stop crying.  Fortunately, his breakdown was diverted by the arrival of his ex-wife.
“I’ll be there in ten minutes.”
“And even though it’s stupid, don’t say so, okay?”  Harry was begging now.  Draco felt as though Harry was about to pluck out his heart and present it to them both.  He supposed he was.
“Take care of who?”
“Ah, so it was a girl?”  Hermione had been heavily pregnant the last time he’d seen her.
Eight days later, the silence was interrupted by the arrival of a tiny owl, who twittered and chirped at Draco as he struggled to stay aloft.  He had a scroll tied to his leg, and the tiny owl could barely stay still as Draco untied it.  “There now, you daft thing,” he said, and the owl gave a joyful hoot in response.
“Alright”
Draco ignored a tiny stab of sadness, that he wasn’t able to comfort Harry, and went to floocall the Headmistress, who ordered him aside, thundered through the floo, and flew through the corridors of St Mungo’s like a woman possessed.  “Harry,” she said from the door.  He looked up, and from behind Minerva’s back, Draco thought he looked eleven years old again.
“Thanks, lads,” Harry said.
“But wasn’t I going there anyway?”
“Master Harry has returned,” the thing says.  Its voice is deep and gravelly.  I assume that it’s a male, but what do I know?
“Teddy?  The Weasleys?  Minerva, who’s died, because you’re obviously here to tell me that someone has.”
“You’re horrible.  And I love you."
“I’m sure he’s disappointed too, but he has a lot on his mind,” she says softly.  “He likes you very much, you know.”  I look at her in surprise.  I haven’t told Luna that I’m gay, and I didn’t bother mentioning Draco either.  I feel like Hermione would have warned me if Luna was a mind-reader, though, so maybe she’s just scarily perceptive.  Funny though, that my two best friends were gobsmacked that I’m gay, and Luna seems to have known all along.
“Ah,” I say, “just the
It was only later, when he was standing by the lake at Hogwarts that Harry realized.  He hadn’t even told Draco about the baby.  For a moment, he had been suffused with hope.  Maybe if he told Draco, it would change everything.  He would change his mind, realize that he and Harry
“Here,” I say, coming into the lounge, where I spot a little girl, looking around imperiously.  She has Mill’s red hair, and is a sturdy little thing. Her eyes are a stunning shade of blue, and she wears thick glasses that keep sliding down her nose.
“Why don’t you have wards?”
Draco is so brittle that it looks like he might shatter, but he steps back and allows Harry in.  He pours two glasses of Fire Whiskey without asking whether Harry wants one.  They sit, awkwardly, neither looking at the other until Harry blurts out, “You kissed me.”
A whisper of a memory, more emotion than thought, ripples through me at his words, and I’m overcome by rage.  Despite Draco’s tugging pull on me, I’m on my feet before I know it, and the words escape me without any conscious planning.  “How dare you!”
by this.  I will never be the same.”  He takes a step towards the door.  “Is that what you wanted to know?”
She’s wearing a dressing gown, and her hair is wet.  “Harry!”
They stepped into the room, and Harry looked around with interest.  The room was large, with enormous windows that faced the gardens.  A four-post bed with the curtains drawn took up much of one corner, and and ancient desk, passed down from his mother’s side, occupied another.  High backed chairs were clustered around the fire, and doors led to a large ensuite bathroom and closet, respectively.  A high shelf encircled the room, and Draco’s eyes instinctively sought out its contents.
“Anything else?  Something experimental?” Draco said.  He knew he was begging, but he didn’t care.  He would crawl on his hands and knees across broken glass if it gave Scorpius a chance.
Harry shrunk Scorpius’ robes for him, and placed them in his pocket, prompting a “Thanks, Dad,” before he raced off to say one last goodbye to his mates.  Harry and Cass chattered a mile a minute, trying to catch one another up on everything that had happened in the three days since they’d last exchanged owls.  Draco looked on, not feeling the need to engage in the conversation.  Sometimes, he just liked to watch.
The moment the door closed behind them, Cass turned to Harry.  “Dad, I don’t like him.”
“Merlin, you have been busy, Harry.  I could call Neville, ask him to come from Hogwarts.”
“What do you mean, darling?”
The next day, he was grateful that it was a quiet morning at the office.  Tamsin was coming off shift, and she fetched lattes for them from the nice shop on the corner, which they drank companionably while catching up.  Tamsin told him about a lovely family she met, and she seemed…better.  Less obsessed with catching every kid that might possibly fall through the bureaucratic cracks.  She yawned, and hugged him, and headed home to catch some sleep.
The look she gives me is pained.  “Harry-”
“There is no
Draco
It was a work of moments for Harry to confirm the Reversal and Obliviation Squads.  They’d sort the rest of the partygoers out.  Once they were seated around the table, Harry stifled a little grin.  This was his absolute favourite part of his job.  “I told you that my name was Harry, and that’s true, but I did mislead you a little when I arrived.  I’m not actually a Police Officer.  I’m an Integration Specialist, and I work for my Government, in the Department of Magical Accidents.”
Draco glares at her.  “This is an abomination of a research study, and an abysmal violation of Harry’s human rights.  How could you possibly be a party to this?”  I don’t think I’ve seen Draco look so furious, and so sad, and considering what’s happened so far today, that’s saying something.
“Thank him?  Mother, why on earth would I thank him?  I was humiliated.”
The girls jumped up.  Harry watched, but was quickly satisfied that there was no odd girl out.  Soon, he could hear little voices yelling, with authority, “Back off! I don’t know you!  Go away!”
“What do you want?”
Hermione laughed.  “Oh those sardines.  I don’t think I’ve eaten fish of any sort since then.  But that’s a good observation, about your Dad’s stories.  He tells the stories, and leaves out the context, the impact.  It’s always been that way.  Your dad didn’t have an easy time while he lived in England, quite the opposite, really.  Even still, I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve seen him cry, in all the years I’ve known him.  I think that Harry has a lot of loss and pain that he has been suppressing.  I don’t think it’s a bad thing that he’s working through them.”
Her days became routine, and lengthened into weeks, and she and Scorpius did lessons, and visited the Manor, and went to Diagon with Papa and Astoria.  But still, Cass worried about her Dad.  His emails were short, usually just one line, but they kept coming, even if they got further and further apart, and Cass’ stomach would hurt until the next one came.
“He goes to a Muggle School, surprisingly, and little Scorpius-”
“I know,” Hermione agreed miserably, “but honestly, it makes more sense than Harry taking some as-yet undiscovered mind-altering potion.  He’s an Auror, Draco, it’s all he’s ever wanted to be.  He doesn’t even take headache potions when he’s on-duty.  He took a little too much dreamless sleep just before he defeated Voldemort, and it scared him.  He was terrified of being addicted.  Any time I’ve been at a party with him, he refuses Gillyweed.  He doesn’t even drink really, just Butterbeer.  He doesn’t care if anyone else does it, but he’s horrified at being out of control himself.  It just doesn’t track.”
“You look exceptionally fit, my darling.  Except…” she scrutinized his face, her expression sharpening.  “Whatever has happened to your nose?”
Giving it up as a bad job, he summoned a house elf.  The one who had guided them to their quarters returned, and looked around the chambers for Cass.  Her disappointment at not seeing her was evident.  “What’s your name?” Harry asked.
Severus and Minerva exchanged glances and then looked at Harry.  “Don’t,” he said softly, his hands raised as though to ward them off.  He had a sudden urge to go find a corner to hide in, somewhere small, and safe.  Like a…like a cupboard.  Instead, he went into his study, closed the door firmly, and crawled into the armchair by the window.  This was Cass’ chair, really.  When Harry was balancing his accounts, or reading at his desk, she liked to curl up here with a book, or her sketchpad.  They would work companionably together on rainy days, the only sounds the crackling of the fire, the scratching of Harry’s quill, and the raindrops on the window.
Draco
“It’s true, Draco,” Harry said cheerfully, “I do sleep in a bed nearly every single night, just like a real human.”
He’d noticed that, from time to time, Hermione would give him an appraising look, as though to gauge his emotional stability, and she did this now.  Draco gave her a tight smile, and she quickly looked away, but he was secretly grateful that she understood that this was beyond a stretch of his fortitude.
“We did.  I’m…I’m sorry, Weasley.  It’s never easy when someone in your family betrays you.”
“Did it all mean so little to you that you can just pick me up when I fall through your door, and put me to bed and send me away?  Don’t you care at all?”
“Thank you, little duck.”
“What is it?”  There’s no answer for a long time, long enough that Harry suspects that he’s not going to get a response at all.
The front door closes and Harry listens for the distant sound of Draco apparating away.  When it becomes obvious that Draco isn’t going to come back, he drags the blanket from his bed, still smelling of them, and climbs the stairs.  As he climbs out onto the rooftop patio, he wraps the blanket around him, inhaling deeply.  He stares at the stars until the sun rises.
“No, what’s actually going to happen is that I’m going to take you to a very, very special place.  It belongs to a friend of mine, and she’s going to take wonderful care of you until we sort things out with your parents.”
“No,” I say.  “Nevermind.  I’ll just go walk it off or something.  Sorry to drag you out like this.”  I feel stupid.  I’ve probably ruined things with Draco, and I’ve alienated my family.  I’m a judgemental arsehole about the person I used to be, but at least he had more people than me.  Hermione said I’m different, but I don’t know how to be old Harry.  I start to walk down the cobblestones, headed vaguely in the direction of the ice cream parlour.
“I know,” Harry said, a bit gleefully, switching the chick back with the teacup.  “I was just as shocked as you are when I learned about magic.  Violet, there’s a whole world about to open up to you, and I’m absolutely delighted to get to tell you about it.  What happened today, the lizard?  That’s called accidental magic, and it happens when a young witch or wizard experiences strong emotions.  Mr and Mrs. Powers, I know that this is an enormous shock, but there are loads of people who will be here to support you.”
“Ugh, really?”  I sigh.  What else
It’s brief:
Days passed, and Draco found the silence and solitude almost impossible to bear.  He struggled with his thoughts, and his survival was hour by hour.  Sometimes, he’d get lost in his rituals, and gradually come back to awareness, some time later, his hands cracked and bleeding from their rough treatment as he cleaned and scrubbed.  Not knowing how Harry was doing was nearly impossible to bear, and occasionally, he’d become so frantic that he would crouch by the fire, breath coming in gasps, trying to muster the courage to floo-call Hermione.  He prevailed, however.  Harry didn’t want him, not anymore.
The silence that follows is companionable.  Draco turns to face him.  “What’s going on behind those big, sad eyes,” he asks, but Harry doesn’t feel pressured to answer.
“Now that we’re both getting our breaths properly, I want to make sure of a couple of things.  First of all, does any part of you hurt?  Your chest, your head?”
“Dad, he needs to understand!”
“Hello, Malcolm,” Harry said gently.  “My name is Harry.  I’m here to help you.”
“Do you think that will appease the press?”
“What do I do?” I ask.
“Yes.  Your dad saw the paperwork, and I’m sure that he thought that I’d been trying to trick him all along.  I don’t know for sure how that made him feel, but I have a good idea.  I think that he was already afraid that he wasn’t doing a good job as your parent, and when he concluded that I planned to sue you, he signed the papers, and he left.”
We return to the summoning spell, but my casting is sloppy.  “Harry,” Luna says, with her mild-mannered version of impatience.  “I can barely see you for the Wrackspurts.  Do we need to reschedule?”
“Any rules I should be aware of?”
“No,” Harry suddenly remembered.  The Custody papers.  Fleeing back to Canada.  The days of crying, and spending hours mustering up the ability to peck out a short email to Cass.  The failure.  “She’s Draco’s now.”
She touched his arm, and he shook his head a little, then smiled at her.  “I’m fine,” he said dreamily.  “Thanks for coming to get me, guys.”
“Perhaps,” she says, placing a surprisingly warm hand on my shoulder as she stands, “it is a story with no moral, and you must find the answer yourself.”
I grin.  “I think I can manage that.”
“What will happen?” I ask.
“So you were one too?”
Madame looked closely at Cass, waved her wand a few times, and summoned a tray from one of the shelves behind her.  “Could you please touch each of the materials in this tray, and tell me if any of them feel differently?”
“I’ll go with you,” he says, “if you want me to.”
As Harry entered the conference room where the press had been gathered, he immediately wanted to turn and flee.  He’d never seen so many reporters, not even when he’d been awarded his Order of Merlin.  The moment they caught sight of them, the sound of shutters clicking was so overwhelming, Harry could barely think.  He turned to Cass.  “Alright?”
Cass gave him a little glare, and Harry grinned unrepentantly at her.  Until Draco murmured, sotto voce,  “Wonder where she gets that from.”  The smile faltered, until he noticed Cass looking at him, and he forced it back.
“Wendell may be on to something, Potter.  I think you might be showing signs of latent Dark Lordiness.”
“Ah, never underestimate the way that unrequited love shuts down match-making attempts.”
want to do.
“What if we don’t want it?” Mrs. Powers asked flatly.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.  “Should I have done something differently?”
“Hello Dungeon bat.  Have a nice day?”  Harry opened his (non-owl) mail methodically, but spared a glance to the portrait that took up much of the wall above the fireplace.
“I don’t think that Harry was hugged very much.”
In his anxiety over Harry, Draco didn’t even realize before he was stepping through the floo into the offices at Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes.  For a moment, his stomach lurched, and he thought he’d stop breathing, but Hermione gave him an urgent look, and he blinked hard and shook his head to try to clear his thoughts, and raced up the stairs after her.
“Okay, well, I guess the first thing that you need to know is that this information is about your Papa, your other biological father.”
“You can’t know this, not having been a part of his sessions so far, but Harry had made a great deal of progress.  When he came to us, he wouldn’t have been able to articulate any of the things he did today, and he stayed remarkably calm while doing so.”
“But you’ve never seen him actually take anything?  You’ve never found a vial, or an envelope full of powder?”
Draco smiled.  “Harry, could you come here for a minute?”  Harry hesitated, and Draco said, “Potter, now please.”  He kept his voice friendly, but firm.  The effect on Harry was immediate.  He sighed heavily, and shuffled over.  His eyes remained on the floor, thumb firmly in his mouth.  Draco noticed that he was shaking.  “Thank you,” Draco said softly.  He crouched down and tried to catch his eyes, but Harry refused to look at him.  “I know that you’re probably confused and scared now.  My name is Draco, and I am going to take care of you.  In order to do that, I have to make sure that you’re healthy.” He showed Harry his wand.  “This is what I’m going to use to take some measurements.  I won’t touch you, and it won’t hurt, not even a little bit.  Will you let me try?  You can say stop at any time.”
“That’s bollocks!”
“The timing is weird.  He and I talked on the morning that he left, and we agreed that we’d stay in England for a while.  He was fine then.  He went to arrange a portkey, and something happened.  He was different, when he came to say goodbye to me.”
“Poor Harry,” she says, patting my arm.  “It must be awfully confusing when you have so many ingrained responses, but no context for why you’re feeling that way.”
“I know, but seriously.  You look like you have a rash.”
As they listened, something further unclenched within Harry, and he had found, for the first time in years, tears pricking at his eyes.  “It’s okay, Harry,” Luna had whispered.  “You can let go.”
Hermione and Ron weren’t able to come for the next dose of potion, and so it was Draco and Harry, alone in Draco’s lab.  “I can’t wait to see how big I get,” Harry said shyly.  He’d been getting a little braver each day, had stopped cringing as though Draco would hit him.  Yesterday, he’d looked as though he was about to take Draco’s hand, but he pulled away at the last minute, leaving Draco simultaneously relieved and a bit disappointed.  He’d had to clean the kitchen for a few hours after that.
“I wasn’t the slightest bit unsafe last night.”
He nods, and I place another kiss, butterfly soft, on his kiss-bruised lips.  “Goodnight, Draco.”  I smile at him, and then twist on my heel and apparate home.
wouldn’t be calling him Master.
“It has nothing to do with Draco Malfoy, sir.  If you consider it a while, I’m sure you’ll see that.”  I turn and leave the office, smiling at Agnes as I walk by her desk.
“My son has been taken.  I wish to gift you with some of my magic, and petition you to lead me to him.”
Ron digests this for a moment, and, unexpectedly, grins.  “So you’re the other woman?”
“Harry!”
“I’m trying to figure out whether you’re cruel, stupid, or simply too blind to see what’s in front of your nose,” Blaise says airily.
“Will you be sad if they don’t?”
Draco’s face shuttered.  “I haven’t read the Prophet since my parents died.”
“She could get hurt.”
“I can’t see you anymore, Harry.”
And just like that, Harry felt the bottom disappear from his stomach.  All along, he’d been telling himself that it hadn’t mattered, what he and Draco had, because he and Astoria were so obviously happy.  But a sham marriage, designed to produce an Heir?  It felt cheap, and Harry was so bitterly disappointed that he couldn’t speak right away.
After Draco leaves, Harry removes him from the wards.  Then he gets spectacularly drunk and destroys his library.  He wakes the following morning, sticky dried blood on his face from shattered glass hitting him in the face as he smashed and rampaged.  The snake had come in sometime in the night and lies curled around him.  Harry pets the snake on the head and tries not to think of the future.
“You’ve seen me dance, Professor,” Harry says lightly, but he gets up and goes to the bar anyway.  The night dissolves into shots, and Harry
“Kreacher is to be preparing Master Harry’s breakfast?” He sounds pretty hopeful, but I’m not really sure I trust him with food preparation.  He doesn’t look exactly clean.
“You may as well call me Ron, since we’re in this up to our necks.  I’d say he’s about 15 months or so.”
It bugs me that Draco has misled me, certainly, and it rankles far more that Hermione is right in saying Draco wasn’t to be trusted.  I’ll have to admit as much to her, and provide her with more ammunition that I’m incapable of making my own decisions.  What really bothers me, though, is that I’m so fucking
,” Draco said fervently, but managed to pick Potter back up and held him as close as he was able to.  When his eyes finally remained closed, Draco cast a levitation spell on the baby, and he bobbed along at Draco’s hairline while he started to mend his lab.
“Perhaps you could go fetch Aunt Andromeda?  I haven’t told her yet.  She knows that Mother’s been sick, but I haven’t told anyone.  I assume that Snape let you know?”
“How’s your magic?” I ask Draco.
“As Minister?”  I can’t help but laugh.  “Are you serious, Luna?  No, of course not.  I couldn’t possibly be less qualified.  The position should go to someone who has shown themselves to be impartial in the past.”
“Thanks, Draco.  Should I put down a deposit?  For materials?”
“What does he mean, Hermione?”  I marvel at how even my voice sounds.
“Traitor,” the woman hisses at Harry.  “Your parents would be mortified.  This is how you respect their sacrifice?  Shame on you!”
Harry rose, excused himself, and then stood by the floo, and waited, his face a bleak mask that revealed nothing.
“Was it easy?”
“And have you ever, even for a moment, considered hexing the child that’s in your home now?”
“You’ll what?”  Harry appears around the doorjamb, his eyes dancing, a little smile on his lips.
Suddenly, Draco recalled what he’d said to Lara earlier.  “
Harry managed a little smile.  “Sev, I’m really scared.”
“And nobody can laugh at me.  If you laugh at me, I don’t know what I’ll do.”
“I don’t have a storybook about you, but my friend Hermione said you were the smartest four and-a-half year old she’d ever met.”
A quick floo through to the Burrow later, they’d confirmed that Molly hadn’t seen Harry or Ginny either, and Ron dropped off Rose for some time with her grandparents.
“And it’s rude to go somewhere uninvited.  I know.  I just can’t always help it, not when it’s you.”
“Dad, I’ll just get the exploding snap deck.  Scorp and I can play while you talk,” Cass said.
Draco almost laughed.  Only Luna would refer to being held hostage in his family’s dungeon as ‘staying with him’.  “Are you well, Luna?”
“Yep, ready.”  She touched Harry’s arm.  “It was good to see you, Dad.”
“I don’t have a spouse, you imbecile!  Is that why you left?”
“I just wish I knew what was wrong.  I wish I could help him.”
I’m glad that he doesn’t suggest going to his house.  I’ll make it up with Hermione, likely, if for no other reason than to avoid putting Ron in the centre of all of this, but not today.
“That will have to do, I suppose.”
“That’s amazing!  Is it as fun as it looks?”
His eyes flashed to Miriam, and then he looked at Draco.  He was petting Hank again, stroking, stroking the long, soft ears, looking as though he would give just about anything to be elsewhere.  “Alright,” he said softly, and Draco was filled with admiration.  Harry took a breath, and then said, “I have issues with abandonment.  I try really hard to please people so that they won’t reject me, and when they leave me-” Miriam cleared her throat and frustration flitted across Harry’s expression before he corrected, “if I feel rejected, it validates all of the things I blame myself for.  I carry a lot of guilt for those people who died during the war, and if someone gets angry with me, or when…” he swallowed, “when a relationship ends, I use those circumstances as validation for not deserving love in the first place.”
, Draco thought to himself, and the thought was so jarring that he hastily found himself a corner to retreat into, and breathed slowly until he’d gotten himself under control.
And his daughter, when back in the presence of her other father, simply came to life.  Where she had been polite, intelligent and wryly funny with Draco, she was a delight when with Harry.  She teased him, her hand never left his arm, and she seemed intent on filling him in on everything that had happened since they’d been apart.  Draco knew that envy was one of his faults, but watching their insular little world, utterly content with one another, Draco grappled with the unintentional exclusion.  It wasn’t that Harry or Cass were deliberately ignoring him.  It was just that, reunited, they had no ability to focus on anyone else.
“Of course they aren’t!” Harry’s voice is properly indignant.  “I know.  It’s just…” he runs a hand through his hair, eyes lowered.  “Teddy’s important.”
“I could never be tired of Hogwarts.  It’s brilliant.”  She said the last sentence in her mocking impression of Harry’s accent, and he smiled.
“I don’t have time for breathing.  I have to go.  Where’s my wand?”  Harry's panic was rising, and he felt his breath coming in short gasps.  He had to get to Cass.  He couldn't figure out what sort of spell had happened to make him like this, but he needed to make sure that Cass was okay.  She was likely frightened, and Harry had screwed up.  He'd upset Cass, and he hadn't been there for her and-
“Was that helpful?”
“No!” Harry’s voice sounded alarmed.  “No, no, I want to stay.  It just seemed strange to get to stay with you.  Are we good friends, when I’m a grown up?”
“What are you doing?” Harry wondered, eyeing the treadmill with suspicion.
“I bet.  I’ll answer as many as I can, but there are parts of the story that I haven’t yet been able to tell Cass, and some things that Draco doesn’t know either.  I will be as honest as I can be, and while there are things I won’t explain to you, I won’t lie, either.”  Harry turned to Cass.  “Little duck, would you mind going to your room to read?  I promise you I won’t tell Pansy anything you don’t already know, and since she’s Draco’s friend, it’s a bit delicate.”
“Just means I get you to myself.”  Hermione is making them enormous Gin and Tonics.  Harry slices limes, fires some crisps in a bowl.
“What do you mean?”
“Don’t be stupid, she can stay at her place.”
Weasleys are, it turns out, loud.  They’re boisterous, and good-natured, and inclined towards embarrassing one another in inventive ways.  I watch the goings on with the air of an anthropologist, because there’s just so much to unpack here.  Running through all of it, the shouts, and the laughter, and the hexes, and, on one occasion, the exchanged punches between two of the brothers, there’s such an undercurrent of love and affection, that, in spite of myself, my heart throbs a bit, and I try to parse the strange combination of inclusion and otherness that I’m feeling.
Oh for
“Well, as you know, I, on occasion have been known to have a bit of a stubborn streak.”
I keep my stroke on his cock steady, my other hand surrounds his balls, pulling a little, in a way that I know I like.  He groans, and his breath comes faster.   He pulls away from my kiss, long enough to say, “Get on your hands and knees, Harry.”
“Yes, go, you stupid tit.  Fix this.”  Blaise gives him a half-smile.  Draco doesn’t care.  He’ll work on making everyone else forgive him later.
His relief is enormous.  She’s chosen him, chosen his wishes over what others think is best for him.  “Not Andromeda,” he says hastily.  “I need to be there for Teddy.”
“Hello, sir,” Harry said, extending his hand.
“I don’t get any bad vibes from my first home visit, objectively speaking.  But Scorpius was
“Strong enough to do this,” he says.  At my concerned look, he smiles.  “It’s fine, Harry.  I would have given it all if it meant bringing Scorpius home.”
Harry looked fucking adorable in hockey kit.  His cheeks had pinked in the cool air of the rink, and his eyes were shining with determination.  Draco longed to kiss his chapped lips, but instead looked away, squared his shoulders and said “There, you look a proper hockey player now.”
“Weird how?”
“Can I see?” Harry asked quietly. His heart had started to pound, and he felt a bead of sweat trickle down his spine.  When Cass nodded, he gently probed the joint, and watched her face.  It was impassive, not a single muscle twitched, but Cass’ eyes had always been her tell.  As he maneuvered the ankle, a tiny dilation of the pupil told him where the problem was.  “Just a sprain, little duck.”  A wave of his wand had the problem repaired, and Cass bounced to her feet, all business.
“Yes, but only if you do the same.”
“But secretly,” Draco continued, “I thought that Harry Potter was a hero, and the most powerful wizard alive.  When I found out that I would be attending Hogwarts with him, I knew that he would be my best friend.  As a rich, spoiled little boy, I’d never been told ‘no’ before, and when Harry refused my friendship, I couldn’t understand it.  I wanted his attention desperately, and so I pulled all sorts of stunts to try to gain it.  If he wouldn’t be my friend, he wasn’t going to be permitted to ignore me.”
“This entire Division is under my purview, Unspeakable.  Answer my question.”
“Sometimes Harry is away on a mission for a while.  I have time.”
Harry Potter was feeling particularly satisfied with his life, as he apparated into the shed behind the Granger-Weasley house.  Sure, he’d had
Harry didn’t want to intrude on his friends’ family life, but he, not for the first time, wondered if he should intervene.  Instead, he tightened his hug, and said, “And, you know that you’re my best girl?”
“I’m your family, yes.  But that’s what they are as well.  I think it’s nice that you have so many people to love you.  I was quite selfish, keeping you to myself like that.”
“Can I talk to her?  Will that help?” Harry begged.
“But how could I…” Harry looked at Hermione sharply.  “Wait.  What do you mean I had a hard time at school.  Do you mean bullying?  Do I get bullied?”
“Yes, but Draco, I
It’s time, and Harry and Hermione stand at the back of the marquee, hidden from sight.  Harry extends his elbow and Hermione’s small hand tucks in, warm and firm, and utterly certain.  They step into view, and Hermione stands on her tiptoes to whisper, “I’m pregnant,” into Harry’s ear.  He stumbles for a half-step, before righting himself and continuing to guide her down the aisle.  As he kisses her cheek before placing her hand into Ron’s huge one, he whispers back, “You’re going to be brilliant parents.”
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Draco, grow up.  We aren’t twelve anymore.” Blaise’s eyes are snapping, and his face is hard.  He isn’t going to let Draco off the hook.  “Do you really get off this hard on self-punishment?  That you’d ruin your chances with the bloke you’ve been obsessed over since first year?  And do so in the meanest possible way?”
Harry looked at him dubiously.  “I mean it,” Draco continued.  “You’re just fine.  Right?”
Harry was sitting on a poorly transfigured sofa, his arms and legs bound, and he was glaring at Ginny.  Draco had forgotten how Harry’s eyes looked when he was truly angry.  They were beautiful.  It struck him as strange that he was glaring, however.  If Ginevra had given him the potion, he ought to look like a lovesick cow.  Ginny’s face was red, and her arms were crossed defiantly across her chest.  “Harry, if you’ll just listen,” Ginny begged.
“I dunno.  I thought that you’d be interested.”
“And who is the young lady sitting next to you?”
“Not exactly,” Draco replies.  “Before he left, Harry asked me to charm an amulet for Teddy.  He left before I was able to give it to him, but I thought that he would have liked me to bring it here.  You can check the charm work,” he continued, a little defensively.  “There’s nothing that will hurt Teddy.”
“We’ll discuss your love life later, you know.”
“Harry, you’re my best friend.  You’re so different, now!  Don’t choose him over us.”
Draco leaned under the table.  He found Harry huddled in a tight ball, hands clapped over his head, rocking back and forth.  “Bad Harry, Freak Harry,” he muttered.
“I did what I always did.  I went to Hermione.  She fed me tea, and told me to stop being such an idiot, and asked me to think harder about why I’d stalked him all over the Castle in our sixth year.  She, it turned out, was not at all surprised that I was in love with Draco.  She also told me that Draco had come to find her after the trials were over, and had apologized for being a bit of a prat back in school.  So I went home, and I drank something stronger than tea, and I sent him an owl.”
“Sorry!” Draco heard from a floor above, followed by peals of giggles.
Hermione responds by bursting into tears, which startles everyone, particularly Pansy, who looks at her as though she’s grown a set of antlers.  Ron produces a wrinkled handkerchief, and after Hermione mops up her face, she looks at me appealingly.  “I’m sorry,” she whispers.  “I didn’t mean…It all came out wrong.”
“Oh, Harry.  I need to tell you something really important,” Draco said.  “Your Aunt and Uncle were wrong about a lot of things.  Little boys shouldn’t have to make breakfasts, and they should have a nice comfortable bed to sleep in.  And,” Draco said firmly, “they shouldn’t ever be hit or treated roughly.”  A little indrawn breath confirmed Draco’s suspicion.
Scorpius was so still, Harry wasn’t sure if he was even breathing.  He sat for a very long moment, and then his thumb popped into his mouth for a moment.  He took a long, shuddering breath, removed his thumb, and said, “Jemima got hurt.”
“Do you think that the lack of physical affection was harmful to you?”
“I’ve lost him, Mother.  Lost him forever.”  He didn’t cry, but it was a near thing.  For the first time since he’d been a child of eleven, his mother knelt on the floor beside him, gathered him into her arms, and pressed gentle kisses on his forehead.
be objective about Malfoy’s parenting.  He’d moved on from the war, and gotten rid of his old prejudices.  He
“It’s going to take me a few more years, but eventually, they’ll all be dead or in Azkaban.  I just need to make sure that I stop the cycle of new children being born.  They’re like rats, you know, these Death Eaters, they procreate quickly.  To continue their filthy bloodlines.”
I shrug.  “I wouldn’t know.  Is that the only reason you came to see me?  Or were you here to get a kiss before work?”
“Yeah.  I caught the snitch three times in tryouts.”
“Of course you didn’t, you just learned magic existed five minutes ago.  Come on,” Draco wanted to extend his hand, but his arm wouldn’t obey his mind’s orders.  With the mental shrug of someone who was quite used to uncooperative appendages, Draco said “Come, Harry.”
“No, you didn’t, Harry,” Draco said.  “But never think that I forget who did the walking away.”
“If you like.  Grand-Père isn’t well.  He sometimes gets confused, or upset.  It might even cause him, in his confusion, to say something unkind to you.  If you think that it will upset you to see him, I’ll ask Grand-Mère to make sure he stays away.”
When Draco Malfoy was a child, such was his dislike of waking early in the morning, that the house elves used to squabble about whose turn it was to rouse him.  When any of the elves misbehaved, his Father would grimly punish them by assigning them the duty of waking Master Draco for a week, and it was a far more effective behaviour modification than any other.  However, things change as people grow older, and, despite his continued hatred of mornings, Draco was no longer the spoiled brat he’d once been, and he considered this a significant marker of his personal growth.
“I wish to prevent the rise of the next Dark Lord,” he says.
Draco grins.  “How could I pass that up?”
“Yes,” he answers, and I marvel at his ability to sound smug while all dreamy and stupid-sounding from the potion.
“The Ministry is huge,” I say.  “How can we know where they’re keeping him?”
Harry realizes how much this costs Draco.  They aren’t really that different, the two of them.  Draco clings to his wealth, and his arrogance, to protect him from people seeing, and rejecting, the real person inside.  Harry tries to find a niche, to make himself useful to others so that they don’t notice that there
“Some of us were unable to muster up the hatred required to make it work.  Me.  Zabini.  The Greengrass sisters.  The rest of Slytherin House?  I don’t know how many actually liked doing it, but they gave the appearance that they did.”
And that had been it.  There was to be no discussion.  There was nothing Harry could fix.  It had just been a lovely time with someone Draco had been fond of.
“Don’t be.  It’s no different than the house I stay in a lot of the time.”
“I miss my Daddy,” she sobbed, and found herself a little surprised that this wasn’t an act after all.  “I don’t know why he’d leave me, and I think he’s hurting, and nobody cares.”  She felt a little alarmed that the words were true, and her worry turned into fear.
“Were you?” Draco asked, suddenly sad.  The first time a Wizard held a wand should be completely joyous.  He was disappointed that it wasn’t that way for Harry.
“That’s why you told Minerva? About the Malfoys?”
“Master Harry is not remembering Kreacher’s name?”  See?  He does look hurt.  My first day as a slave owner, and I’m already fucking it up.
Cass’ apology to the Malfoys was heartfelt, and graciously accepted, and it wasn’t long before Draco, holding Scorpius, and Harry, leading Cass, were making their way through the floo to Draco’s.
Mill looks around with a truly apprehensive gaze.  “We can’t talk here, Harry.  Even if my spell is strong, I don’t know if there are listening spells in the Ministry that can override it.  It’s not safe.”
This doesn’t really change their expressions, and I sigh.  Pansy, finally breaks the silence.  “Potter,” she says, in tones of shock, “that is very sensible.”
The probation checks, according to Mill, are a farce.  Those who have been appointed as officers are Muggleborn, or Halfblood, and some have axes to grind.  It had been a vicious cycle, with the children of Death Eaters unable to find legitimate work, and then forced to make ends meet in any way possible.  Pansy had been arrested when she’d been caught soliciting.
“Unspeakable,” Hermione says back, her voice dark.
Ignoring the painful burning sensation that centres in his chest, Draco swallows hard, and mentally wishes the couple good luck.  Harry deserves someone like Dennis.  Someone good, and who was smart enough to be on the right side of the war, and who could be sweetly devoted to him.  Someone that Harry wouldn’t be embarrassed to be seen with.
Malfoy nodded approvingly.  “Scorpius, I can only assume that your accidental magic flared up?”
“V-Violet.”
“Harry-" Draco’s voice was thick with regret.
.  She went off in search of her Papa, finally finding him in his office.
“I’m fine,” she says shortly.  “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Harry chuckled.  “Of course you didn’t.  Can you imagine what it would have been like for me if you had?”
“Yeah, sort of.”
The girl behind the counter grins at me.  “Hi Mister Potter,”
Harry looked as though he was about to throw up.  He sat very still, his face white, and his eyes squeezed tightly closed.  “I can’t look at anyone when I say it,” he warned.
“It is, though,” she argued.  “He told me I was the most important person in the world, but he just left me.  The minute that there was someone else who could take me.”
me or something.”  And then, Draco’s heart stuttered a moment, when three very familiar faces appeared in the kitchen doorway.
Draco cast Tempus.  “We have time for a quick seeker’s match before everyone arrives.  You interested?”
Harry wasn’t sure whether Mrs. Powers meant that Violet could get hurt in the magical world, or away from it.  “She could.  She could get hurt by many things in the world, magical or not.  I imagine that must be one of the most frightening things about being a parent.  I worry about my Godson in exactly that way.”
“Yep.  Hat wanted me for Slytherin.  But, I had just met a little prat who terrified me, so I begged it to send me somewhere else,”  Harry’s eyes were glinting.  Draco wanted to bite him.
“Yes, several.  We’ve been lucky to prosper in the Alley for over a hundred years, and we’ve been lucky to be able to reopen after the recent troubles.  We were closed for three years, as we had to go into hiding during the War.  It was a terrible time for all of the businesses here.”
“Harry,” Draco’s voice is resigned.  “Come here.”
“Are you ready to try it out?”
“He’d be right.”
At this Ron guffawed.  Even Hermione looked amused.  “Molly would be madder about that than she would about the love potion, I think.  She's quite pro-grandchildren,” she said.  “Alright, fine, she’s not using the Burrow.  Unless she’s maybe using your dad’s shed, or the broom shed?”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know why you guys kidnapped me, but it’s not so bad,” he said.
“She was even more annoyed when I asked her about whether or not she’d been dosing me,” Harry said, and Draco snorted.
As Rose and I are sitting at the table, waiting for Ron and Hermione, I say, “This place looks like fun.  Everyone’s happy here.”
“I’m going,” Cass said.  She jumped to her feet and started throwing things into a bag.
“Well, I hope he gets approved for the trial,” Harry said, wondering why this information merited an international portkey.
“You don’t,” Luna agrees.
After Sirius.  “No, but I’m emotionally damaged.  You can’t use me as an accurate gauge.”
“I didn’t realize,” Draco said.  “I knew about everything he’s been through, but I didn’t understand how it impacted him.”
“He’s malnourished.  His bone density is off.”  Draco’s anxiety rose.  He’d known that he’d fuck up the potion.  This was all his fault.  He was going to produce some sort of tiny, maladjusted Harry Potter.  He never should have done this.  He should have sent Harry to St. Mungo’s.
“Come,” Draco said.  “I have a decontamination shower.  You’ll need to get the remnants washed off right away.  I have a spare set of clothing you can have.”
“Harry!”  Hermione sounds super judgemental, and I feel myself getting defensive.
When he finished with the Powers’, it was still early, but since Harry was on-call that night, he decided not to return to the office.  Instead, he popped into the Granger-Weasley back yard and rapped on the door.
“Anyway,” I continue, when neither one seems inclined to argue, “I acknowledge that you’re working to protect me, and I accept your help, but this one is non-negotiable.  Whether that changes in the future, because we reverse this spell, and I find myself inexplicably heterosexual, that’s not true now, and I won’t pretend to be.”
Harry shrugged.  “At the time?  I don’t know what I thought.  I was afraid I’d do something that would make you leave me.  Not incorrectly, I’ll point out.”
“That’s a side effect of some of the potions we’ve been administering.  Sometimes, when someone arrives here experiencing the type of confusion and disorientation that you were displaying, it’s more restorative to allow you to sleep.  You’ve been in a potion-induced rest for the past week, and we’ve been giving you a number of hydrating and nutritional potions to build you back up.  I expect that the headache and grogginess will dissipate once you’ve had a chance to metabolize the last of the potions.”
“Okay,” I agree lazily.  “But only if I don’t have to get up.”
“Are you ready, Cass?  It’s nearly time,” Draco said.  Cass nodded, her face a little nervous.  “You’re going to be extraordinary,” Draco told her, and she smiled brilliantly at him for a moment.
Hermione reached to hug him again, remembering at the last minute, and instead simply blew him a kiss.  “Goodnight Draco.  Do you want me to lock the floo behind me?”
Pansy’s face softened, and she pulled Harry into a hug.  “And I’ll deny saying this, but you’ve always been something kind of special, and you shouldn’t go trying to change who you are.”
“Nobody,” I say, even if that’s not exactly correct.  “I just get the impression that I’m a bit more brawn than brain.  Anyhow, like I was saying, I know you’re going to have to give me a rough idea of how I got here, and what’s happened, but maybe I don’t need every detail.  Like, paint it in broad strokes for now, and you can fill in everything as we go.”
don’t take my son away.”
“Choices are everything,” Scorpius agreed, and Harry suspected that this was something that was repeated often between them.
“Shh, Harry, it’s okay.”  I know that voice, even as I realize that I can’t possibly be hearing it.
Grace blows her bright blue hair out of her eyes and gives him a petulant look.  She’s only a few years younger than Draco, but some days, it feels like he’s an entire generation older than her.  Her eyes roll, hard, and she says, “See what you want, I suppose.”
“I don’t think so,” Draco said.  “The half-life of the Imperius vaccination is about two weeks, and we’re past that now.”
“You’re deluded.  Or you haven’t been paying attention.  I guess it doesn’t really matter anyways.  Harry’s leaving.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope, not a bit.  Draco is complicated, and so he needed a wand that was equally so.  We tried so many, and then finally, he found the right one.  Willow, unicorn hair core, quite swishy.  Cass, when he picked up that wand.  Well, you’ll find out soon enough, when your wand finds you, but it’s a really special feeling.  Like you suddenly belong.  Like you have all this stored up energy that’s finally found its conduit.  Just this…click.  It’s amazing.  And he looked at me like I’d just made all of his dreams come true.”  Harry smiled, remembering.  “That was it.  I was smitten.  Seeing that look on his face was just like that click of feeling your magic.”
“Never,” he said, “Now let’s go home and convince Hermione to go out on a work night.”
“It is brilliant.  Up to you, little duck.”
“I wouldn’t say I liked it.”
“No,” I laugh, “You don’t understand.  I have absolutely no skills, other than being someone that people like to stare at.  I don’t want payment.  Well, I wouldn’t turn down free ice cream, but I’m very lucky that my parents were able to provide me with some financial stability that allows me a bit of freedom.  And you’ve been so welcoming.  I’m happy when I’m here.  I doubt I'll be any good at this, but people will certainly come to look at me, and they'll buy ice cream while they do.  I’d also like for you to hire some more reliable help as well.”
“You’re sure you’re alright?  Grand-Père might say some odd things.”
“Oh…are you sure it’s not too much trouble?”
“Master Harry isn’t even remembering his house elf at all?”  Sweet Merlin, is he about to cry?  Please don’t cry, I beg silently.
There’s a couple more pictures in the album.  A startlingly poignant one of Hermione, perched on a huge rock, beside a lake, a thick book open on her lap.  She looks up and smiles, but goes immediately back to her reading.
“It’s very simple, Draco.  You were, as we’ve discussed many times, a pawn in a war fought by adults.  Your actions, whether well-considered or not, were the best choices that you could make under the circumstances.  I’ll remind you that the Wizengamot itself cleared you of all charges, due to your status as a youth offender, and your attempts to rehabilitate during your probation.  Your continued self-flagellation is unproductive, given that it doesn’t help you manage your symptoms, or find peace with your circumstances.”
, they’re so round.  I start to get a bit nervous, because maybe I’m not interpreting the signals right.  Maybe he wasn’t actually chatting me up?  Fuck.  I don’t fancy getting beaten up for being a creep.  “Sorry,” I say, removing my hands from his arse, and giving him some space.  “Was that too forward?”
“Do you have any objections?”
“Yes, Draco.  I’m real.”
“You’re the one who wanted me to avoid putting Malfoy on probation.”
“That’s…not flattering.”
“I still can’t understand why we’re basing an entire school governmental structure around a bloody piece of clothing, even if it does talk,” Ron offered.  “Dad always said not to trust anything without a brain.”
no person inside.  “Thanks, Draco,” he says, not at all sure that he’ll ever take him up on his offer, but aware that he doesn’t have that prickly wrong feeling he gets when anyone else talks to him about this stuff.  “Maybe I will.”
“Holy fuck, Potter, are you for real?”  I’m not sure how to answer that, but his using my name suggests that we do know each other, so at least I’m right about that.  I’m saved from bluffing my way through an answer, because suddenly someone’s grabbing my shoulder and pulling me away.
“Is it?”
“Yes, yes, of course,” Harry said, his entire focus on getting away.
As they stepped through the floo and into his lab, Harry looked around in dismay.  “What happened?”
Draco nodded, waiting for the ‘but’ that would inevitably follow.
“Okay,” he soothed.  “And you’re right, he’s going to beat this, he’s strong.”  He looked closely at her.  “Do you think we should have another baby?”
“Merlin,” Draco shuddered.  “Glad I never go.”
“It’s Ginny,” Ron spat angrily.
Well, indeed.  Draco felt a wave of misery.  Why was he doing this?  Probing at the ache of his former life like a missing tooth?  This was madness.  “I suppose I should get out of your hair,” he said awkwardly.
“Yes.  Especially considering that you’ve taken exactly ten thousand, two hundred and twenty Galleons in withdrawals from the principal vaults since your birth.”
“It’s wonderful that you’ve been able to develop this potion.  To think, you’ve managed to eliminate one of the Unforgivables!”
“None of that.  I told you, you did well with Luna.  She can be supercilious, and it wasn’t fair of her to ambush you.  I was quite angry when I realized that they’d all been plotting.”
Something in Harry’s face hardened then.  His jaw twitched and his hands clenched.  “Don’t leave on my account, Draco.  I don’t give a fuck what you do.”  He darted around Draco and into the kitchen.  “Why don’t I have a drink?” he growled.  The rest of the kitchen roared its approval, and a beer and a cup of the disgusting orange stuff was placed into his hands.
“I dunno.  I assume it’s about the article, and whoever this is doesn’t seem to like Draco much.  He’ll be glad to see that Draco’s already taken.”
“You’ve never been all that rational when it comes to Draco.  Even in school he sent you around the bend on a weekly basis.”
“Oh, good.”  Harry looked relieved.  His little face was earnest.  “I’ve never had a friend before, Draco.  You’re…you’re amazing.”
“Papa,” he said, his wide grey eyes looking up at Draco, “did you know that Hippogriffs are proud?”
“Fuh,” Harry answered, and Draco immediately regretted his profanity.
One of Harry’s thumbs went into his mouth the minute Hermione let go of his hands.  He didn’t look up, but quietly whispered, “Hullo.”
“Shut up,” he hisses, in a furious whisper.  “This is not the venue to discuss things like this!”
“Oh.  Sorry.”  I kiss him on the end of his nose, and he smiles at me, and it’s so breathtaking that I can’t help but squeeze him tight.
“I’m not married.”
“It’s supposed to be.  Supports your ankles.”  Draco’s voice sounded strained, even to himself, and his erection was making it tough to concentrate on skate-tying.  He put on Harry’s other skate as quickly as he could, then rose, willing his disobedient cock to settle down.  It obeyed about as well as could be expected, given the situation.  “Okay, let’s go.”
“That was nice of them.”
“They’re okay,” Hermione said, a little sadly.  “Molly and Arthur took it awfully hard that Ginny had assaulted Harry like that, and for so many years.  Molly felt that it was her fault, but it was also really hard that her only daughter was taken away from her.  I don’t know if you read about it, it was in the papers of course, but Harry insisted that she not go to Azkaban.  She’s in a secure mental health facility, but it will be years before she’s out.  Ron’s fine.  Says he wants you to meet him for a drink?  Something about you having promised him one?”
We settle back down, in the beautiful sitting room that’s cold, and looks expensive.  I feel so unprepared to face this.  I’ve reassessed my relationship with Hermione at least three times since I woke up without my memories, and I hate the thoughts of doing it again.  Why is this friendship so complicated?
As the door clicks quietly shut behind Potter, Draco squares his shoulders, flips the ‘open’ sign to ‘closed’, and locks the door to his shop.  As he gets blindingly drunk in his flat, he tells himself that this was inevitable.
Harry considers this.  He needs
“Kreacher, it’s okay,” Draco said warningly.  “You’re not to punish yourself.”
Draco considered the information.  Obviously, this wasn’t proof, not nearly enough proof to put Ginny in prison, or even keep her away from Harry.  He had to figure out where she could be brewing.  Love potions were delicate, and had to sit for long periods of time.  She wouldn’t be able to make this on her kitchen stove, not without Harry finding out.
“Oh, god,” Draco said suddenly.  “It’s his birthday party this weekend.  I can’t have his school friends here, can I?”
Draco was saved from having to answer, since they were presented with the site of Lucius Malfoy, walking four albino peacocks on bejewelled leashes.  Cass was standing next to him, wearing a look of wry amusement.  It seemed to be taking every ounce of her composure to keep from laughing.
, he thought.  “Well, if I were sending Scorpius to stay with you, I’d have guidelines I’d want you to observe.”
“Well, your mum’s love protected you, Harry, and when the Dark Wizard tried to kill you, the curse rebounded, and you survived.  That’s how you got the scar.  It isn’t your fault, Harry, you were a baby.”
“Yes!  Today’s the day!”
“Hello,” she says.  “Don’t worry.  Mummy told me that you’ve forgotten everything useful.  I’m here to help.”
“Lovely, thank you.  What are you working on there?”
“Mister Ollivander!” Harry exclaimed.  “Sorry to burst in on you like this.  I was dodging a photographer, and just ducked into the first shop I saw.  But it’s lovely to see you.  How are you feeling?”
“Hello?”
“Can I go play?”
Harry flinched, but looked hard at Draco.  “Really,” he said flatly.  “Nothing more than friendship?”
“Do you think you’ve done something wrong?”
Kingsley’s brow wrinkles, and I’m sure he’s about to feed me a bunch of platitudes about my suitability for the job, but I continue, “Listen, Kingsley, I’m not saying no.  But, as it stands right now, unless I get my memory back, or learn a whole pile of magic in a short time, there’s no way I could take it.  I need a bit of time.  I’ll try to figure out how to regain my memories, okay?  And then we’ll talk.”
“Where is Mrs. Potter?”
“It isn’t being proper, Master Harry,” Kreacher pleaded.
“Draco Malfoy is a marked Death Eater, and the scourge of wizardkind.  He managed to avoid serving any punishment for his actions during the war, but only because of his political influence.”  (This statement is accompanied by another filthy glare in my direction, and I can’t help but smirk back.)  “It took me some time, but eventually I found out that he was trying to interfere in the management of the rest of his scummy friends, I sent him a few discrete warnings.  The little bastard got more secretive after that, no doubt he used the filthy Goblins to cover his tracks.  For a time, I was unable to stop him at all.”
“Incomprehensible, I know,” Draco sighed.
Cass peeked around the door.  “Are you ready, Papa?”  She was practically vibrating with nerves.
The happenings of the night got a little more interesting after that point.  Draco drank, quite a bit, actually.  And Harry got absolutely pissed.  In surreal flashes, Draco witnessed Harry doing body shots off of Longbottom, to Hannah’s intoxicated delight.  He observed a procedure that required a funnel and a handstand.  And through it all, those accusing green eyes met his over the rim of stupid red plastic cups.  Draco prided himself on having developed an impressive alcohol tolerance over his four years playing hockey.  Canadian guys were excellent drinkers, it seemed, and Draco had learned the hard way that a scrawny British boy needed to keep up, or he’d find himself with one less eyebrow the following morning.
Cici looked at him strangely.  “You’re Cass’ bearer, aren’t you?”
The next morning wasn’t much better.  Draco was anxious and plagued by visions of Harry’s tiny body lying broken and lifeless on the floor. No amount of rational argument with himself succeeded in banishing them. He insisted on sanitizing the table three times before he’d allow Harry to eat breakfast, provoking a fit of sulky temper from Kreacher, who muttered under his breath as he banged plates onto the now undoubtedly clean table.
So I finally got a chance to respond to comments, and they were all so lovely, and honestly, I think everyone is about to lose patience with me completely because I just keep DOING THINGS to these poor men.  And I'm sorry.  And I'm especially sorry because we've still a few chapters to go and things are going to continue to not be awesome for a bit.
“Don’t.” Draco knew that his voice sounded shaky, but he needed her to stop, needed to
And suddenly Draco understood why Lara wasn’t in favour of this plan.  Seeing Harry’s eyes full of hero worship, his shy expression fixated on the first person in his life that had been the slightest bit fucking
“I see,” Draco answered, rising to greet the new arrival.  He placed a kiss on her cheek, and whispered in her ear, “You good, ‘Tori?”
“Please don’t start saying that, Hermione will have my bollocks if I’ve taught you to call yourself Potter, and say a fairly unbecoming curse word.”
“How will we find someone who’s blood gets along with mine?”
“I don’t feel awkward.”
“Draco.” Harry’s exhausted, and tempted, and pissed off that he’s
Harry jumped at the contact and for a moment, he looked as though he wanted to throw himself into Draco’s arms, but then his face clouded over, and he said, “Yes, I’m fine.”
He answered the door, and was immediately overwhelmed by hair, and a tight hug around his neck.  Hermione.  All these years later, she smelled the same, and sounded the same, and looked the same.  She burst into tears, and wept into his neck, and Harry blinked hard to avoid doing the same.
of them.  Or maybe they'd just been on their best behaviour at Malfoy Manor.  They were just so
So, it was a shrieking baby, and a sweaty, puce-faced Draco, that met Weasley and Granger when, promptly at seven, they exited the floo.  “Harry!” Granger cried, and crossed the room swiftly.  As she attempted to pick him up, she discovered the sticking charm, and she raised an eyebrow in Draco’s direction.  He was about to explain himself, but she merely said, “That’s brilliant.  I’d never have thought of that,” before cancelling the spell and retrieving Potter.  Potter, the disloyal little shit, burrowed his filthy face into her robes and immediately stopped crying, furthering the insult by opening his mouth like an obedient baby bird when Granger took over.
“I’m afraid so, Harry.  We need to appear above reproach.  There can be no hint of any affiliation with those who have practiced Dark Magic in past.”  Kingsley looks regretful, as though he realizes that he’s disappointed me.  I don’t think he truly has any idea.
“I’m not so sure he will.”
“Thanks for telling me, Dad.”
“Dad.  Don’t fuss.  I’m fine.”
Mr. Powers was standing in the hallway.  “Hello again, Mr. Potter,” he said.  “Please come in.”
Draco feels every day of Harry’s absence like a physical ache in his breastbone. He goes through the motions, opens his shop, spends time with his friends, cleans his flat.  He stays up into the early hours of the morning, berating himself for being so foolish and shortsighted to have gotten things so wrong.  He replays every conversation they had, searching for the single moment when he could have saved Harry.
“It is,” Harry said, and pressed his lips together to keep hysterical laughter from braying out.  Draco looked at Harry, who returned his attention, trying desperately to keep his composure.  Draco’s face was impassive, but his lips finally quirked.  Harry allowed himself a smile, a bit charmed.
“Harry?”  Astoria’s voice interrupted his recollections.  “We’ll be ready to go in a moment.  I’m just going to go make sure that Scorpius is prepared.”
“I…I don’t understand.  I made a scene.  I embarrassed Draco.  I set a terrible example for Cass.  You can’t possibly be condoning my stupidity, especially when I've robbed you, and Draco of ten years with Cass.”
Draco kissed him on the top of his head, and disappeared upstairs.  After a few minutes, though, the words danced and blurred on the parchment, and Harry found himself yawning as well.  Resolving to get up extra-early to review the report he’d promised to discuss with Robards in the morning, he extinguished the lamps with a wave of his hand, and climbed the stairs.
“Hello, my name is Scorpius Amicus Greengrass-Malfoy.  I like being called Scorp.  Or Pius.  Or Pi.”
when he isn’t.  He’s alive, but he isn’t okay.  I feel so helpless.  I feel like he’s battling for his life, and we’re not with him.  We’re always with him.”
“Yes.  It must be first year,” he replies.  The three children are recognizable as Ron, Hermione and myself.  I’m thin and unkempt, as though nobody’s ever taught me how to take care of myself.  But my expression is relaxed, and the three of us laugh and tease one another, dissolving into uproarious laughter every so often.  “I was always so jealous of the three of you,” Draco says.  “Slytherins didn’t really have
“And was starting a brawl at your press conference worth it?” Greg asked with a little smile.
He knew that Hermione had granted him access to their floo, and was still utterly touched by the gesture of faith.  In the end, he spent two hours hovering beside the flames of his own floo, wishing with his entire being that he was strong enough, but ultimately, the fear would take over, and he’d be left huddled in a heap on the floor, trying to catch his breath. In complete disgust with himself, Draco went to bed and tossed and turned all night.
“I can see that.  Do you want to tell me why?”
“He’s quite unharmed, Unspeakable.  And this is not your project.”
“Oh yes, when I woke up this morning, the Nargles told me that I should visit.”
He was.  The moment he returned from the bar with two glasses of ale, he heaved a big sigh.
“‘Dunno,” the man said bemusedly.
“He said he was,” Draco said.  “We’re a bit early.”  He was careful not to promise her, but his stomach was a tight knot.  He knew that Harry would do everything he could to be there, but he’d also learned not to make any assumptions.  Some days were great, and other days were difficult, and this was a bittersweet milestone.  It was entirely possible that the mixed emotions had proven too much for Harry.  But it was important.  To Cass, certainly, but also to Draco.  He wanted Harry here.  But, he reasoned, Harry would be here, or he wouldn’t, and worrying about it wouldn’t change anything.
Nobody had been as calmly accepting of him as Harry.  There was no judgement, no impatience at all in the thin little face.  He’d simply accepted that Draco needed to do these things, and resolved to keep out of his way while he did them.  Draco could imagine how he would have reacted at nine, if someone had kept him waiting for something so stupid, so pointless.  With great resolve, Draco ignored as many of the panicked voices that were clamouring for his attention as possible, and gave Harry the biggest smile he could manage.  “I think I’m finished, for now,” he said, and Harry looked at him hard, as if to make sure he was telling the truth.  “Let’s go have tea.”
“I would,” Harry says.  “I’ll have to call the Ministry to come sort all this faff out before I can move on anyhow.”
She laughs.  “And when has that ever stopped you before?  You’ve always carried the weight of your responsibilities on your shoulders.”
As he disappeared into the floo, Cass turned to look at Draco.  For a moment, Draco saw a glimpse of his own Mother in Cass’ expression as she levelled an icy glare at him.  “That was mean.”
easier for me.  But you hated me once, and, I assume, you don’t hate me anymore.”
“It’s like a castle!  I’ve never felt anywhere so magical!”  Just then, a house elf popped into the floo lounge, and gave an astonished squeak when she saw them.  She popped out just as quickly, leaving Harry watching where she’d been with a bemused head tilt.
“Harry.” Draco’s unfocused eyes make their meandering way to his mouth.  With a lurch, he throws himself at Harry, and they’re kissing, until suddenly Draco pulls away with a look of panic and is violently, disgustingly sick over the side of the bed.  With a sigh, Harry vanishes the sick, and casts a slightly more violent cleansing charm than was strictly required on Draco.  “I’m sorry,” Draco whispers unevenly.
Harry looked across the room.  Draco was impeccably turned out, as usual.  His robes didn’t look uncomfortable.  He was calmly speaking to Astoria and Pansy, and Harry allowed himself a good look.  Draco laughed, and Harry felt his hands tremble.  He was still so beautiful.
in school, though.”
“You’re divorced?”
, his mind corrected) had reached a point where they could politely interact in those strange years after the trials, but then…later, he’d gone out of his way to avoid her.  His mind started to go down the rabbit hole, remembering the past, and the things that Draco resolutely
“Have I?”  This guy clearly doesn’t know I’ve lost my memories, so as long as I play along, I’m sure it will be fine.  What could possibly go wrong?
“Fuh!”
“I think that being given a chance to atone-”
Draco had heard the term ‘his blood ran cold’ before, but had never experienced it before.  At Hermione’s words, though, it was as if the blood running through his veins had turned to ice.  His belly flopped menacingly.  “This is Harry’s house?” he asked quietly.  At Hermione’s nod he felt hot and cold and as though he might sick up on Hermione’s shoes.  “Oh Merlin, I’ll kill Pansy.  I have to get out of here.”
“Thank you,” Malfoy repeated, taking the vial.  “Scorpius, let’s go home.”
“True.  But I’m not a fucking tool to be manipulated.”
“I guess I’ll go see him.  Will you miss me too much?”
Afterwards, when everyone is getting dignified-drunk, the house-elves topping up champagne every time someone’s glass is less than half-full, Draco watches Harry as he and Scorpius examine the hourglasses that track house-points.  Harry is determined that Scorp will be a Ravenclaw, while Draco, surprising everyone, wants the baby to be a Hufflepuff.
“I can’t go back though.  I won’t be old me ever again.”
“Is our past so bad that you can’t consider this?  Can’t consider that we might work?”
“Thank you, Pansy.  For helping me with all of this.  I don’t give a fuck what happens to my reputation, but I appreciate you doing everything you can to protect Cass and Draco.  What do you want me to do?”
“They hate me.  They hate me so much.” His little shoulders sagged as he confessed, and his eyes lost their sparkle for a moment.
“Do you think she’s fixed my blood yet?” Scorpius wondered.
“What?  How?  How is he keeping that a secret?”
“I wasn’t aware that I had a daughter until last week,” Draco said.  His jaw clenched a little.
“Why are you taking care of me?  Why aren’t I with my Aunt and Uncle?”
“I was,” Draco agreed, utterly ashamed with his younger self.
“Auntie Min!  It’s so much bigger than I thought.  It’s beautiful!”  Harry remembered a boat, and a lake, and an enormous castle, lit up in the night sky.  He’d been so agog at every aspect of this new world he’d joined, but the Castle had immediately felt like coming home.  He looked at it now, and his heart swelled with nostalgia.  His first home.  The first place he’d felt, even slightly, like he belonged somewhere.
“Darling.  The rumours are true!” Pansy said delightedly, and stepped through the grate, looking as lovely as a spring day.  Her brown eyes were gleaming, and the green robes she wore were immaculately tailored.  As she crossed the floor to embrace him and kiss his cheeks, Draco remembered a million other such times, Pansy crossing a room to greet him, face alight with the latest gossip.
“Not a bit,” Draco replied.  “Hermione is Muggleborn, and she’s one of the most powerful witches I know.” With a tiny inward grin at how much his opinions had changed, Draco continued, “Anyhow, this Dark Wizard, he wanted to be in charge of everyone, and prevent Muggleborn children from being educated, in fact, he wanted to get rid of Muggles entirely.  As you can imagine, a lot of people thought that this was a bad idea, but he was very powerful.  Some people decided to try and fight him, including your mom and dad.  The Dark Wizard didn’t like that much, and he started hunting down those who opposed him.  When you were just a baby, he came to your house one night, and tried to kill you.”
“Let’s go get a cup of tea.”
“Please share your personal feelings about the former members of Slytherin House who you attended school with?”
.  And Draco was a shit to him.  Whatever happens, Draco can’t let Harry leave thinking that Draco believes the horrible things he’d said.  He turns wide eyes on Blaise.  “Lock the store up?”
“Would their parents even let them come?”
Draco knelt next to Scorpius’ chair, and carded his hand through his baby fine hair.  “Can you explain why?”
“George, I can explain,” Ron said hurriedly.  “It’s Gin.  We found out that she’s been dosing Harry with a love potion.”
He was so immersed in his actions that he didn’t hear the door open, and it wasn’t until Harry’s voice said his name that he realized he wasn’t alone.  Without thinking, his heart leapt, and he smiled at Harry, before realizing that Harry wasn’t his to smile at any longer.  He felt the expression fall from his face, and grabbed a towel from the pile next to the treadmill.  As he scrubbed himself with the rough material, he battled the paradox of Harry being so here, but so distant.  As he managed to get his features cooperating, he banished the towel to the laundry and tried to produce a more normal facial expression.
“Draco,” she said levelly.
“It might be more fun inside, at the party.”
“I’ll be going,” Draco said, but Harry didn’t even look his way.  Narcissa waved her fingertips at him, but continued smiling down at Harry.
wanted to be the one that everyone was afraid of, so he started picking on Dudley.  I knew it was crazy, knew that Dudley would never do the same for me, but I just felt like I had to protect him.  And so, even though I knew I’d get flattened, I got in between them.”
“Will you tell me?”
Harry gripped Cass’ hand tight.  “That’s amazing news,” he murmured.
“Well, there’s our answer,” Hermione said cheerfully.  “We’ll be back to see you all tomorrow, if that’s okay with you Draco?”
“Who is it?”
He looks impressed.  “Well done, Potter.  It seems that losing your memory has made you a bit more Slytherin.”
His attention was diverted by the sounds of rising voices from within the structure.  “Looks like we’ve found them,” he said quietly.  “What’s the plan?”
He’d told Hermione and Ron everything of course, and their reaction was better than he'd feared.  Ron had groused a lot, and the first time they’d all had dinner together had been tense, but all three of them had looked at Harry’s hopeful, happy face, and resolved to try.  And the ice had broken, and they’d become friendly…ish.
For a moment, Draco felt a jolt of panic.  Unable to read the tone from the brief note, Draco was fearful that he’s read the situation all wrong.  Maybe Harry was eager to banish all of Draco’s property from his home.  But then wouldn’t he have just wrapped up the jumper and sent it to the Manor without the note?  Also, Draco wasn't even sure he'd been wearing a jumper that night. Well, regardless, an invitation was an invitation, and, whether it was folly or not, Draco was committed.
It’s too much.  The stress, and loneliness, and grief take hold, and Draco sobs again, and angrily batters at Harry with his fists.  “You stupid, brainless, selfish git!”
“This time last year, I would have told you that I was happy, content.  That I’d gotten the life I deserved after dying to defeat him.  And now, I can’t say the same thing, not with any certainty.  It’s terrifying.”
“Do you,” she replied cooly, before disappearing into her room and closing the door.
“Of course there isn’t,” Andromeda says.  “Harry wouldn’t have trusted just anyone with something for Teddy.”  She scrutinizes him.  “There’s something between you and Harry, isn’t there.”
“Ugh, Ron, we’ve been over this.  It’s impossible to meet someone who wants to get to know me.”
“Harry, wait, oh God, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean-”
“We’ve been arranging for your betrothal to Astoria.”
“You didn’t, though.” Severus peered out of the frame, eyeing him closely.  “And what are we grappling with this evening?  Overwhelming fear that she’ll be hurt and you won’t protect her, or overwhelming guilt over something you think she’s not getting?”
“Do you suppose you’re bi?” Ron asks, and I can tell that this is a concession.  He’d really like to find some tidy little box to set me into, particularly one that allows me to keep dating his sister.
“True.  And we get to taste the new flavours first.  In fact,” she glances at the line behind me, and then turns around to holler “Papa!”
“Yes,” Scorpius said, voice muffled against Malfoy’s jumper.  “Mr. Harry said that I wasn’t in trouble.  But he said that he needed to have a talk with you.”  He looked worriedly at Harry.  “You’ll be nice to my Papa?”
“I think that he very likely would have.”
“That would be brilliant,” Ron said.  “I can’t imagine they’d be all that helpful if I showed up.  It’s no secret that I’m an Auror.”
“I know,” Harry soothes.  “I’m sorry.”
“The psychologist and I developed a theory.  We thought that the trauma of your childhood, and the way your Aunt and Uncle treated you had overdeveloped your super-ego.  Once you got to Hogwarts, it only got worse, because Dumbledore fed that narrative and positioned you as this hero who had to sacrifice himself to save humanity.”
“As rare as Fanconi Anemia?” Draco asked, trying to stay calm.
“So, Dennis?” Harry asks, his tone faux-casual.
“I know,” Draco said, and even he heard the bitterness in his voice.  Hermione seemed to think for a moment before her big brown eyes met his.
Her face further clouded.  “No,” she said bleakly.  “Not once, not in over ten years.”
“Thank you for understanding,” Harry said gratefully, and practically ran to the room Cass had slept in.  He knocked on the door, and after a tense moment, heard Cass huffily invite him in.  She was sitting on the floor, her arms around her knees.  She’d been crying, and her curls were hanging in her face.  She looked so uncertain, and angry, that she immediately reminded him of a much younger Draco.  “Hey there,” he said, sitting next to her.
“What did you know about the Ministry’s strategy for practicers of Dark Magic?”
“You aren’t emotionally damaged, Harry Potter!”  Hermione is indignant, thumps him on the arm.  Harry squeezes her hand reassuringly, and knocks on the door, the carrier bag he is holding banging into his chest.
think she’s right?”  Harry’s never asked this before, and Ron, to his credit, has never volunteered his opinion.
, he thought,
“I think it’s possible.  Ginny has always been head over heels for Harry.  And, she’s the youngest child, the only girl, and she’s terribly indulged.  She isn’t used to being refused.  I hate to think this of my sister-in-law, but Harry…well, he’s Harry, isn’t he?” Her smile grew fonder.  “Harry is my brother, in all but blood.  He’s more my family than anyone, except Ron.”
“I’m sorry?”
“I’m not sure I do.  Please enlighten me.”  Draco kept a veneer of politeness in his tone.  For all that Andromeda had rebuked the Black family name, she still was able to maintain the indirect, biting tones of a Pureblooded woman.  Draco’s instinct was on high alert.  This conversation had very high stakes indeed.
“Well then,” Draco said, “I suppose it’s time you showed me where you lot grew up, Weasleys.”
Draco gasped in a breath, and then another.  He felt a cool trickle of sweat run down his spine.  His hands were trembling.  “No,” he managed to say croakily, “’s’not that.  I just had another…It’s nothing you did, Harry.  We’re safe.  You’re fine.”
“In a nutshell, yes,” she says with a smile.  “But that’s exactly what I mean.  Why did Voldemort gain any followers, if he was as mad as that?”
“This is my daughter, Cass.”
“Better?”
“What’s your budget?”
“And, like the good little Ministry puppet, I believed him,” I said.
“Peacocks!” Lucius called gaily, and Draco and his Mother exchanged a look.  Narcissa hastily summoned an elf, and sent it to discreetly follow and watch them.
Harry starts to feel disappointment.  He knows she’s doing her best, but he starts to feel just as unsafe as he did after the Death Eaters appeared in the Castle, as though his place of safety had been breached.  He’s going to have to leave, he realizes, and his already bruised heart thumps miserably in his chest.
