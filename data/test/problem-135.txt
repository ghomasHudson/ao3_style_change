"Remember my father's hex? I've found a way to make them unreadable unless one of us is touching the book."
Frustration coiling in his mind, Harry followed him across the stone floor and past the filigree stone screen that set off the bed from their lounge area. When they reached it, Draco hesitated, so Harry hoisted himself onto the mattress and worked his way back, tugging on Draco's hand.
"Not on the pitch!" Scowling, Draco thumped back too hard against the inflatable couch, and it bounced him forward again. "There are certain situations in which lesser loyalties have conditional supremacy over greater ones. Explicit competition between houses is one of those."
Draco frowned. "I had thought I might float the potion over with a levitation spell. It should be stable enough to withstand that. I could combine that with a shield spell as soon as I dumped it in."
The wall looked just the same. Of course, it was supposed to. Harry reached a hand out to it. His fingers disappeared into the stone.
Belatedly, Remus summoned the spare chair from the side of the room to the table, and gestured to it. "Sit down, then," he invited.
"Mm. And thus Ron's temper." Uneasy and not wanting to show it, Harry slung an arm over Draco's shoulders, and Draco cuddled down to let him. "Well, that and you." The other occupants of the carriage didn't seem like an adequate reason to hold back from kissing Draco, so he did, pinning him back against the seat when he seemed as if he might be easing away. Only when their vehicle had lurched into motion did he let up.
He was just at the fifth floor landing when he heard Hermione say his name. He paused, and turning, saw Hermione and Ginny getting to their feet in the corridor. Ginny beckoned him, and he left the staircase and walked over.
. You need to choose a place for the 'output' to go, though -- we have an enclosed toilet on the third floor. It overflowed once, a few years ago -- too many Aurors processing detainees from simultaneous raids of a half-dozen sand houses."
For a moment, he twirled the quill in his fingers, gathering his nerve, and then quickly added two more words.
"Not crystal," he said smugly, "but not transfigured. It will be perfectly stable, even under a Reversion hex."
"Of course not," Snape sneered. "You wouldn't mar your image with such tawdry purchases, would you?" He drew himself up at the edge of Harry's vision. "If you could not bring yourself to consult the shopkeeper, Remus Lupin would have been a reasonable alternative. He is tolerant of rule-breaking in general, and particularly indulgent of you."
"It might be subterfuge," he said, shifting uncomfortably on the sofa. "She's avoiding me, but it seems too abrupt to be real."
Harry moved to the side of the steps and leaned back against the vibrating train. It didn't quite obscure the strange, queasy feeling of the Polyjuice starting to wear off. "How do you know I'm not the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?" he challenged.
"Draco?" He started forward, stopping in frustration at Hecksban's upraised hand. The man was right, damn it! He could help better if he held back, but he wanted to have Draco in his arms, saying everything was all right. "Draco! Are you okay?"
Harry nodded. The head hadn't belonged to someone that Shacklebolt knew he knew, he assured himself. From the hair, he had known it hadn't been Draco, or Ron, or Hermione, or Dumbledore, but he'd been worried it might have been Snape. Clearly he would know the teacher of a required subject, though. The slick fabric felt odd under his feet, and the dress shoes he had worn to the ball were designed to offer little traction. They were also soaked through from walking in the snow. He slipped when they reached the time-worn stones of the Entrance Hall, and had to catch himself on the wall. Shacklebolt took his arm.
Dean nodded, still looking uneasy. Seamus glanced back and forth between them several times. "And I'll wait for that summary as well, then," he said lightly, and turned to clap Dean on the shoulder.  "Come on.
Deciding he wasn't running this any more, Harry took the few steps to the seat nearest Ron -- the other end of Neville's sofa -- and sat down.
"Hermione!" Harry exclaimed. He took a step towards her, but stopped when her stance didn't soften. "Where have you been?"
Normally he would have turned with his wand out at the sound of people jogging up to him from behind, but this time he just counted on Draco's worried glance to mean that it was nothing unexpected, and Tonks, looking casually from near the bar, to intervene if it was. Hands closed on his shoulders.
after she evicted him from the ball. However, that was no more her fault than yours. By all indications, Mr. Parkinson was enough of a fool to bring an unnecessary report of failure to an obsessed megalomaniac who tolerates nothing of the sort. "
"You know," he said to Harry, "in a way, it's good that you passed me over last year. This way, I know you really mean it."
"Well, she had started to say I could go, but then was interrupted--" Harry stopped as he remembered that Dumbledore had been part of that interruption.
"It's not permanent, you know. And if you don't want to take the time to get worked up again, some of what you're ordering from the insane twins should do the trick."
"Yes, yes, love you, harder!" Draco babbled, and he pushed fractionally harder, watching until his head had sunk fully into Draco's buttocks.  Again, he pulled back, got slicker, pushed in again. Draco rewarded him with a wailing cry.
Malfoy apparently took Harry's startled cry as encouragement, because he moaned happily and started to suck. Harry was immobilized by the unfamiliar pleasure.
"Objection," he said. "Mr. Potter's reliability is not relevant to the matter at hand. Furthermore, he is a
, in both cases – drink plenty of water, and apply the ointment every eight hours until you are recovered. That’s fully recovered, not ‘okay.’”
think twelve years in Azkaban might teach a man some care, however brazen a Gryffindor," he said. "Even Harry occasionally takes a precaution or two, now."
"Harry?" came a tentative little voice. He turned to see Yolanda standing beside the sofa. "One of the third-years told Evie that Professor Snape is a vampire, and now she wants to go home. Will you come and talk to her?"
Grinning, Harry shook his head.  "Can't. I'm told my liver needs a few weeks to recover. I'm on a potion for it."
When they had gathered, Harry stood on raised grid in front of the showers. "I'd like to cede captaincy of the team to Cornelia," he said bluntly.
"Well, you hardly ate at breakfast!" Hermione said. "Oh." Her eyes widened. "That would be.... Right."
He burst out laughing. Embarrassed, he tried to quiet himself, but his response had done some good, as she visibly relaxed. "Um -- it's a bit of jewelry."
"The memories I will show you were left anonymously," Dumbledore said, as he tipped the contents of a vial into the stone basin. "However, I believe you will understand my concern upon viewing them." He extended a hand. "Please. Enter with me."
On Wednesday after lessons, Harry was up in the dormitory fetching a Transfiguration text when he suddenly realized that he was alone in the room. Quickly, he dug Snape's book out of his trunk and tucked it in his bag, under other books. At the top, he put the Transfiguration text, which was narrow enough to lay across the others, and then jammed his scarf in at one side to keep everything in place. When it all looked safely innocuous, he started downstairs.
"If I release you and we make no complaint," Snape said through clenched teeth, "will you, also, make no complaint?"
Draco shrugged, hiding a growing despair. "Probably just playing on, with the Snitch fair game for any player," he said lightly.
"Well, this was back in the First War, of course; I think he was more accessible then, and sometimes tried charm before bullying."  He focused on her, the other people in the room fading behind a memory of horror. "Remember the boy in the diary."
together," Snape replied, his voice rising over Draco's. "But I like to think I have acquired more polish in the last two
"I wouldn't worry about it," he said, reaching for the bag. "She said she'd contact me, and it looked like a note."
"Well, not like yours does." She took a swallow from her glass, put it down, and lifted the papers. "So. I've finished my research -- the first round, anyway."
Harry wasn't convinced that Severus believed that he wanted it -- but experience led him to believe he could make it true. "I'd enjoy that," he said, rising. He shot Severus a challenging look. "Of course, I'm likely to enjoy it quite a lot, and I don't think rubbing against you until I come in my clothes is going to satisfy me this time."
"Damn. And there'll be no way to visit; you can't leave Hogwarts and I can't go there." Harry propped himself up on one elbow. "Maybe they won't send me back right away?"
She was staring out into the trees when a spray of snow caught her attention, and she whirled in time to see a flash of a boot and an inch of broomstick accelerating through the clear winter air.
Someone told me in a comment that chapter 35 was missing. I checked back and found it still in draft mode. If you'd been thinking the jump from Susara and Harry being hurt fighting with Ron to group potion analysis was a bit
They spent their free time until Cursebreaking discussing possibilities, trying to dream up a project that was difficult enough, but not too time consuming. They both liked the stained glass idea, but Harry wondered if they could do something as elaborate as a display case with stained glass doors. After a tangent on the design of wooden hinges, they speculated about whether this sort of combined spell casting would make other kinds -- perhaps in combat -- easier. Draco said the principle was probably the same, and Harry nodded thoughtfully. That might explain why Professor McGonagall wanted him to learn it.
Draco sighed. "If you say so. Don't be cross, Lightning. I'm trying to think about it as little as possible."
Harry took the vessel and found his middle finger slid nicely into the space between the head of the snake and the next coil. The glass was not quite as thin and fine as the ones Draco had from home, but it was much less thick than those Draco had made before, and shaped like a proper snifter.
"Oh, I'm telling anyone who asks that the letter made clear I wasn't to accept. I don't think anyone saw it but Ron, Hermione, and Neville, though."
It sounded sensible, but she didn't believe it. She set her head to one side, studying him while she thought. "You're a Slytherin."
"This." Harry wrapped his arms around Draco again. Although he had expected comfort, the reality overwhelmed him. He rubbed his face against the side of Draco's neck, feeling his earlier anxiety as it melted away. "Needed this," he whispered.
going to leave you needing a healing spell!  Honestly!" Abruptly, Harry freed Severus from the cuffs. Severus rubbed at his wrists.
"Good evening, darling." She took Draco's hand between her own and offered her cheek for a kiss. "So lovely to see you." Straightening to her full height, she turned to Harry, and offered him her hand. "And Harry Potter -- may I call you Harry?"
"So, do we duplicate this and post it all over school or not?" Ginny asked. Everyone looked at her. "Well? That is the question, isn't it?"
"Now," Hecksban said, once everyone was seated, with noses and eyes clear, and the room smelled faintly of lemon and lavender, rather than a mix of vomit, mouse urine, and blood. "what can we observe about this attempt?"
There was silence. Jason's eyes were wide, and Damian's scrunched shut, but it was Ron that Harry couldn't look past. He was regarding Harry with a hard devotion that Harry hadn't seen in him in a while.
"Good," Harry said, and Draco gave him a little smile as his robe opened entirely, showing a lower garment that was wider and looser than Muggle dress trousers, but not quite out of acceptable range for a man.
"No, of course n--" Draco frowned. "Well, in the last few weeks. Perhaps...." He hesitated again. "Perhaps since -- Well, I'm sure I did once in October. But he's
He stayed near the window -- the one with Draco's tiger -- with a wall to his back. Some guests glared when they saw him, but they all seemed to lose interest after a few seconds. More ignored him, at least overtly.  Nearby, a group of three women, just ahead and to his right, were having an animated conversation about their children's latest activities, but they were not so close that Harry had to listen to the details. He took the time to survey the room for people he knew. From here, he could see Pansy and one of the Greengrass girls at a sideboard, talking to someone who might be Hugh Cecilus, and he thought the little boy strutting back and forth at the far end of the hall might be Ogden. However, there was no sign of Gilbert or Linnet.  Harry wondered if her parents had changed their minds.
Harry woke. He had thrashed free of the covers and was freezing cold. Draco, who knew better than to touch him in such a state, was standing clear of the bed, wrapped in a blanket, saying his name, urgently and steadily, again and again.
Nodding, Harry reached out.  Something strange and pleasant was tickling his nose. Draco turned sideways to step through the arch, pulling him along.
"Oh." That settled, Harry began to move, forcing the first few steps awkwardly. They had practiced earlier in the week, with Draco showing him two new dances, including a completely ridiculous thing called a gavotte, which Harry hoped to avoid. The waltz, however, was relatively easy, as he had done it a few times with Hermione since Draco had shown them the steps, and once he recovered from his surprise, he found himself moving more smoothly. The spacious, empty floor was far easier to turn across than the cluttered space of the Uncommon Room. Draco had moved the sofas there, but left the chairs out to give Harry "practice in maneuvering."
For a brief moment, Harry regretted the words. Sirius's eyes closed, and his face, for just an instant, crumpled. Then it tightened back to scorn.
"Nonsense!" Draco exclaimed. "The board wouldn't allow Madam Pomfrey to work unassisted if she didn't know when to send a student to St. Mungo's."
Harry felt like he'd been knocked over by a Repulsion hex. It took him a moment to get his breath. "You can't actually mean that."
"To figure out what won't mess up my transition potions. You can show him the formulas we're using. I think he had potions interactions in his nursery rhymes."
"None of that, mate," he said to Harry. "If I can put up with you kissing Malfoy, who's not just a man, but a git who's gone after me again and again, you can't frown about me and a girl you like."
"Don't worry," Harry soothed, as he eased the wide flare of the butt plug into their bound and prepared prisoner. "You'll like it."
Harry rolled his eyes, and settled on another of the strange seats a few feet away. "Please. I always leave money. Ask Draco if you don't believe me."
"I spent the last month making my own decisions about my life," he protested, "and making them work. I'm learning how--"
"Ah." She nodded. "All right. Rather harmless, really." She hesitated. "Mirrors aren't expensive for Muggles, are they?"
"That happened," Harry interrupted. "The vision part. But I talked to him in the mirror and knew it wasn't true."
. Where did--" She broke off, her pale face contorting with pain. Harry suspected she had been going to ask about the gold. The contempt he felt was almost calming.
loudly this morning. I'd thought he was just putting me on the spot, but he was probably just seeing if I'd wince. Afterwards, he was okay."
Everyone stayed, but to Harry's disappointment, interactions among the group were strained. He brought up fixing the light strip, which had everyone talking together for a while, but as the discussion became more advanced, it eventually fell to Blaise and Padma. Seamus and Parvati started talking about the upcoming Hogsmeade weekend, and Draco and Millicent about their match versus Hufflepuff later in the month, and Harry tried awkwardly to maintain a voice in at least the latter two conversations.
"Wet dress shoes," Harry said hastily, shrugging him off. "I left my boots at Malfoy Manor. May I cast a drying charm now?"
Hermione followed Harry down the corridor. Two turns away from the official mixed-house room, she glanced back, frowning thoughtfully. "You said we're meeting Draco?"
"Get out." When Harry had his hand on the door, Snape added, "And be glad I find you preferable to the other cretins he might consider a dalliance with."
"No." He bit his lip. "I think we're getting close, though. This is at least the Forest of Dean, and we're friends, right?"
"The craft of your house," Harry replied baldly. "All that I can win over." He grinned. "And your willful ignorance when I sneak into Slytherin to shag Draco, of course."
On Wednesday, Harry returned to the mixed-house social space with a sense of duty. He was sure it would be about the same as two days ago. His consolation would be researching whom to invite to the real one.  Again, other invested parties were there: Seamus was sitting with Parvati and Padma, and the young Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw brothers were playing Exploding Snap. A Slytherin boy that had to be a sixth-year was studying with a younger Hufflepuff girl. Harry thought they might be related, but it was hard to tell. She definitely looked too young to be his girlfriend.
"I sometimes wonder if that was why Peter betrayed us," Sirius interrupted. "Was that the point where he just couldn't live with the risk? We hadn't given up, though. Other people could have defeated him -- other people can still, you just have a better chance."
Despite being in class, Harry put an arm around Draco and pulled him closer. "You're safe here," he said.
That settled, Harry took a bite of his sausage and belatedly realized that he was starving. Dumbledore let him eat for a few minutes before raising the next issue. Harry was buttering toast when the headmaster next spoke.
With some trepidation, Harry picked up the book indicated. It was quite slim, but the leather binding worn and sticky to the touch. Snape paused with his scarf ready to cross his face.
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat. Harry thought she was trying not to smile. "Severus? You were telling us about the chase?"
"Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot," he said, bowing politely, "I do not deny that I was present at this gathering of supporters of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, nor that I followed those of his servants who pursued my only son and heir. However, my presence was not willing, and I followed Draco only to protect him."
With the most ridiculously girly laugh Harry had ever heard -- not, under the circumstances, that that was surprising -- Malfoy squirmed around and sat to lift one long, white leg and lay the calf across Eugene's black robes. Eugene trailed a hand up it, ink-stained fingers ghosting over the pale curves of the exposed calf.
"Mill!" He dove towards her, though he couldn't have said what he intended to do -- steady her, maybe?"
"Well, that's why they might believe he'd follow Voldemort," Harry said. "Not the act of-- Oh! I don't think I told any of you -- Sirius told me he actually had spent a little while pretending he might be inclined to change sides; enough to get himself a personal audience with Voldemort."
She had. Harry slunk down the stairs, but then, noticing his manner, straightened. It was just McGonagall, right? And she wanted him to look good, really. It wasn't like he was being called by the defense. His dress robes swung around his legs, first one way, then the other, as he crossed the floor to the witness chairs.
"Well it's a bit of a waste, isn't it, just assuming they're all enemies? I'm still cautious." Harry bit his lip for a moment, thinking, and then looked up. "I'm going to need them. Gryffindor courage is all well and good, but it won't be enough."
"What else is there?" Millicent asked, wandering over to look at the beer. To Harry's satisfaction, she chose the brown ale. Draco ignored that and smiled at Ginny as he handed her a glass.
"Frieda left them with me," Draco answered. For him, Harry felt the statement blunt.  "Protecting them is my duty."
"Better than that," she said. "I made a copy of my notes." She handed him the sheaf of papers she had been holding, and Harry took it without thinking. It wasn't a portkey, apparently, and his hand didn't shrivel up when he touched the parchment, so he shrunk the lot and tucked them in his pocket.
Draco studied him. "I ... I don't mean to sound fussy," he apologized, "But I do want to know -- how much did you drink this summer?"
Harry shrugged. "They don't like magic -- or anything else that's not 'normal' for their life. I think Aunt Petunia really hated my mum." He looked curiously at Sammy. "What happened when they found out? When you got your Hogwarts letter, I mean?"
Ron considered that. His shoulders came down. "All right. I still think you should have told us about the Malfoys'."
Harry looked away. "Look it's--" He wasn't sure what it was. The loss of an option? "I don't like being controlled," he decided. "And what if I need to?"
"Does that tell you it's possible?" Snape asked, and Harry steadied as his professor's voice took that idle tone he used when coaching Slytherins.
The next item was an application for certification as a brewer, nearly a year later. It had been declined due to inadequate facilities, which seemed odd until Harry used a searching spell and found a 1998 injunction barring Malfoy Manor from "habitation or other use" pending the conclusion of a Ministry investigation. He wondered when that had been lifted.  Further searching showed no closing of the matter, although he would really need to go to Property and Revenue to be sure. He did find a March 2000 order exempting the Malfoys from further taxes on the property for the duration of the injunction.
Harry pulled them from his pocket, and Snape nodded approvingly. "Very well. It is best to go before the day warms." He gestured to the door.
Draco looked squarely back at the article. "As those of a certain age may remember," he read dramatically, "Cygnus Black publicly disowned his second daughter in a paid full-page announcement more worthy of a noble marriage, colorfully denouncing her elopement with a Muggleborn classmate. There has been no indication that Narcissa has spoken to her sister since. Certainly we cannot imagine Lucius Malfoy countenancing it, or the notorious eldest sister, the late Bellatrix Black Lestrange, not punishing it.
“Very well,” Dumbledore said. “I will provide one. Would you prefer a mammal, or would two legs provide greater affinity?”
"Of course, by choice!" Harry answered, exasperated. "I wouldn't have made anyone change just to get Ron on the team!"
"Harry. I had not expected to find you here." The headmaster's tone lightened and he moved forward. Cheefi bounded over to greet him. "I must admit that with Draco Malfoy away, I had not expected to find
," Draco said. "For now, I am explaining to Harry that someone else's attacks on me and my mother are in no way his responsibility."
"But you're not upset at him, as far as I can tell." Hermione's eyes narrowed as she thought.  "Though Ginny is. Is that related?"
Harry glared. Draco patted his lips with a napkin and turned slightly in his seat. "You are not here for punishment."
Pleased, Harry squirmed in his chair. "That would bring him round to anything. You're brilliant with your mouth." He stood and walked behind Draco. From there, he ran his lips over Draco's ear and whispered. "He should watch you first -- watch how you submit to me, see how much you like it."
"But...." This was worse than a lapse in memory.  She couldn't explain it at all. She stepped back, too frantically busy with thinking to stand her ground.
In a scramble of motion, Draco lifted his rear end, the side of his face still pressed against the wood, and let go of the table edge long enough to push the garment down to his thighs. He moved his bum in an enticing little waggle while it was still up in the air, and then settled down again.
He rolled his eyes, trying to pretend he wasn't embarrassed. "That I was drunk in a Muggle village, last year."
Draco looked like he was going to argue, but a group of fifth and sixth year Slytherins emerged around the curve of the staircase, and he shifted to a lighter tone. "I need to get my broom. Wait outside, this time?"
Gryffindor helped. Sajid was there, as was a fourth-year girl, Helen Higgleton. They didn't have much in common, but when Harry suggested a game of Parcheesi, Sajid was delighted and Helen intrigued. Harry transfigured a cushion into a board, but didn't get the markings quite right, so he and Sajid drew one out on paper, and then Harry turned it to wood, to make it more stable. They used Helen's Rune tiles for markers.
"Merlin and Morgana."  Draco shuddered, but stepped forward. "I'm so glad I didn't join that madman."
When Parvati and Seamus arrived at the Uncommon Room on Friday, they chatted over collecting plates of food, but then went to sit separately, Parvati with her twin, and Seamus with Millicent and Cornelia. If they hadn't kissed before parting, Harry would have wondered if they had split up. Looking around, he thought that the group was more mixed than it had been.  The new Hufflepuff, a pink-cheeked blond girl named Hannah Abbot, was sitting with Susan, but they were on the long sofa, sandwiched between Luna and Linnet.  Besides, Hannah was new this week, and Susan was the only other Hufflepuff.  Cadwallader had apparently not been interested.
"Has she spoken well of you? Yes. And of her young cousin, besides." She nodded towards Draco. "Andy remarked that as shocking as it was to have her sister appear after decades of silence, she still did not expect her to speak well of the same young man as her daughter -- and that despite his blood status and the inconvenience that he might cause her."
She nodded, mesmerized, as her hand rose to touch his face. After stroking down his jaw, she shivered and twitched away.
, like doxies? They were vicious, he knew, and he wouldn't mind killing one in a fight. Buying parts, though, seemed macabre. Bones, especially, might look like the bones of a child. He shuddered, remembering the apothecary on Knockturn Alley. A place like that might actually try that counterfeit, if they thought the customer couldn't tell the difference.
Hermione went on to read about how the Auror victim had been investigating a string of attacks on Muggles. Harry scanned the Slytherin table for Draco. When he met Draco's eyes, Draco nodded.
The professor's face softened. "A point." Despite his words, he handed Harry a vial. "However, I am here to guard you, and the strongest part of the effect will have dissipated by the time we are done with our discussion. Bottoms up!"
"I transfigured an ink pot." He smirked. "Severus will have quite the mess to clean up if he causes it to revert. It was red ink, and nearly full." Smiling, he fell back on the mattress. "And here we are with most of the afternoon free."
Dobby shook his head. "The red mists would stop Harry Potter." He nodded. "Dobby could move Harry Potter within Hogwarts, but not in or out."
They turned into a corridor with lit torches -- an improvement, despite the thin haze of smoke that rose to a fog at the ceiling.  Fresher air, bone-chillingly cold, cut in through a narrow window. Harry imagined choosing between the two in selecting a corner of a cell. That made him angrier.
For a few minutes, they caught up on eating. Harry had started off thinking about where they would go to enchant the new notebooks, and how they would keep from having them confiscated. Having thought of a place to work, however, he found himself devising other uses for it. "About the Uncommon Room?" he said.
Two curses later, Harry was wondering if he dared suggest they stop for the day when one of the jars on a shelf by Snape's desk began to pulse with a strange, blue light. Snape's robes flicked up several inches as he whipped about to stare at it.
"Don't be like that!" she protested, rolling her eyes. "I'm just curious." She looked quizzically at Harry. "You're not, though. I
"But I know there can be difficulties." Draco hunched down. "From one of Father's books, although I was barely old enough to understand, at the time, and didn't read past that. And if you were to injure me
"Hush, Mr. Potter," Snape said quietly. "I quite agree." He also rose to his feet. "Have you any tenable suggestions, Madam Langston?"
.  And you're not cruel. And last I knew, our camp was well on the other side of the hill with the holly grove."
All the air left Draco's lungs. He had to swallow and breathe before he could speak, schooling his face and voice to ice.
Snape's eyes flashed down him and then to the side. "Draco?"  he asked coolly. Harry tried to move back, and found he was stuck to the mat.
"Well." Draco crossed his arms over his chest as his gaze rose to meet Harry's. "The headmaster was correct that you shouldn't drink while on this potion."
"Of course." Snape settled back in his chair. "Enough of that. Summarize your understanding of the Credulity spell."
"Hermione told me, of course. Let's go outside. It's a pleasant day." Draco led the way to the staircase and down the broad steps. "Schedule all set?"
"One of those," Harry agreed. "And nothing was going on. But I stopped paying attention to anything else until she screamed. I turned to her, and the branches of the dogwood had grabbed her. I turned back to a Disarmament Charm from your father. Draco was already petrified."
"I have, of course," Harry replied, "but the physical side has been mostly yours. Now...." He ran his warmed hand down Draco's legs, first one, than the other. "You were told not to think while being led, yet you still tried to turn into the guest room."
"I wore them to dinner last night, and breakfast this morning!" he protested. He had ended up draping them over his tie, like Draco was doing.
He sighed. "I'm not good at remembering that sort of thing," he admitted. "I think of adults as automatically useless."
"Right. He suggested that I might benefit from learning to, er, 'harness my considerable charisma,' rather than forcing people to do things." Harry shrugged. "I pointed out that it wouldn't have worked on a dragon, but still, he had a point. I let rumors become issues, rather than spending the time to reassure people, because it bothers me when they're reassured for the wrong reasons."
"I have an observation," Susan said. At the professor's nod, she continued. "The spell showed the curse as not too destructive. That was both true and not."
"Not that I've tried ... um..." The tip of Potter's tongue flicked out between his lips. "Er, either...."
The punch looked perfect, and smelled fruity and sweet.  The goblet was pleasantly cold in Harry's hands, and he raised it to his forehead while he frowned at Snape. "What was my project last year?"
That would make Linnet second and Gilbert third. Harry looked at Draco, and they nodded at each other. It would be a good start.
He had been looking for Draco, but Hermione was sitting with him and Blaise. Harry hurried over to them. "Hi," he said. "Room for a fourth?"
"Of course." Harry stretched up on his toes to show off his erection. Draco wasn't looking, so he bumped it into Draco's thigh. "But I want you to be ready."
Uncomfortable with his feelings on the matter, Harry twisted to face Draco, setting his back against the arm of the sofa. "That's sort of true," he said. "It's true if the match is just a match. But if it looks like a real threat has come into it, it's different. For example, you can't use magic in a match, but no one criticized me when I cast a Patronus against what looked like a Dementor--"
targeting! And I'm curious as to whether this is Harry, Gryffindors, or something else. So: I have never been through a year at Hogwarts without being in mortal danger."
Sirius blinked. After a moment, he laughed. "Oh. Got it." He rubbed the back of his head. "That might be more money than blood status? And Narcissa did keep one of the family houses, I think. Maybe in Provence?" He smiled apologetically, and Harry rocked back onto his heels. He wasn't sure if he wanted to let the matter drop.
From Draco's smug little nod, Harry thought he had known perfectly well that Harry had been avoiding Hermione too.
The Troll and Club was a rowdy, dirty pub, with dried vomit on the street in front of it and streaks on the walls. Without it, Harry would not have seen Caligula's Cauldron. The entrance was discreet, the windows darkened, but the stench, when he entered the place, horrific. All apothecaries smelled odd, but this one smelled like dead things, and Harry tried not to think too much about what 'anything' could include. Susara tightened around his arm.
"Contrived," Sophia offered. "Yes, that's it -- contrived. I think either of your examples would be acceptable."
"Now," she said, "we have the vessel."  She levitated a flask over from the sideboard, bringing it to rest beside the bowl. "Next, we need the blood. Mr. Potter, please tell me where on your body you were bled, and by what means."
And we can't feed Voldemort information through Snape anymore, so I'll need him to know that I'm missing, and there's no point in going to Little Whinging."
to get drunk. I couldn't bring myself to get the cheapest thing available, but I also didn't want to drop what could be a week's rent on something I was going to waste a third of."
Planting his feet, Harry looked at Snape. "He's right. This isn't a lesson, and I have other things to do.  What do
Hermione's eyes narrowed. Harry saw her right hand twitch and wondered if she wanted to be taking notes. "Are there set hours, or do people come by whenever they please?"
Harry hesitated. If one of the people walking by worked for Voldemort, or had a parent who did, he didn't want it out that his aunt was unprotected. "Just wanted to talk," he said. "Not here, though."
Her cheeks dimpled as she finally smiled. "I remember." Her gaze dropped as they started down the next flight. "But what about Sunday?"
"Clean up the blood," Harry said, as he hobbled past Draco, "then join me in the shower." He felt a pang of regret as the words trailed behind him -- his lover had looked worse than he felt. Still, it did no one any good to muddle rank, not this close to the moon. He would let Draco sleep late, he decided, and make tea for both of them, and curl up with him by the fire; that diminished his standing not at all. Certainly an alpha should provide for his pack.
Madam Langston had drawn a little knife. Harry could see the ground edge of the blade, where the polish changed. Snape's wand came down between his eyes and the bright metal. "I will do the bloodletting," he said.
"Right." Remus sighed. "As it happens, Professor Dumbledore was talking to a mutual friend this morning, and mentioned that you plan to visit Malfoy Manor. The only way to keep him from rushing off here to stop you himself was to volunteer to do it for him."
you, and everything, Mrs.  Weasley, and I appreciate everything you've done for me, but if you act like I'm
Harry stayed sprawled out on the bed and watched lazily as Draco pulled on a shirt -- which he left unbuttoned -- and began to arrange his hair.
"I ..." Was this normal? Harry wondered. Before he could decide what to say, Draco was opening his trousers and lightly returning the touch. "Draco! God."
"Probably, but all he'll tell me is that I'm too pushy." With a huff, she turned back to him. "Harry. Do you think there's any chance we'll work things out? Ron and I?"
Harry stopped. Draco turned as if he would knock on Snape's door, and Harry was sure Snape would not receive apologies well. He tugged again.
Despite the Calming Potion, Draco looked uncomfortable. "Father demonstrated it for me last spring. On a rabbit, so it wasn't quite as gory with a mouse."
No sooner had the petrified snake fallen than it rose in the air, a frozen squiggle. Harry ducked its tail and watched open-mouthed as it joined back into the chandelier construct with most of the others. His three corroded ones couldn't detangle and shape properly, but Draco cast another two spells, and soon they were back where they belonged. Carefully, Draco levitated the chandelier a little back from its original location, and just as carefully, Harry levitated the crocodile jaw bed a foot back, to where he had wanted it.  They looked at each other.
He only hoped that whatever Malfoy had added didn't explode before he could get someplace private to deal with it -- he didn't want to explain the situation to Hermione.
"Yeah." Harry shouldered his bag. He had wondered how he would feel when someone commented on his new decoration. Smug, apparently.
odd, he realized, and not just because he'd never worn one before. The beads covered less than half the cord. Still, he shrugged. "I like it," he said, and Seamus leaned his chin on his hand, incidentally showing off his own beads.
, he thought, and grinned. "Sure." He dumped the pens from a pencil cup, and transfigured that and a blown glass paperweight into glasses. The seal on the wine was intact. He slit it with his pocketknife and uncorked the bottle with a charm.
It wasn't quite conciliatory, so Draco didn't feel the need to be quite gracious. "You'll stay until they're ready, you realize. All the buttons and buckles need to be moved over."
"Look, I...." Harry wasn't sure how to explain it if his stories had not. "In four worlds, this is the
Harry went up to Gryffindor feeling well satisfied, and, to his surprise, not sore. He had expected walking afterwards to hurt -- instead, something about the motion just felt
Harry took a steadying breath and reached for a word that would satisfy Draco. "It's gorgeous," he said honestly.
"It did have the air of an excuse," Draco agreed mildly. "Still, that is her prerogative. The invitation is extended; in time, she will grow too curious to remain away."
Harry leaned against the cool stone of the window embrasure. Nearby, students hurried up and down the staircases.
As the two gathered crackers and cheese and spoonfuls of preserves, Draco turned to survey the room. "I believe everyone has arrived. Considering the new attendees, should we start with introductions?"
She thought he could handle this, obviously, but he couldn't see why. Even with Veritaserum resistance potions....
Harry raised an eyebrow at him. "Actually, watching you with Black, I was thinking what a good beta you'd make. I never had to bring him in line." He grinned. "Wouldn't you like to have someone beneath you?"
to do that with Draco that I didn't think about the rest of it.  I messed up, and I cost us the match. I'll try my best to make it up in the spring."
Malfoy nodded. "Their presence...." His mouth compressed as he bit the inside of his lip. "It feels rather like the first flush of fancying someone," he confessed, "but translated to an appropriate form for a pet."
Before turning over the paper, Harry looked up at Hermione, who had pressed near him to read along. "Go on," she urged. He flipped the first section over. Page 8 was the back of it.
"As long as that's all they're doing," Harry answered, drawing his wand. With his free hand, he tapped his glasses and then pointed to the door, and she shook her head.
"I see." Dumbledore didn't seem in any hurry to answer. "I had expected a different inquiry. Is that all?"
Severus looked furious. "I cannot leave the country!" he snarled.  "I cannot carry my wand more than ten feet away from my cauldrons! Every beetle eye that I buy is recorded by the Ministry. You may do anything you wish to me -- including, as I have been gleefully told,
Without thought, Harry took the turn to Records, but the empty lift reminded him it was Saturday. He could still go through the MLE Records clerk on duty, whoever that was this weekend, but he needed to attend the Robing ceremony in less than twenty minutes. He briefly considered skipping the whole thing, rather than spending it fuming about Miranda, but Calvert and Finella were getting their robes, as well, and both had worked with him longer than Miranda had, and seemed to look up to him as a mentor.
Harry wasn't about to discuss his summer plans in front of her. In the end, he ended up writing to the twins and requesting that they come to Draco's room at the Leaky Cauldron within the hour.
With a hiss, Snape drew himself up to his full height. It wasn't as intimidating as it had been when Harry was little.
The hilarity faded to soft touches, then kisses. Harry was gaining control until Draco rolled up onto his knees. He stroked his still warm hand down Harry's body, and up along his cock.  It lengthened to follow the touch.
Harry and the Seer both jumped at the incantation, and the cat hissed. Snape was just tucking his wand away. Madam Langston sputtered in indignation.
"Not for the entire visit, of course," Snape said, continuing to walk. Harry was forced to resume moving to not be left out of hearing. "That would be foolish in the extreme. Just for the ball. I am considering the Alertness Elixir, which is approved for short-term Auror use. Primarily, it increases focus, although hearing is also slightly enhanced."
"Sometimes, the woman survives, right? And sometimes, she's too soft to toss her ugly brute of a baby in the river." Millicent shrugged. "And he might be ... well, just human enough for a woman who values strength over beauty."
"No, I'm afraid the fumes might be noticeable. I have another spot for that." Around a curve, the glow faltered. Harry reached forward to tap past the gap, and another section came on. That light circled two-thirds of the way around a wide space.  The low illumination made tumbled rocks seem larger, and turned the collapsed section beyond into a rising wall of spiked shadows. "No, I want this for the Uncommon Room -- for mixed-house social space. I was hoping you might help me clean it."
how you helped us," Harry retorted sharply.  "You helped us kill Voldemort by brewing Draco Wolfsbane,
“You can pass -- for this round only -- if you wish,” Padma offered, but Julian shook his head slightly. He looked to Gilbert, who nodded approvingly.
They took the front stairs for once, bounding down each flight, and whipping around the corners. In the Entrance Hall, they turned off the bottom step and found themselves facing Snape, who was striding towards them. With only a moment's uncertainty, he pivoted back to the dungeon staircase. "Potter, Malfoy -- follow me."
"You can't take him anywhere without me, I'm afraid," she said cheerily. "But I can stay at a discreet distance."
"Crops. Meant for horses, and meant to be mild, but painful if you hit with the shaft." Harry grinned. "Of course, I really whale down with them -- not what one's supposed to do to a horse these days, I'm sure. And a switch, which is more pliant. The flat thing is a paddle, but also leather -- not as rough as wood." His eyes flashed up to meet Snape's. "Would you like a tour of how each feels?"
Harry kept a hand protectively around the stunned mouse in his pocket. He was afraid he would forget about it and crush it if he let go. For the sake of familiarity, he was across a low table from Ron, as in previous attempts. They were back to sitting on cushions on the floor; he thought Draco hadn't wanted to remind any of them of the last scrying. Hermione and Ginny were on the closest couch -- Hermione with parchment and quill out, Ginny with her arms crossed over her chest and her chin down. Draco had claimed a chair, but was out of it now, passing a flask of the scrying liquid to Ron.
"Frustrating, but better than hurting yourself."  Harry swallowed. Miranda might be nineteen in her head, but he couldn't bring himself to mention sex magic. "Anyway, I have a friend in Experimental Charms who says she'll help."
"Oh, it struck both of us as suspicious, believe me. Snape said he was trying to compensate for my greater aggression--"
Draco shrugged. "If they can 'cheat' as well outside of Hogwarts as in it -- that is, if the person can live up to the unreasonable expectations that they have created -- I don't see that it matters."
"How's it cast?" Seymour asked. Harry got to see Draco's hand snap out, Seeker-fast, and cover his mouth.
For his own part, Harry wished he had been sitting with Draco. He knew exactly how Draco would have nudged him at "reckless," and how he would have retaliated at "sly," and how their hands would have joined at the conclusion. He looked over, just as Draco finished saying something to Pansy and looked back. Their eyes met. Harry wished they could whisper to each other.
Everyone Harry could see looked up at that. Millicent appeared from around the corner, striding towards them.
Harry pretended to consider. "That's all true--" Another twitch of motion from Severus, but again, no words. "However, he is also my prisoner, really, so I think I do owe him a measure of comfort in my house, until I allow him to leave."
"Harry, sir?" Harry looked over quickly, and realized he was frowning when the young girl, a third-year that he was fairly sure was a Catherine or Katherine, stepped back in alarm.
"I ... I've always thought of it like that. Like a mask." Millicent's militarily short hair gave her a stubborn look, although her voice was querulous
He shrugged and took some of the cheddar. "No idea.  Raised by Muggles, you know." He grinned at her. "Enlighten me."
The best thing about being one of the top two Hogwarts Quidditch teams wasn't the chance at the Quidditch Cup, but the match after that -- the Contrivance match. In the Contrivance match, each team was allowed one Contrivance of their own construction. It could break any Quidditch rule, and it was well known that even obvious violations of the law were customarily overlooked. The only enforced restriction was that it could not be reasonably expected by the creators to cause death or permanent harm.
"No!" Harry's cry was joined by others. Susan jumped down from the dais. Vines shot out of Hecksban's wand and pulled Draco back into a chair, just as Harry's Disarming charm took his wand.
"No problem." Fred sounded equally unsettled.  His freckles showed darkly in his pale face. "As it turned out. You okay, Malfoy?"
His face was as angular as it had been in sixth year -- when, in retrospect, he probably hadn't been eating much. His hair had not darkened with age, and he had grown it -- not to the length of his father's, but slightly past his shoulders. It was actually probably the same length as Snape's, Harry thought, and as straight, although different in every other way.  Clean, and fine, and bright as sunlight, it shifted with every movement of his head, as if it would be soft to the touch.
"Right," Harry said. "So you'd have to keep the silver afterwards, although you could turn it back into Sickles and spend it, of course. I just can't get it back."
The tree line, of course, blocked any counter to the season's cold, and ice on the fallen leaves crunched beneath their feet. They were only a few paces in when Snape picked up the conversation.
They poured a small amount of Harry's potion in a small glass bowl, with an eyedropper for measuring out drops to test. Draco started by putting a small amount on a convex glass slide and looking at it through a short, wide, brass tube.
Millicent didn't have the flair of someone who was gifted at potions, but she worked more meticulously at this one than Harry had ever seen her work at anything. Conscious that she would be taking what they produced, Harry did the same. The potion was a perfect currant jelly red when they finished it, which agreed with Millicent's notes. With simultaneous sighs, they stepped back from the cauldron, and then laughed at the unplanned harmony.
A significant question, Harry thought. Potter was his father, and that had always been a problem between them. "Harry," he said.
"Not if she'd backed off! And it's not fair! I mean, to Parkin-- to Pansy, and her mum, and the family.  This is what he does to people who try to
Draco flicked his wrist dismissively. "Hardly. I've never had a conversation with a snake, for example."
Millicent got out the fluxweed jar, emptied it into the cup of the scale, cleared the jar with a wind charm, and began to pour the new batch in. "I admit, I'm still wondering about the Muggle girl."
The office had the sort of look Harry had expected, with matching furnishings of a regimented fashion -- flawlessly executed, but not truly attractive, just as his Aunt Petunia's precise flower beds would never be beautiful. He sat in the swiveling padded chair behind the blond wood veneer desk and put his feet up on it. It was a comfortable position and one that allowed him to keep his wand at hand without appearing to. Millicent pulled up the solid chair beside the desk and sat in that, her feet flat on the floor and her elbows on knees. She also was prepared to move, Harry recognized, but in a very different way. However, the first thing she did was to swing a bag from her shoulder and pull out of it a sheaf of notes and a half-sized bottle of wine, which she handed to Harry.
They made a new hole in wall behind the folded bed. This time Susara said Harry might fit, if he got in sideways.
Potter made another attempt to shake the hair back from his eyes. Draco leaned forward and pushed it to the side for him. Potter's eyes were very close, and very green.
Hermione didn't sound pleased. Harry stopped a few steps above the third floor landing and schooled his face into a neutral expression before turning.
it, understand? You have a gorgeous cock." He took it in his mouth and rolled around the tip of it, while with his hands he undid the buckle on the strap around Severus's waist. With just a little nudge, the upper straps tumbled down, giving him access to the butt plug, which he moved in concert with his mouth.
Harry grinned. "When it was clean enough. I thought you might help with the lighting charms, and maybe furniture."
Remus appeared to be searching the man's face for something. Eventually, he nodded. "Let me know if you need anything, Harry," he said amiably. "I'll be in touch." He grinned.  "Might give me a chance to find that crazy dog!"
They found Snape's cauldrons empty but freshly cleaned, and went on to his apartments. When he answered the door, his eyebrows lifted, but only briefly.
"Hang on," Harry interrupted. "I don't think she'll have any objection to it. Why argue it out now?"
The first lesson of Wednesday morning was double Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry got to the classroom early and sat in a back corner, so he could read his letter without anyone else seeing it.
Malfoy brought a finger to experimentally tweak one nipple, but Eugene caught the hand and pushed it over and down. "No, prat. Like this." He curved Malfoy's fingers around the soft mound. "Squeeze. Gently, at first. See how much you like." He laughed slightly. "This part, I know about."
"That might have worked the first time, Malfoy," he said. "I've seen you with him. I can't prove it's you, but I know."
"Seriously," Harry continued, "I want you to have all the information on this before you promise anything. I won't think less of you if you say no, but if you say yes, I expect you to mean it."
He stopped speaking. After a moment, his mouth twitched, but still did not open. He stayed there, leaned over, watching and silent but for the occasional hum of thought.
"Oh, but there you have him to explain for you." Blaise said quickly. "No offense intended. I just didn't have either sort of contact." He turned his head.  "Neville?"
Draco turned, but before they could start to kiss, there was another sharp crack. Draco and Harry twitched apart, and twisted to find Dobby standing between two of the chairs, with a stack of house banners and a ball of ivy cuttings floating in front of him.
"Even more," Blaise added, "why make enemies of them? A great lot of forceful, driven peers? Isn't that asking for trouble?"
Bulstrode dumped the contents of the purse out into her lap, and then ran one of her thick fingers all around the inside of it. That done, she picked up a coin and touched the entire surface of it before placing it back in the purse. In this manner, she checked all twenty coins. Zabini, meanwhile, opened his packet and examined the contents. With a wetted finger, he picked up a few grains of the grey stuff and tasted it. He made a face like he had bitten a lime, but afterwards, he smiled. "Excellent. Thanks."
The warning seemed excessive -- after all, they had both been here before -- until Harry was inside the room and realized that Snape had been marking. Piles of essays were spread over the table in front of the sofa, and the smaller table between the sofa and the chair, some with sealed potion samples beside them. Snape firecalled the kitchen for more tea and took a swallow from his own cup before carrying it with him to the chair. "Please explain," he said.
Ron watched, incredulous, as Draco crossed the room, opened a crate under the shelf, and came back with a beer.
"Of course! Anything assigned in Charms or Defense Against the Dark Arts, supplemental reading -- when she asked -- at my discretion."
Harry shrugged and sauntered down to the first floor, sliding his wand out of sight with deliberate slowness. "Can't see why," he said. "He never listens to me, either. And any way, he's much better company than you and Dudley."
Harry tried to think. It was public; these weren’t his secrets; he couldn’t answer, but was too unfocused to dissemble.
"Nothing reliable. However, there are substances that can provide a slight edge of control -- but they are not effective for long and cause delusional paranoia if taken repeatedly. They will surprise him."
"Excellent," he said, picking up an apple from Ron's bed table, throwing it up in the air, and catching it. "You're getting it."
"No instruction," he commanded. "I'm Head Boy, and I won't have a load of ignorant lower years, with no concept of or respect for the Dark Arts, running around in the state you were in that night."
"Good," Draco answered fiercely, "because that was terrifying. And I was too weak for magic, and this was the softest spot I could drag you to. Bed?"
Harry saw the slight tightening at the edge of Draco's eye at the incomplete account. Perhaps Snape had missed it. He had been cutting his meat, again, this slice exactly parallel to the first.
"Think about it. If I'm in Slytherin, what have you got? Another house member -- powerful, I suppose, but capable of losing points by the hundreds -- and a lot of media attention focused on your house."  Snape still hadn't sat, which made Harry uncomfortable. He got to his feet and began to pace. "But if I'm in Gryffindor,
"Flying," he said firmly. "You need some freedom and some fresh air, and then you'll be able to plan how to make amends."
idea. Since it worked, she's been trying to use it to convince Draco that we must be lovers, but I thought he was smarter than that."
"There," he said, handing the first to George. "Now it looks expensive too." He gave a second to Fred and then poured one for himself.
That sneer turned back to her. "It's not as if I don't know what they're like," he said. "Apparently, if one loses all self-respect young enough, that doesn't matter."
Changing a shiver to a deliberate undulation of his hips, Malfoy worked lace knickers off and down, until had them dangled on one toe. He kicked them to the side, and without being asked, pulled the skirts up further, until the last bit was pushed to a very obvious peak by his released erection. Harry whined.
"It's fear," Harry said, suddenly certain. He remembered how they had talked about this before, under the soothing influence of
"Right," Harry said. "Except she realized that she was mostly seeing me, and said it would take someone who knew me better to sort out the threads that were Voldemort."
Biting his lip, Harry looked down at the string. He should still be able to tell about one, even after as much as he had said already. "Um." He chose the first yellow one. "This ... this was because I got in trouble at home as a child for doing accidental magic."
I adjusted the formula to compensate for his domineering attitude, but nothing about that should have harmed anything the weight of a wolf!
They spent a minute just looking at the room. It was dimly lit by a single high window on the far wall. Harry spotted the bath Moaning Myrtle had mentioned, and the folding bed, which was near the wall to their left. He pointed. "Along that wall, do you think?"
"But the Averys!" Draco ignored that his face was streaked with tears as he raised it to glare at Snape. He rubbed his sleeve across his nose like a child. "There must have been a dozen purebloods they could have hit instead of me, and why aim at me anyway?
Distracted, Harry looked back at the stranger at the staff table. After a quick scan across the others, he decided Hermione was right. This had to be the new Defense professor. He was at least a few years older than they were, but almost certainly still in his twenties. His hair was a sandy brown, and he seemed to be in constant motion, first fidgeting with his fork and then shifting restlessly in his chair. Only infrequently did he pause long enough to take in a bite of food, which might explain how thin he was.
"My birthday's in May too," Luna remarked, beaming at Linnet. "It's such a lovely time of year to plant wish-cones, isn't it?"
“I haven’t decided if he can be trusted yet. Despite the Christmas gathering, he feels ‘mingling’ is unproductive.”
losing Sirius, or something else about that battle. It was only when I heard about that -- later, before getting back -- that I realized how desperate and angry I was that year, how much I wanted--" He was stumbling, but he needed to say enough for Draco to understand that he didn't understand, that they didn't know each other.
Mildly, Snape nodded. "Quite true. Perhaps we could meet bi-weekly? Short sessions might remain unnoticed."
He snorted. "That depends on if they're willing or not, doesn't it?" he asked. "Nothing like panic to tighten up twat."
reluctant might be kept in line in such a manner for some time before being killed. I have the luxury of having successfully deserted only because I have the protection of Dumbledore and of Hogwarts."
"After dinner," Harry said through clenched teeth, "you will bathe. Severus." He expected a pleading look from Draco, but his lover looked more relieved. Harry supposed that made sense. Draco's nose was as sensitive as his own, after all. "And you will bathe
"Oh really!" Draco's lips brushed under the paper chain collar. When Harry whined, he sucked the flesh up against his teeth.
None of it was flat. Harry was still felt awkward going down stairs. He hoped slopes weren’t as bad.
"This hair color makes it hard to see my scar, see?  A glamour can't hide that, but it can camouflage it."
Harry glanced around for other people, but they were alone. That wasn't surprising, as there were fewer than a dozen students in the school for this week, and half the staff had left as well. He still didn't want to mention Millicent; it would be just his luck to have Peeves shoot out of a crack in the wall, cackling lewd insinuations. "Ordering the satyrs' hooves," he said quickly.
The afternoon was beautiful -- fresh and sunny and just warm enough, and the Gryffindor Common Room was almost empty when Harry went up to his dormitory to fetch his invisibility cloak. Rolled up tightly, it made only a small bulge in his frock coat, and it left him a discreet means of retreating if the Maypole excursion was tedious, or worse. He walked down the hill, vaguely near other stragglers, but not
Draco shrugged. "You are welcome to play with him, if you wish," he said. "I certainly find him no threat. What you will
"Is there some reason you're still here?"  Hermione asked tightly, as Millicent looked out at the path.
, Potter, with your complete lack of regard for your safety, are another matter."  Prowling around his desk, Snape advanced on Harry like a stalking wolf. "Perhaps you would even be willing to be on the receiving end of such an activity, one highly conducive to the transfer of numerous diseases, including at least two curse-enhanced viral strains that are uncomfortable, humiliating, and take considerable time to recover from, even with prompt treatment."
His eyes widened, but before he could say anything more, she turned and tripped out through the door. Neville breathed a sigh of relief. Ron nudged Harry.
"Hermione...." Ron began pleadingly. Hermione bit her lip. Harry could see the swell of a tear in the near corner of her eye. He stood and stepped forward.
"Is everyone ready?" Shacklebolt called loudly.  "Aurors, stations. Everyone take hold of the portkey."
He said the last like Lavender at her worst, and Hermione blinked. "I see your point," she said hesitantly. "I'd scold you, but Bulstrode really is .... I mean, most girls our age are
"I think so. I mean, no one would believe I'm American, to begin with, and what's the point of saying you're someone else and then claiming to be famous?" He started trying sentences.
Snape settled back, a slight smirk curving his lips. "Yet you do." At a knock on the door, he flicked his wand at it, and a young woman came in with their soup.
"You didn't know?" Hermione winced. "Oh.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to tell you. It's a nuisance, though, because he isn't on the train, and I had to lead the prefects' meeting by myself."
Harry shrugged. He wasn't going to say he hadn't thought of it. "I can't tell him I might be critical to defeating Voldemort, can I? But Professor Snape seems to know it."
Harry grinned. "Last I saw, they were snogging in an alcove. They probably won't start looking for me until the train's in motion."
Harry wondered if Dumbledore was just checking on what he had told Shacklebolt, or if the Auror had withheld that information. Perhaps the reticence Shacklebolt complained of now went both ways. "We hadn't tried it before. Did Snape tell you anything after the ball?"
Harry laughed. The Imperial Flogger was Hermione's fault. When she had found out she was pregnant, she had apparated in unannounced, eager to share the news with Harry, and had been horrified to find him laying into Draco with a riding crop. She had railed at him for abusing his power, and then when Draco had -- woozily, Harry had to admit -- insisted that he was enjoying it, told him he was obviously punishing himself for what he had done in school. For three days after that, Harry had been unable to contact her, and then she had shown up, unannounced again, with an apology and a box.
Changing back hit Harry like a bludger. All the energy and aggression of the wolf hit him when it should have been fading, and his side burned in long lines from Draco's claws. Already snarling, he turned on his lover, but Draco thrust the horseshoe that was their Portkey at him, and automatically, he grabbed his side of it.
"You could have endangered him. You could have given away strategy for the trial. You didn't know what you were damaging, and you didn't care!"
"Can't. I just said I'd help, and the magic heard me.  You know, this isn't fair. You're far more in control."
"Well, he seems amiable. I mean, except for when he thought Harry had set that snake on him, and Ernie had all the Hufflepuffs convinced Harry was the Heir of Slytherin." There were laughs at that, loudest from the Slytherins.
Unlike the last time, when sex with Draco had driven everything else from his mind, Harry was almost palpably aware of Severus. The man was like a fire, staying in place at one side, but charging everything with heat. Harry looked across Draco's tilted back at him and saw him sitting upright, staring back.  Feeling bold, Harry smiled at him, though he knew Severus would call that insolence. Perhaps it was.
Harry considered that. Though technically a curse, the spell did no long term damage, according to the text and to Snape. If he lifted it before leaving, his subject would not be harmed. Slowly, he nodded, and then looked keenly up. "Why wait?"
"You know, carrying a second wand is only a problem if you do it regularly. It works just fine for an evening." That wasn't actually a lie, he told himself. The statement was true, if irrelevant.
Then the dragon saw Harry, and everything changed. It shot forward, clearly in pursuit, and Harry dropped down towards a few Slytherin players, hoping to obscure his location. It didn't help. Harry zigzagged across the pitch, trying to lose the great beast. It wasn't until Archibald cut him off from the dragon, to no avail, that Harry realized that the Contrivance was tracking
"I was originally thinking I had to choose from the Slytherins here, because I don't know any others well enough, but then I realized that's not true. I admire my Aunt Sorcha, who can break up a fight or send a sobbing drunkard home from m'uncle's pub with a few well chosen words. They say she's got a touch of the Sight, but I think she just listens as she works, and doesn't waste what she hears on gossip."
Despite the lack of an audience, he gave her an ostentatious wink. "Of course! But since I'm here...." He sat against the front of her desk-- "I want every thing we have on Draco Malfoy."
Eugene laughed. "Actually, you wouldn't believe how much more fun this is when it's someone else's body."
After a minute or two of silence -- and that much further towards the Forbidden Forest -- Snape continued, as if there had been no pause. "But this does provide us the opportunity to speak -- outside of the castle, and away from those who might listen."
points, was it? Sometime I hide out for the tricky bits, too. Conclusion paragraphs are the worst. As for me, I'm stuck on this Transfiguration question...."
McGonagall studied him for a minute. The staccato hisses and pops of whispers continued to come from scattered locations around them. This time, Harry enjoyed speculating on what those whispers must be.
"It's my paper," Dean stated, standing with Hermione. For the first time in the encounter, Draco's expression soured. Harry jostled him.
An awkward silence followed. "The blonde, that is," Draco clarified, his voice tight, which helped not at all. Harry finally reached under the table and gripped his thigh. Briefly, Draco brushed his hand, but the muscles of his leg remained tight under Harry's touch.
Draco shot Harry a look as he closed the distance and took Hermione's hand. "It's too long a discussion to have whilst standing on a stone floor. Now come and sit down, and we'll tell you all about it."  As if it was the most natural thing in the world, he drew her hand to the inside of his arm. To Harry's astonishment, she actually let him lead her over to the white sofa as if he were escorting her into a ball.
strange to have her not argue. If he didn't tell her anything, maybe he could pretend everything was normal.
"Kingsley offered to send an Auror escort," Harry declared.  "They should be arriving soon if they haven't already, but I've said that you should have three hours to pack, and may make multiple trips to move your belongings."
Draco's attention shot to him like tacks to a magnet.  Harry crossed his arms over his chest. He hadn't realized that Hermione was still worried about that. "I can't tell you."
"True," Hermione answered tightly, her chin rising. "I cannot make you do your work. I realize that.  However, I also have no obligation to socialize with you when you haven't."
He could feel his bag warming against his leg. Draco had written in the Liber Geminus. Surreptitiously, Harry tapped the spine to keep it quiet, and then quickly folded and sealed his letter.
"Oh, he and I agreed we'd talk later," Harry explained hastily. "And Mill's probably still with Hagrid."
Draco shot Harry a look before returning her smile. "Oh, Harry did help," he said graciously. "Mainly by vetoing things, I must admit...."
"That she's part troll must mean something, I would think," Seamus interjected lightly. Harry recalled the last time that he had thought of that and grinned.
"Come through," he commanded, stepping back. Draco, who had been reaching for the flasks, stepped back also.
Harry yawned, stretched, and pulled out some fresh clothing from his trunk. He started to pull on the jeans, and then, wrinkling his nose, cast a cleaning charm on himself. The shop had a loo, but no bath or shower, and he probably ought to visit the twins' flat soon; cleaning charms could only do so much. On the other hand, he was finally an adult wizard, and could at least cast them unnoticed.
"Hm." Snape looked at them both. "Yes. That combination wouldn't create desire where there was none. Still, I'll have to prepare an antidote before we go back, or you will behave unsuitably." He stepped closer, and his eyes locked on Harry's. "As the party that
"No." The folds of Draco's shirt muffled his voice, but his tone was almost defiant in its certainty. "Please."
in a bit of a hurry. We need to wash -- and other necessaries -- and have about ten minutes before we need to start back to the courtroom. Will you be in town long?"
Dumbledore wasn't even able to testify that he had seen Lucius with a wand. When he had first emerged from the school, several of the Death Eaters had rushed towards him, and Snape had fired off Disarming spells from behind them. Dumbledore had been dueling Nott, and hadn't seen whose hands the wands had flown from.
Ron rolled his eyes. "So, what are we doing, this time?" he asked pointedly. "You said something about a focus-enhancing potion?"
"As it happens, I was on my way upstairs not by chance, but to find Mr. Potter." He looked at Harry. "You may recall suggesting, last term, that I remind Narcissa of the threat Nott poses to her son, in hopes of gaining information."
"We'll give you a few minutes to read it," Padma said tartly, and Harry opened his eyes and looked. Despite the promising headline, he couldn't hold back a sense of dread as he began the article.
Nodding, Harry laid his satchel on the small table, and fumbled it open. He couldn't sweep the robes open and duck under them -- it had to be done with care for the chain, which meant unfastening them all the way, something he scarcely ever did. Draco watched, smirking slightly, as Harry awkwardly fastened buttons. Once they were set, Draco gave him a mocking -- or possible ritualistic -- bow, and led him to a curtained door.
Nodding, Harry resumed, going fractionally lighter. He had been pushing, after all, letting his own agitation affect him. He kept at it until Severus settled into the faster, harder, pace, and then held there. After what felt like several minutes, he paused to catch his breath.
"Ah!" Remus brightened.  "A good choice, if I remember correctly. Most magical bonds leave a residual effect. Skyberry ensures ephemerality. They're quite rare, though."
She looked up. "All right," she said, not as all as if it was. "I suppose he has no reason to tell, as long as Professor Snape won't find out he was in on it. Promise to cover for him there, and you can tell him."
Draco set his lips to hold back a scowl. The minor victory of having brought Snape down to using his first name barely penetrated his humiliation. "I understand. Have you any concrete objections, sir?"
"Did he get away?" Harry asked, his heart in his throat. He hadn't interfered, apparently. Had Sirius survived?
"Hm." Parvati considered. "Perhaps not, if we're playing next week. I don't want to run out of good conditions."
"You don't know what he's like with my mother! Dinners will be torture! I won't be able to talk with her.  I thought we'd have a chance to really
"And you've only done this once," Harry thought aloud. He wasn't sure how flexible Draco was. After two months in Azkaban, probably not as much as he should be. "Okay," he said, backing away to the edge of the bed. Draco reached for him in what looked like panic, and Harry caught his hand and held it. "Come to the edge of the bed," he urged, tugging. "It will be easier if I'm standing, I think."
The silence grew tenser. Before, Harry realized, no one had been talking. Now they also stopped munching crackers and shifting in their chairs. Draco waved dismissively, as if shooing the mood away. "So far," he said, "this group has shown an admirable camaraderie. Harry and I started with people we were certain were charitable, social, and dependable."  His listeners were starting to relax. Blaise rolled his eyes. Millicent tapped his arm with the back of her hand in a mock slap. "And who had a few interests in common," Draco added, smiling.
Hermione tried to take all the clippings, but Parvati restricted her to one, and passed others to Susan, Hannah, Gilbert, Linnet, and -- after Millicent looked away with a scowl -- a rather angry Ron. The last, she pressed upon Harry. He eyed it with morbid curiosity. Rustles and giggles filled the room.
They seemed okay with that, so he took a real bite of the bun, his heart lifting. He could visit Remus -- and, he hoped, Sirius.
Ignoring Draco's inviting touch, Harry drew the papers out of the envelope. The top one showed an elegantly dressed young lady with softly curled blond hair. She lifted a gloved hand to her lips and blew a kiss.
"I'm not in the mood," Draco snapped, but when Harry flinched back, he smiled. "Sorry. I expect I'll have recovered by the end of the meeting. Though I'd want a bath, first."
"True." Snape sneered as he answered. "However, you express it at the most unsuitable times. Did you read the chapters that I assigned?"
"Oh hush!" Harry said crossly. He looked at Yolanda. "I've been spending my time in the mixed-house sitting room, when it's open. To support it, you know."
They were coming up the last curve of the drive, and he still wasn't sure why Draco had wanted him to meet this girl, but Draco wasn't leading the conversation. Instead, he snuggled contentedly into Harry's side. "This isn't enough of a reunion. Let me know when you're done meeting your Head of House tomorrow?"
"Right. But by the time I got there, he'd taken enough of her life to start forming his old body -- the one he had at sixteen, when he wrote the diary."
A little snort from Dumbledore might have been amusement or scorn, but the chaos was flying around them again, and Harry couldn't be sure.
"When Draco escaped, I was, of course, relieved, but then several of those gathered turned to pursue him. I followed through the portkey trace and attacked Giles as he expanded his broom -- he'd got us into this situation, after all -- and he disarmed me, but I was too frantic to be sensible. Whatever his crimes may have been, he wasn't so far gone as to do an old friend real harm, and I followed. I could not do anything less for a child of my blood.
The conference took a little longer than Harry had hoped, and when he reached the Quidditch pitch, Cornelia, Jason, and Lindsey were already in the air. "Oi!" Harry called, waving his arms. "Team meeting! Everyone in the north changing room!"
Malfoy, on the other hand, had started to shake, and was slowly backing up. From the way edges showed around the pink areas of his cheeks, Harry got the impression he'd gone white as a ghost beneath the cosmetics and charms. "He's going to --"
She bit her lip. "I meant it sincerely," she said. She looked hurt, and Harry felt ashamed of his churlishness.
"There is some chance," Draco continued, "that the act of bleeding him in a magical context will make the divination Dark Arts. I haven't tested this, for obvious reasons--"
, possibly with rather solid, plain biscuits, but when Draco imperiously demanded that the house elves send up tea, it arrived with not only crumpets dripping with salted butter, but with meltingly delicate madelines and tiny, sweet strawberries dusted with sugar. Snape confirmed Harry's opinion by glaring at the doily-festooned silver tray with a huff. Ignoring the china teacups, he summoned a mug from the kitchen and poured a little milk in it. Draco rolled his eyes before adding tea for him. Harry wondered if they were always this amusing together.
Thornton looked uncertainly at the bright green fabric. "Sorry if I'm being dense," he said, "but why are
intend to stay like this. However, I could reverse the change; it would just take six weeks -- after the four needed for the potions to work their way out of my system." He gave Ron a withering look. "And sadly, no -- I won't be in your dormitory. I'm going to be Head Boy. Well, one of the Head Boys."
Malfoy stiffened at the offense in his tone, but her voice was very light. "Oh, you know. It's the only thing that would make the Weasel make sense. Not that his face is much, and the hair is atrocious, but he has a nice arse, and you could be into that sort of muscle."
Harry grasped the meaning immediately. He didn't want to come yet? Well, that was all right. He stood, letting his opened trousers fall and parting his school robes to display his erection. "So what about you, Malfoy? You'd look pretty on your knees, with those skirts all spread around you, and your tits showing when you leaned forward...."
"Linnet's family, you mean?" He sighed.  "It's the Malfoy name, I'm sure." He was still facing away.  "It's all
Draco shifted over -- moving away from her, but Harry thought only so that he could turn sideways and face them both, his back against the arm of the sofa. "I've been looking at communications, myself.  I enjoy writing persuasive pieces. Most opportunities are with the Ministry, though, and currently being their agent of persuasion seems at odds with the rest of my life."
They left at dinner time, talking about Quidditch. Harry had forgotten that was strange until they got to the ground floor. Most people were already in the Great Hall, but as he and Millicent came down the last few steps, a gaggle of young Slytherins came tearing up from the dungeons. Among them was the blond first-year girl, who stumbled to a stop as she saw Millicent and Harry. Millicent rolled her eyes.
"But I need to be, don't I?" Draco let go and slapped him lightly on the thighs. "Lie down so I can pull those off." He pressed down to kiss the back of Harry's neck again, while Harry complied. "I need to remain in control as my father's murderers did not."
"Excellent deduction!" Draco exclaimed. "It's Friday. Saturday is mine, although sometimes academics disrupt that."
"It's kind of you to say so," Draco said, not as all as if it was, "but I would have made a disaster out of the first gathering, if you hadn't told me what I was about to do wrong."
that, from here, especially after years apart." He stepped closer, tentatively placing a hand on Draco's back. "I
"No, he hadn't...." Harry trailed off, thinking. Draco had often spoken of Hermione as a rival. "I suppose that makes sense."
Multiple glances around the oval space connected, and were sealed with nods. Hermione was noticing, but Harry nudged Ron and leaned close. "It's your chance to show you can be reasonable," he said softly, hoping the words were too quiet for Hermione to hear.
to come out in the Slytherin Common Room or even the Gryffindor one, no matter how much you may wish to impress."
Hermione looked heavenward, causing Draco to pat her hand sympathetically. "I'm afraid we must simply consider it endearing."
In the end, they couldn't bring themselves to reveal the new entrance to the Chamber to Ron, especially as anyone could use it. Instead, Draco changed the password to the Uncommon Room, and Harry brought Ron up from the Great Hall.
"Yeah, that," Harry muttered. He could feel magic gathering around the touch, making the hairs at the back of his neck stand up into the shift of the paper chain.
The rest of the walk was uneventful, and they met nothing larger than non-magical spiders. Still, Harry felt a thrill of fear when he commanded the great door to open. Draco, apparently similarly nervous, held his wand forward, and lit the torches as soon as there was enough of a crack to point through. Flames flared to life, showing still water and grand stone, but amidst the vast space, a green and orange plastic sofa, shaggy throw cushions, a stone coffee table, and two folded blankets. Scattered rubbish littered the ground beside the sofa and the surface of the table: crumpled parchment, empty bottles and sweet wrappers, and a broken quill or two.
"Why do we need to do all this planning and review obscure laws for charging him with? He -- they were obviously working for Voldemort!  They had the masks on! And your father tried to kill you!"
Julian straightened. “I’ve never thought Muggles might have a few ideas we could build on,” he said, tossing a smile at Hermione. She laughed.
He took a few steps back and raised his wand to the nearest wall, but at a grinding noise from the distant entrance, paused, looking back. "Interactions!"  he choked. "Potter, does anything in your Contrivance interact with Dragons' blood?
"We started that when he was still a spy, and more likely to be around if I was captured, but even now..." Harry shrugged.  Draco must understand that he'd be disarmed before anyone else. "He thinks I should do it with you, as well -- we should get used to casting with each others'."
," Draco answered sardonically, perching on the arm of nearby chair. "He has an inherent need to do everything in the most difficult manner possible."
Harry looked around at the verdant summer garden and felt a glimmer of hope. "So," he asked, smiling uncertainly, "shall we?"
Draco let out an indignant huff that Harry could hear from his place by the door. "Yes, Harry does take charge," he said, "but what
Outside the clearing, they dropped hands to walk single file. The thorns stuck out in wicked points, more like hawthorn than blackberry, not leaving enough space for two. Harry could almost see how the hedges would melt into light before them, falling away to grass (somehow, in his vision, green). He set his jaw and focused on how it was really -- tangled grey canes with long, sharp thorns.
"Are you coming, Potter?" it called in passing.  "Or are you planning on a repast of stray memorandums?"
"I think I like the thought of you thoroughly fucked," he whispered in Draco's ear. "In the better, literal sense, of course."
"Was I supposed to scream?"  he asked, holding it out to Nott. "I'm not afraid of snakes, you know."
The soft voice was close, and familiar. Only two outsiders could get into Harry's house without his explicit consent. Without opening his eyes, he reached to the side and settled his hand in bushy hair. "Mm?"
"Harry!" Draco complained. "Must you bring that up? You're spoiling Now, you know." He came up on one elbow and frowned down at Harry. "Promise me you won't talk about it?"
Shivering, Harry reversed the cautious turn until he was back on his hands and knees. Draco called up more paper strips and made a short chain from one wrist to the other.
to him to show loyalty. He tortures for minor infractions.  Severus has told me of other executions that were kept more private. This is
He turned to include Tonks. "With that, I will leave you to it, my dear. When you are done, simply leave the office, but
Biting his lip slightly, to be sure his mouth was shut, he again told himself that this was for Sirius.
"It would take a while to starve," Malfoy answered, a little more steadily. "He has provisions, further in."
Ron's jaw dropped. "Um," he stammered. His face began to turn red. "I, well, I'd considered that you might-- But since you chose a first year...." He seemed unable to finish.
There were no other changes to the decor yet, but a large bundle of daffodils stood in an ewer of water on the table in front of the blue couch, next to a large hamper. Leaving Draco to his work, Harry investigated. He found a tray of small, sugared rolls, and under that, a bright mound of mandarins, their clear citrus scent rising as they were exposed. To the side, in protected compartments, were whole, bright strawberries, and delicate crystallized violets.
Sirius sat back with a huff, half-mollified. "You shouldn't at all," he said, but less angrily, now.
Millicent looked slightly green. "The things inside shrink down and then come out through my cunt, which will seal behind them. So, yeah -- nasty. And I'll be bedridden for the last day and night."
That done, he decided to return to Gryffindor. Maybe someone else would be there. He was starting to feel like he was the only person left in the entire castle.
"Just ...." Ginny bit her lip. "You don't generally care who likes you, Harry -- at least that I've been able to tell.  And this year, you seemed to want people you wouldn't usually
"Fuck! Harry, please!" Malfoy squirmed, freeing one clothed shoulder from her robes, and Harry laughed and opened the rest with a charm.
The Disarming spell had worked, sending both wand and knife flying, but the second Death Eater hit Draco with a tripping hex, and he went down. Harry retaliated with
"Not exactly." Harry looked around at their housemates. Dean and Seamus were animatedly arguing about the value of Muggle sport, while Parvati rolled her eyes. Neville was trying to look interested in that, but Harry suspected that he had heard Hermione's question. Any mention of Snape tended to get Neville's attention. He nudged Hermione under the table. "I'll tell you later. Where's Ron?"
Harry was reconsidering his assessment, even as Ron flinched back. The red minnows had settled into two spinning circles. A cluster separated from Harry's, leaving the two even in size, and it darted over to Voldemort's, and then back, a trail of pink diffusing along its path. Harry felt dizzy, and had to look away.
"Right, sir. Thank you." Harry jammed the rest of his things in his bag and left the classroom, Draco on his heels.
"Yeah." Leaning back against the bed, Harry crossed his arms over his chest. "But I'm still going to tell you I'd have to know you a whole lot better." He indicated Tonks with a jerk of his head. "She might be okay."
"We need to tell her, though," Draco said. His trembling, rather than easing, was growing worse. "I won't have her thinking that I stood her up."
"Was it your impression that Mr. Malfoy wished his son to join him in service of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?" McGonagall asked.
"Hadn't thought of it that way," she muttered. With a decisive nod, she pointed her wand at her shoes, but then hesitated. "Maybe I should take them off first."
General dissatisfaction blossomed into irritation at the question. Harry scowled. "No, I will not!" he snapped. "Believe you can trust me or don't."
The ballroom was spectacular. Pine garlands, stars of silver and white sparkling in their long needles, added gentle curves to the juncture of wall and ceiling, and tumbled in falls along the sides of each tall window. Thinner garlands kept the pattern more finely at the fronts of tables and backs of chairs. Spikes of holly, laden with scarlet berries, adorned the hearth and the wall sconces, and strings of crystal stars on golden chains hung from the huge chandeliers. It was not at all what Harry had expected. He turned to Draco, only to find him open-mouthed with dismay. Narcissa was gliding across the room towards them, and Draco lurched towards her.
"I take over Slytherin; you take over Gryffindor," Draco repeated, as if this were simple. Harry sat up. It hurt.
"Oh." As their eyes met, Draco looked as pleasantly lost as he had in the hallway. Contrary to Severus's expectations, they did no more than kiss and cuddle, that night, but that activity was both lengthy and sincere.
places. I don't even have custom-tailored dress robes. When I leave school and look for a job, all I've got is my O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s. I'm buggered if I pit
," Harry conceded. He held out his arm so she could see the beads. "Only one, for all of you.  Pick."
He had never had anything like that. Refusing would be suspicious, but his behavior might end up being more suspicious if the drink made him tipsy. He decided he had better drink it, but slowly. "Thank you," he said, as neutrally as possible, and lifted the glass. The ice in it tinkled musically against the sides, and it smelled lovely. He took a cautious sip.
“He agreed to the move though,” Ron said. “We all came up here. “Professor Snape provided a potion for the pain, and then went off to customize an ointment.”
Snape's head moved in a jerky acknowledgement, and Harry lifted his hand and stepped back. "Now, here's what Draco found too light."
When they had all introduced themselves, Hecksban cleared his throat. "All right. Let's go over a few scenarios. There are no right or wrong answers here -- or, well, there are, but you're not expected to know the difference yet. I just want to get an idea for your styles."
If the morning session of the trial was unsettling, the afternoon one was outright disturbing. Avery did as Harry had expected and claimed that he wasn't present. However, two of his witnesses were not available, so his matter was tabled and the trial moved on to Lucius Malfoy.
"Stop now," he said, just past the door to the guest room. He crouched down and stroked Draco's skin. It was cool, and he was about to cast a warming charm when a different idea stopped him. He cast the charm on his hand instead, and stroked Draco's back and legs, giving him warmth with the touch.  "You're doing well. I expect it's disorienting, isn't it? Not as much sense of how far you've come as if you were walking."
, but the defense barrister did not dispute the point. Instead, he consulted with his clerk, giving the assembly more time to speculate among themselves. Draco reached over and squeezed Harry's hand. "Sorry," he muttered.
That, Harry thought, would be because Cartwright never explained anything he didn't already know. Irritated, he strode into the room.
With a long, rattling breath, she sighed. "I know I said-- I'm sorry about delaying. It's hard to decide."
No one was surprised to see most of the people who picked up prisoner grey striped beads after that. Ginny was frowning at Ron, who hadn’t, and Harry thought she might have protested, but Hermione took a bead, and hoots of surprise took everyone’s attention.
Harry waved at his wardrobe. "Resize something. We can drop by your place if you want to go out to dinner."
with Fred and George. He shrugged. "I'd never thought about blokes. I wanted to think it over a bit, and try snogging first, and make certain that liking each other wasn't just ... just not knowing what to do with
Hermione ducked out of the classroom while Harry was still working on a tricky shield combination, and as usual, she finished her potion before Harry, so he wasn't able to catch her on the way to lunch. She wasn't in the Great Hall when he got there, either. When he arrived at Transfiguration, she was seated alone, so he gave Draco an affectionate nudge and went to sit with her. She looked up, startled, as he slipped into the seat beside her.
" she challenged. "Whatever you may think, your behavior last year was anything but. What was in the papers was anything but."
"And tutors. I mean, there were tutors before as well, but--" Draco looked anxiously at Harry. "It's-- I'd rather not talk about my family, right now."
Draco did not know what had possessed him to spout innuendo at Potter -- except that there was nothing else one
"Susan Bones has a quiet moral bravery," Harry offered. He looked away. "But Ernie's a pompous ass."
"Unless you say something awful," Harry blurted out. "Maybe that's it. Ron's not good at holding his temper when he's angry; you know that. Deep down, maybe not speaking to us is a way not to make it worse." He coughed. "Um -- speaking of talking...?"
When the twins were gone, and Harry had closed the door and cast his own privacy spell, he had to decide what to tell Draco.
Cornelia didn't blush easily, but when she did, it was all high in her cheeks, with the bright red of fever. "Not nearly as interesting, I'm afraid. I was six, and it wasn't so much that I wanted her light-up fairy wand as I wanted her to stop boasting about it. My mum found it, of course, and made me give it back, and worse yet, apologize."
Harry wondered if they were in trouble -- and for what -- but they passed the door to the potion master's office, and went on to his private rooms. He ushered them in and closed the heavy door.
"Oh, but show me on one," she coaxed, and he wasn't sure if she really wanted to see, or thought he couldn't. She stood up, and turned her chair clear of the table. "This one."
remained tantalizingly unspoken. Harry had to collect himself to speak. "And your evidence for this ... theory?"
Draco shrugged and took a moment to chew and swallow. "Linnet is definitely interested in speaking to you about current events, but she's never been a real partisan. Blaise came to me privately to say that he intended to stay neutral as long as possible, but that he no longer discounted your potential in the upcoming conflict."
Harry was scowling at the beetle he had turned into a quail. While definitely a quail, and properly interested in the cracked corn on his desk, it was also -- according to the pictures that Professor McGonagall had shown them -- a
Draco's eyes closed for a moment. "Oh, I promise, Potter," he answered, his voice trembling with feeling. "I'll stay where you tell me to, I'll go meekly to my trial, and I won't do anything illegal in between."
"Um, you choose truth or dare, and then you either get asked an embarrassing question or made to do something."
Draco nodded. "With luck, yes. I would prefer not to go to the fourth method, as that would require you to drink a potion containing Harry's blood, and I can do nothing that would entirely safeguard either of you from unintended consequences."
After the session, Draco headed down to the dungeons to drop off his books before dinner, and Harry to the Uncommon Room to meet Millicent. He spent the walk picturing Esmée Sinclair, and wondering what she hoped to get out of marrying a complete stranger. Money, probably. Or perhaps she, also, felt it her duty to breed for her line. At the mirror, he was taken aback by the harsh lines of his scowl. He took a minute -- and several tries -- to find a more neutral expression before reaching through the glass for the latch.
Draco snorted. "I admit," he said, in almost his old drawl, "that I am intrigued. Might I trouble you, my illustrious host, to tell me of your marvelous adventures, and how they might concern me?"
"He was still a girl when I left." Sighing, Harry stepped forward. "Is that it? I mean, are you okay with the rest of it?"
Snape nodded curtly. "I became," he said, sending an odd look at Lucius Malfoy, "a friend of the family." His gaze turned to Narcissa in the gallery, who looked coolly back. "I was present in the house when Draco was born, and accepted the position of his spellfather, so I do not believe that assertion is at all tenuous."
The door banged open. Professor Dumbledore strode in with a Slytherin -- Julian -- floating before him. The boy was pale, and his leg scraped bloody and swelling, but his mouth set in a firm line.
"It's a conditioner, and you need it, because it's the only way I'll get this detangled. Harry, would you help?"
With an exasperated huff, Malfoy rolled him the rest of the way and straddled him. "You were perfect -- for
"Succinctly put, yes," Draco said. "Of course, Harry could also grant some lucky journalist an interview -- but that puts him in opposition to Minister Ramsley, and I think we should avoid that, at least while he is in school."
"I see." Draco glared. "True friends never go cool on you when they think you're doing the wrong thing? Or is Ron Weasley not really a friend?"
Harry cocked his head, trying to grasp what Draco wasn't saying. It was an unfortunate necessity when dealing with Slytherins. "And how do you think I should approach it?"
They stepped into the reserved area, and Harry closed the grill behind them, latching it to activate the containment shield and adding a sound-muffling charm of his own. Anyone could watch them, of course, but there were advantages to that, where one might have an accident. He took off his coat and hat, removed his Gryffindor cravat, pushed up his sleeve garters, and put on a dragonhide apron.
Draco took a long, audible breath. "She doesn't need to be dull," he said firmly. "She just needs to want something I can give her. Children, even. She could be someone like me. I don't want another lover, Harry. I just want to have children."
"But no one will feel comfortable. I don't mean just temperature," Draco added hastily. "I mean in the sense of feeling protected."
Snape waved the matter aside. "This is Albus Dumbledore we are talking about. I would make no assumptions. He often approaches things with levity."
"You're somewhere in America, then." Draco smiled with vicious triumph. "You wouldn't get that tan any other place that has that."
"Understood." Harry wondered what other sources he had if the twins balked. "Well, I'll do my best." He set his feet down on the floor. "Can you give me more specifics?"
Draco shook his head. "Gryffindors!"  he said, but he reached out to thread his fingers though Harry's. "Let's go, then."
"Plenty of those," Ron said. "Pride is wrapped around and around him. He can't enjoy anything without someone to see.  And his hatred falls over his eyes like a hat."
"Maybe later," Harry said quickly, not really thinking about it. Undoing another button, he kissed the newly exposed skin instead. Malfoy moaned and dropped her head back, so he kissed along the line of that smooth neck.
King's Cross was a simple Tube ride. With agreement from the twins, Harry used a last dose of the Polyjuice potion and a hair from a random Muggle that he had bumped against the day before. He enjoyed the anonymity of traveling as this unknown man, but he wasn't entirely sure that the barrier would admit him, so he had to time the dose carefully. It turned out that there was no problem crossing through, whatever his body looked like.
"Tonks?" Tension melted from the room as Sirius, who had been looking worried, smiled. "I've heard of her."
With one smooth step, Shacklebolt was between Harry and the inquisitor. "The boy is a willing witness, not a suspect. I must insist you honor all facets of that agreement."
In a way, it was a non-sequitur, but Harry, also, was feeling the border of the forest as a return to normal life, and everything in it. "What about her?"
"It was certainly the most exciting part of my holidays," Harry continued. "Strange, and a little bit dangerous --"
"That, and she was probably afraid I'd say how," Harry added. "All of you underestimate my discretion, I think."
"I brought breakfast," she said. "Pork pie, but fresh from the farm market. Was it bad, this month?"
"Hm," she said. "We shall see." To his surprise, rather than requesting Draco or Snape try it, she sat back down in the chair ... and was immediately tipped onto the ground, her lower legs, pale in smooth stockings, kicking free of underskirts tangled under a mound of blue chiffon.
With a faint smile, Shacklebolt set a hand on his shoulder. "Good man, Harry," he said. "You're free to go. However, I suggest you stay within the walls of Hogwarts for now."
"Yes. I have not been able to keep a Defense professor for more than one year since I refused to hire a certain Tom Riddle."
Sighing, she nodded. "Not an Auror then. We'll need to go through obituaries for that time, looking for Ministry employees. If we each take a month, it won't be too bad." She frowned. "Wait. Draco Malfoy applied for a Ministry job?"
"My pleasure, Professor Dumbledore," the woman answered, dropping a slight curtsey. "Lunch is on the table, with tea and pumpkin juice. Shall Miss Tonks and I leave you to your meal?"
to be the point behind him demonstrating the Unforgivables to half the student body." Snape stopped. "There are a few others that I do not believe you have met."  His eyes narrowed. "I will consider whom I might reveal to you."
"I do like it," Harry affirmed, using the tip of his fork to tease a chunk of apricot out of the muddle. "And it's not the
"Fucked?" Harry had to ask. Draco liked being buggered so much that he was seldom interested in switching roles. Half the times they did were because Harry had asked. "You know I love you inside me, baby."
Harry bit his lip to hold back a whimper.  Eugene, in what Harry had come to think of as "Hermione mode," continued. "Don't worry. I found the perfect charm. It will make the area a little more sensitive, but that's probably accurate."
Breakfast had even more people in attendance than the day before, but the additions were all from Hogwarts. Harry saw Professor McGonagall tuck a section of the
Harry twisted, ready to say something – perhaps indiscreet and foolish, but he needed, desperately, for something to be real -- when the stabbing started. His legs were being shredded. They gave way. He fell, tumbling down the stairs, the pain in shoulder, knee, arm, ribs, all fading behind the agonizing cuts to thighs, calves, shins. Someone was screaming. Lots of people – he might be, but that ruckus couldn’t be all him. Draco, Ron – did they need to fight? Hermione, soothing.
"A whip has one -- well, usually one -- long strand, that is always -- well, in my experience -- round. I mean, if you cut across it, you'd have a circle."
"I've been trying to get you alone since Sunday," she complained. "You were gone all afternoon, and I had a group project due Tuesday, and then you had detention -- what did Snape catch you at, anyway?"
"I've never flown toward a dragon," she said, sitting back. "Red with gold flame. Make it flicker, since you're both so hot with Transfiguration."
Harry looked down at the floor. It was dirty, but he supposed that didn't matter. "Only if you do," he said, smirking at Draco's fine clothes. He'd never refastened his robes after they got out of bed, and his white shirt was untucked over wide-legged trousers of fine, light grey wool.
None did. Draco lay close against his side, creating a line of warmth, with his head resting on Harry's shoulder, and his hand on Harry's chest. The unusual sensations had probably combined into the feeling of being restrained, Harry thought contentedly. Of course, he was also naked, so it was no wonder something had seemed wrong to his sleep-fogged mind.  Carefully, he stroked a hand over Draco's bright hair. Draco twitched. For a moment, his body tensed, and then it relaxed again, and he opened his eyes. In the morning sunlight, they were a soft, misty grey.
"I hear you." Remus did not agree, he noticed. "However, it is your godfather's job to worry about these things, and if he won't, I'll do it for him."
"I like them," Harry said. "And Sammy needs a wizard to explain things to him; Rob tries, but he doesn't understand what Sammy doesn't know. Besides, after this year it will all be adults, all the time, won't it?"
"Oh, he talked to Snape -- Headmaster Prince, rather; your father helped him claim his mother's name as part of the adoption, so I could still grow up with a proper Wizarding one. Then he led me into a trap."
Tonks clicked her tongue against her teeth, sounding suddenly far older and stodgier. "Or you could just be paranoid."
"Exactly. So I shout at him for not protecting me like he was supposed to, and he shouts at me for not staying in sight, and I revive Draco, but he looks like he's going to join in. At that point, I decided I'd had enough, and I took my emergency Portkey to someplace quieter."
Sitting up, Draco shook his head. "No. We ought to.  Let's get dressed and collect the rubbish, and then we can sit properly and strategize."
"Mm." Myrtle still looked alarmingly and ineptly coquettish as she leaned her head to the side. "Is it true that the two of you are
"I've gathered from sources available here that the compound will be more stable -- and more useful -- if I incorporate elements from the Dreamer head of a Runespoor. Unfortunately, it's difficult to research further at school. My spellfather has an extensive potions library, but not much on divination, and works on restricted components are not something he keeps many of in his school library." Draco hesitated. "It's also not an easy thing to procure."
Sighs tumbled over one another like the uneven return of a wave over rocks. Harry turned to his quail hen, contained on his desk in a green shield. Originally, he had cast a clear shield, but the bird had panicked when it struck the unseen barrier. One by one, agitated -- or in a few cases, contented -- quail fell silent as they were turned to more taciturn beetles.
"Right." Harry took a sip of the water than someone was holding for him and coughed. Another hand slid his glasses onto his face. With his vision normal, he immediately felt less disoriented. "I didn't realize that was the problem."
He hadn't realized how tense he was until he relaxed at those words.  "Thanks. Just to be clear, I do like some girls, sometimes. I mean, it wouldn't rule someone out."
"Harry, you are not allowed to stay out all night!  I'm not supposed to let you. I should be going to Professor McGonagall right now!"
much.  And we'll take it slowly." His smile took on a wicked edge. "It was a gift, really. You get to have another set of first times ... and
"Well," Blaise said, coming to his feet. "Weasley has finished that snogging session, I see. I think I'll be moving along.  Coming, Millicent?"
"Don't think about it," he advised, and Ron, to his surprise, leaned his head against him, as a young child might.
"Yeah, brilliant," Draco panted. "Fuck me so hard, Potter.  You always want me, don't you? Want to bury your cock in me."
She smiled gratefully. "Right. So he had me work with him on the paths at the edge of the forest, and actually some grounds-keeping work as well -- although we don't call it that -- and we got along."
That was interesting. Harry didn't believe for a second that Snape was bringing this up in front of Narcissa accidentally.
The hot water sluicing over his stressed muscles felt wonderful. The shower had been designed with a rail and cushioning spells, so he didn't have to worry about falling. He had a good life, he thought -- much better than most people in his condition, even now. Draco joined him just as he finished with his hair.
"Mm." Harry teased around Draco's opening, rolling the pad of his thumb around it without pushing in.
They worked quietly, at one point kissing each other behind Severus's head while their fingers continued. Severus sat, at first sullenly, and then just quietly. At last Draco declared the effort successful, rinsed the conditioner out and freshened the water again. Harry warmed it once that was done, and they smiled at each other.
