Draco bit his lip to hide a smile before leaning back in for another kiss. This time it was more open-mouthed, a bit deeper, but it still had a hint of that sloppy incoordination, and it made Harry’s heart stutter.
Harry laughed at the horror on Draco’s face as he tossed the disk gently back toward a lanky teenager with blue and purple-streaked hair.
In the short time it took Draco to whisper his questions, Harry had already removed his trainers.
Then Harry began whispering in Draco’s ear, “I’m going to rim you until your hole is quivering against my tongue, until your thighs are shaking and you can’t help but beg for my cock. Then I’m gonna finger you, deep and slow, twisting them inside you until I’m rubbing against your prostate.” Harry could feel Draco’s cock growing against his thigh as he spoke, “Then when you’re trembling, about to come just from my tongue and fingers… I’m going to tie you up and fuck you.”
Draco cleared his throat awkwardly as he caught a truly delicious glimpse of Potter’s arse in those trousers, before reaching to grab the bag of food that Harry had brought with him. “Of course I am, Potter. Why the bloody hell wouldn’t I be?”
“Yessss,” Harry hissed out, his glasses fogging up as he stroked a hand over Draco’s head, moving the stray hairs out of his eyes and trying to convey the immense love and gratitude that was overflowing in his chest. “Yes, baby. It feels… shit, it feels wonderful.”
This comment only seemed to delight Harry further, and suddenly Draco felt a strong hand on his lower back, guiding him past a hoard of tiny Muggles until they reached some sort of counter.
Fingers flowed this way and that across my vulnerable skin, creating a filigree of featherlight fire looping closer and closer to my nipples. I felt them tighten as his rough fingers skimmed across the pebbled surface. They grew harder and more sensitive with each pass until his thumb and forefinger pressed in tandem, pinching until my toes curled and a whine was coaxed from my lips.
“And what exactly is it that you need, Potter? What would satisfy you?”
He felt triumphant.
“The other men I’ve been with - even the Doms - they’ve all been… too tame.”
Suddenly, Harry glanced up at him, the look in his eyes torn between horny and pissed. “Draco, stop that right now,” he hissed, though Draco detected a quiver in his voice.
And as Draco moaned around him, that was all it took. Harry trembled through his orgasm, cock pulsing out come across Draco’s tongue and down his throat.
But then warm fingertips were stroking over his hip, down through the hair on his thigh, until it paused, caressing the sensitive skin behind his knee. His body shivered involuntarily at the sensation, and his mind was lured toward consciousness like a moth to a flickering flame.
growing in the middle of his GODDAMNED KITCHEN.
Harry grinned when he could feel Draco shake beneath the press of his tongue.
A moment later, Draco was turning, his gaze connecting with Harry’s own. Draco cocked his head to the side, a curiosity fluttering in his eyes. As his gaze dragged from Harry’s flushed cheeks and parted mouth, down to the bulge visible through Harry’s threadbare trousers, a smirk tugged at Draco’s lips and a glint of mischief passed over his features.
But when Harry arrived home one night, everything changed.
and his alone.
Harry busied himself speaking with Charlie about the new hybrid-breed Dragon sanctuary that he was starting, and listening to the Chudley Cannons match on the Wizarding Wireless with Ginny and Dean.
Though there was no mirror in sight, Harry could imagine the image that greeted Draco as he looked down at Harry: swollen lips, spit dripping down his chin and neck, eyes watering with fresh tears tracking across his flushed cheeks, glasses knocked askew from the force of Draco’s face-fucking, and drops of sweat coursing down Harry’s hairline and following the jagged line of his scar.
that you're mouthy, that you're bold, that you are unapologetically Draco. But… I need you to follow my rules to get what you want."
“- Never. Wouldn’t dream of it,” Draco replied sarcastically.
Barely holding in a snort of laughter, Harry shifted forward until his body was slotted up behind Draco’s, one of his strong arms looping around to settle on Draco’s bare torso, stroking lightly over the warm skin and the ripples of muscle than lay beneath.
until it slid over Harry’s hard prick, a single drop igniting a fire inside him.
None of these things had anything at all to do with some pathetic little plant - but Draco attempted to convince himself that they were.
After pulling on a pair of silk sleep trousers and lending Harry the silk shirt, Draco pressed a chaste kiss to Harry’s forehead. He then let out a wide yawn and began heading downstairs on a mission to start a kettle for morning tea.
Draco let out a groan as his orgasm built deep within him, his body just on the edge.
“I love bondage, especially when I’m suspended in the air.” Harry flushed at his own words, feeling his cock growing in his trousers as they spoke.
Letting his eyes trail over Draco’s slim body, Harry noticed a matching leather harness sitting low on his waist and leather garters wrapped around his thighs.
“I’m close,” Harry moaned after few minutes, loosening his hold on Draco’s hair. But Draco simply ignored him. In fact, if anything, Draco seemed to increase his efforts. “Shit. Draco, seriously. I’m really fucking close,” Harry repeated with increasing desperation, the tight coil that had been building in the pit of his stomach now threatening to burst.
Harry knew exactly what I wanted though I did not say a word. He had no doubt seen this fantasy swirling in my thoughts when I dropped it into the Pensive several weeks prior. I left it there, knowing full well that he would see it. At the time, I had been afraid of what Harry might think. But judging by his actions, he clearly did not hate the idea.
Draco turned around in Harry’s arms, eyeing Harry suspiciously, “It’s nearly 4 o’clock in the morning.”
So, before Draco could make any attempt at getting up, Harry fell to his own knees. He shuffled forward until he could circle his arms around Draco, one hand resting on his waist while the other settled on his lower back.
And so, the pair of them got redressed and helped fix one another’s thoroughly disheveled appearances before they headed back out into the hallway.
Harry took another bite of crumpet and wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist. He hummed for a moment before he spoke, “I’m not mad about it.”
Draco looked so - so
Even with every disagreement, every fight, every insult, Harry kept going back to that day at Malfoy Manor during the War. He thought about how Draco had looked him in the eyes, knowing full-well who Harry was, and yet he had refused to give up Harry’s identity.
He could feel it exploding like fireworks in every cell of his body.
- I want it.”
Draco held him steady, his eyes dark as he tipped the can, letting the beer cascade down his chest and over his cock, the liquid rushing over Harry’s lips like a fleeting kiss.
For a while, Harry simply watched the crowds of men, letting his gaze wander freely, eyes moving from pert arses to roaming hands, his stomach twisting with pleasure and a bit of jealousy as he watched a wandering hand slip below the waist of another man’s trousers.
Apparently, Draco wasn’t buying it for one minute.
. You look beautiful, baby.”
Then Draco stood back up, undoing Harry’s shirt with confident fingers and pushing it off his shoulders, the material falling to the floor behind him. Harry raised his arms as Draco pulled off the wifebeater that remained, until Harry was standing in nothing but a pair of fitted black trousers, his chest bare and his nipples beginning to harden.
without the help of magic.”
“Do we actually have to play these?”
Draco hooked his thumbs into his pants, pulling them down and letting them drop at his feet, leaving his cock exposed and perfectly at Harry’s eye level.
This time Harry turned around fully until he was chest to chest with his partner.
A soft rush of warm air tickled the sensitive skin of his inner thighs as Draco let out a sigh. Then the bed was shifting and suddenly the warmth radiated over his cock, balls, and taint.
The last thing Harry remembered before he fell asleep was a pair of icy blue eyes and the soft whisper of
A circular object then flew in the direction of Draco’s head and he screeched, ducking out of the way just as Harry caught the disk gracefully in his hand.
Draco was looking down at him with a triumphant smirk, but then Harry saw it melt into something else, just for a split second - later he would wonder if he had imagined it.
But then Draco was slamming the door shut and striding across the room toward Harry, a look of determination etched into his statuesque features.
” Harry moaned, his fingers curling inside of him on instinct, pressing perfectly against his prostate and sending shockwaves of pleasure coursing through his body.
Draco swallowed uncomfortably around the lump in his throat. Meanwhile, Harry hummed in question and squeezed gently at his side, “Any particular reason you yelled at a plant? Or is it just because it’s a Tuesday?”
For years Harry was tasked with the insurmountable task of making decisions that would impact the entire future of the Wizarding World, his aching body collapsing under the expectations of others. People were depending on him to make decisions that no individual so young should ever have to make. His bones were constantly threatening to break, his mind overrun with the responsibilities he was burdened with from the day he was born.
The sight of Draco on his knees in front of Harry was something out of one of his teenage wet dreams, and Harry couldn’t hardly breathe. Especially not when Draco was pulling his cock out of his pants and wrapping his long-fingered hand around it.
Draco shrugged, though a sly smile was teasing at the corners of his lips, “You were basically knocked out after you came - it was pretty pathetic, really. For someone in his mid twenties, you have the stamina of an old man.”
The sheer power of Draco’s grip made Harry’s vision blur, his cock throbbing in his trousers, begging for more, “I did
“... And you’re… disappointed that it’s not?”
When Harry remained silent, Draco let out a dramatic sigh, “Ok, ok. Something... A few things, probably.”
Draco rolled his eyes, letting out an exaggerated huff and glaring in Harry’s direction as he replied, “The Felix Felicis, you arsehole!”
“Shut. The. Fuck. Up,” Draco grit out.
Harry could feel the orgasm all the way to the tips of his toes, the pleasure coursing through him in waves, emanating from his core and filling him up with an endless kind of warmth.
“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Draco teased before leaning down and capturing Harry’s lips in a heady kiss.
Harry looked - Well, he looked quite gorgeous, actually. Draco had never seen him looking so put together. It was disconcerting (especially because Draco’s heart was suddenly beating unusually fast, and he even found himself feeling self-conscious of
He changed as best as he could in the tiny stall - before stuffing his robes and the rest of his Auror garb into his wallet.
“You are being so good for your Daddy.”
But standing there in his kitchen with Harry in his arms, Draco surrendered to it all. He stopped questioning it and just let himself
The innocence of the kiss and the sweet
He called out Draco’s name, but he appeared not to hear Harry, so he did the only logical thing he could think of: he grabbed hold of the harness around Draco’s waist, pulling him back and catching Draco as he unbalanced, his back falling against Harry’s bare chest.
Despite the apprehension Harry could feel building inside himself, he shook his head, “No, Sir.”
“Alright there, Malfoy?” Harry inquired, an amused look on his face as he unwrapped his scarf, folding it neatly and placing it with his shoes as he toed them off.
Draco nodded without a second thought, and then Harry was taking his hand and leading him swiftly across a black carpet striped with neon brights, while colors and shapes were flashing by him in a whirlwind as they moved.
And with that, Harry stood up, dusting off his trousers and walking back to the front door.
Harry’s mouth was like a heavenly sheath of hot, wet, velvet enveloping his cock. And it was perfect.
Draco shifted his foot a little further, applying a light pressure with his heel until he saw Harry’s eyelids fluttering.
“Now, crawl over here.”
Even as Harry’s body trembled through the aftershocks of his orgasm, he reached for Draco, guiding him up until they could kiss, his tongue tracing the inside of Draco’s mouth - tasting himself.
“Er, not right now, thanks,” Harry replied politely, handing Draco a pair of the shoes and leading him over to a bench.
Harry practically choked, dropping his briefcase in shocked arousal, the contents spilling out onto the floor as the clasp popped open.
, opening the drink and then moving in closer to Harry.
stuff to apologize for?” Draco’s tone was incredulous.
, which required them to do idiotic dance moves to a set of equally idiotic Muggle pop songs.
When Harry came he was unable to hold back a scream, unable to hold back the tears, unable to control the shaking of his body as he rode out the aftershocks.
The crowd cheered around them, but Harry could barely hear it - far too focused in on Draco.
But Harry wasn’t about to let him steal the show. He grabbed onto the harness wrapped around Draco’s hips, using it as leverage to pull himself forward on his knees until he was pressed right up behind Draco, grinding his rapidly swelling cock onto Draco’s arse.
In the back of Harry’s consciousness, he registered wet kisses cleaning up the come from his belly - leaving no evidence of the early-morning activities in his wake.
For a moment, Harry slipped away into the nearest loo, seeking solitude from the attack on his senses, and rethinking the entire trip to the club in the first place. When he glanced in the mirror, he noticed that not only was a flush spreading across his cheeks and down his neck, but he had also shown up to the club in his Auror robes.
Harry wanted to be told exactly what to do and when and where and
Harry’s entire world had narrowed to Draco, Draco,
A pleased smile curled at Draco lips as he mouthed the lyrics to the song, running a hand roughly through Harry’s messy locks, his nails scratching against Harry’s scalp in a way that sent a tingle of pleasure down his spine.
Over the years, Harry had become increasingly self-conscious, worried that each passing hour was aging his body in a way that reflected the thousands of lives he had lived as an adolescent. His stomach was no longer flat or toned, his chest covered in a layer of dark hair, his arms not quite as slim and shapely as he had once become accustomed to, and there were lines forming at the corners of his eyes.
“Whazit?” Harry asked, his voice still rough from sleep.
They kissed and kissed until their pace grew languid and relaxed, lips moving in a sensual dance, slow and sweet like honey. They kissed until the kettle went off and pulled them from their reverie.
“You cheeky motherfucker!” Harry let out with a growl as he reached out to grab Draco’s waistband, pulling him in for a rough and passionate kiss.
“Are you sure that she asked you this? You’re sure it was me she asked about?”
“What? Oh, no I’m just getting us shoes.”
,” he doubled over, abs clenching as his cock twitched in Harry’s mouth, “- you’re gonna kill me, Potter.”
Harry didn’t even hesitate, throwing off his shirt and turning to face Draco before getting down onto his knees.
As the evidence spiraled down the drain, Draco left soft kisses in their wake, leaning in to press his lips to Harry’s neck and shoulders.
It took only a few more insistent strokes of Draco’s tongue before Harry was coming - his cock spurting untouched, ribbons of come landing across the warm skin of his lower belly.
“A little late for the funeral, aren’t we?” Draco commented with a snarl.
Kissing Harry made him feel like a teenager all over again. He could not remember the last time he felt so aroused from just a simple brush of lips. He could not recall a time where he ever felt so hopelessly at the mercy of someone else.
“What do you want?” Draco asked, speaking the words against Harry’s lips, his hand stroking so perfectly around his cock.
A pause stretched between them, and Harry finally looked up at Draco, taking in his pristine appearance, the effortless way he seemed to exude sex with each breath he took, his mere presence setting Harry’s body on edge.
As he looked down at Draco, Harry’s breath caught in his throat, in awe of the heavenly man spread out in his lap.
After taking in Harry’s broken appearance for a moment, Draco reached down and unbuttoned his trousers, pulling the material back until his prick was revealed, the long, flushed length bouncing as it was released from it’s tight prison. The head was glistening and there was one jagged vein running from base to tip. Harry swore he could see it pulsing.
Then the blade was twisting until just the edge was pressed against my skin, the sharp tip teasing me but not yet giving me the pressure I desired.
“Look, I think it’s something you need to hear. Shit - will you just sit down for two seconds and listen to me?”
It was healing, in a sense. Harry and I had come full circle. We had been through hell and back. But by some miracle, we both made it through and found refuge in one another.
“Penny for your thoughts?” Came a whisper from Harry, his tone equally amused and curious.
“What the fuck?” Draco asked aloud, dropping the bag of food unceremoniously onto the kitchen table and walking over to the window.
At the look of shock and amazement on Draco’s face, Harry flashed him a cheeky smile, the white of his teeth nearly blinding him.
Draco brought him off with a patience and a delicacy that Harry didn’t know Draco was capable of.
Harry pressed a kiss to the back of Draco’s neck, and before he could stop himself, he whispered, “I forgive you.”
“God, Potter - so the rumors are true, huh?”
Draco hated the way that something akin to joy settled in his chest as he watched the plant bloom. He hated the way that he could feel Harry’s warmth against his back as he, too, came to observe the plant. He hated the way he shivered when Harry leaned in to rest his chin on Draco’s shoulder, a hand settling casually on his hip, as if it belonged there. Draco hated that another bud began to unfurl, its petals spreading out in a delicate dance.
Harry looked down at his outfit, suddenly wishing that he had worn something more impressive. He didn’t think that the man he was meeting would much appreciate his scuffed trainers or his ratty denims. At least his jumper was somewhat presentable.
Which is precisely why Harry craved nothing of the sort when it came to sex.
As Harry shifted to the scar that lay on my lower abdomen, I began to flash back to that fateful moment at Hogwarts, blood pooling around us as I faded out of consciousness, alone and sinking in pain and self-hatred.
Above him, Draco let out a noise - Surprise? Annoyance? Amusement? Pleasure? Disgust? Harry couldn’t be sure, but he was too afraid to open his eyes and see the look on Draco’s face.
“Fuck, you’re making a mess,” Draco commented, his tone bitter and exasperated even as his hips twitched up into Harry’s mouth, precome leaking onto Harry’s tongue.
Harry ran his sweaty palms over his denims, taking a deep breath before he answered, “I want you to ruin me. I want you to use me without a care for my feelings or comfort. I want you to - to do whatever you want to me.”
Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
George pulled a quill from where it was resting behind his ear and checked off a box on the parchment. He then smiled, speaking quietly to the now-empty room, “The spell worked, Fred. It really fucking
I longed for more - I longed for something beyond the safe cradle of his hand. I craved something that would shock me, something that would draw a strangled breath from my throat, something with a little more…
Next to them, Harry noticed a pair of women grinding together, their bodies entwined so tightly that Harry could barely tell where one woman began and the other ended. Harry watched, unable to look away as the women began to kiss, open-mouthed and wet, tongues brushing together, lips caressing.
Weeks ago, Draco would have given anything to chuck the stupid plant into the rubbage bin, but now… Now Draco felt a strange connection to the plant and a desire to keep it alive. It had become symbolic of his mother’s memory, and Draco certainly wasn’t about to let her memories die.
Draco let out a light hum, causing vibration to spread in waves across his arse, and Harry had to clench his jaw to keep from making noise.
Harry let out a shuddering sigh, tilting his head to the side in a silent invitation - one that Draco accepted without a moment's pause, directing the stream until it hit the edge of Harry’s jaw. Harry allowed his eyes to fall shut, focusing in on the sensation of warmth spreading down his neck.
“Oh, fuck you! That’s pathetic. It was a pastry, not some prized Wizarding artifact, Potter.”
“Death by blowjob? Seriously, Potter? That’s just pathetic.”
“Get on with it!”
. To take in the experience through each of his senses in turn. To drown in the sensations without a care in the world.
Harry’s heart clenched as Draco drew his cock out achingly slow until Harry could feel every inch of it, every throbbing vein, every bead of sweat and drop of precome.
“Just because I sucked your cock doesn’t mean that we're dating, Potter.”
When Harry came, it was more than just an orgasm.
Draco stiffened, his defenses flaring up - Was Potter lying? Was Potter trying to manipulate him? “So you’re saying she just stopped for a fucking ‘chat’ with you in the middle of a goddamn war?!”
“Are you getting close?” Draco inquired, his voice like liquid velvet.
Yet, despite everything they had been through together, something about tonight felt brand new. And Harry felt a delicious mixture of arousal and nervous apprehension stirring inside him.
“Two 45’s, please,” Harry called out to the man behind the counter - a bored-looking fellow with long black hair that fell in front of his face and a sharp nose that reminded Draco oddly of Severus Snape.
Draco swatted at Harry’s head blindly, not taking his eyes away from the plant. “Oh, shove off. I’m not in the mood for your idiotic comments this evening. This plant was dead this morning, I swear… ”
Harry shifted on the loveseat, scratching at the nape of his neck and adjusting his glasses, “Could we - er - How about now?”
Harry sat up straighter in bed, finally sliding his glasses onto his face and taking in Draco in all his grumpy glory, “Erm, first of all, stop throwing things at me. Second of all, I have no fucking clue what you’re talking about.”
Harry swallowed the saliva that had been collecting in his mouth, his cock twitching beneath Draco’s arse as he took him in. His gaze traveled from the coy expression on Draco’s lips, down his long neck, over the miles of smooth marble-white skin covering Draco’s torso, until it rested on the soft bulge in Draco’s briefs.
Harry nearly passed out when he felt Draco’s warm mouth envelop his length. It may have just been a blowjob, but it was already loads better than any sex Harry had had in a very long time. “Fuck, your mouth is perfect,” Harry said on a euphoric exhale.
Harry nuzzled against Draco’s cock, feeling oddly animalistic and moving with his instincts as he rubbed over the hardening length with increasing pressure.
But Draco did not have time to think about how sexy Harry sounded in the morning, because there was a MOTHERFUCKING
“I only speak the truth, Potter. And the truth is that you simply can’t keep up with me sexually - ” Draco examined his nails nonchalantly as he continued, “I’d be best off if I found someone who could better match my - ”
to each arse cheek, loving the satisfying flush that remained behind even as his hand-print faded.
I felt Harry dab gently at the wound before moving onto my next scar. There were four in all. Four wounds that were inflicted on a day of such sorrow. Four wounds now reopened and tended to by the very boy - the very
And with that, Draco stood up from his chair, tucking his softened cock back into his trousers and righting his dress shirt. Then he walked swiftly to the door and held it open, gesturing for Harry to make his exit.
When the blade disappeared, I arched and writhed, searching and aching for it’s return.
Harry nearly choked, coughing roughly as he felt his face flush, overwhelmed by the myriad of images his mind suddenly conjured up.
The thought alone had Draco’s knees weakening, his body threatening to collapse beneath the sheer weight of
Though Harry had never much fancied the taste of Muggle alcohol, he didn’t think he would ever be able to think of beer in the same way. He wondered if he would always get hard when he could taste it on his lips.
While Harry continued to evade his gaze, Draco rolled his eyes - his impatience getting the better of him, “What the fuck do you want, Potter? Why are you actually here?”
Harry twitched as Draco pulled off, shivering as cool air hit the sensitive skin of his wet cock.
Harry heard Draco shifting and felt the mattress dip near him, “Spoon me,” Draco requested - though with Draco everything was more of a command than a request.
This time it was Draco who swallowed aloud. “Favorite toys?”
When Harry arrived outside the club, he had the sudden urge to Disapparate right back to the Ministry. He was torn between two states of mind. In the rational part of Harry’s brain, he knew that this was a horrible idea. He knew that all of his teenaged feelings and ridiculous hormones would come rising right back to the surface until Draco consumed his every thought.
Harry remained silent as Draco turned to the sink and washed his hands.
And so, Draco made the tea, Harry toasted a few crumpets, and the pair of them leaned against the kitchen island, heads cocked sideways as they watched flowers continue to blossom all over the tree.
After a moment, Draco pulled off, wiping saliva and precome from his face as he looked up at Harry, “I’m not sixteen anymore, Potter. You can come on my face or my mouth, or wherever you want for that matter. And I won’t get mad.” He paused and leaned in to kiss over the flushed head of Harry’s cock, “I think it’s hot when I get to swallow someone’s come.”
I nodded, letting out an exhale before I spoke, "I want more… please."
But then Harry’s attention was drawn away as a voice came booming over the loudspeaker, “Happy Friday, boys! It is my pleasure to announce that we are all about to be treated to a deliciously sexy, jaw-dropping performance by a fan favorite.” Cheers broke out among the crowd, as men whooped and hollered, “So, please welcome to the stage… Drake Chambers.”
Harry let out a curse as Draco wrapped a firm hand around his bare cock, giving a few long strokes and savoring the slick slide of foreskin with every movement.
Eventually no more than a full minute would pass without another knock on the front door of the Burrow, and Harry was starting to feel a sense of anxiety creeping up his spine, cold sweat spreading across his upper lip and the dip of his back.
“Is that so?”
Draco looked taken aback as he craned his neck to look at Harry, but he allowed himself to be held.
Harry gasped at the suction and graze of teeth as Draco sucked enthusiastically over his left nipple before shifting to the right. “Holy shit, it’s -  Merlin’s
The more that they fed into their desires, the faster things escalated, and soon Draco was practically ripping off Harry’s jumper before leaning down to get his mouth around Harry’s nipple.
Harry interrupted him before he could finish, “Just let me take you out, Draco.”
But then Draco was leaning forward and grabbing Harry’s wrist with a grip hard enough to bruise. The strength in Draco’s fingers had Harry’s cock twitching feebly in his trousers. “No, Potter. What did I say?”
“I second that.”
“You want it in your mouth, don’t you?” Draco asked, though Harry knew the question was rhetorical. They both knew what he wanted. “Well, go on, then...
Draco didn’t miss the smirk on Harry’s face. Nor did he miss the way it brought warmth rushing to his own cheeks.
“Do you think you are capable of waiting until tomorrow? Do you have the restraint?” Draco inquired, tilting his head to the side, his gaze dropping to the unmistakable hardness in Harry’s denims.
As Draco continued to care for the damned dying plant, he began to notice a pattern. Whenever Harry was around, the plant seemed infinitely healthier. Sometimes it even sprouted new leaves or tiny flower buds the longer that Harry stayed.
In some relationships, this may not have seemed out of the ordinary, but Draco was a very high-maintenance man and he like to be dressed in pristine, well-pressed clothing no matter the hour of the day. At night he slept into silk pajamas and he
But much to Harry's disbelief - and apparently Draco's as well, considering the look of shock spread across his own features - Draco reached out and dragged Harry in for a rough kiss.
After a long pause, Draco simply gave a curt nod. “Would you like to come in - ” Draco began, but before he could finish his question, Harry was stepping across the threshold and settling himself onto the crushed velvet armchair in Draco’s sitting room.
As Harry recovered from his high, he took in the debauched image of Draco Malfoy on his knees: dressed in a pristine tailored suit and a pair of silver Dragon-hide boots, his lips swollen and red, a stray bit of come hanging on the edge of his lip, his pupils blown wide, and his hair mussed from Harry’s grasp. He was perfect. Perfectly sexy and perfectly smug.
Harry pulled Draco’s cock out of his trousers, leaning in for a moment to smell it, inhaling deeply and dragging his nose along the shaft until it was pressed against Draco’s balls. Draco’s scent was warm and musky - and it was intoxicating to Harry.
“Would you like to suck my cock?” Draco asked, his tone as nonchalant as though he was offering Harry a cup of tea.
light, if anything! I mean, it makes the white you're wearing stand out like a damn
from her favorite French bakery.”
Draco pulled out, and Harry felt a hand on his shoulder guiding his body to turn - Harry didn’t fight it. He barely held back tears when Draco’s long fingers wrapped so perfectly around his cock. But he clenched his eyes shut harder still, turning his head into his shoulder, repeating Draco’s words like a mantra, trying to keep himself grounded even as his heart was leaping off the edge.
Right in front of them a new flower burst into existence with a soft little pop! Blood red petals danced before them with orange veins mapping across the delicate surfaces, as leaves blossomed from behind in varying shades of green that reminded Draco unmistakably of the Slytherin house colors.
that Draco was drowning in.
Harry gasped for air as Draco’s hips pumped at a relentless pace, the sensation of Harry’s impending orgasm racing through his body from the faded scar pressed into the mattress, to the tips of his fingers clenched numbly in the silken sheets below him, to the curl of his toes.
want?” Draco drawled, leaning against the doorframe and trying to convey an air of effortless superiority sprinkled with exasperation.
Draco simply raised his eyebrows in reply, silently saying
A sharp exhale echoed in their quiet bedroom, and Draco pulled Harry’s arm tighter around him.
“Yeah... I like it all,” Harry said on a exhale, letting out a small laugh and wondering how the bloody hell he ever got so lucky.
Draco spent the next few minutes losing himself in the sensation of Harry’s cock. He tried to memorize the taste, the girth, the long vein running up the right side. He wanted to immortalize this moment, because, fuck if he ever finds a cock more beautiful than this one.
your hands, Potter.”
With that one word it felt as though the temperature in the room shifted. He was hot but the air was so cold. His touch was fire but his breath blew across my skin like ice.
Harry couldn’t stop himself and he leaned over to mouth over Draco’s latex-covered cock, tasting the burn of the alcohol on his tongue and licking his lips as he looked back up once more, his own eyes blown wide with lust.
A beat passed where Harry thought that Draco was going to continue to ignore him, was going to pretend that he had never said anything at all.
A long fingered hand traced a line from Harry’s navel all the way up to his neck. Draco paused to squeeze his throat before his fingers were tipping Harry’s chin up, their lips connecting and heat quickly spreading throughout his body.
Harry looked up at him, his chin striped with come and his lips swollen -  he hummed, nudging his nose against Draco's cock, “This wouldn’t be a bad way to die.”
It was truly something out of Harry’s teenage fantasies.
It took Harry a moment to realize just what Draco was asking. But then he was leaning in and running the tip of his nose over the slight bulge in Draco’s trousers, tracing over the length of it and inhaling deeply, letting Draco’s scent fill him up, the sensation intoxicating. Harry breathed deeply, expelling warm breath over Draco’s cock with each exhale, feeling it harden in his trousers, the material pulling taut.
And then Draco was spilling inside of him, hot and quivering. His thighs trembled to hold him up as his cock pulsed against the stretched rim of Harry’s hole.
Yes, it had seemed to perk up for a while, but soon after Harry left, the buds died out and the plant seemed to droop.
“Is that a code?” Draco inquired, craning his neck when the mini-Snape disappeared from view.
“Stop your incessant moving, would you? I swear each bounce of your knee is shaking off dirt and dust from your filthy trainers and soiling my custom-made carpet.”
His heartbeat was thunderous, beating wildly beneath his hand.
Draco swatted at Harry with a rolled up newspaper and then chucked a pillow-mint in Harry’s direction, as if the newspaper swatting hadn’t had enough emphasis, “Oh, shove off. Don’t play naive; I know what you did.”
“Yeah, so what? I know I was yours too, you wanker.”
They played some barbaric game where they whacked the head of a small woodland creature every time it popped out of a hole, flicked coins into a set of slots to try and earn a prize, and even tried their hand at the game that nearly took off Draco's head earlier in the evening: ‘Air Hockey.’
Harry stopped, pulling Draco back toward him, a glint of mischief in his eyes, “No. I have a better idea.”
Harry obeyed without hesitation, pushing himself off the loveseat and kneeling on the floor.
“Er - I did knock, but then no one answered… and the door was open, so I just figured - ”
Draco wondered how they had gone from enemies to… well, to this.
Then Draco was shifting, lying on his back across Harry’s thighs and leaning up to capture Harry’s other nipple in his mouth, enveloping it in the same delicious heat. But this time Harry could see
On the windowsill above his kitchen sink, the notorious plant - which had been dead not an hour prior - was suddenly greener than he had ever seen it, the color so vibrant it was shocking. Not only that, a full flower was blooming off to the side.
Then, without any warning, someone came bursting into the room, startling Harry.
“Hard to be mouthy when you’re about to come, isn’t it Draco?”
For some reason, Draco was not surprised in the least to find Harry standing on his doorstep once again.
Draco fell silent, his heart skipping a beat in his chest. And as much as Draco’s cynical side wanted to think that Potter was full of bollocks and that his mother had done no such thing, there was a stronger part of Draco that was desperate for anything positive to grasp onto.
Harry shook his head so subtly he wasn’t quite sure if Draco had noticed the movement.
Draco’s heart was now thundering out of control, his head spinning while he poured two glasses of Mead with a shaking hand.
Wrapping a hand around his length, Harry began to stroke his cock with a slow yet steady rhythm, feeling as blood continued to rush to his cock, his veins becoming more prominent with each stroke of his hand.
But then a glimmer of hope - a ridiculously useless emotion - caught hold of Draco’s heart and suddenly he found himself sitting down across from Harry with a bored expression on his face. “Fine. You have five minutes.”
When Draco finally got his lips wrapped around Harry, his entire world became focused in on his cock. He wanted to memorize every taste, every smell, every curve, and every throbbing vein.
They both settled down onto their backs on the bed, staring intently up at the ceiling as if something tremendously interesting was happening up there.
“Raw. And hard,” Harry replied without hesitation, his vision blurring as his mind swam with images, snippets of naked bodies moving harshly together, of hands curling around throats and nails scratching down backs. “I want you to pin me down or tie me up if you have to, I want you to pound your cock inside of me until I can’t see straight. I want to be powerless. I want to be nothing more than a hole for you to fuck.”
“I - you know what I said,” Draco replied with a hint of annoyance, making a show of turning a page in his book, as if to communicate in all his sassy glory,
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t heard or seen another man pissing before. But, this was Draco Malfoy. And fuck Harry if the sight of Draco standing in front of the toilet, softened prick resting heavily in his hand, wasn’t the sexiest thing he had ever seen.
Harry scuffed his trainers awkwardly against Draco’s front step, avoiding Draco’s gaze as he spoke under his breath, “Just wanted to come give my respects.”
“Beautiful,” Harry whispered, his voice still rough from my cock. I recalled the feeling of bucking into his hotly pliant mouth, my cock sliding between swollen lips and reaching toward the back of Harry’s throat. I recalled the clink of metal as I knocked his glasses askew.
As Harry stepped inside, he took a moment to glance around the old room, now empty save for an armchair pulled over near the window and a small stack of books on the window sill.
Draco’s eyes had darkened at Harry’s words, his body shifting imperceptibly closer to Harry on the couch, muscles in his neck tightening and releasing quickly before he spoke.
as a centaur.”
Draco began to squeeze his toes around Harry’s length. Sue him, this was a kink Draco had never explored, never realized he’d even want to explore, and
“Yeah. Yeah, I really fucking do,” Harry replied, unable to hold back a light laugh as he admitted something that he was often so ashamed of. “I like to be choked, scratched, bit, pinched, slapped, spanked -”
He reached down to wrap a hand around the hard outline of Harry’s cock, desire coursing through him at the broken cry it tore from Harry’s lips.
He got up as quickly as he could and looked around for Draco, spotting his arse walking through the crowd and away from the stage.
Harry nodded, and Draco’s grip loosened just slightly, his thumb tracing over the sensitive skin of Harry’s wrist.
Harry could see that the can was unopened, and he watched as Draco lifted the tab with a satisfying
A beat passed where Draco’s eyes darted over Harry’s face and body, as though searching for something hidden in the desperation of Harry’s gaze.
Draco laid in bed for a while, simply petting his hands through Harry’s hair until he, too, began to stir.
Harry grinned, “Hell yes.”
“I’m not an imbecile. And I’m not mannerless,” Harry stated in his defense, swallowing audibly as Draco continued to walk toward him, stepping closer and closer until he was close enough to touch. “I came here to find a Dom. If that’s not what you do, then I’ll show myself out.”
Harry’s cheeks flushed a deep red and his cock twitched in Draco’s hand.
But before Harry could speak, Draco’s face broke out in a wicked grin, “See you tomorrow…
Draco shook himself out of his stupor and looked up - watching as a new flower bud grew slowly beside the first, the petals trembling much like Draco’s fingers.
Suddenly, they were left lying in the darkness of their bedroom, just a small sliver of moonlight peaking through a crack in the curtains.
With each touch, his pleasure increased, the warmth spreading from his core until it was sparking magic on the tips of his fingers.
This was not the first time they had fucked. In fact, this was not even the hundredth time they had fucked. The pair of them had been together for years, had been through the aftermath of the War, the rebuilding of Hogwarts, and the treacherous period of healing for the Wizarding World as a whole.
Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth, unable to help himself, unable to contain the fire that was building inside of him.
It wasn’t until the announcer came on the loudspeaker, that Harry remembered that he was kneeling in the middle of a stage, shirtless and covered in sweat and dried-alcohol.
Although Draco’s cock was thin, it was long and Harry began to gag a bit around Draco’s length as he pushed down. Draco pressed harder to Harry’s head, forcing him to take in more of his cock, “I don’t give a damn if you’re coughing. I expect you to swallow me all the way.”
“Don’t stop,” Harry whined, his hands fisted in the sheets beside his head, his lips a deep red from where he had bitten them. “Please, don’t stop. I - I want you. Just like this. Just -
With his hands on Draco’s back for leverage, Harry led the pair of them down slowly until Draco was lying with his back on the floor and Harry lying beside him.
He pulled open the flaps of Draco’s trousers, revealing his naked cock, almost fully hard - the tip flushed and glowing under the moonlight.
But as soon as Harry left for the night, the plant was practically dead by the following morning.
Harry worked him over until Draco's thighs were trembling, his fists clenched in Harry's hair, and his come shooting out over Harry's tongue and chin moments later.
“What ever gave you that idea, Malfoy?” Harry asked sarcastically, huffing out a laugh.
They both shook as they came, bodies releasing with blinding pleasure and an eruption of emotions.
Draco winked.
Draco pushed himself up off of Harry’s lap and began collecting his earnings, thanking the crowd as he went.
It was insane and intriguing all at once. It reminded Draco of the time in fifth year when the Weasel twins had tried to blow up the Great Hall in the middle of exams.
After a moment, Harry had made up his mind, “I trust you.”
In a flash of hands grappling at trousers and shirt buttons raining down onto the floor as they were ripped from their seams, Draco suddenly found himself up in his bedroom, nearly naked -  save for his pants - his back firmly against his mattress while Harry straddled his thighs, a devious twinkle in his gaze.
Above him, Draco used his hand to guide Harry’s head closer until his nose nearly brushed the bulge of Draco’s cock.
“And why the bloody hell is it called that? It should be called a - a
- who caused them. But instead of fear, these four wounds were now opened with love.
They had been married for nearly five years when those fateful words slipped from Draco’s lips.
Just when Draco was about to break the silence, Harry was grabbing his hand and leading him off into a sea of machines.
Harry was surprised by the gentle touch of Draco’s fingers against his skin, surprised that Draco was even capable of such softness. Their sex so often mirrored the heady passion and tension of their youth - it was rough, primal, and run entirely on instinct.
walked around in just his briefs.
But just before he made his move, he locked eyes with Harry, his mouth practically watering, “The rumor where you are
Harry quickly ducked into a stall, removing his outer robes and reaching for his wallet from his back pocket. Harry had never been so bloody thankful for Hermione’s expertise at Undetectable Extension Charms, reaching into the largest pocket of his wallet, and pulling out a plain black t-shirt and a pair of denims.
“-but this first time… I - I want to come with your lips on mine, not on my cock. Is that alright? I mean - we don’t have to. You can go back -”
Draco shrugged his shoulders and rotated his foot slightly, dragging the arch of his foot along the length of it and feeling for the head of Harry’s cock with his toes.
The pressure was gone for only a second before Harry was pinching and twisting my nipples with a force that drew a strangled curse from deep inside me, shockwaves emanating from my chest. Pain and pleasure surrounded me, whirling and winding like a braid, until both parts formed something new entirely.
“Typically, subs would wait outside the door until given permission to enter,” someone spoke, the man’s voice velvety smooth and yet striking. It sounded oddly familiar, though Harry couldn’t quite place it.
Harry choked, coughing and gagging as he fought not to bite down on Draco’s prick, the force of Draco’s hips sending his cock plunging impossibly deeper down Harry’s throat.
Draco paused, staring up at the moon and trailing a thumb over the back of Harry’s hand. “I get to plan our next date.”
, and looked up to examine Draco’s facial expression.
He shouldn’t have been surprised when Draco Malfoy emerged from the shadows, a smirk gracing his lips as he stepped forward, but seeing Draco still made his heart jump and his body tense.
It was an immeasurable contrast to compare that moment to the present, as I lay safely in Harry's arms. The pain was no longer a curse, but a choice.
Harry had to bite his lip to keep from smiling.
Harry leaned down, catching the shell of Draco’s ear between his teeth and letting out a smile when Draco whined, straining against the weight of Harry’s body as he held him down.
After a while, Draco shifted, pressing soft kisses to Harry’s cheekbones, the shell of his ear, and the curve of his jawline. Then he licked a wet trail down Harry’s neck, pausing when he reached his collarbone.
Harry laughed, sounding delighted as he replied, “It's not magic, it's electricity. It's called a blacklight.”
Draco could feel Harry’s cock growing hard against his thigh, Harry’s hips beginning to tilt just slightly, seeking friction, seeking
He didn’t want his orgasm to come just from touch, he wanted to hear it, to smell it, to taste it, to see it. And he wanted others to share in the experience with him.
A sharp searing pain hit Harry for a brief moment, though it faded quickly. “And I gather that you quite like it?” Draco inquired with a smirk, his tongue poking out to lick his reddened lips.
After one last deep inhale, Harry wrapped his lips around the head of Draco’s cock.
Draco’s eyes were heavily lidded, his pupils blown wide, a fire evident in his gaze, his lips were flushed and plump with teeth marks, his alabaster cheeks filled with color, and a cold sweat was breaking out at his temples.
I felt a breath on my neck, a warm wash of air before teeth were sinking into skin, lips and tongue soothing over the bite as my back arched, moving closer to his warmth.
As Draco tucked himself back into his pants - the dark grey pair that always emphasized the curve of Draco’s arse perfectly - Harry should have walked away, should have pretended that he hadn’t been watching. But there Harry stood, paralyzed with desire.
“And how do you want to be fucked?”
He hollowed his cheeks as he sucked the finger further and further into his mouth.
Harry hurried to catch up with him - deciding that he would worry about his missing shirt later.
“Up you get,” Draco requested, his cock twitching when Harry gave it one last lick, trailing from base to tip. “God, I forget how much you love this.”
“Why, no, Potter. I did not realize that it’s out of the ordinary to have a - a -” Draco paused, gesturing wildly at the flowering monstrosity, “- a sex plant grow into a full tree - overnight! - because I finally had sex with my childhood wetdream. Totally normal!” He exclaimed, his voice cracking at the absurdity of it all.
Harry chuckled lightly and he leaned down to bite my earlobe, sucking the sensitive flesh into his mouth. “Well, of course I do. But it’s far more fun to hear you say it.”
The grip around Harry’s wrist tightened painfully for moment as Draco’s eyes went dark, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. “Very well, then. I appreciate your honesty, Potter.” He let go of Harry’s hand, adjusting Harry’s glasses in a moment of uncharacteristic warmth, “I will send you home as you are. If you come, then tomorrow you will be punished. And if you manage not to come, then tomorrow you will be
It made no sense, really. Except it made perfect sense to him.
He barely suppressed a moan when the hands tightened around his abdomen.
Draco looked relaxed, his slim shoulders sloped down, the typical clench of his jaw gone, his blond locks sleep mussed and perfectly imperfect. Harry watched, entranced beyond belief, as a light stream of piss began to flow from the tip of Draco’s cock, a bright sound reaching Harry’s ears and sending shivers down the nape of his neck. Draco let out a sigh of contentment, one that so mirrored the sigh of ecstasy he would let out after sex, his head tilting back just slightly, as if basking in the sensation of relief.
Whenever Harry dropped into subspace, it was as if he was suspended underwater, his mind hardly processing anything beyond the commands he was carrying out. He felt cocooned, safe, his body light in a way it had never felt before.
Harry watched as Draco reached down to slide his hands up the side of his body, and it was then that Harry noticed the leather corsets lacing up his slim forearms.
Draco began to get dressed as Harry stared at a spot on the ceiling and wondered how in the hell he ever got himself into this situation. No more than a few minutes later, Harry heard a
As I sunk further into the safety of Harry's arms, I reshaped the memory in my mind, not altering it entirely, but adding in moments of love and healing in the midst of such chaos.
Merlin’s
chosen outfit for the evening).
Harry wanted it all.
Eyelids fluttering and chest heaving, Harry acted on instinct, grabbing for Draco’s arse and moving their hips roughly together. The friction of their cocks had his fingers curling painfully into Draco’s flesh. They both sighed into it, leaning impossibly closer to one another and beginning to grind their cocks together - Harry’s denims brushing against Draco’s custom-tailored trousers.
The first pass of the blade against my skin released an animalistic noise from the pit of my stomach. Harry moved slowly, first sliding the flat of the blade against my abdomen, my breathing stuttering as I felt the blade press closer on every exhale.
The pair of them began to sway with the music, moving as one.
“Exactly. You are not to come until we meet again tomorrow. I expect you to be here at six o’clock sharp. This time you will kneel at the door and wait for permission to enter, do you understand?”
I held my breath as Harry's blade hovered over my first scar, the one that lay directly over my heart.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh at that, and for a moment Draco chuckled as well.
It didn’t take more than a few more thrusts.
Harry suddenly felt as though the temperature of the room had increased by several degrees.
Draco ignored Harry’s question for a moment, far too fixated on what it would feel like to have Harry in his mouth.
Harry laughed, “Any final thoughts?”
“So, tell me, Draco - do you want more or less?” Harry asked, and though I could not see him, I could hear the smirk in Harry’s voice.
“Everything,” Draco replied quietly, shifting uncomfortably on the bed and still avoiding Harry’s gaze. “Nothing, actually,” he corrected after a moment.
“Get up here,” Harry requested breathlessly.
“Where’d you learn that?” Harry asked breathlessly, his pupils dark and cock hard.
Harry soon picked up the pace, twisting his wrist on each stroke and responding to the cues of Draco’s body in turn.
As he stepped inside, Harry noticed that the furnishings in this room, while no less high-quality, were much more approachable, more simplistic. Something about the room eased the discomfort building in Harry’s chest.
Harry felt his heart skitter to a stop at Draco’s words before beginning to beat at lightning speed. He suddenly regretted asking at all.
Just as Harry was about to pull off, feeling that he had accomplished his task, Both of Draco’s hands came to rest on top of Harry’s head and he gave a hard thrust of his hips.
Harry smirked, “No, but I wondered if I could treat you to dinner.”
Just then, the man from the counter returned carrying two pairs of truly hideous shoes that appeared to have wheels strapped to the bottom of them.
And then Draco was getting down onto his own knees, pulling Harry in for a quick kiss before he guided him to lie down on his back.
Someone threw a can of beer in their direction, and with the speed and agility of a former Seeker, Draco caught it with ease.
Draco rolled his eyes but a smile spread across his lips before he could stop it. “I’m not either, Potter. Not mad at all.”
Draco tilted his head to the side and considered the plant in front of him. And then he considered the boy behind him. The boy who was no longer a boy, but in fact, a man. A very handsome man.
A moment later, one of the women glanced over, locking eyes with Harry, a mischievous glint in her eye as she leaned up to whisper something in the ear of her partner.
“You’re up quite late, aren’t you Potter? Thought you had a curfew of just before sunset.”
“Do you have any particular kinks?”
“What magic is this?” Draco asked, shielding his eyes from Harry's obnoxious brightness.
After knocking softly, Harry tested the door handle, the door opening easily to his touch.
Harry needed no further instruction. He moved back onto his knees and finally wrapped his lips around the head of Draco’s cock. It was even warmer than he expected, the flesh hot beneath his tongue.
As Draco walked toward their bedroom, he stole glances at Harry from over his shoulder, something innocent and boyish to his posture despite the mischief in his gaze.
Hands twisted in sheets, back arched, eyes pressed shut in an effort to stop the tears - but then Draco dragged the sharp curve of his nose down the back of Harry’s neck, his warm breath spreading across Harry’s skin… a lover’s kiss.
The finale note hit and the crowd erupted into raucous applause around them, money being thrown onto the stage as people shouted and whistled in support.
His eyes flew open as a loud
“Fuck - Draco - it’s perfect -” Harry gasped out, his hips thrusting wildly and only increasing the fiery heat pooling inside Draco’s stomach.
, it felt incredible.
The next few seconds seemed to last an eternity as they leaned in for a kiss.
Harry took in a deep breath, allowing the air in the room to fill his lungs fully, before he let it out.
And while Draco continuously complained about the stupidity of Muggle games and the unnecessarily loud music that they played inside the arcade, he was secretly enjoying himself.
It wasn’t until Harry Potter was actually sitting on the floor of his living room, surrounded by containers of food, that Draco actually registered that Harry had brought them both dinner.
For a moment, all was still and silent, Draco standing over Harry with his soft cock poised and at the ready. Harry’s heart was thundering in his chest, his muscles tightened in anticipation of what was to come.
Draco hummed as though satisfied with Harry's reaction, licking slow and deep as he collected the drop of precome on the tip of his finger and used it to tease under the head of Harry’s cock.
Soon, Draco’s hand was moving down, down, down until his fingertips slipped below the waistband of Harry’s denims, scratching his nails against the sensitive skin.
But most of all, Draco hated that he finally realized what all this meant.
Just when Draco was about to flick open to the buttons of Harry’s trousers, Harry was swatting away Draco’s hand and dropping to his knees.
There was nothing quite like the freedom of being told exactly what to do.
Draco reached out to interrupt him, placing a hand on Harry’s chest in a way that seemed to drain the anxiety building inside him. Then Draco slid his hand up until it was curled over Harry’s shoulder.
Up on the stage, the bass and guitar had ceased, leaving just the drums echoing throughout the crowd. Harry swore that he felt the drums inside him and the sensation had him shivering, his eyes closing as the crowd began to sing in unison, a choir of voices singing acapella, each note rushing over Harry’s skin and causing him to tremble.
“Think it will just keep goin’?” Harry wondered aloud, mouth full of crumpet.
“I like plugs, spanking paddles, nipple clamps… anything, really.”
It wasn’t until Draco began reaching out to gather the tips being waved his way that he finally noticed Harry.
He fussed with his hair when he caught his reflection in a mirror hanging on the wall opposite him, trying to tame his perpetually messy black strands.
I felt loved. I felt healed. I felt whole.
Harry didn’t let Draco say another word, reaching down to steady Draco’s head before beginning to fuck his cock shallowly into his mouth, his prick sliding perfectly back and forth across the warm cocoon of Draco’s tongue. Fucking
As they continued to kiss, Harry fumbled with the maze of buttons and zippers on Draco’s trousers. When he finally got the damn things opened he let out an “Aha!” that he had most definitely meant to say in his head.
But apparently Harry wanted to go a step further, as he hooked his thumbs into Draco’s briefs and pulled them down below his arse.
Harry’s eyelids fluttered when Draco pet gently across the velvety-soft skin of his cock, caressing it with a touch that was feather-light and yet it seared a line of fire that made his cock leak, precome dripping onto his belly.
Harry shook his head, leaning back so that his head rested on the man’s shoulder, “Just wanted to be closer.”
“Absolutely none.”
Soon Harry was leaning up against the tree, with Draco’s tongue and fingers working their way inside of him.
yes.”
Harry nodded, but then paused. “It’s not just rough. I want - it sounds pathetic, maybe insane, but I want someone to destroy me.”
Draco’s hand stroked over Harry’s throbbing cock while Harry kissed him helplessly, his body grinding and moving of its own accord, the sexual energy taking over.
Harry loved everything about sucking a cock. From the weight of it in his mouth to the way it left him breathless. The entire experience was exhilarating and Harry never tired of it.
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped into his briefs, tossing his wet towel into the hamper and turning back toward Draco, “Piss off. What did you say, though? Just now.”
Harry let out a groan, “Fuck me! - Who blabbed? It was Ginny wasn’t it? Always trying to get me back for the pranks the twins and I used to pull on her.”
“Hoping for an autograph, Potter?”
With the same reverent touch, Draco guided Harry’s other leg into the same position, spreading his legs open in a way that had Harry suppressing a shiver, knowing just how exposed he must look.
He felt drunk as he recovered from his high, his body trembling from the aftershocks.
“Anything specific?” Harry inquired.
But then Draco spoke, “Tell me more. As your Dom, what would you want me to do to you?”
Just as Harry was considering leaving - thinking he had made a mistake coming to such a high-end business - a thin witch with a harsh set of features and a sharpness in her gaze stepped out of door off to Harry’s right, “Sir will see you now.”
But on the other hand, there was a section of his brain, hidden deep down inside, that was drawn toward the club, toward Draco, and toward the impossible possibilities.
Grumbling and barely suppressing a yawn, Harry blinked at the blurry outline of Draco’s pale and naked figure, “Where is what?”
“Your mouth is incredible. Now, don’t get cocky on me - ”
Finally, they stumbled upon some devilish game titled
As Harry turned his head, he noticed a man now standing in the corner of his room. A man who he had just been fantasizing about. A man who was now walking towards him with the same hungry superiority in his eyes and a purpose in his stride.
mischief in Draco’s eyes had Harry groaning, hands coming up to rub soothing circles into Draco’s sides, “It was perfect.”
Draco leaned in close, making sure he was out of earshot of the counter-worker, “Is he a Wizard? Why was he asking you about Goblins and Dragons, I thought this was a Muggle club.”
Harry stopped dead in his tracks as he entered their flat, and Draco glanced up at him, a look in his eyes that had Harry’s heart racing.
As my head spun, a quiet
As Draco closed the front door behind Harry and led them into the kitchen, something peculiar caught his eye.
Harry may have survived a War, and more than a few attempts on his life, but he could have died happily right then and there.
Draco growled in frustration. “You don’t understand! This plant seems to - it changes around - well, it -” Draco stopped himself after a moment. If he told Potter, he would sound insane. “Nevermind.”
around?”
Harry hummed with pleasure and allowed himself to be pulled back until Draco’s arms encircled his chest. And hands skimmed down until his cock was encircled in warmth.
Grabbing drinks seemed to be a good way to distract himself as Draco processed Harry’s words, and he realized that this - this thing that they were doing? It was basically dating.
As Harry and Draco both exited the room, hands clasped and cheeks flushed, making a break for the back door, George Weasley stood hidden in the closet of his old room, the door cracked open and a parchment clutched in his hands.
“Where are we going?” Harry asked breathlessly as Draco dragged him back through the arcade toward the entrance, shoes on the wrong feet and cock still hard in his denims.
A rush of heat stirred inside Harry as he obeyed the instruction, the smooth velvet of Draco’s words running over his skin in a way that left him warm and shivering.
Silence followed, and after a moment Harry glanced up, noticing that Draco looked dumbstruck.
“How - I - ”
“Right. Yep. Okay. Well, erm...so -”
“You requested my presence,” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow at the deliciously disheveled man laid out below him.
Draco gave one last suck to Harry’s cock before he obliged.
Draco let his eyes drag from Harry’s feet - where his usually scuffed-up trainers were now shining - up his legs to where Harry’s white t-shirt now glowed brilliantly.
Harry ran an awkward hand over the nape of his neck, “At least I showed up at all…”
But Draco did not stop there, he began to thrust his hips with increasing speed, fucking his cock deeper inside Harry’s mouth while his hands held Harry’s head steady, not allowing him to move.
“Well you won’t,” Draco snapped back with a devilish smirk on his lips, finally releasing his grip on Harry’s hair and watching as Harry collapsed in a pathetic heap in front of him, a blotchy flush covering his skin and a thin sheen of sweat shining on his forehead.
Once Draco’s trousers were splayed open, Harry caught a glimpse of Draco’s flushed cock and fell to his knees on instinct, his mouth watering at the sight.
And Harry truly meant it.
of a lot of spice.
Draco nodded, straining to lean up and capture Harry’s lips in a kiss. But Harry pulled back an inch, leaving his lips just out of Draco’s reach.
He wanted the pure freedom to simply
If it hadn’t been a pity gift from when news of his mother’s passing broke, he would have already incinerated it.
Whines and curses were building up below the surface as Harry focused in on the sensations around him.
He picked up and inspected the potted plant with immense confusion, his brain whirring as it attempted to explain the sudden and exuberant rebirth. Typically Potter’s presence seemed to bring more life to the plant, but this was far more ‘alive’ than Draco had ever seen it.
“You are so far from what I expected,” Draco’s voice was soft… so soft it was as if he had not intended to say anything at all. But even as Draco spoke with a gentle sort of shock, his grip in Harry’s hair tightened, making Harry gasp out in a mixture of pleasure and pain.
brought him out of his reverie.
Draco glared in his direction, “Yes, Potter. We really should get your hearing checked, I think you’ve gone senile.”
For some reason it felt so…
Harry let out a sound that was somehow a chuckle, a moan, and a curse all wrapped into one beautiful symphony that was truly music to Draco’s ears.
Taking another swig of Mead, Draco let out a sigh before handing the bottle over to Harry, “It’s a long story.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Ha - Ha, Malfoy. Now move over, I brought Thai food.”
Harry nodded in understanding and fumbled with his trousers as he rushed to show Draco the strength of his desire. As Harry finally pulled the trousers down, his cock swung free, the head flushed and pulsing, his balls hanging heavily.
It didn’t take long before Draco was coming, streaks landing across Draco’s stomach and the back of Harry’s hand.
After removing their briefs and cleaning up with a quick spell, Draco settled into the comfort of his bed, with Harry Potter nestled in his arms.
Harry let out a sigh and rounded the bed, plopping down beside Draco, “Ok. Well, what exactly are you sorry for?”
“Childhood wetdream, huh?” Harry asked, a foot reaching out to pat Draco’s arse as he packed his favorite Earl Grey tea into the strainer.
It was everything that Draco had ever wanted, but could never admit outside of his nightly wank.
It was something he had confessed to Draco weeks ago over a glass of Mead by the fire. Harry had feared Draco’s reaction, wondered if he would laugh or give Harry snark about such a pathetic desire. But to Harry’s surprise Draco had done nothing of the sort.
“Shhhh...” Harry whispered, a single finger tapping lightly against Draco’s lips.
“I feel like I need a drink,” Draco said after a while, his fingers now tracing patterns on the back of Harry’s hand.
“You just figured that you would walk inside like a mannerless imbecile?”
“Mmmm, don’t mind if I do.”
It was satisfying to watch Draco stumble, his steps faltering for a brief moment, taken aback by Harry’s boldness. And Harry couldn’t help but notice that the bulge looked larger when he pulled back.
If it had been anyone else, Draco would have cursed them out, maybe sent a Stinging Hex for good measure. But this was Harry Potter - golden boy and doer of good deeds - and in many ways Draco’s family deserved that comment.
The words broke Harry out of his momentary stupor, and Harry suddenly found that he didn’t know the answer.
When Harry glanced up from beneath his hair, Draco was nodding, jotting down a note on his roll of parchment.
pants, he looked good up there.
In spite of all the apparent idiocy and annoyance Draco expressed about the dancing game, he found it nearly impossible not to smile, or at least laugh, while he was trying to keep up with the fast footwork required by a game that Harry affectionately called “DDR.”
Then, Draco was leaning over to grab his wand, casting a couple of quick charms until the room began to transform around them. The curtains were drawn closed, the candles blown out, the door shut, and the bathroom light turned off.
But apparently this was a night of surprises.
“Do you think you can handle it…
He looked
A grin spread uninhibited across Draco’s face as he stood, his back toward Harry. He quickly schooled it into a smirk as he whirled around, “The Weaselette didn’t say a word. I guessed and, lucky for me,
I scowled for a moment, glaring into the darkness that covered my eyes.
Harry wanted nothing more than to listen, obey, and feel.
,” Draco sighed on a breathless exhale, pressing a brief kiss to Harry’s inner thigh before moving back in for more.
Finally, Harry made it to the stage. He was so close that he could see beads of sweat dripping off the bassist as he played, his eyes closed and head tilted towards the heavens as if in prayer.
Harry melted into it, pressing his face into Draco’s neck with silent moans as gave into the pleasure, an orgasm building in a beautiful crescendo until it spilled onto the tile floor below them, rushing down the drain with the rest of their secret pleasures.
Normally, Harry would have opened his eyes, would have carded his hands through Draco’s silky blond hair, would have pulled him up for a languid kiss. Yet, something was stirring inside Harry this morning, a heat growing and swirling as he allowed Draco to explore his sleep-pliant body.
And that’s when Draco made his way over to the bed, crawling toward Harry in a way that had him shivering with desire.
This time Harry wasn’t just chuckling, he was letting out a full belly-laugh, bending over from the force of it as his laugh echoed through the room. “Malfoy, you poor sodding idiot. Has your life been so miserable that you really think good things can’t happen to you? Bloody hell.”
Harry looked up dazedly before the words seemed to register. Then his knee stopped moving abruptly and he ran a hand through his hair, as if unsure of what else to do with his extremities. “Sorry,” he mumbled.
Harry merely rolled his eyes. But then he began talking a bit more coherently, so Draco would call that a win.
While Draco had made a home for himself between Harry’s spread legs, Harry had been drifting in and out of sleep, so relaxed and content that his body was floating in a space of ecstasy, moving gracefully between planes of consciousness.
Draco tipped his head back, taking a swig of the alcohol and twisting his fingers tightly in Harry’s hair.
Before Draco could even make a move, Harry was backing him up, plastering Draco against a wall of brick and kissing him senseless, grabbing at every bit of skin he could reach.
Draco hummed his approval. “Stroke yourself - just lightly.”
Listening to the kids banter with one another instantly brought Draco back to their school days. Though thinking back on Hogwarts often stirred up a mixture of emotions, both fond memories as well as nightmares that left him trembling, there was something about listening to those kids squabble that was actually rather sweet.
When Draco turned to join Harry in the sitting room, he was struck by the anxiety that was emanating from Harry in waves. Draco could see the panic in the tense set of his shoulders, the flitting gaze of his eyes, and the rhythmic bouncing of his knee.
“Are you saying that you don’t like my shoes, Potter? Because I don’t appreciate that. These are Goblin-made!”
Harry would never forget the mixture of emotions in Draco’s eyes as he stared at Harry, the fear, the pity, the hurt. But maybe, just maybe, there was a twinge of hope.
And with that, I dozed off in Harry's warm embrace. My last memory before I succumbed to sleep was Harry beginning to heal my wounds.
Draco was speechless.
… you really are going to kill me,” Draco said with a sigh, his heart beating at a thunderous pace as a fire spread through every inch of his body - the intense heat a delicious combination of pain and pleasure.
Something akin to pride flashed in Draco’s eyes before he leaned down and wrapped his lips around Harry’s left nipple.
“Mmm, perhaps. But your cock certainly did,” Harry hummed and gave Draco’s cock a particularly long stroke, pausing at the top to run his thumb under the head.
As Draco rounded the corner and walked into the kitchen, he stopped dead in his tracks, Harry sleepily bumping into him after the abrupt stop.
Even while Draco held him by the hair, forcing Harry to look up at him, Harry’s body was straining forward, his cock practically splitting out of his denims. “Merlin, you’re such a slut for this, aren’t you?” His tone was impressed and disgusted all at the same time, which only made Harry’s heart beat faster.
“Er, Draco. Your plant is… sprouting?”
Harry’s hips bucked into Draco’s touch. But Harry didn't have a chance to speak, because Draco was already pulling Harry’s trousers open and dropping to his knees.
He could still hear the music as it echoed throughout the park, he was overwhelmed by the smells of the forest, sweat, and sex, he could still taste Draco on his lips, as the sun began to set, he could see the golden pink glow on everything around him, and he could feel Draco’s cock, hard and throbbing as it fucked inside of him.
And they could not have been more perfect.
“God, you are such a child,” Draco whined, though the whine quickly morphed into a moan as Harry slipped his hand inside Draco’s trousers and wrapped it around his cock.
When Harry looked up at Draco from the floor, a soft smile crossed his lips. The approval in his eyes said everything that Harry needed to hear. In that moment, he felt accepted, loved, and
Draco stalked around him, tracing a finger over Harry’s chest as he went, the touch igniting a fire across Harry’s skin.
Behind him, Harry could feel a growing heat pressing against his arse. The pressure alone had his toes curling in his shoes.
Harry actually had the gall to laugh, his eyebrows shooting up in surprise, wondering if this was some sort of joke,  “Excuse me?”
“Because there’s people around.”
When Harry opened his eyes, Draco’s gaze did not meet his own. Instead, Harry watched as Draco’s eyes dragged slowly over his body, pupils dark and eyelids heavy, examining the masterpiece he had created with a quiet hunger. Harry shivered involuntarily, the gaze like a feather being dragged softly across his skin.
Draco nearly smacked Potter across the face for being such an imbecile, “You came all the way to my house simply so that we could have a bit of storytime?!”
Harry’s breathing came out shallow as he considered Draco’s words, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.
As they kissed, it felt as though the equilibrium of Draco’s entire system had been disrupted, the floor shifting beneath his feet, his center of balance becoming inextricably linked to Harry - regardless of where they were in space.
As the bloke handed Harry the absurd contraptions, he spoke, “Did you one of you mention Goblins? I have a
Then Draco raised an expectant, perfectly-manicured eyebrow, tilting his cock forward toward Harry,
Each time Harry came to, he could feel himself getting closer, his cock now fully hard, pressed hot and leaking against his belly, although Draco had long abandoned it, instead focusing all of his toe-curling talents on Harry’s arse.
Harry took the bottle, but didn’t take a drink right away. “I like long stories,” he said curiously, his breath warm on Draco’s neck.
He couldn’t resist indulging himself, reaching down to rub over the ever-growing outline of his cock and sighing at the tingles of pleasure it sent pulsing throughout his body. Harry hummed, letting his eyes fall lazily shut as he continued to rub himself through his trousers.
please!”
“Gonna kill Longbottom next time I see that git - ” Draco grumbled to himself as he stepped over the roots bursting through his previously spotless tiled floors, as he made his way over to the kettle, “Definitely gonna kill him. And then I’ll buy him any fucking plant he wants…” He reached around a branch to fill the kettle up with water and dodged a cluster of flowers as he lit the flame, “Bloody brilliant arsehole.”
Just as Harry was about to apologize, Draco continued, “Lucky for you, I only have one meeting this afternoon and it can be easily rescheduled. So, we can start now.”
Although Harry was the ‘Daddy,’ it was clear that Draco was in charge. And Harry wouldn’t have wanted it any other way.
“...He killed you?!” Draco inquired, half convinced that Potter was going mad.
Harry simply sat back on his knees and watched, admiring every inch of Draco’s body unashamedly, letting his gaze pause over the swell of Draco’s cock and the milky white skin of his thighs - which Harry would love nothing more than to mark up.
Draco pushed in closer to Harry, his hips pressing against Harry’s own and leaving nothing to the imagination - his cock already half-hard and pressing against the seam of his trousers.
Harry tried to nod but Draco’s strong grip made it nearly impossible, so he choked out a breathless answer instead, “
Harry lay in bed, one hand wrapped tightly around his throbbing prick, the other pumping two fingers rhythmically in and out of his tight arse. Even the thought of those instructions had his cock leaking precome onto his stomach, his hole clenching reflexively around his fingers.
As they kissed, it was as though Harry was hearing the music in slow motion. Everything became a bit softer, slower, though it was no less intense. It allowed Harry to focus in on the pleasure that was thrumming inside of him. He was being pleasured by Draco as much as he was by the music. Waves of ecstasy rolled through his body and he felt his cock hardening in his denims.
Harry licked his lips and glanced around, settling himself down onto a charcoal-grey loveseat, the cushions surprisingly plush.
As Harry drifted off to sleep, sated and grateful, he couldn’t help but wonder just how often Draco did this, and whether he would be willing to show Harry this soft, vulnerable side of himself when they were both fully awake.
A flush spread over Harry’s cheeks as he suddenly realized just how intimately Draco was about to get to know him. “Well, it’s my first time with a professional Dom. I’ve done scenes with a few boyfriends, and I tried finding a Dom at a local BDSM club, but I - ” Harry ran a hand through his hair, avoiding Draco’s gaze, “- I just wanted something more. I wasn’t getting what I needed. And I wanted to experiment with someone more neutral, someone I could trust.”
A moan fell from Harry’s lips before he could stop it, but he played it off as a sleep-induced noise, smacking his lips and shifting on the bed, letting his knees fall open and inviting Draco in even further.
As more and more people poured into the Burrow - the noise level increasing like a
Harry’s hand began to tremble as his orgasm built inside of him, tugging low in the pit of his stomach.
Almost.
. He wanted to know each step along the way, to follow each instruction without question, to be at the mercy of someone else's decision making.
The sight that greeted Harry had his mouth going dry, even as Draco’s became wet.
“You do realize this is not normal, right?” Harry inquired, stepping gingerly over some roots before perching himself up on the kitchen island, surveying the kitchen with a crooked smile and a laugh still etched on his features.
Draco blinked a few times in confusion before settling down on the floor beside Harry and stealing the coconut curry out of his hands.
After the War, Harry and Draco began dating, and two years later they got married - with one ceremony held in Godric’s Hollow and the other held at a garden that Draco used to visit as a child.
“There’s
“Make yourself at home, why don’t you,” Draco muttered under his breath as he slammed his front door shut.
Suddenly the pompous voice registered in Harry’s brain and he whirled around, searching for the man in question.
and he was left all alone.
And in that moment, right before he pushed the tip of his finger inside, Harry couldn’t help but think,
"Please who?"
“Piss off, Draco,” Harry smiled and pulled Draco in for a deep, toe-curling kiss. Draco’s own arms gradually made their way up until they were resting on Harry’s shoulders, his fingers playing with the hair at the base of his neck as they kissed and kissed and
“Uh… I can - I just,” Harry began, not even sure how to defend himself or what to say.
Harry massaged the plump flesh of Draco’s arse for a second, before prying his cheeks apart and looking down at his hole - pink and furled and perfect.
However, after that night, Draco hadn’t brought it back up and Harry had assumed that it was Draco’s way of communicating that he was not into the idea after all.
Harry swallowed and pushed himself up off the green velvet couch he had been sitting on, walking past the woman and toward a set of double doors situated at the end of a long hallway.
Draco felt a shiver cascade through Harry’s entire body.
“Did you say something?” Harry asked, just wanting to ensure he had heard the comment correctly.
The words echoed ominously in Harry’s mind like a warning, a last-stitch effort to pull his heart off the ledge.
Draco’s professional shell appeared to crack, just for brief second, but then a neutral expression returned. “Very well then, Potter. I require all of my subs to engage in a test scene before we sign the contracts. Would you like to schedule an appointment for the scene?”
He sighed as the sheets shifted down his body, the sensation only registering at the softened edges of his consciousness, his eyes still closed, his mind hovering somewhere between sleep and wake.
And that’s how Harry and Draco ended up having sex on the roof of a Muggle arcade.
Harry glasses fogged up and his cock twitched as Draco slipped his palm lower, lifting up the hem of his shirt so that his abdomen was exposed to the crowd.
Harry grit his teeth, “Because I asked you to.”
A Prophecy had determined his future as a leader. A future of being looked to whenever a decision was to be made. A future of being in charge.
It was not enough and yet it was too much. Draco’s body felt just as spent as though they had been fucking for hours.
Memories flooded back all in a rush as Draco blearily blinked down at Harry, his face slack with sleep and his scar just peaking through his mess of black hair as he snored softly. It was oddly charming in a way that only Harry could manage.
And he felt it
he couldn’t get enough.
Nodding and smiling politely to anyone who glanced in his direction, Harry slowly walked backwards until his heel made contact with the base of the staircase. Then, without a look back, Harry bolted up the stairs and looked for an empty room to hide out in.
important is that your mother was tasked with checking to ensure that I had died. But when she walked over to my body, she paused and… she asked if you were still alive.”
They had spent the remainder of the evening having a rather professional discussion on the matter, Draco asking Harry question after question, though no judgement seeped into his tone and no malice or mockery shone in his gaze.
Harry weaved his way through the crowds of men until he arrived at the bar. He ordered himself a shot of Firewhiskey and down it in one gulp - the burning sensation jolting his system as a fiery heat spread to his fingertips.
They ended up talking for nearly two hours. Topics jumping all over, from an argument about the best Thai restaurant in London, to the weirdest thing they ever saw at Hogwarts, to the candidates running for Minister of Magic.
Letting out a sigh, Harry stepped out of the loo and attempted to fix his hair in the mirror. When it seemed as though his mop of black hair simple wasn’t going to cooperate, he headed back out into the club.
The cut was warm at first, but it became hotter as blood rushed to the surface.
A hand came up to pet soothingly over Harry’s belly, coaxing his body to shift until even more of his arse was exposed to Draco.
Spots of light appeared behind his eyelids as blurred images flashed through his mind: heated gazes locked from across a crowded club, electricity sparking at each innocent brush of fingers, hestitant hands on hips and arses, followed by hands filled with more confidence and possession, dancing until Harry’s head had spun, lips colliding as the hotel room door shut behind them, bodies falling, entangled and writhing on the bed, gasps of ecstasy, and streaks of come painting across their bodies.
This was a form of ecstasy that he had never experienced. His body felt on edge, over-sensitive,
To the surprise of no one - except Harry himself - he decided to hang on to that sliver of hope, as miniscule as it was, and he headed inside the club.
Harry reveled in Draco’s gasp, in the uninhibited way with which Draco’s head tipped back onto his shoulder, lips parting in a moan, as though he momentarily forgot where he was.
“Hi...Daddy.”
Harry couldn’t remember the last time he felt so connected, so grounded, so in sync. His heart stuttered as he took in a deep breath.
Harry bit back a moan as he watched as if in slow motion as Draco stroked lightly over his cock, coaxing out the last few drops, a thumb caressing his balls lightly.
Once Harry was inside, his senses quickly became overwhelmed. His nose filled with the sharp sting of alcohol and the unmistakable scent of sex; his eyes were overwhelmed by the flashing lights and bright colors; his body overwhelmed by the steep uptick in temperature - by the sticky, wet heat that coated his skin; his ears were overwhelmed by the persistent thumping of the music as it blasted through the crowd, each beat reverberating in his brain.
But now that Draco had been housing the plant for a few weeks, he was beginning to regret it. No matter what magic Draco used or how much water he poured on it, the plant never seemed to grow. Yet, it wasn’t dying either. It was remaining annoyingly alive and Draco had half a mind to chuck the damned thing out the window.
Then Draco’s hips jerked, his cock slamming back inside and Harry cried out, tears prickling the corners of his eyes, though he was unsure whether it was from the intense pleasure that bloomed as Draco’s cock hit his prostate like a well-timed jinx, or if it was from the contrast of such euphoria with the harsh echo of Draco’s words.
After a while, Harry noticed that Draco’s cock was not growing as quickly as it typically would. So, Harry paused, let Draco’s cock fall from his lips with a wet
Harry pulled back for a moment and lapped at the slit, tasting the precome that was forming there.
Harry stumbled, trying to simultaneously get his footing and calm his rapidly beating heart.
The sensation and the thought both had Draco groaning.
“And why would I do that?” Draco asked, his tone casual and nonchalant, as if he was simply asking Harry why he preferred Pumpkin Pasties over Treacle Tart.
Harry opened his eyes and attempted to hide his growing erection. And because the universe had a truly fucked up sense of humor, Harry’s gaze was met by the wide-eyed stare of Draco Malfoy, a mixture of confusion, disgust, and something that curiously resembled desire swirling in his grey eyes.
, Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had ever been so turned on. His cock was leaking in excess against his ratty denims, the length pulsing uncomfortably as it sought more friction, more touch, more of anything.
Harry let out a pained noise above him, but from the trickle of precome now running across his tongue, Draco knew that the only pain Harry was experiencing was from pleasure.
set in the back if you wanna play?,” and Merlin, the kid looked hopeful all of the sudden and Draco was so very confused.
“Old stuff, mainly,” Draco said, after a while. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Harry’s fingers paused for the briefest of moments, before he continued removing Draco’s other boot.
Harry’s vision was blurred from pleasure and tears, and he felt drunk as he reached down, intending to touch himself, his orgasm so close to the edge…
Harry’s mind began whirring, his thoughts flying around haphazardly, images from their days at Hogwarts flashing in and out of his view as he considered Draco’s question.
“Any hard limits?”
Draco hummed above him and placed both hands on Harry’s cheeks, leaning down and pressing a chaste, almost inexperienced kiss to his lips. Then he pulled back, hands resting on the nape of Harry’s neck, fingers dancing over his skin, “How was that?”
“I can’t quite tell if you’re more excited about the reward or the punishment,” Draco commented, a smirk on his lips.
Their first kiss.
It was all Hermione's fault.
Harry arched his back as he milked his own prostate, the pleasure akin to a thousand orgasms happening simultaneously, his body vibrating from the intensity.
“Shut it, Malfoy,” Harry growled, and then he was pushing Draco roughly back against the bed, straddling his hips and pressing his thin wrists into the mattress, “I’ll show you stamina.”
“Yes, but that’s not important. What
Harry appeared to be feeling the same way if his heavy eyelids and slowed movements were any indication.
As the music began to build, Draco turned around fully, facing the crowd as he mouthed the words of the song, a passion in his movements that Harry had never quite seen before.
It was a Sunday evening and the pair of them had spent the day running errands, trying out a new recipe for Shepherd's pie that Neville had shared with them, and catching up on work before a new week began.
The man laughed and Harry could sense him rolling his eyes without needing to see his face. And with that, a kiss was pressed to his neck and the hands snaked their way tighter around Harry’s body.
His hand gave a soft squeeze at the base of my cock before I was left, hips trembling and body starved for his touch. When I groaned, Harry paused. And I felt both of his hands slide up and down my waist for a brief moment before they settled over top of my wrists, bound together at the base of my back.
And then it happened.
“Because there’s…” Harry’s eyes fluttered shut for a moment, “there’s
But then, Draco was tossing the pillow lightly onto the bed and crawling across the sheets, pressing a hand on Harry’s chest until he leaned back.
Harry considered the question, worrying his bottom lip between his teeth before he shrugged, a nervous laugh spilling out of him, “Don’t kill me? That’s probably about it.”
It only took a few more thrusts before Harry was coming - ribbons of milky-white come lining Draco’s tongue and the inside of his cheeks.
“Potter, look at me.”
Harry straightened up from where he was rummaging in his dresser and turned toward the bed in confusion, sure that he was imagining things.
“More or less?” Harry asked, and this time I could feel the heat emanating from him, I could feel the hot press of his cock against the exposed crease of my arse.
Harry swallowed every last drop that Draco gave him, suckling on the head as he finally pulled off, even though Draco shivered below him, his cock over-sensitive as it pulled out.
That just made Draco smile - if anything, the public nature of their escapades was all the more motivation for him to continue.
Harry may have beat him at those Muggle games, but Draco wasn’t about to let him win at everything tonight.
Draco ground his hips insistently against Harry’s as they moved together in a sort of dance.
As a new verse began, Harry suddenly noticed that all eyes in the crowd were on him. And when he looked up, Draco was standing directly above him, a fire in his eyes.
Draco turned away from him and began dancing against the wall behind the stage, moving lower and lower until he was down on his own knees, his back to Harry.
Suddenly Harry felt hands settle on his hips, a line of heat forming along his back as a silky smooth voice whispered in his ear, “Trying to run away from me, Potter?”
“No, it’s not like that. I was… I was lying on the ground, I had just woken up after You-Know-Who killed me and - ”
As Harry was heading out, he pointed over to the kitchen window, “Nice plant.”
Leaning back on his hands, Draco increased the pressure, moving his heel rhythmically against the growing bulge in Harry’s trousers. It was invigorating feeling the heat of Harry’s cock begin to seep through the layers of material. It was even more invigorating knowing that he was the one causing Harry’s cock to swell, to heat, to
It took Harry a moment to process, but then he stood up and walked over to Draco on shaky legs, his gait awkward as he attempted to maneuver around his ever-throbbing cock. As Harry stood in the doorway, he paused, looking at Draco and mouthing dumbly, so many words on the tip of his tongue, though none were quite coming out.
“I’m sorry.”
They were a bit of sugar and a
He grinned up at Draco, “Considering how much you seemed to enjoy yourself, I would guess that you could die happily right now.”
Hermione at least had the decency to avoid eye contact, but Harry could see a smile forming at the corners of her lips as she sipped her tea.
But no matter what Draco tried, the plant just continued to die.
“Alleyway.”
“Good.” Draco looked down at Harry with pride and lust. “You can stop now. I’m ready… if you want this.”
Harry allowed his head to be guided into place, his eyes fluttering shut as Draco began leaning down as if to kiss him, but then a stream of beer was being released straight down his throat, Draco transferring it from his lips to Harry’s.
When he finished unlacing Draco’s boot on one side, Harry settled the foot in his lap and reached for the other.
“I know you used it; no night could have been like
Draco felt, more than heard, when Harry first saw it because suddenly Harry’s body was shaking with laughter behind him.
“What the bloody hell do
Even from the back, there was no mistaking that this man was Draco Malfoy. From his slim figure to the mile-long limbs and the sensual curves that his body created as he moved, beginning to sway as music played over the speakers.
- it’s been a while since anyone’s taken the time to suck my nipples.”
No more than a minute later, Harry found his skin growing warm, and pleasurably so. His cock began to fill slowly in his trousers, a familiar heat pooling in the pit of his stomach.
Bloody. Fucking.
His mind protested but his heart won the battle, and Harry allowed his eyes to open, blinking through the wetness that clung to his eyelashes as his vision adjusted to the low lighting of the room.
Letting his gaze wander to Draco’s cock - now growing soft as it lay against Draco’s thigh, the crown still wet from Harry’s lips - Harry chose his words carefully, “To be honest, Sir… No. I don’t think I have the restraint to wait. If you send me home - well, I - I don’t think I will be able to stop myself. It might happen even if I don’t… you know… touch myself.”
But there Draco was, reading glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, a book clutched in his hands, staring at Harry with a…. Well, what kind of facial expression was that, really? Distressed? Guilty? Sad? Unsure? It was a multitude of emotions.
Harry could only nod dumbly, unsure that he was even capable of coherent speech, his cock already filling out in his trousers and his pulse jumping as he watched Draco’s slim hips sway slowly up the staircase, the threadbare briefs shifting so that the curve of Draco’s arsecheek was exposed, the sight making Harry’s mouth water, his arse looking plump enough to bite.
Draco threw his hands up with as much sass and exasperation as though Harry had just asked him to recite
Draco got the message loud and clear, and he pulled down Harry’s own briefs until his cock popped out, slapping down onto his bare abdomen with an audible ‘thwack.’
And that was how Draco ended up having weekly (and sometimes even more frequent) dinners with Harry
as he got up from the couch, eyes glinting as he spoke once more, “You look like you’ve had a hard day. Maybe I can help you relax?”
- boy-who-lived, you’re gonna have to get more specific.”
As Draco’s prick began to leak against the material of his trousers, Harry parted his lips and moved to mouth wetly over the crown. But as soon as Harry’s lips surrounded the head, Harry felt a sharp sting of pain shooting through his body, a hand now gripping his hair with painful force.
Draco gave his cock a few leisurely strokes, licking his lips as he looked down at Harry, the movements of his wrist so graceful and erotic.
There was a long pause, and then Draco spoke, “....So no Felix Felicis, then?”
Before Harry could process what was happening, Draco had reached for the front of his shirt, fisting the material in his hand and dragging him up onto the stage.
The floors were covered in a stunning white marble with streaks of grey and silver. There was a firepit floating delicately in the center of the room, the flames dancing so sensually that it was almost intimidating.
For the first time since Harry was a teenager, he felt as though he was about to come in his pants. And for the first time ever, Harry could not care less.
Draco shrugged, “I suppose so. It didn’t exactly come with an instruction manual. But by the way it’s reacted to us, I gather that if we continue…
My words fell out shakily, my body practically vibrating with need, “M-more.”
“Right. Okay. Well, I brought food, so you better get your arse over here and eat it. I didn’t go all the way to Pentrenelli’s for nothing.”
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. “Y-You went all the way there, just for me?” Pentrenelli’s was his favorite restaurant. It was something he had mentioned to Harry weeks ago.
Harry felt his eyes flutter shut as Draco suckled on his nipple, pulling the little nub of flesh taut, his cheeks hollowing. Draco had played with his nipples before, but this... this was so much more than that.
