Greyback pulled back, rolling his tongue in his mouth as he tasted the blood Draco had spilt.
"Ah…well," no great excuses came to mind, so, Draco lied. "I like her."
Severus's hand blocked his way, he loomed over the doorway, his arm across the opening. Draco stopped, stepping back in shock. Severus didn’t say anything has he leveled his glare on Draco, who couldn't bring himself to speak. Silence encompassed the claustrophobic storage closet as every set of eyes settled on them and their odd behavior.
"See me after class, Malfoy," Severus stated simply, his hand disappearing from Draco's shoulder.
"And dangerous," Potter stated.
My hopes are with you now and always,
"You are very bad at breaking the rules," Draco corrected.
Draco shrugged, "It's not that hard."
Draco dismissed himself to his favorite class; History of Magic. Pansy was already in their regular shared desk at the back of the class near the door.
The door was smooth and cold against his hand, warning him of the dangers within it. Draco cracked the door open slightly so he could glance into the room.
The business of the Great Hall distracted Draco from his lack of sleep. The tiredness that now pressed into the back of his skull. He had to make sure to get some sleep tonight, he had to be prepared to help Potter. He had to be prepared to put their plan in action.
"Asshole doesn’t have any consideration for the rest of us," Theo bit.
Draco opened the note. It was on the same piece of parchment they had used to pass messages to each other. Now, there was an unflattering drawing of Draco sleeping on his desk. Draco hoped Potter was going to choose a different career direction. In the picture, Draco was drooling and snoring in his sleep. A very inaccurate description. The only reason he suspected the drawing was of himself and not, say, Weasley, was the title of the artful rendition:
Potter was mad at him, but why? What did Draco do? "What did I do?" Draco asked, his voice shaking.
"Your doom mates are certainly friendly," Montague called after him, "is that where you go every night?"
"I don’t need you to protect me," she defended.
Draco's hand found Ron's ear, his grip tight as he twisted it as his mother used to. Ron's face twisted in the sensation, both of his hands on Draco's wrist, trying to break Draco's grasp. Draco used Ron's momentum and lack of balance to yank him off of Draco's chest by the ear. Ron went to the ground, Draco still had his grip on his ear, twisting painfully. Draco released him, only to be pulled off of Ron by two strong arms on his chest.
"If I had picked Slytherin, do you think we would have been friends?" he explained.
"More like our resident dumbass," Daphne corrected, not looking up from her copy of the Daily Profit.
Draco opened the library doors, the hall was dark despite the noon sun shining through the windows, as the heavy curtains had not been pulled apart. He shut the door behind him quietly. He made his way down the still, dark hallway hurrying quickly to the light at the end of the dark.
Claws at Draco's back, a snake tightening around his lungs.
Blaise hadn't really meant the comment, but Draco could feel the meaning deep within him. He laughed at the joke for appearances, but the laughter felt forced even to him.
"Oh, that," Potter rolled his eyes, "why would I be upset over a joke?"
"With your permission of course," Goyle covered for his mate, his eyes wide in barley covered panic.
"That's your number two?"
"Students need the knowledge you're teaching them," Draco answered with practiced ease.
Mr. Greengrass stared at the floor, his eyes wide and his breath shallow. Daphne's mother started to bawl into her handkerchief. Her husband reached other, taking her hand. Their eyes met, Draco felt conflicted at witnessing such a tender moment between them. They were willing to lay down their lives for their child, finding tranquility in the knowledge of their child living.
"Shit, I'm sorry," he said. Mafalda paused, frowning. "That's a shit name," he clarified with a grin.
The window opened, Daphne narrowly missed the pebble that Draco had already thrown. He shrugged at her raised eyebrows.
'Meet me tonight?' the note said.
Crabbe was sitting on the floor with his head between his knees. Goyle had Astoria in an impressive head lock, but he was bleeding as Astoria was biting down with all of her tiny might. Pansy and Daphne were rolling on the floor, both covered in food.
Draco let his hand slip into Potter's hair. "Getting familiar now, are we?" he teased.
Draco swallowed, the outline of Daphne melted away to revealed the large body of a man smoking in the light of the open door. "It's Malfoy," he called out with a steady voice. He stepped into the light, finally able to see the face of the man.
Draco was grateful for the lack of other Slytherin students in this class, the other Slytherin students that were in the class kept to themselves, which, at times like these, made Draco grateful for the quite moment. Draco took notice of the charm being reviewed for O.W.Ls, a simple ignition charm they learned in first year. A cauldron containing a small bundle of easily flammable dried grass was on Draco's desk in the back. Draco began to hurriedly take out his notes for the class, trying to appear productive.
She didn't get the chance. Draco's mother gently interrupted, "If you'll excuse us, we have yet to pay our condolences to the grieving couple."
Parkinson sat next to Nott, directly across from Draco. She wasn't touching the food on her plate, simply staring into nothing, as if trying to slip into nothingness herself. Draco tried to catch her eye, but Pansy stayed still, almost looking through Draco. Draco reached out, he touch her translucent hand to bring her attention forward. "Try the lamb, it's your favorite," Draco urged. Pansy followed Draco's request wordlessly, not even bothering to put up the effort to reply.
"That's, uh, that's too bad."
"Me too," Draco agreed. Potter stilled next to him. Draco glanced over his shoulder, Potter was swallowing past his tears that had begun to corner in his eyes. So much grief weighing on such frail shoulders. "It wasn't your fault," Draco comforted. "Daphne, she knew what she was doing. She knew of the dangers."
His mind was static. His head was under water.
Draco would have to be more careful with Potter. If Potter asked, Draco suspected he would follow Potter to hell with his heart in his hand. Merlin, he was so fucked.
He should stop. He didn't want to do this. Yet the presence of his Lord kept him in check.
"What is it?"
A hand ruffled his hair. "You're cute with your hair like that," Potter flattered to Draco's blushing.
"You and I both know that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better," Blaise steadied Theo with a glare.
"Ouch," Blaise winced.
"Who managed to seduce the great Harry Potter?" Draco teased.
"No way, she's to posh for that," Potter argued, his eyes wrinkling in mirth.
"Thank you, Daphne, always a help," Draco droned. He wasn’t in the mood for her.
Potter smiled at him as he left. Draco made himself smile back.
Draco stayed where he was, he should stop this, but he couldn't move.
The two of them walk in comfortable silence, before they get to the Great Hall the girl tried to give Draco back his handkerchief, "don't worry about it, I have more," was his reply.
A tongue licked his cheek, nails along his neck.
He missed Daphne.
His father didn’t look at him as he followed his wife out.
People were starting to notice. Severus had been unusually caring during their tea yesterday. His godfather had never been a particularly warm person, but he did allow Draco to use his lab unrestricted. This allowed him to finish Potter's request. Twenty healing salves had found their home in Draco's trunk, but he had no way to give them to Potter. He had been avoiding Draco yesterday.
Shit. This wasn't how Potter was supposed to find out. "Our Lord may wish to continue my education with private lessons," Draco explained Pansy's gossip.
The burial wasn't for another half hour. Appearances had to be completed. Draco made his way through his peers. The former members of the DA all twisted their faces at him, but said nothing out of respect for the dead. He kept his head high but his gaze low. He didn’t know what he would do if he had to confront one of his peers that had seen him spill blood. Thankfully, everyone gave him a wide distance. The Slytherins wouldn't come near him in fear of the stranger that had replaced their fellow student.
"How are Occlumency lessons?"
Daphne motioned him over with a relaxed grin. Draco took his seat across for the tight pair sitting next to each other. "Good morning, Pansy, Daphne," he greeted, pouring himself an early cup of tea.
The information snapped into place with startling clarity. "Of course," he agreed.
Severus steadied him with a tired gaze. Draco rose from his stood, his thighs sore from sitting. He walked to Severus, lowering his voice so that Potter wouldn't hear. Severus never liked to be challenged publicly. "He's not going to make any progress, you've done what you can-"
“Thank you Professor,” Draco nodded, pulling out his textbook and parchment to take notes.
Daphne, however, noticed Draco pointedly not missing a certain scar head, and teased him all throughout breakfast.
Potter smiled at him when he entered the tunnel. His wand lighting his face in a warm glow.
This was not part of the plan.
Snape stared at Draco. Draco stared at Snape.
"Why am I not surprised?" the girl replied drily. .
Potter nodded, his smile still not meeting his eyes.
He would have to ignore the bit where she would kill him if she had the chance, but the list of people who wanted him dead was going, so what was one more name?
Follow me @carpebellum on tumblr :)
Draco should wait for him, he wanted to see him. Make sure Potter was okay, that he wasn't angry at the outcome of their foolish game.
What would he do? What could he do? Every option he had, every corner he turned, was filled with danger that threatened his life.
This revelation made Draco feel dirty to the core. Simply having thoughts against his family, his Lord, was a betrayal worthy of death. A cold grip in his ribs brought tears to his eyes.
"How'd you like Professor Hagrid's class today?" Draco tried to start conversation between them.
"Yes, Parkinson?" he asked innocently, using his large green eyes to his advantage.
"Draco is a decent guy, he would treat you well, Daphne. Mother and Father wouldn't agree to this if he wasn't honorable," a gentle voice soothed. His stomach dropped, he shouldn't be here, this was private. He didn't move, information was key.
“You already did,” Draco said with a smile.
Pansy held his gaze. She was pissed.
"No!" he bellowed, blushing. Pansy smiled, her eyes warm. Daphne's nose shot out milk because she was laughing so hard.
He shut his mouth. The time spent in the manor had taught him well. He knew when he was being manipulated. "You don't actually worry about my safety," Draco met their questioning. "Why do you care? Really. We all know I can take care of myself just fine."
The whispered spells were the only warning he got.
"No, I don't think so, at least," Potter explained.
"No, Malfoy, I owe you this. You…you surprise me. That's all. This…us, I'm not used to this. I'm just waiting for something to happen and for you to go back to hating me again. Because it feels as if almost everyone is against me, but you're here and you don't hate me…this is a weird situation," Potter explained.
"Hey," she croaked, her face blotchy.
He took a seat in the middle of the couch, letting his muscles relax by the warmth of the fire. He laid his cloak along the back of the couch, putting his bag on the side table beside the couch. How long should he wait for Potter? They didn't say they would meet tonight, but Draco just wanted to be sure.
"You have your work cut out for you," Daphne noted.
Sirius sighed, "He can, if you suit his needs."
The sound of his fist on Finnigan's face dulled, only the sound of Draco heart remained in his ears. Draco's hands were numb in pain, Finnigan looked up at him, bleeding from his crooked nose and split lip.
"You don't think of anything," was Draco's response.
"Draco," Potter had prompted himself up on his elbows, looking over at Draco with one eyebrow raised.
Draco sighed, resting his head in his hands. "I'm…not really in the mood to talk right now, Potter. Just go," he called out, he voice clear despite the shaking in his chest. .
Draco turned his head away from the kiss.
Children's screams, not truly able to understand what was happening as the Dark Lord raised his wand.
"Draco, darling, we all know that if Potter took out his co-"
Her mother hanging by her neck, her eyes lifeless and large, seeing nothing-
"If Potter took out his broomstick, you'd be the first on your knees," Pansy joked. Daphne laid her head down on the table, her shoulders shaking in joy at Draco's expense.
"Your girlfriend just died and you're just acting like nothing happened," she pushed. Draco stilled, his anger a hot rod in his chest. He shoved passed her. She let him, but she was right on his heels. "Your girlfriend was just murdered and you're sitting here acting like nothing happened-"
Potter was everything Draco wasn't. He was brave. He had seemingly meaningful relationships with his friends. He had more confidence in his pinky figure than Draco had in his entire body. This is why, Draco supposed, Potter had turned down the title of Prefect. Why would he need another title? "The boy Who Lived, Who was also a Prefect?" No. Potter didn't need more validation than defeating the Dark Lord as a child. While Draco's own accomplishments were few and far in between, Potter added another accomplishment to his already filled resume every year. Which is probably the reason why Potter turn down being a Prefect, not worth his effort or time. Bastard. Setting boundaries. Draco was probably mostly jealous of Potter's abilities to turn down titles. Jackass.
Potter faced him with a smile, "Hey sleepy," his body turned to face Draco. "Do you get any sleep at night? You're always asleep in class," he teased.
"This information, Draco, is invaluable. Severus wasn't able to extract this detail of movements," Dumbledore attempted to compliment.
"I'm not saying anything," Draco shrugged, his eyes to the ceiling, a sly smile on his lips, "just that he might be disappointed that he wasn't promised a wife over the winter break."
"Daphne! Please," Astoria begged.
"That's enough," Draco interrupted, "none of us can risk being overheard."
He would finally meet his Aunt.
This continued until they had no more books or papers left, then they moved on to pillows and cushions from around the common room, then collected from the dorms as other study groups started to provide their assistance. Hushed giggles filled the room as more people took notice and began to participate. Theo was soon lost in an artful stack of books, notebooks, paper, pillows and a couple of shoes provided by other students.
Greyback reached at to touch Draco's chin.
"Goodnight, Potter," Draco nodded.
"The Dark Lord won't let up just because you're tired, Potter. I know I don't have to explain that to you."
"Why do you- oh, never mind," Potter stopped.
"What? You know I'm right. Zabini was always around Bulstrode and Greenglass, horrid blood-traitors."
“Ok, see you then,” Potter agreed, walking backwards as awkward as humanly possible to the exit.
"Easier said than done," Potter grinned.
Firenze looked up from the circle of ash. His smile didn’t reach his eyes, but Draco didn't think anyone else could tell. "This is the perfect time for me to show you how to relight Omen Fire." Firenze continued the lecture. Daphne stepped back, Draco gently reached out to her, touching her elbow. Daphne nodded at him, a small smile on her lips.
"Well, Professor, I hate to admit but I wasn't really paying attention in class today," Draco cooled.
He turned at movement from his right. His heart in his throat. But nothing. No one was there.
Draco smiled, "It was the talk of the school, don't you know you're everyone's favorite subject?"
Owls flew into the Hall, the morning light shining in behind them as they gave the messages they were carrying. Potter's owl circled where he normally sits, but eventually left. Potter wasn't in breakfast yet, which was unusual.
Dumbledore took the seat next to the bed as he left the lemon cake on Draco's tray. "Malfoy, I hope you can understand why we are concerned."
"Ah, Severus, how lovely for you to join us," their Lord greeted Draco's godfather. Severus stepped into the light. His eyes wide as he took in Draco's appearance. The blood on him. The sight of him in the blood of his first kill. "We were just about to return." The Dark Lord walked by Severus casually.
Draco ignored the sights of a family being murdered, the screams echoing within his skull, the blood on his hands. He wrapped and healed Potter's hand as well as he could, but there will be a scar.
Daphne let go of Pansy, only to be hit over the head with an empty bowl of stew. Draco flinched in sympathy.
"I don't need to remind you that appearances are necessary," Lucius hissed, his hand dig into Draco's already sore shoulder.
Potter wasn't looking at him when Draco finally gathered the courage to face him. As Draco continued to look at Potter, trying to remember the sweet calm before the storm, Potter only sighed. "Your friends are assholes," was his great note of wisdom.
"That he's a horrendous animal?" Mafalda asked.
Draco was dismissed shortly after, as were the other Slytherin students. Not without a firm word of course. The Quidditch team left Umbridge's classroom with the appropriate slump in their shoulders. No one said anything to Draco, which was just as well. The Gryffindors had to write more line than the Slytherins, Potter had been given double the lines than his teammates.
"Will you ask Dumbledore to keep you safe?" Potter held his hand tightly. "I've already asked, but he said you didn't want his help."
Potter looked down at his shoes, "Your father, is he why you don't want to be seen with me?" Potter asked.
"I talked to Professor Dumbledore and we think you should let Snape teach you Occlumency."
It finally clicked for Draco, "Fuck. No."
"What made Weasley finally grow a pair?" Crabbe jostled.
"You bloody wanker," Draco punched him in the arm, his laughter warm in his chest.
He heard the deafening blows, loud assaults against the very walls of the castle. He pushed his legs faster.
"What did you just say?"
Draco blinked, covering his surprise. What would he do? "I would break your nose, Headmaster. For being such a coward."
Dumbledore signed, "That's not what we were implying-"
Mr. and Ms. Greengrass were shoved to the ground by harsh hands. Alecto Carrow snatched Astoria by her long dark hair, preventing her from reaching her parents, as she screamed for them, arms outstretched. Carrow pulled Astoria's hair to ensure she would have no choice but to witness her parent's death.
Draco smiled, "How very Slytherin of you," he played back.
What would Potter think of his engagement?
Severus recommended this book to Draco in person, he probably knew Draco would struggle though the complicated text. "That greasy bastard," he cursed under his breath.
"I thought we were friends, guys, I can't believe you two would do this to me," he repeated.
Draco's heart flutters every time Potter is this close to him.
Instead, her body was a guard of the Manor. Draco couldn't think of anything else to do with the Inferi that was made with Daphne's body.
Draco tried to keep his voice steady against the pounding in his ears. "Daphne? What does she have to do with anything?" he confronted.
Draco's knees gave out with the force Potter pushed him out of his mind. His breath in hungry gasps. Potter was in his hands and knees, shaking.
Potter carefully worked the fabric along Draco's hand. His hands had stopped shaking. "Jealous of your control," was the clarification.
Draco nodded, but couldn't defile the sea of voices with his words.
"Answer me," Severus ordered.
"Um….Hello?" he supplied nervously. This could easily be a joke at his expense.
Draco's stomach was growling by the time Daphne was finished examining useless items. "Hunger," he stated, his head rolling to face in her direction. "Please, mercy, food."
A small metal tin was produced from Potter's bag. "More gold star treatment then," Potter teased without his usual humor. The tin produced sugar cookies of different sizes and shapes.
Draco's chest tightened, "Oh…" what was someone supposed to do in this situation? Draco drew a blank. "Umm…okay," he supplied dumbly.
If only the other houses could see how vulnerable they were. Perhaps Blaise would pull himself out of his depression, perhaps Bulstrode would be less of a target for abuse, perhaps the small, resilient girl could stop being so strong and be a child.
His Lord looked up from his place bent over the corpse. A grin turning into laughter on cruel lips. Laughter echoed from the crowd as their Lord laughed gleefully at Draco's comment. A pale hand laid on Draco's shoulder, guiding him to step over Daphne's body. "Let us talk in private, young Malfoy," his Lord led him to the side exit.
Draco promptly shut out their voices. He wasn't interested in their conversation. The pair walked over to a wall, looking at a picture of Cedric. Cho started to cry. Draco flinched at Potter's attempt at comforting the poor girl.
Draco, for simple good measure, snaps at the younger students to hurry to class. Even the older students stay clear of him, knowing he has the ear of Umbridge and as Prefect, he could hold his own. Draco has been known to cause students to get detention, though, he does his best to avoid putting any student through the horrid abuse Umbridge calls discipline. Draco has never put anyone younger than himself in detention, they are already scared enough as is.  He really only puts Gryffindors into detention, who seem, as a whole, to not approve of Draco's authority. This made Draco more enemies than not. Stupid.
Daphne. Wonderful Daphne. Daphne, who takes legible notes. Daphne, who is capable of talking about subjects other than potions. Daphne, who has ignored Draco since she got into a fight with Pansy.
The blood rushed to Draco's head, he couldn't hear his own thoughts. He couldn't put together what his Lord's words meant. Daphne could, and her eyes glazed over as her mind worked through what those words meant.
He liked the feeling.
Daphne was his friend, yet everything seemed to be tainted by this war. Their friendship would be smothered by the pressure.
The boy sighed, pulling out a large hand full of brightly wrapped, small, round candies. Draco took them, putting them in his robe pocket, "what are they for?" he asked.
"He's here-!"
"Yeah?"
He didn't. Instead, he turned his back to Daphne. Forcing himself to face Potter, who wasn't looking at him, but wasn't talking either. Draco should look literally anywhere but Potter, but he couldn't. Draco followed Potter's glance, his stomach twisting in a way that Draco didn't want to dissect.
Draco broke into a run.
The kick that was supplied by Ron almost caused Draco to bite his tongue.
"I don’t want to be your friend," Astoria stated. "I don't want you to try and make me like you."
"Yeah, I've gotten my nose broken twice. Not including Quidditch," Draco explained.
Sirius snorted through his nose. “I’ll find someone to take me home,” Draco planned. Why would his parents leave him? What sort of unique punishment was this? Fire lit in his stomach as he thought of asking the Greengrass’s fireplace to floo. Were they trying to punish Draco or the family of the daughter he killed?
The smile he gave her was so fake, as was the apology he gave her. He moved to slide in between the tables, facing Daphne.
“Malfoy. Shut. Up.” Potter growled.
"What? No. Why does it matter anyway?" Draco investigated.
"Stop it," Theo growled, not looking up from his textbook. His study style was simply to re-read the chapters until something clicked. Nothing was clicking tonight.
He was placed in a chair. He looked around, he was in the private lavatory of Severus. The widows were shut, the room was dark except for a few blue glowing lanterns. Severus had his back to him as he shut the door.
Pansy turned around toward the back of the class, one hand on her hip.
An easy smile formed on Draco’s lips, “I’m safe now, we don’t have anything to worry about.” Why was it so easy to lie to Potter? He was so quick to keep the truth from him, to shied Potter away from what he was really like.
He rolled off of her. She started to cough instantly. The whip released her and Draco released the spell where Cho was still struggling to breath. She fell to the floor as she took deep breaths of air, she was sobbing.
"…why?" Draco questioned.
"You should probably ask Daphne for advice."
Draco touched his cheek where Potter had kissed him, his chest light as a smile formed on his lips.
The rocks continued to pummel against his body, but he couldn't make himself run away.
Draco's own neck was warming, his chest was fluttering, he started to play with his hands. "That's just because you missed me," he tried to ease this embarrassed energy between them.
Draco couldn't stop laughing at the news.
Draco could admit many things.
"I hate that she lets him treat her like that," Daphne whispered as Pansy blushed at Montague's hand rising on her thigh. Draco kept his head down. Daphne slammed down her book at as Pansy squealed in deafening laughter.
Potter grinned, "Really? Okay then, I'll think about it."
Sirius steadied him with a glare. "I grew up with my brother, if you want information, don't be a coward. Just ask." He saw right through Draco. Draco would blame the headache for being so translucent.
“Ok...let’s see...what is a place that would get you in the most trouble if you were found there?” Draco joked. “Hmm... the Forbidden Forest?”
Draco couldn't. The slam of the door breaking his silence. He stood there, the silence thick on his skin. Tears came shortly, his breath steady, but he couldn’t stop crying. He sat on the couch, his head in his hands, letting his shoulders shake. He curled in onto himself. Feeling the weight of disappointment in his heart.
Nothing happened.
"I'm sorry," Draco went along with the lie Dumbledore had prepared.
"Nothing can come of this," Draco pointed out instead of answering the question Potter knew the answer to. Potter didn't pulled his hand away, only squeezed his hand. Draco flinched, his knuckles were bruised. Potter loosened his grip, running his thumb over his knuckles gently.
"Daphne, about yesterday-" Draco started.
Draco knocked roughly while rolling his eyes before opening the toilet. The stall was empty.
"Back to the lesson today…" Severus continued to lecture.
"Daphne, no! He agreed to let in Mafalda, but she's the exception," he lied with ease, "Daphne, please, it's too-"
She didn't.
Draco entered the lavatory, passing by other students, who paid him no mind. He entered one of the stalls, placing his bookbag on the hook along the stall door. He turned to the toilet, unzipping his pants, stopping when he noticed the bubbles coming from the toilet water.
Draco blushed as he looked down at the menu, pretending to read as he witnessed Potter reaching over to touch Cho's hand, wincing whenever Cho pulled away.
“Then why are you trying to talk about this now?” challenged Potter, following Draco.
"I can't tonight, Professor, I'm actually booked until May, but I can try to squeeze you in before the end of March."
But at what cost? He would sacrifice himself, Draco knew this, but could he sacrifice another to protect his parents? He would do anything… but what were his limits?
"Crucio."
There was a beauty to the Thestrals, they filed into the clearing. It seemed as if they were there to carry Draco away to Death. The one standing right behind him gently noised his chest, Draco laid his hand on their snout. The skin was surprisingly smooth, like worn leather.
He stood, he was done with this place. Daphne followed suit, pausing as he paid. Draco didn't bother with his manners, or his appearance as he let Daphne follow him out of the pink shop.
Astoria shook her head before walking away from the Great Hall. He followed at a distance. She didn't need to get involved in his school trouble, not any more than she was.
You are supposed to gain the trust of Potter, not try to swoon him in the night.
(See the end of the chapter for
His spine tightened as he walked out of the hall, how obvious were they being? Did anyone notice? Draco made his way to the lavatory, everyone else being at breakfast, so they could possibly talk in private. What did Potter want to talk about? To tell Draco that he was wrong, they shouldn't be friendly? Perhaps to tell Draco to just fuck off? Draco knew he disappointed Potter, but could he save this relationship?
Draco watched has Potter left. A blush high on his cheeks that he hoped the darkness hid. He waited a few moments before slipping out himself and making his way to the common room.
“Basically, yeah,” Potter shrugged.
The bodies kept changing, but Draco didn't stop eating. He didn't stop when they begged or cried, or when his teeth continued to fall out. They left their hearts vulnerable, he enjoyed a feast.
"Sorry, Harry," Draco corrected himself, "you must have a luck charm on you or something."
He could turn back. Wait in the street like a Muggle for the danger to pass. He would blend right in, dressed in a simple long sleeve black shirt and jeans. Draco could just press the button. Ride the elevator back up. Get out. Leave. Never turn back.
"I don’t have my wand," he pointed out.
"I would imagine so," Mrs. Zabini stated. Her hand hadn't moved from Draco shoulder. Her gaze held Draco's steadily. She squeezed his shoulder, her lips pinched slightly together. She wanted to tell him something.
"How have you been helping the DA?" Potter wasn't fazed.
Potter and his army.
“Fine,” Potter jabbed at Draco, before squaring his shoulders and moving to his bookbag on the floor. Draco watched dumbly as Potter finished calmly picked up his things, surprised that this actually worked. Potter straightened from his position on the floor, then turned and looked at Draco, who was still staring. Potter nodded and Draco turned away from his cold look and hurried away, his breath quickening. He walked quickly through the bricked halls of the school, late for his next class. He turned the corner and could swear he felt eyes ranking his back as footsteps behind him became loud.
"The chapter summaries he writes out for Pansy," Theo contributed helpfully as he sat unmoving.
Draco forced his jaw to unclench, but the meaning he still carried in his chest. Theo shifted beside him, sending a glare to Blaise who was standing on the opposite side of Draco. Blaise responded with a general shrug, which Theo gave an exaggerated glace toward Draco. Blaise made a vague humming noise in which Theo just sighed loudly at. Draco rolled his eyes, giving them both a glare for their lack of subtilty.
"Legilimens!" Severus cast.
"How? What does that mean?" Draco investigated against the warning in his ribs.
Daphne had been strangely normal despite the circumstances. She did her usual routine throughout lunch. She gossiped with Pansy and the Carrow twins, the only difference was the fact that her younger sister, Astoria, had join them for lunch instead of sitting with her usual crowd.
"Severus," Dumbledore warned in a harsh whisper.
The ghost looked down at him, her toes an inch from the ground as she floated with ease. She was wearing a Hogwarts uniform. She was  about the same age as Alfie, or she looked like she was, anyway. Draco thought back to where he was, what floor he was on. In his need to wrap himself in his terror, he just found the most private room he could. "You're Moaning Myrtle," he concluded.
Draco dived onto the floor as a spell flew over him. He put up a shield charm as he hit the ground. His shoulder shook with the force of the next spell that hit his shield.
Potter's hand in his. They would make it out of here. They would live. Just a few more feet-
He open his eyes, trying to ground himself, to see Potter. He was with his friends, standing in the front of the crowd. Funny how Potter was always where Draco didn't want him. He had his arms crossed against his chest, clearly disapproved. He glanced at Draco, their eyes locked. Potter looked almost disappointed…in him? Draco was taken back to a simple room with simple company; laughter, concerned looks, a relationship in the new.
“What about you?” Potter asked.
They could take the orphans of the Slytherin House, provide them with friendship and support. Potter would allow Slytherin students, wouldn't he? Of course he would, Potter is a much better man than Draco, he wouldn't make judgements on biases, right? Draco could talk him into allowing a few students, none of the purebloods, or those with families attached to Death Eaters, but others.
"No! This is a beyond idiotic situation," Severus snapped, he turned to Draco, "and you're an idiot for being a part of it. Do you know how dangerous this is?"
"No, I did not fall in," Draco hissed.
Draco was pulled to his feet. Potter's hands pulled him up with almost bruising force. "Let's get out of here!" Potter ordered.
"Now?" he asked.
“Malfoy, listen-” Potter followed, to Draco’s growing agitation.
"Occlumency, that's pretty dark stuff Draco," Daphne noted.
Draco just stared at him. Theo innocently ate toast off of Draco's plate. Draco continued to frown, which he was met with Theo's, seemingly innocent, blue eyes.
"My Lord," the air left her body, her voice barely above a whisper.
"I'm so sorry," Draco gasped, trying not to let tears spill.
Draco allowed the silence carry his answer. He was still shaking. His arms felt overused and tired, but he couldn't go back to sleep, not now.
"Has Dumbledore gotten onto about fighting a professor on the first day of school?"
Draco removed the silencing charm. "Fuck off Potter, I'm taking a shit," the sneer in his voice was natural as he called over the stalls.
“Is that a compliment? Are you impressed?” Potter teased. He slowly lowered his weight onto the bench next to Draco, surprised when the piece of furniture stayed intact.

"I'm not saying he didn't, it was just very bold to start the year off by dueling a professor."
Potter smiled back, his warm eyes looking into Draco's. Draco allowed the moment to extend between them, comfortable in the private company.
Draco couldn't risk Severus following him into the supply closet, not if Draco's plan to help Pansy was going to work, so Draco made the burner under the caldron on Snape's desk rise in heat suddenly from his place on the floor. This made the potion on Severus's desk boil over. Severus cursed under his breath, hurrying to his desk to tend to the mess.
"Zabini," he corrected himself, "he's being isolated. Someone needs to reach out."
"You don't have any scars, scars automatically make someone seem mysterious," Draco argued, the banter loosening the tightness in his chest.
The library was dark. Torches supplied the only dim light for reading. O.W.Ls were in a week, so the library was open late. Draco stayed here until curfew. He slept better if he was exhausted. Less time to think before he fell asleep.
Daphne's fight slowly dripped away from her. Her hands grew weak. Her back was wet from her blood that was tight against his chest. Daphne was out of breath. Astoria's screams burned Draco's ears. He held her tight against him. Tears dampened Draco's cheek from Daphne's eyes. He felt her last beats of her heart against his chest, but his own heart was tightly sealed away.
"I will make a list, but don't be too upfront about your stance. Right now, we need to try and find students who can be trusted," he ordered. "You have more flexibility with your social circles, you're popular and not being as closely watch as I am. Keep it subtle, but find out who can be trusted," he concluded.
He tried to pay attention, he really did. Only so much effort could be placed mentally into watching pictures turn in the fire.
"And you're wearing cologne," Potter flirted as he stood next to Draco.
The constant paranoia wasn't something he wasn't used to. If anything, the threat of an attack kept him more focus. He could feel himself slipping back into the person he was over the summer. That version of himself knew how to stay alive, knew how to keep him safe.
"How could you think that? How could I be capable of hurting Pansy?" he defended himself, trying to plant enough doubt for his own behalf.
"Why are they staring at us?" Draco asked Potter.
The sun was dipping in the sky based off of the color of the sunbeams on the shelves. Dinner would be served soon, he should finish up for the day. He started the long task of putting away his books and notes.
"This is the boy's room," he  pointed out as he turned to her and leaned against the sink next to him.
Dumbledore took a sip of his tea, "Congratulations on your promotion."
Draco grabbed Potter by his shoulder to force him into the only seat next to him. The very same seat Draco had just kicked him out of. Potter looked confused, turning to see what would cause such a reaction from Malfoy. Pansy was standing uncomfortably close to Potter.
Draco raised his wand above him, not needing to aim.
Draco puffed out his checks, blowing air out through them. "I've got to go," he said, and dismissed himself with all of his social graces.
"Come on, Potter, we're going to be late for dinner," Draco tried to seem rude.
"Yes? Can I help you?" a high picked voice met Draco.
Draco swallowed, his throat dry. Someone was shaking him. Potter, both hands on his shoulders. "Draco, Draco. Can you hear me?"
Potter slumped onto the bench in front the window with a bit too much force. The bench creaked loudly in protest of the weight.
"Mercy Merlin."
"Your what?"
"What would it matter anyway?" Draco avoided.
Draco pointed his wand, "We have to try."
What sort of father would he be?
"I was just wishing your father a good recovery. I couldn't imagine losing my father at such a young age," Draco lied with ease. If the Weaslet were to hex him where he stood, Draco wouldn't have been surprised.
Daphne steadied him with an icy glare, "Just because Pansy was a bitch to you today doesn't mean you get to take it out on me."
"Yes…" how was he going to explain himself?
So many questions running through his head, he didn't know where to start. Luckily, he was meeting with the source tonight.
"Wait, please-"
Draco held his wand. His mind was surprisingly clear as Potter looked down at the prophecy. He was about to give the order to attack.
"Draco, don't lower yourself to speak with such scum," Lucius interrupted. His chin was high so that he could look down on Professor Lupin. Lupin's hand tightened on his arm, he was protective of his old student. He was under the impression that his father was still his boggart. Draco could only wish that his fears were so mild.
Merlin, she was going to hate him. She always had a temper, but she knew Draco. She knew of his loyalties, his hesitation, she would kill him. She would kill him with her bare hands if she thought he was being careless, how was he supposed to marry her? She agreed with him, the Dark Lord was a disease, but would she risk her family? Her sister, who she cared for deeply? No. Draco supposed she wouldn't.
"Jesus Tonks."
Potter studied his expression, Draco tried his best to give him a reassuring smile. "I can tell when you're lying, you know," Potter pleaded.
"To fight so that I wouldn't have to fight again," Draco told him.
"Fine," he scowled, "what is so unique about the way I won a brawl with another student?"
Draco met Potter's eyes. Potter was meeting him where he was. "Yeah," his voice breathy, "yeah, okay. Thanks, Potter."
"I'm not so easily manipulated Malfoy," she challenged.
Draco blinked. He was sure Crabbe would have been disappointed in the latter. Draco read it beforehand, of course he did, and the letter was simple.
"I know," she stopped him, her eyes bright with wetness. "Have your parents broken the news yet?" she asked.
Cho was breathing heavily when he turned back to her. She was staring at her hand with wide, tearful eyes. She was more surprise than Draco was that she had hit him.
“Hi,” was all he was able to say to explain everything that he couldn’t.
"Well I suppose if you aren't up to a bit of a walk, Professor," Potter chided.
This was war. Draco would burn the world down before he let something happen to Potter.
"But nothing. She had so many people warning her. She knew of the price she would pay if…"
"Now I know you're just lying," Draco was shoving his books in his bag. He wasn't going to bother to put up the books he had taken out.
Draco shrugged, "I'm sure Montague knows better than to cross me again, but he might have someone hit the Beater into my direction."
Don't feel.
Theo stood there, stepping back to separate himself from Blaise. "Not now, Zabini, I'll see you in class," he dismissed, the cracks in his facade showing.
"Talents for being a little shit," Draco complemented.
"Was the fight just about winning?"
He let them try.
Draco allowed himself to touch, to memorize what Potter's arm felt like, his chest, his neck. He cupped Potter's face with both of his hands, holding him.
The spoon clunked in the teacup as Draco froze. "He shouldn't have to do this alone," he dazed.
His declaration sent a harsh sob through Daphne. She hid her face in her hands, her cries loud and unashamed in their fear. For the first time, true pure terror shot down her. Her knees trembled against the force of her impending death.
"Malfoy," Potter greeted with such a gentle voice.
Draco thought back to Pansy's broken body on the cold brick floor. Pansy with her eyes rolled into her head, her mouth foaming with black fluid. Her trust in him. "Yeah… ouch," Draco sighed.
Potter barked in laughter, "Well, you saw how well that went for me."
"You want this," Potter uttered, leaning in so that their foreheads touched.
"I'm…I never meant to put you in this situation," Potter looked so regretful.
Draco had never had his father unable to meet his eyes before. "Keep your hands to yourself," Draco ordered before leaving.
"We really don't have to do count-"
"Gentlemen, can we please get into the fucking carriage? I'm hungry," Draco yelled from the cart.
"You can't tell anyone else," Daphne broke their silence. Draco didn't say anything.
The doors gently closed behind him with a soft ding. The mechanical sound was the only noise as the elevator traveled back to the main floor. Draco stood at the end of the long hall he found himself in.
He ate and ate, yet the heart stayed alive. He wanted to stab the organ, put Daphne out of her mystery, but instead he gorged himself on her life.
Which is why the layer of dust had caught Draco's eye. The house elf had been banned from the library. Not only the house elf, but probably his mother as well. Draco was sure his father didn't even know of a single dusting charm.
He was lucky enough to have just flicked the bud out of the open window when the door slammed opened.
"Well, if it isn't our resident badass," Theo greeted him at dinner.
Draco laid in his bed after everyone had left. Finally realizing that he was truly alone in the world.
"Given that we are talking about him, I believe that this is his concern," Draco insisted, walking to stand by Potter's side.
A house elf was ordered to Apparate Draco to a clear space a few blocks from the station. Apparently, he was old enough to take himself to school. His parents didn't even say goodbye to him.
"I didn't have Ron for Hermione send me copies of the paper over the summer," Potter explained.
"I have to go," Draco pulled away from her, Potter would be waiting.
The hands working on bandaging his stopped. "Is this because I tried to kiss you?" Potter's voice shook. Draco looked up, Potter's eyes were glassy in tears unsplit.
"Explain."
The classroom returned to silence, with only the occasional choked chuckle. Draco had to refrain from stabbing himself in the stomach so he could be excused from class. Severus probably wouldn't let him go.
Potter was a problem solver. Whenever one of his friends were in trouble, he had to fix the problem. Draco needed to give Potter a problem to solve. "Nobody really likes me, Potter. Especially the older students, they think I'm a little shit," he explained.
"What? Just because he hasn't taken to Occlumency, doesn't mean he is stupid," Draco snapped, "he is making amazing progress given the situation."
Draco heard the glass shatter, heard her body hit the floor. Then silence. Draco froze as Pansy didn't move from the crumpled heap at the bottom of the steps. Did he kill her?
"But he has better things to worry about, he doesn't have time for me," Potter dismissed.
Potter's jaw tensed as he looked away from Draco. "How can you be okay with this?" Potter asked.
Draco walked slowly to her, not wanting to scare her. She nodded easily, cooing at the cat Draco had previously named Bentley. Bentley, rubbed up against Draco's leg as he tried to pass. "Horrendous animal," Draco bent down to pet the cat. With this angle, he could see the bruise on her cheek.
Blaise snorted, rubbing his forehead. Theo still wouldn't look at him.
"Is there something you would like to add?" Pansy retorted to Daphne.
"Oh, yeah, I know," Potter said.
Draco turned to him. A painfully fake smile on his lips, "Why? I'm happy for you Potter," he forced.
“Do I, though?” Blaise asked, the meaning clear.
Draco let his anger cool, he needed to stay calm. He relaxed his shoulders, folding his hands behind his back, leaving himself opened if Montague wanted to attack. If he dared. "And how did you come to such a conclusion?" he asked, his voice sickly sweet.
But now, in this simple moment together, Draco allowed himself to just look. Potter hadn’t changed much, his hair was longer and he had gotten taller, but otherwise he appeared the same. Draco couldn’t stop the first genuine smile he had in months from forming on his face. He couldn’t stop his heart beating faster. He couldn’t stop the warmth in his chest that melted away the ice that Draco had surrounded himself in while at the Manor. He couldn’t stop these emotions if he wanted to, a dangerous risk, but a risk Draco wanted to take. He wouldn’t stop these feelings if he could, which was the most dangerous thought of them all.
"Malfoy," Draco stopped, he turned back to Greyback.
"Draco, that's not what I mean-" Potter stood then as he rubbed his face.
Draco opened his mouth, then closed it. "I…um…" he stuttered dumbly.
"Step forward, my girl," their Lord ordered. Daphne stepped forward, her head down, her hands clasped delicately in front of her. She was the perfect sight of a young humble lady. Their Lord wasn't affected. "State your crimes."
The fire extinguish as if dowsed with water.
Hagrid continued to lecture his class, but Draco stayed with his Thestral. Potter stood next to him, grinning whenever the animal tried to eat Draco's neck collar.
"He's ok," Draco interrupted, "all things considering, he's fine." Draco took out a folded letter from his robes, "He even sent word himself."
Draco rolled to his side, there was an emptiness behind his closed curtains. Night had already fallen.
"Very well," was Draco's answer, "he has been spending a lot of time at work."
Severus tilted his head in reaction to Draco's slip, "What is that supposed to mean?" he investigated.
"Guess what I heard about Montague today," Potter baited with a grin.
'I'm going to miss you,' Draco wouldn't let himself say.
"You're wearing the cloak I got you," Draco grinned.
"I'm trying to help you, asshole," Daphne snapped.
"Yes, Professor," Draco answered, his stomach turning in on him as everyone's attention was on him.
"Look what you did," she teased.
"Better that you have no thought of it," he dismissed. Better that you don't know where my arrow is coming from.
"And who can see these creatures? What good is teaching students about a creature that they can't see?" Umbridge demanded, she managed to intimidate Hagrid despite the fact that she barely came up to his waist.
The weeks passed. Students went to classes despite the overhang of war. Professors taught despite the knowledge of an oncoming battle that they couldn't prepare children for. Draco continued his planning despite the knowledge that someone in the castle wanted to hurt him very badly.
He would kill them. No, he would do more than that.
The office had two desks on either side. A door was across from the entrance the group just entered. Parchments littered the desks, spilling onto the floor. Draco stumbled into Potter, who was frozen where he stood, before he hit the floor.
He didn't voice any of these thoughts as class began. Professor's Firenze's voice washed over the class, but Draco couldn't force himself to pay attention.
He stood over Daphne, but she wouldn't back down. This was where the line was drawn. Who backed down first would have lost, both knew that wasn't acceptable. Lucius exhaled slowly when Daphne didn't move, his knuckles white on his cane. Daphne continued to smoke, a bored attitude around her.
Draco didn't have to look in the mirror to know the person who smelt like cigarette smoke.
A weight settled on Draco's chest. His hands felt clammy. "No, but I'll always be in danger, Harry. Even without our relationship."
"They're Changeling Candies, they change your appearance," the boy explained, backed into the wall.
"Yes, well, a man with such standing as your father must be very busy," Umbridge complemented.
They could all go to hell.
The Dark Lord was not a very forgiving man to failure.
The weight that had previously left him slammed into him like a pile of bricks. The knot in his chest tightened as chills clawed at his spine. He knew what she was talking about, he was just thinking about it, but saying the words out loud took a courage Draco didn't have.
Potter looked up at him, their eyes meeting. Draco's stomach jumped into his throat, his cheeks heating up down to his chest. A small smile sneaked onto Potter's lips and Draco almost tripped over his own feet. He looked up at the cherubs that he was sure was laughing at his expense.
"I…" she stuttered, "I made a mistake, only one mistake."
Draco sighed, his web of influence didn't go very far. He couldn't get control over this situation. He would lose what little control he had, be at mercy to the Dark Lord, who was anything but merciful.
"Malfoy, as always, your manners are impeccable," she complemented.
Someone running past him brought himself back. He jumped at her, wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her flat against his chest as he backed to the wall. Praying that they weren't seen or heard as he laid a hand over her mouth.
"Sorry," Blaise and Theo mumbled simultaneously.
"I know," Draco whispered.
They continued to laugh, maybe because Draco never laughed like he was unless Potter was around, maybe because Draco could feel Death following his scent, maybe because they were both children facing war and that realization was becoming more apparent. They laughed until their sides hurt. They laughed until they cried while smiling.
Draco stretched his shoulders while he popped his sore neck. He had been sitting down too long. While Draco's essay for Charms had been finished early, his exam for Transfiguration had loomed over his head with an evil glee. The three had collectively decided to panic together. Draco didn’t usually wait until the last minute, or the night before, but he had spent the day in Severus’ Potions lab making a large batch of a basic healing salve. He also made a couple of basic healing droughts, just in case. Then, of course, Severus had required him to have tea for the use of his resources. Draco had spent to entire day in the Potions Room, only meeting up with Daphne and Theo after dinner.
"Montague. Leave," he ordered.
Draco took a step back, enjoying the view , everyone working together again. He felt warm in the hushed laughter and giggles.
"There's no need to apologize," Draco acknowledged, "I'm sorry I snapped at you," the apology felt strange on his tongue. "Are you going to tell anyone?" Draco asked, knowing the answer.
O.W.Ls came and passed. Draco couldn’t make himself care about his scores, but his earlier need for distraction paid off. He was getting almost perfect scores in all of his test. He was second in his scores only to Granger. He couldn't make himself care.
The girls had managed to stand, Daphne had Pansy's arm held behind her back and was shoving Pansy's face into a bowl of stew. Pansy had given up all attempts of getting away, and was stabbing Daphne repeatedly in the leg with a fork.
The hoist led them to a small, two person table next to the window. "Do you like the window seat, darling? I requested it especially for you." Daphne thickly acted on his arm.
Perhaps Draco would be the one to bleed for his father's failures.
"No, but I'm sure you do," Daphne countered.
A gift waited for Draco in the middle of his bed the next morning. The dorms were quiet, everyone else was off to class. He had gotten permission to take an additional day to rest without attending classes. An excuse not given often by Madam Pomphrey, but she had given him a pitying look and told him to just worry about getting better. The gift was wrapped in green paper with silver ribbon. It was a narrow long box and wasn't much thicker than two inches. He opened card that was neatly propped on top. The card was pale, but was written in a dark green ink. The smell of a woman's perfume assaulted his nose when he opened the card. The gift was from Pansy, of course, wishing him well in his recovery. A red lipstick kiss stain signed the bottom of the letter.
"Occlumency is a delicate magic, unlike anything you've studied before. It's ancient and complicated, but most importantly, it’s flexible," Draco lectured. He walked around the table, taking a seat on the couch. Potter sat down next to him.
His Lord seemed pleased at the effect Umbridge was having on Hogwarts. With a confession that he wanted to teach at Hogwarts himself, the Dark Lord offered to make up for the lack of education Draco was suffering. Draco accepted in a rush.
"Muggle?" Theo noted.
Blue eyes studied him.
"Only for our sake," Draco continued to Umbridge's agreement. "I was hoping to apologize to you for my behavior last week, Professor," he started. "I was out of line, and I reflected badly onto you, I'm sorry," he apologized.
"Potter," he gently spoke, trying not to startle him, "Potter, wake up."
"They should have fought for me! For us! You know what this means, right? You're going to be put on the auctioning block to be sold off to the highest bidder," Daphne cruelly reminded her.
Draco shrugged, "Not your concern, Potter," he baited.
Professor Binns entered from the wall behind his lecture desk, moving through the wall with ease. Draco doubted he would ever get used to that. The ghost started to read from the textbook laid out on his desk, his voice putting Weasley to sleep almost instantly.
Severus leaned back in his chair, still breathing heavily in anger. He ran a hand over his face. "Perhaps," he started quietly, "perhaps it is best that I take on teaching Potter."
Draco allows his mind to drift back to a distant memory, letting his guard down, comfortable in the privacy of his walk. He thought back to a time when his home was not a prison, a time before the Dark Lord entered his life, a time when his home was still a home. The warmth provided as Draco lounged in front of the fireplace, reading while his parents sat in their respected chairs, drinking wine and discussing this and that. The warm breeze that would past during a summertime breakfast out in the garden. Mother and Father listening to him talk on and on about whatever he had to say, nodding and hardly hiding their amusement at their son.
The Greengrass family entered through the side entrance. The parents tightly clinging to their daughters. Astoria was already crying, her head bowed into a pale blue handkerchief. Daphne had her head bowed, dressed in her signature blue robes.
He was confident that Potter would keep his secret, if for nothing else that Potter had almost no one to tell that could incriminate Draco or challenge his status. Of course, it would still be a huge pain in his ass if Potter had told his shadows. This was less predictable; Potter was inseparable from Granger and Weasley, but lately he had been more withdrawn. Draco was confident he could persuade Potter not to tell their now shared secret if Draco just managed to talk to the boy.
She would make slight glances at Draco while this conversation happened. The ridiculousness of it. The fucking irony. After, when they were alone with smoke in the air from their cigarettes, she would laugh. She would talk about what an idiot Draco was, for not being prepared for this exact situation. She would chide him and ridicule him.
Daphne walked up to him, meeting him in the hallway. He looked around to see if anyone was around. The two were alone. Everyone was usually in a rushed to get to lunch, this section of the hallway was cleared during this period.
Draco ran out of the stall, through the lavatory and into the halls. His feet carried him as his lungs burned with the intensity of his running. He shoved students out of his way, ignoring the yells.
Draco started to do the mature action and proceeded to kick Potter's shins. This, naturally, caused Potter to kick back. When the two boys continued to kick each other with intensity, Potter was pulled out of his chair by his collar by his good friend Weasley.
Sirius jumped in with, “It’s not like I have anyone to tell. You can’t blame him for wanting to talk about his boyfr-“
Potter's head snapped back in his chair. His hair wet with sweat against his forehead. Draco's stomach twisted as Potter struggled against the spell, clenching the arms of the wooden chair. He had to look away.
"What did I do?" Draco's voice was quiet, but Potter gave him a quick sympathetic look. His nose pulsed so hard Draco felt the pain in his jaw.
He tilted his head, his gaze never leaving Daphne's mother. She tightened her eyes slightly, Draco noticed her throat move with a swallow. He made her nervous. A simply polite smile crossed his face. Mr. Greengrass laid a hand on his wife's shoulder. They were scared of him. "Unfortunately, my involvement with your family is far from over. Let us make sure to be civil, yes?" he spoke in the same tone of voice that his mother had disowned him with. Cold. Piercing. Deadly.
"It's just…this is the only place I can be myself, or, at least, a closer version of myself," Theo didn't meet his gaze.
"Are you? Because you are acting without consideration to your wellbeing or your family's."
There would be no warm fires with Draco sneaking a sip of wine from his mother's glass. Narcissa, pretending not to notice with an easy smile. Lucius reading, or answering his mail in his chair. Draco knew with a sureness that his home would be a hollowed out version.
Potter with his wonderful green eyes, with his unruly hair, with his warm hands, and his pulsing broomstick-
"You've already shown me that I'm a pawn, Headmaster. You'll have to get better tactics to deal with me."
For as long as he could remember, Dobby was there. They would play hide and seek while his parents were preoccupied. Dobby would listen to Draco talk about school, Potter and his new broom.
"Why would you assume Potter doesn't know?" Dumbledore tilted his head.
A hand on his bicep stopped him from leaving. Lupin stepped closer, his eyes kind. "My door is always open if you need anything. If you find yourself in a situation you can't get out of-"
Turning back to continue his walk to charms, Draco made his way down the hallways of his school. The halls were quiet, as most of the students were in class and those who were running late left Draco alone to his thoughts.
"I'm right here," Blaise had sat next to him, his hand moved to his shoulder in reassurance, "I'm fine, really, more surprised than anything." Nott stood behind Blaise, his eyes shifting nervously between the two.
There was so much information that Draco was lacking. How are Potter and the Dark Lord connected? How strong was the connection? Potter only saw visions in his dreams, but could the Dark Lord see into Potter's thoughts?
His lungs turned into water. He was drowning. He was on fire. He was freezing.
His face felt blotchy as he turned away from Potter to wipe his face of the tears that had managed to spill.
"Well, it is so hard to tell these days," Dumbledore shrugged, "I do know that you have been spending a lot of time with Harry. I wonder…"
(See the end of the chapter for
"By obliterating him."
When Draco didn’t move Potter drew him into a hug. Draco allowed himself be held, but he couldn’t bring himself to wrap his arms around Potter. His hands almost touched the warmth of Potter's back, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t let himself give into comfort and touch Potter. Potter should only be handled with hands not stained in blood.
"No, of course not," Draco comforted, "I just thought that after the fight with Finnigan, you wouldn't… want me anymore."
"Thank you both. I'm thankful to have such understanding, sensitive acquaintances," he stated, sitting down across the pair.
"No, but I'm sure that’s a one-way street, correct?" Dumbledore observed.
"Pansy-" keep your apology, you owe me nothing, I just want you back.
"You can't be here," was her response, unbothered.
Potter stared, “Wow, Malfoy. Was that… a compliment?” Potter looked as surprised as Draco felt, he could feel his blush on his cheeks. Draco looked away, he wasn’t going to say anything.
"I'm sorry for your lost," he continued, uncappable of facing her.
Draco blushed, a smile forcing its way onto his face. "So…you were worried about me?" he teased.
A small girl in muggle clothing stepped forward and cast an impressive silencing charm around the mountain when the class couldn't keep their laughter to themselves so Theo could keep sleeping. A girl with brown hair and warm light brown skin, the same girl Draco had helped in the corridor.
Draco's stomach dropped, "Oh."
Draco had Potter in a loose head-lock, more like a hug, really, as Potter could stand fully and with ease. Potter had his arms around Draco's waist, which Draco was not thinking about. Thank you very much.
"You mean before you sliced her throat open and let her bleed out under your feet?"
"Daphne?" Potter pulls away, the warmth from his touch gone.
Draco kept his ears sharp, he was more attentive than ever in case of another attack from his teacher. The rest of the class sat a little straighter, wrote a little more, took Snape's lecture to their hearts. Everyone was terrified of being the next target, but Severus seemed to specifically reserve all of his frustration for Draco.
The warmth on he room greeted him as the door opened with ease. The fire was burning bright in front of the couch that had taken on an orange color tonight. The room had left out the chairs, Draco supposed that he and Potter didn't really need them anymore.
"Yes?"
How did Potter know? He was careful, he was always careful, his status depended on it. He knew his entrance into the Frog-Lady’s graces were absolutely necessary when he first realized the Ministry had moved to take control over Hogwarts. This was a pathetic attempt to remain in  control of the people, with Potter turning up with a dead student in the middle of the Quidditch Field screaming Voldemort, and Dumbledore's recent mysterious disappearances, unrest was common.
Draco grinned, "I went with Pansy, ask me how well that went."
"Pansy Parkinson didn't say anything to you this class period?"
“Mr. Malfoy…Malfoy?” Flitwick was standing in front of Draco's desk, having notice Draco's tardiness. Draco paused, unsure if he was about to be scowled.
He opened his eyes to meet a gaze of vibrant green. The infirmary was dark with no candlelight providing any illumination of the large hall except for a small orb of soft blue light appearing from Potter's wand. Potter smiled, but his eyes were scrunched in concern. "How are you feeling?"
The pair continued their familiar small talk until they arrived at the shack and took the window seat. Surprisingly, the seat held their weight.
"Draco, nice of you to join us," Theo greeted, who was sitting by himself.
"Please play, it won't be the same without you," Potter pouted.
"Don't even mention me, I'll be of no use if I'm dead," he confirmed.
Black smooth bricks lined the walls of the narrow hall he stood in. The walls were so close together the cool stone almost touched his shoulders. Light flickered across the hall from an unseen source. Also like he was underwater on a sunny day and the patterns were breaking through.
"For some reason, I doubt that," Dumbledore speculated.
This was his chance. "I feel so powerless," he confided, his voice breaking with the truth. "I can't do anything, I just want to do something," he whispered.
Granger and Weasley stopped, looking back at Potter as if he just had grown a second head. Draco looked at Granger. She looked at Draco. He turned to Weasley. Weasley looked at him.
Draco studied the two older men. Both gave him steady looks. He put the pieces together. "Oh, I see now," Draco leaned his head back against the pillows. He looked up at the high ceiling as he answered, "you don't have to worry about me retaliating."
"And you put Snape above the killing attempts?"
"Of course."
The chamber was rounded, larger than the hall with the twelve doors. However, the walls weren't smooth dark brick, but rugged rock. The room raised towards the middle, sloping to the outer edges, like a lonely island. In the middle of the room, at the height, a high archway stood empty.
Having to witness Montague be pulled out of the pipes almost ruined the fun. Being sent to class by a stern Snape did ruin the fun, but not without a serious conversation about confidentiality. Meaning, if Draco told anyone that Severus fell on his ass after talking to a toilet he would be in detention for the rest of the year.
"Do you think it'll ever be enough?"
"Draco, may I apologize?" she asked, her eyes still downcast. The room went quiet, all eyes were on Pansy in her uncharacteristic humility. Draco could count on one hand all of the times Pansy had apologized to him; it was zero.
"Malfoy," Draco introduced himself.
Bones went to cast a spell but she wasn't as practiced as him. He had her wand out of her hand quickly.
Dumbledore had taken his seat in a large armchair next to the fireplace. He motioned for Draco to take the armchair opposite. Draco did has he was told.
Draco froze, his eyes closed. His mind blanked as Potter's lips stayed against his.
"Adequate."
Potter's lips were soft against his. He was so warm against Draco.
Potter lowered the bag and shuffled his feet, looking down. "I wanted to apologize for the other night," Potter stated.
Draco observed as Potter watch Cho leave. Potter blinked, his eyes met Draco's. Draco clenched his fist so he wouldn't reach out to comfort his friend.
Draco ate the sweet candy, "Chocolate's my favorite."
Draco left Potter's mind quickly, their goal for tonight had been accomplished. "That was perfect," Draco beamed, a grin plastered on his face. "The most progress you've made yet."
"Draco," Potter added, "I'll be fine. Go to bed." He had deep blue circles under his eyes. His hair was disheveled more so than usual. The color had gone from his face. He looked tired, but what was more concern is who defeated he sounded. He knew Severus wasn't going to stop until they had a breakthrough, or classes started the next morning. Potter was determined for the later.
Potter sighed as he leaned against the railing. He looked up at the clear night sky. His elbows resting on either side of him. He looked so casual, so easy in his grief. Draco knew something would boil against Potter's skin soon. Boil out and blister and burn him until his chest ached for relief. Draco's did. "I'm tired," Potter didn't look at him. "I'm tired of so much, I'm tired of losing people. I'm tired of being angry all the time. I'm tired of walking around eggshells with my friends. I'm so sick of people dying for me, I never wanted anyone to die for me."
"You would never guess what I just saw," a familiar voice spoke next to him.
Draco arrived to the Room of Requirement almost an hour early, he couldn't help it. Potter's present had been carefully tucked underneath Draco's arm while he hurried down the darken quiet halls. Despite the unsettling silence of the hallways, Draco smile wouldn't leave his face. He was going to see Potter again, and soon, at Potter's suggestion.
"Daphne-"
"Shut up, Potter!" Daphne hissed, "or do you want the entire school to know?"
Draco threw his bookbag at Potter.
"No one," Draco rose from his seat.
Draco shivered in the chill as he walked alongside the greatest dark wizard of the century. He shoved his hands in his pockets to warm them. Draco could feel Potter's penknife in one pocket, and Daphne's pale blue zippo lighter in the other. They continued walking, moving past the flowerbeds and to the large fountains of the outer garden.
"Blaise-"
"That's better," Draco noted, grinning at the two Slytherins.
"Yes, we have an idea," Blaise interrupted. His voice steady for someone buttoning up his shirt. "Where is everyone else?"
Potter moved his hand from Draco's face, a smile still on his face. "Are we okay?" Potter whispered, his face still close to Draco's.
Dumbledore clasped his hands in front of him. "It's hard to say right now, but Madam Pomphrey is stabilizing her so she can be transported to St. Mungo's," he explained calmly.
"The fire, the ash… no one else had the same reaction, why?" Draco gave in.
A loud slam on the door made the four look for a place to hide. The room was brightly lit. Clocks lined every surface of the many tables that lined the room. Parchment littered the remaining spaces. Draco pressed himself against the wall next to the door. He would be hidden behind the door once it was opened.
"Yeah, it's a free market," Weasley Two agreed.
"Please. Please shut up," Draco ran his hands through his hair.
"That's all," Potter dropped the subject, but he tilted his head with a knowing look. Which made Draco's gaze settle on the strip of neck that was exposed. Potter's eyebrows shot up.
"I'm not infatuated with Potter," he argued.
Potter gave a confused look, "We're friends, Draco, of course I like you," he simply stated.
Potter started to pull at his pajama sleeve, but kept his eyes steady on Draco. "I wasn't fair before," he started, "I'm so sorry. I was just… so mad at you, but also everyone. And I took it out on you, but you don't deserve that."
Silence.
What was that noise?
The fire provided light that danced across Potter's warm face. Draco would be content to stand here to study Potter, to remember this version of him that is usually off limits. The fact that Potter had waited for him into the deep hour of the night warmed Draco's chest. Potter trusted him enough to show, which Draco did. He rose to the occasion.
"Well who else," Pansy continued to flattered.
The room was like walking into a dream.
Draco watched as Potter stepped up to the fire next. Unsurprisingly, he got the sign for doom and gloom. Potter just shrugged with the old news Firenze bursting into laughter at Potter's response. Potter turned, he met Draco's eyes, winking. Draco hit his snort behind a cough, his stomach fluttering and his neck blushing.
"Just a bit," Draco lied.
"Malfoy, I am afraid that we have undeniable proof," Dumbledore finally spoke from behind them.
"Yes, what made you decide that I was qualified to teach Potter Occlumency?" Draco started weaving his trap.
Potter would die because of his weakness. He would bleed out in his arms. What was the possibility that Draco would be the one to kill him?
"Don't be ridiculous," Draco spoke. Everyone turned to him. Draco wrapped himself in his easy act. "It's just rubbish ma'am," he explained to Umbridge. "Obviously," he stepped in front of Potter, who was tied tightly to a chair. "He is just trying to set up a trap." Potter looked up at Draco. Potter shook his head slightly. They haven't talked in weeks, but silently Draco knew what Potter was telling him.
The two sat in comfortable silence as Draco finished the cigarette, putting it out on the window sill. "How was your summer?"
He was now standing in front of the twins, both of which were very much taller than he, hands on his hips. The rest of the students had scampered off, leaving just him and the twins. Two to one. Damnit. The twins stood between him and their very interesting set up of various magical candies in brightly-colored boxes. He hadn't mean to stumble onto their set up, he was too busy being bored to care, but he wasn't paying attention when he walked into the dramatic set up. Now, he had to play his part.
"What do you want?" Draco prompted his friend.
A hand on his bicep stopped him. Greyback handed him two cigarettes with a wink. "Good luck with the contraband."
"Mafalda Prewett, Bulstrode, Zabini and Daphne's little sister."
"I didn't tell you my name, what makes you think I'm going to tell you what house I'm in?" replied the                               girl, pointing out the obvious.
"Why can't you talk about Cedric?" he blurted.
He didn't deserve comfort. He deserved to be burned at the stake.
Draco took that as his cue to slip out of the door. He heard Pansy's dissection of what exactly Crabb and Goyal thought was going on between Potter's shadows as he left.
"What do you want, Potter?" he sneered instantly. He could see Daphne rolling her eyes out of the corner of his eye.
How do you talk to a current outlaw who has been on the run for the last two years? "You have a smoke?" Draco asked. He was about to vomit. His head pounded in his ears.
Draco swallowed, looking into the fire. How could he explain to Potter, the bravest man he had ever known, that he was scared?
"Merlin, Potter, just take my fucking help," he argued.
"I know that, obviously I know that, Draco," Potter snapped. Draco stayed quiet. He didn’t know how to make this better. Maybe Potter would be better off he didn’t have to worry about Draco. "I'm sorry," Potter signed, "Draco, I just…after Sirius, I just don't want anyone else to die for me. And when I didn’t hear anything from you over the summer-"
"Whatever, you're paying for lunch."
"You're a child," Severus pointed out in frustration, standing in front of Draco.
Potter and Granger hid under a table filled with floating clocks frozen in time.
"How was your day Malfoy? How did your date go Malfoy?" Draco mocked Potter's frustration.
"I wouldn't go as far as to say we're best friends, but I appreciate the thought," Daphne broke the tension, drinking her milk.
"Set up? Set up what? Why do you have to set up?" Potter tensed, he started to play with one of his sweater sleeves nervously.
Draco's mouth quirked into a smirk. He was surprise at how much he is enjoying this, this playful conversing without weaving in and out of subtle threats and double meanings. He could do with more of this. But he knew that in his world, he was not able to enjoy this for too long, he was not allowed to make friends. One could only be distracted for so long.
Potter was standing firm. His wand raised, spells flying as he protected his friends.
"Congratulations on your promotion."
Draco stood to investigate. "This is not any better," he dismissed.
Draco bit the inside of his cheek, his face hot in shame. His fist tightened until he was sure his hands would bleed from his nails biting into his hands. His stomach boiled in anger at Severus's smug face, he was enjoying Draco's reaction. His vision blurred with tears he refused to shed.
Draco flipped through his notes for tomorrow's Potions class. Soon, the winter holidays would be upon them. Draco would return to his home that wasn't a home. He would be promised to marry a girl who didn't love him. He would have to accept whatever situation he entered into at the manor.
Blaise rolled his eyes at Draco's discomfort, "Merlin, Malfoy, take a joke."
"Of course, but you would know all about that, being a woman of your standing," Draco baited, "I'm quite sure the Minister of Magic wouldn't entrust you with such an important job without you being beyond qualified."
"I know, I'm just tired, that's all," Draco excused.
"I guess the more appropriate question is why?" Draco clarified, then quietly, "let me see."
"Harry?" a girl's voice came from behind the door. "Harry open the door."
Cho pointedly skootched the chair away from Draco, leaning away as he walked. Not that Draco could blame her.
"What are you doing?" Astoria demanded.
"Daphne, we weren't including you in our close group of friends," Pansy chided.
"Of course it's not," Draco answered quietly, making this moment just for Potter, even if they had an audience. Draco touched Potter's shoulder, resting his hand, trying to steady both himself and Potter. "We're friends, Potter," Draco promised.
The couple of hours alone with Potter made him feel so safe. In that shack amongst cobwebs, mold and the ghost of bad memories, Draco felt warm. They had taken to holding hands while they had their talks, and neither of them complained or even mentioned the new development.
Draco was an idiot. Why would Potter come here? He had Granger to heal his hand, why would he need Draco. He should just leave, he wasn't needed, so he wasn't wanted.
Draco  lit the smoke with practiced ease, inhaling the warmth into his lungs. The focus of the routine  allowed his hands to stop shaking.
"Oh, I'm sure you do," Daphne retorted back.
And another.
Draco walked with confidence to the Slytherin table, joining his large social circle with ease. Zabini had saved him a seat on his left, Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott were also there.
As they had arrived closer and closer to their destination, Draco watched as the tension left his companion's shoulders. Pansy had somehow gotten him to lay back, his head in her lap, with a coy smile that reminded him of a time when they were good friends. He let himself relax as much as he could allow. Everyone enjoyed the momentary release of the crushing weight of the ongoing war. They found themselves laughing at something Goyle had said that wasn't actually funny, but they gave this moment to themselves as a gift.
A gentle hand on his brought Draco out of his thoughts, he turned. He still had his hand tightly on Pansy's wrist, he loosened his grip. Pansy squeezed his hand as he ran his thumb against her wrist in apology. They were never ones for words.
"And," she continued, "my favorite color is blue."
"Yes," Draco rolled his eyes, "You've pointed that out, do you have anything useful to say, or are you going to continue to waste my time?"
Draco kept his face blank.
Unless this was her plain the entire time.
"Who doesn't need a friend?" Draco theorized, which earned him another punch in the arm.
"Draco."
"Montague," Draco stated.
Merlin, he was shit. How was he supposed to build a relationship with Potter if he couldn't keep the friends he has now?  Potter was different though. He was easy to talk to, he also just…allowed Draco to be. Draco didn't have anyone who he could just be with, he was constantly playing a role; a son, a follower, a heir. Potter didn't need him, he had his friends, he had true friends. Potter was probably only reaching out to Draco out of necessity. If that was the caste, then Draco was determined to be useful to Potter in any way. Draco could be himself around Potter, even if their relationship was built on necessity.
"A little harsh, but yes,"
Daphne stepped forward with a bright smile. "I would Professor."
Draco broke into a run towards Potter and his friends.
"Yeah," Potter sighed, "Do you think she knows I exist?"
"It was too easy," Draco grinned, "who knew that the Carrow twin fancied you?"
"She wanted to talk about… feelings," Draco shivered at the word 'feelings.'
This is my first fandom work, comments are more than welcome :)
"The situation being that his and the Dark Lord's every mind, every essence, are connected. If the Dark Lord sees you in Potter's mind, he will know of your betrayal," Severus lectured him.
Draco could hear the shuffling of footsteps outside the train cart. Everyone was greeting their friends from over the break. The sounds of their smiles split Draco's ears in a twisted sort of jealousy. No one would each out to comfort him within this train.
"Hey, Cho. What's up?" Potter nearly shouted, nervousness laced his voice.
"I asked them to make something you would like," Severus explained.
Potter rolled his eyes, "I will make sure to never to that again."
The letter was from Mrs. Parkinson, Pansy's mother, the letter was about a dinner party taking place over the winter break. Draco read through the letter, the guest list, slowly putting the pieces together.
"They're upstairs," he murmured.
The burning sensation of panic didn't coil around him.
"Professor…?" Daphne asked, "is everything okay?"
Draco told him what he told the professors that have found him injured in the halls. He didn't have any clue who attacked him. Draco was also quick to remind everyone he did have a serious concussion, and could he really be expected to have seen his attacker's face when he was tossed in the air then lit on fire?
"I'm so tired of crying," she smiled pathetically.
Daphne's eyes widen, she hadn't expected him to consider.
"We've been doing this for weeks now, we have to start making progress sometime."
"A five out of five. You mean," Draco noted.
"This is so stupid, you are stupid!" Draco almost yelled. "Do you have any idea-"
"Why are you here?" he finally asked.
"Well done boys," Hagrid held out a raw piece of meat to the creature, the Thestral took the meal happily. Draco turned to Theo and Blaise, the pair were standing close together, but they stayed clear of the large horse creatures. The other class members were looking at him and Potter, but not the Thestral, or any of the Thestrals.
"I guess it doesn't matter then, since we are just friends," Potter noted, his jaw clenched.
Crabb fell into the table Granger and Potter had been hiding under. Granger scampered away as the table hit the floor.
“Can I asked you a question?” the girl spoke up.
"And what is that, young Malfoy?"
Draco tried to catch the blood from his nose, the copper taste on his tongue as he breathed through his mouth. Weasley stared at him as Potter pulled him away.
What if Dobby didn't warn the Order in time? What if Draco was following Potter to his death? Would anyone miss him? Would his parents mourn his death? Would anyone mourn the death of a murderer? Would Daphne forgive him if he died so soon after her sacrifice?
Draco was only too pleased for a drought that had him sleeping until dinner. No dreams or pain met him while he rested.
"If you have something useful to say, then say it, otherwise; I'm busy, so don’t waste my time," he snapped.
Mafalda made a noise that reminded him of a dying mermaid that he could only assume was a laugh. "What the fuck Mafalda," he wheezed, clutching his chest. "Mafalda," he repeated, "Merlin, that's an awful name."
Draco knew she was going to find out, might as well tell her. "She didn't sit next to me…Potter got there first," he explained. Daphne didn't understand.
Repeat.
Cho Chang clawed at her throat. Her feet kicking in the air. Her hands trying to grab a rope around her neck that wasn't there.
Ribbons of panic coiled around his chest.
"Oh? I will let you know that green brings out my eyes," Potter corrected.
He as shown her too much, she knows what he would do. The humiliation with Montague proved how far he would go. Daphne would be even more careful around him. He had to gain control over the situation.
"And who have you seen died?" Umbridge asked bluntly.
Ding.
Maybe, or, perhaps, his Lord was reminding him to stay focus, as if he needed a reminder as to what was at stake for him. He was balancing on a razor thin blade, one miss step would lead to his certain death. If he was a lucky man, his death would come quickly.
Draco had to hide his smile behind his heavy potions textbook.
"Did Dumbledore talk to you?" Potter asked, his eyes downcast.
He took a complicated path to the room. He never used the same path consistently. The sounds of classes beginning filtered out of the rooms as he walked by. Maybe he could skip his next lesson to get more work done on the cabinet. A lot was relying on this to work, he had to make this work. He didn't have a-
Draco waited in the Room of Hidden Things for Potter, trying to think of a plan of how to handle him. The room had transformed itself into a simple one, with a burning fireplace in the center and two comfortable lounge chairs next to each other. A large book on Potions Theory, the same one he had recommended to Nott, lay on the small table with a lamp in between the two chairs. The deep red of the rug clashed with the rustic orange of the chairs, but the room seemed to be more for comfort than style. Draco definitely wasn’t complaining as he leaned comfortably against his chair pillow, an awful shade of purple. He tried his best not to allow his eyes to dip against his tiredness, to sink farther into the hideous pillow, but his thoughts started to wonder in the quiet, forcing him to remember what he desperately wanted to forget.
"How horrid!" Umbridge gasped at the old news.
How could Severus parade around the fact that…. Draco could even think about what his godfather had been implying, what it meant. Draco's chin quivered, he had to keep looking down in case someone were to walk by.
Lucius tensed at the statement. The silence was Draco's answer.
The two Slytherins continued eating, Blaise remained stonily silent after Draco’s small effort at comfort. The rest of their circle continued with their conversation, allowing them privacy.
She hadn't suddenly grown in wisdom that his mother possessed. She hadn't suddenly become the perfect fiancé that adored him, or even just liked him.
Well, that was exactly what he wanted to hear, but he nodded in agreement. The young girl opened the large door and against his better judgement, he followed her in.
Was he a good enough man to let Harry go?
Potter gave him a look he wasn't used to, unreadable, "I wasn't planning on it," he concluded.
"I'm sorry."
"I like it," Potter bit his lip.
This was serious, what didn't Draco know?
"My Mother didn't say, she can't I assume, but she hinted as well as she could. I'm sure it's you," she agreed.
Potter’s hand moved to the back of his neck.
Not that Dumbledore had to know about this portal. Not yet, anyway. If Dumbledore wanted to play his cards to his chest, then what was the problem of Draco having a card up his sleeve?
"Pansy," she stated.
"I can try harder," Potter looked down at his hands.
Pansy walked up tentatively to the group, her eyes downcast and hands clasped together, the perfect sign of feminine humility. Draco instantly tensed as she stood the respectful distance away, waiting permission to speak.
"Don’t you dare bring him into this," Draco corrected. Severus knew which buttons to press.
"Shut up, I'm thinking," was Draco's response to the complaint. Potter shut his mouth as Draco thought about the consequences of this new revelation.
A fact he had accepted. If he accepted his death, he was less afraid while doing his work. Or so he told himself.
"Draco, listen… I want to talk about a couple of nights ago."
"To see how well he taught you," she stopped in front of him, raising her wand.
Draco looked around, several people cast their eyes downwards or turned their heads completely. Everyone was giving the Slytherins a wide girth.
"And we haven't already?" Potter pleated.
"I don’t know what you're talking about."
Cho didn't smile at him, but she didn't say anything either. She had continued to share her textbook with him in Divinations. Draco had let Daphne borrow it after she had lost hers. He couldn't make himself ask Astoria if she knew where it was.
"Not all the time! Just when we're alone. I promise. He even made me swear not to tell anyone," Black explained.
"Asshole." He heard muttered at the next table as he sat down.
Draco gave a shrug, "so long as they don't eat the owls."
Draco gave a sigh to appear relieved, "Thanks Potter, I didn't mean for you to have to keep things from your friends, this is a relief though, so thank you," Draco gave the thanks genuinely.
Draco did not enjoy ignoring Potter, but distance between them was needed.
“No, I don’t have anyone,” Draco reiterated.
Potter happily agreed. Draco tightened his hold on Potter in retaliation. Then he was looking up at the sky, back on the grass, head pounding from where he hit the unforgiving ground. His ribs ached, his breath stolen from his lungs and Potter out of his grasp. Ronald Weasley, the bastard, was over him, having tackled him to the ground. He was furious, mud on his uniform, a black eye to sport. His fist hit Draco with an impressive force on the lip, pain exploded from Draco's mouth, anger ripped through his ribs.
Did he leave his book at the manor?
"Sirius Black."
Tears slipped down Draco's cheeks from laughing. When he moved to wipe them, Potter reached out, still giggling, and brushed them away. He paused, his eyes searching Draco's face, "What do we do now?" Potter asked, his fingertips still against Draco's face.
Draco sighed, "It just seems like Cho would be the best person to talk to about Cedric, you're both grieving. That's all."
Blood.
"He has Padfoot!" Potter called after Severus.
"That shouldn't mean you're not included, you're not your father," Potter pouted.
Because…
"Helping me watch my diet, what a mate," Draco spoke loudly, nearly yelling now. Maybe he could just yell this problem away.
Shit.
Some people believed him. Some people remember how the first war began, the Ministry's concerned with the appearance of control rather than the protection of their citizens. That's how his Mother explained the First War in a hushed voice.
Draco wrapped his arms around Potter, pulling him into a hug.
Gasping, struggling against the ropes that were wrapped around his arms, his neck. They were choking him, stealing the breath from out of his lungs. Snakes. Tightening their grip on him, crushing him. His ribs crack against the pressure, letting the snakes slide into his chest to swallow the heart in him. He thrashed against the tightening coils.
"There had to have been a better way to do this," Theo spoked beside him.
He knew there was another reasoning behind the gathering of Draco's betrothal. The men had quickly locked themselves in the West Hall. The West wing had become His wing. Their Lord was giving orders, giving orders to what Draco now known to be the Azkaban breakout.
"We thought you would be longer-" Theo shuttered.
The man was suddenly much closer. Draco stepped into the cold brick along his back. The need to run buzzed at the base of his skull, but he stayed.
"That wasn't fair," he admitted.
"I've been looking for you," Astoria stayed in the doorway.
His mind was being torn in two from the pain. His skull was shattered, his brain cracking.
"Didn't even show up for breakfast. Daphne? She was looking for you."
Pain, so much pain. The taste of blood and dirt in his mouth. His back arching, twisting, twitching painfully.
He turned to the person, a curse on the tip of his tongue-
Draco wouldn’t let himself look anywhere but his Lord's back. He couldn't handle seeing disappointment or pride on his parent's faces.
"Oh, I caught them necking," Tonks deadpanned.
Draco should tell him the truth, but that could get Draco killed. Draco bit his lip, rubbing his palms together. How was he supposed to balance this line between friendship and duty? His stomach dropped at the thought of blurring those lines together. He could hardly tell what was right and what was for survival anymore.
"True, so if you win, just know it's because I have to also fight my own team," Draco shrugged.
Draco felt a slender hand on his shoulder, cupping his cheek.
"Just talk to her, if she likes you she'll flirt, take it from there," Draco supplied.
He was late for dinner, of course, but the food was still hot. Daphne sat across from him, Astoria to her right, Pansy to her left. Theo sat next to him, making conversation with one of the Carrow twins. When Draco, Crabbe and Goyal arrived from detention, they were flooded with questions about the fight. Draco, always one to take attention, gave a very detailed, slightly exaggerated, replay of the event.
"How's Alfie?" Draco tried to make nice conversation.
"I'm fine, enjoying the gold start treatment," Draco tried to comfort. He carefully moved his body to one side of the twin size bed. He ignored Potter's protests as he made room for his friend to sit next to him.
Draco huffed in sympathetic laughter, "I'm sure you could have pulled them off, they would have made you look dangerously mysterious."
Draco woke up.
Draco silently stood. His head begged for him to stop. His ear burned, smelling of burnt flesh and charred hair. His shoulder aching, his arm blistering and bleeding from the gash down his bicep.
Dumbledore nodded, waiting for Draco to continue.
"You don't have time to talk about it," Draco offered, his chest hurting for Potter.
"Malfoy," a familiar voice interrupted his thoughts.
Ding.
Draco felt something nudged his elbow. Potter had slipped a large book across the desk. Draco glanced around the room, everyone else had either fallen asleep or was facing forward. Even Pansy was looking the other way. No one would see.
"Yes."
Draco shrugged, his face red. "It could happen," he looked down at his hands.
Draco only shook his head. Daphne bit her lip.
"Graham, don't-" Pansy's voice broke his concentration.
He could do the right thing.
Impossible. The Changeling Candy he had confiscated from the Weasley twins months ago made the perfect cover. His blond hair was electric pink now. His steal eyes had turned dark. His body and face was dotted with thousands of freckles. He had picked the candies at random.
"It's alright, you have enough to worry about," Potter dodged the question.
Potter cared for him. He hurt for him. What did Draco do to deserve this tender compassion? He was dark, and twisted, he hurt people. Potter could never know what Draco has done, what he would do. Potter could never find out how much of a monster Draco really was.
"Why is Pansy the one pulling Daphne's hair then?" Blaise investigated.
"And none of us do," Theo commented.
Potter studied Draco, Draco met his eyes. What was Potter looking for? Eventually, he must have found whatever clue it was, because Potter continued to lead to way.
Draco felt as if he knew himself surprisingly well. He could almost always pinpoint the root of his feelings and pull them up like a weed to be disposed of. He knew that his constant need for validation is caused by his Father's constant disapproval and his Mother's cold nature. The pressure of being a Malfoy has caused a certain feeling of ownership over things that didn’t necessarily belong to him, that he tended to view himself as the automatic choice, even if he didn't have any claim to whatever he wanted at the time. He was also starved for genuine relationships, even if the idea of having to take personal responsibility for hurting someone else scared him. This caused him to keep everyone at a distance, keep his relationships superficial as possible. His parents approved of this distancing, which played into his need for approval and validation. This simply repeated the cycle of shitty feelings.
"You look like absolute shit," she greeted.
Daphne pulled away from Draco, putting her hand on his chest for support. "You want me to recruit Slytherin students for Potter's Army," she realized.
Severus leaned back in his chair, his hands resting on the arms. "Is 'adequate' enough to risk your life?"
That day may never come for him.
"We can't protect him if we don't know how," she spoke the same words he had spoken to her.
"How do you become a ghost?" his voice was small. He was too young to carry the burden of death.
"Draco! No, this is dangerous and I'm not going to be a part of it!" she yelled, fuming.
The giggles started again whenever Draco looked at Potter, who had his arms around his stomach in pain from laughing so hard.
Daphne would want to distance herself from him soon. He couldn't really blame her, he wouldn't want to marry himself. How could he expect her to? He couldn't. She would be unpredictable until he had her in his grasp. She would need an act of rebellion, Draco was determined to not face the consequences of her actions.
"Draco…?" A gentle familiar voice whispered from underneath his pillow.
"No-" she shook her head, stroking her hair, "no, you're not." She rested her chin on the hand, biting her lip. "My mother," she started, shifting in her seat. Pansy wouldn't stop moving, rubbing her chin, biting her nails, messing with her hair, her tie. She was nervously scared. Of Draco?
"Malfoy," the She Weasel stepped next to her father. She was glaring at Draco with a daring challenge. Draco blinked. Her gaze reminded him of a pair of bright blue eyes and the smell of cigarette smoke.
Potter wrapped his arms around Draco. His head buried his head into Draco's neck.
He sat back down. Stood back up. Sat pack down. This was the danger in arriving early, Draco hated waiting. He laid down on the couch, a pillow appearing as he rested his head. Draco watched the fire swirl and burn.
"Mother, please-"
"Please, please no," she begged, her face twisted.
Draco hummed in agreement, rearranging the potion bottles to his liking. He had to reach over in front of Potter to do so, but Potter didn't move out of his space. Draco didn't either.
"Fuck you, this was a bad idea," Potter stood from the couch.
The gift was a finely engraved pocket watch. A snake centered the carving on the lid. Pansy certainly knows how to work with a theme.
Draco was too tired to be angry, his shoulders slumped. He couldn't make mistakes, he knew this, he didn't have that privilege.
"Haven't you ever heard of knocking?" Draco cooled as Severus shut the door behind him. He instantly regraded his words as he took in his godfather's appearance. Severus's eyes were lined in red, as if he had been crying. He eyes were so full of sympathy Draco's stomach turned. Draco brought his knees to his chest, looking away from the grim sight of his godfather and to the gardens.
Mr. and Mrs. Greengrass were ordinary in appearance, but their backs were tight with stress. As Draco approached, he could see the fake smiles plastered onto their faces. They laughed painfully loud. They smiled too much. Complimented pathetically. They were trying too hard. They were scared.
"Will you just let me talk?" Potter argued.
The arm around his shoulders loosened, Draco thought Potter was about to separate himself, when he felt a hand caressed lightly over his spine. He let his shoulders dropped, his head still in his hands. He swallowed whenever he felt Potter nose at his neck, his hands removed from his face then replaced by Potter's touch on his cheek. His face was hot. Fire had settled at Potter's hand on his back, his touch on his cheek.
"But we're not surprised, I mean, no one else has shown their loyalty like you have," Crabb flattered.
Draco found the hallway in which McGonagall's classroom was in. Student filing into the hallway, Draco shoved his way through. Finally, he arrived at the classroom. The door was shut, so Draco knocked as politely as possible. He waited to hear a permission to enter, not wanting to intrude. He was just about to knock again when the door swung opened.
They continued to laugh, then cough through the smoke from their cigarettes.
"I can talk him into it," he shrugged, knowing Potter could be easily talked into saving people.
The tears stopped, but Potter didn't loosen his grip. He sniffed, laying his cheek on Draco shoulder, his face still wet. Draco's heart pounded in his chest, he couldn't steady his heart beat. He had done this to Potter. He had caused him to weep similar to when Potter had seen his friend killed. What sort of friend does that? How could Draco say he had Potter's best interest at heart only to turn around and make him weep?
But Pansy didn't pay any mind to Draco or Daphne. Instead, she focused on Montague. Laughing loudly at whatever he said. Draco took note of her long hair that was loose down her back, carefully curled. She didn't have much in the way of breast, her personal complaints, but even Draco noticed how high they were on her chest. She made up for her lack of cleavage by her uniform, which was unbuttoned generously. Her skirt also showed several inches of upper thigh, amplified by her heels with no knee high socks. She was very out of uniform.
Theo stood with Crabbe and Goyle. All avoided his gaze. Pansy paled when she saw him. She turned away from him.
She stared at him. He stared at her. He should threaten her. Make her promise not to try this again. Make sure he was safe in this castle.
"What does that have to do with anyth-"
Draco didn't budge, he needed his father to make the first move. The pair of them hadn't had a conversation in so long, Draco couldn't remember the last time they had talked alone.
"Oh, you mean my assignment to kill you?" Draco confirmed nonchalantly. "Did Severus happen to mention that?"
"It's not like I had a choice."
Crabb and Goyal just started at her, missing the point of excitement completely.
Draco strengthened his hold on Potter. This, them, wasn't going to work without honesty and trust. Draco should be honest with Potter. "Sit down," Draco pleaded.
Draco mocked, "Why, Mr. Potter, I will have you know that I am very handsome. You would think you could see that with your glasses."
"…We have to be quiet, we're out pass curfew."
"So that's how you do it," Draco whispered enough for Potter to hear. A grin formed on Potter's lips.
Silence echoed through the small private living quarters. Was Severus protecting him? Why would Severus feel the need to protect Draco form Dumbledore, a man Severus works for, would die for if needed?
The hoofprints left soft indents in the grass as he walked away.
For now, he focused on the problem he needed to fix. Before he could fix the cabinet, he had to understand what was twisted. What was broken. What was bent into a shape that had to be molded back. Magic was complicated.
He wished he could just be angry with her. Anger was simple, clear, understandable if unpredictable. Anger didn't come close to enclosing the feelings he had for his mother.
The girl he had helped last week had to be from a Muggle family. He would know her, or of her, if she was from wizards. She was resilient, but probably also the person to be most abused by other Slytherin students. Mystery Girl was too vulnerable for his liking.
Draco decided whenever Umbridge had turned a frightening shade of purple to intervene. "Professor, please." He gently grabbed the magazine. His gentle grip tightened whenever Umbridge started to hyperventilate. "Professor!" he yelled.
Draco entered the manor making sure to put the two smokes into his back pocket. He was quick to hurry through the hall and up the stairs onto the second story. No one was in the halls, the meeting was still going underway.
Lovegood and Potter started on the barricade. Draco ordered the others to hide. They only had seconds.
"I'm sorry," the truth escape from Draco mouth before he could stop.
Apparently Draco pisses off Severus by breathing these days. "No sir," he mumbled, knowing that he was going to lose whatever argument Severus thought they were having.
Draco's mouth opened, then closed. He paused. Open mouth, close mouth. Pause. Drink tea. "I…" he tried. Pansy laid her chin in her hand and raised her eyebrows with a knowing expression. "I… was not infatuated over Potter," he defended with some of his pride in tack.
"You have to protect your mind from the Dark Lord, the best way to begin is to clear your mind," Draco instructed.
"Yep," Draco agreed.
Draco and Daphne sat tightly next to each other, Daphne layered enchantments around them for sure privacy from eavesdroppers. The night was too early to meet in one of the lavatories, but the Common Room and dorms were almost surely empty. Precautions, however, were always a must.
“What do you care?” the bitterness poured out of her tiny voice.
The halls were still sleepily quiet as his footsteps sounded against the bricks besides the gentle chatter of the paintings. When Draco arrived to the Great Hall, few students were sitting at their tables. Potter was nowhere to be seen, he was probably still asleep. Draco walked to the Slytherin table. The only students sitting there were Pansy and Daphne, deep in conversation. Draco thought about sitting somewhere else, but Daphne noticed his presence before he could decide.
There was no point in trying to deny Potter's accusation, Potter could force Draco's hand in this with ease. That was for sure. Potter was too determined to get answers, Potter needed to be controlled.
"Really? You like a girl?" Draco teased.
Pansy froze at the question. Her eyes widened. "What… what do you mean?" she questioned.  "What are you talking about?"
"Come on, Blaise. We're going to be late!"
"Crabbe and Goyle?"
"You broke his leg?"
"I'm going to go back," Draco told him.
Towering shelves collapsed around them. Spells missed by inches. Footsteps loud behind them. Screams from seemingly everywhere.
Draco laughed, when he started, he couldn't stop. His rips hurt with the force of the laughter that was ripped from his chest. Potter snorted next to him, which caused him to practically fall of the couch laughing.
Potter gave him a confused look. "I mean, yeah, we talked that we weren't like that."
"Given that I am an accomplished Occlumens, yes, I do," Severus growled.
He bowed his head into the crook of his elbow, trying to protect himself against the overwhelming feeling. What could he do? What could his father, or anyone, do?
"Draco," Mrs. Zabini greeted with a soothing voice. Her voice was deep, raspy, and wonderfully smooth. She wore an elegant set of green robes embroidered with elaborate beading, thick black fur lined the collar. Blaise had obviously gotten his looks, and his sense of style, from his mother. "Have you happened to have seen my son?"
Draco sensed movement at his side, but he didn't turn to see who had sat next to him. Crabbe squared his jaw, but Goyle elbowed him in the ribs before he could say anything.
Potter's silence was defining. Cho was still crying silently. Potter seemed to slump with the emotional weight of Cho's grief. "I can't," Draco could barely hear him. "I'm sorry Cho, but I can't."
Draco watched him go, his stomach fluttering.
"Excellent, see you tonight," the twin peaked over Draco at Theo.
He turned suddenly, his eyes met hers as she moved to embrace him. She stopped. Draco shoved the books into her arms that he had been using as a shield. Pansy struggled with the heavy stack.
Silence.
"You wanted to speak with me, Professor?" Draco played dumb. He was getting tired of adults pretending they knew what was going on.
"Stop," his voice shacked.
"I can- Dumbledore, we can help you," Potter offered, his voice breaking, his eyes glassing over. Draco pulled him into a hug, Potter buried his face into Draco's chest. Draco's hand found the back of Potter's head, he rested his chin on Potter.           Potter's breathing deepened, he was trying not to cry, but his chest kept shaking with the acknowledgement of the danger Draco was in.
"You're overanalyzing this, Albus," Severus called to them.
The figure hadn't noticed him.
Upon his way to the Owlery, two giggling Hufflepuff girls came rushing down the stairs. This wouldn't be unusual, however they looked particularly guilty at the sight of him and for the fact that one of their hair turned bright blue. Draco let the pair scurry down the steps as he further investigated. He hurried up the tower, only to be met with a boy whose hair turned from brown the blond right before his eyes after eating something.
"We are?"
When Potter said his name so sweetly, he couldn't help but to smile. "Please forgive me," he begged, still smiling.
"How come I've never seen you before?" Draco asked, helping sort through the papers and books strewn throughout the hallway, their continence disorganized on the floor.
"I'm going out," he started as he tried to stand, but his legs felt too weak and soon began to shake. Goyle reached out for him, pulling  the weaker, shaken boy up without comment. Draco had found his wand and cloak after a pitiful stumble. He was hurrying towards the door when Blaise had called out, "Draco, you should get some-"
"Well, aren't you rude?" the ghost snapped.
His Lord walked over the corpse in one large step, seeming not to mind the blood on the end of his cloak. He studied the pale girl, as if only now seeing her in death. Draco looked at Daphne's face for the last time. Crimson ribbons braided themselves into the halo of blood hair. Her eyes bright in their blue depths, but lacking without a soul behind them. Their Lord poked her cheek with his toe, gently pushing her face so that Daphne's dead eyes were looking right into Draco's.   "It's a shame… you two would have made a handsome couple," his Lord spoke to Draco for the first time tonight.
"What's her name?" Potter asked.
Pansy gave a smile that only she could give. She leaned into Draco's space, cupping her hand around her mouth as she whispered, "Your fiancé was talking rather intimately to none other than Harry Potter in the halls this morning."
The host hurried away. Draco could feel eyes on him from Potter's direction. He swallowed. The shop was over crowded, as many tables as possible squeezed into the space. People had to turn sideways to shuffle through what little space was available.
Pansy remained silent next to him.
Shit. Draco shouldn't have gotten comfortable. Lupin tensed beside him. He took a long sip of his water. Draco's stomach coiled at the memory of his boggart.
I hear that your studies are going well. You have always rose to the expectations we have set for you. This winter be prepared to rise above even our sights to be the man you're expected to be.
"Getting involved with the Potter was a mistake, let me help you redeem yourself."
When they had last said goodbye to each other before the summer, Potter had kissed him. Squarely. On the lips. With his mouth.
All of the other dormmates had continued to breakfast. Draco and Blaise were the only ones in the room.
Potter's hand left his.
Draco snorted as he rolled his eyes, "we both already know the answer to that Headmaster."
"Your reaction could almost be considered a snap of temper, but you attacked Mr. Finnigan with surgical precision that suggests more thought," Dumbledore challenged. He leaned in his chair now, resting his hands on the armrest.
No one in the class moved. Blaise had stopped snickering from under his breath. Pansy had shrunk away from Draco, not wanting to be in the cross fire.
There was no breeze through the tight trees, but the weather was pleasant. Draco made his way to the creek that wasn't too far from the edge of the woods. He had waited for his grief to hit him at the burial, but no tears had come. Not even when Daphne's mother had sobbed through her eulogy. Nothing. He felt nothing.
"Nothing?" Severus questioned, "you didn't hear anything?"
The two men glanced at each other. Draco had been correct. They all knew he was able to handle himself from an attack. This wasn't about Draco's safety at Hogwarts.
"Then you and I both know what this means for us, right? Or do I have to spell that out for you too?" Theo was almost yelling now.
Worthless to Pansy. Worthless to Potter. Worthless to save a murdered family. Father. Mother. He was worthless to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord could sense weakness, could sense how little Draco could offer.
Draco nodded, "We should meet again soon, we need to strengthen your technique into something usable."
Draco helped himself to the cabinet, letting Potter unravel his mind in piece. "Let's get out of here," Potter was standing right behind Draco.
Astoria leveled him with a glare. Her brown eyes were red from crying. "I hate you."
Theo and Blaise just stared at him. His bookbag was held tightly against Theo's chest. Draco reached out for his bag, shocked at the amount of blood on his hand. He looked around, unless he wanted to wash his hands in the lake he would have to think of another way to clean himself.
Why couldn't anyone else see that?
"You're excused," Lucius hissed at the house elf, who excused themselves quickly, shutting the door quietly.
"That'll do it," Bulstrode snorted to Draco's vigorous nod in agreement. The crowd cheered as another plate of food flew through the air.
Draco's jaw clenched, he had wanted to change the subject, not push Potter away completely. He would have to be very careful with his next few words. "It's just…" he started, his voice as calming as he could, "whenever you're, we're, here their doesn’t seem to be a problem."
He swallowed passed the lump in his throat. He should do something for them, he has taken away so much already. "We will make the appropriate appearances, then we will be on our way," Draco offered. He ignored the surprise that flashed on everyone's faces. He wasn't the one to decide such matters. If his parents wanted to challenge him, he would make them bleed. This was the one mercy he could provide. He would be damned if he didn’t offer what little comfort he could.
They were probably on first name bases.
He froze, his head still in his hands. Potter was so close that he could feel his breath on his neck. A shiver ran through his spine. The arm around him tensed, Potter knew how he was reacting to his closeness. Draco waited for him to pull away, for the two of them to make jokes about whatever they would need to do to deescalate what was happening between them.
Draco continued to watch Potter, keeping an eye out for any wandering eyes from his social circle, but everyone was in conversation, or minding only themselves. Potter finally looked up from his stew, making eye contact with Draco. Draco gave a slight nod of acknowledgement, before shifting his eyes to the exit of the Great Hall and returning his eyes to Potter’s. Potter nodded in understanding.
Cold hands gripped Draco's shoulders tightly. "I have lost more than you will ever understand, you do best not to bite a helping hand."
"It's just not fair," Potter whispered. His eyes were glassy.
He had taken her life. He was her executioner.
"By now I think I should be good at that. I did duel a professor on the first day."
"Do what?" she asked stupidly.
He found the creek. He crystal clear water he remembered was brown. The massive current was a slow tickle. The girl he used to play with here was dead at his hand. Her body then used to the worst type of magic. Her sacrifice was never ending.
Theo was wide eyed, his mouth opened in shock. Blaise had his hand on Theo's arm, perhaps comforting him or holding him back. Draco sighed, Potter's interview was going to be more of an issue than he had originally thought. The abuse would only get worse if he continued to allow Finnigan to challenge him. He would have to fight, but if he did this right, he would only have to fight once.
He gasped against his swallows. His chills had steadied.
"What we are doing now is dangerous, don't play coy," she argued. Her voice was low but her expression sweet to the outside eye.
It was gone. The second he opened his eyes, he realized suddenly, the pain was no more. His adrenaline still ran in his veins. His heart still pounded in paranoia. There wasn't anything to run from, however. The pain had passed, he was fine.
Draco tried to step in between Zabini and the sight of the girl, a feeble attempt, but Zabini had already followed the sound to the grueling sight of the girl.
"I think that you're incomparable," Draco whispered. Potter was close enough to hear him clearly, Potter smiled in a gentle way that warmed Draco's chest before he took a step back, the distance didn't seem far to Draco.
"It's my old lady voice-" Potter explained before making his voice high "-who is it?"
How could he sleep so well? How could he stay calm in this situation?
"Merlin, Draco," Potter pulled his feet out of Draco's lap, sitting up and scooting over to sit right into Draco space. Potter's knee touching Draco's leg as he kept both feet on the couch. "You just…" Potter pinched his lips together in thought. "You deserve to be with someone who likes you, and I can't tell why you don't let yourself have that."
"Perhaps," her voice was blisteringly loud as she started to mock the Dark Lord, her voice high and shrill. The room froze. "Perhaps this, perhaps that," Daphne spoke from deep in her chest, practically growling. "Perhaps you have no fucking idea of how disgusting you are. Perhaps you're too stupid to see what is right in front of you. Maybe I was 'swept away by the romance,' what sort of bullshit is that?! I knew exactly what I was doing. I only wish I could have done more."
(See the end of the chapter for
"And how do you know that?" he snapped, his neck tensing.
Draco was given distance after his betrothal. No one had tried to comfort him, or talk to him about the role he was being forced to take. He was being forced into this, just as Daphne. Why didn't she recognized this?
Tears found their way into Draco's eyes at the feeling of Potter sobbing against him. Draco wouldn't let them spill. He took deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.
Draco allowed himself to be stunned into silence. "I can't be involved," he spoke quietly, "Don't rely on me to make any introductions."
He would see Potter soon, that would be nice. Potter with his kind eyes and warm smiles.
Someone opening the door made his eyes opened. His wand raised as Severus entered his room.
Myrtle floated so she was next to him. "You're right, no one ever comes in here." Her eyes were that of a child, but her soul was years beyond her looks.
"What about the song? Really, Draco, a song?" Potter pointed out.
"No, but I do have detention with him for a month," Draco corrected, taking a big bite of his dinner, having skipped lunch.
May disappeared as April approached. Students started to plan the small break to celebrate the beginning of spring. Anxiety curled in Draco stomach at returning home, but he pushed that aside to focus on his studies and Potter's continue education in Occlumency. His dreams were just getting worst. Potter had almost made it to the corridor in his dreams. His dreams that Draco suspected weren't just dreams, but he was grasping at straws for what else they could be.
"Do you know who's been invited?" Daphne casually asked.
Draco felt a twist in his stomach, the Ministry's hold on Hogwarts was tightening like a cobra squeezing the life out of prey. The feeling of claustrophobia at an unseen force settled in his lungs.
“Ah, yes, how can I forget second year? And last year? And....third year?” mocked Draco.
Draco took the lead. He sprinted to the exit. Potter right on his heels. The Order was keeping the Death Eaters too busy to grab them. They had a clean shot to the doorway.
Draco took a slow breath in, calming himself down. No one had overheard them, he was safe. For now.
"I'm so sorry," he confided.
Screaming, so much screaming. A mother screaming for her child, children screaming for their mother, hanging over their heads before a dreaded green light-
"Thanks," Draco whispered to Theo when Umbridge had left them.
He wished he could love her. He wished he could be the man who wouldn't slit her throat to save himself.
He couldn't. The possibility of just seeing Potter drove him forward with a force of excitement he didn't know he had.
Bright light shot from the students wands as they simultaneously casted
Silence filled the room, except for Severus's heavy breathing from shouting. He was right, which annoyed Draco more than anything. Draco's jaw clenched as he swallowed down his temper.
'Sure,' Draco agreed on the paper.
"Blaise," she confirmed.
"Not much better."
"Interesting… why would you want the sister of a traitor?" his Lord investigated.
Draco froze, his hands frozen mid-activity while he processes the information, not quite sure if he heard right. “...Well, that would do it,” was all Draco can say to her. The girl shrugged, Draco's curiosity got the better of him,  “is there a reason why you called Umbridge a frog-faced bitch?” Draco quipped.
'You forgot this.'
"Are you… what are you going to do now?" Potter asked quietly beside him.
Draco looked away when he saw some of his peers. He hadn't expected for his sin to have a known audience. He studied the gardens that could been seen through the large windows that lined one wall. The massive hall of the manor was lit by the large, extensive chandeliers that lined the center of the high ceilings. The moonlight didn't reach the room, as the chandeliers showered everyone in a gentle light. The moon was full, bathing the gardens in an ethereal glow.
Potter didn't say anything. His silence was enough of an answer. Draco instantly regretted this complication in their relationship, some things were better not spoken about. There had to be a way out, Draco could bend this situation to his needs.
Draco, for all intents and purposes, knew how kissing work. He had never actually done the deed. Never properly. Yet… Potter had kissed him.
Draco entered the Room of Hidden Things. He had arrived early, as he couldn't sleep. He was surprised to find Potter already there. Potter rose from the couch that was placed in front of the fireplace. He was dressed in Muggle jeans and a simple green jumper that brought out his eyes. Draco was also in day robes, pajamas seemed too intimate for what they were about to do.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Draco sneered as Potter moved to help him. There was hurt in Potter's eyes.
Pansy gave him a causal shrug, "Just thought you should know, sweetie," she winked. Her face was stone when she turned back to Draco, "Don't pull that shit with me again."
Severus snorted from behind him, where he was still leaning against the doorframe.
"Bullshit."
"I need you to do something," Draco began, he used the moment of privacy to his advantage.
Theo dropped the subject, his silence carried volumes.
Greyback rested his elbow on the wall beside Draco's head, leering at him.
"Eh, that's not necessary."
"Because I come to you with all of my problems." .
"I know you're okay," he defended himself, "stop changing the subject. Who's the girl?"
"Reminds me of someone I know."
"Of course it's not, because nothing ever is." Potter gently worked the healing salve into Draco's skin. This much work wasn't needed for bruised knuckles, but Draco was sure Potter knew that. He enjoyed Potter's touch too much to pull away.
"I…" this wasn't how Draco wanted to have this conversation, but when would he have the pair of them in the same room again? He had to take his chance. "Professor," he gathered Dumbledore's attention, "you've trusted me with Potter's mind, correct?"
Draco caught the box, Potter's face ended dangerously close to Draco's. The pair froze, their faces only a couple of inches apart.
Daphne nodded, pulling away from Draco and grabbing her bag. "And I assume Potter knows none of this?" she questioned.
"My Lord…" Draco began. His Lord looked down at him with slightly raised eyebrows, still walking leisurely. "I'm sorry," he made his voice break.
Draco's father sneered next to him, he pushed Draco aside so that he could draw himself to his full height. "What a displeasure Weasley."
So... Comments and kudos are always loved!
"Po-tter!" she singed across the classroom.
"But-"
Potter's smile was one of brilliance.
"Bring them in," his Lord spoke to the room, his voice like a stream over smooth rocks.
"Thank, Merlin, can we be done now?" Potter asked, a yuan escaping his lips.
Sweat started the collect on Draco's brow. He quietly adjusted his position from under the table. The voices became quiet, perhaps that had left? Draco hadn't heard the door open.
Umbridge dropped the magazine, standing with such ferocity that Draco stumbled back into his chair. Umbridge started screaming at such a velocity that Draco was dizzy. She slammed the door behind her, screaming for Filch.
"Interesting." Was all Dumbledore had to say.
Pansy, always one to gossip, taking to Crabb and Goyal. The poor bastards. She had her back to Draco, Crabb and Goyal both looking over her shoulders at him, silently begging for the sweet release of death. Draco shook his head, they were on their own.
Eventually, everyone dispersed. Draco was ordered to dress into the first of many layers of dress robes. Despite the fact that the ceremony wasn't for hours.
The fire Draco was facing warmed him and provided light for the book he was sure he was destined to never finish. Dinner had been surprisingly uneventful, as Pansy was tensely quiet. Theo had skipped dinner, Draco had assume because his meeting with Blaise in the owlery had gone well, as neither of them had been at dinner. Draco had made sure to steal some bread and cheese for the pair. Crabbe hadn't comment about earlier, Draco doubt he was even apologetic, but Crabbe was never one for social graces. Pansy could be bothered with social graces, but usually not in her anger. She had been unlike herself this semester, unfamiliar in her grief. The pressure she was under crushing her spirit. Draco had hoped, a tiny part of him in the back of his mind, that Pansy would get furious with him. He had hoped that she would fight him, hit him, anything would be better than this void between them.
His hands were so red against the white of the sink. Draco looked himself in the mirror. There was blood on his cheek, his neck, down to his chest and hands.
Draco couldn't keep the venom out of his voice, "I suppose to the same extent as you and Cho."
Draco smiled, "Good, I'm glad to hear that he's okay. Father didn't offer any explanation as to why Dobby wasn't a part of our home anymore, I always wondered what happened to him." He turned around, only to see that Potter had walked to him, eliminating the distance between them as always.
Draco crossed the warm, small room, untying his black cloak and laying the fabric on the cloak rack suddenly provided next to the fireplace. He then place the flat present wrapped in red paper on the low table suppled between the couch and the fireplace.
Draco let himself hold Potter. He was so angry at Bellatrix when she slipped away after Dumbledore entered the battle. So angry that he followed her, almost killed her in his grief. Draco had known this was a trap, that getting Potter separated was the plan all along, but Draco had followed anyway.
"And green brings out your eyes," Draco agreed.
Potter scratched the back of his head. "Yeah… It's just not easy with her, not like it is with you."
"Daphne, I don't disagree with you but Potter would never teach a group of kids the dark arts, I don't even think he knows them," Draco conflicted.
Draco asked, "Oh no, who are they?"
This knowing he was missed, that he was wanted, sent flutters in his stomach.
"Oh, what are you going to do? Are you finally going to stop hiding behind your older brothers?" Draco baited, Weasley had always challenged Draco verbally.
Numb acceptance was the only emotion he was met with. He was hollowed out. Whatever happened would happen, there was nothing he could do accept prepare for the worst.
Pansy stood to collect her supplies, Draco knocked her bookbag to the ground with his elbow. The two bent down to gather Pansy's things that had fallen out of the bag. She didn't say a word to him. Draco tried to ignore how quiet she was being, how scared she seemed.
Daphne had her eyebrows raised, her cheeks puffed as she blew out a slow breath.
"Always," Draco smiled at the image of his friend.
His chest burned, he couldn't take a breath. Panic curled into his lungs, he clutched his chest, gripping his shirt with both hands. Tears collected in the corners of his eyes in panic. He felt his stomach turn, his vision blurring at the edges. The walls closing in on him, burying him alive.
Draco knew this was an awful idea. When Potter bumped him in History of Magic, he had slipped a note into Draco's hand. The note had an awful rendition of Draco as a Professor, probably due to the lessons the pair had been sharing. Underneath the drawing, a scribbled note said 'Different time, same place. Meet me after the meeting.'
Theo grinned, returning the handkerchief. Theo steadied Draco with a gaze. "Draco," he started.
"Potter," he warned.
A warm hand was pressed into Draco's. "Let's go," Potter lead the way.
Draco's stomach twisted. His porridge was concrete in his mouth. They were scared of him. Scared to the point of kneeling rather than risk his anger. They had grown up together. All of them. Yet they look at him and saw nothing but a murderer. In their eyes, he was forever changed. Would they always see crimson ribbons in long blond hair when they looked at him? Would they always see him dripped in blood with an easy smile of his lips when they see him laugh? Would they always look at his hands, knowing he was able to take life like someone blew out a candle? Was he anything else?
A pair of bright green eyes met his. Sympathy so clear across Potter's face as Draco paled despite his attempts to steady his expression. They were surrounded by wolves who were starving.
Draco took his seat. Crabbe and Goyle pointedly looked down at their plates, not commenting on the blood that was still flowing from Draco's face onto his shirt. Daphne didn't look up from her copy of the Profit. Theo snorted. With a roll of his eyes Blaise snapped his wand to heal Draco's nose.
"Where did you get these?" he prompted.
Draco stood, his head heavy, his knees sore. He glared at Montague, who just looked down at him. The two boys stood, Draco had to look up at Montague, but he didn't back down. Montague had identified him as a target, this wouldn't end unless he put Montague in his place.
"Something like that."
Draco shallowed as he watched her go. He centered himself, his role clear.
Granger was unconscious. He gently looked through her coiled hair at the trauma to her skull. Concussion. Best if they didn't move her, but what choice did they have?
The only sound was Draco's spoon scrapping against the bowl. Whenever Draco finally looked up at his silent companion, Potter was just staring at him. Draco suddenly became too aware of their knees brushing together under the table. "You've seen me eat before, I don't know what's the big deal," Draco broke the silence.
His face felt swollen from crying. He wrapped his arms around his knees. He was trembling from the force of his panic that was dwindling.
Daphne blinked at him a couple of times. Draco raise his eyebrows. "My chair, darling," she prompted with a chilling smile. He looked at the space between his table at Potter's.
The halls were quiet as the last of the students filed into their classes. This was his off period, might as well try to get some work done on the cabinet. Maybe the room would create a couch for him to nap on for a few minutes.
Draco gave him a reassuring smile. He was met with a tired smile back, but Potter was standing so close.
"I know what it feels like to have someone you love murdered," she sympathized. "If you ever wanted to talk-"
Muggle children held the hands of their parents. Teenagers laughed between themselves. People milled around. Perhaps Draco had seen several of these faces before but only in glances over the years. The family he had witnessed murdered, maybe he had walked by that family before. Here. The place where he walked several times a year, off on his way to school. He found himself studying faces as he walked by the crowds, but what was the point? What was his memory worth at a glance if he was simply going to spill whatever blood was necessary?
Merlin, Draco was disgusting. He sighed, Daphne wasn't a bitch to be put on a leash. Class ended, Draco rose. Fuck, this was a shitty situation. Daphne would be at lunch. Draco could pretend not to know, but Pansy would probably tell Daphne that he knew soon. He could say that he was waiting for Daphne to tell them, Daphne could call Draco a goddamn lair. He made his way to lunch, Daphne had been acting fine all day. She was a better lair then he suspected. She was dangerous.
"It's not like that," she defended.
"Is that so? Confident are we?" Draco teased.
He gathered the items in his pockets, putting them in his hands. He turned on the lavatory light, the harsh white light making him wince. Draco dropped into the sink the; two cigarettes, the cleaned knife, the bloody handkerchief, and Daphne's zippo lighter.
"You really want to know," Potter grinned at him. "Promise you won't be mad?"
Draco turned on the faucet and he cupped the clear water in his hands, bringing the smooth liquid to his lips. He swallowed the cool liquid, though that did little to ease his harsh throat. When the water wasn’t enough, he leaned down to greedily drink from the steady stream of water itself.
Lovegood rushed passed him. She yanked Weasley into the room behind her.
"I have my suspicions, would you mind confirming them?" Dumbledore explained.
Severus's shock on his face was crystal clear. Draco turned to talk to Dumbledore, "What do you want?" Draco asked bluntly.
Pansy pulled away from them, walking to the dorms, "I need you to let me help myself."
Her tears fell into brown hair as the pair stared at each other. She hated him with something that burned inside of her. He didn't know what he would do if this continued. Maybe some part of him didn't want this to end.
Potter's hand was still in his.
"I have only my mother to thanks, you know how pure blooded mothers are," he grinned.
"That's four too many," Severus snapped, "this shouldn't even be happening."
"No scones until we talk ab-"
Warmth blossomed in Draco's chest. He felt almost lighter. "It was a honor," Draco spoke the truth. He didn’t have to lie about this, not with Potter. He was always his favorite version of himself with Potter.
There was an icepick in his chest that Draco swallowed down. Blaise gave him a confused glance. Draco turned his head to look out the window to hide his face.
He was yanked by his ankle high into the air. He gripped his wand with all his might. He moved to cast at the person by the corner, but had to change to shield himself from a stunning spell from the person that had been following him. This was a trap.
“Do I get to know where we’re going now?” Draco tried to lighten the mood.
"I've never hated you," Draco confided. Potter looked up at Draco for the first time, his eyes bright. Eyes that made Draco honest. "I was jealous of you, you were everything that I wanted to be, so I was bitter. I don't know, it all seems so stupid now," Draco admitted. Such childish jealousy seemed pointless in the face of war.
"I think you know, Mafalda."
She was going to use an Unforgivable on Potter. She was going to torture him into telling her information that didn't exist. Umbridge raised her wand. Draco had his hand on his wand, he would kill her before anything happened to Potter.
"Potter," Draco covered Potter's hand on his, "I'm fine. You know I can handle myself, you don't need to worry."
Draco leaned into her, "Oh please, whatever someone tells you they tell me, everyone knows that," he hissed.
"If, let's say, I'm devoted to Potter?" Draco asked.
Daphne's mother hit the floor on her knees in relief. Daphne's eyes widened, she looked up, hope so clear on her face.  "Thank you," she whispered, tears running down her face. Her shoulders slacked as the tension left her body.
"Potter, I'm not dating Daphne," Draco offered.
"And what exactly were you two doing to excuse all of us being late to dinner?" Severus articulated.
A drop of a pen could be heard in the silence that followed.
Draco swallowed down the lump in his throat. She was so honest. What was her motivation? Why be genuine now? What did she have to get out of this?
"But you didn't just win," Mafalda noted.
"Potter, stop, just… tell me what's bothering you," Draco reached for Potter, taking his wrist. "This isn't going to work out if we don't trust each other."
Someone stepped into the entrance of the hall. Her blond hair seemed to shine in the sunlight shining through the large windows of the grand entrance. She was wearing pale blue robes, her long hair was flowing down past her shoulders. Pale skin was glowing.
"So you are upset that you lost to Potter."
Draco looked away, closing his eyes, not wanting to get involved, but too curious to move. What could he do? There was no way to appeal to a sense of unity now, the Slytherins had broken into pieces, that much was clear. There was nothing he could do. All he could do was watch. He swallowed passed the familiar feeling of helplessness. 'This is nothing like that,' he reasoned. A coil of panic was swarming in his stomach, he swallowed past the lump in his throat.
This was the first real confrontation Draco was faced with the subject. He could not offer real support, Blaise must of known that, but Draco could give Blaise his understanding. This did not come at a price.
Draco had honestly no clue what he had done to anger Severus to this degree. Draco was a star pupil, Severus was his mentor, his godfather. Whatever Draco had done, Severus had taken the offense personally. There was no way out of this unscathed. Draco was raised, however, by Lucius Malfoy. Draco had been taught self-preservation at a young age. For all his pride laced into his heart, Draco knew how to humble himself, even if the act left acid in his mouth. So, he lowered his eyes and didn't say anything.
"Harry, I- you didn't misread anything," Draco's cheeks flushed. "I just- I do have feelings for you, I think they're pretty apparent. Everything is just so…complicated."
Potter tilted his head as he grinned, "I'm going to need you to write that down." Potter dug through his pockets before pulling out an half eaten bar of chocolate. He broke the bar in half, handing the larger piece to Draco. Draco took the piece. Potter looked incredibly pleased with himself. Bringing the chocolate to his mouth, Draco took a bite. He pinched his eyes together in slight confusion. Why was Potter so pleased with himself? Did he do something to the chocolate?
Draco left, the crowd parting for him, for the apparent authority he now carried. Potter looked puzzled at the events he just witnessed, turning to Granger for her to explain the situation.
Cedric changed to the muggle child Draco watched his Lord kill in fifth year. The child changed to their mother. He swallowed another tooth. The mother changed to Astoria. Astoria changed to Draco's mother, who changed to Bones.
Draco wiped his check with the back of his hand. Fury licking up his spine. His teeth bared with the violation. "Yeah no shit," he snapped as he lashed out. He went to leave, to hurry to the door.
Taking his tea from the floating tray, Draco laughed dryly, "Thank you, headmaster. It was well earned."
Pansy cradled the bottle to her stomach.
His knees hit the damp grown as he accepted the stones that bruised his body. They hit his arms, his chest, his shoulders. They almost hurt as much as raising his wand to steal Daphne's memories.
The side exit opened into the Manor's extensive gardens. Draco let himself pause, breathing in the cool night air that only smelt of copper from his body soaked in blood. The gardens were glowing in the pale light of the moon. Blood looks black in the moonlight.
"Do you-" Potter blinked at how big, how solid, his voice sounded in this chamber.
"They have to know the basic before they can fight," Draco defended.
The door opened as Draco continued to yell. Snape frowned as he glared at Draco. Draco gasped, "Someone's in the toilet."
"Zabini, he's… isolated," Draco explained.
He let the routine warm him, he pulled away from the window to face Daphne. She smiled gently as she blew smoke from her lips.
He walked around the gardens, along the high walls of the grounds. Mother, at his request, arranged for the ceremony to be placed outside in the gardens. Daphne would make her grand appearance by walking down the stairs, through the crowd to be presented to Draco as a debutante if he had remembered .
Umbridge smiled at Draco's statement. "Yes well, I only wished I could do more," Umbridge answered.
What would Potter do?
"You ruined my broom!" Draco grinned.
Silence filled the room, making Draco itch with embarrassment. Potter was just standing there, staring at Draco, which, Draco reasoned, was probably Potter's way of getting back at him for the embarrassment in the lavatory earlier that night.
"Yes," she sobbed, she was standing on glass that was cracking all around her. "Yes, my Lord, I made a mistake. A stupid, stupid, mistake." Tears of terror ran down her eyes. The brave girl that Draco knew was gone, crushed under the probability of her death. She stumbled over her words, unable to say anything clearly through her quivering chin. Her face was hot in color, wet from tears and snot. She was trembling.
"Well, you would be a giant dick, for starters," was Draco's insight.
"I was hoping to discuss what happened with you before any punishment is decided," Dumbledore explained.
Potter rolled his eyes, "Oh please, the first time I tried to talk to the girl I liked, I was covered in Stinksap. I'm sure you're doing fine."
He didn't feel anything as he watched his parents scream at each other. He wasn't able to feel anything at all. He did know, without uncertainty, that his parents were too close to the Dark Lord. If Draco wanted to gain his Lord's favor, then his own parents would have to believe that he was capable in his cruelty. Draco would have to push them away.
Zabini's eyes tightened as he watched Draco step out of himself. Draco's expression turned into stone. His back straightened with the confidence of someone who shook hands with grief often. His voice was cold, "I appreciate your concern, Zabini." He walked away from the only kindness offered to him in so long.
"Knows what, Draco?" she interrupted.
“Oi, Malfoy!” someone yelled at Draco, followed by the rush of hurried, loud feet within the hallway.
He continued walking, this time paying attention to his surroundings. He couldn't afford not to.
Draco leaned in his seat, his trap having been set, "So you trust me?" he asked quietly.
Draco followed Pansy's movement while he ate his dinner, making sure she wasn't just moving the food around on her plate for appearances. Everyone continued with their dinner, wrapped in their own worries. Blaise must have felt confident in this fact “I don’t think I can handle much more of this,” he whispered to Draco. Giving the blonde a chance to ignore him. A way out, if Draco needed it. The words only traveled between the two, a private conversation.
"No I don't," Potter instantly defended.
"You disgusting-" she growled at Draco. Lucius grabbed Narcisa's arm as she stalked to Draco. Narcisa shoved Lucius away, who hit the floor as he lost his balance, his cane snapping away from under him.
"Really?" he raised his eyebrows mockingly, "I couldn't tell, give them to me," he held out his hand.
Draco casted a spell for burns on his arm, but to no avail. He wasn't expecting simple healing spells to work on whatever dark magic Dolohov had wielded.
Potter's breath feathered against his lips. Draco's lips parted. Potter's hand cupped Draco's jaw, tilting his head closer. Their noses touched, their lips almost touching.
"I think they're waiting to tell me until the break," Draco explained to Daphne.
Draco turned into the direction of the hurried steps that belonged to the annoyance. “What do you want, Potter?” he sneered loudly, while taking notice of the annoying lack of effect it had on the boy in front of him. Potter hurried to catch up with him, his breath quickening. The students within the hall didn't even glance at the pair, who were usually this cordial to each other.
He wasn't hungry enough to eat. He let the food get cold as he got dressed in simple robes. Definitely not the robes he would wear to the ceremony this evening, those were hanging up in his wardrobe. He had spent three hours getting measured two days ago. His mother made sure very stitch was perfect.
Draco tensed, his shoulders tight. "Appearances keep us alive in this world," he glared at the two, "both of you will do what you need to. I'll keep your secret as long as it is convenient, so don't be stupid," his lectured harshly.
"What the fuck was that?" Potter burst into laughter.
"My apologies, please, sit," Umbridge motioned towards the pink chair across from her pink desk. Draco took his place. "Tea?" Umbridge offered, as she raised her wand to the tea set, pink, that laid on a table, pink, across the room.
She smiled, "Why, aren't we being the gentleman?"
The question wasn't if they were going to win-
No matter, he had to get back to work.
Draco clenched his jaw as the fake laughter continued. He should go to bed, but he still had homework to catch up on. The library was going to close soon. He focused on finishing his assignments quickly.
"Keep an eye on her? As if she's some misbehaving child? Merlin, Draco, get your head out of your ass and help your friend," Daphne snapped.
"Yes sir," Draco grumbled.
“Agreeable,” Draco said. Like a fucking prick.
He shrugged at the pair. They made vague motions which Draco understood as permission to be an asshole. "That seat is taken," he started, turning to look at Potter. Potter was trying his best not to look guilty.
"So… dueling a professor on the first day of school," Draco brought up whenever they were sure they wouldn't be interrupted.
"But how are we supposed to defend ourselves if we don't know what we are defending ourselves from?" Daphne argued.
"Yes you do," she argued. "You know exactly what I am talking about."
A lot of people wanted things they could not have.
He had taken her memories. He was her vandal.
Potter nodded vigorously, "If he knows what's good for him. It kind of makes it seem like you were pulling your punches whenever we got into a fight."
"I agree," she grinned, "you're in love with Harry Potter," she assured.
Potter then grabbed Draco shoulder, he squeezed reassuringly. "Meet me tonight?" he asked, hand still on Draco's shoulder.
"You can see them?" Theo asked him.
Draco sighed, they were going to be the death of him.
Draco sighed, "You're the only one that can fight against my Lord and win, Headmaster."
The jerk of tripping interrupted his thoughts. He hit the floor. His bookbag spilled, his cheek hit the floor. His head throbbed as he turned to see who was responsible, probably one of the Weasley twins getting back at him for turning in their business. Montague stood over him. Fuck. A couple of Gryffindor trouble makers was one thing, the Slytherin Quidditch Captain was another. Montague sneered at him, towering over Draco, who had rose to his knees.
"Ah! Three. You made captain."
"This is so great."
His mother holding his hand in hers, silently begging him not to attract any attention to them.
Draco twisted in Potter's arms, facing him, reaching up to grip Potter by the neck of his Quidditch Uniform. Potter stilled suddenly, his gaze heavy on Draco's face. Draco suddenly realized how close they were, close enough for Draco to feel Potter's breath on his face, close enough for Draco to count Potter's many eyelashes.
"But you forget one very important thing," he continued.
"Goodnight, Malfoy," Potter offered, a small smile on his lips.
"What? Why?" Potter asked.
Draco opened his mouth to say something clever, but he couldn't stop smiling over the compliment. He looked down at his hands in his lap, a blush hot on his neck. He glanced at Potter, who was grinning back at him, aware of his affect. Draco couldn't bear to lose him, lose this relationship between them. He couldn't lose his only true friend untainted by war.
"I'm here for you," Astoria was so gentle with her.
"Is this mysterious someone important enough to tell her betrothed?" his jaw was so tense that it was painful.
"What the fuck?" a particularly boisterous boy swore.
"Yeah," she answered.
"Don't be stupid," he stated, his voice steady despite the heat in his chest.
They traveled down the well walked path, following their fellow students. Draco hadn't slowed his pace as he normally would from prying ears. Instead, he ensured their conversation could be overheard on the path. Daphne took the hint, she always did, as they talked about their classes and friends. Perfectly innocent, and predictable, topics of conversation.
"Are you scared?" he asked.
"Didn't I?"
His knees shook as he made himself follow the voices. He recognized Potter's voice, but he could make out the words. Draco crouched has he moved closer to the group. His back was flat against one of the towering shelves as he hid behind a corner.
There has to be a strength in someone's soul to make their son strong.
He had finally stepped out of the cold water. He wrapped a towel around his waist before stepping out into his room.
"What's that supposed to be?" Draco asked through his laughter. He felt dizzy in how light he was.
"What are you apologizing for, Draco?" his Lord used his first name in conversation.
Draco gasped for a breath just out of reach, feeling the stillness next to him.
Draco met Pansy's gaze, she confirmed his suspicions. How did he miss this? Why didn't Daphne tell him? Arranged marriages had been a long tradition of the pure blooded culture, but betrothed at fifteen? Betrothal ceremonies had been dismissed a long time ago. If Draco remembered correctly, the last betrothal ceremony happened over seventy years ago, even then the ceremony was looked down upon. Most arranged marriages were simply gentlemen's agreements these days, but Draco didn't know anyone who had their marriage arranged. The tradition had simply died out. For good reasons too.
The constant ticking of clock hands made Draco sweat.
"Because you said you were just friends," argued Potter.
He turned as Daphne yelled. Montague had her by the collar, shaking her. He let her go as Blaise tackled him to the ground, only getting a couple punches in before Montague gave one blistering punch across his jaw. Blaise was shoved off, but Montague just bore into him.
"Please," Potter begged. "Please, I can be better." He shook Draco by his cloak. Draco couldn't move, he hadn't seen Potter cry like this since Cedric had died.
“I need to talk to you,” Potter hushed, leaning in against the passing students within the hall.
"Granger I can understand, but Potter-"
His father probably seemed ever regal to the outside eye, but Draco knew better. With practiced perfection Lucius had pulled his hair back into a braid, his clothing was perfectly laced and embordered. However, Draco noted that he was leaning more heavily on his cane that he used for his knee. His eyes were dulled and his cheeks had sunken deeper into his face, making his cheekbones almost unnaturally prominent. Do to his carefully tailored robes, the fact that Lucius had lost weight was not hidden. The Dark Lord's presence in Malfoy Manor had taken a toll.
Pansy sneered, "He probably almost keeled over because of the stress of raising a littler of weasels on a penny a day."
"Wait, what's up?"
Pansy flinched, but flowed Draco out of the Common Room. She was silent as she walked behind Draco, letting him lead her through the silent halls into an abandon dungeon. There were no torches this deep down into the castle, Draco cast a spell over their heads which provided a clear, yellow light. He then charmed the room to be silent to outside ears. His back was to Pansy, his stomach turned painfully. He should apologize, there are so many things he should apologize for. He doesn't know how.
Well shit, Draco thought. Potter must have been aware of Draco’s knowledge of the army for a least a couple of weeks now, but he did nothing to change the army’s tactics at all. Which means, Potter wanted to see how dedicated to his secret Draco was. Potter could easily know that Draco has been covering for Dumbledore's Army since they first started meeting, making the rest of Umbridge’s minions run around in circles. Potter just manipulated Draco into playing his entire hand, and by simply doing nothing but observing.
Bellatrix casted a spell at Potter before Draco could even draw his wand.
"At least our babies will be pretty," Daphne tried to break the weight between them.
He kept his sight down on the leaves he was chopping, but he could feel the heat of Pansy's glare on his face.
The smile that found its way onto Draco's lips was a cold one. "I thought so."
Draco closed his book, he was just reading about Doxy venom, he turned in his chair to face Pansy. He reached out for her, taking her hands in his. "Pansy, talk to me," he pleated.
Where was his wand?
"Since you met at the Hog's Head. Really Potter, you’ve only had, what, three meetings? You have to be more careful," Draco showed off.
"When?"
"Shouldn't you be with the Weasley's? Your shadows will be wondering where you went off to," Draco teased. "Or are they too busy sucking face to notice?"
With Umbridge as the Dark Arts professor, his education was becoming limited, so Draco clawed for any scrap of knowledge that could become useful. Whether the subject was potions or magical creatures, ancient ruins or charms, arithmancy or herbology, Draco was determined to strengthen his mind.
He opened his eyes. Twelve identical black doors surrounded Draco in the circular hall. All tall, black and looming like gods judging him for his crimes.
He shrugged, "I did say his mother's pussy was dry then proceeded to make him cry in front of everyone."
"Things were just starting to get better, but Potter had to go and ruin it," Theo argued.
Did Draco kill her trying to protect her?
He couldn't move. He heard Daphne gasp. Lucius froze, his hand still in the air. Lucius had never hit his son before. Daphne's breaths were the only thing Draco could hear against his rushing blood. Lucius lowered his hand as Draco faced him. He swallowed his anger down so that it coiled hotly in his stomach.
"It's not your fault."
Love.
The wardrobe disappeared, so did the present.
Draco reached out to Potter as he heard someone speak. "Ron!" Potter turned the corner of a large tank. Draco's heart burst from his chest as Potter rushed out of his sight. "Careless moron," Draco mumbled under his breath, his hands too full of Granger to pull his wand out.
Hi my dudes!
"Oh," Draco felt his eyes itch, "thank you." He could feel his godfather's eyes studying him as he ate. A wall had gone up between them last year, now they had to discover how to talk over it.
"I'm feeling generous," Draco commented.
Draco turned, his ears listening for any sound. He swore he had heard something.
They walked to lunch. Pansy didn't ask for more clarification, a mercy. Draco had to dodge Pansy's attempt at a healing spell, cupping his pulsing nose as he elbowed Pansy's wand away from his face. Healing spells required a certain softness that Draco was sure Pansy lacked.
The silence was heavy between the three of them. Daphne, who apparently was suicidal, just continued smoking.
