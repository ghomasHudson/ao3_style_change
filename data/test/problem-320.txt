At this point, they had reached the front of the line. Filch checked their notes, muttering under his breath. He scanned Draco's with barely a glance, but glared suspiciously at Potter's for a long moment as though he suspected it of being a forgery.
Malfoy seemed to digest this information. He shook his head as if trying to shuffle what he had just heard into some sort of logic.
Harry pushed aside the thought.
Draco felt Potter shift uncomfortably beside him, and realized he was not the only one who was uneasy. Still, it irritated him slightly that Potter couldn't seem to be in close-quarters with Draco without being restless. It was because of this short-temperedness that he said rather waspishly, "What is it, Potter?"
in which pansy likes girls and the shack is not haunted
Draco stared at him in amazement. "That's what I always say!"
Pansy groaned and shoved Draco from her lap, inciting a muffled protest as he fell to the floor in a heap.
Harry sighed. "Hagrid said they were proud, and intelligent. You should've known better. You did a good job getting him to bow and all, you just shouldn't have pushed it."
"No?"
"What is it now, Malfoy?" he sighed.
"Hurry up, you filthy Squib!" Draco snapped. "Stop trying to find something wrong with Potter's note and let us through. You can see it's perfectly in order. My father will hear about this! This school is going to the dogs. You're holding us up for no reason. No, get your grimy hands off me, you daft-!"
"Fine, Potter. But, you helped that bloody chicken escape?"
Harry was dumbfounded. He'd been trying to impress him? It made sense . . . a little. But, Malfoy hadn't even known he was Harry Potter, back then. That was . . . interesting.
"Chicke- Buckbeak?"
He and Malfoy drifted around for a while, searching wildly, to no avail, until Malfoy suddenly hurtled straight at Harry. Harry, startled, jerked his broom away and caught sight of a golden flicker at the edge of his vision.
"You set him free!"
"Just answer the damn question, Potter." Malfoy spat. Harry glared at him, then relented.
"Don't say his name, Potter."
"I- er."
Potter sighed. Never mind, Malfoy. Nevertheless, you're right."
"Did she- she thought we were on a- a date!"
"You're clearly using a practice Snitch, Potter."
"More luck. If Fawkes hadn't come and gouged out the Basilisk's eyes and given me the sword, I never would have beaten Riddle."
He arched an eyebrow, awaiting an answer.
"You make no sense, you know that, darling? If only Potter could see this side of you . . . Carefree, innocent-"
"N-no! A Malfoy never b-backs down!" Malfoy managed to gasp out. Harry privately thought that wasn't so true- he'd seen Mr. Malfoy back down to an angry house-elf and a runty, bloody, scraggly, and tired twelve-year-old with one sock. He chose not to comment.
"It did!"
Madam Puddifoot straightened up at the praise, smiling fondly despite her embarassment.
"Yeah. I remember that. You were a self-satisfied, pointy little git. Bragging about your broom and your blood status. I had no clue what you were on about, but I despised you right away."
Draco stood there, under the mistletoe by himself, for a long moment, watching the retreating forms of his- his friends.
Draco walked to the Entrance Hall as soon as he could, wearing a dark green knitted sweater and black jeans, the outfit Pansy had finally given the go-ahead. You must look your best, darling, she'd trilled. As Draco neared the great oak doors, approaching the already decent-sized gathering of students in line, he began to worry that Potter wouldn't show up. He would change his mind, he'd think it was a trick, he'd realize- "Malfoy!"
Draco looked at him oddly. "You think of family when you look at this Shack?" Draco saw an opening for a million cruel jokes, but chose not to comment. Instead, he asked, "Why?"
Harry suppressed a groan. "And why is that, Malfoy?"
"Go ahead. Be offended."
"-and I got poisoned by one of its fangs. After all that, I still would've died if it hadn't been for Fawkes healing me. Why're you defending me against myself, anyway? I thought I was an attention-seeking prat."
"Potter, do you remember when we met?"
"Besides, I know how you can ask him. Just act as if you have no other options. You could say that Blaise and I are out on a date, and that we're insufferable to be around, and you could say Crabbe and Goyle have detention or something of the sort."
"A what?"
"No. I nicked it all from the kitchens before I left to go to the Entrance Hall."
Malfoy was snarling at Filch, whose eyes bulged with fury. Filch held Malfoy's arms behind Malfoy's back as Malfoy struggled. Harry, to his own shock and consternation, had to suppress a laugh at Malfoy's peculiar defense of him.
"Am I what, Potter?"
Harry thought for a moment. "What could you possibly want to know? Everyone knows all about me already."
Pansy squealed happily. "Draco, darling, that's wonderful news!"
No? Yes, Draco, you fool! Honestly!
They walked in silence for a while, and it was when they reached Hogsmeade that Malfoy broke the silence.
Oddly enough, Harry was still gripping Malfoy's arm as they walked through the gate and towards Hogsmeade. Stranger still was that neither of them mentioned it. Without needing to discuss it, they went the long way to Hogsmeade, avoiding other people. The farther they got from the castle, the more free Malfoy seemed, quicker to smile at small things like birds chasing each other, or small animals scampering up trees. Then he caught Harry looking at him and scowled. Maybe he hadn't changed too much after all, Harry thought.
"Ah, two coffees, please, Madam. And it's quite alright, I understand that it's an easy mistake to make. No harm done," Draco said smoothly. "And I'd just like to say that I think it's wonderful to see someone so welcoming to all people. And the decorations are quite nice."
Malfoy sighed, running a hand through his shiny, blonde, perfectly styled hair, his frustration evident. Clearly, Harry thought, Malfoy hadn't expected this much of a fuss. Harry felt some satisfaction at having aggravated Malfoy.
"Well, when my parents were alive, the Dursleys hated them. They never associated with them. Aunt Petunia was my mum's sister, and she thought my mum was a freak for having magic, and hated my father. When Voldemort killed my parents, Dumbledore dropped me off at the Dursleys, since they were my only relatives, and Sirius was in Azkaban."
"Yes! Yes, I am, alright? Do you have an issue with that, Potter?"
"That's . . . but, do you believe that?" Harry asked. He needed to know. He needed to, because if Malfoy didn't truly believe that, then . . .
It was true Harry rather enjoyed his bickering with Malfoy- though he left each exchange in an openly foul mood, he privately embraced the time he spent fighting against the good-looking Slytherin. He liked getting a rise out of him, and even though Malfoy was a git, if, for some reason, their arguments were put to an end, Harry was sure he would secretly miss them- and Malfoy- a lot. All this passed through his head in a moment, and he found himself replying.
Draco's POV
"You go through a door in the entrance hall and take the stairs down. There's a corridor with a painting of a bowl of fruit. You tickle the pear, and it giggles and lets you in."
Harry cracked a grin. "Dursleys." Malfoy waved the name away dismissively. "And they just don't like me."
Harry snorted. "No chance of that, Malfoy." As they walked, they made an unspoken agreement to go the long way to Hogsmeade again, through the gate and then wandering here and there. The day was crisp and cold, pristine white snow lining the streets. The whole place had an air of Christmas- it was the last weekend before term's end. Harry pulled out the food he had stored in his pockets. Malfoy eyed it suspiciously.
"Why not?" Harry grinned. "Scared I'll beat you? You ought to be used to it by now."
"Magic that is unpredictable, and is triggered by emotions. It explodes out of you at inconvenient times, and most Obscurials don't live long."
Scared! Him! As if! Although, he wondered how Potter knew with such confidence that the Shack was not haunted. Perhaps he'd ask. Next time. Until then . . .
"I knew it! I-"
Without thinking, Harry grabbed Malfoy's arm, inciting mild protest from the pale blond, and pulled him on their way to Hogsmeade in the bright November sunlight, before they were both given detentions.
"All I'm saying is, I'm famous for things other people did. I'm not special at all."
"Though, I don't really want to stop bickering with you. It sort of brings some . . . excitement to the place. Hogwarts doesn't really need more excitement, of course, but . . ."
"Well, Potter, how about you tell me about yourself, then?"
"I can and I will. The only reason I'm alive is because of my mother. Not because I'm special. She sacrificed her life for me, that's why Voldemo-"
"That doesn't concern you, Potter."
Pansy snorted. "Like you don't like getting a rise out of him? Draco, darling, look at me." She leaned forward and grasped his face, squishing his cheeks until he was looking her in the eye. "I'm telling you, he will say yes. And if he doesn't, you ask again another time. Alright?"
Then Harry saw a glint of gold and shot forward. Malfoy startled, then followed. Harry rocketed towards the little ball, hand outstretched, and then- bam! Malfoy had slammed right into him, sending him spinning and nearly falling off his broom. It only took a moment, but the Snitch was gone, lost in the swirling snow. Glaring at Malfoy, Harry shook himself off and floated a bit higher, scanning the air for any sign of the Snitch.
"F-fine!" The woman looked as if she were struggling some painful, internal struggle, then she spat, "You can have it for eight Galleons, if you get out of my shop right after!"
"Ah. Makes sense," Harry said. Then he furrowed his brow. "But Wood has us practice with the Snitch all the time. How can the Snitch for the game know who touched it first if we use it for practice?"
"Well, would you be accompanying me, Ron and Hermione?" Harry asked, watching Malfoy's expression carefully. Malfoy froze for a moment, light eyebrows furrowing ever so slightly.
in which they sort of reach an understanding
Obviously he didn't. What was Draco even saying?
Malfoy made his way towards him, giving a curt little wave and a smirk.
Harry stared at Malfoy angrily. "What? No!"
"No, it most certainly is not, Potter."
Malfoy scowled for a moment, before smirking, "Well, Potter, you see, I was talking to Crabbe here," he gestured carelessly behind his left shoulder to where Crabbe was standing like a small boulder, "And we were wondering if you would be going to Hogsmeade this year, or if you'd be staying back, all by yourself, again, like the pathetic prat you are. Well?"
"No, I'm just . . . Don't you ever have to change yourself to fit what people want or expect you to be?"
Draco tilted his head quizzically. "What is Holmes?"
Harry wrinkled his nose in confusion. "Impress me?"
"Because!" Malfoy sounded frustrated. "I'm expected to have certain opinions, certain beliefs!"
"Indeed."
"Thanks. But yes, absolutely, Potter. They absolutely have ulterior motives." I'm sure Pansy's told Granger all about my little crush. "In fact, I'm terrified."
Draco glanced at Potter, who had been watching the exchange with interest.
Potter stared at Draco incredulously, so Draco felt as if he were being scrutinized intensely. Of course Potter wouldn't tell him- Draco hadn't told Potter if he fancied anyone.
Draco fixed on one thing from that phrase and felt a need to inquire. "Next time, Potter? Will there be a next time?" Maybe next time, if there was to be a next time, he'd learn some answers to the many questions he had about Potter.
"Seven!" she exclaimed. "Nine and no less!"
"I feel so much better, I'm sure."
The next hour passed in relative comfort and friendly discussion, and soon Draco's stomach hurt from laughter. He glanced at Potter, who was flushed and looked like he was close to having tears of mirth in his eyes from Pansy's lively (and extremely bawdy), anecdote.
"Er, d'you want the simple answer, or the detailed one?"
Draco couldn't keep a triumphant grin off his face, watching Pansy and the girl she secretly, yet somewhat obviously, took a fancy to walking down the street together.
Malfoy glanced at him while taking another pasty. "That's not true, Potter. People think they know you. There's a difference. Do they know the things that make you you? Or do they know surface facts- Quidditch player, Gryffindor, famous?"
"Fine, Potter."
"First things first. My Dobby? My old house-elf Dobby?" Malfoy asked incredulously.
Harry stared at Malfoy, aghast. Whatever he'd been expecting, that was not it. He looked at the handsome, blond Slytherin as if he'd hit his head too hard. Despite himself, he felt a small leap in his stomach. "Are you asking me to go to Hogsmeade with you? " he asked curiously.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I can be nice when I want to, Potter."
That was true. Many people didn't really know Harry. And people had all these false impressions about him- look at the rubbish that Rita Skeeter was putting out there. Harry picked up a kipper and chewed it before answering.
"Oh! Oh, no, only in personality."
"Er, Malfoy, we're, er, holding up traffic." This was true. There were several people trying to leave the shop, but being shoved back by the enchanted mistletoe's field.
Potter raised his eyebrows sarcastically. "You? Frightened? I thought Malfoy's didn't get scared."
Not again, Harry thought. He paused in walking across the grounds with Ron and Hermione to Care of Magical Creatures and turned to face Malfoy.
Draco sighed. 'Whatever it is you're wondering, just ask."
"That's the spirit! Come here, darling." Pansy smiled and spread her arms, beckoning him to her perch in the armchair. Huffing, Draco slid from his chair and took a seat on the floor, leaning his back on her knees and letting her stroke his hair, his head in her lap. Though many people thought Draco and Pansy were involved with each other, Pansy was one of the few real friends Draco had, and she knew that he was absolutely gay, gay beyond doubt. Besides, Pansy was dating Blaise Zabini, another of Draco's close friends. Though Draco was certain he had seen Pansy making eyes at a certain bushy-haired, buck-toothed Gryffindor . . .
"Why?"
"I'd suppose so," Malfoy agreed, taking a break as well.
Draco cast a sideways glance at Poter, and saw his eyebrows were furrowed. Potter's green eyes flashed, and he turned to face Draco.
Harry laughed incredulously. "Let me get this quite straight: you expect me to ditch my friends, my actual friends, to go to Hogsmeade with you?"
"And . . ." Malfoy looked uncomfortable as he asked, "Why didn't these Duzzleys give you any presents?"
Without another word, he swung around and strode down the hall, robes flicking as he went, Crabbe and Goyle lumbering after him.
"Do you, er, fancy anyone?"
"Alright . . ."
"Well, you see-,"
Malfoy seemed to consider this, his brow furrowed.
"Then why are you here with me now, Potter?"
"There, now that wasn't so hard, was it, Potter?" Malfoy drawled condescendingly, making his way toward Harry to exit the corridor, while Crabbe and Goyle sniggered like the daft lumps they were.
Malfoy looked surprised, though Harry had no idea why he would be.
"Ah. Glad that didn't happen, then."
He stopped talking and stared up at a patch of ceiling like it was the most interesting paint-job in the world.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and sneered, "I'm flattered, truly."
"Alright, then, Potter. While this is riveting, I'm sure, I would quite like to go to the Three Broomsticks for a Butterbeer. Shall we?"
"Er, fine, I suppose. Just . . . first task is tomorrow, y'know? I'm a bit on edge. And, of course, I'm still fighting with Ron, so . . ." Harry trailed off, glowering. "How about you, Malfoy?" This felt very odd.
"I know that," Malfoy said smoothly.
"Because I said so. I am confused on several fronts. First, if they didn't want to tell you about your magic, which, by the way, is a very bad idea and may have resulted in your developing an Obscurus-,"
"Are you . . ." Potter still was looking up at the ceiling. He breathed in and out deeply. "Y'know, gay? Or something of the sort, I mean, er-"
Malfoy looked over at Harry, a tiny smile on his lips. Then he clapped his hands suddenly and pointed at the Three Broomsticks, which they were nearing- they'd been walking for quite some time now, meandering around until they'd finally reached Hogsmeade.
"It was your own fault!"
Harry sighed in exasperation. "Yes, it does, Malfoy. Tell me."
Draco snorted. Pansy stopped stroking his hair at once.
"Eight and a Sickle," she countered.
Draco stared at him. "Of all things, you want to tour the Shrieking Shack?"
"How so?"
Draco panicked slightly. "Do I seem gay to you, Potter?" he sneered.
"You oughtn't get a big head now."
Or maybe memories . . .
"I noticed. You called Hermione 'Granger' as opposed to . . . that."
Draco ignored that last bit. "No, he just likes getting a rise out of me."
Harry felt a scalding stab of anger. "Actually, no, Malfoy. I don't get presents, at least not from the Dursleys. My eleventh birthday was my first real birthday. I got Hedwig from Hagrid, and a cake. I also was told I was a wizard, and that I could get away from the Dursleys and attend Hogwarts. Then, when I was twelve, Dobby-"
"July thirty-first."
"Yes. Pansy is . . ." He wouldn't laugh at that pun. Not in front of Potter. He would not humiliate himself in such a way. "Pansexual," he finished, miraculously keeping a straight face.
in which harry starts to get malfoy
Try as he might, Harry just couldn't hate Malfoy, even if the other boy directed derogatory comments at Harry and his friends all the time. It was ridiculous, but he couldn't. Not after meeting the friendly, funny model of Malfoy he had enjoyed a day in Hogsmeade with.
Malfoy's lips parted in surprise, then he smiled.
"Second year, then, Potter. What about that?"
"In a cupboard under the stairs."
"I mean, she and Blaise are dating, but . . ." Draco trailed off, watching Pansy and Granger, while Blaise snuck a glance at Weasley, eyebrow raised. Weasley scowled, ears pink.
Ah. "Well, I'm just pleased that people are accepting towards the . . . LGBTQ+ community."
Draco turned, cheeks hot, face flushed, and stared fixedly out the window into the blurry, white landscape outside- blurry because of the steam covering the window. Draco wiped an area of steam off the cold glass with his sleeve so he could look outside, taking care that his clear little section was a perfect circle.
As they walked, Potter became more and more quiet, seemingly mute by the time they reached their destination. Draco gave up on trying to initiate some conversation, settling for observing Potter in what he hoped was an inconspicuous way.
"Ah. A fictional Muggle detective. He's brilliantly intelligent. The books about him are extremely famous, and there are several movie and TV adaptations of the books."
"Shh, don't interrupt me, darling. You're adorable. I'm sure that if Potter knew you, as opposed to just one side of you- your much more sarcastic, grouchy, and, admittedly, cooler side-"
The sun was shining, and Filch was glowering by the short line of students, checking their notes and then shoving them out the door. Harry was wearing his uniform black cloak with the silver clasps over a thick, woolly Weasley jumper and dark denim trousers. He fiddled with the little pasties in his pocket- cream cheese, smoked salmon, and dill, and some kippers in a napkin. He also, in his other pocket, had some jelly tarts. As he waited for Malfoy, he reflected on what he actually knew about the other boy. He knew the Malfoy's were rich, Mr. Malfoy had been a Death Eater, they used house-elves, and were all Slytherins. The list was rather short. He hoped to learn more about Malfoy- he was quite interested in him, oddly enough. He'd enjoyed spending time with Malfoy. He'd never thought that he would think that, but it was true. As he reflected, he realized something. Malfoy craved attention, yes. But he craved the attention of people laughing at his jokes, or people being concerned for him. In short, he craved the feeling of being liked and wanted. Shaking his head at this revelation- Malfoy was human, like anyone else- Harry noticed Malfoy entering the Entrance Hall.
"Well, you got into the Chamber. And you killed the Basilisk. That's not exactly nothing."
"Well, Potter, I was just wondering if I could speak to you. Without the Mudb- without . . . Granger and Weasley." Harry looked at Malfoy curiously. It had not escaped his notice that Malfoy stopped himself from saying Mudblood. But why?
"No chance of that, Malfoy."
Harry watched them rant and rage, feeling completely out of his depth. He took the Snitch right from Malfoy's hand and inspected it as they continued on, oblivious to him:
"'Urry up and snog, a'ready! I got ter get me ter the 'Og's 'Ead fast-like fer a meetin'!" one abrasive man with a ruddy red nose shouted. Draco felt his face turn warm as he met Potter's gaze. He was surprised at Potter's soft expression, and stopped by the way the light flickered across his bright green eyes. Potter's lips parted, and, as if in slow motion, he leaned forward and- Draco's eyes widened, and he leaned forward just a tad, lips slightly parted, and- Potter's head turned, and he kissed Draco's cheek.
Malfoy glanced around before answering, as though to make sure nobody was listening. No one was, unless you counted the squirrel. "To be honest, Potter, I don't exactly . . . abhor you. I'd say that I . . . mildly dislike you, as you're an attention-seeking prat. But-"
Malfoy laughed shortly, then replied, with a perfectly straight face, "Yes, Potter. I want to get you on your own so I can kill you and hide your body in the Shrieking Shack." His voice was dripping in sarcasm.
"Oh. That's . . . difficult."
Malfoy sighed and looked at Harry like he was quite an idiot. "That's because the difference isn't visible. Quite simply, the difference is that a regular Snitch has flesh memories, while a practice Snitch does not."
"Alright. You're right. I don't."
Goyle shoved Harry with his shoulder as he passed. Harry turned to watch Malfoy go, his shoulder now smarting.
The woman considered this rather impressive-sounding number carefully. Then her face paled, and then proceeded to flush, going from jaundice to red like a traffic light. "That- That's eight Galleons again!" she sputtered.
"Why do you care?" Harry inquired.
"Anytime, darling."
Malfoy glared at Harry, then sighed. "I know," he muttered quietly. He looked dejected, like there was even more to that soft 'I know' than Harry understood. Harry was struck by an urge to give him a sort of sideways, one-armed hug. But that was ridiculous- this was Malfoy. He was rude and arrogant to Harry and his friends for no reason other than social status. But still . . .
But, Draco wasn't obligated to do anything about the mistletoe! Surely he could just . . . walk out!
And! And Harry was struck by how different Malfoy was, right here, right now, away from Hogwarts. Harry had made a whole speech en route, even telling Malfoy that his values were the wrong ones, and Malfoy had just taken it. He'd agreed! Agreed! And while Harry wasn't prepared to forget everything that had happened over the years, far from it, he was still enjoying Malfoy's company a great deal more than he was going to admit.
Malfoy's face was flushed. "I didn't think it actually understood me, alright, Potter?"
Strangely, Potter laughed. "It's not haunted."
Harry handed his note over to Filch, who eyed it suspiciously, jowls aquiver, but let him through this time. Malfoy was allowed to pass with a ferocious glare.
"What?"
"Let's cut to the chase, Potter," Draco interrupted impatiently- he'd seen enough to know that asking was safe. "Is Granger interested in Pansy?"
And it seemed Harry wasn't the only one enjoying the company of a Slytherin. Hermione had happily informed him that she'd be meeting up with Pansy Parkinson at Madam Puddifoot's next Hogsmeade trip. Likewise, Ron had grudgingly acknowledged that he'd be accompanying Blaise Zabini on a mix of errands and more fun things- they planned on picking up some potions ingredients from Dogweed and Deathcap, purchasing Blaise some dress robes from Gladrags, and then on visiting Honeydukes together.
As Harry watched him swish away, Malfoy turned his head, just slightly, to glance back at Harry. He called out, his eyes sparkling with glee, "I suppose I'll see you in Hogsmeade, then, Potter."
Harry set his drink down as well. "You mean, the belief in blood status? Blood purity?"
It amazed him how easy it was, sitting next to Malfoy in the Three Broomsticks. They talked and laughed and joked so naturally, the same snarky sense of humour and so much to talk about. Harry had expected the day to pass in a series of barely-dodged hexes, cruel jokes, and offensive slurs, but it was just . . . simple. Simple, and almost . . . fun.
Potter shook his head. "Not now, Malfoy. Maybe next time. It's a long story."
Malfoy was silent, so Harry answered his own question.
Malfoy had seen the Snitch.
"Perfect." Malfoy's lip curled as he said, "Perhaps you'll enjoy the change in company. I assure you that I will be better conversation, at least, than a Mu- than Granger and Weasley."
Malfoy laughed, incredulous. "You're still bothered by that?"
Malfoy groaned. "Fine. I . . . I was trying to impress you."
Pansy shot up in excitement. "Well? Is he?"
"Seven and a Sickle."
"Thank Merlin's ruddy ol' beard! Took ye long enough, ye daft- . . ." The man with the red, flat nose's voice trailed off into the sharp wind outside as he pushed past Draco and Potter, startling them both. Potter nodded quickly, then tucked in the trailing ends of his scarlet-and-gold scarf.
"Oho, a good choice," she said appreciatively. "That there would be ten Galleons."
Harry spun around, cursing, and saw that Malfoy was already several metres in front of him, speeding after the Snitch. Harry pushed his broom as fast as he could, catching up to Malfoy swiftly. They were right next to each other, and Harry shouldered Malfoy out of the way. Malfoy shoved him back, and it was then that the Snitch decided to switch directions. A little blur of gold, it shot straight down, right towards the ground. Nearly eighty feet up, Harry heard Malfoy swear as he shifted on his broom in unison with Harry, and then they both hurtled downwards. Harry was right behind Malfoy, in hot pursuit of the Snitch. He caught up to Malfoy and saw his pale face grow even whiter as they rocketed toward the ground- twenty feet, fourteen feet, nine feet. Harry noticed Malfoy's broom jerk, as if he were doing his best not to back out. Then Harry saw Malfoy's eyes steel, and Malfoy reached his hand out for the Snitch, close enough to touch Harry's own outstretched fingers. And then they both grabbed wildly at the Snitch, moments before crashing. Harry felt his fingers catch one of the frantically flapping wings, and saw Malfoy's slender fingers close on the little golden ball. In the seconds before they hurtled into the earth, Harry noticed that Malfoy's finger-nails, far from the perfectly manicured specimens which Harry somehow would have expected, were bitten to the quick, with little scabby scraps of skin around the edges. He was jarred, for whatever reason, by this surprisingly human and . . . vulnerable characteristic on the otherwise perfect Slytherin. All these thoughts passed through his mind in an instant, and then they slammed into the deep snow with a soft flump.
"Besides," Harry continued, "you weren't even badly hurt." Malfoy made an indignant noise. "You weren't, Malfoy. Madam Pomfrey fixed you up in a second. You just milked it to get out of all your work."
"Dobby?"
"Yes! That thing! It almost killed me!"
"Thank you, dear. I'll be here with your drinks in a jiffy." She bustled off, muttering mutinously as she knocked into a table.
"Oh, just walking along with my enemy . . . to Hogsmeade . . . to catch a Butterbeer, or to visit Zonko's. You know, the usual." Malfoy glanced at Harry.
"Because you want to?'
Draco feigned that he was considering this. Of course, the answer was obvious to him, but he didn't want it to seem that way to Potter. Finally, he said, "Sure, Potter. Next Hogsmeade trip, then, you'll tell me what the big fuss is about the dirty old Shrieking Shack."
Harry snorted. "He wouldn't have."
Malfoy nodded numbly.
Maybe Malfoy wasn't quite as bad as he'd always thought.
"Yes, Potter. I am the Malfoy heir, and therefore I'm expected to support the natural hierarchy. I'm meant to follow the logic which states that Muggles are beneath wizards, and that Mudbl- Muggleborns are beneath Halfbloods, who are in turn beneath Purebloods. It's just . . . the way things are."
Harry's POV
Malfoy heaved a great sigh. "It's not that simple. I . . . I've been raised like this for my whole life. Fourteen years of being completely immersed in these opinions, Potter! On one hand, I see Granger, who I know is passing me in classes not because all the teachers love her, but because she is genuinely . . . brilliantly intelligent." Malfoy scowled. "But, obviously, my father never hears about that. I just tell him that she's a teacher's pet, otherwise . . ." He trailed off delicately.
"Ahem . . . How are you, Potter?" Malfoy asked without looking in Harry's direction- he was staring intensely at a squirrel gnawing on a nut in a nearby tree.
Potter's eyebrows flew up into his tangly hair-line. "No! I mean, er, no-?"
"Okay . . . well, I think I rather prefer the civilized, friendly-ish Malfoy over the arrogant, rude one any day. Why do you even act like that in the first place if it comes so naturally to be like this?"
"These have been in your pockets since breakfast, Potter?"
"That's . . . Good for you, Potter. Do you fancy anyone, then?"
Draco nearly dropped the fork he'd previously been mutilating the table with. His neck cracked as he whirled around to stare at Potter owlishly. Potter was determinedly examining the ceiling for faults, and clearly would not be surfacing soon. He seemed not to realize the effect which his nonchalant declaration had had on Draco.
They drank their Butterbeer, tucked into a booth at the far side of the pub. There was a momentary lull in conversation as they both took sips at the same time. Then Harry decided to break the short silence.
Potter's eyes widened, then he glared at Draco. "Shut up, Malfoy. Why'd'you have to be such a foul git?"
"Are you boys going to buy anything, or just sit there jabbering?" A sharp voice interrupted Harry mid-sentence. He looked up and saw the portly shop-owner who'd been shooting them suspicious glances. She had an aquiline nose and ruddy cheeks, and was glowering down at them shrewdly.
"I am offended."
"Yes, well, your friends did. They harrassed me in the kitchens to make two more drinks, and to serve them to your table." She shrugged, clanking the mugs onto the table, then making her exit, squeezing between a cramped table and the approaching Pansy and Granger.
"Alright . . . Because you're normally so concerned about accepting people . . ." Draco bit back a snide retort- Potter had a right to be skeptical. Draco had to keep reminding himself not to get defensive- unfortunately, Potter would usually be correct in his opinions of Draco. Potter looked like he wanted to say something else.
Harry could have sworn he saw Malfoy smile, just a bit.
Harry's POV
"And you, er, were so polite to her."
They trudged through the snow towards the wide hill, summoning their respective broomsticks. Malfoy shot a look of barely-disguised envy at Harry's Firebolt, which Harry pretended not to see. They set the Snitch loose, and after waiting twenty seconds, shot up into the air after it.
They both had their hands still locked around the Snitch, and Harry ducked as he saw a fist fly towards his face. He kicked his knee out, jabbing Malfoy in the stomach, and heard a satisfying oughf. Malfoy's fingers scrabbled for purchase on the cold surface of the little Snitch, and Harry locked his grip tighter on the wing. He could feel the Snitch beating wildly at his hand like a trapped hummingbird. Malfoy's elbow hit him in the stomach, and then a leg flew over him and flailed around, kicking his back. Harry scrambled at Malfoy, fighting for the Snitch, and soon they were just a messy tangle of limbs in the cold snow.
The wind whipped wildly, and Harry reached a height of about sixty feet quickly, then examined the sky for the Snitch. Snow was falling, making it difficult to spot the little golden ball. He saw Malfoy coming up behind him, a blur of black, silver, and green, with his blond hair shining in the snow and sun. Malfoy's cheeks were pink in the fierce wind and crisp air, and Harry had to shake his head to force himself to inspect the sky for the Snitch instead of watching Malfoy.
"No, he didn't. Don't be ridiculous."
"Alright . . . What is TV? And movie?"
Yes, I fancy someone, you idiot. You.
"I said," Draco repeated, twisting the fork into the wood of the table- he'd fix it for Puddifoot later. "Wrong answer."
"Trying?"
Malfoy looked at him oddly. "Why not?"
"Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?"
"Of course, Potter."
Malfoy glanced at him blankly. "You're not serious, Potter. Alright, well, basically a Snitch remembers who touched it first. That's called flesh memories."
"-stopped all my messages, so I got nothing from Ron, Hermione, or anyone. That was the worst birthday, because I thought everyone had forgotten me. I'd never had any friends before, so it was awful. Then I was locked in my room because Dobby-"
"Ten!" Malfoy spat. "That's absurd!"
"Why should I tell you, Malfoy?"
Harry did remember that- he'd laughed at Malfoy's face when Goyle's cement-like sludge plopped right into his perfectly made potion. Malfoy had looked like an owl, his eyes had widened so much, and then he'd turned on Goyle and started telling him off so ferociously that Snape docked twenty points off both of them and sent Malfoy into the hall.
"I only got there because Hermione figured out what was in the Chamber, and how the Basilisk was moving around. We would have been lost without her. Besides, killing a blind Basilisk isn't that impressive, and-"
He ignored the approaching girls, Pansy still snickering, Hermione looking sheepish. The Snitch laid forgotten in the snow.
Potter startled, then his ears turned pink. He pursed his lips. "I was, er, wondering if, say . . . Well, Pansy- Hermione- good grief. Are you-?"
Potter seemed to ponder this. "You know, I think she might be. Don't you dare tell anyone I said that, though, Malfoy. Or I'll hex you into tomorrow," he threatened.
"Hullo, m'dears, my name's Madam Puddifoot, I'm here to take your order."
"Well, perhaps your people skills just needed some work- they still sort of do, though."
Malfoy froze. "I- I'm just saying, I mean, you've done impressive things, it's just . . . annoying."
Draco then shook his head. Potter looked puzzled.
"I suppose you won't be playing much this year, 'cause of that blasted Tournament. Better keep ship-shape, then, eh? May I interest you boys in some Quidditch supplies?" she said briskly.
"Guess we'll be here for a while, then," Harry sighed as he flopped back onto the snow.
Harry patted the snow, searching for his glasses without relinquishing the Snitch. Then he felt Malfoy's hand leave the tiny golden ball, and felt his glasses being gently rested back on his nose. One arm of the glasses poked him in the ear, and Harry released the Golden Snitch and righted it. The blond blur in front of him revealed itself to be a smirking Draco Malfoy, who laughed at Harry's expression, brushing some snow out of the dark fringe of hair that concealed Harry's scar.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Go on."
"DOBBY!"
"So I spent the first eleven years of my life in a cupboard, underfed and being bullied by Dudley, my cousin. Oh, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon love Ickle Diddy-dums. He's the light of their life. They coddle him so much, it's embarrassing. He's spoiled rotten, fat, and ugly. He looks like a walrus masquerading in a blond wig as a teenaged boy."
"Yes, you did. Admit it."
Now it was Harry's turn to stare blankly. "An image of . . . being a prat?"
"What's so funny, darling?"
"To be less judgemental- or at least less . . . outspoken in my judgment."
Malfoy looked at him scornfully. "Come one, Potter. Hard to choose amongst all your expensive, lovely gifts?"
"I am not! Malfoy, I don't want any attention at all!"
What did he know about Potter? He knew that he lived with Muggles, stayed at Hogwarts for most breaks, was brilliant at Quidditch, and loved treacle tart. He knew he was terrible at Potions, great at Defence Against the Dark Arts, and hated Divination. He knew all these common facts, all these surface things. But did he really know Potter? He wanted to believe that he did, but looking at the boy beside him, black hair blowing in his face, bright green eyes lost in thought, he thought that Potter was as big a mystery as anything.
Granger looked flushed in the pink lighting and steamy conditions of the tea-shop, and Pansy looked like Pansy normally did. They squished into the booth across from Draco and Potter and grabbed their coffees, Pansy dumping several piles of sugar and a ton of milk into it before deeming the beverage acceptable. Granger poured a little milk, no cream, and no sugar into hers, and sipped it delicately as Pansy pretended to be dainty, her manicured, black-painted pinky finger sticking out from the side of the mug.
Draco considered this carefully. "That might work. I mean, the first part is entirely true- ow! Don't hit, Pansy! No hitting, my father will hear about it! Ow. Yes, so that's true, and I'm sure I could actually get Crabbe and Goyle a detention. I could frame them for some sort of transgression. It would be quite easy."
"You despised me from that?"
"Six matches a year, Potter. I think Hogwarts can handle the expenses."
"Slytherin? You?"
Snow flurried through the air, crystalline flakes whirling and swirling on the bitter wind. The sun shone bleakly through grey clouds. Potter asked if he fancied anyone. And of course the answer was yes. and of course it really was Potter's concern.
"Obviously so that if there's a foul, they have a guaranteed way of knowing who caught the Snitch," Malfoy said.
Draco scoffed. "You don't have the skill- or the need. I think Pansy fancies Granger. Alright?"
"Potter, I don't really want to . . . hate each other, I suppose. I concur, though- I rather enjoy bickering with you, too. And I suppose you didn't notice, but I'm trying."
"Which one?"
Filch narrowed his great big eyes at Malfoy, his jowls wiggling unpleasantly, and released the struggling boy from his grip. Malfoy shook himself, wiping his clothes off dramatically, all the while glaring daggers at Filch.
Draco cast a helpless look at Potter as Pansy dragged him away. Potter laughed at his dilemma and followed.
"I don't know." Harry shrugged. Inside, he did know. He'd always been . . . intrigued by the witty, handsome blond who, although he was a git, was smart and interesting to learn more about. "You asked me, I suppose. And, maybe, I almost want to . . . try, I guess? Perhaps?"
"Did I stutter?" Malfoy sneered, then began talking slightly quicker than was normal. "I mean, Potter, it's not that I want to go with you, per se, but, you see, Blaise and Pansy are off on another one of their dates, and Crabbe and Goyle got detention. They trashed Flitwick's classroom, and got caught by McGonagall." Here, Harry could have sworn Malfoy smiled, fleetingly, but then he curled his lip at Harry and said, "So, obviously, that is why I'm asking you."
"If that were my rat, I would've known that he was an ugly little middle-aged man!" Malfoy exclaimed.
Harry felt a funny little lurch in his stomach, looking at the witty, handsome, funny, intelligent boy in front of him, and he realized that he was in a world of trouble.
"Locked up!"
Potter snorted a derisive laugh. "I really don't."
"Why, you little-!"
"You were twelve!"
Harry watched Malfoy's face, seeing him a new light.
By this time they were nearing Hogsmeade, and, being cold, they entered the nearest shop to warm up, which happened to be Spintwitches Sporting Goods. A little bell tinkled, and they were immediately accosted by flashing colours of various Quidditch teams. Harry saw the Chudley Cannons, Holyhead Harpies, Appleby Arrows, and many more teams waving merrily and zooming around on their respective posters. Mannequins were showing off Quidditch robes, arm guards, and other things all around the room. Harry could have sworn he saw one mannequin stifle a yawn, and heard another one cough.
A flurry of falling snow hit them as they left Spintwitches, wind whipping the flakes into their faces as soon as they opened the door. Malfoy was smug and tossing the practice Snitch from hand to hand, and Harry was angry at Malfoy's contemptuous treatment of the kind, if outspoken, shop-owner. Harry snatched the practice Snitch and examined it, again, to see what made it so different from a regular Snitch. Malfoy looked at him oddly. Harry felt annoyance swell in his stomach, and he said, "You really shouldn't have thrown them at her, Malfoy. It was rude and arrogant."
"So . . . the Dark Lord will . . . rise again? Because of Weasley's rat?" Malfoy asked finally, his voice small.
For a while, they just lay there, thoroughly tuckered-out and breathing heavily, but both experiencing a wonderful sense of comfort and peace. They looked up into the clouds and the falling snow, fat, fluffy flakes landing on their noses, eyes, and in their hair. Harry saw Malfoy catch a snowflake on his tongue, and then look embarrassed. Harry became quite aware of Malfoy's fingers near his, and felt an overwhelming urge to drop the Snitch and take Malfoy's hand instead. Then he shoved aside this sudden madness. This was Malfoy! Malfoy, who he didn't hate but definitely didn't like, at least not in the way he suspected he might.
Harry snorted as Malfoy attempted to finagle his way to eight Galleons. Malfoy glared at him, snatching the Snitch back.
Hermione took Ron's arm and pulled him toward the hut, as he seemed reluctant to leave Harry and Malfoy alone together.
"N-nothing," Harry stammered in surprise, then cursed himself for stuttering. He'd just been watching Malfoy! What was the big fuss?
"Are- are you ever going to let go?" Harry huffed, out of breath. He caught a fist to the jaw and dove at Malfoy.
"Fine. Seven Galleons, and four-hundred-ninety-three Knuts."
Draco took a deep breath and waited expectantly. Potter's green eyes were wide, providing furth evidence that Draco's supposition was correct.
But no. It was not meant to be. As Potter attempted to leave the shop, he was pushed back by an invisible wall. Draco shoved him aside and tried to exit as well, but to no avail. Finally, he turned to Pansy and sent her a murderous glare. She smirked. Granger had her face in her hands, but Draco could see her peeking through her fingers. Potter coughed quietly.
"If I'd known you wanted to, er, be friends, maybe I wouldn't have . . . judged you quite so harshly. It was because I met you that I told the Hat not to stick me in Slytherin."
"Well, Ron and I are-"
Potter looked annoyed at the jibe, but nodded. "Do you want to join them?" he asked. "Looks like they're on their way to Zonko's."
Pansy sighed and helped Draco back up, placing his head back on her knee. She laughed and brushed stray strands of blonde hair from his forehead.
"What do you mean, Potter?" Malfoy glanced up from his drink, normally pale face flushed from laughter- Harry had told the story of when Hagrid had given Dudley a pig's tail. He hadn't explained it all, just that Hagrid had visited Harry to give him his Hogwarts letter, and had gotten angry at Harry's cousin. Malfoy hadn't asked why Hagrid had needed to personally deliver the letter, and Harry hadn't volunteered the information.
"I am not innocent!"
"As a matter of fact, Malfoy, I will be attending this year, though I still don't see what business it is of yours." For a moment, Harry thought he saw triumph flicker across Malfoy's pale, pointed face. Then it was replaced by his usual smug, self-satisfied smirk, though his eyes glimmered a little brighter now.
Potter put down the box he was holding, looking around the shop. "I think you might be right. Where do you want to go?"
"I'll explain later. When we talk about the Shack, okay? Now, Dumbledore must've left a note or a letter or something explaining the situation. But the Dursleys hated me because I was a wizard. They never told me about my magic, thinking they could just . . . quash it out of me if they kept me locked up and underfe-"
"Father never told us what happened there."
"What is the difference between a practice Snitch and a regular one, Malfoy? I've been looking, and I can't see any visible difference."
"No."
"Sirius Black?"
Draco opened his mouth to say something- what, exactly, he wasn't quite sure- just as Madam Puddifoot bustled over with their drinks, and, inexplicably, two extras.
"Well, my boy, what would you call a fair price?" The woman crossed her arms.
Malfoy sighed long-sufferingly. "Potter, you've faced off the Dark Lord. I'm sure that a couple of challenges will be nothing for you. Oh, look, we've reached the Squib. Note, Potter."
"Spell's broken. Let's go, then." He marched off into the flurries, shoulders hunched against the gale. As Draco made to leave as well, he felt a warm hand close around his.
Malfoy looked at him oddly.
Malfoy stared at him blankly. "Obviously, Potter, I have an image, a reputation to uphold. I have expectations I must live up to."
Harry was bemused.
Draco startled, then turned. "Potter," he said cooly. "Didn't think you'd show."
"In all seriousness, Potter, I was wondering . . . do you know if Granger fancies girls?"
Harry laughed without humour, then asked, "Why me? I mean, why did you ask me? You hate me."
"Wrong answer, Potter," he muttered.
Malfoy ignored the jibe, so Harry continued speaking.
Potter looked exceedingly uncomfortable, ripping a hand through his tangle of shiny black hair.
"I suppose we shall."
"Potter. A pleasure to see you," he sneered.
in which harry is quite startled
"Try?"
Harry wasn't an idiot.
"That again? It's not even funny! It's not a good pun at all!"
in which harry basically reveals his life story and malfoy barters for a snitch
"Depends, I suppose. D'you want to accompany me to Hogsmeade next time?"
"That's for me to know, and you to find out," Harry said mysteriously. Malfoy delicately ate his pasty, somehow not allowing a single crumb to fall on him.
Why, indeed?
Granger. Draco nearly flinched away from the Mudb- the girl, but stopped as she gave his hand a reassuring squeeze and smiled comfortingly. Then the pressure of her hand was gone, entwining around Pansy's fingers as they advanced into the snowstorm together.
Malfoy looked perplexed. "How the hell did you figure that one?"
"I truly am. I was just trying to- never mind."
"Kidding, darling. Anyway, if you let him know you, I'm sure he will fall for you. Eventually. Somehow."
"What are you thinking of, Potter?" Draco asked. Potter shook his head as if clearing it, then fixed his gaze on Draco. Draco was unsettled by the intensity of those green eyes. Then Potter sighed. "Just . . . memories. Family things. You know, er, it's hard to explain."
They stopped walking and considered the Shrieking Shack. Draco watched Potter, who seemed to be on another planet, staring at the dilapidated building. The sun shone through clouds, bright rays hitting the Shack, lighting up the rotting planks of wood and glinting off panes of broken glass, barred by mouldy, crisscrossed wooden planks.
"You sure, mate?" Ron cast a suspicious glance at Malfoy, who was standing by himself on the path, tapping his foot, arms crossed impatiently.
in which we discover malfoy's motives
A sudden gust of wind whipped around them, rattling the boards and the windows of the Shack, producing a low, keening wail. Draco shivered in the sudden chill. "You know, there are rumours that the Shack is haunted," Draco said nonchalantly, attempting to keep the superstition out of his voice. He'd always been a little nervous around unknown things, like the Shack, or the Forbidden Forest.
Draco shook silently, attempting to subdue another completely inappropriate snort- Malfoys did not snort. "Just, P-Pansexual Pansy, I-"
Grudgingly, Draco looked up at Pansy's face, the orangey-firelight almost making it glow.
"What? What were you trying to do?" Harry stared at Malfoy.
Malfoy shrugged. "Fine. I did."
Harry was happy for Hermione, but a little concerned that his best friend would get hurt- not because Pansy was a Slytherin, but because she was already with Blaise. He pushed his stray thoughts aside as he walked up to the Entrance Hall- the day had finally come.
"What are flesh memories?" Harry asked in confusion.
"Malfoy, I didn't ask for that. The only reason I'm famous is that Voldemort killed my parents! Who'd want-"
Malfoy nodded. "Madam Malkin's shop."
"James. After my dad."
"You're asking me?"
"We don't. Unless it's of Pansy's dastardly schemes. Then we are quite permitted to be alarmed."
"A cupboard!"
Harry had noticed, of course he had. He noticed every little thing Malfoy did, though he didn't quite understand why.
"What're you on about?"
"What's your birthday?"
Malfoy choked. Harry felt a blaze of anger- what had he ever done to make people believe he wanted the attention?
"Yeah, you reminded me of my cousin, Dudley. Spoiled rotten, except you were more arrogant. And perhaps slightly less stupid." And far better looking, Harry added mentally.
Harry was still contemplating when he heard a shout-"Potter!" He looked in the direction of the voice and felt something white, cold, and wet hit him in the face, knocking his glasses clean off. Harry saw the blurry figure of a girl walking toward him, and another one behind her, bushy hair whipping in the wind. The sound of Pansy Parkinson cackling madly reached him- for she was the criminal who'd thrown the snowball- and as the girls came closer they resolved themselves into the fuzzy silhouettes of Pansy and Hermione.
Of course he wanted the detailed answer. When would Malfoy ever make things easy for Harry?
Draco realized he had not responded, and instead was gaping in the most unbecoming way. He shut his mouth with a snap, then nodded firmly, not quite trusting himself to speak yet.
Harry snorted. "Anyway, that's about it."
He knew that he wasn't exactly straight. He also knew, however, that he was not gay. He'd definitely fancied girls- in fact, he thought Cho Chang was quite something, though whether he fancied her, he wasn't quite certain. But Harry was not straight. He'd definitely noticed other blokes in a way that was more than just friendly appreciation of a good-looking guy. As a matter of fact, he'd noticed Malfoy that way more than most, but he couldn't possibly- did he? Harry's mind was awhirl, swirling as fast as the flurries of snow in the sky. He glanced over at the rosy-cheeked, handsome, blond boy lying next to him in the snow. Malfoy looked peaceful, his face relaxed and not curled in a sneer. Harry thought it might be possible he did like Malfoy. Possibly in that way.
Malfoy crinkled his nose, eyebrows furrowed. "Now? In the snow, at Hogsmeade, one-on-one?"
Malfoy looked up in interest while taking one of the salmon pasties. "The kitchens? How do you get in there?"
"Alright. Er, what's your middle name?"
Malfoy smiled and let himself into the Three Broomsticks, letting the door close behind him. Harry shook his head and resignedly opened the door for himself, the comforting smell of Butterbeer and warm food washing over him as he entered the pub.
"You wish, Potter."
"Er, we didn't order these," Potter said, pointing at the extra pair of mugs.
"Yeah . . . the Hat said I'd do well there, but Hagrid and Ron had told me about Slytherin's reputation, and I'd seen you as proof, so . . . Gryffindor was next best in its opinion."
"I was wondering, Potter, if- well." He stopped, then tried again. "As you will be going to Hogsmeade this year, I was wondering if I could- this is ridiculous. I wanted to know if I could accompany you to Hogsmeade."
Draco flinched slightly when Potter said the Dark Lord's name, then calmly replied, "Anytime, Potter."
Damn it.
"Fine, if it makes you shut up. I thought he was your daddy's best mate, though? You have his spirit over for tea on Sundays?"
"Yes, intelligence. Ron beat Professor McGonagall's chess game at eleven years old. I'd call that intelligent. He sacrificed himself, too. Could have died. I consider that bravery. Any other comments, Malfoy?"
"Seven and seventeen Sickles!"
Draco allowed himself a smile, then said, "Well, I'm not sure how wonderful it is. Even if he can go, how on Earth would I ask him? 'Hey Potter, it's just me, the bloke you've hated for four years. I was wondering if you'd like to come to Hogsmeade with me?' Like that would work." Draco scoffed.
Malfoy grinned, raising his eyebrows.
"Well?" Pansy's voice came from the deep green armchair next to the fire. Draco turned and saw her, her eyes glinting in the firelight, head propped up on her arm, eyebrows wiggling. She smirked. "Did you find out?" Draco flopped into the squishy armchair opposite Pansy and sighed.
"And the Weasleys . . . I know they're great at Quidditch, any idiot could see that those twins can swing a bat like it's their job- it even could be, someday. But . . . I can't say that, because they are poor, and they are blood traitors, and my father doesn't like them."
"Merlin-no! Potter! And if- IF! I did, I would most certainly not tell you, because it really isn't any of your concern."
"Alright. Hey," Harry was struck by a sudden thought. "you know, that shop-owner was right. We won't be playing Quidditch all year, so we should keep in form. We've got ourselves a Snitch, why don't we play a practice match?"
"We fight because you are arrogant, and you act superiorly towards people. It's not really because of me. I just don't believe in that sort of thing. That's the only reason we're not friends now. And even if I'd chosen to be friends with you back then, on the train, I'm almost certain I wouldn't be at this point anyway, because I want to be friends with people who don't discriminate as you do. I'm friends with people who have the right values- like kindness, and acceptance, and equality."
He realized that he fancied Malfoy.
"Yes. Fine, Malfoy. I'll meet you in the Entrance Hall, on the first trip, which is . . . November the twenty-third."
"Very good, dear. Now, I'd like to say I am so very pleased to see so many of you coming to my shop. I just had the little Irish fellow and the tall, dark lad in here, and your friends, the one with the bushy hair and the one with the very short skirt. I'm simply so proud. You're so brave to be out in the open like this. I know there are so many horrible, judgemental people out there, and I want you to know that Madam Puddifoot's-" She jabbed her ample chest with a stubby thumb. "-is a safe place for all members of this community. Do you understand me, dears?"
in which malfoy aggravates harry and gets the information he wants
Potter considered, watching his friend giggling with Pansy. "I think she does. Er,-"
Potter scowled, then said, "I suppose I should thank you. That was why we found Fluffy the three-headed dog, which helped us find and save the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort."
Malfoy looked aghast. "You said I reminded you of him!"
"What do you want, Malfoy?" Harry asked coldly, his voice dripping with contempt.
Malfoy sighed, setting down his glass. "You know, Pansy often says I have many different sides to me. I suppose I'm just different here than I am at Hogwarts."
"He is."
"Yes Malfoy, a cupboard," Harry said testily. "I'm sure you've seen one before? It's where one keeps things that should be kept out of sight, like winter coats in the summer, or brooms, or small, unwanted, magical children. May I continue?"
"Potter! Potter!" Harry groaned, reaching for his wand. He could already see the smirking face and blond hair before Malfoy came into view. Malfoy was accompanied by Crabbe and Goyle, and he was tossing a shiny green apple from hand to hand.
"Seven Galleons."
"Yeah."
Draco's POV
"I think we're fin-" Harry began, but Malfoy cut across him swiftly.
Harry's POV
"Yeah, the train- no, wait, we met before that, didn't we?"
That afternoon found Draco and Potter crammed into a small, squashed booth at Madam Puddifoot's, at the insistence of Pansy and Granger. Puddifoot's was steamy and frilly, revoltingly pink and covered from top to bottom in mistletoe, which Draco had side-stepped carefully. He'd caught Potter eyeing it with suspicion and alarm. Pansy and Granger, however, had stumbled into the shop, giggling, and had disappeared for a moment, returning a minute later to dump Draco and Potter in their booth and run off again.
Potter grinned, then sent an almost wistful look at the building. It was as if he was looking at something that wasn't there, grasping at an idea or feeling when he looked at the Shack.
"Sure."
"How much is that practice Snitch, right there?"
"As if, Potter. Let's go- the hill over here is nice and open, just on the edge of the town. We can summon our brooms there."
"Try . . . to get along. A little. I sort of want to try to be less, you know, constantly fighting, if you could try to be less judgemental, and less hateful."
Harry could not quite believe his ears- or Malfoy's motives. "How do I know you don't just want to get me alone so you can murder me?" he asked skeptically.
Draco's POV
"I did not!"
Draco nodded as much as he could in the cramped space. Somewhere, a Christmas cracker went off, blowing confetti in his face. Draco struggled to pull his arm up and get the confetti away, but he was crammed between Potter and the wall, so he settled for shaking off his hair and hoping for the best. Potter laughed, then brushed off the confetti with the hand that was loose and in the aisle between tables. Draco's heart skipped a beat as Potter brushed the colourful pieces of paper out of his blond hair, Potter's green eyes crinkling as he stifled another snicker.
They walked together to wait in the line.
Draco ignored this. "I suppose we could pop by the Shack, maybe browse the shops along the street," Draco pondered. He noticed a strange look on Potter's face and trailed off.
"-framed me for the pudding incident. My thirteenth birthday was good, I got a sneakoscope and a broomstick servicing kit, but I also got the Monster Book of Monsters. And this year, I got four cakes from Hermione, Hagrid, the Weasley and Si- someone else. Those are the only birthdays I've had in my life, for your information."
Draco eyed him, then the Shack. "How d'you know?"
"Malfoy." Harry responded. Malfoy glanced up at the sky for a moment, a brief gesture of irritation.
"Yeah."
"Well, why don't you just . . . ask me some questions, then?"
"Er, is Pansy . . . interested in anyone?"
As they spoke, casting glances around the shop from time to time, trying in vain to spot Granger and Pansy in the crush of people, a stout little woman with a shiny black bun squished beside their table and began speaking rapidly.
Harry was breathing heavily after this outburst. He looked at Malfoy, whose eyes were wide.
For reasons he knew not, he found himself counting the days until the next Hogsmeade trip. He was merely going through the motions of classes, homework, and conversations with all but Ron- who he was now on good terms with once more- and Hermione. He could hardly wait for the moment he would see Malfoy again. Of course, he had seen the enigmatic Slytherin several times in their shared classes, or in the corridors. He sought Malfoy out between classes just to get a rise out of him. They bickered and insulted each other as usual, except Harry thought he saw a twinkle in Malfoy's eye even as he smirked, tossing out rude comments like rice at a wedding.
