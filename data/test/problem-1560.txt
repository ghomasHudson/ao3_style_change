As soon as she left the room, there was a pause before a cushion hit the back of his head. He looked up to see Fred and George's glowering faces. "Bloody unbelievable," George said.
"I had not the slightest clue that the hyenas would be there," Kingscross smiled in an apologetic way that only taunted Draco. "The meat was meant to drive the animals away from us, so that they wouldn't be hungry for human flesh." And Draco began to seethe in anger. Their professor was full of bullocks. The wand was still in his hand, and he gripped it tighter, ready for the spells that wouldn't come during the hyena attack to now rain down upon the man. For a moment he was going to do it. But he stopped. A small part of him knew that he had to bid his time, to calculate. Something rough touched the leg where the hyena had bitten him. At his feet was the caracal, licking him. He was surprised and stepped back. She looked up at him with round pupils. A warmth touched him as he crouched, and spread further as he brought a hand close to her. The contact of fur calmed him as he patted her, and he could see that there were no other markings printed on Harmony's fur. He smiled, and all of his anger was momentarily forgotten.
Harmony looked hesitantly up at him. "What's that?"
"Well that didn't work," Harmony said, when they were further down the passage way, "even though Ginny makes a more believable Harry than I do. It took ages to find that one strand of old hair as well. Want to go on a date?"
Harmony flicked her eyes to her tea, taking a sip of the too hot liquid. "I know." She replied.
"Yea, are you thick or something? This is Dumbledore we're talking about."
Draco had once thought that Muggle Studies was beneath him, that nothing worth while could actually amount from those primitives. Five days in to their vacation, and still nothing impressed him. Airplanes looked dangerous and slow, the metro was a nightmare, and the muggles were ignorant and hostile brutes.
"Wait!" she called, and began to chase after it. The ferret wasn't as fast as her, so she caught up fast, and scoped it up once more. "You can't go off like that, Mrs. Noris could find you, or any other careless foot." The ferret shook its head, and wiggled until she was forced to let the ferret down, or else drop it. It crawled along the wall, and Harmony followed it. It looked cute, and determined as it sometimes looked back to see where she was. The students they passed were too busy to see the ferret, but some nodded at her. "Where are you going?" she asked it.
"How's Madam Puddifoot's sound?"
"Of course," Ron muttered, still not looking relieved in the slightest.
"The er, sorcerers cinnamon please."
"Ah, so who do I have to thank?"
"Easy. Wandless magic. It's all about taking the focus away from the wand and using the mind's power, the mind's memory as a means to control magic. In this case it is superimposing the image in your mind onto your face. A strong intent of concealing and protecting your face is also mandatory. Now you try." Harmony closed her eyes and her mind filled with Harry Potter, the planes of his cheeks, the glasses… she had grown up with that face, the many facets of Harry Potter all of the misery, the loneliness, the pressure, and the boyish fun. A headache began to form and her face shot up in heat. It was too much to picture, and yet so familiar.
"Harry! Harry! wake up!"
Necklace? Harmony recalled the velvet pouch that Draco had given to her before she left Hogwarts. She had thoughtlessly stuffed it into her bag. She searched for it now, going through the sack that was under her seat. She took the small black pouch and emptied it onto her palm.
There was a knock to her door and Harmony shoved everything under her bed before transfiguring her face back to Harry. "One moment," she said and pushed everything else that was girly away.
"Draco, you just don't understand the power of love, duh."
"Thank you," she said quietly so that the others wouldn't hear, which of course they did.
"Then it's a good thing that I'm a lion," she laughed.
"I know," she said, "but Snape, will fail me anyway, so might as well have it be a sweet failure."
"Later, let's get out of here first." Harmony said, dropping to her knees to pry out the loose floorboard, pulling out the two wands, the firebolt and her cloak.
"You must be joking," she said. His smile grew wider and he almost had to stop himself from bringing her closer. "Why?"
"Piss off," Draco said, "no one cares about what you think, Weasley."
She relaxed, closing her eyes, and unclenching her hand. It was possible. Harmony could be alive. But was she OK? Ginny opened her eyes to see that Blaise had gotten off the desk and was watching her.
Harmony felt the locket and hid it under her shirt. "It's nothing." She ignored Ginny's searching eyes and returned to the window, glad that the white could blind her from her very thoughts.
"You don't have to do this. We could escape together," Draco whispered. His mind raced to find arguments to back up his claim. The prophecy had already been fulfilled when the Dark Lord had last attacked her, the world was large enough for two people to get lost in it safely, he would take care of her.
"That's enough for now," Snape said and they both turned to him as the man watched them closely, as if he saw what they had both seen. "I'll assign another detention soon enough. Good night."
Her locker was at the Gryffindor end, and Harmony had the broom in her hand when she heard the door open behind her. She turned, stopping, and her Harry Potter face fell away. She didn't want to see him. "Draco," she said softly. It was obvious that he had followed her.
"Detention!" Snape shouted from where he sat, "Potter and Malfoy for unnecessarily speaking!" Many of the students did a double take when Draco's name had been called, and Draco looked on with disbelief.
Harmony turned around to face Hermione. "What has happened?"
"Freaky queer," Harry overheard, and stiffened on reflex. "Why the hell do you look like that?"
"But Harry! You promised," Ginny said a tad too loudly.
"Draco Malfoy, what is the matter with you?" Professor Snape asked but Draco couldn't tell if it was the Snape on his right or the Snape on his left that asked. His response though was to vomit all over Goyle who looked positively disgusted. He heard Snape ordering Crabbe to carry him, and Goyle was dismissed to everyone's relief.
A small figure with black unruly hair had closed the door and Remus had to hold his head. No it couldn't be. They had all been searching for Harry Potter for over a month. Trying to find any clue on Harry's whereabouts, even going so far as chasing the Hebridean Black. But was it Harry? He took a few staggering steps, almost desperate. He made it to the door, and with one last lingering doubt, he pushed it open.
"That- well I thought- I was only messing around- no." Harry laughed at him.
"Please, Granger's been yapping since first year, I think I hear her more often than the Professors. Did you send Potter a love letter?" Blaise said as quietly as someone like him could be.
"If anyone asks, we were out flying over the marshes, but it doesn't matter, because no one is going to ask." Ginny explained, staring at Harmony's lips. Lip gloss. Of course, she knew that something was missing. "People eat up simple explanations. Trust me, I've been off visiting Blaise all summer and no one's noticed."
"Hey, Ginny do we do this every class?"
"That'd be fun," Harmony laughed, "we could fight."
"And then she left us, all heart broken." They themselves left in a play of acted woe.
"Then share." She had already left and Harmony turned to Draco.
"F-ck…Ginny there's something I think I should tell you, and it's going to sound incredibly strange..."
"I didn't tell you about that necklace," he said and Harmony brought a hand to it, "it's a family heirloom."
"Don't harm him! Padfoot stop!" Harmony yelled. Draco had his wand pointed at the dog while at the same time trying not to get his foot torn off. He was thinking of a spell that wouldn't hurt the animal, and failing. It sank its teeth into the back of his ankle and he cursed aloud.
"But how would he know? It's not like you were walking around in drag." There was a lingering silence that was only disturbed by a rustling of a page being flipped as Harmony recalled a certain flowing cream colored sundress. "No, way!" Ginny whispered. Harmony's checks began to sprinkle a ruddy hue. "Oh, Merlin, that must have been a treat. Hey! I want to see too!" Ginny pouted. "Please!"
"Yeah, but not tonight," Leighton said, "tomorrow is a Hogsmead trip." The three of them looked at him with unblinking eyes, "opps."
"Harmony!" Draco yelled, "let's go over the Forbidden Forest!"
This winter holiday break would be the first time since June that Harmony was apart from Draco. Harmony told herself that she wasn't one of those girly girls. She knew that she didn't need a man around all the time. So when the invitation to spend the winter with the Weasleys came, Harmony took it without a second thought. Draco could have uninterrupted time with his father, she could have uninterrupted time with Ginny, and everyone would be happy.
"Good job, here's a magically invisible cookie." Harry reached in her pocket for one and handed him some air. "Now don't eat it all at once." Dudley stared at his hand as they continued on heading for the house.
Harmony knew that she should probably stop this, and turned to finish unlocking the bolts. "I'm leaving now." She said, opening the door, and listened as shards of glass slipped off.
Harmony looked at her mum weirdly. She was friends with one of her professors? Then why did he fail her in everything?
"Big D, you mean Harry your cousin?"
"Was it my father or mother that Lo—"
"Um. Not there." Ginny pointed downward.
"Voldemort doesn't care about anyone, he'll just kill whoever happens to be between him and what he wants. Like Cedric Diggory, he was murdered just for being there," Harmony said. Draco thought about how connected she was to the Dark Lord. Draco was scared for her, scared that when things in the war started heating up, she was going to be right in the line of fire. And what was worse was that she didn't even seem to care, she didn't give a damn about what happened to herself.
"What are you talking about?" Harmony wondered, "and it's still too dangerous for you to be out again."
"We'll owl you, Harry!" Ginny shouted over the grunts of the train, "so do have fun!"
The girl opened the door, and though he knew that it was Harmony, she painfully reminded him of another. Behind her came Draco, and he lifted a brow at him. He closed the door. "Professor," Harmony began, "we want to know more about the Dark Lord." Severus looked from the two and the frown persisted.
"I can't gain weight." Harmony remarked, "too much malnutrition when I was too young."
She was close to him, able to see his face clearly. She let the cloak slip to the stone ground, and Draco gave a surprised start. "Wow," he said, "That explains a lot." He moved from the wall. "I was about to go and meet you."
"Honestly, that's about it," Jack said, gesturing around the cabin. "We'll give you today to get settled in and start you bright and early learning how everything works. The pay is the same-" and Draco was taken aback, that couldn't be right, "-but there's no rent on the cabin." Ah, that made sense. No more Galleons wasted on a hard bed and scratchy blanket. Draco would be able to afford to eat
"Finish your tea," Draco said decisively. "Then we'll go flying."
‘Whipped cream,” he explained, licking his lips to catch the bit that had transferred.
“Er…” Harry brought a hand up and ran it through his hair; the wind had already undone any small bit of style he’d managed. “I found the spell to stop them, but
seemed to know more than he should, and he had friends in the Ministry now - including Shacklebolt, the interim Minister of Magic himself, at least until elections. It stood to reason that Potter would be aware of the true nature of the ritual, of Draco's complete loss of magic.
"One of us will have to direct it. Shield spells would be the best option, but only a very strong one would do. Oh! But..." She trailed off unhappily. "A wand would act as a lightning rod, as an active spell is more powerful than passive wards. Whoever was casting might end up absorbing your magic."
“You are,” Draco murmurs into the kiss.
“I think I’ve learned to bake a pretty good one,” Potter said wryly.
The last game of the season arrived before exams. Surprisingly, Ravenclaw had a chance to win it all this year, breaking a long Gryffindor streak, and only Hufflepuff stood in their way.
“And how do you know he doesn’t feel the same? Tell me, if he
"Can't he just tell them to fuck off?" Harry sneered. "Or have Kingsley do it, even?"
. Harry laughed nervously. "Course not. I figure you require a rather fancy dinner before… that."
"I'm sure Father is pleased, in whatever grave they dropped him," Draco spat furiously.
There was one each of red, yellow and green apple trees. Draco, peckish after his long, wending walk through the grounds, selected the largest apple he could see from the red tree and looked at it admiringly before biting in. The
“Squishy?” Potter stifled a laugh.
“That’s understandable. Ghosts can be agitated when they first arrive back on our side. I’m surprised it happened so fast, though. And why was he in the Forest?”
“Any of it. Torture, murder. You aren't your aunt.”
Draco laughed at that, and Harry pressed on. "And it belongs to Julian, and it's big enough I can get a bit lost inside. And... I'm sure, without Voldemort living there, it's really nice looking."
But Draco went serious, and stared at him for a long moment, then with no small amount of wonder in his voice, said: “I never expected this.”
her," Harry answered haltingly, but it obviously pained him to say it.
"I didn't ask for your companionship!
Finally it was too much, and Draco came explosively, shrieking and twisting in his bonds. Harry stroked him through it, and with a wave cancelled the
The gaslights ignited of their own accord, helpfully illuminating his trek through the old passageways. At least the house had finally taken a liking to him.
"What!"
Typical Day in Harmony's sixth year:
"Why is he here?" Ron asked with his usual lack of tact. Draco stopped reading off the ingredients and glared at the red head.
"Whatever," Draco said, and ignored Blaise who followed him back to the common rooms.
Ginny thankfully didn't go back to sleep, as Ron would have done, and nodded her head. Harmony elongated her pillow and put it under her blanket, Ginny did the same. The next moment a caracal, blended into the shadows, as Flitwick, who was on duty, rested his tired eyes on his hands. She went passed sleeping bodies, making not a single soft noise, and in her human mind, she recalled where Draco had slept. She lay low, as if the sleeping students were wild grass.
"Nope." Ginny stared at Harmony with fierce eyes until she admitted, "we're eloping."
"Since there is the Hogsmeade trip this Saturday, is it possible to reschedule the lesson?"
"Careful," he said, "you wouldn't want to burn your pretty eyes, too." Heat tinted her cheeks and she hotly turned away. Nope, he definitely had not changed.
"Well," Draco smirked, "considering that we're two boys, I don't see what the fuss is all about."
"As I recall, I am teaching one class," he motioned them over with both his hands. "I don't care about any of the differences or rivalries, it doesn't matter to me." They stood in a cluster in front of him, severely aware of the other. "When ever I have a lesson, feel free to sit on the floor, and when ever we practice we will get into groups. This is our playground." He spread his arms around.
"Not if he is going to treat me like a child. Professor, I don't know who else to go to." Harmony looked to him, she was too naive. And he did not wish for her to change that.
"My class, my rules," Leigthon turned away from Draco. "The animagus transfiguration will enable each of you a higher level of magic control. We will start each lesson with animagus practice, and the rest of the time will be for other things."
The beginning of the game was usually slow, and if she had been playing she would have probably been circling around and just watching everybody. Draco seemed to be scanning the stands, not the game, and Harmony knew that he was watching for her. An eyebrow rose and she wished that she she could be a snitch and be impossible to spot. Too bad seekers were trained to catch the golden snitch, and Harmony saw Draco smirk as they stared at each other. He trailed off, and Harmony wondered if maybe he would actually play the game now.
"You know, Harry started trusting Draco about half a year before he disappeared. The two of them were acting really strangely. Hanging out with one another...Staring at one another." Hermione said. Harmony met her gaze steadily. "I have another question for you." Hermione continued, "are you Harry?"
"Luna, what are you talking about?" Ginny asked.
Her eyes were drawn to two dull looking rings that were stacked behind the colorful display. She could not have known it, but there was magic thinly laced into the metal. It was such a small amount of magic, that she could easily have missed it, but chance rested her eyes there. She made her way to the counter and crouched to see it better. These two rings did not look special, and she was about to turn away when the old man saw her looking. He had just finished giving back the small change to Ron, but knew an opportunity for a sale when he saw one. Behind thick glasses were eyes that looked like bulging masses.
"I for one hope that this professor is hot, so that I have something to look at during class," Ginny added with a faint smile.
"I only said that so the other boys would not bother you, no need to think that all of my motives are to spite you."
"If it's a problem for you," Leighton continued to smile, "then you come up with a better one."
"Yep, unless it was fate," he gave her a wry lift of his lips, to which she returned with a huff.
Night had fallen by the next time Hedwig descended. When Draco emerged through the clouds it was over a small muggle town, where each of the little box houses looked exactly the same as each of the others. That didn't seem to confuse the owl though. She headed straight for the second floor window of one of those houses and perched on the windowsill. The owl tapped on the glass impatiently, allowing him time to catch up. And Draco saw a familiar face behind that glass. A familiar face that opened up the window. He was just close enough to hear her exclaim "Hedwig!" Saw her untie the letter from Hedwig's leg, which simply stated I found you, in his precise handwriting.
"What's wrong with you, Malfoy?"
"That's mean," Luna said.
It was Snape who knew first. He had his arm clutched as he rushed to McGonagall and whispered something into her ear. The parting words faded from her mouth, and magnified once more as she told them all to get back into the castle. Professors acted at once, scrambling up the students to the main doors, all the while the gray clouds dulled, morphing and taking shape.
"Come on," he said with a smile.
"Tell me, what does he benefit from helping you? What are you giving him, hmm? What? You actually think that he is doing this from the goodness of his heart. No." Draco spat out. When Harmony did not change her expression, Draco tensed even more. "Are you going to say that you trust him?"
"School will end in two more days my girl, and all of the professors are willing to excuse you for missing work."
"Who, cub?" the Professor asked.
"And you said, yes?"
Harmony glanced down at Draco's tattoo, tracing her finger down the image of the Hebridean Black, watching it move under her touch. "Brazil," Harmony replied, "and why not?"
"And how would you know that?" Draco asked crossing his arms.
"Butterbeer," she said, and took one out of three that was handed to her, "thanks."
"Weren't you just thinking about Dean Thomas?" Harmony asked.
Draco looked down at his hands, and the words settled with a pang of affliction. His father had killed Harmony's father, and he had done nothing. He could not meet her eyes, without knowing that he had caused part of that sorrow. "I didn't know," he said quickly, as if to convince her that it wasn't his fault. He didn't know that Sirius Black was somebody dear to her, and he had not known what to do. "I'm sorry." Draco could see the marks of tears drip down her face, and he dared not wipe them away.
"No Blaise, I couldn't care less about who is friends with Potter."
Draco didn't let go of her hand. "Nothing," she said, "just some vanilla extract." His mouth dropped.
"Oh…."
All of a sudden, Ginny's lips were on Harmony's-kissing her. Full out snogging her. Draco could see from where he was sitting how the Weasley-girl's tongue moved around the inside of his girlfriend's mouth.
The next two days strained Harry as she felt paranoid of being discovered. The end feast in the Great Hall mourned Cedric Diggory. He also said his farewells to Fleur and Krum. It was as if someone was watching her from afar. She was glad when she got on Hogwarts Express to find an empty compartment along with her friends. She didn't join in on their conversation preferring to stare out to the passing cloudless scenery.
"Go on." Ginny said, unimpressed.
"It's alright, Cub," Leighton shouted, "Hook's safe." They then saw a bird passing them. It swooped up and twisted into circles before spreading its wings and joining the stunned faces.
"Harmony," Draco whispered by her ear. Her step faltered. He couldn't possibly know that she was thinking about him.
"So you feel guilty for treating me like shite. Why not just leave me alone as an apology?"
"Alright, mate," Ron yawned, "if you act up again, I'll be right next you." She smiled back at him, but was unsure whether he saw it, or if he was already asleep. Harmony went under the covers, not wanting to go back to sleep. She grabbed her pillow and stuck her face into it, feeling the sticky heat.
"Are we still playing this game Draco?" Blaise asked.
"You wish."
"What is is?" Luna asked her.
The heavy smell of dirt mixed with humidity hit him first. There were trees that reached up as far as he could see, with extended branches and leaves that covered the sun. He could still see clear enough, and the others had their necks bent looking up. Something leaped above him, but it was too far to see. "Welcome to Madagascar," Kingscross said smiling, throwing his arms back in the process. An animal was screeching from far above them, and Draco thought that it wasn't so impressive, just a bunch of large trees and little vegetation.
"Yes Dash?" Leighton said.
"He had detention with Snape," Ginny said, joining them.
"I guess we can go with Leighton then, and have some fun," she said and smiled as Draco twitched.
"Their eyes won't leave me." Harmony whispered. Ginny walked over and pulled Harmony into her arms. "These feelings… maybe something is controlling me. Ginny, I just don't know who I am anymore, like I'm just split." Ginny just kept on holding her. Harmony didn't know how long she cried there.
…..NOT GRYF-
"You are being antisocial! Malfoy is making you hate everything." Harmony now really wanted to shove the doorknob in his gob.
They hadn't been able to take the locket from her hand. He could feel the effects of the locket on him. It whispered in his ear. Will you stab the fang through her hand? It laughed. Kill her with the the basilisk venom? You don't want to save her. She despises you, blames you for Sirius's death. The image of Leighton and Harmony played out before him. They were against each other laughing at him. Leighton molded to her lips, taking her away from him. Draco clenched the fang and the darkness surrounded him. Kill her! Draco lifted the chain of the locket and placed the tip of the fang on one the glass windows. It pricked the eye at it's pupil. She will never be with you! It screamed, You will kill her!
"Why is he here?" Harry glared at the man standing in front of him.
"And how does one split the soul?" Luna asked.
"I heard that they needed an eligible male to be your dance instructor," Sirius said, returning the attention back to him. Harmony hoped that it wasn't Snape. Talk about awkward. "And I think that I have more than enough ample time and skill."
"Home is no longer safe," Severus said, "and take to heart what is most important to you." Draco thanked him before leaving.
"Nah, just pulling your leg. We can see that's he's different. Less intolerable. I suspect that its your doing, Harry." Harmony shrugged her shoulders.
"How would we ever be able to overcome those kinds of venom?" Ginny asked. "It would kill us instantly."
Draco's concentration that he usually paid to the potion was elsewhere. His eyes lingered to her hands, as she kneaded a dough like thing, shaping it into an animal before throwing it at their cauldron. He luckily caught it before it fell into the pot. "What is this?" he asked.
Ginny scanned Harmony's new look critically, targeting one new addition. She grabbed the girl's hand and turned it, looking at the ink design that started just at her forearm, and curved its way up to her shoulder. "Oh no, you didn't."
"This is so pointless," Harmony stated and awoke Ron in the process.
"Come on Potter, I'm only teasing, you don't need to get all sensitive." Draco said silkily. She huffed, choosing to ignore his presence. "How about I treat you then?"
She was sucking on an ice cube when she heard a load crack to her far right. Harmony reacted instantly, pulling out her wand and crouching low under the table. After a few moments of silence, nothing still moved. She was tempted to hide in the café store, but figured that it would be more dangerous during night. She bit down on the ice cube, cracking it in half. Harmony crept through the side of the café towards the back further, away from the apparation. If she had been able to use magic she may have investigated, but she knew the Ministry wasn't too hot for her.
"Get a good night's rest," Ginny patted Harmony's messy hair. Harmony looked at Ginny and for a second thought she saw grief from the girl, but Ginny smiled and held her tightly for one more moment before letting go.
"It is hard to say, none have attempted to split their soul so many times."
Hermione gasped and checked the time before grabbing Ron's hand and saying a quick goodbye and that she would return later. Harry couldn't help but laugh at Ron's happy face at holding hands with her. He did feel better that they came, and hoped that Dumbledore would return. Madame Pomfrey came back into the room when she saw that the visitors had left.
Harmony crossed her arms, "Why did you kiss me?"
The moment he thought that, he stopped. It was easy to see her and forget who she was. All he had to do was repress the little fact that she was the Dark Lord's enemy, and that she would probably die by his wand. It was all effortless to forget, to forget what he was doing. But it wasn't that simple. Draco clenched his fists tight and forced his body to halt. He felt his mind divided and conflicted. It was impossible to forget.
"Today's class," Snape began in a drawl, "we will review nonverbal and wandless spell work." Harmony was at least grateful that he didn't fling axes at their faces, though his eyes were probably doing that for him. Leighton had made sure that they knew the basics of nonverbal magic, so when class began, Snape frowned as most of the students had at least some inkling on nonverbal magic. He scanned the heads, looking for something in particular, and stopped when he met Harmony's eyes. "Even more difficult than nonverbal magic is wandless magic. And more still, combining the two takes years of rigorous training and a very skilled wizard. Black and Weasley why don't the two of you demonstrate for the class on both forms of magic."
"Don't disappoint me." Draco heard before closing the door.
"Whatever." She replied with a raised eyebrow.
Draco watched Snape from across the room in feigned interest, while well aware of the occupant sharing his desk. He had not spoken a word to Harmony for the five days since classes resumed. Draco kept his face impassive whenever the girl glared at him, and he was beginning to believe that her lips would be permanently pressed in a tight line.
"What are you talking about?" Harmony asked. It was the first thing she had said to him since he had asked her out.
"No," Harmony said, "he's not."
Ughh. A tiny part of her wanted to. A persuasive part that didn't always listen to reason. She wanted to know what was his problem. Why he had to mess her up at every possible moment.
The day passed easily enough, Transfiguration with McGonagall had them turn needles into small crowns. Hagrid had shown his students innocent enough looking rabbits with antlers. Harmony was beginning to feel that the day would turn out for the better, until that was when she checked her schedule and saw the inked in letters spelling Divination. She cursed her fowl luck.
"YOU!" Voldemort roared from the back of her throat, like it was a curse. She searched the girl's eyes, not even having to read her mind to piece parts of it together. "How- No. Severus lied to me!"
"You're joking, right?"
Then the visions clouded her. There was nobody but herself, in the darkness. Hogwarts and her friends were gone. Nothing, just an emptiness. The eyes opened in the black, and she knew that Tom Riddle was there. Give up, she heard, you will fail. There is no love for somebody like you. Something twisted at her hand, and scratched her body. Overwhelming sorrow mingled with hate flooded her senses. She couldn't do anything as something twisted around her body. She chocked on her own loneliness as arms and vines looking like snakes grappled with her. There was no noise, not a sound came from her lips. She was torn, torn from the snakes and dropped to the floor.
"I can handle boys just fine without your help," she told him, "What, are you scared that I will go after other guys, or something?" She added jokingly, attempting to conceal her unease and erratic emotions.
"Ah, now the fun begins." Blaise said, pulling Ginny near. He wrapped an arm around her waist, grinning. Blaise led Ginny inside, turning over his shoulder to ask "you two coming?"
"Yeah, that's a good laugh." Neville joined in, "With P-professor Snape leading them in with his g-giant nose." Ron laughed and back slapped Neville, hitting Harmony in the process.
"Well, as a baby I was magically concealed as male, but now the spell is gone and this is me." She shrugged her shoulders. What else could she say? Maybe scare them and say that she was pregnant.
"They ran the other way," Draco said, almost out of breath.
"All the better," Draco said. Harmony felt as if there were more than one pair of eyes watching her, watching them. She looked around as couples danced with each other. She hadn't always been the best dancer, and she never danced in heels before. She was going to suggest that they sit, when he started to move. He danced a little at first, and she laughed when he missed a step or did his own flare. Harmony followed him, swinging her hands and tapping her feet.
"What's the matter Frisker? Can't keep up with everyone?" Professor Kingscross broke the silence, and let Draco go. Humiliation coursed through Draco's being, and he wanted to crucio that bloody wanker. Draco spun around but he had already eluded him.
'There is still time to save Draco's mum,' Harmony thought. Voldemort looked to his forearm where the dark mark burned black.
"Guys, I'm really not in the mood." She was just glad that all of the mouth ridden curtains were drawn.
Then out of nowhere she had caught his eye. Even then, he probably wouldn't have noticed if not for the sleek dragon tattoo. There was something more than pretty about the girl. There was a flicker of danger about her, a ferocity hiding below the surface. He recognized the feeling from working with dragons. His hand moved to the shiny patch that wrapped around his forearm, a reminder of a dragon that had been unassuming. A runt that had seemed calmer than the rest before it had nearly killed him.
"Very good," Leighton said, "but it's too late, the mouse just died." Draco glared at the man and tried the different spells on the mouse anyway. The mouse jerked whenever a spell hit it, and it looked much better without the ribs and innards poking through. It was a very cute mouse by the time Draco finished. And then with a final touch, Animum pulsare, the heart restarter, the mouse twitched and lived once more .
"No, I'm not Harry, that's obviously a boy's name. I'm Marry Jane, your semi local mystery girl." She ended in a slightly believable courtesy.
"Yeah, and so now you'll be freezing your bum off in the bleachers." Ginny carefully halved an apple and placed it on Harmony's plate. "So rooting for Draco?" she whispered. Harmony had a goblet to her mouth and nearly spewed it on Ron's face. Luckily, it only went passed his head.
"First," Draco held her hand as they walked, "if you agree to go out with me." If she hadn't been holding his hand, she may have stumbled over her high heels. His steel gray eyes filled with determination and Harmony smiled up at him.
"You must be joking," she said. He smiled at her. Two things were clear to her. Draco Malfoy was raving bonkers, and she would be just as mental to say yes. "Why?"
"What is the meaning of this!" Draco spat. He felt cheated. "Why the hell are we here, in some kind of warped playground?" There wasn't anything animal like or natural about the place. Kingscross breathed in heavily.
The girls moved their arms in unison, and the embarrassment Harmony felt at first subsided as she began to enjoy the exercise. It was the single dancing that she had never experienced before, one where it did not matter if she skipped a beat, or completely botched up the routine. She held the feeling of freedom, of flying, and when it ended her heart echoed with the diminishing beat.
Draco tried to be himself at the party. Tried to forget everything that happened, but couldn't.
"Do I have a choice, or are you blackmailing me again?"
"There's so much Draco, for you to lose." Snape looked down at him and sneered. "Would you give up your family? Betray them?"
"Hmm," Blaise stretched out and scratched his short almost black hair lazily, "you'd think that Granger would have thought of it already, being Harry's best friend and all, but I can see now that the girl is busy with the red head. I haven't seen the trio together for quite some time. Did you get them to hate each other Draco?" Draco took a knife and cut his toast in a clean cut.
"Why do you need to find Potter anyway?" Micheal asked, guessing where she was going as he looked down at his girlfriend.
"It's hard to explain…" she tried and brushed fine hairs away from her eyes. His gaze was still on her, waiting. "I picture what I want in my mind and project the image through magic onto my face."
"No one is telling you to listen to me, Potter. But if you want to pass potions this year, just a little cooperation is needed. I plan to get good marks, so do hurry up and get the ingredients while I set up."
"Hey Fred!"
"And who may you be?" The investigator cut off.
He could remember the plan that Dumbledore had outlined for him. And you will tell him. Dumbledore's words repeated through his head. But when Severus opened his mouth, nothing came out. Something was stopping him, a whisper in his ear, so faint, but it wrenched his heart from saying what he had been instructed to. Severus. It was a voice which haunted him, so small and soft. And he knew that he could not tell the Dark Lord that Harmony had turned into a girl. "Severus?" screeched in his ear, draining him.
"Hey, Potter," Draco said, and caught Harmony's eye before correcting himself, "I mean Harry."
All at once a spell from Harmony struck his father's face, and Draco knew that there would be more blood to pay. "You!" is father spat, and cupped the wound at his face. The wand in Harmony's shaking fingertips was wrenched from her grasp and flung away with a spell. "Who is this?" His Father directed at Draco.
"So what do you want to see first?" Harry asked, "There's Hagrid's hut, the library, the kitchen, the trophy room, the clock tower, or er- the, well that's it."
"You want to bet," Harmony glared at her friend, "cause we both know how lousy you are with bets."
The night before her birthday, Harmony spent her time taking a steaming bubble bath. Her fingers massaged shampoo into her short hair. It was all too surreal, but looking at her body she was irrevocably a girl. Curves were developing, and finally she had an arse. It was so embarrassing having breasts, she couldn't even look at them without a bra on, and even then it looked wrong. She knew the little bastards were conspiring to grow without any regard to her wishes. She could practically fit her entire hand around one and she really wondered why guys were crazy over them. She missed her flat chest.
"Describe to me what you saw." He commanded. She looked at him, not sure if she should trust him.
"I'm home schooled," Harmony said, "but I always wanted to go to Hogwarts."
"I came here to buy something, not to watch you fight, though the 'watch you' part may be accurate," he gave her a smirk. "Cause it seems like such great entertainment, go on, continue why you shouted that you aren't a weak little boy." He continued to eye her, and laughed a bit in a self satisfied kind of way. It made her knuckles go white.
"Lumos!" he yelled, and he could see Harmony just below him. He grasped her just as they were caught by vines. "Harmony!" he pulled her close as the vines wrapped around him. Ginny and Luna thudded after him, and struggled to get near.
"But you look much better as a red-head." He continued quietly. Pleased to see that he had finally coaxed some sort of reaction out of her. "I don't know why you are wasting your time with that Corner fellow, you could do much better than him."
"Yes," Ron said, "because he's tricking you."
"Obviously because I do not want to see the two of you at the same time," the Professor snarled. But Draco heard none of what Snape or Ron were saying, all what fell to his ears were the light rustling of clothes as Harmony picked at her shirt. He had handed her a handkerchief, which he followed with his eyes as she used it to collect vanilla. She handed it back to him, and Harmony said not a word. The last direction was for the potion to settle in the dark for a night. He collected it into a glass vessel and covered it. Draco was thankful that the students who finished could leave early. He left before her, but stood near the entrance.
"That can't be," Draco said.
"See," he said, "it's not so bad." They shrugged their shoulders, and it seemed true, at least for the first day. The night that he slept with it resting on his chest, he began to feel something odd and invasive in his sleep. His dreams were of Harmony as a girl, and though that would have made him happy, it was not he who was kissing her. Leighton took his place, and had Harmony against his bare chest. The image seared into his mind, and Draco felt his blood boil till he finally awoke. Draco lashed out at his covers and went straight to the loo to wash his face. But still the images continued. He could see Harmony and her eyes heated with desire. It didn't help either that Leighton was more fit than him. Her hands had trailed down his toned back and through his hair. He could almost see the smirk and golden glint in the other man's eyes. Draco wanted to retch the terrible feeling out of him, and the way she had looked at him. Draco gripped the locket, pressing the snake into his palm. He wanted her, wanted her to look at him like that.
"She's not going with you, you already took her once today during breakfast to do your nails. Absolutely not." Draco cut in.
"We better not be going anywhere wet!" Draco spat and wiped the remains of sand from his mouth.
"Do you think that these detentions will show on our records?" Draco asked, looking for something that was light. "Because I'm wondering how it will look, by the end of the year with your 100 detentions with Snape."
"It's the locket, isn't it?" Ginny asked. "I noticed it before, that suffocating feeling." Ginny came closer and held out her hand. "Let me see it." Harmony hesitated a moment before relieving the locket from her robe. Ginny closed her eyes when the locket touched her palm and shuddered. "Oh."
"And that's a bad thing?" Draco muttered, and ceased to mention the Dark Lord's insanity anymore, from Snape's furrowed eyebrows creating a hairy caterpillar. "Wouldn't it be like the Dark Lord is partially kissed from a dementor? If he only had pieces of his soul."
Draco shrugged realizing that all this meant was less time for Blaise's talking and Ginny's interfering, shooting two birds with one spell. He sipped his tea content.
"Then you're going the wrong way," he said with an amused grin.
She wasn't going to say out right that Draco was on her mind, so instead she stuffed a huge piece of toast in her mouth, "Like voldemort," she said after a few seconds of chewing.
"You and your father can rot," she stared at Draco. "He was a dad to me, and you watched him die."
Draco Malfoy clenched his fists tight enough for his short trimmed nails to dig into the fleshy part of his palm. He stared angrily at the top of the ceiling to his bed, at lines that crosshatched from the abuse of many spells. The morning sun had come up by now, but there were no windows to see it. He put a fist to his head and pushed down hard enough for the bed to groan in distaste. "It's all wrong," he said aloud, not having to be quiet since he never had to share a room with anyone. He hadn't been following the plan; the plan for him to best Potter. Draco had been sure that it would be easy and simple. He had played the charmer, hid his disgust, crafted his face to be the image of absolute desire, and the most he got in response was marginal trust and reluctant acceptance. Sure there were some instances where it looked like Potter and him were making progress, as if she would be interested in something more. But Draco wasn't sure anymore if he wanted to continue. And he had no idea why.
Harmony crossed out her plans and began to doodle instead of doing her potions essay. She especially liked to charm the ink so that it moved. Her ink splatter people danced, and she cursed when she realized that she had been drawing all over her essay. She doubted that Snape would like figures doing the cha cha.
"Harmony, look out!" Ginny had thrown a huge ax her way, aiming at the bear, and struck it into the wall a foot away from Harmony's head.
She pushed the door open, surprised at its heaviness. The smell of perfume hit her in a wave and she looked around at the large expanse of the room. The florescent like lighting hurt her eyes and she could see girls stretching in little shorts and tank tops of all different colors. They noticed the very embarrassed looking Harry Potter, and giggled and whispered amongst themselves. She scanned the room and saw what must have been the professor.
"Voldemort is calling you," Dumbledore nodded his head, as if he had expected it. "He is desperate. Going so far as to break into the Ministry of Magic."
"What is it called?" Harmony asked in a soft tone.
"Alright," Snape returned to his desk and watched her with keen eyes. Harmony left him and she wondered if he was acting stranger than usual. She had almost forgot to put on her Harry disguise when she heard some footsteps near. She ran to her room without meeting anyone, and got ready for the next day. The weekend was coming soon.
"So who is the other ring for?" Ron asked as they left the store. "What's her name?" Harmony laughed besides herself.
"Not really," Harmony mumbled. Leighton took a step back and confronted the other two girls.
"No," she said and was about to shut her door. Unfortunately, his large foot blocked its path.
"Right, but I think that I can manage," Draco sat down with Blaise. Pansy was further off glowering into her rice pudding. Crabe and Goyle were stuffing their fat mouth's, and Theodore Nott was no where to be seen. All of the Slytherins had become paranoid of saying something beyond the trivial. They were all neck stiff and sour. "What happened to Nott?" Draco whispered to Blaise, who looked at him sharply and shook his head.
“This way?” Harry asked, catching on to what Draco wanted. He slipped a hand down and rubbed one finger over Draco’s arsehole. Distantly, Draco questioned if Harry had done this before, then quickly decided it didn’t matter. He seemed to know what he was doing, in any case, slowly pushing one finger into Draco’s heat.
Like magic.
Harry leaned over his shoulder, perplexed. "Do what?"
"Thank God for house-elves, right?" Harry said sarcastically. "Oh, here it is." He set about trying to free the stuck jar lid, finally slamming it down in frustration. "Are you just going to watch me?"
So his mother had bought herself a nine month reprieve. More to the point, Lucius had bought the continued existence of a Malfoy estate with his own life. They had already sacrificed Narcissa's ability to have more children. The amount of magical energy required to break that spell and guarantee conception must have been massive. Nothing but the lord of the Manor would have sufficed.
"You were just going to stay up here alone for the rest of your life?" Draco shrugged yet again, and Potter shook his head at him. "It isn't good for people to be completely alone."
“No, I didn’t,” Draco answers.
"As one does in the library," she replied stiffly.
" Draco's flask was immediately filled with cold water.
Harry's face grew soft, and he silently reached out and cupped Draco's cheek, then turned and pressed his thumb into the wet spot on the fresco. Out of nothing, a new badge appeared, and a name formed in the same sharp calligraphy as the rest:
"My cousin?" A strange expression passed over Malfoy's face, longing and regret and nostalgia all mixed up. Harry could only nod. There were decades of family issues hidden in that look, and it wasn't something he felt comfortable addressing. Still, it was one more facet of this new Malfoy to catch the light, slowly illuminating the person he'd become.
would be offended that he assumed —”
“Please, Harry. We’re having such a wonderful time.”
Draco is going to have to make a decision fast. The sight of Harry on his knees — oh, who is he kidding, the decision is already made.
“Not at all,” Harry said, thinking of how thrilling it had been to get a room of his own, rather than a cupboard with feet pounding on the stairs above.
Of course Luna would think it was less private to show up on Malfoy’s doorstep rather than just call him. “Fine, where is that?”
“Circe’s sake, Potter, I’m not delicate,” Draco growled, and leaned back in.
"Why would that make me feel
It was boring without him around, arguing and laughing, tracking Draco with lustful eyes. After reading for a few hours failed to keep Draco's attention, he wandered down the hall where Brutus Malfoy's portrait was kept. Octavia was yet again in residence.
” Draco let the word fall from his mouth as if he'd eaten a bad strawberry. “I'm simply not letting an opportunity pass me by. I'll do my due diligence once I arrive.”
"Hello?" he called out. His mouth didn't move.
“Rather bold of you to assume I passed.” Malfoy took a long swallow of the orange drink, glancing at Harry from the corner of his eyes.
Over the years, Draco had become very good at self-deception. It was sometimes easier to ignore difficult things than deal with them, after all. Sometimes he thought ‘evasion’ should be right up there with ‘cunning’ and ‘resourceful’ in the Slytherin description that every first-year learned.
"Why did you send for me? What has happened to my mother?" One of the guards glanced up at that, and exchanged a knowing look with the other.
"The wards?" Harry appeared puzzled. "You mean that keep people out?"
Harry scowled, the moment broken. "What's wrong with Muggle songs?"
“Very gentle wards that will stop anyone from falling off. They’re especially useful with small children around,” Draco added, thinking of his little cousin.
Lucius glanced up, then drew up to his full height. "Draco. I did not call for you."
"I... oh."
“I don’t have issues,” Draco protested half-heartedly. Pansy patted his hand gently.
“Goodbye, Potter. Good luck.” Harry saw Malfoy glance down at his hand, and hesitate, before fading back into the Forest.
Ginny shrugged, "Not exactly, but I gave us waterproof makeup just in case."
As soon as the train whistled and lurched forward, Draco made his move. He sidestepped the stragglers and their bags without so much as a snide comment. His eyes strayed from glass window, to glass window feeling his excitement heighten, till finally something hitched in his throat as he saw the back of her head. He knew it so well, from all the times he had burned holes into it with his eyes when he was so young and petulant.
Now that he knew Potter's weakness, what could he do with it? Well first he would have to confirm if Potty boy was in fact a girl, or would turn into one. Of course not physically, that would be most disturbing. He could do so much with that knowledge. He smirked when he considered that he could tell the Dark Lord and gain his favor. No, he had to milk it for all of its worth. He may blackmail Pothead to do his biddings or something; yes he knew that he was getting closer. Or he would get Potter's trust, then he betray him to the Dark Lord. Hmm, no, how would they be friends. He laughed as he thought of wooing the soon to be girl. No girl could resist him anyway. Draco paused for a moment with his line of thinking. Now that was seemingly impossible and funny at the same time; him and Potter, what a joke. Potter would still be too hideous, anyway.
"Don't call me that, you ferret." Draco feigned a hurt look.
"Yeah, the Daily Prophet's abridged version. I was hoping that you could tell me more." Harmony searched his tired face.
Ginny watched her closely and spied the locket. "What is that?" she pointed.
"Maybe you should live and enjoy your life now before- before whatever happens." Draco gripped the locket from under his shirt and brought it over his head.
"Yeah," Harmony said, "this weekend." Draco pulled his outer robe on and picked up his bag.
I don't believe it, she thought.
"What is the meaning of this?" Snape had an expression which Draco could not read as he placed both hands on Draco's shoulders.
His room was sparse, neat and orderly. There wasn't anything so telling about the boy, except for the fact that it was a tad too dark. All of the furniture was either black or green, and Harmony especially wanted to take down the skull engraved into the wood. He closed the door and Harmony could tell that he rarely, if not ever, had people over. It didn't feel like a room, kind of like the room she had at the Dursleys. "You could use some decorations," she said.
It was a white dragon with an eye of sapphire that swirled like mercury. The door opened once more and she half expected it to be Draco. Ginny, Ron and Hermione slipped in, and Harmony stuffed the dragon back into her bag. "He didn't do anything to you, right Harry?" Ron asked.
"Elves are quite remarkable," she said. "Everyone underestimates them, and forgets how powerful their magic is."
"I'm not how I was before." Dudley suddenly said breaking the silence. Harry arched an eyebrow. "I mean I don't beat up the smaller kids."
"Yes ma'am."
"That's no way for a lady to talk, and I didn't know you had a fixation for my a-"
Draco leaned back in his seat, nearly touching the wall. "You didn't answer either of my questions," he said. Even from the darkness of the room he could see how her cheeks ever so slightly heated with color. With his head titled back, his eyes were slits.
"Yeah, then I could gloat to you that I won."
They thanked her. "Where were you, Harry? I didn't see you all night," Hermione wondered.
"Why did you kiss me?" Harmony said softly.
"If you just want to fool around, then forget it."
"Then don't thank me," he said as liquids vanished with his wand and he set up the rest of the potions at the wall opposite the door. They worked in silence for the remainder of time.
"Tonight. Right after graduation. I'm already packed."
"Harry," he said sounding bewildered, "what are you doing?"
She didn't say anything. Instead, her hands brushed against the back of his neck as she pulled him in. Harmony's lips were on his and this kiss was like none of the others. She kissed him fiercely, again and again, and in-between Draco felt the heat of her breath. He didn't know how long it lasted until it was over and Draco saw Harmony run out with her Firebolt in hand.
"Damn straight you will," he smirked. "So this is why you wanted me to skip class."
"I'm all ears," she said, with a sly smile on her features, which Harmony failed to notice.
"So how is Harry?" Draco controlled his breathing to make it more even and natural. That was Dumbledore's voice.
"Sure," Ginny transformed into a hawk and flew off. They didn't have to wait long as the girl came back on a broom with another in her hand. She threw one down at Draco who caught it. "Hop on, Luna," she said. Luna was already on her head as a tazier lemur before Ginny knew what plopped on her.
"you think you can fly us out as a hawk?"
"Traveled a bit, saw some cool stuff." Harmony said.
"I believe it was Harmony, right?" he asked.
"Excuse me, but what?" Horror filled Harry's face. This old man really was off his trolley. Unless male wizards were different than muggle boys, Harry was totally lost.
Like a statue coming to life, Leighton opened his jaw to say, "Are you very much finished?" and yawned.
"What happened?" Ginny asked.
After breakfast, Draco found himself once again outside the door to the hospital wing, repeating to himself over and over that it was to see if he could learn Potter's weakness. He was unable to hear any of Dumbledore's solemn tale, but he could certainly hear Potter boy.
"No, no, no," Harmony waved her small hand aimlessly before her, as if she could brush it aside like a cloud, "it's nothing like that."
"As you can see it's not busy." She did not want to humor him.
"What?" Harmony lifted an eyebrow, "that hardly makes sense."
"Yeah, but you are dating a Malfoy! You are consorting with the enemy! What do you even see in the guy?" Ron fumed.
"This is none of your business," Ron said.
Harmony and Ron fell into easy old jokes, talking about nothing important, and that was fine with her. They were in a jewelry shop at Hogsmead and Ron's eyes always would dart to the most expensive things in the shop, and then quickly look away. But he would look back again and frown. "Ron," she said, "you really don't have to stress, Hermione will like anything you get for her."
"Er, see you around then?" Ron left them, scratching his head.
"Well I have never seen you before," Harmony protested.
They heard Lupin's voice, muffled by static say: "I'm worried about Harry too but that—"
"Nah, I like this angle better. Plus I can be with you two," she said and waved a flag with a raven on it.
"I screwed up, Professor," Draco said.
"A telly," she supplied, "it's a main source of- er- muggle entertainment." He frowned as he scrutinized the blank screen, and couldn't imagine how it was a source of entertainment. He heard a click, and the screen lit up, shocking him as an image of a car chase and things exploding played before him. He watched as a huge man ripped open a car door, carrying a woman in his arms and some kind of long shiny thing across his back.
"Harry, I thought you liked her," Ron frowned. Harmony shrugged her shoulder.
Harmony returned to blindly watching the moving scenery, trying to regain her tranquility. They had already changed into their Hogwarts robes, and the sky turned inky with purples and oranges. She could still catch the subtle scent that strayed from the unoccupied seat in front of her. It was a mixture of soap, mint, fresh laundry, and something else she couldn't identify.
The two hottest girls in the school, were in his house, in his pool, in bikinis, and making out. He couldn't take his eyes off of them. Their dripping bodies pressed against one another.
"But I have no need for my spirit," Voldemort muttered to himself. And Severus too was coming to understand everything. Whatever was left of the Dark Lord's spirit was too little for his body, as if he were on the brink of death. "There is much amiss," Voldemort said quietly. "Leave me."
"Shite," he said. She pulled out her invisibility cloak, and opened his door.
"What nonsense is this?" But he was beginning to put it together, and he swore under his breath. His dark mark twisted at the skin, burning and commanding him to obey.
The timing couldn't have been any worse when Collin made his rounds through the tables, handing out photos. He watched as the small boy with the large camera headed their way, shuffling through his brown bag before extending a hand with an envelope. Draco didn't thank the retreating form of the boy as he stuck the pictures in his bag. His swift retreat was thwarted as Blaise grabbed his arm. "Well aren't you going to open it? Hell, maybe the kid switched the photos up, and you got Ginger and Granger snogging it up. Come on Draco," Blaise said as Draco pushed him off, "we both know that you are dying to gloat about her." Draco glared at Blaise and the boy lifted his hands up in the air. "Alright, alright, I'm done." Draco took a few steps and sighed when he heard Blaise stand up as well and grab some toast.
“You’re sated, and I’ll be right there with you. Come on, it’ll be fine.”
She and Weasley had arrived some time after lunch. Draco was hardly able to concentrate on what she was saying, or Weasley playing blocks with Julian in the corner of the room, or even Harry's hand holding his own in a supportive gesture. He was still stunned by the twin revelations: Harry telling him there was a chance he could get his magic back, and his own heart telling him he loved this man.
With obvious relief, Harry escorted them all to the parlour to gather their cloaks. Luna and Rolf left first, promising to come back another time and check the garden for Nargles. While Harry was occupied with Ron near the fireplace—discussing the Chudley Cannons, from the sound of it—Hermione cornered Draco on the other side of the room and fixed him with a stare.
Hermione was oblivious to Harry’s thoughts. “She chased down Death to beg him to show her the thread. It’s obviously a parable about the dangers of fixation and the folly of the very concept of destiny.”
“I…” Malfoy baulked, but Harry could tell he was tempted. “I suppose I could. I’m not prohibited from travelling within the bounds of the country. Is there much to see?”
Hermione tells him to get out of the house more often; Ron tells him to get a date. The
"You? You haven't abandoned me!"
) Instead they kissed languidly until sleep took them once more. When he awoke again, the sun was up and Draco could hear birds in the garden. Harry snored beside him; Draco was always the earlier riser.
“I see you’re in the proper section for your reading level.”
“I…” Malfoy looked perplexed. He obviously hadn’t expected Harry to touch him. “About what?”
“I’m pleased you took my advice.” Thinking about Potter hosting a dinner at Inisview, from which Draco would likely be excluded, was bittersweet. “I’m sure it will be a success.”
if I plan to start a bloody career. The next round of training doesn't start until March, I missed the last one. They've only been asking me to come in and show my face because they're under a lot of pressure, with all the magical anomalies." Harry grabbed a loaf of bread. "Don't you have any marmalade around here?"
"Then you know me well enough to answer your own question," she said proudly.
"Draco! Draco. She's gone. There's nothing you can do for her now."
"Fuck no."
time to be young, after everything you went through. And you still are young! Not that I’m calling you immature, and there’s more than one way to ‘grow up.’ But you extended your teenage years out a bit, and you and Malfoy appear to be on equal footing, to me at least.”
"Have you given any more thought to what I asked you?" Harry pushed past Draco without waiting for an invite.
"You haven't left me with the best impression over the years, Malfoy. Yeah, I knew you cared about your parents, but you were also a spoiled prick. How was I to know you were thinking of him, and missing him?"
Draco had rather thought it seemed more like lovemaking, but he wasn’t about to dare say that. “I’m well aware of what happened,” he snapped. “You seemed content to ignore it.”
It broke Draco's heart to see Harry question himself the same way that Draco had been these past few weeks. "No, Harry."
From nowhere he recalled his mother's words, that she could feel his magic when she'd been pregnant with him.
“Well, I don't know about you, but I’ve become rather fond of Budapest.”
"And did she? Already know, I mean?" The prospect of being hauled away for violating his parole agreement still loomed over Draco, but he supposed he could trust Hermione, at least as far as Harry did.
“Of course you don’t.”
“Malfoy?”
“You aren’t,” Harry insisted. “You’re supposed to have your friends help you move. It’s part of the friend contract, don’t you know?”
gone. I didn't think you'd run so far! You've always been... I dunno, creeping around the edges. I figured you'd pop up eventually, demanding I give Julian back."
so elegant and refined. But every name blasted off that tapestry came after months of rowing. And don't believe everything you hear. There was sorrow involved in that act."
Draco knew that he could not appear weak. "The Malfoys may be less preeminent these days," he said haughtily, "but rest assured I will be working to restore us."
Yet gradually, as the afterglow wore off, Draco became uneasy. Harry had talked about
“I got very, very clean in the shower,” Draco whispered suggestively in his ear, before nibbling on it. Harry shuddered, his hips twitching in anticipation.
He bows his head as he catches his breath, and Harry can’t help but reach up and tangle his fingers in Draco’s hair, dark with sweat. Draco doesn’t bat his hand away, but after a moment he rolls to the side, still tangled in his robes, his body hot and sticky against Harry’s.
"-fucking Disapparate yet," Draco finished to the empty air.
“I’d like that, too,” Harry grins. “Go home and pack, and leave your wards open for me.”
“My friends are asking questions,” he began haltingly. “I can keep them off for now, but…”
"He attacked me in the Forest, but it backfired on him as well. He thought he'd killed me, but was too, I don't know, out of sorts to come check. So he sent your mum."
Malfoy couldn’t argue with his own words being quoted back at him. “Why are you so insufferable?” he grumbled. “Is this what I came back for? Harry Potter, my own personal cheerleader? I should have stayed dead.”
"Is she going to be..." Draco trailed off, focusing on a fleur de lis painted on the wall instead.
Harry's words abruptly cut off as Draco slapped him across the face.
"Julian isn't up to reading Martin Miggs yet, but we are certainly enjoying the pictures."
Still, he couldn't help but feel proud that Harry was so eager to claim him.
“I didn’t mean I thought we could be
"How long
missed him after all. "You'll splash the water," he warned even as he sat up to make room.
“Touche.”
"Oh. I guess? I just wanted something to do with my hands. I get... um, anxious, if I'm not doing anything."
Potter seemed twitchy, and kept glancing toward the door. "Never mind. Look, I didn't mean to be gone so long. Can I come back tomorrow, or the day after?"
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “You wish. Next weekend, then?”
When the room appeared mostly clean, Draco began looking behind the drawers and into corners for spots he may have missed. Potter got down on his hands and knees and peered beneath the furniture. He looked absurd with his arse waggling about in the air. Draco averted his eyes.
"Malfoy," the otter said with a voice he tried to place. "You are needed at St Mungo's immediately."
“Do you really think that?” Draco has put some more thought into this over the past few days. “The political climate doesn’t favour vampires, it’s true. But everyone you care about has stood by you through worse than this, yeah?” There will be problems, Draco isn’t stupid. But he finds that he doesn’t want to see the dejected look on Harry’s face every time home comes up.
"I know that sound. That's the nap-time whine." The song faded out as Draco called for Holkey. "Please take Julian upstairs for his nap." She bowed and Apparated herself and Julian to his bedroom. Draco had no problem trusting her with his brother; she'd looked after his own person for years.
It takes a bit more pushing and prodding this time to coax Potter to detach. Once he’s licked all the blood from his lips, his senses return to him, as does the look of disgust.
They made their way down to the glass-enclosed room, where a simple breakfast of milk, oranges, and bread with jam and honey awaited them. They ate in silence as the wind began to pick up. Several flowers from a late-blooming rose bush fell off and stuck wetly to the glass in the humid air.
Draco pointed one trembling finger at Harry. “You’re the one who keeps
"I'm honestly shocked Ron hasn't threatened my life."
As much as he wanted to slice it from his arm in the aftermath of the war, Draco has never actually cut into the Mark. He pauses. What if something happens? In his nightmares, black blood oozes from the snake, covering him until he chokes.
Tuesday evening, a knock on the door pulled Draco away from his supper.
"Sure, we didn't ignore each other. We fought each other, nearly
” she demanded.
"Thank you for pointing that out," Draco answered bitterly. "But yes, in effect.  I'm a danger, don't you see. Can't be trusted."
He considered trying to levitate the vase wandlessly once more, but he'd never been adept at that kind of magic. It was why his mother had to give him her own wand and go defenceless after the incident with the Snatchers. Instead he curled up in an exhausted ball without bothering to change into his nightclothes.
Harry leans up, licks his collarbone. “I’m immortal now, too.”
mean that?" he asked breathlessly.
“He’s a boy. You’re a boy, you’re both boys and you’re both stupid.” She poured a chalky grey powder into a jug and began shaking the concoction. “Cho would agree with me, and Luna and Lavender. Don’t make me owl Hermione to get a consensus.”
"Well,
"Mother was good at finding a weakness."
Harry looked up, checking in with Draco that he could take it; Draco answered by spreading his legs wider.
again.
“I do.” She strode back into the hallway to fetch her broom. “You’d better be cheering for us, Malfoy,” she threw out over her shoulder as she went to join her team.
Narcissa wasn't sick, but they couldn't put a pregnant woman in Azkaban and the Ministry had locked the Manor up. The prison ward of St Mungo's was mostly reserved for criminals who'd been injured during their arrest, not long-term patients. His mother was obviously bored and lonely. Each time Draco arrived, she was staring out the window morosely.
“Draco please — please let me touch you,” Harry panted, staring greedily at Draco’s hard, pink nipples. Merlin, how he loved to pinch them...
"So many of the old families are gone now." Octavia tilted her head, studying Draco's response. "Does that bother you?"
“Whatever you tell yourself to sleep at night.” Cho returned to the music box, but not before adding, “And whatever you tell Ginny when you show up at her game with Malfoy.”
He never got a chance to bring it up, though. As December melted into January, enchanted firewood that burned with various colours and scents became the big seller from the orchard, and Draco found himself chopping it every morning. His hands cracked and bled, and his lips and face grew chapped. Each time he came to visit, his mother stroked his hands and murmured what a shame it was that soft, delicate skin like his should be subjected to such abuse. He burned more energy than he could afford to consume; his clothes hung off his skinny frame. The tears in his mother's eyes haunted him.
“It’s not like that! The Aurors, yeah, that’s a lot of pressure, but — what about my friends? Or Teddy? I can’t see them like this!”
“Yeah. We’ll just… go on as we had been.” Potter nodded, his decisive nod not matched by the turmoil in his eyes.
“What Harry is trying to say is he dug up a grave,” Cho said dryly.
Draco’s way of cleaning had been far more elegant. The teacups practically danced their way onto the shelves, and the wine glasses were always sorted properly. Harry still isn’t entirely sure which glasses are for red or white, or brandy. No matter; he finished the last bottle of brandy a week ago.
“Having a good time?” Harry watched the man consider his answer.
"Julian, no!"
Draco had rushed his work on Thursday in order to make a trip into Teviothead and visit the only boutique in town. He didn't know anything about Muggle children's toys, or what babies really needed, but clothes were clothes, and the soft blue jumper caught his eye immediately. He desperately wished he could cast warming charms or something personal on it, but it would have to do as is. There was no way he was allowing Julian's birthday to pass without giving him
Jack glanced back up at the farmhouse. "Suppose it's not my place to tell you what to do, Mr. Potter. Prefer you'd not come up to our house, at least."
“It’s a nice place, yeah?” he said, gesturing at the house. It was three stories tall, maybe a quarter the size of the Manor, although Draco knew well that looks could be deceiving when it came to size in wizarding homes. The outside walls were covered in stones of various sizes which were worked into the mortar, giving the house a rustic look. The roof was pitched with a flat top, probably a viewing deck for watching the sea. Several more rose bushes crowded along the northern wall, and Draco supposed the rest of the garden must lay behind the house.
“I just thought…” What
Maybe he did want more. He knew he couldn’t have it, and as predicted, it stung more now than ever.
"Here, you can feed him," she offered "He wouldn't take it from me. Seemed like he was waiting for you."
Harry’s presence brightened up the room considerably, and after hugs were exchanged (between the Gryffindors and Gryffindor-adjacent, at least,) they all followed him into the dining room to sit down.
What would he do if someone attacked him? He was defenceless. For that matter, how would he even go about the simplest tasks? The jug on the washstand was meant to be filled with
Eyes still closed, Draco stuck out his tongue.
A thousand questions about Potter and what he'd been doing swirled in Draco's mind, but one stood out:
"Hmm, not as much as you would think. Of course, in Arithmancy we've been working round the clock to figure out what made the dead spot in the Atrium. But the other Unspeakables are nowhere to be seen."
After a brief struggle for dominance, Harry ended up on top, his thighs bracketing Draco's. He bit down on Draco's collarbone, eliciting a sharp gasp. "What is it about you?" Draco moaned, his cock now fully hard and pressing into Harry's stomach. "I've never wanted anyone like this.”
"Wait," Harry asked. "Even the Elder Wand?"
They'd sworn like Jarveys at each other for an hour after breakfast, when Draco had insulted Delby for burning his eggs and Harry told him off for it. Somehow it had devolved into a screaming match about Draco's outdated thinking; he then dared Harry to dismiss the elves and try looking after the house and Julian himself. Two hallways and a random unused bedroom later they fell through the door, with Harry managing to get to his feet first and yank Draco up by the wrist. He began to push Draco against the wall, but at the aroused gasp Draco made at being manhandled, Harry changed tactics mid-way and threw Draco across the bed instead.
"Like everything is brighter when he's around? Like you can't wait to see him again?"
"I can do it myself if you won't."
"I've got a safe word. Three in fact. Fuck you, Potter."
Gathering the courage that he'd found within himself, and the strength that Harry gave him, Draco pulled Harry down.
A full two minutes passed, and Draco knew Harry was growing restless. Soon he would become too impatient to wait, and-
Three days.
"Hermione did tell me that," Potter said petulantly. "But she's not wrong. It makes sense. Not supposed to curse in front of him, either, but, er, that's been difficult."
Every Thursday night was Open Mic Night at the cafe. Harry loved waiting tables during this shift. Most of the musicians and their friends were a good sort, and they were easy customers who didn’t overstay their welcome. It had been a bit of a gamble for the owners to open a gay-friendly cafe, rather than a bar which could profit heavily from alcohol, but the tea, coffee, food, and low-key, casual environment had almost immediately been popular, and after several years it was still going strong.
"You dare cast such aspersions on my client? You had her locked up for weeks while you dragged everything out." Mr. Ravling was really getting into his role. Of course, if the vaults weren't going to be seized by the Ministry his firm stood to make a massive amount of Galleons.
“I was meaning to write her a letter,” Malfoy said hesitantly. “Her, and a number of others. I’m just not sure where to start.”
"We need to work together for any spell to push through the field, so we can't separate like that."
"Please," he pleaded softly, though with no tears or raised voice. "They gave me probation. I'm no threat."
“Let’s clean this one up so you can stay overnight,” Draco offered. “I don’t
deep down, beneath endless layers of sarcasm and evasiveness—Draco knew that he couldn’t avoid the cruelty he’d visited on people forever. The real question was: could he face it in front of Potter and his Gryffindor chums?
Harry wants to grab himself by the shoulders and shake, yell
Malfoy ducked his head in supplication, the ears flattening. They were rather expressive, Harry noticed. Looked soft, too. “Is there anything I can do to convince you to overlook this? It’s only a book.”
"Drink the potion."
The doors burst open in a rush, and tongues of fire licked at the edges of Professor McGonagall's shield spell. Malfoy whirled around in panic, but being a shade, the fire couldn’t harm him, only terrify him. Parvati’s voice grew louder, and light flared from her wand and illuminated the doors, outlining them in vivid blue.
“I have no idea,” Draco answered at last, “but we had better get out of this room.”
He recalled what Potter said about his Muggle relatives, but brushed it aside; the whole time Draco was acquainted with Potter, he'd been accompanied by Gryffindors and featured in the papers.
loose and falling in his eyes. No longer pointed and pinched looking, the past few years seemed to have settled onto Malfoy’s angular face quite well. He glanced up, seemingly unsurprised to see Harry, then went back to whatever he was writing; he appeared nonchalant, but his foot was tapping nervously.
“Oh, gross. You’re totally into him.”
“Yes,” he said at last. “I’ll give it to you.”
Harry left Draco to his own devices regarding the housewarming party. Although it was his suggestion, it wasn’t really his business to plan it. Part of him still worried that it had been a terrible idea, that no one would show up, but the next weekend Ron had cornered him at the Burrow and produced a pale piece of parchment.
He lay flat on top of the covers, stiff as a board, and stared into the near darkness. If he concentrated, he could feel the underlying thrum of magic that was ever-present in the Manor licking at the edges of his senses. How dreadful it would be on the day when it left him forever.
“Oh, I couldn’t —” Draco cut Harry off with a wave.
from the shoddy mattress. Double fuck! Now if Potter never shows up they’ll certainly question Draco — did he see Potter? Interact with him? Murder him?
"It's still stealing." She was reaching for her pocket. Was she summoning a guard? Draco panicked, and now his pathetic expression was real.
