“No more about him,” Harry stated bluntly.
Harry and Hermione both burst out laughing, and Rose looked confused for a second before joining along. Draco’s instinct was to be offended that they were laughing at him… until he realized that they were laughing
Harry stared at him for a few seconds and then stretched his arms above his head.
“Careful,” Draco muttered in a warning tone, quickly pulling Harry’s hands away. “Professional for a little longer, Harry Potter.”
“So says you.” Harry kissed his cheek. “And it was the weird word combined with the French accent, to be honest. You sound hot when you speak French.”
“Oh, I had no idea,” Draco said sarcastically, though his eyes were twinkling and soft.
"Fuck your boundaries," Harry whispered. “What are you afraid of?”
“--and you have Malfoy and Draco, and Dragon, and dictionary…”
“Yes, I’d love a cup, thank you,” he replied politely, his nerves creeping back upon him now that it was just them. Thank Merlin for Rose, the cutest buffer on earth. “Just black is fine.”
Harry only gaped at his feeble joke.
“And truth be told,” Draco continued, “my sense of loyalty to my family was very strong then, even after the war; so much so that I was willing to ignore my own desires in favor of my duty to the Malfoy name. As you can imagine, not many families were willing to attach themselves to us at the time. Well, that’s hardly changed. But when I married Astoria, I thought maybe we could try to restore some honor back to the disgraced house of Malfoy. Live differently than our parents had. Stand for good instead of evil. Repair the name.”
“Yes, well, perhaps we’ll simply have to conduct our romantic interludes within the confines of our homes.”
“Or… you could just stay and hang out for a while,” Harry suggested, attempting to be casual, before sipping his water. “First we can have a quick beat-off in separate rooms, and then we can get drunk.”
Harry gave a low, sexy laugh. “And what are some of those more favorable qualities, Draco Malfoy?”
Before Draco could stop it, he released a primal, strangled yell as he felt himself come, shooting harder than he thought he could, onto Harry’s hand, his cock, his green t-shirt. He felt in utter ecstasy, as if he left his body, barely hearing Harry’s own guttural groan as he came only a few seconds later. The feel of it splashing against Draco's skin made him shiver all over.
“It’s no trouble at all,” Draco promised, letting Rose hit him all she wanted with Oscar the Owl. (Oh dear, he was going to be one of those hopelessly indulgent fathers, wasn’t he?) “You must take after your mother; as I recall, she has quite a good arm.”
“Ron and I are a boring married couple with ordinary jobs,” she replied. “People can pop into the joke shop and say hello to Ron whenever they want, so he’s more of a friend than a celebrity, to most people.”
Harry shrugged. “We talk about non-sexual things too.”
He was wearing shabby jeans and trainers: the standard Potter uniform. But underneath the ghastly red jumper was an unexpectedly fitted white t-shirt, hugging an unexpectedly fit body. Draco didn’t remember him being quite so… masculine. Or so fucking
“Hmm?” Draco whispered back, completely losing his train of thought as he ogled Harry’s handsome face.
“Are you implying that I’m so vain that I wouldn’t be speaking with you if you were ugly?”
“And what on earth are we supposed to do about that?” Draco asked facetiously.
In his gut, he knew he was stalling because he was convinced that his presence wouldn’t be welcome, and it made him anxious. But he was determined to do this, and finally, just before two, he cast a glamor charm on himself and apparated to Diagon Alley.
Draco huffed in shock. There was no way in hell he wasn’t going to be replaying that line in his head all night long.
“Okay, I’m calm now,” he grumbled. “Continue.”
“Then why are you still here?”
“You’re projecting your own misguided self-loathing onto me and you’re assuming that’s the reason I didn’t tell them.”
“I’m glad you think so, Potter,” he said, leading them to walk further. “But it’s not all bad. I love my work. And I’m good at it. It gives me a purpose. And muggle children--muggles in general really--they don’t seem to mind the tattoo so much. One of my students named the skull Herman.”
“And Tonks?” Harry asked, sipping his tea. “You weren’t close?”
In the end, he puttered around his garden for a long while, watering all the flowers and checking the progress of his sweet peas in particular; yes, they were finally starting to climb up the trellis. Vaguely Draco wondered if he should plant lilies next year; he thought Harry would like that.
“Right,” Harry grinned. “That.”
“You’re the attractive one,” he countered, and then grinned. “I like your coddled face.”
“I suppose I can’t blame you for wanting to keep the relationship hidden, though,” Draco continued, shrugging dramatically. “Why would you ever want people to know that you’re dating a death eater?”
Wordlessly, Draco followed Harry to his own kitchen and stood in the doorway while Harry walked towards the sink. He watched as Harry placed all the dirty dishes in it, and hovered the leftover biscuits neatly into the tin that Draco had left open on the counter.
“I only want a couple bites.”
“That’s a very odd question,” Draco told him.
Harry smiled gently at him, but it was less teasing and more… something. “I really am sorry for laughing.”
“Well I’m glad you find it funny, Malfoy,” Harry murmured, glaring at him.
“I really like your house,” Harry said with a friendly smile.
“Because I know you hate the things I’ve done, you hate that you’re in love with someone who hurt people,” Draco argued.
Draco finished chewing the bite slowly and swallowed before answering. “Why are you looking at me like that, Potter?”
“Merlin fuck, Potter,” Draco muttered, dodging out of the way just in time to avoid disaster.
“It’s a problem?” Harry asked, looking faintly hurt and more than a little confused.
“Nothing too personal, I’m sure,” Draco said sarcastically, lifting his eyebrow.
Draco bent his head down and groaned into Harry’s shoulder before slowly pulling away, and Harry watched him take two deliberate steps back.
“What time are they expecting me?” he asked.
“I’m not fucking ashamed of you!” Harry screamed, standing up in a flash.
“Again?”
"So?” Harry whispered nervously, unable to sit in his fear this time. “Anti-climactic or life-changing?”
“Not necessarily,” Draco muttered. “There were a few moments where I thought I might enjoy kissing you as well.”
“Commence,” Harry sighed, content.
They were silent for a long moment.
“Who cares what other people think?” Harry exclaimed.
“Nothing of consequence,” Draco said enigmatically.
“I’ll leave if you want me to leave, Draco, but I don’t think you do...”
Draco laughed out loud and leaned down to kiss Harry as thoroughly as he knew how. Harry leaned up on his knees and, as always, kissed him back until Draco had no breath left in him. Finally he pulled Harry up onto the couch beside him.
“‘Mr Potter is a prat,’” Draco said, beaming as if he was incredibly proud of his dazzling wisdom. “‘And a witless one at that.’”
“Yes, I have it, thank you,” Draco said with the tiniest of smiles at the mug. “Perhaps you missed your calling; you would’ve made a good mediwizard.”
Harry reached up and ran his fingers through Draco’s soft blonde hair, and they didn’t speak for a moment.
He realized too late that this was a bit of an insensitive thing to say, and he bit the inside of his cheek to avoid spouting off again. Draco sighed and looked up at him.
But Draco couldn’t help the warm thought that trickled over him now: that maybe, after all that they’d been through, Potter knew him better than most. And for once in his life, he felt hopeful that maybe someday he wouldn’t have to feel ashamed of that.
Finally admitting defeat, he set the book aside with a huff, shot back the last of his now cold tea, and wrapped the blanket around his shoulders. He brought the empty cup into the kitchen and shuffled up to the window, curious to see if it was raining yet.
Harry sighed and bent his head down so he was staring at the floor. Draco knew he was trying not to cry.
“No,” Harry interrupted, reaching out to him before evidently thinking better of it and pulling his hand back. “I’m the one who should be apologizing. You’re right. You’re absolutely right, I should’ve told you it was me straight away. I’m sorry. That was fucking terrible of me, and I’m so sorry.”
However, he supposed it was inevitable now; he owed Harry an explanation, if nothing else. He sighed.
Dearest Harry,
“That is disgusting, Potter," he replied, sneering.
Harry grinned at him. “Quick splash of soap and water is all you really need.”
Before he could blink, Potter was flinging a blanket-like cloak around both of their shoulders, and Draco heard a gasp of surprise coming from his own lips. He knew that this had to be Potter’s famed Invisibility Cloak, but he resisted the impulse to ask. He looked down at his hand instead and felt his stomach lurch--he was indeed invisible.
Draco raised his eyebrows. “Really?” He almost admitted that he hadn’t either, but Harry shook his head and continued talking before he could muster up the courage.
“Well, someone has to,” Harry said with a grin, firing another bean at Draco. “Are you going to tell me about the rest of your exes now?”
Draco couldn’t help himself; he laughed his way through the kiss, and Potter joined in after a moment.
After a few pages, however, Draco’s mind had already started to drift. He wondered whether Harry would really go through with telling Weasley and Granger about him this time. Draco was nervous to hear what they had said, but he consoled himself that at least Harry could tell him all about it while they were cuddled up together by the fire.
“That’s a nice thing to think about,” Harry said gently.
“Well, then... jerking off together was fun. Harry,” Draco said.
“Thank you, Potter.”
Harry grinned at him. “Interesting technique.”
“They’ll only want me to be happy,” Harry said firmly.
“I told you my theory already,” Draco said. “You’re ashamed of--”
💎⚡💎⚡💎⚡
It didn’t matter, though, because Harry instantly wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle from behind, clutching Draco snugly against his chest. He buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck as Draco stirred his tea with slightly shaking fingers. He wasn’t sure how it was possible, but his smile grew wider.
“Come on, then,” Harry said, giving him one last nudge before heading back towards the sitting room.
“You don’t have to carry it when you’re with me,” Draco said softly.
“Indeed.” She lifted a brow but continued as if everything was normal and her employee wasn’t having a minor breakdown in her office. “Which is why, as he said, he would only give the interview if it was with Draco Malfoy, ie David McKinnon, who, and I quote, should be doing better articles anyway, because he’s a damn good writer.”
He stared, enraptured, as Harry periodically wanked for a few seconds, then paused, panting heavily, only to repeat the process. Watching him tease himself was an intoxicating torment, and Draco knew they were both about to finish.
“They’re crazy in love, of course,” Harry said fondly. “She and Ron. Only took them seven years, but they have the rest of their lives to make up for lost time, I suppose.”
“But not really unexpected."
“Exceptional,” Harry beamed. “Well done.”
Draco shrugged back in response, and he tapped his quill against his lips, thoughtful. “I suppose not. Who did you think you were in love with?”
Yours always,
She sighed. “Then I suppose I have nothing else to say but to offer you my congratulations. This will put you on the map, you know. Might even buy you out of your auxiliary days, if it’s good enough.”
“You’re not going to answer, are you?” Harry asked him, sighing.
“Hmm,” Harry said. “Okay. Physical. I guess my eyes are kind of an interesting color.”
“I meant for another interview session, you prat,” Harry said, grabbing the teacup back from Draco and having another sip.
to get out of there. He just wanted to go home, and he wanted Draco to be there with him. “And thanks for having us.”
“Oh, are you hurt, love?” Draco asked with concern.
Potter chuckled suddenly from beside him as they walked further down the quiet street. “You know, now that I know you’re gay, I really don’t know how I missed it.”
“Defeated,” Draco chuckled.
“Point taken,” he conceded, crossing his legs. “I suppose I’ve fancied him since I was around fourteen, though my feelings were largely nothing more than infatuation. Obviously I never acted on them, until he reached out to me a few weeks ago.”
Rosalind sighed. “I’ll get right to it. You’ll remember from the monthly meeting a few days back that the Prophet has been attempting to set up an extensive personal profile with Mr Harry Potter for the ten-year special edition next month?”
Harry tilted his head at him incredulously and Draco smiled.
“Sure, I can make it for him, Hermione,” Harry readily agreed, standing up.
“Yes,” Harry said firmly. “I like it a lot actually.” He kissed the top of Draco’s head once more.
He took a long swig of his coffee when he reached the top of the staircase and surveyed the bright, open workspace. Since the full-time journalists at the Prophet had no fixed schedule, he never knew whether to expect an empty newsroom or a full one, but a cursory glance around the office showed that he had beaten the vast majority of the reporters to work. Well, it was only 5:54 am, after all; he supposed his odds had been good.
“Your brain is sexy.”
“Least I can do, knowing you’re not suing our arses,” she said with a snort. “I’m sure they’re going to ask you if you have any ideas about his motives, or his whereabouts, so give that a bit of thought before you head over.”
“Potter…” Draco said warningly.
“How about this, then,” Potter said softly. “We have a shitty history. We both did some really horrible things to each other. Why don’t we just acknowledge that that all happened, and… move forward. Not erase the past, but sort of… stop looking at it. Stop letting it dictate our present. Deal?”
Draco glared at him. “What on earth does that mean?” But of course Draco knew. And of course Harry was right.
“I know I’ve botched two proposals already,” Harry muttered, and suddenly Draco couldn’t breathe. “But, since I’m already kneeling, and since doing anything three times makes it official…”
“Obviously,” Draco replied, his heart full. “You do realize you proposed marriage not fifteen minutes ago?”
Draco’s eyes followed them suspiciously; Merlin’s sake, Gryffindors were not exactly subtle, were they?
Draco peered at him. “Let me guess: Granger was the understanding one.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said softly, and against all odds, Harry instantly believed him. “Particularly since my hatred was obviously unfounded. I’m certain you did nothing to deserve it, anyway.”
Draco leaned back in the armchair and took another swig of beer.
“Such a smart man my boyfriend is.” Draco could hear the smile in his voice.
After accepting that the cloud of melancholy would be hanging over his head for the time being, Draco dragged himself out of bed and into the shower. Familiar memories of every terrible thing he had done, as well as the resulting feelings of despair and self-hatred, followed him there like a shadow.
been a long time coming. I know you probably
“Love you, too, snookums,” Ron called from across the kitchen.
“Harry…?” he whispered, unsure what else to say after that.
“Really? Narcissa is a flower?” Harry said, sufficiently distracted. “Hmm. So is mine.”
“Was your uncle any better, then?”
“I’ve dated around quite a bit since then, but nothing serious,” Harry said. “Well, the longest relationship after Natalie was Patrick Hunter. I suppose that was fairly serious, for a little while.”
“Say please, Potter,” Draco chided him gruffly, and Harry’s cock twitched with excitement as he fought off an onslaught of particularly naughty images.
“Did you?”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, though he wasn’t sure he wanted to know the answer. His mouth had suddenly gone dry.
Draco shivered. “Me whispering synonyms into your ear all through the night?”
“Look,” Harry said with another sigh, “I’m never at my best when I’m out in public. I get kind of uncomfortable. Usually I use a glamor charm, but I wanted-- I mean, I’m not making excuses, I’m just… Maybe we could do this somewhere more private?”
Ron snorted, and Draco could feel his face heating.
“Are you just saying this to annoy me?” Harry asked dubiously.
Harry kissed his hand three times in response, and they walked hand in hand out the bedroom and down the hall.
Ron nodded. “And you didn’t… coerce him or something? No potions, no spells, no evil luring? You swear?”
“You’re particularly affectionate this evening, dearest,” Draco said merrily.
“I know what I feel, too,” Draco said softly. “But I am also a realist, unlike you, Harry. I know that feelings aren’t permanent. You see the very best in people and situations, and I love that about you. You see how much you care for me, but you don’t see that someday maybe those feelings will change.”
“Not with the bloody story, Malfoy.” Ron glared right back at him. “My best mate has never looked at anyone like he’s been looking at you all night. And the same goes for you. I may not know you all that well anymore, but I know an eye-fucking when I see one.”
Draco snorted loudly. “Fine. Continue.”
Draco smiled, staring at the hair on Harry’s chest. “So I see.”
“What signs?” he asked, feeling oddly nervous to hear the answer.
“Well… then perhaps I can repay some of my personal debts and take you out to dinner sometime?”
“Beat off for me, Harry,” he muttered, even as he began to do so himself. “Fuck your hand like a good boy. Bring yourself to the edge.”
is Webster?” he amended.
“Look, Draco,” Harry said, meeting his eyes. “We don’t have to have sex tonight. Or ever, if it’s not what you want. I’m certainly not expecting anything. Believe it or not, I didn’t write you that letter as some plot to get you into bed with me, and… well, honestly, it kind of sucks that you think I’m just looking to shag you.”
Harry leaned forward on the deep red armchair, folded his legs up underneath him, and sighed. After several intense hours of dissecting the war, and seemingly every single detail of Potter and crew’s infamous year on the run, Draco was pleased but not exactly surprised that Harry had come out of the conversation in relatively high spirits. Harry’s unfailing optimism was still one of Draco’s favorite things about him, though that list could fill volumes now.
“Is that really how you feel?” Harry asked quietly. “Like you’re living in a shadow?”
His cock was leaking, and he was so turned on, and this was unbearable… But Draco’s heart melted just a little at the fact that Harry could still joke with him, even when they were doing
Draco took a sip of tea in preparation and poised his quill, bracing himself for the worst. “Whenever you’re ready.”
When Harry flopped down on top of his chest, he whispered, “I’m going to be in love with you forever.”
“You can take your glamor off now,” Ron told him. “If you want.”
“Downright hilarious, actually,” came the reply, peppered with uncontrolled giggles.
feature--Alex had been increasingly aggressive with his remarks. I suppose he might’ve been jealous, perhaps, that I was given the assignment over him.”
Draco cocked his eyebrow in surprise. “Excuse me?”
messy,” Draco muttered, more to himself than to Harry. He conjured a glass and filled it with water, placing it on the nightstand before he took a step backwards.
Harry looked at him, surprise and delight on his face. “Pink grapefruit... Sorry, am I making you jealous?”
Harry shook his head and reached for his tea as he shoved the remaining half of his biscuit into his mouth. “I’m trying to picture you shopping at Sainsbury’s.”
“Oh, Webster’s back.”
“There’s that word again,” Harry said, a mischievous smirk on his face. He took the plate Draco handed to him and began filling it with food. “I don’t need eggs.”
Those words never led to anything good, in Harry’s experience, but he could hardly find it in himself to be worried when Draco was standing this close.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly.
She looked at him curiously when he continued to give her a blank stare.
Draco laughed again. “Sod off with your insults, Potter.”
hard. And it was too much.
Draco nodded to himself as he wrote, ‘
Draco rolled his eyes. He found that he rather liked being called sweetheart, even if it was used in a teasing manner.
“I did things… things I can never take back…”
And, once again, Harry was trying to convince Draco to join him at Weasley and Granger’s house later that night, when he would finally, hopefully, break the news of their relationship.
“I mean,” Draco amended, “why on earth would you want to marry me?”
Finally he arrived at his desk, where he saw that Rosalind had already left him one of her pale orange notes.
Draco smiled at her. The word ‘teammate’ floated through his mind. “Thank you, Ms Peters.”
Hermione quickly followed his example, and they shook hands. “Good evening.”
Harry swallowed, his gaze drifting down to Draco’s mouth. His eyes were hooded and looked nearly black now.
“I missed this,” Harry said, as they hovered high in the air beside each other.
He forced himself to face the more likely possibility that he was merely jealous: marriage and children were everything Harry wanted, and while he was truly overjoyed that Ron and Hermione were getting those things, it was depressing to stand by and watch while his life stayed frozen where it was.
“I see,” Harry said, startled by his words. He dropped his arms back down to his sides. “So… are we done then?”
“Yes,” Draco said, hardly believing it himself all these years later. “Let’s call it a failed experiment that served no purpose but to act as further proof of my homosexuality.”
“I like you with a bit of stubble,” Draco explained, trying his very best to resist blushing.
“Cheers,” they both said.
“Harry,” Draco said, a bit rough. “Don’t apologize. Not for this.”
Draco huffed out a laugh, unaware that he had been holding his breath. “Oh I should, should I?”
Draco chuckled and tapped his fingers against Harry’s stomach.
“What is that supposed to mean?” he growled. They were both leaning so far forward across the small round table that Draco could see every little groove in Harry’s lightning bolt scar. And he hated that scar. Oh, how he hated it.
But Harry was already dreaming.
“But the ten-year, that’s still a month away,” Ron pointed out.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “More than that. Say everything.”
But it was more than that, just as it always had been. He didn’t just want to fuck Harry. He wanted to sit next to him, bake for him, kiss him, talk with him, fight with him, be with him, learn about him, grow old with him. Forever.
“I guess not everything has changed,” Harry said with a sigh. “We’re still really good at pissing each other off.”
“You told me he’d been friendly, mate,” Ron said to Harry, “but this is just bloody weird.”
I see, too, that your penmanship has not improved since our school days, but I can’t say that I’m surprised.
“What?” Draco asked, caught off guard. The thought hadn’t even occurred to him. “No, of course not!”
Draco nodded. “We were together for a little over a year.”
“Stop fussing, Potter,” Draco murmured, content. “My arse, like the rest of me, is perfectly fine.”
“Oh, Draco,” she finally sighed. “Harry Potter?”
“I just want you,” Draco muttered, covering his full mouth again. “Badly.”
“Are you sorry?”
Draco smiled down at his notes and scored one point for himself. He couldn’t give an objective assessment of his own looks, of course, but he did at least know that he was smart. It made his heart happy to know that Harry liked smart men.
“That doesn’t matter!” Draco shouted, finally breaking his composure in his desire to win the argument. “The very fact that they’re spirits guarantees their victory in a battle against anyone! They’re immortal! They can’t die, therefore they can’t be defeated by any living creature! I don’t know why you can’t understand this!”
“Yeah, likewise,” Harry mumbled, rolling his eyes teasingly. “You’re just as domineering as you always were.”
“Ever the gentleman.” Draco smiled at him. “Your apology couldn’t wait another couple of hours?”
Ron appeared then, tucking his wand into his back pocket as he entered the sitting room.
Draco pondered it for a moment, tapping his fingers on his ridiculous Gryffindor teacup, the one Potter had given him in an attempt to get a rise out of him. Sometimes Harry was still Potter, and Draco felt strangely glad to know that.
“I don’t mind it,” he replied, subtly pulling his chair a few inches to the left before taking his seat next to Harry. Distance. “It’s more of a necessary evil than a pleasurable hobby.”
“Sometimes you seem so sad,” Draco told him.
Harry was missing a piece of the puzzle, but he could feel it begin to creep up his spine like an icy wind.
Draco didn’t think he would ever stop feeling the flutter of snitches in his stomach when he heard those words on Harry’s captivating lips. Growing up in a household where ‘I love you’s were used sparingly gave the words all the more power when they were spoken. To Draco, ‘I love you’ was like a potent healing spell, like the most restorative of potions.
As hard as he tried, he couldn’t stop himself from stealing glances at Draco as they walked back into the house in awkward silence. The prat was avoiding his eye, but bloody hell, even the back of his blonde head was appealing. Not to mention his arse.
Harry smiled as he shrugged. “Probably closer to four now.”
“Never mind that, Potter,” he said, lifting his chin haughtily. “How long have you been out here? You’re soaked through.”
“Well, like I said, I wasn’t assigned to it; and sod off, wanker,” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
“I can’t believe you baked macarons for me,” Harry murmured, staring at Draco’s mouth.
“I believe you did, Harry,” Draco whispered.
“Maybe,” Harry agreed, hurt that his advances were once again being brushed off. “But it went how it went. Can’t go back and rewrite history.”
“Yes, well,” he ventured, “I replied with my assent. We met, and he returned my wand, and we… spent some time together. And talked.”
Draco nodded. “Indubitably.”
Harry blanched. “Are you serious?”
The revelation finally hit Draco squarely between the eyeballs like a well-aimed bludger. Potter was The Stranger from the other night?
“Do you think they’re talking about us in there?” Draco asked him at last, gesturing with his chin towards the hallway.
Draco leaned back against the counter and Harry did the same.
Harry laughed. “You
“Come in and close the door, Malfoy,” she said brusquely, rubbing her temples as she leaned over her desk. “And sit down.”
“Draco…” Harry stood up as well. “No one’s giving up. Listen to me.”
Draco knew the sound he made then was indecently loud, animalistic, raw. He could barely stand the onslaught of sensation as Harry slowly moved his head up and down Draco’s erection, and he laced his fingers through Harry’s thick hair. He was entirely unconscious of anything coming out of his mouth as he threw his head back in complete ecstasy, Harry’s tongue running over the length of his prick with tantalizing slowness.
Harry laughed again. “So it seems.” He smiled at Draco. Draco smiled back. As if he had stopped.
“Are you sure the Auror department has no ulterior motives for questioning me?” Draco asked, a little suspicious. “After all, there were no actual witnesses to the assault itself, no one to vouch for the fact that it wasn’t provoked, or even deserved. For all they know, I could’ve fired a curse they didn’t see, before they heard me yelling. Or before we were even in the office...”
“They did?” Draco asked, looking up from his portfolio with wide eyes. Harry loved the joy on his face.
“I like your hair like that, too,” Harry said.
Alex spun around, his wand raised, and Draco called out “No!”
“Thank you,” he said with a smile. “After you, then.”
“I want that as well,” Draco nodded, and then winced. “Ergh--”
“Now that was your second feeble attempt, and you still haven’t even gotten on one knee,” Draco complained. “Really, Potter, only you could botch a proposal of marriage twice in twenty-four hours.”
Draco chuckled at that. “Not like that. Believe me, Weasley, you’re the last man in the world I would ever look twice at.”
Harry thought that Draco himself smelled delicious, as a matter of fact. What
Merlin... he was so close that Harry's head was spinning. Harry breathed out something that sounded like a laugh and leaned in even closer.
“Tell me about him,” Draco forced himself to say.
“I’m perfectly fine,” he sighed. “Just in a little bit of pain. And stiff all over.”
“You kicked them off of you and they flew in there,” Draco replied, smirking again. “Do I really have to remind you that they got stuck on your ankle, which then led to you cursing at them to, and I quote, ‘go fucking die in a hole’? It was truly a marvellous and graceful display of your staggering athleticism.”
Harry scoffed. “Of course.”
Harry. Had that really danced so effortlessly into his thoughts? After all, whatever else they were to each other, Harry had started out as his boyhood enemy, and later, just the subject of a piece he was writing for work. And yet, somewhere along the way, Draco really had begun to think of him that way. His.
“Fine?” Harry asked. “Also, brunch?”
“I rouse your snake, do I?” Harry said with an impish grin, and Draco couldn’t help but smile back at him.
“Mistress Malfoy is in the drawing room, Master Draco.”
“How did you know it was me?” Potter said, breaking their silence.
The prospect of seeing Potter again was second only to the thrill he felt at potentially having his old wand back in his hand. He remembered the day he lost it like it was yesterday. He could so easily picture Potter with his distorted face kneeling before him, begging Draco with his eyes not to give him away. He could read every emotion in those pleading eyes with ease. He knew Potter so well that he swore he could almost hear his thoughts.
She rubbed her temples yet again, and Draco felt more than a little sorry for her.
Draco felt the bile rising in his throat and scrambled to find equilibrium, let alone something to say that would undo even a breath of the pain Harry must have gone through. But Draco, as usual, could not muster up a single right thing to say.
He hadn’t kept up with much wizarding gossip over the years, and he was positive that he’d heard next to nothing about Malfoy’s sexuality, but he wouldn’t be terribly surprised if Malfoy wasn’t straight.
“Who the
“Now you have to tell me your type,” Harry finally said.
“So weird,” Harry agreed.
“Two entirely different things,” Draco said softly. “But I really like both.”
things about sex… And that he’d missed him… And they’d flirted so much at Ron and Hermione’s…
“Thank god,” Harry said, tossing himself onto his side so he was lying down and facing Draco, an affable grin lighting up his face and ah, Draco was lost.
“Maybe we can share Webster,” Harry suggested, ignoring his excited heart.
After another long pause, Harry said, “I’m glad you feel like you can talk to me about it.”
“Maybe. Anyhow, it makes me think that I gave you too little credit when you told your parents yesterday,” Harry continued, fixing Draco with his piercing green eyes. “The way your father reacted… Well, that was probably even harder to deal with than Ron. And if I didn’t tell you this yet, then I’m really, really sorry you had to go through that.”
“That’s what all boys say,” Draco teased.
Harry mulled that over. Draco was nothing if not thought-provoking.
“Whatever for?”
Ron waved his wand, and two floral teacups hovered over to the desk as a matching tea pot poured a dark, steaming blend of tea into each cup.
“You’re disarmingly kind, to literally everyone, even if they feel like they don’t deserve it, especially then. You’re all the things everyone knows about already: brave, strong, courageous. You’re so noble, Harry. You’re so unfailingly
“Your tea, your highness,” Harry quipped as he entered the room. Draco smiled up at him as he closed the magazine.
My angel,
“What happened?” he asked, very interested and not bothering to pretend not to be. “I mean, what was the final straw in her decision to leave?”
Potter laughed again, throwing his head back. Draco was mesmerized by his throat, watching his Adam’s apple bobbing as he laughed. He tried very hard not to think to himself that Potter’s laugh was attractive.
“Ah, I see how it is,” Harry said playfully, brushing his fingers lazily against Draco’s arm while Draco mindlessly fingered the hair on Harry’s chest. “You only said you were a virgin to appease my jealous arse, is that it?”
“Yeah.” Harry nodded. “Shocked?”
“But… surely he’ll change his mind once he realizes who I really am,” Draco protested. “He hates me.”
“You agreed,” Harry reminded him.
“Baff!” she bellowed, clapping.
“Well, this is wonderful news, Harry, thank you.”
“Fuck me?” Draco asked, surprised. “Really?”
“Yes, as a matter of fact, there is,” Draco began. “I was wondering if the proprietor was available.”
Draco could feel Harry approach him, so held his hand out to stop Harry from coming any closer.
Draco couldn’t help it; he laughed, embarrassed, against Harry’s lips and Harry chuckled in response.
“‘Intriguing’ is certainly a compliment,” Draco said, sipping his coffee. The way he was staring at him was almost indecent. It felt like a challenge. Harry’s skin was burning.
“Obviously.” Draco smirked and took another sip of coffee.
“Well we all know he’s damn good at ignoring his feelings,” Ron replied, and Harry paused outside the doorway. Even in his fuzzy state, he knew they must be talking about him.
Draco stared into those bewitching eyes. “What then?”
Draco nodded, mollified, waiting for her to continue. There was a long pause.
“And the tree,” Draco proclaimed proudly.
“I already know that, Draco,” Harry said, smiling easily. “What else?”
“Yes, it is, in fact, on my list,” he confirmed. “And we might as well get that straight right away, if you’ll forgive the pun.”
“Oh, you’re sexy when you threaten me.”
He took a deep breath and slowly pulled the door open. Harry stood there, looking up at him with bemused concern.
“No particularly bad incidents, no,” Draco replied. “Though, ever since I was assigned to the Potter feature--pardon me, Harry, to
Harry blessed him with another half smile. “You’re my hero.”
He remembered, alright, mainly because the announcement had activated an embarrassing flutter of nerves in the pit of his gut. His intense loathing of Potter had faded to nothing years ago, but he couldn’t help but worry about how awkward it might be to run into him now that they were older. However, when Potter had failed to respond to three of the Prophet’s petitions for an interview, Draco assumed the story would have to be scrapped, and he hadn’t given it much thought since.
“Because it’s about you,” he mumbled. “And because the last thing I wrote was a very detailed, half-page description of wand core materials.”
Harry gave him a half-smile. The advantage that smile gave him was really quite unfair.
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “No, Draco Malfoy. Nothing about you is wrong.”
“Would you like to go home now?” Draco asked him, a little less gruff this time. He was so nice when he wanted to be, Harry thought to himself.
Harry snorted. “Lies.”
“Oh my,” Draco muttered, hungrily taking it from Potter and setting his own bottle beside Potter’s on the coffee table. He stared at his beautiful hawthorn wand for a full twenty seconds before excitedly levitating objects at random with an easy swish and flick. This old familiar wand was vastly better than his new wand--and leaps and bounds ahead of his ministry wand--and he felt giddy with the power he felt coursing through his arm.
“I leave everything to my boyfriend,” Harry said. “Especially my Gryffindor jumper that he secretly adores, which he’ll never admit to.”
“Informative,” Draco corrected. “Yes, it should be.”
Draco snorted. “After all of the effort we’ve just expended to get you into bed? I think not.”
“Surprised?” Draco asked, amused by Harry’s slightly gaping mouth.
“He’s right, Ron’s cooking is brilliant,” Hermione agreed.
Draco glared at him, irked by his flippant response. Harry had a strong tendency to see the world in black and white and ignore all of the vastly important greys.
“Oh… Er…” Harry stammered, nervously flipping his journal shut with a smack. “Yeah, actually.”
“Indeed,” he replied, setting his cup down on the desk.
“Even when you’re in a room with three people you used to bully?” Harry asked him as he jotted down Ron and Hermione’s address with shaking fingers.
Andrea was eying him suspiciously, both Gareth and Ramesh were glaring at him, and Draco wasn’t looking at him at all.
“That first time, at Madam Malkin’s,” Draco pushed. “You seemed inclined to hate me from the very first moment.”
“Yes, you are, aren’t you?” he asked Rose, rubbing her back. “What a little darling.”
“Maybe I’m just not used to them flirting back,” Harry replied, more honest than he probably should’ve been.
Draco forced himself to breathe deeply, focusing on Harry’s green eyes to distract himself.
me, Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed. “What do you mean you were bloody married?”
“As I said, my apologies,” he replied. “I won’t go off on a tangent again.”
When Ron cast suspicious eyes at him, Harry realized his voice had not been casual enough. He watched in horror as Ron’s mouth slowly formed a comical ‘o.’
Harry chuckled and kissed Draco’s neck. Draco reached around to pull Harry’s wand from his back pocket and waved it at the kitchen, summoning the forgotten beers from the counter.
“Are you going to let me kick his arse at least?” Harry smiled, only half joking.
“That’s about what he said, but I was hoping you would give me a more detailed answer,” Harry said with a grin. “I’m dying here.”
“More than before.”
Draco sighed, feeling both flattered by Harry’s remarks and a little remorseful for the negative way he knew he’d sounded. Perhaps being totally unfiltered around Harry wasn’t always the kindest course of action.
“That’s just weird.”
Harry shifted in his seat; his glamor charm supposedly altered his voice as well as his looks, but evidently not quite enough, if Malfoy could recognize him so easily.
“So if you don’t bake, do you cook?” Harry asked as he shoved another large bite in his mouth.
“Being dominated and made to feel like a whore, hmm?” Harry retorted with a chuckle.
“It’s been… what, fourteen hours? Fifteen maybe?”
“Speak for yourself, Granger,” Ron interjected.
Harry laughed. “Alright, one hour.”
“And my face is, like… right in your face,” Harry continued, almost nervously, moving his head backward a few inches and propping his body up on his elbow.
“Reckon you can handle another beer?” Harry called, his head in the fridge, perfect denim-clad arse in the air, not aware that Draco was walking up behind him.
Draco’s eyes were glued to him, and Harry shifted guiltily on his feet.
Harry looked up at Draco, astonishment in his face. Draco felt as if his hand had just caught fire.
Much as he loved lying close to Harry and absorbing his warmth, after a few more lazy minutes, Draco’s bladder couldn’t take it any longer. He stealthily sat up in bed and manoeuvred his legs over the edge, hoping he hadn’t woken Harry with his movement.
Finally their legs were glued together from knee to hip, and Harry could barely breathe; the pressure of it was both torture and bliss.
If Harry hadn’t shut him up with a kiss, Draco would’ve said yes a hundred times. But, now that he thought about it, saying it three times had been just right.
“Tell me,” Harry said.
“I like it,” Draco continued, allowing himself to speak foolishly for the sake of seeing Harry happy again. “I like when you smile.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to scoff, finally looking up at Harry. “Come off it, you aren’t really going to kick me out like this?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Bye.”
“Anyways,” Hermione murmured hastily, placing her hand on Ron’s stomach. “I need to get this one into bed.”
He had never in a million years expected Potter to return his old wand to him, however. He had assumed that the wand had been destroyed, or perhaps kept safe in some kind of war archive. Now faced with the possibility of possessing it again, he found that he did miss it.
“To be honest, I didn’t even consider that you might want it that way,” Draco said truthfully.
“So you
“Alright,” Draco muttered. “Get it all out now.”
“I already showered, thanks,” Harry quipped.
“Not even with Weasley and Granger?” Draco asked, surprised.
“Please sit down, Potter,” he muttered. “I told you I don’t want you to leave.”
“What?” Harry’s eyes were wide.
“Sorry,” Harry muttered instantly, his lips red and glistening with saliva. “I should’ve asked first...”
“Do I?” Harry asked quietly. Draco could hear the smile in his voice even though he couldn’t see it.
“I like her, too,” he replied. She held up Oscar and Draco kissed him.
Draco nodded. “Of course.”
“Malfoy, in my house,” Ron repeated, shaking his head. “Bloody hell that’s weird.”
“What’s the matter?” Draco asked, sitting up straight and immediately feeling on edge. He turned and faced Harry, sitting cross-legged.
He felt Harry shimmy in closer. “What else?”
“Three times…”
Harry merely shrugged. “Then that’s enough for me, and it will be enough for them, too.”
“Exactly.”
“I mean I was always sort of the odd man out, so to speak,” Harry mumbled. “But now that they’re a real couple, that feeling is magnified. A lot, at times.”
Draco was mortified when his voice broke on the last word and he placed his hand over his eyes in a fruitless attempt to stop the tears from coming again.
Draco sighed. “My father, by contrast, never had the upper hand. He only thought he did. I suppose, in a sense, he taught me how easy it is to lose control. He made me realize that I never want to lose it again.”
Draco didn’t want to. He wanted to leave the entire incident deep down inside of him, amongst every other rotten experience he'd gone through, and let it fester there. He didn’t want to give Harry any more of his bad parts.
The day had progressively cooled off, and it looked as if it might rain soon, so Draco lit a cozy fire in his sitting room and put on some comforting classical music. He curled himself up on the armchair under a grey throw blanket with a book and a cup of tea while he waited for Harry.
“I’ll give you a framework, then,” Draco said, coming to his aid. “One physical trait, one personality trait, and one skill.”
More than just physically, though, Harry became someone different up here, someone self-assured and commanding. Granted, Draco loved that Harry wasn’t always assertive and confident, that he was modest and a little bit unsure; it was part of what made him so utterly charming and easy to be around. But he also liked seeing Harry like this, like he owned the world. It brought him back to simpler times, when things were black and white. And, frankly, it was a bit of a turn-on.
“Tell me what you would do, Harry,” Draco breathed, looking down at Harry’s cock, rock hard, slippery with lube, flushed red and dripping with precum. “What would you do to me if I was posing like that for you, my arse in the air, begging for your cock?”
“Helpful for what?”
“But I don’t want to leave you,” he countered.
“Are you going to sleep with me?” Harry asked, snickering.
Harry laughed with him. “You were gorgeous.”
He laughed. “Guess again.”
“Well think of something!” Harry barked.
“I’m euphoric,” he replied, laughing.
“Good morning, ma’am.”
“What?”
woken up next to someone?”
But first, priority number two: another precautionary wank.
“Good to know,” Draco murmured. “Let me collect my things. Alex has been known to make surprise reappearances.”
“Finish your breakfast,” Harry said, predictably demanding.
Harry shook his head and gestured for Draco to follow him to the interview room where Draco’s actual questioners were already set up. “I did volunteer for your case, but Robards said no. He knows you’re the one writing about me for the anniversary thing, so he wouldn’t let me. Conflict of interest, or something; I’m sure you, of all people, can understand that.”
Harry hated the way he said it, like it was normal, not heartbreaking in the least.
“MTV Unplugged? Yeah, of course,” Harry said enthusiastically. “It’s incredible. The emotion in his face, like he’s in pain… and his voice, it’s so raw and…”
He lifted Harry’s hands to his face and kissed them both, and Harry tried not to let it distract him.
He took another voluntary step back; he felt like he’d been kicked in the gut.
Draco was genuinely proud of himself for abstaining from rolling his eyes at that. A rumble of defensiveness filtered through his body to join the nerves already vibrating there, and he placed both hands flat on the table to keep from clenching his fists.
“No it doesn’t,” Draco replied. “It makes you a truly normal person.”
There was a long pause.
“And it went well with Granger,” Draco informed him a moment later, once he had taken a very necessary deep breath. “But the stories Weasley told me were likely the most engaging part of the interview.”
“Yes, you really should,” Harry replied, grinning. “Your hair is very nice. Plus I’ve been told I should consider a hat permanently.”
“Hmmm,” Harry muttered, “I don’t think I’m ever ready.”
Draco sighed. “Fine. Say everything?”
“It’s fine, I deserve it, I know,” Draco sighed. “I just…”
Harry chuckled. “Okay.”
They laughed with him. Like old friends.
They made their way, hand in hand, to the floo in Harry’s sitting room.
“Right,” he replied. Of course right. Everything was right.
“I am aware of that, Potter.”
“Of course you need to see me off there, it’s tradition,” Harry said, as if it was obvious.
A moment later, Harry said, “What?”
Draco could feel his cheeks heating and distracted himself by slowly depositing the amber-colored bean in his mouth. Every time Harry said things like that, he had to actively remind himself that this was just a job.
“Yes, well, you should try it some time,” he said, pointedly staring at Harry’s dirty Converse.
“Woah,” Harry whispered, his green eyes flitting down to stare at Draco’s lips.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s usual joke and blew wet kisses all over Rose’s face and belly. She giggled in her sweet way, and when Harry pulled away from her, he knew was smiling as happily as she was.
Draco made his way over to the fireplace, and Harry stood as well.
Fortunately, the same tawny owl returned just as he was about to leave the house, and Draco eagerly dove at the attached scrawl, unrolling it with shaking fingers.
Oh god, why was he always saying things like that? Draco had to be very careful, and he knew it. Harry made him want to cross every line and break every rule.
“Why not?”
“You don’t need to say anything,” Harry said. “You won’t need to do anything at all, really. Just lie back and let me lick you and suck you until you come in my mouth.”
It wasn’t the first time they seemed to be having similar thoughts this evening, and Draco thought it was a little bit thrilling.
“And is there any reason for that?” Gareth asked.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, once again brushing Harry’s hair back from his face. “If you really want me there, I’ll be there.”
“See?” Harry teased. “You’re already an experienced nanny.”
“It’s me, Potter,” Draco muttered, removing his blazer and draping it gracefully across his low-backed barstool. “You’re not the only one who can’t leave the house without being attacked, though perhaps in different ways.”
“I do mean that as a compliment,” he said.
“What the hell is this?” he asked, beaming.
To his utter shock, Harry was smiling when he looked over. “Wipe that fucking smile off your face, Potter! Don’t gloss over this, don’t act like it’s normal. And don’t let them make you feel as if you deserved one single day of that hell, because you bloody didn’t. And for pity’s sake, don’t try and make me feel better right now, because I can see it in your damn heroic face that you want to! I should rot in hell for the things I said to you from the first day we met. How on earth could you ever get over any of the things you’ve gone through? Potter, your entire bloody life has been shit!”
“And no matter how many years have passed, I still refuse to admit it,” he told her loftily.
“No,” Draco replied firmly. “You don’t.”
he smelled good.
Draco snorted. “Far be it from me to cross a line drawn by the great Harry Potter.”
Harry smiled tenderly, and before Draco could react, Harry pointed his wand at him. Draco glanced down when he felt a heaviness in his lap: Harry had conjured him a blanket. He gazed upon it as if it was precious, clutching it in his fingers in an effort to keep the tears at bay.
Harry sighed once more. “Anyway, gay men who stay with their wives out of loyalty can’t be the ones who love wrong. I think you’d be good at it. At love. I think you’d be great.”
“You’re leaving now, aren’t you?” Harry asked, sighing.
“Thank you,” Harry repeated, “for telling them. I reckon I knew it would suck for you, but I never really considered exactly what that meant.”
Draco smiled at him and proceeded. “Well, as you can see, I’m not comatose, so the damage could have been much worse than it was, particularly since the curse hit me from such a close distance.”
“Draco, you have no idea how demanding I can be,” Harry said salaciously over the rim of his mug. Draco nearly choked on his last bite of toast.
“To anyone with the slightest bit of compassion,” Harry muttered, still clearly incensed, but trying hard to keep himself in check. (Forced self-control was a new look for Harry Potter, one that Draco definitely didn't hate). “How can anyone force someone into a marriage where there’s no love?”
“You did,” came the reply. “Well, not kindly, but…”
“It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it,” Harry said after they’d been silent for a moment too long. “I reckon love is hard to talk about.”
Harry’s answering smile was pure sunshine. He reached up and ran his hand through Draco’s hair.
After they both took a long sip, Potter wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then sighed.
“It’s not a joke,” Draco told him icily. “Far from it.”
Draco complied, removing the charm with a tap of his wand. Ron glared at him but quickly recovered.
Ron gave him another knowing look as he stood up, lifting Rose with him. “Time for your bath, sweetness.”
“This is all irrelevant,” Draco insisted once again. “Besides, as I’ve already told you, it would be inappropriate to continue flirting with you. I’m here to do my job.”
“He was adamant,” she reiterated. “Believe me, Malfoy, I don’t understand it either, but he wants you. Obviously he doesn’t hate you as much as we both thought. Must’ve been quite the coffee date.”
saying is that you like men...”
Draco glared over at him. “Heavens above, please tell me you didn’t just make a portmanteau of Prophet and office.”
“Draco, I promise that’s a good thing,” Harry said, chuckling. “I really like it when you tell me all about yourself. Please don’t stop.”
“Hmm, of course you did,” Draco said sarcastically.
Draco nodded stiffly. His eyes shifted to Harry.
“What, then?” Ramesh asked him. “If I may.”
Harry’s eyes glazed over, his body rigid, as Hermione levitated Rose’s empty cup in a creative way so that Rose was utterly entranced. Both she and Ron were suddenly completely focused on their little girl, and the three of them were prattling on. All of it bled into the background, because Draco was now pressing his thigh up against Harry’s, even closer than it already was. Harry pushed back against it without consciously telling himself to do so.
“Well, I’m crap at disguising myself, then, I guess,” Potter grumbled.
“About me,” Draco inferred.
As usual, Draco was trying to think of something suitable to say, and as usual, Harry beat him to the punch.
“I didn’t say that,” Draco smirked. “I said you were likeable.”
“But you can,” Harry repeated, tenderly stroking the side of his face.
Draco knew Harry couldn’t be as comfortable as he looked, having slept in jeans all night. Curiosity prompted him to glance down at his own body and, sure enough, he too was still wearing last night’s clothing: white dress shirt, black trousers. He decided he wasn’t wholly uncomfortable, but he was certainly ready for a shower, a wee, and a fresh outfit. Maybe not in that order. And now that he thought about it, his mouth tasted rather grungy as well.
“I’m sure it goes without saying, but I’d rather no one know about any of this,” Harry said softly. “Ron and Hermione know. The Weasleys know some of it. And now so do you.”
Draco smirked at him, as if he knew he was being tested. “Very cute.”
“It’s kind of a fantasy of mine to walk in on you jerking off, actually,” Harry said.
“Well, we do have summer vacation coming up at the school.”
“Yes, well, it’s how I am,” Draco repeated Harry’s phrase back to him petulantly, wisely choosing to ignore the ‘sexy’ comment.
put words in my mouth.”
The more Harry thought about those words, the sweeter they got.
Potter immediately righted his head and looked down at the table. “A lot of people do that.”
“Mmm,” was Draco’s only reply, and he parted his lips, his own breath shortening as well. Impulsively, he pulled the blanket off of them both, tossing it down past their hips so that he could see the outline of Harry’s body more clearly. Harry gasped.
tight,” Harry moaned.
Draco ignored the disturbing chill of fear in his spine and held Harry closer. “It was a nightmare, sweetheart. Only a nightmare.”
“Are you sure you didn’t mishear the ‘-tionary’ part of that word?” Harry grinned.
Draco pulled two bottles of muggle beer from his fridge and mentally shook off his nerves, telling himself that this was just Potter, a boy he had known nearly half his life. If Potter didn’t like him as he was, stormed out of the house and never spoke to him again, what did it matter? He had seen the idiot twice in four years, for pity’s sake. He could certainly survive if they never saw each other again after tonight. He may be dreaming of green eyes and stubble for a little while, but that was hardly a terrible price to pay.
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing, just…”
“--if he
Harry absently stroked his thumb and pointer finger across his prickly face and stared out the window. “I had to give my account of things just after the Battle, obviously, just so people would know what happened, and all that. But… no, I’ve never really discussed it with anyone since then. Certainly never on a personal level.”
Draco lifted his eyebrow questioningly. Harry did tend to run with a thought, didn’t he?
The spiel worked. Draco stilled in Harry’s arms and nodded at him; the authority in Harry’s voice left him speechless.
Draco nodded politely at her, stepping forward and holding out his hand for her to shake. “Hermione.”
“Hmm,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “Whatever you say.”
Draco paced, trying to follow his thoughts, but all he could think was, I want to kiss Potter. I want Potter in my bed. I want Potter in my house and my life and my head until we both die.
“Very Slytherin, then,” Harry said, a smile in his voice.
“Oh.” Immediately he pulled his hands free, mortified. “Sorry.”
“But...” Draco began cautiously. “Obviously this is all in fun; I mean, you don’t really want to, of course.”
Grimacing to himself, Draco sat down at his small kitchen table and finally let his curiosity get the better of him, opening the letter slowly and carefully. He unrolled the paper and glanced at the signature at the bottom.
“Yeah.”
“Come on,” Andrea said, taking his arm, though she looked completely perplexed. “Let’s go.”
“What do you want me to ask you?” he said.
“He also told me he couldn’t be as candid as we wanted him to,” Rosalind continued, “unless it was with someone with whom he already had a history.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well, I’m not in any rush. This relationship has happened fast enough as it is, Potter. Let me retain a semblance of control, at least in this aspect.”
Draco groaned pitifully. “Oh Merlin, go away, Potter.”
Harry smiled. “Really?”
“Look at you, even your body is shutting me out,” Harry said, and he couldn’t help but grin.
“I’m… not exactly sure,” Harry said. “Your kisses are distracting me.”
“He was intelligent, somber, raven-haired, and mean to everyone but me,” Draco explained over Harry’s laughter. “Precisely everything young Draco wanted in a man.”
,” Harry spouted, despite the fact that Draco was absolutely right. “That’ll make me want to tell all.”
“Indubitably,” Draco agreed, shuddering.
Draco finished off in the bathroom and walked back to where Potter was still standing by the bookcase.
“I'm not delusional,” Potter said with a grin. “You wish you could pull off this look.”
His bold actions were well worth it: Draco was rewarded with a surprised Harry, wide-eyed and mouth agape.
Draco snickered. “You know, you sort of resemble a werewolf, Potter.”
“I am, actually,” he replied. “I have a ton of writing to do. And anyway, I have a meeting with my editor to discuss what happened tonight.”
“No, stay, don’t move,” Draco whispered, and Harry fell back down onto the bed, back onto the pillow, back into Draco’s space. “I like your face in my face.”
He stood and walked to the door, and just before he grabbed his rucksack, Draco stood up as well.
“Yes, okay!? Things changed for me!” Draco exclaimed. “I don’t know what else to say!”
Draco knew it was illogical; it made no sense that wanking was allowed and touching each other was not. But nothing made sense at the moment. Only Harry and his wildly green eyes, Harry and his shallow breathing, Harry and his hard cock.
“You could learn a thing or two from us gays, Potter,” Draco cut him off, wanting to change the subject. “You dress as if you’re about to leap on a broomstick and take flight.”
Harry continued. “I feel lighter when you’re around. I feel like I’m safe, and cared for, and… home. You’re the other half of me, and I’m whole when you’re next to me. And I want you next to me forever, Draco. For the rest of our lives.”
“We weren’t a couple.”
“I’d like to think we can move past the hatred, now that we’re adults,” Draco said.
Draco chuckled as they slowly made their way through the lobby side by side. “You and I are the very definition of a conflict of interest.”
Without another word, she brushed past him, whiskey in hand, and left the office.
“I’ll do it,” he said, stronger. “I’ll do it, Ms Peters, and it will be the best damn feature you’ve ever read.”
Draco smiled. “Good afternoon, Weasel.”
“Well, maybe you’re wrong about this.”
“Your tea is better,” Draco muttered after another long sip. “Compliment.”
“You’re honestly the worst,” Harry laughed. “Are you getting tired yet?”
“Oh yes, all those heroic things you’ve done will always haunt you, what a tragic reality to live with.”
“Harry?” Draco asked a minute later, slowly opening his eyes once more.
Draco started to ease off of Harry only when he knew Harry was finally coming down from the high. Draco met Harry’s hooded eyes once more, and he would’ve sworn on his life that, in that moment, they could read each other’s minds.
Harry grinned at him. Why did he always have to be so damn cute?
“Well, I’m…” Harry paused, thinking hard.
Harry laughed. “Sorry, sorry. We dated for a few months, but there wasn’t a deep enough connection to take it further. I mean, emotionally. Physically, on the other hand… Yeah, that part was never an issue.”
“No,” Harry murmured, pulling away. “No, no, no.”
“And any updates or changes I should be aware of, since our quick debriefing at St Mungo’s last night?”
“You can,” Harry said gently. “We’ve been talking for hours.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah, you’re probably right. But I reckon I’m okay with that, to be honest. Fighting with you is still really fun. Even though you grossly underestimate werewolves.”
He shoved his wand in his pocket, strolled into the empty cafe, and ordered himself a hazelnut mocha, taking a seat by the window. The dark street outside was eerily quiet, and all he could think about were ghosts. As he cracked open his journal, Harry felt lonelier than he had felt in years.
“But maybe you are--”
Draco lifted a brow. “Fine.”
Draco was trying not to smile again. “Do you?”
Harry shrugged. “I just feel really comfortable in this place.”
Draco glared at him and tried not to feel smug at the compliment. “I know I do.”
“Please,” Draco said. “I’ve known for years that I was precisely your type.”
“Give me a hint,” Draco persisted.
“No wand usage though,” Draco said in an attempt to cheer him up. “So it looks like you’ve won our wager.”
Harry continued in an uncharacteristically emotionless voice. “I think they resented having to take care of me because they never really had any choice in the matter. That’s really all I can come up with. Aside from the fact that I’m a wizard, of course. They detested anything that they didn’t see as ‘normal.’”
“Then by all means, hurry up,” Harry teased, deciding to make the best of the situation. Professional or not, he was still about to spend the day with Draco; things couldn’t be that bad. “Grab and go. And make it a fire grab.”
“That is what I was asking,” Harry admitted. “And you’re single?”
Weasley’s face went red again. “You’re dating my best mate, despite being enemies for most of your life; you’re both saying you’re in love with each other after only a few weeks; and now you’ve barged into my place of work unannounced with the very purpose of discussing it. I’ll ask whatever personal questions I damn well please, Malfoy.”
Draco didn’t bother to answer, because he knew that Harry would be able to read in his face just how sure he really was. Instead, he stared directly into Harry’s eyes as he reached down to grasp his own hard cock, breathing out a deep moan of relief at the touch.
“Right,” Draco muttered.
“I don’t mind,” Harry said. “Pretty hot.”
Ron was practically pushing Harry off of his chair even as he asked, so Harry took a deep breath and slid one seat over, into the chair next to Draco, as Ron took the chair Harry had just vacated. He couldn’t help but suspect that Ron was playing matchmaker with absolutely no finesse. Infuriating, wonderful git.
“Oh yeah, gotta stay fresh and fit for your man, eh?” Ron grinned.
You’ll be proud to know that making up the guest bed was the first thing I did when I got home, and I thought of you the whole time. I’m always thinking of you.
“Oh,” Hermione stuttered, “Er--”
“Merlin, Potter, no need to state the obvious once you’ve implied it several times,” Draco spat, before he could think better of it.
“Let’s take a break for a while, Harry,” Draco said, uncrossing his legs and picking up his cup of tea (today’s cheeky mug: ‘99 problems but a snitch ain’t one’). “That was a loaded few hours."
“Nothing, thank you,” he answered. “Only… I’m...”
“Well, I’m not gay,” Harry heard himself say, and he instantly wanted to kick himself for his lack of tact.
Potter was already standing and pulling something out of a tattered navy blue rucksack on the floor that Draco hadn’t noticed before. “I know people can’t see or hear us, but I feel like I’m being watched anyway, and I don’t want to have this conversation here.”
“Oh?”
“Just what I said,” Draco smiled. “You’re always so positive and upbeat and good-natured, but at times, when I look at you, it’s like you’re still carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.”
“But you’d look so cute with bells on.”
“You already said sorry,” Harry pointed out. “At the cafe.”
“Of course it doesn’t,” Harry said, kissing his cheek. “You know I love the way you talk.”
sometimes.”
Harry grinned, not bothering to correct him about his house. “Last I checked.”
Draco lifted a hand and brushed it along the stubble on Harry’s chin.
are absolutely perfect.”
“Do I know you’re there?” Draco asked breathlessly, working his hand faster as he pictured the scene.
“And you sleep as well,” Draco added, his voice fuzzy and warm and close, but so far away.
“Mmm?"
“Don’t leave,” Harry ordered, still panting heavily. “Don’t let him take you.”
“Certainly,” he said, lifting his chin. “And my opinions are never wrong.”
“You mean which team would I have sided with?” Harry asked gently.
“None whatsoever,” he replied. “Thank you.”
“And you always wanted to be with Weasley?” he asked, cringing facetiously.
“And we complement each other, yes?” Harry continued.
Hermione let loose a nervous giggle, and Draco felt some of the tension fly from the room.
“You don’t want to be my new mission?” Harry asked him, pouting.
“Good to know you’re not above attending business meetings in tracksuit bottoms, Potter,” Draco replied dryly.
Harry smiled at him, his teary eyes full of hope. “Can I take that nod as a yes?”
“I fancy you,” Harry said softly.
He smiled at her. He’d known that they weren’t likely to have a heart-to-heart about his feelings, or how they had come about; at least not right away. It wasn’t exactly a boisterous acceptance, but it was everything he needed to hear.
“Someone who what?” he asked gruffly. “Please finish that thought, Potter.”
“Former,” Harry said in a somewhat angry voice. “And I know you can cry, I’ve seen you cry before.”
“I appreciate the apology, though,” he said quietly, taking a tentative step towards Harry.
Draco’s face lit up in a grin, and Harry had never in his life wanted to kiss anyone so badly.
“Obviously,” Draco said again, this time with a quick wink.
“What’s that face?” Harry asked him curiously, picking up his teacup.
“Okay,” Harry chuckled, taking Draco’s black blazer from the back of his chair. “But what
“Already have some made, sir,” Harry joked, swooning a little at the commanding tone of his voice, and that bloody perfect walk. “I love it when you treat me like a house elf.”
“I have an idea,” Harry said randomly, flinging his ankle over his knee.
“Oodles,” Draco replied dryly. “As ever.”
“Essentially,” he replied. “It’s a composite of all the things I love to do. Writing, obviously, but also research, communication… over-analyzing absolutely everything.”
Draco didn’t budge, however, and continued to write as he mumbled, “Leave me alone, please, Alex.”
“My Victorian prince,” Harry chuckled.
I love you, three times. Let’s make that our thing.
“Wait?” Harry questioned. “Are you talking about sex again, Malfoy?”
“You do that a lot, mate,” Ron told him matter-of-factly.
“Yeah,” Harry said, blushing slightly. “I take lots of long walks, think a lot, write in my journal, observe the world around me. I like to just kind of… be. It’s nice not to have an end goal sometimes for a change. I know, very unlike me.”
Draco folded his hands in his lap, deep in thought.
“Not complaining,” he said. “Am I keeping you from something or do you want to keep walking?”
“Cheers.”
“Like what?” Draco asked, trying hard not to stare at his muscular chest. (But not quite hard enough, apparently. Harry Potter in a white t-shirt should be illegal.)
Harry lifted his eyebrows in surprise and smiled down at him, taking the cup. “Hey, reckon that puts me at five now. Thanks, banshee.”
“Because?”
Draco expected to be called out for avoiding his emotions with more Slytherin ire, or at least for Harry to question why he was suddenly being not-so-subtly nudged out the door. But Harry took the hint far quicker than Draco had thought he would and stood up rather awkwardly.
“I apologize, that was a bit harsh,” Draco said. “It’s a very touchy subject for me, that’s all. I don’t wish to discuss my living situation with anyone, not even..."
“It’s a normal question, I reckon.”
“On the contrary,” Draco said. “I’m quite content not to be dressed as if I’m perpetually on my way to a Quidditch match.”
“Ah, I love how you talk,” Harry laughed. Draco laughed with him because there was just nothing else to be done. “Tell me about this kiss.”
“I most certainly am not,” Draco insisted, gripping the broom and leaning forward. “Larrikin.”
“I’m here,” Harry promised, touching his beautiful face. “But I wish I had been there when he--”
“Right,” Draco reluctantly forfeited, making a note to ask him about it another time. “I suppose I have to respect the rules, then. Do you like your job?”
Harry’s answering gasp was sharp and positively sublime in his ear. He exhaled heavily into Draco’s neck, his fingers digging almost painfully into the skin of Draco’s lower back.
“Godfather, yes,” Draco said. “Congratulations.”
“Alright,” Draco pressed on, a little flustered. “So you love me and want to be with me.”
Because of course Potter would check on him. Of course Potter would see him at his absolute worst, as he always had. Of course Potter wouldn’t leave him to rot on the bathroom floor, clutching the toilet for dear life. Of course Potter would use his given name at a time like this, and of course it would sound like a siren’s song on his lips.
“Mmm,” Harry murmured happily. “I can’t say as I agree with you on any of that, but I am happy you feel that way.”
Draco peered down at his list of questions to avoid the glare of it, and he decided now was the time to ask this next one.
Draco only shrugged again. He wasn’t sure how he could get himself out of this one, so he decided not to bother trying; let Harry make of it what he would. He threw back the last of his tea.
“You wouldn’t lie about me in my obituary,” Harry said, looking scandalized. “That’s far too awful, even for a Slytherin.”
know who you are.”
“I wonder why we never hooked up at Hogwarts?” Draco wondered out loud after a while.
Harry snickered. “For two blokes who don’t generally leave their houses, it seems like we have limited options.”
The intensity in Draco’s eyes softened substantially, and he smiled at Harry, freely and openly.
“Life never really got better,” Draco concluded. “Once it finally stopped getting worse, it just stayed there at the bottom.”
“Ah, yes, Draco,” Harry gasped. “I fucking love it.”
“Fuck, I want to kiss you,” Draco muttered. “You have no idea how enticing you are, Harry. You look so good right now.”
“Shut up and finish, Potter!”
Draco let that sit with him for a minute.
“I would hardly call it aggravated,” Draco argued awkwardly. “I’m perfectly fine now, after all.”
“Oi, Malfoy, did I just see you making a pass at my wife?”
Harry took a bite of toastie, looking thoughtful.
“You wanted to see me, ma’am?”
“You should feel completely normal again after you get a good night’s sleep,” Harry assured him. “And don’t forget to take your potion first; where is it?”
“Yes, I suppose Converse are a classic.”
“Do the math, Potter. It’s like I’ve already said. I grew up hearing all about the Boy Who Lived. I was excited to meet him, to be friends with him, to be popular along with him. As I’ve said, I wanted to be friends with you. Of course, my reasons were self-serving, as usual, but I still wanted that. And you hated me, almost instantly. Imagine the hit to a spoiled prat’s self-esteem, which was already embarrassingly low, I might add.”
“Don’t
“That may be the stupidest thing you’ve ever asked me, Malfoy.” He pulled Draco closer against his chest.
Harry smiled. “Think so?”
“Even former Death Eaters can be victims,” Rosalind said simply.
“Bored?” Draco asked incredulously. “With Harry Potter?”
But as he grew older and did eventually join that world, he was disenchanted not only with the dull company, but by the ridiculous duplicity of it all. Draco eventually found that he didn’t quite agree with the seemingly universal opinions that they tried to coerce him into. He was terrified to think how close they had come to succeeding.
“Well you shouldn’t have said it!” he said, louder than he seemed to want to. He glanced around the pub but then seemed to belatedly remember that he had set up a silencing charm.
Narcissa’s collected composure slipped only slightly as she stared at her son. Draco saw a flicker of understanding in her eyes.
Harry sighed and finally smiled at him. “Of course I’m on your fucking team, you wanker.”
“Tell me, Harry,” Draco urged him, feeling slightly anxious.
Harry took the magazine from him without comment (though he did bestow an indulgent wink) and set it on the nightstand. He handed Draco a fresh mug of steaming peppermint tea (‘Official Wand Inspector,’ this one read, with a picture of a particularly handsome, shirtless wizard leering suggestively at them) before perching carefully on the edge of the bed.
“Only Malfoy?” Harry once again echoed, baffled.
“Let’s have it.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, I had deduced as much.”
“What are you doing in here?” he demanded, his defenses immediately on high alert.
Harry chuckled. “But if I died of dehydration, you could spin your story into a gripping obituary. Think how popular you’d be.”
“Because he was actually kind to me, at a time when I was starved for even a scrap of validation,” Draco said truthfully, picking at the last bit of his scone. “Now that I’m older, I can see that the infatuation stemmed from that and nothing more.”
And before Harry could protest, Draco took off for the other end of the pitch, laughing the whole way.
“Ouch!” Harry said through his laughter. “Okay, come on, you really set me up for that.”
“Yes,” he replied. “And I already feel as if I have.
Ron looked as if he had just swallowed something unpleasant. “Blimey.”
“Indeed,” Draco said, plucking up his courage and choosing to speak unguardedly. “When thanked, for instance, it’s always best to simply make a joke instead of telling the person that they are most sincerely welcome, and that said person deserves to be defended with all the Slytherin ire on earth.”
Draco smiled. “And you do
Once again, thank you for reading! I'm taking a small vacation next week, so there's a chance that my usual posting schedule might be disrupted in some way. I'll try my best to stay on top of things, though, and I am absolutely NOT abandoning this story, have no fear! :) Have a lovely weekend!
Draco threw himself at Harry before he could say anything or even think, and their lips met. Harry let out a small noise of shock before he was responding to Draco enthusiastically, wrapping his arms firmly around Draco’s middle as Draco’s hands crept up into Harry’s curls, of their own volition.
Draco smiled to himself. “You definitely said that, also.”
“I thought you might like that.”
Harry grinned and disappeared from the doorway, presumably continuing his hunt for clothing down the hall and into the sitting room. Draco sighed serenely and slid back down onto his back. He could scarcely believe that he’d been riding a wave of pure bliss for three whole weeks, but here he was. He inhaled deeply; he could smell Harry all around him.
Draco rolled his eyes as his heart picked up speed. “I hardly care.”
Draco sighed again. “Please, Harry. Let me--”
“Just a couple days, we hope; three or four, tops,” Harry replied before putting his glasses back on and popping another bean in his mouth. “And then I’ll have to spend a couple more just buried in the resulting paperwork. Ergh, spinach… Is that alright?”
“Don’t you?” Draco asked in turn. His face felt hot. No, every part of him felt hot.
Draco burst out laughing. “You really are a huge arsehole, Harry Potter.”
“I have before, twice,” Draco said. “The first time just after she arrived, and the second when I helped Blaise move.”
Ron bristled. “Guess that depends.”
Harry turned around and smiled at Draco. “What are you wearing?”
Draco grinned. “Je suis content que tu le penses.”
“Your guess is as good as mine, and probably better,” she replied with a sigh. “Luckily, as you know, the Prophet’s employee contract takes proper measures against any theft of intellectual property. So, not only was he sacked, but if there is any issue with stolen information, he won’t be legally permitted to use it anywhere. In other words--”
“Oh, I meant to ask you, are you available tomorrow as well?” Draco asked.
Harry’s gaze flitted across his face. “You want to know what I’m going to think about when I wank tonight?”
“I see,” Draco said at last.
“He’s like my brother, Draco,” Harry said quietly. “We’ve been through so much together that I was really convinced that this would be easy. Maybe that was naive, but I needed him to accept this, to accept you… and he didn’t. He immediately assumed that I was under some kind of dark spell, or that you had me under the imperius curse or something… I dunno, I guess it pissed me off that he went after you without a second thought, when I had just told him how happy you make me.”
Draco let out one last sigh and simply nodded at Harry, who slowly removed his hands from Draco’s face. Harry bent down and picked up his black jeans from off the floor, and he quickly tugged them onto his body. Draco watched him, feeling a powerful sadness in his bones.
“Too old to change now,” Ron said. “This is Rose.”
“That’s right, Nymphadora,” Draco nodded. “She married Professor Lupin.”
Draco shook his head, kept shaking it as he fought back the embarrassing onslaught of emotion that threatened to spill forth at any moment.
believed it. And that was something.
“You yelled at me just this morning for taking too long styling my hair,” Draco pointed out, inhaling a shaky breath and resting his head against Harry’s. “Decidedly not a compliment.”
Harry nodded; the letters had explained as much. “They want my answer as soon as possible. And I’ve already put it off a couple times, to be honest.”
. Well, Draco supposed he was just getting tired; Potter’s voice tended to get low and raspy after talking for too long. It was bloody sexy. “I like being kept on my toes, you know.”
Nothing was working right. Harry couldn’t remember how to spell ‘perpetrator.’ His broomstick didn’t turn as easily for him. His glasses always seemed filthier than usual. He couldn’t finish his Kung Pao chicken; hell, he could barely taste it. Everything was just a little bit off. It was damn annoying, really, and yet, when he finally arrived home and opened his journal that evening, all he could write was ‘
“I know,” Draco said softly. “Though the clandestine secrecy has admittedly been a little bit exciting, don’t you agree?”
“Most definitely not,” he replied, shaking his head.
to be friends with me. And when you didn’t, I saw it as your failing, not mine.”
On top of all that, not only had he consumed more alcohol last night than he had in years (and it showed), but he had also gone to sleep without adhering to his evening skin care regimen. He thought he looked rather grey this morning. One of the unfortunate consequences of having skin this pale: it was far less forgiving than someone with, for example, Harry’s rich golden brown skin tone. Potter hadn’t looked any worse for wear this morning. Potter had looked absolutely perfect.
“Has she inherited the flaming Weasley mane?” Draco asked, levitating Rose’s plush owl from the floor into the open toy box as Harry wedged several books back into the overstuffed shelf in the corner.
“For hating you, and everything you stood for. And for everything that that hatred led me to do,” Draco muttered, the shame of it hitting him so forcefully that he could feel his shoulders folding inward. “It was wrong of me. I was wrong. About everything.”
They sat in silence for several seconds, just staring at each other. Finally they each took a long sip of their tea, glancing at each other suspiciously, until Draco sighed again.
“Someday?” Harry teased.
“Well, you did kiss me first.”
He didn’t move.
Draco giggled and rolled off of him, sitting up in bed and facing backwards so he could see Harry. His heart skipped a beat or two as he looked at his beloved, one arm flung over his head, messy hair strewn across the pillow, a soft smile on his face. Harry reached up and laced his fingers into Draco’s hair, and they merely gazed at each other. Draco felt euphoric.
“Insane?”
“See?” Harry replied sweetly. “Such a good bloke you are. Even if you do still owe me dinner.”
“I’m glad to see you’re finally accepting Weasley’s shabbiness, almost a decade later,” Draco smirked.
Draco lifted his shoulder and his eyebrow in tandem. “What of it?”
“Mmm, yes, more Draco time,” Harry murmured. “I’ll stop at home first tomorrow, then, and grab some clothes and things.”
going with Harry. His life was so much a part of Ron’s and mine from the time we were children that it would’ve felt wrong to desert him when he needed us the most. Like cutting off a limb, or something.”
The words dusted over Draco like sunshine, and he was suddenly in anguish that they had agreed to wait until after the interviews were finished to go any further. He needed Harry. He
A history.
Harry kissed the top of his head.
“So do you,” she said quietly.
Harry gently lifted Draco’s face upward so that their eyes met. There was fire in his eyes.
“You’re still a prat, you know,” Harry said. To Draco it almost sounded fond.
“Oh.”
“Indeed,” she agreed. “Regardless, they want you to come down to Auror headquarters for questioning this afternoon.”
“It’s a damn sight better than alright, Malfoy,” she muttered, grinning at him. “That’ll add some good color to the piece, I reckon. People can’t get enough of the Golden Trio. Good work. I’ll expect another summary of the notes you get from tomorrow’s meeting, on my desk Wednesday morning.”
“Oh, I was looking for your teacups,” he replied. “Ah, here we are.”
Harry smiled over at him. “Your clothes.”
“Ouch!” He clutched his chest and squeezed his eyes shut in jest. Draco grinned at his antics, even though he was irrationally furious with himself for finding this silly man so bloody adorable.
"You never used to find it charming," Draco chuckled.
“Nymphomaniac.”
Draco rolled his head back and forth as he mulled it over. “Not really. Not for a while.”
“Extraordinarily attractive?” Harry grinned. Those diamond eyes…
Instead, Harry nearly gasped when he felt Draco’s soft fingers brush up against his, skin on skin, and everything in him was electrified. They both stilled for a moment, the backs of their hands barely grazing against one another.
“A glowing review,” Draco teased. “How very kind of you.”
Draco chuckled and took a step back towards the bench behind him. “Go away, Potter.”
you to think of me. I want to be in your head, all the time. It’s very stupid, but it’s true. I want to be everything to you. Because you really feel like everything to me. You’re everything to me, Harry, already.”
“I think you mean, ‘I’m Draco Malfoy, I call the shots,’” Harry amended with a chuckle. “You like being in control.”
Harry laughed. “I think it’s because I don’t want to waste any more time. I feel ready to settle down.”
“Former, yes,” Draco conceded with a smile. “Acquitted and free. Thanks to you, of course.”
“Actually,” Draco told him, straightening his tie, “you seem perfectly capable of pouring your bloody heart out regardless of the location. Coffee shop, ice cream parlor, middle of the street--”
“Are you okay, though, really?”
“Sex?” Harry said casually. “Or a relationship?”
“‘Babe’ is a new one,” Draco said, still smiling. “And I’d make it look a lot better if it actually fit me properly. But alas, my handsome boyfriend is far too muscular for his own good.”
“Well, you obviously haven’t a clue what you really want, and I think when it comes to sex, or most things, really, if it isn’t an emphatic yes, then it should be an emphatic no. So I’m putting my foot down and drawing a line that says no shagging tonight. Deal?”
“You won’t lose me,” Harry said gruffly.
“The way I talk?”
“Okay,” Harry said reluctantly. “Erm, I’m good at quidditch.”
“You said you’d rather tell your parents alone,” Harry pointed out. “And that you thought it’d be better if I told Ron and Hermione alone, too.”
A slow smile spread over Harry’s face, and Draco had to tell himself to stop looking again.
Harry looked at him strangely and gestured for him to continue.
Harry’s eyebrows flew up.
“Would it help if I talked, then?”
Harry nodded. “I know you’re going to, don’t deny it.”
despite the hell you’ve gone through. You’re such a remarkably heroic person, and the entire world knows that. But when I’m with you, and you turn those qualities towards me... Merlin, I feel like the only person in the entire world who you want to be a hero for. You make me feel so special. So… safe, and warm, and… cherished. And I… Well. You’re remarkable.”
him instead, like they were old friends. He smiled a little bashfully as he peered back down at Rose.
When the time had finally come for Harry to head home after spending that memorable first weekend at Draco’s house, Harry had (only somewhat) facetiously insisted that Draco accompany him to the garden in his backyard to bid him farewell and kiss him goodbye beside the flowering rose bush before he disapparated.
“But how on earth did you become fluent?” Harry asked, still evidently baffled.
Draco snorted. “Hardly.”
“Fuck, you’re
“I am serious, Potter,” Draco said, a little affronted. “We obviously had some latent attraction to each other, even then.”
“Nothing, love,” Harry said with a tight smile, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Before I go, are you still on track with the Potter feature?” she asked, switching gears once more. “I imagine you’re getting to the end of the interview portion by now? Story itself is coming together?”
Draco longed for Harry’s atrocious but endearing lack of etiquette, for the way Harry was always covered in crumbs after eating, for his stupid jokes told through a full mouth. He longed for Harry, full stop.
“Whatever happened to bringing Rose to your parents’ house this evening?” Harry asked. He opened their charming old-fashioned refrigerator and got himself a butterbeer.
“I think… I’m nervous,” Draco said, without filter.
“Well that’s not going to happen with me,” he said defiantly.
Draco laughed, flattered and sort of insulted but all in all a little pleased. He felt himself blushing.
“You were a couple?” Harry demanded. He knew his voice sounded too quiet to be casual. “You and that fucking thug?”
“Oh yeah,” Harry grinned.
A long while later, after Harry had fallen asleep curled up in his embrace, Draco lay awake, wondering what had set Harry off when they had ended their evening together so cheerfully. He knew better than anyone that the horrific nightmares could creep up without warning at times, but the incident still left him deep in thought. He couldn’t stand to see Harry in pain, and he felt compelled to do something, anything, to ease the burdens that Harry had had to carry for his entire life. By the time Draco finally fell asleep as the sun was peeking over the horizon, he had only one idea.
“What?” Harry demanded, smacking him on the arm.
“Yes I am,” Harry said proudly. “I’m a romantic, sentimental fool and I’m just so into you.”
“Yes,” he stated, a bit defensively. “Is that a problem?”
“You ask a loaded question, Potter,” Draco teased.
“I don’t hate it,” Harry mumbled. “I’ve forgiven you.”
“Sure am,” Harry agreed. “And don’t apologize, it’s mad cute.”
Draco stared at him warily. (Oh god, his facial hair was magnificent.)
They kissed again, and Draco felt the snitches in his stomach slowly begin to nudge him out of his melancholy mood. Kissing Harry still set his body on fire.
“For pity’s sake, Potter, you’re late for work."
Finally Draco looked back down at his portfolio, and only then did Harry realize that his heart was pounding.
“Anyway,” Harry sighed. “I didn’t stay too long after that. It was pretty frosty. We didn’t exactly leave things in a good place.”
“Yes, yes,” Draco said, waving his hand impatiently. “Your divination skills are borderline genius, etcetera. And then?”
Draco rolled his eyes at his adorable teasing. At least, he assumed Harry was teasing. It was difficult to get a handle on anything when he was trying and failing to dispel the new mental image of Harry spread out naked in bed, wanking for him, slowly, leisurely, like a torture…
“I hope you’re not married to those clothes, because Rose is going to spill something on you,” Harry warned him, moving into the sitting room as his pulse still raced. He needed to focus on other things before he pounced on Draco like a bloody feral cat.
“What the hell are you doing, Potter?” Draco asked, laughing at his antics.
“Anyway, I quite like it when you dote on me,” he said, smiling sweetly up at Harry.
“I always feel better when you’re around,” Harry said, smiling gently at him. “But I feel… what’s that word? Not morbid...”
“I guess I mean to say, thank you for listening, Harry.”
. Oh fuck, but he’d missed him too.
“Gardening? So you planted all those flowers outside?” Harry asked him.
Draco finished in the loo and crossed the sitting room to his armchair without looking at Potter. Draco reached for his beer and noticed a glass of water beside it, which Harry must have summoned for him. Something about it made his heart stutter. He looked up to see that Harry was looking at him as he thought of dropped quaffles.
“Part of me knows that I deserve it,” Draco whispered.
Harry grinned. “Yes, sir.”
Harry sighed again. “I get it.”
“Do forgive the hitting,” Hermione said with a sigh. “She’s all about hammering objects on people these days. Luckily, we’ve not reached the stage where she’s running about yet, getting into everything; she still loves being held. And at least you’re only getting hit with Oscar; I got a sippy cup to the temple this morning.”
“What’s enough?” Harry said from beside him. Had he said that out loud?
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “Go on.”
“You should know by now that I like weird, Potter,” Draco murmured. “I want to hear everything that you think about. Every disgusting, depraved detail.”
“Safe travels?” Harry mocked him, folding his arms in front of his chest, and oh dear, those muscles looked more appealing than ever. Draco was damn near convinced that Harry was doing it on purpose, just to toy with him. Mission accomplished.
“Is it still cold out?” he asked, trying to calm himself.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from tumbling headfirst into Malfoy’s eyes as he spoke. What color were they? They weren’t even really a color, just… diamonds. Merlin, how distracting.
“Look,” Rosalind said, her voice suddenly turning apprehensive as she paused and stared at him. “I want you to be completely honest with me, Malfoy. Do you genuinely and sincerely believe that you can handle this story?”
He nodded at their ghostly figures and resolutely picked up his wand. “I know.”
Draco paused.
“Got it,” he said, waiting for a clue as to whether or not he could leave.
in Britain,” he amended pointedly.
done in
Draco nodded. “Hello.”
“You can’t know that.”
“Don’t you, Harry?” Draco asked, though he could plainly see that his inkling was spot on.
Harry kissed his bare shoulder and then Draco felt the bed shift, and all of Harry’s warm weight was suddenly gone. Draco whined a little in protest, pulling the blanket up over his shoulder to cover the sudden chill of Harry’s absence.
Without thinking, Draco dropped his hand into Harry’s lap and gently rubbed his fingers against Harry’s rapidly stiffening cock.
He sighed. “I don’t bloody know. You…”
“Make me vomit, Potter,” Draco said. “And what about Granger?”
“We’ll have to,” he insisted.
All the blood immediately rushed through Harry's body and his ears started to ring. Oh god, that was
“You’re such a pervert, Potter,” Draco said, his face flushing with pleasure, and he was suddenly dying to ask what else Potter fantasized about.
“You don’t need to be sorry,” Harry muttered into his neck, “but please don’t say those things about yourself anymore. I hate hearing anyone speak ill of you, even you. It’s all very confusing, and I’m already tired and hungry and you know I confuse easily when I’m tired and hungry.”
She breathed deeply and squeezed his hand. “I’m thinking many things, Draco."
“Did you always know you wanted children?” Draco asked, opening up his folder as subtly as he could.
“What a twisted little wanker you are,” Draco said, smirking.
There was nothing else he wanted to say just then, and as he looked down at Harry’s head between his legs, slowly lapping up the last of Draco’s cum, Draco fell in love with him all over again.
Draco held out his hand and Harry took it and shook. After a moment, they looked up into each other’s eyes, both smiling like children as they squeezed each other’s fingers.
“Besides,” Draco said, fighting to regain his equilibrium. “The scars are rather sexy, I’ve been told.”
His throat burned, and he was unable to look at her again, unable to add anything else to his woefully feeble apology. To his surprise, she reached over and squeezed his hand for only a brief moment before pulling it away again. It was so strange… but he didn’t hate it at all.
“It’s a great wow,” Draco grinned, staring back at him. His eyes were as vivid as emeralds, and a contented, sleepy smile played on his lips. There was a sheen of sweat on his forehead, and somehow it made his scar stand out even more. Draco wanted to lean over and lick it. He was delirious with desire for him, even in the aftermath of such an intense orgasm. God, he wanted to touch Harry so badly that his fingers itched. “Are you alright?”
“I hardly lost, Potter!” Draco exclaimed, and Harry rejoiced at the familiar indignance in his expression. “I caught the snitch twice!”
“Oh,” Draco replied, surprised. “Thank you.”
Draco reached over and gripped Harry’s hand for a brief moment, before he seemed to remember that he shouldn’t, then snatched it away again.
“I know,” Harry agreed, nodding. “But I’m not ashamed of you, Draco, and I hate that you think I am.”
Harry exhaled heavily, and without another word, they both began to move their hands.
“Have you, then?” Harry asked, grabbing another bean.
Draco laughed, uninhibited, and took Harry’s hand. “Well, for that I most certainly apologize.”
But before he could even reach for his own wand, he felt the sharp shock of a curse hitting him in the forehead. He crumpled to the ground in a heap before everything faded away to nothing.
Either way, he had to assume he’d never hear from The Stranger again, since he was Draco Malfoy, and that was just the way it worked. And anyway, on top of that, he’d said some truly foolish things in his drunken state. What man in his right mind would agree to go on a date with him, particularly after his forwardness last night?
Before he could overanalyze like always, however, Ron distracted him by yanking both broomsticks away from Draco’s grasp like an impatient child. He tossed one at Harry’s feet before hopping onto the other and taking off into the evening sky with a whoop. Draco rolled his eyes (really, how old was he?) as he situated himself on one of the three red adirondack chairs around the fire pit, balancing his portfolio and quills on its wide armrest. Hermione started a fire with her wand, and Harry hastily lifted Rose up off his shoulders, clearly itching to get back on a broom as well.
“Only when I want him,” Draco amended. “And I’ve never wanted a man the way that I’ve wanted you, Harry."
Harry pulled Draco forward by his arms so that he was sitting up, and suddenly Harry was yanking his jumper up. Draco happily let him, shimmying his wrists out of the sleeves and automatically, out of habit, running a hand over his hair to tame it once Harry had removed his jumper.
“Trust me, I haven’t forgotten,” Harry said, blushing.
“Suit yourself,” Harry said with a sigh, handing Draco his mug back. “How’d it go with Hermione? Or am I not allowed to ask that either?”
“I dunno,” Harry concluded with a shrug. “I like when you’re around. You improve my life. I think you even improve
Harry took a long swig of butterbeer, and Draco chewed on his bottom lip for a moment, trying to read Harry’s eyes. He couldn’t this time.
“You always sound so poetic,” Harry said in that wonderful sleepy voice. “You’re like a really smart fairy.”
Harry shook his head and looked down at his hands in his lap. Draco furrowed his brow as the cold truth slowly crept under his skin.
“Very well,” he said softly. “You don’t need to decide straight away.”
“Nice week?” Harry asked, moving aside to make room for him in the narrow entranceway. He was close enough to smell… and he smelled divine.
“Yes,” he finally said. “Yes, I think I would like that.”
“Are you looking to be graded?” Draco trailed his fingers along Harry’s toned bicep and then attempted to smooth out a wrinkle in the back of Harry’s shirt.
Draco could feel his face light up. “Really?”
. “I will not,” Harry said, smiling.
“Get used to it, Malfoy,” Harry muttered.
Harry snorted and smeared his own toast with marmalade after Draco had finished with it. “Hey, you were up really early.”
“That’s terrible,” Harry snarled.

“Draco…” he whispered, then shook his head. “Fuck.”
“Cheers,” he muttered, concentrating too hard to look up.

“You didn’t tell them,” he repeated.
“Oh,” Potter said. “Malfoy.”
He sat down on the armchair and counted to five, wishing that he could shake the gloom that had settled between the two of them this evening. He dispiritedly picked up his book, deciding that his earlier daydream of cuddles and kisses on the couch was unlikely to come to fruition now.
Ron sighed deeply and folded his hands in front of him. “Then I reckon I have some questions for you.”
She smiled tightly, knowing that his inability to discuss the war was still a sore subject for him, even ten years later. Ron glanced uneasily between the two of them.
