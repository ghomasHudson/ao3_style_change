Draco watches his hands move, completely entranced as his fingers handle the delicate clippings. Maybe that’s why he doesn’t hear the door to the greenhouse creak open or the soft clack of Astoria’s heels on the dirt floor, only startling and snapping his head up in irritation when he hears his name being called.
But they don’t do tender. That’s not them, can never be. So Draco shoves those feelings down deep where no one will ever find them.
Potter is silent for a moment. Then his lips are pulling up into a smirk and his eyes are flashing with amusement. “You ended up enjoying the chocolates.”
With autumn fast approaching, they decide to take advantage of the warm air and sunshine, sitting outside at one of the wooden tables.
The sight he’s met with when he comes around to the back garden has an involuntary smile spreading across his face. Various Weasley’s are on their brooms tossing a Quaffle back and forth. Molly is levitating trays of food, enough to feed a small army, to a long table that’s set up. They are balls of light floating over the table, making the already mouth watering food look even more delectable. Hundreds of fairy lights are wrapped around the trunks of a number of trees and the fire is already burning brightly, the flames reaching up towards the darkening summer sky.
So, no, Harry is not making a big fuss about the date. It isn't like he has anyone to spend it with and even if he did, he certainly wouldn’t be wasting his Galleons on any of the things he sees displayed.
“Where did you learn to cook like this?” Draco asks. Draco himself never bothered to learn, always having house elves, both at home and Hogwarts, to provide food.
Harry is beyond grateful that she spoke up first, and straight to the point. But her words are exactly what he was afraid of. If she can’t get through to Draco then Harry doesn’t have a chance.
“What the fuck Potter! We were having a conversation you mannerless git,” Draco yells as he stomps down the stairs to the kitchen. His boots thump loudly against the old wooden steps, the sound echoing around him.
Draco’s eyes go comically wide when he sees it and he brings a hand up to his mouth, a soft, shocked sound escaping him.
“Oi! That hurts,” Ron exclaims, rubbing his side, “Would someone please tell me what the hell is going on here.”
Draco pulls out and scoots back, giving Harry room to flip over. Then he takes Harry’s legs and hooks them over his arms, before he lines back up and pushes inside once more.
There’s nothing for it though, he has to get this done. He starts with a batch of Dreamless Sleep that is to be delivered to St. Mungo’s by the end of the week. The process is long and tedious, and Draco finds his mind wandering.
Draco knows his mouth is hanging open in shock but he can’t do anything to close it. He’s frozen, his entire world on pause. Harry’s words are echoing in his mind as his lungs struggle to bring in air.
They make their way into the living room where Harry takes a seat on the sofa and Malfoy drops down beside him, kicking off his shoes and stretching out his long legs. He’s been in Harry’s home a few times now and Harry’s pleased with how relaxed Malfoy seems to be.
Draco is one of only three people with the privilege of Apparating directly into Grimmuald Place and it thrills him every single time.
He’s doing it for Albus he tells himself firmly. It’s a play date, no big deal. Harry can handle that. He sets down his tumbler of firewhisky and goes to sit at his desk. He quickly sorts through the clutter enough to find a blank piece of parchment and a quill.
The guard goes to retrieve his father and Draco takes a moment to breathe carefully in and out, counting backwards from ten inside his head. He needs to be in complete control of himself when his father comes in. Lucius Malfoy can identify a weak spot and exploit it in a matter of seconds. Even after years in Azkaban, his mind is still sharp.
Harry stalks closer, just barely resisting the urge to grab Draco and shake him. “Seeing that I’m the bloke you’ve been sleeping with for over a year now, I think I deserve some kind of explanation.”
Draco unwraps the small package, wondering what it will be today. Harry never sends anything extravagant, just small things; chocolates he likes, the quill he admired in Diagon one afternoon, a book he mentioned in passing.
They already know each other so well, already so comfortable with each other, that there’s no awkward silences or floundering for topics to talk about.
Draco had purposely worn his brightest jumper along with Muggle jeans just to see his father look at him with distaste. He has to get his amusement when he can after all.
The push and pull of tension and adrenaline pulsing between them is familiar, though. Strangely comforting. This is just them. They’ve always been drawn to one another and even when hate was all that was between them, they still saved each other.
“No, no. We have to go pick up Rose. I’ll talk to you tomorrow,” Hermione grabs Ron by his arm and drags him towards the fireplace, “It was nice seeing you, Draco.”
For ten years, Harry’s life has been Malfoy free and now here one of them is, being polite and civil and Harry really just wants to punch him in the face.
He resists the urge to wrap his hand around Draco and start stroking, and instead slides his fingers up under Draco’s shirt and across his stomach, petting gently and feeling the muscles jump in response. His other hand moves lower, cupping Draco’s balls and tugging.
“You needn’t worry. I have no plans to hex you. Yet,” Ginny says with a threatening but playful glint in her eyes, “I will though—hex you that is, if you harm a single hair on his head.”
People watching was something his father had encouraged from a young age. Blend in, be silent, watch, observe. Blackmail material is easy to come by when you’re skilled at the exercise.
“I never signed them,” Draco says simply. Harry’s eyes snap up, full of questions and something Draco thinks might be hope, “I tried to. I put quill to parchment at least a dozen times but I couldn’t do it,” Draco swallows nervously, meeting Harry’s eyes with an unwavering gaze, “I can’t walk away again. I still love you. I’ve always loved you, even when I hated you, and I’m pretty sure I’m gonna love you forever.”
A minute passes silently, and still Harry can’t come up with anything, all the words his mind produces either ridiculous or inappropriate.
“All done. Look we match,” Harry says with a lopsided grin, lacing their fingers together and lifting their hands, showing off his own pink band.
Harry doesn't know when exactly he jumped head first into the rabbit hole that is his feelings for Malfoy, but he’s still waiting to reach the bottom. Free falling and only able to hope that it doesn’t end with him shattering to pieces.
And that’s how Draco ends up standing on the stoop of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, wearing borrowed jeans and a soft, long sleeved shirt that smells like Harry.
Malfoy is looking down at him with a soft look of affection on his face. Then the corner of those full lips twitch up and there’s that smirk. It’s mischievous but Harry isn’t worried. He has nothing to fear. Whether awake or asleep, Harry trusts him. He knows he’ll let Malfoy do whatever he likes, surrender himself to it.
And of course, he keeps his word. Not allowing Harry to leave the sanctuary of the bedroom for a long, long time.
“Fuck,” Draco bites out, as he sways on his feet. But Harry’s strong arms keep him upright, holding tightly to his sides as he walks them backwards towards the bed.
Malfoy blows an irritated breath out through his nose. “Yes, Potter, I can see that. What I meant, was why did this arrive with that menace of an owl and interrupt my dinner?”
It’s 3:07 a.m. and Harry can’t sleep. He has to be at the Ministry in a few short hours to start what will be his last week of Auror training, so he really needs to get some rest. He shifts around, trying to get comfortable in the unfamiliar bed of Ron and Hermione’s guest room.
Malfoy doesn’t say anything right away, instead he lifts his sunglasses off his nose and settles them on his head. He meets Harry’s eyes for a moment and then looks away, clearing his throat.
“Fine,” she says with a sigh, “Only because I don’t have time for your stubbornness this morning. But we are going to talk about this Draco, soon,” Astoria kisses his cheek and takes a step back, “I came out here to tell you that I received an owl from the Ministry, I have to go in early today.”
Draco doesn’t say anything either, walking inside and standing there staring at Potter as if he holds all the answers. Potter stares back, a frown pulling his eyebrows together. His green eyes are jumping back and forth between Draco’s, probably looking for an explanation.
“Yes, we can see that,” Hermione says slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth between them with a knowing look that Harry doesn’t like one bit.
“Yeah, yeah exactly. He’ll come around,” Harry promises, giving in to the need to touch Malfoy and squeezing his shoulder lightly.
Draco’s speechless in the wake of her words. Hermione stands from the table, throwing down a few Muggle notes, obviously intending to leave without giving Draco a chance to reply.
Harry mouths at his inner thighs. “Don’t,” he says, voice muffled as the words are mumbled into Draco’s skin, “I wanna hear you. Wanna make you feel good.”
Draco smirks, keeping his eyes on Harry, and then his mouth is sliding down, his tongue swirling delicate patterns against the soft skin of Harry’s cock as he goes. Both of Harry’s hands are buried in Draco’s hair now, gently directing his head, and Draco moans again. He reaches down and frees his own dick from the confine of his jeans, pulling off of Harry’s cock just long enough to lick his own hand, before he’s stroking himself, moving in perfect sync with his mouth.
Harry smiles and lifts Draco’s arm to his lips. Starting at Draco’s wrist, Harry places kiss after kiss up the entirety of the tattoo.
“And uh your wife? Where is she today?” Harry asks, trying to remember which Greengrass sister it is that Malfoy married.
Hermione bustles in a moment later and spots him immediately. Draco watches as she winds her way through the small tables, her blue dress swinging against her legs. She looks commanding and beautiful. Merlin, he’s missed her.
It hasn’t escaped Draco’s notice that Potter is wearing his old Gryffindor scarf, and Draco has acted accordingly, wearing his own house scarf as well. The thought of Potter with Draco’s Slytherin green scarf around his neck makes Draco’s pulse quicken, and an idea quickly forms in his mind.
The conversation flows easily for a few minutes but then his father complains about how Draco refuses to bring Scorpius to visit, and the backhanded insults start.
The hurt flashing in bright green eyes is the last thing he sees before he Apparates away with a crack.
“Excuse me Mr. Parker, but I wish to speak to my son,” Narcissa says, standing and smoothing down her pale blue robes.
“Scorpius,” Malfoy scolds, but Scorp is already taking the stairs two at time, “I’m sorry. I swear we taught him manners.”
He tries to keep his eyes from searching out Harry and fails miserably. Draco doesn’t want to think about the disappointment he feels when he doesn’t spot that mop of dark hair anywhere in the sea of red.
Draco Apparates back to his apartment after what has to be the longest day ever. He spent the day, and most of the evening, going over and attempting to make the final changes to the September issue of
They’ve continued their ritual of meeting for morning coffee, so much so, that the barista doesn’t even bother asking for their orders anymore. They’ve become regulars. Harry isn’t sure how to feel about that. It makes him feel kind of old, but he decides not to be bothered by it. There’s also the fact that when he spends his mornings with Malfoy it’s usually the highlight of his day.
Potter and both of his sons are already bundled up in warm coats, scarves and gloves, matching red bobble hats on each of their heads. Draco’s dreading the prospect of getting all the extra layers onto Scorpius but warming charms only do so much.
Draco’s heart stops. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever forgive himself for hurting Harry but he’ll reassure him every damn day for the rest of his life if that’s what it takes.
Draco doesn’t waste any time. Harry is already hard, the head of his cock wet and peeking out of his foreskin. Draco licks over the slit, collecting the pre-come on his tongue and moaning at the taste and smell of Harry’s arousal. One of Harry’s hands goes to his hair, pulling lightly, while the other tips his chin up, forcing Draco to meet his eyes.
Harry takes his time, twisting and curling his finger as he pumps it gently. It’s only when Draco starts moaning, demanding
“Hands above your head,” Draco says, smiling at the full body shudder his words cause, “You’re going to lay back and just enjoy.”
“It’s complicated,” Malfoy sighs, a weary expression clouding his face, “Maybe one day I’ll tell you.”
Draco can only stare in a shocked sort of arousal, the confusion from his earlier revelation causing a storm of conflicting emotions to brew in his chest.
Draco also has come to accept the fact that he has to tell Kade about who he really is and explain the details of his questionable past. And the more Draco thinks about how he’s going to tell him and how Kade will react, the more uncertain he becomes. The same irritating voice keeps nagging him, telling him that if he really loved Kade, he wouldn’t have all this doubt. The fact that Draco has yet to sign the divorce papers only amplifies the voice. He’s been making excuses all week and now it’s Friday, his Portkey is leaving tonight.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. So he sits there, twisting his hands in his lap, the silence ringing in his ears violently.
In a fit of spontaneous clarity, Harry grabs his wand. He tries not to focus too much on the fact that it takes him three tries before he’s able to cast his Patronus, but once the stag stands before him, he knows exactly what he wants to do.
“I wouldn’t, ever,” Draco says with sincerity, the thought of hurting Harry so abhorrent to Draco that his stomach twists in on itself.
Draco tenses and he can actually hear Harry’s jaw clenching. He turns and cups Harry’s face in his hands. “Harry, listen to me. I had no idea he would show up here, I swear. He must of worried when I didn’t arrive with my Portkey yesterday.”
“Fine,” Draco says, pressing a kiss to Harry’s lips, both of them lingering just a bit too long for polite company.
Draco places one last biting kiss to the side of Harry’s neck, the sweet pleasure-pain making Harry’s cock twitch and leak against the sheets.
Harry sits in the chair beside Draco and rests a hand on his thigh. Draco’s hair is hanging loose around his face, ripped free from the hair tie by Harry’s hands. His lips are pink and swollen from Harry’s teeth and there’s a purpling bruise on his neck, just under his sharp jaw.
“Harry dear, would you mind accompanying me on a walk through the gardens? I could use help feeding the peacocks,” Narcissa asks in a way that doesn’t sound like a question at all.
Once in the privacy of his room, Draco opens the letter, immediately recognizing Ron’s messy scrawl.
“I could do with a pre-dinner snack,” Ron replies, rubbing his hands together in excitement. He grins at Harry and mutters his thanks when a bowl is placed in front him.
“Is this really what you want?” Harry finally asks, once Draco’s mostly dressed, and he doesn’t recognise his own voice, “Some sham of a marriage—she’ll never be able to make you happy.”
Potter comes with a gutted out sound, his movements going erratic and then slowing as he shudders through the aftershocks.
When he walks into the kitchen he finds Kade leaning against the large island eating the last few bites of his breakfast. Draco’s own breakfast is waiting for him under a warming charm.
“Harry.” Ron looks uncomfortable, rubbing at the back of his neck. “Listen, you know what I think about Malfoy, but if he’s the reason—“ Ron shakes his head and takes another sip of his drink, leaving Harry to wonder what the end of that sentence had been. “All I’m saying is, I trust you. If you think he’s changed, that’s good enough for me. You don’t have to lie about being friends with him.”
“Hmm,” Harry hums, pushing Draco’s hair back and pressing a soft kiss to his forehead, “Falling in love with you was my favorite. It was the best surprise of my life.”
He seems to keep forgetting that this isn’t his life anymore. And though there’s a part of Draco that longs to go back to New York, there’s another part that wishes he could stay here and pretend the last five years never happened.
He lands in the kitchen of Grimmuald Place and inhales deeply through his nose. He can immediately tell that Draco is no longer there. As he makes his way through the big empty house, the loneliness that he constantly carries with him presses down, threatening to suffocate him.
Malfoy takes Scorpius’ hand as well and the four of them awkwardly make their way down the hall. Harry and Malfoy don’t speak to each other again, but the boys keep up their happy chatter the whole way.
Malfoy seems a little surprised by the invitation, which is ridiculous. They’ve had dinner together a number of times by now, hell they see each other nearly everyday. It isn’t that strange of Harry to offer.
“I have to go,” Draco says, staggering back another step, “I shouldn’t have shown up here like this. It was terribly rude. I—“
When they part later that afternoon, Malfoy offers his hand this time and asks if they can get together again. Harry eagerly agrees and the boys squeal with excitement.
Harry moves, rocking his hips back and forth, again and again and again. Draco moves with him, brings his knees up to get more leverage. It doesn’t take long to establish a rhythm, for Harry to start fucking himself on Draco’s cock in earnest. Lifting up and dropping back down, over and over, until his legs begin to burn and his arms shake from holding himself up.
Draco opens his mouth to explain that they most definitely are not, but it’s then that Harry steps back into the kitchen, cradling a blue-haired toddler in his arms like he was born to do it, and Draco’s heart literally stops. Because Merlin help him, Draco is having
Draco snatches the package up before the sauce can start to soak in. He shoots a glare towards the menace of an owl, who is now perched on his countertop.
Harry’s eyes stray to Draco, where he stands in the middle of the room, his back ramrod straight as he stares unseeing out the French doors, chewing his bottom lip nervously.
“The best thing that could happen would be Potter feeling the same way, and then the Prophet would have a field day and his friends would have him admitted to the Janus Thickey ward,” Draco answers, his voice flat, because that’s the sad reality.
So Harry kisses him. Mouth dragging over his lips, his cheekbones, across both closed eyelids as he thrusts harder, making pleasure spark everywhere.
“One more question and then I have to get going. Or else the only thing I’ll get done today will be drinking coffee and talking to you, which surprisingly enough wouldn’t be the worst thing ever,” Potter says with a teasing smile and Draco’s heart thumps wildly in his chest. God, he’s in so much trouble.
“I love you too,” Harry replies quietly, giving Draco one more kiss before dragging him out of the warmth and comfort of their bed.
He curls his fingers around the edge of the table until his knuckles turn white, and tries to focus on something other than the way his pulse is thudding wildly at the sight of Draco standing at the bar. He’s almost stood up three times now, but has managed to talk himself out of it. His patience is thinning though, and he feels ready to snap.
Draco feels sore and well-used as he straightens up and stretches. Potter is already across the room, quickly pulling his clothes back on. Draco moves to do the same, firmly ignoring Potter’s presence.
“Ugh! Fine Hermione,” Harry says, throwing his arms in the air, “It went terrible. He’s only back for me to sign the divorce papers. He ran his mouth, I lost my temper. Did you really expect anything else?”
The rest of December flies by. Having the boys at home everyday while they’re on winter break leaves little time for Harry to do much other than keep them occupied. But he manages to get his shopping done and the presents wrapped and under the tree by Christmas Eve.
The door swings open a minute later and Draco sucks in a sharp breath. The resemblance to Bellatrix is uncanny, but then Andromeda smiles at them and it’s nothing like the menacing sneer Aunt Bella’s face used to twist into.
The question surprises Harry. Most people don’t ask why, they just share their feelings on the matter, as if Harry has nothing better to do than listen to complete strangers drone on about his career options or his love life.
“You’re sorry,” Kade says flatly, “Draco, do you have any idea how crazy with worry I’ve been? You don’t show up with your Portkey, you don’t answer my calls. Jesus. You lied about everything. Was any of it real?”
“Who said we were done?” Potter asks, not waiting for an answer before he steps closer to Draco and snakes a hand inside his trousers, “You’re still hard.”
Harry was surprised, and relieved, that Draco hadn’t questioned Kreacher’s whereabouts the other day. Now those two had gotten on splendidly. Harry rolls his eyes, thinking about how much Kreacher loved having a proper Black heir to serve.
” Harry moans. Draco tightens around him and his thighs are trembling, and he’s just so goddamn perfect it’s making Harry crazy, “You’re mine.”
Harry and Malfoy burst into laughter, their heads knocking together, and Harry only vaguely hears the click of the camera, too focused on the sound of Malfoy’s musical laughter so close to his ear. It’s a sound he doesn’t think he’ll ever grow tired of hearing.
When he steps out into the kitchen of Grimmuald Place, he finds Harry taking the kettle off the stove.
“I love you,” Draco says softly, reminding himself of the first time he uttered those words, so many years ago in the middle of a muddy field, rain beating down on them, “Harry, I’m here and I’m not going anywhere. I promise. I’m yours.”
Harry kisses him, biting at his bottom lip a little as he retreats. He stands from the table and makes like he’s headed for the loo. With no one watching too closely he’s able to slip unnoticed out the door leading to the side alley.
“Thank you,” Draco steals a kiss, just a quick press of lips, before looking at Harry with narrowed eyes, “Where’s my present?”
It doesn’t matter if Potter returns his feelings, it would never work out between them. People would never accept it. Astoria doesn’t know what she’s talking about Draco tells himself firmly.
“Malfoy’s back!” Ronald Weasley exclaims when he finally walks up, “I’m reconsidering my opinion of your boyfriend, mate. He brought us shots.”
Draco looks around panicked and realizes the table has cleared, the others escaping without his notice. He’s well and truly on his own. Fuck.
“Let me go. I’m fine. Just let me go so I can leave,” Harry’s eyes are cold, all of the warmth that’s usually there when he looks at Draco gone, “Please, let me go. If I have to look at this piece of shit for another second I’ll be sick.”
Harry does so immediately, pulling almost the whole way out before thrusting back in hard. He sets up a steady rhythm and Draco loses himself in the feeling until he can no longer tell where his body ends and Harry’s begins.
Harry slips another finger in, stretching them apart at the same time he squeezes his hand down on Malfoy’s throat once more. Malfoy moans, quiet and raspy. His cock is hard, wet at the tip where it curves up against his stomach, leaving a salty trail of fluid that gleams in the low light of the bedroom.
While it certainly wouldn’t be the first time Harry was confronted with an upset Draco Malfoy and preceded to fuck it up beyond repair, the logical part of his brain knows that this is classic Draco. Lashing out and pushing him away.
To think of what might have happened, if on that morning, Harry had gotten up the first time his wand buzzed to wake him. He wouldn’t have been late. Draco wouldn’t have, quite literally, ran into him and Harry wouldn’t be here now.
Harry is on time every morning for the rest of the week, which means he doesn’t run into Malfoy again. And that’s good, surely. Just because they’re both apparently capable of civil conversation doesn’t mean they have to over do it.
Harry seems ready to argue but the redhead simply raises an eyebrow and purses her lips. Draco watches—in something akin to terror—as Harry gives in, standing from the table with a strained smile and a warning look at his ex.
Draco’ll come up with a perfectly understandable reason for why he needs to stay a few more days and Kade will just have to get over it.
“See you Friday, Malfoy,” he says with a smile and then he’s gone, out the door and disappearing into the sea of people outside.
Fair warning though, this is still pretty angsty, but things will start getting better soon and there will absolutely be a happy ending!
“We aren’t going to get much talking done if you can’t keep your hands off me,” Draco says, his mouth pulled up into Harry's favorite smirk.
Harry’s going to fix this mess with Draco. Well, if he can find his voice and actually call out the address that is. He’s been standing in front of his fireplace for ten minutes, trying to work up the courage to step into the flames.
He’s been fidgeting constantly, nervous energy keeping him in constant movement all day. It’s almost torture to sit here and let Astoria have her fun.
Draco keens high in his throat, fingers immediately moving to free his dick and get a hand around himself. And then his mouth is back on Harry, hot and wet, driving Harry closer with every flick of his tongue.
Anxiety spiking, Draco rambles, “You told me how happy you were to have the Black tapestry restored, so I just thought you might like one for the Potters’ as well. Hermione helped me trace the bloodlines back and I found a magical artist to commission. I know it’s not a fun present or anything, but I—I thought it was something you might like to have. I’m sorry if I overstepped or—“ Draco snaps his mouth shut as Harry turns towards him, because Draco has never seen Harry look at him quite the way he is now. His eyes are wet but the smile tilting his lips is blindingly bright.
This time when Harry moves down Draco’s body, he doesn’t hesitate, taking Draco’s cock into his mouth without preamble. Draco quickly becomes incapable of forming a coherent thought, the only words in his head,
“Yes,” Draco says firmly, nodding his head, “He’s amazing Hermione. I know you’d love him if you gave him a chance.”
Narcissa greets Harry warmly, quietly thanking him for making Draco happy. His face flushes and he stammers through the conversation but it could have gone worse. After that he sticks to Draco’s side, quietly fading to the background.
“Oh come on, Draco,” Astoria says with a roll of her eyes, “All the coffee dates and the movies and he’s here all the time. You two act like you’re attached at the hip. I think you should kiss him and just get on with it already.”
“I’d hold it against you if you didn’t,” she says hooking her arm through his and pulling him further into the room.
Harry pulls his fingers out and whispers the lubrication charm, slicking his cock. He reaches around and uses the leftover lube to give Draco’s own neglected cock a few firm strokes. Then Harry flips him over easily, kneeling between Draco’s splayed legs and just looks for a moment.
“I have to—I’m sorry but I can’t do this.” He knows he’s breathing too fast, probably looks like he’s gone mad, but he doesn’t care. He needs to talk to Harry, has to fix this before it’s too late.
Harry sinks to the floor, his pulse pounding in his ears and his chest tightening. Tears prick at the corners of his eyes as he tries to take careful breaths. In. And out. But his lungs feel constricted, his mouth dry, and he can’t swallow against the sob building in his throat.
As Harry entertains himself with all the different tactics he can use to avoid Draco, his eyes stray over to the metal cabinet that sits in the corner of the room. Silently cursing himself, he gets to his feet and walks over to the offending piece of furniture. Even after all this time it still unnerves him to see it sitting there, the front devoid of any decoration. He lets his fingers brush against the cold metal, hesitating slightly, before pulling the doors open and staring solemnly at the magnets that clutter up the back of them.
Draco could give in, and god does he want to, but he knows that once he gets Harry into bed he intends to keep him there for a long time.
“Just Harry is fine, please. And yeah, we went to school together,” Harry pauses, wondering how much he should reveal about his relationship with Draco, “We - we were actually pretty close before he moved to New York.”
Kissing Draco is like the sun rising in the morning and setting in the evening. Like flowers blooming in spring and snow falling in winter. It’s inevitably. It was always leading here, to this—Draco’s soft lips moving firmly against his own. Hands grasping and pulling, holding each other impossibly close.
He turns and grabs a handful of owl treats from the jar sitting by the sink, offering them to Orion with a tender smile.
They move over to the blankets, never breaking the kiss. Harry lets himself be pushed down, moaning when Draco’s body settles over his own, fitting against him perfectly. Draco’s eyes are half-lidded already, brighter than the candles burning around them and sparking with desire.
Ron and Hermione have Rose, who at a year old is already a handful and commands most of their time. Neville, when he isn’t at Hogwarts teaching, helps Hannah run the Leaky. Dean and Seamus just adopted a little girl and moved out of the city. And Luna is Merlin knows where with Rolf, searching for some magical creature or another. Harry’s the only single one of the group and since he no longer has his job to keep him busy, he spends most of his time in an empty house or talking to a portrait.
Outside the thunder booms loud enough to rattle the bedroom windows and lightening flashes brightly against the backdrop of the inky black sky. He sits up quickly, kicking the covers to the foot of the bed and takes in a few deep breaths to calm his racing heart. He feels the body beside him stir, but he can’t look over. Not now when guilt and longing are swirling together in his stomach.
And then Potter says his name—like a plea. And whatever was left of Draco’s doubts disintegrate to dust.
But Potter grabs his wrist and halts the movement, “Don’t,” he says, an emotion Draco can’t quite discern flitting over his face, “I like you messy.”
“Yeah, me too. Draco, baby fuck,” Harry growls, finally releasing his hold to gather Draco closer, fucking up to meet Draco’s thrusts and hitting his prostate every time. Draco winds his hands around Harry’s neck, his cock rubbing against Harry’s stomach, and the friction is enough to push Draco over the edge. He comes hard with a curse and Harry’s name on his lips.
Fuck,” Malfoy moans, his head tipping back against Harry’s shoulder, perfectly baring his neck, and Harry doesn’t hesitate to wrap his hand around it once again.
“Fuck, you feel so good. Always feel so good inside me,” Draco whimpers, his hands coming to rest at Harry’s sides. Harry looks down to where Draco is holding tightly to him, his fingers curled possessively around Harry’s ribs, his nails biting into the sensitive skin there.
Instead of getting in line like he normally would, Harry walks to the table, pressing his lips together tightly to keep his laughter at bay.
When he’s settled back in bed, Harry closes his eyes, willing his brain to just give him a break and let him finally sleep. But instead he’s assaulted with a flood of images and whispered words. As clear as if he were looking into a pensieve, Harry sees every kiss, every touch, play out behind his closed eyelids. He sees Draco under him, on top of him, hears the broken way he would say Harry’s name, the way his face went slack with pleasure every time he came apart for Harry.
Harry also meets Astoria, who he instantly likes. Many evenings find the two of them chatting over coffee or playing with Scorp while Malfoy brews some of the more delicate potions.
Harry plants his feet against the bed and snaps his hips up, driving his cock as deep into Draco as he can. He’s so close, can feel it, tingling at the base of his spine, the pleasure coiling tightly there. Draco sobs out something that might be Harry’s name and comes, coating both their stomachs. Harry goes breathless at the sight, at the way Draco tightens around him, and then he’s coming too, his whole body shaking with the force of it.
Draco crosses the room in three long strides, coming to a stop in front of Harry, his face softening in a way Harry thought he’d never see again.
“Regardless, you can skip the shovel talk. I have no intention of hurting him,” Draco promises and he almost thinks she believes him.
“I can’t tell him how I feel. I just can’t…” Draco trails off and blows out a breath, “I think. I think that I’ve wanted him since we were kids and now—“ Draco shrugs helplessly, unable to explain his complicated feelings.
Potter swears and rears back, his eyes gone dilated and wide. Draco can only watch, mesmerized, as the blood swells to the surface and drips down Potter’s chin. Draco slowly lifts two fingers, pressing them against the broken flesh, and he can’t stop the whimper that escapes him as Potter slowly sucks his fingers inside.
Why does Potter keep doing this? Why can’t he just leave things the way they are? He’s treating Draco like he’s someone special, someone he cares about, when in reality, Draco is just someone that Potter likes to fuck. And these stupid, nice things that Potter keeps doing are confusing everything, skewing the boundaries of this—Draco refuses to call it a relationship—
They spend a lot of time together, that’s true, but there’s usually someone else there, whether it be the patrons at the coffee shop or a combination of the boys and Astoria. Something about the whole thing seems significant to Harry and he worries that inviting Malfoy over for dinner on a notoriously romantic day, might’ve been the wrong thing to do.
“You can cook. I’ve seen you cook,” Harry states, beginning to dice the onion and firmly ignoring how much he wants to wrap Malfoy up in his arms and never let go.
Harry Potter. They are not in a relationship, they’re not even friends. They have sex—very, very good sex—but that’s all it is.
Harry doesn’t miss a beat, standing to lay Draco out on the table, and starts to pound into him. Only one, two, three hard thrusts—and then he’s coming too.
“I’m going to take Scorpius to visit my parents this weekend. I’ll make sure the wards are open to you before I leave. You come over to the Manor and tell him how you feel.
“I know,” Malfoy soothes, his voice still raspy but comforting in a way that makes another whimper fall from Harry’s mouth.
“Wow,” Harry breaths out, immediately stepping forward and placing a chaste kiss to Draco’s lips, “You look—just. Wow.”
He lets his thoughts wander, picturing what kind of life he and Draco could build together, a whole future unfolding behind his eyes.
He goes limp, eyes drifting shut once more. Harry presses soft kisses against his face, his voice warm and brimming with praise as he whispers words that Draco can’t quite comprehend.
That thought, along with the wind whipping around him, makes a shiver shoot down his spine. With every step forward he feels more and more uneasy.
Harry paces the length of his kitchen anxiously, the floor cold against his bare feet as he waits for Orion to return. He’s been up half the night trying to compose that short letter to Draco. His table is covered in scrunched up parchment and two quills lay broken, ink splatters staining the worn wood. After snapping the second one, Harry gave up and got a Muggle biro to use instead.
He closes his eyes and tries to breathe, but all he can picture is Astoria Greengrass, with her slim arms wrapped around Draco.
His plate is piled high with a delicious selection of food. Scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fresh fruit. Draco’s mouth waters as he picks up his fork and tucks in.
Harry’s thoughts of the summer before his third year—when he sat at one of these very tables and ate free sundaes nearly everyday—are interrupted, as a boy with sandy brown hair and a nervous smile walks up to them.
“I have no ulterior motives. We’re friends, our sons are friends,” Draco snaps angrily, “I’m not trying to
“If only it were that easy,” Harry finally says with a sigh, aware of how unreal it is to be having this conversation with Malfoy of all people.
“I can’t cook, Potter. You know this,” Malfoy insists, removing his shoes and tucking them in the corner out of the way.
“Yeah but I was the better stalker,” Potter quips, a grin stretching his lips and Draco’s heart stutters when the action causes the small dimple on Potter’s left cheek to pop out.
When the house elves bring out the huge cake, everyone sings Happy Birthday, and Draco dramatically blows out twenty nine candles before taking a bow.
Hermione laughs and stands. “Flattery will get you breakfast, if you feel like getting your lazy arse out of bed that is.”
Draco eyes his photo self critically, trying to see what Potter does. It doesn’t make sense that Potter, or anyone for that matter, would look at Draco like
It feels obscene, filthy, to be on display like this while Potter still sits there mostly clothed. But Draco stops worrying about that when he feels Potter’s tongue lick a broad stroke over his arsehole.
They stay on the observation deck for a long time, kissing and laughing. Up there, so high above the city, it’s like they’re in their own private world. But a small part of Draco worries about just what will happen when they finally come back down to reality.
Draco pushes it until the last second, finally starting his way down the long staircase after exactly five minutes and his breath hitches when his eyes land on Harry. He looks edible, the grey shirt he’s wearing clings unfairly to his chest and arms, tapering down to his slim waist. The jeans are tight, tucked into black boots, and Draco can imagine what his arse looks like in them.
Finally, unable to wait any longer, Harry covers Draco’s lips with his own. It’s warm and wet and amazing, and Harry never wants to stop.
Instead of answering, Harry stands from the table and lifts his t-shirt. Draco gasps when he sees Harry’s left side. Three claw marks, vivid red, start at his hip and run the whole way up to just below his armpit. Draco brings a hand up to cover his mouth as Harry turns and reveals the bite mark on his back. Draco stares. He wants to demand answers, he wants to say so many things but he has no words.
Draco’s back hits the castle wall with a thud as a wand is shoved against the vulnerable flesh of his throat. He swallows hard and tries to hide his wince, still not quite recovered from the last time this happened.
Harry’s warm, spooned behind him. One of his arms is wound possessively around Draco’s waist and the other is above their heads, resting lightly in Draco’s hair. He’s snoring softly, warm puffs of breath tickling the back of Draco’s neck.
“Just shut up and go get me my coffee,” Malfoy says as he picks up the metal napkin dispenser from the table, eyeing his reflection and trying to hide his smile.
“I still owe you an apology and an explanation,” Draco speaks quietly, his fingers still moving through Harry’s hair, “I won’t make excuses for what I did, for the way I left. That night..” His words trail off as he thinks back to that rainy night five years ago.
Eyeing the Muggles walking past, Draco still feels a little overdressed in the blue flannel shirt and dark wash jeans he had pilfered from Harry’s wardrobe. After Harry saw him in the ensemble, he had backed Draco up against his bedroom door, running calloused fingers through his hair and kissing the breath from his lungs.
Harry doesn’t think he’s ever been more sure of anything in his entire life, “Yeah, I’m sure. Please.”
Draco feels trapped in Harry’s gaze. Those green eyes, earnest and full of heat, have him frozen to the spot as Harry stares at him.
Draco is only able to let out a sigh of relief before Harry’s lips are on his, the kiss more sweet and gentle than any they’ve ever shared before.
The humid air hits him in the face when he steps outside and he’s completely unprepared to be grabbed by Harry and pushed against the wall of the pub. All the oxygen is punched from his lungs and his pulse starts thudding loudly in his ears. He vaguely registers his shirt catching on the brick, probably snagging, but Draco doesn’t even care. Not with Harry standing up on his tip toes to kiss at his neck.
Draco rolls his eyes, “Fine, Potter. Just get on with it. I have potions to get back to,” he says snidely, but Harry won’t let himself be intimidated.
Draco should refuse. He should say no, tell Potter to fuck off, get his clothes and leave. But he can already feel the anger seeping from his body and being replaced with a fuzzy sort of calm. So he walks over to the table, stopping just inches from where Potter still sits, turned sideways in his chair.
When they finally pull back, the smile that stretches Draco’s kiss-reddened lips nearly brings him to his knees.
Potter’s fingers are like hot brands where they grab at him, right where his thighs meet his arse. Draco sucks in a sharp breath when they dig in hard enough to leave bruises.
“Since you asked so nicely,” Malfoy drawls casually, his deft fingers popping the button on Harry’s jeans, “Lift up.”
Draco sucks gently until Harry’s hands drop from his head and then he sits back on his heels and gives Harry a smug smile.
“So I didn’t stop over just to mooch dinner from you,” Ron sits his spoon in his empty bowl and gives Harry an expectant look.
He doesn’t stop, lips and teeth moving down and over one arse cheek and then the other. His hands clutch at Harry’s hips hard—fingers digging in, nails scrapping skin. Then, without warning, Draco spreads Harry apart and licks him firmly from balls to tailbone.
“Shirt off,” Malfoy says, his voice raspy and commanding. Goosebumps break out on Harry’s arms. He’ll do anything Malfoy wants.
He’s starting to hate mornings. He hates that time in between sleep and wakefulness, hates how suddenly reality filters in and everything comes rushing back. Hates how it suffocates him.
When he steps under the spray of hot water, he feels some of the tension melt away. His shoulders relax and for the first time since waking up, he feels like he can breathe.
With another sharp flick of his wand, the dishes from his abandoned breakfast fly across the room and smash into the wall. The cupboards swing open and then slam closed a second later in a series of loud bangs. His raging magic flows out of the room and through his flat; bookcases are knocked over, picture frames fall to the floor and the lights flicker wildly. Anger pulses through his body in violent waves, but underneath he can feel his heart breaking.
Harry takes a step forward, reaching out. “No, Draco wait. Please just—“ his words cut off and a tormented sound breaks free from his lips, because Draco’s spinning away, leaving nothing behind but a burst of magic and a loud crack ringing in the air.
“Roll over then,” Draco says, his tone going just the slightest bit commanding. Harry shivers and quickly flips onto his stomach, resting his forehead on his folded arms.
When Draco woke up this morning he never imagined that his day would turn out this way. But he’s so happy it did.
He and Harry had fought. Screaming at one another until their voices were raw. The Prophet had run a particularly nasty article that day.
Harry thrusts hard and deep - once, twice, three times before he’s moaning Draco’s name and following him over the edge, wet heat filling Draco’s body.
Draco is so tight and wet and warm, and Harry loses himself to it. Pushes in and in with rough snaps of his hips, greedily swallowing every whimper, every whine and moan of pleasure that leaves Draco’s kiss swollen lips.
“Fuck, yes. Anything Harry, whatever you want,” Draco swallows and meets Harry’s eyes, “Just go slow. It’s been awhile.”
“But dad,” James whines. In the next moment Albus apparently decides it will be a great idea to crawl underneath the wall that’s separating him from his best friend. Harry grabs him by his ankle and shouts an apology over to Draco.
“Right,” Draco inwardly groans. It isn’t that he doesn’t like Kade’s brother, he does. Aaron’s a riot and always has Draco laughing to the point of tears. But it’s been a long week already and it’s only Wednesday. Draco just wants to come home after work and curl up with a good book, “What time is that again?”
“I’m sorry,” he apologizes quietly, knowing that those two words aren’t nearly enough to make up for all he’s done.
Draco whimpers again and Harry loses all restraint. With a growl he grabs the bottom of Draco’s shirt, yanking it roughly over his head. Harry means to carry Draco to bed that very moment but he’s distracted by the brightly colored ink that decorates the pale skin of Draco’s arm.
Draco startles when an owl scratches at the kitchen window. It only takes a moment for Draco to recognize the eagle owl. It’s Orion, the owl he and Harry bought together after the war.
“I’m on my own tonight too,” Harry says, chewing on his straw, “Gin has the boys. You know,” Harry pauses, wondering if he’s really about to ask Malfoy to spend Valentine’s Day with him, “You could come by. I was gonna make my famous chili.”
Harry can deal with a lot of things. But seeing Malfoy in causal Muggle clothes—he’s wearing jeans with rips in them for Merlin’s sake—his designer sunglasses perched on his straight nose, and his hair tousled from the light autumn breeze, is just not something Harry can handle.
When he voiced his concern, Malfoy assured him they wouldn’t have any trouble here and he was right. Merlin help him, Harry is already starting to trust Malfoy, at least in regards to the kids safety.
Draco knows pain. He knows what it feels like to have your chest sliced opened, knows how it feels to have your own father
Harry jumped up from the sofa when he saw Draco step through the fireplace, his eyes wide with shock and something else Draco thinks might be hope. But he’s made no move further, still just standing there, arms dangling at his sides, staring at Draco.
“Add another,” he says, his voice scratchy and rough, “Spread them apart,” he makes a scissoring motion with his own fingers to demonstrate.
Back in the living room, Harry leans his shoulder against the door frame and watches as Malfoy moves his wand in delicate flicks, gathering up their leftovers and banishing the trash that has been discarded on the floor.
Potter offers his hand and Draco takes it without thought. But instead of a simple handshake, Potter tugs Draco forward, bringing his other arm up and clapping Draco on the back. An almost hug, Draco thinks, standing stock still, unable to make his muscles move to either return the gesture or extract himself from it.
But does Draco want to marry Kade? Sure he cares for him deeply, loves him even. But no matter how many years pass, putting the war, and Harry, behind him, Draco’s still broken. He’s still fighting everyday to let go of the mistakes of his past.
in a broken whisper, that Harry finally adds another finger. Draco is so tight around him, his body pulling Harry in deeper and deeper with each thrust of his fingers. He rubs over Draco’s prostate, making him cry out and arch up from the bed. There’s a sheen of sweat covering Draco’s body, his mouth parted in pleasure, grey eyes sparking bright. And Harry has to be inside him, now.
“You best not,” she warns again but her tone is friendlier now, “Anyways, I didn’t come over here just to threaten you. I have a proposition, in regards to your—situation with the press.”
“Why do you think you’re not good for him? You’re still the same person Harry,” Remus gives him a stern look, already knowing Harry'll object to what he’s saying, “You are the same person and I know you would never hurt him. How many times have I told you that you can’t let what happened define you. Don’t make my mistakes. If he’s what you want, if he’s who you love, then don’t give up.”
. He’s not sure if it’s something that was instantaneous, or if it happened slowly over time. He supposes it really doesn’t matter.
, a voice that sounds an awful lot like Hermione says, the words echoing in his mind. It really wouldn’t do to have a panic attack right now. He just needs to get up to the castle and everything will be fine.
Ron and Neville exchange a look before slowly loosening their death grip. And without another word to anyone, Harry turns on the spot and Dissapparates with an angry crack.
Not much has changed between them since they graduated and left the halls of Hogwarts behind. They still fight and they still fuck. Malfoy still brings about complicated desires that Harry’s not sure what to do with.
Once Potter seems satisfied that Draco won’t fall over, his hands are gone, quickly undoing his jeans, popping the button and lowering the zip with sure fingers. Then he’s pulling out his cock. It’s long and hard, and already flushed red. The tip is wet, clear fluid gathered there and Draco wants to sink back to his knees. Wants to lick it up with his tongue. But Potter swipes it away with his thumb, smearing the slickness around.
“Potter,” Malfoy says, his tone clipped but polite, “I apologize. I certainly didn’t mean you any harm.”
Harry and Malfoy sitting with their bodies flush against one another, some raunchy comedy George suggested playing on the telly. Shoulders, arms and thighs all touching. Every time Malfoy takes a breath in, Harry can feel his rib cage expand.
They rock against each other, the pace turning frantic and desperate. Draco pins Harry to the wall, catches a wrist in each hand and chases that delicious friction until he’s crazy with it, until Draco’s about to come in his pants like a fucking teenager and he doesn’t even care.
. Get your fucking legs around me,” Potter demands, and Draco lets Potter hoist him up, hooks his long legs tightly around Potter’s waist, winds his arms around Potter’s neck.
“Hi Harry,” Astoria greets, shaking her head a little, “I apologize about him. I tried to reign him in but he’s always been terrible at handling his alcohol.”
When Draco steps out of the fireplace he expects to find Potter sprawled on the sofa, wearing joggers and a ratty shirt, and looking too good because of it. But the living room is empty.
“I seem to recall you always dancing with me at these parties,” she says, hands on her hips, the firelight catching on the gold bangles on her wrist.
breathe, though. His lungs have taken an impromptu holiday, leaving him to suffocate, silent and frozen.
“If I do something you don’t like—or if you change your mind, at any point, all you have to do is say stop. And I’ll stop,” Draco says with such conviction that any nervousness Harry feels starts to fade away to nothing.
“More,” Draco manages to gasp and Harry quickly complies, pulling back to mouth at Draco’s lower back as he shoves back in with two fingers. Harry takes his time opening Draco up, scissoring his fingers, twisting them slowly, in and out.
They share dessert, a huge sundae that’s absolutely smothered in chocolate syrup, ultimately having a bit of a sword fight with their spoons as they both scramble to get the last bite.
Then, later that evening, they’re in the sitting room. His mother and Astoria have magazines and photographs spread over the coffee table, the witches and wizards in them happy and celebrating on their wedding days. He’s been zoned out of the conversation for a while now, but he thinks they’re talking about seating arrangements. Draco is here, a silent bystander, while a life he doesn’t want is planned around him.
Just as she opens her mouth to reply, the young waitress approaches the table and asks Hermione what she would like. She orders a cup of Earl Grey with lemon on the side and Draco smiles, glad that some things haven’t changed.
Potter waits by the Floo while Draco takes Scorpius to his classroom. Draco uses the walk down the hall as an opportunity to clear his mind and take a few deep breaths.
What follows is not just sex and it’s certainly not fucking. Everything is soft and intimate in a way that Harry had once been convinced they could never have. It’s slow and tender and
When he finally comes down from the rush of his orgasm, Draco goes limp, leaning all his weight back against Harry, still whining quietly as shivers wrack his body. Harry releases his throat, pressing his lips softly against the bruises there, tasting the beat of Draco’s pulse.
Draco doesn’t protest, his only response a jerky nod. Harry releases him and unlocks the door, not bothering to check if Draco is following. Harry knows he will.
“Jesus fucking Christ. Look at you, you’re so good,” Harry praises, as Draco fucks down and buries his fingers deep.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispers, grinding back. He sounds so good like this, his voice rough and low. Breathless. And that’s when Harry’s restraint snaps.
“Harry, you know I can’t do that. This is something you need to figure out on your own. But let me ask you this, what do you want?”
,” Draco says, his voice cracking and his hands shaking as he pulls Harry flush against his chest, wrapping strong arms around him.
Instead, he quickly drops Malfoy’s hand and rubs at the back of his neck to keep his traitorous fingers occupied.
Harry chokes on his drink. He coughs, splutters. Beer drips down his chin and he hastily wipes at his mouth. When he’s able to drag some air into his lungs again he rasps, “I didn’t invite him.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answers with a sigh and a sad smile, “But we have each other now. That’s what matters, right?”
Malfoy stays at Harry’s house until late, not Flooing home until well after midnight. Harry trudges up the stairs to his bedroom, quickly stripping out of his clothes and crashing into bed.
Draco can only swallow and force his legs into motion as Potter steps away from the wall towards them.
He yanks his own shirt off, then pulls Draco away from the door and lifts him up. As he walks, Harry leans down and sucks a nipple into his mouth, making Draco cry out and arch against him.
“I love you too,” Draco whispers, afraid to say the words too loudly and shatter this overwhelming feeling of contentment he’s currently floating along in.
“I signed the papers because I want you to be happy. That’s all I ever wanted,” Harry says, walking back over and staring down at the table.
Potter starts up a punishing rhythm, pounding into Draco, each hard thrust shoving his body forward against the unforgiving wood beneath him. Potter’s hands squeeze at his hips, fingers digging in and pulling Draco back against him.
Satisfaction almost overwhelms Harry at Draco’s words and he can’t do anything but crash their lips together again, pouring all the love he has for Draco into the kiss. Harry wants to say the words, but he’s worried it’s too soon. And really all Draco has to do is look around, Harry’s feelings are painfully obvious.
Draco hurt him, he knows, and suddenly all he can hear is the sound Harry made as he apparated away. It fills his ears, playing on a loop, over and over again.
The press had been harassing them even before they officially got together, furious that Harry spoke at his trial and befriended him after the war. It only became worse once they came out as a couple.
Well, not get him back exactly, because as much as Harry wants it, Draco was never his to begin with. He has no claim on Draco, no matter how badly he wishes things were different.
Harry, who had quite literally saved the world, deserved respect and support, not Rita Skeeter writing article after article debating his mental stability or speculating on what nefarious deeds the two of them got up too.
“Not much to be honest,” Draco takes a sip of his tea, almost groaning. No one makes a cup of tea quite like Harry.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Draco walks to the fireplace and throws in a pinch of Floo powder.
“We’re nice to each other sometimes. Anyways, come to dinner, don’t come to dinner. Doesn’t make any difference to me, Malfoy.”
His arms give out and he collapses down on top of Draco, and they stay there, neither willing to move for a long time.
“Now see, there’s the problem. You have to communicate. No, no listen,” Ron says, when Harry opens his mouth to protest, “Tell him, plain and simple, how you feel. And then if he still says it’s over, at least you’ll know he made that decision with all the facts.”
As he watches the storm light up the sky, he wishes, just for a moment, that he’s looking out onto Grimmuald Place instead. It’s nothing new, really. Draco is no stranger to this feeling of homesickness. It’s been five years now since he left England and he still misses it terribly at times. But Draco has a great life here in New York. He’s made something of himself, something he’s proud of.
“This is amazing,” he blurts out, “God, I love chocolate,” Draco says, letting his eyes drift closed as he takes another delectable bite.
Draco clings to him, arms around Harry’s neck and fingers tangled in his hair, holding their bodies as close together as he can. Like he’s worried Harry will disappear.
Potter sent him dessert. No. Potter sent him his favourite dessert. Draco didn’t show up to dinner and Potter still sent him something to eat. Evil owl aside, it’s a sweet gesture. And one that complicates everything. It also makes Draco’s blood boil.
What a sad excuse of a Gryffindor he is. Standing here frozen like a terrified first year. It’s honestly a bit pathetic, and Harry’s glad no one’s around to see him flounder.
It isn’t uncommon for Harry to have nightmares, more so now that he sleeps alone in his big bed, but tonight there are no nightmares, only vivid dreams. The kind of dreams where you’re aware you’re dreaming but go along with it anyway.
They both look up as Harry and Draco approach and much to Harry’s dismay, Kade shoots up out of his seat, pulling Draco tightly to his chest.
Harry follows the elf out of the room and down the long hallway, ignoring the whispers of the many portraits that line the walls.
Harry laughs softly. “No. You don’t snore.” Harry rolls them so that’s he’s hovering above Draco, looking down at him with bright green eyes and a small smile. “But you do talk.”
Draco shivers at the command and stretches out on his back. He lets his legs dangle off the edge, the wood desk hard and uncomfortable beneath him. Potter steps closer, roughly parting Draco’s legs and sucking his cock down without preamble.
“Mine,” Harry’s eyes blaze possessively as he brings their lips together and slowly presses inside Draco’s body.
“Right,” Draco replies, relief and anxiety battle for space inside his chest but he gives Harry a small smile and leans forwards, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck, “I love you so fucking much.”
He knows he could keep going, could keep fucking into the tight heat of Draco's body until he comes. It wouldn't take long. But that was intense and Draco is sure to be over-sensitive and sore. So Harry gently pulls out, ignoring the noises of protest.
Harry takes a deep breath and finally steps into the sitting room, taking in the silver decorations as his eyes scan the room for Draco.
“Are you sure we have to go?” Draco asks, arousal starting to course through his body, “We could just stay here and I can undress you with my teeth.”
Ron gives his shoulder one last squeeze before he makes his way over to the Floo and disappears into the flames.
Harry looks equally affected and only gives a shaky nod in response. He brings their lips together again as he lines his cock up and breaches Draco’s willing body. Draco lets the feeling of being stretched wide around Harry’s cock overwhelm him, finally floating away completely as the world narrows down to just the two of them.
“Your wish is my command Potter,” Blaise says, pulling a small magical camera from his pocket and brandishing it proudly, “I’ll owl you copies.”
Please forgive me for my over use of commas as well as any other mistakes. This is very much unbeta’d and a work in progress. At the moment I have 8 chapters ready to go and I’m planning (fingers crossed) on trying to post one chapter a week but no promises.
“Nothing,” she says, bringing a hand up to twist in her hair, something Harry knows means she has something to say but is unsure if she should.
“I’ve seen the way you two are together,” Astoria continues, completely ignoring Draco’s last statement, “You’re practically dating already.”
The words of protest die on his tongue, a strangled noise escaping him as his mouth drops open in shock. Kade is down on one knee holding out a platinum ring, the inlay of diamonds and alexandrite gemstones gleaming in the moonlight.
Once he’s back at his flat, he spends a few very long hours cleaning up the mess left from the previous day. He sweeps up the broken dishes and scrubs the now dried coffee from the floor. He rights the upturned bookshelves, mends the picture frames and rehangs them, but he can’t bring himself to change the sheets while Draco’s scent still lingers there.
Hermione eyes widen, either from the unusual occurrence of Draco Malfoy apologizing or from his drunken slip of Harry’s nickname for her. They dance in silence for a moment before Hermione speaks again.
“Can you keep an eye on the boys for a few minutes?” Harry asks, already picking up his empty mug and shuffling his feet in the direction of the kitchen. He could just ask Kreacher to get him his coffee but Harry needs a minute without the noise and squeals assaulting his eardrums.
“What! You have to come Harry. It’s the end of summer bonfire! Anyway, it’ll do you good to get out of this house and stop worrying about everything.”
Molly retreats back inside and they’re left standing there alone. A tense silence hangs in the air between them and Harry shifts from foot to foot.
Once again, Harry feels the desire to reach out and hold onto Malfoy swell up inside him. It’s like he has been floating along through life, struggling to stay above water and Malfoy is the lifeline he’s been waiting for.
“Harry, it’s so good to see you,” Astoria says, standing and crossing the room to pull him into a hug.
It’s my birthday, I can do what I want,” Harry argues. The hand that was resting between them on the bench creeps up onto Draco’s thigh, squeezing and rubbing teasingly, and Draco’s resolve starts to crumble, with just that one touch.
“No, I. I don’t know what you mean, there’s nothing bothering me.” He knows that Harry talks to Andromeda, so she probably has a very good idea of what happened between them. But Draco doesn’t want to talk about it. He came here for an escape.
A number of emotions play over Harry’s face. Shock, betrayal, heartache. But rage is what dominates his features.
“Maybe,” Hermione says after a moment, the look on her face saying that she’s thinking, plotting, “Listen, we can figure this out later. Draco’s birthday is tomorrow Harry.”
Kade steps closer again and places a kiss against Draco’s forehead, his lips lingering there as his fingers tangle in Draco’s long hair.
There are no boundaries, no line drawn in the sand. When you love someone you give them everything. You put the most important parts of yourself in their hands, only able to hope that they’ll treat them with care, and when you stumble and inevitably fall, that they’ll catch you.
