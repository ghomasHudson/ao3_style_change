“Look, Pot-Harry, we had a delightful night. Really, we did. But that’s all it was…. Fucking hell! What the fuck was that?” A loud tapping on the window startles me and I whirl around.
“Malfoy?” I breathe out the name, unable to believe that thousands of miles away, in Muggle Boston, we’d meet again after a decade.
Grunts of exertion and steady squelches filled the room. Sweat dripped from one body to another. Skin slapped rhythmically against skin.
The covers were older and worn. Draco noticed the same spiky handwriting throughout one as he quickly flipped through it—a diary then. As he thumbed the pages, he read a few sentences here and there when the acronym “VILE” appeared. Whoever the original owner was, they were either well-informed or involved.
not proof enough? Fucking Salazar, Harry. I need you. Now.”
It’s ludicrous for me to consider dyeing my hair considering I haven’t even changed my haircut since Hogwarts. I don’t do well with change.
“What fun is it without codenames? I’m Pascal and you’re Little Dragon. Or would you prefer Little D?”
“It’s not...”
But the way he carries himself, the nervous way he taps the fingers of his left hand against his leg, the wrinkling of his brow when he’s frustrated or confused… none of that has changed.
Hermione was automatically co-opted into the group after she returned from completing a doctoral program at a Muggle university in America. Her focus was genetics, and she had been highly sought after by the Ministry to transfer her skills to study lycanthropy, Squib births, and rare diseases. Draco didn't understand most of her words when they discussed her work.
“Yes… I…. Malfoy, what are you doing at a muggle university?”
“Yes.”
He wasn’t sure what reaction to have. Frustrated? Hopeful? Hermione clearly attempted to disguise the real purpose of her letter. Surely she wouldn’t put in the trouble if she wasn’t considering his cause? He remembered how he had mocked her back in second year (or was it third?) when she had become an activist for house-elves. Now his future rested on her taking up his cause.
Harry nodded and added, “We still don’t know a lot about the magic the man in the red hat uses. We can’t figure out the spell to show the protection charms, or his invisibility, or how he gets in and out without being traced. The other intruders were skilled with stealth, but not as magically advanced.”
He wished he could talk to Hermione. While he loved Ron, he was less objective when it came to Malfoy. Hermione would be impartial and help him formulate questions to dig out the truth in Malfoy’s words.
“Harry,” Neville started, surprising Harry with his initiative, “given that Draco and Blaise haven’t been arrested yet, I’m assuming you’re thinking things over. Yeah?”
Out of sight of the librarian, he pulls me to him in the middle of a landing. His thumb brushes along my chin to my lips, tracing lightly, awakening every nerve ending.
I dim the lights again.
“I am,” Draco answered.
I tell him that Daddy’s just... lost.  It’s a true statement because I will do whatever it takes to get my husband to see sense and come home.
After an hour more, Pedro had to return to his office, so he gave recommendations for tourist sights and nightlife.
It doesn’t matter that I’ve dated multiple men since then, I just can’t get over how Harry Potter was once just as infatuated with me as I’d been with him.
Dad has caught up to us, and he lets me crawl onto his back, so Daddy doesn’t have to bend to see me easily.  I tell him all the things that he missed.“Daddy, we missed you
When they arrived at the Burrow, they were the last couple to arrive. All the Weasley children had come to visit, and those with children had brought their own children, so the home was lively. He wasn’t sure if he would ever get used to the chaos, but one look at Harry, and he knew Harry felt at home.
He sat in his usual armchair in the library at Grimmauld Place with Hermione on the floor by his feet. Her hair was held up in an impromptu bun secured with a Muggle pen. She always used pens for their ease and efficiency when she had to take notes quickly. Blaise and Malfoy had never written with them before and would often absentmindedly reach out to try to dip the nib in an inkwell.
He’d asked, “Have you considered Quidditch? We’ve got tryouts coming up soon at Puddlemere, and our first-string Seeker just retired.”
Draco couldn’t believe it was already Christmas.
“We went ice skating on our first date. We both knew we’d enjoy it so it was relaxing, and we both got to lean into our competitive sides and show off.”
Harry stopped pacing the small hotel room to grab a glass and looked through the minibar for Firewhiskey. He needed a drink to sort out his thoughts as he obsessively mentally reviewed and catalogued Malfoy’s facial expressions and words. He took a swig, and it burned.
pathetic. At least it was only going to be Hermione. He had no interest in getting in
Draco’s eyes drifted shut, savouring the moment and mind floating halfway between sleep and contentment. They were quiet for a while, catching their breath.
She set down a small, beaded bag on her lap, pulled out some books, and restored them to their full size.
Malfoy blows out a breath, clearly sensing the hesitation. “Potter… let’s just talk about what you want. No ink today.”
Harry took the opportunity to tap Malfoy’s shoulder, feeling the Warming Charms that were woven into the fabric of the blond’s robes.
I relish the warmth of his mouth and the variety of licks, nips, and touches that put just the right amount of pressure on the shaft.  I come quickly.
is over if you’d like a break,” Draco offered, bringing Harry back to where they’d met.
Home. He had heard stories of people associating the word with freshly baked biscuits or warm hugs. He, however, associated it with the smell of his mother’s roses and quiet. Most of the portraits in Malfoy Manor preferred to reside in the frames that hung in the family portrait gallery, having each other for company instead of waiting hours to see if any of the three living family members would walk by.
“Fleur talked about going for months. I can’t believe you seriously invited a modern-day Picasso to teach us. I’m not even sure if I’m holding a paintbrush properly!” Harry hissed.
Unfortunately for Draco, that job entailed trying to arrest him.
A blond brow arches at the obvious lie, even though Draco would have been able to see through him anyway. He’s always been able to. But today he doesn’t push it.
Harry is too good — I used to resent him until I learned that he really is just maddeningly noble.  He helped me navigate the trials after the war, vouched for me, and extended an offer of friendship.  He even chose a profession to keep others safe and has risen through the ranks to become Head Auror.
He intentionally brought his face a hair closer to Harry’s and flicked his eyes down to the auror’s mouth. Draco watched, hungrily, as the man reflexively licked his lips, and the blond brushed his hand over Harry’s arm. It was the lightest of touches through layers of fabric, but the warmth surprised him.
“Let me get this straight: it just…
The Weasleys are leaving, so I’m out of time to rewrite the letter.  I fold it and put it inside my bedside table with my travel bag.
They entered and asked a petite woman with riotous black curls, “Room for 2?”
He didn’t particularly enjoy nightclubs or what passed for “dancing” at one. As a child, like most pureblood families, his parents had insisted on dancing lessons. He was skilled at waltzes and ballroom styles, which required elegance and grace — grinding on your partner in a sweaty room while music blared? Not his thing.
Wanting to take care of Harry, Draco rolled over to hang off the bed and fish his wand from the pocket of his discarded trousers. “Let me clean you.”
Harry impatiently made the decision for him, pulling away from Draco’s fingers and stroking Draco’s cock below him... once... twice... thrice. Then Harry shifted, guiding the tip and letting it brush against his rim before he sank down on the length steadily, enveloping it with his body.
Then they were moving as Draco murmured instructions in his ear. The embrace wasn’t as close as some of the other couples, but still too close to look into Draco’s face.
“You look bloody fantastic in that outfit,” Harry complimented in a low voice as he gave him a once over. Draco’s doubts vanished. As his mother had taught him: as long as you were confident in your fashion choices, you’d pull off the look.
While he still saves the world on a daily basis, I sit at home to write stories and draw pictures.  I love my work, I really do, but it shows me the vast difference between us.  Most days, it doesn’t bother me, but today when I can’t even work from the migraine, I feel useless.
Draco glared back at the burly wizard. That wanker was intentionally provoking him. And to set up a date with Harry in front of him? What a fucking prick.
Tipsy and after wanking in the shower as surreptitiously as possible, he curled up only a few feet away from his half-naked crush. In bed.
Neville looked disappointed at the negative response. He knew Neville had been honest with him about Blaise and that he should be open too, but he wasn’t sure what he felt for Malfoy anymore. He might have dated some arseholes, but never wanted criminals.
He could not imagine Blaise’s reaction as a professional architect.
“I’ll pick yours, if you pick mine,” Harry suggested.
“Hey Longbo… sorry… Neville,” Draco greeted, catching himself on the name when Blaise’s eyes flashed with censure. The blond added a practised, charming smile, earning yet another warning.
“Did we get more info on the other unidentified men that entered the premises in Boston? They reached the room after the Salem Ring was stolen.”
He’s so close, he swears he can hear the blood rushing through his body as his heart pounds. He barely hears the request, “May I?”
Hermione nodded and stated simply, “He’s our bellwether.”
Draco’s mind was swirling. His chest tightened at the acute reminder of his godfather, who he remembered fondly despite learning after his death that he had never really known the man. Then there was his wonder and horror at Harry’s protectiveness and willingness to give up his career. It was shortsighted and risky.
“Er... that he needs time to himself.  We can’t just search everywhere and I want as few people to know about this as possible,” I explain.
“Can you hear me?”
Dancing brought back memories of the Yule Ball—mostly of tripping over his own feet. Those feet were now rooted in place in the hall entrance as Neville tried to coax him to come in.
Draco fought to keep his eyes open, relishing the sensations, but trying not to come from the erotic sight of Harry’s mouth and hand working in tandem. He lost the battle to Harry’s skilled mouth. He groaned and Harry ran a teasing finger over his bollocks.
Head Auror Robards had put him on the original case months ago when an artefact was stolen in London. The team had grown with time, but they were running out of leads to follow up on. Hope and motivation were waning. Their collective experience seemingly wasn’t enough.
This must be a nightmare.
This time actually
It’s relaxing. Comforting.
came to life with a burst of green, the church bells of the nearby Muggle church faintly rang seven times. He was grateful for her punctuality, which allowed him to pretend that he was engrossed in the book in his lap.
“This is a bar in a bookstore, so the drinking is covered. But who is to say the dancing and fucking are off the table?”
“Of course she would. So, what brings you to Boston?”
He remembered their last encounter at Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlour. He had fixated on how Malfoy had licked his cone, while Harry internally berated himself, unable to taste the pumpkin flavour he had ordered. Adding to his embarrassment, Hermione had noticed and tried to subtly and non-verbally ask if there was anything between them. Tactless, Ron didn’t get the hint to be subtle. Instead, he loudly asked who they were gesturing to, and that caught Malfoy’s attention.
He could have sworn that he recognised the platinum blond hair and lean torso that led to a narrow waist and firm arse. Harry wasn’t sure if he could identify any other arse in the world, but either way, the DMLE definitely didn’t accept identification-by-arse. Although Harry trusted his instinct, what were the chances they’d both be in Egypt at the same time? By the time he chose to follow the mystery man, it was too late.
“Fuck off,” Draco grumbled, even though he knew his friends were right, and he was pathetically pining for the perpetually late member of their group. “Look! I’m going to ask him out. Tonight. You know the new restaurant in Slater Alley? I got us a reservation.”
Harry’s words cut out. He slammed his lips onto Draco’s, teeth knocking together.
“Smith,” Draco repeated, trying to calm his racing heart. He’d been certain he was staring in the face of a dead man. James was the spitting image of Harry Potter. “You just . . . you look like someone I know.”
“I want the artefacts preserved, but it takes time to add extra protection spells. I’m planning on giving this back too,” Draco said and gestured vaguely towards the diadem, a priceless object left carelessly on the floor in the confusion.
“No,” Draco said. “Somebody probably left that here.”
Bellatrix nodded.
“Go,” he grunts, dropping his head back into the pillow, motioning to the door. “You’re going to find out soon enough.”
“It’s a lot.”
Then, giving Harry a smug smile, something that Harry hadn’t dared to hope for, he declares, “And I want a curry.”
Ron looks up from the bear and nods. “Yes! That.”
Potter walked in, flipped on the lights and started talking.
“Do you want to finish like this?” Harry asks.
opening his mouth so Draco could rub his tongue all over Harry’s.
“It’s not just that!” Emily crowed. “It’s a general store…” she trailed off and glared at Draco.
They snogged until Harry flinched.
Draco was suddenly rooted to the spot. He looked around the clearing and then back at Potter. Potter who was merely standing still, hands in his pockets, and a small smile on his face.
The children ran out the door and Draco could only sigh. “He’s much better behaved at home.”
The man in black shot off several hexes and crowded her into a corner. “I’ve never dueled anyone as good as you.” He waited until Hermione had nowhere to turn, but catching her expression frowned.“You’re backed in a corner,” he said. “Why are you smiling?”
“Rule number whatever!” Draco said. “No picking on Draco!”
“We need lube,” he declared, awkwardly reaching for his wand. “I’m not going to chafe my prick.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine.”
With a wrench, Voldie pulled Draco back down the aisle. “Get him to the Honeymoon Suite,” he hissed to his father. “I’ll be there shortly.”
Harry.
“Why are you here?” Draco finally asked.
“My belly will pooch out if I eat too much,” Harry says sullenly, already planning on wearing the tight shirt.
Ron leans back in satisfaction and winks at Harry. Then he lifts up his glass.
Hermione looked over at Ron. “I think finding him will be the least difficult thing we do today.”
Harry keeps his eyes closed and starts counting backwards from a hundred. He hits eighty-seven when Malfoy speaks again.
Then he ignores Harry and goes back to the movie. They’ve reached Giselle’s pampering montage when Harry hears Draco let out a little snore.
“That’s a lovely name,” his mother said on a yawn. “Now go to sleep.”
She slid into the booth beside Draco.
“Yes,” he answers, “but the biggest part of the plan involves us both being on the bed.”
She rushed down the stairs, barely registering that Ron was right on her heels. They both froze in horror as they saw the man in black’s body lying lifeless before them.
“Is there something on my face, Harry?” Draco asks. He grimaces in disgust. “I don’t like calling you Harry. Feels wrong.”
“Hi!” Harry said when he saw Draco. “I got you your favourite table.”
Bristling, Draco asked, “What do you mean by that?”
“Why are you staring behind us?” he asked, sneering.
thing?” Draco wondered aloud.
“I mean, you don’t...” Harry sighs. “It doesn’t have to be a thing.”
Harry keeps shoving cake in his mouth so he doesn’t have to answer and to hopefully distract Draco from the answering blush on Harry’s face. Draco lifts up his hand and gently wipes a spot under Harry’s lip, making Harry blush even harder.
Draco rolled over so he could see Harry’s face more clearly. "You're telling me that Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, got pegged in a Muggle sex club?"
“Why didn’t you tell me about that sooner!” Harry exclaimed. “And what I wouldn’t give for my old invisibility cloak.”
Peanut Butter lets out a little squeak of excitement and rubs his face back against Draco’s.
“Hurry!” Zacharias shouted as he disentangled himself from Ron. “Get out of the harness!” he yelled, looking at Hermione. “Cut the rope!”
“I just meant you looked nice,” Potter— but Draco decided that if Potter thought he looked
He took a moment to take Harry in, sans clothes. Harry, Draco decided, looked good in light, cool colours. His skin had looked amazing in his white shirt, but now, against the cool mint of the duvet, he looked like a bronzed statue. His black hair was a mess, spread across the pillow, his smile bright on his face, his arms were strong and more muscular than Draco had imagined. He had the tiniest hint of a stomach, just a little softness in the middle that made Draco want to kiss all over it. He had a trail of black hair that led to…
He sent Draco a sly smile and Draco couldn't keep back an answering smile.
It’s the first year at Platform 9 ¾ with the whole Potter/Weasley clan for Draco and Scorpius.
Harry flinched as Draco pulled his wand. “Relax, Potter,” he spit out. “I’m just going to run some diagnostic spells to see if you’re the reason it’s raining at my events.”
Draco’s flush has traveled from the tips of his ears to the hollow of his throat and Harry wants to see if he can make Draco blush even farther down.
“I don’t want to hear what you were up to with your latest paramour, but I will take some tea and a danish.”
“You’re in the minority then.” They reached the door and Draco paused. “Please.”
Black family tree back eight generations. I think you can remember my business partner’s name!”
of his wedding to Harry, it provides a stark contrast to his first wedding. His cheeks are red, and his eyes glow from happiness. He smiles as he watches Harry sweep him up into a kiss and then whisper something to his photograph self. He remembers
get along.”
Harry couldn’t keep back his fond laugh.
It couldn't have been too bad because Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth when Harry rubbed their tongues together. Draco rolled them so he was perched on top of Harry, balancing himself on his elbows. He leaned to the left and started kissing and nipping Harry’s neck. Harry let out a gasp at a particularly sharp bite and his hips rolled up into Draco’s.
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Potter said.
“Potter
Harry wakes when Draco gets off the couch. The DVD menu is repeating on the television, casting the room in a low, ever-changing light.
Harry groaned as Draco started finger fucking him again. The lube squelched obscenely and when Draco added a gentle twist that crossed his fingers, Harry let out a full body moan.
Half an hour later, the door opens as soon as Harry’s knocked.
“You called me last night,” Potter said.
“Moron,” she mouthed back. She smiled at Harry.
“Getting you naked,” Harry answers.
“Ugh,” Draco says.
WIth a fond smile, Draco lets himself be herded down the hall and into their room. “What if I want to be the one sniffing?” he asks.
“Right,” Draco said and winked at Harry.
gaining on us,” Ron interrupted from his perch at the front of the boat. “Even I can see it now.”
“Lovely to see you, Ha…”
"I'm still not a saint, Potter."
“Here ya go, Draco,” Stella said, setting his cup down. As expected it was the colour and texture of the Thames in autumn.
“I’m awake enough for shower sex,” Draco replies. “But only if you do most of the work.”
“Didn’t want to spoil my moment of triumph.”
“He’s just an option,” Hermione said. She walked to Harry and reached up to give him a quick kiss on the cheek. “If you’re happy alone, that’s one thing.”
and everything went black.
"Sorry, Bob!" Harry says, as he giggles and continues to ruin Draco's lie-in, moving so that he's leaning over Draco.
. “I guess I can try
But Draco is currently ignoring everything in the room, Harry included. It’s as if there’s a huge
“Arse,” Harry says, fondly, as he gets up and walks to the door. “Honestly, Draco, what’s got you so upset?”
Draco and Potter snort in unison, and then Potter glances at Draco with an odd look on his face.
“Please put anything you value away, Scorpius,” Draco says, gathering up all of his nice writing quills and fountain pens at his desk. “Mother, if you could hold it for a bit while we try to save our belongings, I would appreciate it.”
Turning back to his writing desk, Draco scribbles out,
“Ah,” Potter said.
Draco perked up at that. “That sounds amazing.”
“I still think you’re a pest,” he says softly to the niffler. “But thanks.”
Sparing one last look at the boat in the distance, Zacharias let out a snort. “Even if the person in the boat makes it to the cliff, there is no way he’ll be able to get to the top. Only my giant is strong enough to go up this way. He will have to circle around to find a safe harbour.” While he was talking, Ron had slung the harness around his waist and Hermione was struggling to get into hers. Zacharias pushed Draco towards Ronald and started to put a harness around him.
Nodding, the man in black said, “I thought it fitting with the foliage.”
“And you’re eating when we get to my flat.”
“You know what I meant.”
"Almost as smart as Hermione, isn’t he?" Ron had answered when Harry'd been so shocked.
Phoenix
“I hate you, Ron,” Harry hisses.
Nodding, Draco adds, “After we finish our drinks.” Then, he says, softly, “Thank you, Harry.”
“Enough, ‘Mione,” Harry grumbled. Then he looked at Draco and smiled. “I thought we could Apparate. The closest point is only a couple of blocks away and it’s not too cool yet to enjoy a walk.”
They sat in silence for half a minute before Harry got up. “Er, I need to use the loo. I’ll be back.”
“It was George!” Ron insisted, his ears red and his eyes big.
“What are these fantastic things?” Mr Weasley asked from the corner.
“I love you, and Astoria loved you, and neither she nor I would want you wallowing in guilt. However, suppressing your emotions is so much worse, so I suppose, wallow away.”
Hermione only looks at him with pity in her eyes. “We both know that, but it’s harder for him to reconcile what he did before the war with who he is now.” She pulls Harry into a hug. “Don’t give up on him,” she whispers.
“Be nicer,” Harry reprimands him.
"They did it the slow way, Harry." Draco's tone is almost pedantic and Harry would strangle him if he didn't currently have two long fingers inside of Harry's arse. "Not everybody is as impatient as you, you know."
“We think it’s one of Bellatrix’s,” he answers.
“Go back to the beginning,” she slurred. “That’s what Zach always said.” She drank from a flask and fired off a few Stinging Hexes. “I’m at the beginning!” she shouted. “What am I supposed to do now?”
After lunch, they made their way to the inn to see Emily.
everything! Every apology! Every speech to my family about their prejudices! Every time I walked out the door, I tried to do better than I had!”
Harry’s laugh is everything Draco had hoped it would be.
Harry nods.
“It’s half ten,” Draco pointed out.
Draco rolls his eyes then leans down to pull his trousers and pants off in one motion. Harry makes a sort-of dying caveman grunt when he sees Draco’s dick. It’s pink, like the tips of his ears and thick enough to be a mouthful.
“Weasley,” he says to Ron. “Harry.”
Draco fell into a chair at his table, feeling his heart break and losing himself in sobs. He swore to himself that he would never love again.
Harry’s not going to let himself overthink this. He’s finally had a decent conversation with Draco and he wants to have more of them in the future.
Potter and his merry little band of misfits have won the war. They took down the Dark Lord and Draco doesn’t know what his future holds. He and his family are on the losing side and Azkaban looks like a strong possibility. With a deep breath, Draco looks to his father, his face grey and withdrawn and then to his mother. She, at least, is standing upright and eyeing the ruins of the castle with a calculating gaze.
“Now that you’ve taken care of the six fingered woman, what do you plan on doing?” Harry asked, curious.
“Oh, please, Harry, you knew I was mouthy when you married me. Just because you’ve fucked my brains out doesn’t mean I’ll forget my extensive vocabulary for a prolonged period of time.”
Molly poked him in the side making him squeak.
“Love your husband as you love Wiltshire, and there will be peace and happiness,” the newly crowned King Voldie proclaimed. “Those were my father’s dying words.” He spread his arms wide and looked down at Draco with a soft smile. “I present to you, His Royal Highness, the High Prince of Wiltshire, Draco.”
There was a knock on the door.
Harry walks around the desk to pull Draco into a hug and hears Ron groan out
“Go on.”
What he had not anticipated was the line that was wrapped around Malfoy’s Menagerie.
nice. Draco had seen his fair share from his adventures on the continent. It was soft on his thigh, fat and uncut. It let out a little twitch as Draco kept staring at it.
“I like it when you’re too worked up to speak,” Harry admits as he pulls his finger out. “Two?” he asks casually.
“You’re full of shit.”
“After years with a Mind Healer,” other Draco interjects. “But Harry’s not wrong. Go to Luna,” he says again. “She’s more forgiving than you can imagine.”
“Hermione,” Ron bellowed, seemingly not caring that his son was eating wild plants. “Harry said he thinks Malfoy’s fit!”
“Apparently,” Draco said when they finally settled down, “the last sign looked like the founder of the Hamlet was fucking his sister up the arse.”
“With pleasure,” Harry replied and he held out his hand. “I’ll just take your wands and—”
thought about Malfoy again.
“You’re setting me up,” Harry says.
“Oh, don’t start feeling sorry for yourself.” Emily grabbed her phone and turned the telly off. “You know it’s a good idea, Draco.”
Harry walked to Mrs Weasley and said something. She nodded and then all of the Weasleys Disapparted away.
"Dear Merlin, you're in love with the ferret," Ron says, apropos of nothing, one sunny May morning.
“Reckoned I should get used to calling you Draco so things wouldn’t be weird for the boys if we ever got together.”
fucking Draco with them.
“Not helping, Draco,” Harry said, turning to look back at him.
Harry sips and grimaces. “Did you put any sugar in it?” he asks, already knowing the answer.
“You remember how we always hated Harry?” At Draco’s nod, other Draco continues. “Well, it turns out that the hatred was more-or-less the armour we built around our heart after he rejected us when we were First Years. But then there’s everything else, the war,
“I want to see the rest of the buildings when we get back,” Harry said.
“Why won’t my arms move?” Harry demanded.
“It felt good before,” Harry said. “I think it’s going to feel better with you instead of some Muggle woman.”
They stood in silence watching their families getting along, something Draco had never imagined.
Harry pauses and twists his fingers a little and Draco lets out a gasp. He pushes a little deeper as he twists his wrist, and the smooth slide from the lube combined with the way Harry’s moving his fingers has Draco rubbing himself against the sheets.
When Harry’s down to the last button, he noses at Draco’s cock, which has become fully hard with all of the kissing and biting. He doesn’t spend long, and Draco can’t keep back a disappointed sigh.
Hardly believing he was going on a date with
about leasing the building,” Draco said, finally sitting up.
“Harry Potter,” Draco said. He waved to the other people— he didn’t really remember who they all were— and walked up to his mother.
“No!” Draco says quickly. “I’m being a brat, don’t listen to me.”
Hermione had spelled the wheelbarrow to push Ron forward on its own and cast a Disillusionment charm on it. She had cast a Notice-Me-Not charm on Harry and herself and they were following close behind. Ron had a Glamour cast that made him look skeletal and dark. The guards looked nervous.
“You brought me to a fancy chippy,” he said, delighted.
“It’s our first Christmas at the Burrow,” Draco said. “Me and Scorpius don’t really fit in with all these—” he shuddered “ —gingers.”
“Fixed it,” Potter says, brandishing the Time-Turner awkwardly. He walks over to other Draco and pulls him from his chair and into an embrace.

Draco squeezed his eyes shut. It wasn’t that he was
“Hurry up!” Scorpius chirps as he runs out of their room. “Gran says I can order a quad espresso!”
“It’s a general store that’s also a very specific store,” he grumbled. “Most people won’t realise this, but I want to market Muggle goods to the Wizarding world as well. I want something that will help boost the economy of the Hamlet and Muggles have so many amazing things we don’t have.”
Malfoy nods, grimacing. “Yes, I’m sure she had more cursed items. I have no idea why this showed up so long after she died, but I’m going to let Robards know that everyone needs to be on the lookout for more.”
Harry looked down at the menu and avoided looking at Draco. “In my head, there’s Hogwarts Malfoy and now-Draco and they’re vastly different people.” He looked up at Draco, like he knew Draco was going to argue. “I know you’re the same person, you’re still an annoying git.”
“Truuuuuuuuuuue Loooooooooove,” he gasped.
Draco heard Ginny mutter
She walked to the door and put her shoes on and sent Draco a wink.
“It’s fine,” Harry whispered back. “Keep kissing me.”
“Owl me when you’re free and we’ll set up a belated birthday dinner,” Draco says as he gets up. “And let me know if the department finds any more creepy things.”
in his lap.
“Harry!” Ginny shouts. “Come see!”
Harry’s been to Draco’s office before, of course he has. Draco works directly with the Auror Department and Harry has consulted with him on several occasions. But he’s still taken aback by how
“Well that’s just because you’ve got one of those faces,” Draco said. But he did take a look around the town centre and he did see several people who were glaring at Potter.
Harry points at Ron, betrayed. “Mum!” he declares.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I can be discreet.”
Draco muttered, “You’ve said that already.”
“Must you?” Harry cut in.
Menagerie.”
"Still went rather well," Ron responds. "I'll make mains and you can make dessert? Win him over with your tarts."
, and let himself sit on the sofa.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine,” he conceded. “Scorpius is great. He and Rose seem to be getting on well together.”
you disgusting maggot of a man?” With a wry grin, Harry continued. “It could be that I can’t move my body after being tortured at your hands, you shit stain. I could be lacking strength, that is one theory, you miserable vomitous mass.” Harry started to get up and Draco scrambled out of the bed to stay out of his way.
fucking convenient,” Emily said as she got settled next to Draco on the bed. She wrapped herself in the dark purple blanket and sighed. “How did I live for so long without a friend who could boil water and make throws on command?”
“Are you mad at Charlie?” Harry asked.
“Oh it’s just that Harry likes ickle-Malfoy and now George owes me two Galleons,” Fred said, the
Draco looks over at Harry. “What?” he asks, still pink around the ears.
“Draco,” she said warmly. “You have a friend.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “It’s not as if it will make a big difference. It’s only going to take a few minutes with my non-dominant hand. It will be over in seconds if I—”
Ron walks back in, like he was waiting on Malfoy to leave. "That didn't go great, Harry."
He and David had dated for about a year before breaking it off. Harry'd pulled a few guys at clubs and gone on a few casual dates in the ensuing years, but nothing really took until Malfoy reentered his life, consulting full time with the Auror department. He still sang Muggle pop songs and had soft looking hair that curled at the ends and still wore white shirts that clung to his shoulders, but he'd matured over the ten years since the war had ended. And at some point over the last decade, Harry had fallen arse over tit for the git.
“That she is,” Draco agreed. He took a sip of his zhampagne. It was bitter but the raisin, somehow, gave it a hint of sweetness that clashed horribly with the rest of it. Putting down his flute, he made a face. “Refreshing,” he proclaimed.
“Thank you, Harry.”
“Life is pain, Prince. Anybody who tells you differently is selling something.” Black took a moment, seemingly deep in thought. “I think I remember your
“Why does it say ‘Harry loves Draco’ on it?” Luna wonders aloud.
While the man in black and Hermione had been dueling, Zacharias and Ron had been carrying Draco away from the cliffs. Zacharias kept looking behind them and after several minutes, saw the man in black running towards them. They were in a grassy area littered with rocks and boulders.
“Can I help?”
Neville threw his arm around Harry’s shoulder and laughed. “C’mon!” he said loudly, but kindly “The house elves are making hot chocolate.”
His face flushing, Harry rolls over to help Draco stand. “Uh, I haven’t had many people over lately,” he answers. He flops back on the bed and asks, “What time is it?”
Draco has already gotten into the shower by the time Harry’s finished undressing, and Harry follows him in, closing the glass door. He’s stood under one of the showerheads, and Harry watches as the water cascades down his body. Draco’s hair is the colour of spun gold and his skin is starting to pink up from the heat of the water and Harry isn’t sure how he managed to marry Draco, but he’s really glad he did.
All three of his children run to the door, scrambling to get there first.
“I like you too,” Harry said back.
Harry is gentle when he moves up to kiss Draco again, and Draco lets himself be consumed. There are bright spots of pain where Harry has sucked bruises into his neck and torso, but Harry’s warm and solid against Draco. After a few seconds, Harry moves down Draco again, this time focusing on his nipples.
This seems to be the catalyst for Draco. His whole body relaxes for the first time since they were called to the Ministry.
“Thanks for ordering us nibbles,” he says, then wants to bang his head on the table.
“I come by,” Potter said clutching at his chest, “and I’m mocked and ridiculed.”
Harry scoffed. “Did you consent to the marriage?” Draco looked at him in confusion. “Did you say ‘I do’?”
“Harry?” Draco asks.
“Ugh,” Harry says and rolls over.
, to return. He sent off several letters, but in the weeks that passed had not received any answer. Two weeks turned into a month, one month turned into two, and still Draco heard nothing from Harry.
. The door flew off its hinges. Nodding her thanks, Hermione hurried into the room.
“I thought,” he rubbed the back of his neck and let out a little laugh, “I might walk you home?”
He gets off the sofa and gathers up all the family photographs that line the mantel and takes them to his room. Draco has cleaned off his writing desk and scans the room for anything else that might catch the niffler’s eye.
“Oh,” Draco said. Then again, “Oh.”
He tips an invisible hat. “What brings you ‘ere today?”
“Harry, you’ve always been our friend and Malfoy, we used to hate you, but now it turns out you’re not so bad.” Malfoy lets out a little snort at that. “So I would like to make a little toast to our guests.”
Later, after Draco had packed up all of his equipment and made his way back to his flat, he wondered what had gone wrong. In all of the panic of there being rain when there shouldn’t have been rain, he hadn’t even started to try and wonder what had caused the disturbance. He went back over all of his equations, ran through the potions he had brewed, and came up with nothing.
Harry let out a laugh. “Darling,” he said, “I’m Pansy.”
Draco had no choice but to kiss him again. Carefully, so as to not break the kiss, Draco rolled them so he was settled between Harry’s legs.
They finish up their afternoon by grabbing a quick lunch at a charming little cafe and taking a long walk through a nearby park. They’re home by early evening, the sun still bright in the sky and that, of course, is when Scorpius finds their stowaway.
“I told him we could go look at owls,” Draco responds a little stiffly.
“You idiot,” Draco said. “Apparating into a building where Muggles might be?” He shook his head in mock dismay. “I thought you had to go through stealth training to be a curse breaker.”
“No,” Harry says, his lust-filled brain dialed up to eleven. "That takes too long."
Harry smiled at Draco and Draco couldn’t keep back a bark of laughter. “Yeah ‘cause you and Stella didn’t fuck on the first date,” he said.
“You did though,” she said softly. “You were filling out something on the alcohol license application and Harry said something. You laughed and called him ‘Harry’.”
exactly what I expected.”
“Bleh,” Draco says with an exaggerated shudder and Harry has to roll his eyes at them both for being so dumb.
They’re in Harry’s flat, in Harry’s
Draco nods. “That sounds lovely.” The tips of his ears turn pink. “Thanks.”
Draco nodded. “Yeah, apparently she’s secretly rich. Only a few people know, so don’t gossip. She doesn’t want to be treated any differently. But the old owners wanted to retire so instead of letting it be sold to a stranger, she bought it herself.”
Draco doesn’t answer but he
“You’re not what I expected.”
“It’s supposed to be sunny for your wife’s—”
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Draco mumbles when the silence stretches on for too long. He jumps when he hears Ginny shriek.
“Look who’s gotten spontaneous in his advanced age,” Harry teases.
“The bad news is that as you’re not cursed, you seem to just be an odd person.”
Harry grabs Draco’s arm and starts pulling him towards their bedroom. “Meant what I said about sniffing you all over,” he says. “You always smell so good everywhere.”
“We’re in a terrible rush,” Hermione started.
“I owe PB a treat,” Harry whispers to himself.
Harry motioned at the door next to his. “We share a connecting bathroom,” he said.
Harry lifted Draco’s hand up and kissed his knuckles, one by one. Then he leaned in and gently kissed Draco on the mouth.
On and on the pattern went, until one day Draco was shocked to realise that when Harry said
is going to disrupt their quiet life, it would be Harry Potter.
“Hungry,” Draco admits. “Didn’t realise it until you were in the hall and I could smell it.”
“Your girlfriend threatening me and then the look on your face when I realised she knew about our world.” Potter let out a little laugh. “No one has treated me like a regular bloke in a long time.”
“Professional?”
He reaches the bottom button and watches as Draco shrugs out of the shirt, the faint whisper of cloth over skin making Harry hot.
walks into Harry and Ron’s office.
“Of course it would be Potter,” Draco groans. He takes another drink of his wine, almost finishing it, and steels himself for the inevitable. “We’ve got to owl Potter.” Draco’s voice is resigned.
“What the fuck?” Draco said after his brownie had fully kicked in and the monkey was flying. “Someone got
Bob rolls over onto his back and Draco reaches out to scratch gently at his belly.
“Move the boat!” Zacharias thundered. “We need him alive!”
“Um,” Draco replied, his head coming up with scenarios that were more and more unlikely. “When?” He paused. “And how?”
He turns to Harry with Disney’s
“Scorpius can’t Apparate, can he?” Harry asks.
Draco must hear Harry’s resolve because he lets out a little sigh and casts a Stasis Charm on the clown. “I’m coming in early,” he says, a quaver in his voice.
Harry’s left with a frown and slumped shoulders after the encounter. But before he goes home, he gets an interoffice memo from Draco that says,
Harry gasps. His
“You make a strong argument, Potter.” He tilts his head and captures Harry’s lips again. After a few lazy kisses, he pulls back. “Lead the way,” he says and Harry flushes.
“Malfoy,” Ron answers.
Nothing gave Draco as much pleasure as ordering Harry around.
“Yeah, I invited her to celebrate,” Draco said.
“Circe’s tits, you’re annoying,” Draco says, making Harry laugh.
, after being sorted into Slytherin, Al and Scorpius had struck up a friendship. Harry isn’t sure how close they were at Hogwarts, but the reason they went to Diagon Alley was so Albus could meet up with Scorpius and several of their other friends.
Draco burst into laughter. Harry watched as he laughed and admitted to himself that had he seen Draco laugh like that when they’d first met, they might have had a different relationship at Hogwarts. Finally he stopped and made an exaggerated display of wiping his eyes.
“Is one of you Harry Potter?” Their server has rushed to the table and looks frantic. “There’s a call for you and they said it was quite urgent.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t need setting up.”
“The war’s long over, Draco,” Hermione said kindly. “Don’t be an arsehole and we can all get along.”
, Minerva—switching names made his head hurt—had offered to sit with Scorpius so Draco could go out alone and maybe figure out what had caused the rain.
Incensed by Draco’s insults, Voldie ran out of the castle and into the copse where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets was hidden. He violently pushed at the knot and ran down the steps to where Harry was being kept. Bellatrix stood when she saw he was there, his appearance a surprise. She started to smile as Voldie stomped to her desk and grabbed her wand.
Harry lets out a little laugh. “I don’t know,” he answers, while
"She's got good taste," he says as his ears turn pink. "Thursday's no good, but I'm free the rest of the week."
"I promise you'll come to no harm. And I'm sure a
“You know I grew up rich, but I have my own flat with Scorpius and we don’t—”
“Remind me why we’re here and not at our nice warm flat,” Draco said with a wry smile.
With a leer, Ginny says, “Oh, I will.”
"Then go!" Ron half shouts. Malfoy furrows his forehead then he turns to Harry with an almost apologetic look on his face.
With a sigh, Draco pulls away. “I know,” he says, “but I don’t want to get blubbery here.” He looks around the busy platform where people are starting to stare but haven’t reached the outright gawking phase.
Draco’s eyes drop to the floor as he mumbles.
“EW!” comes a voice from the door. “Dad!”
“Are you OK, dad?” he asked.
Between the realisation that he is talking to a man who looks like an older version of himself, and the horrors of the last twenty-four hours, Draco promptly passes out.
"I really should be on my way," he insists.
“You’ve found me out, Potter,” Draco says with a little blush. “I’d never get the stains out of white trousers.”
Harry smiled softly, brushed the hippogriff he was tending to one last time, and replied, “As you wish.”
“Quit!” he hissed.
Draco turned to Harry. “What?”
!” Draco insisted, wiggling his body to emphasise
“I’ve lost you once,” Draco whispered back. “I can’t go through that again. I would rather be parted from you than have you harmed.”
“Didn’t even get a finger in,” he says, biting at the bone.
Adopting a kitten must be what like having a newborn is like, Draco decides. The first night the damn thing woke them both up every two hours. It,
“Oh, just, we found this.”
“HE’S MAGIC?!?”
He stands and goes to where Draco is hovering in the doorway and pulls him into an embrace.
he admitted to himself, of partying.
“We! Father! Saviour! Family!” Hermione sputtered out.
Harry reached down and slicked himself up. Draco moved so he was straddling Harry’s right thigh and they lined up, cock-to-cock.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks, voice frantic.
Looking down his nose, Draco lets out a little snort. “It sounded like you were going to reward your creature for some reason.”
“Sure, but, like...how?”
Harry mused on that until his brain spiraled. He liked being where
Harry bumps his shoulder into Draco’s again then walks over to the doorway which leads out of the kitchen. “I think the kids and your mum are all entertained. Come sit with me in the lounge. Tell me about what you expected.”
“Draco,” Harry says meaningfully. “I know.”
Harry looks up to glare at Ron, flipping him two fingers at the shiteating grin he’s got on his face.

“Show me to your lounge, Harry.”
She gave Draco one last lingering look and Disapparated away.
at the prospect of leaving, but Draco reckoned he was projecting.
Harry laughed quietly. “We’re closed tomorrow. Maybe we could go out for dinner?” He looked hopeful. “To celebrate our successful opening.”
“Fuck!” he shouts.
Harry bit back his smile. “I would appreciate that,” he said, barely keeping his laughter in.
with sex.
“Have a lovely night, boys.”
The king died the next night and Draco married Voldie the following morning. Once again, Voldie delivered a speech from a balcony, high above his subjects and Draco was on the ground, waiting to be introduced. He fought back tears as he walked out of the castle, still in his wedding robes. The robes were snowy white covered in silver embroidery and they were heavy and stiff. His hair had been left loose, but brushed until it shone platinum in the sun. He had even had a few Cosmetic Charms applied so his light eyes would be more prominent. Though Draco had never been as pampered, he had never been more miserable.
Almost-but-not-quite Draco sighs. “I can’t tell you much,” he says. “But when you get back to the proper time, go back to Luna.” He levels Draco with an intense gaze. “Mother was right about that.”
Case-in-point, Harry’s plans for their night in. The children are still in school for another month, and Harry had suggested they take advantage of having the flat to themselves and no plans. He’s three fingers deep in Draco and
“Trombone,” Ron whispered.
“Fuck!” Draco whispers as he and Harry roll apart, hastily pulling their pants back up. They have both moved to sitting when Scorpius bursts through the door.
“They’re dating now—”
“Probably going to lease it out to a big chain store,” Emily said. “Boots or something.” She gave Draco a weird look. “Unless…”
Draco’s brain stalled at the choice. He felt safer in the presence of his son, but he and Harry were starting this
“Second date?” Harry can hear the smile in his voice.
“We still need to feed Peanut Butter Tater Tot.”
The man in black kept smiling. “What kind of man do you think I am?” he asked quietly.
“Welcome to the family, Bob,” Harry says, as Draco flops back down into his pillow.
our store.”
“Does it meet your approval, love?” Harry asks, his eyes dark.
“You’re daft,” Voldie said as he grabbed Draco’s arm harshly and pulled him past Carrow.
“Do you need to go do your job?” Draco asked, trying to keep the hopeful tone out of his voice.
“It’s just. It sounded like you said something about my hair.”
a Seeker.”
With a crack, Kreacher appeared in front of them. “Mistress Black’s only child,” he said with a bow. “Kreacher will be happy to warm the room for you.”
“I know,” Draco says, a little petulant. “I’m glad we’ve caught the bad guy, I am!” he insists. “It’s just that there was all this build up and then—”
However, they had gotten
“I have too.”
“Hips up,” Draco directed, wedging the pillow under Harry when he did as directed.
, Draco stood, fidgeting, by his Floo a week later.
Harry swept Draco into a kiss, letting all of his love show. When they pulled apart, Draco saw that his eyes too, were shiny from unshed tears.
“I haven’t forgotten about you,” he said, pointing at Harry and putting Hugo back on the ground, trying to direct his attention away from the  weeds.
Then he swung Hugo up onto his shoulders and started making Thesetral noises and doing a little gallop. Hugo let out a bright peal of laughter as they started back towards the door and Harry had no choice but to follow.
"You're just big," Harry counters.
“I don't even know his name. Just... his bum.” Draco’s voice is almost reverent when he says
, and Harry still counts the day as a win.
“Can you take one more, love?” Harry asks. “We don’t—”
“I’m frustrated, Scorp,” he admitted. “I don’t know why my spells keep failing.”
“Yes,” agreed Hermione with a quick hex, “but you must realize it’s easily countered by McGonagall’s shield?”
Draco grabs the ankles of Harry’s jeans and
“We can go as fast or as slow as you want, Harry. I know you’re brand new to all of this—”
was the only thing he said to Draco. It was always accompanied by a gentle smile.
Obviously not expecting that, Draco turned red again. “Oh,” he said. “Yes, that…” He took a deep breath. “I would like that.” Shaking his head, he added, “I always wanted to be Harry Potter’s friend.”
“I trust you, Harry.”
“If you need anything,” she said over her shoulder, “ring the bell. Everything is half price until we move.” Then she disappeared behind the curtain.
Draco lets out a huff and motions to Harry that he needs to turn his body at a forty-five degree angle. Harry does as he’s told and his legs are dangling off the side of the bed.
Harry laughed and pulled Draco back into his arms. “It’s actually a funny story. My ship
“Oh.” Harry shuddered against him.
Harry couldn’t keep a smile off his face. Sure, the special effects were cheesy and the budget for the show was incredibly low for a BBC classic, but Harry was enjoying sharing
wordless, the flash bastard, because he slides his fingers inside Harry and they're so slick.
Making his way into his own room, he heard Draco talking to himself in their shared bathroom.
Ron must have noticed his indecision because he nudged Draco towards the door with a, ”Neither ‘Mione nor Harry bite,” then he walked out to the backdoor.
“Is that OK then?” Harry asked.
Scorpius beams. “I can be still,” he promises.
“Mother,” he sighed.
Without waiting for an answer, Potter Disapparated without a sound and Draco was left standing alone and speechless.
“She’s so fucking classy,” Draco said with a smile.
, Draco’s about to scream.
Another wordless and wandless curse landed, this time on Bellatrix’s right cheek. They matched now; each having cursed and permanently scarred the other.
Harry pouted a little.
“You know I can’t gamble all of our money on something that might never be profitable because of who I am.”
learned to tolerate me.”
Harry missed Draco’s warmth and the feel of his body immediately. Instead of answering, he pulled Draco back in so they were cuddling.
“That depends.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, feeling rude at interrupting, but thankful Hermione was willing to drop the subject.
Now on the defensive, Bellatrix started backing up. Hermione walked towards her, a cold expression on her face. “Hello. My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
“Is, is she—” Draco stutters out.
“Uh sure!” Harry squeaks out. “Let me just—”
The door opened and Draco’s mother walked in, her arms full of flowers.
so Harry didn’t have to feel uncomfortable.
But eventually Harry pulled back, rested his face in the crook of Draco’s neck.
“It’s cursed,” Stella said as Emily said, “It’s the best movie in the entire world.”
Draco is waiting on him and looks a little annoyed. “Sorry!” Harry breathes out. “Luna was—”
He offers his arm and Draco takes hold and they Disapparate away.
Luna looked at Ron and Hermione and gave them a sad look. “Ever since she was fired by Prince Voldie, she’s doubted herself.”
“Thanks,” Harry murmured. “So, yeah, I started calling you now-Draco in my head and it sort of stuck.”
Regrettably, it has no response. Leaning back against the cold tile of the shower wall, he debates turning the tap to cold or indulging himself. The debate takes all of two seconds before he’s whispering a lubrication charm and taking himself in hand.
Harry laughs at the look on Draco’s face. “Yes, we can go out for drinks.”
“Strange wedding,” the king said, patting Draco’s arm. Draco nodded at him weakly. He leaned over to press a small kiss on the king’s cheek.
“We don’t have to—”
“Won’t let it go to my head,” he reassured her with an answering smile.
The server walks over and Draco places an order for a bottle of wine with two glasses and an appetiser. Harry is still hiding, but in a manly way, behind his menu.
Harry reached out and gently touched Draco’s chest, moving along a scar. “I haven’t forgiven myself,” he said. “I’m so sorry.”
"Maybe I've always been weird," Harry suggests.
Harry's eyes track Ron as he casts a
“I miss France,” he said with a frown.
“It was,” Mrs Weasley said. “There were a lot of people.” She walked up to Draco’s mum and they started talking, low and happy.
He looked around his little corner of the large barn and, not finding the feed bag said, “Scarhead, fetch me the owl food.”
“I... I know this is crazy, but what do you do on Saturdays?”
He waved and smiled at how much and how little his friend had changed since they first met on the Hogwarts Express. Neville wore a tan coat with a patch over one of the side pockets, which bulged from his hands, and featured a grass stain on his right arm. He held himself with confidence, but his face betrayed his apprehension.
It’s not like anyone expected anything of a Death Eater like me anyway, and no one will be shocked that I could abandon my family.  Everyone’s been waiting for me to fuck up their Savior’s life.
It’s borderline hysterical as he says, “Merlin, am I hallucinating now too? What next? I turn blue?”
“He went to dance with someone,” Neville said as quietly as he could to still be heard over the pounding beat. Draco shut his eyes and groaned, slumping over the table at the lame attempt to be subtle, as though everyone in their friend group didn’t know he was pining desperately for their friend.
Harry had imagined that first kiss many times and always as passionate and heavy. Sweet was unexpected. If they weren’t in public, then he would have gone back in for the second kiss to see if the passion would flare or if he could unlock more of the first’s vulnerable innocence.
My eyes trace over the lines and planes of the face only inches from my own. The Boy Who Lived Twice looks vulnerable, mouth ajar and drool forming a small wet spot on his pillow. Light wrinkles mar tanned skin and there’s a smattering of grey hairs already sprouting at his temples.
“What utter rubbish.”
“He must have just come from the greenhouses, and, Merlin’s beard, Neville is
The pressure is mounting.
“Is he alive?”
“That’s what you say to friends. Not former enemies.”
The exhaustion of the day fully hits after I finally have a plan in place for tomorrow.  My eyes start fluttering shut, and I tighten my hold on our beautiful Regulus, letting the smell of his shampoo comfort me.
Malfoy, his childhood nemesis and secret crush, was a thief. The man he had lusted over and had even imagined bringing back to his hotel room that very night… a criminal. And Harry, despite the rumours that he was a shoo-in to be the next Head Auror, had been duped. Like a fool. Worse, he wouldn’t have even known if Malfoy hadn’t transported him out.
They walked as casually as possible through the nave. Draco stopped every few steps, pretending to look more closely at a chapel before moving on. Most of the Muggles focused on the tomb: a large raised platform topped with four men hoisting a sarcophagus on their shoulders. Few explored on the side rooms.
As Draco tugs his shirt back on, Harry blurts out, “Dinner. Let’s have dinner tonight.”
“I don’t know where I grew up. But I’ve been in Bristol for as long as I can remember.”
“No one knows but us and VILE what really happened. You could take the diadem back now to be put back in the vault and when I get back I’ll return the necklace to the museum in Paris,” Draco suggested as a gesture of goodwill. He knew it was the right thing to say when the auror nodded with the slightest upturn of his lips.
They passed Neville on their way out, and Harry waved to let him know that he and Draco would be leaving together and not to wait up. After years of friendship, his friend would forgive him for ditching him for the night, even though Harry hadn’t realized that that’s what he had done until he was leaving. Wasn’t this trying new experiences, just as his friend had recommended?
"I knew it! You all owe me 10 Galleons," Pansy cried out, leading to a chorus of sighing and swearing before the congratulations came.
not the only one who’s curious about what happened in the last ten years.
I grab the first pair of pyjamas I find in his room while he’s brushing his teeth, and he spits the toothpaste directly onto the mirror as he starts laughing.
“Teach me.”
I cry.
I crumple up the note and leave.
“Hey Squid, we have a proposition for you,” Draco yells and there’s a ripple in response across the water. Harry’s eyes widen —
“We can talk to the house elves to see if Draco went to one of the vacation homes.  His favorite is the one you went to for your honeymoon in Provence,” Lucius offers.
“Well, maybe we can get in the Christmas spirit early this year.”
They ordered their drinks and found a private booth. The protection charms activated as they passed through to sit down. They could hear outside but would not be disturbed.
“Granger’s been here before?”
“IN THE LIBRARY!” Hermione yelled back, and Malfoy winced. It had taken Harry and Hermione a while to get used to how loud the Weasleys could be, but it had become second nature.
“How long until you can leave?”
Draco had never been close to his former captain; after all, they were years apart at Hogwarts. Back when he’d first joined the team, he had used his father’s influence to buy Nimbus 2001s to ensure he’d secure the position as Seeker. He didn’t regret it and he didn’t mind using the same “generosity” now with Marcus Flint to get this opportunity.
“Handsome as ever, sir,” the mirror complimented.
The next thing he knew, he heard voices.
He took a swig to prove to himself that he was awake and grimaced as the hot, bitter liquid burned down his throat. It sounded absurd, but he was definitely awake.
He gathered his few belongings and apparated to his actual hotel room: a luxury suite in downtown Boston.
get worse. He winced at the shout coming from down the hall. The loud wizard had only arrived a few days earlier with his partner from the United States, and yet his yelling was already painfully familiar to the entire DMLE.
Their eyes met, and Draco’s stomach flipped at the confirmation that his colour choice was spot on.
Draco took a deep breath. In. Out. It was the first deep breath he had taken in days—no, weeks.
“Can I kiss you?”
“Little Dragon Lover, of course! Do you not love his ‘little dragon’? Ow, Hermione!” Blaise cut out, and they heard Hermione’s angry whispers in the background. “Anyway, the cathedral’s closing soon, so you should be able to walk in with the Muggles if you hurry.”
Harry and Draco had come to the MMB to meet the head of the Muggle-born Assimilation Department. Brazil was one of the few countries with a department devoted to improving the Muggle-born experience. Given his fame within Britain, Harry had often been offered the chance to visit but had never had the time.
Draco’s hand moves from Harry’s cock to the nape of his neck, bringing their lips together again as their hips rut against each other while they’re fucked. There’s a pulse to their movements with the Squid setting the tempo, each obscene splash, squelch, and moan occuring in tandem.
I hate trips by Portkey.  It always makes my tummy hurt.  Dad rubs his hand on my back until my tummy no longer hurts after we arrive on a small street.
Draco let go of his arms, kneeling between Harry’s legs. Harry took the first step. His hands reached down, unbuttoning Draco’s trousers and running his hand over the silk-encased erection until it dampened.
“What the fuck was in that mixture? And why am I the only one who has to suffer?”
Very happy to have you visit. Pedro Oliveira,” he introduced himself and shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically. He then turned to the blond with a noticeably more subdued reaction.
“We used them before for the DA, but they have a Protean Charm so they’ll warm when someone updates the location and date of our next meeting. We can come up with a better solution, but it’ll be easier and safer than sending owls,” she explained, demonstrating how to add text to the side of the coin.
“It’s not…” he started before realising that finishing that cliched phrase was a definite mistake. He tried again, “After the war…”
He left the couple in Neville’s quarters and headed back to Malfoy Manor, full of renewed energy.
I can’t tell him we’ve seen worse. That we know basically everything there is to know about humans. And their bodily functions.
“Harry… Is everything alright? I shouldn’t have poked fun the other day, but am I missing something? It only occurred to me today that you’ve always avoided the lake. I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.” A hand tentatively touches Harry’s rounded spine.
also invited to the family holiday.
“We won’t have a detailed map of security, but we won’t be entirely blind. We’ll likely need two trips in: one to see the room, and one to take the chalice.”
I can’t get enough air in my lungs with each breath. As my eyes lose focus, it hits me: I’ve never quite lost that crush.
The blond’s hands smoothed over the knit fabric of the jumper in his lap, appreciating the luxurious softness. Harry pulled his on, confirming that the green of the jumper accentuated his eyes.
“You know, Draco, I could use a change of scenery for the off-season. I’ve been looking into some places in Salem. Thoughts?”
++ /* ++
Harry had been so dominant in their entire interaction so far, yet now he seemed ready to willingly surrender that control and let Draco take care of him. Draco’s chest warmed at the show of trust. As they stared into each other’s eyes, he instinctively knew they’d be equal partners in their relationship.
“CAPTAIN! COACH WANTS TO TALK TO YOU!”
I write all the time about how it’s acceptable to show your emotions, but I’m a hypocrite.
“I needed a break.”
He thought through possible dates. One option was that nice bloke he met at the Muggle gay bar last week. Neville was too close a friend and, rumour had it, already in a relationship. Zabini? Harry had heard he was bisexual, but he couldn’t remember ever having had a conversation with the former Slytherin.
And there it is. I don’t usually smirk. It doesn’t suit my face the same way it does his, but I’m smirking now.
Draco had attempted to dress like a Muggle, with an outfit he had bought to copy a mannequin on Savile Row: a grey plaid blazer over a black turtleneck and fitted black trousers. He felt overdressed as soon as he saw the shorter man, who was wearing a knit jumper with a large emerald H and jeans.
of her skill — she was so famous she didn’t need a last name. Furthermore, as an abstract artist, she could help them focus more on the process of creation.
By the anguish in his eyes, something else happened to him all those years ago besides the Ministry trials.
“Hi Draco. We found more information in the Black personal library. The history and effects seem even more far-reaching than we had thought.”
Harry looked back up at Draco’s face, sighing and answering, “Look, I’ve liked you for a while, but I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. I didn’t want you to think that I just wanted to be with you because our friends are together. I was so hopeful every time you asked me to do things, but then you never said anything.”
I shiver.
Maybe it
They walked towards the clock tower and found the doors of the cathedral still open, as expected. They slipped in.
“That... could work.”
“It’s a coat to match the hat—it has lots of pockets to keep potions and things you might need. In it are a few prototypes of products George has been working on for future missions,” Harry explained.
“I wouldn’t be here today, if not for you.”
“Did you carry that up the stairs? You should’ve used the lift.”
He wanted a family, and I gave that to him, but he could have and should have chosen a better partner.  A partner he could walk down Diagon Alley with and not feel oppressive stares.
The empty bottle of champagne I’d poured and licked off Draco’s naked body still lies where it carelessly dropped to the floor last night. The crisp white sheets that every hotel room has are haphazardly falling off the bed.
He had seen Harry come out of the shower. While drying his hair with a fluffy towel, Harry shyly asked if he could sleep shirtless and in boxers, as he usually did. He gestured to his body, naked except for the pair of black underwear.
He turned to face Harry, cracked open an eye, and grinned at the tanned face glistening with sweat.
My talkative son regains his energy as he talks about killer whales and a trip Draco took with his mother years ago to Spain.  Knowing my husband, those stories about his childhood are the ones he’s thinking over as settings or plots for a book.
“Do you have any idea where he might have gone?” I ask when they finally raise their eyes from the words back to me.
“Hey darling!” Neville cried out and giggled, stumbling towards and throwing his arms around the taller, dark-skinned man. The contrast between the couple was striking: Neville’s boyish, rough charm in an outfit that had seen better days, and Zabini’s tailored topcoat and suit, closely cropped hair, and angular face.
. The animosity had been intense on both sides, but hadn’t some of it bordered on flirting? Harry wasn’t sure anymore.
“Yes.”
The chair squeaks as I push back from the table. I leave the note where it is, staring at me like an accusation. I have a sour taste in my mouth and no appetite for dessert. Mousse is supposed to be shared, anyway.
He didn’t stay long because he was too excited to get to planning, starting with an owl to Marcus Flint.
“Please,” Draco begged, craving to be touched again.
days.
Finally, he made it into the room. The museum had been closed for an hour, so it was his good luck that the guards appeared relaxed as they chatted. Draco felt a niggle of guilt as he realised they would likely be fired if he did his job well.
The confusion, shock, recognition, and tinge of vitriol made Draco reel back from the kiss. Snippets of tense interactions in the halls of Hogwarts played through his head, because there was no doubt that this was Harry. Not James Smith from Bristol. And Harry
Unless change hits me in the face, and I have no choice but to shift my worldview.
I can’t get attached. I can’t allow myself to get attached. This has been just a one-night stand with someone from my past that I’ll never see again.
Draco wanted to ask what was going on. His heart pounded.
An unknown voice joined in the background, “Tell Little Dragon to bring you to us so we can talk more in person when you’re done.”
A knock on the door, then, “Draco, is everything all right in there? Any side effects from the potion splatter on your skin? Again, really sorry about that. I already cleaned up the broken glass, paid the apothecary owner for damages, and I’ll give you massages for a month. Promise.”
It was clear Ron wanted to argue, but the words were slowly percolating through his brain. What if, once again, they couldn’t rely on the Ministry to react?
Shame washes over me as I see the hurt in his eyes. I shouldn’t have lost my temper. I shouldn’t have stormed out.
And Draco felt a true smile bloom on his face. “Sounds like a good start.”
But he doesn’t. Instead, he changes the subject.
Dad lets my hand go.
“Do you remember now?”
It had taken a while to accept it, but Draco had been in love with Harry for years. Unfortunately for him, everyone in their friend group knew except for Harry himself. Harry’s obliviousness was a source of amusement for their friends, especially when Draco whined that it was unfair for the couples to gang up on him.
I sit next to my son on the couch, so I can stroke his hair and feel his solidity while I brainstorm a list of places Draco could have gone.  I know all of his friends, and I can’t imagine any of them accepting the situation.
It’s nice to see Daddy as he usually is again: smiling.  Dad doesn’t smile much, but he does when Daddy smiles.  Everyone does.  That’s just how great his smiles are.
knocked into that shelf and destroyed all those potions. And I will literally divorce you if you don’t bloody get out of here so I can preserve what’s left of my dignity.”
He paused and picked up the letter to reread it yet again. She never said Harry
This isn’t the first time I’ve had a breakdown in front of my husband, and I’m sure it won’t be the last.  He’s my rock.
“Look, are you going to order something?”
Harry ordered a “couple’s combo.” Draco started, and his heart jumped at the implication, but then he looked at the pricing. The combo was the most cost-effective option for getting popcorn and drinks for two. That’s all it was.
Malfoy was waiting, eyes studying Harry’s face intently.
“Walk with me?” Harry asked. Malfoy nodded, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in his clothes and stopping for a quick inspection in the entryway’s mirror. Harry’s heart quickened as he wondered if the blond did that every time he went outside or if the other man cared what he thought.
“Yes, yes, today we will visually explore your emotions about your relationship.”
“Glad you like it.  Haven’t touched it in days,” I whisper hoarsely, and Harry whirls around.
His raven hair is messy as always, but his outfit is sleek — similar to the one in the picture that I inspected this morning, as though I couldn’t draw every shadow and line from memory. Those tanned forearms are on display in a light blue shirt with, of course, rolled-up sleeves.
One of the reserve Beaters asked Harry a question, and Draco realised another problem with this attempted date: there were too many other people around. He gritted his teeth. This was another failure.
We ascend the marble staircase, and I bypass the reading rooms and galleries to bring Harry to the collection of John Singer Sargent murals on the third floor.
“Little Dragon, the magical signatures of the wards have been picked up on my map. I’m working through them now. The hat has 8 more minutes of invisibility before it needs to recharge, and two unknown signatures have appeared in the east wing.”
James’ expression went strange. His eyebrows knitted together and his brilliantly green eyes were fixed on Draco in an intense stare. He looked like he wanted to say something, but then the moment passed and what he said instead was “Here, let me help you carry this to your room.”
“George! Don’t be so rude to a guest!” Molly Weasley barked at her son, before softening, “Of course Harry dear, you’re family so any guest of yours is welcome. Welcome and thank you, Draco. Let me know if you need anything.”
It was an uncomfortable experience for Draco. Blaise and Ginny encouraged smaller and smaller swimming briefs, until Harry refused to let anyone see him. His ears and cheeks were stained pink when he came out of the room for the final time. He bought two pieces, one which everyone had seen and one which they hadn’t.
“Wow, what’s with the dark aura over here? Where’d Harry go?” Pansy asked, sliding into the empty space where Harry had sat.
“I don’t know. A few years ago, the only name I remembered was James. So that’s what everyone called me. None of the specialists could explain what had happened, but then… oh Hermione and Ron, how are they doing? What happened to them?”
They spent the morning in the company of Pedro, sipping on sugar-heavy cafezinhos and learning about his work. The department aimed to make Muggle-borns feel comfortable during their studies at Castelobruxo, the local school, and as they transitioned into careers.
I pull back long enough to summon parchment and a quill. I quickly scribble out a note, my handwriting not its usual tidy script (it’s Harry’s influence—or perhaps my own need). We have the highest solve rate in our unit and a well-deserved vacation is in order. Nobody will bat an eye at us taking some time off. Maybe we’ll nip away to some place warm. Or perhaps we’ll lock the Floo and just stay in our flat. It doesn’t matter so long as we’re together.
Finally! He spotted the well-worn corner of the map he had been searching for and pulled it out, causing a small landslide of papers. He sighed. Today was not his day.
Miami was hot and sunny, a complete shift from drizzly London. Their hotel overlooked the beach, and Draco had specifically requested a view of the water on one of the upper floors. He had initially booked a honeymoon suite, but when they arrived, the manager explained that Pansy had upgraded them to three adjoining suites with an ample shared space.
Because he
This wasn’t the path Harry Potter was supposed to take after the Final Battle and testifying on my behalf. He should have become an Auror, marry Ginny Weasley, and pop out three kids with names in honor of his heroes — something sappy like James, Lily, or Albus.
“We could, but we won’t. That’s how we lost Severus Snape, and it’s not worth it. Since Ron will still be in the Auror Department, I will resign so I can help Draco on the ground. We still have to build contacts and gather information so we can target VILE where it hurts. Since the heists have been failing, they will change tactics soon if they haven’t already.”
That flight to get Neville’s Remembrall was the first time I had felt like I was good at something. Good for something. Coming back to that years later was a glimpse of the childhood the Dursley’s never let me have.
“Come. Sit down. How’s Hogwarts?”
Harry’s fantasies had rewritten what happened next several times over. His personal favourite: Malfoy smirking and walking over to take a bite out of Harry’s cone before kissing him. Then, they’d apparate to Harry’s apartment for a night of loud and passionate hate sex. Not that they hated each other anymore, but former-enemies-now-acquaintances sex just didn’t have the same ring to it.
“How do we find Daddy? He knows his way home from the store, so he must be really far away.”
After all these years.
“I have a confession.” Hermione reached up to pull the pen out of her hair, only to put her hair back in a bun seconds later. The familiarity of his friends’ habits and ticks always comforted Harry. Hermione always put her hair up while she worked. “I invited Luna and Ron, and they will be here in five minutes.”
I add, “I thought you were an Auror or a Healer or some helping people thing like that.” The words flow out of my mouth before I can stop them. They’re idiotic words, mired in my own shame that I don’t really help people, even after all the damage I’ve done.
Harry was an excellent auror, but oblivious when it came to his friendships. He also didn’t seem to notice how slowly their friends walked past the windows, craning their necks to see better. Ginny gave an encouraging thumbs up when Draco looked her way.
Draco’s face burned as he recounted the non-date to his friends. He regretted telling everyone about the reservation because Blaise, Neville, Pansy, and Ginny had contacted him on Sunday morning to ask how it had gone.
He gasped as Harry gave a long lick over the wool trousers before pulling on the zip and doing the same on the silky fabric of the pants below. Draco moaned, pushing his fingers mindlessly down towards the waistband, desperate to feel that tongue directly on his skin. Harry chuckled and obliged.
When I wake up, the migraine is better, but I still can’t think of food without feeling queasy.
Harry kissed him, and Draco could taste the rich sweetness of the chocolate. Draco brought his hand up to Harry’s chest, pushing him on his back on the sofa. He ran his fingers over the muscled chest as he let his mouth travel down to the tanned neck. He gently nibbled at it and smiled at the resulting groan.
Draco now lived for Blaise’s visits. His friend would update him on discussions with Hermione and Harry as they looked through his great-uncle’s research. All contact had been through Neville and Blaise, which Draco thought was a little unfair given that Blaise fit the definition of an accomplice. The visits always ended with Draco gaining a modicum of hope; after all, he hadn’t been arrested yet.
I run my hand over my bump as I wave to his teacher.  I’ll go through the process of bringing a child to school for the first time again.  I wonder if it’ll be as hard the second time around.
In short, I can’t look away from this new, professional Harry Potter who looks ready to talk to the press at any minute. Because, by Salazar,
Suddenly, they both felt the burn of the charmed Galleon in their pockets.
He vaguely remembered a conversation a year earlier, when Neville mentioned a trip he had taken to the Everglades to study the local flora. Harry had then excitedly explained to the group about the Muggle concept of magic and Disney World. He’d even forced them all to watch children’s films about true love and poisoned apples.
“Tell me what you want, Draco.”
He idly wondered if he would face the thief in the red hat today and what it would mean if they took the diadem just to give it back again. In the last three weeks since the return of the Salem Ring, the artefact from Egypt had been returned, but not the pieces from the first two heists in London and Paris. No one on the task force had an explanation for what had changed between the first two heists and the last two.
“Why wait for tonight?” I say, and it takes a moment for my words to sink in. His lips part, as though he’s about to ask if I’m sure, but I don’t let him. I do what I said I’d never do (I suppose some rules are meant to be broken). I crowd into his space and claim those kissable lips. It’s been too long. His hands find my hair, and I pull him tightly against me with one hand on his shoulder and the other on his arse (his pert, grabbable arse). He sighs, and I deepen the kiss. I can feel him vibrating with need, with yearning.
Suddenly, the bespoke suit made more sense. (Sue me, so I noticed the embroidered name of the atelier when I’d found it rumpled on the floor next to my trousers.) Harry had looked like he’d stepped from a press conference because he literally
“It is, but our counterparts in Boston and Paris haven’t found new witnesses, even through Muggle channels.”
“You mean, he literally thought he was just doing you a favour?” Blaise howled as Draco threw the pillow that had been resting in his lap at his friend’s smug face.
As their relationship progressed from fuck buddies to boyfriends, Harry had thought Draco would eventually mention what he did those mornings. But he didn’t.
The room was overwhelming: filled with balloons of all colours and at various heights, their strings spiralling down for patrons to grab onto. There were various steps and ladders so one could closely examine them and try to guess what colour powder would be inside.
My hand reaches to draw my wand from its holster. It’s an old reflex from the War, as I haven’t carried a wand regularly since I lost mine back then. There are some parts of our past we can’t outrun.
The four wizards found a table so they could actually taste the drinks they ordered. Blaise kept his arm wrapped around Neville and glared at any men and women who dared to approach. Unfortunately for Draco, it was more common that people stopped by to hit on Harry. He glowered into his drink as Harry humoured one particularly tall and bulky man.
As soon as the end credits rolled, Draco jumped up and grabbed Harry’s arm, mumbling, “We should talk.”
“Hold up. Are you seriously trying to tell me that there’s an international big baddie organisation out there and no one knows?”
“Some grapes are the right colour… or yams.”
Twenty minutes before the end of my shift, and he’s still here. He’s the very last patron at the bar, and somewhere between his third and fourth glass of wine, his lopsided and affectionate smile has become permanently affixed to his face. (Because, of course, I had counted and noticed. That’s just being a good bartender.)
Draco let out another bark of laughter as he sat next to him, then took Harry’s face in his hands to press their lips together chastely.
“Yes, pumpkin.”
At the end of the night, he and Neville made to leave. As they stepped into the cold London night air, cheeks and bodies warmed by the alcohol, they saw Blaise Zabini. He stood a few feet away, face lit by a Muggle mobile.
“So… what? We’re not having enough sex for you? You’ve had to use your hand more than before because I’m not there to fuck you? Fucking Salazar, Harry!”
. How much longer was this movie?
Both laughed, quietly at first and then uproariously, their whole bodies quaking. Harry even had to lift his specs off the bridge of his nose to wipe at his tears. With more courage and better communication, the entire situation would have been resolved much earlier.
Put that way, Harry understood his friend’s logic. There was a reason she was the smartest person he knew, and it wasn’t just “books and cleverness.” This was also her way of seeing how Blaise and Malfoy would interact beyond their small group, and he nearly smirked at the cunning of it.
“I can’t be everywhere at once. I thought you knew that and understood that. I’m busy. We’re busy. I’m bloody trying.”
“Excuse me?”
Back to its original size, the unassuming package is heavy in my hands. Hefty. Swooping letters in thick, black Sharpie cover the brown paper. If I’d read it before, I would have recognized the perfect penmanship.
His lip trembles and my heart breaks. Of course, Harry needs me too. It’s easy to forget. Harry does so much for others (so much for me) and he always seems so strong and self-assured. I sometimes lose sight of his vulnerability.
As a child, Draco was jealous, convinced that Harry Potter thought himself above everyone else based on his celebrity status. As an adult, he knew Harry deserved all the acclaim—he had saved him from the Fiendfyre, literally died for the greater good, and now was continuing to fight for what he thought was right.
Harry had chosen an entirely Muggle outfit; the blazer was just a hair too short on his wrists, an obvious sign to a fashion enthusiast that he had bought it off the rack. 12-year-old Draco might have sneered, but 26-year-old Draco recognised that the man was bloody fit, and he just wanted to see him out of the clothes.
“Er... okay. Do you mind, Draco?” Harry asked.
“Hey,” Harry murmured and grabbed Draco’s hand.
As soon as they entered, the witches downed shots at the bar before taking to the dance floor. They were in their own little world, possessively wrapped around each other and ignoring any attempts to encroach on their fun.
Strong arms helped him prop himself up against a nearby wall.
“Thanks… so where was I? He was brilliant, really. Wait… um, maybe I’ll get back to that later. So, he found out that his cousin was part of a Dark organisation called VILE. The E stands for ‘eradication.’ Of Muggle-borns. They inspired the Death Eaters. Unclear how he got it, but there’s a book that records some of their activity. Like stealing artefacts and selling them.”
My letters scrunch together and get smaller as they curve up the side to fit the page:
“Let’s just talk about what you want. No pressure.”
He nods.
One night in the middle of the semester, Draco found out James was gay. He’d been passing by a group of students in the dormitory lounge who were playing a game of Never Have I Ever. Maybe he’d lingered around the shared kitchenette a bit longer than necessary to see whether James drank to the prompt of “I have never had a crush on a member of the same sex.” And James had taken a drink, blushing hotly as he caught Draco’s eye. Draco had held his gaze, brought his glass of water to his lips, and taken a drink. He hoped the message was clear, even though he didn’t really know why he did it.
“Draco, I’m... good.” Harry panted out the words against Draco’s lips, and it took Draco a few seconds to register what they meant. He was torn between desperately clinging to their current connection and moving on.
“Of course, please come in,” Draco replied coolly.
Then he feels it: a slick tentacle wrapping gently around their waists, the tip tracing up the back of Harry’s leg. Then another.
In the reality of that moment when Malfoy looked over at the trio, however, Harry had wanted to run away, crawl under a rock, and die from embarrassment.
“We’re still trying to get ahead and alert local aurors where we think major heists could occur. Given that we suspect they are British and supposing they can speak French, we are focusing on Canada, Australia, Belgium, and Switzerland.”
“Marcus.”
Harry laid on the bed, the only thing his mind processed about the room, and pulled Draco down on top of him.
I debate telling Harry, but I do feel better now.  I know he’d leave work immediately, but he’s already getting off early to pick up Reg today.  I don’t want to ask for more, even if I know he would happily help.
His fingers clutched his wand desperately, holding it in front of him with his arm extended as he stealthily tiptoed through the rooms. He had earned top marks in stealth training and was sure he could catch any assailant unawares. Then he saw a familiar head of bushy hair and breathed a sigh of relief as he pocketed his wand.
Malfoy’s hair, usually perfectly coiffed, was a mess, and he looked terrified. Of Harry? Of Azkaban? Then the blond’s expression suddenly shifted to relief.
“The fuck, Potter?”
They settled in and geared up for the first trip in, putting in their earpieces to connect with Blaise back in London.
"We have an announcement," Harry said, standing and pulling Draco up with him before continuing, "We're getting married!"
The light changes, and I zone in on Harry Potter’s grin as he winks and stares back at me.
The pain subsides as I lie, unmoving, on the couch in the dark.  It’s a dull ache.
++ /* ++
“Harry, for fuck’s sake, I need to go. Now.”
The whole night, Draco’s every action was intentional. Draco read the signs of his body intimately, reacting to any sign of discomfort and not pushing any limits.
Then it hits me: I never unwrapped that book that “chose” me. Or, as I now know, that Draco’s
When the ceremony drew to a close, he rushed towards the small building between the topiary garden and the ancestral home of the groom. He approached as the bride walked towards her cousin to hand over the diadem.
Flying and Portkeys aren’t advised for pregnant wizards, so he probably had to apparate or take Muggle transportation.  We’ve taken trains before, of course, but not planes.  If it’s apparition, it has to be a place he knows, can mentally picture, and is not too far.  That limits the list of places further.
The street lamps flickered on, bathing the park in warm light as the sky darkened. He stopped, panting, and grabbed the metal railing to look over the calm water. He appreciated the flow of the Charles River. There was no end in sight in either direction and no hint of whether the river curved at some point unseen. That mystery of what lay just out of sight was the perfect, if sappy, metaphor for his life after the war. Gone was the predictability of duty.
It pushes him over the edge.
“Draco Malfoy.”
It had only taken one to proposition Harry. And then next thing I knew, we were desperately kissing in the elevator up to his room, clothes shrugged off as soon as the door clicked closed.
team) and played against me back then. And yet, he doesn’t know I play professionally, much less that the World Cup happened in his own backyard?
to make it work.”
Reg knows already, and he’s ashamed.  He doesn’t even want to be my son.
They both looked back at the sunset; Harry reached behind them to put his hand over Draco’s. While everyone else packed up and walked down the rocky slope to head to the bars or to their beds, they stayed put, delaying the inevitable.
Walking had never been such a sensual activity. After a few mishaps, Harry learned how to feel the press of Draco in their embrace, showing that he would take a step forward so Harry could step back.
The familiar circular frames were pushed into his hand. Putting them on, he could see the furrowed brow and down-turned lips on Draco’s face. Concern, his mind registered.
“What if it’s fake?”
He stands rooted to his spot, and the indecision between not wanting to talk to me and wanting to hear all about how Britain played in the finals for the first time in fifty years is clear as day.
“Do you think I would give subpar chocolates? I’d only buy the best of the best.” The tips of Draco’s ears were red at Harry’s incredulous tone.
As predicted, Luna put a gentle hand on his arm, but otherwise let him absorb and process the blast of information, from Malfoy’s heists to the existence of VILE, unimpeded.
Unable to contain his affection, Draco moved on instinct, leaning up to kiss Harry’s forehead, nose, and finally his lips again.
So here he was, hiding in plain sight in the United States. And he, who used to think his family could buy quite literally anything they wanted, had become a thief.
“I can’t believe it’s just a few more months, and we’ll have another family member,” he whispers.  The baby moves in response to their father’s voice and kicks.  Harry marvels, as he always does, at the gentle pressure from inside against his hand on the outside.
“Yeah.”
“Draco... sure, Harry seems oblivious as fuck, but what are you going to do? Take him on a honeymoon and skip the whole dating and marriage steps?”
“We played the home team, if you’re wondering. Question is, would you support the country you grew up in or the country you’ve adopted?”
As Harry and Hermione explained the situation, Ron kept one hand on his wand and the other holding a biscuit. Occasionally he would get up and pace, not noticing the trail of crumbs he left in his agitation.
When I’d heard about being an Auror, I’d thought it was the perfect career for me. I wanted to help people. But then the nightmares started. I was chasing evil wizards and nearly dying in my dreams. Did I want that to be my waking reality, too? And the Aurors I’d thought to emulate, like Kingsley (now Minister of Magic) and Tonks (deceased), wouldn’t even be around for me to work with.
“Well, that’s good. I’d hate for someone to mistake me for being straight…. You doing alright there, Malfoy? I’d offer something to drink, but you’re the bartender here.”
“I don’t know.”
“Potter, you can’t just reach over the bar like that. It violates several health codes.”
Daddy is crying now.  I feel Dad’s body shake a little and see that Dad is too.
“It’s not
Harry’s arms loosen, and I step away. Create space. I can’t think otherwise.
“No. Enjoy.”
He pretended not to hear his friend crying after him that it was just a joke. This holiday would be a fairy-tale trip, and if he acted fast, he could even have it coincide with Harry’s 26th birthday.
++ /* ++
“I can’t tell if I’m just imagining it… or the house is communicating with me.”
They transported out, streaks of red and purple barely missing their bodies.
When the International Quidditch Organization announced that the World Cup was in Boston this year, Hermione had immediately Flooed me about her favorite places in the city. Unsurprisingly, her best memories from her holidays are of bookstores. At her Boston favorite: a hot chocolate and Avi’s
“Of course. Thank you.” Draco bowed his head slightly in acknowledgement.
Draco’s heart clenched in sympathy at the misery clear in Harry’s voice. “You don’t have to figure all that out now. One step at a time, okay?”
“I never give up and neither does Harry. He has been practically living at the Ministry, going through records of Vernon and trying to connect locations and other companies that might be involved. If they use the VILE acronym twice, they probably use it more than that.” Hermione’s words were sharper than he expected, and he felt the sting of shame.
I’m running to the station, then packing into a train full of tourists who are asking, “Is this the train to Fenway? Kenmore?” Because, of course, there’s a Red Sox game on the day I actually care about getting somewhere on time.
with Draco, the man in question was tiptoeing around to leave.
Harry James Fucking Potter is
, I can show you a fun time.”
Too soon, Harry pulled away, and Draco’s teammates piled on to congratulate him for a match well-played. Even when a Chaser not-so-subtly offered that he could “seek” other things with her, he barely registered their words.
And the cherry on top? He’s openly gay.
I write on a post-it (Hermione’s gotten Draco hooked on them and he considers them one of the best Muggle inventions ever) and leave it on the counter:
I go down the stairs slowly, using and lifting a nonverbal cushioning charm for each step, so I’m not overheard.  I leave the note on the kitchen table.
The Aurors stared at him before one answered, “Morgan and Devlin. Now we’ve called you here to ask about the whereabouts of your father.”
The rest of the evening, the conversation was awkward but less hostile as they discussed strategy. Beyond the Order, Ron suggested reaching out to other friends of Blaise and Malfoy, whose relatives could have had connections to VILE to see if further records could be found. Surely the Malfoys and Blacks weren’t the only pure-bloods involved in England.
Harry cocked his head, hands paused at Draco’s waistband, waiting for the go-ahead.
Their legs tangle together, no longer needing to tread water to keep afloat. They can focus on the sensations: on the movement of cock against cock, tentacle against nipple, mouth against mouth.
They entered, and Harry let go of his hand as he was swept into a sea of redheads. While the entire family hugged and welcomed Harry, Draco stood stiff as stone in the doorway.
Blaise had his usual stony thinking face, but his annoyance showed as he crossed his arms and tapped his foot. Draco watched as Neville put a light hand on his boyfriend’s forearm.
“May I help you, Potter?” The quiet voice comes from behind him, his last name spat out with only a fraction of the usual acrimony. Defensively, maybe, instead of maliciously.
Willing himself not to look for Draco Malfoy, he kept his eyes fixed on the jewellery for the entire ceremony. He let the words wash over him.
That pronouncement, clear as day, left Devlin and Morgan speechless. And finally, after threateningly shoving their wands in Draco’s face, they let him apparate home with the promise of further questioning another day.
He decided he had enough time to relieve himself before he had to leave, so he did. As he basked in the afterglow, he wondered if Harry liked to cuddle.
“You bring joy to kids all around the world with your stories.  You write to bring hope and teach acceptance.  You’re literally shaping a generation,” Harry would say if he were here.  I can’t understand how he sees terrible things every day and still has so much optimism.
I didn’t think I could cry more after earlier, but I was wrong.  The tears roll down my cheek, and I flee to our bedroom to curl up on Harry’s side of the bed.  I inhale the aftershave.  It comforted me earlier, but now I feel regret.
Draco hadn’t known that three words could be such a sucker punch.
He grabs my left hand and kisses our wedding band.  He looks into my eyes and kisses the bonding marks as well, sending a tingle of magic up my arm and down my spine.
A blush rose on Draco’s face at the touch, and he downed the rest of his Albariño.
“Yeah.”
“Draco,” Malfoy said flatly without preamble, leaving Harry bewildered.
“That curve looks nice, what’s it going to be?”
He couldn’t believe he had agreed to be here. Neville insisted he needed to try new things and meet new people, so Harry had begrudgingly relented. He had assumed “a night of dancing” meant going to a bar or a club. The dancing where you only need to move your hips to a beat, hoping that someone attractive will join you and match your movements.
It’s a basic human function, and I’m stressing about it.
It took all of Draco’s willpower not to grill James with questions every time they saw each other. He’d found out little tidbits, like that he lived with a young couple on a dairy farm in Bristol, that he worked on motorcycles in his spare time, and that he knew nothing at all about his childhood or his birth parents.
But would Draco be having a panic attack right now if it really all meant nothing?
When the brunette turned, his smile faltered, and he nearly stumbled. He knew she had attended the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum back in fourth year, but he never expected them to still be in communication. After all, he barely saw Pansy anymore, and she had been his date
“Bloody sexy show off.”
Did Harry like his body, scars aside? Draco had never heard complaints, but this was
Draco pulled Harry’s face back up for a long kiss, until he felt the tension leave his body. He tugged on the hem of Harry’s jumper and murmured, “Off. Now.”
Harry counted to ten and hoped the throb in his temple would fade before he joined the impromptu task force meeting.
I let myself drift off.
“I chose you, didn’t I?”
“Would you have preferred that, Harry?” His brow furrowed as he tried to remember if any of his contacts could install a kiln in the Manor. He hadn’t even considered ceramics, although the obvious pun now made him regret that he’d immediately latched onto Neville’s suggestion without considering alternate activities.
“Draco, I’m sorry we’re a few minutes late.”
“It’s romantic, especially because dessert is a mixture of the couple’s colours,” Draco sulked.
“Draco...”
He showered and dressed, groaning as he moved; his muscles ached.
Harry shot off three spells in rapid succession towards the two men closest to the bride and one to shield himself.
“The World Cup finals were today.”
Sometimes, I still find it hard to believe that Harry Potter is my boyfriend and that we live together. We were rivals at school, and nearly hexed each other into oblivion during the first week of Auror Training. Truth be told, I’ve always provoked him (on purpose) because having his attention, even when fiery and filled with contempt, was always preferable to the alternative. During the second week of training, after an intense sparring session, something between us snapped. We ended up in bed together, and it turned out things were just as fiery between the sheets. I assumed (feared) it was a one off, but Harry pursued me relentlessly thereafter.
“Ah... it’s actually a modification to extend the charm on your very own Headless Hat. It has a time limit though,” Blaise responded.
The papers remind me of how hard Harry works both at his job and to be a parent.  He’s the best father I could have chosen for my children, and I know they’ll grow up to be just as amazing as he is.  Probably better.  He does have some bloody frustrating habits, though, like when he squeezes from the middle of the tube of toothpaste.  I’ve already taught Reg
The small phial on the table made one thing immediately clear: he’d be interrogated about another Death Eater.
The flight was difficult. Draco didn’t feel comfortable moving around the plane after turbulence hit, and he gripped the seat until his knuckles were white during every rough patch. No one else seemed to mind the shaking of the aircraft, but he wondered how Muggles could stand it.
“Speak of the devil,” Draco muttered as his friend walked in.
“You think I don’t know that?” Harry said, eyes sparkling with mirth. “Have you forgotten who my best friend is? She read everything about soulmates in the library during our first year and insisted we memorize them. We may not have grown up in the wizarding world, but Hermione is nothing if not prepared.”
“I love you, Draco,” he gasped when they parted for breath. “I have for a while.”
Flicking his wand at the door, Harry locked and warded it for privacy. Draco spared a thought to grudgingly admit he was impressed that the wonder boy knew such advanced layering spells in their third year before rounding on him. Expecting the retaliating shove before it happened, Harry followed the momentum until his back hit a wall. Draco closed the distance with a snarl but stopped short of touching him again.
Harry gaped at the suddenness of his departure. He watched Draco suck in deep breaths through red, glossy lips, his blond hair hopelessly tousled, and eyes wild with panic.
When they reached the entrance further along the wall, Draco muttered the password loud enough for Harry to hear with a sly smile before confidently leading him into the snake pit. Everyone froze when they saw who stood awkwardly at his side, but a reassuring hand landed on the Gryffindor’s shoulder, and Harry didn’t miss how all eyes tracked the possessive gesture.
When Harry’s breaths finally evened out as he succumbed to a much-needed nap, Draco relaxed his grip with a muffled groan. Uncurling his stiff muscles with difficulty, he gently slid his arms free, but froze when Harry’s lips brushed his neck.
“That’s great,” Harry replied, voice leaden with exhaustion.
“What’s the Come and Go room?” Harry asked.
She smacked his chest with a playful roll of her eyes as he set her down. “Don’t forget it, either. Now, what do you need?”
“My apologies, Professor,” Pansy said, demurely rearranging the pleats of her skirt.
Severus’ gaze flicked to Harry, inclining his head fractionally, which Harry returned with a smile. None of the students clapped or cheered at the rousing speech, but the magic thrumming in the commons was buoyant and bright, giving away their pride and excitement. Unable to rein in his magic in the charged atmosphere, Harry’s aura rose in greeting and a rush of answering energy slammed into his core.
He meant what he said, though he purposefully avoided mentioning the jealous streak that wouldn’t allow him to share, in any sense. He had years to convince him they should be together if Harry wasn’t initially keen on the idea. While Draco may not have much patience, he
Furrowing her brow, Pomfrey hesitantly said, “I know you’re against letting just anyone in here to kiss the boy, but the twins were adamant it’s the only way to wake him. Is...is there anyone you think he could have feelings for?”
Sharing a panicked glance with his godfather, Draco knew a similar litany of curses were pinging in his head, too.
“Oh?” Draco asked, brow cocked in expectation.
“Draco,” Harry whispered into the corner of his mouth, “who was the boy you had a crush on? The one who helped you figure it out?”
Draco hadn’t told his friends what he’d done for Harry over the summer; not because he didn’t trust them, but because keeping mum was the best way to guarantee Lucius didn’t find out. He’d gambled on the Gryffindor’s acceptance of his aid at the Cup and his silence afterward. It was a dangerous game they’d played, but it explained their startling lack of animosity with the new school year and the unwavering trust that flourished between them since their alliance.
“Yes, sir. Yesterday morning I noticed Harry was absent from breakfast, which was worrying considering the events at the feast Friday night.” McGonagall’s eyebrows rose sharply at the use of his first name, but she didn’t interrupt as Draco told her how he found him in the kitchens, leaving out the part about Teekey and the full nature of his conversation with Harry.
. I wasn’t planning on Harry staying beyond the weekend, but I’m not keen to let him go back to the tower.”
It was finally over.
Their professor arched a skeptical brow, but Draco turned to him hopefully. “Tell me what you’re thinking.”
“Are you saying you allowed one of your students, a minor, to go through literal hell instead of offering aid sooner?”
“We keep him alive. By any means necessary.”
“I won’t let him touch you, I swear on my magic,” he stated emphatically. “I’ll send a letter to Father and request he take me home for a weekend so I can explain the situation. Would you allow me to share the memory of this conversation with him so he can’t refute our bond or your need for protection?” Harry nibbled his lip nervously, but Draco tilted his chin. “It keeps you from having to repeat everything to him, Harry. I swear I’m not trying to trick you. I’m genuinely trying to make things easier for you.”
“Redcurrant, I believe,” Blaise replied.
“I was never a boy,” Harry growled. “You made sure of that when you sent me to live with the Dursleys and tested my compliance at Hogwarts. You guaranteed it the night I forced poison down your throat — on your orders. You turned me into an unquestioning soldier and sent me off to war knowing I would never see Draco or my friends again. You’re no better than Tom, robbing me of the people I love and denying me the chance to tell them.” He chuckled bitterly. “Anything for the greater good, am I right?”
“So it would seem,” Harry said with a wry smile.
Ducking his head to hide his smug grin, he nodded. “Yes, Mrs. Malfoy. Our captain, Marcus Flint, assured me in a letter that I don’t need to try out, but I will anyway since it’s only fair.”
“No, thank you,” he replied, a little unsettled by his title.
“Hey,” Harry whispered with a weak smile.
With a polite tap of Blaise’s hand to convey her gratitude, she tossed her hair and rose elegantly from her seat—once again the picture of poise and pureblood superiority. Extending a hand to Harry, he bowed low over her petite fingers, affection welling in his chest for the fierce girl he was fast viewing as a sister. Despite the teasing air of his genuflection, she hummed in approval before pushing up the sleeve of his school jumper. Her blood-red lips curled into a smug smirk at the sight of the bracelet on his wrist.
and his blood turned to ice. Appalled to find such information in his family’s collection, he shelved the book and resolved never to touch it again.
Though he wore the title “Prince of Slytherin” with all the aplomb of one born to it, underneath his public persona beat a heart fierce enough to rival any lion. Draco was a mass of contradictions: passionate, yet sensitive; gentle, yet firm; romantic, yet pragmatic. His parents had trained him from an early age to resemble a perfectly cut diamond, designed to reflect the Malfoy's influence. But those who simply saw a pretty bauble, forgot diamonds were also prized for their ability to cut glass without marring their surface.
“I’ve been calling it since fourth year,” George said.
“I told you to release him,” he said. “I don’t believe Harry wishes to conduct an interview, Ms. Skeeter. Do you, Harry?” Draco asked. He shot the reporter a smug grin when Harry took a step back and shook his head.
“How long have you been here? If I’d known sooner, I’d have come and said hello,” he said.
Rubbing his chest with a considering frown, Harry muttered, “Yeah. I can tell.”
Nodding curtly, he lowered his gaze and tried to bury the terrifying images flashing through his mind. His friends’ impassive faces as Ron towered over him: the lines of his body poised for violence, large hands balled into fists, the press of the door at his back—nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no way to escape the incoming blow.
All this time Draco assumed Harry’s friends and family treated him the way the world did—like a hero, a king. Instead, he was appalled to find they had denied him the bare minimum of human decency until he arrived at Hogwarts. No wonder he rejected Draco when they were younger; his entitled attitude must’ve been absolutely grotesque to a child who lived in a goddamned cupboard.
Shaking his head with a gasp, he hiccuped through his tears. “No, there’s nothing you can do, Myrtle. No one can save me. He said he’ll...kill me. Kill my family. There’s no hope now. It’s impossible. I’m going to die, I know I am.”
“Mr. Potter is busy learning, Mr. Creevey. This is still a school, and no one is afforded special treatment. Not even our
Draco blew out a long sigh. “I can’t divulge everything we talked about yesterday. It’s not my place, but…
“Really?” he asked. “You make a habit of adopting from other houses, do you?”
staring him in the face.
Krum unclenched his fists and visibly shook off his residual anger. Extending his hand with a grunt, he announced decisively. “Ve vill ‘elp you, ‘Arry Potter.”
Harry tipped his head against the bank with a sigh. “It’s just frustrating. I’m famous in wizard society, but I don’t know a damn thing about it. I don’t understand the traditions or the history. I just feel like I’m at a constant disadvantage, while the world at large has expectations of me.”
“Snape?” Draco asked the group.
A heady rush of affection for his friends chased away the chill of the drafty dungeon as Harry struggled to stay quiet. Merlin, he didn’t want to go back to the tower full of people who believed he was a liar and made him feel unsafe. The past two days proved Slytherin was his home, and these were his people.
“Sleep well, Harry,” he whispered, absently smoothing his shaggy fringe. “You’ve certainly earned it.”
“Screw them,” Draco spat. “They don’t know you and their opinions don’t matter.” Harry’s lips quirked as a blush stained the other boy’s fair complexion, but Draco forced himself not to drop his gaze from the intense green pinning him in place.
“Very well!”
If Harry had been properly sorted from the beginning, maybe he could’ve protected him from Dumbledore’s machinations. Thinking back to the trials guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone, he realized the professors had (unknowingly) engineered it for Harry and his tag-along Gryffindors to succeed. Not to mention Fawkes’ timely arrival in the Chamber meant Dumbledore was fully aware a twelve-year-old was battling a basilisk in the bowels of the school. Both instances could have ended in disaster; consigning a decrepit part of the castle to serve as a makeshift tomb for the boy who foiled a Dark Lord.
“Tell me,
The Slytherins’ initial surprise turned contemplative as they pondered the new information.
“You’ve been horrible, it’s true, but I understand why you had to be, Malfoy. Speak to Harry about it. He’ll help you.” Leaning out of the embrace, her brown eyes crinkled with her warm smile. “
Rejoining him on the bed, Draco cuddled him close and buried his nose in his hair, the sweet scent of Harry’s shampoo instantly easing his tense muscles. It amazed him that he could do this now. He’d revealed his feelings without Harry brandishing his wand and hexing him sideways. That alone was miraculous. Yet even more astounding than the discovery that his feelings were reciprocated was learning that the fearless boy was actually quite fragile and craving someone who wouldn’t judge him for cracking under pressure. And that he, for reasons he couldn't fathom, trusted Draco to be that person.
He shrugged. “Dobby mentioned when we first met that he’d heard great things about me, but for the longest time, I couldn’t imagine anyone in the Malfoy family having anything nice to say about me. Seems I was wrong.”
Securing his cloak and map, he pulled out his wand and slipped inside the bathroom, casting a silencing spell over the door. But none of his mental pep talks could have prepared him for the sight of Malfoy bowed over a sink, sobbing violently. His hair hung limp and his bony shoulders shook with the force of the cries, ripped from deep within his core. With a guttural snarl, he ripped off his jumper and gripped the edge of the basin until his knuckles popped from the strain.
“Okay,” Draco whispered with a smile. “But I insist on teaching you some poison detection spells.”
A strange hum vibrating along his core caught his attention right before the doors to the hall burst open with a surge of chaotic magic. Harry twirled wand in hand to face the new threat, but he dropped it, mouth agape when he saw Draco in the entryway. He’d filled out during their separation, gaining weight and muscle, and grown into his jawline. The healthy flush on his cheeks reminded Harry of berries and clotted cream, and he desperately wanted to know if he would taste it on his lips.
“You realize if you do this you will, in effect, be declaring your allegiance with Potter,” he cautioned. Draco swallowed hard but nodded firmly and Severus admired his courage. He wasn’t as weak-willed as him or his father. Good.
Flicking his wand at the door, their five friends tumbled in a heap onto the floor with startled yelps. Hopping off the bed with a loud laugh, Harry rifled through his pile of clothes in the top portion of Draco’s trunk.
Nodding mutely, Harry turned to Sirius. “Does it hurt?”
The shocking reality of Harry’s situation was more akin to a nightmare, though he doubted even his massively screwed up subconscious could craft something so utterly bleak. He peeked at Harry, taking in his listlessness, and felt despair weigh down his soul, ageing him by a decade.
know who we are. We were founded by Salazar Slytherin—one of the greatest wizards to ever live. Merlin himself was a snake and proud, though the world conveniently ignores that undesirable fact.”
Stick around—things will be picking up in the next two chapters! Featuring more Drarry content and good Slytherins!
Ron grimaced while the rest collapsed on the ground in stitches, their dirty jokes barely discernible through their maniacal laughter. Turning to the adults watching in fond amusement, Ron sighed heavily. This was why they fought a war, he reminded himself. To rid the world of evil and let everyone have their happily ever after.
Suddenly less than confident in the face of Harry’s lacklustre response, Draco murmured, “Please, tell me it’s not just me.”
“That’s rather forward, isn’t it, Granger?” he smirked. A smart comment almost flew off her tongue, but she bit it back when she read the humor in his eyes.
“Am I sitting with you tonight?” Harry asked.
Tracey visibly relaxed when she stood and tossed him a grin that lit up her cornflower eyes. “‘Ello, Heir Potter. If ya be needin’ anythin’ at all, please let us know.”
Sharing a panicked glance, they said in unison. “We put a poisoned apple in her classroom, but Harry ate it instead!”
Harry winced as his aunt’s harsh words through the years echoed through his head. Severus noticed his flinch and scowled.
“Harry,” Draco whispered hoarsely in the oppressive quiet. “It’s done. I know you don’t want to see, but I really think you should.”
and transfigured a straw, blushing furiously under Harry’s intense gaze as he helped him drink. Setting it aside when he finished, Draco studied the starched sheets and let the silence stretch between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, no,” Harry insisted, spinning his body to face him.
“Firstly,” Draco said once the chuckles faded, “the Goblet gave
Waving his wand around the room, additional seats appeared as he invited them to sit and eat. “I noticed some of you were absent at breakfast. I imagine you’re hungry. Don’t be shy, help yourselves.”
“Yes, Master Snape, sir?” she asked with a quick bob of her knees.
“Very good,” Severus replied blandly, employing all of his skill as a spy to mask his amusement. “Come to me immediately if either you or Potter need anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Shame filled Draco and trickled through the bond, prompting Harry to squeeze tighter. Merlin, Draco didn’t deserve this boy. Harry was far too good for him and he was certain when he came clean, he’d lose any chance at a romantic soul bond, but after all they shared he couldn’t lie to Harry now.
“Draco first, and then the rest of Slytherin House,” Harry said.
The Slytherins exchanged worried glances, but dread coiled viselike in Draco’s stomach when his godfather’s mournful eyes locked onto Harry’s calculating gaze.
“Hmph,” Theo huffed. “How does that help? Stirring the pot with ambiguity? Useless old codger.”
spells in the darkened corners to be certain they were alone before the pair walked to the wall.
“I know I don’t have to, but do you
was what Harry thanked Fawkes for healing? If so, it meant the rumours of something disastrous happening in the Chamber of Secrets were true. Harry nearly died protecting the school at twelve years old! Bile coursed hot up Draco’s throat when he realized just what Harry accused the Headmaster of in his office. Dumbledore
“No, he’s still asleep. I checked a little bit ago,” Theo said. “We’re all here, Draco. Now tell us what the bloody hell this is about.”
“How’d you do it?” Ron demanded, fists clenching reflexively at his side.
“Not tonight. Thank you, Uncle.”
Blushing, Hermione ducked her head. “You don’t have to tell me, of course, but he’s my friend and I don’t want him to get hurt. You understand, Malfoy, don’t you?”
“This explains so much,” Pansy mumbled, massaging her temples.
All these years his pulse quickened and his lungs clenched whenever Malfoy’s attention fell on him, he’d stupidly attributed to hatred. Now he realized it was another feeling entirely. As he stood so close to the man who drove him up the blasted wall with his quick wit and sharp tongue, he finally recognized the pull as desire. An attraction buried so deep under layers of confusion and centuries-long House rivalry that he’d never have dug it out without such a raw moment between them to yank his head out of his arse.
“Very well. One last thing, will either of you require a sleeping draught tonight?” he asked, pulling a set of brilliant blue potions from his robes. Draco declined, but Harry accepted gratefully.
“Does it feel like it might mean...everything?” Draco asked uncertainly, closing the distance between them. Harry nodded, neck turning pink when he peered at him through dark lashes, and Draco’s heart stopped.
Despite the dishevelled state of Draco’s lustrous hair and the panic in his eyes, he was blindingly beautiful. While Harry, in an ironic role reversal, looked like a prisoner of war as opposed to a hero with his malnourished frame and tattered clothes.
Lifting a hand to halt her tirade, Dumbledore sighed. “He is not wrong, Minerva.”
The Hall exploded into furious whispers the moment Dumbledore sat down, while hatred emanated from the Gryffindor table like a heatwave.
Appraising him coolly, she whispered, “May I remind you the curse is bound to whomever Harry loves, not the other way around, which means the person kissing him doesn’t have to be in love with him.”
“You better,” Draco choked, blinking away a fresh onslaught of tears. With a sad smile and a parting squeeze of his hand, Harry hustled out of the office without a backward glance.
“Eat up, darling,” Pansy encouraged, tapping his fork with a manicured nail.
The girl cocked her head and dipped into an effortless curtsy. Harry blinked, uncertain what he should do, but Blaise leaned close and whispered, “Bow, but not too low.”
Yes, she quite liked this Malfoy, and she wanted to help him. Whether or not he woke Harry, she would extend him an offer to join the Order to escape his father. Though she was certain he was the key to Harry’s problem, she fully expected them to be idiots about the whole situation.
Draco nodded in solemn understanding, wishing he could smother the anxious boy in a hug. “Ready to call it a night?”
Thank you all once again for your comments and kudos and subscriptions! The response to this story has been beyond my wildest dreams. Love you all!
Clearing his throat in embarrassment, Draco said, “Thank you, sir. What about my parents?”
His hand shot out and snagged Draco’s wrist before he could second-guess himself and tugged him wordlessly onto the bed. Draco gulped but followed the motion without complaint. Staying on top of the duvet, he closed the distance between them, all too aware Harry could hear his pounding heart when he burrowed against his chest.
Could they bury the hatchet and have a genuine connection? Since entering the world of magic and learning about the soulmark that began appearing when he turned eleven, he dreamed of the special person who would love him for
“Yes, Mione,” he replied curtly, a twinge of regret twisting under his ribs as his friends winced at his tone. Sighing heavily, Harry shoved his glasses up and rubbed his eyes wearily. “I’m sorry if I sound cross, I’m just tired from Dumbledore’s lessons. I know you both care and I appreciate it, but sometimes I need to breathe.”
“It’s bad, isn’t it?” Harry asked.
The reaction was instant.
“I’ll be back.” Hesitating with his hand over the knob, Harry stared at the stone floor and gathered his courage. “Please stay,” he whispered, chancing a peek at his host. “I’ll feel better if you do.”
“It’s brilliant, guys! Thanks,” Harry enthused while studying his updated look in Pansy’s compact mirror. The Slytherins traded secret smiles, assuming he missed Draco’s blush, but Harry wasn’t going to admit the sight of a flustered Draco made his pulse race.
“Shit,” Goyle grunted in the apprehensive stillness.
“Hear, hear,” the others murmured. Harry smirked around his fork at their indignation but straightened when Snape marched toward him.
Without another word, their professor led them out of the open to the hospital wing. As they neared the infirmary, Harry resisted the urge to clutch Draco’s hand to ease the knot growing in his gut. Inside the hushed ward, Severus directed them to a bed and drew the curtains.
“Ice mice,” she said curtly to the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s sanctum. As soon as the wall slid open, she marched up the stairs, fully expecting the others to follow. Theo and Draco shared an excited look, having never been granted access to the Headmaster’s office. Harry and Snape hid their smiles at their enthusiasm, dutifully trailing after McGonagall.
“Alright Harry, you’ve heard them all swear fealty. Come out, you eavesdropping prat.”
“It’s Saturday night. I usually spend an hour with Uncle Sev.” Draco grinned at his surprise. “Snape is my godfather. We sit, we drink, we whinge about the week. It’s really quite boring most nights, but it’s a habit and I hate to disappoint him.”
Dumbledore cleared his throat, and Harry reluctantly released Draco’s hand as he reclaimed his seat. “There is another option available to us,” he said, fixing Harry with a meaningful look.
“I will,” Draco promised. “Get some sleep.”
Once they were clear of Dumbledore’s office, Severus drawled, “Another twenty points to Slytherin for Mr. Potter’s recommendation of Veela hair in the Beautification potion. Mr. Malfoy, do let me know what you learn with the substitution.”
Draco’s mouth fell open. “You knew?” Dumbledore nodded again as the boys sputtered. “How?”
“The Headmaster sent me, sir.” Snape arched a brow in a silent entreaty to hurry the explanation along. “Harry is expected to meet with the other Champions in his office, sir,” he said in a rush.
“This is one for the books,” Draco stated with conviction. “Generations of cursebreakers and potion masters will study the twins’ poisoned apple until someone finally cracks how they work in combination so effectively.”
“It may have come to your attention that we’ve had a student change Houses.”
He struggled to comprehend what could have possessed Albus to do such a thing to any child, much less the hero of the damned wizarding world. Maybe the old coot assumed that as Harry was her nephew—the sole piece of her sister—she would at least be kind. Instead, she treated him abominably. Severus knew firsthand what a horrid woman Petunia was, and it seemed inconceivable she found a man who was even worse, yet she’d done just that. And Harry spent his formative years with them.
A voice he vaguely recognized broke through the hysteria flaring along his synapses like wildfire. He couldn't place it in his current state, but it was calm and kind, soothing his scattered nerves like a cooling balm.
His dark eyes were intent and firm, but for the first time in his life, Harry didn’t bristle under Snape’s gaze when he saw the warmth he normally kept hidden. Draco smothered a laugh as Harry glimpsed his godfather, Severus, not the surly dungeon bat he pretended to be. Squeezing his hand to snap the boy out of his stupefaction, Harry returned the action with a lopsided smile that liquified Draco’s insides.
In an unconscious need for reassurance, Harry patted the dragon on his chest, noting Draco’s subtle shiver with interest. Chancing a peek at the boy standing stiff in front of him and avoiding his gaze, Harry’s stomach filled with butterflies at the rosy tint suffusing his cheeks.
“Oh, dear,” the former Headmaster muttered as the once-proud scion of House Malfoy crumpled to the floor and wept.
“I’m sorry.”
“Now that the Champions have been chosen —” His statement cut off abruptly as the Goblet flared a fourth time.
Glancing at the blond, he realized he’d never seen Draco Malfoy without his mask until today. He’d risked his life to reveal his true colours that night in the woods, but the trust in Draco’s decision to let Harry see him without it
A familiar flare of anger burned in the hollowed part of Harry’s soul—a pit formed by the rejection, and bullying, and neglect of so many in his life. Honestly, why had he expected Dumbledore would be any different? Was the grandfatherly act just that? A ploy to get closer to a boy he shipped off to an abusive family every summer after another year risking his life? Had he ever really cared about Harry, and if so, when had that changed? What was the ulterior motive?
Fleur pinned her ice-blue eyes on her cousin. “I do not understand ‘ogwarts politics, but I feel dat iz significant.”
“Hey, breathe with me. In and out, in and out,” Harry encouraged on a loop as the other man mimicked him in stilted, wheezing pants. “That’s it, baby. Keep breathing for me. In and out, you’re doing great.”
Shoving them to the door with a grin, Draco said, “Right you lot, get out so the man of the hour can put some clothes on. If you’re not ready to go in twenty minutes, Pansy dear, I’m leaving you.”
“Harry Potter is too good for the likes of Dobby! Dobby is not deserving of his kindness!” The elf wailed, and Harry soothed him with a wince. He forgot how a simple show of compassion overwhelmed the poor thing.
Closing the gap between them, Draco said, “Harry, you know I’ll always have your back and support you however you need.”
love him, but if he doesn’t love you back, he’s gonna keep napping,” Fred finished with a grimace. “Sorry, sis,” he mumbled as he hopped off the table.
Floating closer with a shy smile, Harry murmured, “Your opinion is the only one I care about, Dragon.”
“I like it,” Draco said, halting Harry’s stilted movements as he breezed into the room. “Blaise did a good job with that bird’s nest on your head.”
No one commented on the easy use of his given name as Draco stood and led them to dinner, but the others shared intrigued glances as they trailed after the two former rivals.
,” Harry snarled at the older wizard, “but that is precisely why I’m rejecting your proposal. Draco has been
Harry’s breath caught with the reminder that the others in the room had firsthand knowledge of the opposing side. Willing his racing heart to slow, he told himself they were all children and Draco admitted he didn’t uphold his father’s views—he wouldn’t share this information with them if they weren’t posturing, too.
Deciding it was time for a little honesty of his own, Draco said, “I know it’s hard to believe, but I never wanted to be your enemy. I didn’t even know who you were in Madam Malkins, after all.” Sighing regretfully, he continued, “This may surprise you, but I don’t exactly have...experience making friends, so I went about it all wrong.”
before he could protest. Though, once the water hit his parched tastebuds, he realized it was exactly what he needed.
Melting around him, Draco whispered, “I’m going to take care of you, Harry. I want to give you everything because you deserve no less, and I promise you’ll never be alone again. Whatever comes, we deal with together.”
Harry hummed as he plopped on his trunk at the foot of the bed, now bearing a “Potter” nameplate, and absently toed off his shoes and shrugged off his jumper. Draco had the sheets turned down when he stood and his stomach fluttered at the gesture. It spoke volumes about Draco’s thoughtfulness and his cheeks warmed under the blond’s soft gaze, feeling exposed in his trousers and a faded t-shirt as he settled on the bed.
Count on a Slytherin to recognize when someone had been set up.
“Come again?” Pansy quipped, earning a mutinous glare from both boys while the rest of them smothered their amusement in their tea.
“Shit, I’m sorry. I didn’t know he was shy,” Theo grimaced.
“This information will elicit a craze in the castle tomorrow. Remember that Mr. Potter is one of us now and it is not just the duty of his immediate friends within Slytherin to protect him, but it is up to
Rolling his shoulders to dislodge his lingering agitation, Draco crossed the kitchen and settled near Harry, careful to keep a bit of space between them so he wouldn’t bolt.
“You don’t have to —” Harry started, but Draco cut him off, not unkindly.
Memories of gentle grey eyes and warm laughter danced through his mind, and he pressed a palm over his racing heart to calm the traitorous muscle that skipped multiple beats when Draco declared him “mine” to the entirety of Slytherin House. Rolling over with a muffled groan, Harry buried his head under the silk sheets and intentionally slowed his breathing until his tired body overrode his brain and gave in to the pull of sleep.
“I bet Dumbledore let him,” spat Seamus. “Always been the Headmaster’s favourite. Wonder why that is?”
“Okay, I won’t tell you,” he replied slyly. “Ow!” he cried when Ginny punched his arm.
“Of course, Pansy,” he smiled.
Tugging gently on his shoulder, Draco jerked his head to the hall leading to the dorms. “Come along, Potter. We’ve things to discuss.” Harry followed without complaint, inclining his head to those who tipped theirs or smiled politely as he passed.
Guilt hit Draco like a thousand searing knives and judging by Harry’s wide eyes and the hand clutching his shirt as he gawped at him, he felt it, too. Swallowing his pride, Draco nodded solemnly. “I promise, Harry. For what it’s worth…I
Entering the kitchen, he was met with a room that mimicked the Great Hall in size and layout. House elves rushed to and fro as silverware polished itself and dishes travelled in an orchestrated dance of wash, rinse, dry, put away. Removing the cloak with wide eyes, Harry stared in fascination at the behind-the-scenes hustle and bustle of the castle.
Severus paused with his glass halfway to his mouth. Oh, his godson was clever and devious and rarely wrong. The more he considered the possibility, the more obvious it became someone was acting on orders. Draco was right—Potter could not have engineered this. He was targeted.
Studying the enigmatic man next to him, Draco realized there was so much about him he didn’t know despite their years of school, but he desperately wanted to. Snippets of the past six years danced across Draco’s mind: detentions, hallway duels, Quidditch matches, Tri-Wizard tournament tasks, the Inquisitorial Squad hunting down the DA.
