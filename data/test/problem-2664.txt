With each and every season that graced the castle came a display of pure excellency. Summer comes in her own time, drifting in on a spring wind, wakening with the kind of warmth that flows to the core. Between the paving stones comes blooms so bold and tall, giving off their aroma to the now summer-infused breeze. For these seeds of humble size and hue are the ninjas of the botanical world, born to shout loud of their graffiti-petaled beauty.

He shrugged, ‘fighting with Potter, Room of Requirement, poof magical kid,’ he bit out harshly.
Draco sat miserably on the small ledge, by the familiar window. He looked out into the distance; his mind trapped in many a thoughts. He watched intently as a single leaf fell from its place on the tree, swishing and dancing before it landed on the cold ground with a loud
when he was met with the blazing green eyes of Harry Potter, because
After that, he quickly left the room, not giving Potter the chance to answer back.
‘You cawlled my Papa Stuwpid,’ he bit out, clutching his fork fiercely, ‘an’ I don’ like meanies.’
‘I think it’s time we made a move,’ Potter stated, gesturing to the overflowing trolly.
, Scorpius had other plans.
Two small hands began to hit his chest, ‘I wanna see Daddy,’ he screamed.
Draco had always felt such feelings for Potter. No one could tell him differently. He remembered the first time that he’d heard the name Harry Potter. He’d been in the drawing room back at the manor, painting a picture of his family, when he’d overheard his father speak about a boy that had survived an AK. A boy that was his own age. Draco had known then and there that he wanted to be friends with Harry Potter.
Slowly, Draco racked long fingers through the boy’s soft hair, he shook his head, ‘shhh’ he told him gently, ‘you didn’t do anything, I promise.’
He rolled his eyes, ready to berate his cocky friend when there was a loud crash from beside him. Panicked, Draco turned around, to find that there was nothing there except from a half-eaten plate.
… He wouldn’t give that up for the world.
Draco closed his eyes, sighed yet again, and stood up. He couldn’t believe he was about to do what he was thinking of doing.
Potter narrowed his yes at Draco. ‘
For a startling moment, Draco had forgotten how to speak. His fights with Potter were anything

do you think you’re going,’ Potter spat to his retreating back.
‘WHAT!?’ Both he and Potter screamed, but their objections were ignored.
Again, the boy shook his head defiantly, ‘no.’ he barked out.
Potter did make an appearance, he wouldn’t look twice at Draco. No, Potter was friends with everyone. He was charming, funny, accepting, and the world just gravitated towards him. Why on earth would he talk to Draco of
No, Draco had replied, and by doing that he’d opened up a can of worms. Now, they’d had a conversation. A
‘You shut up, Malfoy,’ the Gryffindor bit back in challenge, and he was ready to snap out something witty when Scorpius reached over, slapping Potter on the arm.
‘Couldn’t have been much more than I’ve been exposed to this past day,’ he replied absently, certain that he had bared the brunt of Scorpius’ wrath and tantrums.

The boy stuck his tongue out at his friend, ‘Uncle Bwaise, you tis a lot meaner twoday dan usual,’ he chided and Draco snorted.

‘Malfoy’s don’t dance,’ Draco repeated curtly, his stomach twisting uncomfortably.
‘I don’t know,’ she rubbed her chin thoughtfully, ‘maybe you could have answered with a simple
Dumbledore coughed, and Draco turned to look at him. ‘I’m sure that you both agree that your public display earlier was unacceptable.’ He told them pointedly.
What rolled from his tongue next were four words that he’d never imagined himself to say, ‘take me to him,’ he whispered confidently.
‘Whatever do you mean?’ he asked her, feigning innocence, whilst secretly praying that she’d deem him a lost cause and permit him to slither out of their plans.
‘I’m not going,’ he crossed his arms in defiance, and Pansy glared.
‘I’m sorry,’ Pansy said dejectedly and he knew that she was berating herself for not being able to fix it.
Be rational Draco, there’s hundreds of people here, someone would’ve seen it happen.
Blaise’s mouth hung open, whilst Pansy looked as if she were going to faint. That wasn’t
He stood up abruptly, Death Eater’s didn’t deserve nice things.
They’d been screaming back and fourth at one another ever since Draco had demanded that the boy got ready. According to Scorpius he was tired and wanted to sleep more. Draco had scoffed at that, as if a four-year-old little menace were going to tell Draco Malfoy what to do. No, he’d been determined to stand his ground until the boy had relented.

‘My father is dead,’ he began quietly, hit with a realisation so fierce he was certain that he’d fall, ‘I
‘So, what are we supposed to do about it?’
The boy shook his head before smiling happily, ‘that dwsen’t mawwer, at least I ave Papa,’ he beamed and before Draco knew it, tiny arms were wrapping around his waist.
Abruptly, he stood up and made way for the door, shutting it carefully behind him. It was only a matter of time before Scorpius would be returned to wherever he came from, and until then it was Draco’s job to appropriately cater for the boy, nothing more, nothing less.
Potter’s face fell, ‘those people are sociopaths. Are
‘We are
‘Daddy!’ Scorpius huffed out in frustration.
The stubborn little Gryffindor didn’t look as if he was backing down anytime soon. Once again, Draco found himself relenting, as he slammed his hands onto the table below. It had barely been fourteen hours and Draco was already thinking about giving up. Hell, he

They were right; he never stood a chance. He never would.
There was no way in hell he was doing this again. Frantically, he fell to his knees, putting his hands gently on Scorpius’ shoulders, desperate to calm the boy.
Potter snorted, ‘just trying to be a decent
The boy looked down at his ring in admiration, before lifting up a small finger so that Draco could get a closer look. His long black eyelashes fluttered as he beamed proudly, ‘m’ don’t member, but you tells me to always kweep it on.’

‘We won’t be seeing anymore of Scorpius for the time being,’ he told her absently, as he pulled his wand for his pocket. The long stick was thrust between his hands as he tried to avert his attention anywhere but Pansy’s burning gaze.

‘Make me.’

Weasley smacked his lips. ‘What about second year, I threw up slugs because you -’
‘No bloody way!’ Draco snapped at the mop of black hair that was currently attacking his legs, ‘I’ve got a life kid. Like
Pansy shrugged lightly, ‘I don’t know, but it is.’
He was about to retort back when his eyes stopped on Weasley’s plate. It looked monstrous, pilled with sausages, eggs, toast, and bacon. He had a bowl of fruit on his left, pumpkin cake to his right, and that wasn’t even mentioning the plate of chicken at his front.
‘I didn’t,’ he shrugged, smacking his lips in triumph, ‘you just told me.’
‘You’re different Malfoy.’
Picking Scorpius up carefully, he pulled back the covers, and put him under snugly. The boy twitched slightly, and Draco absently reached out a hand, running it soothingly through black curls. They stayed like that for a few minutes before Draco pulled his hand back as if burned, finally conscious of what he was doing.
Feeling guilty, Draco gave him a small nudge before taking a sweet from the bowl. He smiled, ‘would you like one?’
‘AUNT PANSY?’ She rounded on Draco, and it was then where he knew that he’d messed up. ‘PAPA?!’ she shrilled incredulously.

‘I want you to admit dat you wuv my Daddy.’ He announced after several minutes and Draco sucked in a large breath. Anything. He’d do virtually anything but that. He had standards and announcing his love for a most likely imaginary character was not his idea of standards.
‘Erm Harry, Malfoy I really think that you both should—

IS THAT?’
Once he had deterred from his conscious mind, he returned his gaze back onto an infuriating Pansy, ‘last time I’d checked, Potter’s cock hasn’t been anywhere near my arse,’ he bit back maliciously.
Draco growled as he persisted to drag the exhausted body through the room, ‘if you’d be so kind as to remove your grubby hands from my hair Potter, that would be

Grey eyes never left green as he said, ‘I’m waiting Potter. Tell me, what do you really think you’re going to do?’
‘Really?’ she raised an amused brow, ‘because the drool on your chin and the boner in your lap says differently,’ Pansy declared triumphantly.
Just as he’d predicted, the little kid started to brawl, big wet tears now staining his cheeks. ‘Are you okay?’ he asked concerned, slowly approaching the quivering figure. He crouched down next to him, tending to the blood that had already stained the floor.
‘But I
‘No.’
‘Wouldn’t you like to know,’ he spat out whilst cutting up a few pieces of bacon. He glared at Potter, ‘Do you want to explain why you didn’t get off your arse and help?’
But in the autumn, you watch powerlessly as life slowly succumbs to an inevitable death. Draco hates it. The flowers falter, the grass turns grey, as the world preps for its eventual demise. At least in the winter, the worst is over, but in the autumn it’s yet to come. You’re trapped watching the life drain from the earths eyes, and there’s nothing one can do to prevent it.
to be kidding him.
That’s when Draco knew. As he was slowly bleeding out, praying that that he would succumb to the darkness, he realised that he and Potter would never work. He’d been a gullible fool.
She shrugged, ‘he doesn’t acknowledge me much either.’
‘NO.’

‘Draco…’ Pansy started worriedly.
Draco should just save himself the trouble, he should mumble a flimsy excuse to Pansy and be done with it. The heartache wasn’t worth it, he didn’t even think his heart could take it. He’d been stuck between caring too little and caring too much for a long time, and now…
‘The boys will head out to buy Scorpius here some new clothes, of course,’ Dumbledore said simply. ‘I’m sure that you will all agree that what is best for the child is that we present a united front. Which is why, as of tonight, Mr Potter will be joining Mr Malfoy and little Scorpius in the Slytherin dorm.’
Draco couldn’t help the eyeroll that escaped his grasp, ‘that’s what being drunk means, Potter.’
Potter rolled his eyes, as he fastened Scorpius into the trolley chair. ‘We’re leaving.’ He said simply.

‘It’s not like you didn’t deserve it! And fourth year - ’
Collecting himself, Draco gave Potter a sharp look, ‘you seem to have taken to parenthood quickly,’ he couldn’t help but comment.

! Stop acting like children,’ she ordered them.
Granger rolled her eyes fondly, ‘I doubt that such a crime serves to be of any importance,’ she told him smugly.
‘No.’
‘What are you saying?’ Potter asked.
Potter looked positively pale and Draco felt an ounce of sympathy for the Gryffindor, it had only been three measly days since Snape had screamed at him in a similar fashion.
‘You really are an idiot,’ she told him as she shoved a piece of chicken into her fat gob.
If Draco really dwelled over it, he could come to the conclusion that he was the leaf and the leaf was he. A leaf once full of so much life, the world at its feet as it believed that anything was possible. Now it lay silently on the ground, it’s wonder diminished, it’s hopes crushed, the life drained from its core.

He allowed his gaze to flicker onto Potter, he was running a dazed hand through raven locks, blinking rapidly as if it were all but a dream. Potter looked down at the small boy, hesitantly extending a hand and running it through messy hair. Something within him snapped at the gesture and he turned to face the boy on the other end of Potter’s simple touch.
Draco was dismayed when Potter came to sit down next to them, he was hoping that he’d fallen down the stairs or something. Well, a fella could dream…
‘I’m not sure. You’re confusing. You talk to your friends like they’re real
‘You always says dat Papa ooks beauwtiful when he cwries,’ he gestured towards Draco, who then looked down locking his gaze onto Potter’s.
‘Shut up Blaise,’ he turned around not even giving Blaise the chance to answer. He crept up the stairs, careful not to wake up a now sleeping Scorpius, Pansy following not so subtly behind. Pushing the door open, he entered his room, before plonking Scorpius onto the double bed.
Draco. He’d vowed that he would never set foot in a party-like scene as long as he was still in Hogwarts. But that had changed. Now, he was going to a party. He’d broken his rule for Potter.
Draco shrugged, ‘call me imbecilic, but wouldn’t a cleaning charm be a far more efficient way to rid yourself from that unseemly grease?’ he asked.
He watched Potter lovingly yet again, thread a hand through raven locks, and it chided him just how accepting Potter was of this mess. They had a

The words were like ice daggers to his heart, and Draco found himself heaving from the bed, and standing on the hard floor. Without as much as a second glance, Draco headed towards the doors.
Draco growled, ‘are you hungry or not?’ he snapped and the child nodded sulkily.
‘Good.’ He declared, and without another word picked Scorpius up, fastening him tightly onto his hip. He then quickly left the room, slamming the door forcefully behind him.
He looked between the two figures before him and nodded. It was hide time they saw Madam Pomfrey.

‘I don’t think those apples are ripe, Malfoy’ Potter said from behind him and Draco jumped dropping the apple at once.
And that’s why Draco hated autumn, for him it brought nothing but painful memories and death.
‘A chicken expert?’
Draco.
All had finally been well, until Draco had made way for the Slytherin table. According to Scorpius, the snakes weren’t good enough, no, he wanted to play with the lions. One lion in particular. In one quick motion, Scorpius had landed on his butt, arms crossed, face scrunched, demanding to be brought to his Daddy at once.
It seemed as though nothing could sway their decision, so at that, Draco bent down scooping Scorpius up in one move. The small child beamed, snuggling comfortably into his neck.
‘And what

He let out a long-defeated breath, ‘am I
Grades, assignments, and practical’s were rare, and even if they were assigned they seemed of unimportance. Still, Draco worked at it, spending endless nights in the library studying because we weren’t all Ravenclaws.
‘Can’t we go with you?’ Pansy asked in an oddly excited tone, which confused him greatly. She couldn’t be- no, that wasn’t possible. He studied her carefully and sure enough her pupils were blow and her grin was wide. She was beaming at the small child. How typical.
He was convinced that he would do anything for Potter at this point. He’d go to the ends of the earth just to see a genuine smile upon his face. He’d abstain from his title, just so that he could be with him. Draco would fight for him, kill for him, fight
Several moments later and he returned his attention back onto an amused Dumbledore. The old man ran a hand through the bowl smirking knowingly. ‘You can never go wrong with a sherbet lemon,’ he mused and by the joyful look on Scorpius face, Draco decided that he wasn’t wrong,
Draco nodded solemnly as a small chirper voice perked up, ‘Papa?’ Scorpius asked hesitantly and Draco begrudgingly turned towards him.
have taken him.
Draco looked down at his masterpiece. The bread was all different sizes, the butter barely coating each one. The ham and lettuce hardly fit between the two slabs. The tomato was sprawled out messily atop of the bread. And where the fuck was the cucumber? Some may call it a disaster, Draco called it progress.

was saying something.
‘For an atrocious part of society, you sure do have a hard on for Tesco.’
‘Yes, yes Weasley the world is coming to an end,’ he mumbled out distractedly, ‘Granger,’ he sent a curt not her way.
‘I’m not drooling, and I don’t want to fuck Potter,’ he spat out just a little too loudly.
he looked good. But it didn’t all that much matter because no one would notice him. A bit like how one would notice a tree in passing, it was acknowledged, but no one stopped to touch it.
Trust him, he asked himself that question every day. Why was Potter the last thing he thought about at night, and the first name on his lips each morning? What was
‘But my magical signature isn’t on there.’ He pointed out defiantly.
The walk to Gryffindor tower was a quiet one and apart from a few scattered looks, there wasn’t much attention on the pair. It was probably due to the fact that many of the younger years were still in classes, but honestly he didn’t care all that much.
! The late-night exchanges they had, were nothing compared to this. Potter never remembered those. But this he would remember. He would look back on their small interaction and think… ‘Malfoy is a right jerk.’
‘You have a
This sudden surge of protectiveness over the child had him alarmed, he hadn’t the foggiest idea as to where it’d sprung from. It was impulsive. All he was certain of was that he didn’t want Potter anywhere near Scorpius.
The breath from his lungs faded as green eyes bore into grey. He could briefly remember Scorpius mentioning the same line back in the room of requirement, he hadn’t played too much attention to it. He hadn’t thought it of significance, but now, as he looked into unreadable green, Draco had an inkling that one line was of a greater importance than he could ever imagine.
He narrowed his eyes. ‘Mine.’ Draco growled, snatching the device right back.
enjoy being screamed at.
They continued to make their way through the store and Draco was fascinated by a small square. It was green, Slytherin green to be exact and it was fascinating. He clicked the little button and was amazed to see the little flame burst out. His hand just ached to reach out and…
‘I never
that you’re prepared to throw out a paper towel laced with evidence at the scene of the crime.’
‘Tell me Weasley,’ he picked up his somewhat finished sandwich before walking closer towards him. ‘what were you planning on doing with the paper towel?’
The winter is such crystalline joy, those brilliant rays that show the uniqueness of every snowflake. Where puddles become transient skating rinks, when the sunniest of days ignites a chill where one can see their breath rise as neat and pure vapour. It is the days of quiet poetry forming in souls as if it calls to the spring flowers that will soon blossom.
‘Well it sure as hell isn’t me.’ Draco shrugged, he gave Potter a pointed look, ‘besides, you were the one that demanded we come to this atrocious part of society.’
Draco didn’t say anything, as he felt a single tear escape from his grasp and roll innocently down his cheek.

‘Whether you’re going to be a good or terrible father isn’t the most pressing issue right now,’ she gave his hand as small squeeze, ‘right now, there’s a boy out there who’s probably scared shitless that his father isn’t with him. Whether he’s yours, Potter’s, or just a potion gone wrong, it’s up to you to make sure that Scorpius knows that he’s safe.’

Smith gave him a small smile, looking at the ground which apparently was of great interest to him. ‘I was wondering if… maybe… you’d want to dance?’ he stammered out shyly, ‘with me,’ he added as an afterthought.
Draco dwelled over the entire interaction for the rest of the day: playing different scenarios in his head over and over again in an endless loops. When Potter had said, ‘sorry Malfoy,’  he could’ve just nodded before continuing on his merry little way. A nod would’ve been

Scorpius chuckled as he became particularly fixed on a very large watermelon. Draco payed him no mind in favour of selecting a few delectable green apples.
‘I’m inclined to believe that Albus, Minerva, Severus, and myself will attempt to find a viable solution to your little problem.’ Her eyes darted between the boys in acute seriousness, ‘in the meantime, I suggest you both cater to the boy until further notice.’ She finished.
Sure enough, in a matter of seconds, big fat tears started to fall from wide eyes. If they hadn’t been a tourist attraction before, he was almost certain of that fact now.
Blaise put his hands up in surrender, ‘Okay, okay. All I’m saying is one magical night together and you’ll forget all—

Personally, Draco thought that Severus looked fabulous with purple hair, his godfather hadn’t agreed.
‘DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT I WON’T DO IT BECAUSE I WIL—
At long last, the wailing stopped as Scorpius finally noticed Draco standing there. ‘PAPA!’ He screamed happily as he ran across the room clumsily, burying his face in Draco’s robes.
absmayl in the autumn.
wif you Daddy,’ he clutched onto Potter with a harsher ferocity.
‘Follow me.’ He told the small boy. Draco turned and went about eight feet before he heard a small thud. Groaning inwardly, he turned around and saw that the boy had face planted. He brought a hand up to his nose, only to pull it away bloody. Draco, braced himself, expecting terrified screams. He had been absolutely petrified at the sight of blood when we were younger, he thought it mandatory for any young kid to be.
Draco growled before following her lead, they’d already seen him anyhow. Leaving would be far too obvious at this point. He felt his insides twist uncomfortably as he neared the couple, he’d plan Pansy’s unfortunate murder later.
‘I always thought you hated roleplay Harry,’ Thomas wiggled his eyebrows suggestively expecting a snappy answer, Potter on the other hand, simply shoved his reddened face into his hands. Coward.
The door swung open and Draco was met with a seething Harry Potter, red faced and wand in hand. He rolled his eyes, exiting the common room, entering the hallway, and shutting the door firmly behind him.
He said it anyway, ‘sod off, Potter,’ he spat unkindly before returning his gaze to the window.
Draco blinked, before he looked out on the sea of people – no one was looking.
Potter shared a secret look with Dumbledore before gesturing towards his floo, ‘we’re going to Muggle London,’ he exclaimed.
It would be

The occurrence inside the room of requirement hadn’t left his mind since he’d feast eyes on the boy. The circumstances in which the kid had appeared unsettled him greatly. The Room was known for granting what one needed, and what if Draco needed…
‘Ah of course, how could I forget?’ he joked, taking a swing from the glass in his hand. Draco watched hungrily as a few drops rolled down his chin, sliding down his neck slowly. He felt his head grow heavy with want as he forced his gaze away.
At that point Draco realised that he was fighting a losing battle, so instead of carrying on, he ran a tired hand through his hair and sighed. ‘Fine,’ he told him as he bent his head down so that his breath was gently fanning a small ear.
‘How in Salazar’s name did you find chicken this early into the morning?’ he incredulously asked the red head.
‘Eat.’
Pansy let out an annoyed huff, ‘I don’t know
‘I didn’t do anything.’ Weasley said quickly, as he suck a piece of chicken behind his back.

got attacked by a bloody Hippogriff.’
‘Come on then, boy-Scorpius.’ The name was  foreign on his tongue and would take a lot of getting used to. Not that he was going to be talking to him much – he was going to take the boy to Dumbledore and that would be that. ‘I guess that means for me to carry you.’
It was out. What he’d always wanted to say but had never had the will too. Perhaps, he had some of Potter’s courage after all.
‘The Malfoy family ring?’ Pansy asked after several moments of silence. She shook her head before speaking again, ‘but the only way he’d have that is if…’ she trailed off and Draco nodded solemnly, standing up once more.
The defiant look on the infant’s face almost made him regret following after him.
Pansy took a deep breath, reaching out so that her hand was atop of his, ‘if you still don’t believe him to be your child, then you really are daft darling.’ She carried on after a small sigh, ‘but even if he wasn’t, Scorpius believes himself to be, shouldn’t that be enough?’
‘I can detest to that.’
His friend hummed softly at the revelation, and Draco turned to face her completely baffled. He quirked a frustrated brow, ‘what? No, how the fuck is Harry Potter the father of your supposed child, or how could you be so stupid as to let Potter anywhere near your pert arse?’
Wait... a guilt ridden Weasley?
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, like hell was he going to win this game. Draco had bloody created the damn game!
He narrowed his eyes, ‘
Draco was about to say something to Dumbledore about the only unpleasantry here being Potter when the door opened and both Snape and McGonagall strode in, each looking more livid than the next. ‘HARRY JAMES POTTER!’ McGonagall roared. Draco flinched looking at Snape, but Severus just stood there glaring at him. Did Potter seriously put up with this
Draco’s eyes darted towards the pair; they looked a perfect picture. Potter’s large hand threading through raven-locks, Scorpius nuzzling into the touch. The boy looked the epitome of
‘He’s not my son,’ Draco snapped out automatically.
Draco cleared his throat, looking down defeatedly at the small hand, ‘it’s the Malfoy family ring,’ he answered, ‘it’s infused with magic so pure that only a Malfoy by blood or marriage would be able to bare it.’ he took a deep breath before carrying on, ‘The wearer can be no other than the first-born son of the current Lord Malfoy.’
He glared at the smug boy, ‘did you just

into a ferret.’
‘What the
Scorpius was still wrapped around Potter’s legs, showing no sign of letting go. His eyes were firmly glued shut, but if you were to look closer, which Draco did, you could see the hot tears dusting his cheeks. It were as if the child had spent years looking, and now finally salvation had found him.
They both huffed, crossing their arms gruffly not at all trying to hide the death glares that they were sending one another.
He was halfway towards the doors, when a deafening cry echoed throughout the room, halting him in his tracks. In a blink of an eye, two tiny arms had wrapped themselves around his legs, a tear streaked face buried into his robes.
He rounded on Pansy, shooting her a sharp glare, ‘you sneaky little minx!’
He gave her hand a small squeeze, ‘it’s not your fault,’ he whispered reassuringly.
So what did y'all think?
. He’d originally carried out his task with pride, he thought that he was helping his father. Then the Dark Lord had threatened to kill his mother… it had all changed.
‘Don’t say dat word!’ the boy whispered frantically.
Pansy shook her head carefully as she sighed, ‘maybe,’ she told him softly, ‘but that someone doesn’t have to be you.’
With on last flick, Draco stood up and made his way out of the dorm. ‘Nighty night,’ Potter’s sleepy voice whispered, and Draco couldn’t stop the grin that spread across his face.
It was a wonder that he’d managed to kill the Dark Lord at all, you could hear him coming from a mile away. Potter still being alive was nothing short of a miracle.
Draco elbowed him in the ribs.
Draco picked him up and settled him safely on his hip, stunned at how heavy the small boy was. He pulled out his wand, muttering a quick cleaning spell before proceeding out of the room.
‘I’m not even going to

Except, Draco wouldn’t do that. He didn’t have Potter’s courage. No, he was currently grimacing at his reflection, his oldest and most worn robes clung to his skin. His hair was a mess upon his head, his smile non-existent.
Scorpius shook his head, looking up with innocent eyes, ‘no, I blewif a waspberry!’
He gave Pansy a teasing smile, ‘when did you become so smart?’ he asked her curiously.
He shook his head determinedly.
Weasley nodded, ‘you really

The war had changed many things, bigotries and prejudices were abolished. Those who fought for the wrong side were forgiven, but their actions were not forgotten. They weren’t treated as outcasts as such but weren’t exactly deemed to be of significance either. The above didn’t much matter to Draco, he pretended that he wasn’t there anyhow.
‘Where’s he sleeping,’ Blaise piped up, ‘had better not be the dormitories.’
Pansy followed suit, sprawling herself across that very sofa, resting her head in his lap. Draco brought a shaking hand out, threading it through her hair as he toyed with it mindlessly.
‘Malfoy, what the fu—’ Potter glanced at an oblivious Scorpius before continuing, ‘fudge was that about?’
‘Well, maybe Daddy doesn’t want to see you!’ He snapped out, immediately regretting his words as Scorpius started to wail louder than he’d ever heard him.
‘Oh, do shut up Draco. If you don’t come, you’ll just be sitting up alone in your dorm waiting for Potter to walk in completely incoherent so you can put him to bed.’

Defeated, Draco collapsed onto the floor, doing nothing to stop the fresh tears that rolled down his cheeks.

Scorpius shook his head furiously as he clung onto Potter even tighter, ‘no.’
His friend sighed, before lifting up a hand and patting him gently on the back. ‘Oh Draco, you’re
Without a second look, he turned to leave, when a seething Pansy put a hand to his chest.
Defeated, Draco turned towards Weasley and said with gritted teeth, ‘sorry.’
. They’d joked; they’d spoken civilly, and now they were sitting peacefully enjoying each other’s company. Pansy would never believe this.
So, Potter was drunk. He was very, very drunk.
‘I must be drunk because Draco
‘Let’s get you back to Pansy, yeah?’ He asked and Draco nodded not trusting himself to speak.
Weasley looked at him dumbfounded, ‘of course I do you git. What’s it to you?’
Draco ignored him, swarming the kitchen in hopes of finding a late night, or should he say early morning snack. Tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, and ham. Delicious! He grabbed a freakishly long knife and began.
Draco shook his head, ‘I don’t think so.’ He told him slowly.
‘Why awe you so mad at Papa uncle Sevrus,’ The child’s voice was high, and Draco could see that he was shaking. The poor boy must be terrified at the greasy haired git screaming and galivanting bloody murder. Draco resisted the urge to run his hand through raven locks, wait a second,
Scorpius squirmed in his grip, as his face started to flush wildly, ‘ooo yes, daddy ‘as twld me all bout hogwawts. Tis where you met,’ he declared happily as he snuggled into the crook of Draco’s neck.
The music turned understated and slow, and Draco was certain that it had changed to match his mood. From the corner of his eye he saw Hannah Abbot rest her head on Longbottom’s shoulder, as he pulled her in closer. The act was so miniscule, but its meaning was large.
alone. Well, for now anyways.
The lights were bright, he hadn’t even considered that the common room would be full – there was barely any room to navigate. The music was an incoherent beat, scarring his ears, he had half a mind to down a shot – or two.
A small hand slammed onto his mouth and Draco let out a muffled shriek. He pulled away the hand, giving Scorpius a pointed look, ‘what was that for?’ he asked him.
‘I don’t know. His

‘Becoze Daddy tells me dat if I ave nofing nice to say, then I shouyldn’t say it,’ he crossed his arms one again, and Draco’s face was yet again attacked by an overwhelming amount of bodily fluid. He had no time to berate the child as he spoke again, ‘so I blewif an angwy waspberry at you.’
Potter scowled, ‘Why d’you have to be such a git, Malfoy?’ he slurred, taking yet another swing from his glass.
He couldn’t even get the words out; they were
He sneaked a glance at the Gryffindor table where Potter was having a very hushed and somewhat frustrated conversation with Granger. The git looked restless as Granger held his hand down whispering furiously. All Draco took from the peculiar scene was that help wasn’t coming any time soon.
Pansy giggled. ‘It looks as if all this talking has tired him out.’
‘Not this again Potter, how many times do I have to—
‘Why do you hate me so much?’ Potter asked somewhat defeatedly.
He gave Draco the biggest smile he’d seen from him yet, as he held his hands up waiting for his top to be put on. ‘Why didn’t yu jus say dat in de firs place.’ He asked Draco happily, after his top was on. Slytherin. The boy was one hundred percent Slytherin.
At once, the room erupted into a fit of giggles and laughs, with Finnegan doing a pretty impressive imitation of a hyena. Potter’s face was as red as he was sure his was, and at that, he briefly debated whether it was wrong to owl a child. A box with a few holes, and it would be done, no questions asked.
The words sprouting from the kids mouth were laughable. As if a Malfoy would willingly shack up with any of these ignoramus inbreds. It was unthinkable. He wasn’t going to tell the kid that though, he was finally quiet. No, silence was something to be savoured, especially since Dumbledore’s office was coming into view and he was certain to get an earful from a seething Head of House.
Draco rolled his eyes, ‘yes, it appears I do,’ he took yet another step towards the odd pair, ‘so, if you’d be so kind as to unhand him, that would be
‘Goodnight Potter.’ He muttered softly, before taking one last fond look at the sleeping figure, then shutting the door with a small tap.
‘No.’ he repeated.

‘Daddy..’ he trailed off, his eyes widening in realisation, ‘Malfoy, why is
transparent when it comes to Potter,’ she answered, and all it managed to do was make him feel worse.
Figuratively that was.
‘Look who it is,’ Pansy gestured to Weasley and Granger sitting comfortably on the sofa, whilst a group of eighth years danced drunkenly around them. ‘Why don’t we go and greet them.’
Unwanted images of Draco’s sixth year filtered through his mind. It was the year where he had lost everything. His social standing, his innocence, his

‘Scorpius, look the sign says fruit and vegetables,’ he gestured to the sign ahead, ‘let’s go buy some apples!’ He pulled the child along, not even checking to see if Potter was behind.
He trailed of in favour of diverting his attention onto the small boy, ‘and
as the world thinks he is.’
‘Well, aren’t you two adorable?’ Pansy cooed, shoving a fat sausage into her gob.
‘Papa.’
So, Draco was pretty happy to be alone. To not care all that much. Because caring… caring got you hurt.
All hope Draco had left quickly diminished at her words, a way out of this mess obviously looked grim.
‘Papa and I aren’t fighting,’ he whispered at the trembling child. ‘Please don’t cry,’ he pleaded with him softly.
‘I don’t know Draco. The rumours seem pretty feasible. I can imagine it now, one or two shots of firewhiskey too many. Music pumping in his hears, making him all hot and heavy. Who’s to say that a slut like Potter did fuck—
‘Then we will do
Potter’s mouth opened in disbelief as he shook his head profusely. ‘Are you stark mad, Malfoy?’ he asked, ‘that has to be the barmiest thing I’ve ever heard. You were always looking down on them, telling them to do crap for you. It was the worst during sixth year, don’t you remember?’
‘When did I even say anything, Potter?’ Draco asked him quite baffled and extremely confused.
Weasley narrowed his eyes at him, ‘can it Malfoy,’ he spat.
Daddy. That was a good point, why the hell wasn’t Potter helping him with this deranged child?
‘I’m glad, sociopath wouldn’t be a good look on you,’ Potter told him before he sighed, ‘I’m going back in, are you coming with?’
‘Ron told me that you’d stalked away a few moments ago.’ Potter took a deep breath, ‘the war’s over Malfoy, we don’t have to be rivals anymore. In fact, I think we could even be civil.’
Defeated, Draco let his arms fall to his sides, as he sent Potter the deadliest glare that he could muster, ‘you know what? Fuck this shit.’ He spat out as he turned on his heel and stomped towards the open doors.

Weasley fell onto his back, rolling around as if a wild animal, Finnegan looked as if he’d explode, even Granger was stifling a laugh.
‘B-but what about the other father?’ Draco attempted one last futile time.
to make sure he knows that.’ Blaise promised, and Pansy gave his hand an encouraging squeeze.

The next day, and Draco hadn’t slept a wink. Somehow, Pansy’s insistent words had taken refuge in his mind, seeping into his dreams. He said dreams – they were more like
She took a deep breath before answering, ‘waiting here for Potter every night, as he comes back drunk off his face.’
Exhausted, Draco sat down on the surprisingly comfortable sofa, as he allowed himself to rest.
‘Enough!’ Granger yelled, looking down on the both of them with deep disapproval, ‘I will

Instead of telling them what for, which he so desperately wanted to do, he fixed his gaze onto Scorpius. He seemed to be in deep thought, and Draco just knew that he was planning something. The lightbulb above his head was practically blinding.

‘Third year, when you - ’

Potter rolled his eyes, ‘for whatever craped up reason, he was completely devastated that you weren’t there when he’d woken up, he started bawling.’ He stood up a little straighter and sighed, ‘still is.’
‘He didn’t.’ Draco spat for the second time as he felt tears start to prick his eyes.
many eyes had now been exposed to the whole ordeal. Their fiery gaze trailed him as if he were the main attraction of an act, as slowly the scene before him became close enough to touch.
Potter scoffed, ‘and do what?’
Potter shot a smile his way and Draco was taken aback because he hadn’t expected Potter to be so nice. Potter and he had been somewhat
The entire occurrence had been ridiculous. Draco had lost sleep over this child, he’d given away time and attention, he’d even gone without food so that Scorpius had a full stomach. But co-parenting with Potter… that was where he drew the line.
Even when he attempted to joke, he still came across as an idiot. Which was yet another reason why he and Potter were very much incompatible.

I feel like it,’ he told him defiantly before narrowing his eyes, ‘Now, I’ll ask you again, where the hell did you get that?’
‘Well then, let’s go,’ he gestured towards the door, and Scorpius shook his head. Draco sighed, ‘what is it now?’

child. Scrambling through his closet, Draco found a shirt that was far too small for him and dragged it over Scorpius’ head. It still reached the small boy’s feet, but Draco was certain that he’d at least be comfortable.
Not because of the word, no, but because who was directed at. Standing at the entryway of the hall, a panicked look on his face, was no other than
‘NO. NO. NO.’
sometimes he’d wonder what it would be like to be Harry Potter’s friend. Did Weasley ever joke into his ear: some being funny, some being ludicrous, and some being downright stupid. But maybe, just maybe Draco wished that he were the one to make Potter’s eyes light up, a colossal grin spreading across his face.

Then Potter had started following him. And Draco was ecstatic if not a small bit irritated. For some absurd reason he’d believed that Potter
a small voice supplied as Draco started to feel sick.
Severus looked how he felt, spluttering and muttering, completely baffled. The boy continued, completely unaware to the frazzled looks he was receiving, ‘yu is being silly Uncle Sevrus, yu know that m’ four, you was at my biwfday pawty,’
‘That may be. But your DNA is all over the towel.’ He tutted, as he walked even closer towards Weasley.
‘Well..’ Weasley paused for a second before smirking triumphantly. ‘Sixth year you tried to Crucio Harry!’
The trek to Dumbledore’s office suddenly seemed endless, and Draco wished to turn his head from inquisitive eyes. ‘At Hogwarts. It’s a school,’ he answered absently wondering just what had happened to the small boy. The fact that someone could’ve harmed an innocent left him feeling uncomfortable.
She carried on, ‘It’s disgustingly obvious that you want to fuck him, you drool at the mention of his name,’ she narrowed her eyes at him, ‘you’re

Draco put a hand on his hip, lifting his chin in defiance, ‘your tears won’t work on me,’ he told the boy.
He ignored the small voice in his head telling him to turn back as he entered the room of requirement. Having a moral conscious was bothersome.

He turned to face Dumbledore, ‘if that’s all, may we leave, we have a train to catch.’

‘WHEN I TELL YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU WILL DO IT.’
‘Well, that’s too bad because you’re not coming.’
‘I wasn’t the only git if I remember correctly.’
‘No.’ the boy said thickly. ‘m’ don’t wike blood, it’s unpre—’ the boy furrowed his brows as if in deep concentration, ‘it’s unpreci- unpwrecide,’ he sighed in frustration.
Draco laughed, almost manically, then raised his wand throwing the nastiest hex he could think of. As it hit Potter square in the chest, he flew backward and slammed into the opposite wall, his shoulders sagging slightly.
‘I don’t wan your sweets anymowre,’ he said, and Draco felt his confidence start to dwindle.
She let out a disbelieving gasp, ‘you abandoned your son?’
Impulsively, Draco spun back around so that his eyes were locked onto furious green one. He put a hand to his hip as he snarled, ‘you said that you didn’t want to leave Scorpius in the hands of someone like me, this way you won’t have to.’ He gave Potter one last glare, not trusting himself to look at Scorpius’ sleeping figure.
Potter took a step closer towards him, and Draco’s heart started to beat rapidly. ‘Are you suggesting that I do that also… with you?’

Scorpius started to sniff as his nose became runny, ‘you don’t cawre abowt my Daddy. But you wuv Daddy!’ He cried out, hot, wet tears running freely down his cheeks.
Her speech was stopped when she felt a sharp jab at her legs. Somehow, Scorpius had shimmied out of Draco’s grasp in favour of giving her a piece of his mind.
‘No problem at all,’ he hissed. ‘Scorpius and I are going to Hogsmeade to buy him suitable attire, and before you ask, no you cannot come.’
Draco rolled his eyes, ‘well, what do you

He couldn’t help but smile at Potter’s innocence, before nodding. ‘Yes, you did,’ he assured him as the dorm came into sight.
