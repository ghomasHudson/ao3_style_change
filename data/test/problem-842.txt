“Good to be back,” Harry said, returning the smile. His attention, however, was fixed on Malfoy, who had also risen to his feet but was standing back, as if wary. When he caught Harry’s gaze, Malfoy flushed and looked down.
Another short one today, folks, but the next one's gonna be a doozy! I may not have time to post it tomorrow, but if that's the case, watch out for a double feature on Monday :-) We're almost done!
Which was why, two weeks later, when Robards popped his head out of his office and said curtly, “Malfoy’s trial’s set for July 13,” it took Harry a minute to register what had just happened. He was deep in his notes for a case of illegal potions smuggling, wondering whether he’d be able to take Ron along when they inevitably had to go undercover as illegal potions dealers or if he’d get stuck with Felix Jennings, who liked to listen to “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love” on repeat when conducting stakeouts, again. Robard’s comment seemed completely out of the blue.
“Yes,” Harry shot back. “He’s worried sick about his daughter, and if you don’t give her to us right the fuck now —”
Harry woke slowly. Light stung his eyes, so he squeezed them shut. After a while, the light was less bright. He opened his eyes carefully, ready to snap them shut again if needed.
Muggle breakfast foods,” Harry said earnestly. “Ron got really into American cooking about a year ago and taught me how to make American pancakes. It was one of the best days of my life.”
Draco supposed it was revenge for his Weasley slight. He had promised himself he wouldn’t ever mention Azkaban—after all, it wasn’t like he had grounds for complaint. He was a Death Eater. He couldn’t look for pity, and he didn’t want Potter to feel like he was asking for it.
Harry ran his hands through his hair in frustration. “So your colleagues have told us,” he said lightly. “What I need from you, Mr. Bogrod, is a solution.” He nodded in Draco’s direction. “I want my husband and I to be on equal footing as regards our mutual accounts. Draco Malfoy is a free man; he needs to be able to access funds even when I’m not with him.”
Draco took a deep breath, checked to make sure he had everything he needed in his bag, and turned on his heel. The now-familiar smells of the apartment were immediately replaced by damp earth, crushed grass, and the scent, barely perceptible on the wind but unmistakable, of cinnamon and spice. Hogwarts.
The silence stretched until Hermione let out a breath, and Harry felt the cool thread recede. He opened his eyes once more. This time, the light didn’t sting or burn, and he breathed a sigh of relief.
The roar of the crowd met them as they entered: two hundred friends, colleagues, Ministry officials, and celebrities had been invited to this more intimate gathering after the public ceremony. They all stood now among row upon row of tables laden with candlesticks, flowers, sparkling stars, and ivy twining around creamy white plates awaiting food. The soft sounds of a string quartet emanated from the room’s corners, but all eyes were on him and Potter. Draco swallowed hard and hoped he wouldn’t throw up.
“It’s settled then,” he said, beaming, and turned back to greet the next guest. Draco sat back in his chair, picked up his wine, and took a long sip, letting the warmth spread through his belly.
“Hay gente aquí para ti, cariño,” Elena said, suddenly very close to the door, and then the door swung open and Malfoy stepped through it. He stopped, his eyes flicking back and forth between Harry and Ron, and Harry saw his hand spasm briefly, as if about to grasp a wand that was no longer there. His face was an unreadable mask.
“Nothing,” he repeated. He leaned back in his chair, suddenly seeming far more relaxed than he had a few moments before, and scooped up another helping of guacamole. “This place is terrible.”
Harry started to head toward a table in the back, but turned quickly when he realized Draco was no longer behind him. The other man was still standing, frozen in the doorway, his gaze fixed on Clara, who had not looked up. Confused, Harry hurried back to his side.
There were several questions like this, all so that she could pinpoint the exact location of his injury. After a few moments, she took a deep breath and raised her wand.
After the first disorienting moments of falling through space and time, Harry landed hard and looked around. He was standing on a deserted street corner in what felt like the middle of the night. A moment later, he recognized it as the corner of Miles’s street in Madrid. There was the small bar where he and Ron had gotten lunch the first day they interviewed Miles. The fact that it was closed now indicated that it was very, very late.
“You need to take a break, mate,” he said firmly as they left the Head Auror’s office after what Harry felt was a well-deserved scolding (personally, he thought it should have been more. That, he thought with a grimace, was what came of being the Chosen One – even his boss couldn’t bring herself to yell at him when he had let several high-profile criminals escape). “This can’t keep going.”
Draco remembered how frightened his father had been during the year in which Voldemort and the Death Eaters had lived in Malfoy Manor. He remembered his father’s face, pinched and drained of color; remembered, too, how his father had taken his anxiety out on his son, while also trying, in his own small way, to protect his family.
It went on like this, working back through time. Viola got smaller and smaller and more and more vocal and happy. Malfoy, too, got louder and snarkier, and his face filled out so that it was merely narrow and chiseled instead of gaunt. Harry knew he was seeing starvation and abuse in reverse.
“I do know you,” Draco sobbed, clutching at Harry as much as he could with the manacles in the way. “I know you are incredible, and brave, and idiotic, and this is exactly the kind of fucking hairbrained thing you
“No, that’s not necessary either.” Harry turned and walked the rest of the way down the hall, relieved to have an easy answer for this, at least. “My office is big enough for a bed – I can conjure one up, no problem. I’ll just grab a change of clothes from the bedroom and leave you alone.” He opened the hallway’s last door to reveal his office. Malfoy glanced in, then looked again.
“We were so young,” he said. Harry could almost hear him nodding. “And so focused on getting to the end that we didn’t ever think about what might come next.”
As Draco turned her, his thoughts were focused on Riley—what had gone wrong with Riley’s spell to provoke such a reaction? What had he been trying to do?
Draco had responded that he would prefer Potter to Shaver in the classroom any day, and wouldn’t it be intriguing to be back at Hogwarts together, with all those broom closets and empty classrooms, had Potter ever had a blowjob in the library stacks? Harry had blushed furiously and kissed him deeply and that had been the end of that conversation.
“Why do you always promise the parents that we’ll find their missing kids?” Ron fumed a few minutes later as they walked down the hall. “This is an old case! She’s been gone for a year, the trail’s gone cold, we’ll be lucky to find her corpse, and then Hathaway is going to be beating down our door because you promised him something and Robards is going to be pissed at you.
Harry felt his face flush. Malfoy snapped his head back toward Harry, suddenly smiling flirtatiously. “Why, Potter, you want a turn with me?”
“Mr. Potter! Mr. Malfoy!” he exclaimed with a broad smile. The tip of his wand was glowing with a bright green light that Harry recognized as a recording spell. “Harold Rose with
“Well, we’ll take care of this right now,” Harry said firmly. When Draco looked at him, confused, he pushed on. “We’re in Diagon Alley – Gringotts is right here! We’ll go talk to someone, make it so that you can access your own money again.” He paused, suddenly unsure. Draco’s face had gone even paler. “Or—you don’t have to come if you don’t want to. I can go see if I can talk to someone, you shouldn’t have to deal with this —”
His tentative optimism did not dissipate in Advanced Charms. Professor Flitwick nodded to him briefly as he came in, but that was his only sign of recognition. The other students in the class – a mixture of Slytherins and Ravenclaws – pointedly ignored him, which was absolutely fine as far as Draco was concerned. Being ignored, as he had learned in Azkaban, was much better than being hurt. This first class of the new year was mainly reviewing theory, which Draco appreciated. It had been quite a while, but everything felt like it was sliding into place around him. In fact, as he walked to the Great Hall for lunch, he reflected that this might be a very good year.
The court date was indeed soon: the very next week, in fact. When Harry arrived at the offices of the Wizengamot that morning, he saw Miles immediately: ruddy and angry, talking loudly with a short, pale man who Harry assumed was his lawyer.
He had asked Harry about the scars on the back of his hand one afternoon, and Harry had told him about Umbridge’s punishment from fifth year. He had cried, a bit, remembering how alone he had felt. Malfoy had listened quietly, then reached through the bars to put a hand on his arm. They hadn’t spoken about it since.
The only thing that kept him walking was Potter’s hand in his. That, and the knowledge that if he didn’t keep walking, bad things would happen. The threat of bad things happening, Draco reflected wryly, had historically been a big motivator in his life.
“No, no, please Malfoy, teach me how to do magic! Otherwise I might just —” He mimed nearly dropping the vial and catching it at the last second. “Oops!”
The two Ministry employees had, he gathered, acted as on-site sponsors of a sort, representing Kingsley, Potter, and any other official who had signed onto this plan. That group didn’t seem to include the short man; Draco kept feeling small, beady eyes on him, and made conscious efforts to keep his eyes down, not make any sudden movements, and respond quickly and appropriately to anything asked of him. As he stepped outside the prison’s walls for the first time in four years, he distantly noticed warm sunshine on his skin. It seemed to be summer.
When he botched a simple take-down of a neo-Death Eater enclave because he was yawning when the main suspect entered the building, he knew something had to change.
The day before the party it snowed for the first time that winter. Harry was giddy with it, dragging Draco outside for a snowball fight before they hurried back inside to get changed. Draco was incensed at how mussed his hair got and vocalized his displeasure loudly as they wriggled into the new dress robes from Madam Malkin’s. Harry just laughed.
Harry considered this for a moment. Loathe as he was to admit it, Draco did have a point about controlling their own narrative. Not that he wanted to be in the business of public fame – but if the Wizarding world was determined to publish stories about his private life, at least they could be true.
“Yes,” he said, keeping his head motionless and his eyes fixed on her. She was bent over a spell book open on her lap, brow furrowed. A few strands of hair had escaped her neat locs, giving her a slightly frantic look when she glanced up at him.
“You have a rather esteemed visitor,” Warden was saying. Draco suddenly realized that she was speaking slightly faster than usual. Her voice seemed to have dropped a few octaves as well, and as he watched, she actually put a hand up to her hair and patted it, as if to brush away stray strands. If he didn’t know better, he would swear she was blushing.
With a cry, Draco urged Lady back into a gallop. Riley was hobbling across the grass more quickly than before, also heading to where Potter lay. “Get a healer,” Draco yelled as he threw himself off Lady and knelt at Potter’s side. Frantically, he felt for a pulse. Potter’s eyes were closed, but—
Kingsley clasped and unclasped his hands in front of him. It was strange, Harry reflected, to see him like this, thrown off balance. He had been Imperiused for a long time. None of them had known.
He trailed to a stop as the fireplace behind Hermione and Ron suddenly roared to life. They both stepped back quickly, and a moment later the face of Kingsley Shacklebolt himself had pushed through the embers, now glowing green.
“Always a pleasure to serve you,” she said, directing her face to Harry even though her words were clearly meant for Draco. “That will be five galleons, please.”
“I know,” Harry said quietly as the elevator door closed behind them. “I know you’re right. But what will I do with myself every day, Ron?” As he said the words, he realized how true they were. “This is all I’ve ever known.”
, and felt Draco, beside him, do the same. The stag burst from his chest, followed closely by Draco’s fox and Hermione’s otter. The animals swirled around the room, wreaking havoc among the dementors behind and around Lucius, who swarmed out of windows and blazed through the room, causing the Imperiused wizards and witches to duck out of the way, screaming.
Harry suddenly felt very aware that he was nearly sliding off the carriage seat and shifted quickly back to his own space, facing forward next to Malfoy. The awkward silence was broken by the sudden clatter of the carriage wheels, the sharp bounce forward as they pulled out of the crush of people streaming away the Grove toward the portkeys. Their carriage would take a few minutes more than the instantaneous transportation of the wedding guests, allowing the hall to be fully prepared and their guests to be seated and waiting for them upon arrival. This, Hermione had told him, was a Muggle tradition that had been incorporated into the Wizarding ceremony.
The line shortened rapidly. Everyone in this class was experienced enough that a boggart hardly seemed to phase them. Draco was only a few people from the end of the line now. He waited breathlessly, hoping against hope that Shaver would step in front of him, or class would end, or that he would suddenly gain the ability to physically sink into the floor.
The second-to-last time he had seen that hair, it had been bedraggled and dirty and Luna had been imprisoned in his own family’s dungeon. His right arm began to itch.
“You misunderstand,” Lucius interrupted smoothly. “I don’t want to know what you say. I want to know
“If you say no to this offer, Mr. Malfoy, you will not only be throwing away your own future, miraculously restored to you; you will be spitting in the face of the entire wizarding world. Again.” An onlooker might have thought Kingsley’s voice was kind. “A crime of that magnitude, on top of the crimes already charged against you? I would say that might warrant a second trial, wouldn’t you, Warden?”
But something was wrong. The boggart was getting paler, yes, but its hair was turning black and rushing down its shoulders. A hooked nose, hard green eyes, sweeping black robes –
of apparition sent tingles running through Harry’s body. Or perhaps it was the feeling of Draco’s arm beneath his hand.
Draco turned to Harry then, and the desperation and fear in his eyes made Harry’s heart break. He stepped forward.
“I haven’t talked to anyone besides Harry in weeks,” he said quietly. “And before that, I think he was with me any time I spoke with someone else.” He seemed to be thinking hard. “Of course, if anyone were to ask me about the marriage, I would confirm our mutual happiness.” He folded his hands carefully in his lap. “My interactions with Hogwarts professors have been short and focused entirely on my studies.”
Draco was a little taken aback by her ease, then realized McGonagall must have prepped all his teachers. Grateful for the welcome, he slid into a set towards the far wall of the classroom and, for lack of anything better to do, pulled out his own parchment and quill. It felt odd, being back in a classroom, but not in a bad way, really. Draco was just reflecting that he could get used to this when the classroom door opened again and a large group of students hurried in.
A model prisoner? He supposed that could be true. Draco had never tried to smuggle in forbidden items, never gotten involved in any of the gangs that sometimes formed and fought within the prison’s walls. He had thought about fighting, about smuggling in some food that didn’t taste like nuclear waste, about escaping – but that had been in the first few months, when he still hadn’t truly believed that he was facing fifty years in Azkaban. He had even approached some of the other prisoners, hoping to find other Crabbes and Goyles to boss around and hide behind. He had quickly learned that the Malfoy name took away as much in here as it had given him out there. No self-respecting prisoner wanted to be associated with Lucius Malfoy’s son, not when his father was known, even here, as the worst kind of traitor: a coward.
From where he sat in the middle of the floor, Kingsley Shacklebolt looked up and around blearily. “What –? Ugh,” he said, rubbing his head. “Where are –? How –?”
. Draco couldn’t make his brain work. People were staring at him. Someone on the other side of the classroom tittered.
Almost without realizing what he was doing, Harry stepped forward and held out his hand. They were supposed to be old school chums, weren’t they? The audience would expect some kind of civil greeting, if not the tearful reunion of two separated lovers. He half expected Malfoy to smirk and turn away, but the other man met his eyes again quickly before reaching forward and clasping Harry’s hand in his own. Malfoy’s palm was cool, but shaking ever so slightly. Surprised, Harry tried to meet Malfoy’s eyes once more, but his gaze was focused again just past Harry’s right ear. Still, he didn’t pull away.
It all seemed just a little too easy. No sooner had Harry circled back to the front door when it opened and a crowd of four or five wizards spilled out, talking and laughing. They were all so distracted, it was easy to slip inside past them with no one the wiser. Harry found himself in Malfoy Manor’s entrance hall: brightly lit, as opulently decorated as he remembered, and completely deserted.
“My childhood would have been so much better if I’d been able to use magic to clean,” he agreed with a chuckle. “Although my aunt and uncle probably would’ve thrown me out on the street.”
Ron made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a growl, and Harry waved him back. “No, not that he does things to me, or anything. Just that he hasn’t spilled his deepest secrets and hopes and dreams to me yet, which is fine. These things take time.” He took a long swallow of beer, thinking about dinners talking with Draco about Quidditch, sitting together in companionable silence. “But it’s almost – it’s nice.”
They returned to the farmhouse to find Viola and Ron playing tag in the front yard. Ron waved an acknowledgement but didn’t stop chasing the shrieking little girl. Malfoy strode into the house, suitcase in hand, without a word, and Harry followed him, suddenly unsure where to be. He lingered in the sitting room, listening to Malfoy opening and closing drawers. A little while later, there was the sound of a shower running, and Harry guessed Malfoy had realized this might be his last chance for a shower for a while.
He sobered quickly when he noticed Harry watching him, but didn’t offer a translation. Harry felt his irritation build.
“She learned it from me, Potter,” Malfoy said in what sounded for all the world like fond exasperation. “Now, go on – what did Weasley do?”
“Why yes, my boy—you lovebirds don’t want to waste any time, do you?” Kingsley was practically glowing. Draco felt a hollow opening in his chest. Of course: this was a public marriage, arranged by the Minister of Magic for his own political ends. Of course he, Draco, would have to play happy in front of the entire world.
“All finished,” it said in Elias Cho’s smiling voice. Harry took a deep breath and headed back to the cells.
“I wondered if I’d find you here.” Weasley’s words were slightly slurred. Draco felt his stomach clench.
) ago, but this one seemed to take particular delight in torturing him. He wondered what he had done to piss him off like this, or, more likely, what Lucius had offered this man should he get Draco to break.
He had to move. With a light touch on Potter’s arm, Draco excused himself and walked, somewhat blindly, toward a side hallway that he hoped held the bathrooms. He fancied he could feel their eyes on his retreating back, and kept himself from running toward the exit only with an extreme exertion of willpower. Only when the hallway’s dimness – startling after the brightly-glowing hall – had encompassed him and he had shut the door of the men’s room behind him did he let himself relax.
“I wasn’t – I didn’t –” he started, but Miles strode forward and punched him squarely in the gut. Malfoy doubled over, heaving.
“During the Battle of Hogwarts,” Harry answered. “You didn’t know?” he asked in disbelief. When Draco shook his head, Harry realized his mistake. Of course, Draco wouldn’t have known, unless Narcissa had told him. When Harry had spoken at her trial, Draco had already been in Azkaban. “That’s part of why they only put her on house arrest, instead of a full prison sentence.”
“To a convicted Death Eater? You’re hilarious, Potter,” Robards said, already turning to go back into his office. The door shut with a final
“Where should we have lunch tomorrow?” he said lamely, then cursed inwardly as Draco’s brow furrowed.
Hermione nodded sharply and strode toward the reporters. Harry could hear her voice, bright with false gaiety, as she expertly intercepted them, and he thanked the universe, yet again, for Hermione’s constant presence in his life. He walked quickly to the bedroom before anyone else could pull him into a conversation.
“Welcome home!” he said, then took a deep breath. “Actually, it’s not really home. I mean, it won’t be soon. I don’t know if he told you, but Kingsley is going to give us a new flat as a wedding present. He offered to help me set it up beforehand, but I wanted you to have a say in where it was, and the layout and everything…” Harry trailed off. Malfoy was looking around, taking in the pile of papers on the kitchen table, the coat thrown carelessly over an armchair. Harry suddenly wished he had tidied up a bit more, maybe painted the walls something other than the off-white color in which he had found them three years ago when he moved in. He could imagine how all this must look to someone who had grown up in Malfoy Manor.
Then she squeezed his arm and gave him a small push forward and he was walking slowly along the earthen path, golden light falling around him, the sound of an organ coming from somewhere high above and all around, and the chattering crowd fell into a reverent silence. Harry hoped he wasn’t walking too quickly, or too slowly, but almost immediately he found Ron and Hermione in the crowd, seated right near the four central trees, and Hermione’s bright grin reassured him even as he nervously smiled back. They rose to meet him when he reached their chairs – they would be his witnesses, of course. Who else? Ron gave his shoulder a squeeze and Harry exchanged a glance that he hoped conveyed his gratitude at Ron’s support, no matter Ron’s own feelings about this union. He needed that in this moment, more than he could express. Ron gave a small nod before falling into step behind Harry and they walked the remainder of the path together. Four more Druids awaited them beneath the central trees, and Harry nodded solemnly to each of them in turn. Then he looked up and had to fight a sudden, deep-seated urge to draw his wand in self-defense.
As he approached the door, though, he heard voices raised in laughter: Elias Cho. Harry stopped in his tracks.
“Hm.” Ron made a noncommittal noise around his second chip. “Well, that’s something, anyway.” He chewed thoughtfully. “Does he make you think about the past?”
“No, and it wasn’t a Portkey either, I could see both his hands and he hadn’t touched anything. It was like he just stepped from place into another.”
“Come, Draco. Sit.” Lucius moved back behind the desk and motioned to a chair set before him. “There is much to discuss.”
“Good afternoon, Minister.” His voice caught in his throat but he inclined his head. It was odd how comfortable the formal motion felt; after four years of having even something as casual eye contact punished by a sharp slap or a hex, he wasn’t sure he remembered how to interact with people in the wider world.
“Wonder what she’s doing here,” Harry said grimly. He was just about to say something else, when a chill stole over his whole body. Suddenly, everything felt very difficult, and very useless. Draco probably didn’t even want to see Harry again, not after everything Harry had said to him. Every single one of Harry’s words came back to him in vivid, biting clarity. He clenched his jaw against the sudden anguish.
“Everything will be alright, Mr. Malfoy,” Riley replied absently, his gaze fixed on Potter’s motionless form. “Just a few more minutes, now, and everything will be alright.”
“Will you be here for more than one year?” another student asked. Draco couldn’t make her out, but he thought he recognized the voice of a Hufflepuff from Ancient Runes.
“Shit!” Ron exclaimed, reeling back. “These new interns really need to learn how to temper their message spells.”
Suddenly, the dragon swooped down and began encircling them ever more tightly. Harry could also see one of the phoenixes and several merpeople, whose protruding eyes looked even stranger in the flickering candlelight. Everything else was obscured in mist, the din of the guests receding by the minute. It was just him and Malfoy in a swirling world of sparkling fog –
“Oh I would certainly think so, Minister,” Warden replied instantly. “And this time, the charge may be for life.”
At least this time, Shaver couldn’t torture him in the same way. Draco tried to tell himself that it was ok. Everything was going to be ok.
She nodded and clasped his hand briefly, then melted into the darkness. Harry took a deep breath, squared his shoulders beneath the cloak, and set off to find a way in.
“Mr. Malfoy has already offered, thank you Harry,” Kingsley said. “I’m fine. Just wanted to talk to you both about the
Draco had never realized just how tall Weasley was. The other man towered over him; his breath was hot on Draco’s cheek. Draco concentrated on staying still, on keeping his eyes down, on breathing steadily and slowly. This was nothing new – this had happened in Azkaban, again and again, and then there had been nothing keeping him safe. Now, there were hundreds of people outside the bathroom who would notice if he didn’t return, or if he returned with a broken nose. He could get through this.
“Yes,” he/she said. Then, in unison with Harry: “To the house of the lord, to the house of the lord, to the house of the lord...”
Draco swallowed around a lump in his throat. “Thank you, Riley,” he said sincerely. On an impulse, he stepped forward and clasped the older man’s hand gratefully. “I won’t forget this.”
“Harry,” Draco began hesitantly. When Potter looked at him, he remembered his place and drew his hand back from where it had been drifting to the other man’s arm. “I appreciate your efforts on my behalf, and of course I’ll do whatever you think is best. Do you—” He cleared his throat. “Do you really trust me? With this?”
Still, he managed to pull himself together for the first few meeting of the day, and even sent several messages asking for reports and updates. The courier owls came back bearing scroll after scroll of parchment: a new agent had been identified to take over the covert mission in Norway, but she needed the proper clearances; Kingsley needed an updated list of Death Eater-adjacent groups for a report; the Daily Prophet was asking for another interview. Harry could feel himself getting more and more consumed with his work, and let it wash over him gratefully. The tightening in his chest was a familiar companion; it reminded him that he was needed, that he was doing something important. He might be in the dark about his relationship with Draco, or even with Ron for that matter; he might be so tired that he felt on the verge of collapsing if he weren’t pulled so tight – but at least he was defending the world against dark magic.
“I will clear my schedule at once, my gallant knight,” he replied, waving airily. “And pine away the hours till we meet again.”
“Ok,” Ron said, squinting against the late afternoon sun. “He must be in the house, unless he’s hiding in the fields somewhere.”
…Draco resolutely pushed that thought away. There was no time. He needed someone who knew medical magic, and who might listen to his explanation before immediately contacting the Ministry. A face flashed into his mind, improbable but possible. Where was the Floo powder?
Harry put down his chopsticks too. He arranged them carefully on the table so that they were leaning up against his plate just so. He took a deep breath.
He made his way back to the cells, clutching the vial with the swirling memories, his mind still half in Madrid. Malfoy was sitting on the cot, staring into space. When he saw Harry, he leapt up and crossed to the bars, holding onto them tightly.
Now he didn’t even have the comfort of knowing that his work as an Auror was helping keep the world safe. He had all but quit that job because it felt like too much.
Elias nodded, making a note. “I’ll look into that.” He glanced up at Harry. “I assume the court date will be soon?”
“Just—please don’t feel like you always have to defend me,” Draco said finally, and bit off a piece of tandoori chicken.
Draco took a deep breath and lowered the letter to the bed. It was folly, pure and piercing, to keep this letter. If he was discovered with a letter from an Azkaban prisoner (and how had Lucius even gotten the letter out of Azkaban in the first place?), to say nothing of a former Death Eater, he didn’t imagine even Harry would be able to keep him from people like Weasley. Hell, Harry would probably put him back in Azkaban himself. Draco harbored no illusions about the nature of their relationship. Potter was kind, considerate, attentive – but only because he had to be. There were appearances to keep up.
It was completely blank, but as he looked at it, words began to appear as if they were rising out of water. Draco felt his stomach clench. It was just like –
“If you promised to watch the memories before sending her back to Miles, does that mean she has to stay with one of us tonight?” Ron asked, slightly dubious, a few minutes after Malfoy left. Harry bit his lip. He hadn’t thought this through.
“It was decided that the traditional thestrals would be in poor taste,” the stout man murmured. Draco nodded and said nothing.
It was impossible. His father was in Azkaban – Draco had seen him led away, had been taunted by the guards with vivid descriptions of whatever new brutality his father was facing. There had been no headlines (“Death Eater Escaped!” “Lucius Malfoy Released!”) as there would have been had he disappeared. Draco repeated the words to himself and felt his stomach clench. He couldn’t tell if his body was reacting to the knowledge that those words could not possibly be true, or the possibility, however small, that they were.
The wizard behind the desk was older than Draco remembered him, but still very recognizable as the man who had rented him and his mother horses all those years ago. The man looked up with an absent smile when they entered, then focused on Draco. His eyes widened.
“I stand by it,” he said with a grin. “Just wait until you try my specialty: banana chocolate chip.”
Ritchie glared at him for another moment, then pushed past him and stalked back to Malfoy’s cell. Malfoy was still crouched on the floor where he had fallen when Ritchie had released him. He was covering his face with his hands.
“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. Turned back to their table and drained his firewhiskey. Put several Sickles down on the stained wood. “Have a round on me.”
know,” he began, “that we don’t actually like the idea of parading ourselves around in front of reporters and that it’s our
“Absolutely, yes, couldn’t be happier,” Draco responded quickly, reaching out to take the other man’s hand and shaking it solemnly. He kept his face in a mask of polite attentiveness as Dedalus went off again about Potter’s many virtues. By the time he bobbed away back to his seat, Dedalus was smiling again and Draco’s hands were clenched into fists beneath the table. He had only a moment’s peace, however, before the tall witch swept up to him and clasped him by the hand.
“And how much is a promise to a Death Eater worth, hm?” Harry snapped. “I’d watch your tone with me, Malfoy, if you know what’s good for you.”
Draco’s eyes were shining, but he suddenly bit his lip. Harry bumped his shoulder. “Don’t even start that. She’ll be so happy to see you.”
Draco took a deep breath. “I cannot,” he said quietly, speaking more to the floor than to Harry himself. “I’m sorry. Would it please you to see me beg?”
It could have been hours or days later, but finally, someone came for him. A tall, reedy wizard entered his cell without a word and silently cast the spell to make the chains on the chair retract. Draco startled at the sudden change but didn’t make any more movements. He watched the other man warily.
Malfoy lurched forward, his face going pale. “You promised,” he hissed. “You promised to watch them before —"
Hello friends! I'm emerging from a VERY busy stretch, just in time for the holidays! So obviously this will still be irregularly updated, but I'll be uploading a new chapter every week for the next few weeks.
“It would be unusual, certainly, but not unheard of. You would not stay in the castle of course, but you could come each day for classes, and you were always a bright student. I’m sure you would have no trouble getting back into the swing of things.”
In fact, they’d been able to get very little else at all. Malfoy still had a very sensitive version of the Trace on him, in case he ever tried to break the terms of his sentence and use magic, but it had never been activated. Ron and Harry partnered up with Spanish aurors to interview Miles’s neighbors and acquaintances, but no one had heard from “Oliver” in a year, and no one had seen him after he left Miles’s house. They tried using a scent hound, trained and magically enhanced to be able to follow any scent for miles, but the trail was so cold that the poor beast gave up just a few blocks from Miles’s apartment building, whimpering and confused.
HUGE THANK YOU to absolutely everyone who has read, left kudos, and commented on this fic. It's taken me so much longer than I thought it would, but I have also learned so much, felt so much, and so enjoyed reading your comments, hearing your insights, and knowing you're reading my words and thinking your own thoughts about them! This is the first fic I've ever finished, and one of the first creative writing projects I've shared publicly in a loooong time, so your support, patience, and kindness mean THE WORLD to me.
It was more than never getting enough sleep. More than feeling like he could never take a break, even when he was so sleep-deprived that he knew he was missing things in the cases in front of him. It was a bone-deep exhaustion that permeated everything he did, from cooking, to talking, to working.
Draco touched down on the deserted front courtyard. He supposed all the students were still having breakfast after the welcome feast and the Sorting the night before, and was grateful that no one saw him looking around awkwardly before he found the small niche in the inner wall with his own name on it that was clearly intended for his broom. He stowed the broomstick, then turned to face the large front doors. And froze.
Harry waited to see if he would say anything else. When Malfoy just started cutting up the banana in silence, he turned back to the skillet and dabbed some butter on. It sizzled as he maneuvered it around the pan.
“Ah, yes. You work for the Ministry of Magic…?” Malfoy was looking at him inquisitively, and Harry realized with a start that he had no idea how much, if anything, Malfoy knew about him anymore.
Harry shouted, but Lucius hung onto his wand and Harry felt a bolt of something like lightening shooting up his wand arm as the spell was –
he told himself firmly. He had already messed up enough, rushing into things before thinking them through.
Counting had stopped working a long time ago. Draco shuddered as another blast of icy water hit him and a high, cruel laugh filled his ears. He had stopped trying to keep track of his father’s cronies days (
Draco laughed and followed Ron into the garden. The Burrow looked like something out of a fairy tale. Strings of lights stretched from roofline to garden fence, bathing a circle of flowers in a sweet golden glow as twilight began to descend around them. Chairs, many of which were already occupied, had been set up in a circle around the flowers. Draco spotted Harry at once and made his way over to him with a parting nod to Ron, who remained on the outskirts, bouncing Rose and cooing to her in loving nonsense.
It was late by the time they left Ron and Hermione’s. Draco was promising Viola that he would be back tomorrow, and that she could come have a sleepover at his new apartment very soon. Harry dawdled at the door until he could walk out with Draco.
They ate the rest of the pancakes in fairly companionable silence. Harry kept trying to think of good topics of conversation, but too many of them included things that had happened while Malfoy was in Azkaban, or people Malfoy either wouldn’t know or had tortured at one time or another. Even Harry’s job was off-limits, he realized. How could you talk to a former Death Eater about hunting down former Death Eaters?
“You don’t say!” said the third, but he didn’t have time to say any more because Harry cast three quick “Stupifies” from beneath the cloak and all three men fell down, motionless.
“I’m sorry,” he said expressionlessly. “May I ask you a question?” “Of course,” Harry said, turning to face him.
Wriggling closer to Draco he rested his head on the other boys' shoulder and hummed contently. He didn't want to move. Not yet. He was more than happy to sit on the stone balcony with Draco and bask in the silence of a burden finally lifting off his shoulders and ascending up in the night sky to settle among the stars.
He felt his stomach knot in disgust at himself as he had waited longer and longer to take the last train in the evening from Paris so that by the time he got home he was too hungry and exhausted to do anything other than fall straight to sleep as Draco would have fallen asleep at least two hours beforehand. He had even come home one night, around the same time as tonight, and had ended up crying himself into a state as Draco had fallen asleep on the table with a candle burning down to a stump in its holder and a roast poussin turned stone cold in front of him. Once he'd stripped the blonde and put him safely in bed and dispensed with the ruined food, he had gone down into the main shop downstairs, crouched into a corner behind the counter and cried and screamed into his knees whilst clutching at his ears so as not to wake Draco. He had cried until his skull had felt hot beneath his skin and his tears were scorching trails down his skin. He wept until he'd choked on his own saliva and blood from where he'd been biting his tongue.
"Absolutely not," were the words that made his anger boil within his veins as he had described Harry's want for a weekend away to the nurses. "He is beyond too weak for such taxing activities," she arched an eyebrow at him, "He has to remain in hospital."
Draco felt dread knot in his chest. "So," he choked out in a strangled voice, "A list of what Harry and I have not been doing a lot of recently?"
Draco smiled sadly. "I miss it too, love," he leaned over to press a kiss to Harry's mouth. "Have you taken your pills today?" Harry nodded gloomily before tugging at a strand of Draco's hair, "you'd better hurry up otherwise we won't make these reservations of yours."
Draco looked up at him smiling gently and stepped forward to stroke his fingers against Harry's cheek. The brunette man shivered involuntarily and averted his gaze before licking his lips and forcing a smile onto his mouth. His eyes drifted over to the candlelight that was flickering over the softly painted walls. Draco's eyes shone with a hurt glint but it was gone within a moment as he turned with a smile on his pale pink lips, "Well you have been working yourself ragged these past few weeks and I just didn't want you to come home another night and have to struggle about cooking, so I thought I would sort it out for you." He hesitated for a moment before shifting a little awkwardly, "I know things at work are difficult for you and I know my bought of illness are hardly what you want to come home to, and I'm sorry for that. I just wanted to make some of it up to you, in any little way that I can."
The dog whined lightly before removing himself from Draco's sprawled body and over to Harry, tail wagging, and waiting obediently for his lead to be strapped back onto his collar. "Oh yeah, he sits for you, but when it's me he enjoys breaking my back," Draco grumbled as he gently eased himself back onto his feet and dusted the wet clumps of sand that were clinging onto him.
As soon as he got into his shared hotel room with Ronald, Harry flopped down onto his bed as soon as he had hung up his dress robes and tie, making sure that they wouldn't crease before the following night and then collapsed in an exhausted heap on his bed. He would have fallen instantly asleep if it wasn't for Ronald flopping onto his own bed, still fully clothed, and his mouth hanging open to allow loud snores to fill the air.
Draco nodded, trying not to let the tears shine too much in his eyes, "of course I did. Right after I took Seeker for a walk."
With a quick wordless twisting of his wand, Draco transformed the limp hospital gown into a replica of Harry's black fleece all-in-one pajama sets that he wore in winter. It even had the feet and hand covers too. Harry hummed and hugged his waist, finally feeling warmth dribble back into his body. "Thank you," he breathed.
"Because I want to. For months now, almost a year, people have been trying to tell me what to do; you, Ron, Molly and all those damned Healers. The only person who hasn't is Draco. And if Draco wants me to go with his for some sun and descent food -I'm taking that chance before someone else can ruin it for me!"
"Hold still," Harry murmured drowsily as he placed a placating hand on Draco's tense butt cheek. He eased himself off of the bed and padded clumsily over to the small cupboard across the room. He grabbed a small pot with a salve inside and came back over to kneel beside Draco's legs. "You're going to need to unclench," he advised softly as he stroked Draco's hot skin with one hand and with his free one, he dabbed it into the salve.
Draco smoothed his sweaty palm on the thighs of his trousers. There was always something about the glint in Harry's wickedly green eyes that made him nervous. "I was thinking about it and thought that maybe a puppy would be more -appropriate."
The whispers followed him through the Entrance Hall and into the Great Hall as he moved over to the Slytherin's table where very few of his classmates from previous years now sat. Not that it mattered. He could have been invisible at that table for all the attention anyone paid him. Despite the other Slytherin's being shunned for what had happened during the war and -in general -for being a Slytherin at all, they still managed to give the illusion that they had standards.
Draco made him another mug of chicken noodle soup, and let him watch the television, whilst he packed everything with a flick of his wand, and added a weightless charm so that it would be easier to carry everything to the car. He decided to leave Seeker behind. Harry could bring him out once he drove around to the front of the hotel. He pressed one last lingering kiss to Harry's lips before leaving the hotel room.
The following morning Draco woke up alone. He loathed the feeling of waking up alone and neglected in the late hours of the morning. He sank bank down into his pillows and drew his sheets up around his shoulders not wanting to seem as vulnerable as he felt.
think you're doing?" he spat out as he glared up at the man standing against the apartment door before turning back around in the chair, the letter twisted tightly in his sweaty palm and quickly stuffed the others back into his leather satchel and kicked it underneath his chair with his foot and sighed.
It just so happened that one night, a particularly calm night, where he was up reading by candlelight and heard a timid knock at his door. "Come in," he called softly, not wanting to wake anyone up in in the floors below. Due to the silence of the night out there in the Lake District, sound carried far and wide and a little too clearly for Harry's liking, but he was only there for another eight days so he could deal with it. The door clicked open, the sound grating through the air. He was surprised to see Draco standing in the doorway, looking pale and sweaty and he edged into the room. Harry blinked and frowned through the dim glow of the candles. He should have anticipated the blonde as no one else would be wondering around the house at two o'clock in the morning. However he was more surprised at the fact that Draco looked far too skinny in his nightshirt, his cheeks gaunt and his hair lacking its usual lustre. If Draco looked that bad then Harry dreaded to think what he looked like. "Draco?" he frowned, "What are you doing up? Hasn't Severus gotten you on a strict schedule?"
Draco nodded with a lazy smile playing on his lips as his head lulled against the headboard, "I always seem to forget how amazing it feels to have you inside me."
Harry dropped down to his knees and grasped Draco's face between his hands and pressed their mouths together in passionate, salty damp kisses before he broke away and gave a watery laugh, "Merlin, I've gotten you all wet." He wiped at Draco's cheeks with his sleeve and only stopped when the blonde man grasped his wrist and pulled it away.
"You're really beautiful you know that, baby?" the blond man breathed as he stroked his thumb over Harry's knuckles. Harry smiled and turned his face to Draco's, their noses rubbing together.
Suffice to say, since Ron was too busy scowling at Harry from down the other end of the table, it gave Hermione an open window to ask Harry what was actually going on. Harry had blinked innocently at the question but knew he couldn't feign ignorance. Most of the school were spreading the rumors so it was clear he'd have heard
Draco still looked a little unsure. He sank back onto the bench and started wringing his hands in his lap. He could easily go over there like he'd done the other week. Sure, the rumor mill had churned up their names once or twice, but it hadn't been too bad. He rubbed at his knuckles once again and bit down on his bottom lip. He could do it. Sure the timing would spark rumors, but other than that would it really harm his already microscopic reputation? He swallowed thickly before nodding, "Okay ... I'll try and catch a spare moment after dinner."
Harry leaned over him, his tan skin a soft caramel colour in the glow of the candles. His eyes were almost swallowed my his pupils and he was already breathing deeply. He leaned back completely, unfastened his trousers and slid out of them. Stroking his hands up Draco's legs made the blonde man quiver; having soft fingers brush through the fine blonde hairs up his shin was oddly ... arousing.
,' Harry thought bitterly before dropping his gaze to his clenched fist on the arm of his wicker chair. He swallowed thickly and bit down on his tongue. "Do you mind if I think a little about it?" he rasped out. The idea of spending time with Draco both frightened him and made him nostalgic for the times where being with the blonde man was a task that surpassed everything else.
Without anyone warning, Draco came hard and heavy. He shot his load all over Harry's hand, his stomach and chest, and even a little on the pillow under his head. Harry would have found it funny, if he wasn't too busy falling over the precipice himself; his mind was detached from his body as he spasmed uncontrollably, unloading all of his essence into his lover, his muscles rigid as pulse after pulse of his orgasm rocked through him.
Once she even needed to cast a silencing spell over them at the abuse they hurled at one another. Most of it wasn't aimed at one another, it was simply to exhaust themselves and vent, but sometimes one or the other went too far and they wouldn't see one another for a couple of days.
Severus stopped from his pacing in front of the young man and whirled around to face him, dark eyes like bottomless pits burning with fury. If Harry had had any more energy he would have flinched. As it stood he could just about focus on his breathing and murmuring a little. That alone was exhausting him already but if Severus wanted answers then he'd give the man some damned answers. "What do you mean?" Severus asked as he drew the chair away from the balcony, shut the doors against the night sky, and seated himself at the head of the bed, leaning back so he could analyse the young man before him.
Draco shook his head, "Why should we let it change anything between us? We're still friends first and foremost."
A pang of guilt had flashed through his chest for weeks on end until he had finally gotten up the courage to go and see Hermione on his own. He had opted to go in the afternoon whilst her children were having their afternoon nap. He divulged the problem to her over a cup of coffee, she had looked as though she was desperate for one with bags under her brown eyes and her hair a little messier than usual, and she had hummed in thought, running some suggestions by him. At each rejection the listen became shorter and shorter until, finally, there were no answers left.
Halloween blurred by with Draco being tormented though he tried to keep his head low and get on with his work as best as he could. Not that the teachers cared whether he did write spectacular assignments. He accepted whatever grades he could get that were high enough for most basic jobs in the Ministry. He would take the task of being a social climber if he really needed to, because at this point he was expecting nothing less from the wizarding world.
As he lifted himself over to the edge of his bed he couldn't help but feel nervous, his muscles tensing and beginning to dampen with sweat. He flexed his fingers and stared down at his bare knees as they peeked out from underneath his nightshirt. He was really worried about getting caught wondering around at such an early hour, toward Harry's bedchamber no less. It wasn't as though he was in his twenties again, he was nearing his forties and he needed to watch himself around his parents. Severus was alright, the man tolerated more than he let on, but Draco didn't want to encourage a lecture from the older man, especially concerning the misplaced rumours that had first circulated when he and Harry had not only gone into business together, but opted to share an apartment together. To anyone who asked, they lied and said that there was more than enough room for two people to live side-by-side comfortably without invading on one another's space. In reality, they simply used the smaller bedroom for extra storage.
Later that evening the two met, as usual, in the Room of Requirement. As usual the place was sparsely furnished with nothing but a single large armchair and fireplace in the small space. They rarely needed much else between the two of them. Harry couldn't help but wonder what they would get up to that evening; another duel? No, that seemed unlikely. What else would they get to do then? Of course he had a few fair ideas of what they
Harry was relaxed on the bed, his grin softening and the glow from his sun kissed cheeks fading slightly in the cooling shade of the room. Draco slid up onto the bed and fell onto his side, curling an arm underneath his hand, his other hand coming up to rest on Harry's abdomen. He smiled softly as Harry's own hand came up and entwined their fingers together. Draco wriggled closer and pressed a smooth kiss to his lover's cheek.
He found it strange and eerie and his palms got clammy just thinking about he. He honestly didn't know what he felt when he thought about it all. He just knew that he needed to confront whoever it was before it got out of hand and someone else other than himself found out about it all. He was no one's pet project.
His anger boiled like hot water, "Will you just shut up about the trip Hermione? It did us both some good. It was a coincidence that his immune system collapsed the night we got back" he bit out in a tired, cold tone. Hermione pursed her lips. "And why would they see you and not me? I'm his fiancé after-all!"
When it came to South Pier Draco was physically exhausted and Harry was starting to look a little grey around the gills, however the sickly man begged his lover to ride the log-flume with him. Draco hadn't the heart to argue with him. He allowed Harry to tug him weakly alongside him as they strolled down to the log-flumes. There was a small queue but this did not seem to irritate Harry like it did the blond man. However as soon as they were planted in the make-shift log and the metal chains cranked beneath them, Draco felt his heart skipping furiously in his chest. He tightened his hold of Harry as the sunlight danced on their faces. The sudden drop made his stomach lurch into his throat as water rained down on them from all sides. The only joy of the ride had been Harry's breathless laughter.
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck and frowned, "Well yes that was the plan, but I cannot go to dinner looking like this. I won't look nearly formal enough in front of all of your fathers associates."
Harry watched him for several moments before edging a little further into the room and standing a few feet from where Malfoy was slumped over; he really did look utterly defeated, with his dishevelled hair that used to be so sleek and perfectly placed, and his pale skin that used to glow once upon a time now looked dishwater grey and taut over his bones. He looked like everything Malfoy would have hated to have been. "Malfoy ..." he started to say but there were no words to follow that single name, so he let it hang in the air. He swallowed thickly and turned on his heel to leave. There wasn't much else he could think of doing really.
Harry peered up over the top of where he was over-checking some of his work and frowned heavily, "No, nothing's bothering me why do you think there is?"
"God, you sound like mother," Draco rasped forcing his head to look away from Harry. He didn't want to be studied and scrutinized. "What are you doing here anyway? I thought I told you not to come this week?"
Later the night, by the light of the candle Harry took a panicking breath before ripping open the envelope despite knowing already what was inside. The solid shape through the paper was hardly difficult to discern. When he tipped the contents into his palm the tears finally gushed out along with the rough sobs that choked out of his throat. He dropped down sideways onto the mattress and pressed his clenched fist to his mouth, his wet lips kissing his white fingers that were clenched tightly around a simple gold band.
"I decided to come back," Harry murmured, twirling his wand around in his lap again. "To be honest, if I didn't who else would've had the balls enough to kill him?"
"I daren't say that if it does not interfere with your work, then Severus would be more than happy. After all, you will be spreading the things he had taught you, and I don't doubt that there will be some other people around the manor who wouldn't mind enquiring some things of you. And you would be able to recommend them all to Severus for help."
A faint blush crept on Harry's cheeks, but Draco ignored it as he unwound the tan arms from his waist. Harry let him, a gleam in his eyes that tickled the hairs on the back of Draco's neck. Loosening his tie and undoing the buttons of his waistcoat, Draco allowed his polished shoes to guide him down the hall to their bedroom.
He nodded he head, "I know. I'm just a little surprised that something like this is getting to you."
Harry had the good grace to blush as he stroked the ring and then stood up, offering Draco his hand to be led back to the bed, "So do you think you can survive another ten years with me Draco?" he breathed. Both men knew it was more than just an innocent question and even though Harry knew what Draco's answer would be, he needed to hear it said out loud. He needed it to be said out loud so that the whole universe would know that it was true.
"Holy fuck!" he gasped out as he rolled over onto his front, coughing and choking as he tried to get up onto his knees, "You could have warned me!"
That was when he noticed that Harry's nose was bleeding rather profusely. He had merely frowned and sat Harry down on the toilet lid and carefully, expertly, blotted the running river until nothing was left to stream out. Once he was sure that Harry was able to breathe properly, he had knelt before him, toothbrush in hand, and gently brushed Harry's teeth, getting rid of as much of the vomit-flavor as possible.
"Harry!" Draco barked though his mouth was smiling, "I'm asking you because I am sure. I just need to know whether or not you are sure," he paused for a moment before raising both eyebrows, "Well are you?"
Draco snorted, not drawing his eyes away from the page he was reading from. "Well it doesn't hurt to be prepared, Harry," he replied smoothly.
"I know Mister Potter but don't forget that it may be difficult for you. You cannot have such a friendship with your patients as it could easily impair your judgement. Remember what happened to that elderly man last month who died? You took that fairly hard. You didn't eat for most of the following week. I don't want to see you waste away and suffer like that again."
They skipped dinner in favor of sitting on the balcony and watching the stars slowly appear in the darkening sky. Draco transfigured a blankets from one of the old textbooks in the astronomy cupboard and spread it out over both of their laps. They were both nestled into the narrow side of the balcony so that they were better able to see the stars and have an excuse to be closer to one another. Not that they really needed one. Harry was a little surprised that no one had come looking for them yet, as far as he knew, but he didn't care. Especially when Draco laced their fingers together between the folds of the blanket and nudged the other's foot gently.
Once he was focused purely on getting head, Draco was able to relax and ease into the rhythm of Harry working his entrance. He had about three fingers inside him now, which was usually more than enough. His stomach flipped at the thought of being filled up! Usually they'd be done with foreplay and into some deep serious love-making right about now. There was usually very little focus about lube or protection charms of potions. It was all there within a snap of their fingers.
"Now Harry," the younger man peeled his eyelids open and turned his head to the left to look at Severus full, "I have thought over everything that has happened and after much discussion between myself and Lucius and Narcissa, we have come to the agreement that it would be wise for you and Draco to not live with one another for a while." Harry blinked in surprised and then frowned weakly, not having the energy to argue but wishing that he did. "We have decided that for the next six months you are going to live here, with me."
"Maybe that's what you should use the next few months to do. Find out what you want to do, make it a project or something. Do your research. If you want get your friends to help too. Look, even if you don't want to tell them everything, you don't have to. Just say that you've thought about it a lot recently and you think you need to do something outside of the ministry and the niche life you've lived up until now."
"Harry-" she tried in a reasoning tone but he was having none of it, as he fixed her with one of the darkest looks she had ever seen.
"And you promised me that we'd do what every year on this day, since I had to suffer that VERY awkward morning coming down in rumpled clothes, your underwear in my pocket, and being grilled by your father over breakfast?"
"Yes!" he smacked a hand over his mouth and gave another shaky laugh, "I mean, yes of course I will." He held out his hand and let Draco slip the signet ring onto his left ring finger, "Are you sure you want to give me this ring, Draco?" he breathed as he traced the snake and large 'M' engraved into the antique silver.
Draco had once pleaded with Harry –as much as a Malfoy would plead anyway –for the brunette man to take him back to Calais with him to see the place where he worked and where he lived. He said he wanted to know and see everything about Harry's life and be able to envision things happening during the time where his companion was away studying. Harry had insisted it was nothing special, even going as far as to say that the air in Calais would harm Draco's progress, which had angered the blonde into ignoring him for a full two hours. It stung Harry deep down but he merely feigned disinterest, instead spending the quiet down-time to read through his assignment to make sure it was coherent for the board. Eventually the silence had grown too much for Draco and he snapped that they were being stupid little brats, and thus their argument was forgotten for the most part.
"Please don't say that!" Harry gasped out as he squeezed his eyes shut, "I don't want to be categorized like that! I can't have depression, Severus. If I do then that just means I've been hurting more people than saving them!"
"Right," she nodded knowingly, before shrugging, "Well I suppose you could do. It's up to you to deal with the back-lash if there is any."
"It's just ... soothing," Harry murmured with a shrug of his shoulders. A small yawn punctured the comfortable silence, "Draco?"
"Well, if we're going to do this again we're going to have to be better prepared." He cocked a blonde eyebrow at his perplexed lover and smirked. He loved teasing Harry so much. He always had.
It had been a trying week for everyone and by the time Draco forced himself to go Malfoy Manor to sort out his father's estate, he was emotionally and physically drained that he was so tempted just to get a wheelchair and have someone wheel him around in it. He didn't want to do it, but seeing the amount of distress that his mother was in he simply couldn't ignore it, even if it was for her own sake. He felt cold and shaky as his heels clicked one at a time as he trailed through the long marble corridors and up the grand staircase to the second floor. Everything seemed cold and colourless as he drifted along as if in a trance. He smoothed a hand over his slightly dishevelled hair and grimaced as the cold wintery air settled in his bones. It was far too dreary a day to be rifling through papers and getting accounts in order. He didn't want to do it and his father's solicitors had dealt with most of it including the reading of the will, which was all well and good but it left Draco with dealing with the private matters that only he and his family knew about. It wasn't that much of a secret that Lucius' accounted would immediately be shared out amongst Narcissa, Draco and Severus. Not that he cared about any of the accounts themselves. It was only because Mother wasn't fairing too well that he was taking another duty on his shoulders. Not that he could blame her for that.
Harry laughed lightly, "I'm twenty-two, Draco. You're only five years older than me. It'd take a lot longer than that for me to even breathe near Snape's ranks no matter how hard I push myself."
He couldn't deny it was nice having some people watching out for him, now that he no longer sparked fear in his fellow pupils.
Cass merely smiled, "you're welcome. Make sure to stop by and say goodbye tomorrow before you leave."
Blaise had been reading by the light of a 'Lumos' charm when Draco drifted into the dormitories. He had the largest, soppiest grin on his face that Blaise cringed a little when he saw it. He watched from his best as the blonde shucked out of his clothes and into pyjamas in a matter of seconds, before collapsing backwards onto his bed with a large, contented sigh. His hair was an utter mess. He looked thoroughly fucked.
do. Despite not wanting to be presumptuous he really wanted to see if there was anything more between them. Or if, perhaps, there could be.
Draco cracked an eyelid open and grumbled. "Exhausted ... You sure know how to wear a man out, scarhead."
Harry reached out and rested a hand on Draco's knee, smoothing his thumb over the strong, lean muscles under the cloth, "I do like taking care of you, even now. It's just –easier to do out of love and of my desperate need to not see you ill, than to feel I'm obliged to do so because I'm technically your physician." He smiled over at the blonde who had a vague smirk on his face, "I'm glad that Severus explained it all to you, though. I just know I would have mucked it up and make it sound like a personal insult to you."
They cuddled up on the sofa, side-by-side, their shoes cast aside at the foot of the sofa, and their plates balanced on their laps. Harry was not very hungry, but he didn't want to waste Draco's money, so he ate slowly and enjoyed the movie, unaware that Draco kept casting him glances out of the corner of his silver eyes.
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders, "well it's a little holiday, isn't it? One of us has to think of something to do each minute of the day."
He felt his chest constrict as the words and the memories assaulted him. He pressed his fingers against his temples, clenched his eyes shut tight and when that didn't work, he stood up and went over to his decanter of whisky and poured some of the amber liquid into a glass and down it at once, the burning liquid surging down his throat and lighting his chest on fire. He choked out a couple of coughs before pouring himself another two-fingers of whiskey and taking it back over to his chaise and slumped down in it, the fire heating him from the grate and his eyes slightly unfocused as he drifted back to that summer.
"You can't possibly know that, Draco, but I am grateful for your support. I wouldn't be able to do any of this without you," Harry sighed and leaned his head back on the tree trunk.
Draco let out a dry chuckle, "Yeah, I guess so. It's a lot easier than I thought," he stated with a quirked eyebrow. To his surprise, Harry chuckled too as they both settled down against the fireplace, the firelight dancing over Draco's legs. They sipped at their drinks and talked in soft tones about nothing in particular. It was comfortable and calming and a much better way to spend the night.
It was along this hallway, as Draco slipped his arms out of his waistcoat that he let his eye drift over the photos mounted on the walls in black, matte frames. They were four moments that Draco adored and couldn't help but smile at every time he walked by. They were of their best four dates -so far. There was the one where Harry had somehow convinced him to go ice-skating in muggle Paris. That had NOT been fun, despite how cute they both looked clumsily skating, with ear muffs and thick scarves.
"Eurgh, he's been waxing poetic all evening before dinner even started. I almost fell asleep listening to him! He said he was tempted to send Potter some soppy nonsense via owl, but he seemed to realise that Potter doesn't like that sort of public nonsense." She waved the thought away, "Merlin, I'm hungry. Pass me the potatoes."
Draco snickered lightly and drained the last of his own flute and shook his head, his blonde hair not moving a fraction. "No, I find that I have been spending a lot of my current time being on the receiving end of the healers hands instead of getting to help anybody unfortunately."
Draco's eyes narrowed on him, his arms folded across his chest seemed to tighten a fraction. "You'd better have a damn sight more to say to me than 'hi', Potter," he sneered out weakly, the bags under his eyes darkening as he narrowed them even further.
Removing his hand from Potter's jeans, Draco grimaced at he slick, sticky mess coating his hand. He pulled out his actual wand and vanished the mess before turning to a red-cheeked, panting Potter. It really was a delicious sight. "See you around then, Potter," he smirked as he straightened his robes and swiftly left the library.
"I must have had some Felix Felicis, because I think I'm about to get lucky," Draco smirked as he reached for the front of Harry's shirt and dragged him towards his body before slamming the brunette boy up against the wall. He cupped Potter's -no -
The words made Harry feel embarrassed but he didn't understand why. He merely allowed himself to be pulled down until he was leaning over Draco. He could feel the breath rushing down his chest from where the blonde was breathing up against him. He could feel every muscle in his body vibrating with anticipation as Draco reached up with quavering fingers to gently tousle through Harry's dark hair. To his surprise, he felt that the blonde man's touch was exciting him in a way he wasn't used to. It unnerved him but a tiny voice in the back of his head insisted he didn't want it to stop. He felt tense as Draco dared to trail his fingers lower, down the length of his flushed throat and drifting down his chest muscles and tickling the trail of dark hair at the top of his abdomen. "Draco … What are you doing?" he finally managed to breathe
Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's forehead, "I'll cook you up some nice hot chicken soup when we get you home, alright?"
"Down London," Draco was grateful as Cass came and hauled one of the cases, which was literally a large duffel bag, over his shoulder and beckoned for them to follow him.
"Not to mention that the teachers aren't doing anything about it. As far as they're concerned there might as well be no Slytherin's in the school right now," Harry muttered dryly as he fell into step beside Hermione as they wandered over towards the lake. "Try not to take it so hard," Harry found himself saying.
. Especially Ginny. She loved to rehash that saying almost every heated discussion they had with one another these days. He hated it when they said that. They would never know how he felt, what dying felt like, how he'd died long before those slit-red eyes had landed on him. But Draco hadn't said any of those things, he'd simply understood out of context what it had been like for him.
Draco peered around the banister to make sure that no one was watching, before pulling his wand out of his sleeve and casting a weightless charm on Harry's body, "up you get, scarhead, time for bed" Looping an arm underneath Harry's body, Draco hauled the younger man to his feet and helped to guide him up the staircases to their room. Harry did not protest as he was guided.
He looked down to see their golden retriever padding up to him, and nudging his knee with the side of its head, the big watery brown eyes looking up at him in a silent question of why he was returning home alone yet again, and why wasn't their other master with him? He didn't know what to tell him; there were no more words left to say on the matter. He was sure that he had said them all. Doe-like eyes became downcast and the tail stopped wagging expectantly. The padding noise echoed as their dog walked gloomily over to the dog-bed beside him favourite armchair. His armchair; the one he had gone out of his way in search of and had not gotten it –because his boyfriend had gotten to it first. For him. As a present.
Draco sniffed and tried to stop tears from forming in his eyes once again, to no avail, as he curled up on his side under the bed and continued running his trembling fingers through the dog's glossy fur.
"Did you decide on what would become of the manor?" Harry asked as he hung his drenched cloak on the coat rack and cast a drying spell on it.
She shared a knowing glance with Blaise when Draco was predictably paired up with Potter. She slipped out of her desk to join Granger, with a note passed over to Blaise declaring that they needed to meet in the classroom again after curfew. He nodded silently as he moved next to Longbottom.
Harry tugged the fabric of his hospital gown, "can you transfigure this into a pair of fleece pyjamas, please?" he whispered, his breath tickling Draco's ear.
Draco smiled and hugged Harry even closer to his warm chest. He ignored the prod of Harry's bones through his skin and clothes and focused on warming the younger mans' body. Despite the warm temperature, Harry seemed prone to the cold. "I'm just glad that you have managed to keep all this food down."
"It's natural to be afraid of the things that we don't understand or fully know about," he stated matter-of-factly, "If your son is afraid then it might be partially psychological and he hinders his own progression with medicine by his mind rejecting any help without intention."
There were no objections and so within a few moments Harry found himself walking alongside Lord Malfoy, feeling as inferior as humanly possible, as they walked out on the outskirts of the garden of the hotel. They walked in silence for a little while and with no champagne flute in his hand to distract him and fumble with, Harry felt a little more vulnerable than he had been for the entire trip so far. "Now Mister Potter, I know that you did in fact say something that upset Draco last night and I would like to enquire as to what it was."
He felt the wind explode in his lungs and saw stars swim about in his blurred vision as he tried to kick up away from the tangle of weeds without much success. Bubbles drifted from his nostrils and through a gap in his lips. He kicked his legs as much as he could but it was difficult seeing as Draco's dead weight in his arms was threatening to drag them back down to the murky grey depths and the tangle of black-green weeds tickling at their heels, as well as their soaked clothes clinging to them.
"Woke up to your screaming, didn't I?" he hissed, his eyes pouring venom out into the open air, "how DARE you talk to him like that? How fucking -dare you!" he advanced closer, making the nurse back up against the desk. From over the nurses' head Draco could see eyes turning to stare. "You have no right to be working here if you are not neutral to peoples backgrounds, you pathetic bitch!"
"Shh, shh," Harry hushed him with a finger against his lips. "Don't worry about it, it'll feel good."
Harry chuckled. It was a sweet sound. The waves whispered in front of them, frothing weakly upon the sand. "I love you, Draco," he breathed against the shell of Draco's ear.
"Well initially I had meant to start two years ago but due to my mother's poor health I had to postpone until this year. I have only been with him a few months, since January, so not too long really. However, in my last review he did mention that I have progressed a great deal more past the others and he feels that I may be able to take on a few more duties once we return back to Calais." He turned to look Draco up and down and didn't know why he found himself surprised at the expensive cut of his dress robes and the expensive snake signet rink adorning his pale finger. "What is it that you do? Have you ever thought to study under your godfather and learn the trade of being a Healer?"
"Grow up," he smiled as she huffed weakly beside him, her lips twitching slightly. He reached out a hand and squeezed her shoulder, "I didn't think I'd see the day you felt sympathy for Malfoy, Hermione."
Harry nodded so hard that Severus feared that his head would fall off his shoulders. "Would it be possible to send him a telegram straight away? I know there may not be a response until tomorrow evening, but as it's Tuesday morning I can easily get started on preparing any potions I can take for the rest of the week."
With a sigh he dropped him down into his desk chair and clawed his hands through his usually immaculate hair. He didn't want to wake up tomorrow morning because if he woke up, cold and alone, he would then have to suffer the arduous journey of travelling back to Brittany with Harry excusing himself to brew potions that didn't need restocking, or rushing off the hospital despite him having a long weekend holiday marked off in the registry. All he wanted was for the man to love him again, was that really such a terrible thing? They'd been happy up until recently, hadn't they? Or was he just deluding himself? With a dry sniff, he reached for his quill and made another bullet point on the page, watching as the tiny drop expanded out into the grain. He let his hand go through the motions of the letters, watching the ink crawl and curve along the page.
Draco was close to going mad. Every nerve was humming like a live wire through his muscles. He couldn't remember the last time he'd gotten such an adrenaline high from sex. Of course, sex with Harry was always amazing and left him burning long after they'd stopped, but this -was a whole new level! His heart was humming loudly in his chest, he was pretty sure he'd forgotten how to breathe.
Harry shifted slightly and entwined his left hand with Draco's right, over their knees. He squeezed. "I trust you, Draco. People trust you. That is my wish ... see? I even made it official." At Draco's frown, Harry shifted so as to dig something out of his jeans pocket. What he produced was a rather crumpled origami crane. Draco couldn't help it -he burst out laughing.
Draco rolled his eyes and swallowed down the snicker. It wouldn't go down well, not with Harry looking that distressed. He reached out and took one of Harry's hands in his own and gaze it a firm squeeze. "There's something that's been on your mind for a year and you haven't told anyone about it?"
Draco waited for a moment, watching as Harry disappeared into their adjoining bedroom and made short work of stripping out of his soaked clothes and hanging them about the dry around the fireplace before coming back to seat himself in the armchair across from Draco. "I found your letters this afternoon whilst I was clearing out fathers study. All the documents had been put in there. I'd almost forgotten about them completely until I found them today."
"Early," Harry whispered, his voice carrying across the silent room. He couldn't keep the wetness out of his words.
Draco leaned backwards and braced himself lightly on Harry's thighs and eased himself up and down along Harry's thick, pulsing erection. Harry's skin felt soft and sweaty beneath his hands as he quickened his pace, moans escaping from both of them. "D-Draco ... think I'm gonna-" The sound of Harry's orgasm ripping out from his mouth was enough to send Draco over the edge as well, hot, white cum exploding all over Harry's chest.
They had gotten the name for their puppy for his amazing ability to find either one of them whilst playing hide-and-seek.
Harry was starting to see a bitter side of Ginny that he didn't really like. Not that it would have changed much between them if she hadn't been bitter. He sighed and blinked in surprise that he had come further than he'd thought.
"Can be delivered via owl. Next?" The nurses' mouth opened and closed soundlessly. "Good. I shall be off then."
He didn't know if Potter did masturbate, but something was making him far too tense and it was getting ridiculous, seeing the tendons in his neck throbbing with suppressed anger and, no doubt, fear.
Draco inclined his head, the dark circles under his eyes looking like deep holes by candlelight, "Yes, I want us to go on a boat ride tomorrow afternoon. I want us to talk; about anything, nothing if you'd prefer, but I just want to spend some time with you, where you don't go running off like you're afraid to be near me."
"I did miss you, you know?" Draco finally muttered softly, as he looked up to find Harry watching him intently, "I just didn't know if I was allowed to after … everything."
Harry shook his head, ignoring the disappointment he felt. "No, that's fine. Just don't be too long otherwise all the carriages will go." Draco nodded and smiled before he went to disappear down the stairs that led to the dungeons. Harry felt his shoulders slump but told himself not to be stupid. He'd be back in a matter or minutes, so why was he worrying?
"Of course. You're so restrained most of the time. I love being able to get wound up and then this relaxed."
He knew Slughorn wouldn't. None of the professors could be bothered with Death Eater scum like himself. The water clouded his vision and for that a part of him was grateful. "Come on Malfoy!" someone taunted, "Where's your precious Daddy now?"
Draco's expression was soft, a mask-less face he only let Harry see and only when they were completely alone together, as he waited for the brunette to speak.
That night they had all been allowed enough time to bathe themselves and have an early dinner so that they could be ready for the long walk to the hotel. The walk was to mentally prepare themselves for when they met the people congregating at the hotel; there were to be a lot of head aurors and professors, even some people who worked for the Paris Ministry of Magical Defence and various high-up pureblood families, even a few who had come from Germany and Italy. Harry had felt a little queasy at the thought of being around so many socialites and wealthy people, including prospective medical students and other people who were on a small break from neighbouring universities. It made him feel a little on edge but he had been psyching himself up all night to get ready for the long weekend. They had three nights of this and he was determined to do it.
She sighed and after another ten minutes in silence she decided to leave for The Burrow. "Alright, well, you know where to floo whenever you want company," he nodded his head but did not turn to face her as she threw a pinch of floo-powder into the fireplace fixed into the wall behind the armchair she had been sitting in. She made one last attempt at getting him to talk, "so what do you plan on doing for the rest of the day?"
He didn't know how long he was disorientated and bedridden but he remembered vague flashes of Severus diagnosing him as he drifted in and out of unconsciousness, and Narcissa murmuring beside him that she knew it wasn't his fault but they shouldn't have gone on the boat right with Draco's condition. They were both being stupid boys. By the time he finally revived enough to glance around his bedchamber and scrutinize the dark-haired man soaking a washcloth and laying it over his forehead, he felt weak and sweaty and his eyeballs hurt as they rotated in their sockets. His throat was parched when he tried to speak and wasn't too much better once Severus had given him some water. "How are you feeling?" Severus asked in his usual monotonous drawl. Harry forced his shoulders to shrug awkwardly against his ears, the muscles feeling heavy and weaker than he remember them. Out of the corner of his eye he watched Severus nod his head and then pull a book into his lap and began reading. Within the hour, Harry finally blinked up at the ceiling and felt that his head was substantially clear for the first time in what seemed like forever.
Blaise blinked in surprise at the words on the page. So Draco really had loved Potter all this time? And Scarhead had reciprocated? Apparently so, considering the state that Draco had arrived back to the dungeons in. Despite himself, he found himself smiling at the prospect of Draco finally satiated and above all things happy. He was still a little sceptical, however. The following morning at breakfast, when Draco and Harry walked in smiling like utter idiots and matching hickey's just barely visible over their collars -easily spotted when you knew what to look for -Blaise felt himself smirk into his cereal as he ducked his head down. Pansy and Theo hissed questions under their breath but when he was personally asked if he knew anything, he merely smiled smugly, relishing in the knowledge for a little while longer. Not only was it because finally, the sexual tension -for the most part -had been cut in half between the bespectacled git and his blonde roommate, but also because Blaise had actually been right all along.
"I'll see you tomorrow morning at breakfast, okay?" Draco breathed as he stroked his thumb over Harry's soft tanned skin.
Those words sent a shot of panic through Draco's nervous system. Was it their anniversary? Surely he hadn't forgotten one? Harry wouldn't be acting so calm if he had. Licking his lips, he straightened. "Remember what?" he asked.
Draco didn't miss the latch in Harry's voice. Even after all these years the guilt could still assault him in raw, hungry waves and it made his heart ache to watch his companion suffer.
Draco smirked as he held onto Harry's body. He sneered over at the nurse, "I suggest you go and fetch a wheelchair, it's protocol after-all for all departing patients." The nurse threw Draco the dirtiest look she could master before stalking off down the corridor. Draco turned back to Harry who had collapsed into one of the plastic chairs dotted around in the waiting area opposite the desk. A few people gave him sympathetic looks as how thin he was and the bald, shadow-less head. Draco walked over, offering similar smiles to the on-lookers, before easing himself down beside Harry, a hand running up and down his lover's cold, exposed back. "You shouldn't exert yourself, love. Energy is a precious gift for you at the moment."
"I feel oddly touched," Harry admitted dryly, "That my death would have made you want to die. Almost like you'd want to join me."
Once at Blackpool Tower they noticed that there was a special offer for all of the tourist attractions -and it would only cost them £35 each! It was a bargain.
He let the note drift out of his hands and spiral down onto the floor. It was Potter. Potter had been doing all of this for him. He should have expected it truth be told but he hadn't and that should have made him feel pathetic.
Harry couldn't hide the flush that crept up onto his cheeks as he followed Draco along a maze of marble corridors and towards his bedchamber. His bedchamber was dimly lit by two tall narrow windows on the wall opposite the four poster bed and the large ornate desk pressed up in the wall space between them. Walking over to the large wardrobe with wide oak doors, Harry watched as the tall blonde shifted through its contents before pulling out a few bags that contained beautiful dress robes that Harry found his mouth hanging open at the mere sight of them. A few maids wandered into the room and all too soon Harry found himself on a small stood having the smallest of the three dress robes, pinned and altered around his shorter frame and numerous jittering instructions to tell him that he needed to stop moving about. Harry watched as amused smirks played on Draco's lips as he sat in a chair and watched it all with delight playing in his grey eyes.
The first incident had happened on the third of December about two weeks after Potter had blatantly stalked him to the Room of Requirement. He hadn't been sleeping too well in the last couple of days and his shower had been jinxed to spray him with a strange sort of liquid that made him stink of burnt fish to the point he hadn't washed properly in several days. He'd used charms and glamour's and an old bottle of his father's after-shave to conceal the obviousness of it, but he hadn't done too well a job, it would seem.
He did not want to give up but how -in the name of Merlin -was he supposed to write about their life together? Where would he even START?
Draco didn't seem too concerned as he leaned even more over the edge to grasp out at the willow branches, their slender vines of green leaves running through his fingers. Harry had held some hope that Draco would be paying attention to where they were drifting. When they eventually bumped into a large rock protruding through the water and the boat jostled heavily to one side, he whipped around to yell at Draco just in time to see his long legs disappearing over the edge and into the lake. Harry froze, his knuckles turning white as he grasped the oars. It couldn't be that deep surely? Draco could swim, couldn't he? How had those questions never come up before between them? No, he was positive that Draco could swim. This wasn't his first time at the Lake District after all. True to his memory, Draco's blonde head exploded from the frothing water at last, his mouth open in a silent scream for air, his arms flaring up over his head. Harry watched as still as a statue, his skin turning as cold as marble as he watched Draco struggling to keep his head above water, the thrashing in the water making the boat rock haphazardly and the water becoming more and more agitated as it sucked Draco back under, drowning out his choking screams for Harry to help him.
"I'm sorry –I'm just –happy," the blonde managed to choke as he threw an arm to hide his weeping eyes.
Dropping the pale legs unceremoniously, Harry leaned right over Draco so that his pale legs were pushed up against his chest. They were nose-to-nose as Harry dipped his head to capture his mouth in a hot, passionate kiss with chapped lips nipping and sucking at one another before his teeth drew Draco's bottom lip out and suckled once again. Their bodies were hot and salty with sweat, plastered together as Harry –after a few more deep thrusts –came hot and heavy inside his husband, his face contorted into that of both pleasure and pain as he collapsed on top of Draco at a somewhat awkward angle, just in time for the older man's cum to spurt out and hit his chin.
Draco sighed and hunched his shoulders, "Look, it won't be easy, but you've looked out for me a lot and I think I need to return the favour. We can do that if we're friends." He looked at Harry, "I want to be friends, and I want to start the New Year with a better perspective than I've had it the last few months. I don't want to be worried every time I walk through the halls."
, stop trying to make me admit that I am only here because of how inconvenient it would be for me to be elsewhere, because that is never going to happen, Harry."
Stepped up so that they were a few inches part, Harry moaned low in his throat. "Well ... it was our twelfth date and you didn't want me to go home so ..."
He didn't know how Harry faired having his own bed to himself for a couple of days. Harry seemed almost reluctant to talk about most things, such a drastic contrast to how he had been even a year ago. Draco couldn't help but think that maybe it was something that he had done unintentionally, that had angered the brunette. He couldn't think of anything that wouldn't have been settled after a small disagreement. He wished he could go and talk to him, despite it being almost one o'clock in the morning. He had too much on his mind and he really just wanted to have Harry's beautiful voice lull his nerves into a sleep state so that he wouldn't feel too stressed. He rung his hands around the end of his cotton sheet –something he'd cherished no matter how small it was, since that month he'd first met the younger man. He sighed and flopped back down on his pillows, glaring up at the canopy of his bed and closed his eyes closed a couple of times, trying to even out his breathing and ignore the throbbing in his chest.
It had been on one of overly busy days at the shop and Draco had been left to his own devices to help everyone as Harry had been called out to an emergency in the hospital of an auror having gotten attacked. He'd dashed out as quickly as possible with only a chaste kiss to the lips as Draco watched his lover disappear out of the door. He only spoke throughout the rest of the day when dealing with customers. There had been a bunch of people putting down their names and payments for the new ointment that would help men grow their facial hair out. It had been increasingly popular as a cosmetic sort of treatment, however Harry's report on the psychological aspects could greatly improve the mental stability of most men suffering from low self-esteem and fewer lives would be lost due to depression. As soon as that exert alone had been printed in the local newspaper many women flocked to Brittany to pre-order the ointment that would be available right before the Christmas holidays.
"Dismally boring," Draco huffed, "But go ahead if you must. Just let me know when I have to have my stupid bath," the blonde groused as he folded his arms back over his chest.
He wished desperately that he could bring that teasing light back to Harry's eyes, but he didn't know what he could do that wouldn't irritate the brunette man. He slid his hand across the table top and gently touched Harry's fingertips with his own, smiling weakly in the candlelight. It took a few light touches before Harry's own twitched in response, and leaned over a little so that they would link their fingertips together. It made Draco's chest ache painfully, so painfully it almost hurt him to breathe properly without the threat of tears, that this was the most willing Harry had been able to touch him in a fortnight. They hadn't made love, not properly, for just over a month. Whenever they did, Harry made sure that it was over with quickly and didn't seem 'all there' during, which really put Draco off from enjoying the experience. He wanted to be 'one' with Harry; mind, body and soul. All Harry was giving him at the moment was his body, and sometimes it was rarely even that. They used to wake up every morning a tangle of limbs splashed golden in the sunlight filtering in through the blinds, their hair messed up and their hips pressed into one another's so tightly that neither of them were willing to disentangle themselves from the sweet, sweaty mess of limbs. Now it was like there was a schism between them, growing larger by the day. They now almost always slept on opposite ends of the bed, but it wasn't for Draco's lack of trying. Sometimes he would pretend to sleep until Harry eventually fell unconscious, before he would shuffle his body over the warm sheets and curl up against the tanned man's body. He'd press his nose into Harry's neck, the hairs on the nape of his neck tickling his mouth, as he pulled the younger man back against him, cradling him through the night.
He glanced at his watch. 9:02am. Harry had only been able to sleep another few fitful hours in a sickly sweat, whilst Draco had been able to do anything other than cradle his lover and croon softly to him. When Harry had awoken again, he found Draco perched upon the bed with a mug full of chicken noodle soup in his hands. It seemed to have worked and stayed down as Harry had no thrown it up at all. He had not even heaved.
Harry chuckled lightly and then slipped his hand under the velvet of the ring, and drew out a gold chain with the ring looped on it, "You can wear it around your neck. I know this may seem mad but I just wanted to show you just how much I love you. Sometimes I get worried that one day 'something' may happen and you wouldn't know just how much I do love you." Draco felt his eyes drop and then felt Harry hook a finger underneath his chin and tilt it up, "I promise that I will love you and care for you for as long as either of us shall live."
Suffice to say after the celebrations back at the tower he couldn't help but feel at a loss with what to do with himself. Malfoy had -in some weird sense -saved his arse. Now it left him feeling incredibly awkward as he toyed with the egg in his hands. He could only hope that he could solve this particular clue in time for the Second Task.
"Mr. Malfoy?" he startled out of his reverie, the irregular crane clutched between loose fingers. A nurse was hovering beside him, frowning down at him. He swallowed and nodded. "You can come in and see him now"
Draco snickered lightly and rolled up into a sitting position as Harry rolled over to ease himself off of the bed. "Do you want a shower or are you going to run a bath?" he did not mind running the bath for Harry, the poor young man had most likely exerted himself to his maximum limit.
He watched as Harry's angry body tensed slightly, the hushed whispering of ragged breaths being drawn in an attempt to quell his frustration. "Yes, Draco?" came the strained voice after a few silent moments.
Rubbing his hand down his face he shuffled over into the Great Hall for lunch just as his stomach let out a ferocious growl. He headed over to the Slytherin table and settled down at the end with Pansy, Draco and Theodore Nott. He couldn't deny he was a little relieved to have at least three familiar faces surrounding him. As he piled food onto his plate and poured himself some pumpkin juice, he couldn't deny he was intrigued by the reddish hue of Draco's cheek that looked as though he'd been punched, albeit, with not much force. Cocking an eyebrow, he asked, "What happened to your cheek, Draco?"
Shaking his head he wordlessly excused himself from the table and let his heavy feet drag his body over the bright green grass down to the small dock leading out a few metres into the lake. Draco was already waiting there, his hair gleaming in the sunlight. Despite the bags under his own eyes and the restless night he'd had, the blonde man still managed to look impressive and somewhat happy. Was he really that excited about spending some quality time with Harry? It couldn't be true. It just didn't seem to make any sense. Something stiff stirred in his chest as his mind wandered back over the night before and how oddly comforting it had been nestled in the crook of Draco's arms. The feeling had been a dulled down, muffled echo of what 'comfort' used to feel like, but the fact that any feelings at all had penetrated the dull blackened numbness surrounding his mind. With a sigh he let Draco walk ahead of him a few paces whilst he stuffed his hands into his pockets. The wooden planks creaked underfoot as the water glistened brightly on either side of the narrow pier. If he didn't have his hands out, he wouldn't feel the urge to push Draco over the wooden beam barrier. He dug his nails sharply into his palms regardless, just in case the urge spiralled too far out of control.
Draco smiled and watched as Harry drifted back along the corridor. "Hey Potter!" he called out when the brunette boy was several meters away. Harry turned with a faint frown. Draco smiled even wider, "I love you!" he called out, his cheeks hurting a little with all the smiling.
Back in the Great Hall a lot of the Gryffindors were still murmuring, some about what had happened including the former rival, and the rest about what else was going on in their lives. Unfortunately Theo, Pansy and Blaise were three of the few discussing the unlikely pair. "What were you thinking?" Pansy hissed across the table at Blaise, "Now the whole school is going to hop onto the Slytherin's-cursed-Potter band-wagon."
Harry shook his head and let out a watery sigh as he buried his face into the goose-down, "How can you ask me to do such a thing after everything I have done to you?"
Draco snorted, "Are you kidding? No offence, Potter, but being the Boy Who Lived has its perks. Until the day you die people will reason that defeating the Darkest man of all wizarding history, is more of a merit to your name and magical ability than any piece of paper saying you passed. I'm pretty sure you'll be blindly marked anyway as soon as they see your name."
It was a while until the shower spray shut off. It had been going on so long that Draco was tempted to go into the bathroom and make sure that Harry was alright. But the brunette man was soon coming out of the bathroom, a healthy glow blossoming on his cheeks and towel-drying his body. Draco smiled, "do you feel better?"
Harry frowned. That hadn't been an answer he'd been expecting. Surely he should be encouraged to get all of his education and a job afterwards. Why was Draco saying the opposite? "Um ... Why do you say that?"
"I'm not expecting you to," the ex-healer insisted as he leaned back in his own chaise, "But even if you talk to him about the weather or the family of moths in your fathers study, you need to do this for him. Just this and nothing else."
She'd struck a nerd. She knew she had in the way his high cheekbones flared a pink colour. His jaw tensed and he avoided his gaze, "N-No, I just want to know if that's a good idea or not. I want to spend more time with him, it just so happens that this weekend is also Valentines day. No big deal, really."
Those were the sounds of the rail that his train carriage was being pulled along on. It rocked from side to side through the gloom of the heavy twilight, the damp clinging to the paving stones as they passed from station to station, and the swollen black clouds made it appear much later than the time present on his muggle pocket watch. Cracking open his bleary eyes he felt a chill run through him and drew his arms tighter around his stomach. Another half an hour and he'd be walking up the narrow alleyway towards his large flat above the apothecary. He had finally worked up to being a full-fledged Healer, degree, certificates and everything. He had been so proud and excited when he'd gotten the news from Severus that he would be relieving some of his own duties on to Harry. It had taken the better part of six years, but along with Draco's inheritance –his mother had decided that if her grandchildren were not going to get it then Draco should invest it however he saw fit –they managed to buy an old apothecary from an elderly man who had wanted to retire. They got the building fairly cheap, but winning over the business partners were another matter entirely.
Hermione felt her tears prick with tears and her chest constrict sharply with the flurry of emotions within her. She rubbed a hand over her chest and gave the blond a small smile, though he was back to staring at the blank television screen. "That sounds lovely" she breathed before stepping into the floo and departing for The Burrow.
He confronted Draco later that afternoon right after they'd all accompanied Narcissa outside once again for a two hour long lunch, talking mindlessly about the latest things that had been reported in the news, how Lucius had to travel to London, of all places, in September but how excited she was that she would get to breathe some different air for a time. They'd all nodded along as she more or less chatted to herself, before they all went their separate ways inside the manor. It was back in the drawing room where Draco was spending his time reading up on the latest medical journals; he enjoyed the reading even though the voice in his head was nowhere as nice as when Harry had read to him all those years ago. He used to have such passion in his voice but recently he had lacked everything that made him 'Harry' or even human for that matter. He had his finger pressed underneath his bottom lip, his brow furrowed in concentration as he read the words before him, soaking only half of it in, when the door creaked open and slammed shut behind his godfather's presence. "Draco may I have a word with you?" he asked curtly, striding over and seating himself across the hearth in an identical armchair. He crossed one leg over the other and steeped his fingers before him, elbows propped up on the arms.
"They're arseholes who would gain more publicity by a brave organized rescue mission for Harry rather than admit that they were so negligent that he decided to leave of his own free will!" Hermione snorted, clearly not believing a word that was coming out of his mouth, "just go, please? We have a lot to do today"
The lake lapped gently as the shore as they settled down on a grassy knoll and looked across the expanse of the glossy grey surface. They remained silent as they both collected their thoughts and tried to ease the tension twisting around in their stomachs.
Draco, who had been ready just to kick back with a mug of tea in front of the TV, was suddenly hardwired and pressing up against his tightening trousers. "Don't keep me waiting, Potter," he growled.
Every nerve ending was on fire as Harry picked up his pace. With Draco half on his side, with one leg clasped to Harry's chest the pleasure just crashed down on him like wave after hard, earth-shattering wave.
The man in the doorway tugged the hood from around his face with eyes that made the blonde's stomach knot, "Nice to see you too, dear husband."
He placed the hat on Harry's head and bent over the back of the chair to press a kiss upon his boyfriend's mouth. He then gripped the handle bars of the wheel chair and began his struggle home, his head held high into the air, daring anyone to mess with them.
He shivered suddenly, though he did not feel cold at all. He did not feel anything, if he was being painfully honest with himself. Every day both indoors and out, he had slowly felt the life being sucked out of him, as though there were a dementor lingering around every corner but refusing to show itself. He reached up over the cabinet for the light switch. He wasn't in the mood for 'light' but he would need it if he was going to read or write anything. He flicked the light-switch and winced as the offensive light momentarily blinded him.
Harry mentally grumbled as he tightened his folded arms across his chest and glared out over the balcony of Severus' new summer house settled in the Lake District. He didn't know how Severus had managed to do it behind his back, but before he knew it, it had been entered into the registry that Harry had the first two weeks of August off on holiday leave and it was non-negotiable. Suffice to say he was not happy when he'd had to pack his trunk and join Draco, Narcissa, and Lucius on a train to the Lake District in the blazing heat of the August sunshine. He barely spoke at all the entire journey up there, not feeling the need to participate since he was already in such a horrible mood.
Harry backed them up until Draco's legs hit the bed. They came crashing down on the clean sheets, Harry's weight a long-missed feeling. Draco's hands clawed through Harry's hair as they attacked each other, kissing, biting and sucking on the skin being rapidly exposed to the other's gaze. Draco had to grumble when they had to manually undress. Ripping shirt buttons off and snapping leather belts against his skin only enraged his libido but it didn't help that he still didn't have Harry IN him yet.
"I just wanted a holiday, is that so bad?" Harry's voice broke and cracked sharply in Draco's ear as he gently rocked his lover against his chest. He knew the holiday was not Harry's idea, but he was pleased to know that Harry wanted the holiday instead of feeling as though he had forced the younger man.
Draco came into focus as he neared the bed and sat down on the edge of it, taking Harry'd knee up off the floor, and gently kneading the pained muscles, "it's only about a quarter to ten. You crashed for a spell, so I let you rest while I got everything ready."
The thought alone was enough to make his stomach churn and knot inside him, but he forced himself to ignore it. It was growing more difficult, the closer the day drew. Regardless, Draco was determined to keep his cool.
"Are you ready?" Harry's throaty whisper flooded his sense. Draco looked up at his lover, a tan God with flushed cheeks and messy, sweaty hair. He gave a shaky nod. Harry smiled breathlessly before bending down to press a hot kiss to the blonde's mouth. He then stretched out his arm and swiped a small foil packet of the bedside table.
Stars flashed before Draco's eyes when Harry's head entered him. He clenched, making Harry hiss in pleasure, his strong hand gripping Draco's hips possessively. Draco felt both of their bodies quiver as he lowered himself until he had fully sheathed Harry's cock. He moaned, arching his back and gripping the table behind him.
?" Severus spat out, making Draco flinch at the rage smothered in his voice. "It's no wonder either of you are looking as though you're suffering an illness. You both look like you haven't eaten or slept properly in weeks." He sighed and ground his teeth together, "I am not taking no for an answer from either of you two. A couple of weeks away are going to do you both a world of good. And at least I will be there to make sure that you are both eating and sleeping properly. Now, before tonight, I want you to write down a list of all of the things that you both haven't been doing in the last couple of months. I mean everything, even if it makes you feel guilty, like skipping out on your potions one evening just because you felt rebellious. I need you to do it for Harry as well because somehow I don't believe he would be honest with me right now."
"I can't ... wait," Harry managed to say as a yawn stretched his pink mouth wide open. Draco rolled his eyes and after a few more clicks, he shut the laptop down and placed it on his bedside table.
They had shared many laughs even as they'd strolled along the sea-front, skimming their cloaks along the damp sand and getting the froth of the waves hitting against their shoes before the sand soaked it up again.
As he settled down at the Slytherin table he caught sight of Harry nodding his head, his lips pressed tightly together to try and suppress his smile.
Draco pushed him up against the bedroom door and placed both of his arms on either side of Harry's head, "I beg to differ," he breathed, rubbing the ends of their noses together. Harry was about to push him away and protest when suddenly his arms were pinned over his head and his mouth was silenced by Draco's tongue forcing its way between his lips. He couldn't deny his blatant excitement pushing up through his robes, and gasped when Draco pressed up against him, their hips rutting together through the coarse cloth.
He only had to wait another ten minutes before the blonde came back, looking a little drained but otherwise looking hopeful for the day ahead that they'd planned. He reached Harry and gestured for them to get going. He was about to mention the phial but decided that it could wait until lunch. He wasn't suffering from a headache right that moment. It weighed down in his pocket and bumped against his thigh as they made their way to one of the last carriages, before clambering up inside and sitting down.
The door to the room appeared with a weak groan and this time he didn't feel much hesitation holding him back as he pushed the handle and entered. Nothing else had changed and the fireplace still stood as proudly as possible off to one side. Only this time, he didn't have much time to admire the room as he felt a strong force barrel into him and pin his body against the rough wood of the door. He gasped as something sharp was pressed into his throat and he felt a fist punch him in the stomach, forcing him to drop his wand. He winced as he heard the wood skitter across the flagstones, no doubt being kicked away. He gasped out and just about drew in a lungful of air before a sharp slap whipped across his face. He yelled out and gripped his hand to his face as the fuming blonde stepped away from him, wand still digging into the base of his throat.
"Since when do you care about my skin, Potter?" he barked out, his voice hoarse from the screaming. Without waiting for a response Potter crossed the distance between them and tugged Draco's shirt out of his hands and threw it with a wet slap into the nearest sink. He then quickly tugged his own jumper over his head, unfastened the top two buttons of his soft, white shirt and pulled it over his head and held it out to Draco.
"I shouldn't have to spell these things out for you, Draco," Harry snipped irritably as he wriggled further down into the last clean sheet over his body. "If you wish to continue this then I see no reason in denying you now."
As he navigated the corridors, he replayed the conversation he'd had the other day at lunch time when he'd arrived late in the Great Hall after confronting Malfoy in the girls' bathroom. He had looked absolutely miserable and defeated. The look in his eyes had made him act on impulse and when he'd said this to his friends he was met with mixed responses; Hermione had stroked his hand and smiled, telling him that he was so much more grown up then she expected and that Malfoy needed a friend, or at the very least some compassion now that the war was over, Ron had forced himself to smile and returned to his food and Ginny and snorted at Hermione's statement, saying that people like Draco didn't deserve what they couldn't give others. She would have had a point, but then they had all been through a war and it changed people.
"I wish we didn't have to leave," Harry breathed as the sun kissed his face and a soft breeze combed over his features. Draco nodded his head. He, too, had no desire whatsoever to return home to dreary London. To a small flat that would have cold, uninviting floorboards to tread over. And yet it was their home, and they needed to return there to make sure that it remained their home. He clutched Harry tighter to his side and rested his head sideways upon his lovers cotton skullcap.
Harry's smile as the sunlight dappled his features, took Draco's breath away. They were standing outside their hotel, as Draco unloaded the two suitcases from the car boot and Harry held onto Seeker's lead with a semi-limp arm, his face up-turned towards the sky. Seeker seemed to be reveling in the sunshine as well -it was such a dramatic change from the on-off weather of London.
"Is that what made it so easy for you to do it?" Draco murmured softly. "The fact that you had mentally numbed yourself to the world you loved, psychologically erasing everyone and everything that meant something to you so that the last thing you would see was Him -the man you had all this unfinished business with. Did that make it easier for you to die?" His eyes refocused so that he could look at Harry properly.
Harry it down on his lip as he shifted himself between Draco's thighs and positioned his head against the blonde's stretched entrance, "Are you sure?" he asked one final time. As Draco's firm not, he slowly breached his lover's body, gasping as the ring of muscle tightened around him and waited for the blonde man to adjust. Soon Draco was shifting around him and thrusting ever so slightly, silently pleading for Harry to fill him up more and more until he could no longer stand it. Harry complied as slowly as he could without exploding inside his lover and before he knew it he was sheathed up to the hilt in Draco's delicious, sweating body.
Draco shrugged a shoulder not making any move to dislodge the hand from on top of his own, "I know you didn't. I didn't mean to snap. It's just been a long hard day and it just doesn't seem to end." He looked up at the green-eyed man beside him and turned his palm around and linked their fingers together. "I wish you could have stayed though. I thought Slughorn was in charge of the ward today anyway?"
He clawed his hands through his hair and struggled to keep the rage inside of how unfair it all was and how he wished he could take all of it back. He wanted a way out -any way -but there was nothing! Nothing but the torment and the torture and the nightmares. He just wanted to sleep, to get away from everything, to have just one moment of peace from the world tormenting him.
And then ... nothing. Frowning, he turned around, his back against the table he saw Harry perched in his chair slowly rubbing his cock that was still glistening with Draco's saliva. Biting his lip, Draco dragged the chair forward slightly, braced his arms back against the table before easing himself onto Harry's lap, his lover's hot throbbing member seeking entrance.
"M'close!" the blonde grunted loudly. Mere moments later his orgasm ripped through him and came hot and heavy in Harry's aching, sweating body. He tremored as the orgasm crashed over him with wave upon wave of pleasure, before he was emptied completely and collapsed down onto Harry's naked chest. He leaned up on his arms and stroked a stray strand of Harry's dark hair out of his eyes, "Mmm you're so beautiful, Harry," he murmured, feeling utterly exhausted.
Severus sighed but inclined his head, "Very well if that's all I'm going to get from you, then so be it."
He didn't even mind that he was paired with Potter for potions that morning. It had an odd sense of familiarity to it. He was grateful that Potter didn't try any small talk and didn't go out of his way to be sarcastic of snap whenever Potter did something wrong -which was only two times in the space of an hour. A new record, really. They still managed to tie with Granger and some seventh year named Buckley for the highest grade in the class. It should have made him happy, but the dementors that danced in the shadows sucked out the emotion before it could fully warm his heart. Instead, he nodded his head when Slughorn told them their grade, and was silently waiting for the bell to sound out for the end of the morning lessons.
The silence was nothing but a smothering darkness that seemed to seep into Draco's mouth and nostrils, slinking down to flood his lungs and stomach making him feel empty and desperate for air. He clung even tighter to Harry his dry eyes burning with raw emotion. "I know, baby, I know," Draco hushed with a trail of furious kisses along Harry's narrow throat. He heard a soft moan as Harry arched his neck against the hot mouth pressing upon his skin.
Harry let out a cry of sheer agony as his blood poured out of him and stained the floors. He felt his boy convulse and slump down onto the floor, Draco's roaring voice of anger toward his father, Voldemort, the Order, the Death Eaters and the Ministry blurring and distorting in his ears as he sank down onto the floor and let the darkness overwhelm him.
However, all that was yet to come and for that one moment on Christmas Eve they sat side-by-side in a comfortable silence, watching as the Room of Requirement gave them an early present of a beautifully decorated tree. It honestly was a beautiful tree and in a way, it would symbolize just how strong and grounded their friendship would eventually become. It would have its prickly moments but then no friendship was ever smooth sailing, but they couldn't deny it was an adventure for both of them, and this time it was an adventure that they were both looking forward to going on.
"Here you go, love," he smiled softly as he bent to lower the tray onto Harry's lap. Harry smiled up at him with a timid 'thanks'. Draco pressed a kiss to the cotton hat still adorning his lover's head, "do you want to watch a movie or plain old T.V.?"
They dressed in a comfortable silence and parted ways at the end of the corridor with a small peck on the lips and a gentle squeeze of the hands. As Harry turned to head back up to Gryffindor tower to get some semblance of sleep for the final task, Draco watched him go and prayed to Salazar that Harry would make it back in one piece.
He just hoped that Harry wouldn't go on any of those stupid dates on Valentines Day. He was planning to ask the bespectacled boy later on that evening if he wanted to go to Hogsmeade for the Saturday afternoon. It would be over-run by couples, but Draco just hoped that that meant that hardly anyone would pay them a second glance. It wasn't a secret that they were friends, but people still held grudges.
. "Harry what's going on between you and Malfoy? People are looking at you both and keep whispering," she asked, leaning over the table to keep the conversation a little more private.
"If I tell you the reasons why I've been avoiding Draco to such great lengths you won't even think me human, Severus," Harry murmured darkly, his pupils dilating as sleep tickled at the recesses of his mind.
He climbed back up the stairs to the main lobby where Harry was sitting on the bottom stair with his head resting softly in his hands. Draco frowned slightly and touched the thin man weakly, "hey love, I'm sorry about that."
Draco growled and nodded as he clutched Harry's hair tightly in his hand. "I said for you to take me to bed and make love to me!" he snarled low in his throat, the sound running straight down to his own growing arousal and making him tremble as he stood up and snatched Draco's hand and leaned up towards him.
Looking around the apartment from the front doorway, he could honestly say that nothing had changed since the day they had received the news. Nothing would change, really, he knew that now. He sighed shakily, his breathing coming out wet and hissing from his lips. A small tremor ruined his still posture as he went through the motions of digging his keys out of his front jacket pocket. It hadn't been too cold today, that's why he had worn the small black leather jacket instead of his high-necked coat he was used to. He gnawed on his bottom lip, his fingers feeling numb as they worked the zip down the front of his jacket. His wind-bitten cheeks were cold to the touch but he had to admit, he had barely felt the wind as it scraped against his skin on the walk home.
Blaise straightened up and looked over his shoulder at the Gryffindor table. Potter was sitting over there at his table, hunched over, with some mild bruising around his eye that wasn't completely covered by his weak glamour. Weasley and Granger were seated next to him but appeared deep in conversation with the she-weasel, all of them kept glancing over at their friend. Something was definitely off and bothering the boy. It looked as though a dark cloud was hovering over his head. Clearly he wanted to talk, but with his friends being a couple now and his obvious aversion to the she-weasel's company, he was stumped.
Tartan suddenly obscured his view of the sky and he dropped his arms and his gaze to see Harry stretching his arms high over both of their heads. He couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of Harry completely soaked through, his satchel slung around his wrist and his hair plastered down to his face. "We need to get you inside before you catch another fever!" Harry shouted over the roar of the rain that hammered down all around them, the tartan blanket providing barely any shelter as the torrent grew heavier and heavier. Draco didn't complain as Harry grabbed at his elbow and steered them towards one of the many back doors that led into the manor. As they stumbled in through to the marbled floor they almost slipped over as rain water dripped off them and puddled around the door. Draco bit back another bought of laughter as Harry draped the tartan blanket down and tried to soak up some of the rain water with the ringing wet blanket.
"To tell you the truth, Harry, I think it was a mistake for you to come back to Hogwarts. I know Hermione persuaded you and to be honest, if you didn't we wouldn't have reconciled our difference. Whilst I am grateful for that, and for you helping the Slytherin's get some measure of respect back, I don't think Hogwarts is a good place for you to be right now."
He blinked the voice aside and refocused his attention –providing he was awake of course –on the sleeping blonde, his arms curled underneath the pillow, his lips parted slightly as he breathed deeply. It really would be easy, he realised, to follow through with all those times he'd watched Draco sleep and had the dark thoughts, that he could simply lean over his sleeping body and grab the neglected pillow on the other side of the bed. He could stroke it in his hands as though it was made of fine Italian silk –knowing Severus and the Malfoy's it
"Come here, you, you need your sleep," he stated as he wriggled down the mattress, embracing Harry against his chest as he whispered 'nox' to the light.
He ground his teeth together as Draco awkwardly edged into one of the long boats, Harry clumsily shifting in behind him and taking the oars offered to him by an older man on the pier who then gently eased the boat out onto the water with his foot. It took a little while for him to work out how to row the oars but soon their boat was gliding out into the beautiful glassy surface of the lake, reflecting the bright blue of the sky and the vibrant greenery spiking out from the river banks and drifting down from the willow trees. Dappled by the sunlight, it really was a beautifully tranquil place to glide through on a lazy afternoon. The water trickled gently as he dipped the oars up and down through the glassy grey surface. He couldn't keep the darkness from swirling in his chest when he glimpsed over his shoulder and watched as Draco leaned over the edge of the boat, trailing his fingers through the rippling water as they glided along. A shiver ran through him as he steered the boat along. He didn't realise that the boat had veered off towards a deeper stream that branched off around an island, their boat and bodies becoming shaded by the dense willow branches entangled overhead.
A shiver ran through him as Draco stirred and finally cracked his eyes open and frowned heavily as he focused on Harry in the wicker chair. "Harry?" he rasped, his voice slurred and thick from sleep, "Mmmm what time is it?"
Behind them a chair manifested thanks to the room. The fireplace continued to crackle merrily, warming Draco's naked thighs as he pushed Harry down into the chair and dragged his trousers off his legs. He pressed long, passionate kisses over Harry's mouth, neck and chest as he ripped open his shirts. Buttons teetered over the flagstones, twinkling in the air. Harry panted and tugged at Draco's shirt, his legs spread and quaking with anticipation as Draco leaned over him, finally completely naked and highlighted with the glow from the fire. "Fuck you're sexy," he panted as he reached up and ran his hand down the blonde's muscled stomach.
"You really think it could be worse?" the blonde man asked as he wrapped a sheet around his shoulders, a cold shiver passing through him. He watched Harry's honest face betray his ignorance.
As they had arranged between that evening and that of Christmas Eve they two boys met up in the Room of Requirement to duel with one another. It wouldn't be all night long, although they both tried to go long enough until they were exhausted. They made it a rule that they could curse and yell and scream whatever they wanted during these sessions when they were duelling with one another. In doing so they found out a lot about one another, indirectly of course; Draco found out that Harry hated that Ginny was still sending him letters and many hints about them getting back together and that Harry was far beyond caring what anyone else thought -he didn't want to be with her and that was that. Likewise, Harry had found out that his testimony had kept Narcissa out of prison and had stopped Lucius getting a life-sentence, however the house arrest and restrictions to his magic had made Draco so emotionally challenged that he had now been registered as suffering from clinical depression. Draco had then found out that Harry felt lost with what he was meant to do now as he had been so sure he was going to die, at the same time that Harry found out that Draco's parents had been in talks in marrying him off to some pureblood girl in the year below him, called Astoria Greengrass. Her family had a better social standing at the moment and they hoped she would be a good influence on Draco.
Within an hour the bath was run with a slow warming charm placed on it, as Harry struggled to finish his soup without looking green around the gills. Draco had insisted that he did not have to eat anymore if he did not want to, but Harry had persisted until only a small morsel was left. Draco had pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek before setting the tray onto the coffee table, and pulling Harry up to his feet. He wobbled a little unsteady at first, but a firm arm around his waist steadied him.
Besides, it had been a long time since any of them had done something devious for the sake of being juvenile. The war had made them grow up too quickly. It was time to grab their teen years back!
He snapped the water off and stepped out onto the linoleum floor, wrapped a towel around his waist and then towel-dried his blond hair before wrapping the towel about his shoulders. Upon stepping out of the bathroom he saw Harry almost completely dressed in a dark indigo shirt and dark blue jeans, polished black shoes rested at the foot of the bed as the bald man wrestled with a pair of socks. Draco smiled softly and walked to the wardrobe and opened the door, peering inside at its contents. He finally chose a pair of dark jeans that hugged his figure comfortably and a white collared shirt.
Hermione had told him an interesting little story along with teaching him to make the cranes; that if one made a thousand of said cranes then they would be grants one wish -for whatever they wanted.
Harry's eyes darted to the envelope as though it were a poisonous snake, "What's inside it?" he whispered through trembling lips, tears gleaming on his thick black eyelashes.
Harry took a step forward and Draco reached out to smooth his hands over the firm thighs, tracing the muscles with his palms. He shifted to the edge of the bed and pressed warm kisses down along the firm muscles. "Let me taste you, Harry," he growled low in his throat as he grazed his teeth along the snail trail running down between his lover's legs.
Harry felt flustered at the thought of wearing Draco's clothes, especially when he would never be able to afford something so finely cut even if he did manage to become a high ranking healer such as Snape. Draco beckoned him over as he moved towards the door, "Come on let's not waste time. If one of them fits you almost perfectly I'll have one of the maids shorten it and it'll be ready for tonight. You can keep it."
"That is awfully gracious of you, Lord Malfoy. I just don't understand where this generosity is coming from. You're known to most of France as being somewhat of a … a …" he trailed off not wanting to sound as though he were insulting the Lord.
It was such a young age and it struck Harry through his very core as he studied the blonde who looked like the picture of health. Okay, he did look a little on the skinny side, but perhaps he was merely lean. He looked like he could have muscles underneath those finely cut robes. He had some faint bags under his eyes that someone had tried to conceal with some finely tinted make-up and it had almost worked, but then Harry had studied bodies day-in and day-out for months on end. "Have you had a professional healer assigned to your case to take you in for assessments and making sure to document your progress with various potions?" he couldn't help but ask, feeling a little braver as he did so.
Could he live with a world without Draco? Did he want to live in a world without Draco? Or would it be better for him to live in a world where Draco wasn't even there, and then he wouldn't have nightmares about killing someone who was already dead of unfortunate circumstances. He'd be able to get some proper sleep! He wouldn't have anything to worry about. No more graveyard shifts at the hospital and he could go home at whatever time he wanted –to an empty house. Whatever brief flicker of bliss he may have felt was immediately drowned in the black lake in his head at the thought of waking up alone and falling asleep alone every night no matter what. He wouldn't have the miniscule relief of having the feeling of Draco's fingers slip between his own in the middle of the night when he was fast asleep –it had been like a phantom touch ghosting through into his sleeping mind and fighting the nightmare away. Even for a moment, but the relief washed through him like a warm wave.
This time is was Harry's turn to blush a little, "I wouldn't mind going on a date with you. Unless -" his eyes opened wider, "Oh ... It doesn't have to be a date if you don't want it to be."
"What happened?" Ginny asked from her seat opposite Harry. She had been trying to be discreet with her desire to talk to him but he really didn't need to have any conversations about the future. It was a sore subject for him and despite what she claimed; she really didn't understand why it made him feel physically sick to think of it.
"You must be young Mister Potter?" a petite maid curtsied to him and he felt a flush creep up his neck as his travelling cloak was taken from him by another maid. "Do come in. Lord Malfoy and young Master Malfoy are in the drawing room. If you would follow me, I'll take you to them."
He watched Malfoy lower his wand, visibly shaken by the random question, but he quickly adjusted himself and sneered, "Like you give a fuck, Potter!" he spat out.
Draco threw his head back and let out a strangled cry as Harry started to slowly move inside him, drawing up a rhythm that made him sweat out and clutch the bed sheets into a tangled mess until his knuckles were gleaming white. He panted erratically as he tried to cam his frantic heart but the adrenaline was rushing through him at such an alarming rate that he couldn't keep his moans from escaping and filling the air between them. Harry's grunts as he thrust inside him, deep and hot and tight, made his own erection ache as it bobbed on his stomach. He raised his legs until his toes were curled over the edge of the mattress and raised his hips in time to Harry's thrusting, and he cried out over and over until everything became lost in the translation of the heavy lust that gripped him. "Harry!" he gasped out through his strangled cries, as he pulled himself up to grip at Harry's sweating shoulders as he gripped Draco's legs and pounded into him.
It was when Hermione was on her third cup of coffee –he had not thought it was healthy but what did he know? He wasn't married to her –when her bright eyes lit up like two sparkling jewels. If Harry was broody then the next best thing to a baby was –
"Of course Harry. I plan on spending as many years with you as possible. Till death do us part, remember?" he grinned down as he landed on top of the brunette, the mattress springs groaning underneath their combined weight.
"Well if we're going to get technical about this sort of thing, I do own at least half of it, maybe even a little more," stated the other man as he ruffled his hair.
Wadding everything into a ball, he tossed it in the bin before snagging another load of tissue and heading back into the bedroom.
He placed his paper crane on the small pine cabinet beside the bed before easing himself into a chair and taking one of Harry's cold, limp hands in his own. The next twenty-four hours were crucial, the nurse had told him. Sink or Swim. Live or Die. Harry or no Harry. It all seemed too much to understand. He clutched Harry's hand tighter, willing him to wake up even for a few moments. He needed to see the pair of shining green eyes -they would reassure him that Harry was still fighting for life -for him.
“Tenéis hambre, claro,” interjected Elena firmly. “Traigo tortilla.” And she bustled out of the room.
Harry sat straight up in bed and immediately cried out in pain. Another voice cried out too, to his right.
“It’s not like we’re losing much, though, right?” Draco asked, almost desperately. “I mean, like you said, our marriage has been a sham from the beginning. It was never meant to bring peace, it was meant to make us both miserable. And that –” He shook his head. “Neither of us needs that. Right?”
He glanced around, but no one was even looking at him. Kingsley Shacklebolt was deep in conversation with several reporters. Draco caught the words “election” and “triumph.”
He stopped himself with a guilty shake of his head. He was tired – that’s why it had slipped out. He didn’t usually like to talk about what happened at work with Draco, because the other man usually got very tight-lipped and uncomfortable whenever the subject of dark magic or Death Eaters came up.
“Oh, please remind me,” Harry shot back. “Do you pour them in? Or just smash them on the floor? I’m afraid Dumbledore didn’t get a chance to show me before
“Malfoy, she’s not going to forget you,” Harry said firmly. “And you’re going to see her again soon.” July 13 was drawing ever closer, when Malfoy would likely either be returned to Azkaban or re-sentenced to exile. Harry found himself not really liking either option.
. Could they mean Malfoy? He pressed his ear even more firmly against the wooden door, but just then another crowd of people entered the hall, talking and laughing loudly, and the man’s response was lost in the noise. Harry cursed silently to himself and stepped back from the door. Just in time: it opened suddenly and a man exited, pulling on a jacket and heading towards the exit. A woman followed him more slowly. She seemed deep in thought as she closed and locked the door behind her with a delicate silver key. Then she moved farther into the Manor, fingering another key hanging on a chain around her neck.
Elena wiped her eyes and waved them off, having apparently accepted the story that Harry and Ron had arrived via bus from the closest town and were going to leave with Malfoy and Viola the same way. They walked for a little while, until the farmhouse had disappeared from view and they were along in the rolling grasslands. Then Harry held out the empty soda bottle that was their portkey.
Draco did so. The other man quickly cast a binding charm on his wrists. “Follow me,” he said, and swept out of the room. Draco followed.
He leaned back quickly as they approached Potter, who turned his smile on them with something like relief. Draco supposed that made sense: who wouldn’t prefer talking to their two best friends in the world instead of their former-enemy-turned-husband? Seeing the three of them with their heads bent together felt like stepping back in time, accompanied by the blisteringly familiar rush of scorn and envy.
“Harry Potter,” she breathed, her eyes barely focusing on Draco before returning to him. “It is an honor all unlooked-for to have you return to my shop. With what may I assist you? New dress robes, perhaps? Quidditch robes?"
“How does it feel, to be back in England?” Harry said finally, a little awkward as they walked down the stairs.
.” He made a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sob and shook his head. “I don’t know what any of this means.”
