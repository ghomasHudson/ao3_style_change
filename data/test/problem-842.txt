For a moment, Draco didn’t know what to do, but the idea of going back to his apartment, where he had quarreled with Potter and then spent the rest of the night with a tub of disinfecting wipes, was unacceptable. “I just want this job finished.”
“Uh, sure.” Harry stood back up and they both walked into the hall where Robards was walking.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, he-uh, during his first shift, he mauled his girlfriend. They were ex’s but recent, and he still thought they were going to get back together. It took him a long time to come to terms with that, and even after he still didn’t want to get close to non-Weres. Ajax was very pleased when Sawyer got his job at the restaurant, took everyone out to the club to celebrate and paid for all the drinks.” He crossed his arms.
“Merlin, I thought I was done with all that when I quit.”
Harry shook his head. “Kidnapped. He’s been shot.”
“Why are you here?” Potter asked in what Draco could only imagine was his Auror voice.
“I wanted to do something nice for you,” he tried explaining again, but Harry had trouble listening while looking at the mess. He held up a hand to silence Malfoy and breathed in, held it for several seconds and then breathed out.
“Oh, you know Emma.” Margie wiped her hands on a kitchen towel. “Tell me what’s new with you, darling.
Harry took two steps away to open the cupboard for a glass. Two steps too far. When he turned to face the sink, glass in his hand, he could see Draco, with a knife slicing into his left arm, blood dripping onto the floor. And he drew the knife up his arm again.
“Friends is not the word I would use,” Draco replied dryly and Harry laughed a little.
I want to work here!” Draco insisted hotly. “I want to work with muggles.”
Suddenly, for the first time, Harry wanted to tell someone, not just someone but her. He wanted to tell Hermione, and once he started the words just kept falling out of his mouth, one after the other in a torrential downpour that wouldn’t stop until it had run out. “Draco. I’ve been looking for him; it’s my case. It shouldn’t be, but it is, and I finally found him. He withdrew a huge sum from Gringotts. He was there and he had blue hair and he didn’t look like himself. And it wasn’t a glamour because you can’t have that in Gringotts anymore. How did he make his hair blue?”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. Yesterday had been awful, all those terrible knowing stares from all of those terrible knowing Aurors.
And Harry scooped him up in his arms. “Grace!” And it didn’t matter that Harry was in his boxers and Malfoy in those horrible joggers that were probably falling off again, Harry was running into the hall and pounding on Grace’s door. “Grace! Grace! Grace!”
Draco started to help her.
They pushed their way through the crowd to the Weasley’s where Hermione smiled at Molly, and Ron said something to Arthur, and Harry hoped they weren’t talking wedding plans already. He’d endured the long car ride to London full of speculation on venues. Luckily, the appearance of Jude was enough to forestall any potential wedding talk.
And then Malfoy was back in his ear.
“You’re home early!”
But still the scent lingered, and his chest ached, and Draco rested his head on the edge of the metal sink to cool his overheated skin. He breathed deep and tried to calm the torrent of emotions before he did something stupid. He thought of Teddy--of his hair changing from black to white to electric blue, and the anger ebbed away. And then Draco thought of Sawyer.
Draco growled a little. He could smell Teddy on the stairs. “I don’t think that is any of your business.” The little footsteps passed the parlour door; the little guy must be more interested in the smell of eggs then Hermione.
“He used to be worse, if you believe it,” Harry pointed out.
Draco ran the tap again, patted his face and neck with the towel and breathed in deep through his mouth.
“What?” Ginny, Hannah, and Neville turned to the door.
“Tell me, why don’t I just take you to a healer.” Harry replied.
“Just breathe, and look out at the crowd when you speak. Like we practiced.”
“Oh please, you think that line works on anyone? You’ve been so caught up in him forever. Maybe not so much lately, but if you’re lightning, he’s the tallest tree around, and that’s probably not ever going to change.”
“Alright everybody,” Robards shouted over the din. “It’s a warehouse stuffed full of merlin knows what, and we’re going in as teams of two. Potter, Simmons, Fredricks, and Weasley you’re the front line, stunning spells only. Simmons, try to avoid getting doused in something this time. Kenton and Smith, you are back up. Walker, Grey, and Cox are collecting evidence. I want this quick and clean, people.”
“Holy shit!” Neil shouted.
Harry noted the sarcasm and felt a little better. He really did not want a running dialog on his technique. But the crisp air wiped away those thoughts, and Harry felt his mood improve with the walk.
There was a coffee pot on the counter, half full of old coffee; Draco couldn’t look away from the thick liquid “I don’t want to be that person any more.”
Harry went into work in an excellent mood, only to have that crash down shortly after arriving.
Ron shrugged. “Mum was just worried when you didn’t show for dinner. I figured you got caught up in a case. Need some help?”
“Oh fuck,” Potter moaned.
Harry laid his head down on the table next to his lunch tray and barely heard the cacophony around him. Ron was saying something, but it was lunchtime so it was probably about the turkey and noodles or the cherry tart or...something. Maybe Harry could close his eyes for a minute?
“I don’t mind.”
“Of course.” Hermione nodded, thinking about what Harry said. “What time do you think? I will meet you in the Atrium.”
He looked at Harry just once with sadness or remorse or maybe it was regret, but Harry didn’t care because he was pretty sure he wasn’t ever going to breathe again. Not if Draco walked away. How was he supposed to keep going in this world?
Draco looked back down at the table, because currently that was true, but currently was not the same as always. “I’m not sleeping with him,” he repeated quieter, less certainly.
Harry wouldn’t wait days for that, not weeks or months. He would search for Draco for years, across the globe, to all the secret places, tear apart his past for hints of his future. He would tear down a thousand doors, destroy thousands of wards, fight as many fights as it took to hold Draco in his arms again. Let him push Harry away as many times as it took, as long as in the end, he still swayed back--as long as he let Harry catch him again.
“Is this a question thing or a tea thing?” Harry asked, shoving more eggs in his mouth.
“Hello,” a male sales clerk asked. “What can I help you find today?”
Ron shrugged. “Mum and Dad are coming from Shell Cottage with Fleur and Bill. I don’t know how they stand all her unannounced visits. Hermione better not get pregnant any time soon.”
“I’ll show you all my notes.” Harry led Ron down the hall to his desk where he had piled up all his notes. They sat down, and Harry took him through the entire investigation from the very beginning, starting with Draco’s arrival in his flat.
“Fine.” Harry got out his mobile, which he used almost exclusively for ordering takeaway, and found the number for the Chinese restaurant two blocks away. “I’d like two orders of beef lo mein, two orders of egg rolls, and an order of crab rangoons. Thank you.” When he hung up, he looked at Malfoy and said, “I hope you like noodles.”
Vale whined and practically vibrated before suddenly yanking Faye in close, mouth close to her ear, hands tight on her back. And slowly Faye brought her hands up around him. “It’s a necessary risk,” she said.
Malfoy shuffled forward, let go of the wound, and turned his arm over. He’d scored his arm lightly in a cross hatch pattern, just deep enough to bleed but not deep enough it would scar. “What happened?” He asked absently during his inspection.
Draco raised his gaze to Harry.
Astoria frowned, a small wrinkle creasing her forehead. “So you aren’t interested in politics.”
But Harry just pushed open the door and stared at the blood. It looked a bit like a murder scene actually, with dried blood all over the mirror that had dripped down onto the sink and all over the floor, including on Harry’s nice towels. He turned to Malfoy who had stopped rocking but was still crouched on the floor. “There is blood all over my bathroom.”
“What?” Harry shouted back.
“Jude suggested I talk to Draco about her.”
Ginny planned to come over for dinner in an hour, and Harry had just shoved things under his bed! He pushed it all a little farther underneath, and then went to the bathroom where the counter was smeared with toothpaste and soap scum. Dust coated the floor around the toilet, and--Harry just yanked the curtain to hide the shower that was probably last cleaned when Molly had been here.
“Harry?” Draco asked, his voice high and thin with fear.
Hermione nodded in a daze. “Yes, and Ron, I need Ron.”
Jude flicked another page in the magazine with a secret smile. “You gonna clean the bathroom?”
“Thanks anyway.” Harry cast a quick tempus. He needed to get back to the office and work on Malfoy’s case before Atkinson stopped by again.
“Jude,” he reminded himself outside the door. The girl, Sarah, had called him Jude.
Draco crossed the floor in long strides, took the spot next to Harry and undid his own trousers. Harry kept his gaze on Draco’s face, didn’t let it fall at all. “Well, maybe I’m just interested in debasing myself, seeing what all the fuss is about. Why don’t you tell your little friends that?”
Draco drew back as if he’d been slapped. His right hand traced the burn scar on his wrist. “You don’t know anything about it, and don’t think you do.”
“Have you heard anything around the office? Have people been saying things?” Harry demanded.
And Draco shoved a hand between them, tore at buttons and zips and shitty, stupid elastic until he could get a hand around the two of them together. “Fuck you, Potter.” He breathed at the first scrape of their cocks against each other.
“Well, thank you.” Harry paused, feeling a bit awkward. He and Sarah really didn’t have much in common, other than the mint chocolate chip.
“What kinds of coping techniques?”
“What the fuck! I am the one who said he was a Death Eater way before anyone else figured it out! I knew he was behind bad things at Hogwarts before anyone else. I know him better than anyone, and I am telling you he’s not a threat!”
Malfoy shrugged, and Harry took that as consent to the day’s activities. “You take care of the kitchen while I clean the bedroom,” he said because he didn’t want to have a debate about it.
Harry shook his head. “Teddy wants to have dinner, and then I’m on the night shift.”
A knock at the door interrupted the cycle, and Draco realized that his record had stopped playing. He let his hands linger over the turntable and thoughts of Grace to wash through his mind. She was almost as stabilizing as Harry and had promised to have dinner with him tonight, since Harry wouldn’t be able to make it.
“Where?” Sawyer asked.
“Hm,” Draco said in response, afterglow rapidly dwindling. “I know.”
The next morning, Tilly called him from the bar early in the morning. Not that Draco was sleeping, not after last night. “I wouldn’t have called if it weren’t--strange.”
Draco followed the waitress to the booth and slid in, only to have Harry slide in next to him. He glared at Harry as if it were some sort of surprise. Ron and Hermione had just walked through the door, so he turned towards them and hissed in Harry’s ear. “It’s a dangerous job. All I did was add some protections.” He scowled.
“What’s causing the delay?” Hermione asked a bit sharply.
He didn’t have his wand, couldn’t defend himself from Emma, couldn’t apparate away, he’d have to leave through the front door.
Malfoy threw away the last of the vegetables. “Thank you.” And then he stood awkwardly in the kitchen as if he didn’t know what else to do.
“It would, but a paste is significantly thicker than an oil and takes much longer to dry when applied. It runs the risk of degrading the technology.” Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath on the lift. “I know that you are highly intelligent, Granger. But I have spent years perfecting this method. It may seem overly complicated and tedious, but I promise there is reason to what appears to be madness,” he snarked.
“Get up, I need the loo.” Val gave him a soft shove, and Harry got out of the booth. She headed towards the back, and Harry went outside for a bit of fresh air.
Harry nodded, and then the movement unsettled his stomach and he shook his head. Robards uncrossed his arms. “Well, we cleared the house, got three including this one.”
Harry’s thumb was rubbing up and down subconsciously as he stared at Draco. “How do you know about panic attacks and how to calm down? How do you do it?”
“That’s why the rules about the number of Werewolves in one location are unacceptable,” Cade said. “Imagine if one Werewolf on his own was harassed by a group of wizards. Cornered and alone, he might feel the need to fight or that feeling of anger might linger into the full moon and he might become more volatile. In that situation, an Alpha can force the wolf to back down, and being in a Pack makes every wolf feel safer. No Pack follows that law.”
“Still.” Benson moved until it looked like he was laying on Harry’s desk.
“Well why the hell not?!”
And the weekends with Jude had been busy. He took Jude to the Burrow, and Ginny came over, and the bloke certainly knew his way around the household charms. He taught Harry how to flick his wand so that the mold would actually come out of the grout in the bathroom, and there was this flourish that would make the floors smell like lemon.
Together they stumbled towards the door, Draco chucking the wand away at the last minute. Outside, they ran, not bothering to look back to see if anyone gave chase. Another set of footsteps fell in step with Draco and Tilly, and the spell started to trickle off of them. They were blocks from the building now, close to a tube station. And Tilly pulled Draco down the steps, Evan just behind them.
“Who is?” Harry asked, because Atkinson had ruined his morning buzz.
“Your picture was in the paper.” Jude shrugged and sat down too. “Maybe she just recognized you.”
Both Harry and Draco presented their wands to her, and she inspected each of them before making several notations on a large ledger.
“I wish I knew what they were up to.” Harry scowled at the floo.
“It’s familiar,” Draco admitted, unable to say that he had heard something quite different, not quite as good, unable to confess that it made him miss his mother something fierce.
Harry stared, shocked. “You aren’t upset that I’ve been spending time with Draco Malfoy?”
He fussed underneath the kitchen counter, finding the cleaning supplies for the bathroom and laundry detergent for Malfoy to take down to the basement. Harry debated whether to find some old rags for cleaning or digging out his last roll of paper towels, and he surreptitiously watched Malfoy as he mumbled to himself. Harry didn’t catch very many of the words, and he wasn’t sure if Malfoy was just talking to himself or going round the bend again. Either way, it was aggravating. And eventually, Harry had to leave.
Except, it did quite remind Harry of
Harry patted his breast pocket, and nodded. “Yeah, let’s just hope it goes better than last time.” That disastrous afternoon outside of Fortescue’s. And then Harry remembered Draco had been there then, dressed and looking uncomfortable, holding out his hand for Harry to shake.
With one last look at the crates of crap, Draco nodded back at her, too tired to argue, and then took himself off to find a cab. The air was tangy with gasoline and salt, and Draco’s stomach unclenched enough for him to realize he’d skipped dinner. A bad habit from when he’d first been in America, when he’d still be consumed with nightmares and anxiety. But he didn’t want to eat, didn’t want to go back to his apartment and stare at the ceiling until light crept in through the window. So instead of giving the cab driver the address for his apartment, Draco asked for The Martini Bar.
In his worst case scenario, Harry showed up with a whole cohort of Aurors scaring patrons and arresting everyone. This wasn’t exactly that; Harry was alone and the bar had only just opened, but it was close enough that Draco’s heart raced at the sight of him.
“Yeah?” Harry asked, getting into the spirit of the moment. “And then what?”
Draco’s shoulders went up. “No. I won’t be able to read then.”
“Harry?”
“Oh shit, oh fuck!” Tilly fumbled for her own mobile, scrolling through to find Harry’s number. It rang and rang and rang until finally going to voicemail. And Tilly punched the button again.
Harry stood in line at a Starbucks in London and bemoaned his chances of making it up to the counter to place his order in the next ten minutes. Possibly in the next ten months. That woman had been standing there with her sullen teenage daughter who hadn’t looked up from her phone once for what surely must have been twenty minutes now. And while Harry couldn’t exactly hear what she was saying, it sounded like she didn’t understand what a grande macchiato was. There was a perfectly respectable tea shop across the way for those who didn’t speak fluent Starbucks!
Perhaps he didn’t need to go straight out and look for Draco, after all, he didn’t know where to start in the middle of the day. There was plenty of time to go back to Grimmauld Place, to take a nap, have a meal, take a shower. He’d go out later, when Malfoy would be out at all his usual haunts, terrorizing the local muggles and generally making a nuisance of himself. Harry would find him, put the fear of--of Harry in him, and then send him home to his mother like the petulant child he was.
“Why are you calling me at nine am on a Wednesday morning?”
No, I’d really like to speak with Draco now, though.HP
Until Draco got his hands up between them and shoved Harry back against the opposite wall. It wasn’t far, but it was far enough that he could breath, the two of them leaning against the walls and gasping for air.
Not even as a child.
But Harry took a pinch of powder and stepped into the fire. “The Leaky Cauldron.” And he was popping out into the grimy bar where Ginny was waiting.
“Oh, um, come in!” Hermione shouted from inside.
“I don’t think I’m equipped for this conversation.” Hermione sighed and sat down to lean against him fully.
It wasn’t a great place for conversation though, with the roaring of fans and the detailed commentary that blasted overhead, so Harry never did find out what Mrs. Weasley said. Instead, Harry lost himself in the game in a way he hadn’t been able to lose himself in anything lately. He watched the dazzling way Gwenog Jones launched the bludger down the pitch at unsuspecting Chasers and knocked the Quaffle from between their hands with pure awe. Neither Seeker was particularly adept, but Harry found it amusing to realize he had seen the snitch twice while they were circling a bit aimlessly above. He didn’t have to wonder if someone might be cheating or hexing players or wonder whether Dementors were about to storm the pitch.
Monday dawned bright and easy, and Draco felt light for the first time in what must surely have been months. In fact, he felt so light, he thought he might skip on his way to the cafe near the Ministry. He didn’t, but the important part was that he felt like it.
“Sorry, I got caught up in something at work,” Harry apologized.
“I don’t know. Do you think you are?”
Harry stood and looked the Alphas in the eye. He tried to acknowledge each one individually, to see their faces as they were. Faye was small but mighty, Vale tall and angry, Ajax strong and yet nervous. The older Alpha also looked nervous, and that was fine, that was why Harry was standing, to offer some sort of reassurance. “You have to turn him in. If you--” what would they do to the culprit? “If you try to take justice into your own hands then the Ministry will come down on you hard, they will increase their patrols and crack down on access to potion ingredients and--”
“What case?”
What is so bad about them? HP
“Alright.” Harry squeezed his hand, needing that reassurance. “Let’s do this.”
“Yes, well, the time difference and all that.”
“None of your fucking business.” Malfoy scowled and then hissed when Harry found the rib. “I told you, old Bitey Mcbite Face turned all kinds of people. Magical of course, muggles when he could, what difference was it if he bit the son of a disgraced Death Eater. Old Snake-Nose laughed when my father complained.”
“I like it,” Harry said, twitching his hips meaningfully.
“He is.” Hermione smiled. “He’s resilient, and clever, and stubborn, and brave. And he spent all of Hogwarts just trying not to die. He didn’t have a chance to find out what else he could be. He didn’t know that he could be playful or that he could have his own family or that he might want to do something other than fight. He’s been fighting his whole life.”
She typed out while not running to Jenkins office back in the bullpen.
“She’s a lovely young woman.” Narcissa prompted.
“So, what, you in the closet or something?”
“It’s called a drink bomb. You pack all the flavor or color into the powder, and then drop it into the alcohol.” His eyes were just a little too bright, and Jude looked at Tilly for some kind of clue.
She straightened and gave the Aurors a haughty look, haughtier then any Draco had ever managed, and some shifted uncomfortably under the weight of her gaze. “What? You all act as though you’ve never seen a muggle Were before.” She shook her head as if they were all merely silly school children being taken to task for not completing their homework.
Draco scoffed. “Of course you did, everyone in the wizarding world had a Harry obsession at one point or another. Most famously, your sister, but even Severus Snape was obsessed.” He said everything so matter of factly, and the vein on Ron’s forehead began to twitch just a little.
“Don’t let him ruin our evening,” she pleaded.
“Fuck.” Draco whispered to himself.
I'm including
“God, Robards! He’s coming back to my place. He’ll be here when I get here!” Harry shouted.
Robards sat heavily in his plush leather chair, hands on the arms and back painfully straight. In a weird way, he reminded Harry of Malfoy, except Malfoy did those things defensively while Robards did them to intimidate. “We’ve received the toxicology report.” He picked up the lone file on his desk and dropped it loudly in front of Harry. “As you suspected, Wolfsbane poisoning. But there’s no evidence of foul play. These kinds of accidents are the reason we require licenses for brewers.” He folded his hands in front and looked expectant.
And then it was time to go, and all four of them made their way to the floos, Hermione and Ron wished him a lovely evening with his mother, and Harry smiled something wicked that promised nothing but delight. Draco stepped in close, damned if anyone saw, and exhaled lightly in Harry’s ear, causing him to shiver. He reached out a hand, but Draco was already stepping into the floo and shouting Malfoy Manor into the flames.
“Then I want to sleep without that bloody potion.” Draco looked at the wall.
“Think it’s the decor?” Val tried to joke, but it fell flat.
And so Ajax had his own rules, rules about talking to Aurors or police officers, rules about scattering and meeting up later, rules about how often they could frequent establishments and in what kinds of groups.
And that was when there was a knock at the door.
“Good morning,” Harry puffed up his chest. “We are here today in part to honor the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to defeat Voldemort and also to celebrate the new found unity in our community.” His hands were sweating, and Harry rubbed them uselessly against his robes. “Seventeen years ago, my parents gave their lives in a valiant effort to destroy Voldemort, and I stand here today because of their sacrifice. I am honored to represent them and pleased to announce the reopening of Fortescue’s Ice Cream Shoppe. This place will be a meeting place for witches and wizards everywhere, a place for families and friends, a place of hope for the future.”
Draco leaned to the left to see Ron, his skin flushed but his voice calm. “Thank you, Ron. Come on, Harry. Lunch is ready.”
from his vocabulary, and there was the whole thing with Potter. And, okay, that wasn’t on Draco’s list, but it did seem to be--going well? An improvement in their relationship? Not really either of those things, but it was the only time Draco felt like he fit in his own skin, like he wasn’t trying to be something impossible.
“He lived in the department, on that shitty cot behind a containment field,” Harry pointed out, and Ron started to look uncomfortable. “I’m going to take him home.”
“There’s a back hall for this sort of thing, gentlemen. If you haven’t got someplace better to go,” the bartender interrupted them.
“It’s none of your business anyway.” Draco glared and began packing things up as a way to avoid looking at Harry.
Cade shrugged.
too much.
“I guess that makes you a good guy.”
He gathered his cloak from the back of the other chair, adjusted the silver clasp, very plain, and stepped into the fireplace to floo to the Atrium.
“You’re not.” She never stopped touching him, running her fingers over his hand this time.
“That’s actually why I’m here,” Harry said. “I was hoping to hear a little bit more about Marie. According to her roommate, yours was her favorite class.”
Draco looked at Tilly for help, but Tilly was doing that thing she did sometimes where she got really quiet and didn’t say anything and Draco suspected she had forgotten he was rich. That Emma had probably waxed on for some time about how stupidly wealthy the Malfoy’s were and how that made Draco some sort of horribly pretentious person who wasn’t fit to kiss Tilly’s feet. When Draco sometimes actually agreed with that sentiment, Tilly had smacked him upside the head and muttered grumpily that he didn’t steal blankets or sleep in the middle of the bed so it was fine.
Malfoy’s head jerked up. “Why can’t we floo?”
And suddenly Draco felt like he could breath, like his lungs worked the way lungs were supposed to and like air flowed the way air was supposed to
Harry traced them, first with fingers and then with his mouth, pausing to suck a hot mark over Draco’s heart. “I could live underneath these scars,” his words ghosted across a nipple, and Draco trembled again.
“But he wasn’t a monster to me, was he?” Draco spat back. “He gave me a home when I didn’t have one, he gave me food when I was hungry, gave me kindness and attention.” He smiled viciously. “Like you.”
“What do you need?” He asked, voice breathy, as if he had been the one screaming.
“So now what?” Potter asked, leaning his hands against the wall.
Grace looked over at Harry and then back at Draco. “Draco, I can put you in touch with some people at the hospital too. They have an inpatient program and an outpatient one. They’re both very good programs.”
Draco hadn’t, and he didn’t feel the need to say that.
“So what do we do next?” Harry asked.
“Wherever he lived while he was working at the Department.” Ron wasn’t shouting, but he wasn’t shouting in that way that said he really wanted to.
“I’m taking a break from those.” She got a water pitcher out of the refrigerator and began to fill them up. “Too much work.”
“Tilly’s sister’s a witch. And Evan saw Sarah doing magic before tonight.” Draco rubbed softly at his eyes, as if he could rub out the muzzy feeling. “Is that a no on the water?”
There wasn’t another chair. Hermione stood in the doorway, looked everyone over, nodding at the few she recognized, trying to smile at the others. They looked between her and Harry mostly with confusion, but one of them rolled his eyes and sighed loudly.
Harry bit his lip. “I just um, I have this new student living with me. Raylynn, and she’s--” He pointed at his eye.
Everyone turned to see Jessica, the newest receptionist, hired more for her availability to work nights than for her personality, lingering in the door. Personally, Harry was hoping she would develop some courage in the next few weeks, otherwise he was going to perpetually send Val to get his messages.
“I don’t know why I listen to you.” Harry gathered Malfoy against his chest.
He wasn’t going to follow Harry into the loo.
That night, as they were closing up, Evan asked, “Did you do something?”
“Malfoy.”
“What is wrong with you? Call her! She’s the only one who speaks fluent git.”
“Yeah,” Harry scraped his chair back. Why were chairs always that loud? And was everyone looking at him? Yes, everyone at the table had looked up. He gave them a tight smile. “Loo.” And then dashed madly from the table towards the nearest shadowy hall.
“I’m sure you will.” Draco drummed his fingers on the table. “It’s not complicated, but I imagine the translation may take some time. This would all be much easier if you simply believed me.”
She took another breath, and Harry broke in. “I don’t disagree, Hermione, but there is a huge amount that we don’t know. For example, did you know there are a number of Weres who are muggle, no magic at all. How do you integrate them? They can’t even come into the Ministry.”
He planted himself in front of Harry, intent on the dance, on the feel of the music pounding through him, on the endorphins and the feel of a partner who would be both a release and a challenge. They both knew they would end up in that hall, had known it since Harry had brought it up at work, but how they got there, that was the challenge. And Draco was feeling good and in no hurry. He ran his hands along Harry’s chest, across his shoulders, down along his stomach. He rolled his ass against Harry’s erection, squeezed and ground himself against Harry until they were both sweating and breathless and hard.
“I can’t ask them that.”
“What?” Draco accidentally overpoured the beer in his hands. He hated dumping the foam into the spill tray.
During the day, Harry could hear Malfoy pacing restlessly through the house when Teddy was occupied with a playdate at the park. He might have been able to walk through the house silently, but in those fits, his feet echoed as he traipsed up and down the stairs, trudged through the hall, and fussed about in the kitchen. It was a subdued version of what Teddy did, galloping between Harry and Andromeda as if he were a rubber ball they were tossing back and forth. It was hard to accept that Malfoy might know something about Teddy that Harry didn’t, and impossible to deny during those long hours when Teddy was gone.
Ginny shrugged and smiled and said, “It’s just like Gwenog is always telling us, you gotta pay attention and take the shot when you see the opportunity. I’m just glad I was quick enough to get it through the hoop in time.”
The article came out Saturday morning, the day of the big speech, the anniversary Harry had been trying so hard not to think about. He read it over breakfast at the kitchen table in Grimmauld Place. Front page, with two different pictures: the one of Harry holding the bag, of course, but there was also one of Harry leaning over the counter and pointing at a ring. And Harry had to wonder just who had taken that picture.
Instead of answering, Malfoy stumbled into Harry, one hand scraping harshly against Harry’s ear while mumbling, “We haven’t much time.” But Harry wasn’t sure if he was mumbling to himself or to Harry.
“You made it,” Hermione said.
She caught up with him outside the conference room, where the night shift was already gathering. “You are going to get sacked if you don’t watch yourself.”
“Well, I may have spilled some sauce on his shirt, accidentally of course, and then insisted I buy him a pint to make up for it.”
“Oh my god that’s even better.” He started to laugh again, not quite as uproariously, but still loudly.
Draco finally turned to watch her hands. “No one else seems to think I have or will or even can.”
Andromeda plopped back down, feet smacking against the tile. “I don’t understand what’s gotten into him. His teacher pulled me aside when I went to get him from school to tell me he’s been fighting with some of the other boys in class, always over the blocks. Teddy wasn’t even playing with them, and he still got so upset when Justin picked one up.”
It took twenty minutes to get the take-away, but Harry was glad of the extra time to enjoy being outside and alone. If he spent the entire day working cases, it would probably drive him insane. And despite Malfoy’s clear desire to help, he was almost as annoying as Atkinson.
“I’m sorry!” Harry shouted back, and Evan rolled his eyes and shook his head as Ron stepped up next to him.
Friday rolled around, and Harry was still wavering about bringing Malfoy to the pub. He dithered in front of the closet picking out a shirt while Malfoy washed the dishes from dinner. Eventually, Harry just grabbed the nearest clean shirt before going back out to the living room.
“He had no business getting involved in all of that. He should have called me,” Harry insisted, grumbling angrily
“I just hope Malfoy doesn’t show up this time.” Ginny said, her forehead wrinkled angrily.
Eventually, they had six perfectly round, little balls lined up in a row on a piece of parchment paper.
There was something very wrong with their relationship, Harry decided as he marched across the floor to the night wizard behind the counter at the Leaky. And that thing was going to end tonight, whether Draco liked it or not.
“Because I want more.” Harry’s voice got low. “I like how you challenge me. I like your devotion. I like the way you can make me laugh. And the way, sometimes, I can make you too.” He shut the door and crowded close to Draco on his stool. “I like the way your hair is long and the buttoned up way you dress. I like your earrings and the way you just exude sex. I want you to push me back, like you do at the club. I want you to remind me of humanity and goodness like you did at the park. I want you.” He whispered the last three words like a promise against Malfoy’s skin.
Parkinson collapsed against her door. “I told you he isn’t here.”
Draco opened his eyes and pushed back from the table. “Thank you, Mimsy.”
“Hm,” Harry ran his fingers through the condensation on his own beer. “I can’t pin down Jude to find a time to do it. He’s always working. I saw him for about two minutes the week before last and he just said he had to dash off to work. He’s working two jobs now.”
And Harry played with the condensation on his pint glass and didn’t ask if Draco ever thought about them, if he ever had regrets. If things were different now.
But it was all wrong. The words were right, but the tone was too soft, too quiet--as if Harry were telling himself instead of Draco. He should yell those words, shove at Draco, throw things or swing a punch. He was supposed to get physical and angry, not be this sad, mellow man who couldn’t stop thinking about a warm, yellow kitchen.
Draco paused, one arm still in the sleeve and in the process of pulling the shirt on. “I suppose.” It was hard to say that he lived here, hard to admit that truth.
“Huh?” Draco stared up at her, not quite able to understand.
Draco sucked in a deep breath through his open mouth. “Nothing, nothing’s going on with me.”
Which of course was exactly what happened. Harry coughed loudly and waved his hand in front of his face to try and clear the smoke and dust.
That seemed to appease her, because then she broke into a tentative smile. “How’s work going? Crack open any exciting cases?”
Harry sighed. “It’s complicated. He’s not living with me, not exactly. It’s more about Teddy.”
Harry started with the most recent and went through every single missing child up to the date of the Battle. He looked for the dates of the correct moon, for the right age, for suspicious people who matched Fenrir Greyback’s description. And in the end, he had a tidy pile of half a dozen children, four were female.
Several members of the Wizengamot had the decency to look ashamed. Eamonn Williams stood up. “While it is regrettable that you are unable to comply with the letter of the law, we must think of the good of all our citizens, not just the few you represent. The safety of our children--”
understands how I feel.”
“He works hard, he’s a good employee. I’m not firing him.”
“Coitus interruptus, Potter. The least you can do is get me drunk.”
“‘Course.” Draco looked up from his phone. “You’re part of the family, you know.”
“It’ll be a big scandal,” Harry pointed out.
“What the fuck!” Ginny Weasley startled off the sofa and onto the floor, flailing into Granger as she did so and waking her up.
And Draco let her ease an arm underneath him to lever him up to sitting. She slipped the shirt from his shoulders, and the scar on his hip was all the more visible. Her fingers traced along it, but she didn’t say anything, instead carefully wrapped the bandage around his ribs, tight but not too tight.
“Yeah, but you’ll have to play with Gwenog Jones, and she’s a bit of a nightmare, isn’t she?”
Malfoy straightened and gave Harry a confused look. “I’m studying to retake my NEWTS.”
Harry was getting a little breathless himself remembering when Draco did that to him. “Thought you were the one fucking him?”
Draco turned and walked slowly back over to his table with Parkinson leaving Harry alone with Ron.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat, “Shall we get started?” and they were suddenly all business.
“No,” Tilly said softly. “But you can make sure to live a life that’s better.”
And Draco was staring at him in a strange mix of terror and fascination. “How did I know I liked blokes?”
“In that bathroom, you did this.” Draco touched his chest. “But I tried to do much worse. And I could have tonight. I could have and you couldn’t have stopped me. You wouldn’t have.” Draco reached back to Harry. “I know a place. I’ll be safe there. I’ll be better.” He was soft, like in the morning, with gentle hands on Harry, a soft caress, loose limbed and easy kisses.
He wanted to feel angry, but all he felt was lonely.
“My son is dying.” The color was slowly leaching from his face.
So Chris counted out the notes while Draco finished the last of the dishes and mopped up the floor. Tilly steered Sophie into the back room, and didn’t emerge until after everything had been finished for the night. Chris left with a shrug and a wave at Draco, who sat himself down on a stool and waited.
Draco suddenly jumped off the stool. “Fuck!” He cried kicking it over. It thudded against the cauldron, tipping it over and spilling the sticky potion. He wrenched around looking for something else to throw, and that was when Harry saw it, a dark stain on the lower left of Draco’s back.
Draco slipped from his chair to his knees in front of her. “It’s not you. Believe me, it’s not you. I-I don’t do well in magical spaces. I panic, I get very upset.” He paused to remember so, so many bars. “I make some really bad choices, and unless I am going to Gringotts for something, I don’t.”
Harry scowled, back to the cold shower feeling. “I know; I’m just not sure why.”
“Oh,” Harry leaned closer.
And slowly, Harry inhaled big gulps of air, to calm the sobs that wrecked his body, to ease the pain in his chest. “Sweet Merlin.” Because now that he could breathe, he could recognize that it had been a dream, it hadn’t felt like the dreams he used to have about Voldemort, it didn’t feel real. Slowly, Merlin, he was doing everything so slowly, Harry pulled back, not far, just enough to see Draco’s face.
“Thanks,” he grumbled gratefully.
Harry looked at Malfoy silently daring him to do or say something. But Malfoy kept his gaze fixed firmly on Hermione’s desk and said nothing. With nothing else to do, and only a growing sense of danger, Harry turned back to Hermione. “Want to grab lunch later?”
She took the day off, and against all odds Draco got it off too. He had plans with Neil for later in the evening, because it was a day that ended in Y and Draco ended most of his days--or started them--with Neil. But it was afternoon still, and Tilly was stress eating her way through a bag of crisps.
Harry straightened up too, “Alright. In an hour then.” He jerked his head at Val and they both left.
“Weasley,” Draco drawled
“Just, you’ve always been so concerned with family, and I thought maybe that was the reason you were going to ask, because your family wanted you to.”
They stayed in that domestic scene until Andromeda called them for dinner. It was good timing because Teddy was starting to fidget, kicking his feet into both Harry and Malfoy’s shins. He climbed off the sofa, rolled on the floor until he smacked into the wall, and then launched himself at Harry, crying loudly into his shoulder. Malfoy rubbed his bare shoulder from where Teddy had accidently kicked him, his other arm wrapped tightly around his waist.
The Dreamless Sleep wasn’t perfect, it would suppress the dreams for a few days. But, in Draco’s experience, after about ten doses, he’d wake feeling hungover with a fuzzy head and a migraine, and after fifteen, the dreams would be there in full force with the headaches. He’d stopped fighting them a long time ago, and even missed them when he went a few days without seeing Harry.
But the loo wasn’t empty; Potter stood in front of a sink, water running untouched down the drain, knuckles white on the edge of the porcelain, eyes wide but pupils tiny.
“Thank you,” she said politely and then stepped into the room. “Would you like me to shut the door?” And then, when Draco failed to suck in another breath, “I can leave it open too. That’s perfectly fine.”
So, 4:45, Harry cast a discreet disillusionment charm, and went down to Records. Jude hunched at his station, back tilted defensively towards his coworkers, but as 5 o’clock hit, those shoulders went down, and he gathered himself up a little. Wherever he was going, it was something he was looking forward to, Harry realized.
And Harry smiled a little as they climbed into the carriage. “I meant, just in the place, not at the table with you. I won’t talk to him or anything.”
“Yeah, I better get to work. I’ve got to fix the bathrooms--the plumbing has gone all wonky.”
“May I?” He held out his hand.
Sarah did look up at that, stunned and uncertain.
“Yeah,” Jude agreed, small smile on his face. “Let’s celebrate.”
“Friend, Harry! Sawyer was my friend. We were-it wasn’t like that with us. Mating, like a one and only, that’s not a thing!”
All four of them took the tube to the Leaky Cauldron. They walked right past it, only Draco noticing the grubby windows and sign, and down to a corner pub with deep fried cheeseburgers because Sophie was hungry. Draco left them in the middle of a conversation about how many calories Sophie ought to consume versus the idea that she was eating for two.
Hermione snapped the menu shut. “Well then, let’s start with that.” She knocked briskly on the counter, and Sophie stepped over. “Three Fire Whiskeys please.” She smiled brightly.
“Mama will get mad at you.” Teddy pushed fists onto his hips and scowled in a terrible impersonation of Andromeda. Harry and Draco laughed again. “She hates trouble.”
In the middle of the conversation, Draco dropped his hands to his lap, and Tilly reached over to put hers on top. “Mother,” he said, eyes fixed firmly on his now cold cup of tea. “I am very sorry to hear about Greg.”
“What happened?” Harry asked as they arrived at the Ministry.
Oh Merlin, Harry couldn’t have this conversation. He turned to the sales clerk. “Excuse me, we have a question.”
He shifted to sit up in the bed, the door was open, and bright light streamed in through the window. They must have both fallen asleep unexpectedly, to not have closed the curtains or the door, and Draco had slept through his morning shift. That knowledge dawned on him slowly, and Draco looked down at where Harry lay still sleeping, breathing in gentle huffs against the pillow.
The sunlight streamed into the Main Lobby, making the whole place seem warm and bright despite the hard, cold marble and winter winds that blustered in when a patron opened the doors. Three older witches arrived in the first hour of memories, dowdy and overly dressed, withdrawing sickles and knuts from their vaults for young grandchildren.
“Oh?” Her eyebrows fell. “Maybe he decided to take some time off. I told him yesterday he has a lot of vacation saved up.”
“I found the mobile!” Ron shouted from the hall, and then, “Woah, what happened?” from the doorway.
“Bedroom?” Malfoy whispered against his lips, and Harry nodded wordlessly.
“Yeah, no shit. And your ex is in the hallway.”
Draco wouldn’t answer if he was in the shower, Roxi told herself firmly. “Hey Draco, Potter called, just wanted to know if you were still pissed at him.” She hesitated a moment, and then hung up.
“Yeah, well, even if I tell you who’s in the Pack, they won’t talk to you. Not much fond of Aurors or wizards.”
Draco scowled. “I certainly didn’t come here to think about my lab, Potter. Try something else.”
He left his present on a table decorated with a small tree and went to find a place to sit. Pansy waved at him from her table with Blaise. “You didn’t find him?” she asked sadly when Harry sat down.
Draco had lunch with his mother somewhat regularly now, usually with one of his friends and always somewhere Muggle, and always with an exit plan. At first, it was almost impossibly stressful, the conversation almost always light and inconsequential, as if they were both afraid to talk about something more complicated. But sometimes, sometimes it drifted to the more important.
Roxi sucked in a breath, held it, and then said, “I think he was kidnapped.” Which was utterly ridiculous when said out loud.
“He’s coming for me!” she shouted now. “He’s never going to let me go!”
He rested his head on Malfoy’s shoulder. “I want to fuck you.” Harry’s hands slipped into the back of the joggers, on to all that smooth skin, pulling Malfoy roughly to him. He kissed him again, just as rough and messy, lips not slotted together but mashed and desperate. Malfoy clung to Harry’s shirt, chest heaving, moaning and rocking and unable to stop.
Draco sighed up at the clouds, finger pulling at the tear in his pocket. “It’s like this right, we can smell it on someone, like pheromones or something, a compatibility or a-an awareness. And you can sorta reach out and accept it, or reject it.” Draco looked down and scuffed his trainer along the pavement. “He didn’t know he was doing it, when you called me family. And I--god, I couldn’t reject a little boy, not when he wouldn’t understand. It’s-it’s awful, to be rejected like that.”
“Are you coming to Sunday dinner?” Ginny asked. “You know Mum wouldn’t mind if you brought him.”
Mr. Green shook his head. “No, enjoyed his job, loved living with his mates. He’s been so happy since he moved to London, happier even then before his accident.”
“It itches like mad, and you feel wrong in your own skin, and there’s this nearly overwhelming need to run, but I won’t shift.”
They pulled answers from him like teeth from gums until the words bleed out of him freely. Draco spoke of Sawyer, by name, and of Sawyer’s strangely divided Pack. How he began brewing first for the pack, and then others because it was a sign of respect. He explained that Sawyer had gone missing, his murder, and how he, Draco, became Packless. How he became involved in the investigation by Harry Potter, about his own kidnapping, and that the Packs had come en masse to his aide. Draco offered up his own memory of the event as testimony.
Roxi sighed to herself. “And it was too much to ask for you to let us know before yesterday, so we could have searched them when they arrived.” She scowled.
Weasley stepped out into the hall with significantly less noise than the two of them had made upon entering. “Is the door charmed that way, or are you just a loud person?”
“Take me to bed?” Malfoy suggested optimistically.
“How much do I owe you?” He reached into his pocket for a handful of money and pulled out several Galleons. He must have spent the last of his pounds at the bar two nights ago.
“So this potion--” Harry looked over a Teddy who was busy shoveling food into his mouth as fast as he possibly could and decided it was better not to finish that sentence
“No.” Harry took another deep breath. He closed his eyes for a moment and thought about the Wright Brothers, standing on the beach--the precipice of their dreams, how thrilled they must have been as the aeroplane left the ground--how frightened. What must have people said to them when they announced they were going to build a flying contraption. “People who are struggling after the war. Students like Jude and Sarah.”
They walked in angry silence. Harry punched the button, and Draco got in alone. Anger still running high, Harry went back to Hermione’s office. He sat down at her desk, head in his hands and breathing ragged. There, he spotted a note in the corner, pressed flat.
“It’s so much quieter than the last one,” the woman said.
“You are injured. At least let me bandage up your arms.”
And besides, Harry could always find him. It was just going to take a few more days before Draco showed up at the Stubborn Goat. That’s all, just a few more days.
He shrugged and didn’t look at Harry when he said, “I’ve stayed in a lot of places.”
Roxi licked her lips. “Is Draco there?”
Ajax stepped forward out of the shadows. “We have rules, Draco. You broke them, a lot of them.” The others stepped out, putting sight to what had only been scent. “You put us at risk.”
Harry nodded. He hadn’t been across the ocean, but he had traveled to France, Germany, and Spain for several cases. Siestas and food and attitude, they were different in different places. “Sometimes I forget all of that wasn’t an international threat. I mean, it was such a huge deal here, a war and everything. But it didn’t even cross the channel.”
“Bitch.” Sarah scowled, and then brightened visibly. “I think you’ll quite like the Hogwarts Portrait Gallery.” She wiped her hands on her jeans and then bent to pull the canvas from the frame. “I’ve been told there’s students of all kinds there.”
But when Harry didn’t let go, they both turned to look at him, and several things flickered across Draco’s face. The only thing that was important in that moment to Harry was that Draco dropped his hand from the strange bloke’s neck and arse. Harry’s stomach moved up somewhere around his knees.
She got quiet again. “I talked to somebody, and it helped. Maybe there’s someone you can talk to? Someone who can help you deal with all that?”
“I will stay too,” Alice said loudly.
The first time Longbottom showed up at the Port, on a busy Friday, Draco didn’t say anything to anyone. Longbottom never approached him, just sat at his table, nursing his beer and keeping a clear line of sight on the bartop. Draco tried not to let his nerves show, but his hands shook when he took his own dinner break in the office.
Malfoy let out a low moan and scrambled to get a hand between them, nails scratching uselessly against Harry’s button as Harry yanked Malfoy’s shirt down to suck a dark mark above his collar bone. His nails bit into Harry’s waist as Malfoy tried to find anything to hold on to. Harry shoved his knee up against his cock and they both moaned and thrust up against each other.
Just before he thought he would scream, he yanked his arm back, cried, “Aguamenti!” and shot streams of water across his arms and the burning box to put out the flames. It hissed, and he could see little bubbles on his arm. As Draco inspected the wound, the huge, red, disgusting burn that stretched from his wrist to just below his elbow, smooth skin began to emerge from the center followed by the thick dark lines of the Mark. Now, it was an oval of pristine skin with that-that horrid thing surrounded by an angry wound.
“Ah, it’s nothing.” Because this was supposed to be figuring out what was going on with Ginny, not Draco. “What have you been up to since the party?” They moved leisurely through the crowd towards Flourish and Blotts.
Roxi stood outside of Draco’s lab again; she could not shake the feeling that something was terribly, terribly wrong. He had not been at her mothers, none of her sisters had heard from him (not that there was a reason they would have, but sometimes they texted), he was not at the Martini Club or that shady club down the street he liked. Roxi could not find him anywhere.
“He can try,” Harry bit out.
“She’s spending the night.” Oh, fuck, she was spending the night; he had to do something about the shower!
The door opened, and from the corner of his eye Harry could see bright blond. Hermione inhaled loudly and Ron let out a muttered, “Shit.”
“What?!” Weasley shouted, snatching the paper from Draco. Only the Will and Testament remained. “He’s not dead. This isn’t valid.”
Narcissa smiled at her reflection again. “Not yet, but I’ve been writing a letter. And I thought--well, I thought if I could tell her about your Lila, that perhaps she might-might have tea with me. Like you do.”
“What can I get for you, mate?” The bartender asked, and it wasn’t the tetchy one who always gave Harry dirty looks as he dragged Malfoy off to the loo.
"You're a life saver!" Harry shouted back, leaving Jude to scowl at the half cleaned space.
Draco smiled, soft and sincere. “It’s a place to go when you're caught up in something too big and too much, a safe place. It’s what we named the bar, A Port in the Storm. You should come inside, get out of the rain.”
Draco turned back to the yard. Teddy was rolling through the grass now, rubbing dirt into his clothes and waving his arms and legs in the air. “He is. He’s just a Were too.”
do it, we did it without stopping for a whole year. It wasn’t even five minutes after you found me that you had me pressed up against the wall. We did it Friday. We’re not going to stop, Harry. We’re never going to stop.”
Robards nodded absently. “After she’s done here, have her stop by my office and I’ll collect her statement then.” he stepped over to the doorway, and then looked back at Harry who was setting the tea down on a table and pulling a chair closer to the bed. “I’ll expect your report by tomorrow morning.”
What is Thanksgiving? HP
“Why not? If it’s true.” Harry kept his eyes trained on Draco.
Which was how Harry found himself dithering at the Burrow, trying to find any excuse to put off the inevitable. “Let me do those for you.” Harry snatched the roasting pan from the table before Mrs. Weasley could.
Draco smiled at her then. He’d never liked her, never wanted to spend much time around her in the flat, and Sawyer had been a little afraid of her in a way he wasn’t afraid of Ajax. So yeah, he’d never liked her, there was too much of Pansy in her smile. Florence fluffed up her hair, gave him a saucy wink, and disappeared inside.
“Of course, I’ll be right over here if you need me.”
“Good,” Draco smiled at her, and then turned back to his bank statements. He picked up the paper on top to help with concentration, but Sarah still sat in the chair with her knee up. And Draco had to turn back to her. “Is there something else?”
He jerked at the sound of his name. “I thought you were dead.”
He read through the transcript from his trial, skipping over his own words, the evidence, the details of the vanishing cabinet, the invasion of Hogwarts, a thorough recounting of all of his misdeeds under the Carrows. It didn’t paint a pretty picture.
Draco laid back down on the bench and closed his eyes.
Teddy climbed up on the bed next to Draco and shoved the book in his lap. “Can’t we read later, after my party?”
Because there was no doubt in Draco’s mind that Harry would be back.
He cast a quick glance over at Val. He trusted her to have his back, but did he trust her not to go running to a supervisor? Would it be better to do this on his own? That had consequences for court, no corroborating witnesses, and Harry looked around the room. If it was an Auror who was involved, then it would be important to have an iron clad case. He chewed on his bottom lip for a minute, debating.
“Thanks.” Harry signed the evidence release form and hefted the tote underneath his arm. It was heavy with more than just the weight of the fur, and Harry briefly considered carefully rearranging them before taking the container into the interrogation room.
“Yeah,” Draco smiled blissfully at Tilly and Evan at the other end of the bar. “I think it’ll last.”
He was standing in the receiving line, shaking hands and smiling when Draco and Astoria arrived at the apparation point. And chills ran down Harry’s spine. Draco looked fit in his formal dress robes, with his short hair neatly combed. He looked very professional, and Harry thought he might be sick. His stomach clenched and he sucked in a gasp of air.
“Excuse me,” Vale stepped up next to her, tucking Faye in underneath his shoulder and placing a hand on her stomach. “You’ll have to forgive her,” He said, all apologies and cheer. “She’s in a bit of a delicate situation and so forgetful with it.” He passed over his own wand. “I do hope this will do.”
Ron rubbed his thumb against her hand. “It wasn’t easy for us.”
No one else seemed to have this problem.
“Do you expect it to?”
“No don’t!” Malfoy cried out. “I didn’t-I don’t-I-”
Dean sighed, “Threatening me is not going to work. Either, you are innocent and have had no contact with anyone on this side of the channel in over a decade, or you're guilty and can know all kinds of secrets.”
“They have the same food on them.” Ginny pointed out.
“She’s one of his pack? That’s brilliant. You’ll be able to bring in the whole pack in one fell swoop.” Ginny grinned at him
“You’ve changed,” Faye said, “since leaving Ajax.”
“Good. You’ll be receiving the standard 3% raise, and we will meet again next month to discuss your progress with communication. That’s all.”
He couldn’t see Narcissa nod, but she did so anyway. “We went to a Winter Ball over the Holidays from Hogwarts. I wore an ice blue dress decorated with snowflakes, and your father humored me in matching robes.”
“Well,” Florence smiled. She was never happier than when seeing some uncomfortable drama unfold. “That was entertaining, I am so glad I came.” She stood. “Draco, I’ll be in touch about the potion. Are you still staying at that dingy flat?”
“No,” Harry sighed.
He stopped halfway through the Atrium and gave himself one minute, one minute to think about what it would be like if Harry and he could live in the same world. Harry sitting at the counter, laughing, dinner with Jude and Sarah at Grimmauld Place. Maybe Harry would introduce Draco to his cousin, Teddy. Maybe he could meet his Aunt for the first time.
Yes. I’m at Roxi’s. Her sisters are horrendous. DM
But the Parkinson's sighed and took his pathetic excuse as apology enough. “Well, yes,” Priscilla agreed, “but nothing is too much for my darling.”
“Alright everyone!” Robards called quietly. “We go in quick and careful. I don’t want any heroics today, we don’t know what’s in there waiting for us. Could be Greyback, could be his minions, could be nothing at all. No risky behavior, do you hear me Potter?” He stared his point into Harry who had not taken any such risks since the war--mostly because Savage held him back literally by the collar.
“You were never really one of us.” Ajax let him step away because the rest of them had circled around. There was nowhere for Draco to run.
Surprisingly, Harry did stop talking, and Draco spent the rest of the journey repeating to himself, I am not going to let him upset me, and I am not going to let him manipulate me into doing something I don’t want.
“Oh,” Harry started, uncertain how to explain about Jude, when Jude appeared in the aisle.
It was exceedingly awkward when Potter didn’t retaliate, and Draco realized he’d overreacted. “Why are you here?” he asked rather than apologize for his behavior.
Harry tapped his finger against his lip. It would be much harder to investigate Malfoy outside of Hogwarts; he’d have to be much sneakier. And he’d actually have to follow him around which would complicate things, what with work and Ron already knowing what Harry was going to do.
Harry’s cheeks were starting to hurt from all the smiling. “I sincerely wish I could.”
Dean didn’t ask about the nightmares. He could have, and Draco would have answered to the best of his ability, but he didn’t. After a moment, Dean said, “So, what made you write down the first dream?”
Until Harry stopped too. “What?”
But Harry snatched his wrist before he could actually make an escape. “Wait. We haven’t been able to identify the victim.”
She let Evan in and they both walked over to the kitchen--it had become the default place to talk in the week Draco had taken to living on the sofa. “Neil’s an asshole.” Evan shook his head.
Downstairs, Jude lingered by the door with his shoes already on. He pulled on his sleeve, too long this time but at least not threadworm.
“I’m afraid you misunderstood me, Head Auror Robards. I am aware that technically I have no legal claim over Sarah either, but I am going into that room, and I am going to speak with her. You can either assist me with this, or I can inform Harry that you are not cooperating and we can all see just what Harry does with all that righteous anger. I’m guessing it won’t end well for you or your Aurors.”
“Mostly. It’ll die down a bit once they all get a chance to meet you, or if one of the kids gets hurt. They’re just excited to think I met someone is all.” Harry cringed, he’d wanted to say he’d just met someone, but it was Malfoy. Even if Harry was thinking of him as Draco now.
Ron looked up at the ceiling and took a deep breath. “He’s still an arse. A pointy-faced, ferrety arse, who apparently gives a shit in the most underhanded way.”
“Did he tell you he was lonely?”
For a moment Roxi just blinked at him. “Who, exactly, do you think the French sent?”
“What is that smell?” She demanded.
Eventually Harry decided to go over to Grimmauld Place just to get away from the flat. The place had fallen into disrepair since he’d moved out, and Harry rather thought it would make for a good challenge. The hard work also helped him fall asleep at night instead of laying on his back listening for sounds in the other room. He started in the parlour, with the tapestry, because it seemed like the right place to start.
“What does this have to do with Draco?”
“You’re different,” he said, quiet and slightly awed.
“Yes,” Harry said, trying not to grit his teeth. “I heard it was good.”
He blinked rapidly to clear his vision, and yes, right there was a small group of reporters holding their quick quotes quills and looking eager. “What?” Harry said stupidly.
“Okay, okay, just calm down. I’m coming there. I need--I need to call Hermione and send her over to check on Tilly. Fuck, where does Tilly live?”
He was halfway between the bar and the dance floor when Harry saw him, Draco Malfoy. There was no mistaking the bright blond hair no matter the location or level of lighting. With his thigh thrust up between the legs of another bloke, head thrown back, and writhing. He had a plastic cup of something clear in his hand which was draped possessively over the bloke’s shoulder, but his head was thrown back and his eyes closed. And for a moment, Harry completely forgot what he was doing. Malfoy looked so free, so different from the boy he remembered. He was pale but not sullen, he was slender but fit, he had hard lines and was so tall, he wasn’t anything like the boy at school.
Harry stood up. “Thank you for answering our questions. We will be sure to let you know about any updates, and I am very sorry for your loss.”
“Each contains one hour’s worth of memories of the Main Lobby.” Mr. Drex swirled his finger and thirty vials rose neatly into the air. “These are the memories from the day of that transaction. We shall provide a pensieve for viewing as well.”
“It’ll grow, Potter,” he admonished, but only a little.
“Wow,” Neville peered at Harry. “You’re really upset he hasn’t responded.”
“The whole world is not going to see your secrets, Malfoy.” Dean sighed. “And to be honest, I doubt your secrets are all that interesting.” Draco didn’t say anything because he had spent a lot of time working on his anger issues and wasn’t at the point yet where he would spill secrets regardless of damage. Yet. Dean saw the set of his jaw though and relented. “Grant me permission, and I will change the wards for you.”
Meanwhile, Draco was making the rounds with Astoria. Having left England right after the trials, he did not know most of the people in the room. Although Astoria seemed to know everyone. She’d introduced him to at least twenty people, and so far, the only person Draco had been acquainted with was Blaise.
“Call it my good deed of the day or whatever.” She shrugged again and then crossed her arms.
“How?” Faye asked.
“No boyfriend no girlfriend?”
Draco flashed Harry a quick smile and steered Jude to the other side of the store, to look at shirts and trousers leaving Harry to deal with Madam Malkin. “He needs some robes, for Hogwarts.”
Apparently that question actually required an answer because he finally stopped talking and fixed his gaze on Tilly. “Trout’s good.” Tilly smiled back.
“Yes, but you are usually in Wizarding London. There isn’t really a Wizarding New York. Wands make it much harder to keep things secret. On the other hand, potions can be disguised in a coffee cup or a bottle of aspirin, much less conspicuous.”
For his part, Draco wasn’t at all sure what he was doing. Granger had turned up at his door babbling about lunch and Rose and how nice it had been at the park. And she was asking all kinds of one word questions about Astoria and his work and Rose and lunch. Somewhere in the middle of all of that he had suggested the Thai restaurant and she had issued some sort of invitation that he hadn’t fully understood until after he’d already agreed.
He reached out and touched Mrs. Weasley’s arm. “Shall we go to the Sleeping Noggin for a bite?”
Draco nodded minutely at him in the mirror. “10 o’clock.”
Harry didn’t move, his body frozen in indecision and his mind whirling. Would they all know when Malfoy looked over? Would Malfoy come over to the table and say something or would he see them, know Harry wasn’t available, and leave? Did Harry want him to leave?
“Yeah,” Harry exhaled. “Yeah, the baby’s okay.”
Hermione said something about his eye, but Harry brushed off her attempts to heal it, and Ginny pressed up against his side. And Harry could feel the warmth of her, the press of her breast against his side, her arm around his waist along with the ache in his face and his hand and his foot. He felt warm and alive.
“Probably.” Sophie shrugged. “I think he’s allergic to smiling.”
He jerked his head towards the front window, and the sign, The Port in the Storm. “I like the name.”
“I don’t like that story very much,” Teddy said emphatically. “It’s sad.”
They all paused as the food was set down on the table. Malfoy didn’t waste a moment as Harry’s plate was set down, he reached out and snatched a triangle of toast, cramming it into his mouth and getting crumbs all over his face.
What would the room look like when the Weasleyette spent the night?
“I think it was noble as anything the way you spoke up for him, but he was awful.” She continued and Harry tried very hard not to hear. “He owned those halls and made our lives miserable. I used to run the other way when I saw him, and I had to step in a few times before he hexed some first years.
He looked over at the bed, at where her hair spilled over the pillow in blood red waves. Where Harry should be sleeping happily. He took a reassuring breath, and then went back to bed, curled on his side so that he could look at her. At the soft curve of her face and the paleness of her skin. Harry had always liked her skin, pale with bright flecks of color across her shoulders and cheeks. He liked the contrast, the way it was so starkly different but fit together so perfectly. It was probably his favorite thing about Ginny.
“Yeah.” Draco looked at Tilly, wiped his hands on a dishtowel, and then steered Harry back to the office he’d cleaned in a desperate fit earlier. He shut the door.
“Are you ready, Malfoy?”
“Oh, you got me, have you?” He snarled softly so that just Harry could hear.
Potter mirrored him, shouting, “Malfoy!”
Draco couldn’t hear the other person, but he had a sudden flash to last night and had his suspicions.
And then Draco said, “You should come in; you look like you need a port in the storm.”
“Find a new Pack already, did you?” She frowned. “Haven’t forgotten--”
“Good night, Draco.”
“Huh? Oh.” Draco put his hands in his lap. He was so fucked, and not in the fun way.
It was a weak truce, with Narcissa and Harry so close as to both be half on the bed. Lucius and Andromeda had taken over opposite corners of the room, as if they couldn’t stand to be a bit closer to each other. And Alice was still there, arms crossed and leaning against the wall by the door. A few times the mediwitch came in to check Draco’s vitals.
And around again. And again. And again, until Weatherby knocked on the door and asked if Master needed a late night snack or drink.
“No, our regular guy is out for some reason this month.”
So back down the hall towards a different set of stairs where Neil was splayed across another red sofa, in the middle of about ten people all listening to Distrubed on someone’s mobile--Draco suspected Neil’s. He skidded to a stop. “Hey.”
“Great,” Hermione smiled at him. “Now I feel all emotional and like I need to invite him to lunch.” They walked about into the living room.
Harry rubbed the scar on his hand again. “I told you, I didn’t do it for you, I’m solving a case. Can’t solve a case without all the facts, and so far, you’re the only fact I have.” He got out a skillet and broke two eggs into a bowl.
“It’s bad, Hermione.” Harry admitted. “It’s--I’m--pretty sure, and I’ve-I’ve just messed everything up.” He dug his palms into his eyes.
Draco chuckled. “Tell me about this Robin Hood.”
And Luis shrugged. “It took us too long to identify the boats. The boats are La Vitesse, Etoile, Fatima, et Arthur.”
Harry didn’t say anything, but the way Malfoy’s fingers played across the counter and how he didn’t look anyone in the eye pulled at Harry’s chest. And then bright sunny Trevor was back. “Shall we watch the rest of the game?”
“God, I could ride your cock all night.” Up and down, Harry’s nails biting into his skin. “Feels so good, you inside me, hitting all the right places.” Up and down. Malfoy bit his lip, but kept his gaze steady. “Will you touch me?”
Tilly inhaled deeply and then exhaled loudly. “He’s on shots and beer. Good thing you got that practice at the rent party. This is gonna suck.”
“Couldn’t leave you here,” Harry said quietly, gasping for air. “Had to fulfill my vow.” The cup broke, and Harry trailed his fingers through the liquid
Draco dug his nails into his knees. Games and Sports would not help him restore the Malfoy name. Games and Sports would not put him in close connection with muggles or people of influence or anything important. Games and Sports was a joke.
“But, evil doesn’t start when someone commits a crime, it comes before that.”
“What did you think of Astoria?” Narcissa asked almost before the door shut.
“Yeah,” Draco’s head shot up from where he had been trying to fold napkins. “No boyfriend for me.”
“What stuff?” she asked, confused.
The noise jerked Malfoy’s attention away from Harry’s cock and to the reason they were there. He quickly yanked at his own trousers, fumbling to get them off, to turn and bend over the side of the bed so that Harry could work a slick finger inside of him. And Harry did. Inside, Malfoy was an inferno, so hot and tight, and Harry could barely move his finger, barely understood what he should do now. But he was definitely not going to fit unless Malfoy relaxed.
“I’m sure you know how impressionable youth can be. A kind word or expression and they fancy themselves in love.” He waved his hand dismissively, but Harry saw him carefully adjusting his trousers.
“Malfoy?”
“What am I doing here? Why the fuck didn’t you call me?!”
Malfoy warned, and it dawned on Harry the purpose of the blood. What the fuck!
Harry squeezed his hands tightly. “You were told to leave him alone, that we would go up and say good night at the end of the party. Why didn’t you wait? Why did you bring Rosie up here?”
Somehow Sophie broke away from Tilly and Evan, dashing down the pavement towards the tube station, and Draco and Harry were standing still. Draco brought a hand up to Harry’s face, turning the both of them towards each other. “Hey,” he smiled
“So he’s a popular arsehole then.”
“You’re not dressed yet?” Ron asked, pulling at his own dress robes.
And Draco did turn around then, hands still clenched at his sides, eyes blazing out fiercely. “What do you want from me, Harry? I’m a territorial bastard who smelled you smelling like someone else and couldn’t stand it, not again. And I lost my head for a moment. It’s not my business who you smell like or why.”
A little over an hour later, the apartment was cleaner than it had been since Harry moved in. And even though it was time for the supermarket, Harry dithered, sorting the laundry into piles for washing and digging out the detergent. He wasn’t really thinking about laundry though. All week, Malfoy had been the one doing the cooking, but Malfoy didn’t leave the flat. Harry certainly didn’t want to do something with Malfoy, but should he ask what kind of groceries to buy?
“It’s just, you’re the first Werewolf who’s agreed to speak with me.”
She made a little frown that only wrinkled her mouth. “Why are all the hot ones gay?”
“Not at all.” Draco replied with a bland smile for both of them. “It’s nice to see you in your element. I was merely enjoying the view. Would you care for another glass of wine? Zabini?”
“S’to prove I trust you,” Malfoy slurred, and waved vaguely towards the window where Harry could see an owl hovering. “Tha’s for you.” And then passed out on the floor. The whole sickening incident suddenly over and Harry was still panting and twitching with adrenaline.
“Oh.” There wasn’t really enough there for Harry to continue to ask questions.
Draco groaned with his entire body. “I couldn’t possibly go back, not yet. I haven’t felt this glorious in a long time.” Draco rolled his head about, stretching his neck, and luxuriating in the knowledge that he had bested Potter. “Let’s eat. I’m starving.”
“I’m not going to fuck you,” he shouted over the noise.
“I know!” Draco dared to lift his head and look Harry in the eye, and then repeated softly. “I know. And part of what makes me not that person any more is that I don’t live in that world anymore. I don’t do magic, and I don’t go to wizarding places. I do this now.” He gestured to the office around him.
But sometimes, when Harry looked at Neville, he could only remember the round boy who couldn’t keep track of his toad. It seemed desperately unfair that that boy was having sex and Harry wasn’t.
He looked suddenly relieved, and Draco wondered if Mr. and Mrs. Prewitt had been as nervous about this meal as well.
Tilly got out teabags. “What do we do? I’ve tried everything. And I am pretty sure he has been listening to that Lewis Capaldi song on repeat for the last two hours.”
And fuck you. DM
“I would put money down that it is.” Roxi took another sip and followed as Harry nearly ran to the hall where Lacy was hanging their coats while Ron hid behind Hermione.
“What about a whole Pack?”
Harry jerked out of the chair. Something else must have happened. Hermione might know; Hermione worked in the DMLE too. She and Draco were both lawyers. Draco tried the criminal element, and Hermione took on bad laws, so their paths rarely crossed. But she might know something.
Harry thought it would bother him, the casual way he moved through the house, as if he hadn’t been part of something horrible. But it didn’t.
“It would actually, if I didn’t think he was just waiting for a quiet moment to tell me himself.” Draco sighed loudly. “They mean well.”
Malfoy took a quick swallow of his tea. “Not the whole Pack, just a few. They--” he licked his lips. “--they had too much energy to stay cooped up inside, not that close to the full moon.”
No longer quite so fuzzy. “Fine.”
“Yeah, about that, when do you think you’ll be back?”
“Oh shit.”
“Don’t worry about him. He gets like that around Mama Gigi.” Roxi waved her hand dismissively. “It’s best just to give them a few minutes. Well look at this, I’ve got Jack, Crown, and Bulleit.” She held up a glass with ice. “No sour mix though.”
“Oh,” Malfoy said, clearly surprised. They both made to pick up the paper bags. Harry got one and Draco snatched the other two. “I can get them.” He scowled.
“Really?” She plopped her chin in her hand and stared. “What brought this on?”
He ordered a water from the bar, played a game of darts by himself, chatted briefly with a few people. And then the blond came over with two rum and Cokes in his hand.
Teddy let them talk work for a few minutes while he munched his way through the meat and potatoes, trying to avoid the carrots and peas. But it wasn’t long before he was jumping out of his chair and trying to tell Harry all about his day, about the letters they learned in school and about the order of the numbers. He talked about his art project, something with colored ice cubes and how they tasted just like really cold water but turned his tongue and mouth black. He told Harry all about the bugys in the yard, and how Andromeda let him skip his nap. And all Harry had to do was nod and smile and make noncommittal noises, and it was so easy and relaxing to listen to his chatter.
“Yes.”
Harry put his drink down on the side table and turned to look at the bottles on the bar. “I didn’t mean for us to get in a fight.”
They were wrinkled and easier to look at than the pale expanse of Draco’s chest. “She’s a decent human being! You’re just a Death Eater!” Harry shouted back.
“Who Luna’s dating.”
Malfoy straightened up. “You don’t know much about Pack, do you?”
Harry couldn’t help but see the ring Neville had put on Hannah’s finger three weeks ago. It gleamed and winked from her finger, and he swallowed against the sight.
Draco waited several minutes before finally snatching the cork and shoving it back inside the shepherdess and angrily dropping her back in the crate and starting on the next one. “Stupid Henri, stupid Harry. Stupid, whore figurines. Fucking stupid dragon parts.”
“Do you read?” Malfoy asked as he flipped through the table of contents.
Malfoy leaned all the way across the table. “Yes I do. I don’t have to tell you shit, and if I don’t want to tell you something, I’m not going to tell you.” His voice was a low growl, deep and guttural, a threat and a promise rolled together.
Sometimes Draco still thought about that moment when he took himself in hand. For nearly a year, when he dreamed of Harry it was in the club.
He started to roll, to see who he’d brought home. A flash of white hair, and Harry fully woke up and remembered. He jerked and pulled away, much to the disappointment of his body. But Malfoy followed him, eyes still closed and nose now tracing along Harry’s jaw. Harry shoved a hand between them and said, as sternly as he could muster, “Malfoy.”
“Really?” Harry asked.
He couldn’t hope for more than that, no matter how kind Andromeda was or how comfortable he felt in the house. Those hopes and needs weren’t ever going to be fulfilled. And certainly not from Potter! Potter was never going to be the one to hand Draco a cool cloth when the wolfsbane made him sick, and Potter wasn’t going to go clubbing with him when he couldn’t sit still inside for one second longer. And Potter wasn’t going to sit next to him at meals and hold his hand, or wrap his arm around Draco’s waist, or press their foreheads together. Or let Draco do any of those things to him.
“Bloody wankers,” James snarled.
“But yesterday--”
“As I said,” Faye used her Alpha voice, “I don’t have a wand.”
Tilly looked him over carefully. “Alright then. Want pancakes?”
Luis nodded to himself. “Yesterday. We estimate it took approximately twelve days to arrive.”
“How do you figure it out?”
And Harry was pushing up Malfoy’s knees, having somehow ended up on top, with one slick finger pushing into Malfoy’s hole when a brief wince crossed Malfoy’s face and everything stopped.
Until Draco turned back to him. “Harry,” he said, and his voice was so full that Harry’s gaze snapped to him, and then Draco’s hands were on his face forcing him to look at Draco. “Breath, just breath.”
He tossed back the last of the vodka and spread his arms as wide as he could in the crowd. “Well, here I am, defying your expectations,” he taunted.
“It felt different. Dreams feel real when you are in them, and then you wake up and they feel like dreams. This one didn’t. This one felt real even after I woke.”
“I’m teaching right now, but only during the week. It’s an easy portkey to get here,” Draco said, putting a hand on Harry’s face.
Faye leaned back in her chair. “And here I thought you were interested in learning about Packs and Alphas. Why require the presence of an Alpha if you have no interest in hearing what one has to say?”
“And I believe we have more to gain from speaking with those people.” Atkinson’s voice cracked like ice.
It didn’t dawn on Harry that Jude might have mentioned it. Draco considered telling Harry, but then remembered that Jude had asked to be on the schedule for Friday night specifically so that he didn’t have to attend and so he decided to say nothing.
He was at the docks, going sorting through enchanted shirts with two others from customs and border control when a stash of spines was found tucked underneath the clothing. Everyone stopped and stared at the jar of glittering spines while the man who had found them whooped loudly.
“Aren’t you going to investigate?” Atkinson snarled, finally succumbing to Harry’s irritating antics.
Emmerson popped his head into the room. He had apparently decided to grow a beard in the time Harry had been gone. “Robards is going to kill you if he finds out you left Draco Malfoy alone with evidence.”
And then they were sitting at the table, waiting for the tea to steep, and talking about nothing. Molly mentioned the most recent Harpies match, and they talked about their chances at the World Cup, and then they talked about Ginny. “A nose ring! I just don’t understand her any more.” Molly shook her head, and Harry made sympathetic noises.
But I can’t remember what happened. And Dray’s not here. He is supposed to be here. Where is he?” Her voice took on another high pitched shriek.
The harsh bark of laughter answered Harry’s question. “That would be nice.”
Grace turned and stared at Harry. “Everyone can be helped.”
“Oh god,” and then Draco
The crowd shifted, parted, to see who had spoken, a young woman with a heart shaped face who should have looked very pretty, but her face was twisted with grief and hate. Harry recognized Jones with a start as she raised her wand, pointed first towards Faye and the Chief Sorceress and then up at the ceiling, “Bombarda Maxima!”
“Normally, this time of the month, you can hardly keep me out, good thing I have you. You’ll keep me out of trouble, right?”
“Would you like a closer look?" The man asked.
Of course he had scars. “Merlin, we were awful in school.”
Dean threw the envelope down on the table with more force the necessary, and Draco remembered this was an off month. He glanced down and saw his own name in Harry’s chicken scratch. “Are you delivering post now? Because owls will cross the channel.”
“What about the summer?” Jude asked, suddenly looking as young as he actually was.
“I’ll just finish this up then!” Jude shouted as Harry and Ginny trampled down the stairs.
“He’s not a risk!”
It was Alice who spoke. “Teddy, can you feel Draco?” Her voice was soft and careful.
“Are you going to say anything?” Potter demanded, voice rough.
Again, Ron went lightly, not wanting to spook Harry. “I know you’re--mates, but I was surprised last night.”
The mattress creaked a little as she climbed back in. “We have a few days to decide.” There was the wet sound of kissing. “I can’t wait to see you tomorrow.” She giggled.
Harry knelt down, poured out the first hour, and thrust his head into the bowl.
Draco rummaged through the cabinet for the sour mix and then through the fridge for cold sparkling water or ice or something else to tone down the flavor.
Malfoy shook his head. “No. But we all know about the other two.”
“So glad you guys could make it.”
He worked through his lunch, got an owl back from Professor Connor saying Harry could stop by during office hours that afternoon, and then grabbed a stale looking sandwich from the canteen on his way out the door.
“I informed him yesterday that I intend to cooperate fully with the investigation and that his presence was not required unless it went to trial.” Draco kept his feet up on the table with his arms crossed and his eyes closed.
“Yes.” Malfoy forked his vegetables carefully into his mouth and ignored the way Teddy’s elbow banged into him. “I’ll need to be there in the afternoon to prep the bar. I’ll need to go back to my flat beforehand.”
He scrubbed his face with the wet towel. And if Potter wasn’t going to do any of those things, he certainly wasn’t going to have sex with Draco. No matter that sometimes Draco could smell interest on him, no matter that he had more then a passing interest in sex with Potter.
He yanked the denims and shirt on and followed her out the door. Tilly led the way to the tube because while Draco was now confident in his ability to get to the bar, Crouch End was a whole different issue. And to be honest, Draco wasn’t all that confident in the name.
One thing that I didn't quite get worked into the story (for lots of reasons) was the specifics of music in the magical world, which is to say, I imagine that it's a lot of covers of muggle music. So, in my mind, Draco has a deep love of covers, so you may notice that many of the songs linked are covers. ILY is a cover of a song that has been covered many, many times. If you are interested, here are some more links.
What would he look like as Harry pushed slick fingers inside? Would he squirm or go still? Would his eyes open or shut? And when Harry found that spot? What would Malfoy do? Harry stroked himself harder, squeezing and thrusting, and coming to the image of Malfoy pinned beneath him.
Jude chuckled into his magazine and shook his head. He listened to the heavy stomps, the occasional bang, and one loudly shouted fuck, before tossing the magazine back on the table and moseying up the stairs to help Harry with the nightmare that was the bathroom. Luckily for Harry, household spells were something Jude had a lot of experience in.
But Draco was pushing against him and wiggling and whining. “Please, please, please!” Breathless with want.
“It’s those bloody purists!” Hermione was well into her rant now, and also at least a little drunk, based on the way she was glowering at Harry. “They think separation is the only way, but integration is what’s best for everyone. We can’t just reject the Weres, force them to live like muggles. They’re magical too, we have to respect that. And they can bring a lot of value to our community. There must be so much that they know that we have no idea about. For example the Packs, that’s new. I’ve been doing some research and two hundred and fifty years ago, there was a surge in the Werewolf population that led to Packs and immediately after the Packs arrived there was a huge decrease in the number of turnings. Why? And then, within fifty years, the population returned to the previously low levels and bitings increased. Is it some kind of cyclical nature?”
“There was hyssop in the potion. I need to know how common it is for the brewers to include that.” His voice was quiet.
“You might want to look into this too.” He tapped the grainy picture. “That’s Nicole, Mark, Rikki, and Hayley.” He pointed to each face in turn. “Kathleen was their Alpha, a great big red wolf with a crooked tail.”
“I am going in that room!” Harry shouted back. Because that was where Tetchy Bloke went, and if Tetchy was there then Draco might be there, and Harry had to know where Draco was.
Why was Draco Malfoy in a Muggle club with his leg thrust between the legs of another man, shuddering and looking utterly taken? His throat was one long line, and so smooth, eyes half lidded, mouth bitten pink. Is that what he looked like in the heat of the moment? Is that what he would look like if, instead of the strange bloke, it were Harry?
Harry shifted the tote to his other side and picked up the pace. Emmerson, Hughs, and Michaels all started to say something in the hall as Harry made his way to interrogation room five. “What are you doing with those?”
Draco stopped counting notes as he went cold. It was out now then, that he was living in Muggle London, there would be more of them. Longbottom just might be the tip of the iceberg.
But Harry couldn’t.
They climbed up the stairs in an awkward silence, and Harry paused outside his bedroom door, the only room he’d deemed liveable, but that had been so long ago. He opened the door next to his, Regulus’s, which was surprisingly clean albeit musty smelling. The oversized duvet on the bed hung flat on top across the top, all the stuffing having fallen to the edges which drooped along the floor. The shelves and wardrobe had turned grey from dust, but it was tidy at least.
He heard her sigh loudly. “It’s not hospitality, it’s good business practice.”
The conversation drifted to Daphne and Theodore Nott, and Mr. Greengrass complained to Draco that women always talk about babies and then asked a question about politics that Draco couldn’t answer.
“She shouldn’t have to do any of this,” Harry grumbled, doing up his laces.
And Harry just felt irritated because that’s what he meant. “You knew there would be a reporter there. They follow us everywhere. I swear I had one ask for an interview from the loo.” He paused. He and Draco had gotten lucky last night; they really couldn’t behave that way.
“I didn’t do anything.”
Draco followed Potter into the house where Teddy was bouncing in the entryway. He latched on to Draco’s hand and pulled him towards the back door when Potter suggested it. It was smaller than Draco was expecting, but still large enough for one energetic boy to run, with several trees (one which was good for climbing), and a shed. There was a patio with a small table and three chairs.
But Draco wasn’t at the Stubborn Goat, and Tetchy Bartender wasn’t there either, and by the time Harry called it a night he was completely sloshed. He stumbled up the steps of Grimmauld Place, completely unable to remember how he’d gotten there and beyond caring. He fell over onto the sofa and very promptly blacked out.
Draco sucked on his drink. He wanted to tell Harry he didn’t understand the difference, that he was the same man, but he felt different. Not necessarily good or bad but definitely different. He settled for, “You’re drunk.”
“Most likely.”
Harry picked up his third drink, determined to make it last a little longer, and began to walk through the room. He spotted the redhead, and managed to make eye contact. “Hello.” Harry said.
“The bite on my hip and the monthly urges to run through the wild would argue otherwise.” He waved his hand dismissively through the air.
“That’s not the way it works, sweetie.” Florence shook her head.
Draco flipped back upright when the tingling on his skin made him restless. It was always like this close to the full moon, too much energy and excitement and everyone in the flat itchy and bright. “Why are you in there?” Because usually Sawyer would be out at the movies or the restaurant, or just roaming the streets.
And Harry thought about Jude and Sarah and how he had been doing a shit job of finding her. This was his chance to make that better. And besides, if he couldn’t sleep he might as well work. “Yes sir.”
Harry turned back to Atkinson, “I appreciate your thinking of me, but if you can’t tell me anything about the crime, then I don’t think I can be of much use to you.” He stood.
The fall wasn’t enough to incapacitate Harry, for all that now he was sprawled across the floor behind the sofa. He pulled himself up enough to see the door around all the furniture. Another Auror might have hesitated to strike out at a child, but as soon as Harry saw the other, a boy maybe all of fifteen, he cried out, “Incarcerous!” And the boy was immediately bound in thick ropes.
He could feel her looking at him. “I’m not saying I want to be best friends, share bracelets and braid each other’s hair.” She touched his left arm at the crook of his elbow. “Sometimes, you have to make an effort for family, and Teddy clearly adores you.”
“Sir!” Robards hurried to his side. “The situation is not secure. I recommend…” He trailed off into a heated whisper.
“Oh my god, you really tripped over your own two feet!” Draco kept chuckling, and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be embarrassed.
:) Come to England and I will HP
It wasn’t just coffee. Draco pressed his lips into a thin line and wrapped both hands around the cup as he gathered his courage to look at her and say, “I can’t thank you enough.”
Jenkin blinked. “You’re the first person to come up with an actual lead and this is the third event. Even if he isn’t, I’m not messing with something that works. If you hit a dead end, we’ll reevaluate, but for now, you’re it.”
“What happened?” Shacklebolt asked.
The first set of words jumped out of the way leaving behind the private message first.
There was a desperate sort of moment in the room where everyone held their breath and waited to see if Draco would wake up. Harry kept his eyes trained on Draco’s face, on his eyes for the slightest flutter. Those farther away watched for a twitch or jerk of the arm or leg. But there was nothing.
There was so much lube now it squelched and Malfoy wiggled and jerked on the bed, rocking up into Harry’s hand and then down against the blankets, looking for friction, Harry realized suddenly. He withdrew his hand and wiped another generous glob of lube across his cock, and then slowly pushed forward.
No wonder Draco liked her, if she had that reaction to Harry. All of a sudden, like the flip of a light switch, Harry felt small in this small and dim space; with Draco she had smiled and joked. “I, uh, I’m looking for someone. He comes in here sometimes, blond, pointy face, this tall?”
Harry pulled on his joggers and turned to Draco, eyes nearly impossible to see in the light. He was quiet for a long moment. “She’s ten times what you’ll ever be,” he muttered, finally remembering what he was supposed to be doing.
“Unlike you,” Tilly shook her head, “I have work to do. Good luck!”
“Are you sure? She can be quite defensive of him when she wants to be.”
“No,” Harry said, “maybe.”
“You’ve been on nights for six years, you know Jenkins would switch you to days if you asked,” Harry pointed out.
--and complaining about the number of cups piled next to the sink--
Jenkins rolled her eyes, and started tapping away at her computer. Technically, Roxi wasn’t supposed to track phones without a supervisor’s approval, but most everyone in the department used the software to keep track of errant children or siblings. Draco was usually the one tracking down Marie or Lacy for Roxie.
Harry snatched the parchment and quickly read over the lines. I no longer require your assistance as I have recovered my lost artifact. Thank you for your cooperation. Rest assured my notes will reflect the aid your department has rendered me in this time of need.
Hermione pulled back from him, and Ron sat down on the bed next to her, close to Harry, close enough to run his hand down Harry’s arm.
Harry ate his lunch in the canteen, thinking the happy chatter would help keep those thoughts at bay. But the group of administrative aids at the other end of the table were debating the merits of two different clubs, and that wasn’t helpful at all. Was Jude working at a muggle bar or a wizarding one? Was it that one in Knockturn which was always getting shut down for illegal potions dealing? Was Jude getting caught up in that? Because those potions were unregulated and just as likely to harm someone as get them high.
Harry dropped his hands and didn’t say anything which spoke louder than he possibly could have.
But Harry couldn’t hear him. His mouth was moving, screaming even, hands pounding against the barrier. Harry twisted to the left, and the curse flew over his shoulder and was absorbed by the barrier. Harry threw up a protection shield and hastily scanned the lab for Atkinson. “Where are you?”
