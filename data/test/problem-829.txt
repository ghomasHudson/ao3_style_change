Harry lingered at the door to Ravenclaw, waiting for Draco to answer the riddle. "What, did Dumbledore tell you to make sure I went straight here?" he joked, but Harry just solemnly nodded.
Gilderoy's hands went to the top button on his shirt, looking scarcely able to breathe. "You want me to- to show you my scars?"
The Basilisk thrashed, end flashing out, and its tail caught Draco and made him fly. He was smashed through the air, into a wall dozens of meters away.
"With extra toasted coconut flakes?" Pansy offered, along with a lovely chocolate and almond croissant waiting beside it. Millie rolled her eyes and began to grill Draco about what
Severus gave them an hour and a half to brew the draught of peace, which all of Draco's friends knew to be one of the anti-anxiety potions Draco regularly took. Once or twice, he had shared a vial with them. At least they didn't all gape at him when it was mentioned. The potion was difficult enough for them to be preoccupied with struggling to make it, and in many cases, failing.
The look of the basements and ramped lower passages was of a grimness beyond even Draco's imagining. They were devoid of the Borgin and Burkes-style dark wizard trappings Draco had automatically imagined, dirty and dusty, and without any torches left in the rusting iron holders, the only light Draco's cautious Bluebell flame in hand. Feet were inevitably louder than they should have been here, impossible to avoid all the bones and skulls and decaying organic traces underfoot, which should rightly have only been upstairs where there were cells.
"I'll sit this last round out," Draco said, with a lazy aimless wave of his wand, kicking his feet idly before him where he was perched on Potter's desk. "And you might as well say what you're thinking of, Potter, it's not like a birthday wish, telling won't make it not come true..."
Draco stared down at him, surprised to find him so unhappy not to be chosen. "You thought it would be you, not Ron, huh?"
"There are three acceptable categories for discredit- for disjunction- disclosure," Draco finally finished, the longer word deserting him momentarily. "Disclosure. Only, ah, three. One, more observations on my glorious ineptitude- eptitude- aptitude, ah, as a captain and a Seeker. Two, the presence of
It came to him like a brand on the air, the afterimage of the symbol repeated between reversed words, over Harry's defiant face that stood in for his reflection. It had appeared between the words on the Mirror of Ecidyrue, over his own face at eighteen, bitter and gaunt from Azkaban, and stumbling drunk.
Maybe he had actually started to hope that Father was softening, that he had chosen to take a more constructive collaborative approach to his newly-matured son, with his willingness to accept Hermione as proof. That maybe, time with Hermione might even somehow soften Father a bit when it came to Voldemort's ideology, as knowing her had done for Draco.
"Count me out," Draco said hastily. "I'm going to send an owl." When the Slytherins protested, Draco quipped, "Very important blood magic to perform, you know, the Yule is
"Oh, shit," Draco blurted, and ran forward. It was then he looked up and saw the Gryffindor section had not completely emptied: Hermione was still standing there alone, staring over and smiling. She waved at him, and his heart could not have felt fuller, as Umbridge announced,
too, with a rose-pink flush creeping over his cheeks and throat and collarbones at the nearby heat. "Just don't, um, get why you think I have to stay..." Draco breathed.
Theo pulled himself away from Draco's arm as soon as they were alone, glaring down at him with real disquiet. "You do need to stop that, Draco, if we
She had tried to warn him. If she had told the truth, and she had really wanted to save him, then she had put herself forward in that assault, a Death Eater attack like she never had taken part in during the blue loop, really for his sake. Depending on what Bellatrix knew or had told her about Dantanian- she had risked her life again for him, this time in a desperate gambit to try and warn him. She
He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Draco supposed there was no accounting for taste. Slowly, the dog's growls ceased- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.
Prevented, he had thought, the words that all the children were staring at now, painted in foot-tall letters that looked like smeared blood:
Dean and Seamus directed them to the Weasley tent, upon which the Slytherin girls found excuses to be elsewhere, and Draco tried casually to ask who else had come. Luna saw through him, as the mere thought of who could be there sent him nervously fussing with his hair. The Golden rose clasp still worked, although not as well as it had before all the snake blood had gotten on it. Luna let out her airy giggle. "Oh, there's someone specific he wants to be there," she said knowingly. Draco fought the urge to cast Deprimo on the ground to make a hole to crawl inside, until she added, "A certain dragontamer," and Draco's shoulders relaxed.
Dantanian was still wearing the dragon pendant around his neck. It shone as the point which drew all light, on a vast green mountain slope, amidst a sea of silver dragons.
It made Draco feel awkward in a way he hadn't for weeks. "Don't think the invitation extended to me," he said, leaning back in his chair. "Go off and have your little adventure, children. I'll be in the library."
"No," Harry said, loudly and distinctly to some command that Draco couldn't hear, and Father slammed his walking stick across Harry's face. Harry crumpled to the ground, and the shrill, unhinged female laugh then- Draco
All in all, it could have gone worse. He hadn't gotten any further than Aunt Bella had in learning how to make a Patronus from Lupin. But he hadn't gotten any
Apparently McGonagall had been alerted in her office. She had to come up and tell the Fat Lady to stop screaming, which couldn't have made Draco many more friends in Gryffindor. She found him sitting glumly on the top stair step, munching on a sandwich that Hermione had snuck out to him. He sat there waiting for the worst while McGonagall expertly coaxed the Fat Lady into quiet, and then she had looked down at Draco and said, "Mr. Malfoy. Would you care to explain?"
"I'll question him as much as you want," Draco sighed, "Or you can, but he wasn't part of their research. He's talked about how it was. To him it just seemed fairytale nonsense. He wasn't
"If there is no reason for me to search," Severus said silkily, "Then why do you wish me not to search it?"
"Portus clausus!" Draco yelled, and a dark purple light surged out from his wand, enveloping the cup with a resistance that surged back up against his hand. That was the telltale resistance that meant it was a Portkey and not just an ordinary object he was casting against, and the resistance was potent. He closed his eyes and prolonged the spell, envisioning every way open to fly around them slowly being foreclosed for that paltry cup.
"Impressive," Draco said, and didn't get off his knees. He regarded Harry from the floor, tilting his head. He flattened each palm over Harry's instep, and Harry's smugness faded, going more flustered. "Once you've gotten it right, that's it for the lying game, you know. Time for me to cast Legilimens and make you fight me up front." He tossed his hair back, watching the unsteady rise and fall of Harry's chest, as he peered down with increasing focus. "If you want me down here, Harry, the carpet's comfortable. If it makes
"He is, though," Draco said loudly, "My boyfriend," and hoped Fleur had not been giving any cheek-kisses to Harry. She had to be fond of him, as the savior of her sister in the tournament. Granted, he had no illusions Fleur would make a serious attempt to take anyone's man, having secured a specimen of a man like Bill. But he didn't like the idea of her lips anywhere near his Harry, or her Veela powers making Harry
But it wasn't one he minded giving, nor a secret it pained him to give away. Not to Harry beside him with the light off the moonstones flickering across his face like it shone most strongly from him alone.
Grindelwald's intelligent eyes had shown humor at Draco's mock preening, but he didn't hesitate to keep delivering precise little blows. "No, kaktusbl√ºte, in your head." Draco touched his head of now-dark hair, biting his lip and tugging on his long braid. Grindelwald laughed aloud, at what must have been a very young and dumb picture. "You are an exceptional Occlumens. Too exceptional. No training can make any wizard have the kind of walls you do- walls that make penetration not merely incredibly difficult but inherently impossible, to any intruder of any power. I felt them as you pushed at mine, and even Albus was never my equal at Legilimency. Have you ever wondered
"Do they?" Potter cut in, and gulped down a full cup of green-tinged water like it had done something to offend him. "In my experience, Draco isn't the kind to really like talk of being
"Except for my, er, my godfather, 'course," Draco said uneasily, trying to pull his arm away, but the motion just let a very drunken Theo slide his fingers down to intertwine with Draco's.
But there was no heart in Severus's words, and Draco could read in that instant how much of his usual spirit had been tortured out of him. "
The lady at the counter looked rather nauseated. When he asked for the coat gift-wrapped, she looked down at its lavish fur, lip curling squeamishly, and asked, "Is
It was mystifying, the intermittencies of the heart. Not an hour after rebuffing Severus and wishing him dead, he was now virtually ready to murder another in his defense.
Luna got bored with his subpar stunning and said she wanted to see him practice shielding, instead. Her excited chattering about the time he had saved her from twenty Stunning spells soon attracted a large crowd, while Harry was off in the corner trying to convince Fred and George that they shouldn't be aiming their Stunning spells at Terry Boot's back instead of each other. Soon, Luna had enough of an audience that she had to start again.
"Were any of the other artifacts brought to that case during your time?" Draco asked, cautiously putting down his next card. Dobby was quickly coming to better him at this game as well.
But once the Portkey landed him in Grimmauld, it was hard to honestly regret that this place and these people had become his home. Whatever cost it would have, for those foolish enough to shelter a dragon.
"Burgundy," Theo said, of all the most inane arguments to stall the wheel of fate from crashing down. "It's burgundy. Like burgundy wine."
"How many times did you say I was a completely different person after I got my wand?" Draco marveled at Severus's obvious lying, though of course he didn't know there was the pesky time-traveling issue, also to account for changes. But there was still- "How
A warmth swam over Draco's body, a bright golden contentment to replace all his agitation, a brief spark of alarm fading at that respite. All the comedown from the Felix Felicis, all the doubt, all the terrible unending series of choices before him went up in a sweet haze. There was nothing but faith that everything would be perfectly fine as long as he did as he was told...
"I never thought to look in here!" Granger whispered excitedly. "I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
She barked in response. Draco jumped back, only to bump into another bed. There was a pale man with a passing resemblance to Severus, staring at the ceiling mumbling to himself. Draco stumbling against his bed didn't draw his attention, or even interrupt his mumbling. But a sound came from another room of a cheerful maternal voice, and then a flash of lime-green Healer robes coming out. "Oh, poor dears, has somebody fallen..."
The person staggered up and then halted. "Hello?" called Potter, and Draco whacked him on the arm and put a finger to his lips. One by one, they stifled the light from their wands, and put Little Krum back to small size in Ron's pocket.
"Le-gi-ti-mate," Dantanian sounded out, though it still seemed hard for him to pronounce. "And Grandfather did not want to anger his wife, so he sent Grandmother to France. He wanted her to call you a Weston. But she gave you the Black name in French, and he could not stop her. That is why we are Noir, and why our sigil is the Black greyhounds in- intro-"
"It fits perfectly," Draco said, trying to muster some of the admiration he would have had if Theo's eyes on him had not felt like a crushing weight, and Harry gave him an adoring smile, one blind to anyone else in the room with them.
Ron's gaze went unexpectedly serious in turn. "Draco," he said slowly, "If you're in trouble, you have to tell us. If your family- your father-" There was fear in his eyes, but a Gryffindor resolve that looked no weaker than in his 18-year-old self. "If you need us, we'll help you. The three of us. Just send word and we'll figure something out. My family-"
you, you ungrateful boy. You were a good son before that wand." That was the first news Draco had ever heard of that. "And once you no longer have it, you
"Hands above your head!" Thomas barked, sounding like those Muggle cop shows Mr. Granger liked to watch. Draco let his hands fall behind his head on the carpet with a groan.
"It was this diary," said Potter quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. "Riddle wrote it when he was a fifth-year."
He escaped any further dialogue with a living soul the next day, except if you counted his father. Draco had been all set to breakfast with the house elves, but that Malfoy pride had disastrously guided him to show his face and hold his head high, show that whatever anyone said of him, he was still better than all of them. That resolve lasted only as long as it took for the scarlet letter, a flash of Gryffindor red that instinctively caught every eye at the Slytherin table.
"A cursory investigation of such," Grindelwald said dryly, "Proved that if Dorian had been unworthy, no other Malfoy was likely to come anywhere
, perhaps at passing pigeons for all the good it would do. At least Dumbledore's weirdness provided distraction enough to empty the potion vial into his pumpkin juice, and down it as everyone else began to eat.
"The Basilisk- what?" Draco blinked, and she gestured beamingly over to where with a chanting mass of supporters, all four old members of the team had gotten a crystal bowl large enough to hold a mouthful of Basilisk fangs, if not the whole Basilisk. Bletchley was up on a stool pouring in some unidentifiable bright green substance from above, which Draco had the sneaking suspicion might be absinthe, while paler forms of alcohol were being applied by Montague, double-fisting vodka and gin in, Warrington threw in dashes of questionable-looking powders, and Pucey was adding seltzer like the bland but palatable boy he was.
She turned and gave him a severe sort of non-smile that warmed his heart- all too briefly, before the wind hit too hard to feel warm at all.
"Let's start going back to Hogwarts," Draco said with ostentatiously false brightness, "Godfather and godson trip, how lovely, and I can explain to you who it is you
Elizabeth screamed and Dantanian frowned, unmoved. "No," he said to himself. "No, it's not enough, is it? It's not as much as I was hurt. It's not even close. Grandpa, get out of the way."
, Draco!" she said, as if she expected him to know the word. "She told me that whatever you've been given will be taken back, and
Hey everyone! I've made a playlist for this fic, which I'll be updating with a song for every chapter! Here's the link:
"No," Dantanian said confidently, "Astarte is the girl way to say it. It's a goddess. They took the angel name from her name. The angel's name is a family name."
"What is wrong with you?" Weasley asked furiously, "You really don't care that you could have gotten Harry kicked out," only for Potter to snap at the same time,
Draco's shadow was tall enough to blot away the flame, even as it soared at a wave of his haughty fingertips.
Harry kissed him when he didn't answer, all tongue. Draco pressed closer to stifle his moan, one foot bracing his weight as the other slid up the back of Harry's calf, ankle coiling there.
boots. No one ever wants to see Slytherins succeed but Slytherins." And often not even those fellow Slytherins. "We're the ones who have to stand up for Slytherin on that pitch. We're the ones who have to prove them wrong, because however much they sneer at us, we know we're better than them! We're
"Harry, you don't need to justify yourself," Sirius snapped. "This is ridiculous. Harry is a good person. So is Draco. They've both been through a lot, Snape, and if this makes them happy..."
Draco could have said, feeling the presence of that bent form in his pocket like a condemnation. It was a testimony to his own selfishness being here, embracing a man he was meant to kill. But he just hugged Remus tighter, murmuring his thanks. Even if he did end up turning on Remus before all this was through, he wanted Remus to know he hadn't
"Only Draco Malfoy's wand," Dobby said nervously, "That was the latest. Lucius Malfoy gave it to Dobby to go put in the case, right after the end of the war, but he had Dobby show the way and placed the diary in the case himself- no! No! Bad Dobby! Dobby is speaking secrets- speaking ill of Dobby's family-"
"Shit," Draco hissed, and shot a panicked look at Luna. She grabbed his shoulder, Draco lost his balance, and together, they fell out of the cupboard at Remus's feet.
Draco seized the fallen talon wand back into his hand. "Flipendo!" he yelled, and sent her flying out of the fountain he had been sure he would die in, with his last achievement to improve the Ministry of Magic's aesthetic standards. She fell convulsing to the ground. He recovered both wands and the dagger before leaping down after her.
on the side of the shabby case. "He must be the new Defense professor," Luna said softly. "It wouldn't be kind to wake him, would it? He looks so tired. Hello, Ron, Harry, Hermione. It's nice to see you."
"Seven," Elizabeth answered for him. "Don't speak ill of his mother, Fred, I know she was- but- he's young enough that he doesn't have to- well, he can-" She bent low, to talk right to Dantanian again. "Danny, you don't have to worry. You aren't alone anymore. Your family has found you. We're going to take care of you."
"I'm not going to fall." Potter drew up his shoulders, as if determined to be brave where he had not been wise, but Draco was certain of his culpability.
"We need to talk," Karkaroff whispered. Draco could see Harry trying to eavesdrop almost as intently as Harry was.
He healed it, and didn't manage to slide away without getting more blood on his hands, and this time his knees. The blood was pooling from the cracked empty shell of each stone and running in thick rivulets between them, joining each other to form puddles and then one great flow of blood seeping from the center outwards. Draco had the instinct that he didn't want to let it reach the edges before they were complete. Even if Harry was shaken by what he had witnessed.
Draco wished he could shove off this responsibility on somebody, anybody else. But the only other real Occlumens he knew at Hogwarts was Severus. And the idea of
Luna just gave him a reproachful look. "Now I'll have to start again. We have enough time. Pick up a candle, stand before me, and close your eyes," she ordered. He could hear how over time, she'd taken on some of the bossy inflections of Hermione. "Demon Goddess Hecate, we offer you our solemn prayers. We are your humble servants, who have brought you this offering of blood to bind our beloved to the soil of your everlasting night. We raise up these candles in praise to you..." Draco lifted his obediently, a second after her.
"Blaise says you told them- all the boys with Death Eater fathers- that if their families went back to supporting your aunt or the Dark Lord, that you would
Draco nodded warily, watching Riddle's hands for any sign of movement. "But that was you, wasn't it? Now and fifty years ago."
Draco undid the fly of his trousers. "It's not enough for you, though, is it? I bet you wish you could have your initials on my skin. Your whole name."
"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen- come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'posed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh-"
"It's like raindrops now," Neville said in a small voice, the effort of self-suppression visible, as he stood there manfully letting himself be observed with his endlessly blood-producing hands.
"What requires explanation, Potter," Draco sighed, "Is why someone not licking your boots for once is sufficient proof that they're a dark wizard at large, bent on the downfall of civilization-"
"Here we go, Dantanian," he said to himself, "Here we go," and lifted his wand. "PROTEGO DIABOLICA!"
"Like I said, I don't need details." Remus gave him a comforting pat on the back. "Nor am I here to criticize or condemn."
"Incendio! Incendio! Incendio!" Theo didn't bother not to recite the name of the spell. It boomed out too instead, a cataclysmic tremor, as he cast it three times, once for each of the three brooms they'd brought, behind them still in the castle. All three went up in dramatic flames, heat at their back.
This was already the longest remotely civil conversation he had ever held with Hermione Granger. He was losing his mind. But it seemed giving her answers was the only way to shut her up. "Didn't you hear what Weaselby was on about in that boring boat ride? My parents are wizards, Granger." Strangely, he found it less difficult than he would have thought to hold back from addressing Granger as Mudblood, after he'd watched Aunt Bella carve the word into her arm. "Not Muggles. They've taught me things like that."
"This is," Severus sighed, "A very ancient first edition, as you may see from the disrepair. The tale you must read is one that was removed from subsequent prints. I know not why."
"Professor Moody," she whispered, and Draco turned to look over her shoulder. Crouch had come up, leaning on his staff, to stare at them. Draco felt the brush of the fingers of Legilimency at his mind. He just imagined them being cut on the edge of his mind's dagger, and felt a recoiling pain in return.
Draco refused to leave Potter's side, keeping with him by instinct. But if Draco's vision was significantly better than Potter's, all he was doing was giving Potter a leg up on catching up, if Draco spotted the Snitch first. So Draco took a chance and sped off towards the other end of the pitch, near the mist over the Ravenclaw stands- only to slow when even through the rain, he could see the bright blond beam of Luna Lovegood's hair. He broom came to a stop, like he might freeze then and there and fall-
At least in his first week, while he waited for his back to fully heal so he could confess his secret to Severus, he managed to avoid any and all Gryffindors. That helped keep his life boring. So boring, in fact, that he looked forward to visits to the library, the highlights of his day except for the rare times Severus would deign to speak to him a little, before shooing him. Reading the books he chose was fascinating in comparison to redoing the lessons from first year. Especially once he came to the realization that in order not to draw attention, he would have to avoid showing off with those. There wasn't much real glory anyway, in a seventh-year being the best in a class full of first-years.
The only bright spot of the whole miserable affair, apart from Hermione never being caught for her part, was that at least Peter Weasley got shown up in it. The teachers were all miffed to be roused from their beds, as were the quivering Gryffindors, at the news the Prisoner of Azkaban to be caught, only to find nothing but a sheepish Draco Malfoy on the dorm floor. Soon, he found himself in the Headmaster's office for the second time in the red line, with Severus making wild excuses and incoherent defenses up on the fly for Draco, against all the other furious teachers.
They reached Hagrid's house, which had the eerie pathetic look of the shell of a building half-burnt down. When Potter pushed the door open, Fang was so excited to see him he made a prodigious racket. Draco watched Ron and Potter like they had gone mad as they hastily fed Fang treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, until he realized it glued Fang's teeth together.
"You are not," Grindelwald said confidently, "Who you are showing." Draco thought absurdly of color contacts and hair dyes, until Grindelwald finished, "This is not your age, 'Lysander', nor is this your true body or true face. Whoever you are, it is someone else, and you merely inhabit this form." He folded his hands before him, then said with a wolfish grin, "Why don't you tell me who it is you really are, Mr. Black?"
Draco could see Severus fly through the hole in the window, though Sirius must not be able to, until Severus had lifted his wand and said "Finite incantatem," and then Draco was graced with perhaps the most slack-jawed Gryffindor look of incomprehension he had ever witnessed, from a man on death's door saved by the most unlikely of people.
On June 5, 1997, Draco Lupin Black officially came of age. Turning seventeen, he was now a legal adult, with all the rights and responsibilities- and dangers- that status entailed. Hermione said the world should be quaking if it knew well enough to. The ground literally trembling beneath them, for fear of Draco all grown up. It was not a joke very like Hermione, but then, despite her rueful smile, she hardly seemed to be even half-joking.
"He did try and help a bit," Gilderoy said defensively. "You saw they've bettered. And it was my idea he claim to be meeting your uncles while we were working, and he would go back to the library by himself to read- if you have to blame anyone, blame me-"
anything to feel that again- I know you, I do know you, and what I know- who you are- Draco, I see it, you're a good person, and you're so brilliant- Draco, you're
He had the self-defeating satisfaction of not having gratified Potter by witnessing his victory, not that Potter would have noticed his absence. He thought he had dodged the Chosen One's piss-poor attempts at conversation, until the same night of the match. He was in bed, alternating between playing aimlessly with Imoogi and staring aimlessly at his notes on McGonagall's diagram, when Blaise's voice sounded from outside his cocoon. "Draco, if you're in there and you're not dead, you have a visitor. If a Gryffindor counts as one."
"Harry, you know your parents wouldn't be ashamed, don't you? Of Sirius and Remus, or of you. If I'm not worthy- of your kindness- that's to your
Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom. "Weasley, calm down!" Draco yelled. "Potter will get it!"
"Let them digest that for a minute," Draco advised, and had to open his mouth wide in Potter's direction for far too long before Potter realized he wanted a chocolate frog leg thrown into it. Hermione sighed, obliged, and did it for him. Draco missed, but the three laughing at the chocolate hitting Draco's cheek made him smile at mockery for once. "Okay, digesting done?"
"Flitwick's office," Severus hissed, "Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower, come on," and took one of the school brooms at random for himself. He strode back out, with the night wind making his hooded robe billow more fully than ever behind him.
A laughing Hermione dutifully took Ron and went through with him instead. Neville Longbottom appeared and offered his arm to chauffeur Luna through. Draco watched them go tolerantly, before turning back to Potter with a faux-exasperated air.
At eight o'clock on Thursday evening, Draco went to meet Lupin and Potter in the History of Magic classroom. Potter was there with the classroom lit up when Draco strolled in, staring into space, though he started when he saw Draco. "What are you doing here?"
They all moved silently wherever Weasley sent them. Draco managed to tell himself it was going well until their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay very still, face down.
"Now is your chance to ask any questions you like. Anything on your mind when the Hat put me here. Should I start with what I guarantee that at least one is you is wondering? Yes, I am gay, and no, I will not be watching you change, spying on you, or molesting you in your sleep. I am not interested in any of you. Based on my track record with dormmates, you are far more likely to have me murder one of your family members than proposition you."
"If that's true," Draco whispered, affecting a confidence he didn't feel, "Then why are you letting me get on top of you?"
"Now we're getting somewhere," Draco said fiercely, unsympathetic, rubbing his hands together with a smile for the nervous Luna.
could resist it, just as in the blue loop. It kept him from those temptations to unveil Crouch early.
"You," Mother said icily, loud enough for all of them to hear, "Are lucky your father was not here to witness that display."
making you laugh," Sirius declared, deep dark eyes fixing on Remus with shamelessly violent devotion. "And when I can, the rest just- goes away. Everything I've done wrong. All the wasted years. Everyone who should be here in this room but isn't- everyone who I let down- when I can make you
"What," Severus hissed, leaning down to cast his malignant stare more exactly on Draco's disappointed face, "What, boy, were you ever thinking, to take up this wand as your own?"
"Hey," Ron said, and looked around surreptitiously before sitting down. "You still have permission to do this, right? And, uh, do you mind if I sit down?"
"Okay, I'm closing them," Harry said, pretty thick dark eyelashes sliding down over his hot cheeks. Draco admired the sharp cut of his profile from the side, before waving a hand in front of his eyes. There was no response, so Draco took the cup and put his wand to it.
"Dementors aren't the most enthralling conversationalists," Draco drawled, making it a joke. But he felt a stab of some of the most unwanted affinity he had ever known, right in his chest, as the booming went on outside like London Bridge was falling down. He wished he didn't know personally, what Azkaban did to your ability to function socially. To function at
He felt no such heat, which he told himself had only been a subtler illusion, once he had climbed into his bed. He changed back to his pajamas, and cast the usual protections before seizing Imoogi and burying his face in her. He tried to feel nothing but her worn cloth softness, the smell of her familiar mustiness, nothing of the blue loop, nothing of the horrors he knew full well lived only in his head. But his head, as it turned out, was a place he could not leave, any more than his body. Less, as his own incomplete form of time travel to the red line had shown him. He could go anywhere in any time and not be free of the contents of his own head.
Neville's suit was a shiny white as well. "Is the whole wedding party all in white?" Draco asked skeptically. "Remus, I thought you said you and Sirius were wearing white too..."
I can't lose my magic. So I can be of use to them. Even if I could change the talon wand for another, I wouldn't, because it makes me more
"That's the past," Draco said dismissively, though he could only imagine the kind of afters that would have ensued between Millie and the most skilled of the Gryffindor Chasers, especially after Ginny put some in past her. He knew how well Millie could hold a grudge. And Ginny seemed as stubborn as any of her brothers, too. "There wasn't anything between you at Gryffindor-Slytherin this year, right?"
Apparently, the once-strutting peacock was so ill-informed about the world, he had spoken glumly of the Dementors he thought he would be facing in Azkaban. The vampires had told Lockhart little beyond the rise of Voldemort. The Dark Lord's return had supposedly been an impetus making them bolder, with the eventual intent of joining him the way other dark creatures were. But the vampires hadn't specified Dementors in that group.
And then, halfway down a staircase, Harry was the one to get distracted, trapping himself in a trick step. "Are you serious?" Draco hissed, and Harry just made a mournful noise and tried to pull out his leg. All he managed to do was spill his bag all over the stairs, and then himself, sending him sprawling down out of the cloak, out of Draco's reach. The sound of the rattling golden egg wasn't exactly soft, either. "Potter, you moron!"
, for the record... really, I think its previous owner should be held culpable for all damages..." Black's nostrils flared at the reminder. "If you want to blame someone, blame my lovely Aunt Bella. But if you want to hear about any of the
"I've never seen the mirror," Grindelwald went on, "And it's not clear, how omnipotence is implemented, but I'd imagine some form of portal use is possible, at least theoretically, for anyone connected to the Hallows, or even just the other mirrors, either owning now or just having once owned. Perhaps those trapped in their own dying bodies misused it, or they were those without the Elder Wand- or perhaps they
"A vampire whose years have taught him there are places where humans must tread lightly," Seguinus said with benign enjoyment, "Or be tread upon. My home is such a place.

called Death Eaters, but the stinging in his back was rising again. Defending himself was less important than figuring out a way to take Mother's second vial of numbing potion without anyone noticing- far less important, let alone spouting lies to defend Father. He stared at her dismally, wishing she would punch him in the face again and send him hurtling into the lake, sooner than ask, as she clearly wanted to, why Death Eaters were called that. The Giant Squid had to be a more pleasant conversationalist.
Charlie's friends were an exceedingly Gryffindorish rabble, friendly in a way that Draco found rather off-putting. But no, they just
Draco fought off the urge to berate him for saying the name. "You would have just thought he was more guilty!" he yelled, knowing confrontational was the worst approach he could take, but unable to hide his sense of unfairness. "Because he's tied to my family! You would never have-"
For the first time since taking the Mark, he could think the word of himself and feel it true, because he had made it to scowling oily-haired Severus, viciously unpleasant as ever. He had made it to safety.
OWL review week had been torture to sit through the first time, let alone a second. Draco had to constantly fight against arrogance, telling himself that having sat these OWLs once before should be motivation to try harder, not less, because of how internally humiliating it would be not to succeed even with that extra advantage. And for the most part, he managed not to get too distracted, although Harry's mouth was like a black hole where all sentience went to die. But he managed not to get sucked into its gravitational field too often.
Wormtail was shaking worse than any of them, but the words he spoke seemed to paralyze Potter. "Harry... Harry... you look just like James... he wouldn't have wanted me killed... James would have understood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy..."
Karkaroff must not have expected him to be well-informed, or else he was lamentably unclear on the pseudo-incestuous bonds between former Death Eater families. He just gave Draco a condescending look of bemusement. "I don't know what you are talking about, young Draco. Now make up for your father's rudeness by satisfying my curiosity. Is it true that you cast the Dark Mark, fought off twenty wizards from the Ministry, and yet somehow avoided arrest?"
"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?" said Ron, who was struggling so mightily with his Potions homework that Draco was tempted to put him out of his misery and do it for him, if it weren't for the precedent it would set. "Sounds dead depressing to me..."
He wished for every person he ran past to say some unkind word, pick a fight, any excuse to curse something, or set something on fire. When he made it to the dressing room, even Theo's gorgeous face looked like something he wanted to slice in half.
The thought of storming to Gryffindor to confront Potter kept recurring, so Draco kept flying higher and faster, pushing the school broom to capacity with this small body so light the speed streamlined almost all his frame to the broom itself, making it like he was a single hurtling particle, he and the broom one being in flight, trying to outrun something. But once he traced the pitch around a dozen times, the sting of the night air pelting against his face became more painful than exhilarating, and after all, there was nothing he was actually running from.
Hermione told him that without any sign of Scabbers for weeks, they had to consider the prospect he had completely fled Hogwarts. And with that came the prospect they would simply
The Harry dot spent most of its time in Gryffindor Tower, the Great Hall, or outside, often at Hagrid's Hut. Ron came by on the first with stories of Hagrid going on a secret trip for Dumbledore. Draco sent a note asking for information about that from Harry. He got no response, which he'd been expecting at this point, along with uncomfortable answers from their friends that Harry was "going through something" and "needed some time."
"To business, Harry," said Riddle, still smiling broadly. "Twice- in your past, in my future- we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk," he added softly, "The longer your friends stay alive."
which way in my head. If Aberforth doesn't know, I can see why this would haunt him. Even for his whole life."
Draco climbed down, not looking back, and handed Wormtail the vial and the knife back. Wormtail poured the vial into the cauldron, which turned a brilliant white. There it was, the pearly white of the serpentine man-sized form that Draco had been expecting, that he pictured the red pulp morphing into. But he didn't have the chance to watch, as Wormtail had fallen beside the cauldron. He was holding his stump as if that could cure it, and called out, "Malfoy! Help me! The pain..."
"The Pic de L'Infern," Draco answered automatically, remembering the article. "It's in the Pyrenees. The Spanish Pyrenees," he added, at the bound and tired Karkaroff's face of growing despair. He seemed unwilling to ask any of the obvious questions, beginning with,
"Of course, young gentleman," said Periander, with a half-grimacing flash of the unnaturally whitest teeth that Draco had ever seen, and pulled out his wand, gesturing for Draco to do the same. "No need to be nervous. The procedure is simple, and will take less than half an hour. Mr. Malfoy, these cellars are secure and reinforced?" Father nodded tightly, seeming disinclined to spend any more time than necessary with this odd assessor, which he was suffering through for Draco's sake. "We will begin with a test of your raw magical power. Mr. Malfoy, you may wish to stand back."
It was all whirling through Draco's head, the ways this could have been averted, the times he should have forced his way back into Theo's life, to talk, to scream, to hurt, to beg if necessary, to avert this. Anything and everything he could have done that he hadn't. "It was you- Periander and Maledictum's grave."
Dean and Seamus looked scandalized. "Wow, Luna, that's dirty," Dean laughed. "And Neville said you're a
The wand purred in his hand at her closeness, ready to start letting out those inexplicable waves it always had waiting right at the surface of inky shadow. The talon in the wand seemed to bend further in the air towards her. The air itself bent to her, reshaping into a tunnel from the bent shape of her laughter, the sharpness stabbing at the fabric of the air and rending it with invisible cut after cut like shards that broke and did not break on the surface of a mirror.
"I hope you're not in danger," Theo said, and reached for Draco's hand before he seemed to think better of it. There was some indefinable emotion in his dark blue eyes in the firelight, something he was trying to keep out of them.
this. "I KNOW!" he yelled, loud enough for their pursuers to be sure they were on the right track, and indeed there were answering cries. "I'm counting on it!"
Was it not common knowledge around the school that Draco and Harry were an item? Was it just some of the DA members or sixth-years who knew? Because this level of ogling at Draco's boyfriend would have been unacceptable from even Myrtle, let alone underclassmen who Draco would have been happy to curse off their brooms to improve Hogwarts' future OWL averages. And it made his skin crawl every time he saw Harry and Ginny so much as speak to each other down there in their fetching, crisp Quidditch uniforms, knowing this the year the two became involved in the blue loop. Draco was ridiculous, he knew, mocking Harry's jealousy, when the mere sight of Ginny filled him with unspeakable impotent rage. But it remained that the more important Harry became to his continued sanity, the more intolerable he found the presence of what he still had to consider his one most significant rival.
But none of that happened. Theo drew out his wand and began to cast spells, beginning with the ineffective Alohomora. He seemed to do it just to check it off a list, and proceeded to cast a series of unlocking and forced entry spells. It seemed he had another place he wanted to break into, which was proving more difficult than the storeroom. Relief at the reprieve from an expected betrayal by Severus was replaced by protectiveness over him. Stealing from Draco's godfather was the
"Uncomfortable, Mr. Malfoy?" Severus asked, rising to his feet to necessitate Draco doing the same. "Take it as a lesson for you in your
"Well," Draco said, "Now I have an idea what to get you for Christmas, your hands are like a Dementor's." That made Potter pout over at him very severely as they came up to Hogsmeade. It was a pity in a way that there would be no Sirius in dog form waiting to greet him, or slap high five with his paw with Luna and Hermione. But Draco knew him safer, off wherever he and Remus had spirited themselves. "What, Potter, if you're so self-conscious with your increased notoriety-"
Dobby frowned up at Draco with a confusion rather rich from someone Saint Potter had convinced the world was a martyr. "Dobby is not understanding Master Draco, sir."
"I'm so pleased I didn't choose Arithmancy as an elective," Luna agreed. "We've been listening for ten minutes, waiting for it to be over, and I feel we've aged years."
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said, "Has brought us this diary, originally belonging to one Ginevra Weasley. He insisted we send for you as well. Severus, do you know anything about this?" He passed the diary to Severus, who got a more guarded look once he read the first page. And then he turned back to stare down at Draco as he handed it to Dumbledore, looking so disappointed in him that Draco cursed the Gryffindors for stopping him from bringing it to Severus first, and avoiding all this mess.
It was an unexpected temptation that seized Draco, though, as he regarded the sprawling tree, and not the one he would have expected, the coward's temptation to abandon months of work and research, and leave off entirely. No, he
When Phineas Apparated outside Dantanian's rooms, Dantanian waiting at the door. He had on black everything, robes, cloak, gloves, boots, and hood, though Phineas pushed Dantanian's hood back to kiss him. Dantanian turned his face away.
"I saw him at the match," Black said slowly, "In the Gryffindor section. But I thought he was just there to watch Harry. Like me." There it was on his face again, that embarrassing paternal fondness. "Remus- he won't believe me without proof, it looks too bad for me, he'd never believe I changed the Secret Keeper and didn't
Each kiss subtracted rather than added. The more he got the more he wanted, less and less satisfied until Harry took control of the kiss again, resuming his clumsy forceful pressure downwards. He was pulling unrepentantly at Draco's hair now, using it to drag Draco's face up into each individual kiss. The feeling of Draco's wrists bound above his head made him feel deliriously helpless to it, like Harry could kiss him forever if he wanted and there was nothing he could do to stop him. Harry's weight felt like heaven on top of him, like pressure on his lungs was the thing he had needed to breathe properly again, the strong muscular length of his legs entwining with Draco's as they began to make out in earnest. Harry did prove a quick study, mimicking the speed and then the motion of Draco's mouth on his. "You're so good at this," Harry kept saying incoherently, or, "I love kissing you," and then finally, "God, Draco, you're gorgeous."
"How many times do I have to tell you-" Harry began, and then gave up and just gave him a firm series of pecks, each one pressing their bodies closer together.
He realized he sounded like Severus, whom Black had already seemed in danger of recognizing in Draco. Though if Black didn't even know his old school friend was teaching at Hogwarts this year, Draco doubted he could guess Severus was Draco's godfather. Maybe he thought Severus had just been at the match to watch as well.
Draco dove beneath the rearing centaur, and her whip descended where he had been a second earlier. He tried to cast on himself, knowing he should be able to use the simple blanket counter-curse against his own Langlock spell, but he had never been any better at wordless magic than wandless magic...
"Oh," Potter said, with what looked like a tinge of jealousy adding to the green of those eyes. It figured. Poor, poor parentless Potter. "Is it really a bad wand? Because it's crooked? Can I see it?"
"That boy," Grindelwald said hazily. "That boy, what was his name, the boy who killed me? He cannot have been the one. Not him to kill me, no."
"You'd think they'd make an exception," Luna said cheerfully. "With the darkest wizard in history on your tail, Harry, you think they'd be willing to fudge a few dates to give you the right to Apparate away from him."
"I should have known." Severus pinched his forehead, before rubbing his weak eyes, face sallower than ever. He truly looked exceptionally worn-down. Draco's mind went to what Bellatrix and Voldemort must have done to him. It put a choking sensation at the bottom of his throat that threatened to draw tears again. He tried to just push the images away.
"So this is the godfather," Grindelwald observed softly, and Draco shot him a death glare every bit as vehement as the one he had been leveling impotently at Aunt Bella. It also helped him avoid meeting his mother's eyes.
"That's right! She ran away and abandoned me in the dark, like a proper Slytherin! That doubt, that won't touch us! And so what if the rest of Slytherin wants us to lose? Do you know whose own
"Give me your wand," Periander ordered, following him, and Draco just laughed derisively. "Give me the grave dirt. Where are you going?"
He dedicated the length of the game to studying in the library, finishing off every essay he had due before Christmas, including ones he hadn't yet technically been assigned in this timeline. He couldn't believe how empty the library was- you'd at least have thought there'd be some Ravenclaws poking about- which added to a surreal sense of isolation, traveled again in time without knowing but to a future where Hogwarts was a preserved ghost town, the only being alive in the world himself- not a ghost town, though, because even the Hogwarts ghosts were gone.
"I just want to capture the look of the snow with the light like this," Astarte called from her wooden bench, where she was bent mixing a number of paints with gentle frustration on her face. "I can't seem to get the right color."
to cursing. Really, Uncle Sirius, just because you've been on the run for so long, it isn't an excuse to be
Potter was relatively quiet, which made it easier to try and ignore him just sitting there with that face, as if it was alright, like Draco didn't already have a hard enough life, without that face to try and fail not to stare at... at least until Ron and Hermione made what was obviously a prearranged early exit. Their vague excuses of Lavender Brown needing a hand with something were barely uttered before Potter took Draco into the Defense stacks. The first flash of his green eyes in the shadow of the tomes above them made Draco remember the way the light had poured out from his wand over the bleeding snake...
"Hello, Mrs. Malfoy," Potter said, inserting himself forward with an outstretched hand. "You must be Draco's mother. I'm Harry Potter. I'm in his year at Hogwarts."
They did not seem used to this level of confidence from him. "How can you be so sure?" the Keeper Waldsmidt called. "Pierre Ginaud is the best Seeker in the world! Yeah, maybe you beat him to the Snitch once, but how are you so sure you can do it twice-"
"It was from Ollivander's," Draco said tightly. He could feel the trio watching him intently along with the professors, as if something dark was about to come careening uncontrollably out of him.
"But you did have a run-in," Remus prompted. "We don't have to discuss this now if you're too tired from your trip. But I have wanted to gauge whether you still feel safe at Hogwarts. I am prepared to speak to Albus about having you leave Hogwarts if necessary-"
Harry laughed when Draco's sweaty fingers were inept for once, and ripped off Harry's buttons instead of undoing them. "Who's the brute now? What... God, what is
, but I can't lie to myself anymore..." His lips came forward and pressed a clumsy kiss to Draco's forehead, then the side of his head, nuzzling into his hair not unlike Harry always did, although the alcohol on his breath was the strongest scent. Something wary squirmed in Draco's stomach. "Are you really gay like you've always said?"
It was more dangerous-looking here in the thick of it than it had been from his old vantage point, watching superiorly from the woods.
"I'm not going to follow your orders," Dantanian said softly, "Ever again." Then he strode towards the Black children, laughing. The sound cut the night like a razor. "What do you think, Finn?" Both father and son looked up at the name. "Should I tell them who I am? Should I tell them who their father is, before I pick who dies?"
As he had in third year, when Severus sent the Aurors after him, when he laid the trap in his quarters for Sirius and Stunned Draco, and why after that was Draco still surprised? Why had he let all that happen and forgiven Severus without so much as an apology, why did he never
"Now you're telling me," Draco muttered. More memories of Theo were clogging him, as words came that he wished had somehow been put in his mother's mouth, so many years ago.
As the first Christmas with Aunt Bella officially at large, reminders of her favorite holiday were less untainted. But mistletoe was the worst part, even if he didn't have any attempts to catch him by Pansy to avoid. Harry was the only one who tried it. Most people tended to jump to the other side of the hallway, at times plastering themselves to walls, to avoid Draco. Harry was popular again, vindicated in the press. Even the one specter, possibly having killed Pettigrew, seemed to have been retrospectively applied to Hogwarts's celebrity murderer, Harry's boyfriend.
Draco approached the cauldron with its lighter pearly gold contents, set a bit apart from the others because of its strong smell, and finally let the whiff of Amortentia hit his nose. He remembered it smelled differently based on what attracted you. He could smell a confusing array of aromas, with broomsticks, fresh-cut grass, sweat, a cheap-smelling Muggle shampoo, and a sharpness of powerful magic palpable in the air, so strong it was not just a feeling there but a scent-
"Do not take it as a personal favor, Mr. Malfoy. I am, if it failed to cross your mind, the Head of Slytherin House, with a team due to play Gryffindor in less than two days' time. Whose Seeker, as it seems, has taken it upon himself to burn himself alive with Fiendfyre sooner than have to face
"Professor Dumbledore and I went to-" Harry lowered his voice to speak right into Draco's ear. "We went to search for one of the Horcruxes, I have it, but- when we got back, we saw the Dark Mark- we flew back on brooms, to the Astronomy Tower- he told me he needed Professor Snape. He said to run and get him, without fail, so I did. I ran and I found your godfather, and we ran back, but when we got there, Professor Dumbledore was- like he is now. Because I abandoned him."
"I'll go talk to him," Hermione sighed, and held out her bracelet for him to flick the H charm reassuringly. "Don't worry, Draco. He's just being an idiot boy. He'll come to his senses, and the professors obviously won't let Harry
at this thing and he was ready to throw all his plans away, and start wildly casting every spell he knew, like at the Mirror of Erised. Much as with that, he hardly expected much to happen if he did, other than laying waste to the room and furniture around, while leaving the target untouched.
He considered performing voodoo on it. But ultimately, that seemed like too much work, so he just balled it up and slept with it under his pillow.
Draco wanted to ask, but he couldn't give away his knowledge. Either Karkaroff was working with Crouch, or else Karkaroff had no idea, and letting him know might make him run for the hills. So he just played up the dark wizard in him, tossing Karkaroff's wand up and down in the air while keeping the talon wand pointed right at him. "I would find it prudent at this juncture to remind you, for
Scrimgeour Disapparated without Percy. Not without a frazzled little speech, though, indicating that he hoped they could forget all of what had happened today, that he certainly would- read, no Aurors would be coming after Ron- and he solemnly wished them a Happy Christmas.
"No," Draco said, "Not hardly," and reached into his pocket, before turning his body towards Harry's. "Here, turn towards me. I don't want anyone else to see."
It thudded through the Burrow, making the very walls shake to their foundations. Thankfully, the place did not fall apart over their heads. But it felt a close thing.
"I wanted to be an Unspeakable once," Draco said honestly, because he had. In the blue line, not even the blue loop, when he'd been only ten. It had been a phase, and he'd grown out of it, because his father had made him. It didn't seem like that had been the same person as the one who lived in his head now. "I guess I just... I don't know, I lost interest in it."
. No one else was likely awake. There were empty rooms at Grimmauld. He could take Harry down to one and kiss him again, like what had only been hours ago, even if it felt much longer. He could do more, if Harry wanted, and he had the feeling that yes, Harry would-
A horrible stench filled the hall as black filth dripped out from the underside of the snakes, which fell onto the ground with an acid touch, and seemed to sear at the skin of the Death Eaters, who began to scream their heads off. "What is this?" Goyle exclaimed, panicked, while Greyback growled and vowed he'd have Draco's head for this, before a coil snuck around his neck and made any more speech impossible. His eyes rolled back in his head, bulging, tongue hanging out of his mouth.
," he said miserably, and Draco arched an eyebrow. "Fine, fine," Harry sighed, but his eyes ate up every inch of Draco's body he could see, before Draco pulled his robes back on over his uniform.
have the answer, Mr. Wright, by all means. Answer one of my last nagging curiosities- if there was some opportunity here I missed- and I will tell you everything I found and everything I did because of what I found in Dantanian's box."
Draco hadn't seen her since his mother disowned him. He hoped she wouldn't feel compelled to make some gesture. But thankfully, she treated him the same. Her attention was taken up by Fleur Delacour, who had made her move and attached herself to Bill Weasley. Her mere presence seemed to be driving Ginny and Mrs. Weasley mad.
But Draco was not about to give them the chance to change their minds. "I want to do it," he said brusquely, shoving them back after a long moment. "Let's fill out the forms."
It was true. There would be little time there for sentimental tours of the childhood home, which Draco had already taken part in, within Harry's head.
Dantanian walked into the gardens, out from under the terrace gardens and into the further ground ones, past roses of every color, including gold. They were as well well-kept under Selene Malfoy as Narcissa Malfoy, nearly identical, except for the flowers that Dantanian trampled, cutting through swaths of them without bothering to light the end of his wand or call up any flame. He did not seem to have any particular direction, unless it was the hill that hung high above Malfoy Manor overlooking it, or else just
"Oh, you don't want to know how to hold off twenty stunning spells at once like I did? That was a shield, Harry, in case that escaped your notice-"
Neville laughed nervously before seeming to realize Draco meant it. Then, in an unexpected shock of warmth, Draco felt Neville's arm go around his shoulder. "You should," said Neville softly. "We need you, you know. I need you. All of us do. Harry most of all."
Draco began that night's Quidditch practice reenergized, as much by defiance as anything else. He had spent a great deal of time poring through the German Quidditch plays, and come up with a radical tactical program for Slytherin. In the blue loop, fifth year's strategy had been dominated by dogging Gryffindor practices, cursing their players in the halls, and dirty play during the actual match. They had lost the match, and had the worst Quidditch season Draco had ever played, losing not just to Gryffindor but Hufflepuff, even though Draco had caught the Snitch in the latter match. If he wanted to change the past in this, he needed a new strategy, a very Slytherin one still: not merely ruthlessness, but cunning.
Draco closed his eyes, imagining the Kingsnakes in this position, about to take on Paris- because in truth, the gap between Kingsnakes and Groundhogs
"Don't you see?" Draco hissed, waving his arms excitedly at a Hermione who looked more inclined to start sobbing over her Herbology essay than listen to him decipher prophecies. "The dragon breathes fire, the dog rises, the rat falls- I'm the dragon, Uncle Sirius is the dog, Pettigrew is the rat, and Lupin is the wolf. It's all so obvious. She saw that
Sirius, Hermione, and Harry all turned to Draco with similar baffled expressions, as if hearing him described as
"Do you not want to tell us what happened?" Potter breathed, dismayed. "Whoever did this, we'll take them on..."
could learn it. If we're going to have a Rat Thieves practice, there will be no dark magic! That is a hard and fast rule."
He was glad he had succeeded when Harry came back and gave him a kiss for it. "Just wanted to say congratulations for being the cleverest ever," he said. Draco caught his hands and kept him from racing off. "Draco, they're waiting for us..."
"Um, thanks, Luna," Harry said, giving a genuine grin before turning to Draco. "Hey, Draco, I didn't get to see you after the game, you left too soon... I hope it's not too competitive for us to, er, hang out a bit anyway... I just wanted to know what you thought..."
Draco tried to struggle back from the command, but eventually his head bowed and pressed a kiss to the back of that bone-white hand. He felt he might be sick. Voldemort's smirk burned into his face as he straightened up, and then that smirk went lower.
The words died in Dumbledore's throat. As he read the rest of his own missive in silence, the blood and expression both drained from his florid affable face, until he seemed some ancient figure that a horrible sight had turned to stone upon the seeing. He froze completely. Draco had not anticipated just how shaken this would leave Dumbledore, a man he had never seen so much as ruffled by
The twins kept teasing Ginny about Corner, with Ron indignant in the background, and Harry watching with distant, vacant eyes. Eventually, they seemed to tire themselves out enough gossiping to doze off. Except for Harry.
"This is us, boys," said Mr. Weasley. They headed into a corridor that Draco had gotten all too familiar with post-Azkaban. "My office is on the other side of the floor."
And besides, he thought as he stomped away with gritted teeth, could he even trust his wand to do it properly? He was wary after what had happened with the tracking charm. He hadn't ever forgotten whose wand it initially was. But he had come to trust it nonetheless, the way he had his unicorn hair wand, like an extension of his right arm.
"I want you to understand how serious we are about this," Remus said, "And that we aren't just doing lip service to this possibility. Ultimately, Draco, it
Remus insisted on taking down the Christmas decorations promptly on New Year's Day, so to great grumbling, none the least from his new fianc√©, they were occupied most of the day in work that Kreacher should have theoretically been doing for them, if he could have been bothered. But he couldn't, so Draco didn't get a single moment alone with anyone, let alone Harry, until just before dinner. And that was with Hermione, who wanted to gently admonish him on the class implications of his constant complaints that
He had seen the Longbottoms huddled together, shooting spells in synchronization. He'd seen Sirius and Remus back-to-back, fighting for their lives- and the thought hit him then that today was the day Sirius was meant to die. He froze where he was submerged bleeding into the water, nearly getting himself hit by Bellatrix's yell of Crucio before he dodged away. He whirled to face her as she stalked gliding towards him like some malevolent spirit born from the water, with the fighting going on below them at a remove. She had clearly wanted to isolate him. "You're not having my wand!" Draco screamed, and she threw her arms in the air.
Not a bad question. "I don't know exactly. Probably nothing, because Severus destroyed the diary for good, I'm sure of it. With something called liquid Fiendfyre. It's not something I can think of any way to explain that
"Don't you have anything better to do," Draco gasped, "Than maul me, you..." His mind wasn't coming up with insults at its usual speed, especially when Harry started necking him again. "You... don't you want to, ah, your new room- and we should- ah- practice, um, Occlumency sometimes...
So it was time for exams, while they waited for someone to try to steal the Stone and bring Voldemort back. Upon which, Potter had become fond of declaring to Draco, he would kill the Dark Lord again, and then Draco would see who was
"Oh, alright," Hermione said, and left them alone. When it was just them, Draco found himself the object of the most discomfiting stare he had yet received in the red line.
Hermione hastily changed the subject, telling stories about the Slug Club dinners that Harry had been missing for his lessons. Ron did not seem to enjoy her mentioning McLaggen, which Draco filed away as interesting. He put on his protective goggles, lamenting time travel if it made him have to deal not once but twice with these useless Snargaluff monstrosities, and got to work.
Draco's reflexes sent him hurtling after Higgs before he realized the other boy was moving. He caught up just as the Snitch came into view in front of the east stand, gold against gold dropping down. They went into a dive at about the same time, with Higgs swaying in his direction, elbowing him so hard it nearly shoved him off his broom. But he had been there as Flint personally taught all the dirty tricks he knew. He flattened his body to the broom, with a roll a full circle around in the air instead, gold still before him. The elbow was only added momentum as he careened down past Higgs, whom Draco's barrel roll had blocked from finishing his dive. Draco caught the Snitch glove with an ease that almost made him doubt it had really happened.
Potter pulled him aside, face still flushed, and Draco drank in the sight of those green eyes fixed on his one more time. "You
It was, he had found, far easier to have Harry as an enemy than Ron. Harry, he could glare at across the Great Hall without flinching, shooting ominously superior stares, like he knew something he didn't. But when he saw his posing and posturing had been caught by Ron, and just made him hunch over the red and gold-emblazoned table even more like a turtle into its shell, he had to stop. His conscience, the Hermione-voice, had made him stop, while the Severus-voice told him to stop being such a bloody Hufflepuff. He couldn't afford to be so damn soft now.
"I'm not under the Imperius curse," Draco said mechanically. It sounded so transparently forced then that all the Death Eaters laughed at Father, Wormtail with them.
Draco sat back, gaze jerking away. There was another eye just as wild as his: Crouch's, where he was stood in the doorway of the classroom, for who knew how long.
"Get them!" Bellatrix shrieked, the de facto commander with Father missing. And Father wasn't the only one absent. Draco expected his knees to falter beneath him, the way they always did at the sight of his Boggart. But the real Bellatrix did not have the same fear for him, he found. Not after what he had just done to his father. He was less frightened of her than of what she might do to Luna, to the Longbottoms, to Sirius, if he didn't turn her towards him first-
"Fine, fine," Draco sighed, though he'd been hoping that hobnobbing with the man would tend him towards a more charitable assessment. And this bird would prove an interesting anecdote for Hagrid, not that Father would listen to that consideration of Draco's with anything but a certain suppressed willingness to practice some Unforgivables himself. "Very well, Mr. Periander.
Harry's gaze didn't falter, though he let go of Draco's ankle, more out of seeming obligation than revulsion. His free hand fell into place beside Draco's face too. "I don't believe you." Harry fixed their gazes together, as if that could assert his will on Draco, and not just his beauty with that sight. "You want me to think you're too dangerous to be any good for me. What, first your excuse is that you're not good enough, now it's that you're too
Draco rolled his eyes but let Harry keep them on. "You like the necklace, huh?" Draco teased. "You like it when that's all I have on me?" Harry nodded raptly. Draco looked down at his own body, unabashed, and had hardly ever felt more graceful, like he had turned into a dragon more than a year early. Harry's fingers reached out and traced the dragon birthmark. Draco obligingly tilted his head, baring his whole neck and shoulder.
"And it will never happen again," Draco said loftily, before turning to Ron for a distraction. "What about you, Ron? Any accolades to claim from my defense? What was your contribution?"
"Here," Dantanian said curtly, "Is what you need to know." He looked down at the boys with disdain at their weakness. They seemed mere extensions of Phineas to him. "My name is Dantanian Noir. My mother's name was Astarte Noir. She was a painter. She was perfect. Phineas Nigellus Black had her killed." Phineas didn't bother trying to object. Even the muted sounds from the boys were softer. "He took her from me. I had no one else. So, an eye for an eye. I'm going to take from Phineas Black what he loves most in the worst way I know."
Draco smirked, then stuck his head out from behind the statue. "Striker, I'm going to be late to Arithmancy!" he called cheekily before Harry dragged him back, hands sliding down to Draco's hips. Draco wound his arms around Harry's neck and kissed him back thoroughly, licking Harry's mouth open. "Mmm... let's see, have you
"This is my castle!" Grindelwald screamed at the top of his lungs, laughing in exhilaration, his bleeding red arm still lofted as high as the left as the flames arched into a semi-circle. He turned with the magisterial flourish of a conductor and finished a circle around them that looked geometrically perfect even under the circumstances.
"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said Potter, "About what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy-"
, though," Dantanian said ferociously. "Don't I." He undid his braid, leaving it a mass of curls around his face, wet and dark as the smoke of Dementors dying. "DON'T I?"
Draco had wanted to stay out of the dragon business. But surely name-based grounds of interference were negligible enough, and wouldn't set anything in the blue loop off course. He felt like a stranger to himself, as he voluntarily left the castle for a reason other than flying, tromping off to Hagrid's hut alone, with the feeling he was about to have at least one or two sharp-clawed creatures set on him at any moment. When he knocked on the door, Hagrid answered with a face that clearly expected Potter, only to fall when he just saw Draco standing there. "Hello, Draco," Hagrid said after a moment, masking his surprise. "The others righ' behind yeh?"
"Gilderoy," Sirius said through gritted teeth, looking to have about as much patience for the man as Severus did. "Can you do your apology tour later? I explained the situation. Now
"If he was corporeal," she gasped, "I would talk all the time about wanting to hold his hand or hug him. Just because I missed my father so much, and no one touched me back then. No one talked to me or even looked at me more than they had to, except to laugh at me. And I wanted to make friends, so badly, like Father told me to, but I didn't know
"Cyg-" Dantanian began, proud to recall the name, only to remember discretion and go on tiptoe to whisper in her ear, "Cygnus Black?"
"Draco, are you sure about this?" Hermione asked, anxiety bleeding through every pore. "I mean, are you actually, genuinely, fully sure that this is necessary? It shouldn't be too late to drop one or two..."
I envisioned Ron learning about sex slaves from those Mad Muggle comic books he reads. There is some crazy stuff in comic books lol... and speaking of which, the torn page thing is totally like Death Note :) That's one of my all-time favorite series, maybe that's an inspiration...
The handwriting looked to be in blood, as was traditional. But it was a small, elegant, sweeping cursive nonetheless, as understated and refined as the writer himself. The words were another story.
Draco leaned down and slapped him across that beautiful face he had kissed so many times, a hard enough blow to send him crashing back to the stone floor. "Don't presume to touch me, half-blood," he spat, and heard Bellatrix let out a disturbing cackle. Dolohov and a few others joined her.
The Christmas decorations were still up, with a few more added the morning of New Year's Eve. These included a banner Luna and Ron made that read, 1996: THE FINAL FRONTIER, with lots of wacky glittering stars and space decorations. Draco was going to ban Hermione from letting Luna consume any more Muggle pop culture. She already looked irredeemable, snuggled in her Nightmare on Elm Street hoodie, though Draco wasn't in any position to criticize.
"But I love playing Quidditch against you," Harry wheedled, green eyes brimming with sincerity as he leaned forward. "It's the best thing in the world. Draco, you can't give up. At least try, before stomping off to your godfather, okay? Promise me you'll try. And don't just go in screaming at your friends. You can charm them somehow, you're smarter than that- except, um, not the, uh, the way you said, not the bribery or the... uh, the... yeah."
Draco talked on and on and on. He talked about Severus, about dark magic, about the dueling lessons and casting Protego Diabolica and Harry walking through the fire. He told her about hearing that Sirius and Remus wanted to adopt Harry but couldn't, and why, and how he'd stopped teaching Harry Occlumency because he hadn't wanted to help them. He told her about the deals he'd made with his father in the summers to be able to visit her. He told her about using the Imperius curse in second-year to save him, Ron, and Harry in the Forbidden Forest from Aragog. He told her how he practiced Unforgivable curses on spiders. He told her how he'd feared for Harry being kidnapped, and made a potion stealing his blood with Luna as his helper, and then kept on talking, to divert from that utter horror at the Naufragiam. He told her he'd been in love with Harry since the first time he ever saw him. He threw out quickly about his father making him see Periander, and casting Avada Kedavra for the first time.
Not that Severus seemed moved or even convinced by this show of redemption. But others were. Public opinion seemed swayed so far in the direction of the nation's hero-turned-villain-turned-hero again, it might not be so difficult, to convince Scrimgeour of the efficacy of avoiding a public trial. And Severus proved a naturally receptive audience to the argument that if they left rebuilding Citadelle Xaphan to just Sirius and Remus, it would only be their corpses from deaths of old age that could be hidden from Voldemort there.
She began to sob, unrestrained, and Draco had never felt so guilty in his life, not even when he thought his intervention had earned Sirius the Dementor's Kiss. Because if he'd left it alone, this would have been Ginny Weasley and not her. And Ginny back then wouldn't have been half so alone, not just a little girl with an ancient monster- two ancient monsters.
"And the eclipse," Draco said eagerly, watching the moon be blotted from the sky, and the mountains turn more and more into mere silhouettes. "Is it really such a magical night, the lunar eclipse?" He enjoyed on a visceral level the sight of uneven blasted stone outlining the progressively more shadowed sphere of the moon, the dust of rubble beneath like he had only just begun the work of bringing castles down. "I have the branches."
, either. If you kiss another girl, Cannon, I will curse that mouth that kissed her off your face, do you hear me?" Ron touched his face and Draco rolled his eyes. "You honestly don't think I know how? It's called Oscausi. You want a demonstration?"
The Mirror of Erised sat before Dantanian in a great obsidian holding case, in a room full of moonstones. The only things in the vast room were shelves full of tomes and notebooks, the mirror and its backing, and those stones. Moonstones stretched along the floor, walls, and ceiling in an oval covering as far as the eye could see. There was no place not covered in their smooth shapes, none exactly identical although all roughly ovals.
He inched out past the snoring Perkins. He could replace the plaque completely, with ease if he used silver, but it would take forever to hand-carve new... and he had to be careful with charms cleaning or transfiguring existing bronze, to ensure it wouldn't lose the lettering anyway...
Draco turned to see the trio's reactions before the professors', and was gratified to see Potter and Hermione look blank. But Ron's face was a mask of horror. "Draco," he stammered. "Did you- did you say Bellatrix Lestrange?
She was just as hysterically loud and happy in his ear as she squealed, "You solved it! You solved it!" She shrieked the same to Ron and Potter as they came up, embracing them in turn, and when Draco saw the turquoise charm bracelet on her wrist, the sight of the H charm gave him a brief flash of disquiet, but in the end, Draco wasn't infallible. Anyone could mess up a tracking charm.
it. Draco never thought Voldemort would even entertain it, let alone go with it like he did. But maybe Father was more valuable than Voldemort let on, and killing him right then was not in his plans. Or it would be too much trouble, too much of a cloud on his big day when the main event was his resurrection and the death of Harry Potter. Maybe he wanted to take his time with Draco and Father at more leisure.
"Alright, fine, fine, you're forgiven, stop groveling-" Draco huffed, only to stop cold at the glistening white that was curling in out of the corner of his eye. "Salazar, Harry, look up!"
What drew attention the most, though, wasn't the Death Eaters immersed in a decidedly lopsided mass duel. It was the ones still pulling themselves out of what had gone from a H√∂llenpf√ºtze to a true lake now at the entrance to Nurmengard. Helpless to intervene, deprived of magic, it must be a salutary bit of education for them all. They were trying to help one another from the water or just sitting there glumly, watching the proceedings with sullen interest. In the latter group were Draco's parents. Neither they nor the active Death Eaters noticed Draco and Grindelwald's arrival, though you would think the magic-less ones would at least have kept a lookout. But no, Draco could do anything without being noticed at first, anything- another Killing curse hung on his lips for the frantic figure of Bellatrix, throwing up a shield to protect Theo from the gust of flame sent out by Harry, who had been crouched behind Severus with blood pouring from his head-
"Ah, yes," Severus sighed, eyeing him with infinite contempt. "Once again, the expertise of Draco Malfoy has risen to cast its light upon all the ignorant world-"
"What," Theo said tunelessly, the usual intelligence and calculation remaining on that handsome face, seen from up close. But it was suppressed, more veiled on his face than even the pain there, behind a thin veneer of impassivity. "Go on. Don't let me stop you. Go on bragging to your new friends about the day you killed my father."
So their Monday Rat Thieves dueling practice let out earlier than usual, with Draco on a mission. He was not virtuous enough to go to the library for the hard slog of research, though, especially as it would likely require access to the Restricted Section that he'd have to beg off of Slughorn. His steps took him naturally to the dungeons, to try Severus first. He'd just been there yesterday for their weekly check-in. Severus would likely grumble, but even he had to concede that seeing his godson a bit more than allowed was worth it, if it taught his godson's friends how to, say, put his bones back in his body, should an Ossius dispersimus ever miss the dummy.
So Draco was stuck skulking up to McGonagall's office after Ancient Runes, saying goodbye to his mocking fellow Slytherins and acting the Gryffindor after all. From what Neville whispered to him, passing him on his way in, Umbridge had been there to sit in on McGonagall's meeting with Harry before Neville, and there had been an almighty row before Neville could get in, that had been audible all the way down the hall. But McGonagall seemed more than crisp and composed enough to be imposing nonetheless. Draco perched politely on the chair before her desk, very much wishing he had never admitted he was lying about wanting to be an Unspeakable.
control or influence over you, the way he may have at one time over Bellatrix Lestrange. There are many superficial similarities between him and you, yes, but the only ones that seem surely through
"Yeah," Bluthers said, looking satisfied by the chance to show off his expertise. "Some might miss this, but me, never. See, there's more unregistered Animagi running about than you'd think."
"You see why I didn't want any of you to have to read that?" Draco said wryly, once Hermione had lowered his father's letter about Bellatrix, voice going quiet. "Now I've ruined Dobby's birthday party."
Draco had learned about Higgs's flight style and habits from up close the first two go's, as well as from watching him in the games during his own first year, not once but twice. The fact that he was good-looking just meant that Draco had watched him all the more closely. Between the blows Higgs had taken from the Bludgers, that growing body of data on his opponent, and the fact that Higgs was starting to lose his head, Draco had it all plotted before Flint even let the Snitch go.
"Herbivicus!" he kept casting, using the vines like ropes, as he had in his assessment with Periander. As relatively weak as his earth magic was, Harry hadn't expected it, and it slackened his grip on his wand enough for Draco to easily disarm him, before tightening the thornless roses even more around Harry's body. Where, Draco had to admit in the not-so-bloodthirsty part of his mind, Harry did make quite a picture, tied up in rubble, trapped in a thicket of white roses.
"Alright, stalker, nice party trick. Go study," Draco said by way of goodbye, and got himself pushed down onto one of the green bean bag chairs by a laughing Harry.
Draco put together the rest of it in pieces from different people: once the others had returned to Xaphan and found no one there, they realized they must have been had, and any Death Eater threat must be at Nurmengard itself. They had wanted to go right to Nurmengard, to charge into whatever awaited come hell or high water, but they couldn't without Dobby. So Hermione had Apparated all the way back to Hogwarts, stopping in the empty back lot of Highbury on her way, and rushed to Dumbledore's office to tell him everything. Understandable, under the circumstances. Despite her anxious whimpers, he didn't begrudge her the choice.
The two-way mirror had not done justice to how much Black had been deteriorating in the time since he and Draco had met face to face, beyond his apparent newfound fandom of the Quibbler. Black's hair was closer to his elbows now, his emaciation more advanced despite the food Dobby had been giving Hermione and Luna to sneak him, his teeth yellow, eyes dark hollows, the concave bumps of his chest like another spine, decorated with those striking tattoos. He could not have looked more like a dangerous dark wizard if he had been actively trying. Yet somehow, even after just having seen her face that day, Draco could not see a shred of resemblance between him and Aunt Bella anymore.
can't let you fall in the hands of the Death Eaters like that. I'd have to have Gilderoy Obliviate our entire meeting away from you. You'd be on the run disarmed, undisguised, and hunted with new verve again, not even knowing why..."
, you gormless lackwit," Draco groaned, submerging his head under the bath to fortify himself with that reassuring smell, before having to face the depths of idiocy right there on his undeserving settee. "Did you not listen to me last night, when I told you that it was
He made it to the hospital wing in record time, taking the stairs two at once, cursing at his wand in English and French with the worst words he knew, though it was probably his own damn mistake, trusting Hermione's fondness for the bracelet he gave her. The charm must have fallen off and lodged there sometime. It was nothing and no one's fault but Draco's that Hermione would be as rigid as the turquoise stone when he found her, if he was
"Trust this dramatic boy," Severus sighed, taking a seat beside him, "To have one of his respiratory fits when his
He gave his suggestion with the air of a child innocently presenting a stranger a lit grenade. But Severus seemed, wonder of wonders, to think about it. "Letting him spend a month in bed was not space enough?"
"No," Theo said, and prodded at his side with his foot. With difficulty, Draco roused himself to a sitting position. "
"You know," Luna told Draco at the end of the week, as he walked her back to Ravenclaw Tower. He had a great number of scowls ready for her housemates. "I think Professor Lupin is the best Defense teacher we've ever had, don't you?"
"Everyone has," Ron said, sitting on the ground with a grin. "It's bloody brilliant. I always said the old blowhard was a fraud."
Gilderoy looked impatient, a more understandable affectation when their arrival had seen his hands already covered in dirt and grime from labor. Save his Ravenclaw-blue furs, which Draco had gotten charmed impervious. It was quite a strange contrast, his lavish garb and his filthy hands. If not as strange as with the Potions master currently eviscerating him with his glowering dark eyes.
"This can't be real," Blaise said, eyes not just full of terror but reevaluation, like he had placed Draco in one category and now had to find him another.
either. Fair point, but it wasn't like any of the Gryffindors knew what Langlock was enough to prove it.
Dantanian was amongst the students, staring at the floating candles in awe. He was by himself, though surrounded by knots of chattering children, dressed in robes with his long hair pulled back with a black velvet ribbon. His hand went into his pocket- he seemed to be nervously feeling at his new wand, to check it was still there- and he stared at the ceiling until a voice forced him to stop.
Ron sniggered, while Luna nodded in agreement. "Hey!" Draco protested. "I am at Potions, okay? Severus told me about it when he gave me a tour of his storerooms."
Draco drove his nails into his thighs as hard as he could under the desk, trying not to react, not to give the imposter the satisfaction. "They were driven mad. They're still in St. Mungo's."
Granger leaned in to whisper as she eyed him curiously. "Have you ever been on a broom before, Draco?"
Draco had his mouth open for a smart comment. But Myrtle cleared her throat, liable to burst into tears at any moment, along with her eponymous moaning. "Tactless!" she exclaimed, and got angrier at their blank looks. "Talking about breathing in front of me!" she said with an ill-portending rising hysteria. "When I can't... when I haven't... not for ages..." She buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly.
Dantanian looked as paralyzed as Dorian had when he offered himself to him. As glorious as the citadel was, in this much lesser a state of decay, there was a fascination in his eyes disproportionate to it there, like he saw something in the citadel that neither Phineas, nor anyone viewing the memory, could see.
." He was a bit amused and a bit appalled that she seemed to have picked up his manner of referring to their classmates. "And I do need to speak with you. Draco, I can't accept this."
They just missed Peeves going past, and a few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor- and the door was already ajar. "Well, there you are," Potter said quietly. "Snape's already got past Fluffy."
The Weasley twins pulled them towards the wood, and underage statutes or not, Draco dearly hoped they and the others had their wands on them as well. There were no lanterns in the woods, and when Hermione got sick of them blundering around in the darkness, she cast Lumos. Draco followed suit, and they found Ron fallen over a tree-root. The d√©j√† vu hit him in this place of new wariness, afraid not for himself but for them. It hardly helped matters that he was not fully dressed and prepared this time, but running about in pink satin pajamas. While the twins hauled Ron up, Draco took the pause to get his hair out of his eyes, making a useless attempt to fix it with one hand while keeping his lit wand raised for the others.
Both Weasley and the other boy in the boat reacted. "Malfoy?" Weasley echoed, and just like last time, a small chortle escaped from his ginger throat. Draco remembered the Weasel laughing last time, but he couldn't remember the comeback he must have given to such disrespect. All he could think was,
"Professor Lupin once said he didn't think I could learn that," Draco said quietly. "I thought that was why. I was so mad. But I guess he was right."
He headed down the stairs with no intention of seeing anything remotely as upsetting as that. He wanted nothing more exciting than more hot cocoa, preferably spiced like Severus's. But he ran into people, sending him stumbling into the railing and prompting a stern female voice to complain, "Oh, Neville, you can't be clumsy on the stairs, someone will get
Harry argued, quite correctly, that Draco could not only could help keep him calm, but already happened to have been to the Ministry, knew many of the names involved, and was a fair hand in a fight if it came to that. Draco worked hard to prove that last point in the practice duel that followed, and it was only one of those last-minute changes to Animagus form that gave Sirius victory.
Draco looked down at the water, embarrassed to be spoken to in so kind a tone, even if it was only for his likeness to Hagrid's actual friend. "I just want everything to come off smoothly. I don't want anything on fire." He remembered Aunt Bella setting Hagrid's hut on fire, after Draco let her into Hogwarts. He fought off a wave of nausea, trying to push the thought away before dwelling on it could make it hard to breathe. "I don't want to see your hut or the castle burn."
When Draco rolled back up, leaping to his feet with only a few swaying steps, Arthur Weasley had to call out, with the reluctance but amusement of the gracious loser, "Draco Malfoy catches the Snitch! Team Black is victorious, 270 to 60!"
Hermione stepped forward. "Professor Karkaroff, we need to know everything we can about Pammaque Periander. We're going to question you about that. I'll try to start at the beginning." It was sweet, to see Karkaroff have no choice but to listen to Hermione talk all she wanted, and answer obediently to her every question. This, the so-called 'ugly Mudblood' Karkaroff had scoffed disgusted at for having roused the interest of Viktor Krum.
Draco headed for the common room door, and made it out past the Fat Lady without being touched. He thought somehow against expectation that the Gryffindors would have listened and left it at that, but he had been dreaming. Not that this was the way he would have chosen to do this, if he'd planned it at all.
Draco's first thought when he woke was surprise he didn't feel any hangover, though the headache or nausea might swarm in as soon as he stood up. His second thought was that he hoped his mother didn't realize he'd passed out in their cellars. Beyond how unseemly it was, he had rather hoped their days of people sleeping rough down here were at an end.
On the Saturday before the First Task, it came time for the long-awaited Hogsmeade visit. Draco realized belatedly what a jackass he'd been, promising to spend the day with just Potter when it was Luna's first Hogsmeade weekend. When he told her and Hermione, though, they both urged him to 'have fun with Harry' with inconsiderate giggles, even after he insisted it was
"It gives me a bad feeling," Luna said quietly, "Him having a fit like that so close to the Third Task..." She exchanged a knowing glance with Draco, having heard the suspicions behind his decision to brew Naufragiam. "Like something is going to happen..."
Dantanian considered. "Alright, two questions, and then we really should get settled before the Sorting. One, Dorian, what proof do you believe you have?"
A greater weight oppressing Draco had to be given voice. "But- you said I would be your heir. Even if you adopt him? Shouldn't Harry be?"
Draco hugged Hermione's side, but she still looked cross. "Laugh at me if you want," she said, shooting daggers at Ron. "You're certain your godfather will accept E students?" Draco nodded. "It's not that I'm upset I'm not perfect. It's the subject I was worst in. Defense. Not ideal, is it?"
Meanwhile, Adrian Pucey nearly lost his seat, as one of the Weasley twins nailed him with a very much functional Bludger. Draco tried to focus on his Seeking, though, with a self-loathing snort towards his fellow Slytherins.
"You're trying to decide," Draco deadpanned, "Whether it would be creepy to kiss me while I'm still blindfolded."
"Hey," Harry said, coming over dressed in the same plain hoodie and jeans combination that Hermione and Luna were spouting, with nothing out of the ordinary in his manner to suggest it might happen to be Valentine's Day. Draco stared at him incredulously. "Everyone but Ron is here."
"Dantanian didn't know, but whatever it was, it's no surprise. Few adults ever look into that thing and see what they think they want to see, or else what they think they
Draco was barely looking where he walked even as they walked past rows of graves, nearly stumbling against a low grave marker he hadn't seen, and then a large clumped pile of dirt. Harry made a warning noise, trying to pull Draco back, and Draco dropped both bouquets of flowers into the open graves.
They reached the clearing where Hagrid had left Potter and Granger, and Potter and Granger nobly resisted the urge to laugh as Hagrid explained. "We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you boys were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' Draco." It was the groupings Draco had wanted, although he didn't understand them this time, until he heard Hagrid whisper to Potter, "Reckon Hermione's the only one who can keep Neville calm, yeah?" Draco found himself resenting this, after genuinely making an effort to calm Longbottom, but objectively, he supposed it hadn't worked.
"Draco Malfoy, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, George Weasley, Fred Weasley, Luna Lovegood, Hermione Granger, here to visit the office of Mr. Arthur Weasley," he lied all in one breath, and all seven badges came clinking out of the metal coin chute.
"Are you going to ask me to dance at all?" Padma asked Ron. Draco hadn't even noticed she was still there at the table. She might have actually liked Ron, to stick around this long.
"She remembered when the three of them faced Eros's grief over their Thanatos's death, and Estella's suggestion Eros travel into the past to see Thanatos again. So she proposed that the Resurrection Stone was not all that Death had said it was, like the Elder Wand had not been, like she already believed of the invisibility cloak. A Hallow was only a half-completion of their requests, but she could finish them with the other half- the easier half to make, a duplication of the Hallow with its own reflection. A phantom half like the dark side of the moon.
Except Luna did seem to know, more than she wanted to admit to herself. "I want to kiss him again. And... And I want to dance with him. I've regretted saying no to the Yule Ball so many times. Not that I didn't love going with you. But you should have gone with Harry. And I can just sit there imagining me and Neville waltzing. Neville's a good dancer..."
"Draco Malfoy must not go back to Lucius Malfoy!" Dobby exclaimed, hands waving in panic, his African turquoise watch catching the gold glow of the hanging lanterns. All of the joy from the pile of presents before him seemed to have dissipated, in face of the cold splash of reality that the letter had brought into the party. "Lucius Malfoy is not a good man! He will hurt Draco Malfoy! He will..." Dobby took a deep breath, eyes filling with tears. "He will punish Draco Malfoy too much! Draco Malfoy will not survive it!"
The Great Hall was nearly deserted, likely a fair bit before supper, but Dorian was indeed not showing the circumspection one might expect, as the heir to House Malfoy publicly speaking to a Muggleborn in those days. "Because I know something you don't know!" he singsonged again, more lilting and smug. "I know that Lamia is going to turn into a
It was annoying in a way. It had been kind of special for only Mother and Uncle Sirius to bear the mark of the talon wand.
"I do, Severus," Dumbledore said warningly, and Draco's spine bristled to hear anyone, even the great Albus Dumbledore, take that tone with his godfather.
"Maybe I'm a commoner then too," Draco retorted, and Theo shook his head, blue eyes practically glowing. The green tint to the flames made them look almost more like emeralds, like-
"Ron said that Draco often had respiratory fits, so not to worry, because he didn't pass out like Harry did- there was a Dementor in our compartment, but Professor Lupin cast a wolf spell and made it go-"
Dantanian considered. "Dragons are beautiful. Like that fake egg. Would Mr. Berfrid want to be close to his dragon, once it was all grown up?"
"I know that you don't want to hear this," Sirius was saying. "I know you wish I was dead. And I know it won't change anything, but I'm saying it anyway, because it's true. I'm sorry about what I did to you back at school." He took a deep breath, hands clenched to fists at his sides. His handsome face set with Gryffindor resolution. Draco could tell he was sincere, if only because of how hard this clearly was for him. "I'm sorry I sent you after Remus that night."
"I don't- I don't know," Millie said in a strangled voice. "The Dark Lord is going to take the school- they were evacuating the younger Slytherins- Pansy, do you think we should-"
"Who?" Draco asked, hoping against hope that Krum really overvalued their flying sessions together, or that Diggory was just the world's biggest masochist. "Which champion has to save me?"
Draco raced towards the bright plume of Luna's hair, but he saw Neville pulling her out, so he went towards Dobby instead, where Harry was trying to instruct him to go back to the kitchen, and not to punish himself. Even in the stampede around them, Draco felt a pang of warmth in his chest at Harry's goodness, always thinking of others' safety before his own. Hermione called for them to come, and Harry and Draco dragged Dobby out together, before letting him flee down the corridor. Harry ran towards the right, and Draco followed, only to fall back from a burst of light as someone yelled out, "Impedimenta!"
The first if not the second point seemed to come once they successfully made it to Honeydukes and then out of it into Hogsmeade, where they most definitely were not supposed to be outside of the appointed weekends, and she found out they weren't meeting Black here anyway.
Luna took him seriously, leaving him the Veritaserum before running off to investigate the amenities of the establishment. Hermione inspected the Veritaserum, finding it clear as water in its small vial, and looked troubled. Draco wasn't surprised, he found, that whether or not Severus had suspected or detected Luna's theft, he hadn't acted to stop it. He'd been giving Draco and Luna more dangerous potions for a few Christmases now- hard not to think of that with extreme nostalgia, however many parts of his past he could tell himself were just as dead as the Dark Mark that had once lived on his wrist. Not to mention, if he had yielded and answered Luna's questions about the dagger as easily as reported, he might be too guilty these days to deny them much of anything.
And the real Blaise would have told him where he could stick his mutant squirrel eggs, as if that was even a thing. But the imposter exchanged glances with Theo, before going, "Sure, mate," and hustling towards the stairs.
Draco didn't have an exam that afternoon, so he divided it between watching Karkaroff and Krum on the Marauder's Map, watching Harry, and trying to figure out what "surprise" would be a good vehicle to put a tracking charm on. It had to be something Harry would wear for sure. It made him think of ancient stories Mother would tell of champions in the more literal sense, knights who went into battle. Or into tournaments, as in this case, when they would wear the favor of a lady as luck for them in combat. He wondered what Harry would find an irresistible enough
Draco didn't emerge from the bathroom until near the end of the train ride, and his friends found him unusually pale and quiet. It was a surprise to find that even now, no one but him, Harry, and Luna could see the Thestrals, though he supposed none of the other Gryffindors had directly watched as he killed Nott. He held onto Harry's side tightly during the ride to the castle, still not saying much. "You're worried about your Sorting, aren't you?" Hermione said, and Draco found it truer than ever. He nodded, and Hermione stroked his hair.
He began to pull Draco up by the hand, but Draco didn't walk with him, giving him a severe look. Theo was tall again, more than half a head over him, but it didn't keep him from making Theo wilt with a mere look. "Aren't you forgetting something?" Theo looked blank. "You interrupted my conversation with my friend here. Aren't you going to introduce yourself and apologize?"
This time, the stones seemed to go up in smoke, an instant contraction from beautiful and luminous to joining the dark hissing morass already sliding in ribbons of red beneath them, joining the pool so quickly Draco shoved Harry back, out and away from the circle. Draco followed as quickly as he could, but he was still drenched in blood up to his knees, so much his robes and trousers were sodden and heavy with it.
Draco didn't go to dinner that night, and she promised to ask Dobby to bring him food in his dorm, though he was always nervous about letting her around house elves for fear she'd start up all that with SPEW in the red line as well. But Dobby came with no tales of Hermione-inspired insurrection boiling up in the kitchens, and proved to have made him his favorite homestyle mint mince pie. After they played two games of wizarding chess, both of which Draco was proud to see Dobby trounce him at, Draco thought he was going to be fine, and took a nap until Astronomy. The only problem was that for some bizarre reason, Astronomy happened to be taught at the Astronomy Tower.
Periander stumbled back as the statues began to come to life against him. It was like in the Fountain of Magical Brethren, except Draco felt more compunction destroying these sculptures, ruined as they were. Nor did he have the searing panicked fear of death he had against Bellatrix Lestrange, knowing Luna and Hermione would soon hear, and then it would be three against one- or at least he
Their little friend, whose neck was newly imperiled by a showy flourish of Greyback's. "No," Greyback said gloatingly, "We aren't. You don't want to see this child's blood cover the stones of Hogwarts. So I'll be taking your wands now."
thought it would work! Not for a second! I hadn't thought digging that stupid tunnel would work either! I never thought I could get myself
becoming a Death Eater had involved such rigorous training procedures last time. Mainly, it had just involved Aunt Bella casting the Cruciatus curse on him a lot. And demanding an extra-lavish Christmas present that year for her troubles. She'd always liked snow globes.
"What do you want to do?" Sirius asked bravely, ever the Gryffindor. "Should we find her? Try and break her out of Malfoy Manor and rescue her?" He indeed looked ready to launch onto an impromptu rescue mission at a moment's notice, as if he needed the same speech Hermione had given Draco after the bank robbery. Oh, yes, Dumbledore had been completely wrong to question Sirius's maturity.
is the head of House Black. I am its lord, the last living male descendent. Here is a wizarding photograph of the current Black family tapestry," he said, and produced a black folder with the Black family insignia on its front.
Theo had come to visit during lunchtime, carrying not just the food Dobby had packed, but a copy of the January 13th issue of the Daily Prophet with a picture of Aunt Bella on the front.
Draco took that as the vote of approval it was, from Theo's eyes wandering all over him, following as he left their dorm. But he himself was the one left gaping the second he left the entrance to the dungeons and saw what was there waiting. "Potter?" Draco cried out, loud enough for the entire common room to hear. He only just caught himself from stumbling back and falling over the step. "Salazar, you scared me! Why are you standing there?"
"Stand at my side, little one," Voldemort said calmly. Draco stared out bleakly at the sea of hooded, masked wizards, reflecting how in the blue loop, he had gotten one of those hooded robes, but never actually a mask. The easiest figure to pick out, despite being masked, was the stooped elderly figure of Theo's father, Cantankerous Nott. And near him, Draco could also immediately pick out the figure of Father, whose mask had remained in Malfoy Manor unused for so many years.
When he took his arms away, Draco could see the hole he had made was enough to bury three Maledictums. He must have been at it a long time, before he had gone to find Draco, and then returned to it. Draco could only feel grateful Periander had not appeared in the Three Broomsticks so covered in grave dirt. Surely his friends would have told him that part.
Umbridge tittered nervously, but Draco hoped few others could be untouched by the quiet dignity of the man before them, so raw and honest, and yet still so straight-backed and clear-eyed at the center of a hurricane, with a calm no evil could shake.
"You won't tell anyone, will you?" Draco asked suddenly. "That Hermione was the one with the idea for Luna- or what the Naufragiam is, what it does-"
circumstances. But when it came to castle reconstruction, Gilderoy had genuine expertise, and was no less ready to claim his prerogative over it than he had been his more illusory DADA credibility.
, and he really needed a better plan for the endgame than he'd thought up. He hadn't decided how much to follow the old timeline, and accept that Dumbledore's death was a condition perhaps necessary for Harry to defeat Voldemort- or admit he might have changed things enough that saving Dumbledore was paramount, in keeping their side strong enough to ever give Harry the chance now to-
"You can't dance, can you," Dorian observed within a few beats, "Should have let me lead," and Dantanian responded by taking Dorian by the waist and pulling him closer. Dorian stared at Dantanian with wild pale eyes, and none of the composure or style he'd had dancing with anyone else. Dantanian led Dorian about the floor in stilting steps, a circle of his choice. It was graceful enough, or at least Dantanian's grip was strong enough, that Dorian obeyed.

"Oh, that makes sense, he's just being a pervert," she sighed. "Wait- Dantanian, you aren't actually going to let him check, are you?"
Dantanian did not correct him. He ran a hand down the arch of his ribs, to trace the ridge of his cock where it stood against the flat plane of his pale stomach, aroused and gleaming wet in chandelier flamelight. "I've cast all the spells we'll need. And I'm ready. You could do it right now. It wouldn't take long." His lips pouted more deeply. "I thought- you'll be with anyone. So many Slytherins, and other houses- but you can't do me a favor and just do this-"
Draco looked over with a reluctant fondness to see Hermione in tears, and felt the impending defeat as something at least slightly bittersweet instead of just bitter.
Draco sat up then too, delivering his best eye-roll in imitation of Severus. "So that's the line you draw for saving the school? You won't kiss a Death Eater even for that, Harry Potter?"
"Draco," Hermione said, touching his hand to quiet him. "It's done. Thank you for telling us, even if it's late. But if you really are sure the diary is gone, then we have to start looking at what else could be causing this. And the letter from your father, depending on how much of it we can believe, might be the place to start."
"I have a free period," Harry whispered, voice full of meaning. When Draco didn't answer, he knotted his hand in Draco's new blue tie and tugged, forcing Draco's eyes up to those electric green ones, and the sweaty tousled hair that exposed the lightning scar.
He smelled like Quidditch, grass and wood and nervous sweat. He pulled Draco's sobbing face against his shoulder. Draco felt his tears course down into the Gryffindor red, sticking his face to the wet fabric with the narrow sharpness of Potter's shoulder beneath it jabbing into his face. He closed his eyes and tried to stop crying and just sobbed harder. Potter's arms stayed linked around his neck. One of Potter's hands ran through Draco's hair, and pressed his face harder against Potter's shoulder, as if giving him permission to keep crying there.
"For my own good? You're like Dumbledore, aren't you! Oh, yes, Dumbledore will hold back information from anyone, because he knows best- but you!
"It's dark magic, though," Remus said with a sigh, "Which means Draco is not going to practice it, right, Draco?"
"I... I don't know, I didn't, er, see it clearly," Harry said, voice going more evasive, and he had never been a good liar. It was stupefying, that he could be hedging the truth at a time like this. "Anyway, it was bad. Mr. Weasley was sleeping on the floor, and the snake- maybe it was that one- the snake was on a mission. But Mr. Weasley was under an invisibility cloak, and then he woke up and saw the snake, and drew his wand, so the snake just lunged on him- breaking his ribs, it was tearing all into his body, there was so much blood..."
," Draco drawled, kicking at the edge of a hoop. "Good to know. I'm sure falling unconscious from your broom will provide an excellent diversion-"
-ted. Good. Good, you're remembering well. Much better than last year." Dantanian preened, not without a furtive glance towards the merveilleux. "Just one more thing, my love. Why are
what you fantasize about," Draco teased, and pecked Harry's mouth a last time before sliding off his lap. Right to the ground, at Harry's feet. "A flower? Or a different reward?" Harry's fingers reached out to trail through Draco's hair, and Draco turned his face up to kiss them eagerly. He traced over Draco's lips, and Draco could have died of how good it felt, to get on his knees and see Harry Potter looking down at him. He'd put his glasses back on, like he wanted to see as much of Draco as he could.
"We used to be," Draco said tightly, biting his tongue against the tears and blinking fast. "We haven't been for a while, though. Because I chose that.
Hermione was looking at the top, though. "It goes back to medieval times," she said wonderingly. "The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. 'Toujours pur'. That's French..."
"Yes!" Draco cried excitedly, and ran forward and nearly flung his arms around Severus in his armchair before stopping himself out of self-preservation, and just bouncing gleefully in front of Severus instead. "Thank you, sir! Happy Christmas, sir!"
"I don't," Draco said, putting on all the nonchalance on the world. He wiped his mouth, redid his tie, and gave Harry a kiss on the cheek before stepping out from behind the statue. He only had to run a little in order to catch up with Hermione on her way to Arithmancy.
"Fine," Draco said sulkily. "I'm a pureblood. My name is Lysander Wright. I'm a bold-faced liar. Are you happy now?"
"Hermione Jean Granger, Rat Thief Second in Command, the brave undaunted Gryffindor, with her magnificent lion's mane of hair-"
It seemed to take forever hiding there, just trying to breathe, with all his remaining senses shot through with nauseous fear. And then Hermione was pushing him away and telling him Potter had gotten his golden egg, the crowd going crazy around them, Weasleys hugging like there was no tomorrow. He still couldn't breathe until he looked and saw Potter up high above them, streaming through the air on his Firebolt, gold shining beneath his arm. Really, why should anyone have ever doubted Potter's ability to capture something gold from a broomstick?
But there were Dementors coming from his other side, a great wall of shadow that stretched all around in every direction. It closed in on every side, except for the part assailed by the dragon.
"All to plan, you madman?" Harry laughed, looking shaken too by what Draco had been able to uncover. Or maybe that it had been Draco who had been able to do it.
To address a question, when Draco told Aragog that his father had a tracking charm on him back in the last book, that was just a fabrication by Draco. He was making things up to try and get Aragog not to kill him, no more than that. Draco is an inveterate liar lol
"No. No one does." Grindelwald gave him a look like he hadn't been born yesterday. "Really! There's this block on me, that kicks in and won't let me tell anyone. I don't know why it doesn't work with you. Maybe because you figured out on your own."
Severus could have pointed out now how these were the wages of Draco's recklessness, of acting unilaterally like he had at Gringotts. Draco had thought he was making the people he cared about safer, but now- and risking himself was one thing, but
"What if you made the potion and put the hair or whatever in it before they died?" Draco mused. "Hey, anything to add to the discussion?" he sniped, and kicked lightly at the leg of the chair. 'Periander' yelped as if he had just been the victim of an attempt at Sectumsempra, and earned Draco one of Hermione's withering looks.
"Mad?" Severus's lip twisted. "None would have said so, not before all those Muggles fell to a single curse, with only a finger left of Pettigrew beside them." He crossed over and took Draco's shoulder, pulling him away from the Pensieve, and back into the room where there was a fire. Draco was only too grateful to be led to its green warmth. "Draco, I was a great deal like you as a student. Yes, you have a great old name, the Malfoy looks, a charm I did not have- a greater precociousness, perhaps even a greater gift with magic, and yet-" Draco opened his mouth to protest. "I still see so much of myself in you it frightens me. And when I see you face a mystery with certainty you know every answer, without any fear
"I took- I took the draught of peace, but- but Aunt Bella," Draco mumbled, and pointed to the bent wand on the ground that he had not picked up. "Aunt Bella wants her wand back."
"I don' know how they can all think yer the Heir o' Slytherin," Hagrid said fiercely, another tear sliding down his face, "When anyone wi' eyes t' see can see yer nothin' a' all like yer father."
. It was toned down from the historical as well, naturally, with the great swell out of the skirts the same as any ball gown, not the larger, squarer Marie Antoinette look that Mother had shown Draco in pictures. And it was sleeveless like those dresses wouldn't have been, Luna's body wrapped in a tight bodice with a line of silver ribbon in bows down the front, and enough silver filigree and diamonds embroidered on it to probably buy the Burrow four times over. Draco's necklace finished off the look perfectly- save for the live holly earrings. They'd have to work on those. But with the long diamond tassel earrings and twin bracelets of white and blue diamond also in Mother's package, Draco had the perfect materials to do so.
"I was studying the... problem," Severus said, even and controlled, "As I have been dedicated to since I discovered it in the dagger. I have undertaken research on this- retracing steps you took, it seems, in New Zealand, along with others of my own- and with books found at Xaphan-"
"...FOR THE HEIR OF MALFOY MANOR TO BEHAVE SO UNNATURALLY, CONSORTING WITH MUDBLOODS AND CHASING DISGUSTING PERVERSIONS, WERE YOUR MOTHER ANOTHER WOMAN, I WOULD QUESTION IF YOU WERE MY SON AND NOT A HALF-BLOOD BASTARD-"
"Lovely," Draco called. "After the events of today, expulsion would be ideal. Now can you leave me alone? Do you imagine you're
he had at the tip of his tongue, but the idea of being cruel failed, as it often seemed to in the face of Gilderoy. It was worse than kicking a puppy. It was like compounding someone else's great crime by smaller, more petty bits of cruelty. And what was the point of that? Gratifying his own ego? Whatever he did, there was no salvaging that.
His spirits were revived when Draco presented him with a larger present. "For me?" Gilderoy asked disbelievingly. Despite the incredulous look all four men were giving Draco, he nodded brightly. Gilderoy ripped open the silver wrapping eagerly, only to cry out in amazement at the sight of the fur. He raced over to inspect himself in the nearest reflective surface, a china cabinet filled with the few House Black ceramics Draco had saved from Sirius. "It's Ravenclaw colors!"
The possibility of being expelled haunted Harry, though Draco kept assuring him with blue loop-confidence that it would be fine. But mentions of Sirius's trial kept the Wizengamot in mind, and both Sirius and Harry's futures hanging in the air, just as much as whether Sirius would try to murder not just Kreacher but also Draco, for their steadily increasing hoard of dark objects and Black family memorabilia. Two categories which, needless to say, often overlapped.
"What is going on up here?" Sirius demanded, busting into the room along with Remus. He had his wand drawn at the sound of screaming, and looked ready to curse Severus at a moment's notice. Remus stepped between Draco and Severus, and after saving them, Draco wanted to cast Sectumsempra on them both.
"Because," Dantanian said calmly, "If you will, then I would very much like for you and I to be friends."
see what you were so desperate to uncover." Draco was coughing as he pulled himself to his feet, enough for Severus to deliver him additional vials of cough potion and blood-replenishing potion. "No arguments." Draco took them before cautiously approaching the fireplace he had unveiled.
"A Parselmouth!" said Ron, "You can talk to snakes," and then he and Ginny were pushed aside by a shaking Hermione, vibrating with rage as she climbed up to Draco.
Gilderoy squirmed under that gaze, threatening to upset his precarious perch. "Not, well, ah, meaningfully," he said, sticking to that word like a byline. "I am getting a bit peckish as well..."
Harry fancying Draco showed he would prefer someone who challenged him, not genuflected towards him. Ginny had nourished her pathetic little crush for years, but eventually, she had discovered there were other boys and moved on. Combine that with her taking up playing Quidditch, even Seeker this year once Harry was suspended- Salazar knew Harry seemed to like Seekers- and it was all turnabout's fair play. Harry would no doubt end up missing the days when he had Ginny's full attention, regretting how he hadn't taken his chance when he had it, and somehow manage to bring Ginny back around, just like a perfect story. Draco could gag on how perfect it was.
Ron stared hard at a Polaroid of Draco and Hermione at the Muggle World Cup final, both proudly displaying yellow-green Brazil souvenir cups they had forgotten at the stadium. Draco could see why Ron was staring, even aside from the unguarded prettiness of Hermione's smile. The careless joy on that beaming face belonged to a different world than the one they had fallen into- fallen, thanks to Draco's inability to kill Pettigrew just one year sooner.
Wasn't that always the risk of time travel? Unless this was some alternate universe. He couldn't know whether it was the same reality, whether he was actually a virtual seer with foreknowledge of seven years to come. For all he knew, the world could behave differently than he remembered from here on out. But if it didn't, and there was only one world he was redoing, how could he not make it unfold wrong, unfold worse, more than just Father in prison and Severus and Vince dead- he could doom his mother, his fellow Slytherins,
The first real snag came a few days later. Draco was consulting the Marauder's Map for them to sneak out of Myrtle's bathroom, and saw the dots that said
Dantanian's dark hair was, for the first time in memory, straightened completely, and hung in a loose gleaming sheet of darkness all around his face. The front strands were the only ones secured, by a band of glistening black diamonds almost outdone by the tresses beneath them. He had great stones of midnight blue onyx around his throat like some old Egyptian deity, and long coiling black diamond bracelets up to his shoulders that showed under his robes, translucent where there weren't covered in the feathery fur, real feathers, and scattered black gems that made him a black swan. His dark eyes looked so huge they were unsettling, like some make-up or spell had doubled them in size, and his lashes were so thick they were like wings. He had more black diamonds on than Dorian had white, something like Maleficent showing up to Sleeping Beauty's christening, if the girl had personally invited her. It was hard to believe Dantanian did not have at least as dark purposes as that lady of ill repute.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. "It's not like I've never met an elf who wants to be free," he admitted, and rued it when he saw the light that put in her eyes. "But it's rare. And maybe an elf who doesn't want to serve without pay shouldn't have to, but there would need to be another structure in place for them to go to, or they just wouldn't belong anywhere anymore-"
"Draco," Ron said, grabbing his arm. "You expect us to believe that, when you were just telling us on the train that you wouldn't turn on your family for us? I get why you're protecting him, Draco, but he's
Ron and Hermione had to attend to duty as prefects. Draco missed the sight of the Weasley twins too. At least he and Luna had respective boyfriends to come rushing. They ended up holding court at the emptying Ravenclaw table. Harry and Neville hovered, neither looking happy at the outcome of the Sorting.
"The wards are intact," Gilderoy said, closing his eyes. He was not trembling at all anymore, nor was there any particular grief or fear in his voice, but desolation somehow resonated from him all about the garden and his gargoyle servants. "They've brought them back up for me. With Seguinus and all the rest dead, they've recognized
"It's him," Hermione said, "He'll win." And then, although the silhouette with the cup was still almost all in shadow, Draco saw a glinting in it around the face, and then a rounded shape that made him realize: the figure was wearing glasses.
Theo stood watching him, he didn't know for how long, a skeptical look on his face that filled Draco with a rush of wariness and a simultaneous low murmur of hope. Draco straightened to face that keen, intelligent face with a sneer of the swagger he needed to blow past it. "Jealous?"
But Draco had been ready for that. With all those laughing summer afternoons practicing dueling with Sirius, those evenings with the Rat Thieves, he had the reflexes to be faster than them. He cast Serpensmorta on one and then the other- give them their own snakes to play with, it was only fair- which pulled them away from Theo, to the sides, where Draco could forget their existence. That left Theo stumbling back from Draco, drawing his wand from his pocket with a hopeless look already in his unfathomably beautiful blue eyes...
It occurred to him after that maybe he should have given her the note, or asked if there was some direct way to communicate with Xaphan that Dumbledore had kept from them, because he
"Okay, okay," Seamus laughed. "We'll send him out. We still on for football this weekend, mate? Last one of the year. We can bring all the boys."
"He wouldn't have," Hermione said into his ear, utterly confident, "But you can't take it back. You're not broken up, so take him at his word and
"That mockery, that won't touch us! And yeah, they may underestimate us. But do you know who's been underestimated her whole life? Our Chaser!" Draco said, with his eyes on Pansy to be sure she knew who he meant. "Do you know who's the only person in the entire school to ever successfully curse
"Yes!" Draco gasped, and clutched at Harry's face, pressing a series of hard kisses to his lips between his trembling words. "Yes, I like you, you selfish prick- don't make me say it,
Ron snickered at the word. "He's still getting used to that, Frankenstein. Every time someone calls you Harry's boyfriend, he goes all flushed and giddy, like some first-year with a crush."
"Just don't say nine names," Hermione corrected in her adorable know-it-all tone that would brook with no disagreement. Luna and Draco stood up with her, an ear-splitting grin on Luna's face, while Draco watched more cautiously. "Say ten, Frankenstein, you have to."
"That depends," Draco drawled, and felt his fingers almost completely returned to feeling as he traced his fingertips over Harry's palm. "Would you be trying to smother Theodore Nott every night in his sleep? Corpses leave such an
So Draco celebrated, lifting the Snitch in the air, and blew a kiss to a truly bemused-looking Diggory, all because Potter was looking. Even if the presence of Remus Lupin's eyes on him, not far from Potter's, made him feel like a traitor to so many things he didn't even understand.
you're not jealous that Luna and I have boyfriends now. That you don't have time for one with your studies, but if you wanted one- or a girlfriend, no judgment- you could tell me. I'd try and make it happen-"
"Why does it look like, Weasley?" Draco asked impatiently, sneering at him. "Are you being deliberately slow? Go to my tile." Weasley didn't move. "You can substitute a human for a human, it seems. Go be a pawn. No title, Sir Ronald, but better life expectancy."
"Well, you see, Luna told me all about you, Harry," said Riddle. "Your whole fascinating history. She was writing all sorts of missives back about you to her father about famous Harry Potter for the
The frogs were each a different color of the rainbow, and they all belted out the song with great aplomb. Once again, Harry, Ron, and Seamus's attempts to curse them away were unsuccessful, as they delivered Draco and Luna's most recent musical composition. Like last year, Luna got the first verse, and Draco got the second.
"But what?" Draco growled. His right knee had started bouncing restlessly. He put a hand down to still it. "You know what's best for everyone, right?"
"Do we?" Draco said, amused by a new proof of Harry's jealousy, albeit towards the most unlikely recipient. He supposed it didn't help that now, he couldn't explain his real reason for saving Gilderoy in the first place: Gilderoy's feelings for
"Have you gone mad?" Theo hissed, looking around scandalized at even the idea of someone hearing Draco ask. "We couldn't in front of all of these people. Our families-"
"Do you understand yet?" Theo said intently. "It's very important that you understand, Draco, try and focus, the most important thing for me is that you understand what is happening to you and why. And because of whom. That's what I need to see you realize, Draco Black, how completely you failed everyone you ever cared for, before the end."
"I'm sorry," was all Draco said, trying to keep his face and breathing level. Theo shifted, looking to feel a certain awkwardness himself, the squeamishness of someone who longed to stay at a remove from anything sordid or unpleasant, and yet found the outside world corroding at the edges of his beloved book world nonetheless.
"Severus said in a letter," Draco lied, "I just got it," and willed Pansy and Millie's fathers not to have known and told them sooner, or at least for them not to mention it.
Unfortunately, a knot of other seventh-year girls passed through the Great Hall at that very moment. Cho Chang came to an abrupt halt at the sight of the famed Kingsnakes manager, caught red-handed assisting the enemy. She stood there silently, pretty dark eyes accusing, but her following was not so circumspect.
gotten used to having Malfoy around Hermione. It's like a magical car. Sure, you don't know what it is or how it works, and you never know where it's gonna go or what it's gonna do. But you sure can get somewhere with it. And it's better than no car at all."
There they three were, Draco and Harry and Luna, Frankenstein and prime admirers- unfortunately both prime

"I know!" Grindelwald cried out gleefully, and a brief glimpse over as Draco dragged the dark wizard down a steeper hall downwards confirmed what he should have already suspected- bodily discomfort notwithstanding, Grindelwald was
"Sunday night?" Draco said in a small voice. "I mean- I've already got detention this Saturday, so..."
"Of course there have been mistakes in the past... but the Ministry is striving now to offer every assistance possible to the war effort... Gilderoy Lockhart, for instance. I gave the executive order to try him privately, and remand him to the custody of Albus Dumbledore and Sirius Black. That was a personal favor to your friend Mr. Black..."
If Draco had seen the Mirror of Erised in the blue line's first year, he probably would have seen Potter in it back then as well.
"Follow the spiders," said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. "I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive. If Draco hadn't been able to talk to spiders..."
It was only when Draco was trying to sleep that night, though, that he remembered that Trelawney had also predicted the Grim in Potter's future, in tasseography, and that the Grim's form was a large black dog. Like the one Sirius had appeared as, in the Quidditch match when the Dementors came and Potter fell.
"You knew he was a fraud when you hired him, didn't you? I don't mean to be insubordinate, Headmaster, but please, don't pretend it wasn't obvious, not to someone with as much experience as you. You knew what he was and you hired him anyway. Maybe because you couldn't find anyone else, but maybe because you wanted to teach Harry something. He's your priority, isn't he, with that prophecy of Trelawney's? You wanted to show the dangers of fame, and what Harry
Nothing was happening either, not even when Draco resorted to the obscene and began to pull up memories of happiness in the vulgar sense.
said this boy had an ego on him. Draco could see why she'd upgraded to Dean Thomas. Good on her, as long as the upgrading stopped there, and she never got her hands on the real prize.
The news of Severus's clemency compared to McGonagall, who had taken 50 points off each instead of Severus's 20, seemed to turn the trio even more firmly to the opinion that Severus was working for the forces of evil. "I don't understand," Granger said, looking to be fighting back tears, while Potter looked incredibly glum by her side. "Why is it 20 for you and 50 for each one of us? Everyone hates us now, Draco! We're
"I thought you weren't interested in this, Frankenstein," Hermione said, as they parted in the Great Hall from a sullen-looking Ron. Luna was doing a better job putting on a good face. But she was still pouty, not happy to watch her friends, cousin, and boyfriend go off to a fancy party without her.
He had forgotten this was the morning Potter got his Nimbus 2000, an arrival whose news had enraged him at the time, but was just satisfying this time, as further proof he'd succeeded in not messing up the part that Quidditch held in Potter's destiny. He derived far more satisfaction, though, from watching Father's poor old Claudius put to service delivering a simple parchment-wrapped package beside Granger's breakfast, making her head snap around wildly before Claudius swooped off no doubt sourly back towards the Owlery.
Harry let out a whining sound as Draco kept him back, hand going to grab Draco's instep. Draco kept smirking and just let him, even as Harry pushed it aside. Draco pushed up his other foot to keep Harry back, and Harry caught it after it prodded against his chest. Draco poked it at Harry, and Harry caught that too, grip suddenly iron on Draco's ankles, and Draco stopped laughing.
They gathered in Flitwick's office early the next morning, Draco, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, and Ginny. Sirius had insisted upon a Muggle dress code, as if the observation of one House Black tradition in a solstice wedding had to be counterbalanced by something that would make all his ancestors roll in their graves. But as members of the wedding party, they had been told their outfits would await them, and showed up in their robes and uniforms, bleary-eyed until Hermione passed around a thermos of very strong coffee.
Potter flushed and let the sword fall to his side. Draco wondered if he expected some kind of congratulations. He had no idea what to say. What could you ever say or do sufficient to requite what Potter had just done?
"You're going to make fun of me now, aren't you," Harry said gloomily, taking Draco's inspection to have the exact opposite motivation it did.
"I know," Pansy said, seeming encouraged if anything to not get a straight no. "But you've got to go to the ball with
He inquired after the procedures to change from wizard to Muggle money to reimburse her parents, though he knew they would probably try and dissuade him. He didn't have to feign excitement in this representation, just leave out the fact that he would be bringing what probably was a time bomb with him to Hampstead, in the person of his wand. But he didn't think a Muggle football game would likely be the sight of the explosion. Telling her things like this would only worry her, when she couldn't do anything to help, and didn't even have access to a library to research in.
"Exactly," Draco said, as Harry conjured a cup before using Aguamenti to fill it with water. He offered it to Draco, and then poured it over Draco's head when he didn't take it.
into the metallic sheen of these bellows in the dark. But Lockhart's observational capabilities were still alarmingly sub-par, for someone to whom they were entrusting the structural integrity of a
Then all three were handed slender turquoise vials of Draught of Peace with a silver ribbon on each, and unceremoniously shooed towards the door. The other two left without Draco having learned the boy or girl's names, not that they showed any indication of wanting to give them. Draco lingered as Severus had surely known he would, until Severus beckoned him back to the fire. "Did you receive any other presents? They would have been at the foot of your bed." Draco shook his head, trying to hide how it stung. He had spent a not-inconsiderable amount of time carving a second charm for Granger's bracelet. This one was an imitation of another from his mother's bracelet, a Celtic St. Brigid's cross. But he hadn't gotten anything back from her at all.
Valentine's Day present for him isn't exactly something that can be given in public," he drawled, and had the satisfaction of making an embarrassed Neville nearly trip over the cobblestones.
And then Potter grabbed him by the shoulder, and for an awful moment, Draco's wand still lifted, not registering the difference between the real Potter and the reflection. "Sectum-"
Hermione gave a helpless smile when she saw him in his navy Arsenal hoodie, with the hood pulled up over his hair. "Isn't that too small for you by now?"
Draco had to say something. It was a shock to see Potter like this, but more of a shock to be treated with nothing but friendly concern. Fresh. Untainted.
Draco took more time finishing Potter's Slytherin tie than he had to, before straightening the dark green collar of Potter's robe and not bothering to hide his admiration for the picture Potter made, for once. He would think it for the Slytherin apparel only. "Perhaps I would have changed my mind, Potter, should your appearance have too gravely profaned our noble colors. But instead... I find Slytherin rather suits you."
against Pansy. It had been a signal to anyone with eyes that Severus would back Draco up in a conflict. And Draco trusted that for any Slytherin worth their salt, the message was taken in. Pansy, for one, didn't try to call Granger names anymore.
The Weasley twins had also cooled in their ire towards Draco, though they were no more likely to speak to him than they had been before. Which was a shame, really, since as Draco noticed with them nearby doing unholy things to a salamander, his growing twelve-year-old hormones found them rather fit. Draco dragged his gaze away from either Fred or George- he could never tell which was the marked-for-death one- shoving fireworks into the hapless amphibian's jaw, and offered his own unique perspective. "If I was a ghost, for my Deathday, I wouldn't celebrate with a party. I'd just save my best haunting for that day, for whoever killed me. Or whoever was the nastiest to me before I died." Draco remembered Myrtle's grudge against that Olive Hornby with a grin. "Maybe something involving honey and badgers, if they happened to be a Hufflepuff."
"Oh, I wore that the night of the Third Task," Draco said absently, "So I don't remember exactly, but it must have broken at some point in the graveyard," only to wilt under their stricken stares. "What? You asked. Should I have thrown the thing out? Performed an exorcism? The set's not complete without it." He had the feeling the dragons and their chain would be the last presents he got from Mother for a while, if ever. "Its wing is ugly, yeah, but I'm getting around to fixing it."
When the Assessor warned Draco about the intoxication of fully unleashing his magic, he'd obviously meant it about consequences outside mere exhaustion. But the exhaustion itself, in the days between the Cup and the return to Hogwarts, was enough to make the warning more than apropos. Draco slept through lunch, and found himself unmotivated to drag himself out of bed for supper, even when Mother came to his room personally to take him downstairs. Whatever she saw in her felled son, broken skin prominently on display without even the energy in him to roll over, it made her give permission for him to eat his meal upstairs, summoning elves to bring him food.
But there was a hitch to all this, which Draco couldn't believe he hadn't foreseen. It was the same as in the blue loop, except now Draco was on the other side of it, and had to suffer the quiet resentment of Vince, Greg, and Theo for the entirety of that Tuesday's Quidditch practice before Millie blurted, "Why did you tell everyone their fathers are Death Eaters?"
He had a full course load with all the basic classes and his two electives, Ancient Runes and Arithmancy, which he had never studied in the blue line. He had to do his own work for them and assist the inept Harry and Ron with theirs, and sometimes Neville. He had extra potions lessons with Severus for three hours every Sunday. He started up playing football again with Dean, Seamus, and Hermione when it was warmer. He and Hermione checked on the Wolfsbane Potion daily. He checked on Naufragiam daily. He gave Harry his weekly dueling lessons for hours on Monday nights, having been wheedled into continuing them despite his misgivings. He took daily baths in Angel's Infusion, and brewed Valerian tea daily for his anxiety. He studied and re-studied his invisible ink notebooks, he visited the kitchens daily to read the Quibbler cover-to-cover with Dobby and Luna, played Wizard's chess with Ron, brainstormed about the talon wand with Theo while they waited for letters, and he never allowed himself to think past the task immediately before him, trusting exhaustion to do the work of that for him. Except for a half hour every night. In that half hour, he let himself think of whatever he wanted. And inevitably, locked inside his soundproofed bed curtains, his mind only ever went to one person. One with very green eyes.
