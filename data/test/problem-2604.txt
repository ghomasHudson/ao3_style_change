Pansy immediately began dialling and the boys went to the door where a flash of the angry man could be seen. Draco nodded once before he brought Harry towards his bedroom and away from the yelling.
"My love, my light, my stars!" Harry sang from his spot on their bed, one of the only things they'd managed to unpack and put together properly since they'd moved into their new flat. Moving was something Harry's therapist had suggested they do, so they had, and now it truly felt like
"No touching, Potter!" Draco hissed with a piercing glare, but his hands were trembling and he stood with his shoulders nearly up to his ears.
"There we are, darling. All done." She hummed with a small smile, patting his knee as she stood up.
"What? Don't you want to go to our bed chambers?" He lowered his voice seductively, "You know how I love to taste myself on you when I eat that pretty little arse out. Don't you want that, my beautiful pet, hmm?"
“You’d better take
"Because-
"Okay, yeah. Okay. Sorry, I'm so back and forth. It's-I'm working on that."
Pansy froze and her grip on Draco's arm tightened. Her eyes flickered with something dangerous as she looked at the thin red lines that lined his wrist, the very obviously fresh new lines of cuts lining his wrist.
He looked down and found a pinecone wrapped in his hand. Dudley had shoved a pinecone into his hand and Draco couldn't help but to laugh. An incredulous and borderline hysterical sort of laugh. He saw Dudley give him a concerned look which he waved off.
name did you treat him so rudely? Hmm?"
"I love you, Harry. So,
"I don't send anyone to stalk you!" Harry sputtered. He didn't! He just sort of had his friends watch out for Draco was all. That wasn't stalking it was being... neighbourly.
Draco twisted his face into a scowl, Sirius knew he hated it when he called him by his actual name instead of Dragon. It made everything seem
Draco's hand rested on the doorknob as he pulled the heavy door open only to have it slammed shut once again.
"Wait, Draco, I-"
Blaise silently came and sat on the sofa with them. Draco watched as Pansy and Blaise had a silent conversation between themselves and he knew they were going to ask before either opened their mouth.
you," Harry says letting one hand reach up and brush tears from Draco’s cheek, he doesn't flinch this time, "I know Bellatrix and the Carrows force you to watch these things. You wouldn't unless you had to. I know you would stop them if you could. But you can't. Not yet. And I know it hurts every time you have to move their bodies, every time you try to revive them but you can't. I know. And I'm sorry."
"Never," he said dangerously low,
Harry put his hands up trying to look as non-threatening as possible, apologies resting on the tip of his tongue.
Draco blinked, then blinked again. Did he just...? His mind blanked as he watched the other boy grab him and pull him up. He stamped out the urge to cringe away. He really needed to get a handle on the no-touch thing.
"I'm not
and being a
He unceremoniously dumped Harry's things all over the ground and huffed out a sound of irritation before poking Harry in the shoulder roughly.
"You'd make it for me anyway," Harry said smugly, then he stood up and went to rifle through his drawers for something to wear.
"Do you
He felt Harry's grip on him tighten as he brought Draco over towards the couch, not releasing him once. "Okay, alright. I've got you, love." Harry hummed sitting down with Draco pressed against his broad chest as he stroked his hair gently.
"Harry, god, Harry." Hermione said, her hand resting on her temples as she rubbed at them lightly, "I ruined everything. Please, don't hate me."
“I’ll clean it! Please, don’t! ‘m sorry. It was an accident. I didn’t mean to-”
and she knew how to make me feel better. I never meant for…" Hermione took in a choked breath of air, and a waitress interrupted her right as she went to speak again.
He knows that would only upset him further, would make him cry, and hold Draco close apologizing like it was his fault, even though it wasn't. He always was such a martyr. And even though Draco doesn't care right now he will later. He'll care too much and he'll regret it. So he doesn't.
“‘M so-o sor-sorry.”
Harry paused and unwrapped his arm from Ron. He scooted back and faced him directly, his eyebrows scrunched up. Concern was written all over his face. Ron returned to look with one of guilt, almost as though he thought he'd done something wrong.
"Oh, you know my dear mother, she'll be sending Isaac as per usual. She is
"Hey, it's alright, Pans. It's probably nothing, why don't you pick another game," Draco said, standing up and making his way over towards the door where the knocking continued in an almost frantic way. It was probably Mrs Figg looking for her cat again.
"S'alright, not your fault. Want to tell me what actually happened? I know you never hurt any of them, I know it's never you. Tell me what they made you watch."
"Thank you," Harry whispered against a stunned Draco's lips before he pulled away.
He groaned, throwing his head back in such a dramatic fashion that Draco would've applauded had he been there to see it. But he wasn't. In fact, he was the only one missing from the tight-knit group piled into their usual compartment on the Hogwarts Express.
He trailed off anxiously. How was he supposed to tell Harry it had only been a little over 3 months since he hadn't been under the influence of a sociopathic abuser?
Too afraid of what it could mean.

be like you."
. He shakes his head violently back and forth. He doesn't want to tell him. He tries to pull his hands out of his grip to rip at his own hair. He doesn't deserve this comfort not after what he just did. He shouldn't have taken down his nicely built walls that kept him perfectly in check. He should have just buried these feelings in with the others. Should've let someone
Draco and Pansy nodded before Blaise tugged them into a group hug and they quickly settled back into sleepover mode. Pansy grabbing Draco's hand to finish painting his nails, being mindful of his new cuts and Blaise went to sift through the Lupin-Blacks movie collection.
Draco wanted the floor to open up and devour him whole if it meant getting away from her harsh glare or Blaise's look of concern as he saw the damage.
"Hermione, you are the most brilliant person I've ever met. And I've known you for a very long time. You don't make a decision without thinking it through at least a dozen different times. This wasn't an accident and you can't blame it on Ron being deployed. Maybe the first time wasn't intentional but you chose her every time after. And you chose her over him."
"Th~thank you, m~master." Draco slurred, smiling at him like he was God-sent. Tears ran down his flushed face, his silver eyes glazed over from the pleasure. Fuck, the sight of his pet coming untouched and looking so utterly wrecked was mouthwatering. And knowing only
"He's your cousin?!"
"Draco Lucius Malfoy,
"It's alright," Draco whispered, stroking Ron's hair as he cried into his chest, "It'll be alright, Ron, you'll stay with us tonight and we'll sort this all out tomorrow."

look. It made Draco want to scream. God did his parents have to be so bloody
Draco couldn't be bothered to care and only nodded, quickly shutting the bathroom door with trembling hands.
try and hurt someone. Even if the idea of hurting Vernon gave Draco great satisfaction it wouldn't help the situation. Theo would only go on about how Draco shouldn't put his nose where it wasn't wanted and leave it be. He always made it a point to tell Draco that he couldn't save everyone and trying to do so only hurt him in the end. Bloody hell, he didn't want to deal with that.
When he made it to their door, dread filled his body as he saw a fist-sized dent in the wall next to it. Red staining it from whoever's bloody knuckles had met the wall. And he could hear faint whimpers coming from inside the flat. He heaved in a deep breath and knocked on the door lightly. The sound of crying stopped abruptly and he could hear scrambling just before the door opened.
"I never thought she'd-" Draco began but found his words dying on his lips. He couldn't process this. He'd hate to imagine how Ron was taking it.
Harry nodded, inhaling shakily as he did so. Draco gave him another fond smile as he went to work fixing Harry's hand. He worked silently and quickly as Harry sat still and quiet save for sniffling a little.
"I will not be going with you, Father, and I will be informing Mother of all your doings," Draco looked down at Harry and gave him a smile that melted his heart, before turning and glaring at Lucius, "You ought to leave before she hears, Mother can be ever so nasty when displeased. Besides, there isn't a thing you can do to make me into something I am not. I will
Draco said, voice dangerously low as he walked into the kitchen to grab the still warm kettle that sat untouched on the stove. He didn't even so much as spare Harry a glance as he expected his request to be carried out without a word of complaint. Like clockwork, Draco heard Harry stand and pad his way up the stairs quietly.
Draco laughed again, a sweet and elegant sound before Harry stole his mouth into a kiss.
Draco nodded slowly and unwrapped his arms, carefully letting them fall to his sides. An awkward smile overtook his face before he responded.
"What if," Harry murmured, lacing his fingers around Draco's collar and pulling him closer, "what if we stayed in, instead of going for lunch with everyone, hmm?"
"Well he's throwing a party at my house this Friday around eight and a bunch of other Hogwarts students will be there. You can come as well if you like. I figured it might be a way for you to make some friends since you're new to their school." Harry explained a goofy smile found its way onto his face as he finished speaking. And Draco would have found it cute if he wasn't so distracted by what Harry was saying.
“You ruined their marriage over a good shag.
, if a little irritating, and it reminded Draco that Harry
"Nott, Theodore Nott. Pleased to meet you,
"Pansy, you don't have to-"
"I'm not a victim. If he didn't...then I'm not...even if he had...I wouldn't. I'm not." Draco bit back the urge to yell at Harry for suggesting it. He couldn't think like that. Harry didn't deserve it either. Draco was just tired and he wanted to go home and he wanted to take a long shower and scrub off everything that had happened and it was late and-wait...
Pettigrew's body landed in a mangled heap. His mouth parted in a silent scream, eyes wide with fear as he toppled over dead, multiple daggers sticking out of his unmoving body. A trail of blood stained the white floor red. What a mess. Harry let out a long-suffering sigh. Finding a new advisor was going to be such a hassle. He shook his head then shifted his gaze to his pet who now stood at the base of the dais facing away from him.
"Don't mention it, Draco. Happens," He hummed absently. His eyes refocused on the game playing out in front of them almost as if nothing had happened. Draco couldn't help but appreciate that too.
but-but
Harry's eyes are so beautiful. Draco hasn't seen anything green and living in so long not since the Death Eaters had come to Hogwarts and scorched the surrounding lands. They remind him of the grass in the spring and the leaves on the big oak trees in the summer, of emeralds and pine. They remind him of something soft and comfortable and safe. They remind him of Harry and how much he shouldn't and can't love him right now. Not without having to kill little pieces of himself for hurting someone so good and beautiful and kind with his dirty and foul being.
"I-er- thank you..."
"Oh my god, come here." Draco breathed out, pulling the trembling man into his arms and rubbing his back. He felt Harry freeze, then melt into the touch and cry harder, wrapping his arms around him in return. And Draco couldn't help but wonder how long it had been since someone had touched him without hurting him. The thought made him hold Harry tighter.
"I-I'm sorry, Uncle-" He paused and took a step back when he finally looked up to meet Draco's eyes, "Oh, it's you."
Harry stood boneless as he watched Draco and Ron interact. He'd never seen his fiancé act gentle with anyone other than him. Especially not Ron. They'd never been so familiar before. Everything was just off.
Harry looked terrified. He had tears running down his face, which was littered with cuts and he had a split lip that was bleeding. His chest was heaving and he kept glancing behind him like he was waiting for something or someone. His hair was more of a mess than usual and his glasses were nearly hanging off of his face.
He froze, fingers gripping a little tighter to Draco's hips in anticipation.
"It's alright, my love, you don't have to tell me. I'm sorry I shouted. I won't do it again. I never want you to feel unsafe or scared, not with me, not ever." Draco apologized leaving a kiss at Harry's pulse point.
The second the lock clicked into place Draco collapsed against the door, his breathing fast and shallow. He drew his knees to his chest and placed his hands on his temple.
Harry glanced at the perfect smile Blaise gave him, then scoffed and looked away, his arms crossed against his chest like a petulant child. Draco's back tensed, his eyes reflecting something of danger behind them at hearing Harry's words or lack thereof and he sat up a little straighter. He was the epitome of grace and collectiveness, even as his long-time boyfriend acted like a complete prat to his best mate and he kept his composure. Instead of making a scene in front of their guest he simply and silently put his hand on Harry's thigh and squeezed. The simple gesture didn't go unnoticed by Harry and he knew he was going to get it from Draco later.
"Ah, ah, you impatient thing. Let me have my way," Harry chided, sucking bruises on his pale neck above the collar, he did bruise so beautifully, "I promise you'll be satisfied at the end, my love."
"I never kill without reason, Harry."
By the time the police arrived and had arrested Vernon Dursley, which Draco had learned was his full name from the officers and landlords conversation, Harry's face was all cleaned up, save for the busted lip and he'd finally stopped shaking. And Draco couldn't remember him ever looking so young, without his glasses, his eyes seemed ten times bigger and greener than before. It made the awful situation hurt so much more.
The sudden shift in the atmosphere would've caught most people off guard as Draco's chatty and friendly manner changed drastically in the span of a few seconds.
Harry's stomach dropped at the sight. He knew those signs, his cousin, Dudley acted the same way anytime he heard shouting or glass breaking. He knew what abuse survivors acted like. Fuck Vernon for ever laying a hand on him. Fuck whoever had done the same to Draco.
"Sorry?" Harry asked startled by the interruption. Draco hated that word.
"Gin, I've got the bandages. You ready?" Harry said upon entering the room carrying medical supplies. The red-haired girl, Gin presumably, nodded towards Draco and raised a suggestive eyebrow, "Blondie's awake, I think I can manage a few bloody knuckles. Unless, of course, my angel wants to help me?"
. I'm supposed to be the strong one." Sirius huffed indignantly.
"Harry," She said imploringly, as their food and drinks hovered over. He took a drink of his tea and a deep breath.
"They said if he liked muggles so much they would show him how vile and primitive they were," His voice shakes as he speaks and he feels sick and dirty all over, "How-how d-dangerous. They-they cut him to pieces, Harry. I couldn't-I couldn't help him."
Draco said firmly, leaving no room for argument as he released her wrists and stepped away from her, expectant of Harry to listen. And he did.
“Harry, baby. It’s me, Draco. Come back, love, it’s okay. I’m not cross. You’re okay and in a safe place. It’s alright.” He said firmly, trying to coax his boyfriend back to reality and away from whatever horrid flashback that had put him in such a catatonic state.
"I...yeah. I believe you. Thank you,"
!" Draco said, his voice cracking as he dragged his hands up to furiously wipe at the tears beginning to fall. He thought saying everything quickly and impersonally might make it more palatable. It hadn't. He was still rendered a crying child around both his parents and these two. Screw Nott for adding to his trauma.
A whimper left Draco's mouth and he wished, hoped,
"Your father told you to be polite,
Draco let out a high pitched whine at that but stilled and allowed Harry to carry on with his delicate ministrations.
"Don't worry, Luv, I'll take care of you."
"Hmm, yes, it might be less irritating if I were actually
with me?" He snapped before thinking. Draco winced at how harsh and biting the words came out. The silence that followed wasn't helpful either.
"I-I only did it to-"
"You owe me butterbeer for at

"Watch the paintings, if you break them, Seamus, my mother will have our heads." He hollered over his shoulder seeing his friends tossing around a ball. They waved him off and he grinned, shaking his head in response.

"Draco, the police are on their way and the arsehole is locked out. Blaise sent me in to tell you that we need pictures if his mother is going to be able to convict the fucker banging on your door," She said as she shut the door on the sound of yelling and loud thuds, "He thought Harry would be more comfortable with me than another man in the room."
Draco's next question was met with silence as he turned to face Harry who silently fiddled with the paddle in his hands.
"We weren't careful enough, Goldstein and I, and my father found out through one of his coworker's children. The bugger sent my father a photo of us snogging in the library." Draco let out a stilted laugh and shook his head. He sucked in a deep breath and set his cup down as Harry studied his face, which he pointedly ignored.
The heated kiss ended far too quickly when Harry's attention was brought back to the others in the compartment with them.
Sometimes Draco wonders why he lets him touch him. How he can stand the sight of him. How it doesn't make him want to throw every
The soft earnestness in his pretty green eyes halts all sorts of arguments from leaving his mouth. Draco sighs and relents.

"And I love you more, Draco."

And he feels like he's suffocating like he's dying. Like he'll never breathe again. Tears flood his vision and it's revolting and it makes him feel
. My arms are tired, hurry it up. There are only so many places in this tiny flat to hang this!" Theo groaned, a pout settling on his face. Draco laughed loudly and waved his hands at them in a dismissive manner.
"Yes, I'll get started on tea, while you three finish hanging that painting," Draco said, wandering into his kitchen. A satisfied smile gracing his lips.
Those calm, almost nonchalant words, proved to shut Draco up very quickly. He couldn't believe, Hermione had...had done
"Ron?" Harry asked hopefully, looking for some kind of help that neither of the girls had offered. The redhead only shook his head and put his hands up.
The word slipped from his mouth sounding dazed and confused before he had time to correct it. The boy grinned charmingly and offered his hand again with another gesture.
“Actually, Harry would never ask me to stop visiting you, he’d never ask me to give up my closest friend over this, or anything really. I simply cannot bring myself to want to be around you, not as of late at least. There were better ways of doing this, more careful and subtle ways. Instead, you managed to destroy Ron’s marriage in the foulest of ways, having him catch you in his own home, his

"Alright, I'll make you a deal, Dragon. If you go over there for at least an hour, I'll let you pick where we order take out tomorrow an-"
Guilt.
"I wish you hadn't done this, Draco. I wish you didn't have to watch so many die by their hands. I wish you never had to get this," Harry traces his fingers along the inside of Draco’s left wrist.
J'irai là-bas cet instant et lui en donnerai quelques- = I will go over there this instant and give him a few-
Harry groaned again, they weren't helping. What use were best friends if they couldn't even bother giving him some real advice or stop snogging each other all the time? He was better off talking to a wall at this point.
"James! Harry! Get in here!" She hollered and Draco wanted the floor to open up and devour him whole. He didn't want Harry to see this. Then he'd have to tell him what happened and Draco didn't want Harry to blame himself for this. And he knew he would. Harry was like that. Too good to be true.

Her husband didn't flinch away from her vice-like grip and stayed silent. "You useless,
"Draco, if you don't like it here then I'm going to toss this out of the bloody window." Blaise snapped, looking rather bitter. How very Zabini of him, his mother would approve.
Lucius looked up from his work, taken aback at the outburst. He set the parchment down and folded his hands tightly. After fixing his composure, he raised a calculating brow at Draco from across the long table.
It was the week before 7th year started and Draco, his --well he didn't really know
Draco missed her already.
, sat Pansy Parkinson trailing kisses down Hermione's neck. Rage filled his body, his hands shaking from the anger as he turned and drove his fist into the door frame.
Pale hands made quick work of pulling Harry from his trousers and pants, yanking his clothes as far down as he could without too much delay. He used one hand to guide Harry's cock into his stretched and clenching hole, the other he wrapped around his shoulders to keep himself from falling backwards. Harry simply watched and allowed his pretty pet to take what he wanted. He deserved it, after all.
"Then I suppose I'll never step foot in this hell forsaken manor again. Good riddance." Draco said haughtily his lips curled in a disgusted sneer, one his father had taught him. Then he turned on the balls of his feet and sauntered towards the front door with an arrogant sway to his hips as he went.
"Hey it's alright, I'm not asking you out like that. Just want to get to know each other as friends. We can invite Luna and the others if you like, whoever you want." Harry said softly, smiling nervously at the blonde.
After situating their son on the sofa with a quilt and a pillow, Sirius was dragged into the kitchen by the wrist.
"Everyth-thing hur-rts." Draco cried as Harry held him with strong arms and rubbed his back. He didn't deserve this boy at all. Certainly not while he was such a blubbering mess.
"Just as well, I suppose, seeing as Papá and Dad love to mother you and Pansy. Like the siblings I never had."
"Er, yes, sorry Pansy. I think I'm going to have to call you back." Draco sighed, as he pressed the button next to the lift.
"I'm so sorry Blaise. You'll have to forgive Harry, he hasn't been feeling himself all day and it seems his foul mood has clouded his better judgment."
"I'll try my best," Draco replied as Blaise pulled him into a bear hug and planted a kiss on each of his cheeks and his forehead for good measure. Draco cracked a small smile and watched as his best friend walked to where they'd dumped his bag on the floor and swept it up. He climbed into the back seat then rolled down the window as Isaac pulled out of the driveway.
He listened as Draco continued to complain on and on for all the other reasons why this was all nonsense. Unconsciously, Harry found himself agreeing. His actions
Draco scrambled off of him and offered a hand to pull him up only to release him at the last second making Harry fall on his arse all over again. He let out a puff of air and Draco smiled down at him sweetly.
Harry slid into the seat across from Hermione at a small restaurant in Diagon Alley. He'd asked her to lunch while Draco took Ron to collect some of his things so he could move into their guest bedroom for the time being.
The ferocity in his voice startled him a little, but he held Hermione firmly and stared her down harshly anyway.
"Well, it's nice to meet you. Again." Draco laughed awkwardly, "I'm usually not so forgetful with names, sorry about that."
"STOP IT! STOP IT! NO!" He shouted tears streaming down his face as Theodore struggled to unbutton Draco's jeans. The blaring music turning into white noise in the background.
The young king pulled back, ordering his pet to keep his wrists behind his back. He removed his crown and Draco's circlet from their heads and undid the knife holster on his upper thigh. He dropped them on the plush pillow his pet had been kneeling on previously. He'd never make his precious love kneel on such harsh floors if he could help it. He swept the pillow to the side with his foot jostling Draco purposefully in the process. His hardened cock rubbing against his arse.
"She might come here. She'll almost
"Yes, I am. I just... I couldn't listen to their disappointment any longer." He replied softly, and he felt Pansy reach out to him, intertwining their fingers to comfort him.
"What's- Draco? Bloody hell! Love, you okay? What's wrong? What happened? Merlin, please tell me he didn't hurt you."
His hand fell from the doorknob and hung limply at his side as his heart shattered.
Still, Draco sat there on his knees cradling and rocking a bleeding and sobbing man for what felt like hours until Ron was reduced to nothing but quiet sniffles.
and you will stay here with me." She huffed curling her elegant fingers around his wrist to tug him back.
Harry did not doubt that Lucius stared horrified as Draco leant down and kissed him square on the mouth. The ferocity behind the kiss left butterflies swirling in Harry's stomach after he pulled away. He truly was head over heels for this boy.
It was a few days after winter break, and so far it had been rather uneventful which was, in Harry's opinion, an extremely good thing. No one had confessed their undying love for him, no one had spread any rumours about his relationship, and no one had harassed Draco either. So far things were looking very good.
Harry hated seeing him like this, so nervous and insecure, so unlike the snarky and confident Draco he knew. Just as Harry was going to wrap him in a hug, Draco shot up, off of the bed. His body was a jumble of anxiety as he wrung his hands together.
"Can't...please...need you...master,"
"No, really, you'd be doing me a favour. I loath football," The other boy smiled kindly as they watched the boys kick off and begin playing. They sat in comfortable silence for a while until the other boy interrupted him trying to recall his name.
Harry smiled wickedly as a serious frown overtook Draco's face.
"You are not your actions. You are not what you were forced to do to survive, just as I am not my actions or my failures. You, Draco, are not to blame for the lives you could not save, just as I am not to blame for the death of those who fought to protect me. If I'm not allowed to blame myself for the casualties of a war I never asked for then neither are you. Are we clear, my love?"
"Don't look at me, mate. I've been waiting for you to snog Malfoy since fifth year. Not sure why you didn't when he was busy confessing his undying love for you." Ron snorted, shaking his head unapologetically.
"You're alright, Harry's horrid at keeping secrets. Not like it really was a secret anyway. My father was a complete wanker nothing to it."
too busy to be dealing with the likes of me."
Draco pouted and gave Blaise pleading eyes. The dark-skinned boy laughed and reached over to where they were sitting on the sofa and fed him a bite of the brownie he'd been eating. Lord, did they taste amazing.
Draco was met with more silence and Harry kept staring at him with those impossibly green eyes full of an emotion he couldn't place. He nodded once and finished off his little speech.
Draco shot Blaise a look. He hated when he did that. The way he avoided discussing his mother even when Draco knew it hurt him or how he managed to say things like that in a joking manner. His mother's neglect wasn't funny and it never would be. He couldn't imagine what it felt like but he guessed it wasn't pleasant like Blaise would try to make him believe it was. He pursed his lips and answered anyway.
He could do this. Riddle could go fuck himself. His memory would
Whatever the drink was, it burned on the way down and tasted weird, bitter almost. Draco gulped it down and pulled away coughing. It was nasty. He'd never liked alcohol. It gave one too much of a possibility of losing control and he needed to be in control. Especially now since he'd lost it for so long.
"Ah," Draco hissed his hands flying forward and tangling in Harry's shirt and hair, "please, your majesty! Punish me if you must, but, please, stop teasing!"
Draco watched as Luna flushed a little and smiled. "I would love to, Ginny, but only if it's alright with you, Draco? Will you be okay with Harry for a moment while I help her?"
, wait did you just-did you agree with me?" Draco stumbled over his words a bit and his eyes went comically wide as he registered Harry's words. He nodded and Draco opened and closed his mouth wordlessly. The gobsmacked look was almost endearing.
"Merlin, Hermione. How could you-I don't-Merlin," Harry sighed running his fingers through his hair. He didn't know how he was supposed to deal with this. He knew Hermione was in the wrong but he couldn't crucify her for her actions without knowing how and why it had happened. That, however, did not stop him from feeling burning rage for what she had done to Ron. This was so frustrating.
As he spoke, Draco pulled Harry away from the mess and over towards the bathroom. His heart hurt as he watched how absolutely terrified Harry was. Draco made him sit down on the toilet and he crouched down in front of Harry releasing his trembling hands.
mentions of self-harm
. He glanced around the flat once more and realized how common Pansy would certainly find it. It wasn't overly cheap, or run down but it was nothing compared to either of their childhood homes. The flat had only three rooms: a bedroom and bath, the living and dining area, and the kitchen. She would be mortified.
Harry smiles at him easily and Draco melts just a little at the sight. He pecks him on the lips once more before letting his body sink further into Harry's embrace. Till he's lying directly on top of him their legs intertwined and his head and hands resting on Harry's chest.
"I think I'll be off to bed now, boys,"
"Weasley, yes, what of it?"
Because now he can feel
Luna had left with Ginny for a walk around the grounds, and probably a good snogging session if the way they were looking at each other was anything to go by. Then Hermione and Weasley had wandered off as well leaving Draco with Potter and the four other boys he'd invited. It was all a bit overwhelming.
“Good but-” Fred began, only for George to finish with, “Not as good as you, mate.”
"Would you like to go out with me, so I can get to know you?"
appreciate his input.
, I'm not done yet, let me speak." Harry shushed him easily. He lifted Draco off of his cock with little protest, settling him back down on his lap. He spread his legs wide enough to reach back and push the silver plug into his hole swiftly, keeping his come secured inside of his pet. Draco let out a sigh of relief at being plugged again and tucked Harry back into his pants and trousers on reflex.
Draco snorted at that and merely pecked him on the cheek.
"Dad! Papá wants to know who's at the door, you know how nosy your husband is." Draco called, padding down the stairs softly, wearing the dark green jumper Remus had bought him for his birthday last year and a pair of ripped jeans.
He'd growled arms folded over his chest but Draco could see the fear at the mention of the Carrows.
He stood on his tiptoes and locked his hands around Harry's neck, standing mere inches away from Harry's face. Harry's pulse quickened at the closeness of it all and his hands naturally fell to the blonde's hips.
"Don't you
"M' sorry, it's dumb. I'm being dramatic, because of-" He let out an exasperated huff when more tears rolled down his cheeks, "Nothing, it's nothing, 'm sorry."
had forewarned them. It made his chest feel warm knowing how thoughtful that had been. The rest of the boys nodded and walked a few paces out but not before Harry shot Draco one more lopsided grin. He really did have the face for a romantic comedy. The thought left a funny feeling in Draco's stomach which he ignored in favour of turning to the blonde boy and speaking.
"Who's cock?" Harry repeated as he pulled the plug out once again, allowing it to drop on the dais floor atop the red silk covering. He plunged three fingers into Draco's tight heat as replacement and fingered him insistently. The obscene squelching going straight to Harry's cock.
Horror ebbed off of every word as he wrapped his arms around himself looking like a scared child.
"Yes. I'm back, Harry, my darling. I'm sorry it took so long tonight."
"Draco, you need to try your best to let the people who care about you help you. Now whether that means telling us about when you have the urge to self-harm or letting us help you find alternative solutions to that or telling someone else or something else that you think will help, is up to you."
“I always do.”
"I understand. My biological father was the same. I don't remember much but he did give me this, that's difficult to forget." Draco said, his voice wavering as he moved a shaky hand to brush his fringe off of his forehead to reveal a thin, long, and impossibly white scar just underneath where his hairline began. He'd never really told anyone about it save for his parent's. He didn't know why he'd felt comfortable enough to mention it to Dudley it was so unlike him but then this boy understood what it was like to deal with such nasty business. And his biological father
"You know, I didn't-I never thought he'd-"
"F~fuck me! Need~" Harry pressed a second finger in and twisted them this way and that, cutting Draco off with a moan, "Need your cock!"
Draco felt his mouth go dry at his voice. Jesus, words shouldn't be so difficult. Evidently, he'd been quiet for too long as Harry's voice rang out again with a questioning,
"I-" Draco stopped himself and thought a little. He didn't just want to leave it at that. As much as he didn't want to intrude, he felt worse, leaving without offering any sort of lifeline. Then he'd be like every other occupant in this building who hadn't done anything about this.
Harry watched as a delightful laugh bubbled out of Draco. His eyes crinkling at the corners and a delicate hand flying up to cover his mouth. He grinned back at him as they stood on the porch of Draco's front door. He had such a pretty laugh.
"Oh, Weasley, how lovely!" Malfoy said as he glanced out from the kitchen into the sitting room, "I didn't know you'd be here so soon."
He’s going to die in a matter of minutes. And then he will be dead. Forever. Potter will still be alive but Draco will be dead.
Draco blinks at him. “So I can escape?”
He’s ready to die. He’s been ready for months, years really. It’s not like he’ll be missing out on much, being dead. Being alive hasn’t done much for him recently. The numbness has made his impending doom much easier to face. But even still, his knees shake as he sits up straight to face the cell door.
“Yeah well you’re irritating me just by being here," Draco says without looking at him, "but I’m sure there’s nothing I can say to get you to go away. I bet you’ll even follow me up to the astronomy tower, bet you just can’t resist it.”
The auror gives him a beleaguered look. “I do not think that is wise, Mr. Potter,” he says, his heart clearly not in it.
Potter shakes his head. “Even if that were true, what do you care? Why does it matter to you how I feel? I’m offering you your life, just, I don’t know, take advantage of me and get out of here.”
Draco glances back at Potter, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. “Do you feel responsible for what’s going to happen to me? Is that it?”
“I’ve already told you,” Draco says. “I
right about that.”
“Well it’s what you got,” he says. “And this is what I got. And now we have to live with it. Or die with it, I suppose,” he adds.
“Actually, you’re thinking of you,” Draco says, looking away. “It wouldn’t matter, I wouldn’t even make it past Inverness.”
“I really don’t.”
“Struck a nerve, have I? It’s because I’m right isn’t it?” Potter is shaking now, Draco feels a long forgotten rush as he continues. “You go around all high and mighty but the truth is you only care about people when you can get some glory out of it. Well, sorry, but you’re going to have to get your fix from someone else today because I’m not interested.”
Potter is several shades paler than usual and looks about as unsteady as Draco feels. But his voice is level when he speaks. “I’m coming,” he says to the auror simply.
A flash of silver. A gush of red.
Potter crosses his arms, a shadow crossing his face. “That’s
This is it. This must be it. They’re coming to take him away. To kill him. His life is about to end.
conclusion, Potter, but
Potter’s face twists again, just for a moment, before he looks away again. They stay like that for a long moment, Potter standing at the door, looking at the wall, Draco on the bed, hugging his knees, head in his arms. In the stillness he finds it impossible to avoid thinking about his impending doom any longer.
From the chaos a new faction had emerged, which was actually an old faction that had quite successfully rebranded itself for the new era. Led by one Dolores Jane Umbridge, they promised law and order, a return to normalcy that the radical Shacklebolt regime had no interest in or ability to give. Their popularity had skyrocketed seemingly overnight, and in no time they were in power.
reads the curly script beneath her simpering face.
“Okay then, yeah, I’m coming,” Potter says, his eyes questioning as if he’s unsure of himself. He’s silent for another moment. “You know, I died once.”
Draco stares at him. He says nothing. His mind is blank.
The voices die down and the door starts rattling again. Finally, it  bursts open, filling the cell with blinding light. Draco throws up a hand to cover his eyes, which haven’t been exposed to more than weak, clammy torchlight in weeks.
Potter continues shooting him furtive glances until the turn into the grand staircase. His eyes finally tear away from Draco to gape up at the high walls, which, to be fair, are utterly unrecognizable.
It hits Draco then that Potter is genuinely upset, a very strange realization that takes him off guard. “Why do you care?” he asks.
“To give it back to you,” Potter says as if it should be obvious. He brandishes the wand again. “Here, take it.”
“You don’t want to escape,” Potter says, incredulous.
They turn into a corridor and continue up the familiar spiral staircase. Draco remembers vividly climbing these stairs five years ago on that fateful night, running as quickly and quietly as he could, simultaneously relieved and utterly horrified at the freedom he’d find at the top of the staircase once he completed his final task. Funnily enough he has a similar feeling now.
administration, which was run entirely by Death Eaters.
“But-
Potter whisper-yells. “Yes, that’s what I’ve been trying to say. I’ll distract the guard, or you can stun him, actually you should stun me too, I bet you want to do that anyway. Then you take those stairs, and it lets out in an abandoned classroom with a broken window, I’ve left a broom there so you can-”
He turns around. His eyes meet Potter’s like a reflex. Have they always been so green? So bright?
“No,” he says. “I’m not escaping.”
Potter looks confused. “I wasn’t even saying anything.”
“No, you’re not,” Draco says matter-of-factly. “I’m staying right here.”
“Malfoy,” Potter hisses. “We can still-”
The bright side to all this is that he won’t have to endure this memory or the dingy dungeon cell for much longer. He’ll meet a similar fate to his father before too long, though surely not exactly the same. Speculating how he will be executed has become another favorite pastime since his sentencing, second only to counting the ceiling tiles. The ministry is very into poetic justice these days, which is lucky for Draco as they’ve decided to keep him prisoner at Hogwarts rather than Azkaban. The site of his greatest crime will also be the site of his execution, which he’s sure will be public and bear striking resemblance to the crime for which he’s been sentenced to die - the murder of Albus Dumbledore.
“You’d have to leave the country,” Potter says.
Harry Potter stands before him. The door’s echo fills the cold distance between them.
The auror looks as exasperated by Potter’s impudence as Draco would be under any other circumstances. “I don’t have time for this again,” he mutters, exhausted.
Potter lowers his voice again. “There’s a way. I’ve heard rumors about a few people - your people, not mine - who are operating east of here, outside Aberdeen. Smuggling people out. You could get there in a few hours.”
Draco tears his eyes from Potter’s in time to see the auror fly past him, off the ledge and out of sight.
Draco opens his mouth to say something but finds that, for once in his life, words escape him. His throat feels unnaturally tight.
“Yeah,” Draco says. “But at least it’s not
“I don’t care,” Potter insists. “I was there the night Dumbledore was murdered. By
A shock from which he’s now fully recovered. He’d been pleasantly surprised at how quickly the sheer horror he felt at every waking hour gave way to numbness, save for an ever present, dull nausea. But that’s easily ignored when there are so many tiles to count.
Draco swallows, his mouth quite dry. His stomach churns. He slowly uncurls himself and lowers his shaking legs to the ground, willing them to bear his weight without collapsing.
he commands himself, in a voice that sounds much like his father’s.
Draco stares at the ceiling of the cell and counts the slimy grey tiles for the hundredth time, or perhaps the hundred and first. He’s been stuck in his dungeon for so long he’s lost count. Though he has no way of knowing what day it is, or even whether it’s day or night, he’s sure it’s been months at least since he was sentenced to die. Possibly years. It feels like it’s been an eternity.
“So that’s why you came, is it?” he says, pure contempt dripping off his tongue. “To soothe your troubled conscience, to make sure I go to my death knowing you did
“But- no- Malfoy, I am helping you escape.” It’s as if he thinks saying it over and over again will help achieve his desired outcome.
“I can’t believe this,” Potter says, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. “I really can’t. You’re choosing to go to your death rather than accept help from me, is that it?”
“You don’t- what, you don’t
of his shoes on the stone floor to keep from blacking out.
“Hilarious,” Draco says, though he’s never wanted to laugh less in his life. Potter gives him a strange look.
And then things took a turn. Draco can’t recall exactly how it started, probably because it didn’t ever really start. It simmered from the very moment Voldemort was struck down, through three years of gridlock, sabotage, delayed and insufficient reform, and at times simple ministerial incompetence, until finally it came to a boil. It seemed like every witch and wizard in Britain had some irreconcilable grievance against the ministry. The economy was worse than it was during the war, muggle-born restrictions weren’t lifted fast enough, businesses were being looted every other day. But there was one outrage above all others that everyone could agree on - Death Eaters walking free.
Potter’s brow furrows, but then his eyes widen almost imperceptibly. “Do you… can I come?”
Even now Draco finds himself taken aback by the dramatic change in castle decor. It’s as if he’s been sent back in time to his fifth year. The portraits have been removed from the castle walls, replaced with hundreds and hundreds of flyers, roughly half of them bearing a portrait of a very familiar, very toad-like woman.
“My people,” Draco says with as scathing a look as he can muster. “Great, thanks. Good thing they let me keep my Rolodex full of
He shakes his head. For once he doesn’t feel any need to fill the air. All he needs is to focus on the sound of birds. They remind him of something he knew back then, something he still knows, deep down.
“Because I don’t want to go,” he says simply.
“That’s not why I brought it,” Potter continues without waiting for an answer. “Look, at the end of this hallway there’s a portrait of a man in an eye patch brewing lucky potion, if you poke his good eye it’ll swing open revealing a staircase-”
right?”
wand. Hawthorne and unicorn hair. He thought he would never see it again, let alone touch it, use it, but here it is, being offered to him. He swears he can feel it from a few feet away, like it’s calling for him.
Draco does not respond right away. He lifts his chin to stare down his long nose at Potter, as if it can put more distance between them than the tiny dungeon cell can offer. He does not rise off the bed.
go from there? Not home, obviously, I’d be back here thirty seconds after setting foot on the manor grounds. All my friends are dead or in prison or so far underground that they wouldn’t risk coming within a hundred miles of me.”
Sheer horror washes over Potter's face. His arm is outstretched, his white-knuckled hand clutching two wands.
Draco rolls his eyes as infuriating relief washes over him. “Fine. Whatever,” he says, praying that his voice betrays only irritation.
“For the one millionth time. I just. Don’t. Want. To escape.”
Well, they’re about to be disappointed, he decides. If they want him to plead, bargain, scream, fight like some of the others had, then he’ll give them the exact opposite. He’ll face whoever comes through that door with proud, stoic silence, his head held high, without so much as a glance back. His father would be proud. It’s surely the kind of death he would have chosen for himself, if he’d been given a bit more time to prepare.
He shakes his head. “The Death Eater leads the way,” he says, grabbing Draco by the collar and shoving him out the door. “You walk behind him.”
that easy. I literally just told you.”
“Why,” he asks after a long moment, his voice low and scratchy from disuse, “are you here?”
Draco tells himself.
His hands are unbound and he’s shoved toward the edge, the auror following close behind him. Potter hangs back, his eyes on Draco from over the auror’s shoulder.
“That’s very interesting,” Draco deadpans. “Your staircase knowledge is very impressive Potter, and you are so good and brilliant, is that what you want me to say?”
This is all Potter’s fault, he realizes. He was perfectly fine feeling nothing at all, until Potter barged through his cell door and triggered Draco’s ire in the uniquely Potter way that he always does. And now a dam has broken. He much preferred arguing with Potter to whatever this is.
“Expelliarmus.”
They go impossibly brighter for a split second. Potter nods.
you could?”
“No,” Potter says, sounding slightly affronted. “I- um-” he digs around in his jacket pocket for a moment before pulling out something very familiar. “I came to bring you this.”
“Of course it is,” Draco says, leaning back against the wall. “Don’t pretend it’s not.”
He’s acutely aware of eyes on him. Potter quickens his pace to walk next to Draco, ignoring the auror’s grumbling, and seems unable to stop himself from turning to gawk at him every five seconds. He leans in close, so close that their arms brush against each other. Draco is suddenly struck with the wild urge to grab his hand.
Potter opens his mouth and shuts it. He takes a deep breath. “Yeah. I do,” he says, his voice rather scratchy. “It’s all wrong. I never wanted any of this.”
“Glad you finally got there.”
stop being such a
“I don’t understand,” Potter says, stating the obvious. “You want to die then?”
A figure rushes into the cell and shuts the door with a bang. Draco lowers his arm and opens his eyes. He immediately wishes he hadn’t.
Today he can see everything in perfect clarity. The astronomy tower must have the best view in the castle, though he’s never noticed it before. He can see over the entire forbidden forest, or most of it, at least, endless trees for miles, and snowy mountains beyond. The black lake is blue and clear, almost crystalline the way the setting sun sparkles on it.
There’s a large crowd gathered below, but they’re too far away to hear. All he hears are birds. They must have made a nest somewhere in the tower.
Draco frowns, ignores it as best he can. “Believe it or don’t. You’ll watch it happen soon enough.” He pauses. “The astronomy tower, huh?”
“Why did you bring it?”
“You think this is funny?” Potter asks without looking at him, his voice cold.
“What? No. You’re not,” Potter insists. “You didn’t kill Dumbledore.”
“Who cares?” Potter cries, throwing his hands up. “You want to die because your reputation is ruined?”
“For the love of- you really are as dumb as you look.”
“I am telling you so that you can escape,” Potter hisses. “I can’t believe I have to spell it out for you, or were you always this thick?”
They climb higher and higher, his heart thudding louder with each step. Surely Potter can hear it, though he dare not look to him for his reaction.
. He feels his face contorting of its own accord into the most withering glare he's capable of.
“I haven’t,” Draco says. “But you have if you think that my last act on this earth is going to be to feed your twisted hero complex.”
Draco blinks. It’s fury, he realizes, the feeling that’s building in him. Quite a strange sensation after months of nothing but dull nausea. “I know,” he says.
“Yeah, I heard, I fly out of here, and then what?” Draco spits. “Where could I
Potter shakes his head in disbelief. “I just can’t believe you’re giving up like this.” There’s a twinge to his voice that Draco’s never heard before, but that can’t be anything other than utter devastation. It’s rather startling, and becomes more so when Potter looks away, blinking quickly.
“Not particularly.” Draco is having more fun than he has in years.
says the voice in the back of his mind.
“Then what is it?”
Potter grimaces, still looking at the wall. “It’s... it’s terrible”
“You just don’t want to?”
His counting is interrupted by the dungeon door rattling, and not just the tiny slot that they shove stale bread through twice a day. Someone is trying to get in.
“It is that easy -
Draco does not take it. He rolls his eyes. “Wow, thanks so much Potter, I’ll really enjoy using this for the next fifteen minutes.”
But at least the prospect of immediate death wasn’t looming over him and his family at all times, which had to count for something. And they hadn’t taken the manor, at least. He’d been content to lay low for a few years, perhaps travel abroad, and make his return to wizarding England when memories of the war and his role in it were a bit more distant.
He does not reach for it. He lifts his eyes to Potter’s. “Why?”
when they arrested me for murder, otherwise I’d have to knock on every door in Scotland-”
Draco’s eyes narrow.
“There’s an address written on the broom, arsehole.” Potter takes a quick, deep breath. “Look I’m not saying it’ll be easy but you can figure it out. You always figure out a way to get what you want.”
“Any last words?” the auror grunts from somewhere behind him.
Draco had been taken into custody before he’d even had the chance to think about escaping. He’d been trotted out for his father’s trial (if you could call it that) and execution (if you could call it that), and his own trial, but other than that he’s been stuck in one cell or another for the better part of a year. At first it wasn’t so bad, they brought him the newspaper and allowed his mother to visit him after she was cleared of all charges. Her good fortune had actually convinced him that he’d get out easily as well, an idea so stupid that he can’t help but laugh at when he looks back on it. His mother had become well known as Potter’s protector, a brave, powerful woman who had stood up to the Dark Lord himself, without whom the world could never have been saved from the clutches of the murderous cult of which she was a long-time member. She’d unintentionally amassed a bit of a fan base, and she also hadn’t killed Albus Dumbledore.
The thought is incomprehensible. It makes his head hurt. His mouth feels dry. His vision begins to black out around the edges.
Potter obliges. This is good, Draco tells himself.
Draco knows this, but he’ll go to his grave without allowing Potter the satisfaction of knowing that he knows this. He rolls his eyes instead. “Whatever, Potter. I’m not going to waste my last moments arguing with you.”
The current regime took over after about three years of a peace that had become so strained that it hardly resembled peace at all. Immediately after the war ended the ministry had appointed a slew of members of the Order of the Phoenix, headed by Kingsley Shacklebolt and handpicked by Harry Potter himself, or so the rumors say. This had gone very well for approximately one week, at which point it became apparent that repairing a country ravaged by years of war would take quite a bit more than just putting good-hearted people in the right offices. The Death Eaters had done a fine job of mucking things up on their way out, though it’s likely that even they didn’t realize just how effective this tactic would be at quashing Potter and his friends once and for all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s scowl deepens. Something familiar simmers in his stomach. Something he hasn’t felt in a long time.
“I- I’m sorry,” Potter stammers, a million miles away. “The ministry really aren’t happy with me, it was really difficult to even get here to see you. I reckon they’re going to lock me up soon, too.”
“Well,” Potter scoffs, “I hate to be the one to tell you this but you are going to die very soon if you don’t escape now.”
what this is.”
Potter takes a deep breath. “Uh,” he says, stupidly. “Hi.”
His screams fade away to nothing, leaving him alone with Potter and the sound of birds.
“I didn’t cast the spell,” he says. He can feel the heat creeping up his neck, he hadn’t meant to get into this with Potter but it’s too late now. “But he died because of me, so...”
He’d forgotten this, somehow, but he remembers now.
It’s quite funny, Draco decides. Not long ago he’d been in the exact same situation as Potter. Fancied himself a hero, when all he’d done was usher in a host of horrors he’d never intended. He would find it much funnier, he thinks, were he not about to be put to death because of it. It’s still pretty funny, but the circumstances certainly put a damper on it.
He likes the sound of birds. He listened to them often during those months he was trapped in the manor. The sound reminded him that there was life out there untouched by Voldemort. So close he could grasp it, if he really wanted to. But he could never quite bring himself...
“I’m not escaping,” Draco says.
Old networks that worked well together during the Death Eater regime worked just as well now that everything was back to normal. The ministry started functioning again, at higher levels of efficiency than ever before. There were those who disapproved of the new regime, but it didn’t much matter. The voices decrying the new nationwide surveillance wards or the restrictions on international travel or the return of the Muggle-Born registration commission were overshadowed by the excitement of a new Undesirable Number One being captured and brought to justice each week. After years of waiting people wanted blood. And at some point, though again he couldn’t tell you exactly when, speaking out became a crime itself.
The public had been quite patient with the new administration. For a while. This had been as good a period as Draco had experienced in the last five years. Sure, his fortune had disappeared, and none of his surviving friends would speak to him, and he’d been subject to the most awful humiliation of all time when Potter showed up at his trial going on about
“But you’re going to die!” Potter exclaims, looking rather crazed.
“You’re- what?” Potter shakes his head. “No I’ve just told you, there’s a secret passage at the end of the hall-”
Potter’s brow scrunches. “What do you mean why?”
“I’m not pretending-”
“I do. And besides, you know,” Draco down further, folds his arms tight across his chest. “I
“I tried to get your sentence revoked,” Potter continues, unperturbed, “but all I could do was stall for a few days. I couldn’t get a hold of a single member of the Wizengamot, I’m not even sure who’s on it anymore, or if anyone is. It’s all so fucked, I did everything I could but there was nothing, nothing…” he trails off, shaking his head, looking at Draco with something like desperation.
Finally they reach the top. The cold air sends a shiver through him as he steps out onto the astronomy tower landing, or perhaps it’s panic setting in. A rough hand pushes him forward onto the landing, towards the edge where the parapets have been removed. He supposes this is just in case the killing curse doesn’t blow him back hard enough like it did with Dumbledore, so Potter and the auror don’t have to hurl his lifeless body over the wall to send him falling dramatically to the ground. The thought is oddly hilarious, he finds himself holding back a giddy laugh.
He realizes that Potter is breathing deeply, almost as if he’s been running. “I came to see you,” says, harried.
"Are you dating?" Chang abruptly asked, interrupting Draco and Harry mid-conversation.
"That has nothing to do with apologies, but alright then. No, no she hasn't. Class hasn't even started yet," he reminded.
It was then that Goldstein interrupted his attempt to console his baby dragon, stepping into his peripheral vision and sneering.
"...no." He let out an audible sigh of relief. "However, this does put us both in an odd situation."
"I was fourteen when I first learned I was sick and dying. I didn't know that I was in love with Harry, and I didn't know how long I had to live. Every day, I lived like I was dying the next. Pansy, Blaise, and Theo... you tried to convince me that everything will turn out alright in the end. And Harry, my love, you and Ron and Hermione worked your damnest to do the same. I had to trick you all to take a bloody break from researching so damn much, and just when I thought you would finally let it be, let me die in peace, I realized I loved Harry and I didn't think Harry loved me back. My case worsened quickly."
"Yes," Draco found himself answering without hesitation.
"Hermione, Draco will
The prat already had his wand and he's already been the bane of his existence since first year. He'd already taken over Draco's mind for the past few years, and now... now Potter wants more? Did he want to take back his words of Draco's 'innocence' and throw Draco into Azkaban himself? Did he want to humiliate and step on him some more? Did he want him on his knees, crying and begging for mercy?
At least, that's how Draco remembered him being before the war.
And that was
Draco hated the fact that the only reason why he hated the thought of them was because he wanted Harry for himself.
"You know... you don't treat her like shit. Your father treated Dobby like shit."
"I don't have the cloak."
"What tricks are you playing?" he demanded.
Draco's head immediately shot up and he searched Harry's eyes for a possible explanation as to why he'd willingly leave Ron and Hermione. And then he glanced towards their table, realized they were learning about Amorentia today, and grinned widely.
"Malfoy. I… I like muggle music too?" Potter said with uncertainty. "Rock music actually. Like AC/DC."
Harry's breath audibly hitched. "Did she not do that a lot when you were a kid?"
"Potter..." Draco placed a hand on the brunet's shoulder and prayed he wouldn't get hexed for touching him without permission. Blaise and Pansy, after all, did that quite a lot during the war. And they weren't even as involved as he was, thanks to his volunteering to join the Dark Lord's ranks in exchange for them. "It's alright. We'll just share like we did the last two times."
"Fine. Maybe not the last bit, but seriously. Potter is— after Voldemort died, Potter is considered the most powerful wizard," Blaise acknowledged quietly. "And you are meeting up with him wandless."
As he leaned in to steal a kiss, he nearly yelped when Remus nipped at him.
Vicky is misty-eyed because she is preparing dinner with the other house-elves and have become distressed since they have not been kept up to date with Muggle delicacies. And, as Draco had told them that Hermione was an ally, they then took it upon themselves to accomodate to her tastes as wel!
It may have been an unconscious decision, but Pansy began carting her fingers through his hair again, forcing him to calm down and think rationally.
Draco rolled his eyes, conjuring a stool and sitting on it. “Well, I’m not leaving any time soon so I reckon that I will.”
Draco was not looking forward to dying in September on a bloody Friday.
His mind hypocritically wandered to the countless number of times he'd let Potter bother him this year. Though, if he was being honest, it wasn't his fault. Potter had always been the bane of his existence, and he was bothering him consistently enough that it made Draco believe he was doing it to not bother Draco, but to still have one familiar thing when faced with the ever-evolving things in his life.
"Well, there's nothing wrong with voicing my appreciation for beauty, Harry. You ought to start doing the same," Draco advised. "Give a compliment or two. It can work wonders on people's perspective of you."
"Right. Er… I'll get on with it then. Ahem. I didn't understand a single thing of what Slughorn said, but Potter looked even more confused than I. How incompetent."
Ron snickered. "Remember when we had to say Draco's name just to catch his attention?"
He carefully put the ring back on, smirking as the Dark Mark returned to where it came from. He ignored the pain that went along with it. Draco then removed the ring from his finger, grinning triumphantly as he looked up. "It's a transference ring. The Dark Lord can't tell that I don't have it if it's always with me. I can do it. What Ron said is not that bad of an idea. It'll be incredibly useful to have someone on the inside."
Almost immediately, he was greeted by intimidating, creature-infested woods and a peaceful, small stream running around a great wall. The stream— Draco realized after wandering closer— was not small or peaceful at all. It was at least a few meters wide, and hundreds of foot long spikes awaited at the bottom. The only way across, it seemed, was to hop over on those... pebbles. However, those too were intimidating— each one had razor sharp teeth, yellow eyes, and were glaring at him hungrily.
He hated being away from Draco when he went on raids. The only way he could get any peace of mind was to have Ron or Blaise stay behind and keep an eye on things for him. Though Harry was increasingly confident that Gryffindor was safe, Draco’s life wasn’t something he was willing to bet on. Each voyage was accompanied by endless worrying.
Jaw dropped, Potter stared at him stupidly. "No way. You don't know what the LGBTQ+ community is? I didn't know myself until this summer so I really shouldn't be acting like this, but still. You don't know what it is?"
him because Draco knew no one can compare to the sheer goodness inside of this amazing Gryffindor— it was a nice feeling.
Draco promptly continued. "My father taught me magical endurance and politics, and my mother took me to the gardens to sit under the trees and laugh at the peacocks."
"Why, shag the living lights out of him of course!"
"What? You are leaving?"
Vicky beamed. "Thank you, Master Draco! Vicky is happy!"
son. He was a member, as well as the only living heir of the Malfoy line, and a mark against anyone who bore that name was a mark against Lucius’s name.
He should've known that it'd begin happening irregularly. He couldn't have just had it right before he woke up every morning for the rest of his life. These stupid flowers would've reacted randomly. Especially on the day that a whole bunch of shit happens to him.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, don't be such a baby, Harry. We need to get going before someone else comes and isn't as lenient."
Harry, a bit winded, nodded. "Yeah. I mean, I've tried before. With Cho, it was awful. With Ginny, she didn't quite get why I wanted to. But I really,
And because Draco decided it would be a wonderful time to punish Harry for being pathetic, he flung open the door to the walk-in closet, turned on the hell lights, and dragged Harry out by the arm.
Harry had been dragged out by his ear, thrown down the stairs, and tossed out the front door.
Draco desperately wanted to retort, “Didn't think you thought at all,” but knew it was a one way ticket to Azkaban if he did. So instead, he curtly nodded.
"So all that flattering..." Hermione began.
Something in-between of jealousy and
"You and Remus?"
Potter quickly put the ring on his right hand's ring-finger, babbling through his tears.
He froze.
"Do you remember anything of February fourteenth? Anything you can tell us?"
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed. "How long have you been standing there? Come here. Quick!"
"Malfoy." Potter sounded exceptionally pleased to see him. He glanced to  "Sorry, Gin. Got to go, er, rehearse and stuff with him."
The hopeful glint dimmed somewhat, but Blaise wasn't giving up without a fight. "Just eat a few bites then. It won't make you any fuller and you can hurry off to 'rehearse lines' with your loverboy on the field."
"A sav— a savior complex?" Potter asked, his red with amusement. Draco felt like more of an idiot the longer Potter snickered. "Malfoy, I don't have one."
"Fine." Draco scowled. "'I previously wanted to be a Cursebreaker since it is a job my father had deemed respectable for a Malfoy to have. Now, I would like to do individual study.'"
He didn't have any energy for that, and he frankly didn't care enough to try and summon some.
Draco had been vulnerable.
"Merlin's beard, Harry," Draco snapped. Then he whipped his head towards Hermione. "Hermione, will you be my second in the duel against Harry and Blaise? You know how your idiot best friend can be incredibly impulsive at times? Well, he challenged me to a duel and practically told me I'd still lose with the greatest witch of our time. I obviously disagree."
"I'd have loved for him to take my place," Harry huffed. "Merlin, that was the worst thing I ever had to go through. I didn't even know what it was until Dumbledore announced it."
Draco paused, really mulling it over.
"What do you mean you'd rather be sent to Azkaban?"
Draco spent most of his time like that.
"You bastard, you think I'm fiery? No offense, but I think fire is Ron," Blaise snorted.
"I didn't mean to hurt you," Harry continued. "I didn't mean to give you a scar."
A gentle touch to his hand snapped him back from his thoughts.
"Yes."
The sudden dark shift in the air didn't go unnoticed. Harry held Draco’s hand even tighter, something akin to a low growl sounding thunderous in their near-silent circle.
His eyes cleared as he realized he'd been very close to having a panic attack in front of the person he nearly killed.
Potter nodded. "Stressed backwards is desserts."
They both stood silently in the hallway as Pansy and Hermione faded into the background, simply living— simply loving without a care for the world— in the moment the way Draco had been terrified of doing when he'd had Hanahki.
Sighing, Harry said, "I don't think now is a good time for me to answer that."
"Oh my god, shut up, Malfoy," Potter snapped before he unexpectedly pushed Draco into an empty classroom.
slide into place around them. "Thanks."
Right. For his mission to kill either Dumbledore or Harry. He already knew he wouldn't be capable of killing Harry, but he hadn't exactly put enough effort into figuring out a way to do anything either. His last report, as well as his loyal attitude, was fake.
"None of this was here last night," Harry was muttering. His hands scooped up some of the flowers and Harry tossed them carelessly to the side. "I swear. Last night, Draco got drunk off two cups of butterbeer and tried to steal half of the chocolate display Vince and Greg got out; and he definitely should've been sick since he had the butterbeer on an empty stomach, but he wasn't. Disappointed, maybe, but not sick. Draco wasn't sick at all."
Harry grew pale. What exactly had Blaise told Hermione? Surely he’d mentioned Draco, but had he brought up Lucius? Harry hadn’t wanted Hermione to find out about this at all, and certainly not before it was over. She would have tried to talk Harry out of it, even though Hermione deserved to taste this revenge.
"Come on, Harry," Draco giggled. "Her predictions were infamous. Everyone has heard the general gist of them."
"Oh bugger off! So what? I'm permanently
"Maybe I should have died with him," Draco found himself wondering out loud. He looked back down to his parchment paper, pursing his lips and slowly outlining Vincent's fall in the other eye.
Blaise sighed. His hand drifted down to pat Harry’s back a few times before it disappeared. Harry peeked between his fingers to watch Blaise head out the door. He paused in the doorway, picking at a loose splinter.
Three days after the whole kissing Potter situation, a package arrived for Draco in the Great Hall. Not that he was there when it arrived, of course. Blaise had been the one to actually receive it and deliver it to him.
"No," Pansy savagely rejected. She went back to writing. "Draco, we're going to find another cure. We can do all of that when you get better."
"Sounds like someone I know," Potter muttered.
"Instead of flying all the way to France, why don't you mirror him?" Draco suggested. Harry smiled weakly.
"Draco likes things the way they are," Harry cut in. "He won't even consider any of them."
"Before any of you begin objecting, must I remind you that there are no sides in war? Only men and women?" she asked, calling out those who suddenly looked furious.
Huffing, Draco reluctantly agreed. Three additional people helping him with his dilemma would certainly provide a solution quicker than on his own. Not that Draco wanted the solution since death seemed almost certain now, but his friends were the most enthusiastic for something than they've ever been more. That's why, at first at least, Draco refused to take this away from them.
So that’s why there're only 28 pureblood families left.
"Thank you for the information I will most likely never use after Hogwarts," he drawled. Though— when he took a moment to think about it— that statement applied to everything he'd ever learnt at Hogwarts. Still. "What have you been writing down for it?"
His bored expression immediately transformed into one of humiliated anger.
“What’s it like to die?”
Harry's face contorted, making him look both pained and conflicted.
"Well yeah and no. I skimmed through it to see when we'd be speaking and who speaks right before or after us. I also tried to catch how many of the journal entries I had to get by the end of the three weeks. But I didn't actually read it, you know?"
Draco fidgeted with his fingers as the silence dragged on, making the classroom seem gloomy and depressing. After several minutes of it, Draco sighed and said, "Sometimes I have nightmares that you saved Vince and he took the opportunity to finish you off."
"Your hand!" Harry nearly screamed.
Draco set his walls up quickly in case Severus decided to
“Apologies,” he says. “I didn’t know you were Harry’s. I wouldn’t have—” He said no more as he fled the hall.
"You should play again," Harry advised at the end of Draco's rant. "Without having a party though. Everyone was complaining about how tiring it is to clean up and you get drunk too easily."
Draco scowled. "I appreciate it, but I don't need an escort. I'm supposedly rehearsing lines with Potter. Besides, why are you so concerned now? It was fine before."
They would marry extravagantly with beautiful pansies magically charmed to levitate and fly around. But then, because Theo hates attention like Blaise, they would move to a more secluded town or village of the Wizarding World. After countless of questions from Blaise, they would decide to have two children— both male because Pansy would simply will it to be so. Theo would choose the names as it was a tradition, but because Blaise would be incredibly successful overseas, the names would be absolutely atrocious and not fitting them at all. And, whenever their children returned from another successful year at Hogwarts, Pansy and Theo would gather everyone in the living room and sing songs until all of them collapse of exhaustion. For Christmas, those children would get showered with gifts from everyone— their parents, Blaise, Vince, Greg, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and any other stray idiots they picked up along the way— and their faces will light up with excitement as they rip those presents open. And even with so many joyful events, people will speculate that Theo tricked her into their marriage simply because Pansy was the complete opposite of him.
And Draco wasn't paying attention to their conversation as they walked to the Slytherin Common Room either. He was too busy making up his mind about several things. Well, mainly two of them. He swore by the end of the day, Ron will dramatically ask Hermione
Draco's cheeks flushed. "That's not true!"
Amorentia doesn't work if the user was in love with the potioneer. No matter who the user was, that rule was going to apply to them.
"I would've thought he'd rather put it in the Slytherin Commons, not the Gryffindor ones."
"That..." Potter said breathlessly. Then he shook himself out of it. "That was good, I think. But... we definitely need more practice if we want to get it right."
His friends and family were all purebloods. And though they were all admittedly horrid people who believed in horrid things, he couldn't help but remember them as people he'd loved and admired. He couldn't help but think about who they were as people that cared for him in their own twisted way, and he couldn't help but be reminded about how Pansy and Blaise had literally clung to his robes when they were nearly forced into the Dark Lord's ranks.
Draco was about to snap back 'not wearing silk gives me hives' before he thought back to Ron, Harry, and Hermione. They obviously deserved to wear something suitable for them, and silk obviously wasn't as important to Draco as their comfort was. Harry's, especially. The bloke deserved a good shirt or two.
"Alright, well, let me know then. We can figure out whoever this is."
"Yeah right! I give you this— this prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?"
"Do you want to turn in early? Theo and Blaise can bring something down..." Pansy offered.
Harry, oblivious to his inner turmoil, stared at him. "Draco?"
Draco didn't believe him, but he could do or say nothing to persuade Harry since the bloke turned the lamp off and tucked him in.
Draco blinked, having forgotten that the two had come with them. Luna coming along had been an impromptu thing. Ginny had insisted they brought Luna with them, claiming that his cousin was rather capable in a duel. Draco didn't see it fit to protest since he himself knew how capable she was. He did, however, protest when Longbottom insisted on coming along as well. Harry had to convince him that Longbottom was just as capable before they took flight.
"I'm— look, I got my temper get the best of me. It's— it's hard for me to not get angry now, and I just— sometimes I blow up and say things or do things that I don't mean."
"I see. I'll have to exchange notes with Lavender then. She's taking the class, did you know that?"
"Merlin, finally!" Ron moaned when Draco and Pansy finally appeared in the Great Hall. "Harry was starting to worry about Draco. You would not believe how much he can talk when it comes to Draco. 'What do you reckon happened to him?' 'Should I use the map to find him?' 'Hermione, you think he's okay right?' Bloody hell, I thought I'd never hear the end of it—"
He'd known there was something wrong with Vincent when he greeted him in front of Hogwarts. He'd known there was something wrong when Vincent stared at him directly in the eye with a strange glint there. And yet—
"What?"
All of them would eventually buddy up; Draco would be left out of the group.
Flowers ripped their way up Draco's esophagus. He opened his mouth to a wordless scream, watching helplessly as flower after flower took matters into their own hands and made their exodus. Then Harry, in all his messy hair and emerald eyes glory, was by his side in an instant. He rubbed comforting circles on Draco's shoulders, murmuring "It's alright, I've got you" under his breath continuously.
"What about the last two?"
He had shooed Blaise out of his personal space. "You'll manage a single game without me, Blaise."
," he corrected.
"It's beautiful, isn't it?" Draco asked, his voice breathless as he stepped closer towards Harry.
All of their faces darken at that— even Potter and Granger, who had not been reacting much to their bout of infectious laughter. "Malfoy, you shouldn't joke about that—"
"Keep calling me names and maybe I won 't re-ask you out in front of the Great Hall."
Hint, hint, Harry didn't tell him because of that one thing Draco does that nearly drove him crazy throughout their school years.
If he was being honest, he didn't know the answer either. Hermione, in his opinion, altered in the worst way imaginable. Not that she'd changed as a person or anything. But... she'd become friendly in a way that even Draco knew that he didn’t deserve. Which was probably the most unsettling in his opinion. After all, he'd called her the 'm' word and had more often than not insulted her the most of the entire group. It was his own failure as a student that brought jealousy and loathing, and Draco didn't quite understand why she'd offered her own notes.
"Because I've figured out who I'm in love with!" Draco exploded. Merlin, did that feel good to let out.
“It feels…” Draco struggled for the right word. “Manipulative.”
"You don't need to do that. We... well, Ron and I at least— Harry's been rather odd these last few weeks— are putting the past behind us. We had a long discussion."
"Is it true? Draco?" Harry asked, panting. He then seemed to see Blaise, and he choked on his own spit. Tears welled up in eyes. "Fuck. It's true, isn't it?"
"Why can't I have bedtime songs?" Harry bravely asked one day when he was six.
After four, Harry stopped giving his aunt flowers for Mother's day. He'd been harshly reminded that his aunt was not his mother, and no matter how much he thought himself to be the Dursleys' family, the vice versa was not the same.
Draco left the Slytherin Common Room with nothing more than a handful of papers. Worry gnawed at him as he wandered down the strangely empty hallway, and his eyes glanced around himself every few seconds or so to really ensure that he was alone. At long last, he saw the doors that would lead to the Quidditch Pitch. He also saw Potter, who was talking to the girl Weasley.
Potter smiled an awkward, broken smile. And that was when Draco figured that this moment was the 'something' his gut warned him was about to go wrong.
Draco wasn't stupid.
Draco, knowing that there was another part to this story, waited a few moments before asking, "What's wrong?"
Something in Blaise's eyes soften. With one step, Blaise closed the distance between them, allowing Draco to rest his forehead against his shoulder. "Of course I will. I'm not leaving you. Pansy would feed me to the wolves."
"Yes, Dark Lord," Draco said, afraid yet unwavering. He had to. Even if he didn't want to, his mother and father stood behind him, their eyes practically begging him to say yes. Draco can't say anything else.
Draco inhaled deeply, understanding his perspective. After all, he had been confused like him once too when his mother first tried to teach him this. Luckily, his mother had been kind in her explanations and demonstrations. Draco decided to followed her example.
"I think you already know, Draco."
Draco let out a relieved sigh when Blaise left, sitting back into his chair and throwing the apple and the contents in his mouth away. He pressed two of his fingers against his tongue, gagging until he felt his previous bite of an apple coming up his throat. He threw that away too, huffing as he weakly summoned a glass of water. Draco vanished the basket and turned back to the parchment he was working on.
“What happened?” RuPaul called out from the judges’ panel.
And where did Draco fit into this range of ability? He felt slightly more confident after his workshop with Bruce Vilanch, but as a queen who had never performed before a live audience prior to appearing on
Draco held the parchment up and pointed to it emphatically, as if it explained all her feelings in the song. It was a letter from Harry wishing her good luck on
“It’s down to eleven of us this week, and we each have to come up with three looks on the runway,” Goldie summarized. The camera switched to show the werkroom while Goldie narrated a voice-over.
“No!” Paris exclaimed, just as Goldie yelled, “Hold up!”
“Goldie, have you heard that saying, ‘Less is more’? No, of course you haven’t. Just like you haven’t heard of a shower.” RuPaul and the others laughed as Goldie dropped his jaw in mock outrage before trying to surreptitiously sniff himself.
“I thought you brought a funny angle to the debate, but you tripped up when you were asked about the middle class,” Ross Matthews commented.
Paris chuckled despite herself and nodded.
“Lorena Gucci,” RuPaul continued, “I know this didn’t turn out the way you had planned. But I hope it makes you an even fiercer queen. Because your time here,” she paused for dramatic effect, “is not over.”
“I’m really sad to gooooooo,” Steve cried to the camera. “Being on this show has definitely meant a lot to me. I may not be a winner, but I definitely deserved to be here, and I think I did my best. Come see me when you’re in Vegas!” She waved and smiled.
Mounting his broom, Draco sighed in relief as he soared high up above the palm trees and raced a lap around the pitch. He slowed down and admired the view, taking in a big gulp of misty Pacific wind as he gazed down at the ocean vista. After being in the confined, smog-filled heat of Hollywood in summer, the coastal air was refreshing.
“If I may have your attention,” Draco announced in the werkroom as the queens were styling their wigs and steaming their costumes. “I would like to inform you regarding my decisions for the lineup.” The other queens gathered around his worktable.
Courtney posed, looking directly at the camera and alternating between sultry expressions and unadulterated duckface. Behind her back, Draco picked up a handful of cake from the tea table. “You’re looking gorgeous! Keep it up!” Draco told her encouragingly.
Cries of frustration filled the room at the Bent Unicorn. Draco looked around the pub, surprised to see it so full. She recognized several faces from Hogwarts, most of whom she never would have guessed would come out to support her. It must have been due to the hype created by
“This week,” RuPaul continued, “The main challenge is
“Amen!”
Steve gasped. “What the hell happened to you, Miss Thing?”
Of the four looks, Acacia had the most elaborate, modeling a completely beaded turquoise gown and scintillating rhinestone crown. Goldie had created a more anime-oriented take on the statue, painting her face with comically large eyes and wearing a costume sculpted out of papier-maché. Intoxia’s and Steve’s outfits looked less impressive by comparison. Steve’s in particular looked like a roughly hewn poncho.
“Hey there, presidential squirrelfriends!” RuPaul entered the workroom with an older blonde woman in a pantsuit. She smiled and waved at the queens.
Draco mouthed these first words with a soft, wistful expression on her face as she straightened her back.
Draco was in the mood to be as much as he could. Light reflected off his immaculately styled white-blond hair as the queens gathered around a work table.
Draco cried, dropping his jaw in a look of shock, hands firmly on hips.
Draco had to agree with that, but… “Within the pre-specified parameters, of course,” he added.
This time, Goldie and Paris joined in the laughter.
“My fellow Americans, our country is one marred by division and discord,” she spoke quickly to make sure she didn’t run out of time. “I am Paris Davenport, and if elected, I will bring teamwork back to the White House. My campaign slogan is, ‘Paris Will Take One For The Team.’ But that’s not just a slogan. It’s a promise.” She nodded seriously at the moderators.
“So, Draco,” Crabbe asked, “Found anyone who might fulfill your little prophecy?”
“I think we’ve found the last remaining queen in the entire world who had no idea how microphones work.”
be my son, and I love you.”
,” she answered. Her accent was still awful enough to make all the British people on set cringe.
Draco wondered what would happen if the Wizengamot decided that she couldn’t use Malfoy as a name anymore. Would it just be a ban on professional use? Could she still sign her name as Draco Malfoy on legal documents? Would she need to sit through some complicated ritual designed to magically erase the name from her existence? Would they obliviate her?
“‘I LUV TACOS LOL,’” Harry read aloud. “There’s another post that just has a question mark,” he said. “Here’s one that’s an ad for shoes. Merlin’s beard, this is just a stream of meaningless junk! How is anyone supposed to make any sense of it?”
Queens squealed in excitement as they lifted box lids.
So here Draco was, getting herself back into drag — this time for a magical audience. And Teddy — Harry's godson and Draco's little cousin Teddy, who was way too young for the gay nightlife, was still very much excited about drag. Draco guessed it had something to do with being a metamorphmagus and finding a potential outlet for his natural gifts. In any case, Draco was talked into letting the boy keep him company while he got ready for the show. Draco liked Teddy, but he hadn’t anticipated how much
will write a story about it.”
—Flashback—
“I think Steve is going to be in the bottom, too,” Intoxia said. “Her Statue of Liberty was a total mess.” She adjusted her own Liberty crown, as if to prove hers the superior look. Acacia raised an eyebrow at her from under her own, more elaborate Lady Liberty crown.
Sneak Peek for Episode 4:
“This is absolutely terrifying,” Lorena confessed. “I am a
“That was it?” Scorpius asked.
After what felt like forever, the queens finally entered the werkroom to start their day of filming Episode 4. They engaged in some idle chitchat before RuPaul’s voice filled the room.
Lady Cakes blinked up at the ceiling before nodding her head in resignation.
“Amen!” The queens all cried from the back of the stage.
surprise her were the sickles and knuts that a few wizards and witches tossed onto the stage during her number.
The queens dashed to their stations and began tearing through outfits and makeup. Draco wasn’t sure exactly what constituted “country realness,” so he started slathering on eye makeup and lipstick while watching the other queens for ideas. Eventually she decided that she had a pair of jeans and a button-down shirt that would work if she tied the shirt ends together at her midriff.
Lady Cakes’ eyebrows raised in interest.
Seven-year-old Teddy Lupin twirled around Draco’s “drag room” at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place while Draco transfigured longer, thicker eyelashes at the vanity.
Here’s a short article on the mask designs for the movies. They’re really beautiful with a lot of subtle details, though it’s difficult to see them for very long in the movies themselves. (And I might have enjoyed playing on the idea of why the masks changed between fourth and fifth year… :-) https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/death-eater-masks-and-costumes
The next morning, Auror Heather Villareal was waiting for him at the San Adra Quidditch Park when Draco went out for his morning fly.
? If so, it would make sense that they would all react so strongly upon seeing the how-to book.
“Then why did it take them so long? I mean, I was just seven and a quarter then. I’m practically eight now. I could have grown old and died, waiting for this!” He pressed the back of his wrist against his forehead and fell back into another death drop. The Black family's legacy of melodrama had not skipped a generation in Teddy.
After Ivana Mann’s elimination, the queens reentered the werkroom. Draco removed the henge from her belt and stepped out of the circle, grateful to lose the extra weight from her costume.
RuPaul nodded, then changed the topic. “Now, a little bird told me that you have a daughter now.”

“What you do is you business. At least you didn’t butt in when it was my turn!”
Herb Kong sighed. “You certainly weren’t subtle,” he said. “We’ve discussed it, and under the circumstances, what you’ve said and done today still passes for believable as far as no-mags are concerned.”
“Kali Sister, tonight on the runway, you command attention. But in the magic act, you...disappeared. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
. “Say, I need to tell Harry something. Care to join me?”
“It’s part of it.”
“I’ve never heard of so many owls being in the city before,” Venus wondered.
“Welcome, ladies,” RuPaul began, once all the queens were lined up on the stage. "I’ve made some decisions. Team Paris...Condragulations, you are the winning team.” Paris, Acacia, Ivana, Cindy, Goldie, and Lorena all sighed in relief while Team Venus applauded in polite disappointment.
Draco raised his eyebrows in surprise. How long had it been since he had last spoken with either of them? He hadn’t even been aware that they were having marital problems.
“Let’s kick things off with opening statements. Venus Flygirl,” RuPaul continued.
—At the Viewing Party—
Draco was about to respond when Venus Flygirl called out to all the queens in the lobby.
Draco frowned in confusion. “What the—”
“Shit!” Ivana screamed.
—Early on the day of the Viewing Party—
“And turn some tricks on the side!” Goldie added.
“Morning, Racers!” RuPaul’s face appeared on the large television screen. The queens gathered round to listen. “My queens, are you ready for the future? It’s time for you to look deep within yourselves and find that special talent you possess. Then lift your magic wands and say, ‘Abra Cadabra! Hocus Pocus, bring this talent into focus!’ Hee hee!”
“It’s a viewing party. We filmed the episode last summer.”
“Paris Davenport, condragulations! You are the winner of this week’s challenge,” RuPaul told her. Paris cried into her Sphinx paws in her joy. “You have won an all-expenses-paid Caribbean cruise through Gayze Abroad Travel Company.”
“Is that really the camera?” Draco gasped at the all-too-familiar voice. “Oh! How novel!” Draco clasped both hands over her mouth as she stared at the screen in shock.
had mostly been favorable and brought in more witches and wizards to the viewing parties, which afforded Draco more bookings.
Potter just looked at him in surprise, a look that quickly morphed into one of speculation. Draco blushed and turned away.
“I was apprehensive at first, because we hadn’t gotten along at all when we were in school,” Draco added. He looked down at their joined hands. “But I understood some of what you were going through. And I was just as lonely, all by myself in this giant manor.” he gestured with his free hand at the walls around them.
“Hmm, sorry, not a match. Let’s turn now to Mary Berry. Are you all right, there, Mary?” RuPaul asked as Draco swayed in her seat, sloshing her giant glass of chardonnay. The contents had dropped considerably since the start of the game.
“You have won a set of custom eyewear by Madame LeSpecs, along with a $2,000 gift card for Nails by Floyd.” RuPaul informed her. Ivana clapped in delight.
—At the Viewing Party—
“Of course not,” he replied. He minded quite a bit, actually, but knew better than to tell her that.
“And if you can do that, how could you go wrong?” RuPaul added.
Draco closed his eyes in concentration, then waved his wand over his head and spoke.
“How do I look?” Teddy asked excitedly.
Without another word, Draco went back inside and sat silently among the other queens in the Untucked lounge while Acacia and Cindy yelled at each other. Draco wasn’t even paying attention to what the argument was supposedly about. She suspected the ample free cocktails might have had something to do with it, though.
Her left hand, looking more masculine without the longer, polished nails of her right hand, reached up to her right shoulder and pushed. Draco swiveled with the movement to face the other direction, showing only his left side.
“I imagined a table, not lipstick!”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Harry took the card with a roll of his eyes.
” Draco explained.
Draco spent much of the next day ensconced in the Malfoy Manor’s extensive library surrounded by books on rituals dealing with ghosts. He wasn’t entirely sure why he was so willing to help Crabbe move on. Maybe it was because Crabbe had been so helpful to him during their Hogwarts years, when Draco was young and felt like he needed a bodyguard. Maybe he felt that helping Crabbe was the least he could do after forcing him to polyjuice into a first-year girl so often while he was fixing the vanishing cabinet in Sixth Year. Or maybe he didn’t fancy the endless haunting Crabbe would inevitably pursue until he got his way.
“That’s it — it’s broken,” Weasley declared.
“I can tell Lorena is still feeling a certain type of way,” Kali Sister commented. “After that last challenge, she knows she’s struggling, so she wants to see some of the other girls come down a peg.”
“I actually liked the ‘slag flag’ concept,” Kumail added. “Did she have a great outfit? No, but she can think creatively to try and bullshit her way past it, and that has to count for something, right?”
Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts), Pretty Woman - Cindy
, Draco! Hash
Happy for the distraction, Draco pulled a small notebook and pen from out of the top of her dress and opened the book to a page in the middle, prepared to take notes. “Go on,” she said.
“Okay, what happened?” Goldie asked.
Katya stepped out from behind the partition and posed theatrically. “Hello!” The queens cheered.
Intoxia and Kali entered the werkroom in poor spirits that morning and remained quieter than usual as they prepared their runway looks.
“I do not think about death ‘a lot,’” Draco retorted. Well. Maybe a little. Like how it was bloody
Draco blushed. “Then my life-debt to you has been paid. Happy to have been of service.”
She looked unimpressed with his displeasure as she reexamined his luggage. “Better,” she sniffed. She Conjured long strips of some type of sticker with muggle flight information and fastened one onto the handle of each suitcase.
“There’s more, I’m afraid,” Simmons continued. “The prosecution argued that further confusion between the Malfoy name and your drag career necessitates a more...legal separation.”
The sound of a whip cracked deafeningly through the room. Harry looked up to see Malfoy, shirtless, dressed only in tight black leather pants and gleaming black patent boots. Harry would have gaped, were it not for the ball gag in his mouth. He struggled uselessly against the handcuffs on his wrists.
“Oh, hon, I think you’re beautiful just the way you are,” special guest judge Dolly Parton cooed. Draco smiled and winked at her.
“Nevertheless, I think I can help,” Malfoy continued. “I have an opening tomorrow morning at ten. Come to my office with your papers from the Ministry and the Black estate, and I’ll see what I can do. Can’t have the Savior of the Wizarding World fall behind on his taxes!” He grinned and handed Harry a small card with his floo address.
“Lady Cakes, you are a divine comedienne,” RuPaul said, “But tonight, your performance was a tragedy. I’m sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination.”
She kissed Draco’s cheek and pulled away. “Keep fighting, Draco. You have more supporters than I think you realize.”
“I’m Paris.”
good. Too good, in fact, for Draco to have much hope of winning.
“Fine,” Scorpius sighed. This was already shaping up to be a great bonding experience.
” as she landed.
After everyone had changed and left the studio, Draco found himself riding back to the hotel with Lady Cakes, Kali Sister, Venus Flygirl, Steve Donovan, and Goldie Hanako.
“Well, hello there, Draco!” RuPaul greeted as he and Warren approached Draco’s work table. “Tell me, how are you planning to approach the Frock the Vote challenge?”
“This wasn’t my time to go,” Queenie Q cried. “I know my look wasn’t that great, but I’m so much prettier and I have so much more I wanted to show the judges! Oh well, look for me on YouTube and subscribe to my channel!”
—Confessional—
the brattier corner of his mind thought,
“Hey Ladies!” RuPaul’s voice called to the queens from the large television screen on the wall after everyone had assembled in the werkroom. “What’cha got cookin’? Every queen worth her salt knows how to cook up a good look. But do you have it in you to really take the cake? Why, I don’t know about you, but I’ve got a little something in my lovin’ oven!”
—Confessional—
“I WON A CHALLENGE!” Kali punched his fists in the air in victory.
Draco shrugged. “They must have been before my time.”
“Actually, I was kinda wondering if you could hook me up with a ghost,” the person behind the partition said.
“It needs to be funny, too,” Lady Cakes added.
“We’re going to have a ball — and it’s Queens! Queens! Queens across the world!” RuPaul announced.
“Ooh!” special guest judge Allison Hannigan breathed.
“Oh, no ma’am,” Goldie whispered.
“All right, just between us squirrelfriends, what do you think?” RuPaul asked the other judges. “Let’s start with Draco.”
Draco pouted. “Can’t you take the day off? Time is of the essence if I’m going to submit my application video by the end of the month.”

After a few minutes of scuffling around the set, the trio was ready to film their commercial. They stood together and faced the camera, Lorena and Draco draped on either side of Lady Cakes. Draco held the platter of chicken in front of the three of them.

Draco blinked. Could that really be poss—
with no intentions of actually trying to win. His primary objective had been to get enough public attention to shame his father for disowning him. His presence on the muggle show alone was enough to accomplish that.

“We could sit in the dining room if you prefer.”
Draco gave her a bemused frown. “How would
After watching the losing queen write something on a mirror with lipstick and cry at the camera while clutching a figurine in a long-clawed hand, Draco turned back to Harry. “Are there any more episodes of this?”
Seconds after she posted this photo, it gained nine likes, and rightly so — she had cast
Draco dropped his jaw. “I— “
“Draco,” Venus approached him as he was trying on his yellow plaid outfit to make adjustments. “I was wondering if we could go over some of your Cher characterizations.”
The queens ran to their stations and hurriedly began rifling through wardrobe options. Draco had no idea what Election Day Eleganza was meant to look like. Fortunately, he had decided to dress in a more simple outfit for the workroom that day — just a salmon pink suit jacket and trousers, cream-colored shirt, and opalescent bow tie — so it took less effort to change clothes for the challenge.
Draco was unprepared for the tight hug as Goldie threw his arms around him. He gently hugged back. He had never been around so many people who so freely shared platonic affection with each other before he came to
“Ms. Davenport, your closing statement.”
I hope folks weren’t too disappointed in the Rusical! It was definitely a challenge for me to write, and after a lot of writing everything BUT the Rusical number, I ended up putting a lot of movie quotes in a blender and trying to shape the resulting mush into something resembling a narrative. This chapter kept getting to be so “extra” about so many other things, so the number itself took a bit of a hit creative-wise. But I’m already working on Snatch Game, so hopefully that will turn out a little more cohesive than this one. If anyone is interested, here are the parts picked out for the ‘80s team, which I didn’t really cover:

“It gave her a letter, and she got to pet it. It was really kind of cute,” Steve explained.
“Oh, do you want us to give a Spice Girls pose, maybe?” Courtney suggested. “You be Posh and I’ll be Baby Spice. Tell me what you want, what you really, really want!”
Malfoy’s office was not what Harry expected --- full of sunlight, plants, and a small tabletop water fountain in one corner. On one wall he had framed his diploma from Hogwarts as well as another certificate proclaiming him a Certified Accountant of the Wizarding World, Junior Class.
Kali had repeated everything Draco said, word for word, under her breath. Draco put down the contour brush and glared at the other queen.
” Acacia cried. “OhmygodOhmygodOhmygodOhmygod!!!” Acacia pointed to a spot on the worktable and moved to stand on a chair at the other end. Goldie, Paris, Intoxia, and Steve all screamed and backed away quickly.
“Now, for this week’s main challenge,” RuPaul continued, “You will all be serving us your best jokes in a stand-up routine before a live audience!” RuPaul laughed as the queens groaned. “To help you create a winning routine, you’ll each take a ten-minute, one-on-one comedy workshop with legendary funny man, Bruce Vilanch.
The queens cheered. “Yes!”
you!”
Draco frowned.

“Ladies and Gentlemen, I am Kali Sister, coming to you from Middle America, and if elected, I will be the first South Asian drag queen president of the United States. I will spice up our country with delicious dal curries and hot Bhangra beats. America: go from bland to grand.”
She changed into an iridescent green dragonhide bodysuit, a large pink feather boa, and black thigh-high boots. Her wig was a shoulder-length mass of wavy curls.
Instead of reading off the accountant’s information, however, Pendleton threw a pinch of floo powder into the fire and called a name Harry would have least suspected.
And yet, this was a competition. Draco needed to compartmentalize these feelings and put his cunning to the sticking place if he wanted to avoid getting sent home in the next challenge. It was time to get back to his Slytherin roots and think strategically about winning.
He had been loved by one or two women, Astoria and possibly Myrtle. It was true that he had since come to feel that he hadn’t really loved Myrtle back, but she had cared about him, at least, and Trelawney hadn’t specified that the love had to be reciprocated. That was it, then.
anymore, so she has a bit more time to indulge in a favourite hobby,” Draco replied, lifting his hand up to his mouth to pantomime taking a drink. Kali muttered again.
Draco stopped his broom and turned to face her. “That was an accident.”
do you have two heads? For that matter, why do you have three arms and three legs?”
“My cosplay look is Aethelwynne,” Draco explained. “She’s an antique ceramic doll from
“You’ve won a $1500 credit on AppSpaz. That’s
Draco sipped her cocktail. Maybe Kali had been desperate for help. That still didn’t give her the right to ask for a favor the way she had.
“When in doubt, maybe it doesn’t hurt to deify the boss,” Draco shrugged.
“We all gotta come out sooner or later,” Cindy commented. “When you’re a drag queen, there’s no sense in trying to keep anything in the closet. My family doesn’t care, either about the drag or about being trans. My sister helps me sew some of my outfits,” she added. “Draco, how about you?”
!” George Takei grinned.
“It was supposed to be a surprise,” his right head continued. “As you can see, I still have some work to do.”
The yellow light had changed to red and a buzzer sounded.
“Well. I’ll have these files delivered to your hotel room,” Simmons said, and got up from the table. She stopped at the door, turning back to him. “I really am sorry.” With that, she was gone.
“Reason for traveling?” she asked.
. Most of the book was utterly worthless, but there was a small section in the back on troubleshooting things that could go wrong with creating horcruxes — like when the person who had been killed in the process of creating a horcrux came back to haunt the creator. Apparently, there was a way to make the ghost go away without too much effort.
At the front of the runway, Draco spun around once before pretending to dip, her right side facing forwards while arching backwards gracefully. She rose back up and tangoed out to the right side of the stage, then spun and tangoed to the left side and bowed. Draco then tangoed back to the middle and performed an elaborate triple spin before tangoing back up and offstage.
He handed Draco a glittering green-gold cocktail with a stir that had a tiny silver mitten on the tip. “Just remember, don’t take Pansy too seriously.”
mad!” Michelle retorted. “Look, it’s been three weeks, and you’ve given us the same shape every time you come out here. I’m starting to get bored.”
Villareal was silent for a moment, seeming to consider this.
“Bitch, all you kids are making me feel old today!” RuPaul laughed and shook his head. He then gave Draco a quick tutorial on how to lift the handle from the receiver, and which end to hold in front of his mouth and which to hold up to her ear. The figure behind the partition laughed.
And then Potter almost killed him, and he thought he was going to become a ghost right there in Myrtle’s bathroom after all.
“Hmm, is there more besides taking the Dark Mark and joining a criminal gang? Attempted murder of your school principal, serious injuries of your classmates, use of two out of three unforgivable curses?” Villareal waved her hand, unimpressed. “We have quite a file on you already in our department, but I’m always up for a good story. Please feel free to share if there’s more we should know.”
A glittering silver heel on the right foot peeked around his left leg, revealing bare skin from the slit in the feminine gown. The leg curled around the left knee, then the whole body swiveled until Draco was facing fully front, showing both right and left sides to the judges.
“Lady Cakes McMansion, condragulations, you are the winner of this week’s challenge.”
Draco wished the judges would bloody well hurry up with judging the unsafe queens so they would come back and distract the room from Draco’s muggle studies notes.
Draco glared at him. “What does that have to do with any—”
Draco sat delicately on the edge of a fainting couch. In front of her, a tea set complete with a platter of chocolate cake and tea for two sat on a little tea table.
“Can I take that one?” Draco piped up. “I think I can do something with it.”
“Come on, Malfoy. Eat a weenie.” Potter speared one of the tiny sausages on an equally tiny toothpick and placed it on a napkin, holding it out to him. “
An hour later, the queens walked into the werkroom in boy garb, most of them in jeans and T-shirts or tank tops that advertised drag queen personas. Draco wore a wide-sleeved white button-down shirt with ruffled cuffs, tucked into a fitted pale blue waistcoat and light grey trousers. He had tied a grey silk ascot around his neck, fastened in place with a sapphire tie pin.
“Lorena Gucci, your opening statement.”
“Have you never seen the show before, bitch?” Venus laughed.
“But her look on the runway didn’t do it for me,” Michelle complained.
He had taken a break for a few minutes to use the loo when Crabbe manifested himself halfway through the door.
“Now more than ever, it’s important for everyone to perform their civic duty,” RuPaul said. “Right now, only one in five LGBTQ Americans is registered to vote. So for this week’s mini challenge, I want you to inspire us all with a photo shoot in your Election Day Eleganza! You have twenty minutes to get into quick drag. And, GO!”
Draco’s lips thinned into a hard line. “Cake,” he muttered.
’ from the bed on my right.” Draco could hear more laughter now.
Crabbe gestured over towards Moaning Myrtle, who was watching the scene as if she only needed a bucket of popcorn to be fully entertained by this sudden argument.
,” Cindy breathed. “Dude, how are we supposed to paint our faces like this?”
Harry huffed and went back to patrolling the pub. Draco couldn’t worry about what people might think at the moment. The episode was already recorded and the wizarding world was going to find out how far the magic would go, as stoppable as a train.
“That’s so stupid,” said Crabbe. “Ghosts aren’t that dumb.” This only made the ladies laugh harder. Aunt Aura fell sideways in midair and clutched at her sides.
“I’m sorry I haven’t been there for you throughout this ordeal,” Narcissa whispered. “Your fa—
“Er—”
“Right, that means something else to you Brits, huh?” Lady Cakes laughed. “For what it’s worth, your Stonehenge look was stunning.” She nodded towards the corner where Draco had stashed her henge.
Others tittered in amusement when they saw the tricks the queens were learning.

because she shows a lot of body, and I thought I would only have to say ‘Multipass!’ once or twice. But then I got the script, and it’s like she’s speaking a kind of made-up language, and I just thought, ‘Fuck,’” Venus explained to the judges in her defense, beaded fringe shaking all over her studded purple leotard as she gestured nervously.
“Katya, do you have any words of wisdom for your

“It’s okay, you can spit it out if you don’t like it,” he said. “At least you tried it. It was worth it just to see your face.”

“Great, you’re Cher. Intoxia, you take Rose. Steve, how do you feel about playing Ellie Sattler from
“That’s Ursa Minor.” Draco pointed up to the top shelf of the storage unit next to his costume rack, where the stuffed koala sat and modeled a long, white-blonde wig.
This was a half truth, of course. She wasn’t about to say anything here about Merlin or Circe, either.
“She’s a legendary British baker.”
“I see you two already know each other!” Pendleton clapped his hands together in delight. “Capital!”
Lorena, who was walking in front of them, turned around and laughed. “How do you get tickets for that?"
The camera ended the interview and panned back to the werkroom, where an excited look flashed over Draco’s eyes. “Will we ever win badges as prizes on this show?” he asked RuPaul.
Previously on DDR: Draco plays Umbridge at the Viewing Party, Mary Berry in the Snatch Game, and a broken antique doll named Aethelwynne in the cosplay runway challenge. He wins the mini challenge because playing seeker on a quidditch team is apparently great training for dodgeball. Kali Sister learns that accents are hard.
As long as she was going to live among muggles, compete against muggles, and – if she didn’t
“Arf! Arf!” Goldie Hanako barked playfully and laughed even as she tore off her ginger wig and flung herself onto the workroom sofa.
“What?” Ross asked, shocked. “You and I agree about something?!”
He had always been a Malfoy. He had been a Malfoy when the name commanded respect in the wizarding community. He had been a Malfoy after the war, when the name inspired hatred among those same people who had previously respected it. Even after being disowned, he had felt entitled to use the name. How could he identify as anyone else?
“Usually, I get no complaints, but now I’m thinking someone’s gonna speak to my manager.”
Steve as Ellie Sattler was dressed in a sloppy button-down shirt and jeans, her hair in a messy blonde bun. She lifted two toy wingless dragons up in the air and lip synced, “Dinosaurs eat man, woman inherits the earth!”
“She must have been intrigued by the challenge because she did it,” Harry continued. “
“Did any of you ever think about going into politics when you were little?” Venus asked.
“Can you take me shopping in Soho tomorrow? There are some stores that sell makeup and pads and such that I’ll need. Also, I’ll need a muggle sewing machine. I need to know how to sew the muggle way. Do you suppose Granger knows how to use one?”
Zula (Grace Jones), Conan the Destroyer - Paris
“Hey Umbridge, does the Ministry know you’re here?”
Draco felt like he had been punched in the stomach.
“If you couldn’t make Carrie Fisher funny, maybe you should have chosen someone else to impersonate. I thought about doing Lizzo,” Lady Cakes admitted. “She is glamorous, talented, and bootyful!” The others laughed as she made a hand gesture toward her own generous figure. “But I had trouble making her funny when I practiced it, so I went with Nicole Byer instead.”
“Right! Why should the boys have all the fun?” Millicent added.
Draco smiled. “Yes, I do! I have two.”
“I agree,” Draco grinned. “Now, I really must begin to get ready for tonight’s show. Will you be there?”
“We could all tell she was having a hard time, and she chose to take out her own feelings on others by picking fights,” Lorena added.
“Next month,” Draco answered. “I’m preparing some numbers that haven’t been performed at the viewing parties yet. Teddy will have his lip sync debut as the opening act.”
country dance,” Draco explained. But then she stopped hopping and leaned forward, twerking for all she was worth. Her wig flew off and landed in an undignified heap.
Later on, Draco walked onto the recording set with Lorena and Lady Cakes. They were each dressed in matching black corsets and knickers, fishnet stockings, heels, and blonde wigs in chin-length starlet curls.
Reactions to Draco’s magic performance were mixed. Several people in the audience cheered; a few even catcalled.
“I’m not being mean,” Lorena continued. “I’m just telling the truth.”
“Hello, Granger-Weasley,” Draco replied. “I was hoping to talk with the three of you, actually.” He looked at Potter and Weasley in turn. Weasley looked up from his food. “And Goyle,” he added. Goyle looked up and came closer to their little circle.
“And here we are now,” Draco grinned, holding both of his hands around Harry’s. “Two old coots.”
—Confessional—
Goldie, Venus, Lady Cakes, and Steve all burst into raucous laughter.
—At the Viewing Party—
Potter then had the audacity to laugh. “What, didn’t you read about it in the papers? We got a divorce.”
“Can I ask you something?” Draco asked.
with syrup.”
“Old enemies turned into something more,” Potter added. He leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on Draco’s lips. Before long, tea and breakfast had been forgotten.
“Let’s just say she’ll enjoy a good tipple. Maybe a few of them.”

Harry scrolled through the messages anyway. “Lots of photos of blokes holding up twenty-pound notes,” he said, making a face, then looked appraisingly at a dick pic.

Jason Isaacs thought for a moment. “I think they would hang
“Thanks, Acacia! This is a basic hangover potion that anyone can make at home.” Acacia shot her a bemused look.
Several members of the audience laughed along with Draco. Harry, who had been monitoring the pub for any sign of a threat, worked his way back to the side where Draco was sitting and whispered in his ear.
“Well,” she continued. “Let’s get on with it, then. At least in this space, we won’t have much clutter getting in our way.”
Draco dressed in a floral-print blazer with a pale pink scarf and ear-length gray-blonde bob. She had painted her face with lines to imitate the wrinkles of an octogenarian woman. Next to a name card that read “Mary Berry” in a pretty cursive was an oversized wine goblet that appeared to hold an entire bottle of chardonnay.
“I’ll eat that if you don’t,” Goyle said.
Goyle shrugged and began to pile the tiny sausages onto his plate. It was a bit of a balancing act given the amount of food he already had piled on there, but this was one of the arenas in which Goyle was a shining star of skilldom.
Draco coughed. It wasn’t a delicate cough, either.  It was more like his saliva had launched backwards in an attempt to choke him to death in order to avoid further embarrassment.
“Now, ladies!” RuPaul called the queens back to attention. “For this week’s maxi challenge, you’ll need to razzle dazzle, mystify, and amaze — as you star in your very own...
Draco grinned. After the day he’d had, a pub crawl sounded perfect. The queens poured themselves into his room.
” Emma Watson, Jason Isaacs, and Draco all cringed at her accent. She held up a card with
Lady Cakes rolled her eyes. “Girl, really?”
“Draco! Watch me! Look, I can death drop! Draco! Are you watching?” Teddy flopped backwards onto the floor. “Did you see it?”
Draco’s read of Paris: “A Davenport is meant to be sat on, but if your lady bits are burning, I’m afraid of catching a disease.” [The lady bits are a reference to Notre Dame, which burned recently, haha? It's too soon, right? Yes, this one was a bit of a reach, and probably in poor taste. ;-) My French is terrible, so please excuse any weirdness Google Translate might have brought to this mix.]
Goyle picked up the candle and grinned up at Crabbe. “Guess we can’t get rid of you that easily,” he said. “I would have really missed our literary discussions if you were gone for good.”
of you.”
“They say that I have to figure out back taxes for the Black estate, plus the three years since I’ve been seventeen, within the next two weeks. If I don’t, they say they’re going to audit me, charge me ten thousand galleons in fines, and post a notice in the Prophet about my negligence.” Harry buried his face in his hands. “I don’t even know where to begin!”
“No, he’s over there,” the ginger pointed across the Great Hall. Sure enough, he could see Crabbe’s ghostly form laughing with Theo Nott at the bar, his hands waving wildly. Draco slapped his palm to his forehead and grimaced.
“Sure,” Harry grinned, “And maybe a lipstick table to go with it. But you were going to tell me a story. No more sidetracks.”
The magician held up a matchbook and stared intently at it. He waved his other hand, and suddenly the matchbook burst into flames.
Draco sighed. He pushed his breakfast and tea across the table and gently banged his head against it in frustration.
Sticking out from the hem of her dress was the wand attached to her thigh with a holster which was charmed to make itself and the wand invisible to muggles. Similarly hidden was the Dark Mark on her left forearm, which had faded to an ashy grey after the war. A glamour charm luckily covered the rest of it — to muggles, anyway.
be returning to the monarchy.” She gave Draco a stern look.
“Oh, yes, of course.” Draco had no clue who that was.
“If you must,” he acquiesced. “I have no further use for it.”
“All right, Draco—, it’s your turn!”
“Really!” Kali now turned to smirk at Draco. Draco was taken aback when the other queen winked at him.
“WHOAHOHOHOHOHO!!!” Nicole laughed. “I
Draco studied them both. Millicent nodded with a shrug. Granger’s expression, on the other hand, dangerously approached the determination that she usually reserved for liberating house elves, standing up to Death Eaters, and slapping h— no, it was better not to risk her ire.
The runway theme that week was 1940s Pinup Models. Most queens wore swimsuits, short shorts, or negligees with wigs styled in shoulder-length starlet curls.

“It’s too quiet in here,” Paris declared at one of the stillest moments. “Someone start running their sewing machine so we can at least have some white noise.”
headache?” Blaise grinned.
Last week on DDR: Draco discovered social media, healed Lady Cakes' wrists, gave Goldie four eyebrows in a mini-challenge makeover, faked an orgasm in a chicken commercial, told everyone she'd been disowned, did the Gemini Tango on the runway, won the main challenge with Lady Cakes and Lorena, received a couple owls in front of muggles, and found out she's getting sued by Lucius.
Draco moved away from the desk to sit next to him on the sofa and took both Harry’s hands in his own. “Harry,” he started, “this is something I need to do. I’m going to be a drag queen, and I’m
“I think Draco got picked last because she’s the least experienced of any queen here,” Ivana explained to the camera. “I may be older, but I have more performance experience than all of these bitches combined, and they know that. Aside from some acrobatics, there’s no telling what Draco has to offer.”
“Oh, that,” Villareal waved her hand dismissively. “Yes, I suppose as long as
, Draco thought. She narrowed her eyes and fixed the other queen with a calculating look. Who was she to take over Draco’s photo shoot?! Sure, Draco was less experienced, but she knew that she needed to be the one in charge here if she wanted to stay in the competition.
“Ladies!” RuPaul announced, “I have made my decision.” Both queens faced her stoically.
After a minute, Draco looked back at Harry, who was still frowning at the phone. He must have at least opened the app, because he appeared to be scrolling.
to know that the photo shoot challenge often got messy.
“I suppose you all need to hear this,” he said. He took another deep breath.
“Let’s hear your Awkwafina,” Lady Cakes joined in.
A knock on the door preceded Harry’s entrance, followed by Hermione Granger and Millicent Bulstrode. They waved in greeting as Harry smiled at Draco and hissed.
This week: The queens get ready to impersonate movie characters in an epic lip-syncing, pole-dancing Rusical! How will Draco get along in a group challenge?
“Sorry, that’s not a match,” RuPaul continued. Draco-as-Mary-Berry shrugged and drained the last of her wine.
Paris nodded. “The struggle is real,” she said. “I’m used to winning pageants. This gig is a lot harder!”
“Women
Draco pointed to a few badges pinned to his grey button-down shirt.
“Paris and Goldie, definitely,” Venus decided. “Did you see Goldie’s Anime Statue of Liberty? That was
“What do you think they’ll have us do today?” Goldie wondered.
Goyle chuckled. “I bet he’d want to see you,” he grinned.
“Did you grow up without a TV?” Carson asked.
Harry had been horrified, of course. But Draco knew better. Obviously, it was meant to decorate a shelf, not get abused by some grubby-handed child.

“Mind if I fly with you for a bit?”

“Absolutely horrifying,” Harry answered. “
in your hotel room?” Intoxia asked, pointing at the Nimbus 2001 propped in the corner by the window.
Draco pulled a hand away from her face and looked down at the wet streak of mascara on her finger. She stood up suddenly with newfound determination. “I’ve got to fix my makeup.”
Once all the queens were changed, they were led one by one to a stage with a large, heavy-looking metal door.
“Oooh! Everybody, shush! We’re getting a message!” Ivana exclaimed suddenly as filming assistants wheeled a large screen into the lounge. All conversation was forgotten as Carmelita received a recorded video message from her parents. Draco tuned it out, knowing she would never get such a message herself.
Lily sighed, shook her head, and poured herself another drink. “Dad, don’t you two have any stories that aren’t about sex?”
“What do you think about Lady Cakes McMansion?” RuPaul asked.
,” Millicent added. “Can I borrow your Auror uniform?”
” Intoxia cried. “At this stage of the competition, we’ve all been cloistered away without any sex in, like,
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Or something,” he replied. He was something of an expert at sun protection charms, especially since arriving in Southern California. The sun here felt much more intense than it had ever felt in England.
“Ivana Mann, Kali Sister, and Goldie Hanako, you will create an ad for ShadyRu, my new line of designer sunglasses.” He pointed to a tray of sunglasses on the third tray.
“That’s right! For this week’s maxi challenge, you will each present three different looks on the runway. Hash tag: #DragRace.
Draco rushed to figure out what a muggle psychic would look like, then shrugged and threw on a mishmash of shawls and scarves with a ratty cardigan and skirt.
Lady Cakes hooted with laughter. “You know, I’m a big girl so we all knew I was gonna get knocked out first. I don’t mind because now I get to watch, but honey, I need popcorn, ‘cuz we got some major martial arts dance off going on in here!”
“Hoedown!” RuPaul exclaimed. “I repeat: we have a ho down!”
“Really.” Draco thought his friend might have spent a little too much time reading novels, but kept that thought to himself.
“What about her runway look?” RuPaul asked.
“Aethelwynne,” Draco corrected. “And no, it’s a real book.”
Ivana laughed. “Honey, you haven’t spent much time in the clubs, have you?”
“Oh honey, none of us do,” Paris laughed. “Just go with it.”
“Condragulations, my queens!” RuPaul continued afterward. “Oh, and remember — if you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love someone else? Can I get an amen!”
“Next, add a gram of powdered nutmeg, three diced asphodel leaves, one egg, twelve medium-length dog hairs, and seven millilitres of dittany extract.”
“Bend over, Potter,” Malfoy sneered as he tossed the whip into a corner. “You’re about to be
“Draco,” Michelle said once the judges shifted attention to her, “Tonight on the runway, you look great. That cooking skit, though.” She shook her head slowly. “It was all over the map. It didn’t make any sense to me.”
Draco threw her a nonchalant half-shrug. “I occasionally take notes,” she said.
Malfoy’s face turned a shade of pink that Harry hadn’t seen since their Hogwarts days. His nostrils flared slightly.
“Congratulations on your win, Miss Lady Cakes!” Paris Davenport grinned.
“I’m Goldie.”
“Never mind, you’ve at least got the right forms today,” Malfoy continued, he eyes focused on the papers in front of him. “Well, well,” he said, holding up the Gringotts form. “Three million, two hundred eighty-seven thousand, five hundred and twenty-three galleons to your name.
Venus squared her shoulders. “At the end of the day, I think the American people all want the same thing, and that is to feel like there is someplace where we can belong. And to me, that place is Party City. Vote for Venus, and we can
fault that Draco was so irresistible.
He grabbed Harry’s wrists and bent him over the edge of his desk, the sound muffled by the little water fountain in the corner. In one swift, adept move, he yanked down Harry’s trousers and pressed against him from behind.
“Draco,” RuPaul continued. Draco straightened her shoulders. “Hocus Pocus, you’re the witch with the mostest. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week’s challenge.”
“Move over, Hunties! Venus Flygirl is here to make you her prey!”
Draco waved her arms as a way to demonstrate that concept and struck a dramatic pose.
Dave pointed to the belt hanging next to Draco’s chair. “Grab that, stick the metal part into that slot,” he explained, pointing to a small box on the other side of the chair.
“So, what do you think they’ll have us do this week?” Paris asked. That was the cue for the television screen to turn itself on.
“And that she wasn’t sure if it would have been worth all the trouble for him, until he came in a week later with a shit-eating grin and that giant bouquet.”
“Potter, why did you bring these?”
“Finally, sign here to acknowledge receipt of my services and allow Gringotts to send me seventy-five galleons in payment thereof.”
—Confessional—
“Right,” Millicent continued. “So, what can you tell me about women in drag?”
“Do you have any idea how much money you have in your vaults? Even in the vaguest sense?” Malfoy asked.
“So I guess I have the look down,” Draco commented. She stood up and smoothed out her pink tweed suit. She hadn’t added extra padding for this look, but maybe it didn’t matter. “I’m still working on the voice, though. What do you think of this: tee hee!” she let out a dainty little giggle.
“Very well,” Draco acknowledged. He pulled the book out of his robe pocket. He then imagined a large, round table to give them a surface to work on.

Lorena looked unhappily resolved. Kali fell to her knees on the stage and sobbed.
the house down. What did you say?”
Draco smirked. “Do you still remember your 54th birthday?”
The queens cheered.
—Confessional—
The queens marched backstage and joined the others. Draco grabbed a cocktail and propped herself onto a stool, careful not to muss her slag flag.
The queens reentered the werkroom after Intoxia Madison’s elimination.
Previously on DDR (if you haven’t been here in [gulp] a year): Draco starts as an inexperienced queen with a rocky relationship with her muggle colleagues and a social media noob and gradually learns as she goes, about drag, muggle culture, and finding family. She came to the show using her full name as revenge for being disowned, but Lucius took him to the Wizengamot and Draco lost all rights to the name Malfoy. Draco’s magical drag family expands to include 8-year-old Teddy and Harry Gryffindor (Millicent Bulstrode), as well as her original drag daughters, Araneus the Spider and Ursa Minor, the stuffed koala.

knew that,” Draco chimed in. “And I’ve had the least experience of any of you. When I found out I was going to be on the show, I drilled myself every day,” she said. “Lip sync drills—” she clapped her hands — “makeup drills—” another clap— “sewing drills—”

. You have no idea how surprising that is.”
Lady Cakes sighed. “I was trying to go easy on my left wrist during the live performance, and that messed up the right one.”
“You can do it over there,” she pointed at the end of the table, completely unphased. She then turned her attention back to the line. “I can help who’s next!” she barked.
“Right, it was super confusing!” Michelle exclaimed. “What she said made no sense.”
wigs you keep wearing.” RuPaul doubled over in laughter.
“The sisters of Alpha Beta Gamma Omega Zeta Jones!” they chimed in unison. The audience clapped appreciatively as they each struck a pose.
“This isn’t just about a simple drag performance.” Granger had put the red dress back on the rack and placed her hand on her hip. “This is about female representation. This is about
as operational as I’d thought.”
“We’re all working on ideas for our stand-up routines and the workroom has
“Welcome back, Ladies! I’ve made some decisions,” RuPaul began. “Venus Flygirl, Draco, and Lady Cakes McMansion: the three of you flew to new heights in this competition, but one of you really took the cake.” The three queens looked at each other.
A hush fell over the werkroom as each contestant concentrated on their own costume constructions.
“Ms. McMansion,” Rachel Maddow moved on, “Politics can get so ugly. Can you give us an example of a time when you made peace with someone you didn’t see eye to eye with?”
“Benedict
“I don’t know,” he said after a moment.
“Steal their
“Right,” Malfoy said, schooling his features into professional indifference. “Show me your L-539, 4187-DFW, and 4817-WFD forms. Maybe I can make heads or tails of them.”
“Draco,” Narcissa choked, and reached her arms forward before stopping herself in uncertainty.
Araneus’ lipstick message on the mirror would just be a picture of a spider web with the words “SOME QUEEN.”
Draco scrunched his face in concentration. After a moment, his heads merged back into one. He breathed a heavy sigh of relief and briefly shook his arms and legs before stretching his left arm across his right side.
“This situation is far worse than I feared! Now you all need to settle down and respect my authority. I am a respectable witch from an ancient family. I’ll have you know that my third cousin is a pureblood!” The purebloods in the room laughed. Merlin, she even caught Granger chuckling at that one.
“Sure, let’s all hang out in the hallway for storytime,” Draco rolled his eyes.
“Pretty soon Venus and Draco are the last ones left, and they’re spinning around, bouncing through the air and it’s like some fierce lip sync gymnastics without the music....or the lip syncing,” Steve added.
The audience broke out in uncomfortable murmurs.
like pages in a book. He still couldn’t believe that he not only made it onto the show, but was still there after six eliminations.
Draco shook his head. “That’s stupid. I can’t believe it.”
“Really!” Granger huffed. “Did

Blaise grinned. “That’s why we’ve remained friends since Hogwarts.”
Kali beamed.
And just as suddenly, they had left the vehicle lot and barreled down a road in the bright sunlight. Draco only had a moment to marvel at the sight of palm trees before he noticed that there were
As the episode ended, Draco stepped onto the stage to work the crowd and perform a final number.
“I may be less experienced as a queen, but I know better than to let someone else take what is meant to be

“I love you,” Draco looked directly at the camera with a sultry expression and batted her false eyelashes. “You deserve so much more, luv.”
“Congratulations, honey,” Lady Cakes McMansion told her. “That was one devastating lip sync!”
“Draco is giving you Chun Li, she is literally flying through the air like Sonic the Hedgehog and rolling around on the floor doing some kind of sexy slithering dance,” Intoxia commented. “And I see Queenie just prancing around, patting her titties and pointing at the judges. Step it up, girl!”
Maybe he should have seen this coming. Lucius was not the type to sit back and let Draco take revenge for his disownment by making the Malfoy name famous as a drag queen. Eldritch Clearwater was the Malfoy family lawyer, the same one who had managed to keep Lucius out of Azkaban after the war. He was

them. They were quickly becoming important people in his life — muggle or no.
“I was a horrible prat,” Draco confessed.
One of the other queens at the worktable let out an ear-piercing shriek. “VENUS!” She squealed, running up to her and grabbing her in a bear hug.
Kai had, to her credit, not tried to create a witch look with warts, green skin, dripping blood, cobwebs, or other nonsense that the other queens had incorporated. She had instead opted for a bohemian-chic look with billowing, gauzy fabrics.
“Who?” Lorena asked.
As always, I appreciate all of your comments and kudos because they help inspire me to keep this thing rolling!
Acacia nodded once more before turning around and sashaying, stopping to get a giant hug from Paris before she left.
“Thanks,” Draco said.
“But the next time,” Harry continued, “There were silk sheets AND rose petals--”
“I don’t know where you’re going with this, but please tell me the Aurors were okay with it,” Harry begged in Draco’s ear.
The next morning, Draco’s alarm woke him up at five. It was a miserable hour to be up, but it would give him a little time to get some exercise before he had to be on set for the next episode. He quickly got dressed, grabbed his broom, thought about the destination as it had been described in the travel book, and disapparated.
“Now that is
“And I thought being a ghost was boring,” Crabbe made a show of flopping bodilessly onto a chair.
—At the Viewing Party—
“All right, DJ,” RuPaul announced after they all returned back to the empty space on one side of the workroom. “Hit it!”
“Very Marilyn,” RuPaul cooed as he ushered Draco in front of a green screen. He held up a camera and started taking photos while Draco posed. “Say, ‘Happy Birthday, Mr. President!’” RuPaul instructed.
“But there’s thirteen of us still here.” Steve Donovan looked confused.
Harry nodded and frowned at a pot of caramel that was burning on the hob.
Charity Burbage has told Aunt Aura everything she knows about Muggle movies about ghosts, including
“Two?” RuPaul looked impressed. “I heard about a spider,” he prompted.
“All right,” Draco said.
That left just Draco, Venus, and Carmelita in the bottom three.
“And our second contestant is legendary British actor, Jason Isaacs!”
“It’s time to break out your

Potter tapped his chin again, giving the ceiling a pensive stare. “Hmm,” he said, “You know, I might have died.”
? Sad, my ass! Does she think we forgot how she read Steve for filth in Untucked just a little while ago?”
“No, but that cocktail she threw at you didn’t make you any sweeter,” Draco answered.
“Maybe the room will provide—” Goyle started to suggest, but stopped when a rubber chicken materialized in his hand. “—Oh.”
“Get your own,” Potter answered more coldly than Draco would have expected, holding the napkin out of Goyle’s reach. And did he actually give Goyle the stinkeye?
The room was empty.
“Girl, did you mean Benedict Arnold?” Kali asked Lorena.
Just as suddenly as he appeared, Crabbe disappeared through the glass pane and out of sight.
“I’m not just a posh Brit,” Draco continued. “I’m also willing to rule over you like a queen.” She picked up a small British flag from her podium, waving it emphatically. “A vote for Draco is a vote for the British queen, and a return to the monarchy!”
“Oh.” Harry nodded slowly and tried his best to mask his disappointment.
The witch beamed at him. “Why,
Draco checked her direct messages. “GIRL! LOL WHERE YOU BEEN??????” Goldie had sent. Draco sent off a quick reply and navigated to her page information. Her jaw dropped.
Venus shrugged. “You can have it if you want it.”
” With that, RuPaul cackled, and the screen went to black.
Venus laughed. “Bitch, how much of a lightweight are you?” she pointed at the empty drink in Kali’s hand.
“Careful, Blaise, or you’ll let flies in,” Draco drawled.
Draco ran her free hand up one long leg and pouted. “Chicken thigh,” she sighed in her sultriest voice. Merlin, this was stupid.
“Goldie Hanako,” RuPaul continued, “You’re safe.” Goldie grinned and headed to the back.
