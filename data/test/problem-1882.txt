. Instead, he slanted his hips and let his free arm dangle--in no way hiding his boredom, despite manners dictating he should put on a brave face and bear it.
Harry released Draco's wrists with one hand while maintaining his hold with the other and rolled to the side so he was straddling Draco's thigh.
"Stop before you embarrass yourself, you silly man," Draco answered, but his viselike grip on Harry's hand betrayed the flippant jibe.
Hermione and Ron were in the kitchen where he'd left them, apparently haven broken into the wine while they waited. Their conversation went silent, their postures stiff when he and Draco entered. Beside him, Draco went equally rigid.
Moving with the speed and grace that could only come from years of training, Harry snagged Draco's wrist and put an arm around his waist and tumbled him into bed.
"Now either strip naked and bend over the desk or me over the desk (I don't care which) or should I leave?"
"The Garden Room? You mean that restaurant where you and your pet princess were attacked by Devil's Snare?" Ron stood from his desk with that bit of news. He had a feeling this was going to lead to picking the girl up and a lot of paperwork. "Are you certain it was the same woman who served you?"
Hey folks, playout here. My apologies for the long delay. Prinn had her stuff done ages ago. I'm the lame one. Sowee!
Harry tried a taste of the proffered ice cream. It was...not to his liking. (It was sort of sweet-bland, with an almost bitter aftertaste; he would have preferred something chocolate.) But that was quite all right. Draco could enjoy the whole thing.
"I decided to ask around to see if perhaps he might be using the situation to get close to you--since he did have that obsession with you back in the day--and I heard some pretty interesting stuff."
The rapid burst of questions wasn't how a victim/witness interview was supposed to go, but he was too excited to care.
Your father's story I know from several sources, including memories left behind with Dumbledore. My godfather allowed me access to them during his time as Headmaster and told me a few directly. At least the man changed into someone worthy of you and your mother before it was too late. I am sorry you never had a chance to know him--the world is cruel and unfair.
Potter's expression faltered. "That's just not fair," he whinged, succumbing to the desire to tickle Draco's downy pelt despite his protest. ...They both enjoyed it probably more than they should.
"It's not something I've done before,” Harry spat indignantly, “but I may have to start if the bleeding Prophet continues to stalk me at my workplace."
Draco wrapped himself in the protection of his most prideful bearing. He didn't do that often anymore, didn't feel the need to; it broke Harry's heart that he needed it now. "I have nothing but the noblest of intentions with Harry," he declared, tone clipped, posture ramrod straight, hands folded tightly in his lap.
Harry decided to leave work a bit early because Draco's anxiety over dinner had reached a fevered pitch. No matter how many times and how many different ways he tried to reassure him, Draco seemed certain the evening was going to be a disaster, so Harry packed up his work in progress, bid goodbye to Ron, and made his way home.
When the prat continued standing there, not inviting him in, Harry looked pointedly at the fat raindrops falling down around him and raised his brows.
So, what was wrong with Draco? Potter didn't seem to recognize him so it couldn't be their past... Was he too tall? His cologne too rich? ... Did he walk crooked and not notice?
Unlike the chocolates, I made these biscuits. And there's a loose-leaf Darjeeling to go with them. Good for the four o'clock slump.
Potter frowned flatly at him. "You think that's going to work a second time?" he said, tone dubious.
Of course he'd had this entire philosophical debate while thrusting against another man's erection--and enjoying it quite enthusiastically--so it was really a matter of splitting hairs.
Harry let Draco kiss him soundly, but only for a couple of seconds. They had an audience and he really wasn't one for PDA (though snogging Draco was always nice).
He pushed himself up onto his knees and curled his fingers against Draco's prostate in a 'come hither' gesture, which make Draco toss his head back into the pillows with a deep, delicious groan.
P.S. I wasn't kidding about not wanting foreign fluids on my desk, though. Absolutely no play anywhere on my side of the office.
"The lubricant with a warning label a full page long. 'Guaranteed to give three times the orgasms in a single romp'," he said, quoting the ribald advert for the product. "So, one becomes three, two becomes six, and so on. We're still young so we could rest between. Achieving thirteen in a day is entirely doable!"
He reached out his free hand toward the opening of Potter's top near his neck while the Auror was staring away from him to the crowd and gently grazed the skin he met with careful fingertips.
"I'm actually glad to hear you say that," he admitted. "I thought--Pansy said something that made me think--" he reconsidered the wisdom of bringing up the ill-fated conversation real time. "Nevermind. It's not important. What is important is what we could do now." His voice dropped into the lower register. "At the table, or on the couch, or in the bed," he purred. "You mentioned having ideas earlier about 'making me sweaty all over again'? Anything in particular or did you plan to just... Wing it?"
"Ah!" Draco tensed for just a second as the knot was pressed. It had apparently been ready to pop for some minutes and instantly released into smaller points of tension that crackled somewhat under Harry's fingers. The blonde breathed a deep sigh of contentment and sank even further into the tub until he was just at his earlobes.
Upon reaching the Atrium, he waved to the handful of people who said hullo and apparated to his doorstep, passing through Grimmauld's wards like water. He then entered a house that was dark and alarmingly quiet.
"Noon, really?" He whined petulantly to himself. "Ugh, whatever... Maybe most of the staff will be on lunch break by then anyway."
"Like what you see?" he asked cockily, curving his body sinuously around the awed Auror on his way to the shower. (He kept a small distance, lest he be suddenly dragged into the bedroom and prematurely deflowered.)
Harry ground his teeth hard enough to leave cracks. "I will not be posing for photos like that," he said tightly. "Not now. Not ever."
Gripping the far side of the writing desk for leverage, he arched his back, pressing his chest and forearms into its smooth surface and his arse more firmly against Potter's mouth. His prick hung unattended between his legs and the desk; he wondered how well Potter could multitask and if he would take the initiative on his own.
Draco took the few steps toward his date, knelt to the ground, and gently pushed Harry's legs apart before shuffling between them. He placed a hand on the Hero's tented trousers and squeezed.
The magical menagerie was fresh out of turtledoves. What a pity. Please accept these dark chocolate truffles in their stead. I've done my homework: I know they're the kind you like best.
"I don't necessarily think it's Malfoy she disapproves of, mate," Neville interjected. "It's the fact you didn't trust us enough to give us a chance. And I can't say as I disagree."
He gave her a quelling look. "Don't you have weights to lift?" he retorted smartly, dropping the bands to the mat with a soft and bouncy thud.
Something else slotted into place in Harry's mind. Malfoy had admitted to fancying him as far back as school. Hermione thought the love interest in Prince Charming was a lot like him... Could it be that Malfoy had based some of his characters off of Harry?
"Oh, I am about as hard to understand as it is to, I don't know... Break into Gringrotts and ride out on a dragon?"
You really must be suffering if you consider paperwork and organizing a welcome diversion. I took it upon myself to track down the Body Issue from the last three years. For your "reference."
It had been a brilliant night. Draco and Harry clapped their appreciation with the rest of the crowd as the curtain fell and the last of their dishes was swept away. Draco turned to Harry with a smile, one that was far calmer than he had felt in a long time. He took Harry's hand in his once more and squeezed.
I'm currently enjoying pumpkin juice mixed with some kind of weird potion Hermion made which will probably make me puke later. Or immediately. Whichever. It does give a nice fizziness at least, though not the same as a buzz. Hermione apparently thinks I need more "brain juice", which this is supposed to be. I don't feel any smarter, especially considering who I'm writing and telling all this to.
And he knew Potter was gay, it hadn't been a secret. Another fact was that Potter preferred lean blondes, like that Ivan or whoever he had been dating until the slimey bastard was caught with his wand in another cauldron, and then had their relationship (and all of Potter's details from cock size to moans) on public display for the papers after Potter "dared" break up with him over it.
"Draco," he said carefully, remaining where he stood, "I need you to promise me two things." His eyes bored into Draco's wide grey ones and he entreated, voice heavy with emotion, "Promise you won't use Occlumency to hide your feelings from me. And that you will never, ever do something against your will in an effort to appease me or keep me happy."
By the time he got to the bit that preceded his hasty departure from the Manor, Ron's sympathy ran dry.
Draco was on top of him, totally starkers, and their cocks were firmly pressed up against each other.
He hammered the heavy oak door with his fist, shouting, "Open up, Malfoy!" through the ancient wood. He listened for a response and heard nothing, so he repeated the command, even more forcefully this time. "I
Ron and Hermione haven't set a date yet. They're both too busy right now--Ron's finishing up his Auror training and 'Mione is preparing to sit for her exams while interning with the Wizengamot. I'm happy for them. They're my best friends, you know. And their wedding has felt...I don't know,
," Draco corrected, pursing his lips at Harry in the way that signified his disapproval. Hermione and Ron looked affronted (but course they did; it sounded like a long time when Draco put it like that!). Which was right bloody fantastic--now
He shuffled Malfoy around until he was draped over one shoulder and they were facing the same direction. He propped the boneless tempter up with an arm about his waist. He then cast a disillusionment charm on the both of them and half marched, half dragged Malfoy to the Head Auror's office.
"Well. All right then," he replied simply, eager to move on. With a lopsided grin, he added, "She did a good job on your hair."
Patient folder secured a minute later, Harry seated himself at the desk to jot a few quick notes and check his schedule for the remainder of the day.
"I don't hate you," he said honestly, quietly (mindful of listening ears). "And this isn't a trick or a trap. Really, I was hoping to figure out the same thing. Or if you'd been dosed with a lust potion or something. I never would have thought you'd want to...you know," he looked between them pointedly, suddenly bashful about giving voice what almost happened, even as he grieved its loss.
I've known it was you since the letter before last. There has only ever been one person who calls me "prat" as if the insult were a playful petname. Usually I am labelled "git", "tosser", "traitor", or something far nastier. (That, and your scrawl went from anonymous but controlled penmanship to very familiar chicken scratch over the course of your missives.)
At any rate, I became an Auror to address the debt I owe to society. Put simply, people died because of me, ergo I must do my part to save lives with all the means at my disposal. Not that that will ever make it up to the individuals and families who were hurt by my actions, but nothing can, really.
Harry chuckled. "You are quite welcome to take a bath like this every night," he replied, dragging his knuckles down either side of Draco's spine. "You can find me in bed when you're done."
"All right, take me home," he breathed into the Auror's ear as he settled, as if to nap exactly where he was--upright and leaning his weight into the Gryffindor. "I'll get my coat later. I don't need it right now anyway... Do we have to go to the lobby again? You'll protect me, right?"
"I wouldn't mind, honestly, since it would cement my claiming of you, but that woman annoys me. She keeps tapping my face or shoulders with her breasts," Draco sneered, but didn't relent none the less. He used his left hand to capture Harry's, the one gripping his wrist, and with his right now freed once more cupped and rubbed Harry's cock. "Don't worry, I just want to touch it a little. When she gets back I'll stop."
Yes or no, it doesn't much affect me, either way. You're the one with the sideshow attraction for a penis. But I don't kiss men I dislike; there is no amount of liquor that could make me lower my standards that much.
"All right. I'll extract the memory and you can just stand there looking pretty. Okay, Potter?" he said with a cheesy wink.
Zabini, wearing a ridiculous hat, drifted off to charm a gaggle of witches. Parkinson, wearing an equally ridiculous 'dress', departed with her tongue in some bloke's ear, abandoning Malfoy to his own devices.
"You gonna make me do all the work?" he asked, rubbing the flat of his hand across his shiny cockhead (and shivering at the sensation).
He put two cutting boards side-by-side on the counter top, got a skillet preheating on the hob, and set about preparing the chicken.
"Anyway, yes. Same restaurant, same girl. I'm sure of it. She was unaccountably rude so her face stuck in my mind."
I admit that my own dream was to play Quidditch, at least for a few years, but with my current reputation that just won't be possible.
exactly had changed, the tiny sliver of good sense that remained inside Harry somehow managed to reel him back from the edge.
An idea began taking shape as he was speaking that made his heart rate pick up and his prick twitch in his pants. "Or better yet, maybe we should reenact it. You can tell me what I'm supposed to do."
Draco sat with a pout. Not because he was displeased with the ambiance, the staff, or even the other patrons (there appeared to be another male couple there sitting close together, but whether it was for business or a date could not be determined--and it wasn't his business anyway.) No, he pouted because at the angle they were forced to sit he couldn't conduct his favorite game: play-footsy-with-Harry's-cock.
Draco quirked a brow at the Auror shaking with need below him. His grin had fallen to a surprised frown.
Harry grit his teeth so hard they were liable to crack. (If they did, he had the personal phone number of a couple good dentists at least.)
He looked over his partner's head to scan the room for options. The settee wouldn't do--it was difficult to get semen stains out of antique velvet (he knew from experience). "The writing desk," he decided, motioning towards the heavy oak furniture with his chin, "but I'm walking over there myself. I don't trust you not to stumble in those shoes."
After taking several minutes to compose himself and attempt to puzzle out Pansy's unprecedented vitriol, he returned to the kitchen feeling confused and downtrodden (and no closer to solving the mystery).
Shagging in the park seemed like a brilliant idea--it meant almost instant gratification and the weather outside really was quite pleasant that evening--but Harry couldn't risk it. The leeches at the Prophet had snapped pictures of him in places he hadn't expected them before. Plus it was getting dark.
"He said we have two minutes," Draco answered, grinning like a fox, before diving for Harry's nethers once again.
Draco arched a brow in return. "You're late," he chided and began making his way down the stairs, trailing a hand lightly on the high-gloss wood of the banister.
He released Draco's arms entirely to ruck up his shirt (which was already riding deliciously high) and pull it up and over his head. When Draco's smooth, pale torso was exposed, he ran his hands and lips and tongue and teeth over it greedily. He laved one of Draco's small, pert nipples with his tongue until it pebbled, then took it between his teeth to gently tug.
Unobtrusive classical music was pumped in through hidden speakers, setting the atmosphere for the evening's entertainment. Art in an assortment of styles lined walls. A young woman took their tickets and escorted them to the box--very near the stage, two stories up. The legroom left something to be desired (especially for Draco), but the velvet seats were otherwise comfortable, the view was good, and their privacy was assured, which Harry appreciated most of all.
"I don't mind sharing something. I think I'd like to sit down anyway... Somehow I don't feel comfortable walking into a shop where movement is limited."
Harry gasped into Malfoy's mouth when his nipple was pinched. The sensation shot directly to his prick, which strained against his trousers. He widened his legs as much as he could (which wasn't much, sadly) so he could rock forward and rut against Malfoy's stomach.
. He took two steps inside, shut the door behind himself, and had Draco up against it in the blink of an eye.
Draco stirred the potion carefully, noting its colour and consistency. The viscous liquid shifted subtly from pale turquoise to aquamarine and gave off an aroma not unlike wet dog. He was getting close--he could feel it. He might even have the recipe perfected before the students returned from winter hols.
He dipped into a perfect French accent as he spoke the name of the dish and flipped a page in the menu without seeming to notice it.
Draco turned to look at his lover with a smirk, which disappeared into a concerned frown a second later. Despite the Gryffindor's bravado, it was obvious he was exhausted. The blonde crawled over his partner's lap until he firmly straddled him--their cocks rubbing together with casual friction.
"I hope you mean your place. I don't think I could go back to mine tonight..." Draco closed his eyes a moment to regain some of his lost composure. "I am so tired I think I could sleep for a week."
Harry wanted to be indignant. Really, he did. But he couldn't seem to muster it in the face of the man who was his closest thing to a father.
"You know, if you weren't so straight you'd make a great pillow," he replied, thinking the discomfort Potter displayed was due to some sort of homophobia. He stared down at the man for a few seconds longer to note the slight flush of Potter's cheeks (which was almost cute, except cute was a term that could no longer apply to such a manly looking Auror) and the warning frown etched across his face.
Checking the time and seeing it was close to five, he decided to head home for the day (without bidding Ron a goodnight. Wanker).
Draco chuckled as he did as told, for once, and lifted his loafer covered feet to settle over the provided cushion. He leaned back with a long breath of relief and slowly closed his eyes, willing his body to let the alcohol do its work.
Harry came with a shout, heat exploding through him, setting his nerves aflame. The image of Draco grinning up at him as he swallowed his load burned itself into his mind, sure to haunt his dreams.
He summoned the discarded wad of newspaper from where it lay and handed it to Draco. "Rubbish doesn't belong on the ground," he teased, parroting Draco's words from earlier as he deposited the stunned man onto the ground. "I'll make sure we find a bin on our walk," he added cheekily, standing and dusting himself off. He made sure Draco's wand was safely stowed in his pocket and not anywhere it could be used against him.
Lucius decided to make himself comfortable, to solidify the fact that he would not be leaving until the answers he sought were given.
It was moments like that Harry wished he was better with words. Draco deserved sonnets, love songs. Harry'd tried once, in a letter. It was rubbish. So he made do with his hands, worshiping Draco's body--and the man it contained--inside and out. He nudged Draco's prostate insistently with his finger and pulled his weeping prick with his other hand, watching everything with firey lust and awe (and softer, fonder feelings). Draco was in a hurry, practically begging him to fold him in two and fuck him into the cushion.
Though the only thing in this world that truly matters to me now is you--which is why I recently purchased a substantial amount of memorabilia from your Hogwarts days, including a tooth-marked quill that once had the distinguished privilege of being in your perfect mouth--I absolutely cannot afford risk on the off chance Mother dislikes you enough to attempt controlling me via potion. (Such base methods are not beyond her, you know.)
"Does it hurt?" he asked solicitously, rubbing Draco's flank with a still-tingling hand. He had hoped that between Draco's dubious wank toys and all the foreplay that evening they'd avoid that outcome.
"Well, Pansy and I still frequent her favorite restaurant every other Tuesday... When she's in the country. And Blaise comes by to visit once a month. He's pants at wedding planning and his mother is on her fifth (maybe seventh?) husband. So he's been busier than normal, but that's understandable... Gregory, I haven't actually spoken to for years. We left on fairly decent, if not awkward terms. I mean, how do you salvage a friendship after... After what happened?"
Draco's questing fingers moved away from his arse, but as he licked Harry's prick like a lolly and prepared to take it into his mouth, Harry reckoned there was probably no better time for him to experiment with, well...
"I'd offer to give it a trim," Harry replied archly, "but you and I both know how well that would go." He pointed at his unruly mop of hair with a self-deprecating grin and then popped a tender snap pea into his mouth.
They entered the water closet and steam instantly wafted across the blonde's face. He smiled at the sight of a hot, foamy bath accented by his favorite music (piano, violin, a combination of the two, or double acoustic guitars were his preference), and--did Harry even add rose petals?
Harry quirked a half smile. "We wouldn't fit, I'm afraid. It would just be bumped knees, spilled water, and uncomfortably pinned arms, and someone would probably have the faucet digging into his back. But that's all right," he began unbuttoning his shirt while he spoke. "I had something else in mind."
Draco leaned back against the mantle as prompted. He smiled at Potter from his position next to the fire, with his arms crossed loosely over his stomach as he watched the Auror work the floo.
Harry's body tightened traitorously after only a few short minutes and he blew his load all over Draco's prick and hand, slicking the strokes that followed and setting his nerves aflame in a cascade of almost-too-much pleasure.
," Harry breathed shakily, leaning hard to the right to get a better look at Draco's long, slender fingers disappearing into his body.
Draco's arse didn't need much prepping, considering their minutes ago activity, but the feeling of Harry's finger probing around inside once again was pleasant enough that he chose not to complain, point out the obvious, or demand he hurry up. Draco's head fell to the side and his eyes closed as a mewl escaped once the pads of Harry's fingers touched his prostate and rubbed.
Harry groaned, motions stuttering as he attempted to keep his climax at bay. "I won't last," he warned on another deep, but controlled thrust.
"Very nice," Draco whispered in approval as he turned his attentions back to Harry's ear. He took the lobe between his teeth and nipped and sucked on the bit of flesh as if it were a delicious candy.
The blonde vaguely indicated the small crowd gathering and whispering along the edge of the walk with a careful wave of his hand. He took his cone back and sucked on the cool tip.
Harry mouthed his way up Draco's leg and to his prick. He licked and sucked it through the fabric of his pants before freeing it entirely and swallowing the first few inches down.
"I'm sorry I ever did anything to make you or anyone else think that I'm ashamed of you," he earnestly began. "I'm not. Far from it. I'm lucky to have you and I know it." An idea that had been taking root for weeks clamored for attention, demanding to be spoken. Harry opened his mouth to do just that--
He carefully withdrew his hand and added more lube--no such thing as too much in this instance. He leaned low over Draco to take his mouth in a searing kiss as he inserted two fingers where one had been before.
Was your childhood really that bad? I only know that you lived with muggles and didn't know much (if anything) about magic, which I deduced from your constant looks of awe over things I always thought of as "common". I wouldn't think growing up without magic was all that terrible--inconvenient, certainly, but not traumatic. Which makes me think you must mean something else.
"Our next appointment will be Monday," he said needlessly, leaning his hip against the counter and facing Malfoy at a somewhat less intimidating angle. "That should give you enough time to recover from today. And you're seeing Nancy tomorrow, yeah?" Malfoy tipped his head in confirmation. "You'll like her," Harry asserted. "She's sweet as treacle but doesn't take shit from anyone. You'll learn that sooner rather than later if you try to cop an attitude with her. But she's brilliant with all the fine motor stuff. She'll give you exercises to do at home and I can make some suggestions for how to modify them for a quill or wand. But when it comes to the work you and I are doing, no practicing on your own, ok? You need supervision for now."
"So good, so fucking good..." Draco let his head fall to his chest as he concentrated on keeping his balance--holding himself tight and taut for Harry.
"Come on, up you get," he prodded his clinging paramour. "You went through all the trouble of making dinner. I don't want it to go to waste." He kissed to Draco on the tip of his (pointy) nose and helped him up off the ground. "We've got all night to 'talk about our feelings'," he grinned, making air quotes around his unsubtle innuendo.
Malfoy glided through the steps more easily than him, as expected--the man possessed more willowy grace than was fair or reasonable for someone so pointy and acerbic--but he seemed affected by Harry's unexpected prowess. He watched Harry with slightly widened, appreciative eyes and a small, genuine smile playing about his mouth.
He playfully huffed and moved to settle into his usual chair, the one just below an overhanging palm. He crossed his arms and turned away, his eyes obviously averted with dramatized offense.
"Where was this concern for Draco's well being when you invited a psychopath and his murderous cronies into your home?" he sneered disdainfully. "Not much of a future there, as it turns out."
That was when he noticed what was in Harry's hand: his wand. Held at the defensive, tight at his side. And he was giving Draco such an intense, pointed look that his befuddlement (fear and sadness) immediately morphed into rage.
The memory thankfully ended, and none too soon. They were dragged back to the present where Draco made a show of shaking himself out, as if exiting a pool or warding off a chill. He scrubbed a hand through his long, blonde coiffure (already disheveled from when he grabbed at it during the memory without notice.)
Draco's whiskers twitched. He was protective of his work by nature, but Potter would need to know about it if he was to have any chance of helping him. He was at a loss on how to give an answer beyond 'yes' or 'no,' however. He blinked slowly at Potter to communicate as much.
Draco lifted his menu (just realizing the two men from before were blushing now, after a quick glance) and set about deciding his order. He quirked a brow as he eyed a chicken dish with mushroom sauce.
Harry rolled a bit to the side so he could get a hand on Draco's prick without losing contact with his leg. The prat acted surprised that Harry was eager--as if he hadn't just spent the last thirty minutes mercilessly turning him on and then leaving him out to dry. He tugged Draco's prick, enjoying the slide of skin under his palm, and rubbed his thumb on the sensitive spot just under the crown.
Draco nodded, followed immediately by a groan, and closed his eyes. A long, deep breath escaped between his lips as his body slowly began to settle. Despite certain incidents in the past (like at the park), Draco had an issue with letting go of control. Even when he was acting submissive he had an escape route back into the lead... This time was different. Draco's toes curled as his prostate was pressed.
the one who said you'd quit the party scene last night," he said hastily, defensively. "I simply put two and two together. That is rather what I do when not actively engaging Dark Wizards."
Draco pushed Harry's hand away from his cock in order to pull himself up along the bed until he was properly settled against the pillows, and then bending his knees up and laying his arms above his head.
fault she had no passion. And it is sort of hard to get an erection when the person you are snogging is doing their best impression of Moaning Myrtle.
Draco leaned forward into the embrace and lazily licked and sucked at Harry's invading tongue. He moaned softly as his cock was taken.
The best news of the afternoon came when Robards announced the Hit Wizards had taken Goyle into custody. He'd been hiding out with family in the Welsh countryside, keeping a low profile and tending sheep. Once the Unspeakables had isolated his magical signature from the syringe, it wasn't hard to find him.
"Bedroom, then? Is it clean this time or shall I avoid eye contact with anything besides you again?" Draco smirked.
Godrick, it would be so satisfying to deck him right in the condescending smirk. Even better than Zabini. He just needed a reason...any one would do.
"What did you do?" she demanded accusingly, startling him from his musings and nearly causing him to upend half the items on the desk in the process.
"And this is exactly why I want to take things slow... Despite my libido demanding otherwise," he chuckled. "Nice metaphor, by the way," he added as an aside. "Since when are you so clever?"
treated house-elves. I don't like talking about it. I've put it behind me as much as I can and it is a chapter of my life that is thankfully closed.
Draco felt comforted by the affection, but couldn't speak. He hadn't expected it to hurt after all their experimenting (and his own), but it did. It stung after Harry popped in and even more so the further inside he pushed. However, Draco merely nodded at the question--unable to answer and to hopefully avoid alarm in the Auror. Draco took a deep breath to help loosen his muscles.
"I suppose I could live if you were to eat more than me," he began casually. "But only if you'll let me feed you dessert."
Something flickered in Malfoy's face. Harry was fairly certain it was an emotional reaction, not a spasm, but wasn't sure to what. Before he had a chance to decipher it, Malfoy'd locked it down.
He didn't think he was imagining the bashfulness in Malfoy's tone--it seemed Hermione had been more right than she knew. Harry's stomach gave a wobbly tremor at the thought.
Chuckling, he took another sip of firewhiskey, settled back into the couch with his stack of parchment, and counted down the minutes til Draco returned the next day for their first truly public outing.
He looked down at his body, pale but flushed, and darkening by the moment. He wondered what Draco would think of it.
"Then come, Harry," Every word was punctuated by a short, high-pitched groan. Draco's hands slid down Harry's muscular chest and stomach and eventually to his lover's waist. He squeezed the Auror's hips and held there tight as he proceeded to buck back as much as he could onto the cock digging inside him.
Despite their conversation a month ago, beyond some vibrant love marks, they hadn't decided on what to use to establish exclusivity. Harry never mentioned what his ideas were on the subject, and Draco wasn't willing to push lest he accidentally force Harry into a rash decision. For now, he was satisfied with Harry's teeth on his neck and shoulders—hidden under his plain jumper. He had been told to wear something warm and "fancy muggle" for their date, which indicated they were about to hit another muggle restaurant (or street vender). It was amazing to think how willing Draco was to leave his home and wander about now, when the very idea of it once left him short of breath and terrified. Maybe it was because it was muggle areas or maybe because it was Harry, or some combination of both, but be had virtually no qualms about leaving his home (for the umpteenth time) and enjoying some fresh air. Hell, he was
Feeling more dizzy than the pensieve use alone could account for, Harry ran a hand through his hair and asked the first (professional) question that came to his mind--
Do you still favour the Falmouth Falcons? They're playing well this year. Here's two tickets for their Boxing Day game against the Cannons. If you haven't got anyone to go with you, I'd be happy to. As long as you don't mind your companion rooting for the enemy.
Draco breathed a long and happy sigh as Harry came across his arse with a shudder and a hot, wet spurt. He reclaimed the wand that had fallen to the side and undid the spell that bound him. Once Harry was freed, he let go of the wand and instead grasped Harry's hands, gently massaging the abused skin of his wrists with the tips of his fingers as he leaned in to nip and kiss lazily at the Auror's lips.
He wouldn't be able to keep up that blistering pace for long, but while he could manage (and as long as Draco seemed to be enjoying himself), he braced himself on his forearms, dug his heels into the mattress, and thrust like a piston into the velvety heat of Draco's body, grunting loudly with exertion.
Draco's eyes widened at the question. His hands squeezed the bars above his head as he considered Harry, mainly to register if he was being serious or not. A slow, gentle smile graced his lips as his eyes darkened.
Draco quirked a brow and frowned as he was greeted so... Well, so far from what he had expected. Once instructed to sit, he did so with trepidation--though not enough to offer Harry any space, despite knowing it could be nothing but bad news from the tense expression the Auror wore. One arm stretched across the back of the sofa as the other settle on his lap. His legs were crossed, ankle over knee, as he listened to Harry's short explanation.
"Ah," Draco gasped at the odd feeling of Harry pulling out to his head again. His muscles immediately began to calm, though he could feel himself gaping somewhat from the progress Harry had made. Draco nodded again.
It was many hours later when Harry finally arrived. The smell of smoked oysters and salmon wafted from inside the apartment. Draco grabbed Harry by the wrist and pulled him in before closing and locking the door.
The statement was quiet. Sincere. But spoken with a wry twist at the corner of Malfoy’s mouth and something like humour in his fathomless grey eyes.
(Ginny never complained. And I recently had an extended snog with a Ravenclaw that was apparently impressive. "Apparently" because they could have just been saying that to flatter me.)
"Mm... I don't know what I did exactly to deserve all this, but I am not complaining. The ambiance is exquisite, the lavender is strong enough to relax the senses but not over power them, and you even knew how hot I like my water." Draco turned his head to get a glance at Harry. "All that's missing in here is you."
If you'll notice there are two packs. I bought one in order to try it for myself and after a single sip I was almost sick. What is so appealing about this swill? Besides the alcohol content.
Harry gave a lopsided smile, feeling oddly buoyant over the fact Malfoy was making fun of him again. "It's part of my charm."
If you won't do it for her, would you at least consider doing it for me? Think of it as a token of your totally genuine love.
Unless perhaps he was a snake, he thought hopefully. His body did feel long and sinuous. Maybe he was a lovely emerald tree boa or a fearsome black mamba.
It was also obvious that this wasn't Malfoy's first quidditch match--he would expect sex at some point. Which was fine: Harry would, too, of course. But if Malfoy expected it to be like the sex he wrote about--intense and passionate and earth-shattering--well, that might be a bit of a disappointment. He'd never had sex like that before. His experience with shagging was that it was slightly more interesting than wanking; a novel way to get his rocks off. It had never been the kind of spine-tingling, toe-curling, soul-rending lovemaking Malfoy described (in vivid detail).
Your owl was quite unexpected, in an entirely positive way. I didn't dare hope for a reply so to have received one was an accomplishment in and of itself. Beyond that, your generally affable demeanor was a most welcome surprise.
Draco released the pillows in order to grab the slats of the headboard. With better leverage, he began to thrust in earnest against Harry's stocky digits. His right leg lifted to settle over Harry's shoulder, easing some of the strain building in the ligaments of his hip as his muscles began to tighten with imminent release.
It was fortunate for Harry he had experience managing a hungover Ron when it came time to wake Draco in the morning. Draco hadn't cursed or spat or tried to throw hexes, luckily, but he did make a concerted effort to burrow deeper into the covers and sleep through Harry's gentler attempts at waking him.
Draco rolled his eyes as he was given orders. Of course he had to help. He gave a very put-upon sigh but consented nonetheless with a long drag of the chair from the table. At least the idea of labor was enough to allow his erection to subside.
"How about we leave the loo, quietly walk through the crowd under a Notice-Me-Not, and Apparate to your place? Anti-apparition wards here, I'm afraid."
His chest felt a bit tight at the thought, but warmth bloomed in his extremities--the idea was more appealing than not. Exhaling a quiet, slightly shuddery breath, he pressed extra hard into a knot near Draco's shoulder blade.
Harry scoffed. "Burnbridge couldn't figure his way out of a paper bag." He turned to face them once more; solving mysteries, he could handle. Much easier than having to face his own personal demons. Besides, it was old hat for the three of them.
Harry cast a subtle notice-me-not and shuffled until the park's gate was at his back (with Draco clinging to him all the while). The bars were uncomfortable but he didn't care. He dropped his newspaper cone, held on to the fence with both hands, and turned his head to give Draco more access.
"If that was meant to encourage me to hurry, you've got another thing coming," Harry replied archly, but he followed Draco all the same. He wanted to go on this date. Well, to accomplish the goal of going public with Draco, anyway. A good portion of him was dreading the public's response--if for no reason other than the hassle it would create for him at work--so he wanted to just do it and be done with it.
That was right. He did mention that, didn't he? Of course Potter wouldn't have actually kept up with his activities, that would have indicated he might have wondered where he was--and why would he? With a deep, heaving sigh Draco nodded and let it go, despite the odd sting of disappointment.
Whether it was a slip or not, it left him feeling inordinately gratified. He trilled about it (quite without his permission) and then attended to a suddenly very interesting invisible speck on his left foreleg to avoid doing something more embarrassing.
...The number of which dwindled when Ron chased his brother out the door and Dean and Seamus followed (the latter mouthing, "Sorry!" on his way past). Hermione frowned after them but stayed behind to see the conversation trough.
"This way, Malfoy," he said brusquely. "My office is at the end of the hall. The pensieve is set up already."
"Are you coming or not?" the Gryffindor demanded impatiently and Draco remembered that he was in something of a hurry to resolve his current predicament. He scrambled down the gargoyle's arm and reached for Potter, who was gracious enough to offer his hand.
Draco began to thrust his middle digit--slipping all the way out and pushing back in again as far as he could go.
Mind thusly made up, Harry interlaced their fingers and held tightly, squaring his shoulders and daring anyone to look at them askance.
"Do tell if you figure it out." Malfoy's affected air of nonchalance wasn't quite convincing, not even to Harry. "I am rather interested in knowing."
"And if we're both sick at the same time? Colds hit me quick and hard, you inconsiderate oaf," Draco didn't try to struggle away, but he did turn his head as Potter tried to kiss him. "Snuggling unprotected is one thing, but I am not kissing your germy mouth! On top of everything else, I detest the taste of medicine."
By the time Harry arrived, Draco had a chocolate stain on his cheek and pants on. Nothing else. The door was waved open with his wand.
"It was... Interesting to see you both again," Draco let Granger kiss him on the cheek, though he did not return the favor. Instead he quietly promised to send a copy of his next book to her as soon as it was published.
"You're so fucking sexy when you come," he rasped, still tugging Draco's softening prick. "Hell yes I was determined. I'm determined to do it again as soon as you're ready."
Draco was in the kitchen and the smell of dinner (Italian?) filled the house. Harry's spirits were immediately lifted. He bounded down the steps and found Draco in nothing but one of his old, sauce-splattered aprons, draining pasta over the sink.
True, his expression was brittle around the edges and his flirtation rang hollow, but Harry would take that over some of the alternatives.
He smirked to himself, intending fully to call Potter's bluff. It was a win-win scenario for him: either he would be treated to more of Potter squirming or he'd have an opportunity to outdo Blaise in the category of shameless sexcapades--a distinct accomplishment, to be sure.
Was it really any surprise Malfoy didn’t want the intimate details of his disability discussed with someone else? Particularly Hermione, given Malfoy’s complicated history with Harry and his friends.
Harry stepped chuckling out of the loo to thank Draco for his poem, but he was exactly where he'd left him--in his pile of blankets and pillows, asleep by all accounts.
"Need anything, my poor sick Gryffindor?" Draco asked as he ran a hand over the still messy curls of black hair on Harry's chest. "Or would you rather sleep?"
I would be very interested in the Black family heirlooms. My mother, I'm sure, would wish quite strongly (if she were still here and not off galavanting about France) to regain much of what was lost.
Silence fell between them as the machine whirred in time with Malfoy's movements. Flexion at Malfoy's jaw and temple betrayed that he was gritting his teeth.
He stepped back and appraised Draco thoughtfully, giving him a long minute to fret over the devious ideas that might be running through his mind. While it would be a fitting and delightful punishment to make Draco parade about in something scandalous, Harry had put a lot of time and effort into this date and he didn't want to spoil it just for a lark.
"Prop my knees up on your shoulders. Otherwise I'll need a pillow for back. And be careful! You break it, you bought it."
I am not defending it, I am just saying it isn't so strange to those of us who grew up with it. But of course I want out! I certainly don't want to marry a
"What next, Boy Wonder?" Draco prompted, forestalling Harry's royal sulk before it had a chance to establish itself. He was quick, that one.
"I like it," Harry grinned at the revised style, enjoying Draco's weight pressing him into the sofa. His hair, longer in the front than the back, hung freely around his prominent cheekbones. Harry tucked a bit behind Draco's ear, but most fell forward again. The look softened Draco's sharp features while still retaining the masculinity Harry preferred (if he was going to date a bloke, the bloke ought to look like one).
If a shag was all I wanted, I wouldn't have reason to be "pouty" (as you so eloquently termed my melancholy), now would I? You and I both know I have little difficulty securing high caliber company for an evening. Pining uselessly after the Saviour of the Wizarding World is another matter entirely.
As for me, I did, in fact, buy my way onto the team, but it was for a good cause, at least. We reserved several spots for the highest bidder and were able to raise an additional 100,000 galleons from the entitled monied (like myself) looking to enjoy a bit of sport and fanfare. I assure you, my interest is in benefitting the children first and foremost, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't also looking forward to the tourney being great fun. Especially if
"Third year," he answered honestly. "Mostly short stories. Some of it was based on real life while others were just random ideas. No one ever knew or read any of it, though; not even Pansy."
With that, they fell easily enough into their familiar routine. Harry coached a reluctant Malfoy through some light agility work with the ladder to get his heart rate up and then put him through his paces with a modified strength training routine using the resistance bands and Malfoy’s own body weight. Malfoy, predictably, blustered and whinged the entire time. It was all show, of course. They each had their parts to play in this well-rehearsed performance.
He scanned the menu and considered doing the same but Hermione's voice in his head told him he needed to eat a balanced dinner. For some dumb reason.
Draco sat at the humble table in the basement-level kitchen. The chairs were wood and without cushions, but as soon as his rear hit the seat he knew they had been charmed--it was as comfortable as sitting back on the sofa. A shaking hand swept through his hair, mussing his bed-head even further.
He fell atop Draco as soon as a sofa of some sort was in sight (never mind that it appeared to be a priceless antique). He pushed Draco's long legs wider and immediately began to grind and thrust down, as eager as a wild dog.
Draco was waiting patiently for Harry's return (he was too lazy for impatience most days.) He was in the kitchen wearing only an apron and flicking his wand at a couple of pots and a pan. Chicken was browning, noodles were softening, and what looked like a thick tomato sauce from scratch bubbled gently as it was magically stirred. The oven was on and a glass pan sat near by covered in a layer of ricotta and feta cheese. The floo flared just as the noodles were being drained.
Potter's eyes darkened (and only then did Draco realize his spectacles were missing). "Allow me to rephrase," he replied, the husky timbre going straight to Draco's cock. "I like it better when I can hear your
He groaned long and low at the sensation of his hand gliding smoothly over his swollen prick. He wasn't usually very vocal in bed (especially not when wanking), but he thought he could put some effort into it considering what Draco was doing for him.
Draco woke with an indignant yelp and irritable grumble. He swatted blindly at Harry and pulled a pillow between them for protection, curling into a sleepy ball under the blankets. It was almost offensively cute.
Harry stifled a groan. "That's just cruel," he whispered, lowering his voice because a black-and-white clad server appeared with their starters but a moment after Draco released his thumb (making him think that said server might have appeared earlier and politely waited for them to finish).
You have not officially claimed your title as heir Black within the amount of time allotted for this purpose, therefore the last will and testament of one Sirius Cygnus Black has been rendered null and void.
"How is it?" Harry asked, trying to draw his focus to something more pleasant as they made their way to the restaurant.
He turned his right hand palm up on the table, extending physical comfort to Draco if he wanted it. "I don't yet know if I'd enjoy you feeding me or me going down on you or, Godrick, any number of things we might do together. Right now I'm still getting used to the idea of a lot of them. Others I already know have the potential to become my favourite." He deliberately leered for a second to let Draco know just what he meant before returning to earnestness.
"These are too short for me," he complained, indicating his bare ankles (above his equally bare feet) and the sliver of skin across his belly below the shirt Harry'd left for him. "I appreciate that they are green, but your shoulders and neck are so wide I feel like I'm swimming in the top and it's far too breezy below."
It wasn't the Garden Room at the restaurant nor the gardens of the manor, but the wild flora stretched out across an expansive back yard (also not as large as the manor) and displayed many colors and sounds. There were a couple of trees from which birds sang, a rabbit could be seen hopping in the grass, there were crickets playing--completely wild and oddly peaceful.
Not long after, Draco felt it was finally appropriate to leave. Apparently Potter had felt the same, as he was no longer in attendance when Draco turned to look one final time (once his cake had been consumed.) The blonde left with a sad smile as he silently wondered (doubted) if he'd ever run into the Auror again.
Harry chuckled heartily as Draco panted against his neck. He let his lube--and come-covered hand fall to the side but left the other under Draco's jumper to lightly pet at his waist, riding high on a wave of euphoria that felt bigger than the orgasm alone could account for.
"I think that's my new favourite way to describe me: 'helpful and maddening'," Draco laughed softly and kept his eyes down toward his lap. His hands were clenched into tight fists, though his energy read anxiety versus anger. After a few seconds, he lifted his gaze to catch Harry's and bit his bottom lip.
"I thought my photograph made it clear," he said, propping himself up on his elbows and cocking a half smile, "that when I suggested playing doctor, I didn't mean it literally."
So he gathered his courage, licked a stripe over the shiny head (noting the slightly odd, but not unpleasant flavour), and opened his mouth to suck down as far as he could go without triggering his gag reflex.
"Grab a seat," he prompted, gesturing to the visitors' couch along one wall of the sparsely furnished office. He then opened the same drawer that formerly housed his calming draught and produced a silver flask--his best man gift from Ron. "I'd offer you some," he apologized, unscrewing the cap, "but you aren't supposed to mix potions and alcohol."
That's it, I'm breaking you out of there. Between the files and the puzzles and your apparent interest in my company, you've obviously gone round the twist. Two weeks is beyond excessive for dragon pox, even if you had a severe strain. That hospital is up to no good, I can feel it.
Harry's wand was poised to defend but he needn't have bothered. The moment Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dumber set finger to the ropes lashing Parkinson tightly to the spot, new ones leaped forth and bound the men in place. They howled in agony as the white-hot anger with which he had imbued the spell felt like it was burning into their flesh (though it was only real in their minds).
"Just this morning," Harry confirmed, coming to stand by the settee (not so close he could spot the dark grey flecks in Malfoy’s pale irises, but close enough to discern the spice of his cologne—impeccable professional boundaries for someone currently in the private residence of a patient he’d harassed into inviting him in, Harry thought sarcastically). "Called you her favourite patient and everything. Clearly you can be charming when you want to be," he joked, without thinking better of it. He wasn’t sure if they were back to joking yet and he worried how Malfoy would take it as soon as the words left his mouth.
"Tell me what you want me to do. I know what you want, but I like it when you boss me around... which is a surprise, considering I usually hate that from other people."
"I know your knife skills are good, Mr. Potions Prodigy," he declared with a smirk, dropping the vegetables on the counter on his way to the refrigerator to retrieve the chicken and coconut milk, "so get over here and work for your dinner. I'd like that onion cut into eighths, the potato cubed, and the carrots thinly sliced. I'll get started on the protein. There's another apron in that drawer," he pointed with his elbow since his hands were full, "and the knives are in the block."
Harry knew Draco well enough by that point to realize his preparations would have extended beyond the foregoing of pants. With another surge of blood stiffening his already-hard prick, he tugged Draco's trousers farther and reached between his legs to confirm his suspicion--he was wet, slick with lube. Harry shuddered, arousal like lead in his belly. He teased Draco's entrance with the tip of his index finger before pushing it inside. Draco didn't tense, just sighed happily and canted his hips to give him more room.
He locked eyes with Draco, opened his mouth and twirled his tongue around his fingers, pulling them in and sucking lewdly. He maintained eye contact while virtually fellating the digits, even when he wordlessly summoned his wand to conjure lube.
He shrugged off Harry's accusation. "Okay, you caught me. But I bet we could do it of we tried. And used a bottle of that Triple-O potion."
The ginger terror was his second favourite tiny person, right behind Teddy. It was a pity to think of her unwell.
He'd heard a rumor Potter had specifically requested they be assigned together after his third partner had quit under the strain of working alongside the Chosen One, but he'd chalked it up to office gossip mongering and dismissed the notion. Too hastily, apparently. Then there was Potter's snide commentary on Draco's outfit--a fine set of dove grey robes that complemented his features exquisitely, thank you. Coupled with that was the matter of Potter's clothing and his suggestion that it was little better than a formality for the evening. Unsurprisingly, that was where Draco's mind was sticking.
"That was a terrible test!" Harry objected sorely. "If you really want to know if I brushed my teeth or not, you need a real snog. Like
Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Okay, tell me a secret you haven't told anyone else. Not your fear of fire--I know that one already. I've seen you flinch around it too many times.
Clearing his throat and bracing his arms on his lap, Harry shifted fully back to Auror mode. "But that's neither here nor there," he said brusquely. "I don't need to know the details of your private life for the purposes of this investigation. I would like you to please tell me everything you can about the assailant. You said he was slight and weak and that he seemed to know you personally. Since then, have you determined his identity or what his motive might be, beyond your former allegiance to Voldemort?"
Licking his lips, he increased the pace and robbed Draco of breath. He wondered just how virginal the gorgeous man really was and thought about asking him later, but decided to attempt a bit of dirty talk of his own to find out. He was curious to see how Draco liked a taste of his own potion.
By my estimation you'll have about five minutes from the time you receive this owl before I arrive. It's your choice to stay put and accept the inevitable (which is me snogging the ever living daylights out of you) or attempt to flee. Either way, the end result will be the same.
Harry went through the motions of making tea while he struggled to process this information and figure out just what he was going to do about it. It would be a lie to say he wasn't interested, but he wasn't entirely comfortable with that interest, either. And who knew how Malfoy would feel about everything once the potion wore off.
Harry pounded Draco mercilessly. He was already feeling sweat prickle on his skin and roll down his neck.
Potter inhaled sharply through his nose and Draco smirked against his skin. For a man so concerned with his propriety around house-elves, Potter didn't seem over-worried about how he'd appear sporting an erection for his fitting.
One hand squeezed around the crown of the Draco's cock before slamming down toward his hips with a particularly hard thrust. The other stroked the length of Draco's back (delighting in the feel of his soft, smooth skin, which shimmered with perspiration of its own). He clamped onto Draco's shoulder and gripped tight for better leverage.
There had been some murmuring amongst the crowd as they made their way through: some were commenting on the state of their tightly joined hands while many others, especially among the older ladies, whispered comments about two hansom young men cruising through. Draco smirked at the attention they garnished, practically preening under it, until they reached the balcony. Everything was far more impressive than Draco had imagined. The seats were tilted a little too far forward (it felt like he would drop just from trying to sit down), and a little too close to the edge, but considering what he had thought he'd find instead he was none-the-less pleased.
He could have drowned in the kiss. He poured all of his wanting and frustration and excitement and uncertainties into the hot press of lips and twining of tongues, making the occasional needy, frantic, aborted noise against his will.
The reporter--a protégé of Skeeter's--had dogged his steps for years, suspecting (rightly) that Harry wasn't the unhinged wealthy shut-in most people believed him to be. Until now, he'd never managed to prove his pet theory but he must have gotten the scoop of his career to be at Harry's muggle workplace that day.
That extra bite was all Harry needed to push him over the edge. He came with a hoarse cry, splattering Draco's abdomen and his own with warm, sticky spunk, digging his fingers into his sweaty skin, the muscles of his arse clenching spasmodically around Draco's cock.
That was his last coherent thought before he was rudely awakened some hours later by a face-full of frigid water.
Ron didn't miss a beat. "Malfoy," he stated matter-of-factly, plopping down into the ancient sofa and looking to Harry for details. "Who started it then?" he asked around a mouthful of pastry.
, all while remaining intrinsically good. It is a unique combination of qualities and I find it alluring.
Malfoy took his sweet time sidling up next to him, selecting a knife, and making his first precise cut. Harry waited until he got into something of a rhythm and had a nice little pile of carrot slices forming before leaning over to whisper in his ear, voice husky and commanding, "Put them in the skillet when you're done."
With a flick of his wand, Draco levitated the cup to the sink. He stood to answer the door, but not before taking a cursory look around his apartment--wondering what an impression it would make. Everything was sleek, black and silver, and made of Manticore leather in his living room (his bedroom door was shut tight and the entire floor warded to hide what looked like tornado damage.)
The woman ahead of them was herding the family to the door and caught Draco's eye as she passed. He offered a smile. She gasped when recognition dawned and gathered her brood around her like a protective hen. Her husband turned quickly at the sound and scowled pure menace at Draco, who had done literally nothing wrong. Anger rising, Harry stepped between them and forced the man's gaze to him. Surprise and then revulsion joined the hatred in his muddy brown eyes. He spat on the ground at their feet and stormed outside.
He sat across from Draco--who'd either finished or binned the rest of his ice cream--and gave him a crooked smile. "We made it this far without being hexed. I consider that an achievement."
While receiving a small massage around his Achilles, he used his talented toes to inch Potter's shirt up, thankful it had not been tucked in. Once he could, he pressed them into the lower part of Potter's abdomen.
Walking upright on his hind legs in his best approximation of a man's gait (which was damn near impossible with his soggy noodle of a body), holding Potter's wand in his jaw and waving it like he was casting a spell (as best he could--the piece of wood was relatively heavy and nearly as long as him), using a quill to make indecipherable scratches on a piece of parchment (he'd intended to write his name, but that he successfully did
Hermione and Ron were under strict orders not to interfere, but they'd be sending a team of Aurors in to extract him if he failed to show up for a check-in breakfast on Monday prior to his shift in the clinic. That left just over 48 hours for Operation: Grand Gesture to succeed. The odds were looking worse by the minute, but Harry remained hopeful. He'd convinced Malfoy to give him a chance once already; he just might be able to do it again...
"The offer still stands," he confirmed. With a sly grin and a wink he added, "I was thinking we'd use my
"Sylvia is apparently some third cousin or something so of course I was expected to show up. If I hadn't thought my father was going to be here, which he isn't--surprise, surprise--I wouldn't have even come."
good in the sack or did you finally hit your head one too many times? Seriously, Harry. He's a Malfoy.
My heart beats all the louder for you when you play hard to get, my scrumptious, unobtainable Auror.
Biting his lip was insufficient. Draco turned his face to the side and bit his own shoulder in an effort to stifle the stream of gasps and moans ready to spill forth.
Gladys, at first annoyed to be interrupted, fluttered her eyes up toward her new guest. She smiled immediately once she realized who it was that had come to visit her.
I sincerely appreciate you telling me, all the same. I understand it is a token of your trust and that means more to me than you could know.
He didn't bother to pull out as he flopped heavily on Draco's back like a sack of potatoes, breathing against his hair and hugging the blonde's waist as he slowly came down from his incredible high.
Harry tried to think of a clever response but his thoughts were muddled—it would be so much easier to simply hex the git and be done with it.
He raked his eyes over Potter's thick, muscular frame, taking in the nicks and scars that dotted him, the dark, appealing hair that was sprinkled on his chest (and more pronounced the further south it went), the confident way he stood. The man had stared Death in the face and lived to tell of it. He'd saved Draco on more than one occasion and been a thorn in his side more often still. He was brash, powerful, and self-assured, yet somehow still so down-to-earth, as likely to poke fun at himself as he was to do something worthy of mockery. He was Gryffindor to his very core and, Salazar, Draco wanted him.
Once Potter's top was free of his trousers Draco grabbed his hips in a tight grip and happily slotted himself between Potter's for a series of rough hip rolls and hard bucking--grinding their erections together and most likely smashing Potter's tailbone into the wall. The ravenette didn't argue or complain so the thought of possibly hurting the Auror was fleeting, drowned in a deluge of sensation and nonsense mainly involving
The first half, anyway. He still wasn't sure about the second part, but if Draco asked, he probably wouldn't say no. That seemed only fair.
Tucking his head into his paws, he kept a listening ear out for the sound of approach. After a minute of Potter thumping around the bedroom, he heard the the en suite shower come on.
It didn't come. After years of living with Hermione, Ron was finally starting to recognize when he was being manipulated. He simply crossed his arms, sat at the chair behind Harry's desk, and smiled.
Once inside with the doors securely locked, he marched with a frown upstairs to his bedroom and flopped across his bed with a sigh of resignation (after stomping up the stairs to his inner-brat's delight). He breathed (whined) into his duvet.
He wrapped his free hand around Draco's shin (up by his ear) and pumped his fingers in and out of the scorching, spasming chute, completely consumed by the utter necessity of giving Draco exactly what he needed.
"Oh no, what ever shall you do with me?" Draco asked in feigned distress and laughter. "I'm such a delicate flower! I bruise like banana! Do you plan to implement torture? Oh woe is me!"
of dating her and not the girl herself. She is my best friend's sister and would have been my ticket into the family I always wanted. But the fact I had no real feelings for her would have ruined us both sooner rather than later, even if I tried to fake my way through it. Which, I am not proud to admit, I considered.
Harry barked a laugh and kissed his godson square on the forehead, making Teddy grimace exaggeratedly, then giggle like a maniac at his own joke. If only it could be so easy with the rest...
"Any chance this could happen every night?" Draco asked anyway, just to be silly. "I could get used to bathing this way."
Harry's generous invitation did much to lessen the disappointment of not getting to see him that evening.
Harry attempted to rein in his anger upon seeing that Malfoy felt intimidated enough to back up. He still seethed, however. "I'm not embarrassed," he corrected through tightly-clenched teeth (which was a lie; he was totally embarrassed), "I'm pissed at you for going through my things. And why should I know who Morias is?"
"After a day of Mother's shopping in one of the coldest countries in the world? Starving," Draco linked his hands behind Harry's neck. "And yes, she did. Rather nice, isn't it? I got to keep some of the length while still retaining some dignity."
Apparently Harry wasn't as good at masking his feelings as he thought. He clenched his teeth in consternation. Malfoy's threat was effective at accomplishing its goal, at least.
Anyway, I am not drinking nearly enough to even approach the limits of my tolerance. I was born with wine in my veins instead of blood. (Another "gift" of my upbringing.)
...Okay, maybe he was a little delirious. But at least some of that was because he had Draco Malfoy, naked and willing, in his bed.
"Oh sure," Harry retorted archly, dropping down into his seat (unsure if his legs would have held him steady very much longer). "
Harry reached into his backpack and pulled out a rumpled sleeping bag. He'd had worse beds than the Manor's plush lawn.
Harry popped his still-piping bite into his mouth and chased it with a spoonful of ice cream, which melted immediately and mixed with the soufflé, cooling it and making it sweet enough for his jaw to tingle.
His chest was heaving and a flush climbed his throat. From Potter's carding, his hair had gone from a somewhat artistic mess to just messy--and he couldn't care less. Having someone tug at it was far more pleasant than he expected.
He would rather not have made the connection. Not only was the idea more than a little disturbing, it threatened to engender a kernel of sympathy in him, which was more than he wanted to give Lucius, slimy two-timing bastard. Ignorance really was bliss.
"How about... We grab what's left of the food and talk while we eat? I can hear your stomach from here and I need a minute to unbox myself for that one."
It might just be the illness talking, and I'm pretty sure you were being your usual sarcastic self, but I am definitely not opposed to the idea of fucking you into a desk. Mine will do. I'm not picky.
Draco's smirk widened to a predatory grin, sharp and hungry. "As a matter of fact, no," he answered, tugging playfully on Potter's zipper. "Why should they? Yours would hardly be the first nudity they've ever been exposed to.
Draco kept his left hand behind him for balance as his right teased the head of Harry's cock just under the hood.
If it matters to your decision, I will be wearing leathers (though I am exceedingly curious about your inclusion of this detail).
And Draco needed help choosing better friends. If all three really were involved, it would be a major blow.
Draco pulled up until only the head occupied his mouth. Both hands moved to stroke the rest of Harry's length in furious swipes, urging him to climax. He could taste the salt of precome dribbling into his mouth. He swallowed automatically and awaited the moment when something much thicker would coat his tongue.
(That, too, was sarcasm. And it should be read while envisioning my normally hansom face wearing a scowl.)
"Mm, how about we floo to my place? I have a bed that could fit ten people in my room and soft fur blankets we can roll around on," Draco offered between pants, quirking one brow in challenge. "Or are you scared of being in the home of an ex Death Eater? Very dangerous, I admit. You may not be seen for several days..."
Harry took a long swallow of his drink and tried to coax his temper down from fire engine red to...burnt orange. It was the best he could do given the circumstances.
While he was drying off with one of Draco's excessively plush green towels, he noticed a piece of parchment stuck to the inside of the door that hadn't been there before. Upon closer inspection, it contained the schmaultziest love sonnet he'd ever read in loopy, swirly calligraphy. (Comparing his eyes to the green of the Irish moors, really?)
"I could come just from listening to you talk," he rasped against the side of Draco's face, squeezing his wrists tight and dragging his body up Draco's length. "If we don't go to the loo right now, there will be an even bigger mess to clean when we finally do make it."
He bit his tongue and counted to ten and recited potions ingredients in his head...Anything to keep from hexing his boyfriend's father (the supercilious bastard). Though the man was looming over him, Harry remained seated. Lucius' intimidation tactics meant less than nothing to him.
Malfoy was in pyjamas. Why was Malfoy in pyjamas? It was nearly noon and Harry had made an appointment, which Malfoy had confirmed. Yet there he was, half-naked, and wearing...penguin pyjamas.
So, ignore what I said before. There is only ONE chapter left, just the one. Not almost or just under ten. Derp.
Draco grasped the bars above his head once more with another petulant huff, though whatever negativity he was feeling faded away immediately as soon as Harry complied. He nodded curtly.
Malfoy wore a thin-lipped frown and fetching ice-blue robes. The edges, Harry noted (for no reason in particular), were finely trimmed with silver embroidery.
Bumping his glasses up and palming the back of his stiff neck, Harry surveyed the options before him. At this point, sleep seemed to be the best course of action. Fortunately, years with Hermione had taught him to plan (and pack) for every possible scenario.
A wide grin split Harry's face after he recovered from the electric jolt of Draco impaling himself on his cock.
"Funny you bring up that particular memory," Draco murmured with a small, cautious softening of his frown. He placed a hand over the one settled on his chest and squeezed. "Well, I was going to Curse you with something pretty nasty myself. I'll admit you had to defend yourself, though really--you can't bother to do a little research on a spell before using it? Very Potter-like, but I do hope you learned a thing or two about being less idiotic with unknown spells."
He didn't speak up for a long time. It took a while for him to gather the courage to find his voice. In the mean time, he had allowed himself to enjoy the feeling of flight through sudden, happy calm.
With a wince, he rubbed the back of the head (where it had connected solidly with Draco's wooden floor boards), but he was chuckling lightly as he did so. "I thought you said this was going to wait until after dinner," he joked about their newly horizontal position.
"You are most gracious," Draco replied, offering his hand in turn. Arthur shook it stiffly and made his way to the back of the house. A few minutes later, the crack of apparation signaled his departure.
“Don’t stop,” Malfoy fairly begged, twisting in Harry’s not-quite-embrace until they resembled a pair of tango dancers. Merlin, this man would be his downfall, he was sure of it.
He shifted to alleviate the discomfort in his spine from cramming onto the too-short sofa, unintentionally rubbing their erections together in the process and nearly derailing his train of thought.
He exhaled hard enough to make his fringe flutter, catching himself mid-psychotic rant. "I've only had like three conversations with him," he amended, somewhat calmer, "so who the hell even knows if this will go anywhere. But I want to try."
"I know... How about we do both after all? Instead of keeping it in the bowl, why not warm it up on my skin?"
"Come on then, you towering giant," Harry urged, keeping Draco behind him and scanning for danger. He led them quickly through the dense vegetation.
"This is bloody weird, you know," Potter opined, running two fingers down Draco's chest and back up again in a slow, steady rhythm that made Draco's eyelids heavy and a genuine purr threaten to sound. "When I think about the fact you're not really a ferret, but rather--" He swallowed what he was going to say, a rosy flush tinting his cheeks.
Feeling reckless and emboldened (these bloody masks were dangerous), Harry took a large step backwards so that he and Draco were nearly back-to-back. He casually replied to Hermione's inquiry about the lobster bisque ("It's good. You should try it.") and reached behind himself to give Draco a firm, retributive pinch on the arse.
Draco smirked, vindicated and smug. Carter had been a good one--too boring to maintain his interest for long, but vocally and enthusiastically appreciative of Draco's talents. It was nice to hear that he was still singing their praises (and rightfully so).
He bounded to his desk to show Potter his journals--the absolute most important things in the room. While he was trying to decide how best to reach them, Potter came alongside and hoisted him up. Draco impulsively licked the side of his index finger where it rested under his chin. He really needed to stop doing that but his brain kept insisting it was a good way to show his appreciation, which would be problematic if it continued after he was human again.
"Let's finish getting dressed and put some tea on," he said, rubbing Draco's arms. "It's going to be a long night."
His stomach chose that moment to growl loudly. He hadn't actually eaten lunch. "That's my cue to call it quits, I think," he declared with a self-deprecating half smile. "You have been helpful. And absolutely maddening, let's be clear."
I didn't say "not completely natural." Merlin. These looks are 100% Malfoy. I just meant I have to watch what I eat and get my time in at the gym to maintain my figure--I don't have the metabolism of an adolescent any longer. More's the pity.
Slowly, he released the slats and slid his aching hands away. His legs fell limp and lifeless (his right still on Harry's shoulder and hanging heavily).
? ...I drink. Read. Drink. Write letters, drink, garden every other day, design furniture, drink, smoke, and drink.
Conversation with Malfoy was a lot like Quidditch. Or perhaps a wizard's duel. Either way, Harry often felt he was losing and that the stakes were very, very high. But with renewed determination (owing to the fact he'd convinced the man to at least give him another chance), he pressed on.
He had been awaiting Harry's return all day, though he would never admit it even in court, like a lovesick puppy--despite the fact they hadn't planned to meet again that night. Draco just had a feeling he would, and according to that knock he was right.
"Actually, the chips are a bit lackluster... But this fish is rather delectable. I wonder what batter is used?"
"Face to face or chest to back?" Draco somehow managed to ask even as he struggled to breathe. Having something inside wasn't so nerve wracking (he had Harry's fingers inside him at least a dozen times now)... The realization that
I received the enclosed letter yesterday. I do not know if you initiated these proceedings or if you're even aware of them, but I wanted to contact you personally before getting solicitors involved. Hermione has advised my that I have strong legal grounds to contest the decision, but I'd rather not go that route if it can be avoided. My godfather left his inheritance to me. Not only does that carry significant emotional weight for me, but Grimmauld is my home (and has been since the end of the war). I couldn't care less about most of the heirlooms and artefacts--if you'd like to come over and sort through the attic, you're welcome to the lot of them. But I would be exceedingly grateful if you'd sign over the deed to the estate to me so I can be done with this unpleasant business and get on with my life.
Luna went gracefully to the ground, assuming a lotus pose. She grinned at the two of them and gave them a thumbs up, tucking her white-blond hair behind one ear as she did so. She wore sequined green pickle earrings with a flouncy pale pink dress and knee-high stripy socks. Bless her queer little heart. At least Harry had one friend in his corner.
Janine tapped her lip thoughtfully. "It can't have been that he's gay," she stated, matter-of-fact. "He's even fancier than you. What in the world did you do, Henry?"
I will have you buried to your throat in cursed objects and litigation that will leave you incapicitated for months," he snapped, narrowing his silver eyes dangerously.
Malfoy waited unobtrusively as he did a visual sweep of the grand entryway (noting points of egress, potential hazards, and which antique furniture would provide the best cover...because old habits die hard).
Harry cursed himself once more for not thinking before speaking. Would it kill a man to display even a speck of Ravenclaw discretion?
Your line about wine for blood made me chuckle. I wonder who would win in a drinking contest between you and Ron. The Weasley men are sturdy. I'm no lightweight, but I can't hold a candle to them.
If Draco kept that up, Harry wouldn't be able to defy his order if he tried. Sweet Merlin, he hoped he wouldn't stop. Harry'd had his fair share of blowjobs and, in his opinion, there was almost no such thing as a bad one (provided the person doing it followed basic etiquette and safety protocol). But Draco's enthusiasm, his wholehearted commitment to the task and seemingly genuine enjoyment of doing it, combined with the sensations radiating from deep inside, put this blowjob in a class all its own.
After that, he scrawled another, inviting Draco over the next night. With it, he included open access to his Floo...which was a big freaking deal. But his gut told him it was the right call. Trusting it had already paid dividends that day, after all.
The only difficult component of that dare was determining which of your numerous positive attributes to complement. Ultimately I decided your eyes were a safer option than your arse, but perhaps I didn't need to be so cautious...
He gave Draco a farewell kiss, but paused in the doorway on his way out. "I'd like it if you were here when I got back," he admitted over his shoulder, using up all his courage to do so. He left before Draco could reply.
As for whether or not I want you, you have no idea how much I've longed to just be open about it and act, but that is beside the point. I refuse to be the cause of your misery--I have done quite enough of that already.
"I wanted you because I needed someone who would get the job done and not be distracted by my celebrity status. Ever since Ron retired to a desk job all I've had are fanboys who don't know what the hell they're doing," Harry explained quickly through rough pants as he held the skirts and tried his best to maintain logical thought. That effort shriveled up and died as his cock was expertly licked around the sensitive head. He threw the material over Draco's head in order to grab the mantel once again.
Harry scooted the heavy chair away from the table, noting the intricate scroll work of the wood and delicate embroidery in the upholstered seat. He surmised there was virtually nothing in the Manor he could afford with his paltry therapist’s salary. Even the Potter vaults would take a substantial hit if he were to try. Not that he would. Such extravagance wasn’t his style at all. For the first time, he wondered if it was Malfoy‘s.
He took up his usual spot on the mismatched furniture--the comfortably worn armchair adjacent to the sofa--and spent the better part of the night exchanging increasingly outlandish theories with the closest people he had to family. By the time Hermione begged off somewhere after midnight owing to an early case before the Wizengamot the next morning, they were nowhere nearer to solving the problem.
He chirruped at Potter, cocking his head to the side and ensuring his tail was extra fluffy. Potter appraised him with narrowed eyes and pursed lips. "Is that supposed to be an apology?" he asked skeptically.
He lifted his head and tossed it to the side in an attempt to force his hair away from his face. He frowned as parts of it either didn't move, heavy from sweat, or fell right back into place over his eyes.
"You dressed up for me...? And we're going to a place without the possibility of greasy, though delicious, newspaper foods or Devil's Snare, or spiders--like that attic cafe you took me to?"
The shagging was particularly nice. Draco got over his 'trauma' right quick and demanded all sorts of experiments to determine what positions he liked best. Harry was only too happy to oblige. (His personal favourite so far was Draco on top riding his cock.)
Though Draco's flat did not have a working Floo, the Manor was home to several. And his mother's recent return from her extended "holiday" on the continent gave him the perfect excuse to visit.
"I'm not just staring," Harry replied with a pointed eyebrow raise in the direction of Draco's crotch. "Besides, I thought you liked my uniform," he quipped.
Still holding Draco's legs in the air, he bent forward and licked a broad stripe across his entrance, tasting conjured lube and the blueberry stuff, mixed with the unmistakable musk of a man. He hummed with pleasure and went back for more, alternating fast and slow and an occasional foray inside.
Draco smirked. "Just last Thursday I came thirteen times... In an hour," he boasted falsely. "The tingly sensation from an orgasm always leaves me stimulated enough for a few more rounds. I don't know how many I can handle when my entire body is involved, but remembering how you were in the shower has me wanting to try."
"It was just my prick," he replied, setting the breakfast tray on the foot of the bed and sitting down next to it. "I'd thought you rather well aquatinted with it before last night. But I can get you a potion if you'd like."
Draco didn't want to talk about it. That was ok with Harry--he didn't much want to talk about it either. The more time that passed, the more protective he felt and the angrier he got at his impotence there. He wanted Draco safe, and that meant putting the people who'd tried to hurt him behind bars.
Draco shuddered bodily when Potter replaced his tongue with a finger, probing more deeply inside and continuing to wank him with quick, tight strokes.
In a more direct voice he added, "I assume you'll be sending an owl for that memory appointment, yes? If so, I'm sure you can show yourself out. I'm still tired."
Perhaps because of the case, or because he was genuinely curious, as they left the grand hall Harry decided to ask about Draco's parents, which somehow led to the engagement contract Draco once had with Pansy. It might have ruined the mood, but Draco felt far too airy to be bothered. It did, however, lead to far more detail than Harry had originally anticipated.
After spending the night Wednesday (and every other night for a full week before that), Draco reluctantly announced the next morning that he should return to his house to make sure his owl was okay and that spiders didn't move in in his absence. Harry hadn't tried to stop him--why should he?--but the estate had felt surprisingly cold and empty without him that night.
"I meant Grimmauld," he confirmed with a nod. "Your place is probably still crawling with Law Enforcement. We'll get you in bed and you can sleep as long as you please."
Unlike Draco, Harry was pants at occlumency, but he was fairly adept at the regular kind of compartmentalization. He put aside the roller coaster of emotions he'd felt during Draco's chaotic, five-minute nervous breakdown, bottled the bright-burning anger Zabini had ignited in him (along with his eagerness to follow up on the promising lead), and reducto'd the general stress and anxiety of the evening. By the time they reached the top of Draco's stairs he was practically a blank slate...except for his eagerly blooming libido, which was given free reign.
Draco's longer fingers were better suited to holding both their pricks at once so Harry moved his hand away to make room (having little trouble finding other enticing places on Draco's body to put it). With one hand holding tightly to Draco's arse and the other cradling the back of his skull, he gasped and grunted as Draco wanked them simultaneously, watching with rapt attention their pricks press and stretch and smush against each other in his grip.
"Didn't expect to see you here... Didn't even recognize you! Since when did you fill out so nicely?"
Yes, quite. But Draco wasn't eager to drink out of a dish--there was no way to do so with decorum. With a sinking feeling, he realized dinner was going to pose the same problem, only magnified.
I'd ask if now was too soon if I wasn't already booked. Hermione is dragging me to another ruddy seminar. Can I come over afterwards? Say, around 7?
He began to walk again as he dug back into his fish. He was even brave enough to sample the two meal components together and found it wasn't so bad.
He took the liberty of grabbing Harry's free arm and carefully moved to escort him back out the way they came.
The bigger surprise--except, not really--was his implication of Zabini as a willing accomplice and Parkinson as the brains behind the operation. Goyle fancied himself in love with the evil bint and she apparently carried a torch for Draco. Zabini, for reasons unknown, collaborated with the two of them to stage the attack as punishment for Draco's various sins, at least according to Goyle, who, in Harry's professional opinion, was more than half mad (and twice as dumb).
certain activities that he no longer craved, due to the unpleasant prickling sensation crawling up his spine.
He stepped away from Draco just long enough to kick off his shoes and shove his trousers aside (revealing he did indeed wear nothing underneath). Once that task was accomplished and Harry was totally naked, he moved back to his place against Draco--this time hooking both hands under the tall blonde's lean thighs and hoisting him up until his feet were off the ground. He grinned wide.
Enclosed is a gift certificate to a local luxury spa for a manicure, pedicure, and haircut--complete with hand, foot, and scalp massage, of course.
"I want your fingers inside me and no need to be gentle. Give it to me hard and fast. You saw how I like it."
Ron sat up straight in his creaky wooden chair, planting his feet firmly on the ground. "Ooookay..." he said carefully, noting the strain in his friend's voice. He hadn't expected Harry to defend Malfoy so strongly or to admit to feelings of want...
Harry replayed the conversation over and over in his mind as he made his way down the long gravel drive, searching in vain for hints at Malfoy’s involvement with Burnbridge’s sudden appearance and trying to discern what, if anything, he should have done differently back up at the house.
He let the 'threat' hang in the air as he stood up from the floor and stretched the kinks out of his back--arms and legs tensing and pulling away from each other as each muscle was lengthened and slowly returned.
"What are you on about?" he deflected (futilely), making sure Sarah's 'World's Greatest Receptionist' mug was safely out of harm's way. Janine was like a ruddy Crup when she had an idea in her head--eager, determined, and relentless. Harry appraised her warily. Her hands were firmly placed on her wide hips, elbows akimbo, brown eyes narrowed dangerously. All bad signs.
Harry kneeled beside him and pulled him into an embrace. "Accidents happen," he answered easily. "And you didn't ruin my party," (he'd done a bang up job of that one on his own). He squeezed the end of Teddy's pointed chin between his thumb and forefinger. It was so much like Draco's. "I'm not mad at you," he continued gently, "but you must do a better job minding your elders, pup. I've told you not to climb the shelves before and you knew we were waiting until after dinner for cake."
It had never been that way before, not even with other blokes. He didn't know what made Draco different, but he aimed to find out. Starting with this fucking brilliant snog.
Draco's finger was harder to ignore when it was moving (but then, so was his mouth). Harry continued to feel conflicted about the whole affair, relying on his Gryffindor stubbornness to see him through, when Draco touched something inside him that made his whole body flex. It was almost like a stunner...except really fucking awesome.
With a spike of desire making his fingertips tingle, he gazed at the man walking alongside him as they made their way to the kitchen stairs. Malfoy was loose-limbed and rangy, and he grinned openly when he caught Harry looking. The way he wore his hair these days--past his chin and free-flowing--was vaguely reminiscent of Lucius, but the artful disorder was all him. The person Malfoy had become. Draco, Harry supposed. Because this man was markedly different from the sniveling, snobby, angry arse he'd known at Hogwarts.
," he answered Draco's earlier question. "But our reservation is at 7:30 so we have time to walk about beforehand. And in case you're thinking of saying it, I'm fully aware that I'm under-dressed. I was in robes all day--I couldn't bring myself to change out of one set and into another."
His fingers were still, but remained inside, and began to be crushed by Draco's interior muscles tightening with apprehension. He kissed the pad of Draco's thumb where it rested against his lips and turned his face to nuzzle against his palm.
Draco's back arched from the chair and his head fell back, mouth open on a shuddering cry. His whole body stiffened and shook as he came, spurting white flecks between their torsos.
He lead Draco to the table and sat down with him, pulling his chair close enough to Draco's for their knees to touch. He was out of his element--uncomfortable, anxious, irritated still, and unsure--but he powered through it for both of their sakes. If they were to have any hope of a future, and that was what he wanted when it came right down to it, they'd have to be able to have conversations like this, fights even, and be okay.
"Come on then," Potter said, holding out his palm for Draco to scamper up. He did, quietly grieving the loss of the delightful camaraderie they had managed to establish, which would fall by the wayside as soon as he was back to his usual self, he was sure.
Draco made a muffled noise of surprise and delight and Harry climbed onto his chair to straddle his lap, never breaking the kiss.
He thought of all the men Pansy had slept with and left the next day and realized she might not have been the best person to seek for advice. She wasn't exactly the committing sort (except when it came to the betrothal contract they shared, which would
"You're not even looking out for her, Draco," he hissed; Draco's heavy-lidded eyes were fixed firmly on the bulge in his trousers. He couldn't bring himself to unseat him, though--Draco was too damn sexy for either of their good.
He broke away to draw his wand. "I should let Hermione know I'm safe," he prudently explained, "otherwise she really will come banging down the door. This'll be but a moment."
You have good reason to be suspicious, especially with all the malicious pranks our classmates have targeted you with this year--most of which you've managed to foil really quite impressively--so I can only hope that at least some of my genuine feelings make it to you through these words. Such as they are.
He'd have to be careful about how much he revealed given that the investigation was ongoing. "Goyle was motivated by revenge--for what happened to Crabbe and your apparent mistreatment of Parkinson," he explained. "According to him, the idea was Parkinson's and she provided the syringe, while Zabini orchestrated the time and location of the attack.
I suppose if I'm honest it does make me feel somewhat lonely, but I have no one to blame but myself there. You have to actually go out and
When Harry pulled away after a minute, Draco held fast and let himself be tugged under the water, finally releasing the Saviour only to hog the shower spray. He bumped his hip against Harry's to make room.
You are dead to me. And not like the last time I said it when you were able to reclaim my affections with your sincere and heartfelt apologies (ten dozen roses, a case of champagne, and an all expenses paid holiday at the Swiss chalet). I mean it this time. Blaise is my new official best friend. I hope you're happy.
With an evil cackle, he left the loo with book in hand. He held it behind his back so Potter wouldn't see it at first, but when he was close enough he produced the glossy novel and chuckled, "Nice tub-side reading, straight man."
Positions reversed (and all thoughts of illness far from his mind), he pushed Draco's legs up and away to have a clear view of his sweet pink, glistening hole. He'd intended to pick up right where he left off but he couldn't resist the impulse for a taste.
. Godrick. Harry stared and felt no shame it in. It jutted from Draco's body at a forty-five degree angle, shiny and hard and begging to be touched.
As a result of my investigation, I learned that not only does one of your best friends work in the Department of Mysteries, but she and one of my best friends (who has a reputation for meddling) both spearheaded this Secret Santa business.
Before heading out, he skirted the dinner table to give Harry's neck a quick, playful bite and then dashed into the sitting room (in case the fast-acting Auror tried to grab him for retaliation).
The events of the day swam to the surface of his mind, but they were scattered and disjointed by the terrible pain.
Draco sniffed the air as Harry assessed his dessert. At once, his mouth began to water in anticipation.
Your words are quite kind, and I thank you for them (prank or otherwise), but unless you're willing to tell me who you are and speak them in person, I can't say I believe you.
He moved his wand through the complicated gestures, drawing the rune out of his mind and forging it with his will and magic. The handle of Draco's door shook. Parkinson giggled and called sweetly for him with words that were anything but. Harry blocked her out, blocked everything out but the searing focus of his spellwork.
He sat up and lifted Draco's rebellious hands, pressing his fingers around the slats of the headboard once again. "Do. Not. Move. Unless. I. Tell. You. To." He enunciated each word carefully, fixing Draco with his most authoritative stare.
The syringe had been the detail he hadn't been able to shake. It was just so odd. Few wizards would even know what one was to look at it, let alone consider using it as a weapon. And it didn't seem to be the sort of thing a pureblood like Malfoy would have had any exposure to. He'd considered the possibility Malfoy was lying, of course, but on the off-chance that he wasn't, he decided to follow his intuition and put his wondering to rest with this visit. That Malfoy had the thing in his possession was an unanticipated boon.
Once again, I am the only editor on this project now and I am not the greatest so... Please be kind!
Malfoy made a noncommittal sound, but Harry was encouraged by the fact his frown wasn't quite so frown-y. It was more of a 'this-is-how-my-face-is-used-to-looking' frown.
He was suddenly very eager to do just that, not just for the education it was sure to be but also because the thought of it was an incredible turn on.
"I'm not as straight as you think I am," he muttered under his breath, smoothing out his robes and assuming Malfoy was too far gone to hear or understand him.
Malfoy wore his hair swept to the side, longish fringe hanging over one eye. Harry thought it had been done in an effort to obscure the asymmetry now present in what had once been Malfoy's arguably perfect Pureblood visage. The result of a mild-to-moderate deterioration in his craniofacial musculature, it was especially noticeable to someone who'd spent as much time looking at Malfoy as him. (Back when the Slytherin had been getting up to all that suspicious business in sixth year, of course; not for any other reasons.)
rather stay right where I am." In case there was any doubt in Draco's mind about where, exactly, he meant, he gave him one long, slow withdraw and push, making the both of them shiver and groan. "But that's only if you're ok with it. I know some blokes are quite finished when they've finished."
On the other hand, he appreciated Draco taking the initiative since it reflected his level of investment. And the idea of dinner
There had been more than a few anxious hours, particularly during the first day, when he had feared he would be stuck with emerald green for the rest of his life.
"As you so astutely pointed out," he drawled eventually, "I don't get out much and I find myself wanting for good company of late." Here he paused to eye Harry critically. "I
Draco rolled his eyes again, much more pronounced this time at her acid tone, as he considered what he would tell her. Harry might not appreciate being outed, especially to Pansy, and even more so with Draco's name attached.
Draco's legs fell open and he spread them farther still with a hand hooked under his knee. He increased the pace of his thrusting and added a second finger, grunting and groaning, clenching and moaning as he fucked himself on his hand. His hair fanned out around him like a halo, his cheeks and chest (and gripping hole) were pink.
I don't necessarily plan to spend the rest of my life this way, but I don't have much by way of life plans in general. For now, I like it that way.
And break things. With his fists and magic both. But he was a mature, responsible adult who was in control of his feelings. (And mature, responsible adults who are in control of their feelings don't throw temper tantrums...at least according to his Mind Healer.)
Draco looked to Harry again, already devising a plan--his face one of barely kept rage and concentration.
Draco's head fell back, his eyes screwed shut, and his mouth was wide with a deep, guttural moan as he finally came all over Harry's hand. The Slytherin's body stiffened through his orgasm and his inner walls constricted on Harry's length. After a few long seconds it was done and Draco was falling limp against the bed.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Harry replied angelically, like a figure straight out of one of the room’s pastel paintings. It was a bald faced lie and they both knew it. (You could take the man out of the Aurors but you couldn’t take the Aurors out of the man.)
With a last regretful glance, Harry snuck around the building and into the back entrance, bolting the door behind him.
...Moving on to topics that are substantially less depressing and, conversely, far more interesting, I feel I must inform you that I didn't actually prompt you to call me fit. I am delighted that you think so, however. It doesn't come
"I had no clue you were so kinky... You do recall your cock was just in there, yes?" Draco teased with a small, breathy chuckle. "This teasing is not very fair..."
The door remained unlocked. He didn't think for one second about securing his home while he was so thoroughly and delightfully occupied. Voldemort himself could trapeze through fully nude and he'd not have noticed or cared.
Potter continued, undaunted, "It's been a while since we obsessively stalked each other, hasn't it?" Draco snuffed. He didn't appreciate reminders of that era after working so diligently to move past it. Potter cocked a brow at him but didn't comment.
He installed Malfoy on the machine, surreptitiously explaining how it worked and assuring him that it was perfectly safe, voice well below what any of the room's other occupants might overhear. Malfoy's grip on the foam-covered supports was white knuckled.
"Anyway, so we were dancing and the crowd was just a big jumble of people. You couldn't stand anywhere without being crushed between bodies. I was starting to feel claustrophobic and was leaving the floor when a young man approached me. He smiled like he knew me, I smiled back because he was cute... And then I noticed his hand was held tight at his side. When I looked, thinking he had somehow gotten in with his wand and might curse me, that's when I saw it. He lunged forward as he called me a '
He opened the top drawer of the large black filing cabinet--metal cold from the air conditioner vent directly overhead--and rifled through its alphabetized contents in search of 'Allard, A.' His mind and conscience continued their tandem assault, as they had done every bloody night since The Incident; 'No rest for the wicked' proven to be all-too true.
"Just make sure it's strong. I don't take anything in my tea except honey," he said with mock snootiness (and laughter in his eyes). "Perfection, Potter. I deserve only the best."
"Hurry, Draco," he urged, voice rough and ragged. "I don't need foreplay. I need your dirty, sexy mouth making me forget how to breathe."
"Come on, pet," he entreated (after swallowing his bite). "I brought some for you, too." He held the bag out to Draco. "Will you eat with me if I promise not to...what is it you say I do? 'Masticate like a Neanderthal'?"
He'd been on his feet for so long his leg felt close to giving out. But he was sure he was near a breakthrough--just a few minor adjustments to his lock-picking charm and he'd be in.
He released Malfoy's hair so he could grip the hand kneading his thigh and move it to his arse instead.
Harry scoffed at the bit about Gladys. He didn't need any extra reason to avoid the crazy old bint. At least Ron was eager to investigate, as he'd hoped (he often complained about his 'boring' Saturdays without Harry).
"I've been working on my book. I had sort of a... Rabid idea running about my head, since this one is a little more complicated than normal, and nothing I write seems to be any good today. It's frustrating!"
When he'd kissed the semi-permanent smirk right off Draco's face, he gingerly withdrew from his body to lay him on his back.
And suddenly it all made sense: Harry was being tested. Malfoy wanted to know how far he could be pushed.
If anyone had told him just three months ago that he would be dating Harry Potter, he might have slapped them in the head with one of his own books and said to get help. The idea of his nearly life-long crush choosing
Draco protested for half a second before melting into the kiss. Harry was deeply pleased by the dazed, slow-blinking expression Draco wore when he pulled away a few seconds later.
Now that's just mean. How would you like it if I showed up wearing practically nothing? It's damned unfair, is what it is.
He pushed back from the table with a harsh scrape of chair legs and stalked out of the room, putting distance between them for Draco's safety. The glasses in the cupboard vibrated noisily as he passed.
That is very open of you (and exactly like you, of course), but I do not think you comprehend the significant ramifications of such a union. You hate the press--anyone who isn't an idiot can see that--and you hate crowds. You think you are too popular now? If you date someone who was just last year an enemy of all the Wizarding world, your life will become utter chaos!
"Were you experimenting with an animal transfiguration potion?" Potter asked conversationally, facing Draco as he pulled on a pair of grey pants beneath the towel with the characteristic lack of embarrassment of one who'd spent a good deal of time in locker rooms. "Or is this an unexpected side effect of something else?"
"You have some nerve," he spat (complete with actual flecks of spittle), "to come in here claiming fatherly love, only to turn around and try to buy off something that makes your son happy, something he freely chose, and which he is the only one who gets to decide is no longer wanted." His hands shook with the effort it took to keep them at his sides.
"New rule," Harry slurred, pillowing his head on Draco's shoulder, "no talking about other people's sex lives right after we've shagged. Or before," he added after a moment's thought. "Or during."
He set about gathering his things, first by slithering into his shirt again. It was so tight he had a moment's difficulty getting it over his shoulders before it slid into place and once again hugged his torso. He left his boots to the side for now, content to wiggle his toes (which had come free of his socks at some point) in the plush cream-coloured carpet.
In good news, there are still more "Love and Letters" to come. There's about 20 stuck on Playout's phone that would take a millennia to manually remove (we did it over text) so if we can ever get those there will be even MORE than what is already coming to enjoy later~ I, in particular, have wanted to reread them for some time (we did a LOT of super fun, interesting ones I loved) and I bother her about it at least once every other month. xD
"If you aren't going to dump me, feel free to stay the night. If you are dumping me, just AK me before you go."
"I look forward to your vengeance, pet. Or should I call you 'darling'? Should we involve pet names...?" Draco shook his head and turned to Harry with a spoonful of cake and syrup. "Want a little?"
They'd experimented in the kitchen, as well, and determined that Harry should be the one to make dinner that evening, which was fine by him. He smiled to remember Draco's disastrous attempt at grilling steaks.
to meet you," Pansy's half distracted, taunting speech practically oozed with arrogance. He could just imagine her casually observing her nails with a victorious sneer while letting the cronies do as they please. "I assume Potter has long since taken that precious arse you've been saving, so it shouldn't be too rough to handle. And I'm certain the Savior would have no qualms with it. After all, aren't Gryffindors all about sharing?"
"Why did you stop?" Draco asked first, rather indignantly, as he felt Harry's cock still thick and hot inside his chute. He squeezed on him again despite feeling rather weakened. "Or have you had enough?"
Finally remembering himself, Harry took a deep, energizing breath, shook his head to clear it, and craned his neck to the left and right, releasing the pinching tension coiled there with a satisfying pop.
He turned his back sharply on Potter and began combing his matted hair into place, methodical and deliberate in his actions.
Harry was about to say he didn't need to when Arthur spoke up. "Do you think that perhaps treating your relationship like a dirty secret might...influence the way others perceive it?"
"It looks like I am lactating," the Slytherin complained. "As soon as we find a properly private place, I am going to suck your prick so hard you'll wonder if it's going to fall off!"
So, no need to come in! Stay at home, I mean it. Besides, despite his apparent bravado, Robards would never actually fire you. You're practically our poster boy, or perhaps a mascot? Either way, you're popular, important, and still the best--he's an arse, not an idiot.
"You know me so well. Let's see if what you say is true, then," Draco replied before pressing their lips together, though it was no more than a soft peck. "Though I'm not certain about sex. Not because I don't want it, and I do, but because really--how careless can you be? Sex is terrible for the flu! You'll just remain sick longer, and then who will make me soup and rub my feet when
"Not here, you bloody tease," he answered gruffly. "Just let me get these things situated, then we can go. I have to swing by my flat first, though."
Harry'd been breathlessly transfixed as Draco settled himself between his legs, but his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he loosed a desperate groan when his aching prick was palmed.
Unfortunately, the unyielding wood of the table was destroying his knees; loathe as he was to stop, things needed to be changed.
Potter laughed, heading in the direction of his bedroom. "I should probably call Hermione," he mused thoughtfully on the way.
"Well, it was a while ago, I'm afraid. About two years. I was wearing gloves that night and I put it away in that case right after so my magical signature shouldn't be on it."
Harry slumped back into the sofa, heartsore and defeated. "I hadn't thought about it that way," he admitted sheepishly. Draco harrumphed, likely owing to the fact he really should have because...well...Draco had been saying something similar for a while.
I admit, I did hate you in school, but that was a sentiment born of jealousy. And, really, jealousy is just an ugly version of admiration, isn't it? You are courageous, loyal, selfless and self-possessed. Everything I lacked. And you had the adoration and acclaim I so desperately wanted, which I had been raised to believe I was entitled to. I have done a good deal of growing up since then.
I don't know how many different ways I can say it. If I didn't want it, I wouldn't have offered. (Which I have done. Repeatedly.)
Harry remained seated and blinked slowly, his mind temporarily stalled by the conflicted directions it was being pulled in.
I almost took this letter as sincere until you began to spout that nonsense about fancying me to distraction. I know that despite all that has happened, my looks have not diminished, but I also find it highly unlikely that anyone would see me as "attractive" anymore. One's ugly actions are more visible than one's appearance, and mine were particularly gruesome. So please leave me be. Insofar as I am able, I am not bothering anyone here.
If you really want me that badly, I'll be there. Prepare to be shagged until you beg for mercy! And even then you'll at least need assistance to classes tomorrow.
Harry snorted. In a blink, he shoved Draco's legs out from under him and flipped their positions so he was the one on top, pinning Draco's arms above his head.
I still enjoy flying and playing in a pick-up match here and there, but playing professionally holds no appeal. Remember what I said about wanting a normal life? That isn't it. I've got more than enough "fans" as it is.
Draco forced thoughts of a once rejected handshake out of his mind and contemplated other ways to communicate his identity to Potter instead.
Draco Malfoy stood just on the other side of the room with a cool drink in hand. He wore a white and silver half-mask that climbed down his pointed nose with matching suit (white with silver trimming and subtle stripes) that caused his already pale features to become nearly ghost-like under short robes. His hair, usually stroked back with fragrant gel, had been tossed to the side and swept forward into his face and over his right ear.
As Harry was still a few metres out, Burnbridge didn't hear his bitten-off expletive. He wanted desperately to use the opportunity to sneak up on the scrupleless bottom-feeder and teach him a lesson about privacy and respect (and why it's not a good idea to cross wand-carrying ex-Aurors with a history of impulsiveness and excessive use of force, as Burnbridge himself was fond of citing in his hack 'reports') but that would blow his cover. Even an unseen hex would be linked back to him eventually. There was a chance, albeit slim, Burnbridge didn't know for certain Harry worked there. No sense confirming his suspicions.
He did some hasty straightening on his way to the kitchen to fetch tea. He wasn't going to give Malfoy the grand tour or anything, but neither did the man need to see his pants laying on the ground.
Aww, Darling, do you not want me to change? You love me for who I am and all that rot? How sweet! Never fear, your favorite person in all the world will remain as sophisticated and charming as he always was upon your return.
“What now?” Harry asked. He didn’t want to stop but he also wasn’t convinced they should continue. What would Hermione do?
Draco gave Harry a look that clearly said, "Really?" as his glass was filled. He took a small swig of it, as it was too full for the usual swish and sniff routine he preferred to enjoy before his first sip. It smelled almost like roses with a rich color and velvety texture to match.
"If it helps," he added after they'd parted, "Ron is at least as uneasy as you. This is an excellent opportunity to surprise him with your wit and charm."
Finding himself somewhat preoccupied by the fact Malfoy, for all his proper Pureblood training, was speaking with his mouth full, Harry was slow to reply.
Thankfully, Malfoy didn't seem to mind. He just peered up at Harry from beneath his fringe and gave that half smirk that did unspeakable things to Harry’s pulse rate.
"You're right... I may never like you, ever. I can't easily forgive you for what you did. And I certainly doubt I'll ever be comfortable with you around my home or my daughter, but it doesn't mean we can't be civil when we do have to interact."
A familiar husky drawl and caress to the back of his neck sent his thoughts scattering. "You work too hard," Draco declared, having slunk silently up behind him like the serpent he was named for. He removed Harry's glasses and placed them on the desk before rolling his chair out to straddle his lap.
Draco purposely swam in and out of the crowd until he was merely a few feet from the object of his current fascination. He finished his glass and set it aside to take another (only his second for the night. He knew it would take more than two cups of cheap champagne to get his tolerance squirming.) He swung his hips in a certain way and walked right in front of Potter's view--merely a foot or two away and then slowly (purposely) away toward the buffet. Making sure he was well in view the entire time and discretely looking at Potter to check his engagement.
He didn't wait for Draco's answer, instead walking further into the house to put distance between himself and temptation incarnate.
"I'm not lazy," Harry argued, crawling over to retrieve the lube as ordered. "I'm just easier to please than you." The phrase 'high maintenance' came to mind but he daren't give voice to it while Draco was positioning himself on his hands and knees with his arse on display just for Harry.
His body thrummed with nervous energy and he absently scratched at his ears for want of something better to do, the rapid
The room wasn't large, so it was fortunate that neither one of them was much interested in personal space just then. Maneuvering around Draco, Harry adjusted the taps so the water would start heating (the plumbing in Grimmauld Place was muggle, magically enhanced) and turned to attack the buttons of Draco's waistcoat.
And I did not leave the country to avoid talking to you, twat. This holiday has been on my calendar for three months and you knew about it well in advance. You were probably plotting to help yourself to my belongings the moment I set foot out the door!
Considering I do nearly all the chores (at your own admission), including the cooking, I think it only fair for you to buy the food.
Harry was overcome with sympathy but he kept a lid on it, knowing intuitively it would put Malfoy's hackles up.
Draco turned his head to kiss Harry's neck, from his collar-bone (where he nipped) to the edge of his jaw (which he licked.) He nuzzled into the soft skin just below his ear.
you had caught me." He set his fork beside his plate and folded his arms on the edge of the table to lean closer to Harry, feeling playful and energized. "But let's not dwell on 'what ifs' or my hair (even though it
"I'll do anything you want me to it you'll only spare my life," Draco replied in an overly dramatic tone. He grinned.
Malfoy swallowed and gave it a go. After a few overly-cautious, ungainly steps, he got the hang of it--as Harry knew he would--and set to climbing an invisible tower, a frown of concentration of his face. (The man, Harry was learning, had a great many frowns, but at least he was game to try.) He leaned heavily on the arm bars for support--not because his legs couldn't take the whole of his weight, but because he was no longer sure on his feet.
Harry eyed Malfoy's hands skeptically. He wasn't the handholding type. If he was going to do it, it was something that had to be worked up to, not done one hour into maybe dating someone he was feeling somewhat petulant toward (or one minute after the frustrating end of some really excellent snogging).
Harry briefly entertained the idea of storming off, but he quickly thought better of it. Janine, batty as she was, hadn't meant any harm. It wasn't fair to take his frustration out on her. Besides, she was a patient.
It was also nice having someone to talk to over dinner, he reflected. He'd been puttering around the house by himself for too long.
"I'll bring wine and salad next week," she declared. "If you love me, you'll make dessert. If you love Ron, you'll serve red meat. Oh and please let Draco know I plan to grill him on all the details of his next book. I'm so impatient for it to come out!" She then kissed him on the cheek and sent him out the door because she had work to do.
," he used the word disdainfully, "I’ve got a bone to pick with him and I won't be leaving until I'm satisfied."
The blonde jerked his hips forward towards Potter's hands, indicating his own eagerness to be touched.
He turned to face Draco and found him huddled by the doorway, obviously frightened. He was impossibly torn between wanting to comfort him and wanting to shake some sense into his thick bloody skull. Ultimately, he could do neither.
Draco pumped his fist until Harry was fully spent and then held him close, with both arms wrapped around his lover's trim waist. He nuzzled the nape of Harry neck with a smug, lazy grin--ignoring his own still pulsing erection.
Draco quirked a brow as his legs were lifted and spread apart. He knew Harry wouldn't do anything untoward, like suddenly penetrate him, but there was a leap in his stomach of anxiety none-the-less. He gripped the headboard above him tight, and then nearly ripped one of the bars out as his sensitive bud was suddenly tasted.
“What are you playing at, Malfoy?” Harry all-but growled, shooting up to his feet. His hands prickled, skin feeling far too tight, as embarrassment, confusion, anger, and want warred for dominance within him. “Why are you flirting with me? If you want to punish me that’s fine. I get it. I’m sure I deserve it. But
The sound Draco made as Potter was dragged off could have been called a snort, but only by someone so uncultured as to fail to recognize the difference between such a boorish noise and an appropriately refined
"Wouldn't dream of it," he answered mirthfully, just before lifting Draco off the mattress with a sizable thrust that startled a gasp out of his lover. "I've got you exactly where I want you," he added, following the declaration with a steady pumping of his hips.
,” Malfoy said again, directing the wand this time toward each of the extinguished lamps. And just like that, the room was bathed once more in their comforting pink-tinged glow. It didn’t get past Harry that this spell, unlike the ones that had preceded it, was cast with deliberation and control.
"What can I say? I'm rich," he thrust hard enough to move the desk a little, "handsome," he bit down on Potter's neck and fluxed his hips again, "and make a damn fine cup of tea."
"I don't want someone else," he answered tightly some moments later. He looked away as he said it, withdrawing in upon himself and crossing one arm over his skinny chest, locking it in the opposite elbow.
With a victorious shout, Harry finally popped the lock. He stumbled heavily through the doorway, pinning Draco to the wall to rut against him. Holding his arms above his head and shoving a thigh between his legs, he sucked a vibrant lovebite into the thin skin of Draco's neck.
' had only gone to the publisher last week and already he had written two hundred pages of a rough draft for a new one--he'd really found his niche as an author it seemed).
"Rosie is almost a year. She's got the Weasley ginger gene and Hermione's curly hair. Fortunately for her, she takes more after her mother in the looks department," he smirked. "She's sharp as tack and devious enough already to have us worried she'll be sorted Slytherin."
"Aw, but I like the feel of you wrapped around me like this," Harry half-whinged, but he agreed it would be difficult to carry Draco around in stilletos. He hesitantly set his partner down, immediately turning him around and pressing him against the cool stones of the hearth. He grabbed Draco's hips and rocked his silk-covered cock in the crevice of Draco's arse.
Harry took the offered forkful if for no reason other than his need for a pleasant diversion. It was a good one, at least. The cheesecake was smooth and tangy, the fruit acidic and not too sweet (but still enough to make his jaw tingle).
"Tell you what," he wryly bargained, propping himself up onto his elbows, tone that of a seasoned businessman, "you get me off again using whatever tools you fancy and you'll have yourself a deal."
Harry mulled it over. Truthfully, he didn’t know how such a dry spell would affect someone, either. Hardly a waking hour went by that he didn’t cast at least one charm or another. Yet again, he found himself wondering what a day in Malfoy‘s life actually looked like. And yet again, that seemingly innocent train of thought sped right off the rails into visions of Malfoy dressing and bathing and lounging and... otherwise occupying his time
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious reference, but the Auror's speech caused a grin to once again light up his face. He squeezed his lover's hand and did his best to suppress the blush that threatened.
Harry didn't know what to say. Every last detail of Draco's too casual explanation was a surprise, except that Narcissa was beautiful and Lucius paranoid and possibly insane. The bit about him being bent (and with
It was also the reason Draco had eliminated Amortentia from his Newt-level curriculum. (What he'd told Minerva was that the potion was too dangerous in the hands of hormone-addled adolescents, which was factually accurate.)
His smirk turned into a feral grin as a hint of possessive jealousy crept into his words. "How many other blokes have done this for you, I wonder."
Feeling vindicated, he shook his wand out of its holster and into his hand, pausing a moment to request permission. When Potter made no protest, he cast a gentle, yet effective scourgify to lift the topmost layer of sweat and grime from the man's body and finished with a useful little spell he'd learned in school for dealing with inopportune erections. Potter gasped and cupped his rapidly deflating member, glaring bloody murder at Draco for the trick (the sensation was akin to dunking one's anatomy in a bucket of ice water; in a word, unpleasant. He made no move to cast the spell on himself--his robes hid the situation in his pants more than adequately. He did, however, point the wand at his head to restyle his hair and calm the flush in his cheeks.
"Do you know the effect of repeated and sustained Cruciatus on one's nervous system?" Malfoy asked after a minute, startling Harry with the suddenness of the question and the intensity of his storm-grey gaze.
The divulging was quite easy really--I just put quill to paper and there you go. That and the fact I wasn't trying to impress you at the outset made it easier to be honest about things I haven't shared with others before (like the fact I considered having a sham marriage). You've responded so well it made it so that I could keep being honest, even now when I kinda do want to impress you because I've been reminded of just how much I fancied you fifth and sixth year (yes, even when you were being a gigantic tit).
Since you seem to be amused by muggle things and are constantly using tempus charms to check the time (due, I assume, to your habitual tardiness), I had this item custom tailored for you. It is called a "wristwatch." I was informed that it is functionally the same as a pocket-watch, but the time is displayed numerically as with a tempus (so you don't have to fuss with deciphering the little hands and Roman numerals). The colour is a basic black for mission purposes. It is purported to be waterproof and shock resistant, though I do not know how well it will stand up against offensive spells.
If only every owl read like your last. Usually I only hear those sorts of things from my mother (and you can understand, I'm sure, why I'd rather hear them from someone like you).
Draco heard the familiar and somewhat silly knock he had heard a number of times since taking up with the Savior and instantly grinned. He cleared his throat, leaned into his front door, and asked in a silly, high-pitched voice, "Who iiiiis it?"
Draco snorted, both for the "infamous" comment and for the jab at Slytherin loyalty, before cocking a grin and slowly turning his head to face the Auror once more. He opened one silver eye lazily.
"Make yourself comfortable," Potter offered, placing Draco on the sofa whilst he went into the kitchenette to do Merlin-knows-what.
Draco was at his office desk when a familiar "tap tap tap" at the window caught his attention. He was having a bit of writer's block, so at the sound of a tiny, feathered visitor he smiled and thanked the bird silently for the momentary reprieve from work (even if his next book was due in a month and he had hardly finished the first chapter.)
Draco shook his head. They'd give someone a sizable shock if triggered, but that didn't qualify as nasty in his book. (Although living with the Dark Lord might have skewed his perspective somewhat.) He'd seen enough of Potter in action to be reasonably sure he could handle them.
Unfortunately, the reverberation of the sound set off the dry, hacking cough he couldn't seem to shake.
Harry was no stranger to the morbid. His education had included thorough training on the assessment of and the referral and treatment process for suicidal ideation (not uncommon in someone dealing with disability) and his own life had led him to some...dark places. But he'd never heard someone speak so cavalierly about their fate. It was unnerving.
He was also relieved (not really, though) that Malfoy had put his abandoned shirt back on. He could still see every contour of the man's trim torso, but at least he wasn't being tempted by the creamy expanse of skin any longer.
, he added in his head without bothering to hide the sting of it (unvoiced to avoid an argument). "Whatever. Let's just--"
The temperature inside was perfectly pleasant and the air fragrant without being cloying. An artificial stream burbled merrily along one side. The table set in the middle of it all was pretty, but not overwrought. Honestly, the food could be rubbish and he'd still probably have a decent enough time just looking at everything.
"Besides," he added wryly, "it's all coming off later anyway, isn't it? Gieves will be here any minute. Unlike
Dragging a hand down his dripping face, Harry mentally prepared himself for the day ahead. If the last night and his subsequent rousing were any indication, it was going to be a long one.
Draco considered Harry's offer for a cut with a vaulted brow as he stuffed a piece of chicken into his mouth and chewed experimentally.
Ron paled slightly. He looked to Hermione for help but none would be found in that corner--she shut him out cold to do as she'd promised and pepper Draco with questions about his latest manuscript. With no other recourse, he stood slowly and slunk out of the room after Harry, who closed the door behind them with a thud and rounded on his best friend and partner.
Draco couldn't stop the breathy laugh that bubbled up at Harry's smart comment. He flashed a fox's smile as he leaned far over the table to say, "I'm up for whatever, as long as you're going to keep me in the morning. But I think the bed would be the best, me being a virgin and all..."
Harry shrugged. "I follow the evidence where it leads. And I learned a long time ago not to discount or underestimate anyone. For good or for ill." He thought of Snape, Pettigrew, Neville, even Malfoy. So many times his assumptions, and those of others, were catastrophically off the mark.
Draco sighed (mentally) as he had a feeling that would be the next subject Harry would want to discuss (it was at least the fifth time he had brought it up, after all.) But it wasn't easy to just divulge his feelings where that subject was involved, as he was stuck between the way he should be feeling (and did feel underneath, perhaps) and the way he had trained himself to feel.
Draco tried to laugh off the fact he'd forgotten to lock the door but Harry wasn't fooled--it was obvious it had rattled him. Harry almost said there was nothing to worry about as long as he was there to protect him, but it seemed far too early for that kind of statement--if things didn't progress beyond that night, it would just be cruel.
I myself am overjoyed that my sentence is almost complete. I will probably cast spells for an hour before leaving the house. I miss my wand terribly.
Truthfully, he and Potter had managed to establish a polite, if frosty, rapport for the sake of their positions within the school. With the Gryffindor on the Pitch most days and Draco in the dank bowels of the castle, they really only saw each other at meal times and staff meetings and did a fair job of pretending the other didn't exist when that happened. Their exceedingly rare instances of conversation were mostly limited to grunts and nods anyway, so perhaps his mission wouldn't be as difficult as he feared. After all, Potter had a hero's reputation to uphold...
"It was beautiful. I love music with emotion instead of the usual dead-pan more recent works use. You know, that 'deep' and dark tone that many of today's composers think you've never heard before but had already been mastered and used?"
like him." At his side, Draco made a small noise that could have been anything, really, but he chose to think of it as amusement. Others' reactions were distinctly less positive.
Draco abandoned the task before his thirst was fully slaked to groom himself into a semblance of tidiness. Potter set the dish on the low table and reclined back into the cushions of the sofa, propping an ankle over his knee and twisting the cap off his beverage. He looked like he wanted to say something but was interrupted by the sudden
He brought his free hand to the bulge in Draco's trousers and palmed his prick through the material. Draco bucked into the touch and Harry rewarded him by kneading firmly. With nimble fingers, he undid Draco's trousers and reached inside to grasp the hot skin of his prick. He was coming to enjoy the sensation immensely.
Harry the therapist was a confident man. He knew what he was doing. He didn't second guess himself when pompous prats raised their eyebrows at him.
It was definitely different from a toy. Harry was hot, his velvety skin moved and bunched with Draco's movements, and the flavour was musky and bittersweet. He loved it. He took a deep breath before sliding even further, inhaling deeply the scent that was all
Retrieving his discarded wand to conjure some lube, he pinned Draco with his knees against his hips, his flaccid prick nestled in the soft curve of his arse, and placed kisses across his shoulders. He reached both hands around him. His right, coated with clear, shining lubricant, resumed its efforts on Draco's prick, gliding easily over the velvety skin now. His left, open-palmed, trailed possessively over the hard plain of Draco's abdomen before cupping and kneading one of his pectorals.
He moaned into Harry's mouth at the heady urgency of his kisses as he clasped his hands over his (boyfriend's?) trim waist. Their lips slid together and Draco's tongue darted inside. It was hot, wet, and wonderful.
Yes, that means I, too, find you desirable. Or in laymen's terms, I fancy the pants off you. Always did, you blind fool.
It was a fair request. It really was. Especially considering what Draco was about to do for him. Harry was just having difficulty with words at the moment.
That wasn't something he had said out loud before. He peered sideways at his boyfriend and caught the glimmer of a small, pleased smile before the Malfoy mask fell back into place.
It's that time of year again, folks! That's right, Christmas has arrived and the entire Ministry will be conducting a Secret Santa event to show some interdepartmental cooperation in the spirit of the season!
How am I supposed to know if you are bisexual or not? That seems like a question for either a Mind Healer or a discreet rent boy. Or both.
I've properly cleaned your desk so we should have plenty of room to shag there once you're better. I refuse to get any foreign fluids on mine.
"Godrick," he choked, stumbling into Draco. "Were you intentionally trying to turn my bathroom into a sauna?"
"Malfoy," he prodded verbally (keeping his hands respectfully to himself). "Malfoy, wake up!" No answer...except that Malfoy snuggled in harder. Harry sighed heavily. "If you do not get up this instant, I will dump you on the floor," he threatened.
For the first time since Draco had quite literally waltzed back into his life, things were going smoothly for Harry. They'd hashed out a number of sore subjects in one difficult (but not horrible) conversation, they were getting along well in general and had settled to the point that Harry could actually focus on, say, work rather than distracting thoughts of Draco, and he was, rather surprisingly, content.
