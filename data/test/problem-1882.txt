“Harry,” He started, and the other boy's eyes swivelled back to him when called. “What are you doing for Christmas?”
He grinned. “Are we going to find the Chamber?”
“And I don’t want to know, thank you very much.”
They continued giggling until they finally got to Herbology, for which they were severely late for, but McGonagall had sorted out everything so it wasn’t an issue, but they were given extra homework to catch up.
“Well, I’m off, I said I’d meet Hermione. Bye!”
“You’re beautiful.” Harry whispered, as though it was a secret only they knew. Draco pressed their foreheads together and focused on their stilted breathing, to calm his pounding heart. It was such a strange sensation, to feel in love. A sensation that Draco never thought he would feel. Sure, his parents were in love, but he always just thought that it was such a rare thing that he would never have it. But he knew then that he could never feel about anyone the way that he felt about Harry in that moment.
“Yes?” The boy turned around and eyed the trio warily, stilling slightly on Draco and blushing. “Who are you?”
The class did as he told, none of them daring to utter a syllable.
Sirius sighed and tilted his back to look at the trees. Draco copied his action. “I just want you to protect your heart.”
There was a long silence where neither of them knew what to say, until Draco simply started cleaning up and Harry started talking about how hilarious it was to see Crabbe and Goyle make that Hippogriff so angry. Draco tried to laugh along with his friend, but it was difficult. He didn’t like the new feeling of dread that was pooling into his stomach like a sick weight, the fear that Divination may not be so stupid as he’d made it out to be.
Remus sat up straight in his chair also looking at Harry worriedly, now. “You’re sure?” he asked, voice stern.
“But then I explained to Sirius that Dumbledore would be doing something about it, if that were the case.” Remus exhaled, but seized up again when he realised that they were still building up to something.
“What about my dad?” Harry whispered, so quietly it could barely be heard by himself.
“Dumbledore gave me this?”
“I know.” They giggled. “My turn!”
“Sorry, Rem.” he whispered. “We woke you up, didn’t we?” Remus tentatively sat up, trying to avoid his wounds and rubbed his eyes clear of groggy sleep-dust, as his mother used to call it.
Thankfully, Dumbledore saved him, and sent the dementors running straight after, but it was a miracle that Harry was okay, that his broom was the only thing that had broken.
“‘Ello Harry, and ‘oos yer friend there?” Hagrid eyed Draco’s bright hair suspiciously and Draco looked nervous, seemingly confused at what the large man was staring at.
He caught the Snitch within twenty minutes. He tried to explain it away, citing that it was just dumb luck, but he knew that he had been trying to beat his friend with every ounce of his being.
“And he’d get them matching fire and ice baby grows for when they were little.”
“THE ONE WHO USED TO OWN THE BOOK!”
It was like art. To him, art had always been beyond research or analytics, which, as someone who would spend most of his time in the library, was a big thing to say. Art was never meant to be ripped apart, or graded on, or analysed. It was meant to be enjoyed as a simple constant. In life, he was happy to content himself with being in the dark about some things. Perhaps one day it would be revealed that he was some child of a stupid prophecy, or a reincarnation of an ancient spirit, but he didn’t care.
The blond smirked back. “Why would you ask that?”
Here, Harry gasped lightly. Snape hadn’t seemed to notice, however, as the insults were still being written by a seemingly invisible hand.
So the boys ducked under the invisibility cloak, once again, and tiptoed into the Hospital Wing, only to find the girl herself, rigid and still, holding a mirror in one hand and a balled up piece of paper in the other. With trembling hands, Draco reached out and pried it from her fingers, flattening it out against the bed.
“What’re you freaking out about, mate?” he scoffed. “I’m the one who has to make the big speech, you can just take it easy!”
“That’s a phoenix.” Riddle breathed, staring at it confusedly.
“Doesn’t know what he’s saying.” said Lockhart, whipping out his wand. “Not to worry, Harry. I’m about to fix your arm.”
I just realised how bloody long this is going to be. It's already the length of the first one and they aren't even at Hogwarts yet lol
Remus had only three memories in his life that were powerful enough to cast a Patronus. First, his wedding, specifically the moment when their lips met after James had announced that they were legally married, Remus knew then that even if he died in the war, he would do it happily so long as he died knowing that he was joined to the love of his life for all eternity. Second, the day that Draco turned seven, when he finally looked around to see the family he had longed for all his life, when he realised that he had what he’d daydreamed about having, but never thought he would. And third, the day that little ball of hope first sprouted in his chest, melting the chains that constricted his heart, lighting the way to a brighter tomorrow. If that memory hadn’t happened, Remus wasn’t sure if he would have lived to experience the other two.
The witch smiled comfortingly. “Of course you can, dear.”
btw TW I don't use any homophobic slurs in this chapter, I'm trying to avoid the use of homophobic slurs in this series even when homophobic jerks come in, but Narcissa is homophobic and horrible about it so if you aren't too cool with that, just be wary of the Narcissa scene. <3
“What do you suggest then?” Dumbledore said, stroking his chin.
Remus seemed to pause to think for a moment. “You don’t mind if I keep the map, do you, Harry?” Harry grimaced slightly. “You know I can’t let you keep it.” The corners of his mouth turned up a little in fond exasperation. “And anyway, I need it if I’m going to find Peter!”
Draco nodded slowly and took a long drink from his Moon Frog Juice.
Flint shook hands with the captain of the Gryffindor team, Oliver Wood, and they held their gaze for perhaps a little longer than was necessary. He privately thought that the pair clearly harboured some unaddressed feelings for one another, but held is tongue as he realised that he wasn’t one to talk.
“Why don’t you guys like him?”
“I think the better question is, can we help you?” George said mysteriously, sharing a look with Fred and smirking. Harry furrowed his brow, and was about to ask what they were on about, when George grabbed his right arm while Fred grabbed the left, and he was being dragged down the stairs roughly.
Sirius paused a little before he could formulate an answer. “Yeah, I’m fine, kid. Go hang out with Harry, for a bit.”
When Draco was sorted, there wasn’t silence, but their faces screamed expectancy, that they knew it was coming. He didn’t completely understand why but chalked it down to the fact that he just looked the part. With Harry, however, you could hear a pin drop. Draco was reluctant to even start clapping since it seemed like no one else was doing it but, catching sight of Harry’s face made him sure that he should support him, so he did, but nobody joined in. Dumbledore’s usually blank mask had fallen into one of polite confusion and worry, and the expression of everyone else varied from outraged to downright bewildered.
“Umm… try ‘
“Why not?” Draco lifted up his arm and Harry cuddled in. “Once upon a time there was a miller: he was poor, but he had a beautiful daughter. Now it happened one day…”
“I know. But he’ll be fine. He’s more than powerful enough, Merlin knows.”
As I was baking this transcendent cake I thought to myself, what would Amortentia smell like to me? And then I thought, I wonder what Amortentia would smell like for my readers...
Sirius pinched the bridge of his nose, a habit he picked up with every letter Draco sent. “Shouldn’t we tell them? Maybe it’s time.”
“Oh, son of a Hippogriff, seriously?” said Draco, rolling his eyes. Of course they now had to deal with a dragon. “Weasley, isn’t your brother a dragon expert or something? Can’t we just get him over here to take the dragon?”
“I don’t feel anything.” Draco shot him a look of disbelief before continuing with his spellwork. Harry, however, was still confused. He was cold, very cold. So cold that he felt it to his bones. He reached out for Draco’s knitted blanket and wrapped it around himself like a cocoon. He felt minutely better, if only for the smell of Draco that now surrounded him. Harry rubbed his hands together and held them closer to the fire, still no difference.
Draco’s vision was blurred with tears and pure anger, he had never felt a hatred like this before, not even for Voldemort. Part of him was disgusted at this new feeling, and continued to flash images of Christmases by the heath with his family, of Harry after catching the Snitch in that final Quidditch game and kissing him like he would never get another opportunity, of Pads teaching him to ride a broom, but the other part of him was revelling in it, basking in the feeling, begging Draco to let go and to let it take over. Lucius was saying something to him but he genuinely didn’t care what the content of those words were, all he knew was that his father was the worst type of a person, a waste, a mistake. He wished with all his being that they weren’t related but it didn’t change the fact that looking at him was like looking into the future and it was soul-destroying.
“It shows us what we want… whatever we want…”
“The Brothers Grimm.” he read. The book itself was exquisitely bound. It was dark blue leather with small, gold embellishments here and there. Vines with thorns on them, a spindle, an apple. It was truly magnificent. On the inside were dozens  of stories.
“Somebody either broke our trust or spied on us and we were forced to tell our child before you were ready!”
“Are you okay, Harry?”
“We’ll visit you when we go into the village!”
*    *    *     *     *
“But we’re all older.”
“I do.” Sirius could fly; he was so happy.
“Probably something to do with life extension, look at how old he is.” He murmured, fascinated. “I wonder why someone extending their life is a good thing.”
“Back from where, honey?” Remus asked, breaking off a few chunks of chocolate and handing it to him.
It took a few tries, but Harry could definitely see something define forming.
“Sirius, Remus…” he called in a tiny voice.
But Harry wasn’t listening, he was more concerned with the lack of the voice in his ears, and the hideous sight before him. A shining, red puddle one the floor, and words written in blood on the wall.
Draco shook his head ruefully. “I’m scared.” His voice was weak, wavering and trembling tearfully. Harry engulfed him in a hug and allowed him to bury his head in his chest, listening to his heartbeat. He probably could have cried, but he’d done enough of that and it made him feel like he was on display. Instead, he just told Harry what he was scared to tell his dads. “I’m scared because I look just like him. I’m scared because I think he’s going to come after me. I’m scared because I think I let him out. I’m scared because the dream felt so real.”
“Better than James, even.”
Draco was wistfully gazing at the doors of the Great Hall, out of which the Professor had just exited. Harry elbowed him, inexplicably angry.
With the room spinning on its axis, Sirius was beginning to feel very dizzy, so closed his eyes and began focusing on other things. Chocolate cake, the wedding presents they’ll get to open afterwards. They remembered the delicate constellation tattoo on Remus’s ankle. And the matching one he had on his lower back. He and Remus were intertwined, always would be. This day meant nothing in the scheme of things, it was only another way to show that fact to the world. The day was fated. Nothing could go wrong.
“What, drop my wand?” Harry was so unprepared, clearly Draco had more experience than he did.
“Really? What?” Draco perked his head up and grinned at his father.
This shut him up. He sat back down on the floor from where he had unknowingly risen, and looked at Draco as though he were a bug on the bottom of his shoe.
“It is dangerous, sir. Dobby is hearing about awful plan.” Sirius turned his head back to Remus, who now crouched by the chair and looked Dobby dead in his huge, glassy eyes.
“You know what else will be crushed if we don’t get rid of the dragon? Hogwarts. Owl your brother.” So the Weasley Owled his brother. To which he replied with an affirmative, that they would be taking the dragon on Saturday. But, before that, the four had to trudge their way down to Hagrid’s hut to witness the hatching. It was actually quite fascinating. They way it clawed its way through the thick shell and then fixed it’s eye on Hagrid immediately. It almost made Draco feel bad for taking it, but not quite. After much convincing, Saturday finally rolled around and Harry and Draco had the task of delivering the dragon to Charlie Weasley’s friends. Ron had wanted to come but he had received an awful bite from Norbert (that was the name of the blasted thing) and had to stay in the hospital wing. Still, Draco was happy to help if it meant getting rid of the stupid baby dragon. For some unknown reason, Draco was filled with a gross hate for the thing. He tried not to dwell on it, telling himself that it was just because he didn’t like animals, but on the way back something happened. Even though he had no memory of it. According to Harry, he noticed a small scorch mark on his trousers and had ripped off the cloak in the middle of the hall, which was strange because he had absolutely no recollection of it. And they got caught. And now they had detention. With Hagrid. Great.
“Oh he looks ghastly.” Draco giggled. “Didn’t anyone ever tell him that you shouldn’t mix pink and red?” Pansy joined in now, cackling at the idiot, before he called for everyone’s attention. Harry quickly sat down next to Draco and gave the man about half of his attention.
“Oh… Mr Potter… Mr Malfoy…” he said, opening the door just a little wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment. if you would be quick… “
“And now you have to get
Sirius and Draco went for a midday walk before all the singing shenanigans began through Hogsmeade town and then venturing into the outskirts of the forest.
I may have to take a little while off because I have mocks next week but I'll be back... oh boy will I be back. I have big plans for this thing.
He nearly cried, then. “Please don’t, Harry. You’re too important to me.” Draco couldn’t imagine his life without the stupid boy sat in front of him.
“We know all this, Dumbledore, get on with it.” The man was not put out in the slightest by Sirius’s interruption, instead seemed to have expected it.
He couldn’t contain it anymore, Harry leaped into Draco's arms and hugged him. “Amazing.”
Because of both of their Firebolts, Draco and Harry weren’t allowed to be on the same team, people said it was too much of an advantage. The game was intense and exciting. Draco seemed very happy to be utilising his Chaser skills, and Charlie was a very worthy opponent as Seeker. Ron seemed to be decent enough at keeping, and Sirius seemed to be in his element, slamming bludgers back and forth with the Weasley twins, which wasn’t even the aim of the game. Harry had never seen him happier, as though he were twenty years younger. Remus took over commentating duties and Harry was shocked by how hilarious the man was. He almost fell off his broom at one point after a particularly funny comment about McGonagall and Sirius, when they were locked in a high speed chase. He had said something about how tiresome cats and dogs could be, which was only understood by those who knew about Sirius’s animagus form, which made it all the more hilarious.
Both of them had chosen simple platinum bands for each other, but on the inside had engraved stars and moons to make them more personal.
He shared a look with his husband that said everything. They were going to get their family through the darkness, someone was going to turn on a light.
He even focused on Peter, who stood waiting for him as his best man.
“Probably.” Remus answered. “We were only aware of the sword up until last night, though.”
“Mr Malfoy, what is the danger level for a werewolf in your textbook?”
“Haven’t you guessed yet?” He lifted his wand and traced it through the air, leaving behind three shimmering words.
“Look, we think that Snape is trying to steal whatever Fluffy is guarding! Please, help usssss…” Harry had turned on the puppy eyes that Draco simply couldn’t resist. They were terrifyingly green. Suddenly, a light bulb switched on in his head and he watched Harry beg for a few more seconds before huffing indignantly.
“You should do it, Moony.” he murmured, lovingly.
The man perked his head up and grinned childishly. “Yes, Star.”
“Severus, I am sure that they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.” said Dumbledore, as he gave Snape a pointed look. The other wizard entertained it for a few moments before turning to Harry and Draco.
“Nope.”
As always, thank you for reading! It means so much to me xxx
“Fine. But hold tight.” The machine rose unsteadily but Draco kept his head on. So long as he stayed calm, he was sure that he could figure it out.
“Where did you learn that?”
tattoo, which has the
“When?”
“Draco, we don’t know how he got out, but you didn’t have anything to do with it. This was all just some big coincidence, all you need to be worried about now is keeping yourself safe.” His voice was like hot chocolate on a cold day. It warmed Draco up on the inside so much that he needed to get closer. He leaned forward and connected their lips in a sweet, unhurried kiss. It wasn’t like the last one they shared, hurried and messy and full of adrenaline, but it wasn’t any less passionate. He reached his hand up and tangled it in Harry’s messy hair, tugging him even closer. The boy obliged and responded by cupping Draco’s face with a warm hand. It only lasted about twenty seconds, and Draco wished it could have gone on for longer, but the presence of his dad put an end to it.
Harry put a soothing hand on his back that he flicked away immediately. He also kicked away Pansy’s annoying rubbing of his knee. He stood up.
So the dark-haired boy resigned himself to waiting for his bones to regrow, which turned out to be just as painful as it sounded, if not more so. Draco was infuriated. Any fancy that he once had for Lockhart had disapparated, and all his attention was focused on Harry. He spent every possible moment he could at the boy’s bedside, doing his best to make the pain go away. But he couldn’t. That had been a problem for him as long as he could remember. He vaguely remembered the face of his mother, but it was always distressed and upset and all he wanted to do was wipe her frown away, but couldn’t. Or whenever Moony came back from what he now knew was a transformation, and no amount of hugs could make him look less tired or get the sad glint out of his eyes.
“James,” she called, smiling. “You’ve got to go in now, I’ll take it from here.”
Sorry for the long wait. I've just found out that my GCSEs are officially cancelled. It was annoying at first but looking over my grades I'm not too worried.
Draco gasped as the man nodded, why did that name sound familiar?
“It’s okay, dad, everyone makes mistakes. I just really want an explanation.”
Draco squealed and ran over to his father when he heard the news.
“That’s right, Gilderoy.” said Sprout. “Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”
“The Shrieking Shack.”
"I'll see you later, Star." said Sirius. Draco looked up at his father.
“Well, don’t take this the wrong way, Harry, but I sort of understand where he’s coming from.”
“We play fair, Flint, unlike some people.” he replied, coolly.
“Nothing, we’re just surrounded by piles of gold.”
“That’s you.”
Alright, question of the day, if you could go to any of the magical schools in the Harry Potter universe, which would you go to (Hogwarts is a perfectly valid answer)
“Don’t ‘sweetheart’ me!”
“But he has it, doesn’t he?” he was panting with the effort of trying to keep up with his friend, who was a surprisingly good runner when he needed to be. “Didn’t he say so? That seems like a pretty big lie.”
Harry all at once remembered what he saw and sat up straight in his chair. “No! I saw Pettigrew on the map! And when I got to the hallway he was in, I saw Scabbers!”
?” Draco replied snarkily. He honestly didn’t see the point of it at all, he much preferred taking Arithmancy with Hermione, that, at least, was useful.
He carefully weaved his hand into it, slowly so as not to arouse suspicion, and slid it out.
“Good evening, Vincent, Gregory.” greeted Dumbledore, ever politely.
But Harry didn’t give up. Far from that, actually. There was something in him, deep down in his core, his father’s voice, he told himself, that said that the map was always right. So he donned the cloak and ventured into the halls long past Draco fell asleep one night, all the while consulting the map, which showed Peter Pettigrew in one of the halls on the fifth floor.
“So do I. But you know it’s the right thing to do.”
“I’ll firecall Dumbledore.” she said, crossing over to the fireplace. “Although it seems to be that we have a very convenient place right on the school grounds that Mr Lupin-Black used when he was in school.”
Harry snorted and doubled over. “What?” he said through giggles.
“it’s okay, Draco, you can have my place. He’s really good, Ron.” The boy made to move out of his space but Draco immediately felt guilty and awkward.
“Moony and Pads were teenagers when they made this. I don’t think it was beyond them to make a mistake.”
“Thank you, Draco.” The pair shared a look that carried more weight than they spoke about. “But, I did get a letter from Harry.”
star in it.” Remus murmured, arm now draped across his eyes.
How are you guys, anyway? Y'all have been a bit quiet x I hope you're good, half term is over for me now so we have to start up at school again but with the second lockdown I honestly wonder how long that's going to last. How was Halloween for you guys? My friend and I made shortbread and cinnamon rolls (they were really good) and then I spent most of the morning writing this. I really hope it's okay I've planned this one out for a while and I usually have my sister proofread for me but she's asleep so I don't want to wake her up and I wanted to get it posted so ahh haha
Harry shrugged. “It could just be Moody.”
“Thanks, Moony.”
The teams took to the skies again, and the balls were released once more. It seemed that everything was going well, until Harry again found himself on the wrong end of a bludger.
Sirius was really nervous. Which didn’t go with his image at all.
“You see, the ten other governors contacted me and asked for me back.” stated the headmaster. “They were under the impression that Arthur Weasley’s daughter was dead, and they felt that I was the best man for the job.”
“I want one.” he said.
Okay. He couldn’t wait. Any longer. He had to be married to this incredible person.
Draco felt calmer now. He didn’t mind people whispering about him, but people whispering about his parents? Sure, he had been dealing with it his whole life, but for it to be used against them like that, so cruelly. And as for the most shocking part, Draco didn’t quite know how he felt about Moony being a werewolf, the nickname made more sense now. He still loved him, but he wasn’t sure if he still trusted him, Draco internally slapped himself for thinking such an awful thought. Of course he trusted him, he hadn’t hurt him yet! Still, he wanted to have all the information before making a proper decision. And so, Draco made himself more comfortable in his chair and watched his dads with a firm gaze.
Draco then watched unblinkingly, mouth dry with horror, as he rearranged the letters to spell out something else.
After marvelling at the decor, which was odd but strangely welcoming, they sat themselves down on the sofa by the stove and watched as Luna poured some misty, steaming liquid into six cups.
“Sure.” The boy looked nervous, probably anticipated some kind of scolding, Sirius realised with a pang, so he quickly clarified and took a seat next to Harry on the sofa.
The entire class was transfixed on the struggle at play. Some didn’t even know what side they were on, but were enjoying it immensely. Aside from maybe the Slytherins, who would probably have preferred it if their classmate stopped getting points taken from them.
“Well, my dads say that there are four houses. Hufflepuff is for kind and honest people, Ravenclaw is for smart people, Gryffindor is for brave people, and Slytherin is for ambitious and cunning people.” Draco’s grin faltered a little. “Pads says that people in Slytherin are evil but Moony says that no house is fundamentally bad. I actually kind of want to be in Slytherin, but I haven’t told them.”
Harry passed him a gift box tied with a green, Slytherin ribbon. “If you don’t like it, you can return it. I only got it a few days ago because I didn’t know what to get you but then I had an idea but I can give it back if you don’t like it…” He carried on rambling but Draco wasn’t listening, instead focusing on the shiny, fiddly contraption in his hands.
“You’re not bleeding.” The boy tilted his head back as the dark haired boy looked closer. “You’re still not bleeding.”
Slowly, it started to tiptoe over to him. It really was a gruesome looking thing. Hair was missing in some places and it had a mouth like an ass.
“WHAT - ON MERLIN’S SAGGY TITS - WAS YOUR HEAD DOING PLUNGED IN A BOOK?”
“Yes… yes… thank you.” It was too much, it was all too much. Harry was gasping for air. It was as though somebody had been slowly crushing his lungs with an iron clamp and it had finally loosened. As though he could finally breathe real air again. Sirius had crushed him in another hug and Harry was unashamedly sobbing into his chest as he rubbed his back.
“I caught him with
“‘Night, Draco!”
To everybody’s surprise, Lockhart introduced a helper… Snape. It was shocking, but Harry felt almost comforted by the fact that Snape would most likely be taking the piss out of the other Professor. The two geared up for a demonstration, but it didn’t last long. Snape disarmed Lockhart within about two and a half seconds, leaving the man sprawled on the floor in an undignified heap. He passed it off as though he was allowing Snape to do that, simply for demonstration, but it was clear from the redness on his cheek, that the had not.
“Sneaking out to go to the library, he’s got some Moony in him after all.” Said Sirius through a mouthful of cereal.
Draco huffed and shook his head ruefully. “If that man knows even the slightest thing about the Chamber of Secrets, I will shave my head.”
he’s looking at us, but I so wish he wouldn’t.” Draco explained with a pained expression.
Sirius practically heaved at that. James took note and looked more panicked. “But she did! In the end! And Moony
“Probably because your nerves are deadened from being so stupid!” Harry sighed. He wasn’t going to win the argument.
“Well, if you didn’t want her to get suspicious, why didn’t you clean up after you’d done everything? Wash the blood off her hands? It seems like a pretty necessary precaution!” Draco breathed slightly before continuing. “And why did you choose her? A first year is understandable, but she’s a pureblood! With a lot of people looking out for her, why would you take that risk? What was your goal?”
The end of the Christmas holidays came too soon for Harry. The family atmosphere filled him with such a feeling of longing that it hurt just a little. But he could see better days on the horizon, especially now that he would be staying with the Lupin-Blacks over Easter and perhaps even over the Summer holidays. Still, it felt good to return to Hogwarts. It was the first place that had ever felt like home to him and would always hold a special place in his heart. The first night back, Harry and Draco huddled together on Draco’s bed and pored over Harry’s new book. He waved his wand over it, whispering the name Nicolas Flamel and black text bled onto the page. It wasn’t as much as their previous searches had provided them with (Jokey things like ‘Quidditch Fails’ and ‘Celestia Warbeck’), but it was still more than they had before. It told them, aside from useless information about his height and age, which was an astounding 653, that he was the only known maker of the Philosopher’s Stone. It did not say what the Philosopher’s Stone was, but it must be valuable.
“Light, Hermione, it doesn’t like light.” The girl cast a beam of blinding light that made the plant coil back and release everyone.
Remus glanced at him and looked reluctant. “Fine, give him another minute, but then you really have to go. Send a Patronus to Kingsley.”
Remus tried to put this out of his mind, however. Instead of stressing over anything, like he always did, he was going to let nature take it’s course. There was a prophecy once told about all of this. And nothing he did would prevent that from happening, so why should be bother?
“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know.” George reasoned. “We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it.”
“That is not an excuse!”
“Huh?” Harry spluttered worriedly.
It wasn’t that he was nervous to marry Moony - he wasn’t. He loved him with all his heart and it had taken YEARS of convincing to get the werewolf to finally realise that was true and that he wanted to marry him.
Harry nearly dropped his fork. “Oh my gosh! Is Draco okay?”
“I’m just so scared. What happens when Harry and Draco realise that they aren’t like the other kids? What happens when their magic becomes too powerful to control? How are we supposed to handle that?” Remus paused, mulling it over.
“I don’t think they liked me very much.” Harry nibbled his lip as Draco watched on, concerned.
Riddle smirked and surveyed him as though he were some complicated puzzle. “Fascinating. All that power and what do they do with it?” he chuckled. “Classic Dumbledore. You know what? I don’t think I will tell you, I think I’ll keep the satisfaction of knowing that Dumbledore failed. That if he had been honest with you from the beginning, you could have stood a fighting chance against me.”
“Yeah, I did. Look, don’t let it get to you, nobody likes a Slytherin. I bet they just didn’t expect you, of all people, to be one. You know, your parents were Gryffindors.”
“Of course it is.”
Quite a short chapter - sorry. I think the next one is longer. I just baked cookies so imagine I am handing one out to each of you! Thank you for keeping up with the story - I'm really proud of how it's turning out.
Sirius had always adored Remus’s eyes. They were a dark, honey colour, exactly like the kind you would find dripping out of a beehive, fresh and natural. When they were filled with tears, the colour was intensified. He hated to say it, but it was probably the most heart-breakingly beautiful thing he had ever seen, even when the tears were sad.
When they got to the classroom, they were told to leave their bags and follow him into the staff room, wands ready. Along the way, Remus had impressed everyone by putting Peeves in his place with a clever spell, and Draco had felt a surge of pride.
“Wonderful. Now, copy the following wand movement.” He demonstrated, they copied. “Amazing!” Remus cleared his throat for dramatic effect. “In order to cast the Patronus charm, the caster will need to think about their happiest memory. It can’t be just any happy memory, mind you, it must be one that fills you with so much joy, it overflows your boundaries and courses into the spell. Do you understand?”
Harry had almost forgotten his strange power regarding his own fire resistance. With every other strange thing that had happened, he almost didn’t care, speaking to snakes seemed like a bigger deal. However, one night when he was talking to Draco behind the drawn curtains of his Hogwarts bed, the blonde mentioned a moment at Christmas when he had received a snowball in the face from his father, only to find that it felt more like powdered sugar.
“It’s locked.”
So, over the Easter break, which he was forced to spend at Hogwarts, Harry spent night upon night in the restricted section, all to result in absolutely nothing new.
Harry was happy for him, and felt significantly lighter by the time that the first Quidditch match rolled around. Flint was pacing up and down the Slytherin table, ensuring that everyone ate a good breakfast, before they head out to the field, where he proceeded to regurgitate a speech that he had clearly written the night before. Once Adrien Pucey had finally cut him off, they strutted out onto the field. Harry had his eyes glued on the stands, where he could see Draco surrounded by their group, decked out in Slytherin green. He was breathtaking. The sight of him actually calmed Harry’s pounding heart, which felt like it was going to rip itself out of his chest.
“Yeah, and he said something about a man named Nicolas Flamel!” Ron nodded along as Harry gave Draco the play-by-play, still half afraid to speak to the boy unless spoken to.
“Fucking Dumbledore…”
“Professor, we’ve got some information for you, We think it’ll help you.” Harry piped up.
Sirius spat out his coffee. “A big, three-headed what?”
It was a regular day at Hogwarts when things started to change.
“Thank you.” He didn’t have time, however, to revel in Harry because his distraction caused him to sink closer to the rails. There was a rumbling behind them, which they soon determined to be the Hogwarts Express, hot on their heels.
“Yes…”
He was truly exhausted. It didn’t help that he spent the night in the Hospital Wing and had to wake up early in order to return to his dorm unsuspected. There was a moment when he returned where he felt sure that Sirius had seen him, but if he had he’d done a great job at pretending he hadn’t all day.
As they kissed, Sirius could feel the Earth’s curve beneath his feet. The dawning of a new hope settled in his chest like the coming of a fresh day, but an ominous tugging of apprehension toyed with his gut. He batted it away, however, and focused solely on his husband, and the little family he was growing for himself.
“What?” Hermione was watching them as though they were some puzzle pieces, that she only needed to slot together, whereas Draco was grinning and laughing at the state of them.
So I'm considering this their first kiss, I know they've kissed before but I thought this was too epic!!!
“YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT WAS TELLING ME A BEDTIME STORY, NO! IT WAS A MEMORY!”
“What’s he doing?” Draco shook his head in bewilderment.
“I’m sure he’d like to go too. I know Madame Maxine is an oddball, but she’s less of an oddball that Dumby. And I don’t think she’s a dangerous one.”
They rushed towards each other and hugged like their lives depended on it, squeezing the last of the air left in their lungs. It was good to know that Draco wasn’t alone, especially at a time like this. He bid his farewells and started the trek to his former headmaster’s office.
“Of course it's okay! You’re my best friend!” The pair embrace and Harry let out a wet sob before pulling himself together and laughing.
“Oh.” Lucius gasped, the faint ghost of a smile haunting his lips. “I see.” He licked his lips with a slimy tongue, Draco sneered. “I know exactly why you’re here. Draco, my son, you have more power than any of your ancestors, you have the blood of the greatest witches and wizards in the world running through your veins, don’t fight it. Let it consume you.”
I NEED HELP! I want to put Pansmione in this but I really don't know, please tell me what ships you want to see in this, I want you guys to enjoy it! I can't decide, Luna and Ginny, Pansy and Ginny, Pansy and Luna, Pansy and Hermione, Blaise and Ron, maybe even Crabbe and Goyle, or I might just do Romione, maybe some hetero couples for a change lol
“Okay, open it!” Harry tore the paper off to reveal a dark, wooden box with Golden Snitches painted on the side. He traced the engravings reverently and opened it, marvelling at the decorated interior. “This is a secrecy box. You can put anything in it but to the rest of the world it will look empty.” Harry gasped.
It made Remus sad that Dumbledore now had to make calls as to who would be going where. It made him feel sad that the boys were being treated like dangerous, cursed objects. Weapons. But, to Dumbledore, that was all they were.
Still, Remus seemed to be excited underneath all his concern, which was what mattered in the end. And, really, he was going to be incredible. The best Defense professor, probably, that Hogwarts would have seen in years.
“Yeah, I’m sure he will.” Sirius huffed sarcastically. Everyone ignored him.
“Sorry, we were just playing around and we fell.” Harry was quick with the lie, and it seemed to satisfy the man because he walked away, leaving them alone. They got to their feet and looked at each other in confusion.
I'm baaaack (at least for now)
“Then where is this research leading you?”
Thankfully, Hermione thought on her feet and levitated the beast’s paw for a few seconds before depositing it just adjacent to the door. She reached down and yanked it open, exposing a pitch black nothingness.
“Silly Perseus. What did he bring you?” Harry was good with names, Draco concluded, he had a wonderful memory and tried really hard to pronounce each one right. Draco had told him the name of his owl the night before when Harry had mentioned his trip to Diagon Alley with Hagrid, and Draco had explained that Perseus was a constellation, just like his own name was.
“No, not really. We probably would have known it was a snake without this sheet of paper, but this gives us a heads up.”
Draco knew about that.
“You seriously saw a giant three-headed dog in the castle?” He asked incredulously.
“Not from where I’m sitting.” said Luna.
“Do Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw have items too?” Harry asked.
“Before we get started, I would like to ask you some questions, Harry Potter.” Tom sauntered forward, eyeing Harry like prey, but never getting close enough to touch. “Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk, the longer you and your little friend will survive.”
“Why not?” probed Lucius, he seemed intent on figuring the boy out. “I still don’t understand why you’re here. You don’t want to give me any forgiveness or sympathy, you don’t want answers. Don’t you want to know why everyone is scared of you? Why nobody wanted to be your friend when you were little? You know, from what I hear, even Voldemort himself is afraid of you. So why don’t you want to know why?”
“Huh.” Draco huffed. “Boring. Let’s go.” But Harry felt strangely drawn to the book, and pocketed it anyway.
“I’m sorry we can’t tell you, I wish we could.” She reached under her desk and pulled out a tin, which she opened to reveal an array of shortbreads. “Biscuit?” Harry chose one that resembled a dog and nodded to her in thanks. “I wanted to talk to you today because we have to come up with a place for you to go for the first half of the Summer holidays. I must say that when I heard about Dumbledore keeping you with those awful people, I was outraged.” Harry’s eyes widened, he had never heard McGonagall angry at someone who wasn’t a student, to someone who was her boss not less. “It seems that you will be staying at Hogwarts for that period of time, unless we can find someone to take you in. I will be here too, to keep an eye on you.”
“You alright, Potter? Can you stand up?”
“Oh, Harry, bless you, but that’s fine, I just need to write this letter.” She carried on scribbling until she finally sealed it and looked up to see Harry still in the doorway. “Do you want to come with me to the Owlery so I can post this, Harry? Then we can go down to breakfast.”
“Let’s take you to the hospital wing, Potter.” said Flint, who hoisted him up with the help of Oliver Wood. It was quite nice, Harry thought through the haze of knowing that your arm could be eaten with a spoon, that the two teams had put aside their differences in favour of a joint hatred for Professor Lockhart. The bumbling man had fled the scene, for which Harry was grateful. He didn’t think that there were many people he disliked more than Gilderoy Lockhart.
The Minister averted his eyes to his lap and nodded. “That is definitely a possibility.” Remus didn’t quite know what to say. He could understand now why Sirius didn’t want to go to the meeting - he didn’t want to talk about the kiss.
At that moment, there came a knock on the door and Harry tentatively stepped in.
“Harry, let’s go, we shouldn’t be seen here.” Draco tugged on Harry’s arm persistently. “Harry, come on!” But he couldn’t move. His feet seemed glued to the ground. “Harry!” The other boy’s warning was fruitless, however, because Peeves was hovering above their heads, ready to blow.
Remus didn’t know what his son was thinking about, but it was clear he was focusing on it very hard, his lips were pursed and eyebrows furrowed. “
However, he has one particular memory - the one he uses for his Patronus, actually - of his face on their wedding day. It was stoic and calm to anyone who didn’t know where to look, but his lower lip trembled slightly and his cheeks were a painted with a faint blush, a butterfly blush, Sirius called it. But his eyes. They were wet and shiny with tears of utter joy and love and the colour was indescribable. It was as though whatever God was out there, every magical and non-magical creature, all of the characters from the stories he had read, all came together, put aside their differences, and infused this wonderful man’s eyes with the nectar of the Earth. It sounded dramatic, but there it was.
Nobody said anything for what seemed like a really long time, but was probably only a few seconds, before the ball rang and Remus dismissed everyone, including Harry, but keeping Draco behind and taking him to his office, where he fed him chocolate and biscuits until he felt better. Draco didn’t say anything, because there was no need to. There was nothing he could say that would make it any better for him, or make the worrying crease between Remus’s eyebrows smooth out. Whatever the hell that was, it probably wasn’t a fantasy. A fantasy is never that vivid.
He continued the journey to McGonagall’s office and rummaged in his bag for the diary, which was now suspiciously gone. His brow furrowed in concentration and did one final sweep of his beg before deciding that it was a lost cause, there wasn’t much he could do anyway.
Harry shrugged his shoulders and led Ron to the Chocolate Frogs display, where he bought a box full, as an early Christmas present for his best friend.
“Two rolls of parchment by Monday morning on werewolves with particular emphasis on recognising it.” The class groaned.
“Like you could be a trusted employee.”
“Draco, keep your voice down.” Pansy said, glancing at Moody, who had now turned completely around and was staring at the group head on.
Bye bye xxx
“You’re human, Draco, nobody deserves that kind of treatment.” Draco smiled at her, she really did seem to know it all.
“Two.”
“Are you going to make that pun every time we run into a dead end?”
“Why would I be excited?” Harry shrugged. “Valentines holds nothing to Christmas.”
Remus chuckled, wetly.
“So, Rem, has this ever crossed your mind?” James started with an entrepreneurial double handed gesture that appeared to unfold the inner workings of his plan, which turned out to be something to do with a kind of spell that splattered paint on your chest so that he and Sirius could duel without either of them taking damage.
“Just the man,” Snape stepped forward and Harry stifled a giggle at the pure rancour the greasy man was displaying for his fellow ‘Professor’. “The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.”
“I love you too.”
“Thank you, Professor.” They both smiled warmly. He felt infinitely better knowing that he would be under McGonagall’s wing, he trusted her over any other teacher.
He was breathtaking. His golden hair lay in a curly bush on top of his head, because Sirius had refused to let him style it for the wedding, and he was wearing a perfectly fitted muggle tux, mainly because Sirius had wanted to piss off his parents even more than he already was by marrying a male werewolf. But, the most breathtaking thing of all, were his deep, honey eyes that shone like stars, so brightly that he could see them from the other side of the hall. Either side of him, were his parents, who looked proud and happy, which was a nice change, and behind him was Lily, wearing a stunning red dress that complimented her hair perfectly, holding a bouquet and grinning even wider than her husband. Even seven months pregnant, Lily looked as young as the day they first met.
“Not the greatest sorcerer in the world. If you were, you wouldn’t have been killed by a baby.” Draco was astonished at his friend, for saying such things to Voldemort himself. Of course, he had been a little snarky to the man before, but he didn’t know who he was dealing with then. “And anyway, even though he has made some questionable decisions, Albus Dumbledore is still a more powerful wizard than you. Even when you were at your peak, you didn’t try to take over Hogwarts, because you knew that you’d fail.”
“It’s probably just something important of Dumbledore’s. One of those crazy things he keeps in his office. Don’t go looking for trouble, Harry, you won’t find anything good.” But Harry was adamant, whatever was in that package was important and he needed to know what it was. Regardless, Harry didn’t want to make Draco upset, seeing as he was the only genuine friend he had, so he dropped the issue. That is until a few weeks into term, when Draco insisted they go back to the library to search for more information on werewolves. His reasoning was that all of the good books were kept in the restricted section, which they could only go into at night, when no one would find them. But Harry was unsure. The older students had told them horror stories of being found by Filch and his gammy cat Mrs Norris, and he didn’t want to risk detention, not so early in his Wizarding career. Still, Draco was nervous, scared for his father’s safety, he used research to stay grounded, and Harry could understand coping mechanisms better than most. So, the two boys snuck out of the Slytherin common room, made their way up plights of stairs, and finally got to the library. But just as they were about to cross over the threshold, an uneven set of footsteps could be heard from around the corner.
How are you guys liking it so far? We're nearing the end!! ♡☆
on SIrius’s wand, that he did not cast the spell… I am ashamed to say that, even as his husband, I had my doubts on the subject.”
“I’d miss you too.” Their special moment was interrupted by a polite cough from Dumbledore, who was standing in the corner, on the wrong end of twin glares from Sirius and Remus.
Harry felt like a clamp was closing around his neck, but Draco paid him no attention. His eyes were seemingly glued to McGonagall, but Harry could see that they were actually glazed over and glassy.
“Draco,” Lucius leered. “Why are you here? Come to get to know your daddy?”
“Astute.” quipped Draco, before realising what he had just done, but the memory didn’t seem to have heard him, or didn’t seem to care, as he was gazing down at the heap of clothes in bemusement.
Thanks for all the comments recently!! Also can I just apologise, I feel like Draco is smarter than Ron, no offence to Ron, I love him, but I feel like he would spot some of the obvious things about the chamber quicker? If that makes sense? My point is, they find it in a slightly different way to how they do in canon, I didn't want to force all of the scenes that happened in the book to happen in this because it felt unnatural (???). Sorry, I'm super new at this whole fan fiction thing, but I'm having a lot of fun with it!
“That you did. I remember how painful you thought it was.”
“And what about the Boy Who Lived, huh?”
He tilted his head up to look at Dumbledore, checking if that was true, who then gave a look to Snape, who nodded and  left the room in a dramatic flurry of robes. Returning to the conversation, Moony continued. “A lycanthropist is a person who can shapeshift into a werewolf, be it voluntarily or involuntarily. I don't know how anybody found out. We both wanted to wait and tell you when you were a little older, but somebody must have told the papers. However, it seems that the general opinion is, that you were put into our custody because we would know how to deal with you. But, darling, you aren’t a werewolf! That is all speculation! I don’t know how it managed to make its way onto the front page, especially when there are more important things happening right now, but Dumbledore is issuing a public statement later today. Hopefully, that will be enough.”
So they did.
“Okay.” he answered in a trembling voice.
Remus cut in. “Look, Professor, we just want what’s best for Harry and Draco. If keeping them apart is what’s best, why don’t you keep Harry at Hogwarts for the Summer?”
“Alright.” Draco gave Harry a quick smile and ran through the wall, grinning with poorly contained excitement.
“I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I’ve read all about them.” Harry’s jaw dropped. He had never seen straight-laced Hermione lie to a teacher. He had once seen her remind Professor Flitwick that he was supposed to give them homework. “If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Draco knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.” Harry and Draco glanced at the teachers to gage their reactions, but Harry’s eyes were caught on whatever Snape was trying to cover with his cloak. It looked like a rip in his trousers that revealed a gaping wound. Harry suppressed a gasp.
“I will never be like you.” Draco screamed, throat raw from holding back tears, which now flooded free. “Ever.”
and his work on alchemy with his partner Nicolas. Flamel.” He finished with a flourish and placed the card face up on the table. Ron stared at it for a while and then looked up.
“Maybe more so when they find out that your son just saved the whole school because you taught him how!”
I've just finished the Philosopher's Stone and I've started on the Chamber of Secrets! BIG HUGS ♡ I'm very excited about all of this!!
Now Harry was standing up and behind Draco. “Against you? Tom, we didn’t come to fight!”
. The general idea was, now that he was in Slytherin and best friends with Draco Malfoy, he was sure to become a Dark Wizard in the future, powerful enough to outdo Voldemort. Because of this, Harry and Draco were mostly left to themselves, except for a dedicated group of fellow Slytherin First Years who had made it their mission to befriend them. Draco had, at first, been irritated at the attention, knowing that it came from a place of lies, but after a scary encounter with some older Gryffindors, decided that it would be better to travel in a pack. Safety in numbers and whatever. Harry didn’t mind a bit. Fake friends were better than no friends at all, he concluded. And besides, he had a real friend: Draco.
“I suppose we have to catch one.” Draco shrugged and walked towards the broomsticks that were leaning towards the wall. “What kind are we looking for?”
“I don’t know.” He immediately felt sick. “We should get out of here.” But, before they could, a crowd of people gathered around them and gasped at the message. Argus Filch shoved through the crowd and started screaming about them murdering his cat, fellow Slytherins yelled profanities, and Dumbledore simply stood there in thought, gazing at the wall. He came to his senses soon enough, though, and carefully detached the cat from it’s hanging.
He still wouldn’t give Snape the satisfaction.
“My mum would kill me.” He trembled.
“Yeah, you’ve made promises before.”
“That, Moony, is something you’ll have to find out on your own.”
“I don’t really know anything about houses.” Draco’s eyebrows knitted.
“Oh, Harry, there you are.” she said, darting around her office. It had become routine for Harry to come and fetch her every morning for breakfast before he went down so he wouldn’t have to eat alone.
“What was it?”
“What constellation actually is that, Sirius?” Remus asked on the long walk back to the castle.
I really appreciate all of the comments and kudos by the way, we had a lovely amount last week and it made me smile seeing how much people were enjoying my work! Thank you if you ever take the time to write a comment or leave a kudos - it makes me smile and lets me know whats working in this series and what isn't <3<3
The conversation was just as mysterious as their other one in front of the mirror, the other man even avoided mentioning Draco at all, just like before. He explained ‘the power of love’ and what Nicolas Flamel would do now, thankfully they were destroying the stone, as he thought they definitely should. Harry still had a few questions, though, and wasn’t hopeful that they would be answered without a stupid riddle he needed to crack.
“What’s the time?”
I hope you enjoy, and I forgot to say that I hope this is proving a good enough quarantine distraction as it is for me haha <3
“I just don’t understand why you brought snacks, Pete.” sighed James in exasperation.
Quidditch tryouts were approaching and Draco seemed to be very excited. As did Harry, who knew how talented Draco was at flying and wanted him to be on the team. So he practised with him whenever they could, which wasn’t often, but he didn’t really need much training. When the actual day came around, it was clear that Draco would be the best Slytherin had to offer.
This seemed a new concept for Pansy, who was now staring at the floor with a vacant expression. It didn’t seem like she wanted to continue the conversation so Harry went back to his Herbology homework.
“DUMBY!” Remus could no longer see his husband’s head as it was crammed so far into the fireplace, he wondered if it would be difficult to get it out. “You had better come here right now or I swear to Merlin’s saggy balls that I will come through this Floo and trash your office!”
Harry spent every night for the following two weeks gazing into the mirror. He was exhausted the next day but at least he was happy. Draco continued to tell him that the mirror was some dark piece of magic and that he shouldn’t put so much faith in it, but he didn’t care. He had absolutely no idea what the mirror did, that is until Dumbledore found him.
“Do you mind telling me what you’re thinking about?” Remus had asked during one of their chocolate breaks.
“FIFTY POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN NOW ARE YOU QUITE FINISHED, MR MALFOY?” Snape roared. Draco snapped his mouth shut and glared at him.
“Miss Granger!”
“Yeah.” said Draco breathlessly. “Just… a lot of emotion, y’know?” Draco reached for Harry’s hand and weaved their fingers together. “It hasn’t been that bad since the Quidditch match, usually I can calm it down.”
Harry did, he poured himself a steaming cup of tea and selected a dog shaped shortbread biscuit. Draco, however, wasn’t paying attention, he was still seething from the encounter and needed some form of release. The ice beneath his skin was bursting for it.
“He’s probably at the welcome feast, you know how those things drag on.” he sighed wearily. He was no stranger to Sirius’s fits of rage, but honestly he just wanted to go to bed and Floo Dumbledore in the morning. Surely there was some reasonable explanation for this.
?” Draco sneered incredulously. Honestly, that was hardly the most shocking part of Harry and Ron’s story. But Draco was rather angry that they were still pursuing this mystery anyway.
“Madame Hooch!” said one of the Weasley twins, Harry thought it was Fred. “This bludger keeps going after Harry, I think someone’s messed with it!” She came over and inspected the other twin, George, he assumed, who was desperately wrestling with the ball that seemed intent on flying after Harry.
“Still, surely that is a very dangerous thing if it got into the wrong hands.”
“Why am I getting stuck with the bags?” Sirius pouted.
"You sleep with a teddy bear?"
“You say it just enough, I think. I love you too.” Sirius turned himself so that he was lying on his side, and Draco mirrored him, invested in the seriousness of the discussion.
Sirius visibly shuddered. “Why would we go to Azkaban, little star?”
To Harry’s surprise, black ink began dancing about the parchment, forming words.
“Are you okay, Professor?” he asked, noticing how she had retrieved a quill and some parchment from her shelves and was hastily penning a letter. “Would you like me to go and get you some coffee?”
Harry hesitated before he answered, knowing that his suggestion was a crazy one. “Do you know how to ride your dad’s motorbike?”
Aside from these new additions of Harry Potter’s life, he still made time to speculate over suspicious information that found itself on his path. When Draco had first passed him the copy of the Daily Prophet that fateful morning, he instead focused his attention to the headline that day about a break-in at Gringotts, in the same that he had seen Hagrid get a package from. It seemed suspicious to him, and his ever unquenchable curiosity had him devoured. He expressed his concerns to Draco who had merely said,
“Holy…” Harry trailed off, he could see Hermione in a tight ball underneath the sinks as the troll was advancing on her. “Confuse it.” Draco kicked into action and picked up the plywood that was just thrown at them and a piece of metal plumbing and waved them around, hitting them into stuff and yelling.
Sorry for leaving to waiting! How is everyone?
“I suppose that’s why it's in Hogwarts, isn’t this the safest place on Earth?”
“Okay, I’ll get back to my seat, stay safe!” He started jogging away.
Peter giggled and hid his smiling face behind chubby hands.
“Dobby?” He looked awful, bless him, arms wrapped in bandages, tears filling those tennis-ball eyes but never falling.
Sirius looked imploringly into his husband’s eyes. “I wish they had more.”
“Always.”
“Back in Binn’s class - saw you were sleeping, Rem, don’t blame you. That was definitely one of his more boring classes.” Sirius panted, grinning like a loon.
Draco felt as though someone was holding a blinding light up to his eye and yanking his hair, pressing him for answers. His throat closed up but he still managed to keep the tears at bay.
“A few weeks after we spoke. He was worried about you, said you were doing excessive research or something.” Draco looked down at his palms.
Big thanks to my sister, we sort of did a chapter swap today. I wrote her Klaine chapter for the thing that she's writing and she wrote this one (most of it, anyway)
After the game, they had a big picnic, with food made by Molly and the House Elves, and a giant cake, with so many candles that Harry managed to blow them all out only after five tries.
There was an incident a few hours later which involved Harry being accosted by a dwarf of his own singing some song about his eyes being as green as a fresh pickled toad but he brushed it off in favour of Draco, who had given him a quick peck on the lips before he raced off to Quidditch practise.
“What’s that?”
“You cannot possibly think he’s a werewolf.”
“What about Draco?” But the old man shook his head and continued as if Harry hadn’t said anything.
“Firs’ years, firs’ years! Over ‘ere!” Harry spotted a large, familiar face looming above the children and ran to it, pulling Draco along.
“Did you feel that?” Harry was watching Draco, fearfully.
“Well it's not much, is it?” Draco shot him a glare which made him shrink up in his seat.
Draco pulled back. "Why won't you?" he replied, half-joking.
“We can’t keep the boys in such close conditions without supervision from one of our experts.”
“Keep your voice down, yes, Draco and I saw it. It looked like it was guarding something.” Ron had a gleam in his eye.
The only notable things to really happen in the weeks following Christmas were the extra defensive classes Harry and Draco were taking with Remus and the unfortunate death of Ron’s rat, which Ron himself blamed solely on Hermione and her ugly cat.
Harry and Draco stiffened and Ron huffed incredulously. “I’m sorry, a spirit?” Like the general public, Ron was aware of the prophecy. It was made public knowledge by the Ministry of Magic when Grindelwald, a famous child of Ice, lost control of his powers and ended up killing a lot of his own followers and was deemed more dangerous than ever. But the concepts of Fire and Ice were always interpreted as personifications of the powers, rather than actual spirits who could possess people. However, some people interpreted it differently.
“It’s good practise, actually.” he said. “How many players know each position equally well? Next year, when Montague leaves, I’ll have a really good shot at Chaser!”
Harry seemed to mull this over before nodding just slightly.
Draco snorted. “I definitely do.”
There wasn’t a dry eye in the house, and Sirius regretted deciding not to bring a handkerchief because the tears were trickling down his cheeks. He felt, however, the pad of Remus’s thumb wipe them away. He met eyes with his soon-to-be husband and felt such a wave of emotion that he had never felt before. Could it be - hope? Just like James was talking about?
“Well, now what are we going to do?”
The Aurors were moving out the door, keeping a death-like grip on Peter, when he seemed to shrink. Slowly, slowly, he began to shrink, and grow fur, and his nose elongated until he was in his rat form. She felt her body slump in exhaustion. What were they going to do now?
“The Wronski Feint!” Sirius exclaimed. “Amazing!”
“I blame Dumbledore for all of this. Sure it’s all well and good to place the dog there for protection, but it won’t do much if it has that big of a fatal flaw? Or if the knowledge of that flaw is thrown about willy nilly!” Harry acquiesced. Draco was right, but that wasn’t what they should be worrying about. Snape could be getting the stone, and they needed to stop him.
thank you to anyone still reading, it really means a lot to me that you still care about this silly little story, which i do still fully intend to finish, i’m really proud of the final ending i came up with so i do really want to get there and write it
run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put that admirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?” Harry stood up to leave but paused to ask Dumbledore what he saw in the Mirror. The older man lied, Harry could tell by the way a dark cloud crossed over his features as he stared into Harry’s soul. But, Harry had thought, it wasn’t his place to pry.
“We don’t need to rehash what powers he has, we know them.” Sirius rubbed his temple. “So, does this mean that he’s the Heir of Slytherin?”
“You knew them?”
He’d always preferred the Hogs Head to the Three Broomsticks. Something about the personality of it made him feel warm, like he was a part of another imperfectly perfect family. At this rate, he would have more families than most, which was something he graciously welcomed.
They had both gotten each other books.
(See the end of the chapter for
it's been a while, i know, i'm sorry
After dinner in the Great Hall, Draco had insisted that they go to the library. He had wanted to check up on some facts that he had read in the Prophet that morning on whether werewolves could procreate, and how it would effect their offspring, when Harry heard a strange whispering.
“I don’t know, I haven’t really gotten Christmas presents before.” Draco’s eyes widened.
Are any of you online schooling or working from home? If so, I empathise, we'll get through this together with a lot fo fanfiction.
Draco slipped on his father’s helmet before realising that it was ten sizes too big for him. He then surveyed the controls that he had to work with. Sirius had taught Draco to ride it when he was nine, just basic controls and he would only let him fly as high as two meters. He also didn’t know where Hogwarts was, geographically. He was aware that it was in Scotland, and he was aware of where Scotland was, but he didn’t know how in hell he was supposed to get there. “I think we’ve had enough adventures.”
“Ugly little thing. The ginger one probably just realised that he could do better.” Draco shot her a quelling look. Harry noticed that Draco was rather fond of Hermione. It made sense, they were the top of the class and both loved reading. But their friendship made Harry uncomfortable for some reason, as though Hermione was taking something that was his. But Harry’s train of thought was intercepted by the doors of the Great Hall slamming open to reveal a distressed looking Professor Quirrell, barreling down the middle aisle, screaming.
I'm sorry if this chapter is a little patchy. I'm doing my best :)
“Er - well - it’s not terribly…” He started, but Draco cut him off.
Draco finished his chocolate and tried to get back to sleep, but it would not come, so they stayed up until the morning, drinking hot chocolate, and playing Exploding Snap and Wizard’s Chess. Everything seemed far behind them until the Daily Prophet was chucked through their window by Perseus, along with an urgent letter.
“I’ve got a musical message to deliver to Draco Malfoy in person.” he grunted. Draco’s eyes lit up.
“Yes, Mr Potter?”
“Oh, Harry! I thought that you were dead!” Harry petted Draco’s back.
The boy took a deep breath as he came up with his happy memory. When he did, he cast the spell and produced a similarly bright beam.
Sirius grinned in that mischievous way he often did when he was trying to persuade someone to do something. “Of course you can, Harry. You’re family.” That was enough to make the tears fall in buckets. He accepted the big group hug when it was offered and nuzzled his face into Remus’s jumper, and then Draco’s hair.
“Harry!” They ran towards each other and embraced in a tight bear hug. “Oh, I missed you, kid. And so did Draco, we’ve been worried sick!”
“What… what is it?” But Draco shook his head and wiped his eyes hastily, pulling himself together.
“Twenty points from Slytherin.”
“Harry?”
“You can’t blame them, sweetheart.”
Overcome with curiosity, even if his rational head knew that the classroom would be nothing more than that, a classroom, he pushed open the door and stepped inside, shutting it behind him and draping the cloak over his arm. The room was barren except for the furniture that was propped up against the walls and the large, ornate mirror, standing tall in the centre. It was magnificent. Harry traced it’s contours with wonder. Along the top was an inscription: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. It must be Latin, Harry thought. Resting his eyes finally on his own reflection, Harry started. There were people behind him. He turned, finding that he was as alone in the room as he was before. But the mirror still reflected the faces of strange people, all familiar. On his left, Harry saw the faces of Sirius, Remus and Draco grinning at him. On his right, his mother and father, serene and peaceful. Harry felt tears prickle his eyes and that sense of longing that he had felt all over the holiday tripled into a dull ache that seemed to carve a hole in his chest. Merlin, how he longed for a family. When he looked closer, he saw generations of Potters, stretching out for miles behind James and Lily. He wanted, so desperately, to switch places with Mirror Harry, if only for a second. But if he stayed in there for a second, he wasn’t sure if he’d be able to bring himself out again.
Uncle Vernon is a homophobe but I think we all sort of knew that. Please comment if you see any spelling mistakes!!
“Sirius…” Draco could hear his father’s bickering coming from the fireplace, edging close, and leaped into their warm embrace.
As the man retrieved the drinks, Sirius noticed a heavily tattooed witch in the corner of the room, hunched over a rather large wizard’s arm. It looked as though she herself was giving him a tattoo. Sirius was suddenly intrigued. He had always wanted a tattoo. Another form of rebellion he could rub in his mother’s face during the brief moments they saw each other, at Kings Cross station or in Diagon, although he didn’t quite know what he would get one of.
you, you’ve got nothing to worry about there.”
Draco took a moment to think about it. “...Yeah. I think I am.”
- Secondly, I have cake downstairs, it's not homemade it's that colin the caterpillar cake from m&s but it's really good so if you want a slice tell me a quick story about what you'd do if you were at Hogwarts - even if you're just telling me what your favourite subject would be or what pet you'd have. I wanna hear your stories and I'll give you a metaphorical slice of cake if you do.
“What?”
“See you later.” he breathed, smiling serenely. If it weren’t for the lyrics, Harry would have been sure that Draco was the one who wrote the song, but he never seriously thought of Harry as a hero, more of an idiot who got himself into too much trouble, and Draco compared his eyes to emeralds rather than toads, anyway.
“Alright.” Sirius growled. “What do we do with him now?”
“Did you have fun with
“So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?” Draco also seemed to have come to his senses and was now giving Harry a look that could easily be interpreted as ‘Oh my God what a fucking idiot’, Harry didn’t usually swear, even in his subconscious, but it seemed appropriate in the moment.
“Yes.”
“Ready.”
Sirius slowed his breaths down enough to speak semi-normally. “Prongs, how did you deal with this?”
“I think it's wonderful, Draco.” Ron’s eyes darted between the two other boys with scrutiny before clearing his throat and standing up.
Draco’s face was livid all the same, and Harry was sure that he would run off and tell his parents, which wasn’t a bad thing. He trusted Remus and Sirius as though they were his flesh and blood, but he wanted to tell them himself, which was what he told Draco, and the boy seemed to listen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Snape smirked. “Likely story.” His attention turned back to the map and, in his distraction, Harry quickly ducked down to get the cloak and shove it hastily in his pocket - Snape apparently hadn’t seen it.
“Could he get the kiss?”
“What happened to you thinking this was incredible?”
“Thanks, Draco. You’re amazing.” The blond blushed lightly as Harry’s words.
“Do you have a better suggestion?”
I may need to start uploading a little less regularly, I don't know, it depends on the next few weeks really.
She seemed to consider this for a while. Harry had started picking up on habits his Professor had, things that he had internally dubbed ‘McGonagallisms’ (he also had ‘Dracoisms’ as another folder in his brain), one of them was a squint in her right eye whenever she was thinking about something really hard, and a flicker in her left eye whenever she was tired. She sighed and lay down her cutlery. “Okay but we’re going to get some Aurors to supervise you, Lucius will probably want to see his son first.”
As he walked down the aisle, Sirius couldn’t see what he was so worried about in the first place. While Moony hadn’t arrived yet, there were other things in the room he could use as anchors. McGonagall’s stead weight on the crook of his elbow, guiding him down the path, the two empty seats on his side of the room in the front row, reserved for Euphemia and Fleamont Potter, who he missed sorely, and James grinning at him like a loon and bouncing on the balls of his feet.
“Was my father a good man?”
Draco rose in his seat. “My dad will be back by then, are you really going to make him read forty essays on how dangerous of a creature he is? Are you really that cruel?”
“And why not?”
Draco could hear Harry making small sniffling sounds and held him closer.
Next on my list of random questions to ask you because reading your responses is fun...
“I’m sorry. I know it won’t help but it makes me feel calmer. It makes me feel like I understand it a little better.”
“I hope you do.” With that, Remus and Sirius left, hoping beyond hope that Dumbledore was right.
“You’re dead, Harry Potter. Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.” Draco knew about Phoenixes from Moony, who kept up to date with most magical creatures. They also visited the Scamanders once, which was an eventful experience. But he was shocked, overall, that Tom Riddle, or Voldemort himself, didn’t know about the Phoenix Tears. Harry clearly didn’t either because he looked as though he was writing his will in his head. But Draco daren’t say anything now, for fear that Riddle would overhear. He was still rambling on about his defeat of the Boy Who Lived, when Draco noticed something by the Phoenix’s feet - the diary.
“AGAIN WITH THE CHAMBER! IT’S AS IF LIFE HASN’T GIVEN YOU ENOUGH WAYS TO DIE YET!”
“What are you doing? Get - off - me!” Harry struggled out between breaths, kicking his legs frantically and trying to pull himself from the twins grip. They didn’t reply, and before Harry knew it, the solid oak door to a broom cupboard was flung open, and he was being tossed inside. He put his hands out to stop his fall, and scrambled to his feet frantically, looking at the twins with a mix of anger and curiosity. Fred pulled the door shut, and turned to Harry, beaming.
“Aha!” Harry exclaimed, bending down to scoop it up, but the thing ran away and out of his sight, and before he could chase after it, a menacing hand clasped itself around his shoulder. The cloak had fallen off.
I know it's been a while, and I'm sorry. It's been kind of an awful week, but I only have one left before half-term and I'll be writing a lot more then. How have you guys been? Also, question of the chapter, what are some of your favourite Drarry fics? I've been running low recently and could use some recommendations <3
“Thanks for the advice Hagrid but I’ll be fine.” Hagrid looked resigned and muttered something along the lines of ‘Dumbledore better…’ But Harry didn’t stick around to find out what ‘Dumbledore’ had better do, frankly he was tired of hearing the man's name, and joined Draco back on the platform. Draco gave him a questioning look that he responded to with what he hoped was a reassuring smile. He idly wondered what everyone was worried about, Remus and Sirius seemed to be lovely people, and Draco had been nothing but kind to him.
As he ate, Draco responded. “Azkaban.”
“It’s just the selected tales, not all of them.” Harry clarified, sounding sheepish.
“Sorry.”
“What do you need, Minerva?” he asked.
Harry breathed. He always felt just a little bit calmer whenever Draco was near him. “Yeah, I’m fine. I was just looking at your pictures.” All of a sudden, Harry knew what he was getting Draco for Christmas.
Harry smiled a little. “Fine. Take it.”
“I can’t believe you trashed Filch’s office!” Sirius smiled, he remembered that.
The ‘harsh judgement of day’ however, came sooner than expected. He was having a lovely dream about chocolate and brand new parchment, only being occasionally accosted by the image of a mangled animal carcass or the full moon, when some hushed whispers snaked into his subconscious and he simply had to crack open an eye to see what all the fuss was about. To his immense shock, it was the upper halves of three Gryffindors, lurking at the end of his bed, shushing each other.
“But your dad-”
“Here comes the tricky part, due to-” he coughed. “circumstances, you cannot stay with us on every holiday-” Sirius interrupted.
“Oh no.” Remus had just received a note from Draco. “Pads!” he yelled, the man (or dog, rather) was out in the garden jumping over fences. “PADS!” the dog turned around. “Come in!”
Just wanted to say, the next two chapters (after this one) are going to be over the Christmas holidays, I wanted to spend some time developing the relationships between Sirius, Remus, Harry and Draco.
“Alright then, no need to get huffy with me!” he squawked before drinking the tea to its completion and staring down at the dregs. “It looks like mush, what does that mean?”
“As I’ll ever be.”
I can't come up with a creative question today, so if you want you could ask me a question and I'll ask you guys a question and we can get a convo going... but I also do get it if you're tired and you don't want too... aren't we all.
Remus groaned slightly and sat down, spreading the chocolate out on the table for everyone to enjoy. Draco immediately snatched up a large chunk.
When Draco had stopped seething, they loosened their grip and just held onto his forearms firmly. They were escorting him to McGonagall’s office, it seemed, and when they finally sat him down on her office settee, McGonagall looked as though she’d aged about ten more years.
“Well, it sounds quite scary, but all you need to do is walk straight at the bit of the wall. Actually, it’s best to do it at a bit of a run. Sirius, why don’t you demonstrate?” Sirius took a moment to pull himself together, and ran his hands through Draco’s hair a few times while taking deep, calming breaths to do it.
He didn’t know quite what he was doing, only that he should. He hated that book with every fibre of it’s being and it deserved what was coming for it. Draco reached for the fang that he had just tossed aside with one hand, and the book with the other. Harry’s wound was almost cleared, and Riddle seemed completely unaware.
“It’s getting worse.”
“No matter how much we want you to.” His voice was low and dangerous, it was clear that he wasn’t okay with Harry being out of his sight.
“Harry, I want to tell you this before the owls arrive with the morning post,” she began. Harry started to really worry, had something happened to one of the Lupin-Blacks? To Draco? But before he could continue to fall down this spiral, she continued. “Lucius Malfoy, Draco’s father, has escaped from Azkaban.”
“‘Ello ‘Arry, Ron! ‘Ow are things?” Hagrid was avoiding eye contact with Harry, instead looking anywhere but.
The family collectively replaced talking with eating and devoured the treat in silence. Nobody knew what to say. There was nothing that any of them could say about James and Lily. Nothing that any of them could say about the boggart. All they could do was just spoon mouthful after mouthful of sticky pastry in their mouths, hoping that once they were finished, they still wouldn’t be expected to speak.
“What does?”
Harry quickly sealed the map with a few whispered words and turned to face Snape. “Professor.” he greeted.
“Your father already knows.”
Draco slammed his fist against the barrier, causing a shock wave to ripple through it. He retracted his arm and stared in horror at what he had done. Lucius Malfoy had a genuine smile on his face, although it was tainted by the manic gleam in his eyes.
So Harry rushed Draco to the forest and they entered through the back. The second they were far enough in that the sun was weak through the trees, Draco pretty much exploded.
“What is the latest regarding the public’s support of my position here?” Remus asked openly, he wanted to know whether he would be forced to watch over his son from a distance again.
He asked everyone to split off into pairs, so Harry and Draco moved away to a discreet corner of the room.
It all started when Snape woke up in the morning and decided that he could stir the cauldron a little and jump ahead on the syllabus to werewolves. Most students could only guess what his intention was: to make them scared enough of Professor Lupin-Black to get him fired so that Snape could fill in. But they weren’t that stupid. To start with, nobody liked Snape, but also, Lupin-Black was the most competent teacher they had ever had for defense, and not even changing into a hideous and potentially dangerous beast once a month would take away from that. Every girl in the school did that, and nobody stayed away from them.
“Do you think there’s been another attack?” asked Draco worriedly.
“Better now that he’s not living with those disgusting people you put him with, Dumbledore.” Sirius growled, glaring daggers at the man.
It wasn’t the first full moon that had happened at Hogwarts, but it was the first that fell on an actual weekday, so Professor Lupin-Black’s defense class had a substitute teacher, Professor Snape.
happy father’s day btw 🥰❤️❤️🔥🥺
Dumbledore summoned a glowing, misty orb and let it hover just in front of Draco and Harry’s illuminated faces. They were in awe. They could not look away and were unable to speak.
“Yes, Harry, that probably is what it was, now can we please just go to sleep now?” Harry sighed. “Fine. How about I write to my dads tomorrow, I’ll tell them that old Dumby is keeping a three headed dog as a pet, they’ll ask Dumbledore why, we’ll get an answer.”
“What, why?” It was so frustrating, how everyone seemed to be afraid of Draco. He was an eleven-year-old boy. What could he possibly do?
“Doing what?”
“Myrtle can I ask you a question of a personal nature?” he began, suddenly in stone-cold professional detective mode.
“We?”
There came a knock at the door.
The first Quidditch match of the season was coming up, Slytherin vs. Gryffindor, and Harry couldn’t be more excited. Practise was gruelling, Flint was working everyone really hard, which was a good distraction for Harry. His social life was ridiculous. He finally truly understood how Draco feels every day, everyone watching you with fear in their eyes or trembling awe. Barely anyone ever looking at you as more than a reputation, nobody bothering or being brave enough to try to learn about the real person behind it. Harry could never quite understand why Draco was so glad to have his friendship, but now he could. Real friends are rarer than anything. Which was why he was still feeling extremely guilty about Quidditch.
They shared a long look and Sirius nodded. Remus knew better than anyone what it felt like to be different from your peers, to have a magical weight on your shoulders. He couldn’t do it to his son, or James and Lily’s for that matter.
Snape banished the snake, and the club was dismissed. Harry had no idea what had just happened, but he wasn’t too pleased about it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sneered and continued to walk away but Harry pursued him, and now Draco could feel someone watching them. “Moody.” he sighed and turned to find the Professor behind a nearby tree. “Is there a reason you’ve been watching me?” Draco called out to him.
In about ten minutes, Draco was given a small stash of bread from the house elves and strict instructions to wait quietly for the rat to come out and get it.
PS. I know it’s kinda boring at this point, sorry! I have exciting things planned for the final part of PoA and I’m in the midst of writing it and the GoF should be pretty busy so just hang in there lol
“And how’s Draco? Did he get his birthday present?”
“-Hagrid-”
They gave each other a quick peck before Remus departed and Sirius sent his Patronus to Kingsley, informing him of the suspicious behaviour.
While for the rest of Hogwarts, Hogsmeade trips were a joy, to Harry, on the anniversary of his parent’s deaths, and to Draco, a boy who was still haunted by the faces of his loved ones killed at his hand, it seemed like it was more of an inconvenience, but it did give them the opportunity to seek comfort in two men who knew what their pain was, and would do everything in their power to make them feel better.
“Well. I suppose I’ll go first. Then Harry and Ron, then Draco you can go, okay?” Everyone nodded and Hermione took a deep breath before plunging down. The boys heard a faint
I could get heated about this, I digress.
Kingsley and his team showed up and began to take Peter away when the real feeling of dread began to creep up Minerva’s spine. For, you see, she had assumed that the Aurors knew what to do about Peter’s animagus form, and had planned accordingly. Remus had said that they were aware of it, so she couldn’t quite account for what happened.
“Harry.” he breathed.
“Today has been quite a day.” It truly had.
“I’m guessing that you have been using the diary brainwash people?” Draco suggested, getting slightly sidetracked by the puzzle of it all. “Ginny found it so she wrote in it, and you showed her memories, is that right?”
“Professor, I don’t understand, why didn’t you tell us? We had a deal!” demanded Remus, slamming his hands on the desk.
“I can’t wait for this to happen to me.” said Harry sarcastically.
“Okay besides Fluffy.” Harry conceded. “But we’re not gonna do anything.”
That night, Harry searched for the Chamber of Secrets with his special book, but nothing showed up, only a warning that he shouldn’t be asking. That was an annoying thing it tended to do when he looked for something too dangerous or stupid, it would give him a sassy comment or two, probably for his own good. But from that week on, it was now common knowledge that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were working together to rid the school of Muggleborns, through the use of Slytherin’s Monster.
“It was strange, it felt tingly.” he shrugged. “And today, it was so hot and I wanted a cold drink, so I got some ice from the kitchens, but the water was still room temperature so I took some ice out of the glass and held it in my hand and it didn’t feel like anything. It was really strange.”
“Yes, I am. What are you doing here?”
Distantly, he could feel Ron patting him on the shoulder.
before Harry and Ron leaped in after her, leaving Draco on his own with a sleeping, three-headed dog, playing a harmonica. He held onto the melody for as long as he could before allowing himself to fall down the rabbit hole. He landed with a thump, on a strange, squishy substance. Hermione was on the side, avoiding the stuff completely, whereas Harry and Ron screamed as they were being strangled by the stuff completely. “Stay calm, don’t fight it.” Draco did as he was told but the other two boys seemed incapable of following a simple order. “It’s Devil’s Snare”
“Hold on! I’ll write to my dads and tell them!” Draco could not wait for the Christmas Holidays.
He was about to stride off when, completely unprompted, Mad-Eye produced a wand and his vision blurred. Quite suddenly, he was half a foot high and being repeatedly bounced up and down. He was being trashed against the floor at a pace for about half a minute when finally, his vision and height returned to normal and the thrashing stopped.
” he whispered, Draco squeaked, and he himself was startled when what came out his mouth wasn’t English, instead a strange hissing sound.
Harry nodded. “Absolutely.”
The article itself just said that he disappeared early in the morning under mysterious circumstances.
“I love it, Draco. You’re incredible.”
“I’ll get one with you, Sirius.” said James. “Maybe I can get a lily or something.”
Draco’s eyes lit up. “Ooh! That one’s pretty rare! You can start collecting now.”
“I know but my little star won’t want to be embarrassed by his dad!” Sirius replied, finally placing Draco back on the floor.
But Harry seemed to be thinking on his feet. “... You’re a wreck! You’re barely alive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re hiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul!”
“We searched the whole village but didn’t find anyone who looked like him. He doesn’t have a wand but he could have apparated, they don’t have a way to keep tabs on that.” He sighed and tossed his head back like he did when he was frustrated. “I just really want to find him, I want him to be stupid enough to come to Hogwarts or something so we can get him.” he growled.
“But, I don’t understand, is this some kind of joke? Why aren’t you scared?”
“I have it as a tattoo.” said Sirius, from where he was lying on the other side of Draco.
Harry laughed. “That’s so cute, I want a Draco tattoo.” Draco turned bright red and smiled.
“I’m done with this visit now.” he said, barely above a whisper. “This is the last time we will ever speak.”
Remus smiled. “I have three. My wedding day, getting you, of course and…”
“Alright, well, we should tell a Prefect.”
be captured and put back in Azkaban where he belonged, even if Sirius had to do it himself. Draco
“You alright, mate?” The redhead asked. “You seem kind of angry.”
is the kindest man anyone will ever meet, he has never done anything to you.”
Harry faithfully recounted the lunchtimes’ events. Once he had finished, Professor McGonagall leaned back in her chair, stared at the ground and seemed to ponder the story. At some point, she came to a resolution and produced her wand, using it to conjure a tartan biscuit tin and a tea set.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know, I know. I did the same thing, so did your father. But, what I’m really worried about is what Harry said about you skipping meals.” It was a huge worry for Remus, actually. He could understand better than anyone the temptation to shun your own needs for that of someone else's. At the time, he thought about writing to Draco, to scold him for missing meals, but he knew that it wouldn’t have helped. So he asked Harry to keep an eye on him, and Minerva. Harry would sneak more food onto Draco’s plate or come up with some excuse for them eating together. And Minerva would turn a blind eye when Draco would sneak out to do more research. For the good friends he knew Draco had, Remus was eternally grateful. As was Sirius, who had found it difficult to stay calm. They both knew how lucky they were that Harry had alerted them, if it had gone on they didn’t know what could have happened.
“Harry, this is the lowest form of magic a person can perform, even a Muggle could tell you that!”
When the big match came around, Harry and Draco put on as many Slytherin-branded items as they could and found a place in the stands to watch. It was incredible, unlike anything Harry had ever seen. Draco explained what each player was doing as they were doing it, along with making snarky comments each time one of them made a mistake. To anyone other than Harry, Draco’s words would be seen as mean, but, to him, they were just funny. Each had a witty charm to them that fitted so well with Draco’s ability to pinpoint defects in someone’s character with so much ease. If Harry was being totally honest, he spent quite a bit of time just waiting for Draco to say something again, enraptured by the sound of his childish giggle. Slytherin won, as was their streak, and Harry and Draco were ecstatic. With so much prejudice against their house, it felt really good to have some pride.
Harry cheered louder.
“Remus, you know you can tell us anything.” James said. It wasn’t often that Remus saw them like this. Peter had stopped trying to swallow that stupid amount of food, James was calm, and Sirius was quiet. It was unnerving. He wished that they would all just cut the crap and shame him for his disease already.
Anyways, thank you for your comments as always ♡☆
Riddle started hissing and speaking to something that Draco couldn’t see and the sinking feeling in his stomach grew. Harry’s face was as pale as death but they held onto each other’s hands with an iron grip. They both turned their heads up, however, to see the face of the statue moving, opening its mouth wider and wider. They both backed up until their backs hit the wall and Fawkes flew away to somewhere Draco couldn’t see, Harry had his eyes closed so he followed suit, realising how stupid he was to have kept them open for so long. There was a thud as something big hit the floor of the Chamber: the Basilisk had arrived.
that he felt for him. When they kissed, the stars and the moon collided, creating a nebula.
Remus gave him what he hoped was a comforting look. “The Patronus charm is a highly advanced bit of magic. When cast, it creates a bright beam of light that can take the shape of an animal, when at its most powerful. The animal differs from person to person and is said to represent a protector, or sorts. For example, mine is a wolf. I like it because it makes me feel like the wolf is on my side, rather than against me, as I felt it to be for many years. Sirius’s is a dog because it displays loyalty, something that he treasures very greatly. Also, probably because he is really just a big dog at heart.” This earned a light giggle from his pupils before Harry tentatively raised up his hand.
Draco groaned. “You’re hearing voices now? Last year you were defeating a dark wizard, last month you had a house elf telling you this place was dangerous, last week you were sticking you’re hand in a fireplace.” he listed “I swear on Helga Hufflepuff’s mandrakes, being friends with you is like trying to stop a blind bird from flying into a moving train.”
“Work. They’ve decided to let me go.”
Sirius could see Moony’s eyes shine with mirth and tears as he replied “Of course, Professor.”
“Where?”
Remus smiled fondly. “More than. They were amazing.”
“Let's talk to Hagrid! He knows about all of the animals in Hogwarts!” Harry wasn’t sure, the man had been so nice when he first met him, but since then they had barely spoken two words. Only that stunted conversation about Draco on the train station.
One night in particular, Pansy sat him down and fixed him with an intense glare.
“It’s better than nothing.” But Harry’s eyes were filled with nothing but adoration.
“I’m so sorry, dad, the entrance was sealed off and we didn’t know what to do, I know it was unsafe I’m so, so sorry.” Draco rambled, now on the verge of sobbing. Remus looked like he wanted to reach out and give him a hug, but was restraining himself. Instead, he pried a paper out of Snape’s clenched fist and showed them the headline.
“They won’t be that close, we’ll keep them far enough away!”
“I will hold you to that.”
“Hagrid is a good man, you framed him.” Harry accused.
“Could I please have a moment with you, Harry, in private?”
love y'all xx
“What more can we do? They’ll come back from this with some amazing new discovery and we’ll do all the heavy lifting and then they’ll take the glory. I’m okay with that, so should you be. We’re the brains.” Draco smiled. He liked Hermione. He really did. She was rational and nice to him and didn’t have that stupid recklessness that Harry frequently displayed. She was a good confidant to have, but Draco sure as hell wasn’t telling her what was really on his mind. He didn’t have to come up with something witty to say, however, because Hermione’s prediction came true and two boys rushed to their table, panting and trying to convey some message.
“Don’t ‘Hey, dad’ me.” Sirius’s voice was as cold as ice, a voice that Draco had never heard his dad use before. It made his lower lip tremble and his eyes prickle with tears.
“Over the next few days you may start to feel fuzzy in your head but that’s just the Nargles leaving.”
Harry did another stupid thing.
“Mr Lupin-Black, I am very sorry this has happened.” he said, in a clipped tone. Remus was taken aback, firstly because he hadn’t expected an apology, the Ministry tended to place the blame on others, secondly, because people of high position in the Ministry often treated him as some type of subhuman species, and finally because nobody ever really addressed him as ‘Lupin-Black’. It was always just ‘Lupin’. Or ‘Filth’.
“Mr Potter.” a voice from behind him sneered.
” The door clicked open and the pair scrambled in, seconds before Filch rounded the corner. Harry’s breathing was heavy, but Draco seemed paralysed in fear. Harry followed his line of sight, only to see a gigantic, three-headed dog, peering down at them with menacing eyes. “Harry, I think this is the third floor.” They both screamed and bolted out of the door, slamming it behind them. They ran so fast, there were tears streaming down their faces. It was a miracle they didn’t get caught. When they finally opened the door of their dorm, they closed themselves off with the curtains of Draco’s bed and held each other until the panting stopped.
Sorry it's a little short but there's a really cute chapter coming next!!
“I thought you’d be more excited about Viktor Krum.” observed Draco slyly.
“What are you doing back?” continued the shorter, stockier man.
Oh baby, its a long one. I did this instead of schoolwork.
“Oh yeah, Drake. Which school are you most excited about. The pretty girls from Beauxbatons or the strong, feisty ones from Durmstrang?” Blaise asked, smirking.
He crumbled the bread into sizable chunks and started moving them around into pictures.
“With my mother’s sister and her family.” He didn’t say any more, Remus had obviously hit a nerve.
“It was amazing.” Harry grinned. “You should ask Hagrid to let you have a go.”
“Another twenty.”
“You’re going to be amazing, dad, I just know it!”
“We don’t quite know yet.” Moony’s features were drawn and distant, something he did when he was trying not to worry people with his emotions. He started listing families who may take Harry in but Draco was still focused on the word ‘circumstances’. He interrupted his father, something he never did, distressed.
There was one particular incident which happened in the Great Hall, when a Gryffindor first year approached him at the Slytherin table, and asked for a photograph. It made him feel awkward and uncomfortable, especially when Draco sarcastically whispered something to the rest of the table about how blessed he was to be sitting next to the famous ‘Boy Who Lived’. Their interaction was interrupted, though, by the arrival of Gilderoy, in all his finery. He was an ass. He primped and preened and pulled Harry flush against his side, grinning for the camera, and had the audacity to leave the insinuation that Harry was getting too big for his boots.
“Right after our first kiss, didn’t I, Pads?” Remus shouted the last part loud enough for Sirius to hear.
“I called the Aurors a while ago, they’re on their way.”
“As if you even paid attention to me and Ron.” he sneered.
“Yes.” Harry groused.
“Stop punishing yourself.” said Pads. “Can you tell us any more than what you have told us?” Dobby shook his head, beyond words. “Go home, then, and
“I feel bad lying to him.”
“I’m going to be the manager of the Hogsmeade branch!”
“Great! Do you want to sit together in the train?”
Overall, Harry was so happy. He missed Draco with all his heart, and his dads, but he managed to find ways to forget, Quidditch, exploring the castle, feasts. He wished that he was doing it all with Draco, of course, but the Weasleys weren’t a bad substitute, and he liked having more people in his corner.
“I don’t know.” she confessed, at the same time as Remus said in a grim tone: “He’ll find a way.”
Sirius seemed to be debating punishment of his godson, probably putting the whole thing in perspective, excusing him because of his hideous upbringing seemed like it would be fair. But Snape beat him to it.
“Ah. Well, if it was, that may help you to produce a Patronus.”
The Phoenix swooped down, perched itself on Harry’s leg and seemed to cry. Wait - no - it actually was crying, golden tears. Draco watched in disbelief - healing tears, how could he have forgotten?
Remus stopped dead. “No way.”
“I promise.”
He was beyond words. The wound looked really bad, the fang had splintered when the basilisk collapsed, even when Draco removed it, the damage was already done. Hot tears were streaming down his face, they were so close. He couldn’t contain the jerking sobs as he took in Harry’s emerald eyes for what he feared would be the final time. He wanted to tell him that he loved him, but couldn’t quite get out the words. All he could do was keep repeating the word ‘Harry’ like a prayer.
Remus nodded. “That sounds great. What do you say, Draco?” he looked down at his son and ruffled his hair affectionately.
“I is good, Harry Potter sir, you is very kind.” The creature looked truly shattered.
“I love you too.” It felt too much like goodbye, but they didn’t have the time for much more. Draco lifted their intertwined hands to his face and kissed the back of Harry’s before he let go and ran, arms out in front of him, feeling around. Suddenly, they hit a wall and he backed himself into a corner, heart beating so loud it could break out of his chest. He held up his hand like a visor and peeked at the scene ahead. Thankfully, the creature was facing the other way and all he could see was it’s gargantuan body. Thick and green like a tree trunk, and scaly too.
“No, they need to take care of all of us! We should go find her and tell her to go to Gryffindor Tower.”
It seemed to Harry that their disgust at it was something that they had learned from their parents, as was the case usually, so he spent a lot of time teaching them and it seemed to be working.
“You can’t stop it, child.” Lucius’s voice was hushed and cold. “The more you fight it, the stronger it gets. That is how the prophecy tells it.”
“Look! Draco! Stockings! And there’s one with my name on it!” Leaping off from the bed where he was ruthlessly attacking Remus and Sirius with pillows, Draco squealed. He always became a child again when Christmas came. The two boys settled themselves in front of the tree with a stocking each on their lap, and the two men wandered in, eyes puffy with sleep.
Thank you thank youuuuuu
That night, they huddled up by the fire and talked about their day. Their feelings, their plans. Life was changing for everyone in the family, and they needed to combat that as best as they could. So Sirius suggested that they all move to Hogsmeade.
Thank you guys again for all the kudos, comments, bookmarks literally anything it makes me so happy all of it ❤️❤️
“I swear to Merlin, if we’re late!”
Marcus Flint, the team captain, awarded him the position, and made Draco an alternate. All of a sudden, Harry felt the overwhelming guilt at what he had just done. He had beaten Draco, and was happy about it. He apologised to the other boy repeatedly, being only met with scoffs and lighthearted jokes, but Harry could see the flicker of resentment in those molten eyes that he loved so very much. Draco was talented, but nobody ever noticed because they were scared of him for some reason. They seemed either scared of him, or in awe of his prowess in school, he was the best in the class at Potions, and second best, only to Hermione, at everything else. And now he was second best at Quidditch too, something he genuinely loved.
They both looked up to the sky again, Harry’s mind flashing with the image of his father, comforting his friend. A young Remus and Sirius, holding hands and laughing at some joke one of them told. It made his heart ache just a little, but he welcomed it. He rarely got glimpses of what his father was like, it was nice to know that he was, at the very least, kind.
Dumbledore paused and sat down on their sofa, gesturing for the two men to do the same. They did, more out of habit of doing what their headmaster said than anything else. But, eventually, the wrinkled man spoke in a hushed, calm voice.
“Yeah, I think so.”
As did Remus, it seemed, for he ushered the lot of them a few feet away, leaving Harry behind, transfixed on the stone. Draco noticed that Sirius’s usually clear and bright, silvery eyes shone like the moon with unshed tears. He took his hand and squeezed. Sirius looked down at him before engulfing him in a tight hug.
“I can.” Sirius was gritting his teeth and Moony was rubbing his shoulder in calming motions. “It’s like he’s asking you two to go out and get into trouble.” Harry looked suddenly guilty. “Oh no, it’s okay Harry, your father and I used to use that cape all the time at Hogwarts, just make sure you don’t go too far. Dumbledore can’t keep an eye on you if he can’t see you.”
“But. I. Don’t. Feel. It.”
If any of you live in the UK also, I hope you aren't going crazy after being put in another lockdown. It's kind of scary but we're all in it together.
and studying for his class. The class itself was useless, however. All the man did was retell stories of his adventures, and would frequently insist on Harry joining him on stage to play a vampire or a witch who he would inevitably end up killing, or curing. Harry felt as though he had learned nothing. And it was humiliating. Everyone in the class would stifle laughs behind their hands whenever the Professor gave him acting notes, and would chortle every time he halfheartedly attempted to follow them.
“That tap’s never worked.” Myrtle piped up.
“Hello Hagrid!”
“Well, I suppose that’s only fair.” he leaned back in his chair with his classic ‘I’m about to tell a story’ sigh. “You guys remember how Pads spent four years in Azkaban, don’t you?” The boys nodded, looking quickly to Sirius, sympathetically. “Well, he was in Azkaban because Wormtail or, rather, Peter Pettigrew, framed him for his murder, and the murder of twelve muggles.” Harry and Draco gasped, but Remus ploughed on. “Peter Pettigrew is dead, as far as we know, although Sirius seems to think otherwise-”
It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds. But the truly remarkable thing was the tiny ink dots moving around it, echo labelled with a name in miniscule writing. Astounded, Harry took the parchment from Fred and studied it closer. A labelled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study, and another dot showed Draco leaving his Ancient Runes class. Harry smiled and leaned in to watch the footsteps closer. As he did so, he noticed the caretaker’s cat, Mrs Norris, prowling the second floor, and Peeves the poltergeist bouncing around the trophy room.
Everyone helped cleaning the dishes, exchanging very small amounts of speech for designating tasks, until Harry was scrubbing at a plate a little harder than was necessary and Remus engulfed him in a hug, followed by Sirius, followed by Draco, who burrowed under his father’s arms to the centre, where he, too, wrapped his arms around Harry. The best thing about his family, Draco thought, was that they didn’t need to exchange words in order to know that they were there for each other.
“No, I saw my parents, and you guys.”
“I don’t know. But I don’t like it.”
Draco instead decided to write to his dads and tell them all about it. After sending Perseus off, he turned to see Harry sulking on the bed.
“We’ll miss you, Harry.” said Draco as he finally came up from the hug.
Y'all I'm tired I wasn't even planning on writing them kissing it just happened.
