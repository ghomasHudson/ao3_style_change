Do tell me what Luna thought of the evening with Pansy, and if she would be amenable to accompany my

Draco? It made me want to kill Voldemort on the spot every time. And if it wasn’t for you or Ron or Hermione, I would have stormed off in a rage so many damn times. And for every curse you took, I punished myself.
I can’t imagine going through what you did. Having your home violated, and in the worst way possible. I get it. And I will not question you for those things again. Hell, I’m not even angry about you leaving. You left three days after the battle, with only a note for me left behind. You did it because you knew I would be furious at what the Ministry had in store for you. Didn’t you?
“You should have thought of this before leaving me with a hard-on at work yesterday. And again, right now, in my sleep.” Harry proceeds to leave love bites over Draco’s neck even as he says this.
Muffled sounds.
How many Crucios did they use on me? How many similar lines are carved into your skin now? I didn’t know that you did that to yourself, Harry. I would have never told you had I known. Although, I’m not sure that it would have helped me, not telling anyone. Solitude can make you go mad - I learnt that the hard way. And I’m not very fond of going mad.
“Because you were in a full-body bind,” Draco barely suppressed his scoff.
distracted by the milky expanse of his throat, just begging to be kissed and sucked and marked).
Before Harry could ramble any longer, Elena slightly raised her hand to stop him from spiralling any longer. It was a way that worked best since interrupting Harry often left him confused as to where he was going with his own speech.
“Wow, well I don’t have much to say to that, honestly. I’ve never seen you be this sure of someone. Even Nicolas seemed like a shot in the dark despite how much he had in common with you,” Pansy conversed, as she took small bites of her food in between sentences. She wasn’t wrong, however.
Harry ran his hands through his hair, thinking to how Draco’s hands were just there a few hours back, making him feel at his most comfortable self.
Harry grinned, dipping down a little, his mouth closed over Draco's head, giving a little suck. For his efforts, he got a groan and a shudder.
only known each other for a few days? Yes. Does that diminish the fact that we know this could be something strong? Not at all! Now I don’t know what the cause of your concerns are, and I understand that it’s personal but if I may offer some advice?” Harry asked, looking for a green light from Draco.
“Oh? Why didn’t you continue teaching here instead? Wouldn’t the switch be easier?”
“It’s a good choice. Do you think you’ll need a study? I think it’s the best place to fit in some maroon and in case you ever decide to teach again, the space will be versatile enough for you to adjust it accordingly.”
“Hi! My name is Jerry, are you new here?” he asked Draco, excitedly.
Draco slowly took off Harry's glasses- he liked drowning in his bright green eyes without the interruption of the sodding spectacles, though he'd never tell Harry that. He wasn't a bloody girl! Harry tangled long legs between Draco's and gave him of his special smiles- they were saved only for moments like these.
Draco was just as stunned as Harry had been, his eyes wide. He hadn't meant to say such a thing.
“Fine,” Pansy replied, clearly giving in, “What’s the news?”
wrong that forces our brains to come up with ridiculous questions.” Draco now feared that Harry was the wiser one in their relationship, which was not something that he would ever say out loud, that’s for sure.
Deciding it was now a conversation and being unable to take a hint, Jerry continued making small conversation, the worst kind of conversation Draco decided.
“Alright, I suppose. No nightmares this week.” He slightly chuckled at this, so many of his appointments surrounded his nightmares but whenever he didn’t have them, the sessions seemed more generic.
“Well you know I’m terrible at predicting the future of your relationships but more importantly, do you think you’re ready for a relationship after what Nicolas did?”
Voldemort did not dare tell anyone what he was going to do or who he was going to kill, not even dear Bella.
After leaving the cafe, Draco decided that shopping for groceries would be the best use of his time until he could meet Pansy. Two hours later, with multiple plastic bags digging into his arms practically making them a whole new colour of red, Draco’s phone started to ring loudly as he crossed the threshold of his house. Cursing Pansy in his head, he dropped all his bags with a thud.
The broken-souled man looked down to his, or rather Harry's, hands. They were no longer slim, like a skeleton. They were a healthy brown with ragged and torn nails, a clear sign of how nervous Harry was when alone. In his hands was a self-inking quill and Harry was writing at a lightning speed. He was pouring his complete thought process in that small, frayed notebook; little did the 16-year-old know, Tom caught most of what was written before Harry closed the notebook and locked it into the bottom of his trunk.
“I thought that was obvious? Why else would I be having so many opinions about sofa patterns?” Pansy curiously asked.
, can you even imagine the
Stunned at the person standing before him, all Draco could reply was, “Pansy… I’ll call you back.”
“Draco, I know we haven’t had sex yet but we have the same parts you know, nothing I haven’t seen before. So let me in!”
His leg started shaking the more he thought of Draco, being sure of something so soon did not make logical sense, and lately logic and routine was what got him through the day. Was he just supposed to cave when someone like Draco came into his life, tossing everything about?
Draco looked adorable to Harry, even as he yawned widely and huffed indignantly at being awoken.
“Clearly. Do you want to talk about it? We can always just talk about something else, you know? For example, I have a friend who has six other siblings, all of whom are total redheads but he married a
Ginny. She would have loved coming to Ikea, would have probably played fake house with him before going back to their real house. Sometimes he wanted to punch himself for letting her go so easily whereas the next second wanting to thank and hug Ginny for letting him go when she did. Otherwise, he would have never found the person he had been waiting for his whole life.
“I think we should call it a day. Thank you for all your help but I can take it from here, It’s just waiting in line anyway.” He also needed some time to process his day so far before having to go to Ron’s for dinner.
Soon, in an attempt to have a comfortable night, the two lazily went to Draco’s room. The lights went off and Harry and Draco turned their backs to each other and quickly found themselves drifting off to sleep. Harry could have gone home, very easily so. Draco could have told him to go back to his house but he couldn’t let go of the feeling that he was just meant to be here. He didn’t know if he would be here tomorrow evening when Draco returned from grocery shopping, he hoped he would, but for now all Draco could do was appreciate the fact that Harry
Breakfast was usually made for one but since Draco had a guest he decided he could whip up something slightly impressive. He didn’t get to show off his talents often since not many people visited him, apart from his mum and best friend. Draco wasn’t even doing it for the praise or because he immensely liked this man - that was only five percent of it. The least he could do for Harry, whose company was refreshing from the men he usually stumbled upon that were looking for a casual one night stand, was cook something small and nice.
Draco’s shoulders inadvertently curled as Jerry offered to open his home to him. Invitations such as these were always out of his comfort zone but his mother would have a fit if she knew that Draco hadn’t accepted a polite man’s invitation.
From Elena’s gesture, Harry knew a tough question was coming up, and he wasn’t wrong. “Do you think this person would understand your past?”
The night went on this way, playing would you rather and asking each other questions that had no limit of depth. Of course, they didn’t include their family histories. No, that was still
‘Okay, now that that’s done. Let’s go get confused about what I need to do with my apartment one more time.’ Harry thought, with all of it’s wonderful lighting and affordable beautiful products, coming to Ikea was tough when you didn’t know what you wanted. It was his sixth time this month and every time Harry'd left the store, he went home with a new idea in his head and then realised either his apartment could not accommodate it or he was clueless as to how to do it.
“You aren’t wrong, I have been feeling like our sessions haven’t been fulfilling me as much as they used to in the beginning. And I do like the input and feedback you’ve been giving me today. I feel like I have a lot to work with, if I’m being completely honest.”
“Pansy don’t play, you know it’s me”
“Sure but you were this close,” Draco gestured with his fingers almost meeting each other, “To tipping him off about you-know-who.”
, he had taken a month to decide the one colour he wanted in at least one part of his house and it had been the colour Ron suggested the first time he saw the house.
Harry's hand tangles in Draco's fine hair, tipping his head back and starting in on his throat.
“It isn’t about whose fault it is, just that bringing up any of those memories back up would bring about feelings I don’t want to feel right now. Can we just get on with helping him?”
“Oh by the way, we didn’t even have sex. Bye Elena!” Seeing the astonished look on her face was enough for Harry and he quickly sprinted down the hallway until the elevators were in plain sight.
Harry knew Draco was right where he wanted him. He took a step towards Draco, arms still thrown open, and then he had an armful of warm skin, silver-blonde hair tickling his chin. Harry's breath was almost knocked out of him, and a laugh bubbles from his throat as he wraps lean arms around Draco's slim body.
Nowadays, many companies were putting up job applications on their new websites but Ikea seemingly hadn’t got the memo, Harry realised as he finished filling up his application. It was a good thing that the Ministry of Magic was able to send Muggle diplomas on such short notice, and that Harry requested for one the second he made the decision to work here last week. Once the application was all written out and a scanned picture of his “diploma” was stapled to it, he slipped everything into the tiny blue slot. As Harry slipped the documents in, his anxiety kicked in. All he could do was breathe in and out, trying his best to reassure himself that this was a good decision.
Unable to say anything more, Draco abruptly pulled Harry into the tightest hug he had ever given anyone.
“Thank you. If it isn’t clear, you are so
Nicolas’ cheery reply made Draco a strange sort of angry but he quietly listened to the rest of his explanation.
All that was good about Draco’s mood fled now that he knew Nicolas worked at his favourite shop. Draco thought he’d left everything that reminded him of Nicolas long ago. Somehow, the universe decided two good days were one too many and that Draco was overdue an awkward encounter.
is a simple ceiling lamp with a dimming option for maximum efficiency!”
Harry took a deep breath and sunk further down onto Draco's hard dick, taking it into his mouth. He bobs his head over about half of it, gently sucking and licking the head as he comes up.
Getting up from his seat, he gave her a tight hug, almost melting with the comfort it brought him.
“There's a difference between cosy, ambient lighting and downright dark and ineffectual illumination! A mistake so many people make everyday. I am
Greg sniggered, “I wish you’d get your heads
Snagging the pen from Ginny, Harry wrote the song down on the little slip of paper and stood up to drop their names into the queue.
of feeling than what we’ve… cultivated.”
“Hey there, let me buy you another drink?”
Harry followed Dean’s eyes over to where Seamus was chatting with Blaise at the end of the bar. “Took a war for me to figure out I was mad about Seamus, and even then I was scared,” he laughed. “Can you imagine? A year on the run without my best friend, didn’t know if I’d ever see him again, and I thought I might sick up from nerves, wondering whether he wanted to kiss me too.”
Harry snorted, “What are you talking about, you’re twenty-seven—”
—so good.” And Harry moaned frantically around his fingers, thrusting his hips erratically. “Fuck, Harry,” Draco growled, sitting up, tilting Harry’s hips in and pressing their torsos together, “You look so hot like this,” Harry made a high, desperate sound and Draco slipped his hand around between them, trapping Harry’s cock against the fine, damp fabric of his shirt. “I want to watch you come, Harry, come on, make yourself come,” and then Harry went rigid, and shuddered, his whole body tensing as he cried out, and Draco felt the warm wetness seeping into his shirt and spreading across his stomach, and Harry went boneless on top of him, finally bringing his arms around to clutch weakly at Draco’s collar.
“Pressured?”
Harry opened his gifts next, getting a tin of treacle tart and a gold ring with a large P with detailed filigree work surrounding the letter. “It’s the Potter family crest,” Draco said, rubbing a finger over the ring. “I had to do some digging at Gringotts, but according to their records this is the closest to it they can get. One of the goblins remembered your grandfather and said it looks like the ring he wore…” He was cut off as Harry hugged him tightly.
“What did Ron say that has you so riled?” Harry asked as he came to stand beside him. He leaned lightly against Draco so that his head was on his shoulder.
“Are you suggesting that I sleep with you?”
Harry thought for a brief moment that he should ask him to stop, but it felt so nice. He had never been kissed or touched like this, like he was precious and important. He felt wanted for the first time and he didn’t care if it was fake. He sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth drawing a groan from him. Draco’s hand slid to his hip, gripping tightly as he thrust his own hips forward, his obvious erection pressing against Harry’s.
“He was avoiding the Minister earlier,” Draco laughed, then paused as he realised what Weasley had said. “My boyfriend? He’s not my boyfriend.” But Weasley had already moved out of ear shot. ‘Does he really think he’s my boyfriend or is he just having one over on me?’ Draco thought as he watched Weasley move through the crowd.
“Usually, I only make them for my kids, but Harry and Hermione seem to like them so much that I thought you all might, as well,” Molly beamed, her cheeks pink from all the attention.
Professor Williams had the class divided into two sections. The first part of class, they learned about Muggle currency, banks, clothing styles. Things they needed to know to actually blend into Muggle society. She occasionally added in lessons about Muggle technology and had even scheduled trips for the older students to go to the cinema.
“We’re off, as well,” Draco said as Harry yawned. “I want to get him a warm bath and into bed.”
Harry blushed a bit at this and walked over to the window. “You have a really nice view,” he said, changing the subject. “So, I’ll be way over there, all alone?”
“It doesn’t have to end yet,” Draco said softly as he leaned in to kiss Harry’s neck. “If you don’t want it to,” he whispered, his lips ghosting across Harry's skin.
Draco grabbed his face and kissed him again. “It’s fine, my darling,” he said as he pulled away. “We don’t have to rush. Let’s go look Ron in the eye until he turns red. I bet it won’t take long.”
“I can try,” Draco surprised himself. He didn’t think to actually say it out loud, but now that he had, it seemed like a good idea.
Harry moaned softly when he bit his bottom lip, sucking out into his mouth before releasing it. He tried to pull Malfoy closer, one hand tangling into his hair while the other slid up his side, but he pulled away to rest his forehead on Harry’s.
“Not really,” he whispered.
“Sounds like Hagrid’s rock cakes,” Potter shook his head laughing. “He means well, but they’re quite bad and the name says it all.”
“There are so many possibilities, Potter,” Malfoy smirked at him. “I’ll let you know when I decide.” He turned his attention to Ron and moved a pawn, dismissing Harry without another word.
“Everything looks so lovely,” Mrs. Weasley said to Narcissa, gaining a large grin. “You must have worked yourself ragged to have done all this.”
-------------------------
“If he’s not up in a bit, I will,” Ron agreed, “But for now, let him sleep.”
“Alright,” Harry sighed. “What if we make it a bet? You ask someone and if they say no, I’ll play one match.”
“Come here, Harry,” Malfoy said, causing him to stop in his tracks. When Harry just looked at him, he rolled his eyes and sighed, “Are you going to stand there all day or are you going to come over here with me?”
“Fine,” Potter huffed. “But if I have to talk, I’m going to be comfortable.” He surprised Draco by moving closer and laying his head on Draco’s chest. “I hope this isn’t weird, but I could kind of use a hug at the moment.”
--------------------------------
“Yea, I think so,” Harry grinned up at him. “A little sticky now though,” he chuckled.
“I can’t believe I thought this was a good idea,” Harry muttered, shaking his head. He didn’t want to have Malfoy as his boyfriend, but he was tired of being asked out and having to watch the sadness on people’s faces when he said no. “Alright, fine. I agree to this,” he motioned between them, “Between us.”
“I could get used to this,” a sleepy voice drew his attention. He looked down to find Harry watching him.
“Obviously,” Pansy rolled her eyes.
“I can do that,” Draco shrugged. When Potter gave him an odd look, he explained, “I’m sleeping on the sofa in a flat that Pansy and Greg share. They never complain about me being there, but I don’t want to be a burden and I can’t afford to help them with bills at the moment.”
------------------------
A heavy hand clapped Draco’s back, drawing him from his thoughts and back to the dreadfully boring Ministry function. “You awake in there, Ferret?” Weasley asked and gave him a little shake.
“It’s interesting, if a bit boring,” Harry shrugged. “I appreciate the thought, but I don’t know if I still want to be an auror.” He set the book down as Draco leaned against the pillows, his cheeks turning a bit pink as he watched him. “I want to do something, so tell me if it’s not alright,” he said, his voice soft and a little unsure.
The game started out as what Draco would have considered to be typical. Girls being dared to flash their breasts, boys being dared to show their pricks or asses. It was incredibly juvenile, but entertaining enough to keep his attention. The truths were pretty boring to begin with, but his ears perked up when Macmillan called on Potter and he said truth.
Draco smirked, “That’s genius.” He turned back to the tapestry. “We have something similar at the manor for the Malfoy family line. If you like, I can owl my mother to see if she knows how to repair it.”
“What work could we possibly have to do? It’s Saturday,” whined Harry. He lunged at Draco trying to grab his pillow. This resulted in a tug of war that caused Harry to pull Draco down on top of him.
“Try me.”
“I knew it,” Hermione muttered, grinning at Harry.
Love,
“Not us, just Harry,” Ron said before filling her in on the conversation.
“Fine,” Draco huffed. He grinned as he stood, pulling Harry with him. He kept his pajama pants on and pulled a plain white tee shirt over his head before pulling on the jumper Mrs. Weasley had made him. He turned around to find Harry grinning at him, “What? It’s warm.”
Draco chuckled, “That bad?” He shook his head when Harry nodded and kissed his forehead. “I’m going to shower and change. It won’t take long.” He left the room, leaving Harry alone with Ron.
Harry continued to back away slowly, he would have liked to keep running, but he was so tired. It felt like he was moving through water and he felt feverish. “Stay back, Malfoy,” he whispered, not having the energy to yell.
“I guess I can clean you up again if you get too dusty,” Draco said as he went back to stripping the linens from the bed.
“Just a moment, mother,” he responded, his voice hoarse and raspy. He cleared his throat, “We’ll be right there.” He looked up at Harry, his cheeks pink and eyes shining. “I suppose it’s time for breakfast, but I’d really like to revisit this later. If that’s alright.”
Harry looked up at him sleepily and scowled. “I’m so thrilled that I’m here to amuse you,” he said grumpily as he stood. “I’m going to bed. This is all too weird and I’m tired.”
The last day of classes before the Yule Ball was difficult to get through. Everyone was filled with nervous energy and found it difficult to pay attention in class. Several professors took it easy on them and let them go early. When they were finally finished, Pansy practically kidnapped Hermione saying that they had to do facials and get a moisturizing hair mask on Hermione so that they’d be ready for tomorrow. At some point in the evening, Blaise was seen running away from Pansy’s room after trying to get a picture of her and Hermione in their mud masks.
Potter was surprised enough at the sound of Draco’s voice to turn his head and actually look at him, but not enough to engage in conversation. “Just leave me be, Malfoy,” he muttered, turning his head back. “I just want to be alone.”
Draco had gotten her several dresses and a hooded cloak along with some chocolates and other sweets. Harry, not really knowing what to get any woman that wasn’t Hermione, had gotten her a long, silver hair pin that looked like a peacock feather and a simple, silver chain with an emerald. She immediately put the necklace on and swept her long hair up, securing it with the pin. “This is all so lovely!” she exclaimed. “Thank you both so much.” She swept them both into a tight hug, squeezing them before letting them go.
“Is everything alright, Mother,” Draco asked when they were alone.
“Well, would you like to be?” Hermione asked, smiling at him as she threw another pillow at Blaise.
“It’s not actually,” Harry retorted. “I thought I had made it clear that we were through. We just don’t work, Ginny.” He looked tired and had bruising around his eye and bottom lip. Draco wondered how many times he had already had to fight.
“Alright,” Ron nodded, “So even your worst case is… not catastrophic, eh? Pretty much just the same as things are now?”
Draco gasped in mock horror. Harry shoved him over, swiping the champagne bottle from his hand.
can go—”
As they stumbled from bar to club, clutching each other and talking too loudly, Harry found himself with his arm slung round Seamus, discussing Draco’s prospects for the night. He was walking just ahead of them, tall and lanky and somehow still elegant even as he swayed dangerously, leaning into Greg’s sturdy shoulder. Everyone was dressed to the nines, but Draco—in a sheer, shimmery black shirt (unbuttoned halfway, of course), tucked into ripped black skinny jeans, rings on his fingers and kohl around his eyes—he wasn’t going to have any trouble pulling tonight.
Draco signed gratefully as he shut his office door behind him, scrubbing his hands over his face and loosening his tie, stalking over to the corner cabinet and pouring himself a finger of scotch. He drained it and sagged into the dark leather wingback chair behind his desk, running a hand through his hair, tipping his head back, allowing his eyelids to droop.
“I… During the war, when I started having doubts… It wouldn’t have been enough for me to think disloyal thoughts and hide them. If he’d ever bothered to look…” Draco shuddered. “I couldn’t take the risk. I couldn’t even allow the thought, do you understand? I became very good at it, stopping thoughts before they started, or cutting them off in their tracks and then burying them before they could fully form. If I allowed myself to think those things…” He shook his head, “It was too dangerous.”
“I’m headed to the bar if anyone needs anything?” His voice was smooth and stiff.
“Happy?” Draco sniffed. “I thought so too. But after we all went out last weekend, I think he felt, I don’t know, threatened? It’s been building… He never was very comfortable around everyone. He said the way we interact with each other isn’t healthy. All of us, mind, not just you and me—I know everyone’s going to say he was jealous or something, but it wasn’t just that. He said everyone interfered with each other too much.” He scoffed, but it came out a bit wet sounding. “He was getting distant. It’d been going on for weeks, now. I think I wasn’t as fun for him, anymore, once I came with a whole life, wasn’t just—” he gestured at himself, chipped black fingernails, skinny jeans, “An edgy shag, you know.” He hiccoughed once and Harry caught his hand, squeezed.
“Morning beautiful,” he cooed, “Did you two enjoy your shower?” Harry waggled his eyebrows lewdly.
Harry kept watching as Malfoy drew the spoon slowly from between his lips, feeling a bit dizzy. He looked down at his own lemon square. His mouth watered. Slowly, he lowered his spoon. It slipped right through the buttery whipped cream, through the thick, smooth custard—
“Do you have any idea,” he began mildly, “what it’s been like for me?”
she said,
Harry obeyed, blinking slowly as Malfoy cast healing spells, cracking his nose back into place and siphoning the blood off his face and clothes, cooling his swollen skin and repairing the broken capillaries underneath.
Malfoy looked very concerned at this revelation, and asked whether Harry had eaten dinner, which of course he had—at his desk hours ago. He wanted something sweet now.
“It means long walks on the beach…” Ron grinned, “And then going back to your hotel room together,” he waggled his eyebrows, “Ordering a little room service if you know what I mean?”
The little bubble of relief in Harry’s chest burst, spilling something fizzy and warm into his ribcage and through his limbs.
telling him,
“Ah, yes, Draco,” he was mortified to hear his voice cracking, “I’ve just remembered something—got to go, see you at the Halloween party?”
, because he had come across the world to see this city, with Draco, and it was unthinkable that he might spend a moment with anyone else.
“What the fuck was I thinking? Draco, what—how did you let me agree to do this? Is it—fuck, it’s too late now, I’m going to lose my head completely! What if I forget my lines and end up spouting off about blibbering humdingers? What if I sick up all over Hermione’s dress? What if—”
—” he pushed in barely a centimeter and withdrew, “Why shouldn’t I play with you a bit, when you’ve been teasing me all this time?”
“Sod off Ronald,” Draco sniffed, “You can’t waste the collective wish on that.”
, made Draco say it again, and again, and then he finally sank in, buried himself in Draco’s body, laid his chest flat to Draco’s back, caught Draco’s hands and drew his arms in against his sides, covering Draco’s body with his own. He wanted to wrap every part of himself around Draco, envelop him so completely that Draco would be, somehow, inside of him too, small and curled up under his ribcage.
“I mean, I just don’t know what to think!” Draco continued, “he fucks me, then acts like he wishes it never happens, then asks to be friends, then asks me to call him Harry and when I do he about has a heart attack, then he shows up to this party ogling me all night—it was

“Upstairs,” Harry gasped, “I’m going to—”
“What—” Harry’s brows drew together in confusion.
“Yes, well, I was an awful prat back then,” Draco said airily.
“Another point in favor of muggles—good luck getting one of your adoring fans to honestly tell you you’re
Everyone was silent for a moment.
Potter stood, abruptly, and began throwing his clothes on, all crooked and wrinkled, looking anywhere but at Draco.
Eventually, Draco broke the silence, “So what do you think? People say it’s one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world.”
point stands,” Draco interjected, “That you lot asked—in
“Juvenile? Self-indulgent?” Harry joked, and José grimaced.
While driving up the coast, the album they listen to (
, pressed up against the cleft of his arse, and perhaps there were reasons why he shouldn’t relax further back into the cradle of Draco’s hips, but his brain was fuzzy with sleep and he couldn’t remember what those reasons were or bring himself to care about them. Could it really be so bad? If, maybe, he turned his head and nuzzled into the hollow spot at the base of Draco’s neck? If they tangled their legs together in the sheets?
“You’re staying the night?”
Back at Grimmauld, at the door to his bedroom, Harry once again fought down the urge to invite Draco in. Instead, he slurred his thanks when Draco summoned him a hangover potion, and stumbled through the doorway alone. In bed, his head spinning, Harry allowed himself to think about how Draco’s hair had glinted in the dim, warm light of the bar, how his teeth looked sharp when he threw his head back and laughed. He allowed his hand to slip into his pyjamas. He shouldn’t do it, he knew. Surely there was some ethical rule against wanking to thoughts of your best friend sleeping just down the hall? But his better judgment had been lulled into quiescence by liquor and he sighed as he slicked up his hand and let his thoughts wander. He turned over onto his side, curled up like he had been that morning in Big Sur, imagining it was Draco’s slim fingers that had slipped under his waistband, firm and sure. He wondered how Draco would have fucked him. If they would have moved slow, weighed down and drowsy, careful with each other. He shuddered. He imagined Draco hitching up his knee, holding him still, pressing into him, slow and dizzy in the morning fog. Maybe—maybe he would have heard Draco’s smooth, low voice in his ear, quiet and raspy with sleep, whispering,
Harry wanted very badly to fuck Malfoy. He wanted to crawl across the table, undo his trousers and sit down right on his cock, as he licked the rest of Malfoy’s lemon bar from his fingers.
Harry hadn’t noticed much else about the man other than the soothing quality of his voice, pouring into Harry’s ears garbled, in fits and starts, like a poorly tuned wireless.
“Oh shit,” Harry breathed, “I don’t think I can do this. I’m off my fucking face right now.”
, you’re so— I’m gonna—”
“Fine!” Harry choked out, his voice strangled and oddly high-pitched. “Urgent Auror business! Must be going! Bye then!” He backed out of Draco’s office as Draco was making a deeply perplexed goodbye, chest heaving as he fled toward the lifts. He ended up back at his desk with no recollection of the return journey and spent the rest of the afternoon staring blankly at his mound of paperwork, considering and reconsidering and arriving again and again at the inevitable conclusion that he fancied Draco Malfoy.
Over the next week, Malfoy delivered a crash course in muggle rock music, filling in every moment of office down time with animated lectures, gesticulating wildly as he raved about sticking it to The Man, flushing a little as he queued up his favorite songs. As Harry started listening, he realized that he liked it. He
Harry planted his hands on either side of Draco’s head, lifting his hips so Draco could get a slick finger inside him, slow and sweet. Draco blinked up at him, wide-eyed as Harry rocked back against his hand, moaning, “
Draco’s healer was paused, one hand around the curtain and the other folding a clipboard against his chest. Harry had met him the night before, when they’d finally let him in, jittery with guilt and free visitor room coffee. He had been soft spoken and reassuring, saying to Harry with a faint accent he couldn’t quite place,
“Nah, I honestly want to just sit still for a moment anyways, I’m knackered.”
He reached office 340B and rapped sharply. A few moments passed in silence. Harry’s jaw tightened. Surely someone had informed Malfoy that he was coming. He was probably in there right now, ignoring the knock at the door...
Harry whistled. “The Talisker? What happened?”
They had a shot, and Draco, feeling warm from the whiskey and Potter’s undivided attention, cracked a joke about how it was even more depressing to be alone on Christmas, and Potter said, “Isn’t it? I’m surprised you haven’t asked me back to yours yet—" and broke off, coloring.
“No romance—”
“I’m taking a position with the Tornadoes. It’s not official yet so mum’s the word, please. I’m signing the contract on Tuesday and then I’ll put in my leave here.”
worth all the trouble he would go through? Could he tell anyone about it or was this something he would have to keep under wraps? The Daily Prophet would have a field day with this and Harry didn’t know if he could ever be ready for that kind of magnified observation in his life again.
This was going to be entertaining. And find a way he did, even if it did take him one year.
Draco bit his lip. It wasn’t like he hadn’t asked himself this question but with all that Harry was and the way he cared for Draco, only knowing him for a couple of hours, how could he not be ready for a relationship with this man? Who else would leave a reassuring message even when they were in a hurry?
“Uh, okay then.” Deciding that it was best to move away from the awkward energy, Harry focused on the lamps in front of him. One was a tall, dusky, gold lamp with an adjustable head and length. Looking at it, Harry knew that it would be one of the standout pieces in whichever room he chose to put it in. The other was a faded porcelain white, pleated fabric ceiling shade with a gold wire for hanging it to the ceiling. The muted colour and style reminded Harry of the dormitory lamps and it would provide light to all parts of the room unlike the lamp stand.
sleep, sleep was a sign of weakness. Nonetheless; Tom walked over to the king-sized bed which was covered in porpoise sheets with alternate grey and ivory pillows, got under the blankets, and closed his eerie red eyes soon falling into a deep slumber.
Said hair fell into Draco's eyes- The centre of Harry's attention. His eyes glittered with the flickering flame of candles around him, a shade of silver so cold it was almost blue. They shone like moonstone. Passion and what seemed like...contentment flashed across Draco's gaze as he considered Harry.
“Sure Jul, I’ll make sure you’re one of the first to meet him.”
“It wasn’t a problem. I’d like to help out with your house, here’s my card call me anytime,” Pansy offered, holding out her card for Harry to take.
Draco knew the answer. Harry was comfortable and the blankets were unusually warm, it was no surprise he would have happily taken another nap even if it meant that he would wake up tomorrow afternoon.
That was all he had to say.
“Oh hello, Draco!”
Soon enough, Harry started getting tired of walking around in circles and propped himself on the most comfortable chair he could find and chose to observe the families shopping for their own homes instead. Little children played house with themselves or their siblings, switching the stoves on and off, testing out the beds in hopes that it could be part of their room and best of all, picking up the fluffy stuffed animals and treating them as one of their own. Mothers pushed strollers, quietly admiring the picture perfect dining tables knowing they couldn’t have nice things until their kids got older as fathers went after any Ikea worker they found to ask them a barrage of questions.
Draco wasn’t in the mood to play along so he cut right to the chase. “I’ll buy you lunch today at Paul’s at three o’clock. And I have some news if you have any interest in hearing me out.” Draco had been playing the passive aggressive game for twenty-five years now, Pansy barely had any hold on him anymore.
In another part of town, Draco dried himself off with a towel as he stood in front of his cupboard wondering what he could wear that would make him look fabulous but in a way that seemed effortless.
i am sorry this is so short. it will get longer with each chapter*
Harry laughed. “You flatter me. As a child I didn’t have the best or really any kind of positive relationship with my family and when I joined a new school, I had more responsibility than I signed up for so I didn’t have time to beat around the bush. Being direct was all I knew and then I went out into the real world, realised how rude I could be and then asked my friends why they didn’t tell me sooner,” Harry continued in nostalgia. “Went through some stuff with my ex and had many reality checks on the way, I suppose. Communication hasn’t come easy for me but it’s also something to work on constantly, it really never stops.”
“Oh, that’s interesting! Draco vaguely mentioned something of that sort when we spoke.” Wanting to steer the conversation off himself, Harry began asking Draco questions about what he did specifically. “What type of companies have you worked with, Draco?”
“This would be the perfect reading lamp Harry! It’s a neutral colour so it would likely go with everything and it has so many different height settings!” Pansy loved weighing out the pros and cons of the functionality of the product whereas Draco…
“Hello, Harry. How are we doing today?”
“You better not. It’s, as of today, officially my chair and anytime I am at your house, the only place I’ll be sitting. Let this be known to any and all party guests you may have in the future.” Draco said with his “take me seriously” voice that Harry could now never seem to get enough of.
“Huh, oh hi. Yes I’m here. Just got lost there for a few seconds,” Harry mumbled as he rubbed his hands against his face.
The rest of their evening was spent the way it went last night, in getting to know each other so deeply that the only time they stopped talking was when they stuffed their faces with the leftovers from breakfast.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was no denying that she was right. He certainly didn’t want to lose himself in the whirlwind of what could be this relationship.
Draco rolled his eyes and stood up gracefully, standing still with his arms cross, eyes calculatedly blank as he stares at Harry.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on then," Harry said, rolling his eyes.
, he didn't
“Nothing.” Draco sharply answered through his teeth. Pansy rolled her eyes and folded her arms defensibly.
Harry took a steady step up to the side of the Slytherin's bed, arms folded- he seemed to be holding back a grin on his tanned face. Fixing his lopsided glasses, Harry blinked innocently at Draco- he waved an idle hand and Draco let out a soft snort, grumpily scooching over in the bed.
“That makes sense, it’s good that you want to explore other opportunities while you still can. So what job did you apply for?”
rustling had taken place. Charcoal grey covers covered the young men, but just barely, as two different legs poked out the blankets. As the sun made itself aware that it was there to stay Harry gave up on trying to cover his eyes from the true enemy of his day: mornings. Instead, he chose to turn his face to the pale man sleeping soundly beside him. Harry found himself enamoured by the fellow, mildly envious of his ability to be in such deep sleep that the sun didn’t even make him turn his head.
Two pretty spots of colour flushed in Draco's cheeks and his gaze drops to Harry's neck, then slowly lower and lower.
Picking up the glass of water on the table in front of him, Harry gave Elena enough time to scribble some more notes as she found the words to help express her thoughts.
Harry laughed and quietly stood up.
Have a good one dearies! Stay safe and if you have that idea picking at the back of your brain, I urge you! Please write it! There is never enough (fan) fiction, and I promise you, it'll be one of the most rewarding things you could ever do. trust me, I know <3
"Yes." He smiled, (smirked) and Harry's cheeks flushed too, a grin pulling at his lips.
“You owe me a shopping trip, Malfoy. Just be glad I like to help people out with their new, unfurnished soon-to-be homes.”
While Draco was freshening up, Harry threw their blankets into the laundry, put on his clothes, and began searching around for a piece of pen and paper. As much as he didn’t want to leave like this, it was getting late and he had only so much time before he had to go to work. Moreover, he didn’t want to interrupt Draco’s bathroom concert. Once the items were acquired, Harry tried to make his handwriting as legible as he could and simply wrote:
Although Tom found the diary entry somewhat endearing, he could only think of how he could use this
That was enough to make Harry smile and melt in Draco’s hand.
"Do. You. Want. This."
“Draco, would you and your…friend like to help me find some furniture for my new apartment?” Harry would take all the help he could get, colour choices confused him and he had so many ideas for all that he wanted his new home to look like, picking just one would be the hardest thing he had to do.
Draco smiled, what he hoped was sweetly, but it hid dark promises behind it, and Harry could see that.
“Is that a good chair?” A familiar voice asked him. Turning around, Harry saw Draco standing right behind him next to a short girl with a black bob, arms folded and scaling him up and down.
“I assumed since you were Draco’s friend, you just had opinionated feelings about a lot of things,” Harry lightly jabbed as Draco loudly snickered, covering his mouth to try and control his laughter all while Pansy simply scoffed.
“You took the chance because I’m just that
Harry looked up, dark green eyes piercing even in the soft light- Draco's stomach dropped a little. His eyebrows drew in and cold silver eyes focused intently on Harry. He cups Harry's cheek in his hand. Seconds ticked by, sand in the hourglass of life, and Draco and Harry just stared.
Before the moon could bid adieu, Draco softly slipped out of the covers and tiptoed into the bathroom. He showered the rest of the night away; he had only slept with Harry once, not even
, just
Draco glared at Harry, eyes as cold as steel. "What?"
At this statement, her eyebrows scrunched down as she scribbled down notes in her trusty notepad. The note taking made Harry a lot more anxious at the beginning of his sessions than it did now; they seemed to soothe him. It meant that someone was able to notice things about himself that he had trouble with, and it would eventually give him more clarity.
“Wait, you work in interior design?” Harry was pleasantly stunned, maybe he could take her opinion on what he should do, she
At his reply, Pansy squeezed him even tighter before finally sliding into the booth and settling herself down.
As Harry observed passers by, he mindlessly sunk into the chair further slowly adjusting the pillow to support his back but before he could shut his eyes and drift off to sleep, someone tapped him on the shoulder.
Draco’s hair looked so smooth. It took too much willpower to not run his hands through it so he gave in, making his smile grow wider. Harry felt himself smile in a way that could only be compared to the one of a child at the sight of candy. Not that Harry wanted to lick Draco all over, then again, he would if asked. In a heartbeat. Probably.
dreams and not his
Normally, Harry found solace in roaming the aisles of Ikea, fluttering about the lamps and different light switches or testing any sofa that looked comfortable (so all of them) but today having both Pansy and Draco “helping” him shop for things he needed in his apartment only made him want to set a silencing charm on them but that would be too obvious and he couldn’t risk it.
Subconsciously, or perhaps even more telling, consciously, Draco found himself wanting to tell Harry whatever he could about himself. Maybe Harry had put some kind of spell on him as he'd never even thought to share this much with his friends and he had known them for years. It almost felt like Harry was someone who would be able to understand any and every layer Draco gave of himself.
Draco's eyes widened as Harry mouth was around him and his hips bucked up, a whimper escaping him as his eyes closed and head fell back.
Harry smiled at the thought of how he and Draco met. It was a proper movie moment and he would probably never get over it.
Oblivious that his home was empty, Draco called out, “Harry, do you have any plans for the day?” Not receiving a reply, he tried his luck again. “Harry? Are you there?”
“Yes, well, Pansy you work in interior design. People break into a nervous sweat over choosing eggshell or off white when there's no question, eggshell is always the better option.”
to say. He just surged forward, grabbing Draco in a hug. He held Draco tightly, and time seemed like it stood still.
Harry grinned at Draco, eyes dark with lust and hopefulness. He lifted one of Draco's legs, kissing behind his knee, then up to his thigh, then higher and higher...He stopped to suck a hickey onto the junction between Draco's thigh and crotch- Draco moaned Harry's name, head thrown back.
“I…uh, wasn’t able to practice them the past few days.”
“Draco, is everything okay between us? Did you not receive my note?”
“Well,
Harry grinned predatorily. "Sorry, I couldn't hear you."
Creating the horcruxes had been easy- knowing that they might get destroyed one day was a little harder to deal with, which is why Voldemort kept one of his souls in his snake, Nagini. She was always close to him, making the chances of her getting killed by anything a lot more difficult.
Harry leaned back against Draco's pile of pillows, relaxing and stretching. He eyed Draco from under dark eyelashes. It was hard enough to make him out with this terrible lighting, never mind without his glasses.
Draco squirmed underneath Harry, pulling away from the kiss with wide eyes.
, of course.” Harry smirked and simply pulled Draco back down to the couch, who happily gave in.
“Firstly, that is the least irrational thought I’ve ever seen anyone have. Secondly, if I’m being honest, I haven’t let it cross my mind but I do know that the second I leave your sight, all the questions about everything we are and we aren’t, are going to come flooding in. And trust me, I have a lot of questions. But we’re going to work
Harry crawled up Draco's body, grabbing his tie and carefully wrapping and knotting it around Draco's delicate wrists and the headboard. He grinned down at Draco, who was glaring at him with lust blown eyes. "Do you mind?" Draco said through clenched teeth, eyes dropping to his erection.
In an instant, Draco seemed to perk up, “Of course, Harry! I wouldn’t mind at all, Pansy might take some convincing but not a problem.” Before Harry could say anything more, Draco hurriedly walked out of the bubble of the silencing charm and took Pansy out of Harry’s earshot.
Most people who worked at Ikea were usually friendly, but when you visited the store every other week without buying anything and managed to cause multiple (small) accidents, you started gaining a reputation. It was for these reasons that Harry was on the receiving end of multiple stink eyes and these only intensified when he walked up to the small desk where job applications and important notices were pinned up.
per se, but somewhere along those lines. Planning the operation to destroy Harry Potter was one thing; executing it
“Draco are you in there? Could you open up, please? I need to use the loo.”
“If I didn’t let you know earlier, let me tell you now. You look like an absolute snack,” whispered Harry before finally letting go of Draco.
from them. So, was this person
“Wayfair street, please.”
“Honey, I am a full sized
, but it still made him feel as if he were stuffed full of butterflies when he thought of how intense their conversations were getting, how intensely Harry had already started to look at him. How anything Harry said made him turn so pink that Pansy would have called him “Peaches”. Before the water could get any colder, Draco stepped out and his thoughts fluttered about as the steam settled down.
“I think I have, actually. I just bought a new apartment near Baker Street and since I didn’t have many belongings that were mine in the old apartment, I decided to design it myself!”
Harry cautiously showed interest, careful not to seem too eager, and politely replied, “Oh?” The tone of a question formed as a concern.
the boy. He was sure he would find a way soon. He was now sure of how Harry felt about this war, he was afraid but confident.
Draco harrumphed, his eyebrow arching perfectly as he glances at Harry over his shoulder.
Voldemort wished he could have put one of those muggle tracker things on his horcruxes so he could always know where they were; unfortunately, they weren't invented 20 years ago, back when Voldemort desperately needed them.
He grinned at Draco before swooping down and pressing his lips to Draco's.
Tom woke up with a start and sat upright in his bed trying to remember what exactly Harry had written in that journal.
worked here.”
Just as he was about to leave the bathroom with whatever dignity he had left, Harry grabbed his elbow and turned him around, pulling him into the tightest hug Draco had ever received. Once Draco relaxed considerably, he heard Harry softly whisper in his ear softly whispering into his ear, “Do you want to talk about anything?”
Worrying about a relationship that barely existed right now, before Harry reached his appointment, would only make for a more rushed one. To calm himself down, Harry did the best thing he could with the remaining few minutes he had to himself - plug his earbuds in and press play on his favourite playlist as he continued taking deep breaths and looking out the smudged window at the racing street passing by to relax himself.
Harry’s shock at her words had to have been evident on his face. It never even occurred to him that therapy wasn’t working as well as he wanted it to. Nonetheless, he supposed Elena was right. The sessions were starting to get repetitive recently and her input today was helping him look at things in a different light but also help him be more sure of his own decisions.
“I take that as a compliment, you know, but you will not bring any hair colour
Harry’s heart beat rapidly as he listened to the lyrics, his mind processing them. Being with Draco truly did feel like it would last for a million years but Harry didn’t have faith to make a relationship last that long. The fact that he was able to talk so deeply and comfortably with someone for a full forty-eight hours, was most surprising. In all the time that he had spent with Draco not once did he want to run away or hide or cause disappointment.
Draco cupped Harry's face in soft hands and kissed every feature of his: his forehead, nose, the crease between his bold eyebrows and finally...his soft, full lips. Each kiss that was left was tender and filled with love but also, inevitably, sent sparks of heat through Harry's blood and down his body.
The morning shone bright with hope and fluffy clouds greeted Draco as he walked out of his building. The turtleneck certainly kept him warm as the winds blew swiftly in every direction. A strong espresso delivered by his favourite barista was exactly what Draco needed to set his morning off in the right direction and since he had taken some vacation days this week, he was free to do nothing. The last time he remembered having this much free time was the summer before he went off to college. Free time was not something he knew how to fill up but he knew just the person who did.
“Um, thank you for the offer but I am quite busy the next few weeks. I’ll see you around, though?” Jerry’s face visibly fell as Draco uttered those words and had begun to regret it a little, but before he could take his words back, the elevator dinged open for the ground floor.
Loved finding something the polar opposite and confusing Harry about any decision he had his mind set on.
“Yeah, he went away a long time ago, I’d rather not speak about it.”
Dragging this would only be painful for him so Draco had simply told her in one long rambling speech: “Well, I went to the coffee shop next to my apartment after a week or so mostly because I was busy with this man, yes the one I mentioned earlier, and he was absolutely wonderful. We just talked all night and day two nights in a row, and we didn’t even do anything besides that!” Draco nodded rapidly at Pansy’s shocked face and continued. “Yeah, I know! And as I was reeling in the happiness of that and meeting Jul after so long, out of nowhere, pops up Nicolas, who I haven’t heard a peep of in the last six months when I caught him practically cheating on me in our bedroom and just gives me my order while talking to me about his shift change! All happy and cheery like nothing happened! Like we were just two pals catching up!”
“Fine. Let’s get to it then. I’ll drive.” Pansy agreed.
"Hey."
Thankfully, Julianna was the only one who took notice of the commotion which was most likely because Nicolas was at the back of the store taking care of another task. Draco bet a hundred pounds it wasn’t his relationships.
"Do you want this?"
“A proper idiot you are, you know that?”
A/N: I hope that chapter made up for the lost time. I am so sorry I didn't publish this earlier. It was quite short when I wrote it but I really wanted some smut in this chapter so I asked one of the best people in this world to help me and he added most of the smut in this chapter. I will try to update this but no promises because I have school and I am working on something big and important and I am so stressed, ahhhh. I love you all and thankyousomuch for reading this book <3.
Draco turned his head away and frowned.
With a hearty laugh, Julianna nodded her head, “Coming right up Draco!”
“Well, to be fair to myself, I didn’t mention where we were shopping. If it helps, we’ll go to a few stores after that, alright?” Negotiation was the only way Draco could get what both he and Pansy wanted.
Draco simply rolled his eyes at her transactional way of conversation.
Harry smiled in Draco's direction, holding a hand out to him.
Harry was always the one to take charge, so naturally, he was on top of Draco in two seconds. Draco smirked (his plan had succeeded, as he'd known it would) as he lifted his head to deepen the kiss. The more they kissed, the more clothes came off; all through this, it was lust: passionate and desperate. With each pair of cloth that came off, Draco and Harry exchanged endearments and insults topped with even more endearments.
Harry couldn't breathe, eyes locked on Draco, and then they were kissing, pushing, ripping and tearing and bleeding.
“I haven’t had a meal like that in a long time,” Harry expressed.
“Um, two actually. I wasn’t at home for two days and I met a guy. He’s absolutely wonderful but I don’t know so much about him and he doesn’t know so much about me. I’m so scared but he was also the reason I didn’t have nightmares this weekend. Maybe it was the comfort of someone near me that made me calm through the night or the thought of him finding out about who I am, that scared me too much for me to show him that side of myself.”
I hope you loved reading this as much as I did writing it. Tell me your thoughts! What did you think of Harry and Draco's relationship? What was your favourite part or line? If there was a part two, what would you want to be in it?
Harry's hand stroked at the base of Draco's cock, his mouth occupied with sucking on his head- Draco's back arched, his lips opened in a high moan, and-
“He doesn’t need a reading lamp, what he
With more surety in his voice than Draco thought existed within him he answered Pansy in the best way he knew how, with an analogy only she would understand.
you it wouldn’t be a ‘short’ nap! Why did I take the chance?!”
“I guess I figured that I would have to undertake a different approach if we needed to make progress with what you’re going through. All that I have tried before, clearly isn’t working anymore.”
“Draco! What are you doing here, twice in one week?” Harry chuckled, he wasn’t prepared to see Draco this soon after he left his home, especially before he got time to process what happened in the last few days.
“I’m not sure, but why not take a chance?”
Draco was trapped. Either he could let Harry in and be unwontedly vulnerable with him at the worst possible time or keep the door closed for a few more minutes with the hope that Harry would eventually give up, although it didn’t seem like that was going to be the case anytime soon.
'Legilimens!' Draco's face crumpled at the struggle of blocking Lord Voldemort's incantation. This was the third spell he had cast on the pale-faced boy that night; first being the Cruciatus curse, second being the Imperius. Both equally torturous, making Draco weak in the knees and slightly sick to the stomach. Neither of these spells worked well enough for the Lord. Draco, being the loyal son to Lucius, told Voldemort what he asked but he was quite vague and the Lord was never patient nor caring about other's feelings if he could benefit from the information in the person's mind.
In his peripheral vision, Tom could see a four-poster bed with deep maroon curtains. He instantly knew where he was; the Gryffindor dorm room. This was fifth year all over again. Tom was in Harry's head and the latter was completely unaware as he kept writing in a journal that looked oddly familiar to Tom. His subconscious clicked reminding him that this was the same journal Lily had kept on her nightstand on the night he went to kill Harry Potter when he, himself got turned into ash instead.
That night, Voldemort fell face first on his king-sized bed- exhausted from torturing people left, right and centre. Dreaming from Harry's head had become a usual routine now and almost every time, it was about one thing: Draco Sodding Malfoy. This time though, it was slightly different...more queer than normal.
The charming interior design of the living rooms caught Harry’s eye first, pulling him into the tiny living space. How would he be able to work here when folding his own clothes took so much out of him? With every room he visited, Harry fell more in love with different aspects of each of them whether it was the curtains in the living room or the wall cabinet in the mock bedroom or the pots and pans in the kitchen. None of the rooms matched the kind of style he was usually drawn to but they were all so quaint, Harry would have made it his home if he could do so. It would be a lot easier than buying, arranging and organising the items for his own home.
Hermione’s eyes softened. “Sorry, Harry, we’re not trying to pile on, it’s just, maybe there’s a reason none of your relationships last?”
“Are they asking for all of us or just you, Draco?” Anushka called over, swiveling around from where she was absorbed in the gears of the backwards-ticking grandfather clock looming in the corner.
“Hey!” Ginny leaned in, slinging a protective arm around Luna’s shoulders, “Don’t insult the collective!”
Potter chuckled, low, in his ear, “No I can’t, or I’ll come.”
“Harry,” Hermione said kindly, “When you’ve hurt someone… they don’t have to forgive you, even if you apologize.”
“Have you left anything for me to do?” Harry asked.
Greg shrugged, “The universe knows what I meant.”
“You mean shagging muggles, when I used to be a party to muggle torture?” Draco asked lightly.
“What Hermione’s trying to say is, no one can stand playing third wheel to you and Draco.”
"What do you mean?"
to do anything about these feelings. He didn’t have to pursue a relationship with Draco to hold his friendship close, to continue to lean on him, and curl up on the sofa with him, and eat takeaway late at night and headbang to punk rock in the kitchen with him. He could still have that. He could have all that, and he would be happy, too. There was no doubt in his mind. If it was what Draco wanted, there was no question that he could do it.
“Don’t apologize,” Draco brushed his thumb across Harry’s cheekbone, leaving a shiny smear, “I like it.” Harry shivered. “If I’d known you would be like this… God, I wouldn’t have waited so long.”
,” Pansy pointed up at the countdown clock floating above their heads, waving her sparkler aggressively, “One minute!”
Draco drew back, shaking his head, said, “Harry, you’re— thank you.”
“I am IN!” Ginny slammed her hands on the ground.
On a bright Monday morning in mid-September, Motion City Soundtrack released a new album and Harry and Draco stopped by HMV to pick up the CD on their way to work. Harry shouldered open the office door and sank into his rolling chair. Draco crossed the room and popped the CD into the hybrid magi-muggle speaker they had rigged up when they’d officially become partners and gotten their own office three years ago. The familiar voice rang out across the small room as Harry pulled some paperwork across his desk and inked his quill.
Harry went out and bought some CDs after that, a set of obnoxiously loud speakers for his bedroom, some headphones and a little device called a Walkman that he could put the CDs in and take around with him. Soon, he was talking about music with Malfoy at work, and listening to Malfoy’s music everywhere else. And talking about music at work actually meant talking about how Malfoy had gotten into his music in the first place, which meant talking about how Malfoy had done his Curses and Dark Arts Mastery in the United States, and how he had explored muggle culture there, and found catharsis in punk rock clubs. When he talked about music, Malfoy’s eyes would light up, and his face, usually blank and guarded, would turn hopeful, expectant when he played Harry a new song. Sometimes, it was almost endearing. Almost. The rest of the time, they maintained a strained sort of truce, a brittle cordiality. Their interactions were mostly polite, if stilted—
Distantly, he heard himself whimper gratefully as Potter began to press in, throwing his head back on a long, low moan as he slowly seated himself fully. Potter paused for a moment, breathing heavily, “alright?” he asked, and Draco responded emphatically in the affirmative. Potter set a languid pace, again, as if he were calculating exactly how to drive Draco absolutely mad, which he probably was. But Draco found that he couldn’t really mind it, not when Potter was fucking him like this, running his hands softly over Draco’s back and murmuring depravities in his ear. It was so different than he would have expected—almost excruciatingly intimate, the slow drag of Potter’s cock filling him up, the sound of his voice, vibrating low across Draco’s back. Draco shivered. He desperately wanted to touch himself, but he held back. He was so close, had been for ages it felt like, but he needed— “
“You look horrible,” Draco croaked.
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous,” he breathed, and kissed him, slow and filthy. Draco swayed, woozy, and he could feel where Harry was hard, pressed up against his thigh. He moaned weakly and Harry pulled back, resting their foreheads together. “Let’s get you to bed, shall we?”
Harry drew back, elbowing him gently in his ribs—the non-injured side. “Course I missed you, you prat. Now come on, food’s here.”
Harry let out a bark of gleeful laughter. “Motion City Soundtrack.”
, come on, I’m ready—”
“It’s quite alright,” Draco replied, low. They were standing close. He was vaguely aware that he was still holding on to Potter’s arms. Potter tilted his head and considered Draco intently for just a moment and then—leaping headfirst into things like he always did—he closed the distance between them. And then Draco was
would have been. Harry took a moment to wonder whether the music he was about to hear inside would have put Fluffy to sleep. He grinned to himself.  A few clusters of uni students were hanging around outside, smoking cigarettes and scuffing their shoes on the pavement. And there was Malfoy, leaning up against one of the columns on the far side of the door, arms crossed, scowling. He caught Harry’s eye and blinked as if surprised, just for a moment, before his face settled into blankness. He nodded toward the window and together, they got their tickets checked and walked through the door.
“I’ve been thinking…” Potter’s voice was low and deliberate in Draco’s ear.
“Yes,” Draco moaned through his hands. “I’ve been offered a formal invitation into the friend zone.”
The album Harry was listening to when Draco came home and told him about the breakup would be
, we only can’t tell anyone for two days.”
Well, Harry hadn’t been able to resist stopping in when the doors opened—
as the burst of fiery lights streaked across the black sky.
“Yeah, course,” Harry laughed, warm inside. Draco was cute like this, all fidgety and excited. Harry knew that Draco had taken José out with Pansy a few times, but other than her and Harry, he hadn’t met anyone else yet. Draco wanted to ease him into the friend group, something about them being rather a lot to handle. Personally, Harry advocated for trial by fire—if any potential partner couldn’t handle their friends, it probably wasn’t going to work out anyways. But Draco had flatly refused that approach, shaking his head, saying,
“What?”
Draco nodded at Ron in the corner and the music blared from the ancient muggle speakers Arthur had been working on for weeks, straight to the chorus,
As he crawled into bed, the words echoed in his head. He was acutely aware of Draco’s presence down the hall. Asleep in his bed at this very moment, in his pyjamas, with his sleep-mussed hair, starfished across the bed. Harry thought of Draco on weekend mornings, making a smoothie, collapsing next to Harry on the couch, flinging a beam of light around the sitting room floor for the cats to chase, bringing a fat joint up between his full lips, exhaling into Harry’s mouth. He thought of Draco in his robes at Ron and Hermione’s wedding, waiting for Harry with a drink in hand when the ceremony was over, bracketing Harry in his arms for a slow dance, his easy, indulgent smile, the delicate sweep of hair across his forehead. He thought of waking up next to Draco in the hotel room at Big Sur, replayed the slow roll of Draco’s groin against the side of his hip, the low groan Draco had made before he woke up.
“Get a room, you two,” Pansy moaned, flicking a drink coaster across the table at them.
“Pans.” He looked at her and looked away, cleared his throat. “You’ve always… You’ve cautioned me, with Potter, not to let myself—” He took a deep breath. “Is it true? What he said. I can’t—” He choked out, “Pans, I can’t—”
Harry gaped after him for a moment and turned to Draco, who said tightly, “Don’t mind Theo, he’s just taking the piss.”
“Yeah,” Neville said softly, holding the door open. “Come on, let’s get back out there.”
And she hadn’t been wrong—Harry was dead comfortable in his own skin these days, but Merlin, did everyone in this city have to be so
Harry clenched his teeth against a sudden panic welling up his throat. If he said Malfoy, he would have to tell them the whole story, there was no getting around it. Hermione would scold him, and he would feel even more terrible than he already did. But more than that, she would ask him
“Well,” He tossed his head, “I came up here to sing. And I
doing here on Christmas?”
Draco found him in there, leaning over the bowl, bracing his hands on his knees and breathing evenly through his mouth, wondering if he would feel better if he just vomited.
in a surprisingly velvety baritone, at which point she had gone scarlet and veered into spectacularly drunk, swaying precariously in her seat and burying her face in Weasley’s neck when he returned, looking more self-satisfied than anyone with that many freckles had a right to be.
And then Ginny was clapping him happily on the back and Luna was pressing a single-use packet of glittery lube into his hand, so Harry had to yell back, “No! We’re not fucking! We’re getting chips!”
Harry took another step closer; they were close enough to touch now, but he didn’t reach out just yet.
“Why do you think I keep him around?” She retorted, eyes twinkling.
Pansy rolled her eyes and swatted him on the shoulder. “Haven’t you heard, Draco, the friend zone was invented by sad chauvinists to avoid taking responsibility for their horrible personalities.” She sniffed, “I certainly won’t allow you to endorse the idea, much less relegate yourself to it. Anyways dear, what did you say?!”
with you? For fun? What am I, a fucking psychopath?”
your strategy for getting in my pants a second time?”
Harry snorted. “Not like I’m not fucking thinking about it.”
They didn’t wait for Ron and Hermione before making their way to the kitchen and serving up some fruit salad. Fifteen minutes later, Ron came huffing through the doorway carrying a steaming casserole dish, shouting,
famous character, I can only imagine how… uncomfortable it could be for Harry.”
“No!” Ginny shrieked, flailing her arms, “Don’t sabotage the collective!”
“Right,” said Harry.
The night wore on and José seemed mollified by Draco’s sabotage, but he hardly spoke to Harry. Harry tried to act normally, as if that hadn't been catastrophically awkward, but he was distracted—unsettled by the sudden reminder of the New Year's wish, and the way José’s eyes had searched him, like he was sure he would find a secret.
Harry’s hips jerked as he whimpered, “Draco, please—”
Harry stiffened in his arms, hurt flashing across his face.
Harry took another bite. He had never tasted anything like it—the sharp lemon, sour-sweet and cold, the feel of the crust in his mouth, warm with cinnamon and ginger, the crunch of the sugared pecans on top and the velvet whipped cream. All his senses were singing, his mouth throbbing as he let the cool, creamy filling melt on his tongue, chewed the crust methodically, reverently. He took another bite. Distantly, he was aware that he was making noise, moaning indecently, sexually even. It was mortifying, but he couldn’t hold it in; he had no control, his body reacting to the stimuli like a light at the mercy of its switch. He took another bite. His chest was heaving, and he realized with a humiliating mixture of horror and arousal that he was grinding his arse down into the chair, spreading his legs, stretching the fabric of his trousers tight against his crotch. He took another bite. He felt sublime, rapturous, vibrating with energy, unable to focus on anything save the overwhelming pleasure blooming from his tongue and beating through his body. He took another bite. Sensation was building, pulsing up through his solar plexus and radiating down his arms, tingling waves of pleasure, crescendoing up and up—he took another bite.
“That’s not what I asked you,” Draco sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
“This entire hall is for guests?” Harry asked, eyes wide in wonder.
“Well handled, Draco,” Hermione said from behind them.
“We all get good press out of it,” Malfoy shrugged. “They’ll get to look like they’ve rehabilitated us and we get a chance to prove we’re not as awful as our parents.” He looked down at Harry. “And the fact that I get to annoy this one is purely a bonus.”
Draco ground into him, groaning as he came, his hips flicking a few more times as Harry’s ass milked his prick. “Fuck!” he growled as he flopped sideways on the bed. He pulled Harry close to him and hugged him. They lay there quietly for several moments as their breathing returned to normal. “Are you alright?” Draco asked when he could find his voice again.
They stayed like that for several long heartbeats, Draco clinging to Harry with his teeth still embedded in his neck. As their breathing slowed, Draco eased them to the ground. He was gentle as he moved Harry so they could lay on their sides. He licked the bite he had made on Harry to help it heal faster as he waited for his knot to go down.
Draco huffed out a laugh. “And exactly how much time have you spent thinking about my bedroom, Mr. Potter?”
“Definitely,” Harry nodded. “His tea is drinkable, but you don’t want his cooking.”
The walk to Hogsmeade was cold, but pleasant. Harry hated to admit that he liked being held so close to Draco, but he was so warm that he felt it was justified. As they walked through Hogsmeade, several people glanced their way before staring in open surprise. “We might not have to tip off the papers, after all,” Draco muttered as he steered Harry towards the Three Broomsticks.
“Yea,” Harry nodded. “I think I’d like that.”
Harry had finally had enough and grabbed him by the lapels. “Ronald Bilius Weasley!” he yelled. “Calm the fuck down! You’re stressing me out.”
The second half of class was for Muggle sports and self defense. Dean Thomas was ridiculously excited to share his love of football with his classmates, but Draco loved the self defense portion of class. Two class periods a week, they were paired up and taught how to defend themselves from physical attacks. “The Muggle world is a dangerous place. Muggles don’t have magic, but they have weapons. You need to know how to defend yourselves without magic as well as with it,” Professor Williams had said.
On a particularly windy evening, Potter approached Draco in the common room, “Can I have a moment?” he asked quietly.
Harry had stopped in the middle of the hall and was staring at him. “I think you may have gone round the bend,” he cocked his head sideways and continued to stare at Malfoy. “Are you serious, Malfoy?”
“It’s almost time for dinner so we had best get you back to your Gran,” Potter said, still smiling. “She’s probably missing you.”
“I’m not going to deny it,” Potter said, turning back to the food. “I think we’re about ready. Can I bother you to grab the plates? They’re in the cupboard just behind you. Oh, and glasses. I have a few different types of juice or there’s water if you want.”
“I lost in fourth year when you didn’t go to the Yule Ball together,” Pansy shrugged. “But I did win on Granger going with Krum so thanks for that.”
“It’s not fair that I can’t touch you like that,” Harry whined when Draco moved back to his neck.
“That’s fine. Give yourself some time to think about what makes you happy,” the headmistress said, giving him a rare smile. “And you, Mr. Malfoy?”
The functions he had attended after Astoria’s passing had been the hardest. So many piteous glances, so many well meaning sympathizers. They made him sick. Everyone said the same things, “We’re so sorry to hear…” “If you need anything…” It was all just to look good. To give the air of caring. No one actually cared. Well, no one except Harry.
“She was going to be the mother of my children, that’s why!” Potter huffed and tried to roll away.
Draco was surprised to find Pansy home when he entered the flat. “How’d the interview go?” she asked.
“I can’t believe they’re letting us do this,” Ron said. He and Draco had become surprisingly good friends while helping rebuild Hogwart’s over the summer. They had argued a lot at first, but after a few boring evenings they had played chess and formed a tentative friendship. As the summer progressed, they grew closer and actually enjoyed being around each other now that Draco wasn’t as much of an ass.
“He’s absolutely wonderful,” Pansy beamed. “The best shopping partner I’ve ever had.” Harry chuckled as Ron blushed from the attention. “I hope they have a table open big enough for us all,” Pansy added as they filtered inside.
It was Harry’s turn to sigh. “Honestly, the line is very blurry for me. I’ve always thought that I hated Draco. Like, always. But now… Now I like being around him. He’s nice to me and he’s funny.”
Parkinson, flanked by Zabini and Goyle, stood between the two sofas with their backs to Lavender and Parvati. “Were you planning to tell us we were making nice with the golden trio eventually or did you intend to let us figure it out on our own?” Parkinson said, scowling at Malfoy.
After several hours of studying, Harry was ready to murder Draco, Hermione, and Blaise. Greg seemed to be the only one as uninterested as Harry and they wouldn’t let them sit near each other to complain. They decided to have lunch at the Three Broomsticks since they were going into town anyways, so they were currently headed to their rooms to get warmer clothing. Harry wanted to run to the common room just to get some peace, but Draco insisted on holding his hand as they walked. He had also kept touching him while they were looking through the potion’s books and he was beginning to like it.
“Why would he agree to it?” Ron asked.
“I would have gone,” Pansy had said when he told her about it. “No work,” she scowled at her work apron as she said this. “Just be Blaise’s girlfriend and live a carefree life. Sounds good to me.”
“It’s Draco, darling. Or you can call me an acceptable pet name if you’d like,” he seemed to be thinking about it. “Nothing ridiculous like snookums. That’s just awful.”
Harry pulled on his winter cloak and was grabbing his scarf when a gentle knock sounded on his door. “Come in, Hermione.”
“Of course,” Hermione said.
Draco laughed at that, “The honesty condition does have a disadvantage after all.” He paid for the tea set and arranged for delivery before asking, “Do you want to get dinner here, or go back to the school?”
It was a quick walk back to the park and Draco breathed in a sigh of relief at seeing Potter still sitting on the bench where he left him. He had worried the entire way back that Potter was messing with him and wouldn’t be there, but he was. Laughing as he watched Teddy play. Draco sat beside him, watching as the little boy climbed up the wrong side of the slide. When he got to the top, he stood victorious for a brief moment before turning and sliding back down.
He stood, leaving Ron to it, and headed in the other direction. This close, he could only smell the omega they were fighting over. He wasn’t certain if it was Pansy or Blaise and he didn’t really care.
Just after Halloween, the professor allowed the students with the highest scores in her class and good grades in their other courses to join a dueling club. It was better than Draco had expected. She taught them basic sword techniques and said they’d be learning how to spar with a partner. The goal was to be able to display basic sword techniques for the class before the Yule ball. Draco loved the lessons and soaked them up like a sponge. Potter was, of course, right beside him. They had always been evenly matched in quidditch and this was no different. They were both quickly surpassing their classmates and only seemed to be in competition with each other, as usual.
“I resent that,” Hermione grumbled from behind her books.
Harry sagged against him, “Are you sure it’s ok?”
He shook his hand quickly before stepping to the trunk at the foot of one of the beds. As he started to rummage through his things, Harry asked, “Why is it just us in here?”
Ron stared at Harry in shocked silence for several moments. “Yea, you’re right. I should be calm. I look great. Better than Percy ever did,” he muttered the last bit while looking in the mirror.
“I definitely don’t want to be seeing this,” Ron muttered and left the room.
Stepping into the bedroom, he looked around for several moments. Finally, he stepped into the living area, “Did the elves maybe leave my trunk in here?”
He looked around the large room, a piano in the corner catching his attention. He sat in front of it and tapped a few keys just as the floo flared to life and Potter stepped back through.
It did startle Harry, however, when McGonagall appeared at their table in the library on Thursday. “I was concerned that the two of you were up to something, and with your histories I felt that it was probably going to cause me a migraine. However, after speaking to your professors, I see that Mr. Malfoy seems to be having a positive influence on your studies, Mr. Potter. Are you still set on the path of becoming an auror?”
Harry just rolled his eyes, sighing dramatically as he entered the Potions classroom. Hermione gave him a questioning look as he sat next to Draco. Ron looked at their joined hands and laughed, gaining himself a glare from Harry. “At least I’ve gained a good potions partner,” Harry muttered, trying to be positive.
As Blaise left, Pansy and Hermione entered the room, drawing gasps from the few remaining students. Pansy had on an emerald green evening gown with a sweetheart neckline. Hermione was wearing a simpler mermaid cut dress in a lovely shade of lavender, her usually bushy curls framing her face delicately. Ron and Greg seemed frozen in place. Harry had to shove them to get them moving.
“Yes,” Harry panted. “Please.”
Harry grinned as he stepped back, “I’d like that. But maybe we should try the bed this time.”
“I saw in the paper that you two had split, but I never believe anything the Prophet says anymore,” Draco shook his head. “According to them, I’m currently hiding out in the south of France from my father who has allegedly escaped Azkaban.” He shrugged as Potter laughed. “He was still there the last time I visited. That paper is useless.”
“I haven’t even shown it to you yet, Potter,” Draco chuckled as he watched Potter’s cheeks heat.
“Mum,” Ron rolled his eyes. He still seemed cross at Harry and was being a bit rude to everyone, his parents included. “They have house elves.”
“You look so beautiful,” Greg whispered in awe as he stared at Hermione.
“You’re kidding me, right?” Ron stared at him. “You can’t think of a single person that doesn’t like you?” He gestured dramatically across the room where several Slytherins were ignoring everyone else.
As if reading his thoughts, Harry said, “Ron is a bit miffed at me for not coming to the burrow so Hermione is trying to calm him down.” He shrugged like he wasn’t bothered, “Hermione is cautious, but thinks that it’s good that I’m making other friends. Ron is… Well, Ron is just Ron. I don’t know if he’ll ever come around, but I like hanging out with you so he’ll have to get over it. So, tell me what a Malfoy Christmas is like.”
“I… I don’t know,” Harry said, his voice soft and needy as Malfoy massaged him.
“To what exactly? My comfy bed, stealing my body heat, or me playing with your hair?” Draco teased.
“I was just looking,” he said, and then he saw it. The perfect gift for Draco. It was a simple ring with a small emerald set in a wide silver band.
“I know,” Harry said softly. “I promise, I’ll think about it.” And he did think about it. After Ron extinguished his lumos, he lay there in the dark, thinking about not being close to Draco after being so close the last couple of days. Ron was right, things were moving very fast, but it didn’t feel wrong. Harry closed his curtains before rolling over and snuggling up to his pillow. He could still smell Draco’s cologne on it as he drifted off to sleep.
Harry scowled at him because he was right. “Yea, ok. I like that we can’t lie to each other, but you should have told me.” He rolled his neck, feeling stiff around the area where Draco had sucked on his neck. “Oh my gods. Did you give me a hickey?”
“Yea, but then how do I explain the nightmares,” Harry murmured. “I thought Ginny was the one, you know. She’s just always been there for me.”
“I would like to be your friend,” Hermione said slowly, “But I don’t see why Ron would be off limits. He and I aren’t together so if you want to flirt with him, it’s fine.”
“I wouldn't have expected less, Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I was honestly surprised that you didn’t try to put up a fight in the Great Hall.”
“We have closer rooms to mine if you’d be more comfortable.”
“I’ll grab our swords,” Harry said quickly and excused himself to run upstairs.
He started to drift to sleep and thought he heard Draco mumble, “You’ll always have me,” but in his sleepy mind, he wasn’t quite sure.
“Oh, no you don’t,” Draco grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back. “Unlike your friends, I don’t care if your feelings are hurt. You won’t feel better until you talk about this, Potter.” He gave another tug and Potter gave up, slumping against him.
---------------Epilogue-------------------
Congratulations on finding yourself a job. Any job done with pride is a job worth doing. It’s good that you’ll be spending time with Harry, as well. Being around him will be good for your image and it may help him because I worry he’s lonelier in that big, old house than he admits. Please tell him I said hello.
He wouldn’t ordinarily have agreed to playing truth or dare, but he had been feeling particularly low earlier and Pansy had insisted.
The shock must have shown on his face because Draco was once again smirking at him. “I decided to make it a condition of our agreement that we can’t lie to each other. The magic that binds our contract will ensure that we always tell each other the truth.” He stood and attempted to straighten his clothing, then seemed to decide against it.
“Absolutely,” Draco said as he pulled him close.
“And you have a child?” Draco was so confused. What reality was he in currently?
“Yea, I can do that,” Draco said. “I live pretty close so it won’t take long.”
“Yea,” he answered, a small grin playing on his lips. “Thanks for lunch. It smells amazing.”
“It’s me,” Draco said, slipping quietly through the bed hangings. “I couldn’t sleep. Can I maybe… I mean, is it alright if I stay here?”
He knew exactly what Blaise was up to. He wanted to see Draco strip and wasn’t able to include himself in the dare so he suggested the one person that Draco wouldn’t back down from. But Draco absolutely would not perform a striptease in front of Blaise and everyone else. “Come on, Potter,” he rolled his eyes as he stood slowly. “I’d prefer to do this in private.”
“They didn’t treat me well,” Harry spoke softly. “I don’t talk about it much because I don’t want people to pity me.”
“You had best run along anyways,” Draco added. “We’ll be starting soon and it may get a little unpleasant for you to watch.” He shrugged off the scathing look she gave him and turned his attention back to Ron. “Who are you aiming for?”
“Exactly how long do you think we’ll be doing this?” Harry asked, confused as to how one fake date was turning into an entire relationship.
“Yes,” Harry moaned. “More, Please,” he begged. Draco slid out of him and gently rolled him onto his stomach. Pulling him up to his knees, he spread his ass cheeks apart and slid back inside.
He rolled his eyes as he snuggled under the blankets. “I only listened because I wanted to go to bed anyway.”
After arriving at the manor, they had tea with Narcissa before getting settled in. She seemed to like Harry well enough and proved that Draco was right by talking about her plans for a large dinner. When she left them to see to dinner preparations for that evening, Draco took Harry up to show him where he would be sleeping.
Draco laughed and stood with Potter. He tried to follow a step behind, but Teddy had other plans and took his hand, pulling him up to walk with them. They walked in the opposite direction of Pansy and Greg’s flat for a few blocks, the silence being broken occasionally as Teddy told Draco about things he liked to do.
Harry was stiff for a moment before pressing against him and kissing back. They clung to each other, barely breathing as they explored each other’s mouths. Hands started moving, gripping, and caressing as the kiss grew more heated. He slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, savoring the feeling of his warm skin. He had just started to inch his shirt up when a swift knocking drew his attention.
“I notice that Mr. Potter is staying in your room,” she spoke carefully. “Is there anything that you would like to tell me?” Her expression was carefully neutral.
“I can help, but the only way they can’t challenge me is if I claim you first,” Draco shrugged. “If you’re mine, no one can take you.”
“I didn’t want to bother you,” Harry mumbled. Speaking louder, he added, “I feel like I’ve been interrupting your reading since last night.”
Harry woke on his stomach, his face sticking slightly to Draco’s chest. He tried to adjust his position, but a strong arm held him in place. He looked up to find Draco watching him. “How long have you been awake?”
Harry opened the bed hangings and they both stood and were stretching when the door opened and Ron stepped into the room. He stared at Draco’s bare chest for a moment, shaking his head. “Please tell me that you didn’t do anything while I was in here.”
Harry smoothed his own suit jacket. He thought he looked damn good, as well. He had let the salesman talk him into a forest green suit with black trim and a black vest. His crisp white shirt provided a nice contrast between the suit and his tan skin. It was tailored to fit him perfectly, every line flattering him and making him look fit. Ron’s suit was essentially the opposite, being black with green trim that flattered his complexion.
“Not really,” Malfoy shrugged as he moved to lay next to Harry. “It’s hard to be alone after a bad one. Having another person near helps.”
“I just wanted to make sure everyone made it out,” she said, blushing a bit. As Theo stumbled out of the exit, her eyes lit up before her face grew angry.
“I don’t want you to stop,” Harry said, tilting his head to the side to give him better access.
“You have feelings for me?” Draco asked softly.
“Fuck,” Draco groaned. “It’s more than alright, Potter.”
“Ginny,” Blaise called over his shoulder as he bolted up the hall.
“I disagree,” Draco sneered. He braced himself and started firing hexes and curses at her, narrowly avoiding the ones she sent his way. She lost her temper and ran at him, turning from magic to a physical fight. Draco swiftly sidestepped her and used her own momentum to flip her onto her back. A quick kick to the head and she was out. “I hope Ron isn't mad about that,” he shrugged as he walked away from her. Turning to Harry, he saw him cowering away with his wand in front of him.
“I didn’t know you were into blokes, Harry,” Dean added.
“That’s all well and good, my darling boy,” she stepped closer and reached up to cup his face. “You’ve gotten so tall,” she said wistfully. “I suppose my actual question is do you like him? Yes, I know he’s your friend now, but is he more than that?”
“Yea, I think so,” Ron shrugged. “His curtains were closed and I heard him mumbling a bit last night so I’m guessing he didn’t sleep well.”
“I fail to see why that’s an issue worth hiding from,” Draco said, rolling onto his back and crossing his ankles. “It’s the second time the two of you split, if I’m not mistaken. Why is this time so terribly depressing?”
“I personally think that our dates are very lucky to have us,” Harry grinned at his reflection, feeling more confident than usual.
Their school week passed by much the same. Draco walked Harry to classes, helped him study, and took most meals with him. The whispers had mostly stopped after the Daily Prophet ran the article Wilkes had written, even though the Patil twins and Lavender were doing their best to keep the rumours going. About halfway through the week, Draco received a letter from his mother reprimanding him for not telling her about Harry and making her read about it in the Prophet. She didn’t seem overly mad, just mostly curious as to when he’d bring Harry for dinner.
The next morning, Draco was slightly confused when he woke up. It took him several minutes to remember where he was and why he wasn’t on Pansy and Greg’s lumpy couch. Once he woke fully, he stretched out taking advantage of the spacious bed.
Draco cast a quick incarcerous at Ginny to ensure that she wasn’t a threat if she woke up. He turned back to Harry and slowly used the few healing spells he knew to heal his eye and lip. He caressed his jaw when he was done. “It’s not perfect, but it shouldn’t hurt as much now. Are you alright?”
Things were awkward for a short while as everyone started to arrive. Blaise and Pansy stood away from The Weasley’s looking a bit uncomfortable as Harry was being hugged. The Weasley family, to their credit, was doing their best to act as if it wasn’t unusual to be invited to Malfoy Manor.
“He doesn’t have a fated mate. It’s pretty rare from what my mother has said.” Malfoy wrapped an arm around his shoulders as they grew closer to the main section of the school. “Be prepared. The other alphas won’t be able to affect you since I’ve claimed you, but that might not stop them from trying.”
I do hope you’ll come visit with Harry on Sunday when we have tea.
“Going to sleep,” he muttered before stretching. “Hermione’s in my bed and the other rooms are occupied.”
When Harry was finished, it took Draco less time than usual to shower and get through his evening routine. When he stepped out of the bathroom, Harry was sitting in the middle of the bed, reading the book Hermione had gotten him.
Harry had to swallow the lump in his throat before he could respond, “What exactly would you consider to be a proper thank you?”
Harry breathed deeply, taking in as much of Malfoy’s scent as he could. “I don’t want to die again,” Harry mumbled against his chest.
“Um, yea. I promise,” Hermione smiled at her. She wondered briefly if this was how other girls acted or if it was a Slytherin thing.
He put a hand up trying to feel the magic and was surprised when his hand went through. “Very tricky, Harry,” he whispered as he stepped through the glamour. He found himself on another path and could hear fighting that he hadn’t heard before. Harry’s scent was much stronger, but there was someone else. He ran as fast as he could, hoping he got there in time. As he rounded a corner, he entered a clearing and found Harry trying to fight off Ron’s sister.
As Harry grabbed his clothes and opened the door to the loo, Ron flopped onto his bed and called out, “Let me know when the wedding is so I can get a date.”
Harry woke the next morning, trying to remember why he had to be awake this early on a Saturday. He had been looking forward to having a lazy day and had even shut his bed hangings to block out the morning sun. So why was Ron knocking around and making so much noise?
-------------------------
Harry looked unsure for a moment, but his wand slowly lowered. “I suppose that’s alright.”
Sunday was much the same, the difference being that Pansy was practically clinging to Ron when she wasn’t talking to Hermione. He had asked her to the Yule Ball and she was ecstatic. She had decided to make it her mission to get Hermione a date.
“I don’t want to fight anymore,” he said, his hand shaking a bit.
Harry was quiet for several minutes as he considered what Malfoy had said. “First you’re bossy. Now you’re wise,” Harry mumbled, gaining a chuckle from Malfoy. “What happened to the git that wanted to argue all the time?”
Hope to see you soon.
“If you even attempt it, Ronald Weasley, I’ll hex you until you wish you were dead,” she hissed. He put his hands up and stepped away.
“I don’t need a lesson, Malfoy,” Harry growled.
“I’m in a different corridor,” Draco shrugged. “Would you like to see it?” When Harry nodded, Draco led him down the hall and up a different corridor. He opened a large door and showed Harry into his bedroom.
“Yea,” Harry added, rolling his eyes. “We shouldn’t have hidden it in the first place.”
“From Harry or from these other so-called alphas?” Draco laughed while Ron shook his head. “I’ll fight every single alpha here as many times as I have to.”
“Yes, unfortunately,” Hermione agreed, her eyes going wide and causing Malfoy to chuckle. She was about to say something else when several Slytherins walked over.
Draco lost track of time as Potter devoured him. His fingers curled into his messy hair, holding on as his soul was sucked from his body in the best way possible. As he grew close, he tried to pull away again. “Potter,” he growled through clenched teeth. “I’m going to cum.” Potter just held him tighter and gripped his balls lightly, playing with them until he tipped over the edge. His legs shook as he came. Gripping Potter’s hair, he flicked his hips, fucking his face as jets of hot cum hit the back of his throat.
“That’s a loaded question, Harry,” Draco groaned as he sat up, pulling him into his lap. Harry blushed furiously as he realised what he had asked. “Don’t worry, darling. I’m patient.” He kissed him quickly before letting him go.
“We didn’t do anything but sleep, Weasley,” Draco rolled his eyes. “Two people can share a bed without fucking like rabbits, you know.” He pulled his jumper over his head, pulling Harry into a quick hug, he asked, “Do you want to get breakfast before we go see Hagrid?”
It took them some time to get to the Great Hall since they had to be mindful of the stairs because of the girls' dresses and shoes. After Hermione almost tripped, Greg picked her up, ignored her squeals of protest and carried her to the main hall. When they finally entered the Great Hall, they were met with a huge transformation. It looked similar to the first Yule Ball, but better in Harry’s opinion. Tables pushed to the sides creating a huge dance floor, Christmas trees in every corner. The Weird Sisters were already playing and people had started dancing and were laughing and having fun.
-------------------------------------------
“Everyone that is hunting, please listen carefully. You may use physical or magical means to fight and attempt to catch an omega. You may not cause permanent damage to any omega. You may not cause permanent damage or death to any opposing alpha. If you concede in any fight, you will be removed and you will have to wait until the next hunt to prove yourself. Does anyone have any questions?” He looked around at all of them. “The exit paths are clearly marked. If you become lost, send up yellow sparks and someone will come along to retrieve you. The edges of the hunting grounds are also clearly marked and magical barriers have been erected to ensure that no one is hit with friendly fire. You have two minutes to prepare yourselves.”
“If you can be respectful,” Draco called back.
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” she agreed. “It took me awhile to settle in, but I slept well once I did.”
“You were screaming and trying to grab at something,” Malfoy’s voice was soft and he actually looked a little worried.
Malfoy nodded, “I think that’s reasonable. I agree.” He leaned in quickly and pressed his lips to Harry’s, wrapping his hand around the back of Harry’s neck to hold him in place.
“Everything alright?” Draco asked as he looked at Harry.
“Ginny dumped me,” he sighed.
Draco growled as he pulled away from him, “We can easily fix that.” He pulled his shirt off and tossed it away from the bed. “Touch me anywhere you like,” he murmured as he started kissing Harry’s neck again. He shuddered as warm hands slid over his back and chest, slowly at first. Exploring his body gently then more roughly as he gripped him tighter. He groaned as Harry’s thumbs flicked across his nipples, drawing them to small peaks.
“I won the Slytherin pot,” Blaise grinned. “What?” he scoffed at the face Draco made. “They’re not wrong. The two of you have been obsessed with each other since first year.”
She had a beanie pulled over her curly hair and looked a bit too warm with her scarf around her neck. “Harry,” she started quietly, “I wanted to make sure you’re alright. It’s nice to be getting along with Draco and his friends, but I want to make sure he’s not doing anything you don’t like.”
Draco wasn’t surprised at all when they were paired together as sparring partners. They quickly learned to move with each other and were often used by the professor to show the other students proper technique. Professor Williams also agreed to allow them to use their wooden practice swords outside of her classroom, as long as they were outside. Because of this, it wasn’t uncommon to see Draco and Potter practising by the lake after they were finished with their classwork. Other students would often gather to watch, but as it grew closer to Christmas and colder outside, the crowds grew thinner and thinner until it was just the two of them.
Harry stood and walked over to stare out the window. “I hate to admit it, but you have a point.”
Draco pulled away slowly, grinning at the glazed look in Harry’s eyes. “Let’s get you to bed,” he said softly and walked Harry to his room. He gave him another quick peck on the lips and sent a very confused Harry into his room.
“This is more than alright,” Draco grinned and closed the distance between their lips. He gripped Harry’s hips and pulled him closer before sliding a hand up his back, under his shirt. He was again surprised at how warm his skin was. He leaned forward, kissing down Harry’s neck, enjoying the little gasps that he made as soft lips brushed his skin. As he neared his collarbone, he leaned away long enough to pull Harry’s shirt over his head. Moving back in, he once again captured Harry’s lips while his hands explored the smooth expanse of skin he had revealed.
“Is Harry still sleeping?” Hermione asked as he sat down.
Draco pulled Harry close and kissed him. It was firm and quick, but that one kiss spoke volumes. “I love you, too Harry,” he whispered against his lips before kissing him more thoroughly.
“I’ve honestly never really thought about it,” Draco shrugged. “My life used to be planned out. Where I went to school, what my job would be, who I would marry. No one ever asked me. And then after everything that happened, I was just so thankful to be alive and not in Azkaban that I didn’t worry about any of it. Now, I can’t even support myself. Let alone a family.” Potter nodded as if he understood, silent as he waited for Draco to continue. Draco took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Right now, I just want to be useful. To feel like I’m needed. I haven’t really thought too far beyond that.”
Harry moaned into his mouth as he pressed up against him, trying to get closer. He wanted to take Draco’s shirt off and was just about to when the bedroom door opened.
“Don’t get mad, Weasley,” Blaise said, immediately standing and backing away slowly. “Just know that she asked me.”
“The same could be said for you, Potter.”
“They weren’t shagging yet, but I think if I hadn’t interrupted, they would have been,” he scrubbed his hands over his eyes as if trying to get rid of the memory. “That’s why I talked to Harry last night. Apparent;y, he’s decided not to take my advice.”
Potter rolled his eyes and turned away, motioning for Draco to follow him. They stepped into the corridor and Potter looked around to make sure they were alone. “I’ve figured something out and I need your help.”
“Yes,” he grinned. “I would. Thank you.” He made arrangements to have it wrapped and delivered. He had barely finished when Draco came over with a tea set in hand that had hand painted flowers on it.
“Calm down, Weasel,” Draco rolled his eyes. “It’s new and today isn’t about us.” He stepped over to give Hermione a hug, “Congratulations. I know how hard you’ve worked for this.”
“Well, you at least came to the right person because I don’t particularly like you at all,” Malfoy muttered.
“Oh,” Harry brushed his thumb across the scars on Draco’s chest, making him shiver slightly. “You should have woke me.”
“Yea,” Harry said, his voice a bit muffled against Draco’s chest. “Let’s go.”
She smiled lovingly as she watched Harry and Draco open treats, clothing, and books. She had even gotten Harry a new winter cloak. When he tried to say that it was all too much, she held up a delicate hand, “I’ve always loved doting on my son, but I wasn’t fortunate enough to have more children to spoil so you would do me a great kindness in accepting these gifts.”
The fourth floor only had two bedrooms. Potter explained that one had been his godfather’s and the other belonged to Sirius’ younger brother. They seemed to be in better shape than most of the other rooms even though they were also covered in a layer of dust.
“Yes, I’m aware,” Malfoy smirked. “But you like it.” He leaned close to Harry’s ear and whispered, “Or at least you liked it when we were alone.” Harry blushed furiously, drawing an odd look from Ron and adding to the rumor mill that had already started.
“Yes,” Hermione looked a little excited. “I don’t really have friends that are girls. I’m looking forward to getting ready with her. Is that pathetic?”
They had kept in touch through owl posts after Harry had spoken at his trials. Exchanging simple greetings and well wishes. Congratulations on nuptials and the births of their children. Birthday greetings and the like. The letters had caused them to form a timid friendship and with time they began to divulge more about their daily lives, likes and dislikes, opinions on the Ministry staff and the political climate. Their timid friendship grew stronger and they started actually meeting. Sometimes to let the children play, sometimes just for a pint. Short visits turned into weekend camping trips and planned holidays, much to the dismay of a certain weasel.
“Noooo!” Harry screamed as Sirius’ fingers slipped through his once again. He was reaching, straining to get to him, but he just couldn’t and had to watch as he was pulled away from him once more.
Harry ran a hand through his hair as his cheeks heated. He hoped it was dark enough that Malfoy didn’t notice. “What if I am ready?”
“Yea, alright,” Harry murmured, feeling awkward. He crossed the room and stopped just inside the bedroom. “There’s only one bed.”
“Give us a kiss then,” Blaise laughed. They apparently found themselves to be hilarious.
“I have an idea, but I don’t know if you’ll like it,” Draco spoke softly. Harry looked at him expectantly. “Christmas break starts in a few days. You could always come to the manor with me. It’s just me and my mother. And the elves of course. But the manor is huge so we’d have plenty of space and privacy.” Second guessing himself, he added, “Or we could find somewhere here and just stay at Hogwart’s if that makes you more comfortable.”
“I have you now though,” Harry whispered against his chest, a yawn leaving his lips shortly after.
“Not interested in dating or in girls?”
Unfortunately for Harry, Ron had been right and Harry had just presented as omega in the Great Hall, in front of the entire school. Hermione had thrown up several spells to distract everyone while Harry ran. His current concern was that he wouldn’t make it to the seventh floor. He had barely made it to the second and was worried that he might pass out. As his pursuers grew closer, he realized that he had another option. He pushed himself and ran into the girl’s lavatory.
They sat together talking about classes and NEWTS until the common room emptied. “Are you going to tell us what’s actually going on?” Parkinson asked Malfoy.
Draco sighed, “Unfortunately, no.” He kept playing with Harry’s hair, causing him to feel relaxed and sleepy again.
“I’m so confused,” Hermione said, shaking her head while Ron laughed across the table.
“You have to go through the bedroom to get to the loo,” Malfoy said without looking up from the book in his lap. “It’s small, but the water pressure is good.”
“Sorry if I got a bit carried away,” Potter blushed as Draco pulled him into a hug.
“Good news, Malfoy,” Ron grinned. “Harry lost a bet when you agreed to play so now he owes us both one favor.”
“Can I help you?” a woman asked softly. Harry looked up surprised to see that she wasn’t much older than him.
Harry hugged him tightly and kissed him. “I want it, too. I want it to be real, too.”
Draco shrugged, “Ron already thinks we’re together. I’ve caught him checking my room to see if my stuff is still in there. He’s been suspicious since I moved in.”
-------------------------
“It could still exist, Potter,” Draco shrugged. “It just might exist with someone else.”
Potter’s hands were shaking as he gripped the waistband of Draco’s trousers, but he undid the button and zipper easily enough. As he shoved them over Draco’s hips and ass, he took Draco’s underpants with them releasing his now rigid cock. He lowered himself to his knees as he pulled the clothing to the floor. “Is this alright?” he asked as he leaned forward to lick the head of Draco’s prick.
“Of Human Bondage,” he answered as he stroked Harry’s hair. He leaned down and kissed his forehead before telling Harry about the book.
“That look you’re giving me is why no one will ask you,” Blaise said, ducking as a pillow flew at his head.
“Yea,” Harry squeezed her hand. “We’ll see.” They left his room and headed to the common room to wait for everyone else. “So you and Pansy are going to be friends?”
“You really don’t know anything about your family do you,” Narcissa said softly, placing her hand on Harry’s knee. “Before you go back to school, I want to show you some books in the library. The Potter’s are one of the oldest family’s. We have books on all of the 28. I’m sure there’s something in there.” She squeezed his knee lightly, “Would you like to open the gifts from me now?”
“Yea,” he nodded. “I’d really like to.”
He had to stop losing focus so easily. “Just thinking about something the Weasel said,” Draco shrugged. “Are you ready to go?” When Harry nodded, he held his arm out. Harry gripped it firmly and they apparated home. Bixby met them at the door and took their cloaks informing them that the drawing room was ready. Draco went in, picked up his scotch and stood before the mantle, glaring into the fireplace.
Harry pushed him further into the pillows and started kissing down his neck, stopping briefly to suck on his ear lobe. He bit lightly into Draco’s shoulder, kissing it before moving lower to run his tongue around his nipple. He flicked his tongue against the tight little peak and sucked again, drawing a moaning sigh from Draco’s lips. When he moved again, his ass brushed against Draco’s growing erection, causing him to hiss. “Did I hurt you?” Harry asked as he tried to move away.
The shorts were a bit long, but thankfully had a drawstring so Harry was able to keep them pulled up. The jumper on the other hand was quite large. It hung off of one of Harry’s shoulders and the sleeves were too long, but it was so soft that he couldn’t be bothered to care. He slipped out of the bedroom quietly, not wanting to disturb Malfoy’s reading yet again since he had been nice enough to give him some dry clothing. He was mildly surprised to find that he was in the small kitchenette.
They lay together for a while, Harry wasn’t sure how long. Malfoy licked the bite on his neck to speed the healing. He finally lifted himself off of Harry’s chest and slowly pulled out of him. “Are you alright?” he asked, gently pulling him to his feet.
After turning up a side street and into what looked to be just another Muggle neighborhood, Potter leaned towards Draco and said, “Harry Potter lives at Number 12, Grimmauld Place.”
Hermione caught Harry’s eye and looked to the side. He glanced to see Lavender and Parvati listening in. “I wish you had told us you weren’t going to keep your relationship a secret any longer,” Hermione said, still glancing subtly at the eavesdroppers. “We wouldn’t have been so surprised.”
“Why would anyone be afraid of me?” Hermione asked, looking offended.
“I won’t,” Harry promised. “So do you want dinner?”
He stepped into Draco’s arms without hesitation. “Thank you,” he mumbled against his chest. “I suppose I should get in the shower,” he said as he pulled away. “I forgot my shirt in here.”
“Well, I mean it was fairly obvious,” he chuckled. “You two’ve been staring at each other and showing off for each other since we were in first year. We were taking bets on how long it’d be before you ended up together.”
When they entered holding hands, she grinned up at them, “Do you want to open presents before we have breakfast?”
He sighed dramatically as he stood and walked away from his friends. He received a few curious glances as he crossed the room into the corner that the Slytherins had claimed for themselves. He was used to getting looks so he ignored everyone until he stopped in front of Malfoy.
“Sorry, Myrtle,” Harry muttered. “I can’t stay.” He said ‘open’ in Parseltongue and nearly collapsed in relief as the tap moved into the floor, revealing the tunnel to the Chamber of Secrets. He quickly slid into the tunnel, hoping it closed before anyone could follow him.
“Teddy is my godson,” Potter looked at the slides and smiled as he watched the little boy play. “He’s Remus and Tonks’ little boy. His grandmother is your mother’s sister.”
“This is by far the most unromantic proposal I have ever received,” Malfoy scoffed, shaking his head. “What do I get if I agree?”
“This was a great idea,” Mrs. Weasley said to Narcissa as they entered the drawing room after dinner.
“Yea, because that’s so much fun,” Ron rolled his eyes before ignoring her. “Just one match, Harry. I might die of boredom otherwise.”
“It’s alright,” Harry shrugged. “I was enjoying spending time with you,” he added, causing his cheeks to heat. “I’ve never spent time with anyone like that. Just laying together. It was nice.”
“I guess tonight I didn’t?”
Ron grabbed his wand and cast a quick lumos before turning in his bed to face Harry. “Are you sure your relationship with Malfoy is fake? Because honestly, mate, it didn’t look fake earlier.”
Harry pulled away and stared up at him again. “Are you sure that’ll work?”
After breakfast, Narcissa had her personal elf see to warding the room. She also added a charm so that if someone else entered the space an alarm would sound. “Draco, might I have a word?” she asked when she had approved of the spell work her elf had used.
As he finally settled himself, Malfoy placed a tea tray on the table in front of the sofa and handed him a steaming mug of tea. “It’s nothing fancy,” he shrugged as Harry took the mug. “Just chamomile.”
Harry scowled up at him, an idea forming in his mind. He reached out and grabbed Malfoy’s shirt, pulling him in quickly and pressing their lips together again. He was surprised when instead of being shoved away, he was pulled closer. A hand landed on his hip, holding him in place while Malfoy kissed him aggressively. He pulled away suddenly, leaving Harry panting for breath and swaying slightly.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Staying here isn’t a good idea. If something went wrong, someone could get hurt. If we’re at the manor, your mother and the elves could help if a spell misfires. It’s a good idea. She won’t mind if I’m there for Christmas?”
They both greeted her and sat, Harry adding, “You can call me Harry, if you like.”
Harry glared up at him. Shaking his head, he smiled at the absurdity of it all. A lot of things would be different now, but looking at the sneer that seemed to be permanently affixed to Draco’s face he realised that some things would always be the same.
“Go to mine, if you don’t mind,” Draco said when Potter stopped at his own bedroom. “I have a radio.” Potter just shook his head before walking to the end of the corridor.
Pansy pulled him into a tight hug. “Just know you always have a home wherever I am. And if you don’t come visit on your days off, I’ll hunt you down.”
“Oh, no,” Ron muttered. “I might know where he is.”
“Actually, I can and I did,” Draco shrugged. “You see, darling, I told you I was better at these things. We never agreed that we couldn’t add more conditions to our arrangement. I would have thought you’d be pleased to know that I couldn’t lie to you.”
This chapter has smexy bits. If you don't want to read it, stop at the suggested line.
“I don’t think so,” Harry said, meaning it. “I don’t think she really has girl friends either. I’ve only ever really seen her spend time with Draco and his friends.” He stopped talking as Draco entered the room, blushing a bit as he was pulled into a hug.
“And what makes you think he’ll listen to you, you eavesdropping Ferret,” Weasley blustered.
“It’s ok,” Harry whispered. He was still for a moment before turning over to face Draco. “I think this is better though,” he gave him a little shove so that Draco was on his back. Resting his head on his shoulder, he laid his arm across his chest.
“You’re an ass,” huffed Harry.
“Hi,” Teddy said as he waved. “Can I go slide?” he asked Potter.
“Are you insane?” Harry almost yelled as several people passing by had stopped to watch. “He’s my boyfriend and we’re just trying to do some Christmas shopping. If you had bothered to do your job, you’d know that I can’t be influenced by the Imperious Curse. And quite frankly…”
“Oh, I would love to go,” Hermione grinned. “Thank you for thinking of me.” They both gave Ron their food orders before returning to their conversation.
Draco couldn’t help but to be intrigued. What could possibly have Potter needing his help. “What exactly have you figured out?”
-----------------------------
As Harry opened his mouth to respond, Draco walked into the kitchen. “There you are, darling,” he beamed at Harry. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you. Ron ate the last of the mini quiches and I didn’t know if you’d had Kreacher make anymore.” He cupped Harry’s face and kissed his forehead before addressing Molly. “Are you enjoying the party, Mrs. Weasley?”
“I already know you’re an ass so I doubt that would mess us up,” Harry grinned. He went quiet for a minute before saying, “I honestly don’t why I want to learn this. At first, with just the sword play, it was to be better than you,” he chuckled. “Then when I cast a spell, it was just so awesome that I wanted to learn more. Now, I’m not so sure. I like doing it, but I feel like it’s becoming an obsession instead of a hobby.”
“You don’t seem like you want space,” Malfoy chuckled as he looked down at him.
Draco was a bit more difficult. He watched as he looked at different things, nothing seeming to hold his interest for too long. The only thing he looked at for longer than a moment was a silver tea set, but he mentioned that his mother might like that. Harry was quickly losing hope as to what to get him and he had to get him something. He had picked out a fancy new quill, a grey cashmere scarf that matched his eyes, arranged to have personalized stationery made, but none of that seemed personal enough. Yes, Draco wasn’t actually his boyfriend, but the gift had to be personal enough to look like it was special. What did you get someone that already had everything they wanted?
“How sure—” Draco paused, still so quiet, Harry could barely hear him. “I’ve worked so hard for this, to have you in my life, Harry, your friendship means—” he swallowed, “—it means more to me than anything. I can’t— I can’t lose you.”
From Big Sur they kept north, heading to San Francisco, where they spent three days before their return portkey to England. On the first night, the sky was lit up with fireworks over the Golden Gate Bridge, and a drunk woman on the street stumbled into Draco and slurred at him that they were celebrating their victory over the Brits. Draco drew himself up to his full height and very politely told her to fuck right off into the sea, Harry tugging him away and snickering. During the days they walked the steep hills of the city, narrow wooden houses brightly painted, tall and thin and stacked close together. They rode the quaint-looking cable cars and poked around head shops and ate artisanal vegetarian food. Draco took Harry to the Haight-Ashbury, where the hippies and queers had held court, making way for Harry and Draco to show up on their streets decades later, intact, at ease.
