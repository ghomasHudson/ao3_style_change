The other Gryffindor boys were already in their beds, though some were still whispering to each other, when Scorpius slipped into the trunk to meet his father.
There were potions, he knew, that could change the way his son looked permanently, that could make him unrecognizable, and maybe protect him from the consequences of being his son. But they all required highly restricted ingredients. And a selfish part of him protested at the mere thought. Scorpius was
“His name’s Scorpius Black,” Mortimer Bone, the Hufflepuff Prefect informed him. “Which you should know since he’s probably related to you.”
Harry squinted at Sirius. It wasn’t like him to speak in euphemisms. “You mean they have to protect me if…
It wasn’t officially sanctioned, meaning all the staff—barring Umbridge—knew about it, and pretended to be busy elsewhere, even helpfully dragging the toad with them. Harry imagined it would be the perfect time for Death Eaters to attack the castle in full strength, but he saw a group of seventh year Slytherins enthusiastically playing a drinking game that seemed to involve snogging each other, so maybe not. (Also, despite celebrating England’s win, the Scots and Irish were present. Because alcohol.)
Still, the fear was just a feeling. And sometimes, Scorpius could ignore that feeling.
The sorting hat’s brim covered his eyes, and he waited, legs swinging, mind utterly empty.
Malfoy’s back went stiff. “We both know that night was…”
Harry’s brows were drawn together. He remembered Teddy’s story about meeting a friend in the attic. He also remembered the way Kreacher had stilled, eyes blinking, before saying, “You is having too much sweets at night Young Master Teddy. That sounds like a good dream.”
Sirius who had been
And then Kreacher brought him to the edge of a public park. There were some metal structures, with other kids running and jumping and sliding and doing all sorts of things. Scorpius hung back a little, just watching, until he felt Kreacher’s invisible nudge. He took a deep breath and marched towards the group. He climbed one structure and slid down the other side, and the feeling was like when Father taught him flying lessons. It was over too fast, though, so he did it again. Soon he was laughing and talking to the other kids around him.
“Stop that right now, Frederick Weasley!” She said through gritted teeth and tried to kick his shin.
Scorpius grew up surrounded by magical objects, but most of them were old, and the spells upon them had long since faded. Father’s layer of new spells was mostly for protection; he rarely bothered to refresh the charm of an old music box, for instance. The one mirror they had showed him various angles of his reflection on command but was otherwise silent, and the snake-headed spigot in the tub only gave a soft hiss when he took extra long in his bath.
Harry knew better than to avoid her gaze, but he kept his face expressionless. “They look smaller than I remember.”
, he wrote, then almost leaving a blot when he could not find the words to continue. He had been spending almost every night after dinner telling his father about his classes. What else was there to say?
“Alright.” Harry gave in.
On Better Days, his father would take him flying around the limits of their yard, which seemed to shrink every year. Sometimes, there were dancing lessons, which he pretended to hate, but secretly loved.
Between the exams and dozens of wedding preparations, tensions were at an all-time high. There were class notes, catalogues and cloth samples all over the common room, and some witches got into hair-pulling fights over dress designs. Or borrowed notes.
He didn’t really notice the movement in the grass, until Draco raised his hand, wand at ready.
He had gotten a little too reckless on a job three years ago and landed himself at St. Mungo’s with a curse that took time to heal up. After that, the Ministry pushed through his appointment as Head Auror when he had been too groggy to say nay. The job was three-parts glad-handling the press, and one-part making his case to the higher-ups for more resources, and two-parts knocking Aurors’ heads together for making foolish mistakes. He had hated it with a passion, and he only realized it when the words in McGonagall’s letter reminded him that he had other options.
It was Snape who cleared his throat and answered him. “Children are rare enough in our society that the mere idea of wilful termination is highly taboo. Please don’t mention it again.”
Their first session was on listing the rules of expected behaviour, and on naming tools that they will come to use. None of them felt magical in Scorpius’ hands.
Scorpius blinked up at him. “Teddy?”
Harry shrugged. “You can have mine.” Ron frowned at the implied charity so Harry continued hastily. “I’m pretty sure Malfoy is sending me something to wear.” He gestured at the invitation. “He already planned everything else.”
Kreacher shrugged. “The land’s gone to magic, so it won’t be the safest for muggles to let.”
Scorpius clapped politely for each student’s turn, though he was a little more enthusiastic when Dominique got sorted into Slytherin, and Lucy into Gryffindor with him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Scorpius laid his ear against his father’s chest, listening to the quick staccato of his heartbeat.
back. But that’s because nobody
Harry was still mending from the depletion of his magical core, but the mediwitch said he needed some movement, so after the grave visit, he walked slowly around the grounds of Malfoy Manor, arm tucked in Draco’s elbow. Their position would have irritated him at any other time, but he was too tired to care.
The house-elves prepared a meal for him, which he ate out in the garden. It was well-tended, and smelled of rue and yarrow, but beyond its careful hedges, he had a view of rolling hills that were wilder, filled with tall grasses and gnarled trees.
One night, shortly after Scorpius turned eight, his father was feeling under the weather and spent the day in bed. He was too weak to do his routine spells and even in sleep, Scorpius could read his father’s anxiety, so he thought he could do them instead. He slid Father’s wand out of his sleeve. The spells he had heard most often were song-like and he sort of knew the words, though he wasn’t that familiar with the wand movements. He walked clockwise in his father’s large steps and he repeated what he remembered, and when he reached the spot he started from, something felt different, so whatever it was must have worked.
“But those who were Death Eaters before would still follow Voldemort,” Hermione pointed out.
Every time he walked into a classroom, it was with bated breath, at least until he found Lucy—and sometimes Dominique—there as well. He had done his best to listen quietly and take notes and not draw anyone’s attention to himself. Even so, he felt eyes on him in this or that class, which made him want to fidget.
Harry stuck out his tongue at her, but he did grab his book bag to rummage through it for his notes.
Scorpius froze for a second, before Kreacher tugged at his sleeve.
Harry sighed. “I’m sure Sirius is doing a good job. But. I’m more concerned about your thoughts on all this.” He waved at the air between them.
“Yes!” The other boy practically shouted. “And your name’s Scorpius Black. Did you know I’m also a Black? Well my grand-mum was born a Black, but my last name’s Lupin, on account of my dad actually marrying my mum a few days before I was born, or else I’d be a Tonks, which is from my grand-da. So anyway, that means we’re related, probably. Maybe I’ll call you Cousin Scorpius! That has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?”
“What?” Harry’s jaw dropped. “W-why?”
Scorpius shook his head, not sure what to think.
But he stopped himself from beaming. After all, what right did he have to be proud?
At the margins, in smaller writing:
The creature straightened, face already shifting back to its previous features, though with green hair that matched its eyes. “My name is Teddy. I’m a metamorphmagus.”
The epidemic started a couple of months after.
There weren’t as many Death Eaters found on the grounds as they expected. There weren’t as many casualties either, although they never did find Great Aunt Mildred’s body. Instead, Draco found his father by the manor gates. Dead, with no mark upon him, though a spell revealed traces of the Imperio spell used upon him. Draco and his mother buried him in the family crypt.
All through potions, which they shared with the Slytherins, Harry let that word float in his head. Family. He had always wanted a family like Ron’s. A family of his own. Now Sirius was free. And he would have a child of his own… and Draco Malfoy would be
Harry took him for a walk around the grounds one afternoon, and discovered four kneazles following him and his enchanted bassinet around. A family of snidgets started roosting on a branch closest to the nursery. They liked to fly inside his window and hover over his crib.
Draco must have shouted it, but he couldn’t hear a word above the pounding of his own heart. He stepped forward, trying to intercept his mad aunt’s killing curse.
Still it felt like a kick to the ribs.
He and Ron made up before the wedding. But his best friend was still unhappy about it.
He was bursting with stories when he got back home, and Father had baked him a cake with frosting. It was a Good Day.
Harry aborted the nod as soon as he started to feel woozy. He wasn’t exactly listening. A fact that he will later regret.
“Never again…” Father was murmuring. “Don’t you ever…”
Harry shook his head in denial. “What if I don’t want to keep it?”
He flipped the pages toward the most recent entries and groaned at the tangle of entries, a great number of them about
More and more people had boarded the train, and it soon pulled away from the station. Ceres was demanding ear scritches, and Scorpius was obliging her, so he didn’t immediately notice the door to his carriage open.
Draco laughed, kissing his son on his forehead. “Maybe you should, little one.”
“The hat knows you better than you know yourself,” Draco said, though he could see it would take more than his words to convince his son.
Jagged pain pounded behind his eyeballs. For a second, Harry thought that he was under attack, and his hand instinctively reached for his wand, but it found someone else’s wand. Someone else’s thicker, warmer, and not-at-all-wooden wand.
This was such a bitch to write. I had writer's block for a while because I just couldn't face my own outline--which is probably a sign that the plot needed changing! Thank you for the kudos and the comments!
“The Blacks used to have muggle tenants, farmers, but not in the last century or so,” Kreacher explained. “There’s a muggle village close by, but relations are…
When she left the carriage, Dominique made a face. “Isn’t she
The house-elves had changed the menu ever since word got out. Harry bit through the cucumber in his salad and his gaze hovered over the inhabitants of the table across. He looked away before he could catch anyone’s eyes.
“You can make things up,” Scorpius told his father with exaggerated forbearance. “It’s not that hard.”
Harry had to read
She patted his hand. “Call me Minerva.” When he gaped at her, she laughed. “Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it eventually.”
between the lines to get that. “Are you asking me if I’m getting morning sickness?”
But now that he knew, Scorpius could not help but wonder about that world. He had a lot of questions that his father could not answer. Kreacher was sent out for more books, this time muggle ones with brightly-coloured covers, and funny pictures that didn’t move.
Harry grimaced, partly at the thought of his Aunt Petunia learning about what had happened, and partly at the realization that this was going to be part of his tasks for this year. Surely it wouldn’t be so bad? Hogwarts had never felt quite that safe to him, but the war was over, so such incidents should be far behind them.
I wrote the first two chapters ages ago, and was in the mood to leave it at that for the longest time (with some domestic!Draco fantasies) so the chapters after this might be very different in feel... and the story has grown a little bigger than I intended.
Anyone else feeling ambivalent about hp fanfic right now? I still want to get this done, but we'll see how I feel after. Also, I have chapter four plotted out, but chapter five is a big question mark. Why am I writing romance anyway? lol. Please ignore my existential crisis...
It circled the room once before flying out the open trunk lid. Draco peered through it, heart pounding, but all he could see was the carved ceiling of his son’s canopy bed. He walked up the stairs, hand too tight on the railing, and a few steps below, he reached out to close the lid with a too-loud thud. Then he sat down a little too fast on the step, his knees shaking.
“Is war coming?” Ron asked idly. Hermione and Harry turned to gape at him. Ron scratched his head. “I mean, I know
Draco felt his shoulders relax a fraction. “Hello, darling,” he whispered.
Hermione slapped his arm—lightly! And grabbed the roll. “I’ll go through it and give you a summary.”
“Her name’s Ceres,” Scorpius offered shyly, relaxing a fraction.
The strange boy didn’t show up in the attic the next night. Nor the night after that. Teddy almost thought he had dreamed the whole thing up, but he couldn’t find the yo-yo that was a present from Grandpa Weasley.
“Is there anything you need, Harry?” Malfoy asked, voice pitched low, although everybody in the room heard him.
Father had taught him the feather-light charm, but Scorpius didn’t dare use it on the trunk. He didn’t trust himself to mess the spell up, so he used a trolley at the station. Ceres obliged by perching quietly on top. His cat looked very different from the creature he had met a year before. Her brown-red fur was sleek and shiny, though she still had a bushy tail and a perpetually grouchy expression.
“It’s a muggle toy,” Teddy answered, stepping forward and ignoring the wand Scorpius was still pointing in his direction. “I can teach you.” Then he slipped a finger into the looped end of the string and snapped his wrist. The toy rolled down and up, and the sides lit up in bright orange.
Draco brushed the black hair off of his son’s face. “Not for someone as smart as you.” But at the boy’s pout, he relented. “Alright. I will tell you about a giant. No, a half-giant..” He thought of Hagrid, one of many casualties at the Battle of Hogwarts. “He wanted to keep it a secret, because his wizard-father told him to, but he kept growing and growing, until it was obvious to anyone that he was not like them.”
“Hmm,” the shopkeeper said, looking at him over thin-rimmed spectacles. “Beech and dragon heartstring. A fortuitous combination for a young lad. You’ll make your own destiny with it, I am sure.”
“Should we continue the DA meetings?” Hermione asked him after a Defence class that was a rehash of earlier lessons, given by Ministry workers in rotation.
But he knew who would have known.
Scorpius couldn’t stop smiling for the rest of the day. A pet was the best present ever!
So he endured dreams of some kind of corridor filled with glass balls, and nightmares about Sirius.
Harry summoned his house elf, pure magic crackling the air in his quarters like the beginnings of a storm.
child, out there. Every moment he spent with Teddy felt like a treasure, but also like Harry was trying to fill a hole in his core, which wasn’t fair to either of them.
But when he looked up, there was a set of stairs he had never seen before.
“All he needs is a fairy godmother, and he can wear glass slippers and go to the ball,” Harry said one night over dinner. Hermione and Ron and Sirius had been invited, so it was a little less dignified than the typical Malfoy meal.
It was just a letter, with nothing of consequence in it. But Draco traced the
Ron let out a groan, but he set his tankard down and turned to face Harry, eyebrow raised. “About time, innit?”
Dolores Umbridge had not survived the political ramifications of thirty-seven pregnancies under her watch. And Dumbledore was back in his position as Headmaster. Standing behind his shoulders were Harry’s head of house, and Snape, who looked like this was the last place he wanted to be.
“You look like you’ve never seen London,” Teddy said behind him.
“He has to go on adventures. Maybe he gets into trouble in the forest and his animal friends rescue him,” Scorpius said. “You really don’t know how this works, don’t you? Maybe I should tell you a story, instead.”
“And finally, I would like to introduce our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor and Gryffindor’s Head of House, Harry Potter.”
“I’m afraid it’s the best option we have right now, my boy.” Dumbledore looked down at him, and Harry grimaced at the twinkle behind those spectacles. “Marriage will accomplish several tasks at once. The first being, to strengthen the magics of protection around your unborn child.”
Thank you to everyone for your patience and your lovely comments! I may have lost a bit of momentum and got distracted by other projects, but I will definitely see this through. Also, maybe n3lo was right that 5 chapters isn't enough, so I'm leaving that up in the air for when I actually write Chapter 5 (and beyond). Hope you enjoy this installment, even if it's more of a transitional piece...
There weren’t many of those.
There was a large group on the platform with predominantly red hair, so they must be the infamous Weasleys. They were loud and boisterous, and Scorpius found himself smiling at their antics. There were several adults, and children in a wide range of ages. He shook his head, thinking how weird it must be to be part of such a big family.
idea, but it was hard to say no to Madame Malfoy—wasn’t particularly fussy. But strange magic swirled around him.
“Really, Harry” Hermione said waspishly. “I understand how people can get emotional over a national sport, but drinking to excess isn’t the most appropriate way to celebrate.
“But now the Malfoys are legally bound to protect you,” Ron said. “Remember what the hat sang? Invite the Slytherins, by all means. If we do it right, we might be able to
Harry bit his lip, meeting Professor McGonagall’s eyes. Her face was stiff with disapproval, but she nodded at him, confirming what the others said.
But the wand… well that one they couldn’t afford to skimp on. Kreacher brought him to a shop called Ollivander’s and he tried out what felt like hundreds of the bloody things, until one felt right in his hand, emitting blue and green sparkles when he waved it.
With shaking fingers, he lifted the latch and used both palms to open the lid. The stairs were still there, and he breathed a little easier.
Harry had ample time to think about having a child,
Harry looked down at his own feet. “We haven’t really talked about how things will be…
Scorpius heard the whispers of his classmates behind him. But the professor raised his hand until everyone fell silent.
Hermione elbowed Ron, who announced that he was making a food run. “Any special cravings, Harry? I heard Mikaela from seventh year requested a squid and squash pasta.”
Harry didn’t ask about his father, but came to pay his respects at Lucius’ grave. Draco was grateful. But as Harry bent to lay a flower basket at the stone marker, it was to a different person that he spoke. “Your line dies with you, Tom. Nobody will mourn you.” That was revenge enough.
are you?” He demanded in a trembling voice.
Draco argued against it, but his heart wasn’t in the fight. He was worried about Scorpius, and grateful, too.
, Harry had enough time to think before he reacted.
Kreacher was watching somewhere, and the knowledge of his presence made it easier for Scorpius to push through the barrier at Platform 9 ¾ to the other side. The Hogwarts Express had just pulled in, and he breathed out in relief to note there were a lot of empty carriages left.
Scorpius looked up at him—though at the rate his son was growing, it would soon be the other way around—and Draco read the fear behind his gaze.
He drank slowly but steadily, watching Ron catch up to George. But Ron could hold his drink with the best of them.
Minerva frowned. “You didn’t talk to the first years last night?”
Harry flushed at the reminder. “That doesn’t prove anything and you know it.”
“It was time for a change, I suppose.”
Walther pushed his face away even as he lengthened his nose to something sharpish to sting his friend’s palm. “Quit that, you nob! Weren’t you at the Sorting?”
Voldemort’s body was photographed by every major newspaper in the continent, before being burned at a phoenix-instigated pyre. Dumbledore thought it quite apt.
He knew his father had prepared food, but he didn’t want to open the trunk in front of other people, so he ended up sharing the snacks that Dominique and Lucy brought with them.
One night years later, an owl landed right on the trunk, pecking on the lid until Scorpius opened it. There was a letter in its claws with a familiar seal.
“You don’t have to do that,” Malfoy interjected, shoulders stiff. “We can have a gentleman’s agreement.”
A blunt shaped head emerged. It was a snake, light green and a pattern of blue diamonds down its back.
“Don’t be stupid.”
Scorpius has heard of Professor Potter. Kreacher had gotten him a history book of the War that his father only hinted at. It had answered some of his questions and raised even more. But he was always careful about questions. He had read about the great Harry Potter, the saviour of the wizarding world, and to meet him in person… was a bit of a let-down.
They hadn’t talked at all. But vials of nutrient potion started showing up on his table during mealtimes and he recognized the handwriting on the accompanying instructions. They matched the calligraphy on the invitations. So Harry drank them down dutifully. They tasted of wildflowers with a hint of chalk.
Scorpius nodded his thanks, removed the hat carefully, and headed to his new House table. A wave of whispers had broken around the room, but the professor had already called out the next student, “Teresa Chang!”
“Shut up, Ron.” Hermione was trying her best to browbeat them into studying but she was about ready to give up. “The real miracle is that you didn’t get anyone pregnant.”
Malfoy watched him leave. His mouth was turned down. Did he just make another mistake?
“There’s no way I’ll marry you,” Harry hissed and walked away. He pretended not to hear Malfoy’s murmur.
All was well.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Muggles,” he murmured under his breath.
“It may not be what we both planned, but I will do my duty,” Malfoy said with his precise accent.
“Uncle Harry!” Fred Weasley beamed at him as soon as class ended.
“Do you want me to lie and say I am madly in love with you?” Draco sounded tired.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dominique smiled kindly at him when he grabbed what looked like a corned beef sandwich. “
“Where’s father?” He asked sleepily.
Harry clapped a hand on his best friend’s shoulder. “Hey, we’ve got to start somewhere.”
“Well, think how
okay, but you should probably be careful about accepting anything edible from a Weasley.”
But along with the light came other things. A breeze wafted in, and it smelled like nothing Scorpius had ever smelled before: a mixture of smoke and rain, burnt meat and ozone. He found himself stumbling towards it, making his way past the looming shapes. The floor creaked beneath his steps, but he barely flinched, until he reached the sill of an open window.
He closed his eyes and focused on breathing for a long moment before he smoothed out the envelope crumpled in his grip and broke the seal to read his son’s words to him.
Harry had reread the incidents from the previous year more closely. Fred had gotten into a lot of fights, most of them with Slytherins. There were pranks as well, but there was a worrying element of humiliation to them.
feeling right now,” Harry grumbled. That morning, he had received an invitation to his own wedding. It was beautifully written in green ink against cream and he had stared down at it in horror.
Harry raised his chin. “Why? I’m sure your master would love it if you delivered me to him.”
war.”
He laid both hands on the boy’s shoulder, pushing him just far enough to meet his eyes. “Now come tell me about your journey.”
Somewhere there was a source of light, and he could see that the room was full of odd shapes, some piled on top of each other, looking like monsters, like trolls perhaps. He was scared and wanted nothing more than to go back into the door, into the safety of home.
He walked inside, grabbing a small jar of seeds from the mantel to offer the impatient courier, before gingerly removing the envelope from its claw.
Hermione capped her ink bottle and laid down her quill. “What
He jumped, whirling around with heart in his throat, hand still with Father’s wand, rising up defensively.
“Purebloods probably hate anything that’s mass-produced,” Harry suggested. “Too muggle for them.”
Scorpius paused in the act of biting into the sandwich. He almost choked on a piece, before he asked, “Why?”
Malfoy folded his hands. “Ah.”
“I’m sorry for doubting you, father,” Draco murmured as he lay a chrysanthemum into the coffin.
Harry shrugged, unable to find the words to explain himself.
“Oh,” he said, finally recognizing the creature from one of Father’s books.
“What is it, anyway?” Scorpius asked.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at Harry. “You might as well get started on your homework, Harry Potter.”
And then he spied Great Aunt Mildred’s face in the front row twisting and transforming into Aunt Bellatrix. She bared her teeth at him, before aiming her wand at Harry’s stomach.
Harry marshalled his youngest prefects the following night. Iason Holloway was a fifth-year muggleborn, polite, with shorn hair and muddy green eyes and a Beater’s build. He looked older than his age, and a touch intimidating. Good for discipline, maybe not so good for comforting the little ones. His counterpart was Mimosa Glenwood, candy pink hair braided down her back, setting off the darker tone of her skin. She looked at him with naked curiosity, but kept her mouth in a cool smile, for which he was grateful.
since we’re still underage. And I heard someone was spiking the punch with illegal potions, so if you feel really bad you should get Madame Pomfrey to check you out.”
After dinner, he trudged back to the common room. Alone. Ron wasn’t speaking to him since he confessed who he slept with that night. And he couldn’t take Hermione’s looks of mingled horror and pity. But when he reached the portrait, Draco Malfoy was standing awkwardly beside it.
Malfoy flinched, which made Harry snort. Ron had enlightened him on some aspects of pregnancy etiquette—supposedly, it was bloody rude to talk about the pregnant person’s body, and bodily fluids in particular—but Ron did it in a way that Harry failed to take seriously. “I’m fine. It’s not so bad,” he said, trying for diplomacy. “The potions help.”
Harry chewed the inside of his cheek. “I don’t think I can participate as much as I used to. But we have some members that still need to work on their skills.” Apparently, pregnant witches or wizards were vulnerable to spell accidents, so some of their lessons were redone to focus more on theory than practicals. It made the classes frustrating for people like Harry and Ron.
He scooted a little to make room for Lucy, but a tall boy with dark skin and curly dark hair snagged the back of her cloak and pulled her to the other side of the table. “I knew you had it in you, Lucy!” The boy told her, rubbing the top of her head with his knuckles, which loosened her bun.
Ron shook his head. “You don’t need to be Trelawney to foretell that disaster.”
Surprise registered briefly on Malfoy’s face. “Because the ritual will protect the child,” he explained slowly as if to a dimwit.
“It’s you, isn’t it?”
There was one room, however, that immediately felt like home: Professor Longbottom’s Greenhouse. The scent of dirt and green, growing things made him take a deep breath as soon as he stepped inside. He found himself smiling, though when he met the professor’s eyes, he ducked his head a little. But the professor smiled kindly at him and at every student in the room.
But, well, they didn’t call it Dutch courage for nothing. Harry was a little over the edge of tipsy, and George was already passed out when he broached the topic. “I’ve been thinking about Malfoy…”
Teddy’s cheeks reddened, but he just ruffled Scorpius’ hair. “See you, squirt.”
His eyes turned silver and his chin pointy.
Scorpius walked towards the stool with none-too-steady knees. He barely noticed the intense looks in his direction from around the room.
He picked an empty carriage, stowing the trunk under the seat. Outside the window, teary-eyed families were saying goodbyes to their children. Scorpius observed them curiously.
“You haven’t gone and fallen for that prick, haven’t you?” Ron asked, a little less belligerent than he usually was.
He looked out the window and wrote the first thing that came to mind.
Scorpius gasped out loud, then clapped both hands over his mouth, dropping Father’s wand in the process. His mind raced through the creatures in Father’s books. Which ones were shapeshifters? How do they capture prey? More importantly, how can they be killed?
Harry stared up at the canopy of his bed. He rubbed at the little swell on his stomach, which his school robes thankfully disguised. “At least I’ll have you.” He closed his eyes, remembering his mother’s voice just before Voldemort killed her. “And you’ll have me. Just let me survive.”
Teddy smiled. “What’s your name, anyway?”
They must have sensed his reluctance to talk, because neither pressed further. Ceres, sensing the mood in the room, jumped down from his lap and sashayed her way towards the two girls, who bent to pet her silky fur and make cooing noises.
Scorpius must have looked puzzled because it explained. “It means I’m the kind of wizard that can change my face without any spells.”
Harry cleared his throat. “I was wondering if we could have a private conversation.” Emphasis on private.
Ron turned bright red, guessing who he wanted to talk to. “Why don’t you ask your betrothed to bring his friends to sit in on the next meeting? I’m sure he would like that.” Harry eyed his friend, but Ron just shrugged at him. “They’re more likely to come if the invitation was from you. And Malfoy’s gonna be your family, Harry.”
“You’ve always been my brave one,” Draco murmured, understanding the reason for that fear. He had thought Scorpius would be just like him, but maybe a part of him was pleased that his son would have a different fate.
Voldemort attacks. Will the protection continue after I’ve given birth? Since we both know what they’re really concerned about.”
The next day, Father sat him down and told him about the world Out There.
The two looked at each other when they heard it. “Any relation to Sirius Black?” Dominique asked.
Harry snorted. “Were you expecting me to change my mind?”
“Too logical, you mean,” Hermione complained.
He was shorter and thinner than Scorpius expected. There were seventh years that were almost double his height and width. His face was ordinary too, and his hair was a frizzy mess. He had shown up in class in rumpled teacher’s robes, running his fingers through his hair.
Harry rolled his eyes even as he exited his classroom. “That’s Professor Potter to you, young man.” The passel of Weasley kids did have a tendency to call him uncle, but it always made him feel awkward, as if there were still expectations that he would marry Ginny and be an official part of the family.
Ron’s face turned white. “Merlin! I need new dress robes.”
His best mate, Walther Cole craned his neck. “Some Gryffindor first year, I reckon.”
Dumbledore smiled kindly at him. “Your youth and your magic are in your favour, dear boy. But marriage is still the safest option.”
Father didn’t bother hiding the stairs after Scorpius had discovered it. He just pretended that it wasn’t there.
Ron shrugged. “You held out longer than I thought.”
It felt like a prayer.
He knew very well that Sirius had been the last Black before he died. And then he saw the boy. And he knew right away who he was. How could he not?
Harry rubbed his chin. “Did
Sirius sounded so… happy.
Teddy Lupin was standing on a chair and mimicking Mimosa Glenwood’s hair for Reasons when he saw his childhood mystery. The friend he thought he had made up in a fit of loneliness. His hair turned from the candy pink braid to a magenta afro in a heartbeat, as he pointed at the kid. “Who’s that?”
On his ninth birthday, Father arranged a field trip with Kreacher. Scorpius understood how terrified his father was to let him go up out there again. But all he could feel was excitement. He was bundled up in a cloak transfigured into a muggle coat that almost dripped with protection spells, and a glamour was cast over his face, so he looked entirely unlike himself.
The two exchanged looks before Iason shrugged. “’e was filling in for the year, ol’ Professor Quorum. Told us we’d be heroes if we were lucky. Put a sparkle in me eye.”
“Could they come back, do you think?” Scorpius asked.
“Most of them were killed in the first war. You saw how many people showed up the night he came back.” Ron nodded to Harry, who nodded back. “It didn’t sound like much, so he badly needs to recruit. A small group is still dangerous but I doubt they’ll be able to start a war this time around.”
His mind conjured up the image of watching Ginny play for a professional team, of him standing in the bleachers cheering her on with Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys, vigorously proud of his girlfriend as he screamed himself hoarse, happy, beaming, alive and hopeful and normal—it vanished like smoke in a swift breeze.
Harry closed the box and picked it up, carrying it with him as he made his way back through the labyrinthine paths to Regulus’s desk. Harry had put the books he hadn’t been able to read on the floor next to his chair, and as he approached and sat down, he found what he was looking for.
“You’re the one who made it about me,” Malfoy said harshly. “If your little light show hadn’t worked, what then? He would have come after
“You know, I remember when you were a quiet kid,” Charlie said, giving him a not-gentle kick in the shin under the table. “Very polite. Bit of a weirdo. Used to be the only thing I could get you to talk about was quidditch.”
He was supposed to be done after today.
“Surely he can tell you once he’s rested,” Andromeda said in alarm as she came back into the sitting room. “He needs—”
A thread of warmth blossomed in his chest. He couldn’t help but smile. “I’ll try that, thanks. Unless—is this tea…er, safe?”
it, every shred of pain and fear and anger he had been forced to carry because this man had tried to play god.
The last page of the book looked, at first glance, to be blank. Harry frowned, clenching and unclenching his hands as they spasmed. He took his glasses off to rub his eyes, gritty and aching from so long sat staring at the bloody book—
He had no idea what he was going to do tomorrow, but thought he might to disappear for a while, get out of London and away from all of this. He was pretty sure Bill wouldn’t want him back at Shell Cottage after he’d read the article, and he didn’t want to try the Weasleys. He had no idea what Ginny would think, but he knew it wouldn’t be good. Ron had already kicked him out once.
He blinked furiously before he could start crying and folded the card back up, about to set it on the table before he tucked it into his pocket. So he had one person who wouldn’t want to strangle him. One person who thought he was doing the right thing.
Harry blinked, alarmed at the sudden wealth of disquiet this thought carried, but then Kreacher was himself, looking unsure and hopeful at the same time.
Because Harry couldn’t get the image of Voldemort’s final moments out of his head.
His fingers brushed over Regulus’s notes, as if they might reveal this lie for what it was, as if he could prove it wrong, somehow. As if the ghost of Regulus Black could tell him he hadn’t died as a baby only to be reanimated by a scrap of Voldemort’s corrupted soul. His eyes burned and he screwed up his face so he wouldn’t cry. He
Harry knew this with the same resigned understanding he’d taken from Dumbledore’s office. Maybe another version of Harry would have trusted some twist of fate and luck to save him again. To let him walk away from this without blood on his hands. A better version would trust Dumbledore’s double-edged lessons about love and sacrifice, mercy and forgiveness. He would believe in the purity and power of an unbroken soul.
This wasn’t nearly so strong, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something had slid out of place. He cast
And the entity was gone.
“What happened?” Bill muttered, his voice eerily calm. “Who attacked you?”
He heard the words but didn’t at first know how they were connected, it shouldn’t have mattered what Harry went through as a kid—except it did, and he was just starting to realize.
The moment froze, fixed in his mind.
Was that the catalyst, then—magic going wrong, casting unchecked? He knew almost nothing about magic cast innately—it wasn’t an acceptable course of study at Hogwarts, understandably—but he did seem to be able to do it, rather easily too.
He only then realized it was probably because of who he was talking with.
“None of this has anything to do with you,” Harry said loudly, forgetting to keep his voice down. He didn’t want anyone else coming out here to check on him, not when
He was going to kill this man.
Bill’s expression hardened as he breathed out, conflicted. “You shouldn’t even know about this.”
“Yeah,” he said hollowly. “Yeah, thanks, Kreacher. I’ll… I’ll be right down.”
Almost at once, though, he wondered why he cared what he looked like.
Because he had all the time in the world now to just…live, and while he
“Of course they would. You and I both know this guilt of theirs is only going to last so long. I took the job because I want to make sure the next person to hold this office doesn’t inherit any of this mess. I can’t do that if I step on too many toes. I can’t help if I’m not in the room. You know that, or you would have gone back to Gringotts. We need people inside, Bill, to make sure the last of Voldemort’s influence is gone.”
Harry looked up to the high bench, to Yeats and Kingsley in the center, to Percy where he sat a bit further along, his expression worried and tense. He stared at Yeats, waiting for the question he’d been wanting to answer since he sat down in this bloody dungeon.
Kreacher didn’t answer. He looked through the glass, pressing his hands on either side of his face and leaning in. He began to mumble under his breath, not the vaguely threatening gripes he’d enjoyed when Harry first met him, but a string of words, hard and consonant, quick like a fingernail tapping on stone.
He looked down, filled with an uncanny sense of backwards deja vu—it took him twice as long to see what he was supposed to see, like he caught the flash of a camera and had to wait until his sight returned to see who’d taken the picture.
Harry’s voice was quiet, but even to him it sounded unnaturally cruel.
He didn’t know why it was such a surprise, why it rocked him to the core. So many people had wanted him dead over the years, had tried, and nearly succeeded. Shouldn’t he be used to this by now?
Fucking hell. The last year had taken everything he’d thought he’d known, everything he’d wanted, and flipped it on its head. He was standing up for Malfoy. He was insulting Kingsley. He couldn’t hardly think about Hermione because it still hurt so fucking much. She’d stood by him through so much.
Draco’s jaw clenched. “He—was.” A mixture of fear and loathing flickered past his gaze. “I managed to figure it out on my own.”
Harry wouldn’t be surprised if his jaw cracked from how tight he was clenching it. Sounds built up in his throat but he pushed them back down, closing his eyes as his vision blurred. Horrible, cut off sobs rushed up to bash at the back of his teeth. He felt his body give out for a moment, like a string connected to his leg had been cut, but he clutched at Bill with his good hand.
After, he sat listening to the sounds of the wind drift through the ruined tower. A soft flap of wings greeted him, and Harry didn’t lift his head. He didn’t need to. Fawkes lighted down next to him, gently resting his beak on the same arm he had healed in the Chamber of Secrets. A few more tears slipped down Harry’s cheeks. Fawkes blinked his ancient, gleaming eyes at him, lifted his beak and touched one of Harry’s tears before it could slide off his chin.
“Shove it, Malfoy,” Harry muttered, done with this conversation.
He bowed forward over his legs, shoving his good hand into his hair as goosebumps erupted over every inch of his skin.
He breathed deeply and slowly until his hands stopped shaking. The spell itself was as simple as the one he’d used to Cleanse the plant, but it was going to draw a lot more from him than a small bead of blood. He didn’t know how much, though. Enough to overpower this thing, the dark presence which had lingered in this house since the moment he walked in the door. Probably since Sirius was young as well, maybe even longer. It felt old, whatever it was. It’d had plenty of time to grow mad and desperate.
“Let me out, Hermione.”
“Harry,” Hermione started gently, “if there’s something you need to talk about, you know you can.”
A puff of smoke cracked the air a foot in front of him. Harry jerked back, nearly sloshing his coffee all over his pants, only to watch a slightly-charred piece of parchment float down to the bed. He eyed it warily, the whole effect reminding him of his own name bursting out of the Goblet of Fire.
“You don’t have to—”
When he heard small gurgling noises, he made himself get up and walk to Teddy’s crib. He was still sleeping, his fists curled up and his eyes shut, but he was squirming. It surprised Harry that he knew it meant he was about to wake up. Maybe it shouldn’t have, since he’d been spending so much time here. Still the knowledge made something inside him warm, just a fraction.
and now you’re telling me I’m not allowed to think it’s fucking wrong to blame and punish
his mind supplied unhelpfully. With a jolt he realized that Malfoy was related to Andromeda, that he was her nephew. He had
He lingered on the last book, staring intently at the symbol branded into the front. It felt—important. He didn’t know how else to describe it. It felt like it was something he was supposed to recognize but every time he tried to open it he lost his nerve. It didn’t have anything to do with horcruxes, though, so he set it aside for the time being and went back to the ones he could actually read.
“Okay,” Bill said with a smile. “Thanks.”
The plant shook and collapsed. Its leaves and petals crumpled and withered until it was no more than a pot of potpourri.
She made no reaction, and Harry didn’t expect one.
“That’s not what I said!”
Just like Malfoy in the Astronomy tower.
He managed to transfigure the armoire a bit smaller, shifting it out of the way so he could make a little entrance for himself. The open area was a few yards square, the muted light of the grey morning outside giving it an almost cozy feel. Two sides were normal walls while the others were tightly-stacked books. Harry wondered if this hadn’t been some kind of sitting area in years past, noting scuff marks on the wooden floor which looked a bit like the legs of a chair had been dragged repeatedly across it. His gaze caught on the view outside the window. There was something odd about it, like everything had shifted slightly to the left, or something.
Proulx arched his brow, made a small scoffing noise which reminded Harry too much of Umbridge’s cough. “You’ve known him for seven years and you can’t—”
“Shut up, Blaise.”
“Mate, I can take a walk down the Slytherin dormitories. They'll all guarantee you cheated.”
He might have been able to once, but he didn’t know if he could now.
The fear of whatever this house might do to intruders made Harry ignore his growing tension and start down the hall. He might not be looking forward to the forthcoming conversation, but he didn’t want Ron to get a face full of pixies or blasted by a curse.
His thigh nudged between Harry’s legs and Harry let out a strangled noise of pleasure, incoherent now as his breath came fast, as it grew harder and harder to breathe, every exhale ringing through the cavernous room. His back arched, his legs opened wider, his mind growing sluggish as pleasure pulsed slowly through his veins like poison, Tom’s words low and intoned like an incantation. They drifted over his face like a series of kisses, settled just behind Harry’s ear.
been hanging.
Malfoy’s expression twitched, but he didn’t betray anything, his smile just as lazy as it used to be when he had nothing to do but think up fun new ways to make Harry’s life more miserable.
He knew this person. He had to.
He took the gnarled lump of his feelings and set them aside, and he went back into Andromeda’s house.
Her gaze went distant. “I think it makes sense too. My parents—they were terrified when I finally told them what happened, after I…fixed them. They weren’t even mad about what I did, they just… I felt—god, Harry, I felt
And he was starting to wonder if Malfoy hadn’t been a different person as well.
He didn’t like to think why it had shown itself now, after being here for so long. How it might have everything to do with the fact that he’d started practicing
“HE DIDN’T!” Neville shouted, joined at once by Ron and Hermione and Ginny, every one of his loved ones raising their voices in defiance. “HE—”
“At quarter to seven on a Monday night?”
“The day was that bad, huh?”
Narcissa’s voice rang out above the crowd, shattering the tense space between Draco and his aunt. Bellatrix spun around in shock and fury, eyes wide—
Because there would be a next time. He was under no illusions on that front. If there was an after for him, after the fighting and the pain and the surviving, it was a long time coming. But he wouldn’t count on it. Not anymore.
Harry would have found it disturbing had he been told even a few weeks ago that his house was reaching out—he could feel the house responding to him. He’d walk into rooms and feel a strange sense of disconnect and then a doubling of his senses, like deja vu but more intense. Sometimes it would be something small, a lamp shifting out of the corner of his eye to better sit on a table, a bit of carpet smoothing after he’d tripped over it and cursed when he nearly fell. The house was brighter now, too, the curtains slowly drifting open to reveal warped glass windows and dust-covered sills.
The only thing waiting for him would be the image of Goyle’s blank, twisted face. And though he couldn’t remember what he’d dreamed about last night, he didn’t think his subconscious would be gentle with him this time. It hadn’t been nice, whatever it was. Or…not entirely.
HI GUYS.
and here we start to get into the meat of what I ended up getting fixated on in this fic (and why it is going to take longer for me to get to the shippy schmoopy angsty painful romance part) -- all that Death shit. I realize that a lot of this chapter might have felt like a rehashing of something we as readers know, but I needed harry to go on that journey and start to realize there's a lot about magic that he doesn't know, because hey, that's the summary of the fic, so after 77k words we're finally getting there babes! (also there's a Reason for all the extra lore stuff, I swear, I'm not just indulging in my own worldbuilding (although I am definitely also doing that because researching for this fic and plugging in all my weird esoteric knowledge of medieval folklore was really fun and I think it's Neat) so bear with me please--or don't! totally fine! but this is gonna happen a lot so I hope you find it at least a bit interesting).
He took a deep breath, letting the image of himself standing amongst a sea of stars settle his nerves, and whispered,

onto the legs of kids?”
If he couldn’t confide in his friends, maybe Regulus Black could help him one more time.
A whole arm. Bloody hell. “Who… Can you tell me who?”
Harry stared at Malfoy like he’d transformed into a different person. He was just—talking. Like someone normal. No sneer or smirk, no attempt at coming off smart or slick. His expression was mild, open, almost like this was a normal occurence.
“I appreciate your candor, Mr. Potter,” Robards said at last, steadily. “You should know that the Ministry is firmly aware of how much it owes you. I don’t just speak for myself when I say that many of us regret how you were treated in the past, and are dedicated to correct those mistakes.”
someone.”
“So, he took away your wand, he was choking you…”
He woke shaking, the dream slipping quickly away as if someone ripped it from his still semiconscious mind.
“Am I going mad?” he asked after a long minute of deliberation.
Harry grinned. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Teddy can’t seem to shut up.”
Every time he thought he had accepted it the truth went sour and left him again with the knowledge that without Draco Malfoy, he’d never have been able to kill Voldemort. Without him disarming Dumbledore, letting Harry take his wand, causing enough of a distraction for Harry to get up and face Voldemort on his own terms—Harry wouldn’t have been able to challenge Voldemort for the Elder Wand. Harry would have died.
“This is going to hurt,” Bill said, taking a deep breath.
It took him nearly an hour to settle down, to get out of bed and find something to eat. He ate a few slices of bread as he tried to convince himself the dreams, the horribly vivid and yet completely transient dreams, were just a side effect of doing so much strange magic. Maybe he needed to slow down, maybe he needed to give himself time to rest.
He waited for the tears to come like they had when he’d set Dobby down in his little grave. Like they had right before he’d killed Voldemort. He almost wanted them to overflow and overtake him. He stood by the lake and the little copse of evergreens, waiting for catharsis or release, until the sun began to fall again through the sky, cutting down through the clouds.
“Would you like further use of your wand hand?” Andromeda asked sharply, her tone driving the fear of God straight into Harry’s mind. “Or shall I simply lop it off?”
Harry’s anger pounded in his chest now and it was all he could do not to march down the stairs and slam his fist into Malfoy’s face. “Take your wand and piss off, you pathetic asshole, or I’m—”
“You’ll never have to be alone again.”
The investigation was over and Robards wanted to debrief Harry, but he could leave Grimmauld Place. He’d been feeling tense and anxious since casting the Fidelius Charm, and he should have been thrilled to get out, but it still took him some time to work up the courage—standing in front of his floo and watching the green flames flicker like they were taunting him, daring him.
His voice was far louder than he’d intended it to be, startling a few people. Heads whipped back and forth as people began muttering.
“Lots of things are wrong in this world, Potter.”
you sit there and threaten teenagers because they chose not to risk their own fucking lives! How many of you worked for the Ministry last year?”
Harry didn’t have anything to say to this. It skirted too close to that nebulous, hazy future Harry still had no idea what to do with. So he just hummed in a noncommittal fashion, trying to wrestle his chest back into position as it tried to squirm around under Charlie’s praise. He didn’t want to think Charlie was just trying to make him feel better, but it was hard when both he and Bill seemed to treating him like a horse that might bolt if they scared him.
“Glad to see you still enjoy walking up to insult me without any kind of provocation.”
He trailed off as Malfoy continued to stare levelly at him.

There was a flash of silver, and then there was nothing.
The longer he stared, actually, the more he came to be sure they weren’t wand movements, but finger and hand movements. The diagrams suddenly made much more sense as he recognized hands, arrows detailing which position flowed into the next, the twist of arms and palms directing energy of some kind, symbolized by more of that faint green ink.
“Don’t. Please, Harry.” Her voice was hard and final but her cheeks shined and her eyes were red, lit up gently by the lamp on her bedside table. It was decorated with painted flowers. There were flowers in the window sill and next to her quidditch gear in the corner. The whole room smelled like her. Sweet and warm and unbearable.

I’m not. So he’s being monitored? If there wasn’t a reason to come in, you know he’d be on the next boat across the pond. They wouldn’t be able to find that slippery ferret if they didn’t keep him on a tight leash.”
Under it all rang the truth, both wanted and unwanted, that this house belonged to him now, and that he could either accept it, or abandon it forever.
“I can think of a few things you could have said,” Ron said around a harsh laugh. “How about we start with you ditching my sister. Again.”
“The Return of Old King Stag,” found written on a scrap of bloodstained parchment in 1869 by Emily Gerard where it was slipped between the pages of
Ron stared, his eyes narrowed and his mouth slightly open. “Are you saying you ordered him to keep back all your mail?”
“A long time ago. I decided to stay home once Nymphadora was born but I still know a thing or two. I’m sure I don’t have to tell you how useful it is when you’re constantly running after a child who seems determined to run headfirst into everything they see.”
It wasn’t the first time Andromeda had shown him this kind of physical affection, but Harry still didn’t know how to handle it. Teddy was one thing. He was a baby and babies were grabby little monsters. But Harry had never learned how to not feel like he was about to jump out of his skin whenever someone did something like that—absently touching him, hugging him. He still felt that way with Ron sometimes when he gave Harry a playful shove. Or, he
But…” She trailed off, looking over Harry’s shoulder where Ron was probably standing at the bar. “I don’t know. It’s fine. Ron is just. You know.”
a few days ago.
“Hermione’s getting back this week and look, mate, I love you,” he said as he took Harry by the shoulders and adopted a stoic, pitying expression, like Harry was a needy child, “but she’s my girlfriend now and I haven’t seen her in two months. So I can’t have you sleep-mumbling in the other room while—” Harry had shrugged him off at this point, threatening one of his many chrome balls Ron liked to call ‘art’ if he so much as hinted at what he and Hermione were going to do that required him to be gone.
The small gesture did something odd to Harry’s chest. It was something he might have done for Hermione, were things easy like they used to be.
Harry didn’t have an answer for that.
“No one besides the people who were in this room when we last spoke know of the events which occurred last week involving you, Harry, but we have formally charged Millicent Bulstrode with destruction of public property, intent to commit harm, and a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy, while Gregory Goyle’s case has been closed, as we’ve determined he did in fact kill the muggles for which he was charged by the Wizengamot. Millicent, in her current state, will likely be sentenced to hospice care for the rest of her life, as there is little chance of her recovering enough to function on her own.”
“Know what?” Harry asked, temper getting shorter. “I didn’t realize it was illegal to speak to someone else in the Ministry atrium. You’d think they’d put up a sign.”
Kreacher’s eyes grew wet again. “Kreacher is leaving Master Harry to his organizing. Kreacher is making pumpkin pasties for dinner.”
“Fina.”
For the sake of argument, let’s say I agree with you. You think
“He’s joking, Harry,” Percy said with a tight smile. “You look perfectly respectable.”
without everyone wanting some piece of me?”
His grip around his wand felt so strange in the wrong hand. It was like he was eleven and standing in Olivander’s shop holding this stick and wondering how on earth he was supposed to do anything with it other than poke his own eye out.
Sharp, running footsteps caught up to him in the Entrance Hall. He gritted his teeth, ready to tell Hermione and Ron that he was fine, he just needed some air, but it wasn’t them.
here, and as much as I can be, I—”
“And master is not going to throw anything away?”
“The one I
didn’t ask for any of this! But
with.
“It’s not charity, Malfoy, I’m just—” Harry balled his hands into fists, fighting the rising anger in his throat. “I took your wand. Now I’m giving it back.”
Harry tried to shake his head again, but the hands holding his face wouldn’t let him.
But Malfoy…made him agitated. It wasn’t a new emotion when it came to Draco Malfoy but it felt—erratic. He waited for Malfoy to do something in line with Harry’s instinctual distrust, to become again the bully who had plagued him nearly his entire school career. It was odd, because while he’d thought about Malfoy a lot over the past year, more than he should have, he had never been angry… Concerned wasn’t the right word but it was close. He had seen what Voldemort put him through.
He crossed to the little table sitting by the wall and scratched out two notes, one for Andromeda and one for Bill, letting them know he was all right, and not to worry if they’d suddenly forgotten where he lived. He’d already set up an enchantment on his floo to hide the location of his fireplace but keep it connected to the larger network, and it didn’t stop him from sending things out. The enchantment was tedious though, and it required him checking regularly for any incoming letters. He should think about getting an owl. For some complicated reason no one had ever been able adequately explain to him, owls, the special ones which carried wizard post and parcels, didn’t need to know the exact location of a person to deliver mail. One could hide oneself from an owl through a variety of different kinds of spells, but the owl couldn’t convey the address to the person sending mail even if it wanted to.
be it. If Goyle had wanted him dead, he could have found a better and quicker way of doing it than stalking Harry for weeks. Harry clearly knew less than he’d thought he’d known about Goyle, but Harry would bet money he still wasn’t the type to do this so subtly, to spend so much time working on it, only to fuck it up on the dismount. Nothing about those final moments with Goyle was calculated, planned. He was raving.
He repeated this over and over again. He’d done this so many times before. He’d been in worse spots. Hadn’t he?
He felt their stares on the back of his neck as he made his way down to the water.
Harry didn’t move. A witch cleared her throat quietly to his left. He waited for the voice of caution to tell him to leave it alone, to get out and breathe some fresh air before he did something stupid. Problem was, that voice of caution sounded an awful lot like Hermione.
“Give him a week and he’ll be fine,” Harry said. “I think he’s probably just disappointed he can’t keep you in his brand new flat forever.”
“No,” Harry said before he could offer.
A tiny thread pulled at his chest as he remembered the terrified look on Malfoy’s face in the courtroom, as he watched Harry descend the elevator with a strange light in his eyes, the smile and the approval in the atrium which had made Harry feel like a fire’d been lit inside him—it was just—odd. Unsettling. It wasn’t that he…
Harry let out a sharp laugh, grinning. Right. Wasn’t too hard.
There was probably an important distinction there but he didn’t want to try too hard to figure it out.
“If it helps,” Percy said quietly, “you’re not alone.”
His chest constricted in guilt. “I—well, no. But I’m not—”
Wasn’t what? Why did comparing Malfoy to Voldemort make him want to smash his glass on the floor?
He was losing a lot of blood, he realized, could feel himself getting dizzy. He looked down and saw darkness staining his white shirt all the way up to his chest, soaking into his suit and robes, trailing down his hip.
“Harry?”
Hermione laughed, and then quickly covered her mouth as Ron slid back into his seat.
He didn’t let himself think about the stack of books he was making for Hermione, or the small collection of things he thought Ron would get a kick out of.
to be wrong.
Draco shouted with effort as he dodged a familiar jet of green light. Harry’s heart lurched forward. His wand jerked up as he remembered the last time Bellatrix had sent a Killing Curse in his presence. The image of Sirius’s last smile was imprinted onto his soul and he could feel time folding in on itself.
Her eyes widened as she nodded. “Yes. Edlefina Lamar. I—I’m a year younger than you at school. In Sly—or I was, anyway. Not now, obviously.”
Harry refused to look away. He swallowed tightly. “Yeah. How did—”
I’m—”
It felt, Harry realized with startling grief, like a child who had been locked in a cupboard all his life.
“You won’t—be able to fuck things up now,” Goyle said through clenched teeth, voice breaking on every other word. Another impact to his stomach. Harry would have tasted bile if Goyle hadn’t been crushing his throat. “Never again. I’ll kill you, I will—and I’ll kill all your stupid mudblood friends and you won’t be able to do anything because you’ll be
No one answered him, but the towel on the rack flipped up its end, as if to dismiss the very thought. The floor creaked as well—not the kind of creak Harry was used to, that sounded like Grimmauld Place would like nothing more than to die a painless death, but the kind which put him in the mind of Mrs. Weasley when she sighed good-naturedly at him after he’d asked if he could help her with something.
Harry came to a stop and stared at the ground, the obvious answer floating up like an innocent cloud.
Old magic. Crude, Dumbledore had told him, the idea rooted in the weakening of oneself to gain entry.
“What can you tell me about Draco Malfoy and his involvement with the Dark Lord or any of his followers?”
He was so handsome. How had Harry not realized that before?
I know I missed the end of Pride month, but just in case everyone needs to hear it again: trans women are women, Black and brown trans women fought so the rest of us could live our truth and we must remember that if not for them none of this would have been possible, and Black lives matter, now and forever and always. Stay (or get) educated and vigilant, and maybe we can salvage something from this year straight out of hell.
“Right, because you’re very receptive to other people’s helpful advice.”
He felt the shudder through the bones of the house when Ron slammed the door behind him.
All at once Malfoy’s brow smoothed as he tilted his head, realization darkening his gaze. “You heard about Ravenna.”
Harry’s throat went tight and he couldn’t do anything more than blink against the tears and nod.
And that was worse than all the rest of it. She had still thought he would come around.
“I’m going to give you a sedative, all right? It’s not a true sleeping draft because I suspect you’ll need to be up again in a few hours once Bill returns, but it will help you relax.”
He glared down at the box for another minute, trying to convince himself to leave well enough alone, but in the end his curiosity wore out. It was just a box. He’d be careful.
something.
So it was with this determination that he cast the Fidelius Charm. And really, after what he’d done down in the cellar, it was simple.
To create a horcrux, you needed an empty vessel, an empty body. The body was empty only when the soul had been severed, separated. Only when the person was dead.
Malfoy stared, face blank. His lips parted. He exhaled. His brow furrowed. “You’re putting me on, right?”
Fear of death.
was practically a death sentence for anyone who couldn’t remove their own bloody leg before the curse took hold of their heart and made it stop pumping blood. Hard to breathe when your lungs froze and your brain up and turned off.
Something wrapped around his ankle. He jumped and tried to shake it off. It tugged. He fell down to his knees, what was left of the flowers crushed beneath his hands. The rustling grew louder, pulsed with the quick beating of his heart.
Robards closed his eyes with a heavy sigh. “I will have to eventually, yes.” When he looked at Harry again, he could see conflict in the old man. So it wasn’t just Kingsley who’d found what was going on distasteful. It seemed a lot of people were opposed, actually.
Except for Harry. For him, dying just meant breaking into smaller and smaller pieces.
The plant expanded, its progress slowed slightly by the fact that there was no more room in the pot. It came to a rest when the stems reached a good foot and a half to either side, and crested two feet in height.
He cut Robards off with a look. “I broke into the Department of Mysteries when I was fifteen. That’s how secure your Ministry is.”
Harry didn’t know how to respond. He wanted to kick Ron out and just walk away, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it yet, like there was still some part of him that thought it was mad the way he was acting.
Or, the place where it
“Thought it was just common sense.”

Letting the attic lead him didn’t work all the time, though. He’d been collecting what he thought was a series of memoirs which reminded him of Lockhart’s books, only to realize to his immediate horror that they were

should work if I’m Imperiused. If it’s some kind of love potion I’d get violent, so you have to be careful, right?”
He was almost—disappointed, if he had to pin it down. It was maybe the best orgasm he’d ever had, miles away from the pathetic excuse for sex he’d had with Ginny, and it’d come about because of a vague impression of…someone. Someone Harry knew, or… Maybe not. It was like an itch at the back of his head, under his skull, imprinted on his brain. Problem was, he didn’t know any girls who were taller than him except for Fleur, and he knew without a doubt it hadn’t been her. It’s not that Harry wasn’t immune to her charms—they’d met when he was fourteen, so it wasn’t like he hadn’t tugged one off to her at some point in his life, as scummy as it made him feel now—but she was more like an older sister at this point.
He had never looked more human.
“If Master is willing, Kreacher can put it in the greenhouse?”
“Lovely as you are,” he added out loud, shooting a nervous glance behind him as if the house were about to hit him with a frying pan. Which wasn’t exactly out of the realm of possibility, so his concern was warranted. Although, could it understand his thoughts, or was that something he needed to say out loud, or…
Harry went very still. The last time he’d heard that phrase he’d been hundreds of miles away in a cold, dark tent with Hermione, going over the possible ways they could destroy horcruxes for the hundredth time, retreading ground rather than sitting in silence. One more in a list of increasingly horrible and improbable ways to damage something so thoroughly nothing could fix it.
“Right. Sorry.” She grimaced. “It was very lucky I showed up, but even then, I would have had no idea how to stop it from the outside. I’m not sure
“Remus Lupin?” the woman with glasses asked, leaning forward in her chair. “From the Order of the Phoenix?”
“Right. Thanks, Bill,” Harry added as Bill stepped away.
“Your apartment in St. Andrews was mostly destroyed, as you know. But we were able to salvage a few things.” From a pocket of his robes, he pulled out a few more items. Harry’s heart leapt into his throat at the sight of them.
Harry glanced at Robards, knowing he’d been an auror at the time the Ministry was looking for Sirius, but he just looked implacable. Maybe a bit uncomfortable, but Harry guessed that was more to do with him being eternally severe.
“Harry,” Hermione hissed. “Calm down.”
“You don’t think I realize exactly how insane this is?” he asked, voice cracking. He could barely understand himself over the roaring of blood in his ears. “I
The figure asked,
Harry’s left hand fell to his thigh. He held his wand so tight his fingers began to cramp. His right was lying useless on the ground. He stared at Goyle’s body. His breathing grew shallow as the silence seemed to layer itself over him.
But the house elf had burst into tears once when Harry suggested he might make a pie on his own one night, threatening to chop his own fingers off in penance for what he assumed was a failing on his part, so Harry had assumed suggesting anything close to time off would be tantamount to torture.
Harry nodded. “Right. You want me to check in, or—”
Ron and Hermione hadn’t killed anyone, sure, but Harry had. They’d watched him do it. They’d thanked him. Everyone had.
It was about this thought that Harry realized he wasn’t going to be much of a laugh the rest of the night.
away from me and you think I wouldn’t come for you—well, I
“I can see why you might need outside help,” Harry said, frowning as they walked past the fountain. There was no statue now. Maybe they had realized that anything they could come up with would be offensive to somebody. Harry privately agreed but it did make the atrium look bare and bigger.
Harry shouted, backpedaling as Goyle lunged at him.
Robards inclined his head. “That’d be most helpful. I’ve decided to keep this investigation quiet. All the witnesses at your building have been questioned, and no one but the landlord seems to know you were the owner, and she’s sworn to keep quiet in accordance of the agreement you both signed. As such, it will take time to do this properly, without drawing more attention.”
Voldemort’s—Riddle’s face swam before him as Harry sat there with the Weasleys, the young, handsome boy blending with the man who had transformed into a monster to cheat death. He kept flipping between the two images laid out in front of him and one
He squinted at the small writing, summoning his glasses so he could actually see. In scratchy, compact writing, it said,

It was supposed to be
But he wasn’t just blindly following someone else’s words, not like with Snape’s potions book or Riddle’s diary. He understood the magic he was performing. He might not understand
The day before the trials started Harry got a television, because he couldn’t think what else to do.
“Not by me, it wasn’t.” Bill frowned. “Honestly, though, I’m not sure we would have known what half the stuff was without Draco identifying it. The old pureblood families, their brand, anyway, are mad about their ancient heirlooms and relics. I worked on a vault once in Germany which went down five hundred feet and had no less than fifty-five independent curses to break on the way. Spent a year on that job, still didn’t get past the twenty-second.”
him to.
In its place hung another painting. Fields of green, swaying grass and wildflowers. A sky so blue it looked like it was shining. Clouds drifted past with a soft wind and in the far distance he thought he could make out a darker line of trees.
“They are. A little rattled, and more than a bit upset with me, obviously, but fine. I meant my father’s family in Lagos. Apparently my great aunt is putting together some kind of reunion in October, and I’ve never spent much time with them. I mean, obviously, they’re all muggles, but… My dad’s been mentioning it constantly. I think he really wants me to go with him.” She shrugged, pushing back her sleek brown hair and playing with one of her earrings.
“Yeah, well, I do.” Harry’s jaw clenched. “So I guess they know it’s wrong or else they’d be shouting it from the rooftops, yeah? It’d be on the front of the Prophet like the rest of the trials. But maybe they think eleven-year-olds getting punished because of their parents wouldn’t sit well with their readers.”
The air in the room shifted as Robards straightened. “So.” He met Harry’s gaze firmly. “I’m afraid we haven’t learned much more than what we were able to tell you the last time we spoke, however it seems as if Goyle and Bulstrode
“Because that’s so insane?” Harry shouted, finally letting his temper loose. “You ever think that maybe I’ve had enough of taking it all on me? Have you ever thought, after all this time, that maybe I’m done trying to be there for everyone else? Maybe I’d like to fucking
The image of Dumbledore sliding down the wall, Malfoy’s wand shaking as he broke down in fear, made his hands clench. “I do. He was—tasked to kill Albus Dumbledore.”
He realized with a small, faint sadness that he had left that boy in the forest. The boy who had been carried out in the arms of the first person who had ever shown him kindness didn’t have that trust. He didn’t
Slowly he recognized the sinking guilt, knowing that Ron and Hermione, the Weasleys, would all know eventually that he’d barred them from his home. At least until he could tell them again. Though…
working together. We managed to trace them both back to an apartment in Swindon, where it seemed they’d been staying together for at least a few days prior to their attempts on your life. From there it gets murkier.” Robards paused, seeming to mull something over. “They had little with them, almost nothing, in fact. Just this.”
“Again,
but something similar. Like there was another language sitting in his head, waiting impatiently for him to figure it out.
“I’m sorry,” he said, tone flat, “but I have no idea who you’re talking about. I’m sure he’s very nice, but I—”
“And you held him at bay?” Proulx’s eyebrow arched. “Impressive.”
Black spots formed in front of Harry’s eyes as the hand around his throat tightened. Goyle was holding him down with one hand, just
which was published in 1890 and, though it mentioned the Fidelius Charm, it was only in passing and to suggest that any wizard wishing to guard his home from prying eyes might do better with a suite of Discrete Decency Charms, as shielding one’s home made it rather more difficult to entertain guests. He read and re-read the old spell in the ancient book, gleaning a bit of comprehension from his work with the blood rituals to cleanse the house. Again, it seemed to come down to intention here, and strength of will. More than once he had the painful thought that Hermione would have hated this. It felt a lot like Snape’s notes in
“It doesn’t matter what I—”
Finally, Robards looked away over Harry’s shoulder. “Thank you for letting us use your home, Andromeda.”
Harry exhaled shakily and extracted himself from the mess of blankets, grimacing at the dirt and blood smeared over everything. A cursory inspection of himself told him he wasn’t in immediate danger of infection or bleeding out. In fact, once he wiped off some of the dried blood and dirt, he saw almost nothing of the cut which had traveled all down his right forearm—just a scar, almost like it’d been weeks since the ritual had happened.
He’d killed Goyle. A kid he’d gone to school with for six years. A bully and a thug, sure, a kid who’d tried to kill him and nearly succeeded, but he was still… He was still a person Harry knew. Had known.
“It’s fine,” Harry muttered. “Can you—can I sit up?”
Some part of him wondered if that would ever be true.
She fixed him with a glare that had no teeth. “I would hope you would intervene if I did.”
Harry would have nodded his head too, but Teddy was currently trying to twist his hair into some kind of eldritch knot, intense concentration on his tiny pink face. His left eye slowly shifted into Harry’s green while the right remained his normal brown.
this man, to understand him, to
“We split up,” he said quickly, before he could lose his nerve. “It’s fine, really,” he added as her mouth popped open on a gasp. “It was—mutual and it happened almost two months ago, now, so…” He shrugged.
Robards blinked, startled. It was a strange look on his stoic features. “Excuse me?”
In his darker moments he thought this was exactly the reason why those feelings felt so distant. Harry at sixteen still believed there was some greater meaning to his life. He was on a path that had been set for him before his birth. Ginny had been on that path, the inevitable end to the person he had been when they met for the first time in the Burrow. And not only was that beyond selfish to think, it wasn’t fair to her.
you don’t know,” Ron said, taking a step toward him. “Merlin’s bullocks, Harry, I’ve been trying to get ahold of you for five days, and you’ve been ignoring me. Your floo is closed. Or did you just forget to open it back up and accept the eleven owls I sent you?”
something move. He didn’t see or hear it, but
Hermione’s mouth was shut tight, her chin quivering as she stared at him, chest heaving, eyes wide. Like she was afraid of him.
His dreams since Voldemort’s death had been vague and unfixed. Filled with a low burning anxiety which was weak enough he could brush it off come morning. He still dreamed of his mum’s screams and Sirius’s smile as he fell back through the veil and Remus’s peaceful expression where he lay on the blasted stones of Hogwarts like he was just sleeping. They were mixed in with all the other dreams of kids in shackles and a room full of black robes.
Finally, he found the page where Regulus had written small notes next to the list of books he’d gathered, but on this one, the unnamed book with the symbol burned into the front, there was nothing except a single sentence;
Ron laughed harshly. “Pretty sure we all saw him murder his own aunt, Harry.”
He looked again at the title.
Harry wondered what would happen to the dark mark now Voldemort was gone. Maybe it’d turn back into a normal tattoo or fade into a scar. He hoped it wouldn’t. He hoped it would stay there forever to remind Malfoy and all the other death eaters every day of the choice they’d made. In a twist of righteous anger, Harry hoped the guilt ate them alive.
Harry moved, the spell ready on the tip of his tongue.
Thinking of Umbridge made the back of his left hand burn, and he clenched it before he realized it would look combative, aggressive.
felt? I wouldn’t be surprised if he refuses to talk to you for a month!”
But he seemed to be the only one who thought so.
“She was fourteen and being attacked by a group of highly-trained witches and wizards, but she knew what she was doing, right? She deserved to die? It was justified when one of your aurors let a Killing Curse slip out? And Geraldine White? Bradford Belmont? How long have they been in Azkaban? Two months now, isn’t it? I imagine they’re where they belong beside men and women who were in Voldemort’s inner circle, the most dangerous witches and wizards in Britain who spent years doing unspeakably vile things? Who murdered and tortured and fought to silence anyone who stood against the man they followed without question? That seems a fitting punishment for two fifteen-year-old kids, doesn’t it?”
The name pinged something in his memory. Chastel. Where…
“Mr. and Mrs. Bulstrode knew nothing about their daughter’s plans,” Robards continued. “They were put on a watch list of those suspected of harboring death eater sympathies after the war, but they were cleared shortly after the trials began. Millicent had apparently been distant of late, spending more and more time with friends outside of their home. Presumably, it was Gregory Goyle. They were understandably distraught when they were told what happened to her, and why. They also accepted the conclusion. No one else will be looking into this.”
Harry’s chest tightened. There was fear in that voice. It was even more familiar now, hitting some tender part of him he hadn’t prodded in a long time.
He hadn’t meant to walk himself through it, not at first. He’d meant to just organize the books, to see if there was anything worth reading, but he quickly learned that Regulus hadn’t just translated the tomes searching for references to horcruxes. He’d tried to reverse engineer them. As if the thought exercise would better prepare him for the moment he turned on Voldemort.
With a gentle twist, the beams of light flashed and sped inward—the secret being drawn together and coalescing into a single point of intention. He sketched a small circle in the air with his wand. Like a key in a lock, the secret clicked into place, and all the pearls winked out.
“What terrible things?” Proulx asked. “And how do you know these things?”
Kingsley’s jaw was tense, and there was conflict in his eyes. “Find someone you can talk to.”
He could still tell him. This wasn’t unfixable. Not yet.
the auror said with an increasingly perplexed expression.
too! Come say hi!
Ron and Hermione were there too, just like Ginny and Luna and Neville, the Weasleys—all of them showed up and died. Molly’s boggart had showed her the deaths of all her family members, flipping through them one by one.
Ron, who had grown up with parents who loved him, with a home and a family and a place to fall back on, a place he belonged just because of who he was, who hadn’t been shut away in a cupboard because he was so unwanted, who had never spent countless nights listening to the sound of his mother dying, who had never lost every person who’d ever been close to something like a parent, who had never been betrayed by the person he’d thought was his best and last protector.
her, and they threw her friends in jail, because they were scared and alone and their parents were
Harry blinked. “Oh. That makes sense, actually.” At Andromeda’s raised brow, he added, “I found it in Sirius’s stuff. It was hanging round a dash ornament.”
Harry listened to the sound of Kreacher’s mumblings move away, frowning. He didn’t know how old Kreacher was, or what happened to house-elves when they reached a certain age. The heads which used to be stuffed and mounted in the front hall told him what the Blacks used to do. But he’d never needed to know the natural lifespan of a house-elf.
He stepped into the lift. The grate slid shut. The pleasant female voice over his head announced the floors one by one, and as he looked up to pull the correct lever, his eyes caught on a pale face.
“If that’s what you want.” Bill shifted on the couch next to him.
Harry’s chest constricted painfully. He should leave. He didn’t want to hear this.
the mudblood, Nagini!”
Andromeda pulled a towel from her shoulder, cleaning off his hand, giving him a reassuring squeeze. “Think I’ve got more of those orange biscuits, if you want some?” She fussed with his hair, reminding him painfully of Molly. “I can make you beans and toast? Tea? You must be starving.”
“Ron,” Hermione warned.
Learning what he was, what he had always been, killing Voldemort—he’d lost the path. Or maybe the path had lost him.
I'm on
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you for coming here today, Mr. Potter,” Yeats said once the courtroom had quieted again. “The Wizengamot appreciates your cooperation with the transparency of these trials.”
“I’m serious.” Kingsley’s voice went hard, the look in his eyes almost urgent, imploring. “I’ve spent my whole adult life fighting dark wizards. I know what it’s like to go through hell. You don’t get through it on your own. All it does is sit and fester, and you might think you can handle it now, but you can’t in the long run. Take the advice. Seek help. Professional, if you don’t think your friends can do that for you. But if you do nothing with that anger and pain it’s going to eat you alive. I’ve seen it happen. One day, it will kill you.”
“What about—” His voice broke. Teddy looked up at him, a solemn furrow in his brow as he gummed at the bracelet. “What about their families? I know Goyle’s dad was killed in the war, but…”
“So you’re just assuming they’ll dismiss you?”
Harry nodded, taking another sip of his ale to give him time to shake himself out of the weird disconnect he suddenly felt. “Sure. That makes sense.”
A flash of white caught his eye. He turned then, breathless in his anticipation.
Kingsley wasn’t smiling, but there was something sad about his eyes now. Harry found it odd to think of Kingsley as he had been then—a double agent for the Order, protecting Sirius from the same Ministry he now led. The difference a few years could make…
had been the perfect way to make sure that Harry believed wholeheartedly that he was the right person to do it, to take up Dumbledore’s crusade. He’d further isolated Harry, telling him to keep his mission secret, to ignore the help offered to him by older, much more experienced wizards. But he couldn’t have told anyone else, could he? Because if Harry had told Molly or McGonagall or Remus, they would have objected right away to Dumbledore’s sending three
Jets of light arced through the smoke, green and red and black, magic electrifying the air. People were screaming and Harry searched for any sign of his friends but it was useless. The flow of the crowd moved toward the castle. Harry followed. Behind him the sounds of more fighting reached him. A wave of noise crashed over them—Grawp’s booming voice joined with the fierce pounding of hooves.
It was an empty promise, Harry’d known that for years, but sitting on Andromeda’s couch, wrapped in bandages and a few unlucky minutes from death, he wanted someone to protect him.
He managed to ground out,
It still slipped through, though, even if he knew they never meant it. He’d catch a look of awe in their eyes, a slight nervousness in the way they said something to him, or about him. He was the one who made plans, not joined them. He was the one at the front. Even with Ron and Hermione, he was the odd one out. But it had been all right. He’d taken it, knowing that one day everyone would realize he was just as stupid and weak and flawed as everyone else. More so, probably.
If his nightmares had been bad before, they were even worse now.
what she did. She was a kid. A child. And they killed her. If you think that’s fine, great, bully for you, but I will not accept that and I sure as hell won’t dance around and smile for the people who would justify doing that. I won’t stand there and let them use me as a fucking prop. I get enough of that from everyone else
“—warning, Mr. Potter,” Yeats said, hands braced against her desk. She’d gotten up at some point to glare down at Harry. “You’ve done this country a great service, but I won’t allow you to behave like—”
Harry laughed. “Only on Sundays.”
Harry jerked around just as he’d determined to leave, unable to ignore the boy who wouldn’t let him walk away.
Harry blinked, unclenched his hand from around the paper. He only then registered that Bill had said his name a few times, trying to get his attention.
“Only five?”
“It’s long overdue, I know, but you’ll have to forgive me, because I am, as it turns out, something of a coward. A dense coward, at that.”
Harry had never been good with feelings but this seemed pretty straight forward. He was in love or he wasn’t. He wanted her or he didn’t. And setting all of that aside, it was just sex. It shouldn’t have been this weird.
“We’re all cracking, Harry,” Ron said after a long pause, voice choked. “We all went through the same war, mate. I know you’re hurting—”
“You know what, Hermione, I didn’t get it before, but you’re right. Kids like that are very dangerous. Now I
“Most of those kids haven’t done anything.
him. And here it was, the horrible, glorious end he’d been waiting for.
Still Malfoy didn’t move. Harry knew he should close his eyes. Keeping them open this long would only increase the chances of someone seeing him and reacting before he was ready. He didn’t know yet his plan. He didn’t know what to do and he couldn’t think it through. It was as if he had abandoned his mind in the nebulous white expanse he’d witnessed after Voldemort’s Killing Curse struck him.
“Andromeda Tonks,” Harry whispered, voice shaking. “She—used to be a healer.”
He went tense as his body caught up to his mind, as they slammed back together and shattered inside his chest.
It became immediately obvious that Ginny knew what she was doing, and
(See the end of the chapter for
A taut string inside him snapped, cut—and it was all he could do to keep standing. He exhaled a moan as Tom licked a stripe up his palm, strands of emerald magic swirling in the air and twisting down into the heart of him.
His chest constricted like he’d been punched. “So—what? You want it to happen to someone else?”
dangerous, though. It just felt big. Bigger and older and, if he were being honest,
Where the two wands met, sparks flew thirty feet into the air. Voldemort’s lance of death-green dark magic rippled and bled, spitting huge licks onto the ground, every bit as nauseating and powerful as it had been in the graveyard where Harry had first seen the ghosts of his parents. It warped the air and sizzled where it melted stone, illuminated that horrible, waxy face so Harry could see all of him.
After a moment, Hermione scoffed. “Turned over? Please. I’m sure the entire property was seized as soon as they had the manpower to do it without anyone getting hurt.”
a little voice whispered into the back of his head.
He’d been given so many signs, from Dumbledore’s unreliable and fickle confidences to his willingness to trust a man who would have been happy to watch Harry die a long, painful death, from the past he’d kept secret so Harry didn’t know he had a history of viewing people as objects, as pawns, to the moment his own brother told Harry that Dumbledore didn’t give a rat’s ass about his life. Albus Dumbledore, the greatest wizard of his generation, of the last century, was first and foremost a clever, clever man. He had to know what he was doing. He
Harry kept his expression blank with a force of effort for which he thought he should be congratulated. “Did your grandson attend Hogwarts?”
He stepped away, the eyes of everyone in the Great Hall fixed on him. He cleared his throat and looked at Narcissa. Her grey eyes remained every bit as cold and bright as her son’s, her emotions locked tight behind her stony expression. She didn’t look as much like Bellatrix as Andromeda did.
Harry gripped the banister, listening to Ron pace for a while—and then the door opened, the sound of wind and cars and the city beyond rushing into this space of grim silence.
Before he could think of taking a shower though, his stomach contracted painfully, a fierce and distracting hunger making him groan out loud. He hadn’t felt this hungry in…years, actually. Not since he’d left the Dursleys’. Even on the run last year, he’d never starved. It might have been a slog to eat mushrooms for every meal, but he hadn’t minded. You learned not to mind the quality of your food when you were forced to watch other people eat while you stood in the corner.
The silence in the room was normal, but he couldn’t help the trickle of dread flowing down his spine.
“I just wish there was something…” Bill said quietly. “I can’t help but feel like he’s drifting away and we’re all just watching. It’s all I can do to keep my parents from dragging him back and locking him in the Burrow, but I don’t think he likes it here much more. Thought it might do him good to give him some space. Fleur and I have tried but…”
It was an elegant plan, now that Harry could look at it from a distance. Play on Harry’s need for approval, his desperation for someone to look after him, and insinuate himself into Harry’s life. Hell, he’d thrown Harry to the Dursleys and hadn’t that primed him for the moment someone finally decided to show him a kind smile and a blue-eyed wink behind half-moon spectacles? He had always said it was to protect Harry, to give him a normal life away from the spotlight and the hero worship he would have gotten were he raised as a wizard. To ensure his mother’s protection continued as long as possible. But you couldn’t deny that cutting Harry off from the Wizarding World made it a hell of a lot easier to mold him once Dumbledore finally stepped into his life. It’d kept him naive and ignorant. It’d kept him wounded. Because normal people wouldn’t just walk calmly to their deaths, would they? A normal, healthy person would balk at the idea of killing themselves, even if they knew it was the only way to save the people they loved.
All three aurors stared at him in silence, their expressions closed off and curious—even Proulx seemed to be eyeing him speculatively now.
He knew a bit about poltergeists, it was hard not to know
His mother had killed herself. Bloody hell.
A noise, faint and distant, caught his attention. It came with a strange sensation on the back of his neck, the hair rising like he’d just gotten a chill. There again, only this time it was much louder.
Untethered.
“Did you also ask Bill to tell the rest of us to piss off and leave you alone?”
The auror’s face hardened as he took a step back. Harry was filled with a fierce sense of vindication at seeing the hero worship leak out of his eyes. Well fuck. Maybe he should be an arsehole more often. To some people, maybe.
“Oh, don’t you worry. I’m up to watch the meteor shower, of course.”
Harry blinked, alarmed, when Malfoy said nothing else. When he remained politely quiet.
he realized with a rush of feeling. Arcs of it radiated around him, spreading light like a lighthouse through fog, flooding him with energy and fight and pure, unadulterated determination to
For a long moment they all stood in silence. Even Teddy went quiet, only humming pensively as he mouthed at the collar of Sirius’s jacket. Or, Harry’s jacket now, he supposed.
The onslaught of yellow and green flame glanced harmlessly up into the air, scoring the rock over their heads. Voldemort’s red eyes widened in fury and shock but before he could attack again three distinct curses bombarded him, one each sent by McGonagall, Slughorn, and Kingsley.
Goyle’s body jerked upright and Harry nearly threw up. He closed his eyes, forced himself to concentrate on not dropping—the body. Goyle’s body.
But all of his fits had led to something real. None of them had been unfounded, even when they’d been used against him. Every time his scar had hurt, every time he’d seen something in his dreams or in his mind, it had come true in some way.
He had the horrible thought that perhaps it was connected to what he’d done to kill Voldemort. He hadn’t cast a spell then either, just let his magic flow through him. Maybe some door had opened and now he’d never be able to control himself again.
fought
I don’t—I don’t know how you could think this is acceptable. I don’t know why you’d
His dream that night came on slowly. The world was white and soft. The sound of waves washing against sand filtered in gradually and soon he could see the ocean—tipped in white lace and colored the turquoise of Teddy’s hair.
It felt like a shard of ice through his ribs. He closed his eyes, trying not to lose it entirely. When he opened them another figure had joined the others, standing behind Malfoy.
And yet Harry’d been the one who spoke out first.
Harry took another drink of his ale instead of commenting.
“Were there,” Harry swallowed, “any injuries? Are they…”
He should have guessed.
“It’s been a nightmare, to tell you the truth, but,” Percy cleared his throat, “well, that’s war for you.”
So instead of leaving, he did the one thing he knew he shouldn’t do.
When they were all gone, and it was just Harry, Bill, and Andromeda, Harry felt a little like all the strings holding him up had been cut. He sat down heavily, swallowing a grunt of pain. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Andromeda approach, Bill take a few paces away from him before he turned back.
when Bill cursed on the other side of the table.
Fred was gone, and he didn’t know how to grieve for him—brother, friend, family, it all felt wrong, no word truly fit. He wasn’t a part of their family in the ways it mattered. And he knew that was absolute shite but he didn’t know how to feel anything else.
He didn’t want to ask for a family. He was so tired of asking people to love him.
Kingsley looked surprised. It was maybe the second time Harry had ever seen the man slip in his composure. “Of course,” he said after a long moment of silence.
When he felt Ron and Hermione waiting for him to continue, his face flushed. “What was I supposed to do? Just walk away and ignore him?”
Malfoy flinched, face going soft, showing a sliver of weakness, just as powerful as if Malfoy had shouted back at him. He didn’t drop Harry’s gaze. If anything, he seemed determined to hold it too.
“I wore a suit to your wedding.”
just leave Goyle here.
Loup, he knew—wolf. The second sounded familiar, but he didn’t know why. Hadn’t—Kamau said Goyle might have been under the effects of a potion which simulated the effects of lycanthropy? Maybe he was just trying to find something to think about other than the obvious, disappointing truth, but he thought…
why the Wizengamot asked me and Hermione Granger here today, because you need people who everyone admires to agree with you to make it look like you’ve got your act together. Get a few war heroes in here to support your policies and it’s a lot easier to pretend you’re making things better. Pity, then, that I happen to disagree. I’ve got a bit of a soft spot for kids, you see. I happen to think using them to scare their parents and families into cooperation feels a bit wrong.”
Daphne joined Edlefina on the other side of the atrium, pressing a comforting hand to her back. A group of Slytherin girls lingered, though he could only recognize Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson. Pansy was studiously not meeting his gaze, looking twitchy, while Millicent was staring daggers at him.
He managed to stay present, to keep listening to Robards, but only because Teddy was sitting on his lap, his tiny, warm, ferociously alive body making it harder to disconnect from reality.
Robards kept watching as the echo performed the same hand motion required for the Flippendo spell, and then produced a ghostly imitation of a Stunning Spell and Shield Charm.
There was a smile in the voice now, a direction. A cruel smile. Coming from behind him. Above him. His fingers brushed something cold, something white and curved. He pulled, dragged it out from the leaves. It was bone. No…the curved tip of an antler.
“Bleeding goblins,” Charlie muttered, still treating Harry to an oddly intent look. “I really can’t believe they haven’t been taken to court for that. Using dragons as guard dogs. Fucking monsters.”
The man nodded toward Bill and stepped back into the room.
Anyway. I know I have a toooon of comments to respond to, and I will try to catch up here in the next few days. I do read them, even if it takes me months to respond sometimes. Your incredibly kind response to this story has made me find the time and energy to keep working on it, and I am so grateful. Y'all are kind as fuck, and I Appreciate You.

“You have to realize what people are going to think when they read this! And over something
Harry stared at a photograph of himself standing across a busy intersection, looking off to the side but not looking at anything as his hair blew slightly in the wind—the longest piece nearly brushed his chin. His eyes were vacant and hard at the same time, something pained about his expression. As he watched, a crease showed in his brow. He seemed so young. Which was insane, considering it’d been taken only a few weeks ago. He’d been through worse.
He set his forehead above his arm for leverage as his back bowed, lips opening on a strangled gasp. He increased his pace, ignoring the usual embarrassment he felt whenever he’d committed this much before. The sound of wet slapping was almost obscene in the newly calm quiet of the house. It was building faster now, the sweet pressure in his stomach more intense, more hot. God, it was like he was rising atop a geyser.
And then it was gone. He felt just as he had before the flash, tired, sore, and fatigued in a muted, low burning throb.
Collapsing, heart pounding like he’d just ran up a mountain, he let another wash of fatigue pull him back down.
“You ungrateful
It was just an empty hallway of black tile leading down to a black door but he couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had just been watching him. There was a weird blank space in the air too but he didn’t know if that was his eyes adjusting to the dim light or—
“Hold on,” Harry said, a memory springing up out of nowhere, “was Van Buren the first year who got his nose stuck in a Christmas popper? Walked around for a week before the holidays shooting out confetti when he sneezed?”
“He was lowering his wand,” Harry said quietly. “When Snape and the other death eaters came up to the Astronomy Tower. He was lowering his wand. He seemed—afraid. I’m not saying he’s not guilty of trying, but I don’t think he wanted to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore didn’t think so, at any rate.”
She narrowed her eyes at him, a haughtiness showing there as if she couldn’t help it. “Do you?”
When his fingers touched Kreacher’s shoulder, the elf startled and nearly fell off the ledge.
It took Harry a while to work past his surprise. Kreacher wanted time off? Obviously, he could have as much as he liked. Harry would have offered before this if he thought Kreacher was inclined to the idea.
And really was this so much crazier than everything else which had happened to him the past few weeks? At least this was nice. A definite improvement in this house, which he was very likely to never leave again. He eyed the room warily, still waiting for a poltergeist to pop out of the mirror and strangle him with the new curtain. The room smelled like mint and lemon, clean and bright and soothing.
He had to force himself to keep tracing Regulus’s notes. Regulus turned then to bigger, more theoretical concepts, which Harry struggled to follow. Here a Russian (or Polish, he still had no idea—it might be some other Slavic language for all he knew) book seemed to cause Regulus quite a lot of frustration, but he’d taken to writing in whatever that language was, just like with the German book. Harry only gleaned a few things from the sparse English phrases;

Chapter 5 Songs:
“Speaking of,” Charlie leaned over the table conspiratorially, “I heard you’d been signed to the Wimbourne Wasps.”
The silence in Andromeda’s sitting room was painful. Harry held Robards’s gaze, seeing in his eyes the indignation and outrage of Scrimgeor before him, and Fudge before him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally, soft footsteps answered him, scuffing amongst the broken stones. Harry listened intently as one by one they approached, light and broken as they walked through the center of the courtyard.
He’d gained…something when he bled into, or activated, as he’d come to think of it, the book, but it wasn’t a clear translation. It was a way of thinking, of seeing his body as a tool and his blood as the form of transportation for his magic. Not so much something received as something revealed. Like he’d been covering his eyes with his hand his whole life and there was suddenly light peeking through the cracks of his fingers.
Harry jerked upright, sheets tangled around him. He was drenched in sweat. He gasped for breath, bending over as his chest throbbed from his barely healed ribs. His room was dark, the only sounds his own breathing and the quiet, ever present creaking of Grimmauld Place around him. He fumbled for his wand on the bedside table only to see it light up on the other side of the room, peeking out from the bottom of his dirty jeans. The light blossomed bright enough for the room to pulse with a soft, blue-white glow. It was comforting. It reminded him of his patronus.
Ron knew what it was to fight, but he didn’t know what it was to fight knowing he would die. That if he didn’t let himself be killed, he’d be responsible for the lives of everyone he’d ever cared about. That if he failed, people he didn’t even know would die by the hundreds, the thousands.
He pushed his hair off his face, dirt and sweat and blood coating his palm, getting stuck in his hair. He took another few steps up the staircase.
Harry was trying to scream, but he had no breath, he couldn’t breathe. His legs kicked uselessly. Another knee to his thigh. Goyle let out a choked growl and slammed his right hand down again and again, breaking bones. It sounded like glass shattering. Like Dumbledore’s fragile instruments tumbling to the floor—
So he got up, showered, organized his things to see what he’d brought with him and what he’d left at the Burrow and Shell Cottage, and sat down to write to Andromeda and Bill. As the two pieces of parchment were swallowed up in the floo, he struggled for a moment about whether he should write Hermione and Ron.
“Yeah,” Ron said, harsh, “and you just killed the most powerful dark wizard in the last century. I don’t see how him being our age excuses him from being an evil git. It’s not like
“Be careful, is all,” Harry added lamely, growing more uncomfortable under Malfoy’s piercing scrutiny. “Or don’t. Whatever.”
She looked for a moment like she wasn’t going to let him off that easy, but something in his eyes must have convinced her, because she just pursed her lips and nodded. “If that’s what you want.”
There were still people who wanted to hurt him, and this house seemed to be the last place he had to fall back on. He wasn’t out of the woods because Voldemort was dead, and if he was ever going to figure his life out, he needed somewhere he could relax, where he could sleep without wondering if someone was going to try to destroy his building. He needed somewhere he felt safe. Hogwarts had been that for him, once, but Hogwarts was closed, and Harry didn’t know if the castle had been ruined for him completely. He hoped not. Regardless, he wasn’t going to be able to stay there forever, even if he could go back when it finally re-opened. If he wanted to go back.
His eyes came to rest on the scattered notes, the worn and ill-kept books, the handwriting he could recognize even if it’d been years since he’d last seen it.
Draco Malfoy walked—no,
Malfoy?” His voice broke on the first corner of a sob. “What could you
Harry was fine and then he wasn’t? Then he went off or freaked out or grew cold?
“Why?” Harry asked, urgent, grabbing the thread of thought and
He had dreamed of

heard this voice break before—
He wouldn’t move.
Robards would have to announce Goyle’s death at some point. He might be keeping it quiet to protect Harry and uphold the facade of order the Ministry had achieved during the trials, but he wouldn’t cover it up, not for long.
He knew what people would think, what his
Malfoy jerked back, bald fear overtaking his blank expression. Lucius jumped and yelped. Narcissa rose—
“You know,” Luna continued, looking far too earnest and just a bit concerned, “sex? I’m talking about—”
Another barrier rose and hummed, layering its toneless harmony onto the first. Fresh green and yellow light spread out from his hands and curled up from the steam where his blood ran along the sigil.
Did Goyle even have any family left? His father’d been a death eater, but as far as he knew, Goyle Sr. had died sometime before the Battle of Hogwarts. What about his mother? He had one, presumably. The thought of Goyle’s nameless mother sitting in a cold, dark house, waiting for her son to return—
“It’s nothing. Seriously, it’s not—” Harry swallowed the knot in his throat. “It’s nothing.”
“Playing professionally?”
He threaded his hands behind his neck, stretching—and then an idea cut through the static. He checked the time and winced. It was probably too late, but he could try. He felt some glimmer of hope for the first time in twenty-four hours and he knew he’d stay up all night if he didn’t do something. He knelt by the fireplace and picked up a dash of floo powder, certainty making his heart beat a bit slower.
“I did,” Percy said. “They asked me back. Figured I could try to undo some of my own mistakes.” He stopped rather abruptly in front of the lift. If people hadn’t already been moving around them like water around a boulder, he might have caused a pile up. With an air of hard-earned determination, he turned to Harry and said stiffly, “I owe you an apology, Harry.”
Harry stared up at Madam Yeats, wondering if he’d only imagined her emphasis on their supposed transparency. He’d been listening closely to everything she’d said today, trying to match this rather even-keeled woman with the person who’d decided it was a good idea frighten children so their parents would fall in line.
Harry opened his eyes again.
Harry nodded, swallowing tightly. “He only just woke up.”
Harry wondered if he shouldn’t try to stay out of it. He’d thought about this a bit already, and he’d decided not to interfere in anything when it came to Ron and Hermione’s relationship. He’d had enough of being a go-between during school. He sympathized with Ron, really, but it sounded like Hermione needed this. And he couldn’t exactly blame her for wanting to connect with her family, to take some time away.
“Kreacher!” Harry managed to catch him before he could do himself a serious injury, letting go at once. “What the—”
Draco’s curse flew under her guard and slammed into her chest.
Bill turned to Andromeda as he scrubbed a hand through his hair. He was still wearing his Ministry robes, but there was blood on his collar and tie. Harry’s blood. “I can’t thank you enough, Andromeda. Truly.”
Out of the corner of his eye he caught Hermione looking at him, trying to draw his gaze. He rose and walked past her without so much as turning his head, up to the center of the chamber. There was no chair this time, just a simple dais facing the senior officers of the court, Madam Yeats, Percy in his old job as the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, the court scribe, a squat man with ludicrously yellow hair and wide glasses which swallowed his whole face, and, of course, Kingsley.
“Excuse me,” a small voice cut her off.
“He did.”

Kamau just watched him, mouth tightening.
The moment he said it, he realized it was true. Malfoy had interrupted her, and then he had proceeded to insult her until she left. He’d been an ass about it later, but he’d clearly done it for some reason. He could have just let the old woman prattle on for a few minutes and watched Harry suffer through another tedious conversation.
He blacked out.
“Thought not.” Bill moved to let Harry through into the hall, Andromeda following with Teddy in her arms. “Merlin’s beard, Teddy’s gotten big.”
And these were still kids.
He still wasn’t sure what happened in the Forbidden Forest, when things had gone dark, and then viscerally, violently, white.
Regulus had noted how it was best to be careful that the soul of one’s victim remained in its body to ensure the full effect of the curse, that the human soul could attempt to save itself by burying deep into the human psyche, to effectively lobotomize itself in the case of extreme psychological or emotional damage, thereby rendering any curse focused on the mind to become null and void.
“What?” he said, not kindly, as he stopped and looked back.
“I’ll be here when you get back,” Bill said, voice flat. “Obviously.”
He wasn’t one of them. Not really.
As the lights flicked on, Hermione said sharply,
“Yeah, they, er,” Harry said, feeling strangely conflicted, “they brought me in for informal questioning. Today was all Hogwarts students.”
Robards?”
With every ring activated, the others grew brighter—white light threaded through with spring green, bringing a scent of trees and open air, a potential, a kind of ecstatic violence. It made his brown skin look almost gold in the light.
Hermione’d said the same thing only yesterday.
He trailed off and went very still. His large, red-rimmed eyes blinked rapidly, a look of confusion passing over his face.
He was stalling. He needed to just get in the floo and go. This wasn’t going to get any easier the longer he stood there feeling like a prat.
And if he couldn’t even trust Kingsley anymore, he wasn’t going to trust Robards.
Harry could sense the attention of everyone around them in the relative silence of the atrium. It felt like a vice clamping around his neck.
Harry held Malfoy’s gaze until people stepped out of the Great Hall—Ron, Bill, Ginny, followed by Narcissa. He couldn’t look at any of them, only Malfoy. He glared down at Malfoy and fought to keep hold of his anger, to keep hold of himself.
“Seems like as good a time as any,” she continued, “with school not starting back up until next year. And I think my parents—” She frowned, shaking her head. “I think they want to spend time with me too. Away from—this.”
Harry laughed, shifting in his chair, color warming his neck. “Right. ‘Good.’ The last two I met nearly killed me.”
didn’t want to learn how to defend ourselves because no one else would.
Harry didn’t know if he imagined it or not but noise in the room dropped perceptibly. His hand sweated, palm clammy over the hawthorn wand in his pocket. A lump formed in his throat as he stopped in front of them. Why had he walked over here? To fucking Malfoy and his death eater parents?
Suddenly fearful, Harry got quickly to his feet and went to Sirius’s room. The door looked freshly polished and for a moment Harry didn’t want to open it, he didn’t want to see the room with bare walls and clean carpets and windows which let in light. He wanted it to be exactly the same. Even if it hurt, he wanted…
“Hey,” Harry said, asking before he could convince himself not to, “you haven’t heard of something called an Anilex Orb, have you?”
“No,” Harry said quietly, “that’d be you, wouldn’t it?”
Harry flushed at his own urgency to ask a question which would likely get him hexed, angry at the continued disinterest in Malfoy’s face, and thrust the hawthorn wand out.
“Right,” Charlie laughed. “Common name, isn’t it?”
Harry felt his stomach drop. Until that moment, he’d been able to convince some part of him that Malfoy had been lying, playing it up, trying to mess with Harry’s head—but he saw it in Bill’s eyes. He saw the flicker of shame, the same discomfort Harry felt in the twist of his mouth. It was all true. And Bill knew how wrong it was.
“Harry, this is ridiculous,” Hermione muttered. “You don’t even know if it’s—”
“I’m the only one who gets that kind of special treatment. The others only have to check in every three days.”
“No, course not,” Bill muttered. “Not to me, anyway.”
He was sitting down to breakfast with Bill and Fleur on a sunny Saturday in mid-July, pouring himself another cup of coffee—Fleur had turned him on to it and it wasn’t long before he was taking two or three cups every morning, teaching him the difference between the three ways of brewing she alternated between, because there was apparently a full world of knowledge surrounding coffee that he had never known because he’d only ever reluctantly drank tea because that’s just what you did as a good upstanding Brit, but Merlin’s pants, if coffee, strong and black and dosed with sugar, wasn’t fucking
marking oneself with runes to shield against possession by malevolent spirits, though Regulus seemed to think it more a binding of your soul to your body in an attempt to strengthen the bond between the two, a kind of enchantment placed permanently on your body to allow a witch or wizard better protection against malevolent forces. Here, Harry got caught again, because in the margins Regulus had written,
It really wasn’t, but it wasn’t so abnormal either. Plenty of wizards lost control of their magic from time to time, in situations of extreme danger or fatigue—like mothers lifting cars off children. When pushed, magic could express itself in all sorts of volatile ways.
“You should set up a marquee, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, finally shifting to stare indolently down at him over the bridge of his sharp nose. “Charge a fee. Ten knuts for some hair, fifteen for a fingernail clipping, twenty for a quick tug on the old—”
Kamau asked, “And why would Dumbledore do that? It’s my understanding that Draco Malfoy was implicated in two other nearly fatal incidents at Hogwarts that year, and if his family’s allegiances were well known before this, I fail to see why anyone would expect he’d have second thoughts.” Her eyes flicked up to meet Harry’s, not accusing but attentive. “Seems like a pretty big chance to take on someone who, in your own words, had shown darker inclinations before this.”
His eyes were still tired, but Harry was the one who’d been crying now. And for an infinitely small slice of a moment, he also wanted to ask—
Harry kept staring down at the rug, a horrible, gnawing emptiness slipping down the cavity of his chest and settling at the bottom of his stomach like sediment in a dark body of water. Tugging him down with a heavy, horrible weight.
Harry wasn’t sure why he was angry, or why this was making him feel like his skin was too tight for his bones, but he couldn’t get the image of Ravenna Lamar out of his head—
“I didn’t say you were. Clearly, it worked.” A pause. “The Fidelius Charm is incredibly complex. I’m impressed. There aren’t many wizards who could do the same.”
At best, Robards was being naive. No one in their right mind who’d been through what Harry’d been through the past three years would trust the Ministry of Magic for any kind of protection. Even if Harry did think the Ministry had his best intentions at heart, which he most certainly did not, Harry would be stupid to think they could do more than slow down whatever was coming for him next.
“Not gonna try
His gaze fell first on Parkinson. Face pinched and slightly pinked, the bags under her eyes were so prominent her make-up couldn’t hide them. She’d lost a lot of weight, and her face was now sharp where she’d only ever been round before. She had her hand in her mouth, biting her nails, eyes flicking nervously around the room. It looked like she was bouncing her leg up and down.
“I’m confused, see, because if that’s not why you wanted me here, I’m thinking maybe you wanted me to lend these trials and your sentencing credibility, no matter what I thought. But that couldn’t possibly be why, right
“Not all of us wanted—,” she said too quickly, pausing. Her face went red but she held his gaze. “We weren’t all on—
“Of course. Of course it’s you.”
“Are his parents…?” Harry realized suddenly that he had no idea what happened to Malfoy and his parents after he’d apparated away. He’d assumed they’d been brought in to the Ministry, but it’s not like he checked.
He was just—nervous, maybe. He was just—inventing things. He’d had fits so often over his life, maybe this was just another…
God, that felt like another life.
“I think—my magic just reacted. I don’t know. I’ve never—that’s never happened to me before. I’ve cast spells I didn’t mean to, one time it wasn’t even one I knew, but never
A strangled laugh bubbled up in his throat. “Something else?” he managed.
“I was just surprised, that’s all,” Harry muttered after a moment. “Never thought you’d do anything to go against your family.”
Just under his right elbow his skin neatly split, running nearly five inches before it stopped. A line of blood welled up and fell, steaming where it met the sigil. It brought power, though, and with it Harry shoved the interference away. Exhilaration flooded through him and he pressed forward, his words growing stronger and faster. He could feel it now, how the ancient cleansing spell was spreading out from him and into the rest of the house, crawling up from the foundations to cover every surface and nook, every dusty hallway and mold-ridden banister. He felt all the places which had been hidden for so long, the darkened corners and the rooms tucked away so as to preserve them. He felt the lingering emptiness of the house rise up from the ground—its isolation and pain when Sirius had come back only to rip it apart and treat it like it meant nothing.
What the
Harry looked down at his ale, frowning. Malfoy had made the same joke. He didn’t know why it bothered him so much. It was the plan, after all. Join the Aurors’ Office. Keep fighting dark wizards. He’d known people would be grateful to him, but it seemed like the world had decided to treat him like he knew everything when it came to this stuff. Like he wasn’t an eighteen-year-old kid who hadn’t even finished school. Shouldn’t he be more experienced? Why the hell did they think he was ready to just slide into that kind of a job, a kind of job that regularly dealt with peoples’ lives?
have been happy, brilliantly, wonderfully, happy to be given a life he was never meant to have, he wasn’t. He wasn’t upset but he wasn’t staring into the future with hope and determination. More like he was staring down an oncoming storm.
The door clicked open of its own accord. He swallowed the tight knot in his throat and forced himself inside—and a sob broke from his lips.
As Harry sat there, staring up at the dark ceiling of this hidden room, he wanted nothing more than to send an owl for Hermione. She’d know where to start. She’d know how to figure out what it meant that he, Harry, had been a living horcrux his whole life, how that must have changed him. She’d know what to make of all of this. He could picture her, her face done up in determination with a fierce light in her eyes, ready to lose herself in a pile of books like she was charging into battle.
Harry stared, remembering vividly Rufus Scrimgeour mentioning Robards’s name when he was trying to tempt Harry into working with the Ministry. “Pleasure to meet you as well. Sir,” he added as an after thought.
won’t let them.
Harry was trying to pay attention as Charlie explained what he was doing which would take him out of Britain for at least eight months in the fall, trying to find something called an Ottoman Jewelclaw, a breed of dragon thought to have gone extinct around the time of the fall of Constantinople. Apparently everyone in Romania thought he was crazy, “loveably mad,” Charlie had said with a snort—so he was planning on backpacking around the Black Sea on his own to follow up on the few sightings which had reached Charlie, but Harry found it hard to stay present.
At least half the names were surprises and there was one bloke in Ravenclaw who had apparently tested a few dangerous new hexes out on the younger kids whom he’d never even heard of.
“No, they wouldn’t want to tell you,” Malfoy said slowly, voice heavy, almost musing. Harry’s chest tightened. “Not when they need your stamp of approval. Smarts, does it, knowing your people can be every bit as—”
As if it could hear him, the plant rustled, a few of the flowers turning toward him and doing something like a dance. That scent wafted over him again, and this time he found it pleasantly warm. He cleared his throat as it became too strong, growing smoky again and carrying a thread of spice and citrus, reminding him for some reason of tea and mist and leather.
And like a specter in the back of his mind, he thought of the girl killed in a fire fight with trained aurors at least twice her age. She would have been scared too.
“I can’t tell them,” Harry whispered.
“Because your lunatic aunt—” He faltered at Malfoy’s flinch, swallowed a knot of guilt. “Because she was torturing my friend and Voldemort was about to come find me and kill me,” Harry said slowly, still through gritted teeth. “Or did you forget that part? So yeah, I fucking took your wand. And now I’m giving it back. Because what am I supposed to do with your cast off?”
Harry looked away when he spotted a group of people coming out of the lifts, Bill among them.
He still felt like a complete ass when he stepped out of the floo in a coughing fit. The huge black atrium was just as polished and clean as it had been the last time he was here, though there were less propaganda posters hanging on the wall. Just as imposing and official. It was still packed with witches and wizards going about their day, but there was something hushed about it all, like someone had cast
“Of course. It was—of course. You should know that he was poisoned with something I’ve never seen before. Luckily, Harry only got a small dose and Bill got him here quickly, but it could have been lethal, would have been if I hadn’t caught it as soon as I did. I’d be careful if you—come across any more of it.” She stumbled over the truth, that Robards would only find more if he’d searched Goyle’s body. “I’ll take Teddy into the other room, then. If you need anything else—”
He stood amongst crumbled rocks, took in the twisted metal railing, the broken glass scattered here and there across the floor, the wide open view of the grounds beneath him—the Astronomy Tower. He had apparated to the Astronomy Tower.
His eyes caught on a piece of paper sticking out of one of the books. The handwriting was…familiar. Part of it, anyway.
He really, truly, had no idea what he was doing. Just like he’d had no idea why he’d returned the hawthorn wand to Malfoy in the Great Hall, in front of all those people. It was like part of him just shut off as he did something that, objectively, made no sense—defending Draco Malfoy was something he would never actively choose to do, and yet here he was, feeling a weird, irrational anger toward this tosser. On Malfoy’s behalf.
He hadn’t realized the sun had gone down.
risking his life fighting
They were all staring at him, waiting. It struck him right then that he didn’t feel like he used to when older witches and wizards, people he trusted and respected, would turn to him to ask what he was doing, what he needed from them. It used to make him want to prove himself, to live up to the expectation he saw in their eyes. How many times had he asked to be treated like an adult, not wanting to be babied or coddled? Dumbledore had trusted Harry—why wasn’t that enough for everyone else? He used to think it was insulting for anyone to assume he wouldn’t be able to do what needed to be done. He used to get so angry…
If he couldn’t go back to Hogwarts, what the hell was he supposed to do?
He hated that he was feeling this now, in the aftermath of murdering someone. It was frightening as hell, knowing now how easily he could lose this. He didn’t want to associate this moment with doing something so unforgivable. Part of him wanted to go back to the bed and lie down so he couldn’t infect Teddy, like it was an illness and Harry was contagious.
“That makes no bloody sense, Harry,” Ron said, throwing out his hands in frustration. “What does that have to do with Kingsley—”
Would he have done the same to her? He’d seen people under the Imperius Curse, under a love potion. He couldn’t believe what he’d done was anything close to that.
“Before Master Regulus is ordering Kreacher to take him back to the—cave,” Kreacher said, his voice wavering, “he is asking Kreacher to hide some of his things from Mistress Walburga and Master Orion, in case he…in case…” Kreacher’s voice broke a bit, and he had to take a moment to compose himself. “When Master Regulus is not returning, when he is ordering Kreacher to leave, Kreacher is doing as he asked.”
“It does, doesn’t it?” She huffed and tipped back the rest of her drink, wincing. “Ugh. I don’t know why you find this enjoyable.”
A dark figure appeared beside him so close he flinched. A knuckle brushed softly against his cheek, a perversion of the same gesture which used to bring him comfort, make him feel safe and loved when it came from— But coming from—
Harry had—
Harry swallowed and looked over Bill’s shoulder. Bill followed his gaze, his whole body tensing when he saw Goyle’s unmoving body.
“You know who else expected blind faith and cooperation, who hated dissent and punished those who dared to question what he was doing?
Dumbledore, in all his quiet machinations, all his scheming, all his subtle manipulations of people into the web of his grand, silent war, had never counted on Harry coming back a second time.
Yes, he was keeping secrets. But this was bigger, surely.
On his fourth day of questioning Hermione joined him, looking wary but stubborn—wearing the same expression he recognized from school whenever she’d been building up to chastising him or challenging him on something. She tried to talk about the fight in the Leaky Cauldron, but Harry shook her off once he realized she had no interest in hearing him out. She didn’t press the issue beyond a few pointed, heavy looks, but Harry knew she wasn’t satisfied. Probably wanted to wait until after the trials were over to bring it up again. Ron hadn’t been asked to come in for questioning much, and Harry saw little enough of him as it was. Which was fine. Hermione might be insufferably unwilling to let anything go, but she at least tried to pretend things weren’t weird. Ron would sulk until one of them caved, and Harry didn’t feel like engaging with him right now.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t human. He was a mistake. A flaw in the plan. He was what happened when brilliant men trusted too much in their own cleverness and didn’t take into account that the universe was a hell of a lot crueler and more chaotic than they thought.
He looked down, dragged the toe of his trainers along the white groove between black tiles. He should have bought nicer shoes. He had bought a bloody television but he hadn’t thought to buy shoes without holes in them.
“Let’s begin with a summary of your testimony you have already given to Ministry officials,” she said after a while, settling back into her chair and look down at him from the bridge of her nose.
his magic. It was so fragile, so precious, this thing that came from inside him and out of the air, up from the ground, shaped by his own words.
Her eyes went dark, and her voice dropped. “It’s not that simple.”
all of which confirmed the connection between soul and body, how a wizard must ensure a strong harmony between his mental, emotional, and physical self before attempting to fight with his magic. How mastery over one’s physical self ensured mastery over one’s opponent.
cry. He whirled around for a sign of her, ducked a curse shot over his head as he kept running into the throng. A horrible laugh cut through the noise and Bellatrix emerged through the crowd, grinning as she battled Ginny, Luna, and Hannah Abbott.
“You should tell someone about the cuffs,” Harry said, a bit more rough than he intended. “They’re barbaric.”
He shouldn’t be both. Either he was a broken shell of a person or he was whole and hurting. He wasn’t natural, he was something horrifying, but he was still screaming inside just like a normal human, and he didn’t know
“Well, that’s great. Those are a nightmare to break, and that’s without any dragon bones.”
“I know I don’t.” Gently, she turned him around with a soft push. “I’ll put something together for you.”
He jerked back in panic and lost his footing again. He blinked—and Riddle was gone.
Ron, who had never died, only to come back tainted with the shadow of a man so evil even death didn’t want him, who had never walked to his death, knowing there was nothing left for him to do but give over
Bill looked up at him sharply, eyes red and skin pale under his freckles and scars. “You didn’t do this to yourself. You have nothing to be sorry for.” It looked like he was forcing himself to calm down. He grimaced. “Merlin’s pants, Harry. Apologizing for getting attacked. Only you…” He exhaled and straightened up. “But I do need to know what happened.”
Harry nodded as he took his seat, getting the distinct impression from Proulx that he had very little intention of letting Harry off easy. With thick black hair streaked with grey and impenetrable blue eyes so dark they might as well be black, sharp, aristocratic features marred by more than a few scars, and a lean frame which Harry guessed would unfold into an even greater height than Robards, the man looked like he would be just at home in an opera house or cage fight. There was even a scar running through the left side of his mouth, under the groomed mustache.
things. Ron was already there, seeming perfectly content to settle into working at the shop with George. Hermione had a year to travel and throw herself into projects while she waited to return to Hogwarts.
“We were talking about your new flat,” Harry said, hiding his grin behind his mug. “How
The room went very quiet, suffused with a knowing sympathy. Harry tried not to let it drag him down further, but really, how much further down could he go?
“Sorry, Harry,” Bill said from the doorway, voice low. He sounded tired. “It’s better if we do this now, I think.”
Harry held his gaze, heard the shift in Malfoy’s tone. He knew what Malfoy meant and he was still unable to come up with any reason that didn’t make him want to scream until his throat was bloody.
“That will happen from time to time,” Tom Riddle said in a smooth, liquid voice, strangely echoing as if from another room. “Petty little ghosts rising up out of the darkness. So many broken things wind up here, Harry. So many small, weak things. Some of them are bound to want blood.”
mother.”
Harry didn’t stop the tears from falling. They were part of this, all of it, he knew. This was his power,
“NO—no, sorry,” Harry said quickly, raising his other hand palm out. “I wasn’t—sorry. I was just going to give this back to you.” His heart beat hard but he held Malfoy’s gaze.
The book opened with a simple cleansing ritual, variations on one theme branching off into two categories—that of the living, and that of the inert. Living here meant something which could act of its own will, and the inert as something acted upon. Harry guessed the line between the two was somewhat slippery, but he grasped the basic concept.
“I just meant he wasn’t supposed to be talking to anyone, especially not you.” The auror leaned in like Malfoy wasn’t even there and whispered, “This here’s Draco Malfoy, you know, son of—”
“I…sorry,” Harry muttered, closing the door, “didn’t realize. I was upstairs.” The silence sealed shut and they were left in what felt like a small bubble. A pocket of tension. Harry wanted nothing more than to lie down and sleep for another three days, but he knew this had to happen sometime. Might as well do it now.
It was a ring. A large ring with a thick band, threads of differently-colored metals twisting around it in patterns so complex it gave the impression that the band was a living, undulating thing. Harry picked it up slowly, surprised by how cool it felt to the touch. On the flattened face there was some kind of crest surrounding a cameo of what might be a dog or a wolf. Frowning, Harry tried to read the tiny letters, seeing only that it was a phrase written in a script he didn’t recognize, a motto of an old house, maybe.
his bloody mind.
Kingsley’s chest expanded slowly but his expression didn’t falter. “I’ve discussed it with her. She won’t be pressing charges either.”
anything to him besides give him a general sense of malign interest. It was watching him, and it went beyond the strange chills he sometimes felt walking through barely-used rooms or past cabinets filled with old Black family treasures. This wasn’t the house. The house still seemed to like him, or tolerate him, but there was something else with him now. Kreacher had been no help either, still confused and unwell. Harry had told him to stop working so he could rest, and, perhaps most alarming of all, he’d listened, and not simply because he was compelled to do so.
It hadn’t quite hit home yet, though. Not until tonight. He felt an echo of the certainty he’d gained after Dumbledore’s funeral, the knowledge that there was no one else who could shield him. No one else he’d
His eyes were raw. His throat burned. His guilt came back with a vengeance, like fiendfyre surging up in his chest.
Harry swallowed the morbid urge to laugh.
Kamau just smiled and winked at him, flicking her gaze to Bill and then, presumably, Andromeda where she was standing in the kitchen doorway.
“Yeah. He seemed all right, actually. Bit of a stiff, but nice.”
The sixth barrier sprang into place, and everything went quiet.
The book which had warmed slightly to his touch, with a symbol he hadn’t been able to read, was an almost exact copy of the book he’d found in the green box. Carefully, he set them side by side, placing the box on the floor. Both of them had covers made of wood, their symbols different enough to notice, though they were clearly done to a pair. The book from the green box was a light, buttery shade of yellow with slight wavelike patterns in the wood. The writing looked like it had been just barely cut into the surface and traced with a very faint hint of green ink.
Decent. Sure.
“That was
he told himself out loud, resuming his pacing, toweling his head off in an attempt to shake the thought from his mind along with the rest of the water from his hair.
“All right, then,” he muttered and, too tired to be more startled that his own house had just
A few murmurs swept through the crowd, packed with wizards and witches in thick black and dark navy robes. Some sounded impressed, approving, some frustrated.
And what did that mean for Harry now that the other half of his doomed bond was finally gone?
“Do it.” Malfoy says with clenched teeth. “What are you waiting for? Do it.” Harry punches the floor next to Draco and looks at him. His eyes are watery and his breathing is fast.
“Just something to think about.” she says and stands up taking Ron by the hand.
“Well, you did save my life.” Harry points out. “Back at the Manor. You recognized me. But you didn't say anything.”
Ron turns to Harry with a horrified expression.
“You are so unwilling to get your head out of your arse that you get out of your way to act like a complete jackass in front of everyone just to you make them believe that you are above everything.
At the end of the class, professor Bagley clears her throat, which catches Harry's attention and smiles.
“Mixed-” Harry rubs his forehead exasperatedly and sits on a chair.
Hermione Granger
“Oh, that's barely learned.” Harry jokes.
McGonagall stops with her wand in the air and looks at the students in front of her. She still teaches some classes, mostly with the eighth years, due to lack of staff.
Ginny Weasley
Ron sights and takes a sit in the front with Hermione. Harry places his books on the desk next to theirs where Neville is sitting.
“I don't appreciate making plans with people who never show up. Especially you.” he tells him.
“Touch a spider.”
Harry has never heard the name Hermione come out of Malfoy's mouth. It sounds weird. But good weird.
“So are you ok with the light bulb?” Harry asks then.
Harry takes a deep breath in order to calm down and not unload all day's anger on his friends.
“Yeah, I-” Draco doesn't have anything to say. He places his chin back on his knees and stares at he wall across the room.
“Yes.”
“It's Hermione. She's texting me.”
“Y-yeah.” He sees the girls exchanging glances. “What's going on?” he asks. The girls turn to look at him. “I know, I know. Nothing.” He says and goes to pick his books.
“See, we're not so different in the end. You just used muggle things.” he jokes as he takes the phone. They get up to go back to their dormitory.
Still not over the idea that he might get set up and have to do something like kiss Draco Harry answers truth.
“But I don't know how to do it.” Draco sounds miserable.
Harry takes and deep breath and looks around. Some student's have their eyes locked on him. One would think that the great Harry Potter who has defeated Lord Voldemort would be unaffected by some Hogwarts students following, curiously, his every move, but unfortunately that's not the case. He takes another look around before turning to Hermione and Ron. Ron catches his nervous expression and looks around the room noticing the curious students. He turns to the others and whispers
“You were right though. I am my father's puppet.”
Harry pulls almost all the way out before pushing again back in. he does it a few times with a little more force until Draco starts pushing back against him. He grabs Draco's hair exposing his neck and starts kissing him, Draco groans and pushes harder against Harry causing him to change the angle and hit his prostate.
“Really Ronald. You are lucky we are already dating. You're too much work.” she pets his hair and every protest dies in Ron.
“Okay seriously what on earth is going on with everybody lately?” Harry says closing the book with a thud and sits straighter.
“Oh really? Because lately I can't even bloody mention Malfoy without people chatting and laughing and giving me weird looks. Seriously what on Merlin's beard is happening?”
“What happened?” Harry asks laughing.
“Uhm, candles. Or some kind of electric bulbs.”
“I wasn't trying to torture you Draco.” Harry says softly. “I was being sincerely kind.”
And now he is standing in the great hall with every one else, waiting for McGonagall to give her fist speech as Headmistress. He can't help but feel a little sorry for Snape, even if he doesn't want to. When McGonagall stand and raises her hand for the room to fall silent, Hermione turns to give him and Ron a smile. Ron smiles at her widely and she blushes a little- Harry has only seen Hermione blush when Ron smiles at her. He gives her a tight smile. She narrows her eyes -of course she notices- and shakes her head in confusion. He gives her a reassuring smile and she turns towards the professors' table, giving him on last look.
“Pardon?” McGonagall looks at Madam Pomfrey.
Harry shows him what to do and then sits back and watches him type.
Draco fakes an annoyed expression but then brakes into a smile.
“Oh, that.” Malfoy says. He walk past Harry and drops his books at the armchair.
“Actually,” Seamus interrupts “You wouldn't have, because we weren't playing strip then. That happened afterwards, when Ron took his socks off.”
“I don't understand why we need to take muggle studies.” Ron whines.
Harry narrows his eyes but doesn't say anything. He feels blood rushing to his brain.
“How does a mobile work in here anyway?”
“Oh, that's gonna be boring Neville.” he answers calmly. Are you sure you don't want to ask something else?”
“It is hard to tell without further details but, I would say you are living a similar situation with the original faces.”
Theodore Nott
“What?”
Madam Pomfrey come in and grabs Blaise's ear.
“Convenient?” Dean asks.
“What? No one!” Blaise says “Look, can I sit down now?”
“Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall’s voice rang in her ears and she felt Draco standing up straight. “A word, if you will?” She was standing at the entrance, close to them. She did not wait for an answer, walking out as quickly as she had appeared.
“You realize I don't understand any of those right?” he says.
Draco turns to face him. He looks surprised but only for a second. He composes himself back to his smug face that makes Harry want to push him against the wall and punch him. Muggle style.
“Well, too bad. Cause I'm not going anywhere.”
“Malfoy-”
Every one goes back to their rooms. Except Harry. He goes to Draco's room. The door is open but he is standing with his back on it so he doesn't see Harry approach.
The students can barely hold their laughter.
“Draco I-”
“Pansy, truth or dare?” Draco interrupts his train of though.
“Hey, you didn't take any clothes of last night so you're going.” Neville says.
“Really?” Draco asks curious.
Malfoy sits up and brings his legs to his chest and hugs them, placing his chin on the top.
“Wait, they lost and you're still sober?” Harry says surprised.
Harry lets his head fall back and closes his eyes.
“Nothing. But admittedly I deserve more than a punch.”
“Well, I have no idea whatsoever, what it is but alright. Although, now that I've learned the mobile-”
He turns to look at the boy next to him who still hasn't looked up at him.
“Well, not tonight obviously. Do it tomorrow. I'll wait.” she arches an eyebrow.
“As grateful as we'd all be for that,” Ron says “you're going mate.” Blaise's face falls and they all laugh hysterically.
Harry tries to suppress a smile, because he knows that if he says anything now Malfoy will go back to his defensive facade.
Luna turns to Neville next to her and kisses him. When she pulls back Neville is a bit more red than he was a moment before and Luna drops her gaze and smiles shyly.
went.” he says and Blaise laughs.
“Yes.” Draco says rubbing his face. “More or less, yes.”
“I am trying to teach Ron how to properly use a mobile phone.” she says in a way that suggest that Ron has understood nothing.
Her eyes wandered around the Great Hall. Half demolished and up in smokes. Her ears rang and her brain was foggy but the heart-wrenching sound of cries pierced them anyway. On her left, Blaise and Theo kept their eyes fixed on the spot on the wall where the main entrance used to be –now just blown-up hole, the size of a Thestral. No one was looking their way; standing in the corner closest to the entrance, they were almost invisible. But no one was looking for them either –too busy mourning their dead. Friends, family, classmates, teachers.
“Well, he does most of the work, since he is the one knowing about all the muggle things. Plus he has Granger to help him. So yes. Convenient.” he says calmly.
It is early so there is no one there. He takes a shower washing his hair and body and then sits under the steaming water, rubbing his temples, trying to make sense of the dream. After a while he gives up, gets out of the shower, gets dressed and ready for the day.
“Yeah, that.”Harry says and grabs his arm forcing Malfoy to turn and look at him. “Look, Malfoy. I don't care what you were doing or were you've been. I don't even care if you hate muggle studies. Pick a time that you can meet and don't be late.” Harry stops to take a breath and realizes that the whole room has gone silent. Malfoy is looking at him with amusement but it's not mocking that Harry sees, more like interest.
They walk in silence for a few minutes.
“Dude come on!”
“Mobile is a characterization for a phone. This” he says pointing at the mobile in Malfoy's arms “is a mobile phone. There are other phones attached to the wall, that are not mobile phones.”
“Um,” he starts and Harry can see he has trouble getting the words out. “Can I do it? I mean, can I try? To text it?”
“Did you sleep well?” Harry asks placing a hand under Draco's shirt making small circles on his stomach.. He is not making chit-chat, he is actually concerned.
“So I guess I shouldn't tell anyone that you were the one to send that text message, huh?” he asks.
McGonagall takes sits in her chair behind her desk and looks at the scene taking place in front of her.
“Nothing.” he clears his throat. “Well, nothing happened really. Just the small things. Last year changed us both. We just didn't feel the same anymore.” he says. “To be honest I couldn't think Ginny as the person to spend the rest of my life with. And she didn't think that for me so... Yeah, that's it.” he says. There is absolute silence for a few seconds and then everyone agrees.
Seamus says too Blaise, too loudly for his own good. He winces and falls silent.
“You're up early” Hermione says when she sees him.
On of the perks of having a different place than the other students is that they have their own rooms. He drops his books nearby the bed and falls on it with his clothes still on.
“That's also true.” Ron adds.
Draco Malfoy
“Alright.” Harry takes a deep breath and nods. “Alright.”
“What?” Pansy asks.
“No owl” Harry confirms and shows the screen to him.
“Okay.” he nods. He takes a sit nearby the fireplace because his hair is still damp.
Harry stands there looking at Malfoy walking towards his room in a mix of frustration and something he can't quite put his finger on. When he turns to Hermione and Ron they look at each other knowingly.
“Neville,” he said calmly. Longbottom’s eyes turned back to meet her, who hadn’t looked away. A few moments later, he sighed and moved closer to Potter, giving her space to move. And she did, never once looking back at Potter. She reached Draco in a few short steps, her hands wrapping around him. She felt his own hands attempting a hug but all she felt was the ghost of one. With his head dropping heavily on her shoulder she wasn’t sure if he was still fully conscious.
“You, Mr Finnigan do not get to talk after coming by this morning with Mr Thomas for a sobriety potion.” Madam Pomfrey exclaims.
Harry narrows his eyes. “I'm really not.” He says and takes a sit opposite from him. He composes himself.
He wakes up with the bed sheets wrapped around him, sweating in last nights clothes. He looks outside the window. The sun has barely risen. He rubs his eyes, takes some clothes and heads to the showers.
“Time to wake up?” he tells the blond boy. Draco looks up and gives him the Malfoy glare. Well, the sleepy version of it. Harry laughs softly and gives him a kiss on the lips. Draco sits up, his back against the headboard.
He turns to McGonagall and sights. She has welcomed the first years and welcomed back the rest of the students.
“Well, yes.” Harry says but he gets no answer. “Why?”
“What the hell is she talking about???”
“Uuuuhm...” Harry says scratching his neck.
“Why, are you nauseous?” Madam Pomfrey asks concerned.
Draco glares at them but ends up laughing softly, and heads to the showers. Harry shakes his head, too early for this conversation, and heads to his own room to take some clothes.
“Hmm, let me think. Kiss Hermione.”
Harry places a hand on Draco's shoulder. Draco flinches at first but then the tension leaves his body. He turns to look at Harry again, searching his eyes, trying to see if it's save to open up more.
“That must have been tough.” Draco comments.
“Truth.” Ron answers immediately.
“Now, I partner each one of you with another student and assign a paper due the week before Christmas vacation. Each muggle-born will be paired with a pure-blood in order for the first to help the second understand the muggle world better.” Harry smiles at Neville who nods and nudges his arm.
“So, Edison, created the light bulb.” Draco asks reading a book about their assignment.
They eighth years burst out laughing in the classroom and McGonagall calls “Silence.”
“It's quick.” Malfoy admits. “Quicker than owls.”
“That was...less painful than what I imagined.” Harry smiles relieved. Draco wraps his legs around Harry's waist and pushes him, urging him to move.
“You would?” Draco asks quietly.
“Yeah, I'm sure I know how
“I told you I'm not leaving.” he says and Draco smiles.
“That's true” Ron says. Hermione rolls her eyes.
“Oh, come on!”
“I will hex his arse into the next millennium!”
When they part for breath Harry leans so that their foreheads are touching.
“Forth year. Around Christmas.” Seamus answers without even sweating. “Harry you're really not a natural.” he says. “Luna truth or dare.”
Draco falls asleep almost instantly and Harry just lays there looking at the man in his arms, thinking that he could really get used to falling asleep next to him.
A few minutes pas before Draco speaks again.
“Are we playing strip truth or dare?” Pansy asks.
Neville Longbottom
“Why would you need to find your keys?” Malfoy asks. “Just use alohomora. Or accio for the record.” He arches an eyebrow and smirks.
That sends the group to another round of laughter.
Later that night Harry and Draco are in Harry's room. Draco is sitting on the bed while Harry sits on the desk with his legs spread to the end of the bed.
“Yes.” Draco take a deep breath.“What was that?” He asks.
“Fine” he says. “I'll pick.” He takes another look at the list Hermione's helped him make. “Light bulb.” he finally says.
Ron Weasley
She felt a hand on her arm and turned to the entrance. Draco. She jolted up from her seat, followed shortly by Blaise and Theo, her eyes never leaving Draco’s. He would look pale were it not for the scars that covered most of his face. His eyes tried to focus on her but kept drifting away almost every other second. He was barely standing. She was close now. She could catch him.
Harry laughs. “Don't worry it won't bite.”
Draco huffs a laugh. “Right. Go on then.” he says “Don't let, what I imagine would be a very awkward talk, go to waste.” he winks and kisses Harry again. Harry smiles in the kiss and places himself on Draco's entrance. Draco takes a deep breath when Harry pushes in.
“Can I ask you a question?” she nods and he takes a few steps forwards to make sure no one listens.
“Excuse me?”
“She is quite brilliant.” He agrees. “But,” he says to lighten the mood “she can also be pretty scary, so I'd better reply.” He reaches for the phone, but Malfoy tightens his grip around it.
Draco looks at him with narrowed eyes. A smirk appears in his face.
“Then lets start with that. That was good.” Harry smiles. Draco raises his head a little more sure and smiles.
“Why did you never do anything?” he asks softly. “Facing you would be easier if you were just mean to me. But having to endure every kind version of Saint Harry was torture.”
“I won't do it.”
In his sleep he watches himself and Ron on the train to Hogwarts on their first year. Hermione joins them then and he sees the times Ron had a round with Hermione and at some point Ron's face turns into Malfoy's. After a while he can spot a lightning scar in Hermione's forehead.
“M hm.” he confirms. “For years. After Cedric's death. Sirius's” At the last one Draco looks away biting his lip. “My point is,” Harry says quickly. “It's normal. Well, not normal, but if you didn't I would worry.”
“Like that?” Draco laughs breathlessly. “Not likely.”
He comes down from the bliss and feels Draco's hand resting on his shoulder breathing heavily. He slowly rolls them over and carefully pulls out of him. Draco winces and Harry gives him a peck on the lips.
“Are you sure?” he asks, his voice muffled against the blond's skin. Draco nods.
“Uhm” Suddenly he can't concentrate with Malfoy so close to him.
Neville arches an eyebrow and then laughs.
“Yes, dear.”
“Okay so what's next?” Ron asks later, as he, Harry and Hermione make their way out of transfiguration.
“Hermione casted some spells.”
“Fine, fine.” He cuts him. “Dare.”
“Dare.” he answers with pride.
“Harry!” Pansy says and gestures for him to come closer. “We're about to play truth or dare. Are you coming?”
“What did Muggles use until then?”
“See?” Harry smiles. “We're different. I would go for my keys.”
“See, there I would use a reparo.” Malfoy says amused.
“Draco, we are using candles, literally, right now.” Harry says.
“Excuse me?” McGonagall looks from Blaise to Madam Pomfrey with wide eyes.
“He really gets on your nerves doesn't he?” she asks.
“Long night?” Blaise asks smirking.
“For them.” Malfoy corrects him.
“Yep, that's true.” he agrees with himself.
She spotted Potter walking around aimlessly, his eyes void of any emotion. Every few steps he would stop, looking around at the pile of bodies –dead and alive –and then he’d go on walking as if taking the sight in. She focused on his face, desperate to find a hint of guilt on it but his eyes betrayed nothing.
He finds Hermione and Ron sitting at a table and joins them dropping his books on the desk. Ron barely manages to pull his hands away before Harry's books crash them.
“Are the Weasley twins back in school?!” they hear Madam Pomfrey.
They all turn to Blaise.
“Have you thought of any subjects? Anything you are interested in?”
Harry scoffs. “Dick.”
He murmurs a spell that has them both clean tucks them under the covers.
“Harry,” Hermione says and Harry turns to look at her. “What happened?”
“A spell.” he says. Draco raises an eyebrow. Harry has the decency to look sheepish. “I might have asked Seamus and Dean for a friendly advice...”
“Wha- Oh my God.” Blaise groans.
Harry closes his book and leaves it on the desk, standing up.
“Harry, truth or dare?”
“Well,” Pansy says smirking, “good thing you did because alcohol and pregnancy don't go together.”
After coming back to the common room, they sit in an armchair and chat with Neville, Pansy and Blaise until Hermione and Ron make their way downstairs. Ron raises his eyebrows at them and Hermione smiles. Ron is about to say something but then Seamus and Dean come down.
“Thank you professor.” he says and she smiles.
For the rest of the day he can't stop thinking about it. In his head he replays every single talk, or fight for the record, he had with Malfoy. This year. And when he covers that he thinks about the rest of the years since they first met.
“Ouch, ouch.”
“Like what?” Malfoy asks. He takes the mobile that Harry has with him and starts playing with it. Harry looks at him to see if his joking but he seems to actually be interested.
His eyes widen. Neville, next to him, nudges him. “Are you alright mate?'
“Yeah, couldn't sleep.”
“What on earth is goin-” Blaise opens the door and stands there looking at McGonagall.
Luna Lovegood
“With Malfoy.” she says. “How did it go tonight?”
Harry sights and stands up.
“As many of you might have heard this is a very special year for this school.” she tells them. “The building is still under construction and we welcome last year's seventh year to retake their classes. I will not lie to you. Most of them are shaken as much as we all are. I would like to ask from the first years to let them be. I know that your curiosity is enormous and we will try to satisfy it in your classes. Your professors will not lie or hide the truth about what happened last year, but I will have to ask you not to bombard any of the students with questions.” She says all seriousness, but then offers them a warm reassuring smile and takes her sit along with the rest of the staff.
“And it's about to get even better.” he says ironically. Since there weren't many students who came back for their eighth year they were not put in the dormitories of each house but in another common dormitory. So they are taking classes together as well.
“Goodnight mate.” Ron tells him.
“Don't ask.” he moves his hand dismissively.
Draco lets out a small laugh.
“I expected you to do it since we came back. I couldn't even understand why you were acting so kind that day. I don't know why you're not killing me at the spot.”
“What?” he asks.
“Oi there mate.” Ron says and Hermione smiles.
“Love is in the aiiiiir” Dean murmurs and Seamus laughs.
“Why are you so nice all the damn time?”
“You didn't wake up screaming.”
“What really happened between you and Ginny?” Neville asks.
“Dare.” answers smiling.
“Is that blood?” Neville asks pointing at Draco's shirt. There are some stains of blood from when he punched him last night.
“Nothing.” Hermione says trying to suppress a laugh.
“Hey, I'm a good kid.” Draco chokes on his own saliva at that. “What??” Blaise asks.
“Well, I guess I'm not completely cut off the muggle world. I still do things by hand that you probably use magic for.”
Blaise groans. “Fine. Ron truth or dare?”
Harry smiles and looks up at the door exactly the moment Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson enter the classroom.
“You're late, Potter.” He says and takes a step back to go and sit on a chair putting his legs on the desk.
“Do I look like a care?” Ron asks, which only makes Hermione laugh harder.
“Right before it beeped.”
“Calm down, Ron it's a game.” Hermione laughs.
“That's rude.” Hermione adds.
The hey Slytherins aren't as cocky as one would expect since they came back, Not all of them. They are blending in just like everyone else. But there is so much history between Harry and Malfoy that he can't help felling something turning inside him every time he is in sight.
Harry smiles. “Yes it is.”
“Well, You'd better not be young man. Go and sit down before I change my mind.”
“Was that evening in the classroom real?” Harry asks.
“When did she send it?” he asks.
“Uuuhm, we had a fight...?” Draco offers.
“Well, Bagley thought that even though your parents were wizards you were raised in the muggle world so that apparently qualifies you as a muggle-born for this assignment.” Harry opens his mouth. “And she probably thought that this childish fight between the two of you has got to stop at some point. To which I agree to be honest.”
“Hermione Granger with Ronald Weasley.” Ron places an arm around Hermione who smiles at him.
“When did you and Dean start dating?” he asks with an arched eyebrow.
“Yeah, I don't know what got into him.”
Pansy Parkinson
“Yeah,” Harry agrees. “I almost died every year.”
“Yes you self-revolved freak” Draco smiles “It's the muggle stuff.”
“Electricity.” Harry says. “Most things in the muggle world work with electricity or batteries. They need power to function. For us magic is the power.”
“It's okay I actually like it when you get a little possessive.” she smiles and gives him a kiss.
“Huh? Yes, yes. I'm fine.” He turns to look back at Malfoy who is talking with Blaise.
“Okay. I dare you to go to madam Pomfrey and tell her you accidentally casted a spell that got you pregnant.”
“Oh...This muggle stuff is messing with my head.” he exclaims.
“Now I' m going to assign you your partners.” Harry looks at the professor wide eyed. Won't they choose their partner?
Well, guess what. I don't buy this little charade of yours.” He realizes that he has gotten into the room and stands just inches away from Malfoy. The other boy is looking at him in the eye but now what Harry detects in his eyes is not smugness. It's insecurity. But he is too far gone to stop now. “I think,” he continues “that you are just a scared little boy, afraid to disappoint daddy. You are so used to things going your own way but you know why that is? Because it's not your way, Malfoy. It's your father's. And he makes sure of that. So when you act all tough and in control you are nothing but a puppet dancing around to another person's rhythm. Now, it's your father, before him his precious Lord. How about you start acting like an adult and take some responsibility for once, huh?”
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “Are you really asking me this question?”
“Potter?”
“How did tonight go?” Hermione asks Harry. She is sitting in front of an armchair, leaning her back against it while Ron playing with her hair from where he is sitting in the chair. Harry is sitting on the rug across from her and searches through books about electricity and light bulbs.
He takes a sit next to Neville, blinks a few times and tries to concentrate. Not easy, he finds.
“So, if I see a dream, which is more like memories, but the faces are different, what does it mean?”
They were the records of someone trying very hard to learn how and where he spent his time. Someone who had watched him for weeks and weeks before they finally made their move. He knew Goyle had known enough to seek him out in the park. It only made sense he’d put in some work.
Andromeda nodded.
It wasn’t all right, nothing about this was
The name smacked into him like a fist, what little composure he’d managed to regain gone in a sharp, painful exhale. He didn’t know who he’d been expecting, but not another one of his classmates… He
He was holding a book that was older than Hogwarts.
Harry scowled. “I don’t know what you—”
