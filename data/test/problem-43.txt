me do it, instead, so that I would prove that I’d put myself in danger for the sake of others. He said it was all I knew how to do, now, that all I had ever done was take the roles thrust upon me because I had to, because I was told it was the right thing to do, because I have no self-worth, apparently—he said I keep giving away pieces of myself because I never learned that there was anything worth holding on to, and that people were using me, all the time, and I’m letting them, that I’m just as much of a pawn as I ever was… He called me a puppet…”
The wizard at the desk didn’t look much older than Harry himself. His sandy blond hair was combed back neatly, his robes pressed impeccably. The office was immaculate, not a single quill or parchment out of place, but it was still small and cramped. It was clearly the office of someone who believed themselves more important than they were. Harry glared at the man, who only continued staring in consternation, but Ron wrinkled his nose as he followed Harry inside the narrow doorway.
Draco put the parchment down on the table next to the rest of his post, and adjusted his reading glasses. It was interesting that Andromeda was finally reconnecting with Narcissa—but why now? Andromeda was the guardian and grandmother of Teddy Lupin, wasn’t she? And wasn’t Teddy Harry’s godson? He wondered if Harry knew about this development. He didn’t know how much Harry was involved in little Teddy’s life, but would he want his godson that close to a Malfoy? Narcissa hadn’t mentioned the boy, so maybe he didn’t have to worry about that just yet.
Timsy had cleared out the seating in the middle of the room, leaving the floor wide open. A large blanket took up the space in the middle, with a couple of throw pillows, and Draco knew they’d be practically drowning in impervious charms—the elf hated cleaning stains out of fabric. Harry was sat crosslegged on the blanket, removing plastic containers and disposable silverware from the bag.
Draco abandoned his dinner halfway through in favour of devouring Harry, instead, to Harry’s immense satisfaction. Draco wanted him like he couldn’t get enough, like he couldn’t even help himself, and it made Harry both overwhelmed and just as insatiable.
Harry burned breakfast several times, which only made Draco tease him more, which only turned him on more. It was impossible to keep his hands to himself. Which made it that much more difficult to drop Draco off at the Manor and leave him for the Ministry, every day.
“No? Alright, then,” Draco mumbled, a little dejected. Harry then started pointing at him, and Draco furrowed his brows, trying to decode the vague message.
Draco’s fingers slowly wrapped around Harry’s throat, tightening viciously, and Harry did nothing to stop him as he choked, dropping his wand in surprise, his hands coming up to Draco’s wrists, his eyes
“I do, too,” Harry said. “But we can’t, until I know it’s safe. For both of you.” He sighed and pulled his socked feet up on the sofa. His holly wand felt tired, warm against his skin as he rolled it between his palms. He handed it over to Narcissa, hilt-first.
Harry ate lunch at his desk, again. He had thought he’d be kept busy, being back at work after nearly six weeks away, but his pile of paperwork was dwindling quickly, and he’d already run two interrogations this week, and successfully completed a raid of an illegal potions dealer’s warehouse… it was only Tuesday, and it wasn’t
Weasley snorted at that. “SPEW, but I won’t tell her if you won’t.” He finally made his way into the sitting room with Draco on his heels.
He found Draco in the cellar, of all places. His platinum hair looked gold in the scant firelight of the sconces, his eyes shone as he paced back and forth over the dusty stone. The tile that had hidden the supplies for the prisoners hadn’t been replaced.
now, a mother, an influential activist, though Draco was sure she was just as much of a know-it-all as ever. She was clearly a force to be reckoned with: she stood with more confidence, walked with more grace. The staff swerved out of her path in the corridor, recognizing her both as a war hero and the vehicle of strength behind the Ministry’s many reforms.
“It’s calmer than I’ve seen before, gentler. When you’re angry or upset, the air feels charged, like it does right before a lightning storm. Like going to touch something metal in a dry winter, knowing the static will zap you.” Draco breathed in deeply again, and rolled his head on his neck, letting it wash over him.
, too. It felt like the thrilling, precarious balance between the two, that stripped him down to his very essence, his basest instinct.
His face popped up in another fireplace, and Draco recognized the office of the Minister for Magic. Shacklebolt was sitting at his large desk, writing something with a long quill. Draco internally thanked him for the full floo access, and cheered that he’d got him at a time when he wasn’t too busy, doing Minister things.
Scorpius tsked at him, in a manner so similar to Draco that Draco nearly laughed again. He pressed his lips together as his son succumbed to Harry’s flattery and cleared his throat.
“I want to know everything about you, Harry,” Draco murmured in that low, quiet voice that Harry adored. “I want to stand with you, I want to be yours, I want to be what you choose over anything you feel you owe the world. I want to be the one thing you’re selfish for, and I want to kiss you
Harry only smiled at him. In truth, the journal’s twin was currently residing in Harry’s rucksack, waiting for the worst at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place. The corner of Draco’s lips turned up, a glint of mischief in his eyes.
“What’s the occasion for bubble tea?” Draco asked, desperate to move the conversation away from his own feelings for a moment. He turned to grab the cup, stabbing the straw through the lid with relish and then humming in happiness as he took a sip. Honey milk tea, light ice. Just the way he liked it. He turned back around, expecting a very Harry-like explanation of spontaneity and love, but Harry looked… nervous. Scared, maybe? Whatever the emotion, it was wildly different than the effusively quiet happiness he’d been exuding this whole time, and Draco reached out to cup his cheek.
“After the Death Eater trials, I asked Kingsley to keep an eye on Draco, check in on him occasionally. To make sure the Aurors were staying away from him, and the Ministry didn’t try to hold him back from whatever he wanted to do. I had saved Draco’s life and I’d testified for him and he finally had a second chance, away from his father—I didn’t want it to go to waste, is all,” Harry finished lamely, crossing his arms in defense.
He complained that Harry’s portion wasn’t as big as his, when Harry obviously needed the same amount of food,
Harry smirked, looking at him with those sad eyes again. He bent over his notebook, writing once more.
Harry stepped into the Pensieve Room in the Department of Mysteries, soothed by its familiarity after such a bizarre day. The opulent Pensieve stood on a plinth in the center of the room, surrounded by tall, glittering rows of glass shelves, carrying thousands and thousands of tiny glass vials of memories. There were no lights, because there didn’t need to be: each memory gave off a dim, aquamarine glow, like the light of a
“I can’t reconcile all the different Harry Potters I know in my head,” Draco muttered. “There’s one that was a rude and annoying git in school, and one who saved me from Fiendfyre and killed the Dark Lord, and one who was a shady Unspeakable who kept too many secrets, and one who pretended to love me, then left me. And one who loved me enough to get struck by lightning for me.”
“Okay, point is, Healer Malfoy is our best bet,” Ron interrupted, “since there’s nothing wrong with you physically, the Healers agree this is a problem for the specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, and he’s agreed to help regardless of your history, and Harry, you’re just going to have to trust us on this.”
“Did you think she was your only chance at a normal life? A family?” he asked tentatively. Harry grimaced, and looked away. Draco took that as a firm yes. He thought for a moment, carefully forming the rest of his words.
After a moment, Ron cleared his throat softly. “Well, someone had to,” he mumbled, and Harry snapped his head up, ready to fight again.
“My favourite record for rainy days,” Draco said. “If we’re lucky, I might be able to get Timsy to dance to it.”
“I guess I’m just looking for things to experience,” Harry continued. “Like you said, seeing everything there is to see.” He refrained from adding,
Harry immediately sagged, landing his face in his hands. Draco called Timsy for chocolate. He pointed his wand at the chalkboard, drew a dot towards the left side, and labeled it “31/10/81”. He hated writing out morbid memories on display. He knew the date, which would be reference enough.
It was a small, unobtrusive mole, all shimmering silver mist, not big or bright enough to wake Draco. Harry had never seen his boss’ Patronus before; in fact, he’d never even thought about it. But he knew, without a doubt, that it was Kramer’s.
“This is insane, Harry,” Draco said, peeling his hand off the door, taking a step towards him. The intensity of his heated gaze made Harry shake.
“Are you writing to her?” Willem asked, pausing in his painting. Harry was pretty sure he was the subject of this particular piece, since Willem kept glancing up at him, a crease of concentration between his brows.
Occlumency, indirectly—she’d only wanted to see him suffer, for fun, but he’d eventually learned how to keep her out. He’d never thought his godfather would do something like that—Severus certainly hadn’t been
Harry hummed softly, then returned his gaze to Malfoy. He hadn’t moved. Harry could see a dusting of snow collecting on his dark jeans. That jacket was definitely not warm enough for this weather, no hat, no gloves, no scarf—
Draco wondered absently if these old classmates had similar thoughts when they saw him. He guessed the phenomenon of getting older would never—well, get old.
Draco continued to glare at him, but it wasn’t a glare that Harry was used to. His eyes were narrowed, a little red, his brow furrowed, his mouth pulled down in a frown. He did indeed look irritated, worried, perplexed—he also looked determined, curious, the faintest hint of fond.
He was short and wiry, with a head of messy salt-and-pepper hair and shocking blue eyes. He didn’t walk with a cane, but he looked like he might need one, soon. He spent his evenings either with a book or in front of his telly—occasionally, he’d bring out a watercolour paint set to his tiny front porch. Harry joined him with his journal, sharing his company in content silence.
Harry dropped the book. Three faces whipped around, startled by the noise. Ice was filling Harry’s veins, the words pelting his skull like hailstones.
“Mm,” Draco grunted, remembering. “No, I don’t suppose it will be. But we’ll be alright. We’re safe, here.”
Harry stared at her in shock, then his brain caught up with the situation: she was wearing the dress that Willem had brought, as well as Willem’s coat.
is it?” Draco muttered. “They got a seven year head start on their relationship. They got lucky, finding their soulmate at eleven, even though it took them ages to do something about it. You’ve been there, with them, the entire time. Notice that the first words Ron said after finding out his wife was pregnant, were ‘Merlin’s pants, Harry, I’m gonna be a dad’. You were as important a part of that moment as anything. You’re as integral a part of their lives as ever—that has not changed. They’d do anything for you. I mean, Ron Weasley threw out his pride to beg a
Draco looked up from his book and closed it immediately, carefully removing his reading glasses as his mouth stretched in a bright grin, directed entirely at Harry. Panic started to build in Harry’s gut, mixing uncomfortably with pleasure.
, and Harry was thrown back as the shelves shattered, the vials burst, and all of Harry’s memories from the last ten years shot towards him, freed from their confines.
“I need to know what you know of the Unspeakables’ current projects, as well as a list of who works there and their backgrounds,” Draco said, and Shacklebolt stared at him for a moment, dumbfounded, before throwing his head back and
He looked up, and Draco met his eyes, brilliantly green as always, even in the dim light of this awful room. Draco remembered once thinking he could do this wandlessly, if Harry kept looking at him like that, so he locked onto Harry’s gaze desperately, trying to tip forward, to fall in—
Another sharp cry as the knives in his stomach stabbed and pulled, and his throat was closing, he couldn’t breathe, these bonds were not supposed to
“Making you hide your voice seems a pretty counterproductive way to make someone get to know the man you are, doesn’t it?” Draco paused, searching Harry’s face. “Unless that someone can
Malfoy released a breath he’d apparently been holding, and Harry thought he saw something like gratitude in his eyes as he raised his wand once more.
“Narcissa and I,” Harry clarified, to a scathing raised eyebrow. “Merlin, Draco, I swear she tried to suffocate me anytime I dared entertain the
He gasped for breath as he returned fully to his body, quickly taking inventory of himself as he did after every session. Fingers, flexed, that’s his own hair, brushing his face, those are his legs, yes. That was too intense for a mind-viewing. He was only supposed to return the memory to Potter’s conscious mind, why did it suck him in like that? He slowed his breathing, wiped his forehead with his silk handkerchief, and absently handed it to Potter. If he was feeling anything like Draco was, he’d need it, but Draco couldn’t look at him now. He quickly pulled a small notebook and biro from his jacket pocket, thank Merlin for those extension charms, and started frantically writing down everything he could before he could forget. The room was silent for a few moments, except for the sounds of their breathing and the scratch of the pen.
“Oh, I don’t know,” she said, making a dismissive motion with her hand. “Considering you performed a miracle, I think you’re allowed to forget a kidney or two.”
“Do you know where that—that shirt is, with the…” Draco trailed off, vaguely gesturing, unsure of the terminology to describe a piece of muggle clothing Pansy had made him buy last year, that he knew would be perfect for this weather. Timsy disapparated before he could try to finish his thought, and reappeared a second later with the shirt-jacket in question. It was a deep navy canvas, with large pockets and a sharp collar, lined with shearling wool. The muggle at the high-end menswear shop had called it a “chore shacket” which Draco thought sounded like something dirty, and refused to say aloud.
His wards were still up, but they were fading, because he could hear the distant hum of nightlife, of jubilant people and the sweet music of street buskers. Harry laid perfectly still on the warm cobblestones, his breathing harsh and laboured, and let the familiar melody run through him.
“Good,” Draco praised, and he could feel Harry’s appreciation of it. “You’re getting better, this is calmer, more controlled. I hope it feels easier for you, too.”
“Do you understand where I am, right now?” Draco asked. “You spent all those months getting to know me, while I pretended to know you so I wouldn’t hate myself for loving you.”
Malfoy clicked his tongue, in what was clearly false annoyance, if the tender smile was anything to go by. He set aside his book and rolled to face Harry fully, propping himself up on his elbow. His hand came up to Harry’s face again, pulling him in without an ounce of hesitation, and Harry didn’t even have time to be nervous before soft, full lips were on his, making his stomach flutter wildly.
“Nosy,” Draco corrected. “Who knows what you do with that information.” He returned to his writing, filling the kitchen with that soft scritching sound. He kept glancing up at Harry, which only stoked Harry’s curiosity, prickling under his skin.
to know what Malfoy’s Patronus was. What could be Malfoy’s happiest memory? Perhaps bullying a first year? Watching Harry get in trouble?
“Oh yes, we’re going to listen to it,” Draco teased. “The first time was slightly ruined by a very rude interruption from Pansy.”
they gave us Justin Timberlake, there’s honestly nothing more to be said, and we don’t have time for you to write out all your arguments in your chicken scratch.”
Draco withdrew, and as Harry closed his eyes and sagged against his chair, Draco pointed his wand at the chalkboard. The next dot appeared, and he labeled it “Breakup”, thinking idly to himself that that might be the most “normal” thing on the board.
A figure sat a couple seats down from him, and was speaking to him, but in this intoxicated state, it was almost impossible to make out any words. He couldn’t even tell the gender of the speaker, could not discern anything about their looks at all. It must have been some sort of Notice-Me-Not, but not one Draco had ever seen. He concentrated harder on the words.
Harry didn’t respond, because he couldn’t, even if he did know the answer—and he hated himself for it. Draco sighed, his fingers fiddling with the clasp of Harry’s Unspeakable cloak.
“Dobby tried to get you expelled?” Draco asked, glancing up at Harry, who snorted quietly. “He always did have a roundabout way of doing things,” Draco murmured absently as he wrote. “Very clever, and very brave.”
He chanced a look up at Harry, and saw his mouth pressed in a thin, grim line. A muscle was twitching in his jaw. His green eyes looked fiery with anger, but ultimately concerned, and it struck Draco that Harry was possibly angry
Harry hadn’t known what to do with himself, after that, since all he wanted to do was run to Draco and/or punch his former boss, so he’d sprinted several more laps around his neighbourhood until his legs threatened to give out.
Harry rounded the island, easing in next to him and taking the tea from his hand. Draco pressed his lips together and took a step back, balling his fists. Harry silently scooped the tea leaves, pouring hot water into the mugs and giving each a little stir, just as Draco would.
As soon as he decided it, the leatherbound journal came floating out of the bag. It landed in his waiting hands, heavier than it should have been. The leather felt scaly and harsh against his oversensitive fingertips, though he knew from memory how supple it was.
He grabbed another handful of floo powder from a small pot on the mantle, and threw it into the fire. Green flames whooshed from the grate, and he stepped in. “Malfoy Manor,” he called out, ignoring the sinking feeling in his stomach.
to be the hero, that Dumbledore had intentionally made me endure trial after trial to train me to risk my own life, over and over, so that when the time came for me to die, I wouldn’t even blink before walking to my death. He said Dumbledore had forced me to stay at the Dursley’s because I felt worthless there, and if I’d had a better childhood I’d have too much self-worth to willingly give up my life for the greater good.
Draco leaned back in his chair and folded his hands over his lap, forcing himself to slow down and watch Potter for a moment. Potter had noticed that Draco wasn’t drinking coffee with him, which had apparently made him suspicious. He took out his wand and proceeded to check his coffee for poisons. Draco tried not to sigh.
Draco might be able to guess on many things, but there was so much more to Harry than just his memories and the way he was raised. The Harry Draco thought he knew would never have kissed him, for instance. Draco hadn’t known that he liked vindaloo. Draco didn’t know what his favourite colour was or what his house looked like or if he liked to sing while he cleaned, if he cleaned, Draco didn’t even know what kind of music he listened to—he still hadn’t listened to that mixtape, he hadn’t once looked at the boombox since Harry left.
Memory-Harry slurred, shaking his head slowly, regretting it as he squeezed his eyes shut against a wave of nausea. Harry felt himself sweat outside of his head, in his own, present-day body. Of all the things to relive.
Draco’s eyes widened in panic. He tried to hold his lips together, but it was no use. “Not a memory,” Draco panted as the truth burst through. “A dream. A fantasy.”
The large office now held several more Aurors that Ron trusted the most: the youngest ones, who would not have been full Aurors during the time of Draco’s brief incarceration. Ron was pretty sure he’d weeded out all the corruption he’d seen in his time as a Junior Auror, but neither he nor Harry wanted to risk it right now.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. This was his new favourite muggle. Ever. Willem looked a little insulted, so Harry collected himself quickly, his lips still twitching with amusement.
He was dressed impeccably, as he always had been, but Draco couldn’t see the walking stick anywhere. His hair was much longer and whiter than it was the last time Draco had seen him, down to the middle of his back, and he was looking around Draco’s sitting room curiously, as if he’d just popped by for a visit. He held his wand loosely, lazily, in hands clasped in front of him.
to use that much magical power, ever before…” Draco furrowed his brows, because it was getting confusing again, but Harry was nodding vigorously, surprised that Draco had apparently understood him, and not called him crazy.
Draco turned him abruptly, pushing him back against the solid trunk of a moss-covered tree. Draco’s lips were suddenly inches from his face, and Harry stared at them for a moment before lifting his eyes to meet his intense gaze. He felt Draco’s firm grip on his shoulders again, holding him there against the tree.
“Political opponents? For what? Harry’s not a politician—are you?” Draco asked, looking at Harry, who only shrugged at him uncomfortably.
. He didn’t make you stay with your Aunt and Uncle to keep you safe from Death Eaters, he kept you there because you felt
He reached the black door, and stared at it for a moment—he remembered Harry’s memory of Lucius talking to Fudge, in front of this very door. It was awful, seeing the settings of those horrible memories come to life. It made it all much more real, much too close. He felt wretched, knowing so much about Harry, walking the paths he’d walked, aware that they would never speak again. Draco took a deep breath, ignoring the tight feeling in his chest, and opened the door.
She was crouched over a few wall racks in the back corner. She already had an armful of scrunchies: some were in neat little variety packs, and some were so whimsical and flashy with ruffles and sequins and textures that they were sold on their own. She straightened up, eyeing his wild, messy curls with barely concealed excitement.
“I’m taking us back, now,” Draco said, cutting this reverie short, keeping his emotions behind his Occlumency walls. He tightened his grip on his wand a little, and pushed, until he saw the same breadcrumb they’d left off with last time, with Harry and Dumbledore discussing his Slytherin qualities and Gryffindor choices in the Headmaster’s office. He started skimming, following Harry’s return to Privet Drive that summer.
They continued their excited gossiping, while Harry listened on silently, processing his thoughts, running the silk handkerchief through his fingers.
I’d heard of the phenomenon, but I never…” Draco took a deep breath, and sipped more of his hot chocolate, letting the warmth fill him. He felt like he couldn’t finish a thought before his mind raced to the next.
Now, Draco pulled the scrunchie out of his pocket and stretched it taut between his pointer finger and thumb, heading toward the bedroom. He felt rather ridiculous pulling out the warded box from his bedside drawers, but needs must. Dumping the box onto the bed, he surveyed the veritable rainbow of colors; there must have been at least twenty scrunchies, but was it really Draco’s fault when Harry just kept buying more?
I’m so tired of fighting the corrupt bloody Ministry.” He plopped down in his chair, scrubbing a hand through his vibrant ginger hair. “What now?”
When they made it back to the house, enduring another of Timsy’s discreet-yet-invasive hand cleaning charms, Draco decided to offer something he knew Harry wouldn’t ask for.
It felt like growing up, but not in the way Harry knew it. It felt like growing up knowing he was loved, and cared for, and cherished.
Harry shook himself out of his thoughts. It was so much harder to do now that he couldn’t speak. He couldn’t do anything but think.
Draco stared at the fire for a few minutes after Harry left, a turbulent mixture of emotions running through him.
Harry gazed upon the plethora of glittering vials, the thousands of glowing memories dancing inside them, trying to get back to him.
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled, lifting his head and peering at him. Harry only looked amused. He was holding up The Fugees album,
“Likewise,” Andromeda replied, studying him just as closely. “I’ve heard so much about you, nephew.” Her brown eyes twinkled.
That power that could make Draco “higher,” maybe even “better,” than his ancestors or predecessors, that could make Draco
of them… how was he supposed to find it? And why weren’t there any Unspeakables around? He was completely alone, in this dim, echoing hall, buried deep underground.
Harry sat, cautiously, his eyes darting back and forth between Draco and the tiny bottle on the side table.
“I don’t know what it is,” he continued, suppressing his own giggles. “Wizarding folk think we’re Veela, the muggles think we’re vampires, but all we are is rich and inbred.”
He turned away quickly, one arm raising to cover his stomach, where he could feel that twist of discomfort, of warning.
“Alright, fifth year,” Draco mumbled, preparing himself. He raised his wand, waited for Harry’s nod, and cast himself into Harry’s head. Harry had brought him to the very end of fourth year, where they had left off last time.
Draco hesitated at the door to the shed, trying to preserve his good mood, but it was no use. He’d be in the air soon, anyway. He pulled open the door.
Draco tried not to roll his eyes. He was still wearing his fuzzy slippers, but he couldn’t really say no. He stood up fully, giving the man a wave of permission. He supposed it was nice that the Minister for Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt himself, bothered to ask permission, first, when he knew Draco had given him full access to his floo.
She eyed him intently. Draco recognized this look, she usually wore it when she poked and prodded Draco for his secrets. “How did you find out it was American, anyway?”
He crouched down and managed to pry up the loose tile with his fingers. It was heavy, and made a horrible grating noise as he slid it out of the way, revealing—
this easy. He couldn’t remember how he was cursed, but it felt like someone might have accidentally tripped and sneezed this harmless, benign curse on him. It didn’t feel like anything malevolent—this odd, irritating silence.
“It is not being the sun’s fault that Master Draco does not sleep when he should,” Timsy replied smoothly, and Draco had to appreciate how he was finally allowing himself to be sassy in front of Draco, even when it was in his characteristic quiet reprimand.
Draco finally, gratefully, withdrew from Harry’s head. His left hand was still shaking in his lap, and his breathing was hoarse and shallow, but he pointed his wand at the chalkboard, adding two more dots to the long train of memories. He left the first one blank, for the moment, and labeled the second one “Dumbledore Death - Fake Locket” because he couldn't bring himself to write the word ‘Horcrux’. Slowly, his Occlumency barriers came down, and his reactions and emotions came flooding through.
“I’m pretty sure the Claire’s girl is going to convince me to pierce my ears,” Harry said casually, like this wasn’t earth-shattering news, and Draco was on him before he even realized what was happening, putting joyful hands and butterfly kisses over every inch of Harry he could reach. Giggling wildly, Harry flipped them over, pinning Draco’s wrists down again.
Hermione gave her daughter a gentle push, urging her out from behind her legs. Rose clutched the stuffed creatures closer to her face, looking down as she muttered, “‘lo, Mr. Malfoy,” so quietly Draco wasn’t sure Ron or Hermione would have heard. Draco lowered his voice further.
And he had left Draco, without a word, in the middle of the night. Draco would wake up alone, with no explanation, no assurances, and Harry might not survive to see him again. And if he did survive, Draco would still be heartbroken and furious—because Harry had
with Draco’s hands like a vice around his neck, and he’d already used so much magic on the Fidelius. Draco could only fight ferociously in his head and hope that it would be enough, before it was too late. Draco could not,
Draco furrowed his brows. Harry was looking at him with… concern? He couldn’t really tell. “No, it doesn’t hurt me, either. But your memories are very vibrant, you feel things very intensely. It’s a lot to handle, at first, but I’ll get used to it.”
He found himself carrying the journal wherever he went, checking it obsessively for any scrap of Draco he could get. He wrote back when his fingers could handle the pen, and simply stared at the words when he couldn’t.
Draco’s body was rocked with agonizing convulsions, feeling like huge hooks were jerking violently in his core, and he tried not to shout aloud as they increased in frequency and intensity—
Draco sagged, panting and clutching his torso, squeezing his eyes shut against the pain. He hadn’t even been talking about
. Harry stared and let it flay him, strip him down to something raw and tender. He had kept himself going, all this time, with only the memory of Draco: his long, messy plait, his favourite blue cable knit jumper, the perpetual indigo ink stains on his elegant fingers. But Harry’s memory could only capture the cool grey of his eyes, not the way his gaze shot through Harry like lightning, igniting him. He could recall the weight and solidity of Draco’s body, but he couldn’t feel the warmth, or the security that came with Draco’s limbs wrapped around him.
part of his brain saw the bubble tea in Harry’s other hand, which did not stop the happy wiggling, seeing as Harry had gone to Draco’s favorite shop.
Looking outside, Draco saw a thick coat of fog on the ground. It would probably be chilly. He frowned, thinking. “Timsy,” he called.
Potter looked to Weasley, then seemed to realize he couldn’t tear him a new one with just his face, so he scrambled his hands on the bedside table, desperately grabbing the blank parchment and quill that sat there. He started frantically writing something, then shoved the parchment in Draco’s face.
wants a cigarette. Where the fuck would he go? He groans under his breath, leaning his hands on the cold, grounding stone of the side of the pub, breathing in chilled, city air. He won’t go back to the Manor, like this, he feels ill, he feels
But then his mind moved to the strength of Draco’s arms around him, nearly lifting him off the ground as he kissed Harry as if his life depended on it…
“Mind if I take over for a bit, then? It’ll be a bit disorienting, but I’ll get us to the right memories. I remember the feeling of them.” Draco suggested.
she’d told him when she bought it. He’d agreed with the sentiment, and silently wondered if that was why he kept buying all those sodding plants—daddy issues notwithstanding.
“You and me both,” Draco muttered, shaking his head. “Merlin, I never thought they’d abandon it so easily.”
Harry simply frowned back at him, letting out a harsh, shaky breath. Draco raised his eyebrows, rolling his wand between his hands, and waited.
Draco was standing at the hob, his hair pulled up high on his head to keep it out of the food. He had several pots and pans going, simmering and stirring under his careful magical supervision.
Harry rolled his eyes. He turned to face him, meeting Malfoy’s weirdly concerned gaze, and realized with a shock that this was the first time he’d made eye contact with anyone in weeks. He hadn’t left the school since the Battle, alone and directionless without a cause, speaking only when spoken to. Unfortunately, the distraction of repairs didn’t consume all of his waking moments.
“This is where the wards begin,” Draco explained, motioning towards the shimmering, transparent wall ahead of them. He started flying lazily along the barrier, all the way around the property, with Harry next to him, watching, listening. “They extend half a kilometer in each direction from the house, including up.” He motioned above him. “People can apparate into the front walkway, but not if they have any intention to cause harm. You probably felt an assessment of sorts on your way in.”
A War that had ended on this day, eight years ago, during some of the worst moments of Draco’s life. The day Harry had died, and returned to save them all.
“I’m afraid of Death,” Harry admitted. Draco felt something clench in his chest, the timidity in Harry’s voice wrapping around Draco’s lungs and squeezing. He said nothing.
But Harry took his hand back, shaking himself out of whatever had come over him, hunching his shoulders in. He glanced apologetically at Draco, once, and started writing again, and Draco tried to hold back a sob, because the fear was real, now. What if Harry was just like the other Aurors, who had laughed and watched as he suffered through Veritaserum overdoses as a teenager, who had asked him the most incriminating and embarrassing things they could think of, purely for their own entertainment?
The rustle of sheets as Scorpius climbed back into bed, a creak of wood as Harry settled against the headboard with another long-suffering sigh, the susurration of old pages flipping quickly.
With a jolt of panic, he looked down at himself and let out an aggravated groan. He hadn’t had a dream like that about Potter—shit,
“It’s alright,” he murmured. “Take your time. That was a lot to remember.” His voice was low and quiet, only loud enough for Harry to hear. A bar of chocolate appeared on the side table, and Draco internally thanked Timsy for recognizing a moment where apparition wouldn’t be welcome.
Draco pushed gently with his magic, searching. It felt a bit like flipping through his records, or a photo album, until—
“That one was pretty self-explanatory—pain and grief like that must have irrevocably changed you, and you finally got the answer you’d been looking for, why it was
Malfoy must have seen this in Harry’s expression, because he sighed deeply, slowly lowering his wand to his lap. His face softened as he held Harry’s gaze.
“Let me explain my theory to you, first, and when I’m finished, I’ll take the Veritaserum and answer any questions you have. I told you I’ll always give you full honesty, and you should trust that, but in this case, I thought you might appreciate the extra failsafe.”
“A true politician, Shacklebolt’s become,” Lucius mumbled, almost impressed. Draco wanted to curse him and Kingsley both. “Tell me the favours, Draco.”
If he was leaving, he’d have to come up with a story to leave the Unspeakables, one that would keep them away from Draco. He’d have to convince them that he was simply dissatisfied with his job and bored, and that Draco maybe stopped caring about his mother’s disappearance, maybe Narcissa didn’t really care for him, either, maybe there would be no need to try to go after him. Or maybe he’d just have to burn the place down and Obliviate them all. He couldn’t ask Draco to stay in his house all the time, could he? And he couldn’t ask Ron and Hermione to keep a constant eye on him, either. Right?
“So we learn about each other,” Draco guessed again, and Harry seemed proud of himself for communicating that nonverbally. “I understand,” he sighed. “It’s unbalanced. What do you want to know?”
The house was fucking miserable, though. So much so that Harry didn’t even mind having to spend a couple days in St. Mungo’s, even with the constant poking and prodding. At least they had hot water.
“Hey,” Harry frowned, mildly indignant, but immediately mollified with another macaron. A pinkish colour, was that… strawberry and
“Of course she did,” Draco threw his head back, laughing some more. “Merlin, Harry,” he breathed, wiping a tear from his eye. “You never do a thing halfway, do you?”
how unlikely it was they would re-Conjure you?” Harry asked, knowing he wouldn’t get an answer. He figured he knew the answer, anyway, but it
Now, Draco could not control his shock. That certainly explained Shacklebolt’s surprising interest in him, all those years ago, but for some reason, it didn’t feel very good.
Harry had wanted to visit the animals again, so they did. The sun was out, thankfully, so neither of them needed outerwear. Draco had even rolled up the sleeves of his shirt, allowing the mid-April sun to warm his skin, and fill him with contentment.
Draco picked up the wand from where it sat next to his newspaper, handing it over with an unimpressed raised eyebrow. Harry took it gratefully, patting his pockets again, groaning when he, once again, did not find what he was looking for.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, burying his face in Harry's shoulder so he wouldn't have to see. Harry was warm, too warm, hot to the touch. He grabbed Draco's thighs and ran, and didn't stop until they reached fresh air, the full, red moon peeking over the treetops.
Draco felt a soft weight climbing onto his right side, and turned to face a sleepy Camila, who was settling herself in the crook of his arm.
Potter had grown, but not much in height. His chest and shoulders had much more muscle on them than when Draco had last seen him in person, which was when he was malnourished from a year on the run and saving the bloody world, so that wasn’t much of a comparison. He could appreciate, however, the curve of his biceps where they held the top half of his body up from the bed, propped on one elbow to better see the chess game. This stretched his plain, grey t-shirt over his apparently toned chest, making Draco divert his eyes quickly back to Harry’s face. His deep black hair was as ridiculous as ever—Draco thought privately there must be magic keeping those wide, wild curls from being remotely tamed. They fell haphazardly over his forehead, around his ears and the nape of his neck, sticking up at random intervals as if they couldn’t decide whether or not gravity mattered. Draco could see the trademark scar peeking through the fringe in a jagged, pale line that barely cut through his right eyebrow, just over his glasses, which Draco noticed were a slightly larger, more modern version of the round frames he had worn throughout school.
Harry felt something soft and quiet enter his head, not like any invasion he’d felt before. This felt like someone had just stepped inside and was standing in the foyer, taking a look around. Not fully inside his head, but definitely not outside, either. Harry’s mind and memories were still under his own control. He thought he smelled something a little smoky, but not like the scent of a fire—like the smoke of a candle, blown out just before crawling into bed. Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad.
“Ron’s right, Harry, and so are the other Healers. I’ve been researching all of his public cases and published works, and he really is our best option,” Granger explained, causing Draco to look at her with raised eyebrows.
Draco walked purposefully through the corridors of St. Mungo’s towards the Curse Damage ward. At first, no one met his eyes—the staff glared at his feet, a combination of enmity towards him because of who he was, and deep suspicion because of what he did for a living. Most magical folk knew that Legilimency required eye contact. Why they thought Draco would bother reading boring thoughts that were so clearly hostile towards him, for no reason, he had no idea.
“What’s yours?” Harry asked, more hoarsely than he’d hoped. He cleared his throat again, cheeks heating as Draco’s grin turned into a smirk.
He sighed in satisfaction as the chime eventually ceased. Perhaps whoever thought they were worth his time had finally given up…
Harry’s lips quirked with amusement. That was much more familiar than the smooth, indifferent, professional Malfoy. He slowly raised his hand to point at the wire-framed glasses on his own face, that Malfoy had taunted him about for
that,” Draco urged, shocking himself with the use of the Minister’s first name, but too utterly bewildered by Kingsley’s indifference to care. “You don’t
“What? Narcissa is missing?” Harry’s sandwich was immediately forgotten, a weird twisting feeling in his stomach tightening with every word Ron spoke.
“Timsy is collecting the traces,” he mumbled. “Timsy is finding.” He closed his big eyes, and tightened his grip on the wand at his side. Harry stayed right where he was, waiting as patiently as he could, that soothing hint of candlesmoke still wafting in his head. The room was frozen in silence, in anticipation. Timsy’s frown deepened, further wrinkling his greyish face, and one huge ear twitched as he worked, the wand moving slowly to point at the floor in front of him.
There was barely enough room for Harry and Ron to fit through the doorway, and Ron was large enough that rat-like Zacharias Smith couldn’t see past his wide shoulders, where the Minister, Timsy, and Pansy Parkinson waited impatiently.
too. He suspected someone else’s involvement in their preservation—Narcissa was certainly involved in his own.
Draco barely got a glimpse of Harry’s wicked smile before he shot off, and Draco followed closely, urging his broom faster as they raced towards the house. It was close, but the
Hermione sat at the end of the table, directly to his left, while Ron sat across from him—a strategic, intentional move, an effort to make this dressing-down feel like less of a confrontation.
The protective potions he’d taken felt like ice in his veins, but his core was burning, like he was carrying the sun in his gut. It was impossible to hold. He wasn’t made for this. He wasn’t big enough or strong enough for this.
“You poor thing, how I’ve failed you.” Harry’s hands slid lower, fingers catching on the tied drawstring of the joggers. “I suppose I’ll just have to work twice as hard to fulfill that promise.”
He reached his room, tossing his jumper into the laundry basket and undoing his belt. As his hands slipped the leather out of the loops, he caught sight of the hideous, disfigured Dark Mark on his arm—the part of him that ultimately separated him from Harry, that had made them more than just schoolboy rivals. Enemies, in a War.
“Help!” he called, overwhelmed and frantic. The noise rose as people took notice and recognized him, then recognized his burden.
And so it continued—over and over, Harry was stared at, watched vigilantly, by a different person each time. But Draco could spot the similarities, after a while: in the way they held themself, in the intensity of their gaze, in the glass of brandy in their hand. He looked over at Ron.
Draco stared at him. “Then this will be a very one-sided conversation. But I am curious as to whether—the man you speak of—knows you’re here, discussing him,” Draco strained, feeling the tentative warning in his gut. It wasn’t painful, not yet, but it had the potential to be, if Draco said anything further about Harry or his condition.
“Bloody Seers can’t even help themselves,” he muttered at them. “Come on, we’re looking for one with mine and Draco’s name, maybe Lucius’.”
Draco thanked Timsy as he served them and returned to the kitchen, softly muttering about manners and cleanliness. Draco tried to keep the amused fondness out of his eyes, but according to Harry’s thoughtful look, he wasn’t successful.
He finally told Harry to let his thoughts drift however felt natural to him, to not try to control them, but simply allow his mind to flow how it was used to, and to open his eyes when he felt ready. Harry breathed for a couple more minutes before opening his eyes, where Draco waited, watching him. Harry grinned at him again, and Draco returned it, silently reveling in how good it felt to have Harry look at him with something other than rage or revulsion.
It was nearly time for a tap. Whatever that brewer had used was much stronger than Hermione’s version. At least he’d gotten his money’s worth.
The room was completely dark, except for several huge, glowing globes that Harry could barely make out through the dust from the busted door. The Space Chamber.
“Yes, yes, I know,” Pansy sighed, flapping her hand. “I can’t help it, gossip is in my nature, I’ll never stop asking.”
“I want to ask if that’s even real, but I know it is, I just fucking saw it,” Draco muttered, jaw clenched. Harry watched him silently with wide eyes, his body tense. Draco couldn’t stand it.
Draco sighed again and carefully extricated himself, standing fully and taking the duvet with him. He bent down and laid Harry’s wand at his side, hesitated, then pressed a kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
Smith finally pulled the license out of a long drawer of identical looking parchments, and flattened it against a nearby desk. Harry read it in the lamplight:
“You’ve performed a miracle, boy,” he said. Harry rolled his eyes, reluctantly pleased; Narcissa let out a soft huff.
His heart sped up unnecessarily as he felt the telltale wobble in the wards, but he kept his face blank and smooth. He heard the low rasp of Timsy’s voice welcoming someone, and barely had time to straighten his hair out one last time before the door to the study opened and Potter walked in.
His hair was getting long, and it was constantly in his eyes, but he didn’t trust himself to cut it. He made muggles uneasy, like this, and if he were to try to cut it magically, he couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t accidentally slice his own head off. So, it continued to grow.
and gasped as he was thrust into a memory. He felt a brief twinge of panic that wasn’t his own, and understood that this was definitely not supposed to be happening, but that they were here now, and they’d have to see this through to figure out
“I don’t know,” came the automatic, honest answer. It was true. Harry may have kissed him, made him a mixtape, testified for him, trusted him, saved his life—but he had also never wanted to see Draco again, had loathed him for years, had fought against him in a War, had attacked him in his study and walked away,
It just seemed so different from curses he’d worked on before. Curses usually caused pain, destruction, misfortune, grief, et cetera—hence the name. He still had scars on his chest from Potter’s curse on him in sixth year. A curse of silence would cause major inconvenience, and a significant life change, but people lived with disabilities like that every day. He would never say so to Potter, or his entourage, but this seemed… almost
Harry closed his eyes against the intensity of Draco’s gaze, which was not helping his heart rate. Neither were Draco’s hands on him, but he didn’t want that to stop at all. He opened his mouth to speak, to say
They finished their meditation, comfortable in their routine, now, and Draco raised his wand, waiting. Harry’s eye contact seemed more intense than usual, but Draco went with it.
The beautiful man in the sharp muggle suit, sliding a pale wand back into the chest pocket of his jacket, certainly did not look defeated. He looked expensive. He looked confident, he looked elegant. He looked like how Harry thought Draco Malfoy should look, and the effect on the twenty-five-year-old man Malfoy was now was infuriatingly attractive. Harry felt indignation building in his gut as clever grey eyes perused him. He could feel Ron and Hermione’s nervous gazes on him, but he continued glaring daggers at Malfoy, who slowly walked further into the room towards the bed, eyeing Ron warily.
He walked quickly down the hall to his study, once again facing the split chalkboard, as that Seer child’s hoarse voice started playing on a loop in his head.
his bowl of chicken soup nearly forgotten on the floor next to him. Occasionally he would hold up a record to show Draco, his face full of silent questions, which Draco dutifully answered.
The front door opened, interrupting his spiral, to reveal Timsy in the doorway, who was giving Harry one of his signature exasperated looks.
“I know why that was important, and formative to you,” Draco muttered, meeting Harry’s eyes. He said nothing else—it was too volatile. He waited for Harry to prod him for more, but thankfully, he didn’t. He simply continued watching Draco, silently.
He approached Draco casually, watching his pale face strain further. Draco stepped back, away from him, and Harry paused again as something
Lucius looked positively gleeful. If this were any other situation, Draco could have pretended that his father had just learned that his only son was in love, and was brimming with happiness for him. But Draco was chained to a chair, his father’s wand was aimed at his face, maneuvering him like a bloody toy, and Lucius had just discovered Draco’s greatest weakness.
Pansy laughed. “I thought the same thing, when the muggle at the shop sold it to me. I handled it like a volatile cauldron for weeks, before I realized it’s quite benign. I think they call it that because it emphasizes the bass in the music, or something.”
It was a large bird with bright, beady eyes, a white-feathered belly, and powerful, dark wings. Its beak was sharp and curved; a bird of prey. An osprey, Harry thought, though he hadn’t seen one since April, diving into the sea on Draco’s beach.
.” Draco could perhaps avoid the agonizing taste sensations with Occlumency, but he definitely couldn’t Occlude away a digestive emergency.
After a few moments, Harry opened his eyes, and gave Draco a look of such resignation and defeat that it was shocking.
“They said you’ll be free to go by the end of the day, Draco,” Hermione said matter-of-factly, perching on the end of his bed. “You were brought in for extensive physical and magical exhaustion, as well as a thorough potion detoxification—although it didn’t take nearly as long as they thought it would, because apparently someone had started the process using
The heavy door swung shut behind him, enclosing him in stifling silence. He made his way to his shelf and Conjured an empty vial, staring at the sheer number of memories. From the floor to the very top shelf, it was nearly full, as were the shelves around it—Harry must have filled at least half the shelves in this room. Maybe more.
Harry frowned—that last, somewhat cryptic sentence reminded him of Dobby. Something was hidden in there.
about it. He was sitting around, instead, being useless and creepy, stalling the Department of Mysteries, and kissing Draco whenever he wanted.
Harry’s magic finally returned to him, its job finished, and he released Draco’s wrists, opening his eyes.
“That was familiar,” Draco said. “I felt the same way when I first held Camila. The weight of the responsibility, and the complete and utter joy of it—it feels like the most important thing you’ve ever done, the highest honour, to have such a special place in that child’s life. To add to your family. It’s wonderful, isn’t it?”
He rearranged the furniture in every room, and wrote letters to Andromeda and Teddy and Molly. But he couldn’t make himself leave the house to see them, nor gather the nerve to invite them over and face their questions and confusion.
Harry kept a careful arm around him as he walked him inside, grabbing the muggle key out of Draco’s pocket, his cold, wet fingers fumbling with it in the door.
“Harry? The Specialist has arrived,” she said hesitantly, and Harry’s jaw dropped at the sight of the man who followed her in. The man turned and flicked his wand several times at the door as he closed it behind them.
things: Draco’s hair in Harry’s face, the solidity of Draco’s body, the sounds Draco made. Pretending, pretending, Draco’s hot breath on Harry’s lips, Draco’s fingers in Harry’s hair, Draco’s teeth on Harry’s neck—the way Draco mewled and whimpered for him, mindless and flushed with pleasure, his hand gripping Harry’s wrist hard enough to bruise—
Harry turned back to Ron and Hermione, whose eyes were widening at Malfoy’s words. Apparently they were all thinking the same thing.
Harry obeyed, and didn’t make Draco sweat any more, which he was grateful for. The idiot had no idea how attractive he was, and it was so bloody annoying. Or maybe he did, and he enjoyed watching Draco squirm like this. Draco wouldn’t put it past him. He kept his face carefully neutral, and breathed until the heat left his cheeks, and felt in control of himself again. Crooking a finger in invitation,
But he didn’t want Harry to see him lie. Harry trusted his friends, and he trusted Draco, and he wouldn’t
Nothing. He waited for Parkinson to do her Life Detection spell, but she was silent. When Harry looked over at her, she was staring wide eyed at the archway.
“I fight off greedy men all the time, Potter,” she replied in a low voice. “And even after being hit with
Draco’s eyes snapped open as he remembered the frantic missive he’d been about to send. Had anyone found it, where he had dropped it on the floor? He’d left the window open—
Lucius snapped his head back to Draco, eyeing him suspiciously, thrusting his wand back in Draco’s face.
Draco smiled encouragingly and took a deep breath, building his defenses and selecting a couple of memories. He raised his wand. “I’ll cast and hold the Legilimency, while you just relax and keep up the shield charm, yeah? It doesn’t have to be very strong.” Harry nodded, and raised his wand. “Three, two, one,
Shacklebolt closed his eyes and sighed. “And thus I know that it’s true, because if you weren’t, you would have been much more surprised, and you’d have been able to deny it. I only wanted to confirm it. If you’re really working with him, that means he’s out of commission for at least six weeks, and I can’t wait that long,” Shacklebolt explained.
“Right,” Ron said after a moment. “I’m glad you noticed that. I was focused on their staring, and the annoying habit with their hand…”
house, there was no need for finery. Grey chinos, ivory cotton jumper, topped off with his beloved navy shirt-jacket—he was quite impressed with himself. Only he could make something so casual look so
“Come on, then, time for lunch,” Draco said, voice coming out more hoarsely than he’d liked as he made his way to the door, not bothering to see if Harry would follow.
Harry couldn’t read the title from his place in the room. He looked next to him to see whose memory this was, and wasn’t surprised to find his boss standing there. He didn’t recognize anyone else, but he recognized the robes.
The air was shoved out of Draco’s lungs as the secondhand impact of the Killing Curse punched him in the chest, but the glow continued, the breadcrumb was still going, and he couldn’t stop now even though he wanted to, for what could possibly come after death? But he knew Harry was alive, here, right in front of him, gripping his hand so tightly it hurt, and he had to continue.
not just Elder Wand type power—but you’d need the person’s own magic to shift the state of their consciousness, their energy. No one has ever tried.” She glanced up from the book, a worried look on her face. “She is still conscious?”
Potter sipped his coffee as he worked, kept warm by Timsy’s temperature regulating charms on the mugs. He raised his eyebrow at Draco, apparently surprised that the coffee was still perfect. Draco only murmured, “That would be Timsy’s doing.”
He laid the broom across his thighs and set the rag down, grabbing his wand to carefully balance and tighten the footholds. He jerked his head up at the boombox when he realized he was unintentionally bobbing his head to the beat of the next song,
He carefully lifted the Pensieve from its plinth and sent it floating back towards Potter. Potter stood as Draco returned, and continued watching him warily.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. Harry took a deep, stabilizing breath and clasped his hands together in his lap to keep them from shaking, but he nodded all the same. Draco quietly called Timsy for hot chocolate, which he brought with his typical unnatural speed. Harry took his mug gratefully, closing his eyes and sipping it carefully. Draco simply watched him, deep in thought, cradling his own mug in his hands.
have allowed Teddy to live a life like that. You’d have packed him and Andy up and dragged them to America, before letting Teddy grow up like you did, to hell with
“Ah,” Draco nodded, finally comprehending. “Right. Yes, I did the same thing with the floo from the Manor—as long as my mother is the one calling out the destination, she can come through, no problem. Except when a patient is present, of course,” he said, looking at Harry, who only continued to grin at him. Draco wondered if it was as surreal to Harry as it was to himself, seeing a Malfoy here with Harry and his friends.
They sat in those flimsy plastic barstools, and Harry chuckled when Draco carefully unfolded his paper napkin and set it in his lap. Draco only rolled his eyes, then closed them, and took a long, deep breath. Like he was
Potter sat back and listened, fingers rubbing the armrests again, his face intent, but Draco thankfully could see neither contempt nor pity. He just listened, and accepted. He’d probably experienced Bellatrix’s wrath first hand as well.
“Harry,” Draco’s voice broke, and his arms couldn’t hold him up anymore. He crumbled clumsily, his entire body shaking violently as he hit the floor next to Harry, staring at him in disbelief. He heard Pansy’s soft footsteps advancing, then her quiet grunt and a
“I attacked him,” Harry said quietly. “I lost control of my magic, I pulled my wand on his throat, I—I told him he didn’t know me.”
“Relax, Harry,” he murmured, feeling Harry’s muscles tensing beneath his hand. His chest tightened as Harry took a deep, slow breath, meeting Draco’s eyes. He still looked so nervous, which was certainly not conducive to dancing.
The weather wouldn’t have made for a good flight, and Draco was still feeling drained from the Veritaserum, so they spent their midday break inside. Draco hadn’t even tried Legilimency after that ordeal. They’d spent the morning in their chairs, discussing the theory, brainstorming who might have such bizarre motives, and coming up blank.
The silvery glow vanished, and memories swirled around him haphazardly, almost desperately, disorienting him. Draco cursed under his breath. “Lost it,” he grumbled. “Hang on, I’ll find it…”
, and Draco was afraid. Afraid of being too much, afraid of Harry’s view of Draco changing drastically in this moment. A frankly
Harry raised his eyebrows, his lips spread in a disbelieving smile. Draco scoffed, remembering Harry’s nervous, awkward dancing at the Yule Ball in fourth year.
Malfoy shot him an unimpressed look. “Yes, six weeks, and that’s on the shorter end of the timeline. The mind is absolutely gargantuan, and we have to pay attention to every detail. If we’re keeping the analogy, we’re literally scouring the forest floor for breadcrumbs. You can’t rush through it, as missing a crumb or taking a wrong turn could set us back even farther. Plus, we have to recover any lost memories first.”
to break into the Ministry and into the DoM back in ‘96. Lucius had set a trap for us, and there’s no way he could have done it without the Unspeakables’ help. You know how tight security is here.”
Draco let out a shout as his core was attacked again, it felt like a hippogriff was digging through his torso, pulling and ripping with its sharp beak, like it was trying to tear something out of him—
“Damn, that’s still creepy, isn’t it?” Harry frowned, propping his chin in his hand. The frown wouldn’t hold.
Draco gasped as the glow disappeared, and withdrew quickly from Harry’s head. They both sagged heavily, breathing hard. Draco felt as if he had just swum the Channel. He knew that Harry would only feel worse, right now. He held tight to Harry’s hand.
Harry’s left hand was slowly, languidly sliding up his shoulder, landing softly on the back of Draco’s neck, pulling them even closer together, so that Draco could feel the heat radiating off of Harry’s body. Harry’s face was turning slightly, his nose gently brushing against Draco’s jawbone. Draco wondered if he even knew he was doing it, but then the hand gripping his own carefully released it and moved to Draco’s upper arm, instead, and Draco’s freed hand fell to Harry’s side, sliding around to his back, and that was
“What’s your name?” Draco tried, hating how the words all blended together when they came out of his mouth. His cellmate hesitated a moment, dark, shiny eyes still trained on him, before answering.
Harry thought about it for barely two seconds before giving Draco a short nod. He put his mocha down and sat up straight, closing his eyes, taking some deep breaths to prepare himself.
His gaze landed on Harry’s holly wand, laying on the coffee table between them, next to his glasses. His face looked so different without them—he looked defenseless, and so young. Draco felt privileged, to be trusted like this, but he needed it to end, very soon, needed to stop this uncomfortably familiar ache in his ribs.
pretending to read. The colour in Harry’s cheeks was darkening by the second. He’d probably noticed by now, but knew that turning it around would instantly give him away. As if everyone else in the room hadn’t already noticed.
“Alright, well,” Draco started, “I think we ought to begin with that memory of the incident. I don’t have to go back in your head for it, if you’d rather pull it out for the Pensieve, we can watch it again together. We might be able to make out more details that way, without the nausea. It’ll still be hazy, but we’ll only be watching.” He’d rather not endure the full experience again if he didn’t have to.
or I will Stun you and drag you out of here by your feet. The Prophet would lose their minds,” Ron grinned deviously, reminding Harry suddenly of Fred. Harry couldn’t see a way out of it—Ron was apparently quite serious. He sighed and stood, but continued glaring. He’d go, but he didn’t have to be
“Then do so, you berk,” he replied, delighted when Harry’s mouth slipped into his favourite tiny smile.
“On what? ‘Department of Mysteries?’ Seems pretty broad,” Ron replied, leaning back on his hands, and Hermione shook her head.
“It matters.” Malfoy’s eyes darted between Harry’s. Harry furrowed his brows, his vague curiosity slowly transforming into dull annoyance. “A
ask him. He somehow found out I’m working with Harry, and will be glad to provide any information to speed up his healing—he’s quite impatient.” Draco rolled his eyes again. “We’re well acquainted, I assure you,” he muttered, with a quick glance at Harry, who was apparently very interested in something on the wall.
And with that, Draco finally felt himself return to reality. He looked down at their joined hands. Harry looked, too—his face was curious. Draco carefully pulled his hand away, resting it in his own lap. He lightly rubbed the faint red marks on his fingers, left by the tight grip of Harry’s hand.
Potter’s eyes met his again, emerald green on sterling silver, with a glaring intensity that made Draco sigh and lower his wand. He hadn’t cast anything, but Draco could read his expression:
He furrowed his brows, trying to make sense of his turbulent thoughts. Draco continued to stare at him, a blush appearing high on his fine cheekbones, his grey eyes wide and questioning and a little terrified. He opened his mouth to speak.
He focused on what he could feel, other than feeling like he’d been run over by an erumpent: a soft, cotton shirt and joggers, hospital standard. A sub-par pillow under his head, slightly elevated. Low thread count sheets under his right hand, laying against his side, and something warm was moving in his left hand. He’d have to open his eyes, then. He blinked against the bright, floating hospital lights, directing his gaze toward his left hand.
Harry did, taking the brown bag with him, and Draco made his way to the sitting room to fetch his record player. He spared one longing look at the boombox, which still held the mysterious mixtape, before selecting a record and floating the record player across the house to the sunroom.
Timsy served them falafel for lunch—he was a fan of it, lately, even though Draco didn’t see the appeal of the handfuls of little sprouts Timsy stuffed in the pitas. Harry ate the whole thing.
Harry nodded slowly in understanding, his eyes still roaming Draco’s body. His thumb absently rubbed the scars on the back of his right hand.
“Alright, Potter,” Malfoy said, drawing their attention. “I’ll give you an overview of how this is going to work.”
As her echoing vocals faded out, Draco sighed again in satisfaction. He turned his head to the side to look at Harry, who was still sat on the floor, jean-clad legs out in front of him, ridiculous socked-feet crossed at the ankles. His hands were folded in his lap, his back against the shelves, his head tipped back and his eyes closed. He looked peaceful. He looked like how Draco felt.
“We’re leaving, Patricia,” Ron said to his secretary as they left the office. Patricia raised her eyebrows, but said nothing, as usual. “You can go home early if you want.”
“They have.” Willem nodded. His cheeks were a little pink, maybe from the wind. “It was quick, I’ll say that much.”
“I’m amazed you only got one detention that year, the amount of mischief you got up to,” Draco commented. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Because I wanted to,” the words flooded out of Draco’s mouth. “Because I knew I should, as a Healer, because I owe you a life debt, because I was curious, because I wanted the challenge, because I wanted the opportunity to really get to know you, after I mucked up so many chances, and for you to see me as the man I’ve become.” Draco gasped. The potion hadn’t let him take a breath through that word vomit. He hoped Harry’s other questions required shorter answers.
“Masters will not be eating Timsy’s cooking with Masterses hands being filthy,” Timsy croaked quietly, and Draco half expected him to roll his huge eyes.
Harry looked down at his hands, which were clamped firmly on his own legs. He prised his fingers off, opened his notebook slowly, and clicked his pen.
“They kept moving their hand to the back of their neck, turning their head a little to reach their hair. They even did it when they were someone with short hair, they couldn’t help it. My guess is probably a woman, with long hair. Hermione does that with her hair, sometimes—“ Ron looked over at his wife, who subconsciously reached toward her tumbling, bushy curls. “—you reach behind your neck, and sweep it over your shoulder to the front.”
it was Draco Malfoy who made him feel like this, who set his blood on fire, who made him throw his self-control out the window and just
Whatever the reason, Draco gathered that only one aspect of this bit of news was important to him: his mother was grieving, and she had been grieving for months now, and she had kept it from him, knowing how he felt about his father.
“You need to go,” he said gruffly. “The hospital here won’t be able to help her. I don’t know where the nearest magical one is. She’s dying, Harry.”
Harry pressed closer, their chests brushing, Harry’s nose grazing Draco’s cold cheek. He could feel Draco shaking, could hear the sound of his own heartbeat racing in his ears, and he knew Draco would be able to hear it, too. Harry’s hands came up to rest tentatively on his chest, and Draco let out a soft whimper.
The chalkboard still took up a large portion of Draco’s wall where his bookshelves usually existed. Draco’s feeble notes on
“At that moment it was a private battle of wills, wasn’t it? You wouldn’t ever have given her the satisfaction of knowing she got to you. But you also knew it was bigger than that… because she was the hand of the Ministry. It wasn’t just you versus Voldemort, anymore, or a simple matter of what was right or fair or not. It was bigger than just you—the fight became
That sequel you're waiting on? It's well over halfway done, and it's over 100k of fluff and smut and
Draco put his hands on his knees, focusing on his breathing, on slowing his thoughts, on building up his Occlumency walls.
While Harry meditated, Draco worked on his Occlumency walls, building them up as formidably as he could. It was more dangerous, now that he’d let his guard down like that once. It would be too easy to subconsciously do it again, while he was in Harry’s head, to pull himself closer and let himself drown in Harry, like he desperately wanted to. Draco closed his notebook and waited, rubbing the Dark Mark on his arm through his sleeve, reminding himself of exactly
good kiss, but he eventually made this odd noise so I stopped and he doubled over, he looked really ill, I thought he was just really regretting it or something, or that I’d—”
“Draco’s magical core was bound to the three tenets of Healer’s Ethics, in order to get his Healer License: to protect patient confidentiality, to do no intentional harm, and to maintain ethical standards in Healer-patient relationships. He physically can’t talk about you or your case to anyone else without your expressed consent—we had to watch that happen, before you arrived, that night. It hurts him, terribly, even when he’s being as vague and generic as possible.”
protected. It felt like coming home, like a fond smile and a tight embrace; it felt like wisdom and reproach and kisses on the top of his head, it felt like
Nevertheless, he fell asleep almost immediately, under a blanket of Narcissa Malfoy’s resilient, stubborn comfort.
Harry’s grin widened. He looked past Malfoy toward the peaceful, modest cottage, then backwards to the serene, secluded shoreline, and finally back to Malfoy himself, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his peacoat, his long hair in its loose plait tucked into an old green and silver scarf, the sleepy and affronted frown on his unfairly attractive face. Harry raised his eyebrows instead of answering.
“I did. Erm… Loudly.” A choked little noise from Draco. Harry winced, and Draco rubbed his cheek again. Gentle.
Draco unlocked the secret cabinet and pulled out the Pensieve, floating it over towards where Harry stood, in the middle of the room. He plucked the vial labeled “Dobby” off the thin shelf, and made his way back to Harry.
As soon as Draco finished reading, words were coming out of his mouth, beyond his control. Harry felt horrible. “Because I don’t want to take any chances that you won’t believe me, and because that’s how much they normally used on me, so I assumed you would want me to use that much, too.”
Draco locked eyes with him, frantically trying to push himself into Harry’s head, hearing the quiet choking sounds from Harry’s mouth. His face was reddening as he struggled to draw breath, and still, he did nothing to defend himself. Draco could now hear Boran in the cell behind him, his whimpering steadily growing louder, more distraught.
Of course he did. He couldn’t help it, he never could stay away from Draco. He took another step, and another, closing the space between them, even as Draco backed himself against the balustrade.
“I’m sorry, Mother,” he murmured, holding her gaze with his own. He wasn’t sorry about Lucius, and Narcissa knew that. He was sorry that his mother was in pain, and hadn’t felt she could confide in Draco.
He brought it all to the sofa, wrapping Draco up until all Harry could see of him was his face and a glimpse of messy blond hair. He sat down and pulled Draco close again, their bodies pressed together from knees to shoulders. Draco ignored the tea and leaned into him, sighing in satisfaction, making Harry’s heart skip.
Harry gave a non-committal grunt as they approached the floos in the Atrium. As his eyes darted around, he noticed Collins at Registration looking dazedly across the room—was he
Draco took the hint for what it was: hiding his Mark like that was another barrier between them, another thing that Draco could hide from Harry, when Harry could hide nothing from Draco. He cleared his throat, and made his way to the study, feeling very exposed. He left his sleeves rolled up, but took his wand out of his pocket and cast a swift
It was a bedroom—Narcissa’s, by the look of it. Spacious and opulent, yet soft. Pale blue curtains hung around the bed and the open windows, swaying in the spring breeze. Harry walked gingerly into the room, his curiosity piqued by the sight of framed photographs on the bedside table.
They stared back at him, and Ron raised one eyebrow at the vast amount of information left out of that sentence. Harry grimaced, but continued.
Weasley looked relieved, as if he had just remembered this fact. Draco wondered if he knew about Draco’s bonds, working for the Ministry—the licenses were public records. “Right. Well, thank you. We’ll see you later today then, Healer Malfoy.” He stuck out his right hand: a peace offering, even though his face twisted a little in what looked like pain.
“Well, Scorpius,” Harry chuckled, “if you one day have The Fellowship of the Ring completely memorized, I’ll be very impressed. But you won’t be able to remember it unless you read it.”
Pansy smirked at him. “You put it in a tape player,” she replied. “I’ll get it out of you eventually, you know. You’re shit at keeping things from me.”
“Because there were memories I wanted to keep for myself,” Harry said, waiting for comprehension to dawn on Draco’s face. “The memories I shared got shorter and more vague, until they took notice and demanded more. Then, I created false ones.”
that I love you, Draco,” Harry urged. “We have… time, for the rest. Don’t we?” He hated how small his voice sounded.
Harry threw his arms around Draco’s neck as Draco reached down and lifted Harry’s thighs, wrapping them around his waist, holding him up against the pillar. Harry held on, with Draco’s anger and grief and hunger crashing down on him, and didn’t let go.
“Once we’re more comfortable, I’ll go ahead and run through the memories of the pub, and if you’re alright with it, I’ll remove them myself, and put them in a vial for you.”
Draco shifted back into human form, immediately looking away from Harry as the scrunchie that was around his face snapped off and flew into the depths of the bedroom. He scrambled into a sitting position, scrunchies shifting around him like a terrible neon mockery of his own roiling emotions. Looking down at his pajama-clad knees, he cleared his throat roughly.
Lucius when I do, but to do so, we need to get to Kingsley, we need to get those bonds removed, and we need to hear that prophecy, so if you’re insisting on coming, let’s
Draco kept the eye contact for a moment, softening his face. It was true, Harry Potter had no reason to trust Draco Malfoy—but he needed to get through this moment if they were going to cure Potter at all. Even if it had to happen in the presence of the entire Golden Trio.
Draco led the way out of the study, straight to the kitchen, where he could hear Timsy cooking and humming something out of tune quietly to himself. It smelled incredible, and—Draco grinned with anticipation—luxurious. He summoned two water glasses and filled them with his ice-cold lemon aguamenti charm. Harry took a glass gratefully, sitting down across from Draco at the table.
“Agreed, Granger, not a fun story. But the breadcrumbs are the best analogy here. Sometimes, I have to find all of the breadcrumbs and connect the dots, which together make a countercurse,” Draco explained. “Sometimes the patient has been thrown into their unconscious mind, and has to be guided along a trail to find their way back.” He suppressed a shudder. He hated venturing into an unconscious. They were bloody huge and nonsensical and near impossible to navigate.
Timsy looked down, defeated. He was standing in a corner of the room, next to a defensive looking Pansy Parkinson. “Timsy is trying, but Master Draco’s magic is being quiet, delicate, not as loud as Harry Potter’s. Timsy cannot find him the way he is finding Harry Potter.”
“I’m an accomplished Occlumens, Harry—you’ll only see what I want you to see. I have some places I think you’d enjoy, if you want a—a recess,” Draco offered. “You don’t have to perform the spell, either, all it’ll take is a nonverbal shield charm, which I
“Where are we?” Draco added, to another one of Boran’s little shrugs. Draco paused, thinking hard, staring at the child.
so I thought maybe that was a standard dosage for the bloody Department of Magical Law, and I didn’t want to risk Harry not believing me. If Harry Potter had accused me, I’d have been in Azkaban by nightfall, do you understand? Absolutely
The second Draco tried to move, however, the tiny figure flinched violently, which made Draco’s heart ache.
Pansy slides drink number four across the table, floating empty drink number three back to the bar. Draco sighs, and picks it up, grimacing at the stickiness on the bottom of the glass. At the bar, this week’s loser has his finger hooked into the belt loop on Potter’s ghastly muggle jeans. Draco feels sick. He can’t bring himself to take a sip.
“I’m sorry,” he muttered again, one arm falling away from where it hugged his own waist. “I don’t know what came over me. It won’t happen again.”
“Right, so, we’ve been going through these for ages, and you’ve obviously seen them, but only once, and you know a lot more about the curse and the attacker and how it all worked—” Hermione was rambling, and the blood was draining from Draco’s face, because why was she talking about this, when Harry wasn’t here and he
“Timsy is requiring a wand,” Timsy’s rasping voice was barely over a whisper. “Timsy is needing Master Draco’s magic in Harry Potter’s mind.”
He slipped the key onto the chain, then the chain over his head. He looked down at his chest, where the key dangled casually against his sternum.
Harry trailed off, and the kitchen descended into silence once more. He crossed his arms over his chest, scowling indignantly.
“Ah, you’re trying to quit again,” Potter mutters. Draco hears him lean against the wall, the rustle of his old leather jacket against stone, the sizzle of the end of the cigarette as Potter lights it for himself.
him—he felt sharp pain in his knees and assumed he’d hit the floor, as his father’s voice sounded again, above him, much closer, and his vision was darkening and fuzzy around the edges—
Hours later, Harry would add another smile to his collection: something sated and satisfied, affectionate and anxious, that incisive curl of Draco’s lips somehow softer with piercing, blood-stained teeth behind it.
“Do I know you from somewhere?” Willem asked quietly. Harry sighed and looked away, back to their maps.
“Granger,” Draco nodded at her, “you have a lovely home.” He glanced over at Weasley, to include him in the sentiment, which was true: the cottage was lovely, filled with warm colours and hand knit blankets and plenty of photographs. There was a gentle fire going in the hearth in the sitting room, and the whole thing felt rather comforting, soothing Draco’s nerves a bit, even as his eyes darted around in his typical paranoia.
“Horcruxes,” Draco’s mouth answered involuntarily, and he winced as Lucius’ eyes widened. This was the absolute
Draco took it, and immediately recognized it as his own—the same handkerchief he’d given Harry at St. Mungo’s, that very first day. He huffed with a weak laugh.
“Please, let me in and I’ll tell you everything, Malfoy. You know I wouldn’t be here except as a last resort.”
Harry looked like he wanted something else from Draco, but didn’t know how to ask for it. Draco had an idea of what it might be.
Harry felt warmth return to his limbs as he ate, the tingling feeling left his fingers and toes. His breathing slowed, and he saw Malfoy’s shoulders release the tension they held, apparently satisfied with Harry’s improvement. Harry was still struck by the fact that Draco Malfoy had just made him feel better, without even thinking twice about it.
The three Gryffindors were quiet, taking in the information. Potter still looked a little spooked, so Draco decided to let him recover. His own mind was buzzing with theories, none of them helpful at the moment. Today’s work was done.
Draco withdrew, carefully. He made a new dot on the board, and labeled it “Patronus - Prongs”. He let down his Occlumency barriers, and felt everything he needed to feel about that moment, while gingerly rubbing the tops of his thighs. He watched Harry closely—his eyes were currently closed, but his face was smooth, even as he gripped the armrests of the chair.
conversation with something or someone who didn’t immediately think you were… different, who simply spoke to you as you are,” Draco muttered, thinking hard, carefully avoiding that awful word:
Harry eventually deemed him not-dying, and released him, making his way back to the chair. Draco followed him, trying to rub feeling back into his face.
Harry cast, as soon as the door clicked shut. Ron and Hermione looked at him sharply, questioning. He met each of their eyes, full of intent, hoping they knew him well enough to understand this.
After too many long minutes, Parkinson, Kingsley, and Smith had unravelled the threads of magic, and held them out straight and parallel to each other, waiting for Harry’s move. Harry raised his wand, and thought of the way Draco had leaned his tear-streaked face into Harry’s hand, the feel of his soft hair in Harry’s fingers—that must have hurt him, too.
When Draco Malfoy got up in the air with Harry, he was the same sneering twelve-year-old, in the body of an attractive man, with a few more tricks up his sleeve.
Ron asked dangerously, not taking his eyes off of Harry, who was only staring straight at Draco. Draco raised his hands, conciliating.
“I met your godson, yesterday,” Draco mentioned as they settled themselves in their usual chairs. He wondered idly if he’d ever see that chair as anything other than
for them, Harry! You know you were a pawn your entire childhood, just like I was—you think just because they’ve promoted you to a knight, this time, that you’re anything more than a
Harry rubbed his face with his hands, gathering himself, before finally looking back up at Draco. Draco could see the helpless dread in his eyes. He must have been thinking that every breadcrumb would be something painful like that. Draco didn’t know—he hoped not, but it was possible. Likely. Harry had a lot of pain in his past, he knew.
the ins and outs of Draco’s work, who had signed off on the approval of his magical bonds, and who was here discussing a patient with him, anyway.
But it was Thursday, it was almost nine o clock, and this room, this sanctuary, was made for honesty. Draco would have to share his suspicions, even if they might cause Harry to attack, or flee.
His shoulders and chest had broadened, his thighs filling out those soft-looking jeans like they were made just for him. His pale hand curled protectively around the door frame, one socked foot on his doorstep, halfway over the threshold. Harry’s eyes finally met his, like a collision of metal and flint, sparking a familiar, incendiary feeling in his gut. They were the same colour as the silvery clouds above him, somehow the brightest thing around, even as they narrowed in blatant suspicion and hostility.
Even in those early days of May, it felt limited. Like counting down days in cups of tea and plates of burnt bacon. Counting down to what, or when, Harry didn’t quite know, but he hated to think about it. He savoured every moment, every flash of Draco’s mischievous smile, every brush of his hand, every night of heat and skin and the incredible sounds he could pull from Draco’s lips, memorizing the way the moonlight illuminated his body beneath Harry’s.
Harry leaned down and kissed him thoroughly, demonstrating exactly how he’d prefer to spend his time today, stealing Draco’s breath. Harry kissed the same way he did anything else: vibrantly, intensely, with his entire being. Harry’s kisses were completely enthralling, all-consuming, and Draco couldn’t get enough.
“Let’s do a bit more breath work, and we’ll go back in, alright?” Draco suggested, sitting up and placing his hands on his knees. He pushed his glasses up into his hair, which he knew looked ridiculous, but his appearance was not his priority at the moment, when he felt he might be losing his grip. He was a
“The third reason,” Draco paused, but made himself continue, “is sheer curiosity.” Harry’s face smoothed out, carefully blank. He
Harry held up his mauled pink macaron incredulously, inspecting it, as if he’d see Malfoy’s initials carved in the bottom or something. “Malfoy bakes
“Come along, Draco,” Lucius called, almost cheerfully, standing just outside the bars with his wand at the ready. Draco didn’t have time to react before his body was moving without him again, walking towards the bars without his consent, every muscle stiff and spasming in its fruitless struggle against the reins.
Potter looked thoughtful, but his eyes flashed again, with something like excitement. Draco assumed Auror Potter would probably be raring to go, eager to investigate and finally catch the bad guy. But he waited for Draco to continue.
Draco subtly looked over at him occasionally, and each time, Harry’s eyes were on the ground in front of him, lost in thought, that tiny, contented smile stuck to his face. It was the brightest thing around, among the heavy, rolling fog.
“I just wanted to let you know your latest observations are well appreciated,” Kramer declared, sprawled in his leather chair. “Truly, Potter, you’ve been a diligent and consistent Unspeakable for a decade. I’ve always been impressed and satisfied with your work.”
but he wouldn’t be able to talk about this with anyone but Harry, without Harry’s consent, and where was Harry? Would he be working? Pansy had said he’d gone back to work, and
“Now, back to business,” he declared, shaking himself out and taking a deep, stabilizing breath. “I didn’t see anything that particularly stuck out to me as a clue, but the memories were flying past me rather quickly. Tomorrow, when we go back in, we’ll do more meditation. It helps slow things down, in your head. I’ll be able to look more closely. But since we’re nearly finished for today, how about I grab those memories from the pub?”
was probably gushing over them,” Pansy declared, standing up to clear the table. Draco stood to help.
Harry knew where Ron’s mind was going, and he didn’t like it at all—though it made sense. Ron set down his notebook.
to do it, that’s the point there. You’d saved lives before—multiple times, by then—but those times you were only doing what you had to do. This was quite different. This was a much more conscious decision, and I’ll bet it had an impact on you later in life, didn’t it?” Draco was musing to himself again, but Harry was following along now, and he nodded, grabbing his notebook to write.
Harry could count the number of times he’d seen Draco smile this year on one hand, but he was proud to know that he’d been the cause of every single one. The first had been thanks to Harry calling him
“What’s this, then?” Draco asked, amused. He took the object from Harry’s hand, and read Harry’s handwriting on a piece of paper inside the plastic:
“Yes, of course! I was particularly intrigued by your work on the Unstoppable Nightmare Curse, how you were able to guide the patient through the nightmares to find the personalized counter curse pieces in each one, utterly fascinating, and the False Tongue Curse, with that witch who could only speak to people in languages they didn’t understand, were you really able to—”
He’d berated himself for already feeling homesick, for not acting like a proper Malfoy heir, for being childish, for being
“Pull the other one,” Malfoy scoffed, then stared blankly when it became clear that Harry was serious. “
That was enough to make Harry pause. He had never heard Malfoy say anything negative about Snape—he’d never thought Malfoy would admit Snape was a fucking
Draco wiped the tears from his eyes with his finger. “Oh, Merlin,” he breathed, still chuckling. “If chasing down Dark wizards doesn’t work out, Auror Potter, you’ll definitely have a career waiting in pantomime.” Draco giggled some more, and Harry rolled his eyes, still smiling. “But yes, you should absolutely hand over your Order of Merlin to Timsy. He was roasting into the wee hours of the morning, you know, the dedication he has to providing the best coffee in Wizarding Britain is unsurpassed. Now, finish the sandwich our hero has so graciously prepared for you.”
He walked to the shelves next to his broom rack and picked up the small package he’d received the previous day, tossing it to Harry, who caught it with typical Seeker reflexes, looking back up at Draco with a question in his eyes.
Now that he was home, he needed to think, but his stomach chose that moment to growl. He couldn’t hear any sounds from the kitchen—Timsy must have been out shopping, then. Right—it was Tuesday, Timsy always did the shopping on Tuesdays.
Scowl firmly back in place, Draco reluctantly stepped aside to allow him in. Weasley let out a relieved huff and hurried past him into the foyer, where Timsy was waiting to take his cloak. Draco stepped around him and began walking to the sitting room.
He held her up to his face, examining her. Harry watched with barely contained fondness, pressing his lips together to stifle the silly grin.
“I can’t believe it,” Draco giggled. “I thought she was just being strange and imaginative. But it was always those words, exactly. I should have known.”
Potter looked back at him, his face guarded, still carefully not making eye contact. This was definitely going to be a job for the fucking books.
Harry’s eyes were wide. He looked somewhere between afraid and upset. He looked uncomfortable. His eyes were darting around the room, his hand twitching for his wand. Draco’s ears were ringing.
“She also loved having people’s secrets, throwing their vulnerability in their faces. She outed me to my parents, when she thought I was taking too long to fulfill Voldemort’s… task. It took me six months of rigorous training, on my own, to learn enough Occlumency to keep her out. Thank Merlin I was at school most of the time.”
Timsy waved a hand in the direction of the study, though Harry already knew where it was. Harry stepped quietly down the hallway, pausing for just a second in front of the wooden double doors to the study, mentally preparing. As if there was any way to prepare himself for this sort of thing.
Harry soon rolled his eyes and gave an exasperated sigh, but took his hand anyway, the same as Draco’s previous dance partner. Draco pulled him up with a quietly victorious chuckle and led him off the blanket.
The quick flashes were expected, even with the meditation, and he rode it out, while softly explaining himself to Harry.
, all the time, with Draco around. He’d known that for a while, and this moment was a vehement reminder. As the Weasleys slowly recovered, their expressions much less hostile and much more curious, Harry forgot everything around him, his mind consumed with one, resounding thought:
“Because,” Harry began, setting down his knife, “by February, I was… selectively choosing which memories to give them.”
light came from the edge of the bed, silhouetting Draco’s figure. Harry breathed a sigh of relief, until he heard Draco sniffle, and understood what had woken him up.
The corners of Harry’s lips turned up in a cruel smile, that widened as he caught up with Draco, whose steps seemed to be accelerating quickly, the orange glow of the streetlights illuminating a thin sheen of sweat on his brow.
The corner of Harry’s lips turned up in a smirk. He gave an exaggerated nod, reminding Draco of one of his old tutors, when he had finally understood a difficult lesson as a child.
Pansy stared at him in pure shock for a moment, and then slowly, her perfectly shaped eyebrows started drawing down, her eyes darting from his face to his chest, and Draco started to panic a little as he could practically
we’re talking about. Why would I risk that?” Draco was pretty much talking to himself now, his hand half-covering his mouth, propping his chin up with his elbow on the armrest. He sighed, scrubbing his hand over his face and sitting up properly.
“Draco,” he urged, taking Draco’s wet face in his hands. His lips were turning blue again. He brushed away the long hair the rain had plastered to Draco’s face, and called him once more. “
Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione, in warning. He’d be blaming them entirely if this all went tits up. They were impervious to his glare, staring at Malfoy with identical stunned expressions.
It was Draco’s turn to look shocked. Muggles loved a metaphor, apparently. Ron turned his face towards Draco.
“Quite serious,” Draco answered. Harry could feel the smile against his neck. He pulled Draco’s hand down, bringing it close to his face. “She never elaborated on it. Though I did make her tell me what a
because apparently I’m a vulnerability to you, and you’re continuing to give your life away to them, piece by piece, like none of it is anything worth holding on to. How much more, until there’s nothing left? You’ve
“I don’t think I’ve quite grasped the enormity of what you’ve done,” he mumbled. “That painting… that wasn’t his imagination, was it?”
“I do visit muggle places, sometimes, but usually with Pansy, who’s much more comfortable around them,” Draco added. His fingers were tapping on his knee in agitation. Admitting a weakness never got any easier, no matter how often he did it.
It was a shame that he only ever traveled under threat. He might have liked to visit all those places, someday. He probably wouldn’t want to, after this, knowing them the way he knew the Isle now.
Harry’s lips quirked and he shrugged, even as he felt his cheeks heating. “Come on, it’s a classic. Essential to his musical education.”
“I had the same reaction, when I first saw Andromeda,” Draco muttered, smirking gently, lightening the mood a fraction. “Thank Merlin she didn’t see me, at first. It took me a moment to realize Bellatrix wouldn’t have been caught dead in jeans, and her magic was the antithesis of Bella’s.”
these days. If they were afraid of the prophecy coming true, of Draco getting this knowledge and possibly “rising higher” than his predecessors or his ancestors, they could have just left it alone. But they
“Alright, here it is,” Draco said, after several memories of planning with the goblin, eating meals with Bill and Fleur, despairing that Voldemort now had the Elder Wand. He spotted the glow in the corner of his vision, finally, latching on tightly. “Hang on—”
He was already in the clouds, it seemed. His hair stood on end the moment he’d hauled himself into the open air, raised by the charged friction in the turbulent atmosphere. He set his Cloak in a tight corner and hoped Narcissa would be able to keep it safe, while keeping him safe.
Draco mirrored her grin, but he reached his right hand out toward his mother, first. Narcissa wrapped her slender hands around his, her expression tortured. She looked as exhausted as the rest of them.
“Did I say something wrong?” Draco asked quietly. Harry shook his head slowly, that alarmed expression remaining. Draco watched him for a moment, searching his face, before looking away and picking up his mug from the table. This seemed to shake Harry out of his daze, and he did the same.
“This looks to me like it might be a mind curse,” Malfoy continued, “but we won’t know for sure until we get in there. I’ve certainly never seen anything like it—most silence curses simply remove one’s voicebox, physically. But curses inside the mind tend to leave clues, or marks, like… like breadcrumbs.'' He furrowed his brows, probably realizing how weird that sounded coming from his pureblood mouth. Harry understood, but was surprised by the reference.
Draco tipped his head up on Harry’s shoulder, lifting his eyes to meet Harry’s own. Harry felt it like sparks in his mind, every time—persistent collisions of metal and flint over dead, dry brush.
“I know,” Harry said, planting kisses in his hair. It did hurt. Harry still hurt, even with Draco in his arms. There was such an intoxicating relief, being
Harry continued to stare at him, like this was all new to him, like he hadn’t expected Draco to say anything at all.
“The Unspeakables have been developing this little potion for years,” Lucius mused, walking back towards the cell, the vial held delicately between two pale fingers. “The Department of Mysteries was a good investment, on my part. So quiet, so easy to underestimate.”
“We know where you live, you wanker,” Ron added, grinning. Harry’s chest felt warm, seeing Draco’s face turn pink.
“Okay,” he whispered. “Okay. That’s a start. I’m—I’ll figure it out, I promise.” He picked up the blanket from where it had fallen on the step. “Do me a favour and… look away, or something, because I’m going to climb in bed with your son.”
They sat there, regarding each other for long moments, recovering from their darker memories with the help of Timsy’s delectable hot chocolate. After a few minutes, Harry opened up his notebook again, clicking his pen, writing something carefully.
Draco eventually tired, his body sagging back against Harry’s chest. He leaned his head against Harry’s, weak with exhaustion.
He couldn’t be free from feeling responsible for the wellbeing of the Wizarding World, a burden that had been thrust upon him as a
Harry’s face was wet, too, and Draco knew he himself must look a right mess—he knew he got red and blotchy when he cried, Pansy had always told him it wasn’t a good look. But Harry looked like a tragic angel, because of course he did, the tosser. His eyes shone brighter against his smooth, brown skin, his lips a lovely rosy colour from pressing themselves together so hard, from the straight teeth currently biting them nervously.
And now Draco could hear Harry laughing for real, just soft breaths huffing out of his mouth. The rhythm matched almost perfectly to the bright, joyful laugh he was listening to in Harry’s head, and Draco could imagine how it would sound on Harry today, a little lower, a little rougher. Draco grinned.
Harry’s eyes darted around Draco’s face for a moment, before he slowly reached across the pile of flowers, took Draco’s left arm in his hands, and rolled his sleeve back up. He looked back up at Draco’s face, unreadable, and Draco wished he would just
Potter continues to watch him, no longer trying to make idle conversation. Draco’s had three drinks, so he’s staring, but not four—he still needs to move. He’s not yet suffocated by himself. And Potter is here, and Bellend of the Week is nowhere in sight.
The corner of Harry’s lips twitched; his eyes were amused. Draco wondered if he’d been expecting that question, after all. Harry turned towards the wall, raised one finger to it, and began drawing out letters.
“Draco,” Ron called from the doorway, as Draco pulled out his wand to disapparate. Draco looked up at him expectantly. “Thanks.”
could only be solved by a Legilimens who would be able to see the right memories and follow the trail?” Ron asked, and Draco could tell he was several moves ahead, in his mind. Draco glanced at Harry, who was still looking cautious, where he sat on a large pouf on the floor next to Draco’s armchair. His head was only inches from Draco’s hand, which itched to reach out and touch that tumultuous hair, just to see if it was as soft as it looked. He clenched his fist on the armrest.
after defeating Voldemort? There was no way. Maybe Shacklebolt was trying to manipulate information on Harry’s curse out of him. He was a politician, now, after all.
“So before we spend all our time watching Harry get chatted up and stared at,” Draco’s voice drawled as he motioned toward the Pensieve, “why don’t you tell me what you’ve already gathered from what you’ve seen, and share your theories?”
“Goodnight, Rose,” he replied, giving her a little wave and smiling to himself, already planning his venture for Grouch slippers. Mother and daughter disappeared into the hallway, and suddenly he was alone with Ron Weasley. Draco looked over at the man nervously.
In his enhanced, exposed, overstimulated state, the tear felt like a razor blade as it trailed down Harry’s cheek. He traced his finger over the painful words, surprised that there wasn’t blood in its wake.
“Will you stop interrupting me?” she snapped, shaking her head with a huff. Harry’s mouth clicked shut. She returned to her spells, her brow furrowed in concentration. “Well, at least you got the important part right.”
“I don’t have a Snitch at the moment,” Draco replied, and it was truly bizarre how he could just understand what Harry was trying to say, without actually reading his thoughts. “The last one I had, erm… got away from me.” He chuckled to himself. “But that’s what I get for playing a solo Seeker’s game in the middle of the night. We can just fly for today.”
“Thank you,” Harry said into her cloud of hair. Ron reentered the cubicle, his face falling with worry as he took in the scene. Harry held his arm out to him, and Hermione did the same.
“My name is Harry, as you probably know, but you may refer to me as Unspeakable Potter,” Harry said. The man’s eyes widened, his jaw tensing with anger. No one liked when the Unspeakables butted in. Harry wasn’t technically an Unspeakable, anymore, but he needed to use any leverage he could.
“He speaks,” Malfoy said flatly, looking annoyed and insulted. “I’d wondered if the Unspeakables had rendered him mute.” Harry rolled his eyes.
don’t have to have sex with a woman to get it,” Draco said, and Harry opened his eyes, furrowing his brows in confusion.
Timsy immediately popped into the room, with two steaming mugs of hot chocolate topped with homemade marshmallows. Harry had never seen an elf so fast and efficient, like he was in tune with Draco’s every need. His big, round eyes landed on Draco, assessing his current state, and he turned a surprisingly menacing glare on Harry.
Harry nodded and left, making his way to the Pensieve Room to deposit another memory. He walked leisurely, not in any hurry to see it again, and stuffed his hands in his pockets.
“Was that the first time you… you made the choice to spare someone’s life, even though they didn’t deserve it?” Draco asked.
At this, Harry’s smile fell, and his face turned guarded. Draco gave him a meaningful look. “Not about the breadcrumbs themselves, Harry,” he murmured. Ron and Hermione were watching the interaction sharply, wide eyes darting back and forth between Harry and Draco, probably shocked that there were parts of Harry’s healing he wasn’t keen on them knowing about—and at hearing Draco say Harry’s name,
Harry finally lifts his eyes to meet Draco’s—curious and a little apprehensive, and Harry knows it, knows him, knows him like he knows this kitchen, knows him like he knows he’s alive, now. Harry knows him, Harry
Harry didn’t move for a moment, eyes darting back and forth between Draco’s, taking a long, deep breath. Eventually, he shook his head, slowly. Draco nodded at him.
By the time his alarm went off Monday morning, he was in a similar mood as the morning before. As the minutes ticked closer to nine, his doubts became louder and louder. Why on earth had he agreed to this? There was no way to maintain a professional distance with Potter—there was just too much history between them, right? Surely there was somebody else with his particular skill set that could help Potter?
Harry’s hand grew sweaty in Narcissa’s, but he refused to let go. Hannah eventually forced him to sit down, so he’d be out of her way. He sat as still and unobtrusive as he could and tried not to think about how angry Draco would be, soon.
A mediwitch knocked twice and entered the room, holding a bar of Honeyduke’s chocolate. Malfoy took it from her with a quiet, “Thank you, Nanette,” which baffled Harry more. Had he ever heard Malfoy say thank you before?
He listened carefully, but could only hear the sounds of soft breathing, somewhere near him, and the occasional quiet chimes of the monitoring charms.
Potter was silent—of course he was. His face was tense, concentrating, like Draco was a difficult puzzle to solve. Which was alright, because Draco thought of Potter like a puzzle, too, albeit from more of a Healer’s perspective. The fire crackled quietly in the grate.
or something, and take such a matter into their own hands—” Sweet Merlin, this was so vague, and it still hurt. He tried to hold back a grunt of pain, looking at Harry’s friends intently, desperately trying to get his message across, “—which would probably endanger someone who was in a—a compromised state, while distracting them severely from their healing.”
Pansy’s house was smaller than Draco’s, but no less elegant. It was just enough room for her and Camila, and she liked it that way.
French restaurant in the world, apparently just for the glee of watching Harry fumble over the excessive silverware. Because he was a git—albeit a very, very sexy one.
to answer for, Potter,” Parkinson snarled, glaring murderously at him, completely unmoved by the three wands trained on her face.
Harry closed the heavy door behind him. Kramer stood by Harry’s shelf, his hands clasped behind his back, scrutinizing Harry’s memories.
“I, er. May have.” Harry looked down at Draco’s free hand, which had subconsciously picked up a yellow scrunchie, and was stretching it between thumb and forefinger, slipping it onto his thin wrist. “Quit.”
Draco woke slowly, consciousness returning to him in small pieces. He became aware of something cold and hard beneath him, of the smell of old stone and potions ingredients. Then of the stiff soreness of every muscle in his body—then of the last thing he remembered, the indescribable pain of his bonds, Lucius’ voice above him—
Draco walked across the Atrium to the line of golden grilles that housed the lifts, and the sound of his expensive shoes against the dark marble floor was quite satisfying. They certainly didn’t make this clear, authoritative
“Then it shouldn’t take very long at all, and you’ll be out of here in time for supper.” Malfoy slowly raised his hand towards his chest, but didn’t grab his wand yet. Harry’s muscles were already tensing with fight-or-flight. He was really going to sit there and take it while Draco Malfoy aimed a wand at him. What was
“You seem tired,” Draco observed, as Harry yawned again. He was cradling his coffee mug with both hands, absently rubbing the lip of it with his thumb. There were dark smudges under his eyes. Harry shrugged.
“I’ll do a basic mind-viewing, to see if our progress has revealed any sort of trail in your mind—I might be able to see how much of the path is left,” Draco offered. “But not now. You need a break, we both do. You must feel as though you’ve just finished running across the country,” he said, and Harry huffed, nodding.
Had he straightened it with magic in school or something? It had been slicked back and short most of the time—
as well as Narcissa, and felt a bit manic with how much he wanted to know what Harry would have told her. But he couldn’t ask, would never say a word about it.
“Yes.” She looked up from her stack of books, her hair doing that frizzing thing it always did when she was struggling with research. She looked exhausted. “What do you need?”
Draco’s index finger was idly tracing the tip of the scar on his collarbone again, inside the open collar of his shirt. He couldn’t relax enough to doze, with Harry Potter so close, asleep on the chestnut leather sofa opposite him. So Draco simply lay there, occasionally watching the afternoon light move across the ceiling, occasionally watching Harry sleep. It was so quiet—all Draco could hear was Harry’s soft breathing, matching the gentle rise and fall of his chest, and the intermittent chirping of a blackbird outside.
which was a little embarrassing, but it was the first thing he’d thought of, the first time he did this, and he couldn’t change it now. Harry raised his eyebrows, cautiously amused.
Harry sat still for a moment, eyes searching Draco’s expression. The morning light from the window was hitting the left side of his face, while the soft firelight danced on the other. Draco was mesmerized by the play of light on Harry’s skin.
completely overwhelming him. That was more convenient than transporting the damn things, Harry could admit, but exponentially more uncomfortable. Malfoys were so bloody
Draco handed Harry a carrot, just as Hera’s head poked around the side of a tree, stepping fully into the small clearing. She headed straight for Harry first, this time, making both of them laugh as Bubo swooped down, landing gracefully on Draco’s arm. Obligingly scratching behind Hera’s ear, Harry felt himself truly relax for the first time since Draco had healed him.
He was gone for a while. They could hear drawers opening and banging around, and Harry knew he was taking his sweet time about it to piss Harry off. It was working. They left the office to follow him, eventually, pressuring him to hurry it up, which made for an interesting sight: Zacharias Smith being followed around filing cabinets by the Chosen One, the Head Auror, the Minister for Magic, a house elf, and a divorce lawyer. Too bad no one else was around to witness it.
Harry had done some seriously unprecedented things in his life: youngest Hogwarts Seeker in a century, surviving a few duels against Voldemort, coming back from the dead. Telling Molly Weasley “no”. Eloping with a gorgeous, irascible, adorable, controversial former Death Eater. Breaking the news to Narcissa Malfoy over dinner and not throwing up from nerves even a little.
that a few eleven-year-olds could get past. He knew Voldemort was after it, and he could have destroyed it at any time, but he waited until Harry Potter, a fucking
bearing a tray of coffee with fixings, and, to Draco’s horror, not his suede house slippers, but his
Draco steered his broom away from the house, wanting to show Harry how far out the wards extended, hoping it would help his peace of mind. Harry followed him, performing an occasional loop or barrel roll, and Draco knew that if he could, he would be laughing with unbridled joy.
Apparently, Ron could. “No, he doesn’t mean the Manor. He has a place of his own,” he answered, with a meaningful glance at Hermione. Ron didn’t wince or shudder at the memory of Malfoy’s “place,” so Harry assumed it wasn’t too bad.
But Harry looked away, abruptly, looking down at Draco’s shaking hands, which were slowly moving up towards Harry’s chest.
“I know,” Draco smirked. “As if you need another ridiculous title to add to your list of epithets. When you do finally croak, they won’t be able to fit all of them on your gravestone,” he said dryly. Harry chuckled silently at him, eyes still shiny from tears now twinkling with amusement.
Ronald,” she growled. Sometimes, Harry couldn’t believe they were married. “I mean, look at this library! The elves said she hid away in here after every book club, do you see
“I enjoyed our visit, Teddy,” Narcissa smiled at him. “I look forward to the next one.” She turned to her sister, holding out the hand Teddy had just released. Andromeda took it and squeezed it gently, and they grinned softly at each other. Narcissa seemed just as awed at the prospect of family as Draco did.
Harry thought for a moment, and touched his finger to his nose with a smirk. “You could smell me?” Draco guessed, and Harry nodded. “That’s a good place to start. Soon you’ll be able to tell, it’ll feel a bit crowded. You’ll experience your own memories, but we’ll see the same things. You’ll feel the presence of a spectator, again, like someone is watching from right behind you, just out of sight.”
Harry’s face was full of understanding, and Draco was filled with the usual regret of the cowardly Death Eater he used to be. They simply stared at each other for a moment, digesting the knowledge.
He stood up from where he knelt in front of the grate, and dusted off his knees. He placed the odd cassette tape back on the shelf next to his records, and adjusted his suit jacket, smoothing out nonexistent wrinkles in his waistcoat. It was a bit of a statement for him to wear anything other than robes to the Manor—it asserted his independence, and would hopefully reaffirm to his mother that he indeed did not belong there. He took deep breaths, trying to calm his racing pulse.
“What do you do, during the day?” Harry asked. “Normally.” Draco looked up from his parchment, his quill pausing in its hypnotic scribing.
the chime, so whoever was bothering him at this unthinkable hour could not be nearly important enough. He threw a pillow over his head, trying to drown out the unrelenting noise.
who they’re looking for, do you understand?” Malfoy groaned in frustration, dropping his head in his hands, his stained fingers digging into his hair. “I’ll have to get a
He heard the rattle of the key in the lock—Draco would notice it was already unlocked. Harry felt his palms sweat, despite the chill.
He walked down to the shore, staring at the sea. He breathed in one last lungful of salty air, letting it fill him up, and apparated straight to the Ministry.
Draco was frozen, powerless, completely silent. He fought desperately against the restraints in his head, but it was no use, and Harry was slowly, hesitantly coming closer. Draco was begging him internally to look, to use
for instance—” she continued her grumbling as she searched the tags, and Harry couldn’t help but smirk. He wholeheartedly agreed.
Harry curled his hands around Draco’s, following his instincts and bringing them to his mouth to blow warm air over them. They were probably numb, by now.
Lucius growled, pointing his wand at Boran, who flinched, curling into himself. Draco was suddenly reminded of Harry’s Uncle Vernon, and he’d never wanted to kill his father more than in that moment. “You will keep your mouth
Draco was panting and shaking with adrenaline—Occlumency couldn’t protect from his own physical reactions. He felt something warm and strong in his left hand, gripping him and trembling, and knew he’d probably unconsciously reached for Harry’s hand again. But he had a feeling Harry needed it, too, an anchor to the real world. Draco couldn’t stop now—he could feel more than see the next breadcrumb, so close, nearly there. It couldn’t get much worse than this, right?
Harry flipped the page in the notebook to a blank one. He’d used up several by now. He couldn’t think of anything else he wanted to ask—at least, not like this. Not even on paper.
but they were too busy staring at Draco in shock to register it. He guessed it must have been as much of an emotional whirlwind of a day for them as it had been for him—although in very different ways.
Draco inhales deeply, quickly, like a chore he’d forgotten to take care of, before forcing himself to continue.
Harry stared out over the sea, mesmerized by its constant, rhythmic movements. It could have lulled him right back to sleep, but the biting winds forbade it, and the rising sun made everything about the water and Malfoy’s cottage shimmer and glow. There was too much to see.
And then the wards wobbled, signaling Harry’s arrival. Draco sighed, and pulled his hands away, resolving to listen to the tape right after their session today.
It opened easily with an ominous creaking noise. Harry flicked his wand to light the lamps, and stepped inside.
Harry watched his shadow pass back and forth in the strip of light under Draco’s bedroom door. Occasionally, it would stop, and if Harry listened hard, he could hear the soft scritching of a quill on parchment.
“Next time, we’ll go for one crumb at a time. I shouldn’t hold back that much with Occlumency—I have to feel it all at once, when I let it out.” Draco sighed. “I’m sorry, I thought I could handle it.”
“That was lovely,” he murmured, the corner of his lips turning up in a smile. “But I think there might be more to that, than just happiness for your friends, yeah?”
A door opened halfway down the corridor, the sound a muffled echo around the silent hall, cushioned by lush green carpeting. Harry strode towards it, a feeling of foreboding in his gut.
that you are alive today—and I’m so glad you are, even if it was all out of sheer dumb luck and Gryffindor stubbornness. And the fact that you are here, and that you still feel joy and love so freely, and that you’re still always trying to do the right thing, after everything—the fact that you’re here with me now, placing your trust in me, after everything my father and I have put you through…”
Draco walked with Harry across the lawn, towards the shed, talking at him about the magnolia tree and the garden and Timsy’s horticultural quirks. Harry just listened intently, nodding sometimes, tilting his head to the side when he questioned something, pointing out things he wanted Draco to talk about. Surprisingly, it felt like a conversation, even though Harry wasn’t able to fully contribute. Draco found himself wishing he was able to. He wanted to know what Harry liked about the place, what his own home looked like, when the last time he went flying was, what he had for breakfast. Draco was content with their dynamic, for now, but couldn’t wait for them to finally free Harry’s voice, so he could actually speak to Draco, like Draco was speaking to him now.
Pansy muttered, and Draco rolled his eyes at her. “And if it’s true you’ve been doing what you’ve always done, drowning yourself in your work and being antisocial, and it is also true that you’ve only had one patient for the past several weeks, I can only infer that something quite ‘unethical’ has occurred,” she said, putting air quotation marks around the word. Draco felt his cheeks heat traitorously, and he saw Pansy’s eyes widen.
