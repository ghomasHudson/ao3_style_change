Harry did know, but he didn’t want to think about it. “You don’t have to...”
“And Weasley and Granger, how are they?”
“Fuck, that feels nice,” Draco breathed.
“That’s not true. You saw him at Pansy and Lavender’s wedding a couple years ago,” Hermione chimed in.
“About those scars you said we’d discuss.” Harry leaned his head against Draco’s shoulder as they sat near the Great Lake.
“Both?” Harry wasn’t sure what he was asking.
“You should learn now that I’m always right,” Draco replied.
Fleur’s pregnancy mood swings were legendary. Harry laughed. “He hasn’t learned how to avoid the fights yet? Curtains seem like a stupid reason to get into a brawl.”
“All right?”
“What?”
Draco inched closer to Harry on the sofa and reached for his hand. “I have a theory, though.”
“Apparate. And no, I want you to see Diagon Alley the same way I did the first time. Plus, Apparating can make your tummy hurt the first time. I wouldn’t want you to miss out on the ice cream.”
“I didn’t know what the spell did.”
“Draco.”
“Potter.”
“What do you mean why? Doesn’t everyone hate seeing their friends upset?”
“Cool.” Draco looked at Harry. “Well, this has been fun. And enlightening. But I’d really like to continue snogging you.”
“Thanks. Say, is the chicken korma any good?”
Harry took a few more drops of Dreamless Sleep that night, knowing that he couldn't continue for long. But Draco had asked him to stay again, and he wanted to, more than anything. Draco read while Harry watched him. Draco’s lips would turn up a little at the corners when he read something amusing. His brow would furrow in serious parts. And occasionally he’d say, “Listen to this,” and tell Harry some new fact with excitement. He was such a swot, and Harry wondered if he had been this way in school. If only he and Hermione had gotten on...Hermione!
“Why am I glad you are alive? Or why did I try to find you?”
Draco rolled off of Harry onto the grass. They held hands and panted until their heart rates slowed.
The curry was delicious.
Charlie was the first person that came to mind. But he already knew he could get off to Charlie. He suspended the magazine above his head with a wordless Wingardium and flipped through the pages. He imagined the shirtless Quidditch players completely naked, fisting their cocks like he had seen Neville do that time.
Draco blushed and hoped his mother hadn’t heard. But she was talking to Andromeda and Remus. And somehow she had ended up holding Teddy, who had turned his hair blond with a black streak like Narcissa’s.
It was just for curry, of course. Not for Draco. Although he had taken inventory of his potions cabinet to see if he needed to buy anything else before he shook himself with stupidity.
Inside the restaurant, Daisy took to coloring her children’s menu. Dudley did most of the talking, thankfully. It turned out that Dudley had gotten married eight years before to a girl he met at work. They had a seven-year-old son named Brian, and Daisy, who was five. Daisy had first started showing signs of magic at age two, when she could change the telly channel by crying. But today was the first time her magic had manifested outside of home.
“Are you ready now?”
Harry came at the same moment, spilling into Draco while Draco’s own orgasm covered their hands and chests. Draco tremored with aftershocks for several seconds.
“Oh.”
“Such tact.”
“Hello, Weasley.”
Draco looked up, a cool expression on his face. “Potter.”
“Hey, Draco? I think I left a bottle of mulled wine in the common room. Would you mind checking?”
Harry looked down at his attire. His jumper was fairly new, and his khakis didn’t have a stain on it. And his Converse were clean, too. “What’s wrong with what I’m wearing? This is what I wear to the Ministry every day.”
Harry shook his head. “No. I stay pretty busy with work and such.”
“How do you feel about forgetting?”
“Right. Your interest in
The next day, Harry checked in at his desk—nothing again—before heading to the Minister of Magic’s office. He sweettalked Kingsley’s secretary into slipping him on the agenda, but it didn’t take much. The cheery brunette liked him and was a bit starstruck, even after several years in this role.
“Neville, sorry to interrupt, mate. But is that Draco Malfoy sitting with McGonagall?”
The man whirled around, and his stone-grey eyes pierced Harry.
She opened the door to the compartment and cast a pointed glance at Ron, who followed her. Harry rolled his eyes. He began to look for his own robes when the compartment door opened again. He looked up to see Ginny and Neville standing in the doorway.
Dudley let Harry go, and Patrice stood. “We’re done here, Mr. Dursley. Daisy, it was lovely to meet you. Remember to try your best to control your magic. Mr. Potter, I’ll see you soon, I’m sure.”
The trio turned to see Dudley standing in the doorway. Meredith smacked her husband on the back of the head.
“I love you, Harry James Potter.”
“I’m taking you out to celebrate tonight, obviously. Honestly, Harry. Did you think you would quit your job and we’d just eat the same old takeout and watch the telly?” Harry rolled eyes.“Anyway, I’m taking you out. I have a wonderful celebration planned.”
They walked in amiable silence for the first block before Harry asked how Draco’s day had been. “At Eeylop’s right?”
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Draco asked as they Apparated into the garden of the Granger-Weasley household. Harry shook a vicious garden gnome off his foot with string of obscenities.
Harry’s chest was tight and his heart pounded in his chest when he woke. He tried to steady his breathing and stay wrapped up under the blankets in Draco’s bed. Draco’s head rested on his chest, and he really didn’t want to disturb him. But anxiety was creeping up, and he had to get away.
Draco bought the trio a variety of Wizarding concessions to try, and Daisy thought chocolate frogs were the best thing ever. She looked at every card, and Harry decided he would give her his old card collection. When she opened her fourth card, she tugged on Harry’s jumper. “Uncle Harry? This is Rose’s dad.”
“How’s my favorite nephew?”
Harry swirled his tongue and loosened him until Draco was screaming incoherent strings of words. He wordlessly summoned the lube from his bedroom and slicked up his cock before getting on his knees and lining himself up with Draco’s beautiful arsehole.
“Can I room with you Hufflepuffs?” Blaise asked Justin and Ernie.
“Yeah.” Harry shrugged. “Well, I didn’t. But the team set up a sting and caught them in the act over by Weasley’s.”
A second finger entered, and Harry pushed back against Draco’s hand. He heard Draco chuckle, but he was quickly losing himself to the sensation. This time, Draco found the small spot of pleasure, and Harry’s cries bordered on screams. Draco slipped in a third finger, flexing them to fully stretch Harry, who was panting. “Fuck me, Draco. Fuck me now.”
The anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts fell on a bright, warm Sunday. It felt wrong. No one spoke much in the dormitory that morning. Everyone's memories were suffocating. Draco had only left the bed to throw up. But now he was back in bed holding Harry, who had no intention of going down to breakfast.
“I really do have to go.”
Draco wore a stunning grey suit that matched the shade of his piercing eyes exactly. He opted for a black shirt and purple tie. The suit fit him like a glove, accentuating all of his best features. Harry tried not to gape. Draco was one of the hottest men Harry had ever had the pleasure of encountering. When he was satisfied with the fit of Harry’s magically-tailored suit, he held out his arm to Harry.
Draco sunk back to his knees. Harry sat up and rested his weight on the palms of his hands. Draco gazed into Harry’s emerald eyes. “Take off your glasses,” he said. Harry did.
The graduation ceremony was short and sentimental. Hermione and a 7th year Ravenclaw gave speeches. Stoic McGonagall choked up during her address. Draco beamed as he crossed the stage. Everyone cheered when it was Harry’s turn, and Draco cheered loudest of all.  After the ceremony, Draco looked around for Steve and Andromeda. He found them standing near the Weasleys. Andromeda had a green-haired Teddy on her hip. And in between them was his mother.
Ron gave Harry an odd look. “You called him Draco.”
“Bloody Gryffindor,” Draco teased.
Artemis nodded. “Yes, but none of Neville’s other friends reacted the same. What was really going through your mind?”
“Harry, sit down,” Hermione said gently.
Their days were filled with establishing the charity, printing out posters and pamphlets about the signs of child abuse, and conducting interviews with witches and wizards who wanted to be social workers. The evenings that did not have family obligations were filled with fundraising. And every night, Harry and Draco went to bed, exhausted and fulfilled, and usually quite satisfied with each other’s bodies. Sometimes they stayed at Grimmauld Place; other times they stayed at Draco’s flat.
Harry wrapped a towel around himself and opened the shower curtain. Draco was sitting on the floor directly in front of him. “Don’t tell anyone, please. I need time to…figure this out.”
Harry shrugged, “I’m an Auror. It’s sort of like the police.”
“Great. Yeah. I’ll have it to you tomorrow.”
“Hi,” Draco said quietly.
“Uhhh,” Harry replied, dumbstruck. “Yeah.”
Harry blinked. He had not expected this to be so easy, but it was Kingsley Shacklebolt. He wasn’t the type of man to force anything on anyone. It’s why he was such a successful Minister. “Thank you, sir. Um, the Prophet article goes up next week. I’d like to wait until then to announce it. And I can finish out my duties here for...”
He turned toward home and decided he would walk. He was too angry to Apparate without splinching himself, and he’d be damned if he would go back inside to use the Floo. Fuck Malfoy. Years of images flooded his mind, and he could barely breathe. Malfoy taunting him. Malfoy smashing his nose. Malfoy trying to kill Dumbledore.
“You smoke?” Justin replied.
Draco didn’t move. Harry pulled him into a sitting position and folded his arms around him. “Send for Healer Artemis, please,” Draco heard him say. Artemis couldn’t do anything. None of them stood a chance against Bellatrix. He sobbed into Harry’s shoulder.
Harry answered by tugging harder on Draco’s hair, making his neck easier to access. He sucked on Draco’s neck as he slipped a hand inside of the wizard’s waistband. Draco’s arse was smooth and firm, and he couldn’t wait to be inside of it. Draco tugged on Harry’s jumper and pulled it over his head, flinging on the ground. He pulled his neck from Harry’s mouth then peppered kisses and nibbles all over his chest. He flicked his tongue over one of Harry’s nipples then took the other in his mouth and teased it with his teeth. Harry bucked against Draco, wanting more.
Harry bolted upright in bed. He was drenched in sweat and tears. He panted hard. Draco placed a hand on his back, and Harry jumped. “Sorry sorry sorry,” Draco murmured. “I’m sorry. Harry, are you all right?”
Draco smirked. “Is that all?”
Loving Draco was an experiment in unlearning everything Harry thought he knew and rebuilding his world brick by brick. The boy who had spent his Hogwarts years sneering and belittling everyone he viewed as lesser had turned into a man who couldn’t do enough for the people he cared about. Harry suspected that if he were lucky enough to be with Draco the rest of his life, Draco would still surprise him.
“You zoned out again, Harry. Are you sure you’re all right?” Hermione’s voice was concerned.
Draco gulped and nodded. “Ready.”
“That’s great news.”
“Listen, I should apologize.”
“Yeah, he has,” Harry said. Then he blushed. “I mean, he really toned up from what he used to look like.”
“Oh?”
It was just after one o’clock in the afternoon when they entered Eeylops Owl Emporium. The owner, Dave, confirmed what the other shop owners had said: a group of edgy teens had been loitering outside every evening for the last week.
“Yeah,” Draco said. “Yeah, I think I am.”
Harry wrapped a wet hand around Draco’s cock. Draco had a great cock, if he was being honest. It wasn’t as thick as Harry’s, but it was well above-average in length. It was good for fucking.
Draco laughed. “That’s charming.”
He hadn’t seen his mother in over six months.
“Well, I had a lot of help, especially from Rose’s mum and dad. But yes.”
“I’m your new head of house and Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor again. Minerva decided to tell the Board to screw themselves and that a werewolf was far less dangerous than a staff of Death Eaters.”
His stomach growled again. He could eat another sandwich or order in.
The Friday night before the Quidditch game, Harry sat in his living room and stared at a blank piece of parchment. He was seeing Draco tomorrow. He had to write this. His thoughts drifted to Draco for a bit, and his daydream became so real that he could swear he could hear Draco calling his name.
Draco looked skeptical. “This isn’t out of pity?”
Harry shook his head. “No. I want to look at you, you gorgeous man.” He slathered his cock in lube and positioned himself at Draco’s entrance. Draco’s cock began to grow again, ready for more.
“Of course, sweetie. Finish your ice cream.”
“So, you still work at Curry Cauldron?”
Draco chuckled. He stroked, moving his wrist several ways to see what Harry responded to best. He kissed him, on his lips, his neck, his chest. He bit his nipples and used his free hand to tug on Harry’s hair. Harry babbled a string of obscenities.
“Blaise?” Draco’s voice sounded small. Harry turned around.
Draco smiled and stood up from the couch. “Come on. I’m exhausted.” He walked down the hallway toward his bedroom, and Harry followed, limping a bit. His arse was sore, but he didn’t regret it for a bit. Totally worth it.
“Gladly.” Harry turned Draco around and pushed him down on the bed. “Get on your knees.” Draco obeyed, exposing his tight entrance to Harry. Harry climbed on the bed behind him. He peppered licks and kisses down Draco’s back. He placed a gentle bite on Draco’s arse cheek.
“Let me know if you find out what it’s all about, would you?”
“A very, very bad man.”
“Fuck, you’re hot,” Harry murmured in Draco’s ear. He nibbled the man’s earlobe then yanked his hair to expose his slender neck. Draco let out an animalistic groan as Harry bit his neck.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter. I’ll look for your notes in the case file tomorrow.”
A wet tongue swirled up Harry’s balls before finally licking up his hard shaft. Draco stared deep into Harry’s eyes as he swallowed him down, daring him. Harry knew what he wanted, but he could play a tease, too. Draco moaned as he took Harry deeper and faster. When the blond eventually let out a sound that resembled a whine, Harry laughed. “You’re such a cock-whore.”
He started slow at first, not wanting to overwhelm Harry. But it was Harry Potter, and he was good at everything. He took Draco’s cock like a champ, and soon Draco was snapping his hips faster and faster, hitting the back of Harry’s throat. They both moaned, louder and louder. Draco was close, and he wasn’t ready yet.
Draco beamed. “I couldn’t have done it without you!”
“Bill and Fleur had a fight over curtains,” Ron said. “He showed up at half midnight last night.”
“To us.”
“And touch it.”
“About?” Hermione prodded.
She shook her head, and her face grew serious. “No. I’m going with you. I placed a request to visit your mother. I heard back yesterday—the warden and Narcissa both agreed to it. I have the thirty-minute block after you.”
Draco’s eyes widened. “Uh. Sure. Just let me pop back and give the money to Devi.”
He felt bad for him. He can’t imagine how it must feel to discover something like that so late in life. And to grow up thinking it’s taboo. Poor bloke. He thought about how lost Harry looked when he came out of the shower. And how hot. Merlin, that boy was built well. All muscles and short and stocky. That messy, dark hair.
Draco visibly shook himself and stood, brandishing his wand. “Yes, well, I’ll fix that in a moment.” With a few quick waves of Draco’s wand, Harry felt the clothes loosen, and the pant legs shrink. It took him a bit longer on the wrists of the suit jacket. He appraised Harry with a proud eye. “Much better. Now about the tie. Can you tie a double Windsor?”
“With Andromeda. We’re co-parenting. I’m glad I like my mother-in-law. And I can’t think of a better place to raise a child than Hogwarts.” He cleared his throat. “Well, have a seat here.”
Just when he thought he was out of tears, more came. But these were different tears. Draco pushed Harry down on the couch and snogged him senseless.
Draco stared down at his hands. “No, Daisy. I made very bad choices when I was a kid. But thanks to your Uncle Harry, I got a second chance. So now I try to make good choices.”
“I love you, too.”
On Friday, Harry spotted Malfoy leaving the office of a member of the Wizengamot. He wore Muggle clothes again, a perfectly tailored grey suit that matched his eyes. And Malfoy had the biggest grin on his face. Harry couldn’t stop staring until Malfoy had ascended into the elevator. Harry opted for the gay bars that evening and went home with a handsome blond.
“I’m free. Really, truly free.”
“You are.”
“What?”
Harry looked at them and smiled. He waived his wand, and a moment later, a silvery cloak flowed through the air into his hand. “Here, Luna. Use my cloak, and go into Hogsmeade with Neville.”
Harry smiled. “You need to teach me that lube spell.”
“Look, it’s your only option, and—”
“Merlin. Are they still going at it?” Ron asked.
Hermione put her book down and sat up. “The Halloween Ball that starts in three hours? The Halloween Ball that every other girl in this dorm is currently getting ready for?”
“Don’t you think you should wait to see if the law passes before you resign? I think it will, but throwing aside your career on a probably seems rash.”
At precisely three o’clock, the Chief Warlock, Dawlish, called the Wizengamot to order. Kingsley Shacklebolt greeted the visitors and listed out the agenda. The vote on the Child Services law would be last.
Harry thought for a bit. He had been fine for years until Draco and Dudley appeared in his life a few months ago. Maybe Draco was right. “All right. Fine.” He stumbled through piecing together the dream and relayed it to Draco. It sounded stupid out loud but Draco didn’t react. He just nodded, listening.
“Try spending the whole summer with her.” Ginny and Harry had ended their relationship amicably at the beginning of the summer. Too much had happened. Too much had changed. Sometimes Ginny was in a great mood, laughing like everything was fine. But then someone would say something, and she would flip. Molly thought it was because she wasn’t eating enough, and they’d start screaming at each other over Ginny not touching her meal. Then Molly would start crying, and Ginny would storm out, and George would start screaming, and...
“Thanks.” Harry grabbed one off the shelf. “Sleekeazy?”
“Hey, that’s on you. No one forced you pick a Potions Mastery, you bloody swot.”
“Touch, ahh, touch me,” Harry pleaded.
“Uh-huh. You’re good at that dirty talk thing.”
“Can’t you just accio it in here?”
“This is my cousin, Harry Potter. He’s...he’s like you, sweetheart. Harry, this is my daughter, Daisy.”
Draco placed the books back on the shelves, put his bag over his shoulder, and made his way out of the library. The halls were abandoned; everyone was getting ready for the Halloween Ball. McGonagall had decided that the year was going so well, they all deserved some fun. He wondered again if he should ask Harry to go with him, but he didn’t want to ruin their friendship. Things were going well for Draco. He had several friends, and his classes were going well. Steve had written to tell him that he was trying to get permission to let Draco visit his mother over Christmas. Andromeda and he had met for tea in Lupin’s apartment a few times.
“Tell me what you want,” Harry growled. He bit Draco’s neck. “It’s your day. You get whatever you want.”
“Then hello, roomie.”
Draco placed a hand on his arm. “You’re making a difference now, with this.” He gestured at the paperwork. “I need help. I can’t run the charity alone, and I want to be hands-on with the children and the training when we start. I don’t want to pressure you into this. I want it to be your choice. But will you run the charity with me?”
When dessert disappeared, Professor McGonagall began her speech. “To our new students, welcome to Hogwarts. To our returning students, welcome home. I know that this place may hold dark memories for you from last school year. But we are working hard to return a sense of happiness and normalcy to these hallowed halls.”
Draco placed his head on Harry’s chest. Harry’s strong arm pulled him close. Harry dozed while Draco thought about his new life. He thought back to what Artemis had said months ago and finally understood. He felt guilty about his past decisions, but he had started to make them right. But the no longer wore the burden of shame. It was an emotion his father had put on him from an early age. Now, he chose to live in the light.
Cheers broke out from the visitors’ stand, and Draco and Harry leapt up with joy. Draco planted a huge kiss on Harry’s lips. If the wizarding world did not know about their relationship before, they certainly did now. Harry saw a camera flash in his periphery. Hermione hugged Harry and Draco in turn, and Ron embraced his best friend. Then he grinned at Draco and pulled the blond into a bear hug.
Draco nodded and bent down to talk to Daisy. “Daisy, did you know your Uncle Harry is very famous among the wizarding folk?”
before placing his arm around Draco’s chest.
“As hot as I find the prospect of thoroughly corrupting you, we should probably talk about boundaries and expectations and such.”
“That’s great, Neville! I’m happy for you.”
“She’s wonderful.”
“Um. Thanks. You, too.” Harry cleared his throat. He was glad Dudley was alive, glad Voldemort had never found the Dursleys, terrible though they had been to him. “Why?”
die a year ago.” Harry’s voice was equally expressionless.
They walked through the empty castle, looking for somewhere they could be alone. They found themselves outside, walking toward the Quidditch pitch.
Harry shook his head. “Fine, let me. It looks much more professional.”
He could get used to the begging. Harry was laying there on the ground, hungry for Draco. Desperate for him. He had his own hand gripping his own cock as he begged for Draco. Draco licked his lips and slipped off his pants.
The Aurors left, and Dennis looked at him. “What’s wrong with you?”
“Or you could just forget about it. It really isn’t any of your business, Harry. The war is over. We aren’t at Hogwarts. You don’t have to be obsessed with Malfoy’s every move now.”
“Oh, Draco. Look at me.” Draco gazed up at him with sad, silver eyes. “You are so brave. You changed your life. You confronted your past, while I just ran away from it. You are single-handedly changing our government to protect children. You came to me the other night and poured your heart out. Don’t ever think you aren’t brave.
Draco nodded and waved to Harry to follow. Harry through his own notes into his bag unceremoniously and crossed the room in two paces. Then they followed McGonagall to her office. No one spoke, and Draco gripped Harry’s hand until Harry thought it would break.
“Great. I’ll just, um--” Harry gestured toward the toilet and limped past Draco. He closed the door behind him and opened the tin. He let out a small moan as the salve healed him. Draco was right; he felt better almost instantly. He washed his hands and opened the medicine cabinet to place the salve inside. A familiar bottle caught his eye. Yes, just a few drops, and Draco wouldn’t have to know about his nightmares, at least, not yet.
“Try whatever you like. Here, take some lube.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“And now the Death Eater begs for mercy. How ironic.” He cast another hex, and Draco seized up in pain.
Harry nodded. They left the bathroom and made their way to the Defense classroom in silence.
“Oh.”
He led Harry down an aisle to the nausea potions and gestured at the selection of hangover potions. “Here.”
“Well, I can’t say I’m surprised,” she said.
Draco laughed a little. “That’s what Steve said, almost word for word.”
“Yes. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”  He kissed Draco under the shower’s steady stream, and Draco melted against him, his hard cock pressing against Harry’s stomach. Harry slid down to the slipper floor and wrapped his mouth around Draco’s delicious penis.
Harry blinked in surprise. He wasn’t imagining it. Draco’s face was floating in his fireplace. “Oh, hey.”
“That’s Latin for ‘I will overcome,” Hermione whispered to Harry and Ron.
Yes, the double entendre of the chapter title was intended.
Draco laid back down and snuggled against Harry. “Thank you for trusting me. Thank you for baring it all to me. It means more than you’ll ever know.”
“Thank you.”
Harry shook his head, laughing as he returned to his office. He got through another slow day then stopped to pick up Indian takeaway before returning to Draco’s flat.
“I was just thinking…about Malfoy. Whatever happened to him?”
“How was your afternoon with Andromeda?”
“You know, it’s rather narcissistic of you to think that you caused the whole war.”
Whenever Harry woke from a nightmare, he transferred his thoughts to Draco. Something about him had always obsessed Harry. But now instead of mindfulness to calm his brain, Harry thought of Draco’s appearance and his voice. More than once, Harry had a nice, long wank to the image of Draco. Then he would feel ashamed and dig out his porn magazines from his nightstand. “It’s just because we’re spending so much time together, and I haven’t gotten laid in weeks,” he told the dark bedroom one night. There was no answer.
Draco smirked. “Good for your already huge ego, is it?”
Harry nodded, unsure what else to do. He followed the two, and Daisy chatted happily about meeting the Magic People and about the scary clown and about her pink shoes and some television show she liked. Dudley responded to her comments with “oh wow” and “that’s great, honey.” The fact that Dudley was such a doting father might have been the strangest part of the whole day. Maybe.
Friday night, the eighth years were too tired to go out for drinks, which meant the common room was much louder than Draco had become used to. Ernie and Justin were rolling blunts at a table. Hufflepuff puff pass, Draco laughed to himself. That’s what they used to say about them the house of friendship, loyalty, and really good weed.
“Ye-yes.”
The meeting room was little more than a broom closet with two chairs and a door on each end. There was one orb of light floating around the ceiling, illuminating the dirty corners of the stone room. Draco sat in the metal chair, breathing in the 4-7-8 pattern Artemis had taught them.
Harry tried not to admire Draco’s arse even more as they walked, but he couldn’t help it. He’d deal with those conflicting feelings later. Instead, he cleared his throat.
Draco shook his head. “Later.”
“Well, if you get Os on your Potions and Herbology NEWTs, you will only need to do a one-year apprenticeship. I don’t think that will be a problem for you. If you get Es, it will be a two-year. You can start writing inquiry letters to Potions Masters. You’ll need to include your OWL grades, research you’ve done, and what you want your apprenticeship project to be.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice was heavy and rich like butter. Harry spun around to see Draco smirking at him from the couch. “Come sit down.”
“No, he’s right, Ron. I’m obviously not fine. I can’t bloody sleep, and most of the time I’m so overwhelmed by all these memories that I can barely function. I haven’t finished a whole book since before…” Her voice trailed off.
“Ron!” Hermione chastised her husband. “We talked about this. We’re all adults now, and Draco is dating Harry. We are going to use first. Names.” Her lips thinned as she reiterated this point to Ron.
“Good! I almost forgot. He doesn’t have plans on Christmas, so he and I are coming.” Harry grinned. “You’re sure I’m welcome?”
There was knock and the guard poked her head through the visitor’s door. “Five-minute warning.”
After that, the conversation flowed easier. They talked about Quidditch and a recent law passed by the Wizengamot. Harry asked how Narcissa was faring, and Draco inquired about Ron and Hermione. Draco had become interested in much of Muggle culture, and they shared similar tastes in music and movies.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. He had no idea what to say. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry. “She has no idea?”
Draco wasn’t anywhere in the dormitory, so Harry fished out the Marauder’s Map from his trunk. He hadn’t needed it all this year. He scanned the map until he saw Draco’s name. He was in the library.
“Oh.” So he didn’t have plans.
“Floo me when you get back if you’re upset. Promise?”
Draco smirked. “What can I say? I’m talented.”
Harry had to agree. “Why do we need suits?”
Harry responded by casting the cleaning charm wandlessly and summoning lube from his nightstand. Draco rolled his eyes at the cheap liquid, but it would be fine for now. He slathered Harry’s cock with it then positioned himself to slide down on top of Harry.
McGonagall wrapped up her speech and dismissed everyone to their common rooms. Several people grumbled about the new requirements, including Ron who kept insisting he was fine. Remus led the eighth years to the third-floor wing that had once held a three-headed dog. It had been turned into a new dormitory, and the entrance was marked by the painting of Sir Cadogan.
Harry tried not to laugh. “No, mine is a stag—a boy deer. Everyone’s is a different animal, and you don’t know what it will be until you cast it the first time.”
“And sometimes, I get so scared to go out in public. I feel like I have to be ready for an attack at any moment.” Once he started talking, he just couldn’t stop. He told Draco about the darkest memories of the war. He told him about the guilt he felt for all the people who had died, and how he often felt like the whole war was all his fault. He told him about his inability to have relationships. It all came pouring out of Harry for the first time in years. The dark bedroom shifted to the pale grey that comes just before dawn. Harry had talked for over an hour, and Draco—he had just listened.
Harry took an overjoyed and exhausted Daisy home, Apparating directly into the Dursley’s back garden. He promised he would see her tomorrow then headed home to collapse. Kreacher had dinner waiting. He ate quickly before he fell asleep on the sofa, exhausted from a busy day and a sleepless night.
“Good. You should start collecting recommendation letters from all your professors. I’ll write you one this weekend. I’m proud of you, Draco.”
Hermione and Ron shared a glance that Harry couldn’t read. Ron spoke first. “I doubt he’s up to anything, mate. He’s not a Death Eater anymore.”
“See, the Muggles have government departments dedicated to stopping child abuse. In England, it’s under the Department of Education, but in America it’s under social services. Either way, it’s part of the government because there are laws against child abuse. They remove children from dangerous homes. They give parenting lessons. And yeah, it’s not always the best system. Bureaucracy is a bitch, you know. But there are also charities that work with children. But did you know the Ministry has no such laws? They’ve always taken the approach of turning a blind eye and not getting involved in family life. And well, that’s just wrong. There are innocent children being hurt by the people who are supposed to care for them. And no one is doing anything about it.”
“I’ll pass, thanks.”
That night at Draco’s flat, he and Harry bent their heads together over a draft of a statement about the child services law. It was important to get this right. The wizarding public could be vicious in their letters to the editor; this was the most crucial step yet. But Harry kept losing himself in Draco’s smell and the drawl of his voice.
Harry ran through his mental calendar. “I’ve got a pickup quidditch game with Ron and Seamus Tuesday. How about Wednesday?”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but he was saved by the appearance of Daisy with a stack of books. “Can we go see the goblins at the bank now?”
The nightmares did not go away completely; Harry doubted they ever would. But they became far less frequent the more Harry confronted them. Whenever he woke panting and sweating, Draco woke, too, and listened to Harry talk out his dream. Whenever Harry’s anxiety rose about leaving the house, Draco noticed. He wouldn’t say much, just listen and squeeze Harry’s hand. Soon, that anxiety was nearly gone.
She didn’t say much as they walked to Fortescue’s, only occasionally pointing at things and asking Harry to explain. Harry smiled and remembered how overwhelmed he had been when Hagrid brought him to Diagon Alley all those years ago. They stopped in front of the ice cream parlor, and Harry asked Daisy if she was all right. She nodded then shrieked as a ghostly Jack Russell Terrier appeared in front of them. Ron’sexasperated voice said, “Sorry, mate. We’re running late. Apparently picking out which shoes to wear requires tantrums and drama.”
“I’m sorry. I have to ask.” Draco glanced at him then down at his plate. “Is this a date? Or are we just hanging out?”
“Well, yes, partially. But I tried to find you even before she was born. I didn’t know if you were even alive. I’m glad you are, by the way.”
“Potter, wait!”
A few moments later, the other door opened. Draco stood. Narcissa Malfoy shuffled into the room, her hands and feet shackled. Draco’s breath caught as he took in the sight of his mother.
Harry and Ron made their way to the last door in the hallway, next to their fellow Gryffindors. Ron went in and called for Winky.
Remus studied the pair. “Very well. Have Pomfrey send a note to myself and Professor McGonagall. Feel better, Draco.”
“Who won the bet?”
Dennis Creevey, a recruit fresh from the Academy, banged his head on the desk. “No one told me fighting dark wizards involved mostly paperwork.”
She smiled at Draco and moved to the next person, which was Padma. On Harry’s turn, he sounded just as excited as Draco when he said, “Harry Potter, Gryffindor, treacle tart.”
“Just fine.” Harry paused, thinking of his nightmares, his social anxiety, of the way he felt peace after writing and crying last night. “Well, maybe it’s not the healthiest coping mechanism. But I get by.”
Harry exited the Floo into his living room with a bounce in his step. It wasn’t a date, of course. There would be an almost six-year-old girl with them. But still, he was going to a Quidditch game with Draco. For the first night in weeks, Harry’s sleep was unplagued by nightmares.
Harry walked through the park in Surrey and pondered how much his life had changed. He had spent so many years ignoring his past, running from it, afraid of it. And then it jumped up and surrounded him. But it wasn’t all that bad, he found. In fact, confronting his past had made him happier and more fulfilled than he had ever been.  He had family. Real, blood-related, loving family. Sure, he had Ron and Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys. They would always be family. But he and Dudley shared a past that no one else would ever understand. Not a great past, by any means, but they still had the same roots.
Draco sucked and licked while his right hand moved at the base of Harry’s erection. It was sensory overload, and Harry felt his knees weaken. Then, Draco added his left hand to the mix, fondling Harry’s swollen balls. Harry wound his hands in Draco’s hair to steady himself. As he did, Draco removed his right hand from Harry’s shaft and took him deeper into his mouth. Harry smirked, knowing exactly what Draco wanted. He used his hands to force Draco’s mouth back and forth over his cock, fucking his face faster and faster. Draco moaned, and the vibrations of it nearly sent Harry over the edge.
The MInister nodded. “Very well, Harry. Your ten years of service have been outstanding here, not to mention all you did before. You’ll always have a place here should you choose to return.”
Harry wandlessly summoned Ron’s toothbrush and toothpaste. His best friend re-entered the room a moment later. “I forgot my—”
, then.”
“We’re doing this, then?”
She smiled. “Right. Sorry. It’s just…you can be a bit oblivious.”
Draco helped himself to a piece of toast. He knew that if Steve were here, he would insist on Draco eating something. And a bit of food did usually help the nausea. He nibbled on the wheat bread and studied Granger. Who would have thought the bookish Mudbl—Muggleborn, he corrected himself—would be a nympho? And who would have thought the Weasel would be packing such a nice cock? Too bad his face wasn’t attractive. Draco had never really been attracted to redheads. Dark hair, that’s what he liked. Dark hair and shorter than him, although Blaise had a good two inches on him. But that ship had sailed.
“I don’t know. I had been trying to muster the courage for weeks. And we did need to address everything between us first. But I’m not brave...”
Draco laughed. “No, he’s much more important than that. A few years ago, we had a very bad wizard.”
He slipped his cock out of Harry’s mouth, and Harry groaned in dismay. But Draco lowered his balls, and Harry took them in his mouth, sucking and swirling his tongue around.
He showered quickly and cast a drying charm on his hair before styling it with the orange bottle of Fleamont’s. Then he stared helplessly at the clothes in his wardrobe. What vibe was he going for? Sexy and down to fuck? Handsome and romantic? Bugger. Clothes had never been difficult for Harry.
“Clearly.”
Things turned strange after lunch. Ginny, who had been shooting daggers at him all day, came up to him with tears in her eyes and threw her arms around him. Draco awkwardly hugged her back, his eyes wide as he looked at Harry. Harry smiled and gave him a thumbs-up. He must have told Ginny what Draco had said about her the other day.
Harry probably would have made the same decision if someone was threatening to kill Hermione or Ron. He challenged everyone in the Wizengamot that they, too, would likely have made the same decision, especially as a teenager. And then there was the whole fact that Draco hadn’t sold Harry out to Voldemort in the Manor. Plus, he really was just a kid. Hermione had helped him prepare facts about the brain not being fully developed until age 25 and all that.
When they parted, Harry wanted more. Draco’s lips were pink and wet, and Harry could imagine them around his cock. His erection strained against his zipper.
Daisy nodded. “Are they always puppies?”
Draco blinked. Only a quarter? He would make that back and more with the sale of Malfoy Manor. He had enough money to take care of his mother, too, should she be left destitute. A lump grew in his throat.
“Hurry up, you slag.” Harry’s voice was raspy, breathless. He looked down at Draco, and the sight of him on his knees was almost too much. Draco smirked up at him, his grey eyes twinkling.
“Me, too.”
Draco smiled, and then he pointed out Ginny scoring another goal. Harry felt a lump in his throat, and he had so many emotions that he couldn’t place. He wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around Draco and hold him. Instead, he mouthed a thank you and Draco nodded. They turned their attention back to the game.
“Are you sure you don’t want me to go with you?”
“Not bloody fair,” Neville muttered. Luna kissed him on the cheek.
“Nice flat,” Draco said.
“I hope mine is a pony!”
The first time he saw Draco Malfoy was in a Muggle coffee shop near the Ministry entrance on a Monday morning. Harry had been too entranced in his new mobile phone to notice that the blond man in front of him was his former nemesis. But when he approached the cashier, she informed him that his drink had already been paid for by the man. Harry looked around, confused, only to find Malfoy standing by the bar, grabbing his coffee from the barista. Malfoy nodded at him, expressionless, then left without a word. Harry tried to convince himself that he had imagined it, partly because he had definitely checked out the man’s arse as he left the coffeeshop.
“I take it that this is the rest of my gift that I was promised?”
“Can I put a finger inside you?”
He nuzzled his head deeper against Draco’s chest. Draco was stroking Harry’s hair, lost in his own thoughts. A whole year. His life had changed so much. In some ways, he couldn’t believe it had only been a year. At the same time, that night felt so far away.
Andromeda, Remus, and Teddy had made themselves at home. Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Longbottoms and Lovegoods, and a few other people Draco didn’t recognize were there. McGonagall and Aberforth Dumbledore stopped by in the afternoon.  And everyone seemed like they belonged. Well, maybe not Mr. and Mrs. Granger.
Harry squeezed his hand, reassuring him. There was no reason for Draco to have any further conditions of his probation. He would blow his NEWTs out of the water, and he would be gainfully employed. There was just one thing missing.
So Draco told her about therapy at Hogwarts, which she didn’t quite understand. He told her that he had become close with Andromeda. She seemed pleased, though she didn’t say much about it.
Harry crawled out of his cupboard to the sound of Uncle Vernon's booming voice demanding Harry make breakfast. But when he served the eggs and toast, it was not to his uncle. Voldemort sat at the kitchen table and berated Harry for overcooking the eggs. He drew his wand and Harry screamed. He cast Sectumsempra but the curse flew past Harry onto teenaged Dudley. Harry screamed and rushed to his cousin's side. “Where is Daisy?” Dream Dudley panted over and over as blood gushed from his wounds. They were no longer at Privet Drive; instead they were in that bathroom at Hogwarts. Harry looked around for help. Draco swooped in dressed in billowing black robes as if he were Snape.
“Listen, Potter. Harry. I want to apologize.”
Harry reached up and grabbed Draco’s weeping erection. He jerked him fast, eliciting groans that bordered on screams from Draco. He snapped his hips up, forcing Draco to take him deeper. Moments later, Draco threw his head back and yelled, “Harry! Fuck!”
“Ahneeahgefyfomagoga,” Draco said in greeting.
“We were kids. And let’s not forget how I nearly killed year in sixth year.”
Harry chimed in. “Yes, I lived with them so Voldemort could not find me or hurt me. Your grandma is the sister of my mum.”
“Tonight’s the night my parents died,” Harry said suddenly as they climbed the staircase to the third-floor corridor. Draco squeezed his hand. “I forgot all about it until just now.”
“Why don’t you ask him out?” Ron asked.
Artemis ran up to them at that moment. “Draco? Are you all right?”
“Did you not know? How did you not know?” Draco had known from his first wet dream that he liked boys.
Harry had no idea what to expect when he arrived at the Leaky Cauldron. He had spent a good thirty minutes showering and picking out an outfit, finally settling on a pair of dark, fitted jeans and a black button-down. What sort of drink was this? Malfoy had said he wanted to talk to Harry about something. Was this actually a date? Surely not. They hadn’t even spoken in years until today. Was it work related? He couldn’t imagine what Malfoy would need with an Auror, or why it would need to be Harry specifically.
“Am I?”
“Mine and Harry’s fluxweed project is coming along nicely, and so is my Potions capstone. I can include those.”
He’d teased the poor boy long enough. Draco pulled Harry’s pants down, letting his weeping cock free. Draco was impressed, and he’d seen a lot of penises. “You’re thick. Really thick.”
“I spent three hours in Artemis’ office. Mostly talking about, well, what we talked about last night. And then I found Ron and Hermione and told them.”
“Of course. And talk to Draco about it. He learned a lot about business from Lucius.”
Draco cleared his throat. “Nothing. It’s just Molly Weasley invited me and you over for Christmas. But I figured you had plans, so…”
When Harry entered Kingsley’s office, he noticed how little had changed in here since the end of the war. Somehow, Kingsley had barely aged; it must be that his bald head didn’t have any hair to turn grey. He had redecorated the office only once—after he was given the position officially. It felt comfortable, which was good, because Harry was nervous. He always left ceremony at the door with Kingsley, old war buddies and whatnot. But today, he did not collapse in the oversized blue armchair. He stood nervously.
“Harry, are you gay?”
“No more scheduling alone time so we don’t walk in on Ron and Hermione.”
“Harry? Can I come through?”
“Trust me. You don’t have to say anything.” He gestured to the young reporter. “Come with us.”
“Only when I leave my cell.”
“But the wine…”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I have dress robes.”
Remus and Narcissa have a *past* and you can read about their night together in the previous work in this series, "One Night Undone." I have plans for them!
“Huh?”
Malfoy stood as Harry approached the table and stuck out his hand to shake Harry’s. Harry accepted it, and he remembered a time many years ago when he had refused to take the same hand. But they were older now, both victims of a childhood neither should have had to endure.
Dream Draco sneered at Harry. “It's all your fault, Potter.”
When the last of the Muggles had been sent on their way, Harry went out to let Susan know that he was finished. She wasn’t around anymore, but he caught sight of her boss sitting on a bench, talking to a large Muggle man and a sniffling little girl. That must be the one the who had shrunk the clown.
If Harry Potter could forgive him, then he could learn to forgive himself.
“Your prostate. I thought you’d done this before.”
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes. “No, Draco. I’m not sure. That’s why I planned to send you in the other room so I could put a giant red bow on my bum. Yes, I’m sure. Now, get over here and unwrap me.”
Harry felt Ron let out a sigh. He had not wanted to leave his parents or George, but he hadn’t wanted to leave Hermione more. Hermione reached across the table and patted her boyfriend’s hand.
“Yes, Mother. He’s wonderful. He’s kind and smart and funny. And so much better than I deserve.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sounds wonderful.”
Draco stepped away. Harry had barely noticed Draco tying the tie to his satisfaction. For a brief moment, Harry wondered if Draco really cared about the double Windsor, or if he had used some Slytherin conniving to get close to Harry. He pushed the thought aside. “Great. Ready to go?”
“Ron, no, I--”
The Hufflepuffs lit up one of the blunts and passed it around the common room. Draco leaned over to Harry and said, “You know, you aren’t responsible for Dean and Seamus shagging in Neville’s room.”
Draco opened his mouth, and Harry took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. When Draco’s tongue slipped inside Harry’s mouth, Harry let out a small groan. He felt a warm breath of air against his nose as Draco tried not to chuckle.
Harry was stunned. He knew Lucius Malfoy was a vicious man. But he had always assumed that Malfoy had been a loved, spoiled child. Harry stared at his hands. “I never knew...”
Harry’s breath hitched as Draco stepped toward him. He smelled so good, and he was so close. Draco seemed to move slower and more carefully as he reached his hands toward the emerald tie. He unknotted it, and Harry was overwhelmed by desire. His cock became half-hard, and he was thankful Draco wasn’t looking down. Every inch of him wished Draco wouldn’t stop at unknotting the tie. He wanted Draco’s long, slender figures unbuttoning the shirt, reaching for his zipper. He was so close; Harry could easily tilt his head upward and kiss him.
The two walked around the neighborhood for a while after dinner, continuing their easy conversations. At one point, Harry slipped his hand in Draco’s, just to feel him out, and Draco laced his fingers through Harry’s. Heat flushed through Harry’s veins, and his heart pounded in his chest.
Draco’s stomach dropped. It couldn’t be a good thing that the headmistress wanted to see him. His eyes darted to Harry, who looked at him with concern. Harry squeezed Draco’s hand.
“Merry Christmas.”
Harry let out a laugh as he straightened and turned to face Draco. He pulled his naked lover into his arms and kissed him. He didn’t remember the last time felt so sated. Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s. “That was...”
“Well, I am Draco Malfoy, after all. Impressive is my middle name. But really, it’s just a modified aguamenti. I’ll teach you the incantation, but you just need to imagine a thicker substance. It’s safe for toys, too.”
Harry listened as Malfoy explained his plan. His law would make child abuse illegal and punishable as a crime. He had plans to set up a foster care system. He had thought up the ways to report abuse and had researched how to identify abuse. He met with McGonagall about her experiences with abused children, and she was on board to help. He was working on a charity to help fund it and produce literature about child abuse. He had already thought of a training program for what he called social workers. Harry was amazed, and he was moved by the passion with which Malfoy spoke.
“Ron snores, but it’s nothing a silencing spell won’t fix.”
“Have a good night!”
Steve pulled miniature versions of Draco’s trunk and bags from his pocket and waved his wand to bring them back to full size. Draco smiled. He liked Steve. They had spent a lot of time together this summer. When Draco was released from the holding cell at the Ministry and learned the Manor was still in the government’s custody, Steve had taken him in. The young Auror lived in a small flat in the Wizarding neighborhood of Birmingham. He was kind and didn’t judge Draco at all. He was the first person that Draco had ever started to open up to about life as the son of a Death Eater.
She smiled. “Tell me all about you!”
“Kissing you.”
He went off onto a discussion of his travels with Narcissa over the last decade, and Harry hung on his every word, enraptured. He wasn’t sure why he had never traveled abroad, and he mentioned this to Draco. “You really should. No one should live in a bubble. Trust me, I should know.”
“Despite my shit choices?”
Draco Malfoy’s jaw was set when Harry threw open the door.
Steve picked up Draco at seven in the morning. Harry gave him one long kiss at the gate. Draco had begged him not to come. He didn’t want Harry’s influence being the reason he got free. He wanted to have earned it himself.
He nodded back. “Weasley. Good game. Congratulations on the win.”
Parvati smiled. “Yes! She’s recovering well. She will likely be returning to Hogwarts in a month or so. She had hoped to make it back at the beginning of the year, but her Healers wouldn’t clear her yet.”
“It’s okay.”
Harry stood on shaky legs and turned off the shower but made no effort to leave the stall. “I think I like blokes. And girls. Both.”
“I don’t know. I just…I don’t think I realized that what I was feeling was…that. Honestly, I haven’t given much thought to it. I kind of recycle the same three, you know, fantasies.”
Draco worked his mouth lower down Harry’s body, stopping to leave bite marks all over his chest, claiming Harry as his. He grabbed the lube from his nightstand in one hand and went lower. He murmured a cleansing charm just before he put his mouth over Harry’s erection.
He couldn’t shut down his brain, no matter how much mindfulness he tried, even as he exited the Floo into the brightly lit pub. The Leaky Cauldron was packed, as it always was on a Friday after work. A few familiar faces waved at him as he scanned the crowd for Malfoy.
And the dam burst. Harry wasn’t strong enough to hold back his tears. He shoulders shook with his sobs, and he buried his head in his hands. He felt a strong arm wrap around his shoulders. Draco didn’t offer him any words of condolence, didn’t tell him it was okay. Because it wasn’t okay. Harry and Draco both had more darkness in their pasts than anyone should have. Harry appreciated Draco’s silence more than anything. On the rare occasions he did break down in front of Ron or Hermione, they tried to comfort him with platitudes. It never helped.
Draco grinned. “Emotional. But good. Mother always told such fun stories about her. If it weren’t for my father and their parents, I think Mother would have reached out to her.”
“Again?” Ginny shook her head.
Harry lost himself in Draco’s deep grey eyes. Soon, both of them were panting and moaning. They were so close, touching as much of their bodies together as possible. Harry had never had sex like this with Ginny. This was intimate and passionate and deep. Harry was completely filled by Draco—physically and emotionally—and he had never felt better.
“No. Why are you being so chatty with me?”
“Fuck no, Draco. I don’t pity you, just like you don’t pity me. This is me saying I love you, and I want to be with you every single day.”
“I’m sorry. I need to leave.” He disappeared into the green flames of the Floo, leaving Harry alone and aroused and very, very confused.
“Oh, Merlin, no! It was amazing. Truly.” He stopped, and Harry was more confused than ever. “I just meant that, I imagined me taking you out to a romantic dinner and inviting you back here. And, well. I didn’t want our first time to be after we had just cried for two hours. I’m not a bloody Hufflepuff. And I was worried that it was just the heat of the moment, that you only kissed me because we had just been so emotional and sharing and...If the Slytherins could see me now...Merlin.”
Harry paused with his fork halfway to his mouth. The question took him off-guard. No one ever asked him if he still enjoyed the Aurors. He was Harry Potter, after all. Everyone seemed to think he was destined to spend his life fighting dark wizards, having vanquished the worst of the lot at only seventeen. In fact, he hadn’t even asked himself this. But now, Draco’s question opened up a lot of feelings he had not realized he had.
He disappeared into the loo, and Harry could hear him rummaging through a cabinet. He stood awkwardly waiting, stark naked and feeling vulnerable. Draco returned a few moments later and held out a tin. “It’s a dittany salve, but there’s no burn. You’ll be right as rain within a couple minutes.”
Narcissa’s eyes welled with tears, and it nearly broke Draco. A lump grew in his throat. She patted his face again, then stroked his cheek softly. “I can start writing and receiving letters just after the new year.”
Draco nodded. “I understand. Sometimes...well, sometimes the memories come back and it’s hard to cope. I get it. We went through some shit.”
“My other jobs smell much better.”
“I’m not sure what you want me to tell you. You’re friends. Say, ‘Will you go the Halloween Ball with me?’ That’s it.”
The people in their therapy session all congratulated Hermione. She had slowly begun to catch up on her homework since her admission on Wednesday. The others just smiled, knowing that it must be something she had shared in therapy. They had their own moments like that.
Things are going to get emotionally heavy in this chapter.
It was too much. Draco still wasn’t sure he deserved Harry’s love, but he didn’t want to figure that out right now. He shoved the cards out of his way and crawled across the floor to Harry. He pushed Harry down to the floor by his shoulders and climbed on top him, snogging him senseless.
“You’re gay?”
Harry sighed and collected his thoughts. “First of all, I’m not getting involved with him. It’s strictly business. Second, he’s not the same person he was back then. And frankly, neither am I.”
Draco shrugged. “I am, but I feel as if I can’t make any plans until after my hearing in June.”
“Okay. Good. Because I want you, too. Right now.”
Harry cleared his throat unconsciously as he thought this. Draco looked up and met his eyes. He gave Harry a distinctly Malfoy smirk. Did he know Harry had been admiring him? “So, Malfoy. Why am I here?”
Harry waited for Draco to continue. They were still standing by the door, neither making a move to sit in the living room. The tension was palpable, and for the first time, Harry was actually afraid of what Draco would say.
He grinned. “I’m your only nephew.”
“What?”
Draco paused with a forkful of crème brulee halfway to his mouth. Harry’s eyes widened, and he felt a blush creep up his neck. Shit, he thought. I said I love you on our first real date. Smooth, Potter. Draco set his fork down and stared at a red-faced Harry. Maybe he could cover it up. “I mean, I love this crème brulee.”
Malfoy cocked his head. “Why are you being so chatty?”
They laughed, and Draco asked how life as an Auror was going. Harry began to lament about the long hours but stopped himself. Draco worked every day to make ends meet.
He licked his lips as he studied Harry’s thick cock. It was the thickest Draco had ever been with, and he couldn’t wait to be filled up with it. He handed the lube to Harry. “Stretch me out a bit first. Start with two.”
Harry’s stomach growled as he reached the Floos. He hadn’t cooked all week, instead subsisting on candy bars and dry sandwiches. He really needed to get some groceries this weekend. He yawned and stepped into the flames before stepping out in his living room.
“Hermione invited you to come over Saturday night.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Guess you’ll find out in a moment.”
“Piss off,” he said. But he smiled. “It’s hard, you know, to realize that when a madman has literally been after you since you were in nappies.”
“Gah!” Teddy agreed.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. “I don’t remember the last time I came twice that quickly.”
“Fuck it.” It was seven o’clock. “I’ll finish the rest Monday morning.”
“You saved me again, you git.” Draco bumped his hip against Harry’s. “Thanks. How’d you happen along my way?”
“What?”
“I’m coming through. Let me tell Molly goodbye. Be there in a moment.”
Nothing sounded better. Harry didn’t remember the last time he just lounged around the house. Weekends were full of obligations and errands and whatnot. It felt good to be free. He nodded. Draco pressed a quick kiss to his cheek then stood to open the television cabinet. He sat down on the couch with the remote. It was odd seeing Draco use Muggle technology and so comfortably at that. But then he flipped the telly on to some home decorating show, and Harry took a moment to appreciate how right it looked. How right it felt. He looked forward to more days like this in the future. Then, he decided to just be mindful and appreciate right now.
“I don’t believe that’s it. A part of it, sure. But I think you are really just trying to do the right thing for people who need it most. I want that. Oh, sure, fighting dark wizards is noble and all that. But don’t you think I’ve done enough of that? I spent the first eighteen years of my life fighting Voldemort, for god’s sake. Maybe I want control and absolution, too, come to think of it.”
Things changed after that Friday. Not just with Harry and Draco, who were almost friends. But with everyone in the therapy session. Even Blaise was saying good morning to Draco when they passed in the corridor.  Draco still hadn’t opened up in therapy, but he was feeling less alone. He wasn’t the only one struggling. Harry hadn’t said much either. But Hermione had surprised everyone the following Wednesday.
“Oh.”
Dudley pulled Harry back as they walked to the parking lot. “You don’t have to go get ice cream. You should go find that Draco bloke. We’ll see you next week, all right?”
Blaise looked torn. “Sorry, mate. I promised my mum that I wouldn’t associate with you. Social suicide, she called it. And she’s right. No hard feelings, yeah?”
“Potter, thanks for coming. I ordered us each pint, if that’s all right.” He gestured at the table, where two amber ales sat, enticingly cold and frothy. Harry sat and took a large sip.
“No. Yes. I mean.”
“Yeah.”
“I have good news, too,” Ron said. “Mum couldn’t stomach the thought of you and Harry alone here on Christmas. She’s invited you. And your Auror friend, Steve. Andromeda, Remus, and Teddy are coming, too.”
“These Aurors here are inquiring about those curse marks,” Dave said.
Finally, the Chief Warlock announced the Child Services Bill. It would establish a new department under the Investigation Department, hire social workers, and work in conjunction with the Wizarding Children Protection Society. It would criminalize child abuse and give the Ministry the power to investigate suspected adults and intervene in various capacities. It also included an education program for parents and educators. Dawlish opened the floor for final comments, but no one stood to speak. Harry heard Ron whipser to Hermione, “Is that a good sign or a bad sign?” Hermione shrugged. Harry felt Draco tense beside him.
Harry sat up and leaned on his elbow to look at Draco. He had not expected that, although it was true that they had not spent a single night apart in two months. Draco wrung his hands and blushed. “We can work out logistics later. And it can be here or your place, I don’t care.”
died. Did you learn nothing in the war? Life is too short for what-ifs. Put on your Gryffindor pants, and ask. him. out.”
“Absolutely incredible. We can work up to it. And Harry, you can tell me to stop at any time, okay?”
“What’s wrong?”
Harry popped up and scooted off of Draco. Draco unbuttoned his shirt and pulled it off his shoulders. Harry licked his lips as he took in Draco then froze. His eyes widened in panic. “I forgot. For just a moment. I’m—”
“Yeah?”
Harry stepped outside the gates of Hogwarts and Apparated away with a pop. Draco checked his watch. Steve should be arriving in ten minutes or so. He had hurried Harry down early so that he could have a few moments to collect himself.
“I didn’t set out to make Harry fall in love with me, if that’s what you’re implying. Sir. We ended up as roommates and partners on a Herbology project, purely by coincidence. We became friends.”
“What? Yeah, it will be fine.”  He gave Draco a reassuring kiss and took his hand, leading him to the door. Hermione flung the door open before they could knock; she must have been watching out the window.
Harry looked at his best friend’s face. The bags under her eyes that had been there for months seemed to be getting darker. “I’m okay, Hermione. It’s just weird to be going back.”
The last time he had spoken to, or even seen, Malfoy was at the Death Eater sentencing. Harry’s testimony during the trials had ensure the freedom of both Malfoy and his mother. Malfoy murmured a quick “thank you” before the sea of reporters and photographers had separated them. Narcissa had written him a letter of thanks, but then the two Malfoys disappeared from public life.
The boys headed down their hallway. Dean and Seamus asked Neville to room with them, and he agreed once he lectured them on using silencing charms. Harry chuckled, glad he wouldn’t have to listen to the two lovers anymore.
“Hey, how is that thing with Malfoy?”
Draco smiled a watery smile. “You smell like my mother.”
Draco grabbed his own cock hard and jerked himself as Harry fucked him. It was almost too much to bear, with Harry’s thick shaft hitting his prostate over and over. He cried out as he spilled out all over his and Harry’s chests.
“He’ll be fine. He’s at St. Mungo’s. They’ll Obliviate him on his way out.”
Harry checked his breath and ran a hand over his hair before rushing off to the library. Hermione’s pep talk had helped, but he was still nervous. He wished he had some Felix Felicis right about now.
She smiled and waved her hand. “The words and the gift are from her. I’m just the owl.”
Harry looked up. Neville was staring at him, concerned. Harry forced a smile. Neville reached into the pockets of his robes and pulled out a flask. “Need a kip?”
“Remus, Draco just vomited. I heard him myself. He’s worried about missing class, because, well, you know. So can I take him to the Hospital Wing?”
The next day, Draco was walking back to the dorms from the Great Hall after lunch. Only one person had spat at him today, so it was a good day. Most of the eighth years had gone into the village. He assumed Harry was with them because he had been gone by the time Draco made it back from tending to the fluxweed that morning.  He was almost to Sir Cadogan’s painting when he froze. Bellatrix LeStrange was walking straight toward him. “No.”
Draco smirked. “This ‘babe’ thing is new. I could get used to it.”
He blushed a little but answered. “So fucking good. I...stayed the night. It’s real, Hermione. We’re like dating or whatever.”
“Me, too.”
She gestured to the two chairs, and Draco sat opposite her. She leaned forward and took his hands in hers. Her nails were grimy, something he had never seen on his mother.
But Draco’s silence, Draco’s presence—it brought Harry more comfort than he had ever felt in his life. The two men cried together in silence for a long time, and Draco never stopped touching Harry. The clock struck ten, and Harry looked up, shocked that two hours had passed. He met Draco’s eyes, and they both stopped crying.
Draco was quiet most of the day. He kept scratching his arm where his Dark Mark was. It was easy to forget about at Hogwarts. But here he was, an ex-Death Eater celebrating Christmas with a bunch of war veterans. Veterans who had fought on the right side of the war.
Ginny looked around the compartment. “Where are Ron and Hermione?”
“I’d love to.”
Hermione thought. “Hm. You’re right. There was some sexual tension.”
“And uh, just for my report, what’s your role here?”
Draco’s eyes widened. “You’re welcome…mate?”
“Fine. Tell us about your relationship with Mr. Potter, then.” The bastard sneered down at Draco.
“I know.”
“Harry, my boy. Good to see you. Is everything all right?”
Eventually, they found themselves back in front of Harry’s building. For the first time that evening, the two men stood in awkward silence.
He sighed. He never liked to return to Surrey, although he had managed to avoid Little Whinging altogether. He decided he needed a stiff drink and a good lay after this week’s barrage of the past. He promised himself he would hit the Muggle bars tomorrow then headed to the Auror’s Apparition point.
He extricated himself from Draco’s vice-like cuddling and stumbled into the bathroom. He smelled like sex. He fumbled with the shower knobs and let the warm water run over his body. He leaned his head against the wall of the shower and replayed last night’s events in his head. Fuck, Draco had been one hell of a shag. He hadn’t been fucked like that in a long time, maybe ever. It was intense and emotional and hot.
Draco pulled back the shower curtain and flashed that devilish smirk at Harry. “What do you take me for, Potter? Some kind of slut?” He climbed in, and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s fit waist.
“I have an extra ticket to the Holyhead-Falmouth game next Saturday. I know you like the Falcons. And it’s not like it’s a...I mean, I’m bringing my niece, and...but if you can’t or don’t want to...”
“She was very specific with what she wanted you to have,” Andromeda told him.
Draco practically threw the eleven bronze coins at Harry before Apparating away on the spot. Harry shook his head and went inside.
“Your arse is my gift?” Harry nodded and continued staring at Draco until he understood. “Your…arse…is my gift. Are you sure?”
He fell to the ground and started shaking and crying. “Nononono.”
Harry stepped out of the Floo and gawked. Though Draco was a thin man, he was also extremely muscular. His pecs were well-defined, and his arms looked like they could easily pin a man to the bed. At least, that’s what Harry thought when he saw the half-naked wizard. His normally impeccably combed hair was wet and ruffled. Harry’s cock twitched at the sight. Draco was gorgeous. But he had a few deep, old scars down his abdomen that filled Harry with shame. He swallowed, conflicted.
Draco stroked Harry faster as Harry sped up his own movements. With a shout, Harry spilled over Draco’s hand and their chests. He clenched down as he came, causing Draco to throw his head back.
He shook his head. “It just… Ron had just lost his brother. Hermione was days past being tortured, and she had to go find her parents in Australia. They think the curse just killed the Horcrux.”
Malfoy held out his hand for the money. “I’m sure.”
“Fuck. I don’t know.” He crossed his arms and looked at the ceiling, chewing his lip. Draco had the oddest urge to hug him. “I didn’t know how to help him feel better.”
She introduced the new staff members and heads of houses. There was a new Transfiguration professor since McGonagall had become headmistress. Slughorn was now the head of Slytherin house. Professor Sinistra had taken over as head of Gryffindor. Remus was announced as the head of eighth years and Defense. And there was a new Muggle Studies professor. McGonagall held a minute of silence for Professor Burbage. Harry noticed that Draco turned slightly green.
“Do you get them often?”
Harry and Dennis asked the same questions they’d asked everyone else and got the same descriptions of the gang of teens.
“I was hoping so. I’ll pick up dinner. See you later.” He kissed Draco one more time for good measure and Apparated away to the Ministry entrance.
Harry blushed.
“Uh. Six-thirty? Should I pick you up or--?”
“I almost died a year ago,” Draco said in a flat voice. “How bizarre to think about.”
Three faces smiled at him. Hamish frowned and folded his arms over his chest.
“I’m not telling you about my dick, Malfoy!”
Harry closed the distance between them. He placed one hand on the side of Draco’s face, feeling the coarse stubble against his palm. Draco’s breath hitched. Harry pulled him closer and brushed his lips against Draco’s. They were soft against Harry’s perpetually chapped lips.
Malfoy was still gaping when Ron finally headed to the shower. “He’s not a morning person,” Harry explained. “And you better get used to seeing his bollocks swinging everywhere. I think he’d be a nudist if he could.”
“Narcissa. It’s good to see you.”
“Malfoy, is it now? I kind of like that.” Draco snapped the elastic band of Harry’s pants. Harry groaned. Draco knelt to the floor and pulled off Harry’s shoes and socks. He slowly pulled off his trousers next and cast them aside.
“Um. Yes. Cake, probably, the most.”
The professors were looking at him strangely, but Harry just smiled. He knew later, Draco’s emotions would be more complicated, but now he was relieved. Lucius was a monster, and Draco would never have to suffer his abuse again.
She thought for a few minutes and watched her brother’s game. “Uncle Harry? Do you think Draco has ever been to a footie game?”
“Harder, Harry. Fuck me harder.”
“Hullo, Harry. You haven’t seen Luna, have you?” Neville asked.
They stood, and Harry walked him to the door. “Can I take you on a proper date sometime? One where you don’t deliver the food?”
They slipped out of the crowd and made their way to the Ministry exit. Harry had become quite skilled at escaping reporters. He was sure they would pin them down at the pub later for a statement. But for now, he just wanted to be alone with Draco.
“That was…epic,” Harry said, breaking the silence. “I like hearing you scream.”
Harry raised a quizzical eyebrow at Draco, who blushed. “Good to see you, Draco.”
“Have a good night, Harry.”
“Yep. My dad, Sirius, Remus, and Peter Pettigrew. They called themselves the Marauders. Honestly, I figure Remus was most of the brains behind this. He was nearly a Ravenclaw, you know.”
Harry nodded.
By the time their food was served, Harry was in shock at how easy being out with Draco was. He wasn’t putting on a flirtatious show as was so common on first dates, and Draco didn’t appear to be either. It was comfortable and familiar, as if they’d been dating forever.
Harry let out an adorable mewl. “What are you waiting for then?”
“Harry. You have such a beautiful arse. Can I kiss you there?”
Harry shrugged. “Sometimes everything just feels like too much. I’ve been doing this mindfulness stuff for years. Hermione gave me a book on it after the war. It helps.”
“And my cellmate is a lovely woman named Kendra. We have become friends.”
