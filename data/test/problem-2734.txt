“Well, of course he's seen it. How can you miss it?” Pansy winked at Harry before wrapping her arms around Draco's bicep.
Skidding to a halt around the corner, Harry smiled at the secretary, accepted her greeting, and opened the door to Draco's office. Draco wasn't sitting there. Any other time, Harry would be ecstatic to see her, but not then. Harry was getting mightily pissed off with ending up with the wrong people turning up.
Harry didn't lower his wand. “Prove it? Okay, what was the last thing you said to me today?”
“So, that's it, basically,” Tony said and Harry's heart dropped. Why the fuck couldn't he concentrate for two minutes?
Dog was just dozing off when a tremendous bang had him falling off the sofa and growling at the door.
After a cup of tea—and whatever potion Molly had slipped in with it—Hermione calmed down enough to rationally think about the whole situation. It wasn't the fact that Harry had a boyfriend, not really. Hermione didn't
As the song finished, Harry stood up and walked up to the cake, ready to berate his supposed mates—and rescue the poor man trapped inside it—when Ginny grabbed his arm and put her fingers to his lips.
There was no passion between them. Harry loved his wife, but he couldn't remember the last time they'd gone to bed at the same time, let alone had sex.
Draco blushed and didn't move until Glinda had shut the door behind her.
Harry looked at the clock and noted that any proper employer would probably have sacked her by now. It was ten past nine, and Harry was bracing himself for the half nine, pre-shopping, post breakfast rush. And Pansy was late as usual. Harry decided that Pansy was probably nursing a hangover, or maybe entertaining one her boy toys, and thought he'd better contact someone to help him out.
“So, Hermione, what's he like?” Ginny said, leaning towards her sister-in-law. “You must have met him?”
After a chorus of goodbyes, Harry and Draco stumbled their way home.
“What?
“I'll show you,” Malfoy said, slowly getting to his feet and sliding around the table.
Hedwig's head slowly turned to Darius. “What?”
Zach shouted in protest and tried to dab at the growing stain with a napkin. Harry nearly missed the wink that Draco shot in his direction.
Pansy stuck her tongue out and discarded her magazine completely. She propped her elbows up on the counter and dropped her chin into her hands. “So...”
“Harry, you have been more vocal in our sessions, so I'd like Draco to talk today, if that's okay with the both of you.”
Which made my plan that much easier to put into action. From that lesson on, any time Potter tried to talk to me, he found himself fighting off little paper cranes. As the weeks went on, I got inventive and even managed to get little patterns on their wings. It was instinct after a while, Potter started talking and I'd have cranes flying at his head without a second thought. It was quite fun, to watch Potter batting the bits of paper away from his head.
“It's okay,” Draco said, using his own key to open the door to the house. “We've already eaten.”
Harry was slightly apprehensive; he hadn't actually socialised with any of the other guests—besides Draco—since he'd arrived. Pulling himself together, Harry stood up and joined the small group heading towards the tennis courts.
Not wanting to drag it in case he chickened out all together, Hermione had barely taken a sip of her wine before Harry blurted out, “I think I might be gay.”
Harry was just trying to decide on which shirt to wear to the pub when he heard the crash. His immediate thought was that Brewin had got into the crockery cupboard again, but a meow from the bed behind him had him reaching for his wand and running downstairs.
Harry was feeling pleasantly tipsy, and with every sip of wine, he felt bolder. As he looked into Draco's smiling eyes, Harry knew that he wanted to do nothing more than kiss the man right there in the middle of the pub. Harry reached out a hand and entwined his fingers with Draco's. Draco leant forward and Harry was seconds away from fulfilling his dream.
“Right!” Harry cried, holding his wand out in front of him. “This way!”
“Harry.” Hermione had her patient teacher's voice with her. “It's just one night. You don't even know what the thing is.”
“You've been staring at me since you got in. What's up?”
” Harry gestured to the papers in Hermione's hands. “—literally happened on my desk last week, can you imagine his reaction to my writing this crap? He likes the fact that I write the books the kids are studying from these days.”
We talked about how they tried to put you in prison with your father. You thanked me—quiet and stuttering—for speaking up for you. How could I not? You weren't like the rest of the Death Eaters. I knew that. I couldn't miss it. I was there when you refused to identify me in the Manor. Anyone else—they would've gleefully told the noseless bastard I was me, but you didn't. You wouldn't.
Neither Harry nor Draco had the first clue what they were doing, with both admitting to being virgins. With a fair amount of lubrication spells and some quick thinking, though, they soon figured it out. And when Draco finally fucked him right there on his living room rug, Harry couldn't imagine it getting any better.
: This is technically a prequel to No Easy Thing, but I highly recommend reading that before reading this. All the thanks and hugs to G for all her help.
“Silver clashes with his coat, Harry. You should know that.”
Dog tried to scuttle away from Harry, but he was much too slow. Before he had time to bark, Harry had the ribbon cut off and tied neatly around his neck in a quaint little bow. Dog was mortified. He was going to be the laughing stock of the bloody street.
“You're supposed to be watching Harry!” Darius was about ready to make good his earlier threat and throw him from a window with his wings tied behind his back.
The bloody cow stole my words! Anything I said after that would have seemed disingenuous. Besides, I didn't get the chance. Before you'd finished mumbling to Pansy that it was all right and that you'd see her at school, your friends were dragging you off, the loud bangs of the camera bulbs echoing in my ears.
“Not a chance,” Draco said, dragging Harry towards the stairs.
“Yes?” Harry said slowly, elongating the word.
Harry hated doing it; he didn't want to do it, but he felt he had no choice. Lifting his hand to his forehead, Harry pushed his fringe out of the way. “What about now?”
“Dog!” Harry moved forwards, as if to take the tree back when he stopped and looked thoughtful. “Hang on.”
Ginny groaned and put her face in her hands. Harry patted her on the head.
he looked, but he was pleased to note that it didn't bother him. His assumption had been correct; it
“Harry, please,” Zach said, walking towards him.
“That isn't all. This is very important. Essential, one might say. This has been requested of me by the only one who would.”
to do it. When he wasn’t busy, he would have to think it through. Hermione would probably say that it was an act against Voldemort or something. Harry, at that precise moment, simply thought it was fucking hot.
“Yes, since he was expelled, no one has really heard anything about him.”
Hermione was sure that if they could just spend some time together, if Harry could see that they were happy for him, everything would be okay. It could—would—be back to normal.
Harry blushed. He could be so stupid at times. He searched for something else to ask, but Malfoy laughed suddenly, interrupting his train of thought.
“Come on,” Harry said into his ear, “less eavesdropping and more prize-winning!”
Draco was mortified. No alcohol? What kind of fresh hell was this?
“Hello, Harry.”
Draco went to his trousers and took out a small phial. “Drink this,” he told Harry, handing it over. “That and a shower will make you feel better, and then we'll go down to breakfast. I think we need to talk.”
But now, as he stood beside the pool with the sun beating down on his uncovered body, he felt a pang of panic. He was going to burn. Badly.
In private though, it was perfect. Harry became quite close with my friends, as evidenced by his use of the pet name 'Panto' for Pansy. It was apparently an inside joke between the two of them, stemming from a Muggle thing with horses. I have no idea, but it made Pansy and Harry smile, so I left them to it.
Draco calmed himself and tried to articulate exactly what he wanted to say.
Harry looked up. He was shocked to see the flash of amusement and the small quirk of Draco's lips. Feeling very confused, Harry tried to make sense of the situation. Unhelpfully, all Harry's muddled brain could supply was
“Yeah, um, yes. They're very nice. What are you doing here? How did you get in here? I thought we were meeting at the pub? And leave me some biscuits, please.”
Harry kept his face covered as Draco waved his wand over his groin, the warmth of the healing spell surging through him. Acting on impulse, Harry cupped his balls and sighed in relief as he felt no lingering pain. Looking up, Harry was shocked to see a strange look on Draco's face. Harry leaned almost imperceptibly forward.
Pansy huffed and stormed out to the back of the shop. Harry handed Draco his cuppa, and put a pecan pie on a plate for him, leaning over the counter for a quick kiss while he did so.
“I meant
Harry was rather pleasantly surprised at Ron and Hermione's easy acceptance of his and Draco's relationship. Harry had finally blurted it out during a rare phone call to Ron. Harry thought that over the phone was the second best thing to telling them in person, and Harry couldn't stomach the thought—or the cost—of travelling all the way to Australia just to tell his friends that he had a boyfriend.
Ron was embarrassed. It was hard to admit that, but it was only to himself, after all. He couldn't believe he'd said those horrible things to the best friend he'd ever had. If only he could tell Harry why he'd said them.
know.
And then Harry's brain shut down as he felt Draco's tongue against his arse.
*  Potter would plead to be assigned to a new partner. This, Draco silently agreed with. But it would be a warm day in Scotland before he'd speak up in support of anything Potter had said.
I want someone who I can rely on and who can rely on me. Someone who will love me and will let me love them. Someone who isn't too afraid of my name to tell me what's what and when I'm being a prick. (Which, according to Ginny, is at least twice a week.)
Ron wasn't wrong. Harry wasn't moping about. Far from it; he was out socialising quite often, meeting up for drinks after work and the like, but being the only singleton of the group, when his friends starting drifting home to their other halves, he'd just end up tagging along with Ron.
Oh, crap; that made perfect sense. All that anger Harry had thrown at him during training, and ever  since. What the fuck?
Darius smoothed his feathers out before continuing. “As I was saying, due to
He was out of luck. Malfoy was already sitting at the counter, measuring and making notes on a chart. He looked like he'd been there for hours.
It was on one of their evenings together—after a few too many glasses of wine—that their simple friendship turned into something else altogether. And, as was usually the case, it was Harry's runaway mouth that started it.
Draco thought he'd try a different tact. “Harry,” he said as he ran his thumbs over Harry's cheekbones and down to his stubbly chin, “why did you run out of therapy this morning?”
“But, I do need your help,” Harry said, sitting back down. “Can you explain to me how to use an airport?”
see you; I couldn't talk about you. It physically hurt when I thought about it. I don't know what made me believe it. It was just there, in my mind, replaying over and over.”
“Hi, everyone!” Hermione greeted as she and Ron joined their group. “I'm guessing Harry has seen the
“And you're telling me this now. Why?”
*  Potter would huff and promise to not hex his partner. Draco was certain Potter also crossed his fingers.
“Enough!” Hermione shouted, standing on the coffee table to be heard over the din. “I don't think this is going to be resolved like this. We all have our own views and I don't think we're going to change anyone's mind. Tonight, anyway. Can we please just have a drink and talk about something else?”
“We're so stupid.”
“Zach?” Pansy and Harry shouted as one as they spotted the picture that accompanied the article.
“Ah, good. I wasn't sure, and I didn't want to offend. Now, follow me, please. We need to begin.” Turning on the spot, she raised her voice. “Everyone, please. We'll have plenty of time for chit-chat later. Let's get this party started!”
“I don't know what you mean,” Zach said, taking a step back.
“That's okay; we can go when you get back.”
Harry looked about ready to hide in the wardrobe, so Draco quickly spoke up. “No, no, I just wondered
“Very funny,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “He's just a friend.”
“No, I'm not sick,” Harry said. “Of course not. See, healthy as anything. Just must've had too much to drink at the weekend. You know me and wine.”
Ginny had obviously anticipated Harry's reaction as she gripped his arm stronger. “Harry. Stay.”
After the updates were given on the current cases (Mrs Norris once bemoaning the fact that she was once again on Peeves duty instead of a 'proper case'), Bob once again called for quiet.
“I need to watch you,” Harry said, and Draco let loose a sigh. “I’ve waited too long for this.”
to go on holiday with you. Honestly. Nothing would give me more pleasure than to rub suntan lotion on your back by the side of some pool somewhere before scandalising the neighbours by having sex on the balcony. But I have to go away.”
“And I saw them after lunch.” Crookshanks couldn't look Hedwig in the eye as she spoke; she felt bad, but reports needed to be made. “They were having an... argument behind Greenhouse Three.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered out of the corner of his mouth.
“What the fuck is going on?” Draco asked, pulling Harry to a stop. “And, ow!” he added, swapping their hands to a more comfortable position.
No. If he didn't want the whole school (and thus the entire world) to find out his problems, he only had one choice. He'd have to turn to his room-mate, the one boy in the school who Harry could be sure wasn't
, they all laughed and said your name as if... Well, I don't know why. I just assumed it was because you were gay and that's why... Oh, I don't know. Can we—”
Harry groaned into the bed sheets. I patted his hand, hoping he'd keep quiet as I desperately wanted more information, because hello! I should have been dead, not listening to story time. Not that I was complaining.
The tree, the room, the dog: they all need decorating.
Harry couldn't help but laugh. The laugh died as they walked past the boulder that had caused the damage. Sure enough, there was the word he was expecting.
~ ~ ~
It was surprising what got you to actually talk to me.
A few rounds of pints, maybe too many shots, and some much needed chips later, talk turned from the general catch up to the teasing and bantering that only came from a group of friends that had been together for years.
“Harry, I was wrong.” Draco still held Harry's hand in his own, and he gripped tighter as he talked. “I'm so sorry.”
Draco nodded. “All of the above. Right. Let's do this.”
He just hoped that someone
Hedwig pushed him with her wing, laughing at his disgust when she disturbed his feathers.
Draco looked behind him, and noticed Harry still fast asleep, now cuddling a pillow instead of Draco.
“You were both in bed.
“I don't want to... play with them.” Harry sighed in relief. “I've never said that before. Is it weird? The way Ron and Dean go on about them, I should want to, right? What do you think?”
“Now is
“As you can see, tonight is going to be a little different. Tonight isn't just about you and your partner, it's for everyone to talk about their experience over the past couple of days. I want you to talk to your fellow guests and see what has helped and even rant about parts you didn't appreciate. Most of all, though, tonight is about fun.”
“Why tell us, then?” Harry said.
“Do you want me to heal that for you?” Draco asked, still smiling.
“Draco, do you hate Harry?”
“What?” Potter said aloud. “Hold hands? With Malfoy?”
“Oi,” Hedwig said, nudging him with her wing. “No bitching about owners. That's the rule.”
“You see what I have to put up with?” Harry asked Glinda. “And yes, yesterday you weren't being a twat and blaming everything on me. I was trying, all right?”
Harry nodded. “And why didn't you tell them it was a fucking
“Potter!”
Ah, Harry remembered why he kept Pansy around. Efficient was her middle name. Well, it was actually Elladora, but you didn't mention that if you liked your balls where they were supposed to be.
“But I'm sure the making up will make it worth it,” Harry added, putting his arm around Draco.
Dog happily batted at a player with his paw. He couldn't wait to see Draco's face when he saw it!
Harry's breath caught as he listened to Lily tell Ron about how her dress matched the flowers. Yes, his daughter was beautiful, but it was her words that hit him in the heart. She was happy for him. Looking at his best friend—and former brother-in-law—talking to his daughter about his wedding to someone else as if it was a normal—and happy—occurrence, Harry felt a rush of affection.
“To lose?”
They always need something. Teddy firecalls to ask for help with his lessons. I want to be there for him, but I can't deal with his teenage angst. I love him, but I can only imagine what a normal fourteen year old boy is worried about. When I was fourteen, I was fearful for my life. Witch Weekly is asking for an interview. They can fuck off. They want to post pointless pictures of me with every single person I've ever met under the guise of 'my next greatest love', they don't get to hear the truth. Which I don't think they'd appreciate, but whatever. McGonagall is still wanting me to talk to the students. The last thing I want to do is to give a pep talk to a group of teenagers that don't even want to be there.
~ ~ ~
“It's okay,” Harry said, grinning.
It teetered, but settled back into place. Phew. He didn't want to smash it, not really. He needed Harry to pay attention, so he barked. Harry whirled around and Dog pushed the penguin gently with his paw, whining as he did so.
I'd missed my chance in Diagon Alley, so I psyched  myself up to talk to you on the train. I spent hours in front of my mirror—to the utter delight of my prying mother—perfecting exactly what I was going to say.
Draco slid his hands up Harry's forearms as Harry did the same. “Harry, about today...”
, Harry knew it could indeed get better. Harry had never seen himself as being obsessed with sex, but, with Draco, he couldn't get enough. Harry wasn't at all surprised at how easy they had fallen into being boyfriends, and he didn't think anything could drag him down from his happy high.
Harry shook his head. “No.”
Harry and Draco still weren't talking when it was time for them to meet the other guests in the lobby. Draco hoped they'd sort something out soon; they were due to go back home tomorrow, and he
Ron and Hermione had sat there, dumbfounded, as Ginny ripped them a whole new one. She told them, in no uncertain terms, that she wasn't stupid, and she'd seen the way they'd been acting. She'd seen the eye rolls and polite grins, and, perhaps most tellingly, she's heard them outright bitching about Harry and his new boyfriend.
“Sure,” Harry said. He'd barely made it two steps before he realised what Malfoy had asked for. Turning quickly, he knocked a chair over, causing the three still sitting to look at him in alarm.
“Why not?” It wasn't the first time that Draco had attempted to be not-enemies with Potter, but it was the first time he'd pursued it. Usually, he'd have sneered and turned away by now.
“Is an arrogant arsehole,” Harry interrupted. “Captain America, was on the ground saving lives and fighting hand-to-hand with Black Widow.” He looked to Hermione, obviously trying to butter her up. The weasel.
Zach fell to the floor in a heap. Draco winced, cradling his right hand.
Apparently, my mother and I had saved Potter's life on several occasions and should have honour and not scorn. I couldn't fathom why—or when—my mother had saved him, and the only time I hadn't actively tried to hurt him was when I didn't identify him to crazy Aunt Bella at the Manor that day. (I wish I hadn't, by the way. The git thanked me by stealing my wand. No, I don't mean that, but still, the git stole my wand.)
“Yes,” he finally said. “That makes sense. I never realised before; I just thought he hated me. I just get so tired of being treated like shit.”
Thankfully, Harry arrived at work with only seconds to spare, and he barely managed a 'hello' before they were besieged by hapless assistants and more patients than he could count. It was ten o'clock before he had the chance to stop for a breather.
perfect holiday brochure,” he cried, hoping that his magic would make his decision for him.

*  Kingsley would say—shout—something, usually including the words: 'Supposed to be adults', 'Partners', 'Support structure', and—Draco's favourite—'If you didn't work so damn well together...'
“Thanks,” Draco said, not dropping Harry's hand as they went to the changing room to find their clothes.
belt. Harry gave into temptation and banged his head against the door again. Harry kept his head against the door as he thought about the object of his affections, and the man who wore it.
The group cheered. They had managed the impossible. It was time to celebrate.
“Are you telling me Hermione made you pack
welcome. The reply, in Draco's swirly script had made them incredibly happy. They would finally be able to show Harry how much they loved Australia. And they wouldn't even try to get him to join them. Well, not much, anyway.
I didn't even get a chance to think about talking to you before you left. Severus' body hadn't even been lowered fully into his grave before you shuffled off, the click of a dozen cameras heralding your exit.
“He knew that I was coming home.”
“Thor is a God! And he cares what happens to Earth. Deeply”
. Who the fuck thought that that was a good name? It sounded like an article in
“Here you go,” Harry said, throwing a small phial to Draco. “You'll have to find your own toothbrush.
After a pleasant afternoon lounging by the pool, and a lovely dinner, Harry and Draco decided to take a walk around the hotel grounds before going to bed. Neither one wanted a repeat of the night before; one night on a hard floor with no sleep was more than enough. Both men agreed that a leisurely stroll around the grounds would suffice.
“And this one,” Harry said, gesturing towards Draco with his glass, “thinks Iron Man is the best Avenger.”
Harry hated surprises. He always had done. Hermione told him once that it was probably due to him never having any nice surprises as a child, and then even nastier ones as a teenager. So, now, as an adult, Harry hated them with a passion.
“It was the Muggle thing that made me agree to it.”
“You're not a prude, are you, Potter?” Theo teased and Draco almost spat out his drink, quickly covering it with his napkin.
Draco nodded. “Why did you?”
“Yeah, right. Want to be my friend, Malfoy?” Potter held his hand out, but Draco knew better than to take it. Especially as Potter's voice had a rather sarcastic tone to it.
“And if you had, I wouldn't have bitched—”
Harry was, but he was sat opposite Harry, talking about their plans for the day while they ate breakfast after waking up together.
Neville and Ginny didn't even see each other for an hour a day; Neville was teaching at Hogwarts, and Ginny was constantly up and down the country with her Quidditch team. But every few months, Ginny would take some time off when the school was having a break, and they would go on holiday somewhere, just the two of them.
Harry ignored the meaning behind that statement and latched onto the chance to ignore his feelings for two minutes. “Do you remember what you named the plan?”
Malfoy didn't answer, he just knelt beside his wash bag, giving Harry an unimpeded view of his gorgeous arse.
Dog did, but he wanted to annoy Harry more so he stayed silent.
Harry blushed and threw a tea towel at her. “Seeing as you’re here, you can make yourself useful.”
“Who wants to hear Nev's worst?” Ginny said after the laughter had died down.
Harry gaped at Draco. “You remember that?”
Running as fast as he could back to his café, Harry at least tried to avoid bumping into people as he ran. Flinging open the door to the café and not even looking at Pansy, Harry started talking quickly as he ran around the back of the counter  and started rifling through the till.
Harry couldn't speak; he could only nod.
Draco stepped forward. “No. You don't get to talk to him. If you like talking so much, why don't you tell everyone about that night?”
Harry shrugged. “Right on track. It should be on your desk by the deadline.”
“Of course. Let me just put my bag away and grab a cuppa and I'll be right there. Do you want a cuppa?”
Malfoy did just that, pushing Harry back under the hot stream of water. Harry loved to cede control during sex. He had realised long ago that it was probably due to him having to be in charge on a day-to-day basis, but with Malfoy teasing his arse with maddeningly slow caresses, Harry didn't care
Darius had preened when he'd first heard that, but as Arnold started referring to them as the 'Awesome Foursome', he'd taken them both in his claws and threatened to throw them out of the window if they didn't shut the fuck up and listen. Draco would have been proud.
“Huh.” Draco said, raising his eyebrows and huffing.
“Of course,” Harry said. “Doesn't everyone?”
“This. Us. You.” Harry dropped his gaze, unable to say the hardest words he'd ever said to his face. “I don't want you to come here any more.”
“What did you ask for?”
His relationship with Draco wasn't perfect. They had arguments nearly every day, but it kept it interesting. Draco left a trail of destruction—clothes, towels, paperwork—wherever he went, but Harry didn't care. He had Kreacher to clean up after him. But they made sure to never go to bed angry with each other, and they loved to spend time together. Maybe it
The only thing left for Harry to do was to start living his life again.
Harry swished his wand, turning the volume on the wireless up as he cleaned around the café, righting tables and chairs and setting the brush to sweep the floor. He sang a song that had been played to death on the wireless; a song about having
Harry/Draco
“Sit down,
Malfoy's right eyebrow raised in question. Harry smiled and answered by pulling Malfoy back to him, their hard cocks sliding against each other. Malfoy laughed and flipped them, Harry's back slamming against the tiles.
“No, no,” Potter said, obviously noticing my distress. “It's just...” He stood back, gesturing to his now-bare legs. “Could you please cancel the jinx?”
Glinda handed the box now full of wands to the tiny elf from earlier, and Draco felt a momentary spark of panic. He didn't feel complete without his wand, and hadn't been away from it since Potter had given it back to him after the war.
“That's not a question.”
Dog retreated back to the sofa while Harry rummaged in the boxes and then sat on the floor untangling the lights. Harry never minded him being on the sofa and he might as well get comfy. It usually took Draco ages to untangle the—in Draco's own words—Muggle piece of crap.
But, as Ron told her about his evening spent with Harry, his posture and his voice getting harder by the second, her 'um's and 'ah's turned into actual words of support and agreement. She had had more than enough of seeing—and hearing about—Draco bloody Malfoy.
“That's what she meant by the dog thing, right? Maybe we should try that.”
“If you would please swap plates...”
Harry silently wondered when his inner voice had turned into Hermione. He didn't like it; he wanted it to shut up and stop smirking at him. He especially didn't like the fact that he was now arguing with
Once at the dining hall, Draco regretted his earlier reluctance to attend, as he and Harry were now the last to arrive, all heads turning to face them as they entered. Draco wondered if Glinda had told them all of their predicament.
Feeling quite energetic and refreshed after his drink, Dog bounded back into the living just as Harry was carefully taking the baubles out of their boxes. He didn't mean to do what he did. Really, he didn't. He knew how much Draco loved his sparkly baubles. He couldn't help it, though. He just couldn't stop in time.
“I knew showing you how to use the TV would be a mistake.”
“Thanks, Granddad. Now, about this morning...”
This is the story of the latter. We'll get to what happened on that fateful summer morning, but in order to do so, we must start at the beginning. Or rather, the end.
Harry closed the shop and walked the short distance to the
The bottle of wine—and another one from the wine rack—disappeared as Harry listened to Malfoy explain, but he wasn't really
“Really? Great!”
Harry and Draco had fallen easily back into their old relationship. Draco had taken his previous post in the Ministry; he had admitted that the only reason he had agreed to move to Europe was to get away from Harry. They both agreed that mistakes had been made, but they also knew that they had to forgive and forget if they ever wanted to be happy together again. Neither of them had wanted to discuss the reason for their split, and their friends respected their decision. Harry thought that they were simply too relieved to see everything was back to normal to spoil it.
“Shit! Bollocks! Balls!”
Draco’s eyes lit up before he hastily complied. Harry grinned. He was going to enjoy every single second of this. Harry drizzled the flavoured oil down the centre of Draco’s back, causing Draco to gasp and wriggle slightly. Harry stilled him by placing his hands on Draco’s hips and licking a stripe straight through the puddle that had settled on Draco’s arched back.
Both Harry and Draco knew the policemen were simply waiting for the guests to go to their rooms before buggering off. Useless bastards. It may be a few acts of 'mindless vandalism' to them, but to Harry, Draco and most of the guests, it was an attack. Pure and simple.
The poolside was busier than it was when he first arrived, and Harry was thankful that he'd remembered to grab a lounger beforehand. As he walked to where he had thrown his towel, Harry frowned as he noticed that someone had taken his seat.
“Yes. We've seen the
“Same here.” Harry yawned so wide his jaw cracked. “We can go out in a little bit.”
Harry nearly choked on his drink and Malfoy shot him a worried look. Harry wiped his mouth and bit down the laugh that was bubbling inside him.
“Sounds like a plan,” Harry murmured before falling asleep.
Malfoy was going on about future selves and whatnot, Harry had second thoughts. It was as if he was taking advantage of a person under the influence. It wasn't right.
the price we paid and it needed to be acknowledged. Thank you, again, and have a good night.”
Harry forced himself to speak. “You wish. I was just wondering why you had to leave so early.”
—he turned towards the stairs. Taking the steps two at a time, not missing Draco's look of bemusement, they arrived at Harry's room within seconds.
The glint of silver casually thrown on top of a pile of towels incensed Harry further. Malfoy didn't even care about the trophy!
~ ~ ~
“Fuck it,” Harry said quietly, shaking his head. “Honestly?”
The years had obviously done Draco Malfoy the world of good. He was still a snarky bastard, but Malfoy had an edge to him now that told Harry just how
“Oh, well this is surprising. This has never happened before. Because of the nature of the retreat, we make certain that guests are sure they want our help.”
“Hmm?”
“Molly saw some books in Ginny's bag and wouldn't shut up about them.”
“I said,” Pansy looked up from her magazine. Harry didn’t like the glint of her eye. “How did it go last night?”
“Yes, Mister Malfoy,” Kreacher said at once, popping in from nowhere and bowing so low that his ears were touching the carpet.
Harry ignored the catcalls and kissed him back.
“Another couple of chapters and I'm done. Just need to find some inspiration for the ending.”
Ginny then seemed to take great delight in telling them exactly how she would hurt them if they didn't make it up to both of them. Ron didn't know when—or
“Where'd you get the glasses?”
“What? Who? What?”
You were walking out of your room, wiping sleep from your eyes, and I knew I wasn't going to breakfast. The room was empty but for us and I had no excuses. No reason not to talk to you. Nowhere to run or hide. I struggled to remember the beginning of the big speech I had planned out.
I spoke up for you. That'd be creepy. And I promise I won't just attack you in the showers. I just wanted to let you know. Just in case.”
talked about his father.
theme tune roused Harry from his light sleep. Well, that and the crashing sound coming from his kitchen. Harry
“Evening,” Harry said, alerting Draco to his presence. “Have you ordered?”
“I would've—”
Looking around, counting with a slimy tentacle, Bob shook his bulbous head and sighed. “Has anyone got a clue as to where Hedwig and Darius are?”
“What?” Draco asked, already opening his biscuits.
“We would like to ask Mr Potter to come up and say some words, if he doesn't mind.”
He might as well have been with them. Actually, Ron would've preferred it if he had been. As much as Ron was grateful for Draco's absence, his presence might have curbed some of Harry enthusiasm. All day, no matter what they were doing, Harry brought Draco into the conversation.
“You like me, yes?”
Both he and Hermione had tried to go back to Harry's to talk to him, and after literally being blasted back to the Burrow, they gave up. They had even tried to send quickly-penned owls, simply saying how sorry he was, and asking to be given the chance to explain, but when the owl returned with singed tail feathers, they decided to wait until the morning.
With his clothes left in the very capable hands of Grenville—who was probably at that very moment checking the weather to determine exactly what he'd need to pack—Draco settled into his comfy chair with a well-deserved glass of Ogden's.
Draco coughed again. “Did you fancy me?”
“We're fine,” Harry told the now-panting man. “Sorry for the disruption.”
all fucking perverts.”
“Yes, so plaster yourself in this and you won't burn. Actually,” Harry blushed and turned his back to Draco, “could you please do my back? And then I'll do you.”
He didn't look angry though. Dog was surprised to see he looked quite amused instead.
Harry sent an owl to the hospital, requesting a couple of days absence. He was pretty certain they wouldn't turn him down as he hadn't missed a day of work all year and he wasn't the only person qualified to run the ward. It didn't matter, anyway. He wasn't going in and that was the end of it.
Draco had one overwhelming feeling at hearing Weasley's words when he had realised exactly who Harry was snogging on the sofa: hurt.
“You know.”
“No,” Malfoy said, advancing on Harry, showing no attempt to cover his glistening, wet, naked body. “I won. What is that phrase Weasley keeps saying? Fair and square, that's it. I won, fair and square. No cheating. Just skill and a fuckload of practising. While you were off investigating your little crimes and staking out your little criminals, I was out on the Quidditch pitch daily. I've worked for this, Potter, and I've worked bloody hard.”
“So you think I'm hot?”
“What?”
“Oh, fuck. Again?” Harry said as he tried to sit up. “Sorry, I must have drunk more than I thought.”
“—peace and quiet!”
“Don't worry; you're still going to eat the food that you chose. You're just not feeding yourself.”
I want someone who will date me and not run straight off to the papers. I want someone I can trust implicitly. And not just with my heart.
“Yes, no. Kind of. I don't know. I need... Can you... No, don't worry. Sorry.”
Harry was frozen in his chair as people ran about to get away from the flying glass. Harry had to grip the tabletop tightly to keep himself from pulling his wand out. A quick glance at Draco told Harry that he felt the same way.
Harry smiled. “I was, but I'm all better now. I was just thinking about my and Draco's first kiss.”
“In a minute,” Harry said. “I can't resist the Music Man.”
Harry rolled his eyes at her and made for the Floo.
“Arnold!” Bob's uncharacteristic cry of anguish drew everybody else's attention.
“S-s-sorry,” Harry choked out, not knowing what the hell he was apologising for. “Sorry!” he said louder as Draco slipped down to his knees again.
They played volleyball—stupid, unrefined sport, according to Draco—and splashed in the sea. Harry had caught himself staring at Draco many times and marvelled at the fact that he
I asked you to meet me in the pub after work for a celebratory drink and you invited Ron and Hermione to join us. It was amusing to see them both repeat their nodding from the second before. I'd never seen Hermione so quiet.
. “You thought I'd break your heart.”
The Aurors were supposed to beat the flunkies from the Minister's office. How could his team of athletic, made-for-this-shit Aurors be beaten by a bunch of diplomats who got out of breath if the lift was out of order? It was bollocks. If it had been a game of who could write the most boring speech, then yes, Harry would've put money on the pencil-pushers to win. But Quidditch? Fuck. He was never going to live it down.
“I don't care,” Harry blurted out. “I mean, I don't care what anybody thinks. I'm past caring.”
“Allow me,” Draco said, drawing his wand. “
“Iron Man.”
Leaving baby Jesus in his manger for the minute (Dog would enjoy having a chew on him later), Dog picked up a king and threw him in the air, catching it with his mouth. He did the same thing with Mary, Joseph and a lamb, too. He was having fun.
Harry laughed again. Why hadn't he ever noticed that Malfoy was funny?
I ran and hid in the closest classroom.
“I couldn't.” Harry could hear his voice shaking. “I tried and tried for months to get through to him and he wouldn't listen. And then he wants to walk back into my life? He thought I'd cheated on him. How could he think that?”
“Where are what?”
“He's got a flair for something,” Draco mumbled into Harry's neck. “Can I tag along?”
“Zagreb was such a success, we've been asked if we'd help out with other countries. Anyway, I don't think you want to be bored, hearing about my work. How are you?”
“I'm sure Harry doesn't want his sex life aired for everyone to gawk at,” Ron argued.
Harry squinted as he tried to work out what Malfoy was saying. There were definitely too many 'me's in that sentence. He stared at Malfoy, taking in his clothes, his glasses, the small changes in his face which told him that the man was slightly different to his friend.
“I think I've had enough wine,” Draco said, standing up on shaky legs. “As a matter of fact, I think I need some
“They're Muggles,” Draco whispered.
“Draco?”
Harry's eyes lit up. It might just work. “Thank you!” He jumped off his stool and kissed Pansy's cheek. “Would you close up?”
Another, even tinier, elf popped up with a tarnished milk jug and a precariously balanced sugar bowl at Draco's nod. Draco poured milk into each of their cups as Potter added the sugar, Glinda still standing suspiciously close by with a smile on her face.
“Fuck, I've wanted to do this for so long,” Harry whispered before raising his lips to kiss Draco fully.
Right on cue, as the last light was turned off in the bar, the policemen turned to one another, nodded, and jumped into their car. Harry rolled his eyes at them before sighing in relief. He had a quick look to ensure that they were alone, took out his wand and cast a Warming Charm over the two of them.
Harry carefully opened his front door and sighed in relief when Homenum Revelio revealed him to be alone. Not completely alone, a small mewing at his feet reminded him.
“You acted like a twat and treated me like shit.”
Harry impatiently pressed the button for the lift and when it didn't arrive instantly—
“Which did you want first?” Draco asked with a wink.
Apparently not, as the next time I saw you, I was in Diagon Alley with Pansy, clutching my Hogwart's letter in my hand and shopping for my school supplies. I could cope with the stares and mutters that followed me everywhere I went. I deserved it, after all. I just hoped that people could see it in themselves to put the war behind them sometime soon.
“Of course not,” Draco said without a beat.
When he finally stumbled to bed that night, Harry was dithering on whether Malfoy was actually telling the truth. Harry blamed the wine.
Harry poured himself a cup of tea and settled back into his chair to wait.
“I take it you liked your prize,” Harry said, not missing Draco grinning like an idiot.
Draco's smile didn't falter. A hundred (and three; he had them catalogued) insults ran through his mind, but he'd promised to behave. And, besides, it had been a while since he'd tried to get along with the git.
“I'll have a latte to take away, please,” Draco said. “And if you could take my meetings this morning, that would be great.”
Harry rolled his eyes and, with a swish of his wand, sent the balled up socks that were on the coffee table up towards Draco. It was a Saturday, and they had had a late night, so they were not very awake—especially Draco. They were supposed to be seeing another house this morning, and Zach was expected very soon. Harry had finally persuaded Draco to go with him; he had explained how Draco alone could help him judge if they could fit two people into the bathtub.
Ever since Al and Scorpius had become close, Harry and Draco had also become somewhat friendly. They'd moved past the polite 'Potter' and 'Malfoy' greetings, at least, and Harry had no issue with looking after his child for a little longer.
Harry cried out as a finger pushed into his arse beside Draco's tongue, sliding in smoothly, another soon joining it. Harry could feel his legs start to give way and Draco was there, an arm wrapped around Harry's middle, holding him up.
“Oh, yeah.” Harry had the good grace to blush; he could be so stupid at times. “Sorry,” he added to Draco.
They'd just had the one bottle between them that night, with Draco being exhausted from work and Harry not wanting to get too drunk—especially as he had extra children in his charge. But they'd talked a lot during that bottle—mostly about the children, before touching on safe subjects like work and family—which led to Draco extending an invitation to his place 'the next time'.
“What's the matter?” Ron asked. “He's been helping us find a flat. I thought it was all forgotten. It was just a drunken mistake after all. He'll just have to remember which bed is his next time.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione looked sad for a second before her eyes lit up. Harry loved it when she had an idea. “We can get you one. As soon as possible. I'll sort it; I promise.”
“Not Muggle ones, and definitely not like this. Look, they have their names written on them. That's brilliant. Only you would chuck them all in the same tin. The Bourbons give the digestives a nice chocolate-y taint. You should market this, seriously.”
That was that, then, Harry thought. Malfoy sounded normal enough. Maybe his wine had been off and he'd imagined the whole thing. Deciding to put it to the back of his mind—not before making a mental note about getting himself checked out in work on Monday—Harry wrote a quick note to Ron and Hermione. They wouldn't laugh at his lunch invitation.
“Yes, thank you, Trevor.” Bob raised his body further out of the lake to bring himself closer to Hedwig and Darius. “Wonderful work, you two. I have a new case for you, but that can wait until the end. Now that that is settled, Monty and Bridey, what can you tell us about the Miss Bulstrode and Miss Patil case?”
felt guilty that he'd lost his feelings for Ginny, but the guilt trip hadn't worked in quite some time. He wasn't going to the stupid Anniversary Ball and that was that. Nothing was going to change his mind.
Harry grabbed him, holding his solid, warm, throbbing cock – jerking him slowly while he thumbed the tip of his tongue along the edges of his teeth. Draco took over him, grabbing the both of them to make their tips touch – grinding him until they were both close to their very edge.
'I do, now keep going or I'll burn down this entire building!'
"Follow me," Snape muttered as he started to walk. Harry quickly whipped a tear off his cheek as he fetched his wand: semi-ready to follow the truth.
Harry shrugged but nodded eventually, though it didn't look very convincing.
The day bled further into nightfall. Harry laid down on the grass for hours. Crying, until the wind turned from warm to cold and the stars decided to come out and play. His eyes hurt. His glasses no longer had a purpose and his clothes had become damp by the evening dew. He had to go back. Once he managed to drag his body back to the castle he considered walking past the Slytherin dorms. Harry couldn't comprehend the loss of his love. He closed his eyes as he walked, his fingertips drawing along the walls while he fought his tears. Every time he closed his eyes more memories seemed to come back. How it all started, how they fought, how they met. Yet once he opened his eyes he wasn't there. Though he'd planned to head back to his dorms, he stumbled upon the room of requirements like he always did. Even though he didn't look up once the door appeared, it opened by himself - letting Harry in as he staggered forward.
Draco didn't reply. He simply ran up to him, throwing his arms around his neck to pull him into a close hug – his face buried under the hems of Harry's collar, finally willing to cry out and simply not give a shit. Harry stood petrified, his arms extended to the side – gesturing a simple "what the actual fuck" until he gave in to his own cravings and hugged him all the same.
'Wh-' Harry tried to speak through Draco's roughly way of kissing. Slowly he pulled back a bit, what resulted Draco to move his lips towards Harry's neck, and while Draco seemed to struggle with Harry's properly tied tie, Harry tried to swallow away some blood so he could ask a question in a proper way after. Now he thought of it. Wasn't it disgusting to snog while someone bled? Maybe this had something to do with being a Slytherin, though? Maybe they liked it kinky...
Hermione sighed another time, and lowered her book now - gently brushing her fingers along the cover of it because she apparently seemed to care for it, especially after the hits.
"And it bothers you why? Harry snapped back as he tried to make his way back to the great hall.
"You got what you wanted," Draco said as he wiped his mouth.
"Wait until my father hears about this," Draco spit, his expression turning more sour at the minute. Harry could only sigh, knowing Draco's words were like the same old song.
The note burned on the inside of his pocket. Should he tell Hermione about this? If just about the note and their meeting at Borgin and Burkes. He batted his eyes, staring down at his roughly patched hands and nails. Hermione lowered her book, lifting one of her eyebrows – curious but judgemental.
"Goodnight, Harry..." Draco muttered as he walked passed him.
"So are you," Draco sneered before he rubbed his eyes. "You know you're forced to watch my back. Otherwise he'll snap your head right off. You're weak for wanting more. I am the chosen one. Me! And you needed to become second best."
Another hitch fucked with Harry's voice, and he batted his eyes – not daring to look at Draco now the roles were switched. "I want you too," he replied - his voice raw. "I mean, we need to go Draco." He gasped for air and shook his head. "I don't want to lose you. Not again. And I will once they'll find out we are here."
"Huh?"
The music stopped. Harry flinched at the sudden silence, and put his senses to work – scanning for a sound. "Potter."
"Well there must be," Harry panicked. "I saw him! We've met. We've met so many times. I swear, I'm not crazy."
"-Mister Potter."
'You know what I'm talking about, Harry. Stop doing such idiotic things! You know Malfoy is not going to accept this. If he finds out what you did, you are going to be in trouble.' She hit his shoulder a second time, and then glanced around in the hope not to find Malfoy or one his bulky "slaves".
"Nearly a week. Mostly because your brain went all fuzzy. You turned out to be a nut."
Harry looked up from the floor, smiling once he figured out he came.
"Who has seen Draco?" Harry asked as students past by in a rush to get to their class on time. "Draco Malfoy, anyone?"
Harry tried to avoid any eye contact, but knew he couldn't escape from her motherly grip. Besides, she was one of his best friends. He couldn't lie, nor hold back. Yet, he knew he wouldn't be able to speak out the whole truth – knowing he barely knew what it was all about himself.
The blonde turned, shrugging all the same as a fair answer. "The usual. We don't really celebrate it, for my father thinks it's a muggle's business."
"Sush," Harry breathed now – trying to rid of Draco his underpants. The blonde tried his best to steady his breathe, and knocked the boy on the ground - allowing him to hop back on his feet again. Trying to catch his trousers, his boxers dropped to his knees by accident - getting confronted with his swollen erection – realizing how easy it had been to wet him up.
Hermione hit him on the head and shuffled closer to Harry who remained to be drained of colour.
"-oh, and chocolate liquor!"
"Well, I saw someone sitting from miles away." Harry smiled painfully. "Didn't think it was you at first though."
Snape let go of him at instance, giving Harry his lung capacity back for any strange reason. He looked at him, his eyes almost draining Harry's soul as he told him: "Do not tell anyone." He vanished into the room, the secret entrance fading at his entrance, leaving Harry cold and alone on the floor.
Excitement caused his breathing to become irregular. He could hear the walls moving. Talking to him. Opening a whole other world. Another room. He was standing in the Hall of Hexes. The seventh floor in the left corridor of the Hogwarts castle. Harry closed his eyes, pausing his walk to speak out his desires – screaming them out in his head. Anxious for what would come. Malfoy was dangerous. Many told him so.
Uncontrolled looks stained to Harry's back. People were talking about him. About his insidious outbreaks, and his deserted looks. It was about a week ago that he swore he'd seen Draco sitting in the Great Hall, and to this day – even though everyone told him otherwise – he refused to call it a tangled perception. He wasn't going mad. Draco was still around. No matter how silly it would sound, he could feel him.
It had been two weeks. Two weeks of walking into his friends their footsteps. He was nervous and afraid – knowing Draco held on to critical information that could destroy him. Harry couldn't afford himself to walk alone through these halls again. Not now he'd been encountering severe loneliness in his past. People couldn't believe him, that time his name got spilled out of the goblet of fire. They didn't want to believe him, how Voldemort made his return. And still many people doubted his sanity to this day.
Harry stared up bolt. Thinking about their possibilities, he could only think of one. One he did not wish to take – for it carried terrible memories.
"It was a mistake," Draco spoke, "You've been a mistake. It's been a fucking mistake you were even born."
"I guess so."
Harry nearly dropped his wand as he curled up his legs – pulling the sheets tightly around his shoulders. A voice came from the corner, yet no one seemed to be there.
"Because it does," Snape continued sharply - grabbing Harry's wrist to prevent him from leaving. "I always-"
He got swept off the floor, his robes nearly choking him as he got tugged along. He could not see the person taking him hostage. Someone tugged him backwards through a deserted corridor while Harry tried to put his glasses back on. "Fuck-" Harry screeched - grabbing the hems of his collar, trying to gasp for air. Suddenly he landed on his bottom - his glasses dropping down his nose having him to shove them back up again. "What the actual-"
And Harry was left alone once more with nothing to ease his head.
"What's with the long face?" Draco smirked – titling his head to the side. Harry couldn't do anything. With his lips parted, and his lungs out of oxygen, his blood started to circulate much slower. Allowing hands to take his jawline, to enclose his features And then it came. The blinding kiss. The touch of skin to skin. And he couldn't move.
Ron balled his fists and growled. “HULK SMASH! Awesome. Right, love?” he added, looking at Hermione.
Two weeks, they'd promised their friends and family. Two weeks maximum, and they'd be back, Mr and Mrs Granger in tow, ready to start living their post-war life. The only small flaw in that plan was that Ron and Hermione hadn't considered her parents' views on it. Mr and Mrs Granger—Paul and Janet, Ron had to remember—didn't want to return to Britain.
“I'll tidy my side of the room.”
“Who are we talking about here? Me or you?”
They were good together, they just weren't happily
Did you have a good night down the pub? I'm sorry I missed it. Are you free for lunch? I could do with a chat.
He had to decide what to do. As comfortable as his house was, Harry needed to get out. To do that, though, Harry knew, he'd have to face reality. The reality that he'd been having a secret relationship with one of his best friends and he hadn't even know about it.
“So, what did you think?” Harry asked, looking at the menu.
Harry, not trusting himself not to start babbling again, sat back and took a gulp of wine.
“What did you have planned then?” Harry smiled. “A quick game of chess?”
“If you've finished,” Glinda voice startled them, and they both turned to face her, “bring your parchment to the front so we can get to the fun part!”
“I knew I'd win.” Malfoy said silkily as he walked—no, sauntered—back to Harry, a tube of lube dangling from his fingers. “I knew I'd beat you. I knew I'd be having you right here. I knew I'd—”
“Next Thursday.”
At Harry's head bob, Draco unfolded the paper. On it was written two words that filled Draco's heart with hope and another feeling he couldn't quite put his finger on.
Harry dragged himself out of the pool and went to dry off naturally in the sun. Draco had had a quick swim first thing and buggered off, citing a desperate need for a massage. Harry didn't like the thought—or the thought that he wasn't liking the thought—of some nubile young woman running her hands all over Draco and was doing his utmost to
Picking up his quill, Harry started to write. He wrote about his feelings for Draco, and the depth of the love he had for him. He explained exactly what had happened that night, and how Zach had just climbed into bed with him, mistaking it for his own. Harry wrote about how he thought it was Draco, otherwise he would've thrown him straight out of the bed. He told Draco of how he hadn't seen Zach since he'd thrown him out.

holiday, it was bloody expensive.
“We're good, thanks,” Harry said, pulling Draco away from the 'bar'.
“'Mione, what's going on?”
to be sufficiently
“How... how was that?” Harry asked quietly when they broke apart for a breather.
The three, as one, turned towards the newcomer.
a bloody
“I was in work, getting a cuppa from the canteen, when some little pimply kid came bounding up to me; Merlin, you'd think he'd won the Prize Draw, the way his face was lit up. He said he had some bad news for me, and handed me this.”
“Never have sex in the Manor again?”
Harry was simply enjoying his holiday. If part of that was due to his surprising and blossoming friendship with Draco, Harry couldn't bring himself to care. He'd think about it some other time. He had swimming to do.
“I'd like to book a holiday to Belle Playa, please—” Harry looked at her name tag. “—Marie.”
Draco nodded, and Harry unscrewed the lid, and coated his fingers. Dropping his fingers past his own balls, he pushed one finger into his arse. One eventually became two, which quickly became three, until Harry was gasping and writhing as he fucked himself with his own fingers. All the while, Draco lounged against the door, watching intently with a grin on his face.
Well, that answered my question. “I, erm, stayed with Mother last night; I was looking for Harry myself.”
“Then...”
The only thing left to do was to face Malfoy. Quite frankly, Harry thought, he'd have preferred his WIMP test coming back positive.
Darius, too, was having the same thoughts of hopelessness. With all the huffing and glaring from Draco directed at the Gryffindors, Darius knew Draco's father would be 'hearing all about it'. But Darius also knew, not that he'd share it with anyone, that Mr Malfoy didn't actually know anything, and if he did, he thought himself far too important to deal with any school yard arguments.
“Harry?”
” Harry said quietly.
One thing that Harry always made sure to do, even though it pained him, was to continue to call Malfoy by his surname. He'd almost tripped up a couple of times, and once he'd even leaned in to kiss Malfoy over the counter. Harry managed at the last second to come to his senses and grab a beaker to the left of Malfoy, but it shook Harry. He just wanted to be normal.
“You seriously want to send Draco Malfoy a love note that Harry Potter meant to send to someone else?”
After a rather large tumbler of whiskey—laced with a potion of Draco's own design—Harry was calm enough to listen. Draco, as much as he wanted to simply lock the floo until the two of them fucked back off to Australia, wanted to talk to Harry about
Sparing a quick thought to what his friends, and in particular Ron, would think of him now, Harry  threw his towel and his sun lotion onto a spare lounger and jumped into the large pool.
Draco laughed as relief ran through him. Regardless of his and Harry's actions and words of the past three days, he really was worried that Harry was going to change back as soon as they left.
Harry had only just finished his tea when the front door slammed (and one of the Quidditch posts fell over) and Draco came in. Dog jumped up from his place on the forbidden sofa, barely able to conceal his excitement.
The dinners with the Malfoy family hadn't been as bad as Harry had been expecting. High-bred manners had won out over Lucius' obvious distaste for Harry's relationship with Draco. Harry had already won over Narcissa; she thought that Harry was a 'charming young man' and a 'perfect companion for Draco'. Lucius, on the other hand, still needed quite a bit more work.
“Okay,” Draco said, slowly closing his book, “what? Do I have something on my face or something? Oi, Harry!”
Ron did not.
“Knew what?”
As they drank their way through their illicit whisky, they chatted about inane topics, Draco fully aware that they hadn't actually talked to each other properly outside of their sessions. Draco laughed at Harry's insistence that the Cannons were finally on the up, and Harry made fun of Draco's toy collection. They stuck clearly to safe subjects, but Draco was just happy they were talking.
“Welcome to your first session here at Holding Hands,” Glinda said once they were all seated in one of the larger rooms. “For the next couple of hours, we're just going to talk. There will be no gimmicks or tricks, just us as a group letting our feelings out. My colleagues, Shelley and Howard, will be sitting in on this session, as they'll be taking some of the groups and I'd like you to get to know them. Any questions before we begin?”
“No, no; I've got one.”
Harry looked around and found that Draco was correct. Apart from the waiter and a lone barman, Harry and Draco were the only people in the restaurant and most of the lights had already been turned off.
worked hard this weekend, and I would like to say thank you for that. Please, enjoy yourselves; you deserve it!”
“Breasts, Harry. Boobs, knockers, funbags. Any number of the lovely euphemisms I've heard in the common room.”
“You know,” she angled her head and spoke quietly. “One of the gay cruises.”
—before taking a last look around the house. He knew Kreacher would be here but he had to to make sure that he hadn't left the tap running in the bathroom or the fridge door open. Once Harry was satisfied, he picked up his bags, put on his sunglasses and left for the airport.
“Know what?” Harry asked, looking around at his friends' faces.
Draco grabbed hold of Harry's hand, forcing Harry to sit back down. “Wait. Before you do that, we haven't finished talking.”
“So, neither of you dislike the other. So, I think we need to find out what's
“Harry!” Pansy shouted, bringing Harry fully back to his senses.
Harry dropped his head into his hands. Why did he have to ask? Why did he have to rock the boat? What the
“Um, no, I don't think.” Something niggled at the back of his mind, and he realised that he did have something he wanted to say. “Actually, I have something. Yesterday, Harry talked about hoping to find that people can change. I wanted to just say that I was only a child back then—”
“I thought you wanted to sleep?”
“Now can I take a look?” Draco asked after he had fully shut the door.
“I'm sure Harry is just off studying somewhere, Pig; no need to worry.”
Harry was confused. Draco's words about the book didn't hurt him. He knew his writing wasn't exactly literary genius, but hadn't he recognised the scene in the bathroom? It had literally happened in the toilets of this very pub not too long ago. It remained one of Harry's hottest memories of the two of them and Draco didn't even remember it. Now
Harry held out his arm as his fingers closed around nothing.
Thanks to McGonagall's speech—which I still wish I'd been present for; it sounded amazing—not only were we not going to prison (except Greg; trying to curse the wizard sent to remove your tracking charm is never a good idea) but we were actually going back to school.
didn't want to think about
“Maybe start at the beginning?” Hermione prompted.
“But he's been thinking about you.”
“Yep,” Darius said happily. “It's the combined genius of us.”
Pansy tied on her apron. “Better make it half five. I'll just go and owl the girls,” she said, blatantly ignoring the question. “You'd better get the tea started. It's nearly half nine.”
Zach smirked. “It worked, didn't it?”
That was that. That's how Harry Potter and I became a couple. It's not the end, though. No, that's just the beginning of the story.
“Anyone for tennis?” came the cheerful call from smiley-greeter-bloke—Tony, Harry corrected himself.
Which brought Draco a whole new set of problems he couldn't have envisioned facing. Sure, he'd seen Harry shirtless countless times before. He'd patched him up after injuries and even carried him before, but this was different. This wasn't work-related at all. It was just
“Is everything okay here, sirs?” The hotel manager had obviously been summoned by the grumpy looking bloke behind the bar and was running towards them with surprising speed.
Noticing the house, Draco snorted. Palatial, it was not. The grey-bricked building, while pretty and well-maintained, looked barely large enough to house twenty people. But, Draco thought, growing up in the manor and going to school at Hogwarts had probably given him unhealthy expectations.
“What?”
“No.” Draco held his hands out in front of him. Harry had never seen such a desolate look on his face. “I don't want to hear it.”
Harry stood up, searching for a reason not to listen to Malfoy. “Um, we only have a bit of time before we have to be back. I'm getting another cuppa. Anyone want anything? Coffee? Tea? Cake? Biscuits?”
“Stop it,” Draco said. “Mind out of the gutter, Potter.”
Draco walked towards him and put his arms around him. Despite what he was about to say, Harry let him. He needed to feel Draco against him, especially if it was going to be the last time. As Draco moved in for a kiss, though, Harry pulled back.
“What about you?” Harry asked. “I thought you'd be married to some perfect pure-blood by now, with your heir running about the manor and you off in the Ministry somewhere.”
“So,” Draco drawled, propping his head onto his hands in an obvious attempt to stay awake, “we'll do one of those stake thingies.”
Draco was relieved to see Glinda in the small room they were sent to for their session. Not that he particularly relished the idea of therapy, but he was even less enthused by the idea of talking to someone he didn't know.
Love,
“I didn't know you. I knew Draco M-full name. Now I'm getting to know Draco.”
“I don't think you're evil,” Harry said, his speech slurring a little. “Evil people don't play with children's toys. Well, maybe when they were children. I don't know. I think I'm drunk.”
Harry sat up straighter, finding himself unable to stop his cheeks from flushing.
“Aargh!” he cried as he opened the door.
For a long time, I kept our meetings a secret. Not that I was embarrassed or ashamed. I liked the fact that it was just for me. You didn't expect anything from me. You didn't ask anything of me. Ever since your insistence that I call you Draco, you'd been calling me Harry. I liked being Harry with you.
“Nothing,” Draco replied. “I just thought I'd pop in. I have to be in work early this morning.”
Dog wasn't thinking rationally though, and after an unsuccessful afternoon of trying to torment Harry, the risks were outweighed by the thought of finally seeing Harry annoyed. Creeping over to the fireplace while Harry had his back turned gathering all the boxes, Dog pushed the penguin with his nose.
you as a teenager?”
“And we need to fix that, obviously.” Draco added, surprised at Harry's honesty. He was expecting Harry to blame him entirely, and was touched that he hadn't. Draco was also extremely grateful that they weren't required to hold hands during sessions, as his palms were sweating profusely.
Harry laughed and resisted the urge to drag Draco back into the dressing room. He'd certainly found the passion he'd been looking for with Draco. Instead, Harry took Draco's hand and tugged him gently towards the aisle.
Harry wanted to punch the wall. He knew exactly what that meant: six months without Draco. Fuck.
of thanks. It was huge and like nothing he had ever experienced before; he never would have been able to  manage without her implicit—and written—instructions.
Draco jumped slightly but quickly recovered. “No, I was waiting on you. Please, sit down.”
“I'm so glad you wrote. I've been so worried about you. And me, I suppose. I am so so sorry. So sorry.”
Harry poked his tongue out. “It was one time! And it was months ago,” he said, giving Draco the address anyway.
The Hardest Word
“Oh,” Harry said as the answer hit him. He gently pushed Draco back slightly so he could sit up. “Is it the—” Harry gestured towards Draco's forearm.
“I'm going to take a break. I'm sorry; I'm not telling you where. If nobody knows, nobody can know.” Harry thought his reasoning was brilliant and nodded happily to himself. “I'll see you in two weeks,” he said, standing up to leave.
After persuading Darius to agree to send the note—which didn't take much; he didn't have a better plan, no matter how much he thought about it—Hedwig took the love note to the Owlery and asked one of the school owls to take it to Draco, no questions asked. The fact that the little barn owl who they asked had the biggest crush on Hedwig (not that he had a chance. She had her beady eyes on someone else, thank you very much) helped immensely.
Draco shook his hand. “You're on. Now it's my turn.”
“And no running!” the guard shouted. Harry really disliked him.
“Harry!”
called the police.
Whenever he and Hermione would be in Diagon Alley, Harry would point out one or two things that had caught his eye. He would owl Ginny magazines that
“But—”
The insults and looks didn't stop when Draco finally became a fully-fledged Auror. On the contrary, Draco faced the worst of the insults and the dirtiest of dirty looks from the one person he had to entrust his life to: his partner.
Harry gaped as Draco left the café. His mind was in a daze. He knew one thing for sure, though. He was going to fucking
Nodding to himself, Harry stuck another to the wall, and another, and another, until all four walls were papered in the brochures. Harry smiled and closed his eyes. He held his arms out to his sides and spun; he span around and around until he felt dizzy and more than a little nauseous. Harry shot a spark out of his wand before he was
Ron and Hermione had emerged from their room, obviously disturbed by the noise, and were horrified to learn what had happened. Hermione was insistent that they'd soon find Draco and clear it all up. Neither of them could believe that Zach would do what he did.
“What?”
“We deserve each other,” Draco added, stepping closer to Harry.
It had been a Friday just as normal as any other Friday in his life. Well, until he'd got back home, that was.
“Scared, Potter?”
“I'm gay,” Harry said, interrupting her. “Or bisexual. I haven't figured it out yet. This is nothing to do with you, I promise. I don't regret what we did and oh, Merlin. Please say something...”
Leaving Hogwarts meant saying goodbye to the protection we'd had from Professor McGonagall, our happy little bubble had burst. Within days of being out of school, I realised that our lives were never to be the same again.
Draco almost smiled at her enthusiasm. He certainly would have done if he'd been an observer and not an unwilling participant.
Draco nodded.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “We don't have any doughnuts, and I didn't plan on getting bored.”
“I didn't bloody know that, did I? And I did love you.
Harry's smile fell. He would've much preferred Draco to come instead of Gerald, who was not the cleanest of people, and was currently picking at his belly button. Harry
“I just didn't want to talk about it anymore. Nothing else. Can you just leave me alone for a minute?”
“Don't bother,” Zach told the house-elf. “I'm not hungry any more. Fancy some wine?”
“What are we talking about?” Zach said once he was seated with his pint.
“Hi, you.” Draco smiled. “What are you talking about?”
“I didn't—” Harry began.
“That feels ni—better, but I don't think it'll work. You're two feet taller than me; how about this?”
The article was just the beginning. Within days, the Howlers and hate mail started arriving. Professor McGonagall, who was fast becoming one of my favourite people, was extremely quick with her wand, banishing the offending red envelopes before they made it anywhere near us students. Any she missed, along with any hateful letters, were deftly dealt with by the quick wands of Granger, Ginny, Blaise and Theo.
“Then my job here is done.” Draco laughed and rolled onto his back.
“I remember
“I don't know. Yes, no, maybe. Fuck, it's a yes. Of course it's a yes. You know how miserable I am without him. I need him back.”
Draco tried his best to think of a topic to start off with, but all he really wanted to talk about was what had happened earlier in the day.
I was just walking through the lobby of the Ministry with Ron and Hermione, just on our way to lunch when I heard my name being called. Spinning around I saw you coming towards me. You were so excited, I don't think you even realised where we were and who I was with.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry said, pushing Draco onto his back and kissing him again.
“Harry, look at me. I'm not
“Harry, look at me. Really look at me. Does the me you saw earlier today look like the me sat here?”
The rest of the family also were surprisingly fine with his announcement—Harry suspected his ex-wife had something to do with that—and his friends didn't care. As long as he found himself someone soon and stopped acting like a 'third wheel', they were happy.
Harry could barely lift his hand for a wave. Luck? Bloody hell, the way the Frenchman had been looking at Malfoy during Narcissa's party, he definitely didn't need any luck.
“I thought I'd eaten enough of yours, so I went shopping.” Draco reached into his bag and took out a packet of Rich Tea. “They're your favourites, right?”
“Yeah, I can see that.”
“I'm doing it now,” Harry interrupted her. He knew the beginnings of a rant when he saw one. “I just wondered if you could open up next Friday.”
Then I discovered that Helen, my young, fresh out of Hogwarts, secretary had taken it upon herself to hide the letters from me, thinking that she was helping. It was only when I needed to replace a quill when she was out of the office that I found the bundle, hidden in her bottom drawer.
Harry nearly fell to the floor in shock, which was threefold.
“I would like you to talk about whatever you want: Quidditch, the weather, what you want for dinner. Anything you want. But as you do—and no one will be eavesdropping; don't worry—I will call out a body part and you need to touch that part on your partner as you talk. Like this. Face.”
“I won't pretend to know what has exactly happened between you and Ginny, but I will say that we—myself and Molly—have noticed that things haven't been right between you for a while now.”
“Just like that?”
Ignoring that, Harry pressed on. “So you think I'm gay, too?”
“What about it? Do you think you can get us out of it?” Draco didn't know why his chest hurt when he said that, or why he felt happy when Harry shook his head.
Draco and Harry, being the fully trained Aurors that they were, emerged from the scrum first, plates stacked with fat baked sausages and thick cut chips.
Draco had planned on talking to Harry more about what was going on with them during dinner, but he found himself having a great time anyway. He had a lovely conversation with Frumpy, where he heard, happily, that she and Grumpy had really seemed to fix their problems. Mouse was similarly sure that she and Giant had a happy future, and were even thinking about coming back to Holding Hands again. He hadn't even needed the wine; he was having quite a pleasant time.
Despite his best efforts, Harry could feel himself starting to come within minutes. Draco must’ve noticed this as he sped up his movements, causing Harry to speed his hand up. Draco came with Harry’s name on his lips, shooting pearly streams over Harry’s hand and chest. Harry finally let himself go; moaning loudly and filling Draco’s arse with his come.
Draco was in shock. What the fuck? He was Harry's first contact? Why hadn't he known this before? He stopped his pondering as Harry hadn't finished and Draco was more than interested in what he had to say.
By the end of the night, Harry was, and he couldn't even blame alcohol, starting to believe Draco. He'd even started calling him by his given name. Harry couldn't help it, not with the bloody git correcting him every time he said Malfoy.
—how much we were hated. It was, quite literally, written on the wall. In big red letters.
As the clock struck seven, Harry steeled himself as much as he could and Flooed straight into the pub. He was expecting balloons and streamers, maybe some wine or beer handed to him as he exited the fireplace. He wasn't expecting a half empty pub, with no Ron, Hermione or any of his friends. There were just a few of the regulars potted around the pub, and Tom, as usual, behind the bar.
“Darius, Hedwig, I know it's customary to have a few days off once finishing a case, but I'd like you both to make a start on this as soon as possible.”
Did always hexing him to lose his clothes mean I
Draco Malfoy.”
Harry flattened himself to his broom as he chased the tiny gold Snitch sparkling in the distance. He thought of nothing else; he wanted that ball. He
counselling. I'm sorry if I offended you.”
Harry couldn't stop smiling at the letter. He was expecting a reaction similar to the Weasleys': one of complete and utter shock coupled with—on the part of Ginny, especially—hysterical laughter and 'I told you so'. The fact that his two closest friends accepted his new relationship without question warmed his heart completely.
Once they were washed and undressed, they left Harry's room—towels in hand—and went for breakfast. They both stopped at the edge of the lobby at the sight of the policemen milling about. Harry hadn't forgotten what had happened the night before, their
“We're having dinner.”
Harry wasn't embarrassed by what he wrote; on the contrary, he was very proud every time one of his books hit the shops and outsold every other book in the genre. He knew it wasn't very high-brow, or very well written, but it sold and sold well. He just didn't think Draco would appreciate the fact that every single one of the sex acts he wrote were taken directly from their bedroom.
Harry eventually found his transfer to the resort and sighed gratefully before getting in. It had been a long flight, and Harry just needed to get to the hotel, strip off and jump in the pool. Before he could do that, Harry had to endure what felt like weeks in the sweltering coach. Harry berated his decision to travel as a Muggle; if he'd just Apparated straight to the resort, he could've been in that pool by now. Harry debated running to the toilet and Apparating from there, but the thought of the trouble it might cause, coupled with the fact that his luggage was stowed beneath the bus, kept him sitting in his seat, pretending to read his book and dying of dehydration.
But the rest of my little circle—Blaise, Theo, Pansy, Daphne—we hated it. We didn't want to be evil, we just wanted to be teenagers. We wanted to do normal, not evil, teenage
“I'd never...you really thought I'd hurt you? We're partners. I could never...”
It had been weeks since her and Ron's not-so-triumphant return home, and things with Harry were almost back to normal. They saw him a couple of times a week for dinner or drinks. Harry and Draco were ever present for the Sunday roast at the Burrow. Her and Ron had even sat through a few evenings at Harry's, watching he and Draco acting like an old married couple.
They quietly walked past the night porter, who was talking frantically into the phone, and made their way to the stairs.
Harry found himself perfectly happy with the fact that they were friends. You could never have enough good friends, and Draco was becoming a great friend. They spent almost every night together, talking, eating and drinking.
Harry smiled and Draco couldn't help but grin as well.
“She's good. She misses me.”
It had been obvious to everyone but Harry and Ginny that their marriage wasn't working. Well, according to Hermione, anyway.
First, before he did anything else, Harry had an absolute bastard to kick out of his bed.
“What if Hermione said what?” Hermione said, sitting down beside them and kissing Ron on the cheek.
“My kinky hero,” he whispered against Harry's lips before kissing him fully.
“There's only one bed,” Potter said, looking at Draco as if it were his fault.
“So...”
Harry rolled his eyes, smiled at Draco and turned to listen. From the last story Ginny had told them, Harry hadn't thought that the demure professor could get any worse. Harry wondered what Neville would think if he knew exactly what secrets his girlfriend spilled when she'd had more than a few glasses of wine.
“You know you're an attractive man, Harry,” Draco said, throwing Harry's words back at him.
“So, this was just some big joke at my expense?”
“Practice what?”
Pansy wrapped him in a hug as soon as Harry walked through the door, before slapping him across the face. His insistence that he had done no wrong only earned him a glare from Pansy. Apparently—being the seer that he was—he should have seen it coming.
“What the hell is going on?” Harry muttered, finally finding his feet and walking over to the damage.
“I've seen your bottom drawer, you know. Remind me to get you a Rubik's cube when we get back; you'd love it.”
Draco had insisted they continue with their plan to discover who was behind the attacks after they
Harry very briefly cursed all of his friends for having actual jobs and therefore unable to make this momentous decision for him. There were simply far too many choices to even consider
“Two of, oh, shit. Are you still on this future thing? And I didn't know you were such a good actor. Good job today; I almost believed you spent the weekend in Wales.”
“Harry, Draco! Great to see you. Come on in, both of you.”
“Have you finished work, or are you on a break?” Harry asked Draco with a smile.
When asked about his own experiences, Draco didn't know what to say. He didn't know himself where he and Harry were heading, and he definitely didn't want to share any of it with strangers. Looking at Harry, Draco simply smiled and told the women the truth: it had helped immensely.
“No.” Harry shook his head, trying to clear it. “Why are you here with
. Dropping his face into his hands, Harry listened for the gasps of horror from their friends. When he heard no such noises, Harry reluctantly looked up. He was shocked to see the girls peering at Draco's Mark, and looking between each other. He was expecting Hermione to talk about symbolism or something similar, but instead it was Ginny that spoke.
She didn't look too concerned, though, and sure enough, Harry was back within seconds. Instead of sitting back down, Harry strode purposely over to Draco, took his hand—and not in the way they'd practised; Draco knew his hand was going to hurt later—and dragged him out of the door.
“I'm trying to find a way to say this without freaking you out.”
As Harry listened to Draco ramble on about how he'd been an idiot and how he wished he hadn't started it all and how he was so sorry, he realised that he didn't need to hear it. Harry
Harry choked. “You can definitely help.”
“Very articulate. Are you going to ask him tonight?”
Harry dropped his own cup in shock. Pansy fell off her stool.
Did I really fancy Harry Potter?
Mrs Norris' growl of disapproval was drowned out by the whooshing of owl feathers as Hedwig and Darius took their places at the centre of the group. Spitting an errant feather out of her mouth, Mrs Norris slunk back into the crowd, not wanting to listen to the owls' witterings. She had no idea why the two owls were so revered. They had only been at Hogwarts for seven years and they had more responsibility than Mrs Norris could dream of. She'd been here for fifteen and hadn't had so much as a proper assignment, never mind an actual case.
Before Harry dropped off to sleep—thanks to another Malfoy special—Draco elicited a promise that they would meet with Ron and Hermione to see what the whole fucking mess was about.
“Um,” he said quickly, “I always told him I was bisexual.”
Pansy, Hermione and Ginny simply laughed as they got to work.
. Ron, Hermione and Harry. He didn't expect anything to come between them.

Draco nearly fainted. What?
“Face!”
“Sorry, Harry,” Zach gushed. “I didn't think. Are you ready to...”
After talking to Ginny about it—as strange and awkward as it was—and discovering that she had already met a few men, Harry was ready to dip his toes back in, so to speak. He was also happy to note that he felt no jealousy when Ginny mentioned she'd dated. It had been a year, but he had expected to feel
