“Erm,” Harry said, feeling extremely uncomfortable.
“No, of course not. Just told him I wouldn’t come to Hogsmeade with them and he didn’t say a word, just
down.
“Why don’t you both just try to accept Draco has the Mark now?”
“Me neither. I’ve been only for a few days and feel already like going mad.”
“Yes. Goodnight,” both Harry and Draco said almost in unison.
“God, Malfoy, you’re ruining me,” Harry said, breathless.
use a phone?” Ron asked, perplexed.
“We can still save them. Dumbledore was right, the Order members could fetch them and hide them. You only have to tell me, and we’ll do that,” Harry said calmly, his green eyes pouring trust into Draco.
“Fine, I’ll see you two later, then,” Harry said, nodding to Blaise and Ginny before exiting the room.
It was a picture of him, smiling in the Manor garden, taken probably when he had been 15 years old.
“You okay, mate?” Ron asked somewhere above him and he snapped his eyes open.
Harry snorted, almost amused. “And where would we go?”
“Thanks,” Draco said, smiling back at Harry. “Well, I don’t think I could call them my friends yet, but we’re actually going out to some Muggle pub in London next weekend when I’m visiting Teddy and Andromeda.”
“God, Draco, you feel so good,” Harry said when Draco started kissing and biting his neck.
“I mean, the whole process takes years, yes, but it gets better gradually, step by step. It’s not like one day you’re feeling depressed and anxious and the next you’re suddenly feeling fine,” Hermione said. “So, did this help at all to explain what there might’ve been going on inside Malfoy’s head?”
“I know, I know. Sorry, I’m making horrible jokes.”
“I’m sure it’ll be different, very different, but you’re going to make it. You are not alone.”
During last year Harry had tried to block all his thoughts about Draco and all the feelings he had for him, and he had actually managed surprisingly well as his brain had practically been only in survival mode for the whole time, not being able to handle any other thoughts than how to hide, escape and stay alive. He and Draco had, of course, had their few encounters during spring, the last one having been bittersweetly in the Room of Requirement that had been burning down like the remnants of whatever there ever had been between them. Now, that the War was over, the Slytherin had made his way back to Harry’s mind, slowly but surely, first appearing in his dreams, then in all the memories his mind had started to show him spontaneously,
“Harry Potter! Dobby is very sorry! Dobby thought mister Harry Potter had already left, so Dobby came to fetch the basket,” Dobby squeaked, looking panicked.
“How are you doing?” Sirius asked with a calm voice.
It was the only word he came up with to describe Malfoy at that moment.
Draco turned his gaze to his lap, his whole body radiating uncertainty now. “Yes. I – I don’t know where to start,” he said, voice trembling slightly.
“So long?” Harry asked, horrified.
Not that any of that mattered now. Everything had happened in a flash, and Draco still couldn’t quite make sense of all that had happened in the afternoon. All the fifth-years had been doing their O.W.L.s, and everything had seemed to be just as usual, until Harry had suddenly passed out. Draco had instinctively almost leapt from his chair, wanting nothing but to get to the other boy and see that he was alright, but Blaise had caught his eye at the last second and mouthed him to stay put. Having regained consciousness, Harry had left from the Great Hall immediately, shaking violently and looking pale as a sheet. There had been a strange, suffering look in Harry’s eyes that had haunted Draco for the rest of his exam and made him lose his concentration completely.
Although now that Draco came to think of it, the trio, and Potter in particular, had always tried to save him despite all the hatred. During the Battle of Hogwarts, they had done it even twice when he had been about to end up dead thanks to his so-called own side. Maybe that was their truth, the world they believed in. A place where even the criminals would be worth saving and getting another chance.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, confused, and Draco pulled back a little like a scared animal. His grey eyes were storming with anxiety. “What happened?”
Harry felt suddenly all too flushed and all too aroused, and it was incredibly difficult to remember where they were and why they couldn’t just keep on going.
“Well, yeah, thanks anyway,” Harry said, lost of words. “And remember, no word to anyone.”
--*--*--*--*--
“Just being a Slytherin and Malfoy’s good mate is enough of an insult to me,” Ron said sullenly and turned his eyes to Harry. “What I don’t understand is how you too can hang out with the ferret nowadays."
The spring is proceeding really fast compared to the other semesters in this story, mainly because both Harry and Draco are just brooding, heh.
“What are you doing on Valentine’s Day?”
Hermione giggled. “Well, I guess I’m not opposed to that.”
“No!” Harry exclaimed, desperate to be left alone. “I mean, thanks, but no. I just need a good night’s sleep and it’ll get better. See you tomorrow,” he said, waving his hand and leaving from the Great Hall hastily.
“Still trying to get rid of that?” Harry asked, pointing at the tree.
“I just, well, have read a bit about the pureblood culture and similar phenomena among the Muggles –”
“I know,” Harry said, sighing. “But can you imagine how it could be? I could take your hand and kiss you whenever I wanted and wherever I wanted, not needing to hide in these stupid alcoves.”
Draco squirmed a bit, looking uncomfortable. “No.”
“I’d definitely hope so,” Draco muttered, placed his cup on the sofa table, and laid down on the couch, curling up into a ball, his head next to Harry’s thigh.
“Say something,” Ginny asked eagerly.
“No,” Harry muttered, shrugging.
Sirius placed his hand firmly on Harry’s shoulder. “It’s going to be alright. Just talk to your friends or send an owl to me if you’re getting thoughts of you being evil again. Remember what we talked about that,” Sirius said, looking at Harry with a meaningful glance. “And don’t get into trouble,” he continued, winking his eye.
As there weren’t that many Muggles nor wizards living up north in Europe, Harry and Draco had booked a room in an ordinary Muggle hotel that was packed with people from all over the world who were eager to try skiing, see the Northern Lights, go on husky rides, stroke reindeer, try ice-fishing and whatnot. It didn’t take long before Harry was also tempted to try all those things, and the first days passed surprisingly fast, coldness and darkness all forgotten. Draco, of course, appeared to be some sort of a professional as he had spent holidays in the Swiss Alps with his parents, both cross-country and downhill skiing, and he seemed to have the time of his life watching Harry fall over and over again on skis. The snow was so soft, so the falling didn’t usually hurt at all; it was just Harry’s pride that got a bit hurt.
“Hm, when we noticed we might’ve some similar, well, interests,” Draco said, putting the plate and spoon away and pushing Harry to lay down underneath him.
“Erm, how so? I mean, there’s no pureblood god or anything like that.”
Harry smiled a little. He knew that couldn’t be anyone else but Draco, so he opened his eyes slowly and blinked them a couple of times.
“It’s a mobile phone. It’s a Muggle equivalent of owls and the Floo.”
“And I want to kiss you here, in Hogwarts’s corridors.”
What happened with Narcissa is a bit open ending here. I’d love to think she could eventually break free from the pureblood society and reunite with her son and sister, but it would have been so long process I decided to leave it out from this story.
“Erm, I had thought this could be some kind of pre-Christmas party,” Harry said, raising Draco’s head gently from his lap so that he was able to stand up. He fetched the picnic basket and the presents he had put in his bag.
Draco gaped at Harry, his mouth slightly open. “What on earth, how could –”
“Yes,” Draco said weakly, biting his lip and avoiding Harry’s gaze. “I just – I don’t think I deserve this. I mean, like, any of this.”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry said before he managed to stop himself. “I mean, all the babies are quite adorable, I suppose.”
And there it was in cat-sized letters on the cover.
As they arrived at the Quidditch pitch after fetching their brooms from the broom cupboard, Harry, Ron, Ginny and Draco discussed shortly the rules meanwhile Hermione and Blaise walked to the stands, deep in the conversation and showing very little interest in the game.
“Alright.”
“Erm, I think she understands you needed a second,” Harry said. “But she might’ve thought you didn’t like her present.”
“I thought I heard you coming,” Narcissa said, making Draco startle as she came quietly into his room.
“You could host it some day during
Draco closed his mouth and gulped. “But you didn’t die.”
Harry turned around on the corridor when he heard a familiar voice. Of course, Malfoy just had to have his prefect rounds always when Harry was going through his worst moments. “Malfoy,” Harry said, reserved.
As October continued, staying at Hogwarts had gradually started to feel much harder. It might have been partly because Harry envied Draco’s regular weekend getaways more than he had initially thought, but most of all probably because the whole castle felt like a bloody cemetery as it still reminded him too much of the War and all the people who had died there, and frankly, it was just so tiring.
?” Ron asked, wide-eyed.
“Oh, I’m not? Tell me, Potter, what am I to you then? A friend? An acquaintance? An old school comrade? You always used to make it so clear at school how much you liked me.”
,” Ron said, a sudden realization lightening his face. “
Draco did as Harry asked, putting his mitten back on and giving the glasses back to Harry. Then Draco came to stand behind him, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and resting his jaw on Harry’s shoulder, his cheek against Harry's. Harry could hear Draco breathing and feel his frozen hair ends tickling the side of his neck.
“Please, stop it,” Draco said weakly as his father poured coffee to all three of them before going back to his place and sat down.
“Thank you for the best pre-Christmas party I’ve ever been to,” Draco said and kissed Harry square on the lips.
Abruptly, the compartment door slid open with a small creak cutting Harry’s train of thought. Ron and Hermione had finally been able to leave the prefect carriage, at least for a moment.
“He’s alright, though it feels like I have two roommates instead of one as Ginny practically lives in our room.”
“Even so. He deserved what he got,” Draco said reassuringly.
“You’ve read the Daily Prophet already?” Hermione asked, eyes flaming as she waved the day’s Prophet in her hand.
I thought for a long time how I'd write the Sectumsembra scene, but at this point it didn't seem plausible for Harry to use the curse on Draco. I think it somehow makes sense in the books as Harry's a bit act-before-thinking type of person, but I don't think he could see Draco as an enemy anymore in this story, no matter how angry he was at him.
I'll be busier than usual during this and the next week, so I don't dare to promise to update as often as I've been able to do so far.
And oh god, how could Draco ever have let his parents make him believe kissing another boy would be horrible and disgusting? How could he ever have thought something that felt so perfect and made him feel so happy and complete would be wrong? Because it wasn’t. It couldn’t be. Not even all the Muggle gods and deities would be able to make him think otherwise.
“I would say so,” Blaise said.
“Look, I haven’t told you, but we have a kind of secret club where we practise Defense this year –” Harry began.
this is going to come out, the question is
“You know, you should pay him sometime,” Ginny said when they walked towards the seventh floor.
“I’m not – I don’t –,” Draco started stammering, sounding panicked.
“Yeah, well.”
After a couple of minutes, Draco arrived and stopped in front of the tapestry as well. He looked around in the empty corridor, looking a bit nervous.
--*--*--*--*--
Ginny blinked her eyes, baffled. “Just Ginny.”
Incredibly, they made it to the castle somehow. They entered the entrance hall and made sure there was no one else there.
a Death Eater,” Harry snapped.
Although however messy Harry’s head might have been, there seemed to be one unitive factor behind all his thoughts.
“Good night,” Hermione said softly and started to walk towards the girls’ dormitories.
Harry explained Draco everything: the love potion spiked Chocolate Cauldrons, asking Slughorn for an antidote, Slughorn wanting to raise a toast with the gift mead, Ron writhing on the floor after drinking his glass, and Ron surviving thanks to the bezoar.
“Yeah, why not? Why are you even seeing only secretly?”
(See the end of the chapter for
phrase, which made Harry confused about what the Slytherin wanted from him.
Harry had also started to see a mind healer once a week after Hermione had pushed him on the matter for weeks. Mr. Johnson, the mind healer Hermione had found for him, was a really nice, kind, and talented man in his forties, but Harry wasn’t sure yet if the therapy was actually helping him or not. But that was okay as according to Mr. Johnson it would take some time for Harry to be able to trust him enough to talk about difficult and hurtful things, and they were in no hurry, anyway. And if he never felt like he would want to open up to Mr. Johnson, that wasn’t wrong either; he had always the right to search for another mind healer with whom he could feel more connected if that was the case.
“No, but for real, do you really think one of those three is going to tell someone?” Harry asked.
“Let’s go and play Quidditch,” Ginny said in a bright voice, radiating energy.
Draco felt his legs becoming weak and his lips answering automatically to Harry’s kiss, his whole body humming with joy as he felt the so familiar body pressed against his.
it? Talk to me!” Harry snapped, taking Draco’s face between his hands, and making him look at him. “Please, don’t shut me out,” he said, almost pleading now.
In any case, Draco's feelings for Potter were something that could never be reciprocated. If Potter ever happened to fancy blokes, he could never fall for Draco. Draco had tried to hide his feelings so furiously that he had shown Potter only quite opposite feelings than his real ones. Potter was certainly 100% sure Draco hated him more than anyone, after all these years of cruel bullying. And on some level Draco really hated Potter. Sometimes it was just so much easier to blame Potter for causing Draco to feel these stupid feelings towards him and making Draco struggle so much with the path his family had laid for him. Without Potter, Draco would probably be able to meet his father's expectations so much easier.
Malfoy seemed still to be suspicious. “I think I already told you what I think about you,” he said slowly.
“Malfoy,” Harry muttered. He was still so full of anger he hadn’t even stopped to think about how he must look like.
. He barely even knew what religion was. “You’re not trying to laugh at me, are you?”
“No, not really. I – I just –” Harry stammered and flushed as he tried to find the right words.
“Don’t,” Harry said hoarsely. “Please. Don’t go.”
“Stop, you idiot,” Blaise said, placing his hand firmly on Draco’s shoulder. “Tell me what happened.”
Hermione sent a murderous look in Ron’s direction. “Don’t listen to him, Harry. I think you were really brave and a great example of the House unity.”
Harry took Draco’s hand, pulled Draco close to him and kissed him, enjoying his soft lips against his and their bodies flat against each other. Only that Draco wasn’t kissing him back. Instead, he was shaking.
“I’m willing to take that risk. But honestly, I don’t believe you’d hurt me. You’re so much stronger already, I don’t think you’d go back to your parents. Not anymore.”
Andromeda took the teapot and started to hustle around the kitchen, humming some sort of a lullaby. It made a warm feeling spread inside Draco’s chest; it felt good to be taken care of even though he wasn’t even sure if he deserved it. Probably not.
“You don’t even know what Muggles can do, they’ve created quite complex systems and societies,” Harry said. “Besides, I don’t think it has anything to do with what they can or cannot do, it’s more about the fear of something unfamiliar. From both sides.”
“What do you mean?”
In any case, Harry was well aware it didn’t work like that, but one could always hope.
“Harry, but it’s
Harry gulped. In a way, he knew Sirius was right. Harry may have put too much weight on being able to speak parseltongue and being an orphan while he hadn’t appreciated enough the things he had now in his life. Hogwarts as a place to call home, magic, his friends, the Weasleys, Sirius, Draco… Harry couldn’t think of a way to leave that all behind and turn to evil all of a sudden. If you didn’t take Voldemort, the possibility of war, and the gossiping Prophet and other Hogwarts’s students into account, Harry was actually quite happy with his life. He snorted inwardly. Well, not that Voldemort and the possibility of war would be some tiny matters to get over with, but on the other hand, Harry nowadays recognized much better the things he was grateful for in his life.
still okay with fraternizing with an enemy?”
“Don’t have them at Hogwarts. Left them under my mattress at my aunt and uncle’s place.”
“You had a crush on
“It doesn’t matter. What matters now is that you’re getting yourself expelled if you keep making reckless decisions like this, you know you can’t afford that.”
” Granger said, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. “
“Thank you,” Harry said. “And thank you for inviting me.”
?” Ginny asked, eyes widening as she snatched the paper from the table. “God,” she mumbled, covering her mouth with her hand as her eyes scanned the front page.
“I’ve got no idea what you’re saying to me.”
“Shh,” Harry said, putting his forefinger against Draco’s lips. “This isn’t fucked up, and you know it. Those thoughts come from other people, but it doesn’t mean they’d be the truth. The only thing that matters is our truth. What happens between us is no one else’s business. Besides, your parents aren’t going to get to know. No one is.”
“What are you doing here?” Draco whispered, nonplussed.
“I’m quite tempted to ask who this guy named Jesus is all the Muggle-borns and Half-bloods are fussing about,” Blaise said, thoughtful.
“Oh, for Merlin’s saggy balls, this might be one of the weirdest things I’ve ever done,” Draco said, amazed.
And that’s how Draco had ended up on the seventh floor. If he just could get into the Room, the one where he and Harry had been together. Just for the one last time, maybe that would help him to close the circle.
“I’ve written a letter, okay? That should be enough to represent me,” Harry said, annoyed, hoping his friends would give up soon and drop the subject.
Dobby had really outdone himself. Harry had only asked for some toasts and fruits, but instead, he had got still warm shepherd’s pie, treacle tart, butterbeer, chocolate pralines, and, to his horror, a couple of bright red roses.
Slowly, Draco changed the dirty and wrinkled clothes he had had in the Ministry cell to the perfectly clean and even unnaturally white robes. The robes fitted him perfectly and it was clear they had been really expensive, but he felt immediately restless and uncomfortable when he regarded himself in the mirror and felt the silk-like material all over against his skin. The robes could be just a present, a nice gesture to welcome Draco back home, but he couldn’t suppress the feeling there was something that didn’t add up.
“Harry, it’s easier if you just get over with it now.”
“That’s a really beautiful idea,” Ginny said, giving the letter back to Harry. “Should I put it on your neck?”
“Of course,” Malfoy said, nibbling Harry’s earlobe. “Do you really think I didn’t notice how you watched me at school? Or this summer at the trials and when you returned my wand? How you’ve followed me, making sure you know my every single step?” he whispered in Harry’s ear and started lowering his hand slowly along Harry’s chest, over Harry’s stomach, ending up to Harry’s prick. To Harry’s very definitely erect prick. “I know you want me. Have wanted for years.”
Harry pondered Andromeda’s words for a moment. “I think I can do that. I mean, be in the same place with him. For an hour or two,” he said, pensive. “Do you think I should forgive him?” he asked, turning his eyes back to Draco who was now talking animatedly with Ginny.
“Erm, well,” Harry said, feeling uneasy. “It was just a dream as I said, and I don’t actually even remember that much about it,” he lied. The dream had been so distressing he didn’t feel at all like talking about it with anyone right now. “Er, what time is it?”
“What the fuck, Potter? Why would they despise and hate you?”
“Where would I go?
“Nah, I think I’m sticking with lover as long as I don’t know his real name,” Ginny said, grinning. “Are you worried?”
“Oh,” Harry said, not knowing what one should say in a situation like this. “I’m sorry? I mean, if you’re feeling sad or something.”
As Harry was pulling his shirt back on, he heard Draco opening the door. Instead of hearing Draco starting to rage at someone, he heard him inhaling sharply, as if he had seen something truly frightening or shocking. Harry’s heart started to beat faster, and he hurried to the door.
“Ooh, I’m trembling with fear,” Ginny said. “So, where would you like to go for a walk?” she asked as they opened the front doors.
“If I get
“Are you sure about that?” Harry asked, feeling a bit disappointed.
“I know,” Harry muttered, devastated.
Soon Malfoy’s breath became too fast and shallow, and his body went stiff again. Harry guessed these were the signs of Malfoy starting to freak out, so he broke the kiss and gripped the Slytherin’s wrist before he could even consider fleeing.
Harry felt something coiling uncomfortably in his stomach. He had a bit bad conscience for having postponed and postponed his visit to the Weasleys simply because he was afraid of Ginny wanting to talk with him about their… relationship. Or about the lack of it. Or about the…
“God, ‘Mione, I didn’t know any of this. How can everybody still be okay with this? Why doesn’t the Ministry do something?”
a step or two ahead. Talking to Dumbledore would have only made things much, much worse because the Dark Lord would have gotten to know, he always got to know, and he knew no mercy. However, it did make sense to Draco why Harry ranted so much about Dumbledore and his abilities; he had always seemed to have this demigod-like image of Dumbledore, as if Dumbledore had always a solution for everything.
“Are you really okay with me joining your company?” Draco asked in a low voice. “I could make some sort of an excuse and stay inside if you’re feeling uncomfortable.”
“What?” Harry exclaimed, surprised. “Why haven’t you told me?”
“Love,” Draco whispered, his lips ghosting over Harry’s.
“But they’re all gone, all the other Gryffindors we caught and –” Draco began again.
Looking suspicious, Draco opened slowly the present that revealed a box of handmade fudge and a knitted, green sweater that had a grey ‘D’ on the front side. Draco looked at the sweater, confused, and all of a sudden, he went paler, if that was even possible, and his hands started to tremble as he ran his fingers over the letter ‘D’.
“I can’t tell you, all right? It’s better you don’t know.”
“— and I heard them talking about something odd, an Unbreakable Oath or something.”
“That’s the thing, you wouldn’t,” Ginny said, grinning back at him.
on the bottom of an ocean.
“Poisoned? What do you mean poisoned?” Draco asked, looking slightly alarmed.
“Yes,” Ginny said in a low voice. “I mean, I feel like shit, but don’t we all right now?” she continued, laughing grimly.
“Yes. You don’t have to sound like that, we get along quite well these days. I gave him even a new hat.”
“Didn’t you read the article?” Hermione asked, lifting her eyebrow. “He told his parents he won’t marry a woman, and therefore not produce an heir. Well, at least not with a pureblood woman who would be the only acceptable option according to the conservative purebloods.”
“I heard that already you twat. What do you mean you almost got sorted into Slytherin?”
Harry chuckled. “Wouldn’t cross my mind.”
The conversation between Draco and Snape is a slightly modified version of J.K. Rowling's version in the HBP.
Ginny laughed light-heartedly and patted Harry’s arm. “Don’t be. There weren’t really that much feelings involved.”
“Don’t play stupid, you know very well what I’m talking about,” Blaise said, annoyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry snorted. “He’s never thought too highly of me. He’s actually telling me the same story but reversed. You know, how I’m only taking selfishly advantage of you and how I’ll never be worth you.”
“You want some company?”
Harry gulped as he felt like bursting out of emotions. “You would?”
“Anything.”
“Well, the House unity is a matter of the heart to me,” Blaise said, placing his hand over his heart as Ginny rolled her eyes. “Actually, I just wanted Draco to be happy. You’re pureblood, right?”
Harry burst out a laugh. “Just keep telling the story about your medieval boarding school, and you’ll do just fine,” he said. “And don’t hex anyone.”
When the train arrived at Hogsmeade, Harry could guess Draco had noticed him coming into the compartment as he made sure he was the last one left in the compartment.
As soon as Harry had made it back to Hogwarts, he rushed to the Room of Requirement, but Draco wasn’t there yet.
Malfoy pulled his hand away from Harry’s grip and started framing Harry’s lips with his index finger. “I like you, too, but that much must already be obvious to you.”
After a while, Harry got snapped out of his thoughts as he heard the door creaking open.
Granger gave him an unreadable look before answering. “He’s doing alright. Well, all things considered.”
“What, in Salazar’s name, is this?” Draco asked when he had managed to unwrap the mobile phone. Zabini looked at least as puzzled as Draco as he regarded the phone in Draco’s hands with vacant eyes. Harry felt a bit embarrassed, maybe the phone had been a silly idea after all.
De skimrar där som guldkorn,
Draco lifted his eyebrow. “Be my guest, then.”
“Oh, yes, they would. But only on their conditions and if you promised to follow their rules. You are their only son, and for Lucius, it’s horrible to lose an heir as the Malfoy family will otherwise die after him.”
“I don’t snore,” Harry said, defending himself. “Nor drool.”
“Well, I might have reorganized my priorities a little,” Draco murmured, turning towards Harry so that their noses were touching.
“You’re trying to make me a case study?” Draco asked, cutting this time Granger short.
their best and Harry had simply no idea, what he could do anymore. He had definitely not wanted things to go this way. He hadn’t wanted the executions, he hadn’t wished for anybody’s death.
“No, but it’s a high-control group with various similar elements with sects and other conservative religious groups.”
Ginny’s face turned almost as red as her hair. “I don’t know yet. But I’m going to get to know soon because I, for one, took the Muggle Studies.”
“He’d get to know if I told you, he always does,” Draco said, sounding miserable.
One evening, the sky was so clear Harry and Draco thought it might be perfect weather for the Northern Lights spotting. They checked the aurora forecast, and there seemed to be a rather good chance to see them that night, so they decided to head to the shore of the Arctic Ocean.
“Alright, alright, I’ll try my best,” Draco said, impatient. “Come here,” he said, reaching out to take Harry’s hand and pulled Harry to sit down next to him.
But they had both been wrong. Draco knew that for the most part of his life he really had been weak and a coward who had just tried to create a mask or a disguise that would tell a story about him as a confident, strong, and brave wizard. But eventually, his mask had cracked and broken completely in the final stages of the War, revealing the scared, weak, and insecure teenage boy who had been hiding behind it the whole time. He was still weak, now both mentally and physically, but he wasn’t a coward. Not anymore. He knew he was going to die tomorrow but to his own surprise, he didn’t feel fear. He felt bitter about how everything had turned out and he was sad because he had to give up his life before it had properly begun, but despite all that he had been able to make peace with his destiny.
“Meet me tomorrow? After dinner, on the other side of the lake?”
the Mark,” Draco said grimly, eyes still fixed on the lake.
“You’ve got no idea what it does to me to only sit next to you without being able to do this,” Draco said and nibbled Harry’s neck gently. “Or this,” he continued as his lips found Harry’s, making Harry whimper.
“I don’t know how it’s going to work, or if I even know
And so, Harry had found himself in a huge garden in the countryside in Seamus’s family’s summerhouse with a bunch of other Hogwarts students and fresh alumnis who all were desperate to get intoxicated.
Draco didn’t belong to those people. Actually, he was feeling exactly the opposite as he strode along the school corridors, vision blurring and heart hammering hard in his chest. Something had gone wrong. Really, really wrong.
“Hi,” Harry whispered, touching lightly Draco’s thigh under the table when Draco came to sit next to him.
Draco stood up as well, crossing his arms over his chest. “You know why I can’t. My family would suspect there’s –”
,” Hermione had said.
to think about how pitiful and utterly helpless he felt right that moment. He could worry about that later. Potter didn’t hesitate to wrap both his arms tightly around Draco’s waist again, and soon Draco felt the familiar, revolving and squeezing sensation, as if he was forcibly stuffed through a narrow pipe.
When Ron had come to Harry’s other side, Harry started telling them in a low voice. “Malfoy knows something about Hagrid. He was hinting that something may have happened to him.”
Draco nodded, not feeling able to open his mouth as he felt suddenly a frog in his throat.
? He would see you as a traitor.”
“Well, we obviously need some Slytherin allies,” Hermione said firmly. “We already have Blaise and Draco.”
A few days after the weekend, Harry was in the eight-year common room, sitting by a table with Ron and Hermione. The other two were doing their homework but Harry found it impossible to concentrate. Instead, he had decided to scrutinise the Marauder’s Map he had placed on the table, just to see who was where and so on.
book with you to Hogwarts?”
“Definitely. He’ll say yes as soon as I tell him your redheaded female friend is part of the plan. He loves redheads,” Draco said, grinning. “Oh, don’t worry, Harry, I’m only joking. Blaise will act decently,” he added as he saw Harry’s face turning suspicious.
Thank you once again for reading and happy Pride Month!
Ginny didn’t have to ask Harry twice as he had waited impatiently the whole day for a chance to slip away for a while. He ran the whole way to the room that was now considered as his and Ron’s, took the present and the phone from under his bed and met Ginny in the garden.
Harry listened to Hermione, shocked and feeling sickened. He hadn’t had absolutely any idea; he hadn’t even thought anything like this could be possible. “Do you mean your family and friends could actually abandon you if you were different or expressed your own opinions?”
“I assumed you would be here,” Snape said in a low voice, stepping quietly onto the balcony.
“Yes, I just thought… Well, we haven’t really been hanging out with each other that much and –” Draco began to ramble, but Harry cut him short.
“You know I wouldn’t be able to free another wizard’s house-elf,” Harry said, looking innocent. “Though I might have helped your father to free him.”
“You automatically assume it has something to do with me?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrow as he sat up on his bed.
,” an old-looking house-elf muttered as he descended the stairs. “Oh, Master has a guest with him!” the elf peeped and bowed deeply.
Harry could see Draco was trying to hide his smile. “I’ll ask him if he wants to come sometime. Even though you think he’s weird.”
“No, thank you, I’m already full,” Harry said, and the corners of Molly’s mouth turned slightly down. But Harry really couldn’t eat a single forkful more, not even to make Molly happy, and not even though the food was truly delicious. It was just that the sandwiches Kreacher had made for breakfast had turned out to be a bit more filling than what Harry’s breakfast usually was. Especially because Kreacher had just happened to read how carb-rich the bread was and how important it was to maintain the nutrition balance in every meal, which is why Kreacher had decided to add some extra protein in Harry’s sandwiches.
“I still don’t get why people just don’t leave,” Harry said, frustrated. “I mean, anybody can tell love and acceptance that is dependent on your acts isn’t healthy.”
“But that’s the point, I don’t trust –”
“Yeah, right, and I am a completely tame and harmless blast-ended skrewt.”
That seemed to snap Draco back to reality. Slowly, he walked to the table and took a chair in front of the cake.
Before Harry managed to pull Draco’s shirt off, there was a sudden, loud bang that made them both jump.
Harry’s hand went automatically on his neck to make sure the necklace was still there. He had done it a lot during last year when he had been hunting the Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione, checked it was still left and spun the ring around the necklace as if it was some sort of a stress toy.
They waited for a while in silence, but no one came to answer the door.
“I can try,” Draco said in a weak voice, staring at his half-empty cup.
“Well, then, I’ll hear from you soon,” Draco said, sounding like he didn’t want to end the phone call. “Love you.”
“You look like you haven’t slept at all last night. Are you alright?” Harry asked, feeling stupid as he already knew Draco wouldn’t probably answer to him.
Draco looked deep into Harry’s eyes, his whole posture looking much more relaxed now. “Why are you trying to understand me?”
“Ginny? You mean the Weasley girl? What should I think about her?”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, how do you think I’d do that?” Harry shouted at Draco, feeling his face burning. “Your side wants to kill me. Voldemort wants to kill me. He has tried to do it, what, four or five times so far, and it’s not a question of if he’s going to try that again. He
“Thanks. I’ll give you the address where to get it after classes.”
“Harry, stop, he’s not worth getting into troubles,” Hermione screamed as Ron put his arms around Harry’s chest, trying to pull him away from Malfoy.
“What makes you think so? I’m the second youngest and Ginny’s only one year younger than me,” Ron said defensively. “So, how did it go with the Muggles?” he went on and asked Draco smugly, a challenge in his voice.
Draco placed the hat back on his lap. “Thank you.”
The corners of Draco’s mouth turned into a humourless smile. No matter what he would have done during the war, the result would have remained the same for him. Maybe the only way to survive would have been changing the side, but he would never have had the guts to do it. And his parents would have
“Oh,” Potter said, looking slightly surprised, as if he hadn’t really believed Draco would eventually agree. “Er, great, so. We should hurry up. I’ve got no idea where the Aurors are supposed to be patrolling right now, but we could try to go the way I came here. At least it was deserted,” he babbled, snatched his Cloak, and started to walk towards the door, ready to go.
“You? An astronaut?” Draco said, sounding amused.
“Hm,” Ginny said, pensive. “As I can’t read his mind I can’t say for sure what he’s thinking, but from what I’ve seen I’m sure he loves you. A lot. I don’t think he’d be able to leave you even if he tried.”
“Maybe not yet, but what about in a year or two,” Ron said gloomily. “But yeah, get your point.”
“Yes, Draco, calm down. You can speak in your normal voice,” Harry said, trying not to laugh.
Harry stopped and turned around one more time. He gave Ron a tired but wide smile, the first real one for days. “I’m really happy for you, for real. We’ve got to celebrate this tomorrow.”
“Ginny who? Like… the girl Weasel?” Draco asked, frowning.
“Nothing,” Harry said gloomily.
“Yes. Malfoy’s going to live with us for a while, and no one else must know about it. Only the three of us are supposed to know he’s here,” Potter said strictly. “And could you be so kind and cook for Malfoy and obey him if he asks for something while he’s here?”
“Well, not exactly.”
“Well be my guest, Potter, and tell me what I still have left,” Draco said through gritted teeth. “My parents are dead, and all my friends are either dead or they’ve left the country. No one wants me here anymore. I’ve got no one.”
“I know! I’m not saying they shouldn’t be punished for what they’ve done. But I’m not in favour of the death penalty. I don’t want to live in that kind of society where killing people is just okay.”
“And you knew about this?” Ron asked Hermione.
“Well, well, isn’t that a sweet sight,” Lucius Malfoy snarled, taking a few steps towards Draco and Harry.
“Mm-hm,” Draco mumbled for an answer. He wished Potter would leave already. He wanted to be left alone.
Draco just glared at Zabini. “As if you’ve never snogged people in alcoves.”
“Hey, I’ve got something for you, too,” Ron said, digging his bag. “Here!” he exclaimed eagerly as he found an opened box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. “Sorry, got a bit hungry on our way back. Studying French is hard work.”
“I so did. A purple, knitted hat with a bit of silvery glitter,” Draco explained nonchalantly. “He seems to have a thing for rather colourful clothes.”

For the first time in ages, it was only his mind that was in his small and cold cell in Azkaban while his body was somewhere else, in a huge, immensely soft bed, wrapped tightly inside a thick and warm blanket.
to do with the cursed necklace, there might be a chance Draco had something to do with the mead, too. Harry was absolutely sure someone, probably Voldemort, tried to kill someone, but whom? It couldn’t be Katie or Ron, and even killing Slughorn wouldn’t make much sense. Or
As every Thursday, Gryffindors had Potions with Slytherins, which Harry wasn’t looking forward to at all. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking towards the dungeons when they heard Malfoy proclaiming loudly how Umbridge had given the Slytherin team permission to continue playing straightaway.
“Enough, Harry. We won, fair and square,” Ginny said, smiling triumphantly after landing on the ground, Ron following right after her.
“I’m not obsessed! He
“What is this?” Harry whispered, holding Malfoy’s wrist, and doing small, soothing circles with his thumb.
“And play with each other’s hair?” Draco whispered.
Harry flushed and blinked at Ginny. “You do realize you’re now defending
“Yes,” Harry said, nodding. “Around seven o’clock?”
“No, I’ve already admitted it’s a losing battle to fight my dear mother’s Permanent Sticking Charm,” Sirius said, laughing hollowly. “Just wondering how different routes one’s life can take.”
Even though Harry was extremely happy about the article and everything that had followed it, he was even happier about Ginny and Blaise. The thing between them had escalated quickly, and even though Ginny kept stubbornly saying they had just become very good friends and they weren’t really together together, they had started to spend almost all their free time with each other. Of course, Harry was truly glad for both Ginny and Blaise, but he couldn’t help feeling selfishly more excited about how much more opportunities the situation created for Harry and Draco to meet. Now they didn’t have to see each other only in the Room of Requirement, in a random alcove or somewhere outside at such place and such time no one had a chance to see them together. Now it was only logical for them to meet publicly from time to time because Harry, of course, wanted to hang out with Ginny and Draco with Blaise, so it was obviously absolutely necessary for them to learn to put up with each other on some level.
“You don’t even believe that yourself,” Harry murmured, letting Draco pull the shirt off him.
Harry considered Ginny’s words for a moment. Somewhere deep inside he knew he believed Ginny, had actually believed all along. He knew he wouldn’t be even able to be with Draco if he truly believed he was a real Death Eater now, but the Mark was still something he couldn’t get over with that easily.
would I go? There’s nothing for me out there anymore,” Draco said and rubbed his temples, feeling a budding headache making him slightly dizzy. If he only could have spent his last moments alone in peace and not like this, fighting with damn Potter.
Harry held his breath as all the thoughts left his mind. He hadn’t really thought through his proposition before he had said it out loud, let alone thought Draco would just… comply. Slowly, Harry started breathing again, and when he noticed that Draco had relaxed and started breathing calmly, too, Harry sank his fingers tentatively into his hair.
“Fine. Christmas feast with the Dark Lord, couldn’t have come up with anything better,” Draco said gloomily.
“You do realize that sounds completely mental. Draco Malfoy just kissed you out of the blue?”
“From the start? What happened after you called me when I was still at the Dursleys? I only remember you telling me Voldemort and a bunch of Death Eaters were visiting occasionally at the Manor.”
Harry, probably even so much he’s trying to feed him to death. There’s always so much food at Harry’s he just can’t eat it all by himself, and Kreacher keeps asking every ten minutes or so things like
“What do you mean?” Harry asked.
“I’ll explain to you later,” Harry said, smiling a little at him.
This summer was somewhat better than the previous one also because Harry didn’t feel completely cut off the Wizarding world, which was mostly thanks to him and Draco being able to be in contact with each other. Usually, they only texted to one another, but one evening Draco surprised Harry by trying to call him.
Harry was still quite obsessed with Draco disappearing from the Map, but he didn’t know anymore if he truly wanted to know what Draco was doing. On the one hand, Harry felt like he ought to try his best to find out because of Ron and Katie and possible future victims, but on the other hand, he knew knowing might be too much, maybe even the end for him and Draco. Besides, one was always innocent until proven guilty, right? So, as wisely as ever, Harry decided deliberately to keep ignoring the giant-sized elephant even though his screaming and protesting mind didn’t quite want to play along.
Harry startled. For a fraction of a second, he was sure Umbridge had discovered them, but then he could hear a familiar laugh. “Ginny! You can imitate her too well for your own good.” Harry said, laughing now as well.
“Could’ve gone better. Though I think I wouldn’t have been able to do this at all if Granger hadn’t helped me,” Draco said, shrugging and looking at his lap. “I hope that’s okay. You know, Granger passing time with me,” he continued, biting his lip nervously.

close to Harry, holding hands with him. He snatched his hand hastily away and leapt aside as if lightning had hit him. “Father, I can explain –” Draco began.
“Just get out of my way,” Malfoy said as he passed by them and exited the Great Hall.
Soon, however, Harry stopped dead when he noticed what Hermione’s face looked like as she came nearer. Her hair was a mess, her eyes were red and swollen, and there was a stream of tears glistening on her face.
“Okay, good night then,” Ron said, waving to Harry and Hermione.
“Does solely the Dark Mark make one a Death Eater?” Blaise asked, straightforward.
Malfoy looked at Harry suspiciously. Then he seemed to decide that Harry didn’t appear to be a threat at that moment, so he sat cautiously down on the ground next to Harry.
“What do you mean?”
“Nothing. Just wanted to see what the room looks like from this perspective,” Draco said, trying to stand tall under Potter’s suspicious glare.
“And you had all the reason,” Ron said grimly, probably thinking about all the mocking and name-calling that had been directed at Hermione ever since she was eleven.
“I s’pose. We thought it’d be nice to make it a habit and go and visit different pubs in London every other weekend or so,” Draco said, his cheeks still burning red.
“No! We’ve tried our best, we’ve talked to the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic. Hermione is going again to the ministry to talk to them, she has proofs and literature against the executions –”
once.
“I know! I just wanted you to know that you’re soon making it quite clear your feelings for Draco are not purely antagonistic.”
Draco came inside cautiously and turned his grey eyes instantly to Harry. Harry’s breath hitched as his eyes met Draco’s. Just like the Room, Draco, too, looked the same, with his soft, slightly wavy and blond hair, pale skin and sharp features. He looked absolutely gorgeous.
“Hey look! Troubles in paradise,” Ron said, smirking and staring at the Slytherin table when they were eating breakfast the next morning.
Not even Malfoy’s.
“Potter, you remember what I told you about the pureblood system? It’s not taken very well if you’re… different,” Zabini said gloomily.

“Blaise is still abroad,” Hermione said, biting her lower lip nervously. “Did he have anyone else he trusted, besides you and Ginny?”
flying. Have you been outside today? It’s cloudy as hell, and I was in the middle of the clouds, so it’s no wonder Ron didn’t see me,” Harry said, irritated. “Sorry, mate, I was kind of lost in thoughts. Let’s go flying tomorrow after classes?” Harry said, turning his eyes to Ron.
“It’s just that, well, I think Ron and Hermione might be worried about me as they haven’t seen me after we came back yesterday. I probably didn’t tell them where I went after that.”
“Don’t,” Draco said, cutting Harry short. “We weren’t exactly on good terms around my birthday and then you lost your godfather, for Salazar’s sake. Do you really think I’d expect you to remember to get me something for my birthday?”
“Er, just the minor that fact I’ve always been horrible to their whole family and I let the Death Eaters into the school and one of their children got hurt because of that,” Draco said, strained.

Harry snorted. “And how exactly do you think you get to know if I open this before?”
“What’s going on?” Harry whispered as soon as they had found a secluded corridor that was far enough from all the students rushing here and there.
--*--*--*--*--
(See the end of the chapter for
“If I knew I wouldn’t run around the corridors, now would I?” Draco snapped and started to walk again at a fast pace.
“And you’ll never guess who’s the lucky one from Slytherin,” Ron added sarcastically cutting off Hermione’s explanation.
“Where have they gone?” Draco asked desperately.
“That’s alright. I think I would’ve hit myself, too, had I been in your place,” Harry said. “Anyway, I got it fixed, so no harm done, really.”
“Yeah, what was that all about? Ferret looked speechless for a moment, as if you had done something,” Ron commented, bemused.
“Erm, I think we’re not going to get rid of each other for a while, and to be honest I’m quite tired of trying to ignore you all the time,” Harry said, picking his cuticles. “Maybe we could, I dunno, try to tolerate each other?”
--*--*--*--*--
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to push you. That was really stupid of me, there’s already way too much on your mind as it is,” Draco said, babbling nervously. “I just… Are we okay now?”
“Sorry, sorry. It’s just me,” Harry whispered, snickering.
Sirius studied Harry for a while before he said anything. “Are you worried I wouldn’t be okay with you seeing another boy?”
“I know, it’s okay. I mean, I’m not going to tell anyone,” Harry said, trying to remember all Hermione had told him about the pureblood ways of thinking. It was pretty hard to concentrate as he felt Malfoy’s warm hands caressing his cheeks. “I don’t want anyone to know, either. At least not yet.”
“Well, that’s no surprise as we got to learn such important subjects as Divination instead of all the Muggle school subjects,” Hermione said, huffing. “Anyway, if I could guess, Malfoy’s brain is probably full of toxic thought patterns that form thoughts like
“Why does everything have to be so fucked up?” Harry asked, frustrated.
“Oh,” Draco said, sounding a bit anxious.
“Firewhisky, obviously. But I think there isn’t left any,” Draco said, looking at the Muggle spirits suspiciously.
. If there happens something bad during your childhood or adolescence, like you’re for example physically or mentally abused at home or you’re bullied at school, your brain creates a lot of toxic thought patterns that form thoughts such as
“I’m not sure,” Ginny said, sighing. “He’s still in France, trying to make his mother and his mother’s newest husband come back. I don’t get why his mother is so scared of coming back. There’s no way they’d be thrown into Azkaban.”
“Using my tactics against me, are you, Potter?”
Eventually, Harry felt his limbs gone so numb he could hardly move them, and his teeth were chattering so wildly he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. He headed towards the ground and saw Malfoy following right after him.
“Oh!” Ron exclaimed suddenly. “I just realized you told us quite often you were hanging out with Ginny during the fifth and sixth year. Sometimes you didn’t even sleep in our dormitory.”
“No, come in,” Harry said, sounding a bit too eager.
“Grimmauld Place’s house-elf.”
“Don’t. You start to sound like a broken record, or how did that saying go,” Draco said, smiling indulgently. “That’s actually one of the reasons I fell in love with you.”
“Fine, thank you so much for asking,” Draco answered coolly, acting to scrutinise his nails. “We had a very pleasant night.”
“Yeah, thanks, I’ll try to keep that in mind,” Harry muttered. Though Ginny might be right, the phone was rather big, with an antenna and all, so it definitely was visible to everyone who just happened to glance at him briefly.
“I am taking this seriously! It’s just quite a lot to take in to realize abruptly your best friend has been shagging the ferret for two years and you’ve been completely clueless about it.”
“It’s an ancient pureblood tradition to shut someone out from the family and the pureblood society in general. The family organizes a funeral, with flowers, pastries and everything, for the person who is going to be shut out,” Hermione explained. “When the ritual is over, you’re basically dead to them.”
Harry shrugged. “Just called me a selfish prat, nothing out of the ordinary,” Harry said and hesitated before continuing. “Look, I get it if you want to end this. Snape did have a point there, I’m setting you in danger.”
Harry felt really bad for his friend. He took Hermione’s hand between his own hands and looked straight into Hermione’s eyes. “I know you know their opinions are utter nonsense, but I still want to emphasize how amazing you are. You’re one of the best people in my life, I couldn’t make it without you,” Harry said, meaning every word. “You’ve said to me hundreds of times I can always talk to you when I feel like it. I want you to do the same. I wish I had known about all this much earlier.”
“I don’t
“Why do you think Draco took the Mark?”
“Bloody hell, Harry,” Ron said, eyes wide. “Every time you told us you were hanging out with Ginny, you were shagging Malfoy instead. For two bloody years.”
Harry gasped sharply. “I – I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said, sounding so untruthful even a troll could tell he was lying. Of course, Malfoy had gossiped to the Slytherins, it had all been just one big Slytherin scheme, and now they were going to, what, blackmail Harry?
“So, who exactly is this Dobby the house-elf?” Zabini asked as he ate blueberry tart, looking content.
“You know, he’s not a bad person. He never tortured anyone at Hogwarts. Actually, he always tried to help us instead, both he and Blaise.”
“How long, Harry?” Hermione asked, sounding suddenly quite hurt and disappointed.
Three weeks. That was how long a human being could survive without food. At least he was still given water every now and then, so if he died for some reason before the day of his execution, it would surely be because of the hunger. At first, Draco had tried to count the days when he didn’t get food, but he had given up trying quite quickly as the darkness of the cell had made him lose the sense of time already during the first couple of days. Hours, days, and weeks melted happily into each other, and he hadn’t had a clue for a long time when it was supposed to be day and when night. One of the few signs that somehow told him about the time passing was his stomach that had rambled and cramped because of hunger at first, and that had gradually got used to the lack of food so that he had nowadays difficulties to keep in the rare meals that the oh-so-noble and benevolent new Ministry allowed him to have in all its mercy.
“Neither did I,” Harry said, feeling a bit envious as he hadn’t gotten to see Teddy at all after summer.
Harry watched dazed Malfoy’s back as he walked away. This was the second time Harry had seen the Slytherin behaving out of character, which made Harry sure he hadn’t just imagined the first time. What made the git react like that always when Harry touched him abruptly? How was it even possible that Malfoy was able to show some bare and humanlike emotions?
Suddenly, the door Draco had been leaning against opened, and he was about to fall completely sprawled on the floor.
“Oh. Okay,” Harry muttered, feeling surprisingly somewhat disappointed.
“How did you realize you prefer blokes?”
“Yes,” Blaise said. “It’s not like they would’ve confided with me. I just knew about Draco’s feelings for Harry and noticed there had happened something between the two of them at the beginning of autumn, so I decided to nudge them in the right direction.”
“Draco, stop!” Harry said as he finally reached Draco right in front of the front door and placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Please.”
“I came to take you away from here.”
,” Potter said, waving his wand before the Auror had the time to finish the sentence. “
Harry felt his face turning red despite the cold air. “Erm, wet?”
“Draco, I’m sorry. Fuck, I hadn’t even –” Harry said, but Draco cut him short.
“What do you mean by ‘chose over you’?” Ron asked, lifting his eyebrow questioningly.
“Right. So,” Ginny said as they sat down on the stairs, side by side so close to each other that Ginny's thigh came to rest against Harry’s. “How are you doing? I mean, for real?”
of all people would be pure torture. Not that he and Draco would’ve promised Snape to break up, but Harry still didn’t like the idea of Snape poking around his brain and possibly seeing something too… private.
and the resulting accidental Horcrux that had created the connection between him and Voldemort. As far as Harry knew, Malfoy hardly had ever had anything to do with any kind of Horcruxes, and even if he had, it would definitely have nothing to do with Harry, so it was completely absurd to even think if there was a possibility that he and Malfoy shared some kind of connection.
“Fancy seeing you here,” Harry heard Draco Malfoy’s familiar voice drawling suddenly next to him. Harry startled and spilt water all over the table.
Harry read through the messages, thrice. How could he have forgotten about the phone? Draco had been in his mind multiple times a day, but he just hadn’t remembered the existence of their phones. He had been too fixated on the idea of him being Voldemort’s puppet he hadn’t even thought someone would be worried about him.
“Oh yes, he did. Or I rather found him, wanted to hear all about your little chat,” Zabini said.
“Fine. Though it was a bit weird, the house felt so empty.”
Jeg elsker deg = I love you
Harry nodded. “She helped me a bit, covered up for me and stuff.”
Harry crawled quickly off Draco, and Draco stood up immediately and started to pace towards the castle without saying a word to anyone.
“It was my goal, glad to hear I succeeded.”
“Just come. Please,” Harry said, pleading.
“Hi, Potter,” Malfoy said awkwardly.
“Just let it out, it’ll help,” Andromeda said, patting his arm comfortingly. “Would you like to have some more tea?”
When Draco didn’t make a gesture to follow Harry’s suit, Harry went cautiously to stand in front of Draco and took slowly off his scarf and robes. He waited for a moment, and when Draco didn’t seem to protest, he went on.
“Don’t you think I won’t get you for this, Potter. I might not be able to dock any points from your oh-so-dear Gryffindor yet, but just wait until we get to school” Malfoy drawled threateningly and straightened his robes before leaving, Grabbe and Goyle following on his heels.
“So, you think Malfoy’s brain has created those, erm, toxic thought patterns?”
“You feel the same,” Harry murmured absentmindedly against Draco’s lips as he ran his hands along Draco’s chest.
“Harry, you’re unbelievable,” Ginny said, shaking her head. “Who else knows?”
!” Hermione exclaimed excitedly.
The day Draco Malfoy had waited impatiently for months had finally come. It was a beautiful winter day and the first snow glistened like millions of small diamonds everywhere around the castle in the bright moonlight. Draco wouldn't usually prefer to celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts instead of his home, Malfoy Manor, but this year was different in many ways. First of all, the whole castle was decorated rather decently for once. Not that Draco would admit it after years of loud complaint about the staffs' lack of style in festivity decorations. And in any case, Hogwarts could never be as luxurious as the Manor, of course. Secondly, all the students from all the four Houses, at least all those above the third class, had decided to stay at school to take part in the Yule Ball. It wasn't a Christmas feast like the ones at school all the other years for those pitiful students who didn't have a family to celebrate Christmas with. No, this was something that happened so rarely it was truly an honour to be one of those to take part in it. Besides, the Ball was not only for the Hogwarts students but also for the international visitors, even for a couple of famous ones, who were staying at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament. All that being said, Draco just couldn't miss the chance to make an impact on all the important international students or to brag with his dancing skills and fine and expensive taste in dress robes.
When Draco deepened the kiss, biting Harry lower lip and making it bleed, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Draco pushed Harry to lay down on the bed and followed right after him, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Draco whispered fervently he wanted to feel Harry inside him, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Harry pushed into Draco, making both of them moan, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. Not even after, when they were both breathing heavily and feeling their bodies tired and sweaty, Harry couldn’t think about anything else than Draco.
Draco looked at him and gulped. “Blaise says the same.”
“Yes.”
On Saturday Harry said his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, sniffling and coughing slightly just in case, before heading to the kitchens to get the picnic basket and then rushing excitedly to the seventh floor. He put his Invisibility Cloak on and waited in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. It’d be much easier and less risky to just wait for Draco inside the Room, but as this was Draco’s first time in the Room, Harry had to explain to him how to get in there.
Draco pressed his lips into a thin line but looked still stubbornly Snape in the eye.
“Harry, you must explain me a bit better if you want me to be able to be in the same room with that brat.”
“I suppose my company is no longer needed here, so I’ll leave you to it. See you later, Draco,” Zabini said and
The sensation ended always as quickly as it had begun, and Draco's feet would probably have slipped as they arrived at their new destination if Potter hadn't held him so tightly.
“Erm, yes, I’m well aware,” Harry said awkwardly. “Though I’d appreciate it if you could keep this as a secret.”
Ginny snorted. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But Norwegian, can Malfoy really speak it?”
Or finish my song
“Very well, then,” Narcissa said slowly. “I’ll see you at home,” she said, giving Draco one more indecipherable look before turning around and leaving Draco alone in the cell.
Harry was quite sure his friends had noticed his withdrawal, but his time they didn’t ask anything. Harry didn’t know if it was thanks to his spectacular acting skills or because they knew there was a lot on his plate anyway. As if homework, detentions, gossiping and worry for Hagrid weren’t enough, now Harry and Ron had to worry for the future of their Quidditch team as well.
Harry didn’t shout at Malfoy to try to make him stop and explain. Actually, Harry had quite a job to make his own body obey him before he was able to start walking slowly towards the Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt emotionally so overwhelmed he didn’t actually feel anything at all. It was a strange sensation, as if someone else possessed Harry’s body and made him walk forward, step by step. Even the sharp pain on Harry’s forehead and hand couldn’t pierce the coma-like state he had drowned in.
“I don’t think she even has to try. I think she actually thinks you’re rather nice,” Harry said.
“I could ask if Fred and George came up with something. Ferret would be quite a good test subject for some new product,” Ron said, grinning.
“Maybe it’s for the best if I get straight to the point,” Blaise said firmly. “I know about you and Draco.”
Because Draco knew now his values had changed a lot over the past months. The things that had seemed to be important a year ago felt now something so trivial, and he found it every day harder and harder to see everyone and everything through the pureblood hierarchy. Even his priorities had gone through some drastic changes, and somehow inexplicably the Boy Who Lived had become the centre of his world.
“Where did you disappear yesterday?” Harry asked, slumping on the couch next to her.
much between us,” Harry said, picking his cuticles.
“But… What about you both snickering at me in the Great Hall the other day?” Malfoy asked, still seemingly suspicious. He looked Harry straight in the eye as if trying to find some answers in Harry’s eyes.
“Seriously? Is that what you really think I’ve been up to? You really think we shouldn’t prepare ourselves at all for Voldemort and the Death Eaters?” Harry asked incredulously.
Draco gave a short, slightly hysterical laugh. “I’ve been risking it for months already.”
“Well, yeah,” Draco said, shrugging. “And I can’t really go to Diagon Alley. Not after… You know.”
stop worrying about you as long as I live,” she snapped, the corner of her mouth twitching upwards.
Suddenly, Draco could hear weird rattling noise behind his cell door, which made him jolt completely awake. Oh well, it seemed like they had decided to feed him before tomorrow after all. In vain, they already knew that Draco would not be able to eat anything.
“So, you’re not going to tell me to whom you’re giving this?”
“But you haven’t killed anyone yet,” Myrtle tried to comfort Draco.
“Good, that’s settled then,” Ginny said cheerily, turning around and leading the whole group out of the common room.
Oh but wait, he couldn’t possibly be floating.
“Er, you too,” Harry muttered, a bit confused. He glanced questioningly at Draco, who just shrugged.
For a moment, Harry didn’t say anything. He blinked his eyes, trying to focus on his surroundings.
“Nah, probably just partly. I think it has more to do with Ginny being his little sister, I mean, he kind of freaked out even when you were seeing Michael, remember?” Harry said, turning his gaze to Ginny.
“Next time I’ll show you the place I was talking about. We’re both going to catch a cold if we go on like this,” Harry said, tucking a strand of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “Thought maybe we could stay behind when everyone else goes to Hogsmeade on Saturday? At least all my friends are going, I could just say I’m feeling a bit sick or something.”
Harry smiled and took Draco’s hand to lead him out of the kitchen. “Yes. C’mon, let’s not keep Molly waiting and thinking there was something wrong with her knitting skills.”
“Well, that admittedly sounds a bit weird,” Ron said, frowning. “Malfoy’s mother wouldn’t insist Snape making an Unbreakable Vow if she didn’t think Malfoy would be in a really serious danger.”
“That was really nice of you.”
“Harry, why haven’t you come to say hello to me?” Andromeda asked abruptly, making both Harry and Draco startle a little. They had both been so deep in their conversation they hadn’t noticed when the older woman had come outside.
Harry just rolled his eyes. “If you really must know, I had detention,” Harry said coldly and started to stalk towards the Gryffindor Tower. He was feeling so tired that even Malfoy couldn’t rile him up this time. Only Malfoy didn’t seem to let him go that easily.
As Harry was still talking with Ron and Hermione, Draco was on the seventh floor in front of the Room of Requirement, trying desperately to come up with how to get in. The weekend had been, well, trying, to put it mildly. Draco didn’t actually know at all what to think about Harry and about all the mixed signals Harry was sending to him. On the one hand, Draco didn’t remember the last time when he had felt so utterly happy and relaxed as when he had been laying on Harry’s lap, feeling the warmth of Harry’s body and Harry’s fingers buried in his hair. But on the other hand, Draco knew, or actually had known all along, that Harry didn’t want anything more than friendship to do with him. And that had hurt so much, especially when Harry had left from Andromeda’s and Draco had had more time to think about the whole situation. He knew he was being stupid, and he shouldn’t be just crying his life away, pining for Harry. He needed some sort of closure so that his mind could finally start letting go.
“Of course,” Draco said and kissed Harry’s forehead.
Draco snorted. “Hvis du sier det så.”
“Right. Firefighters, what a stupid word,” Draco muttered.
“You must be an absolute horror. Or, well, that I knew already. But honestly Potter, the autumn has hardly started,” Malfoy said, still in a light and carefree voice.
“C’mon, let’s go back,” Harry said, starting to pull Draco towards the shore.
“Let him rant, he’ll calm down eventually,” Draco said lightly. “I’m more surprised about my mother. Couldn’t have thought that of her, sounds like she was some kind of a rebel or something.”
“You haven’t eaten anything today,” Harry tried again, but the expression on Draco’s face didn’t show the slightest change.
Harry chuckled. “Probably not. But seriously, do you think we could be like Blaise and Ginny, one day?”
“Next year we’ll know to buy you only ribbons and wrapping paper,” Draco said, smiling and ruffling the child’s hair as he watched him playing with one of the ribbons, excitement gleaming in his eyes and all his new toys abandoned aside.
“He’s not eating,” Harry said without thinking before he opened his mouth.
“Tell me what’s wrong! I could help you!” Myrtle said in a high-pitched voice, hovering over the cubicles.
“Wait, what mystery boy? Why don’t
“How was it to kiss a girl?”
“Luna, Gin, and Ollivander are going to testify for him, and you guys are going to be there, too. You were there every time I saw Malfoy last year, you know just as much as I do,” Harry said, putting his glass of Molly’s homemade strawberry juice on the table rather violently.
--*--*--*--*--
“That’s fine, we’ll get it for you,” Hermione said.
Andromeda sighed heavily. “I know you two have your history,” she began, and Harry’s eyes snapped at her, alarmed. “Yes, I know about you two. Draco told me when he tried to explain why he thought it wouldn’t be a good idea you two would be in my house at the same time.”
“Don’t even try to deny it,” Hermione said, cutting Harry short. “You miss him.”
“A bit shitty weather, otherwise fine,” Ron said, slumping on an armchair as Hermione sat down next to Harry on the couch. “Found some French Quidditch magazines with long articles about new Keeper moves. I must show them to you later, they look really cool!”
. Don’t you remember Malfoy was implying Hagrid would be messing with stuff too big for him? He clearly knew what Hagrid was doing,” Hermione said.
“Er, no. Ginny helped me.”
“Dere er alle litt dumme i hodet.”
to be someone he knew, how else would the person in question know to call him by his name?
Ron’s face turned red of fury, and he stepped forward, trying to grab a hold of Malfoy’s robes. Harry had just enough time to stop him by taking a firm grip on his friend’s shoulders.
“Ron had a huge fit when he heard about that. Hadn’t seen him that… emotional in a long time,” Harry said, trying to lighten the atmosphere.
The worst thing about the whole summer had probably been that he hadn’t been able to share his thoughts and worries with anyone, not even with Ron and Hermione. No one had informed him about Voldermort’s last moves at all, or actually nothing about the Wizarding world on the whole. Somehow Harry had felt just like before he even had known he was a wizard, as if Hogwarts had just been a very long and well-elaborated dream. He had felt so alone having been forced to live so much time just inside his own head without distractions or someone to listen to him. When he finally had been able to join his friends and Sirius, the feeling of loneliness and being cut off from his own world hadn’t really left him. Harry was even a little bit embarrassed about blowing up at his best friends so often these days, but he really had a hard time managing to handle the emotions that he had been bottling up for so long. Both Ron and Hermione behaved too understandingly towards Harry, watching him with pity and reserve in their eyes, which made Harry squirm with embarrassment every time he was alone.
Harry gulped. His throat felt suddenly dry and hoarse. “I don’t know what I could do anymore,” he said in a low voice. There was a long, oppressive silence after his words, and Harry felt his breath becoming fast more and more shallow. “Malfoy?” he cried, alarmed, being scared of being left alone in the middle of the mist.
“Draco,” Harry said in a low voice, trying to draw Draco’s attention back to him.
Harry closed his mouth so fast his teeth banged together painfully. “Er, eating snow, I s’pose,” Harry said, rubbing his jaw as Draco laughed at him so hard he had tears in the corners of his eyes.
Harry didn’t have time to finish what he was saying before he felt someone’s lips kissing his neck eagerly.
Harry touched his lips softly, still feeling Malfoy’s kiss ghosting on his mouth. He had no idea where the urge to touch Malfoy, kiss him again and try to know him better had suddenly come. Although, now that Harry thought again, there had always been some strange energy between him and Malfoy. Even though Malfoy was a true pain in the arse, Harry had still always noticed him, been so aware of his presence and felt some kind of pull towards him. Malfoy was attractive, even Harry could admit it by now.
Harry nodded, still avoiding his friends’ gazes.
“Well, actually, there’s a packet I should pick up. Ordered some Muggle stuff, and they couldn’t be delivered here, thanks to Umbridge and her Educational Degrees.”
at me,” Draco said, slicing now the treacle tart for both him and Harry.
"Why are we gossiping about Potter, didn't you see Granger? I didn't almost recognise her at all,” Blaise said hastily before Draco had time to react to Pansy's accusation.
Harry tried not to pay any attention to the Slytherin and started to walk more quickly.
After the mead incident, Harry didn’t know what to think about Draco and how to act around him. To be honest, it felt like some sort of a miracle they still managed to be together after all that had happened. In autumn it had felt like the things they weren’t able to share with each other were something that was itching under Harry’s skin, but it had been nothing so bad that would have made them drift completely away from one another. Now the earlier itch-like sensation had started to feel like a heavy weight on their shoulders, or like an elephant in the room; both Harry and Draco knew it existed, and the more time passed, the more difficult it became to try to ignore it.
“Aren’t we two a bit sad cases,” Draco said, sighing. “It’s summer and we’re having holidays but still both of us would prefer about a hundred times more being at school instead.”
--*--*--*--*--
“You and Draco. That you’re an item,” Ginny said curtly.
“Draco, it was better this way. You know it was,” Snape said, his voice sounding uncharacteristically sympathetic.
Draco turned his gaze to Harry’s, looking confused. “How do you know I had said that before?”
“I – I think I’ve a band-aid. In my bag,” Harry stammered, feeling his face flush.
“Zabini seems to be actually quite nice,” Hermione said.
Harry smiled and nuzzled Draco’s cheek. “No, you most definitely are not.”
“You want to take a swig?” Harry asked, offering the bottle of firewhisky to Draco.
“No, I… I don’t know what happened. I mean, you knew I couldn’t act any differently towards you.”
Dobby straightened his back but looked still seemingly suspiciously at Draco. “Is there something Dobby can help master Draco Malfoy with, sir?”
“Erm, hi, Malfoy,” Harry answered, even more awkwardly if possible.
Harry felt his heart jumping and something warm spreading in his chest as he heard Draco’s words. “I’m happy to hear that because I’m hardly letting you go, either,” Harry said and kissed fondly Draco’s forehead.
“She’s still angry with you?”
“Am not,” Draco said, deadpan. “It’s really charming to see how you always live so wholeheartedly.”
“Of course, you did,” Ron muttered a bit bitterly. “But Harry, what about Cho? And all the girls we’ve been talking about in our dormito –
The Auror turned on his heels and set out to walk along the corridor in the direction he had just come from. Draco and Potter started to follow him cautiously, Potter still squeezing Draco protectively against himself.
“I’ve already told you, I’m not going,” Harry said stubbornly, sitting in the garden at the Burrow and discussing with Ron and Hermione who were both looking rather frustrated at this point.
to eat breakfast before his visit! Kreacher has heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day for the wizards,” Kreacher said, sounding somewhat insulted.
Hermione patted Harry’s thigh empathetically. “You don’t have to remember all this instantly, you can always ask me if you feel like it. And I’d bet you’ll become more familiar with all this theoretical stuff through your own therapy. One of the main purposes of the therapy is trying to get rid of one’s toxic thoughts, after all.”
“Are we having guests?” Draco asked, nonplussed, as he viewed the robes, but his mother had already left the room.
“A friend of mine found him wandering completely lost in the Muggle London so I took him in.”
Dudley considered his options for a moment. He knew Harry wouldn’t probably use the wand, but he could never be one-hundred percent sure, so he decided to turn on his heel and walk grumbling out of the room.
“We’re not together anymore,” Ginny said matter-of-factly.
“Look at me,” Harry said, taking hold of Draco’s chin and turning his face towards Harry’s. “What are you thinking?” Harry asked, searching for some kind of an answer in Draco’s eyes. Even without his glasses, Harry could see Draco’s eyes were storming, full of anxiousness and fear.
fall.”
After just taking a couple of deep breaths and lying in his bed for a while, eyes shut tight, Harry had to admit he wouldn’t be able to fall asleep again and he definitely wouldn’t be getting rid of the headache anytime soon, so he rolled to his side, opened his eyes, and started to look for his glasses and his wand. Once Harry had put his glasses on and found his wand, he summoned a bottle of hangover potion, that instead of being in his trunk was under his bed for some reason. He opened the bottle with slightly shaking hands and drank its content at one draught.
Harry chuckled. “If you had told me four years ago I’d willingly be travelling to Norway with you, I would’ve said the same.”
“And how do
Draco looked at both his mother and father in turns, horrified. “You can’t be serious,” he said, not knowing if he should laugh or cry. The situation felt so unrealistic, it was completely mental.
“Erm, right,” Harry said, feeling utterly awkward.
“Erm, right.”
For a moment, there were vague clicking and squeaking noises before the cell’s heavy wooden door began to open very, very slowly, as if the intruder had hesitated whether they really wanted to come in or not.
It wasn’t an easy task to find them after making his way through the crowd, and when Harry finally heard their voices in an empty classroom, he was sure he had already missed some essential parts of their conversation.
“Now you’re saying it in English?” Harry asked, smiling lopsidedly.
“That sounds more like it,” Ginny said, smiling widely. “Answer him. He must be heartbroken, not hearing from you for days.”
“Yes,” Draco said, smiling and letting Harry pull him to another kiss.
“I got the list some weeks ago, but I don’t think I can get them,” Draco muttered.
“You’re planning on getting me drunk?”
Potter helped Draco to stand up and step out of the boat. “
Suddenly, Malfoy pulled away shocked, as if he hadn’t realized before what he was doing and with whom.
“Doesn’t sound really fair to Parkinson.”
Hermione patted Harry’s hand and smiled. “So, do you have plans for today?” she asked both Ron and Harry, changing the topic to a safer one.
“We all can do different things and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. They don’t make us any more or any less worthy compared to other people. It’s only human,” Harry said. “You know, Muggles have justified genocides and wars by the fear of different ethnicities, skin colours and religions.”
a prat.”
“Is it okay if we come in?” Ginny asked, not letting go of Harry’s arm.
“No, I meant more like… Slytherin kind of pureblood system. You know, huge manors, blood purity, ancient traditions, that kind of stuff.”
. I mean, all that winking and speaking like an aristocrat. It makes me a bit nervous.”
“Sounds good to me. Shall I ask Blaise to come along?”
Draco blinked his eyes, confused. “Why on Earth would the Weasleys want to invite me to their home?”
After taking some distance to the game Ginny and Ron were playing, Harry and Draco could still hear Ginny’s playful banter and Ron’s occasional raging ringing in their ears, but their eyes were either scrutinising the pitch hawk-like or on each other as they tried to see any signs of the other one possibly having noticed the snitch.
Harry let out a dry laugh. “Am not. Just learned a bit at the Muggle school I used to go before Hogwarts and have talked a lot with Hermione. She’s really the one with the brain.”
Harry took his phone from the pocket and regarded the screen. There were, indeed, eleven new messages, all from Draco. As if Harry had anyone else’s number on the phone.
“I don’t condone violence, but I don’t believe Draco did it on purpose,” Blaise said. “Besides, I wasn’t talking about physical ways to hurt, anyway.”
of you. But I’ll try not to… express it so much?”
Before Harry had time to register what was happening, they both had lost their t-shirts and pants and were now a tangle of limbs, as they both wanted to have as much skin-to-skin contact as humanly possible. The night consisted of new, thrilling sensations as they learned to know each other in ways Harry had only dared to dream of. Even though everything they did was new and a bit clumsy, it still felt like their bodies fitted perfectly together, as if they were somehow made to each other. Almost all thoughts had left Harry’s head, and the only thing he could think about was the desire to learn to know every inch of Draco’s body and to see what made Draco moan and gasp with pleasure. He wanted nothing more than to make Draco feel as amazing as he was feeling himself.
,” Granger said. “
“Harry!” Ron exclaimed happily, looking like he had already had a few cups of whatever Seamus had poured him.
“Ron, you’re
“I’m quite sure I kissed him. Or well, completely sure, I think,” Harry repeated.
to let Potter get any closer. If being completely objective about the overall picture of the situation, Draco was still just a simple pawn to Potter who tried to get his will through, no matter how nice and concerned Potter acted towards him. And even being in a better place than Azkaban didn’t really matter in the end, because Draco was still very much a prisoner. He couldn’t leave the house or he’d certainly end up dead in a matter of minutes, and he wasn’t sure if there could ever be a normal life for him, a life without hiding. Everything seemed so uncertain, foggy, and messy that Draco couldn’t tell if the escape from Azkaban had truly brought any new hope to his future. Probably not, at least not as long as the Dark Mark slithered on his skin.
“Didn’t know you cared about fairness,” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, straddling him and holding his hands tightly against the floor so that Harry had no chance to escape. “Let’s see who’s going to laugh now,” Draco said, trying to get hold of both Harry’s hands at the same time with only one hand.
“The truth,” Ginny said simply. “Just tell him honestly why you kissed him and why you pushed him away.”
“It’s a vow you can’t break, no matter what,” Hermione said, cutting in. “If you make un Unbreakable Vow and break it, you die.”
“Don’t you fucking dare to touch me,” Harry snarled and looked at Draco with flaming eyes.
Draco smacked Harry’s head lightly. “You git, I was trying to have a serious conversation.”
“No, this isn’t a joke. And I’m completely fine, thank you,” Harry said a bit sullenly.
Malfoy snapped his eyes at Harry. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, Potter,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s hand and trying to get it far enough from the ingredients. “Let me see it.”
“No one’s going to know,” Harry said, trying to sound confident.
“I don’t think I’m coming,” Harry said and flushed. He felt all too transparent.
“But once we do it, we have to plan it really carefully,” Draco said, with a serious tone. “You know we can’t just be mortal enemies one day and snog each other senseless all around the castle the next?”
”Oh, well,” Molly said slowly. “I can see why you’re scared. I don’t obviously know all the details, but it’s so unfair and wrong what happened to both of you. No kid should have to go through something like that,” she continued. “However, the things are different now. Do you really think Draco would leave you this time?”
“I’ll see what I can do,” Draco said, laughing softly and kissing Harry’s cheek before leaving.
“Couldn’t wait until the weekend to see you,” Draco said in between the kisses as he slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt.
It took a couple of seconds for Malfoy to gather himself before he rushed back to Harry’s side. “How dare you to point your wand at me you bastard. I told you not to touch me. Do I have to spell it for you, so your little brain gets it? DO. NOT. TOUCH. ME,” Malfoy said, fuming now on Harry’s side.
Ginny tried to smile weakly at Hermione as she poured the rest of the juice into her glass.
“I – What?” Harry asked, baffled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t be stupid, of course not,” Draco snapped and covered his mouth quickly with his hand, looking like he had already revealed too much information.
“C’moon now, let’s go and send some love messages to your boyfriend,” Ginny said cheerfully, hooking her arm through Harry’s.
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco spat. “Besides, how can you be judging me all the while you’ve been busying yourself with your little Defense club?”
Mikä on tää tunne
Draco considered Harry for a moment, looking deep into his eyes. “I want to be with you, but there are things I cannot tell you. Do you think you can live with that?”
“You don’t know what you’re talking about, you have no idea what I’ve done,” Draco said, tears starting to stream slowly down his face. “I let those Death Eaters into the castle. I had been working on making them a passageway for the whole year. Behind your back.”
“Draco,” Lucius’s voice called him. “Sit down.”
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, already knowing the answer. This bit of information made his already grumpy mood to sink even more. He had had difficulties to accept that he hadn’t been chosen as a Gryffindor prefect while both of his best friends had, and now with Malfoy being a prefect, it all felt like a hundred times worse.
Draco's mouth opened slightly in shock. Harry Potter had just used an unforgivable curse. A
Suddenly, someone grabbed his right arm and started to drag him quickly and determinedly away from the battle area where the Order members were trying to fight against the escaping Death Eaters. The person who was pulling Draco with him was invisible, and even through the haze in his brain, Draco knew what that meant. Harry had still come for him.
“Do you know how they work? Can you turn them on?” Harry asked, ignoring Ginny’s question.
--*--*--*--*--
“Draco. Potter. My office. Now,” Snape said, voice full of venom.
“About school and stuff,” Andromeda repeated slowly. “Are you nervous about going back to Hogwarts?”
When the door creaked open at last, Harry leapt immediately to his feet.
“A bit,” Draco said, shrugging.
“Oh, Potter, you should’ve seen Draco’s collection of the cards with your pictures,” Blaise said, snickering. “And after that Draco still couldn’t figure out how on Earth I realized he had a thing for you.”
Later that night, back in their hotel room, Harry and Draco laid on the bed, Harry already almost asleep whereas Draco was staring at the ceiling, caressing Harry’s bare stomach absentmindedly.
“What’s that?” Ginny asked, looking at the ring curiously. Harry gave it to her and started to read the letter instead.
When the War ended, all the surviving Death Eaters were locked in Azkaban to wait for the trials. The trials, that never came. It was only a week since the War had ended when the Wizengamot decided, both on its members’ as well as almost the whole light side’s behalf, that every single person who bore the Dark Mark would be sentenced straight to death without trials as
“No, Harry, of course not! It’s a really good thing!” Hermione hurried to say.
“This is why you didn’t answer my messages?”
“Of course. Don’t take me too seriously, I’m only joking. It’s much better to be here now that the house is full of people,” Sirius said with a warm tone in his voice. “Let’s talk more later, okay?”
“I still don’t accept the way you treated me and other students, but now that I know better what kind of things you’ve been struggling with, I want to help if I only can. And Harry fell in love with you, and Ginny has told thousand times you’re not a bad person, so I have a hunch there’s got to be more to you than the Draco who’s been calling me Mudblood. I hope you’ll prove me right,” Granger said. “Besides, if you’re calling yourself a prat because of your behaviour, to me it already is an indication that you know how wrong you did,” she went on, giving Draco a small smile.
Harry sighed and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I know you didn’t want to hurt me,” Harry said. It was strange how fast things could change. It was only two months ago Harry would have been sure the Slytherin stood firmly behind his words, wanting to hurt Harry as badly as possible.
Harry smiled vaguely as he let the exhaustion take over his body and drag him into a somewhat restless sleep. His evening had definitely taken an unexpected turn of events, but not necessarily in a bad way. Maybe. He hummed a little. Who would’ve guessed the first time Harry would feel like an ordinary young man would be when he was utterly wasted at a party, having Draco Malfoy sleeping in his arms?
Harry stared at her, nonplussed. “You know about it?”
obtuse. Maybe I could’ve actually learned something if Professor Dumbledore had taught me instead,” Harry snapped.
“So, coffee or tea?” Andromeda asked, waving Harry to follow her into the kitchen.
Hermione cast a worried glance at Harry. She had been even more worried about him than usually after his, let’s say a little bit difficult, summer and the outbursts after that. “No, I’m really okay, just a little bit tired, that’s all. Erm, so how did it go for you two?” Harry hurried to say, trying to get the attention away from himself.
“No, it doesn’t,” Draco said, turning his eyes to Harry. “Some people might feel their loved ones’ presence when they look at the starry sky or listen to a flowing river. Where else would we go if not somewhere in nature? It’s the most peaceful place I can think of.”
“Well, he would’ve been a statistical rarity if he had been able to do that,” Hermione said. “I think it was good he had you, Blaise and Ginny, I’m sure you three were of a lot of help to him. But to have been able to free himself from his parents’ control, Malfoy would’ve needed much, much more help and support. A mind healer, a supportive adult outside of the group who could’ve taken care of him, and more connections outside of the pureblood circles.”
“Then stop talking and just kiss me, you git,” Draco said, smiling and pulling Harry back into a long, tender kiss.
“Draco,” Harry whispered back and kissed Draco gently. “You know, I might have a place in mind. For us to meet, I mean,” Harry said, breaking the kiss but leaving his forehead against Draco’s.
“That I can do,” Harry said, feeling somewhat relieved as he turned his eyes to Hermione.
Hey love, tell me
“Dunno, probably just going to stay at Grimmauld Place,” Harry said. As all the Death Eater trials were over by now, there wasn’t much to do. Or, well, of course there
“And here you go,” Seamus said, handing Harry a cup.
“Oh? Hope you’re not getting used to me, too.”
“Oh,” Harry said, having suddenly a bad conscience as he hadn’t bought anything for Draco. “I’m sorry, I didn’t have anything for you on –”
“– okay.”
“That sounds serious.”
Despite the unpleasant meeting with Scrimgeour, Harry’s mood remained otherwise quite good throughout the holidays. The main reason for that was probably Draco, who sent him at least a couple of messages every single day. Harry had made Draco promise him he would keep in touch in order to avoid last summer’s rather catastrophic ending, and Draco had clearly thought along the same lines. Hearing from Draco every day made Harry believe that at least nothing bad had happened and that Draco and his mother must be safe, even at the Death-Eater-filled Manor.
Draco snorted. “We’d have ruined him, he wouldn’t have lasted a day.”
“You couldn’t have done anything before Grabbe and Goyle would have beaten you up.”
“No, they’re not.”
“On Friday, I think. Dumbledore sent me a message where he told me he’ll pick me up then.”
“I can’t tell you,” Draco whispered, looking anguished.
“Er, no. Potions have never really been my strength,” Harry said and grimaced. As if Malfoy didn’t know the lack of his potions skills.
“Great Aunt Walburga…” Draco muttered.
“Darling,” Draco whispered, kissing Harry’s forehead and rubbing his back soothingly.
“Is it because you don’t get to play this year? Harry, it’s going to get better, maybe McGonagall could talk to Umbridge,” Hermione said, tentatively.
Harry tried to smile at Hermione, but the look on his face looked probably more like a forced grimace than a smile. “Thanks.”
Lucius stood up, the chair creaking against the floor. He walked to the cake, cut three slices, and placed them in his, Draco’s and Narcissa’s plates.
he believed in things like destiny, he would be sure he and Harry would be meant for each other. How could they have come over their obstacles otherwise? Or how could it feel so good and right to be with Harry if it wasn’t meant to be? Maybe some god or the universe had made Harry for him and him for Harry, making Harry his and him Harry’s.
“Who were you talking to?”
“Yeah?”
“Erm, Harry?” Draco said uncertainly, squirming a little. “I’m so sorry for the quarrel, I never wanted –”
“Here it is!” Harry exclaimed excitedly as he hoisted the bottle of Ogden’s and… a hat? “Oh.”
“But can you trust him? You know his family. And Malfoy has never been really nice to you. Actually, to none of us.”
“Now that that’s settled, was there something else still bothering you?”
Harry knew he couldn’t go on like this, not for long or he would burst out. But there was too much on his mind as it was, and it felt impossible and scary even to consider letting his emotions loose
“I won’t go back. I mean, they wouldn’t even take me back, not after the spectacle they organized for me.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “And how exactly do you think you can make me laugh?”
Sometimes, Draco still had to pinch himself because he was rather sure he was only dreaming. How could he be there, Harry by his side, after everything that had happened? Draco wasn’t sure yet if he even deserved to love Harry or not, but at least he didn’t find himself as immensely bad a person as he once had done. Now he understood much better that he hadn’t made his sixth year's choices because his soul would be black and unsavable; there had been much bigger forces steering his life back then, not letting him have control over himself almost at all.
necessary as they had started to make him feel even more anxious than he already was.
Malfoy led them to a spot under a group of maple trees, far away from the other guests. They sat down and leaned against the same tree trunk as Malfoy opened the bottle and offered it to Harry.
“Yeah, I don’t get why they didn’t tell even to us. We’re left outside all the time as if we were still some bloody kids,” Ron complained.
“How do you even know what Vikings sound like?” Harry asked.
” Potter asked.
“How were your holidays?” Harry asked. As fast as the question had left from his lips, he could feel Draco tensing.
He had already lost everything he had had. The future held nothing for him, no one wanted him here anymore.
“Erm, okay?” Potter said, sounding confused. “I mean, there’s a bathroom in your room,” he went on, pointing at the dark mahogany door on the left side of the door that led outside of the room.
Harry bit his lip, still feeling nervous. “Do you think my parents would've also been fine with this?” he asked the question that had been nagging in his head for a while now.
Draco’s mother’s case had been a much easier one because of her rather passive role during the War and thanks to Harry’s testimony. She had been ordered to stay at the Manor on the same conditions as his father, though her sentence was ordered to last
Harry felt dumbfounded. He had guessed it’d be somewhat uneasy to work with Malfoy, but he definitely hadn’t foreseen Malfoy to say something cordial, let alone to stammer almost worse than Harry himself. Something had clearly changed between them, and it seemed like neither of them knew how to act around the other anymore.
“I – I wanted to…,” Harry said stammering, not really knowing what to say. He cursed himself. He should have planned better what to say and not just spontaneously follow his urge to see Malfoy.
“Probably not. But just so you know, I’m not offering this stuff to every passer-by,” Malfoy said, shrugging and turning around. “You coming?” he asked and glanced Harry over his shoulder, his grey eyes twinkling and blond hair waving slightly.
“Thank you,” Draco said, giving Andromeda a small smile.
“I didn’t come here to tell you off or anything like that,” Harry said hastily, trying to make Draco relax a bit. “I just, um, wanted to apologize. About yesterday. I, erm, might’ve acted like a complete idiot. Or forget the word ‘might’. I
“Did Umbridge really ban you from playing Quidditch?” Draco asked, looking nervous. He did know how important flying and playing was to Harry.
“That’s alright,” Hermione said calmly. “Well, I don’t know this person, so I can’t say for sure, but I think he might be trying to protect himself by being nasty towards you. It’s quite natural, actually. When a human being feels they are in danger, they usually act based purely on their instincts, and one common way to act instinctively is to attack. When you’re gay, let alone a teen-aged gay, you may feel really exposed and vulnerable, and you might not be able to control how you vent your feelings. It doesn’t mean it’s okay if he’s being mean to you, but it may explain it somewhat. Maybe he’s afraid of letting people know who he really is, so he might be trying to hide his feelings.”
“Erm, yeah. Still felt a bit awkward, though,” Harry said. “Have you thought about telling anyone else?”
“What happened?” Harry asked, alarmed, when Hermione had finally reached him.
going to touch this thing again. Now, I chop, you stir.”
“And how would that be possible?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrow.
“Go and talk to him,” Ginny said, sounding worried. “Please. He’ll talk to you,” she went on as Blaise and Hermione joined them, looking at Draco’s receding back, bewildered.
“What is it with everybody trying to feed me all of a sudden?” Harry asked, both slightly annoyed and amused.
“It’s okay,” Harry said reassuringly. He had felt angry and anxious earlier for how Hermione had tried to press him, but those feelings had already melted away. Both of his friends had reacted so well he couldn’t feel anything else but gratitude and happiness. And, well, awkwardness as well, but it wouldn’t really leave him in this kind of conversations, now would it?
Draco blinked his eyes, confused. “And you would still want me to come to your side? After all I’ve done?” he asked feebly.
“Goodnight, boys,” Andromeda said, smiling at both of them before going upstairs.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, confused.
Dobby shook his. “Dobby has not seen Harry Potter in weeks, mister Draco, sir.”
“If you know what’s best for you, you leave me the fuck alone right now,” Harry said through his teeth, watching Malfoy straight into the eyes. And once again, Malfoy’s face changed, and Harry could see the new unguarded expression on it. It made the git seem all too exposed, all too human, which made Harry hesitate. Neither of them was breathing now, and Harry lowered slowly his wand. He studied Malfoy’s eyes for one more second before turning around and continuing walking.
So, as you may have noticed by now, I'm trying to follow the canon quite tightly (at least still at this point). I pondered for a long time if I should include Harry and Cho's kiss in this story or not, but somehow I could see quite clearly poor Harry ending up in a situation like this.
“You two are staying here over the night?” Blaise asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry turned his head to see Draco’s face, feeling confused. “What?”
“I’d watch my tongue if I were you,” Harry muttered, pretending to be annoyed, but the corner of his mouth was twitching that much it gave him away.
Harry gave Blaise a small smile. He had somehow started to feel strangely fond of the Slytherin despite all his teasing and name-calling.
“That sounds nice.”
“Quite poorly,” Draco answered coolly. “Look, how much I’d love to have a little chit-chat with you, I don’t really have time for it right now. So, if you didn’t have anything else –”
Harry’s friends continued complaining about Malfoy being a prefect as Harry sank back into his own thoughts. He couldn’t forget about the expression he was quite sure he had seen on Malfoy’s face for a fleeting moment. The bare anxiety and despair had made Malfoy look so vulnerable and exposed that it had caught Harry’s attention. Harry had seen many expressions on Malfoy’s face, but these were some new ones Harry couldn’t really place into the picture he had created of the Slytherin during their school years. Malfoy was always so aware of himself and what he gave out. The most typical expression, Malfoy’s trademark smirk, was the one Harry was most familiar with. In addition to that, Harry could recognize angriness when the git ranted about a lost Quidditch match, impatience when he snapped at Grabbe or Goyle, haughtiness when Muggle-borns or Half-bloods bypassed him on the corridors and fear when he confronted magical creatures he didn’t know how to respect. Just like Hippogriffs, for instance. But anxiety and despair? They were expressions beyond Malfoy’s normal scale. Having seen them made Harry feel somehow strange, even a bit queasy. To be able to see Malfoy vulnerable, if even just for a second, made Harry see Malfoy in a somewhat new light. The bastard had seemed to be… human. At first, Harry thought it might have been because Harry had caught Malfoy off guard by attacking him, but Harry abandoned the thought quite quickly. He couldn’t even count the times he had grabbed the git’s robes, and vice versa, but the reaction had never been like this. Malfoy would never drop his mask, not if there weren’t some really grave reasons behind it.
“We haven’t really talked about this,” Ginny said, sounding a bit sad as she gestured vaguely to herself and Harry with her hand.
“You haven’t told her about us?” Malfoy asked, sounding alarmed.
Now it was Harry’s turn to get tense. “What do you mean?”
Draco nodded absently, even though he knew Potter couldn't see him. He turned his gaze back to the sky and tried to distinguish whether the red spots remained at the same height or whether they were slowly coming down. He was so focused on following the red spots that he didn't even notice they had come to the shore of a small, deserted island before the boat thumped against the shore rocks, causing him to almost fall overboard.
as he had absolutely no idea what he wanted or how he felt. When had he even been supposed to have time to think about something like that? “Yeah, why not,” he grunted finally reluctantly as he couldn’t come up with any reasonable excuse to say no.
“Are you kidding me? Dad must’ve at least ten of these, though I don’t think I’ve seen this model,” Ginny said and took the other phone from the box. “Why have you bought mobile phones?”
“Yeah, and you can see much better than me as I’d be absolutely blind without glasses. Does that make you a better person?”
agreed to it, and Draco wouldn’t have been able to leave them. Not even if he somehow miraculously had found the courage to leap to the opposite side.
“Go on like this and you’ll soon be worse than mum,” Ginny said, grinning.
That year the Christmas holidays were a much more pleasant experience than a year ago, as this Christmas no one was in immediate danger of dying. In spite of the war, this year Harry and his friends’ holidays consisted mainly of Celestina Warbeck’s newest hits, some relationship drama, and meeting various Weasley family and Order members, which definitely made a nice change to school and all the war-related conversations. The only thing that Harry didn’t enjoy too much was Scrimgeour’s visit to the Burrow as he had decided to ask if Harry could show publicly his support for the Ministry. Harry was so full of the Ministry and had no trust in it after everything that had happened last year, so he had refused straightaway and just walked away, fuming.
Draco looked suddenly a bit hesitant. “I don’t know if it’s a good idea.”
“Harry, would you have some time to talk?” Ginny asked as she was picking up the dirty dishes from the table, making Harry feel suddenly utterly nervous. He had indeed prepared himself mentally for Ginny most likely wanting to talk with him, but the day had gone so smoothly so far Harry had already lulled himself into the belief he maybe wouldn’t need to talk about anything difficult or awkward that day after all.
“Shh,” Harry could hear Draco, who had apparently woken up by Harry’s gasp, hushing him. “It’s alright. Just look at me,” Draco said, putting his hands on Harry’s cheeks and turning Harry’s face gently towards his own. “Now, just breathe with me. In and out.”
But there was no way getting around the fact that by letting Potter save him, he might be able to save his mother. Potter was most likely right, even if Draco would never admit it to him. It was naive to think that after executing him, the wizarding community would all of a sudden get their happily ever after and just sing and dance hand in hand all around a flower meadow. They had already killed so many people completely wantonly, and their thirst for blood and revenge wouldn’t end to him.
Luckily, Draco didn’t have to stay there for a long time
Teddy’s hair hadn’t changed the colour at all, but it looked a bit messier, as some sort of a mix of Harry’s and Draco’s hair, whereas the colour of his eyes had turned from twinkling grey to deep bright green.
“Maybe not to you. But I’d bet Malfoy hasn’t said ‘I love you’ that many times in his life. Maybe he wanted to say it out loud but in a way you wouldn’t be able to understand. Confessing your feelings makes you vulnerable.”
had stuck up in Harry’s head making him feel somewhat confused. Now that Harry had started thinking about this, it wasn’t even the first time this subject came up in his head. For example, Harry knew that for some reason he had always noticed how other blokes looked like: what colour their eyes were, how their features were sharper and harsher than the girls’ and how the robes fit their flat chest and broad shoulders. On the contrary, Harry had hardly paid any attention to the girls, and his friends in the dormitory found him utterly oblivious every time they were having a long chat about everyone’s current crush. But Harry was pretty sure he hadn’t ever fancied Cedric or any other bloke, for that matter. Harry might have been… curious about some blokes, but definitely nothing more. And Cho was such a nice girl and Harry kind of fancied her, right? At least he hoped so, he didn’t really want his life to get any more complicated from that what it already was, thank you very much. Nevertheless, Harry didn’t really have time to concentrate on some kind of a love life when Voldemort was constantly looming in the background. Harry huffed bitterly at that thought. As if he had ever had a chance to enjoy something so mundane as being just a normal teenaged boy with a stormy hormone system.
“Alright,” Draco said, shrugging and taking Teddy from Andromeda before he followed Ginny back outside.
But Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry’s stupid comment. “Right. So, what if you pick up the ingredients while I prepare everything else?”
Draco felt relief spreading all over his body. Potter was many things, but he was never cruel. He wouldn’t tell Draco that his mother would be alive if she really wasn’t.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy answered, looking lost and desperate. “I should keep away from you but I don’t know if I can.”
“Nothing,” Draco said, avoiding Andromeda’s gaze. “Just couldn’t sleep.”
“Harry, you look happier today,” Hermione said, pouring pumpkin juice into her goblet at breakfast the next morning.
They both fell into silence, listening to the various birds singing all around them and feeling the sun playing on their skin. Harry felt much better than at the beginning of the day, and even the idea of the Dursleys didn’t make his mood go down. Maybe this summer wouldn’t be as bad as the previous ones.
“How would you know? You got sorted straight away, the Hat didn’t even touch your head.”
“And you think you can trust her?”
“Ugh, no, just the usual, waiting to get away from the Dursleys as soon as possible,” Harry said, groaning.
“I think you should tell him, too. I hate to keep this kind of secrets from either of you and, besides, it’d really make you feel better as well. I’m sure it’s safe to tell him.”
Harry pulled out the Marauder’s Map and started to run his finger over it, trying to find Draco. He was nowhere to be found, which could only mean Draco wasn’t at Hogwarts at all or he would be in the Room of Requirement. The latter option seemed much more plausible, so Harry took his Invisibility Cloak and Map and headed towards the seventh floor.
As Draco became aware of the disturbed image of himself and Potter dancing together, Draco started to feel the panic rising. Suddenly his throat was so tight he couldn't breathe properly anymore, and his heart raced, making him dizzy. This couldn't be happening, not to him. Draco had always been really good at ignoring all that kind of feelings he wasn't supposed to feel, and to feel attraction to Potter at any level was absolutely one of them. For some reason, Draco now found it impossible to get his deranged feelings to stay put. He had hidden his feelings for Potter for such a long time under the surface, that once they had gotten loose, they had started to explode almost violently making Draco feel like an utter wreck.
“Partly, yes,” Draco said, shrugging. “My father had already started speaking Norwegian to me, though.”
“You’d better go now. You’ve done enough for one day,” Harry snarled, and this time, Draco didn’t follow him.
“That’s quite common in our circles. I had to hide my relationship with my first boyfriend, who’s unfortunately my ex now as our relationship didn’t work out with me being in the closet. I’m glad you’ve been able to come over the obstacles,” Chris said, smiling at both Harry and Draco.
Harry laughed, throwing his clothes and other stuff in his trunk all around the room. “Yes, actually. But it’s kind of old news, we’ve been roommates since we were eleven, remember?” he said. “How’s Blaise?”
“Exactly. You got chosen to the team for a reason,” Hermione stated firmly. Ron still said nothing, but a small hint of a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.
Even though Harry no longer blamed Draco for leaving him, he still didn’t feel very comfortable with him, either. There was quite a mess in Harry’s head as on the one hand, he felt so happy and good and whole whenever he was with Draco, but on the other, he couldn’t ignore the feeling of anxiety that rose in him every time he let Draco come too close. Harry had probably been too young, stupid and naïve as he had once let Draco come into his vulnerability zone and trusted blindly that Draco wouldn’t hurt him no matter what, but he hadn’t understood at all how much the external factors could affect both of their decisions. And now Harry felt the idea of letting Draco come close to him again scary as there might be a risk Draco would leave him again, and he wasn’t sure if he could ever go through losing Draco again.
So, the seventh year followed basically the book's storyline with some slight modifications that are mentioned in this story. And Ginny and Harry never happened.
who I’m seeing?”
“Oh, stop it, Weasel. Trying to be a know-it-all doesn’t suit you,” Draco snapped.
"You know, according to proper etiquette, you should let your date be in front of you, not behind you trying to get a crappy glimpse of the scene behind your shoulders,” Pansy whined, jabbing Draco harshly in the middle of the back.
“Jeg elsker deg,” Draco whispered barely audibly.
“I can take care of myself,” Harry said, sounding a bit irritated.
“Fine,” Harry said quickly, shoving food into his mouth. He wasn’t really in the mood to talk about Draco any more that day.
“Erm, Molly asked if you, Andromeda and Teddy would like to celebrate Christmas with us,” Harry said apropos of nothing. “What do you think?”
But Harry didn’t let go. It oddly reminded him of the almost exactly similar situation nearly a year ago when Draco had made Harry show him his
“Oh,” Harry said, tucking his shirt quickly in trousers and trying to comb his hair a little with fingers. “I just… woke up late and had to literally run.”
Harry started to run towards the castle, yelling at Draco to wait, but he didn’t even slow his pacing.
Draco looked at Granger uncertainly. He didn’t really fancy passing time in the common room these days. “I don’t know…” he said slowly.
“If we’re having company at the Three Broomsticks, I don’t think the last one would be seen very, um, considerate,” Draco murmured.
“But that’s different. I passed so much time alone with him. We talked a lot,” Harry said, guarded.
“You know, I don’t know anyone who knows as much as you. At least no one in our age.”
“Yes, on Friday. But I didn’t stay for long. Andromeda hasn’t had many chances to have any alone time or just to see her friends without Teddy, so I stayed with him the whole day yesterday.”
“It’s – it’s complicated. It’s my family, my inheritance, my culture,” Malfoy said, sighing. “But it doesn’t mean I wouldn’t want… this,” Malfoy continued, referring to their joined fingers.
Well, maybe it was already an okay time to get up. Molly would probably be just thrilled if Harry appeared at the Burrow before midday.
Harry huffed, feeling his head starting to throb slightly as it always did nowadays when he felt somehow helpless or useless. Suddenly, Harry saw movement in his peripheral vision, and he turned his gaze quickly to the window. The sight made his heart jump uncomfortably even though he had known all along this moment would come. And, after all, this was what he had been waiting for impatiently during the whole sleepless night and restless morning, but apparently, he could never get used to this sight on Sundays.
“Yeah, but they still
“I can’t… You know I can’t tell anyone.”
“No, tell me,” Ginny said, nudging Harry gently.
“Of course not! Peer support is extremely important to be able to heal.”
“I know. I mean, how did they let you come here to see me?”
“I used to babysit you sometimes when you were only a few months old. Me and Narcissa managed to have a couple of playdates for you and Draco, though you didn’t really know how to play yet. You rather just pulled each other’s hair, wrestled a little and giggled until you both were breathless.”
“Potter,” Draco said dryly. “So you’ve decided to come to my last supper? Oh, how very considerate of you.”
“Of course,” Hermione said. “What are you planning to do?”
“Fine, I guess,” Harry shrugged. “Well, Hermione said something about loving me as I am. Ron was a bit surprised at first, but there was no drama or anything like that.”
“Look, I’ve no idea what kind of game you’re playing, but I’m really not going to tell anyone,” Harry said, trying to convince Malfoy of his sincerity. “No matter how much I, erm, dislike you, I really wouldn’t tell if you’re having some kind of crisis or something.”
“What are you thinking?” Draco asked.
bullying me and my friends because, hey, you said you like me!” Harry said. “I’ve no clue when you’re being real and when you’re acting. If you even can be real, to begin with.”
"Now, that's better. You have to go out and get some air. Just take your time to pull yourself together. I'll see that no one comes to disturb you,” Blaise continued whispering and squeezing Draco's shoulder one more time before letting go.
“Would be nice if you could refrain from making fun of my skills in français,” Ron said, pronouncing the last word overemphasizing it ridiculously as both Harry and Hermione barked a laugh.
“Er, right,” Harry said, trying to think feverishly what Draco could’ve wanted to tell him without actually telling him anything. “What language was that even?”
“Of course you can, darling,” Draco said teasingly and leaned to kiss Harry’s cheek, making Harry blush.
“No, it was –”
“Alright, alright,” Ron said, lifting his hands defensively. ”Not that there would be something wrong with shagging the ferret, I mean, he’s quite fit for a bloke, I s’pose.”
have to go. Stay with me, let’s do as we had planned and –”
“Yes,” Draco said, sounding a bit sad all of a sudden.
“The thing you told me in Norwegian.”
“You know who tried to smuggle it into the castle? Who did they try to kill?” Harry asked persistently, but the expression on Draco’s face didn’t waver even a little. It all started to feel like Harry was speaking to a deaf.
Harry walked to stand next to Sirius and tried to follow his gaze. “Andromeda?” he asked when he noticed Sirius was looking at a burnt spot in the middle of Bellatrix and Narcissa.
“Told me he’d kill us all if I refused,” Draco said gloomily.
“I brought you lunch,” Potter said, opening the door with a new silver tray in his hands.
“It doesn’t matter that it’s broken. I don’t want to hide anymore,” Harry said, grabbed Draco’s hand, and pulled him abruptly into a gentle kiss.
“Is mister Harry Potter aware that he is laying on the couch with master Draco Malfoy?” Dobby whispered, looking at Harry conspiratorially.
“It had nothing to do with forgiveness,” Harry said, fidgeting with his sleeve. “Well, I still have feelings for you. Obviously. It was me who started the kissing, after all,” he trailed off and sighed. “I just, um, I don’t know how to trust you anymore. I mean, I’m scared of letting you back into my life. I’m scared of you leaving me again. I don’t think I would be able to go through that again.”
“What? Now?” Ron asked, looking quite cosy sitting on the couch.
. Harry could feel his cheeks burning, limbs tingling and brain turning to cotton candy.
“That’s it,” Hermione said sharply, closing her book with a thud. “This is like the sixth year all over again. You’re looking for Draco, aren’t you?”
There hadn’t been even any new encounters with Malfoy until one Thursday morning the git had quite clearly got up on the wrong side of the bed. When Harry was entering the Great Hall with Ron to eat a hasty breakfast, Malfoy was getting out at the same time. He glanced at Harry with a sullen expression and shoved Harry deliberately with his shoulder.
“Could say being an orphan is a sore point to me.”
But trying to fall back to sleep was a long lost battle, Draco already knew that. Uncertainty and anxiety had become stable and loyal companions to him, which was why his body had been in a sort of constant, hyperactive state already for quite a long time. He couldn’t even remember when was the last time he had been able to sleep more than ten minutes at once.
Draco had always loved this time of the year. Some people considered winter to be just something depressive and grim, and all they could see around them was death as many of the birds had left to the south, days had become significantly shorter, trees had lost their leaves and flowers had disappeared. Instead of death and misery, all Draco could see was comforting peacefulness that radiated from the sleeping nature. Everything was just sleeping, gathering their strength to feel alive again for the upcoming spring and summer.
“You can’t help me! No one can,” Draco whined, gasping for air.
“Well, maybe. But it’s not that easy when your family is involved. The rights and wrongs feel so much blurrier then, it’s not easy to see clearly what to do when you’ve got to consider your loved ones when making decisions. I personally don’t know if I had been able to leave my family either, even if I had known it would be the right thing to do.”
“Maybe no, but –”
See, here are my dreams,
Draco blinked his eyes, confused. “I’m sorry, I didn’t think. When you put it that way… Merlin, haven’t realized how horrible I’ve been to you during all these years.”
“Yeah. Ron and Hermione must’ve solved their little disagreement by now,” Ginny said, putting her arm through Harry’s again.
“Well, maybe you weren’t, but that doesn’t change the fact that you set a good example to other students. It’s a pity Malfoy had to ruin that with his actions.”
“So, open it,” Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco and leaning his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Thank you,” Draco said, his cheeks turning red of embarrassment. He didn’t like the idea of Andromeda using money on him as he didn’t know how and when he could pay back, but Draco had learned by now it was a lost battle to try to change her mind when she had already decided something.
“Why is he here?” Harry asked, his eyes still fixed on Draco.
Draco started squirming and giggling helplessly under Harry. “Stop it! This is unfair, you took advantage of me!” Draco yelped breathlessly.
The next morning Harry was running late as he hurried towards the Great Hall, trying to make it to the breakfast. A few corridors before the Hall, Harry felt someone abruptly grabbing his hand and dragging him into a hidden alcove behind the tapestry of some unknown medieval wizard.
And Harry was scared, too. It almost hurt to let someone come that close, knowing how much Draco could hurt him if he wanted. Draco had always had the skill to be able to crawl under Harry’s skin, but the way he did it now was something Harry didn’t know how to handle anymore, and it made him fear more than he even wanted to admit to himself. If he was honest, he would have wanted to be near to the other boy almost constantly, and the classrooms, the corridors and the Great Hall felt like such a bittersweet contrast to Harry and Draco’s time together as Harry wasn’t allowed to touch Draco at all, let alone show any other feelings towards him than hatred and disgust.
“Hm?”
If Harry had got to choose, he’d have wanted to go on living happily oblivious about everybody who made him feel confused or anxious in any way, but that didn’t seem to be an option. After the Owlery incident with Cho, Harry felt like his tolerance didn’t budge anymore, at least not that weekend. And then, Malfoy just had to storm to Gryffindor’s Quidditch practise with a bunch of Slytherins as if nothing had happened. The Slytherins made Ron’s practise a hell by their mocking and catcalling, but even Harry had a hard time to concentrate. In fact, he was studying Malfoy’s expressions and gestures so intensively he almost got knocked off the broom by a wandering Bludger. Malfoy looked like himself, with a wide sneer on his face as he participated eagerly in the Slytherin mockery. Only once Malfoy happened to glance at Harry, and the hesitance in the Slytherin’s eyes was the only thing that revealed to Harry there was something unusual going on inside his head.
“Did the ferret hit you on the nose?” Ron asked, nonplussed. “Weren’t you supposed to be with Neville and Gin and the others who were on that Slug club gathering or something?”
When Draco had tossed Harry’s shirt aside and pulled him into a heated kiss, the doorbell rang all of a sudden.
“Of course not. He doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore, that’s why he didn’t come to the trial,” Draco said. “I just… I think I may not be able to follow up your and father’s example, not after everything that has happened.”
know!” Ron cried. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
Harry’s words remained hovering eerily in the air, meeting this time only an endless void. He suddenly got a feeling he was now very, very alone.
“Yes,” Draco said before Harry had time to say anything else. “Or, I mean, if you want to?” Draco turned to look at Harry, sounding hesitant.
“Yes, though Teddy’s having some sort of a phase, he's trying to pull my hair and he's putting everything he can reach into his mouth. I don’t get how Andromeda’s doing it, there’s so much work to keep an eye on him all the time,” Draco said, running his hand absently through his slightly wavy and uncharacteristically long hair as if trying to find any damage in it. “I didn’t know kids would grow
? You were always hanging out either with us or with Gin,” Ron asked. “Wait! Did Gin know?”
“The friend of yours must be a house-elf, there’s no way someone else at Hogwarts could fix you something like this,” Draco said, considering the insides of the basket.
“No? Can you come up with one good reason why wizards would be better than Muggles?”
“I think so. The battery should be at least half full when you buy it. Let me see,” Ginny said, taking now both of the mobile phones, their batteries and the SIM cards.
“It’s going to get better soon. You can come home, probably already tomorrow,” Narcissa said, giving Draco a faint smile.
“Of course I am, but there isn’t really anything else I could do. At least we win some time.”
“It should be clean now,” Malfoy said softly, pulling the rag away but still not letting go of Harry’s hand.
“Partly, yeah,” Harry said, fiddling nervously with the buttons of Draco’s shirt.
“Well, Harry has told me a bit about your… experiences,” Granger began, making Draco inhale sharply. “Nothing too personal or private or anything, just that you were together during the fifth and sixth year and so,” she hastened to continue as she noticed Draco’s reaction.
--*--*--*--*--
“It’s your decision, and yours alone,” Andromeda said firmly. “You have the right to decide about your boundaries and who you want to have in your life. However, I think it might help both of you if you talked with him.”
“The day he let the Death Eaters into the castle, he chose to follow his father and other Death Eaters even though I had told him it’d be over if he left me.”
this is going to come out.”
It was only after the class Harry realized how much easier and more logical it’d have been if they had just asked Snape to do a spell to heal Harry’s cut.
“Yeah, I can get it. I’d have said you’re mental if you had told me last summer I’d start calling Draco my boyfriend this year,” Harry said, laughing hollowly. “Though honestly, I kind of like him, a lot. And Blaise is rather nice, too.”
“I’m sure,” Harry said, trying to look Molly in the eye to reassure her even though he felt a bit awkward. “I’m going to sleep at Andromeda’s tomorrow while Draco’s there after all. It’s not a big deal, really, we’re friends.”
“Ah, the Golden Boy!” Zabini greeted Harry as Harry approached him and Malfoy cautiously. “Sorry for ruining your date, I promise I’m not going to stay for long.”
“I’ve tasted vodka, but never vanilla flavoured,” Harry said, pouring some to both himself and Draco. “Cheers,” he said, handing Draco his cup and emptying his own at the same time with him.
They shimmer there like grains of gold,
“You look happy,” Hermione said to Draco, sitting on Ron’s lap on an armchair next to the couch.
“Don’t say no yet, just think about it, alright?”
“Hm, okay,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes but luckily dropping the question of the Durleys’s way to treat Harry. “But how could someone not like magic?”
“Nonsense,” Ginny said, first waving her hand nonchalantly and then beckoning Harry to follow her. “C’mon, let’s go.”
“Ginny is right,” Harry said after a moment, standing up as well. “There would be no point to play with only three players.”
“Jeg elsker deg også,” Draco said in a low voice.
spontaneously on Malfoy in the middle of the fight in their sixth year as Harry had regretted it immediately and would probably regret it at least until the end of his earthly life. And he had most definitely
“Yes, he has. He’s been here a couple of times with Andromeda. Such a lovely boy, smiles a lot,” Molly said, a dreamy look in her eyes. “I was actually planning to ask you about Christmas. I had thought that maybe we could ask Andromeda, Teddy, and Draco to join us as they’d celebrate Christmas all by themselves otherwise. And there are not as many of us as there used to be, either,” she continued, the look on her face turning gloomy, thinking probably about her son.
Harry explained how the Room worked and what they should do to get in there. Harry had thought beforehand the best option would be to wish the Room to appear as some kind of a common room, though with less red colour than in the Gryffindor one, just to avoid Draco’s protestation.
“Harry,” Draco said taking Harry’s hand and turning his gaze to Harry. “This is perfect. Thank you,” he said softly and kissed Harry on the lips.
Harry took Draco's hand without saying a word and started to walk back to the hotel.
“Mm, no,
“Master saw a nightmare,” Kreacher repeated, sounding alarmed, as Harry tried to make his breath even and come gradually back to reality. “Kreacher had to wake Master up, Master screamed as if he was in pain.”
Harry felt suddenly like an invisible hand had come to his throat to strangle him, making his breathing utterly difficult. “Which one?” he asked hoarsely.
“So?” Malfoy asked, raising his eyebrow elegantly.
life,” he stated firmly.
“Hermione and my mind healer talked some sense to me and explained what you’ve got to go through during your whole childhood and our fifth and sixth year. I’m not saying I’d understand exactly how you’ve felt and how it’s been for you, but I think I understand much better that you actually didn’t have a choice,” Harry said. “And I’m so, so sorry I didn’t understand it earlier. I wish I had.”
“I know,” Harry said, sighing. “I had thought… Dunno, maybe just ignore him as much as possible.”
“No you didn’t,” Harry said and burst out laughing. He startled as he realized it was his first real laugh in days.
Harry found Draco’s mouth again and they started kissing fervently, panting and moaning on each other’s mouths.
“Draco,
“Draco,” Harry murmured, loving the sound of his name.
“So, are we done with the eating?” Draco asked, pushing his empty plate away.
They walked in silence for a moment, regarding the frosty grass. It felt good to be back at Hogwarts, even though Harry hadn’t wanted to leave Sirius alone at Grimmauld Place. It had just happened too much during the Christmas holidays, so Harry felt quite relieved to continue living the mundane, school-filled life again.
“A couple? You wouldn’t stare at the screen this long if it was only a couple of messages.”
“So, you’re saying I should, what, give him another chance?” Harry asked, flabbergasted. He would have never guessed Molly wouldn’t only accept his feelings for Draco but also encourage him to follow those feelings.
And even if all this was just wishful thinking and there would actually be nothing after death, it would always be much better than his present state. He wouldn’t need to feel pain anymore. He wouldn’t even understand he was gone.
Malfoy strode quickly with his long legs, reaching Harry in no time. “Again, out of bed after the curfew, I don’t know what to do with you anymore,” Malfoy said, to Harry’s surprise, in a teasing tone instead of malevolent. “Care to tell me what you’re up to?”
Harry avoided Malfoy’s gaze. Zabini had asked not to tell Malfoy he knew about them, but Harry didn’t know how to answer Malfoy’s question without lying.
unforgivable curse. “Potter, what the hell do you think you're doing?”
“That doesn’t help much,” Harry muttered. He wished someone could just tell him what to do because he most definitely didn’t know what felt right and what he would be comfortable with.
feel as you saw him again?”
Harry gave Sirius a small smile. “See you next summer, then?”
“Hey, mate, nobody’s trying to say you haven’t done enough,” Ron said firmly, trying to make both of his friends calm down a little. “We just don’t get why you were okay with testifying in Narcissa’s trial, but Malfoy’s has been out of the question ever since it was first mentioned.”
When Harry took his first steps through the thick snow blanket, he started to question his and Draco’s decision to meet outside. It had seemed like a brilliant idea as it was almost zero risks to get caught, and they both felt like they were in desperate need to meet somewhere else for a change. Harry did like snow and winter, but as he was feeling somewhat anxious, he couldn’t make himself pay any attention to his surroundings. Or at least not in a positive way.
Oh well, so maybe Draco really had feelings for Harry on some level, but so what. They hadn’t clearly been enough because Draco had still been able to take the Dark Mark, even though he had known how much Harry hated Voldemort and how Voldemort’s side tried to kill Harry constantly. Nothing, absolutely nothing would ever make Harry accept taking the Dark Mark, and there was no way he could ever be with someone who was bearing it.
“You can
Eight o’clock.
“Let’s get back in?” Harry said softly, putting the Invisibility Cloak back on them.
“Hm?” Harry mumbled, half awake, half asleep.
“Yeah, I’m just not ready to, erm, come out of the closet or something. I haven’t really had time to think this too much yet.”
About an hour later, Draco was once again laying on his bed where he had managed to drag himself without any help despite all his earlier yelling at Potter. He hadn’t even realised how much a long, warm bath and a well-slept night in a real bed could have affected the energy levels of both his body and mind, and he was surprised by how relaxed and serene he was suddenly able to feel. And what was more, he had finally been able to eat something. After the bath, he had scrutinised suspiciously the tray Potter had brought to him and finally decided to at least try if he could get something down his throat. There had been everything one could possibly ever dream of for breakfast, such as toasts, bacon, omelette, chocolate muffins, and all sorts of colourful fruits and vegetables. Draco wasn’t sure what his stomach would be able to take after such a long almost-total fasting, so he ended up taking small bites of vegetables and fruits at first, and when nothing bad seemed to happen, he finally dared to take even a tiny little slice of bacon. After a while, his stomach started hurting slightly, but to Draco’s relief, the food didn’t come up.
Draco Malfoy appeared in the doorway of their compartment with a wide smirk on his face. Malfoy’s most loyal cronies, Grabbe and Goyle, were standing and sniggering beside him like two dumbheads that were frightening only because of their physical appearance. Harry had seen this encounter coming, but it didn’t make it any easier.
“But they organized a funeral and all,” Ginny said, perplexed. “Oh Merlin. Poor Draco.”
“Not that I know of, no.”
“I can see that,” Harry muttered as Ron came back, handing Harry a cup that was half full of, surprise, surprise, tequila. “
“So you’re saying I should’ve just been okay with him choosing Voldemort’s side and working for him?” Harry asked, incredulous. He couldn’t believe his friends were actually defending Draco. Or so it felt like, at least.
“So, now what?” Ginny asked when the door had closed after Ron and Hermione.
“I think I agree with ‘Mione. I’m not saying I like the git or that he wouldn’t deserve some sort of punishment but c’mon, he shouldn’t have to go to Azkaban,” Ron said. “He did a lot of stupid stuff, but in the end he didn’t kill anyone. He actually tried to even help us a bit.”
Because Draco was relatively sure he could feel the soft mattress on the bed, smell the clean sheets that were wrapped tightly around him, and for the first time in a long, long time he felt like his body was pleasantly warm from head to toe.
“It was actually alright, I mean, I think I needed someone to, erm, hit me in the face, so to speak.”
“No, I’m already full,” Harry said, but Draco seemed like he hadn’t heard him as he put a spoon full of treacle tart into Harry’s mouth.
“I hope you’re right,” Harry said, taking Ginny’s hand in his and squeezing it. “How would I ever survive without you?” he asked, feeling overwhelmingly happy for having her as a friend.
Malfoy blushed. “Well, you did look rather handsome in your dress robes.”
“Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck,” Draco cried as soon as he had straightened his posture again.
Harry took his phone from the pocket.
“Yeah, I think I do,” Harry said as Ginny nudged his side teasingly with her elbow.
“Yeah, right,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “This is the first and last cup of tequila I’m going to drink this night.”
who said this is something
Harry started to laugh, too. “Or Dobby when he tried to ask very discreetly if I knew with who I was passing time in the Room of Requirement the first time he saw us together? He looked at me like I had gone mental.”
“I can get it if it’s in the common room. I forgot my book and I’ve already eaten anyway,” Harry said and stood up.
“Jeg elsker deg.”
“Thank you for taking care of my son,” Narcissa said softly before Disapparating into the winter night.
Late in the evening, when the common room had already calmed down, Harry slumped exhausted on the couch in the far corner of the room. Hermione, nose deep in her Transfiguration book, startled next to him. She marked the page she had been reading, put the book on her bag and raised her gaze at Harry.
Harry, still dazed because of the kiss and the sudden loss of touch, looked at Malfoy confused. “You’re not or you cannot be?”
“I think I’ve got a fair idea as there hasn’t been a day after you left that I wouldn’t have felt like I didn’t miss you or didn’t love you,” Harry said, smiling gently as he broke the kiss. “I don’t want to hide anymore. I want to call you my boyfriend in front of everyone. I want to be able to hold your hand at the Great Hall. I want to do this to you at the Three Broomsticks,” Harry said, starting to kiss Draco’s neck, making Draco sigh and tilt his head to give Harry better access.
think you had done something malicious to me,” Harry laughed, lowering his head over Draco’s and feeling Draco shaking with laughter against his shoulder.
To that Malfoy didn’t apparently have an answer. He closed his eyes and pinched his nose with his thumb and index finger.
“It was my fault,” Draco said before Harry had time to answer. “I made him take the troll for a moment.”
“It’s quite obvious, isn’t it?” Harry asked, nonplussed. “He chose his family over me, chose to stay on Voldemort’s side.”
“And they arrested your father. I’m sorry, he just happened to be there, and –” Harry said, almost panicking.
“Probably not. And it’s always been possible to eventually go around or abolish the laws if they’ve seemed too barbaric or inhuman,” Hermione said. “But now I’ve got no idea what we could do next. Not even Kingsley seems to have a say in the Wizengamot’s decisions.”
“I can’t talk about that,” Harry muttered.
“They’re so beautiful,” Harry whispered.
When the last day before the summer holidays dawned, Harry was outright brooding despite the beautiful and sunny weather. His friends tried their best to cheer him up, telling him it wouldn’t be a long time until they saw each other again, and Harry tried really, really hard to pretend like he wasn’t feeling as bad as he actually was. He knew he had been a difficult friend, not only to Hermione and Ron but basically to all his friends. He was just so, so tired. And definitely not looking forward to going back to the Dursleys.
“God, you sound like a tough Viking when you speak like that.”
“But not thanks to you,” Harry said, feeling the anger rising in him.
“Merlin, I had no idea Muggles can do this kind of things,” Zabini said as Harry handed the phone back to Draco.
“You’re unbelievable,” Harry murmured and kissed Draco on the cheek.
They sat in silence for a moment, watching over the lake as the sun was setting. The autumn was clearly progressing at a fast pace as the days were remarkably shorter and nights colder. Soon Harry could feel Malfoy starting to shiver. Even the Warming Charm didn’t last long on the cooling autumn evenings.
When Harry arrived at he and Malfoy’s usual spot, he was surprised to see Zabini sitting there, next to Malfoy.
Malfoy snorted. “Oh please, as if you already weren’t drunk,” he said, sneering. “I was planning on tasting this another way.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, breaking the kiss as he noticed Harry had suddenly gotten tense and unresponsive.
“Yeah, probably,” Harry said, even though he no longer bought that as an explanation. He was sure by now Dumbledore was trying to avoid him almost at all costs.
“Please, just Draco,” Draco said awkwardly and crouched to the same level as the elf. “Do you happen to know anything about Harry?” Draco asked with a low voice. He didn’t really believe the house-elves would gossip, but one could never be too cautious.
“No, nothing’s wrong. Did I interrupt something? What were you doing here?” Harry asked as he came to stand in front of Draco, making Draco feel like there were suddenly a thousand butterflies in his stomach.
“This is not a laughing matter,” Draco snapped indignantly, throwing a sofa cushion in Zabini’s direction.
“You do?” Hermione asked, excited.
“What? He wasn’t supposed to
“For the hundredth time, I didn’t do anything to that Bell girl! I’m doing alright, I have a plan.”
“You look happier,” Ginny said as they started to walk back towards Grimmauld Place.
Harry understood now why Draco had taken the Dark Mark, he really did, but he couldn’t pretend it didn’t matter. Because it did. Harry could barely stand the feeling of knowing Draco was now imprinted by a person who had already taken so much from him and was now trying to take Draco, too. Frankly, it made him scared as hell. Last year he had still thought Draco could simply just step aside and change sides, but with his parents being in danger, that probably wasn’t a plausible solution, at least not for now. And, eventually, Draco would have to face a situation where he would have to choose between his parents and Harry, and Harry had no idea which Draco would choose.
“That was… really good. Amazing. I don’t even know how to call it,” Harry sighed when he felt like he could breathe again. He grabbed his wand and cleaned them both.
“Yes. They let me go an hour or so ago,” Draco said, turning around to face his mother.
Harry didn’t say anything. Instead, he started running his hands absentmindedly over Draco’s chest, feeling the warmth of Draco’s body even through his shirt.
. You’ve surely seen and done weirder things than this,” he said.
“It doesn’t matter, I still have to kill someone soon. If I don’t, he’s going to… he’s going to kill me and my parents,” Draco said as a sudden new wave of sobs hit him. “I can’t do it… I can’t… kill anyone,” he continued in a strangled voice between sobs. Draco tried to get a hold of himself taking a deep breath in. Then, before Harry had time to back off, Draco raised his gaze a fraction and noticed Harry in the mirror, lurking behind the door. Draco froze completely, and the breath hitched in his throat. Slowly, he turned around, and Harry stepped properly into the room.
“Yeah, it is.”
Before Harry had time to even consider what he was doing, he stood up and let all the pent-up rage erupt at the smirking git by grabbing his collar and slamming him harshly against the wall. Malfoy seemed to freeze surprised by Harry’s sudden reaction. Their encounter hadn’t probably proceeded the way the Slytherin had expected, and for a split-second Harry thought he was seeing something like despair and anxiety flickering behind the all too familiar Malfoy mask. Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes locked with Harry’s deeply green ones, and neither of them seemed to be able to move or breathe.
“I thought you’d have been much cleverer than this, Draco. What in Salazar’s name do you think you are doing?” Snape asked. “Look at me!” Snape exclaimed, making both Harry and Draco wince.
“Thanks, Blaise,” Malfoy said, smiling warmly at his friend.
“Never mind,” Harry said and started typing.
“Blaise Zabini,” Harry said and noticed Ginny looking at him questioningly. “A fifth year Slytherin.”
Harry sighed. “I don’t think they’ll buy it, but maybe they won’t ask anything as this isn’t a habit for me.”
“What has happened?” Ginny asked, yawning, as she entered the kitchen.
“Alright, alright,” Draco said. “So, what would you recommend?”
Draco was just about to start to explain when he heard someone approaching them. He closed his mouth and turned his head, only to meet Professor Snape’s cold glare.
“I don’t know. We just noticed we get along quite well, and one thing led to another and, well,” Harry said, not wanting to tell the whole story about their rather bumpy start from last autumn.
“I’m sorry I asked about it.”
Hermione glanced at Harry, scrutinising him. “Are you going to meet with the mystery boy?”
“No,” Draco said, alarmed, as his eyes snapped at Andromeda. “Thank you, but no. I don’t know how I could pay you back and I’m already a burden to you.”
Draco sat down on his bed and felt the material of the robes. It didn’t make any sense. They were not allowed to have any guests, and, besides, why would his mother buy him white robes? His mother was well aware of Draco preferring dark colours, and he was actually pretty sure he had never even worn anything white, at least not after he had been old enough to decide what to wear.
Harry took a deep breath, sat down on Malfoy’s left side, and started looking for the Potions book in his bag.
“No,” Draco said. “Though don’t even think about this becoming a new habit.”
“Fine. Let’s talk more about this a bit closer to Christmas, alright?” Harry said, giving Ginny a small smile. “I think I should actually go now, thought I’d, um, check everything’s okay at Grimmauld Place. Could you say bye to Ron and Hermione for me?”
“Malfoy’s
The words rang in Draco’s ears alternately in Potter’s and the Dark Lord’s voices.
Malfoy noticed instantly Harry knew something. “So, he knows?”
“What in Merlin’s –”
“Should’ve guessed he’d act like a coward,” Harry snarled.
Draco nodded. “It should’ve been clear to me before you mentioned it. I’m sorry.”
to be fine. Actually, it’d be really weird if you’d be just fine so soon after the War. You can talk to me,” she went on, placing her hand lightly on Harry’s thigh.
“I just wish we could be on the same side of this thing.”
But better now or never, right?
“Hm, okay.”
“And when exactly have you learned to speak French?” Harry asked, grinning.
Harry looked at Draco fiercely. “He’s not going to say a word to anybody. I trust him, he’s kept my secrets before. Actually, he was the one who told me about this room.”
“But what
“You think he’s not going to tell your parents, either?”
“Now you’re speaking gibberish again. Charge? Battery?” Draco asked, looking at his phone, utterly confused.
“Ginny,” Harry groaned, blushing.
“Not really,” Harry muttered.
Harry felt a bit relieved. “I know you can’t be nice to me publicly, but if you’re with me, I want you to be only with me.”
On the right side of the Room there was a rather huge bed with indigo blue curtains, grey sheets and at least a dozen pillows. For some reason, Harry blushed at the sight of the bed and studiously ignored it after the first glance.
“Erm, I s’pose?” Harry answered, fiddling with his pint, and looking questioningly at Draco who was sitting next to him. He had known Draco had at least mentioned Harry in the group meetings, but he didn’t know how much exactly the other group members knew about them as a unit and their history together.
“I thought I’d go flying. And maybe send a letter to Padfoot,” Harry said.
“No, although I don’t want to try to make excuses. Everybody should realize dead family members are nothing to joke about.
At first, Harry flew as far away from the school as the Hogwarts’ wards let him. Usually flying reduced his stress as soon as he could feel the speed and see the ground get smaller and smaller as he flew higher up. Though that time his fury didn’t seem to let go that easily. He had to fly for a good while before he felt the tenseness to ease a fraction.
“Are you going to play, too?” Harry asked Blaise.
Harry didn’t say anything, just nodded.
“I know. And I’m happy I’ve gotten the chance to get to know you now,” Andromeda said, giving Draco a small smile. “I think I’m off to bed. You can stay up as long as you like but turn off the lights when you go to bed, alright?” she went on, getting up from the armchair.
because of them! And Teddy has to grow up without his parents!”
To Harry’s luck, green flames burst suddenly up in the fireplace, and Hermione rushed through without saying or asking anything before appearing in the kitchen, looking furious.
“When we’re worried or anxious we always end up thinking about the worst possible scenario which usually isn’t even possible to happen. It’s much more likely Draco’s battery
Ginny nodded gravely.
“That sounds nice. It might actually be a really good idea to do something more relaxing and casual with the people from your support group as you mainly discuss only very heavy topics on your meetings,” Hermione said, smiling warmly at Draco.
!” he cried, pointing his wand at Harry.
“Well, not exactly –” Draco began but stopped as the tip of Harry’s wand was suddenly on his throat.
Draco's heart skipped suddenly a beat. The Aurors had shouted frequently how no Malfoy would have a place in the post-war society, and Draco had thought it meant their entire family had already been sentenced to death. Did this mean his mother hadn’t been killed alongside his father after all? No, there was no way Potter could mean what he said. He had clearly misunderstood something. “What do you mean?”
Harry and Draco jumped as far away from one another as possible, both looking dishevelled with half-open shirts, tousled hair and swollen lips.
“Nothing, absolutely nothing,” Malfoy said icily and started pacing away from Harry.
must be my personal favourite.”
“Pounds,” Draco repeated, probably trying to make himself remember the word. “I hope I won’t have to Obliviate too many Muggles during that night.”
“I’m glad to hear that, but that’s not what I meant. To me it sounds like what there was between you two wasn’t just a passing teenage romance,” Molly said. “Do you still love him?”
“I’m so sorry about your nose. I really didn’t mean to hit you,” Draco said, guilt dripping in his voice.
“We are alive.”
“Jesus, Anne, let the poor lad enjoy his beer,” a young, brown-haired man with kind eyes said to Anne as he sat down on her other side. “I’m Chris by the way, nice to meet you,” he said, smiling and stretching out his hand to Harry.
Draco shook his head. “No. He’s always been close to my family and taken care of me since I was a child.”
“Hermione, what do you know about pureblood stuff?” Harry asked, slumping on the couch next to his friend in the common room. There was so much in Harry’s mind he didn’t really understand, and his thoughts felt like bursting out from his head.
“Are you trying to tell me you’d like to be with me even during those days when I’m feeling all horrible and wrong?” Draco asked, feeling cautiously hopeful.
Harry sighed heavily, his mind now filling with the voices of Hermione, Andromeda, and Molly, they all trying to explain to him the situation from Draco’s point of view. And yes, Harry thought he understood it now as he had already told Draco, or, well, at least as much as an outsider could understand it. But he was still scared, actually so scared that he didn’t want to admit it even to himself. And even though Molly’s words about not being too afraid of life had made complete sense and had made Harry’s heart flutter, cautiously hopeful, Harry still didn’t know if he could get over his fears and let himself become so utterly vulnerable and exposed ever again.
“They all know you’ve been friends with Ginny for years now and that you get along quite well with Ron, too,” Harry said, trying to sound reassuring. “Besides, Molly and Arthur know what you’ve gone through and that you didn’t have a choice. They don’t blame you for anything.”
Draco's father and his friends had always ranted about Potter's pure evilness because he had killed their ever so loved Dark Lord. Therefore, Potter must be such a threat and danger, especially to the purebloods. Even as a child Draco had wondered, how the Dark Lord could have been so almighty if he managed to get himself killed by a baby, not to mention a Half-blood baby. And how a child in his age could be evil. As far as he had known, children couldn't be evil. How could they, they couldn't do magic, they couldn't defend themselves and they were just so small, weak and innocent. Once Draco had expressed his thoughts to his father and, to put it mildly, his father hadn't been very pleased. After that Lucius Malfoy had made it extremely clear to Draco to never question his opinions again.
Harry sat down on the table by the window and looked out. Ginny and Draco were sitting on the grass and they both seemed to be cooing to Teddy who was now on Ginny’s lap.
--*--*--*--*--
“You don’t have to apologize. I get why you acted as you did. I know what the Dark Mark represents to you,” Draco said in a pained voice.
to do with psychology,” Hermione said, incredulous, but the look on Harry’s face remained confused. “Okay, so, basics of psychology. God, we should really study this stuff at Hogwarts, it’d be so much easier to understand both yourself and other people," she went on, sighing heavily. "So, you know, our brains, both Muggle and wizard, consist of brain cells that create chains according to what you learn, and those learned chains form your thoughts. Your brain is an evolving organ, so it may always create new chains meanwhile some chains may decay and vanish if you don’t use them. You’re keeping up with me?”
“Erm, I don’t think ferret is that popular among them right now. At least not among the pureblood-fanatics, and they’re the ones who’ve got influence,” Ron said.
“Only a few more steps. Just don’t think about what you’re doing,” Harry said, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco’s waist and starting to walk a little faster.
Then, the door squeaked open and happily babbling Blaise entered, very tense looking Draco following on his tail. Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, and he could guess the look on their faces must’ve been almost identical.
Leaving Harry behind had been probably the most difficult thing Draco had ever done. No matter how hard he tried to lure his mind to think about something else, it still kept replaying the last glance he had cast at Harry. Harry, who had looked so devastated, sad, and betrayed. Harry, who instead of only one person had lost two people that night.
spot, made Harry feel pleasantly giddy.
“Of course I do but I might forget to give it to you if you go on harassing me like this,” Draco said, trying to sound annoyed but failing at it as he couldn’t make the wide smile on his face fade.
Tattoos didn’t go deep, they pierced only the outermost layer of the skin. He wasn’t quite sure how deep the Dark Mark went, but he had to try at least. All he needed to do was to scratch the surface a little.
It wasn’t before the lunch break on next Friday Harry had a chance to surprise Draco by dragging him into an alcove near the dungeons.
“Do you know how to transfigure parchments into wrapping paper? I’m pants at Transfiguration,” Harry said.
Draco refrained from answering. What was the point when the git would just burst into the room no matter what Draco answered?
Harry didn’t still have a clue what had happened between him and Malfoy. He knew he might be a bit oblivious sometimes, but even he was pretty sure by now that Malfoy felt something for him. What he didn’t understand was what Malfoy meant by saying he couldn’t be gay. Harry knew it wasn’t easy to admit oneself being different from other people, but being gay wasn’t really a choice, right? There was always the option that Malfoy wasn’t attracted to blokes at all but based on Malfoy’s earlier behaviour, Harry was quite sure that wasn’t the case. Both times they had kissed, Malfoy had definitely kissed Harry with emotion. In addition to that, what really baffled Harry was how Malfoy had started acting as if he
And then Harry told Draco everything that had happened that day. The vision, the Department of Mysteries, the Death Eaters attacking them, Voldemort fighting with Dumbledore, and Sirius dying, being killed by Draco’s aunt Bella.
Harry stared at him, confused. “Sorry, what?”
--*--*--*--*--
“Yeah, yeah, right, thanks,” Ron said, blushing violently. “See you soon, mate. Don’t do anything stupid,” he said and started walking zigzag towards the apple trees.
“Dobby,” Harry said again, but both of the Slytherins ignored him.
After having left the kitchens, Draco had gone to the dungeons to meet Blaise, who had also, unsurprisingly, come to a dead end. Together they had decided to go and see if they could find anything in the courtyard or somewhere around the lake, but they had already known it would only be in vain. There was nothing else to do than to give up.
something to do with you, I saw you two sneaking to your room last night,” Blaise snapped, clearly being protective of his friend.
After a moment, Draco flinched slightly and took a sharp breath in. He started fluttering his eyelashes, and as he opened his still sleepy-looking eyes and saw Harry in front of him, a smile spread wearily across his face.
They walked past the Room three times, both thinking about their own idea of a cosy common-room-like place. Harry was feeling a little giddy as he had no idea how the combination of their thoughts of a common room would be like. What did you get combining red with green? Yellow? Harry grimaced at the thought.
“Was there something bothering you?” Hermione asked.
“Yes, ‘Mione. I really wasn’t hungry anymore, and I probably just needed some time alone,” Harry said, sighing. “Look, it’s nice of you to worry for me, but there’s really no need to. I promise I’ll tell you if there’s something you can help me with.”
Harry kissed Draco’s head before starting to stroke his hair lazily. They both felt quite calm and much more relaxed than in the beginning. They closed their eyes contently, feeling each other’s body warmth and listening to Ginny and Blaise’s vivid stream of conversation.
When Draco turned his gaze to his mother, he felt a wave of dread washing over him. His mother was crying silently, eyes red and swollen. She looked out of the window with empty eyes, refusing to look at Draco.
“She’s your friend.”
“I’m not talking about reckless risk-taking where you put your life in danger,” Molly said. “I’m talking about rationalizing your fears and taking chances that aren’t idiotic or irresponsible. In Draco’s case, yes, you’re right that there’s a risk he might go back to his parents. We can’t see the future, and we can never know the outcome of our decisions beforehand. However, it doesn’t seem very likely Draco would go back as there’s no more war looming in our future, Draco has many people who accept him completely as he is nowadays and you both have so much more support now, the support you would’ve needed already years ago. Day by day, Draco’s getting stronger, and the control his parents once had over him is fading.”
after all the bad stuff and gloominess,” Ron said, wrapping his arm around his girlfriend.
Draco broke the kiss and looked Harry in the eye, silvery-grey eyes glinting. “Yes, I think so. Not now, but one day. I’d most definitely want that.”
Draco looked at the book incredulously. “You brought a children’s book?”
“You will always be my boys – and girls,” Molly said, glancing at her youngest. “So I will
“They don’t like magic, or rather, they can’t stand it. They made it really clear as soon as they noticed I was magical, and it was far earlier I knew myself.”
Well, as Snape had already entered Harry’s mind various times without Harry’s actual consent, it couldn’t hurt too much to take a brief look at what kind of secrets Snape might be hiding. Harry took a deep breath, dunked his face into the Pensieve and let himself fall into Snape’s thoughts.
“Ron, this is
“No need to bow, Kreacher,” Potter said, his face turning red. Draco had noticed quite recently that Potter was surprisingly bad at being worshipped and admired by the others, even though Draco had used to believe the complete opposite and bullied him many times about it at school. “Kreacher, this is Draco Malfoy. Malfoy, this is Kreacher.”
“Hm, I could be persuaded, if I get a proper reward,” Draco murmured against Harry’s jaw as he started opening the buttons of Harry’s shirt.
The following days in Harry’s life passed by like a blur. All the classes started, and there was already more than enough homework. Hermione would tell them it was because of the O.W.L.s, but Harry thought there would never be a reason big enough to justify piles and piles of homework in their first week. Adding other obligatory stuff in the mess, like eating and pleasant writing sessions with Umbridge, Harry felt like there weren’t enough hours in the day.
exactly? I’m afraid even the great Harry Potter might not be able to Disapparate through the wards,” Draco snarled.
“It’s the Pepper-Up Potion. I don't use it very often.”
“Hey, Malfoy, is it true you can speak Norwegian? Harry told me you sound like a tough, sexy Viking when you speak it,” Ginny asked, apropos of nothing.
“Is there something wrong with you? You’re feeling unwell?”
“Erm, there’s no need to bow, Dobby,” Harry said, but Dobby didn’t move an inch. “I think you should say that to him,” Harry whispered to baffled looking Draco.
are alright? You seemed to be a bit upset when you left,” Hermione said, clearly with an intention of not dropping the subject.
“I can’t believe I agreed to all this,” Draco muttered as they arrived at the shore where a small, wooden rowing boat was waiting for them.
“Great! I’d like to practise the Double Eight Loop at some point, though.”
“Yes, Potter, a bath,” Draco repeated, articulating every word intentionally as slowly and clearly as possible.
--*--*--*--*--
“Why are you holding your hand like that? You didn’t cut that hand on Potions,” Malfoy said, grabbing Harry’s arm before Harry had time to snatch it away.
“I don’t
Draco considered Harry’s words. Maybe Harry was right, maybe the Order really could save his family. It would be risky, yes, but there were still plenty of other powerful people left on their side. The war was definitely not over yet. Besides, his family wasn’t safe on the Dark Lord’s side, either, as no one could ever know what he would come up with next. It was perfectly possible he would kill them all merely because Draco hadn’t been able to kill Dumbledore. Or only because he was in a mood. Actually, it might be even safer to change sides at this point. And then Draco would be able to be with Harry.
Draco patted Ginny’s back absentmindedly, looking at Harry over her shoulder. As their eyes met, Harry could feel the confusion and anxiousness radiating from Draco, as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes. Harry’s face was probably reflecting Draco’s feelings as he suddenly felt short of breath, and all the thoughts left his mind. All he wanted was to flee but he couldn’t; it felt like his feet weren’t really his as the message his brain tried to send them didn’t seem to reach them at all.
“Hey!” Zabini cried out as Harry started laughing. Draco found somewhere another sofa cushion and hit Harry on the face with it.
Draco nodded and beckoned Harry to sit down next to him as he started to hug his knees, looking apprehensive.
“Positive. As Sirius told you, my mother has been in too deep for too long.”
Harry didn’t dare to move or breathe when Draco finally touched him for the first time that day, wrapping his arms around Harry and putting their foreheads together.
Or rather,
knew Draco wasn’t right, but he dropped the topic this time.
Draco turned his gaze to the sea and inhaled the salty sea air into his lungs. He had thought that he would never again be able to smell the fresh air, feel the wind on his face, or see the daylight, so he allowed himself to enjoy all that with all his senses. The feeling surged over him with such great force that for the first time in a long time he felt like there was simply no room in his body for the feeling of coldness or weakness, even though it was almost as cold outside as it had been in his cell. This was how life was supposed to feel. This is how it felt to be alive.
“No, I mean, I’m just –”

Draco tried to stare back at Harry with a serious face until the corner of his mouth started twitching. “Merlin, Potter, you should see your face,” he said, bursting out laughing. “Honestly, you’ve been talking so much about her I knew it was only a matter of time you asked if it was okay she joined our small, merry club.”
“Done. I can’t write more if I want to keep my fingers,” Harry said, pocketing the phone and starting to rub his hands together.
“Blaise, could you just act normal for a second?” Malfoy whined, frustrated.
Harry looked at Ginny, feeling utterly bewildered. “Why on earth would someone want to tell about their feelings in another language?”
Suddenly, Draco felt like he wasn’t really there, on the seventh floor with Harry, because what Harry was telling him didn’t make any sense. Draco was pretty sure he was probably in his own room and in his own bed, dreaming. Seeing one of those uncountable dreams he had seen about him and Harry.
“Yes. Merlin, what a disaster. I can’t even use that Muggle money… What was it called again?”
Potter was silent for a moment, clearly pondering what to say next. “You’re –”
They fell into silence once more, both of them deep in their thoughts.
Harry felt amazed at how much his friend knew, and now even Harry felt like he understood at least slightly better what Zabini had tried to explain to him earlier that day. “But, ‘Mione, how do you know all this? Or, I mean,
The weekend and the first meeting in order to organize secret Defense lessons gave Harry something else to think about. He didn’t still know if he liked Hermione’s idea, but he could admit there definitely was a need for proper classes, especially if, or rather when, they one day had to fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.
“Don’t know,” Harry said, shrugging. “My aunt must have envied my mum. My grandparents had apparently been really excited about having a witch in the family, so I don’t know, maybe they gave more attention to my mum. Maybe it was because my mum left the Muggle world behind her. Or maybe because it seemed like my mum died because of the Wizarding World and magic. Have never talked about this with my aunt, and probably never will, she doesn’t even want to hear the word magic.”
to what he has to say,” Blaise said sharply. “I like you, Potter, but if you ever hurt Draco like this again, I won’t answer for the consequences.”
“No,” Harry said and closed his eyes for a moment, taking a long breath in. “But, er, there might be someone else I’m seeing. A bloke,” he said, feeling himself blushing. God, he could’ve imagined telling about seeing someone, seeing a bloke, would’ve become easier by now, but apparently it had not.

Draco looked at Harry, unconvinced. “Well, I shouldn’t have done that anyway. I promise I won’t do anything like that ever again.”

“What was that shite Weasley was insinuating in the morning?” Malfoy asked angrily, although Harry could see that he seemed to be a bit confused as he saw Harry sitting on the ground, looking quite relaxed.
“You mean, like a double-date?”
“I said exactly the same,” Blaise said, grinning.
“You know, you’re such a perfect boyfriend for her,” Harry said, grinning and squeezing Ron’s cheeks. He might be a little drunk, but he wasn’t dumb. Ron surely wanted to see Hermione was doing okay, but Harry was quite sure Ron had also a secret, sex-related agenda to find Hermione so desperately. Because that was what you did when you got drunk, right? You got horny and wanted to push your tongue into someone’s mouth. Or everyone’s mouth. Muggle movies had really been very educative.
“What, Malfoy?” Harry asked tiredly but surprisingly calmly. A moment alone in nature had apparently soothed his nerves so that even Malfoy couldn’t irritate him.
“No idea,” Ron said, shrugging. “But there must be something going on. You don’t make that kind of decisions lightly.”
“A record?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry chuckled. “Draco, you’re a
“Oh fine, oh fine,” Harry snapped. He knew his friends were right, he just didn’t like to admit himself what a jerk he had been last night. “He’s in your room, right?” he asked, getting up.
“Harry! Wait!” Ginny cried out, running after Harry when he had exited the common room.
’, almost every single Auror guarding Azkaban had felt like it was their duty to remind Draco of that, spitting him on the face just to make their message clear and to show him his rightful place. After spending two months in Azkaban, Draco couldn’t help but wonder how

Dudley’s eyes widened comically as a sudden realization hit him. “You were talking to one of
“All the babies look adorable,” Harry muttered, pocketing the picture after Ginny had given it back to him.
With Umbridge gone, it had been much easier to try to help the Gryffindors and Lovegood, and Draco had even managed to have a surprisingly profound conversation with Ginny only through glances. As Draco was some kind of an unofficial leader of the Inquisitorial Squad, he had told the other members to go and try to find more members of the DA, just to see if they could milk some more information out of them for Umbridge. The other Squad members had looked at him suspiciously, but Draco had assured them he could always handle a couple of Gryffindors who were tied with ropes.
“Oh,” extremely thin and shabby-looking Draco Malfoy said, opening the door, eyes widened.
“Well, she’s an extraordinarily clever witch,” Andromeda said. “If you talked with Draco, it wouldn’t mean you’d have to forgive him, but it would probably clear the air as you are not going to get rid of each other any time soon. He’s going to stay with me as long as he needs to, and you are both going back to Hogwarts in a couple of weeks.”
“Isn’t that sweet to watch,” Snape said coldly, breaking the spell all of a sudden. “Such a pity the exposure of your little club has given you two some, ah, difficulties.”
