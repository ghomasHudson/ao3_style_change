That was what drove him as he flew upwards, battling the wind; that, and the arms wrapped around his waist so tight it hurt. Harry couldn't stop flying, had to get out- because if he didn't, he wouldn't be the only one to suffer the consequences.
mastering that trick! Ever since he returned to Hogwarts for his eighth year and had been allowed to play Quidditch and own a broom again.
He remembered looking into the Mirror in that room, and seeing himself- his eleven-year-old-self, for some reason- pocketing the Stone. He'd been wearing the same clothes as he had been wearing when Harry had seen the same thing seven years ago. Like he had then, he'd felt for the stone and found it in his pocket.
With another swish of his wand, Draco sent the army hurtling at Blaise, who yelped and tried to run from them- honestly, what an
"Guys," Potter said. "Sorry to interrupt your bonding, but we have a Hallow to look for. 'Mione, why don't you try spells? Malfoy and I can talk you through what happened as you try them."
Then Harry stood and gave himself a quick check-over; in the midst of action, when he was full of adrenaline, Harry often gave little notice to injuries he sustained. They usually went entirely unnoticed until somebody else pointed them out. He stretched, checking his muscles; then brushed his hands down his body to check for blood. He found none, but he was pretty sure he'd bruised his tailbone when he'd fallen down into the room of Mirrors of Erised; it ached, especially when sat back down again.
"Right away!" Dobby cried. A few moments later he reappeared with a carrot, which he handed to Harry happily, then disapparated. Harry turned to the snowman.
Potter sank to his knees before him. "Oh," he breathed. "Oh, Merlin." Draco could practically feel his eyes roaming the scarred expanse of Draco's chest. The skin itself was smoothed, physically indistinguishable from any other part of him; the Dittany did that. But it wasn't quite strong enough to stop the visual scarring- or the emotional scarring, or mental. Visually, there were cuts- thirty-seven on his front, to be precise- lacing his skin with imperfections. The worst was one that stretched from his right shoulder down over the left side of his ribcage, and halfway round his back. It was crisscrossed with many others.
"Potter," Draco said stiffly in return. God, it was awkward. Should he have brought something? A thank you present, maybe, as a gift for saving Draco from Azkaban- and
They mounted the hill. It appeared to be the highest of a series of hills; behind him, he could see that flat wasteland, stretching out to the horizon. To his left was a forest- with a sigh of relief, Draco recognised it as the forest he and Potter had fallen into the last time they'd arrived here. Before him, over a rolling landscape of hills, lay the plains, and- there it was- Flamel's modest little cabin.
Thanking Potter after he spoke for him at his trial- and his mother's- although Draco already owed him a life debt; losing sleep over everyone who had died in the war, and feeling so terribly, terribly responsible; being unable to sit by the roaring fire and stare into its flames without being transported back to that traumatising event in the Room of Requirement; allowing himself to be pushed into an eighth year at Hogwarts just because he didn't know what else to do with himself- and now, relating to a song? And a
game began sometime in the middle of fourth year, when Draco just wouldn't shut up about Potter in the tournament and the dragons and his badges.
McGonagall recalled the image of the boys, snuggled up together so happily. "I shan't disclose that information to you two, or you would immediately go off searching for him. He is safe, and he is happy, and I have no doubt he will return when he is ready."
Draco summoned Jisky and had her bring him the largest carrot she could find; while she set off to do that, he walked down to the Black Lake and selected the finest small boulders for the eyes, and several slightly smaller rocks for the mouth. He arranged them on the face to make a happy smile with two round-ish eyes before Jisky arrived back with a carrot taller than herself. Draco took it and dismissed her back to the Room of Requirement with a smile and his thanks.
"Do me, 'Mione!" Rona called; she cast the spell on him and place him beside his imprint. "Why does yours look better than mine?" he asked Harry.
The world allowed them a moment of silent peace, but when Harry opened his mouth to say something, a crack of apparition announced Jisky's arrival. "Master Draco," she said, "Your potion has finished."
"I'm sorry about the war; I'm sorry about you having to choose between your family and being a murderer and dying. I'm sorry I didn't try to offer you help of protection or any other way you could have escaped.
At that point, he'd wanted to be someone Harry could- would- smile at like- he looked at the mirror- like that, like he was everything.
It counteracted the combination of the Powdered Root of Asphodel combined with the Infusion of Wormwood and Valerian Sprigs- but, as Draco looked back up the list, there was no ingredient that would make the potion addictive as it was. Unless...
A blissful smile crossed his face for a moment, and he said, "Thank you, Potter." Then he whirled, almost choking on his apple, and repeated, "
The broom came speeding through from the sky in a blur of brown; Harry somehow mounted it, now facing downwards in a nosedive position. At least, Draco thought it was down that Harry was facing; he wasn't quite sure which way was up and which was down at this point.
"'Mione," he said, that night in the Gryffindor common room. Hermione hummed in acknowledgement, but didn't move even to put her book down. "'Mione, Harry's been gone for hours," he tried.
And so Potter, being the contradictory little Gryffindor that he is, looks Draco dead in the eye, and says, in the most deadpan voice, "I
He jumped up, Accioed his notebook and a nearby quill and ink he hadn't seen lying about (or he would've cleaned it up; it's not very responsible to leave liquids in the same space as a potentially volatile substance, especially when they could mix and make something truly nasty) and scribbled down his train of thought.
And Pansy had drawn a lightning scar on Harry's one and charmed the scarf on Draco's to be a Slytherin green and silver, so that it looked like Harry and Draco holding hands.
Potter read what he wrote. "Malfoy, your handwriting is so curly. Er, no, I don't know it. Did we ever even
"I'm sorry for being so horrible to you, even though all you did was reject my friendship, and it was because I really was a brat back then. I'm sorry for my prejudices and my anger and the arguments.
He sprinted out of the Room and down the hallway, following the faintest echo of the footsteps; followed them until they stopped abruptly. Harry ran harder, bursting out of the main doors and onto the grounds; the sun blinded him for a moment. The fields were clear as far as Harry could see; everyone was in class. He squinted, looking around wildly for a head of white-blond hair, glinting in the afternoon sunlight. He saw nothing. Surely Draco couldn't have gotten away that quickly? Not without Disapparating, and you can't Disapparate on Hogwarts grounds. Harry knew that from the many lectures from Hermione. But he'd never find Draco by himself...
"Then, at Malfoy Manor- when we got caught by the Snatchers, and Hermione disfigured my face, I took your wand from you. Then I gained control of the Elder Wand."
Pansy loved the plan; as did Hermione. Blaise had added suggestions to the plan and improved it bit by bit until it was deemed flawless.
Draco stumbled over to it, nearly falling over his legs; they'd fallen asleep while he'd been reading to Viv. He examined the mandrake carefully, holding samples of the potion, uncorked, around it. It didn't move towards them at all.
Draco nodded. It would help to have his godfather there; Severus had always been a mentor for him, especially in potions.
- on the last one, the furthest to the left, he found one. It split the window in half, and was easily big enough for a person. "
Draco explained the rough basics of it before beginning to go into more specific details about what he'd discovered about the Dreamless Sleep potion, what he'd thought and theorised; both wizards nodded along as he spoke. "So I came here to ask if you know how to extract the Elixir of Life from the Philosopher's stone?" He paused, then added, "Or, just, how to make the Stone in general?"
"It was Weasley," he told Harry, pointing a finger back in the general direction of the group, who were all doubled over in hysterical laughter. Useless, moronic, pathetic, stupid,
Draco appeared to be an adequate teacher, and calming enough to successfully get even the constantly panicked Potter to learn a few breathing techniques. So, he'd succeeded.
! One was skintight, with a slit up the right-hand side, in a gorgeous lush green; the second was softer, looser, a pretty pastel pink with a bow around the waistband and lace trimmings at the bottom and many poofy layers of tulle. He admired them both, glanced up to see Harry's eyes on him, cautious, hopeful; Draco grinned and ran out of the hall.
Draco stood drew his wand with a flourish. Pansy, who had been stood behind Blaise, threw one last snowball at the back of his head before sprinting to hide behind the nearest tree; what good sense she had, Draco mused. Evidently, it was sense that Blaise had none of... He was still stood there, arms out placatingly, looking mortally terrified (and rightfully so) as Draco twirled his wand, and behind him rose a fleet of perfectly round, compact snowballs.
Harry came and sat next to Draco, grinning, and picked up his hot chocolate. "Magical, isn't it," he said.
Draco jumped as a sort of roar emanated from the teachers' snowball fight, followed by an almighty splash, and every single person out in the snow froze, looking to see what had happened.
- for at least a year, to see how he was; his mother, in concern, Blaise and Pansy, too; Potter, because he thought Draco was up to something. (And, okay, maybe he
Just as they neared the portrait for the Slytherin dungeons, Draco whirled around, wand bared and eyes glinting dangerously. The Slytherins were shoved up against a wall and restrained, ropes flying around them. At the same time, their wands all flew up out of their robes and into Draco's waiting hands. He caught one of them looking surprised, and asked, "
He returned to the classroom a few minutes later, tentatively stroking the spine of the Monster Book of Monsters Hagrid had had them buy for his year of teaching Care of Magical creatures. When the beast seemed to have calmed a little, Draco flicked through its pages carefully until he found the passage he was looking for.
Draco headed out, back through the wall, resigning himself to waiting out there until Potter woke up.
Draco strode into the Gryffindor common room confidently, head held high. "Granger!" he called, scanning the room. He was shoved up against a wall by a blur of red; Weasley had pinned him to the wall. Oh, look at that. He had his wand at Draco's neck.
Draco had asked Harry for a fresh start; unfortunately, that wasn't wholly possible with both of them waking up from nightmares every other night, waking the other up with their struggling, and the nightmares being about the past.
He picked up his silver knife- sharpened razor-thin- and took a deep breath. He held Viv's main stem still as he carefully- oh so carefully- cut off the largest of her leaves. She started wailing, but Draco couldn't wait and calm her; her biological structure and adaptations meant that any of the plant left exposed to the air would seal itself up quickly. Including the bit of plant Draco was holding. He knew Viv would be fine.
A bit late, I know, I know, but we're nearing the end now! Merry late Christmas to you all and thank you!
He looked up as Zabini and Parkinson dusted off their robes. The house emerged before him, a looming grey wall of foreboding.
"Why did your wand just nearly take my nose off?!" She asked. Potter sat there, holding Draco's wand in his hand, looking rather guilty. He hurriedly hid the wand behind his back, putting on the worst
At first, all Draco could see was black. All he could feel was the rush of the wind, whipping wildly at his hair, his clothes, his skin; tearing at him as he fell, like when he fell from his broom in Quidditch. Harry's arms were still wrapped around him from when he steadied him; now, they tightened, hugging Draco close.
It had barely even been five minutes when a head of messy black hair rounded the corner. Draco raised an eyebrow. "Couldn't even leave me alone for five minutes, Potter?" There was a strange, slight flush creeping up Potter's neck.
He lost his grip on the tree and went rolling down the hill, head-over-heels. He rolled to a stop at the feet of none other than Harry
"Yeah, I pretty much knew that." Except for the part about Harry Potter murdering a teacher at age- what,
The other is the opposite; snow-white hair, gelled back in a sweeping wave, matched with a smooth, pale, flawless complexion, rosy lips and cheeks and icy blue eyes- like the human incarnation of winter. He seems cold, too; his clothes are immaculate and harsh. He radiates confidence, from his posture and his clothes to the way that he is so comfortable in the situation.
The eighth-years all congregated in the Great Hall. Their curfew was far later than everyone else's, so they called for some hot drinks from the elves. As they warmed their frozen hands and feet, they discussed in their small groups what they would be doing for Christmas. A large portion of them were staying at Hogwarts, far more than usual; especially the Slytherins, and others who might want to avoid their homes. Draco, Pansy, and Blaise were planning to stay for Christmas for the first time ever. Harry was staying too, obviously, and Hermione and Ron had decided to stay with him. Draco heard Longbottom was staying, and he said that Luna was staying too. Good. Draco had gotten her a present, too, and wanted to see her reaction when she opened it. When he said as much to the group. Longbottom immediately turned on him and said, "You better not give her anything bad, Malfoy, or I'll- I'll hex you!"
The foolish witches and wizards who admired him and his neverending Gryffindor bravery never knew this, of course. They remained clueless, innocent. They continued to praise him. Even as he locked himself away from the world, speaking only occasionally with Kreacher, or writing for birthdays and other occasions. Apart from that, Harry Potter virtually disappeared. He blocked Grimmauld Place off from his friends, from those he'd learned to call his family; he received countless messages and gifts of thanks, which he burned. Why should he be thankful for the deaths of so many?
Draco blushed bright pink. It looked far too much like what he'd seen in the Mirror of Erised. Beside him, Harry was blushing again too... But neither of them made any move to change the snowmen.
Draco waved him off. "I put up spells around them to monitor them, and they've all been moved to our new location."
Maybe they're seen holding hands at one point. Maybe the newspaper article publishers are blackmailed by the boys' friends not to publish anything about it before the boys are ready, and risk tearing this fragile new relationship apart before it has even really begun.
Draco watched Harry carefully. He'd moved so quickly, Draco hadn't even registered it until he was pinned against the wall by his throat.
for him, huh? Well, that's hardly enough. C'mon, 'Mione's occupying Blaise and Ron, let's go get him something
Harry opened his mouth, then shut it, staring at Draco. Then said, "Honestly, Draco, didn't you learn? If you need something, just
Draco had decided, after falling over Potter Merlin-knew-how-many-times on the way up the stairs, he would try and make peace with Potter so the next five months might actually be bearable already, though, so this was just encouragement.
"Um- the room that the- the fiendfyre was in is still unusable, but the rest of the Room of Requirement is perfectly fine. It's the most secluded place in Hogwarts, anyway, and really the only place I could speak about this thing."
He leapt up to the lowest branch- which snapped, and Draco fell back down onto the ground. Blaise had turned red from laughter, and it seemed that Ronald might drop off the branch from laughing. Draco stood up and sniffed, dusting the snow from his clothes, before jumping up to catch a sturdier branch. This one held his weight, and he swung up to sit on it. Being an intelligent wizard, he immediately cast a cushioning charm beneath himself (something that Ronald had
"A broom!" he shouted aloud. Somehow, Harry heard him over the whistle of the wind; comprehension spread across his face. He was already holding his wand- still lit with Lumos- and pointed it straight up, behind Draco's back.
Draco remembered, with a jolt of fear, the winter of first year, when those Weasley twins had enchanted snowballs to repeatedly hit Quirrell in the back of the head- where Voldemort had been residing, apparently... and when Draco himself had joined in, seeing how much fun they were having. Whoops.
. Of course he wouldn't be able to come back and carry on as if nothing had happened (no matter what the press and the wizarding community thought). And while he did have flashbacks, people could now start to bring him back; and if someone got too close too fast, he'd jump away and pull out his wand, but wouldn't shoot. He was improving.
Draco was miserable, having had nearly no sleep the previous night. Pansy and Blaise, thankfully, picked up on this, and were silent as the trio made their rounds of the grounds, letting Draco clear his mind as he wished. Then, the white noise of Hogwarts erupted in a cacophony of chaos, drawing the three's attention. "I bet you 10 galleons it's Potter," Draco said monotonically.
"I- I-m not scared of you! You can't just go an- and show your- your mark off and expect people to just- just give you what you want! You won't hurt Harry Potter!" Draco half-recognised the small boy as Colin Creevey's little brother, was reminded of Dobby, and then was hit by what the boy said.
"Well- just try to- I don't know, name them? Like, the person you were around your father as opposed to who you were around Harry or me as opposed to how you were in class, in tests, as opposed to how you were with, say, Pansy and Blaise. And then, once you've named them- or maybe at the same time- list them? Maybe it would help you see who you are now if you see who you were before."
Panicking, Harry looked around him- the sky was far lighter than it was higher up; were they nearing the ground?- before trying one last time.
way. Make it fall-" she moved the entire severed section to the other side of the tree, away from the Hogsmeade path and over a snowy hill- "
Everyone laughed as Slughorn backed slowly towards the castle, then began to run as the other teachers followed him.
that untrustworthy? ...Well, yes, but that's not the point. Honestly, you do one thing once and no one lets you forget it. Was that what it was like to be Potter? Draco hated it.
The three made their way back to Hogwarts at a leisurely pace; the noise wasn't dying down, and didn't seem like it would for a while.
Draco was going to politely introduce himself, apologise for intruding, and explain his circumstances and ask for Nicholas Flamel when Potter (very rudely) burst out with, "You can see us?"
Draco made his way downstairs cautiously.` On the wall of the entryway hall, a large blanket had been thrown off to reveal a portrait- the source of the screeching. The label read
Potter had sunk into one of the chairs, his legs curled up onto the chair. He was leaning against one of the armrests, staring into the fire. Draco made his way over, and sat on the chairs as he'd been taught to- back straight, legs out in front of him, hands folded, head high. Or, well, he tried to. The chair seemed designed to make you comfortable, and Draco was embraced by the soft cushions. He felt like he was being given a warm hug. Deciding that this was
He walked over to where the family tapestry hung on the wall, a few scorch marks of disappointing children burned off across the fabric. Near the end, he saw his own little portrait.
stand for that, so he raises his head a little more, meets Potter's gaze with a glare, and runs his hand down the length of the snake's spine, forcing his muscles to relax and his lungs to start working. And his breaths aren't even, and his spine is too straight to be relaxed, but he is holding-
An older-looking house elf said, "The wand was originally belonging to Harry Potter, but now it has allegiance to both Young Master Draco and Harry Potter."
Oh. Well that was unexpected. Draco frowned; he hadn't really thought about it. "Well, yeah, I guess so. I felt... I felt good. Especially with the make-up and all," he said.
When they left, they found that snow had begun to fall; just a light dusting of it, the sort of lovely fluffy flakes that landed on your nose and hair like a thin second layer. Weasley spun around in the snow, delighted, and with the help of Blaise, managed to collect enough snow to make a snowball and throw it at Hermione. Pansy and Draco stood back and laughed as she chased them. Her bushy, snow-covered hair would have made her seem almost comical as she stormed after them, if not for the slight terror that arose in Draco when she turned on him for laughing at her. He cowered behind Pansy, who laughed at him... Until Weasley hit her in the face with a snowball.
"This time round, pick five large, noticeable objects in the room. Make them as unique to this one room as possible. So the sofa here, which isn't in any other room, is a good choice. Touch your objects as you go past them. Done?" Potter nodded. "Right. Now, come sit here," Draco said, shuffling over so Potter could sit on the sofa with him, "And imagine this room. The walls, the boundaries; don't go any further. Just this one room.
Hermione opened her present and got her quill and paperweight; she immediately set about writing something or other in the Never-Ending Notebook she'd received from Harry.
? Even a small attempt? Draco imagined any comb too flimsy would just break if Potter even attempted to tame that wild nest now.
- "I also saw this- you wrote in a notebook of some sort and you were writing about- uh- Dreamless sleep and death. And I just- I was wondering... What was that?"
The boys entered the office together about five minutes later, grumbling at each other and both nursing many bruises.
Draco's shields wouldn't last much longer; especially not with Draco sleep-deprived, stressed and already weakened by fear. Something needed to happen for the two to escape with their lives.
McGonagall was letting him do all this experimenting because she didn't like the victims of the war having nightmares so much; if he told her he thought he'd made progress, he was sure she'd go easy on him. Not that McGonagall ever went easy on anybody.
"No, you dimwit, I'm not going down there. You need to figure out how to get out. I told you you shouldn't have-"
Draco rose into the air. It was calm today; the winds were slow and warm, barely a brush against his cheek or a rustle of his equipment. His broom was warm under his hands, waiting for his commands. The ground slowly got smaller and more indistinct below him as he rose higher, the air cooling a few degrees. When he was so high he couldn't see the Hogwarts courtyard well enough to distinguish it from the section of roof over the Great Hall, he stopped.
"Right. I think even I could teach you better than that; the bar's pretty low. And now there's no stress of anyone dying, it's just to stop nightmares until the potion's ready."
Draco seated himself, grabbing an apple and resting his chin on his hands as he continued to observe. People-watching was one of his favourite pastimes; one that was well-developed after years and years of practice.
"Me, too," Potter murmured. "I hate you, Malfoy," he said, but it seemed like he was trying to convince himself; none of his usual vigor or passion was really there. When he realised this, his face drained of colour.
He turned away from Harry and sprinted down the corridor, not registering Harry's shouts for him to "Wait, Draco!" in his haste to find out just how screwed he was.
He tried again. "Pygmy Puffs. Pygmy Puffs! Fluffy little pygmy puffs! Pink pygmy puffs, purple pygmy puffs, blue pygmy puffs- oh, Salazar, we're stuck."
In all honesty, Draco had actually been considering giving Harry a present; especially now that they weren't proper enemies like before. In any case, Blaise had been lying about most of the presents; Draco had never even considered giving Harry the Malfoy heirloom, and the Flame had been for a Beauxbaton student to take back to France and give to an acquaintance of Draco's as a present. It was just
He seemed to know that Draco couldn't escape, too. He started off towards the living room- where he had presumably stepped out of the fireplace- beckoning for Draco to follow him.
McGonagall, sat at her desk, spoke up. "I'm going to pretend not to have heard any of this conversation. I am also going to pretend not to have told you that Filch won't be roaming the castle tonight, and neither will Mrs. Norris."
Potter didn't spare him a glance, but shouted, "What are you doing?" as Draco cast the spell again. And again, until the two were surrounded by a writhing mass of serpents.
He didn't notice how much lighter the cauldrons seemed as he arranged them; he didn't realise that there was more than just his magic arranging everything.
didn't envy him and what he'd had to do- he'd learned about all that while the Golden Trio attempted to piece Potter back together.
He'd been flying the two- himself and Draco- upwards, into the wind, towards the sky, hoping he could be fast enough to escape the potion before- before- he didn't even know what would happen if they didn't get out, actually. He knew it was bad from the way Draco had reacted to the sky turning red, from the panic in his voice when he'd shouted for a broom. Before he'd joined Draco in the potion, he'd watched Draco prepare and enter it; Harry hadn't seen the exact warning on the parchment where Draco had written the instructions. He hadn't taken the time to read the new writing that appeared once Draco had disappeared, either; he'd gone in headfirst and unprepared, as per usual. If Hermione had been there, she would've given him that exasperated look she'd perfected for Harry and Ron over the years. When Harry succeeded nonetheless- he always had done- she'd always rolled her eyes and berated him for his lack of a plan. So Harry had to get out of here, or he probably wouldn't get to see Hermione do that ever again.
The breathing technique Draco uses actually works; some sciencey stuff makes it release calming chemicals from the brain. It's good to help calm yourself down; just repeat the exercise a few times over if you're stressed.
"Swedish Fish," Potter told the gargoyle hiding the headmistress' office. It moved aside with a terrible screeching sound, revealing a long staircase. The two ascended at different paces; Potter was trying to take the steps three at a time, while Draco tried to take them one at a time. This resulted in the two tumbling over almost immediately. Draco wouldn't physically survive five months of this. He doubted he would stand five days.
He had flashbacks, too. All of them did, but Harry's were probably the worst. He'd be lying in bed in Grimmauld Place, and then all of a sudden he wasn't- he was on the floor in the forest, and there was Voldemort- when anyone tried to touch him, bring him back, he'd shoot a spell at them, convinced it was a Death Eater. His friends learned this the hard way. Once Harry was in a panic attack, only he could get himself out.
Before he could get in a comment about spending time with Gryffindors lowering her intelligence, she sat down, put on her "I'm a little worried but don't want to show a human emotion in public" face, and asked quietly, "Are you alright, Draco?"
Draco pointed it out to Potter, and they started making their way down the hill. About a third of the way down, Potter muttered, "Oh, I'm done with this," lay down, and went rolling down the hill. Draco watched, incredulous, at Potter's absolute lack of care for his clothes and his honour... although he
He set down the base potion he'd practiced making over and over; made sure it was the right temperature, and cast a stasis spell over it. This next bit was the most meticulous.
They indulged themselves in the newest and best toys the store had to offer, then moved onto Honeydukes, where the group found Hermione and Blaise. (Hermione, it turned out, had bought
After a long trek up moving, winding staircases, Draco encountered his newest problem. The gargoyle that guarded the entryway to the Headmaster's office. And Draco didn't know the password. He was certain he didn't know enough about McGonagall to even attempt to guess the answer, so he sank down onto the floor to wait for someone to come by.
"Not bad," Hermione said as she passed him. "But still, loosen up a bit more. You're frowning at it like it's a bad test result."
First things first- where had Draco gone? Where would he have gone? Somewhere away from Harry, somewhere he thought Harry couldn't find him... Somewhere under a Fidelius charm, then? Unplottable, too. Being who he was, he probably wanted comfort... His father was in Azkaban, and his mother was at Malfoy Manor, where Draco would know Harry would go to look. So Harry mentally crossed Malfoy Manor off the list of places Draco could be.
The trio didn't start talking until they were out of the castle, headed towards the forest. Through the trees, Draco could see his
He and Potter didn't get to bed until after the tenth potion exploded. The eleventh, however, wasn't anywhere near as bad, and Draco deemed it passable.

Potter started defending himself from the suspicions clearly forming on McGonagall's face; she'd seen Draco in the Great Hall for lunch, and was absolutely observant enough to figure out what had happened.
facade Draco had ever seen. Pansy's glare landed on Potter and she narrowed her eyes and marched over to him. In an attempt to remove the condemning evidence from himself, Potter held the wand out to Draco behind his back. Draco took it; as he did, his fingers brushed Potter's. Pansy saw this, and shouted, "
"Oh, don't worry. I have everything I want already." Harry waved the student off, murmuring, "Or nearly," after they passed through the doors. Draco stepped out from behind the column where he'd been hiding.
"Actually, it was instrumental in killing Voldemort. In that final battle between us, he had the physical Elder Wand, but I had its allegiance. He tried to kill me with it, but couldn't, because the wand didn't obey him, it obeyed me, and it refused to kill me. Hey, Malfoy, if you hadn't disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy tower I would've died."
"Occlumency is the act- or the ability- of having complete control over your emotions and your mind, as a general definition. You can use it to repel Legilimens and other mind-infiltrating powers; others might use it as a method of meditation or to control anger or fear or sadness.
"As if," Harry replied, but there was the slightest note of doubt in his voice. Obviously he hadn't read
"Why would I lie to you, Ron? And we know the Imperius curse doesn't work on me." There was a pause, and then Weasley seemed to visibly deflate.
Harry said, "Well, a person who has asked me not to reveal their identity sent me these last night. They're Dreamless Sleep potions, except not addictive."
The group spent a long time in there, each getting individually lost in the aisles of sugary heaven. When nobody was looking, Draco dashed into the Post Office to wrap Harry's present. He made sure it was all safe and secure before he sent it off to his dormitory, made sure that the little snow globe wouldn't break. When he emerged, he looked around cautiously before stepping outside. Pansy somehow saw him anyways, and gave him a knowing look. "So the snowglobe
As Pansy stood next to Draco, admiring the newest additions to the board and seeing if Snape had added anything, she let her eyes flicker over to the Record. The eighth-year boys in Slytherin had had a sleepover last night; it wasn't a surprise that the time went up. It

Draco knew this from years of observation and seven years of friendship respectively; for the first, slightly flushed cheeks, almost indistinguishable from their usual dark shade, fidgety, fiddling hands and a tapping foot, eyes darting nervously around, pushing round glasses up their nose, and chewing on their bottom lip were all obvious tells of embarrassment. For the second, the smirk was wider than the usual sardonic one, the right side pulled up ever so slightly more, the chin was tilted up defiantly to look down the nose at the other even though they were several inches shorter.
"Right, you're doing well. Now, go and do the same for all the other rooms. Five large, unique items and the room they're in. Travel the path of this room into the next, and once you've done a room, return to here with your first five objects and make sure you remember them all, and then go through your house in your mind again, always walking the same path. I'll just be in the other room if you need me."
Pansy looked back at them with a grin, ignoring the general disgust of the onlookers, and said, "Yeah, sour-grapes. Lighten up. C'mon, 'Mione has ideas for what you can get Potter-" Wait, since when was Granger "'
He didn't hear Malfoy's sharp intake of breath next to him, didn't see how the hand he'd been reaching towards Harry jerked away.
"Wait!" Draco shouted, scrambling to his feet and pointing a finger at Potter. "If you- if you had control of all the Hallows- that means- that means you would've been the- the Master of Death!"
"In the potion, I think it acts as a healing ingredient to combat the deadly ingredients. So, since I'm making a potion of Dreamless sleep that isn't addictive-" Draco saw the Gryffindor portrait swinging open and nobody stepping outside; he remembered Potter telling him about his invisibility cloak. Oh well. Telling Granger meant Potter would find out one way or another, anyway. "I decided to take out the unicorn blood. That obviously killed the subject-"
And while witches and wizards of all ages told their children and their friends the great tale of the Saviour of the Wizarding World in all his glory and flawless grace, Harry himself was probably more broken and flawed than anybody else those ignorant wizards knew.
"Did you know," Draco said, kneeling down next to Harry, "I was once chased by a flock of multicoloured chickens?"
; the most high-maintenance plant he had, and the most likely to cause a problem, especially with Draco away. While most of his other sentient plants had taken to Potter after a day or so, the
Well, they'd been going to talk about this anyway. Still- the tension in the air was palpable. Potter was staring, mortified, at Draco's chest, where the rest of the scars lay hidden by his shirt.
He didn't land on his feet; instead he attempted to roll as he landed. He realised, as he tried this, that he had landed on a hill. And he was rolling down it.
Granger threw her hands up in silent protest and anger, then muttered, "Fine. Guess I'll just stick everything."
Harry hadn't blocked Draco out of Grimmauld Place. Only people he thought would come knocking, and reporters. He hadn't expected Draco to show up on his doorstep one late October evening, half a year after the War, looking stern-faced and smug as always. From the moment Harry opened the door, he knew his life of solitude was over.
That's what made Draco look up, almost guilty at having been caught reading children's books to a plant. "Um... Nothing," he said, hiding the book behind his back. Harry grinned at him in a sort of "You're hopeless," kind of way. Before he could say anything, Draco saw movement at the edge of his peripheral. His eyes shot to it; the mandrake, seeming to stretch in the sun. It was awake.
. He didn't confirm any of her suspicions- obviously- but in Potter's arms, seeing him as a strong, young- admittedly handsome- man rather than a childhood nemesis, Draco saw how he could have.
, Draco knows where this is going, she has used that tone of voice on him only twice before- once when she tried to get him to reconcile with that species of big, ugly chickens- Hippogriffs- and again when she tried to get him to face his boggart. Draco refused adamantly, and it had led to two of their biggest fights ever.
"Harry?" Draco asked, opening the door again. "Harry, I've finished the sandwich, you can come out now," he said. No one answered.
above the water, but heavenly underneath. Draco dreaded hearing the first time Blaise would play it- presumably above water, where any
"Well, this is hardly any fun," he heard Pansy say from below him. "Draco isn't the slightest bit afraid."
He raced back up the stairs, panting, and slid down onto the floor beside his bed as quietly as he could. He reached under the bed, feeling around for- there it was. He pulled out his Firebolt, still in good condition, and hurried back down to the common room. He was entirely unaware of the five pairs of eyes watching him, having been woken up by Hermione's wards she'd set to notify them whenever Harry left bed at night.
Parkinson stepped up to the door first; she opened it with a flick of her wand. The group entered silently, avoiding the portrait of Walburga Black, making their way into the living room- well, they started to, but Parkinson and Hermione (leading the group) both stopped in the doorway so abruptly that Ron walked into Zabini. "Bloody hell," Ron muttered. Parkinson and Hermione immediately turned around and shushed him, then tiptoed further into the living room. So they were being quiet, then? Okay.
song, no less. Merlin, Draco had fallen. It was true, though; life really didn't discriminate. It hadn't take pity on Draco when he'd been tormenting Potter for the fun of it, because he was supposed to; hadn't taken pity on him when he'd been under death threat from Voldemort himself to commit murder; hadn't pitied him when a giant bloody chicken had mauled his arm in year- oh, who
"I came to come and see how you were doing and make sure neither of you were dead, but... I believe I should be more concerned that neither of you are, nor any of your plants."
"Well, they're used in the Dreamless sleep potion. Closest thing to flowers I had on hand, and I wanted something to distract you so I could get you out here to talk about Flamel."
"Come in," McGonagall said before Draco had even knocked. He opened the door and stepped inside. "Ah, Mr. Malfoy. What is it?" She was sat at the larger wooden desk, the phoenix perched next to her. She set down a stack of papers she was reading as Draco stepped further into the room.
seven times as you withdrew the Elixir from the liquid; no more, no less, or the potion would lose all magical properties.
"Sums up your personality pretty well, I think. Oh, you were mad at him sixth year. You didn't get him a present. Seventh year you had a voice recording of the Slytherins singing Weasley is Our King, with you conducting. To cheer him up, you said. Merlin, Draco, what will it be this year? A love declaration?"
Could Draco have said it better? Gryffindors, honestly. Draco sighed. "Alright, Potter. You blink when you're confused. You get quiet after a nightmare. You trace your scars when remembering them or what gave you them. Whenever someone mentions something you don't like, you close off completely- it's actually a little scary. When someone brings up a dead person who fought for you, you turn your head a little to the left, like you're trying to turn away from the conversation. You're almost always looking over your shoulder, and when you go round a blind corner, you hesitate a moment. You stand in your duelling position, with your left foot in front of your right-" and Draco cut himself off there, because he was revealing that he knew far too much about Potter, and
The eighth years rose, the Hall silent for them in respect for what they'd done to bring about the nightmares. They all took a bottle from Harry with a quiet, "Thank you," before returning to their seats. When it was Draco's turn, he only pretended to take a bottle; he had many more stashed away in the Room of Requirement, and he didn't want to take someone else's potion. He and Harry shared a small, secret glance before Draco turned away and returned to his seat next to Pansy, who'd already taken her potion.
After half an hour of failed attempts to catch Slughorn (he seemed unusually good at hiding himself in the snowy landscape), McGonagall declared the rest of the day's lessons off; after all, it was the first snow of the year. She reminded everyone to be inside for curfew, then retreated to the castle for "a nice cup of tea and maybe a biscuit". Draco thought that that sounded wonderful, and was about to follow her inside when Jisky appeared next to him. "The Stone has melted," she said.
Cloudy, too; the moon's light was diluted and the stars were invisible. Perhaps he'd go to bed afterwards, instead of returning to the potions room. He could leave the wards up, and return to work all of tomorrow; he'd done all of his homework but his Transfiguration essay, and he'd half-arsed that already, it just needed some editing.
A jolt of cold shot up his arm when he let go, and he immediately missed the warmth of Harry's hand; it'd become so normal in his life. He shivered, and saw Harry was doing the same, holding his hand close to his chest to try and warm it up.
"Well, the Resurrection stone. It does only bring back a spectral version of the person, but... Well, you're Nicholas Flamel. Surely you could come up with a way to make it permanent and full."
"Well, you see, Harry's gone missing-" Ron managed to get out before both Hermione and McGonagall interrupted him.
, of course. Third year- a poster of Sirius Black. Fourth year- a portion of the flame from the Cup...
, Pans-" The Slytherin table, and Snape up at the teacher's table, as a whole, pushed their plates aside and hit their heads on the table.
"My sentiments exactly." Draco stood up, dragging Potter with him. "Right, we're off. I can't get the ingredient needed to be collected by moonlight, but I can brew the rest of the potion up until it needs it. Come, Potter, and try not to get in the way
The door opened with the quiet chime of a bell, nearly drowned out by the animals' various squawks and squeals. It chimed again, a while later, and Draco left with a cage in his hands. He sent it back to his dorm room with a flick of his wand, concealing and protecting it with a few charms. The pet inside would be fine with its auto-replenishing food and water supply.
"A couple of weeks later, though, I heard him say he was going to sue someone at work; when I asked was suing was, he told me it was demanding recompense for being inconvenienced. Of course, I went around for the next couple of months asking my father to sue the birds, the fountain, and the fish; he ended up actually giving me some money to shut me up. And that," Draco concluded to a now grinning Harry (Mission accomplished, he thought triumphantly), "Is how I sued someone at three years old."
He thought of a room- a room where Harry's house was now stored- full of items; he thought of mountains of lost things, and of climbing one mountain, watching as flames leaped up at his ankles. He buried his head in the crook of Harry's neck as he thought of an image, burned forever into his mind; a cupboard, going up in flames, as one of his oldest friends watched him leave.
There was a perch, where a fully-feathered Fawkes trilled in greeting. On the desk was a considerably large jar on the desk, filled with- cat hairs?- and a box, which held a whole cat. Potter drew out a piece of parchment from his back pocket, muttered something at it, and opened it up. He frowned and said, "I don't understand. It says she's right here, on the desk."
Harry recoiled quickly, almost flinching away from Draco and what he'd nearly done. He looked down at his hands, horrified, and stumbled away from Draco, who was eyeing him warily and rubbing his throat. He dropped his wand and knelt down, burying his head in his hands.
Skipping straight to the subject, then, and not one question asked about the unconscious, floating Chosen One behind Draco. "Yes."
"So, Malfoy, look. A pair of footsteps represent one person. So here, this big black mass," he pointed to what was, indeed, a big black mass, with indecipherable scribbles and scrawls shown at its edges. "That's the Great Hall, with everyone in it. Up here is the teacher's table," he pointed to a rectangle, where a row of footsteps were individually labelled with names. "And we're over- here." He showed Draco two pairs of footsteps, stationary next to the water's edge. The labels read
"Yeah, look, here's the head, with a happy face," Pansy told him, pointing at the top snowball on her snowman, who did, indeed, have a smiley face drawn into him, "And these two are the body, and these sticks are the arms. Harry says you can make a big snowman, too, and put a scarf on it, but he didn't want to make a big one with you and Ronald rolling around making snow angels," she added.
Potter set off, headed for the kitchens, and Draco retreated to the potions room, where Viv had started crying. As he hushed her, he heard a cry from the House (as he had dubbed the adjoining space). Potter stumbled out of the room a little later, holding a trunk. Oh, so he'd found that, too. Good. It'd taken Draco a while to find it, and it'd been a pain to haul it from the outskirts of Hogwarts to the Room of Requirement, but Potter was very clearly happy with it. He hugged it tight, held Draco's eyes confidently, even as his voice broke as he told him, almost reverently, "Thank you."
"Voldemort- Quirrell- was trying to get the stone, too, and it was down there, but he couldn't find it. He made me look in the Mirror. I saw myself, and mirror-me put the stone into my pocket. When I went to put my hand in my pocket in real life, the stone was there. Dumbledore had enchanted it so it could be taken out of the Mirror, but only by someone who didn't intend to use the Stone for themselves. That's why Quirrell couldn't get it.
Immediately, Draco began to protest, but his voice was swallowed up by the unbelievably loud reaction from the crowd- for the most part, just one big, unanimous groan. Not at Harry Potter himself, no; at the mention of
He made his way down the shore leisurely, calm and level-headed after all the meditative exercises he'd done. His head did hurt a little- he'd forced a lot of information into it in a very short amount of time- but he was glad he'd found a personal use for this technique other than meditation.
So he faced death with open arms, waiting to see his parents, Sirius, Remus, Hedwig, so many more; everyone he'd lost. He'd found Dumbledore. And chose to return.
physical. Potter, try walking through the walls, like you do at Platform 9 3/4. Maybe you'll get in." This relied on Potter's utter lack of intelligence, and also his never-ending supply of trust for others.
was recording him, too. Harry, up in the Gryffindor dormitory, didn't hear a group of Gryffindors gasp in disbelief moments later, too absorbed in telling Ginny what had happened.
Maybe it contains pictures of the boy's deceased parents and their dearest friends; maybe the boy cries a little when he sees it.
snitch!" He called. That was sure to work. Might take a while, though. He draped himself over his broom, sending the case of Quidditch balls back into the shed and shutting the door with a flick of his wand. Just as he turned around to take a lap of the pitch, a small golden ball flew up to his face. "Whoa!" he cried.
Draco opened his mouth in outrage to protest, but Pansy quietly silenced him before he could cause a disruption.
be concerned for the git's health. (In his head, Hermione was giving him the Look again. Well, she could shut up, 'cause she was wrong.)
So Draco stood, abruptly, stepping away from the glass that showed him things that weren't true; stepped into
He rolled down the rest of the hills, levitating his robes behind him so as to not get tangled up in them again, finally coming to a stop on the plains. Potter rolled down beside him, and stood, staring at the cabin with him. By now the full moon had risen and hung nearly overhead; the cabin's lights were out, and no smoke emerged from the chimney. The curtains were drawn, the door shut firmly, and Draco could feel that the magic in the wards were stronger.
They walked into the Great Hall holding hands properly, and this time the uproar and the warmth in Draco's hand brought a smile to his face.
She glowered. "I am glad to hear you are well, but I, myself, am struggling. Not only have I and this house been abandoned- we have been taken up by- by mudbloods and blood-traitors and- even worse- Gryffindors. How could this have happened? Draco, why did you and your mother let this happen? That traitor of a son- Sirius-" She spat his name out like it was poisonous- "Has entirely disregarded his heritage, his family- me! And then that godson of his, the Potter boy-" Draco stiffened. Potter?
Potter adjusted his stance slightly; his left foot moved backwards and pivoted him so he was facing the forest. He raised his wand, too, crouched down but head up, eyes trained on the pack. When he spoke, his voice was quiet but strong.
"Alright, boys, settle down," Dumbledore said with a chuckle. "So, what are you doing next? Something to do with the Deathly Hallows, I assume?"
Potter scowled. "Yeah, I do, but Snape tried to teach me in Fifth year, and he did such a terrible job that my Godfather ended up dead."
Instead, he turns to Pansy, who will no doubt be slightly more sympathetic, and says, "He has a snake." Pansy raises an eyebrow. "And? So does the zoo down the road. So do about a third of the Slytherins. So did-" and then she freezes, and Draco watches realisation sweep across her face.

Maybe the friends- who have become mutual friends of the two boys during their plotting to get them together- plan a joint party. Maybe they the boys are a little shy as the presents are presented. Maybe they are given the only thing they

. I bet she even has them on her feet. And she's, like, pasty pale. I, on the other hand, am creamy-skinned. Don't you think?"
"-can make you eat a red apple. How distracted were you to pick one? And to eat half of it without noticing?" Draco could tell she was about to pick up on the fact that he'd been people-watching her. She hated when he did that; she said he knew her far too well already. So he changed the subject.
Harry had sighed. He'd known this was coming, but had still hoped to avoid it. "Yeah, I guess so. Where do we start?"
Pansy grinned and explained them to him proudly; Hermione watched on, clearly entertained by the purebloods' collective lack of knowledge in this area, while Blaise went to get them all hot chocolate. Harry took Malfoy aside, where there was lots of fresh snow, and showed him how to make the snowball big enough to be a proper snowman. Draco made one about the side of his own head while Harry made one about three times the size to be the body. Draco bit his lip in concentration as he placed the head on the body. Harry sent him off searching for sticks to use as arms while Hermione accio-ed a scarf she'd knitted to go around the snowman's "neck", and Harry went down to the shores of the Black Lake. He returned with two large black pebbles and a handful of little grey and black ones; he put the two large ones into the face as eyes, then arranged the small pebbles in a smile. "Now all we need is a carrot," he said.
He changed for others; he changed for certain circumstances; he changed for himself. "Malfoys must learn to adapt," his father told him.
"It's for a really good cause, Harry. He won't tell you because- wait, why won't you tell him? You knew I'd tell him, but you told me-"
"So my lucky parents were able to behold the wonderful sight of me running, screaming, from a flock of very colourful exotic birds- flamingos, peacocks, parrots and toucans; the whole lot. And poor me was leading the flock. I glanced behind me when one of the faster birds nipped at my heel; I kept looking behind me, even as I ran. I veered off the main path and into a rather shallow ditch in our garden. But that's not the worst part.
Draco was shaking his head before Potter even finished his sentence. "No, Potter. Go to McGonagall if you want confirmation I'm not trying to poison anyone, but I'm not answering that question. I can't afford to let any information out at all, especially not to people who would tell their friends who would tell the rest of the school. So no, I won't answer your question. Sorry." He stood, returned his chair to a leaf, and turned to leave. "Don't go jumping to conclusions, though. Really, you can ask McGonagall. I don't have some- some nefarious plan or anything, Potter." And with that, he turned and strode away from Potter without even a glance back.
Potter went ahead of him; about halfway there, he froze. He was staring at something in the forest, far enough away that Draco couldn't see. He made his way over to Potter; when he saw what Potter had, he froze, too.
He scanned the room for Pansy's short black bob, listening for Blaise's baritone voice or either of their sassiness. He began to frown as his eyes passed over the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables with no result. He almost didn't look down Gryffindor- what would Blaise and Pansy even be doing at a table of lions?- but the internal need to sit with company he could have an intelligent conversation was too strong. He just glanced over the table, and had to do a double-take when he spotted Potter's nest of black hair.
The cottage was small, cosy, sweet; a plume of smoke rose from its chimney. It was only two stories tall. Its windows were alight, the curtains parted. The walls were a soft beige, the roof slatted rows of weathered stone. The door, too, looked weathered. It was wooden, with little lines and knobbles from whatever tree it was grown; softened over the years.
Flamel clapped his hands and rose from his chair in front of the fireplace. "Lovely, just lovely. Yes, I have the recipe for my Stone just over here-" he walked over to the mantelpiece and picked up a framed photo; he took out the photo and showed Draco the recipe on the back. It was a messily-written list of ingredients followed by a method; Draco stepped forwards to take a cursory glance over it and Flamel snatched it back. "The Resurrection Stone, please," he said, holding out his hand. Draco went to reach into his pocket and withdraw the Stone when he realised- he didn't have it. Potter did.
When the potion was finally done (the same colour as it was usually, thank Merlin) Draco took the smallest sample- only a drop- and put it on a small Mandrake test sample. It fell asleep quickly, which was a good sign, but Draco wouldn't be able to tell if the potion had worked entirely until the next morning. Harry summoned the snake's cage from the classroom and led Draco into his childhood home here in the Room; he and Draco both took separate bedrooms to wait out the night.
It was a normal day in the Great Hall, where the Slytherins were sat eating breakfast, trying to block out the noise of Draco (who had not learned his lesson in the slightest) droning on about Potter.
Draco pulled Jisky over to a large bench (unused by the house elves, apparently). It was a slab of wood on a couple of mismatched wooden legs, and looked like it might fall over any minute. Draco sat Jisky down and started dashing around the room, looking out for apparating elves, collecting ingredients.
He modelled this outfit slower than he had the others, more delicately. He walked down the left side of the aisle, passing the group, who were silent, their faces painted with identical looks of awe. Harry's mouth was hanging open, Draco noted. He smiled to himself as he walked.
he shouted at himself mentally. As if to reinforce this, he spotted a werewolf over Potter's shoulder, quickly gaining on them; Draco suddenly realised that while Potter was running from the wolves (and doing surprisingly well, considering he was only human, after all), Draco himself was doing nothing. Immediately, he raised his wand, looking away from the wolves to focus his concentration on himself and Potter; he was useless at offensive magic, but his defensive was above average.
The eighth years gathered in the Great Hall again that night, discussing who might've made the potions. Harry was being badgered with questions, and had been for most of the day; everyone wanted to know who'd succeeded where so many others had failed. Harry had kept the truth from the school for most of the day, but now he was being asked by his closest friends, and Draco could tell he was close to cracking. He decided to just keep an eye on Harry to make sure he didn't say anything, but otherwise continued his hushed conversation with Pansy.
If Harry had happened to look over, for him the post-it note would've read, "Quidditch practice on Wednesday!" For everyone else, however, it read, "How long can you get Harry to talk about DM?" and underneath that, "Record: Over 7 hours".
So he'd just have to stop the breakdown before it started, no matter how hurt and slightly intimidated he was.
Pansy smirks and gives Potter an appraising look before continuing; "So, yes, you like playing the damsel in distress- where was I going with this? Oh, yeah- but did you really have to
"She's not venomous," Draco murmured to Harry. Harry reached out and unlatched the cage, slowly lowering his arm inside, hissing softly. The snake flickered its tongue at him and made its way up his arm to coil around his forearm; she was a baby at the moment, but she could grow to be two meters long.
Great green hills rose above to the left, slowly receding into the horizon. Behind them, acres of forest stretched out in a canopy of leaves and branch-laden undergrowth, full of winding paths and little dirt trails that criss-crossed all over the place. To the right, plains of tall golden wheat; and, situated in the middle of one such field, lay a cottage.
As Harry soared away from Gryffindor tower, McGonagall was sure to shoot a charm in the general vicinity of the window to stop anyone from shutting it, and closing Harry's way back in. She didn't, however, deflate the cushioning charms; this was Harry James Potter, and with his luck, he'd do brilliantly and not fall off his broom
The students all jolted backwards in shock, chairs scraping across the floor, while McGonagall moved slowly towards Harry. "Mr. Potter?"
because Potter is here. There hasn't even been a fight- although," he adds with a sly look at Draco, "That might just be because you're not down there."
Harry had been cooking lunch for everyone again, making something that smelled amazing, and Draco had been watching, begging for scraps. ("Like a bloody dog", as Ron had put it.) At some point, Harry just so casually said, "Draco, pass the salt." And everyone froze. Except Harry, who remained oblivious to what he'd just said. But in the living room, Hermione looked up from her book, Ron choked on air, a smile stretched over Molly's face, Ginny spat out her tea, and Fred had dropped the plates he'd been levitating over to the table. When they smashed, Harry turned around to find Draco looking at him with wide, silvery eyes sparkling in the afternoon sun, cheeks flushed and his pretty mouth agape. Harry wondered what had happened to make Draco look at him like that. Then he realised. And promptly fainted.
"Alright, I'll be going then. Oh, and Mr. Potter?" Potter glanced up from where Pansy and Blaise were still playing with the snake. "Thank you."
"Yeah," Potter replied calmly as Draco proceeded to have a mental meltdown. "Flamel wasn't all that into giving us the stone's recipe for nothing. He wanted something in return, so we ended up offering the Resurrection stone so he could resurrect his wife."
-) That's an exaggeration- (-and my skin would look terrible if I were to bruise, and I bruise like a peach.)) and no longer needs his father's approval, who can still give the cold shoulder or toss you a glare now he finally has something to sort of rely on ((Finally?) Well, we weren't together at this point, were we? (Potter, you're not the only person in my life, you know.) ...? (Okay, so
As soon as the word had left Potter's mouth, the pack leader advanced. The pack followed. Potter immediately whirled round and started sprinting off away from the pack.
"Well, I guess, but what if we told people who already knew about the Stone? And who knew about what you were doing?"
. You get all your shopping done a month before Christmas, and then you deliberate on buying a present for Potter- of all people,
Pansy offered to buy the dress for Draco, who let her do so happily. It was a hefty price, considering the group were in Hogsmeade. He'd told the others to go ahead, that he and Pansy would catch up, but Harry stayed behind. As they watched Pansy buying the dress, Draco heard Harry breathe in deeply, then say, "Did you like wearing the dress?"
one who acknowledged that these substitute teachers were idiots. "What will we be sticking together?"
It was just nearing the end of lunchtime when Draco was finally coaxed away from his work by the thought of a crisp green apple and something warm to drink. He made his way through the masses of students to the Great Hall and took his usual seat, expecting Pansy and Blaise to be there already. However, when he spotted his seat through the throng of students, he saw that the seats surrounding it were empty, though food was piled high on the plates before them.
Slowly, the Weasleys stopped coming daily. It was every other day, then once a week; then once a fortnight, once a month. They were, however, there for Draco's favourite moment of all time.
Above him, he heard a strangled shout of his name. What on earth? But he wouldn't let that distract him. After all, this was where he usually went wrong. He felt the lightening charm hit his body- so he was about a third of the way down.
for the ferret-faced git. He determined not to even think about Malfoy the rest of the day. Despite this, he still noticed that Malfoy wasn't in classes, and he continued to reassured himself with the conclusion that Malfoy was just skipping or something.
When they finally reached McGonagall's office, the sun had risen further, now peaking over the tops of the trees of the Forbidden Forest. Draco entered the office first. Severus behind him gave him a nod of greeting. Dumbledore wasn't in his portrait. McGonagall sat, wide awake and reading her papers again, at her desk. As Potter entered and immediately tripped over Draco, sending them both sprawling (and Severus sniggering from his portrait) McGonagall looked up. One glance at the boys and she waved her wand in the general direction of the cupboard to the left of the pensieve's one. Out of it flew two Pepperup potions; Draco tipped his head back and drank it immediately, blinking away his lingering tiredness. He made his way over to the pensieve cupboard, watched it float out slowly, Flamel's memory still lingering from yesterday. He didn't look over at Potter to see if he was ready before going face-first into the potion again.
Draco frowned, concentrating. He waved Blaise off in the direction of the door in dismissal, then scoured his memory for such a room. There weren't really any rooms near the library; Madam Pince hadn't wanted any noise near the room, and had insisted on one of the most isolated rooms in Hogwarts. Well, Draco supposed he could at least have a look around; but first he should probably apologise to McGonagall- wait!
Draco felt himself melting, and suddenly that Pansy he seemed to have in his mind spoke up- she said, "Doesn't seem like you hate him very much. In fact, I might even say you like him. Perhaps," she added, "as more than a friend." The fact that Draco didn't argue back was an answer enough for her.
The Map showed that there was, indeed, a room near the library. Two large, plain wooden doors were set seamlessly into the walls, so cohesive with the design of Hogwarts they didn't stand out at all.
It was the same blood-red the potion had been, slightly deeper than Harry remembered the first one being, but roughly the same size. It fit comfortably in his fist.
Draco, whose mind had been on trying to get the Elixir of Life, was sufficiently distracted. "That's the plan. Although it is a little shaky, what with the potion and all..."
They made their way up quietly. For all Draco's wit and joking at the base of the hill, where they were hidden from whatever lay on the other side of this hill, he was rather nervous. He was in foreign territory; he didn't know where he was or who else might be here, and while he trusted Potter with his life (he already owed him a life debt; how couldn't he?) and he knew Potter was more than capable of defending them both, Draco knew he was almost entirely incompetent in offense. He was unbelievably talented at defense, but if he was asked to attack... he just couldn't. He'd always been taught that the best form of offense was a good defense.
Draco leant back and listened to Potter rediscovering his childhood home when his eyes caught on the one thing he'd changed.
Harry Potter. It had turned out that the Potters had a cupboard under the stairs, too; and while theirs had been full of canned provisions- likely in case they'd needed to fully shut down to hide from Voldemort- Draco hadn't felt right leaving it in this remodelled home, a visual reminder of Potter's childhood abuse. Especially not with what Draco had designed this place for.
Malfoy frowned. It was a good offer, Harry knew; he hadn't been offered Slytherin for nothing. And Malfoy was visibly exhausted...
When they arrived at the clearing, Weasley glanced around at the floor, then pointed around the clearing and shouted, "
He made his way to the outskirts of Hogsmeade, over the edge of a snowy cliff. He remembered sitting here with Hermione; remembered Malfoy, being pelted by snowballs, and Harry playing with the strings of his hat. He smiled.
dress a while ago and was just waiting for Harry and Draco to stop talking) interrupted, pulling them out of the shop with an insistent, "We have to catch up with the others!"
Draco encountered an incredibly large library, too; when he tried to take a heavy tome from the shelf, though, another- even larger one- fell off the shelf, slamming into the floor.
"Er, you might want me to ask it in a bit more of a- secluded place." Draco raised an eyebrow and shot Pansy a glance. She was giving him the Look again. Oh, well. Better to get this over and done with; if he didn't do this now, Potter would track him down at some point and ask him then. Better do it on Draco's terms rather than Potter's.
Zabini and Parkinson, having apparently established that Malfoy would be where Harry was, listened and made a list as Hermione and Ron ran through places Harry might've gone.
Potter sighed and turned to Draco. "Please can we get Ron? It would go faster, and I'm sure you're tired of searching like this..."
The sun, having risen further, now shone a beam of light through the window; Draco rolled over his eyes fluttering open slowly. He saw Harry and his eyelids flew open, "Morning," Harry said, holding up the Stone.
He set up all the usual wards, letting people in but alerting him and identifying them, and protective wards around the ingredients and the cauldrons and the possible danger zone and himself.
"He's coming!" Blaise hissed to the group just as Draco was moved to his place. The others all fell into position, too, distracting Harry as Pansy added the finishing touch; a label that read, "
"Hopeless," Draco muttered under his breath, but Potter's bringing up loneliness had sparked an idea for him. "Say, Mr. Flamel,"
Draco hesitated, looked at the frozen ground and his frozen hands, then sighed. "Oh, all right then. Let's go get the Weasel."
They stopped off for butterbeers and a clean-up before the inevitable journey, but then they were off. It was just past three, Draco guessed, when they arrived at Gladrag's Wizardwear. Ronald and Harry were trying their best to stay behind and unnoticed (by Hermione and Pansy, at least; Harry couldn't hide from the crowd) while Pansy attacked Draco and Blaise, forcing them to the front to browse clothes. Eventually, they split up into their separate trios; the Golden trio and the Silver one.
As Draco began to make a noise of outrage and protest, Dumbledore spoke up again. "You know how the pensieve works; since Draco here is going to be doing you, specifically, such a favour with ridding you of nightmares, it seems only fair you should help him. Why don't you go into the pensieve together? Perhaps Harry could also help with the potion itself, now that he knows what you're doing for the potion and how it will be used, and also how to extract the Elixir. Go on, then. Have a look. The second rack, row three, third along from the right."
Confusion again from the group around him; Harry spoke over them. "I don't want to die." A sherbert lemon, small and round, appeared in the snitch. Harry looked down at it and smiled.
She was too far away to do anything to stop him... she watched helplessly as he hung off the window ledge with one hand, the other holding his wand. She paled as he looked down, carelessly, at the long, long fall he would have if he dropped.
They were at the base of a hill; to one side rose the great sloping side of the hill they'd rolled down, and to the other lay a- a wasteland, pretty much.
"Well, I get hyper-fixated on some things. I'll forget to do everything else, like sleep and eat, because I'm so used to just working on something, and not allowing myself any basic needs until it's done. Guess it's a habit now." Draco didn't see Potter's eyebrows shoot up. "Sticks pretty easily, too. After I first developed it, back in sixth year-" he didn't see the way Potter's body went tense and still- "I couldn't eat much except water on a day-to-day basis, 'cause my body was so used to receiving so few nutrients, getting so many from a full meal made me sick."
With a jolt of realisation- and horror- Harry realised what the look had been. Fear. Fear of Harry. And the last time Harry had seen that fear, directed towards himself- Draco had nearly bled out on the floor of the girls' bathroom.
"Room of Requirement." The idea had come to Draco last night as he's been wandering the shores of the Lake, pondering what he knew about the Stone, and he'd remembered when Potter had taken him to the Room, and changed it to how he needed it to be. Draco had moved all the plants himself, before he returned to bed- and he hadn't asked McGonagall, but he hadn't told her where he was brewing potions and growing plants before and she'd found him.
Maybe there are arguments. Maybe there are insults. But maybe, now, there are also apologies and regrets that help balance everything out.
They cross paths during work, and outside of it; at the pub, with their friends, in the park. Their friends come to like each other, and arrange for these "coincidental" meetings to keep occuring.
! Someone who read the Prophet just- just read it aloud one morning, and I heard your name, and- I basically stalked you for over a year, Draco, and old habits die hard- (I
He didn't see Malfoy's confusion as to why, when they saw the snitch, Hermione and Ron froze, then looked towards Harry to confirm it was the snitch they thought it was. All four of them watched as the snitch's surface turned and changed until it opened, revealing a small, open space where a stone once sat.
Maybe- no, he couldn't stoop that low. Preposterous! Asking for help from a- but she'd probably read every book the library held and stowed its information in her head... It would be like asking a house elf for help! They were supposed to help!
But while he was, as usual, staring morosely into the depths of the lake, half-hidden behind the emerald green curtains, he had added something to his spot. Pansy had recommended Draco try out the muggle inventions she loved- earphones or something, he thought, and so here he was sat, listening to some of her favourite music.
*(shut up, Harry, you're lucky I haven't magically erased it already)), coward, snobby, rich, daddy's boy ((okay, Harry,
"Breathe in for a count of four- one, two, three, four; now hold your breath for a count of seven- one, two, three, four, five six, seven. Now out for eight- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight." Draco was careful to keep his voice slow and steady, counting a beat for Potter. "Good. Do that twice more, thinking of your happy memory as you do." This breathing pattern released calming chemicals in the brain; it showed Potter what sort of emotion he would be hoping to provoke with Occlumency. Thinking of his happy memory as he did would hopefully associate the memory with the breathing exercise, and therefore the emotion the memory provoked as a result.
"Actually, Harry," Hermione said, "I think that that might be why." She pointed out a second group of people playing in the snow, throwing snowballs. The- the
ready to deal with this right now, not when he could feel Malfoy's gaze on him, not when his broom was underneath him and ready to go, not when he was itching for a game of Quidditch to chase away the nightmares of forests and curses and flashes of green and red, blood and death, red snake eyes and serpents and swords and a station, entirely white, empty of trains and devoid of life- Harry slipped off of his broom onto the grass, curling in on himself. He felt his breathing accelerating; distantly heard his own gasps for air. He could feel his blood, pounding through his body, could hear his heart in his ears.
"I also think- um, I mean, you should keep your hair like that," Harry added. Draco thanked him again and made a mental note to throw out every jar of hair-gel he owned so he would never be tempted to gel his hair back again.
"Yeah," Potter replied, holding out the stone for Flamel. Flamel went to inspect it and Potter snatched it back, the same way Flamel had with the Philosopher's stone earlier. "The recipe?"
Draco, meanwhile, was re-discovering Grimmauld Place- tentatively, slowly, being wary of the potentially dark artefacts that were surely scattered around the house. He went through the kitchen first, then the living room, the staircase, the bedrooms at the top. One seemed far too messy to be of the House of Black; it was full of scratch marks like the one that big brute Buckbeak had left on Draco's arm. Then again, Draco discovered a room full of pictures of someone who looked almost identical to Potter, only with brown eyes- James Potter, he supposed- and some others. The name plaque read, "
couldn't portray Potter's eyes quite right. (He'd picked it up again during sixth year, though, as a sort of coping mechanism. His skills improved drastically.) What had been entertaining for his friends to watch during this time was that Draco had often antagonised Potter just to see a certain shade of green, or to see how the light hit his eyes at specific moments; to how he talked, to his tells when he was lying to how far he went when you insulted his family (Draco knew that one from personal experience; it'd been one of the first owls he'd sent home containing a Potter Fact in first year).
Draco felt the eyes of every person in the Great Hall on him; he stood and walked out of the Hall with as much dignity as he could muster, carefully avoiding the sick. He let the doors close behind him and with a swish of his robes, he set off for the Slytherin dorm rooms, hopefully where Death would take pity on him and just kill him.
Special thanks to Yarrah for all your lovely comments! (You really motivated me to get this one done, thank you)
"So, you take a place that you know well. You're going to use this house. You start with one room of the house. We're starting here. Now, go stand in the doorway." When Potter had moved, Draco continued. "Walk around the room, starting on your left and making your way around clockwise back to the doorway." When he had finished, Draco said, "Good. Go again.
"No. Well, see, I was just- looking at the map the other night, and I saw you were down in Snape's old potions room and- well, I didn't- I just wanted to know why you were awake so late, and not in your dormitory. So I came down looking for you-"
Blaise rolled his eyes. "Of course not, Draco. You know I'm a last-minute shopper. You yell at me about it every year," he replied. Draco shuddered at the thought of leaving things so last-minute. He could
members of the relationship realised they were LGBTQ+. And maybe Harry's obsession with Malfoy would've been an obvious hint at Harry's sexuality- nope, Ron was
"So, Malfoy," Potter said. Ooh, conversation without any "er"'s or "um"'s. Perhaps Potter was finally becoming adequate at social interaction!
Beside him, Draco had fallen asleep. Harry glanced at him; his robes were in tatters (he would be angry later, when he woke up) but they seemed to have sustained most of the damage. As far as Harry could see, he was unharmed physically.
- before being knocked to the floor and pulverized by the snow. Draco sat back down with a self-satisfied smirk, sheathing his wand.
shameful that he fainted at that tiny, pathetic-looking thing; but its face as the same sharp quality of Nagini's, and its eyes hold the same bright intelligence. He shudders. "Draco, darling," Pansy begins, and
And then Potter- dense, dense Potter- seems to finally realise what this conversation is about, even if he doesn't fully comprehend how much this is frightening Draco, or why, but enough to say, "C'mon, Malfoy. She's just a grass snake. Barely the length of my forearm. She doesn't bite, promise- d'you- I could hold her while you stroked her, if you want, she wouldn't move a muscle if I told her not to-" And he looks so earnest, and that's not what Potter is to Malfoy, he doesn't look so- so
The group spent a quarter-hour or so browsing through quills; Draco learned that he would be expected to buy both Hermione

"Careful not to fall off your broom while you're looking for Potter!" Draco flipped her off over his shoulder as he strode over to the boys' dormitories to get changed.
"Now, think of your unhappiest memory. That could be something to do with Voldemort, or your nightmares; it could be sad, or angry. Imagine it in as much detail as you can, even if it hurts. This has to be your
Draco left the room for nearly the first time that night; he attended dinner. He sat at the Gryffindor table, with Pansy and Blaise and Weasley and Granger. Harry wasn't there. He ate quietly, as much as he could stomach.
Firstly, he went around the clearing, casting protective, silencing and disillusionment charms. Then, he pointed his wand at the sky and said, "
Satisfied, Pansy stepped outside of the dressing room and announced to the others that Draco had one last outfit that he'd gone all-out on. She waved her wand at the dressing-room curtains.
Draco whacked his head down onto the desk, and looked mournfully at his hand, joined with Potter's. "It takes one month to brew, approximately, and another four to sit until it's non-toxic enough to drink," he groaned. Potter groaned along with him.
He was bored, yes- there wasn't really anyone to torment, and even if there had been, Draco still couldn't. If he put even one toe out of line, he'd be sent straight to Azkaban. And everyone knew this, too; he'd expected the bullying, the harassment- all of that. Didn't help when it actually started happening; so Pansy had given Draco the earphones to occupy himself and take his mind off of things for a while.
"Sorry, Professor," he said, standing up. "I really don't know what happ-" All of a sudden, he was pulled up off his feet, in a sort of Levicorpus-type spell... But nobody had their wands out.
of Sirius Black?- "He just comes strolling in," Potter had been in Grimmauld Place?! "Ruining our home, bewitching poor Regulus' house elf, continuing to let our home fall into ruin- disgraceful, honestly! Draco, dear, you're in his year, aren't you? Could you possibly hurt him- or just immobilise him? Just a little? Just a-
The door led into a cramped stone corridor. It was dark when Harry first entered, but when Draco shut the door behind him, a small bronze sconce flickered to life, lighting the passageway with a dimly flickering flame.
Draco knew the rough concept, but he'd never actually used a pensieve before. His father had one in his office, but Draco had been forbidden to enter that room. In the moment that he hesitated, Dumbledore smiled.
Harry slowed the broom slightly, keeping pace with Draco as he fell, slowly urging the broom closer and closer and closer- he stretched his arm out, the way he did when he was trying to catch the snitch, and grabbed for Draco; he caught only a handful of robe, which tore away in Harry's hand as Draco steadily picked up speed.
Potter made his way upstairs slowly, and Draco seated himself on the living room sofa, listening to the creak of the floorboards upstairs. All the doors in the hallway at the top of the stairs were opened and shut individually; every room was given a few minutes of appreciation.
They spent about another hour telling Granger what had happened, and digging through the leaves nearer the edge of the clearing, working their way inwards.
"Take my hand!" Harry yelled at him, but the wind took the words from his mouth before he'd even spoken them. He thrust one hand out- the other still gripping the broomstick- and Draco, evidently getting the message, grabbed for Harry's hand; his fingertips brushed against Harry's, but the wind pushed them apart. Determined, Harry moved the broomstick right next to Draco, so they were side-to-side as they fell even further. The sky was almost pink.
He'd always been a bit rebellious, and Potter always made him fly off the wall; but he was here now, and his pride wouldn't let him back down, so he marched forwards, around the mini-Creevey, and faces Potter, with his shoulders squared, and waited for his silver tongue to get to work. It didn't- it really didn't. It turned to lead, and then Draco was just stood there in front of Potter, wordless, looking like a right idiot in front of what must have be a good couple of hundred people.
The place reeked of dust, grime, and mothballs. Draco set about making himself a nice cup of tea to drink while he let his mind wander- avoiding any thought of Potter or sixth year or Voldemort or- well, he thought about where he was. This old, abandoned building in muggle London, once a place of magnificent splendour, now a run-down abode devoid of life.
He spotted her hands shaking. They looked worryingly frail. Actually, she looked far skinnier on the whole- even worse than she and all the other elves had been when Voldemort stayed at the Manor. He'd insisted that elves were so below wizards, they didn't deserve food. How could Jisky have deteriorated so quickly? She'd been fine before Draco left for eighth year at Hogwarts, and Narcissa would never let a house elf- especially not one that Draco held so dear- go without food. Draco frowned.
," he said. The liquid seemed to evaporate as he spoke, turning from scarlet liquid to pink-tinged smoke of some sort. It had no identifiable smell, yet Draco was reminded of everything in life that he loved; his mother, his broom, the gardens at Malfoy Manor, hot chocolate and the smell of freshly cut grass, and Pansy's perfume and the rain and the snow and an overwhelmingly strong scent of Harry. And then... What was
He didn't notice when a few minutes later, an invisible figure hidden from his wards under a cloak, slipped out of the potions classroom, having inspected Draco's notebook where he left it after dropping off his Mandrake root clippings.
"Hey, Malfoy, you want this apple? It's green," Harry said, entering the potions classroom Snape used to basically inhabit. He watched as Malfoy's head perked up at the mention of a green apple, and tossed the apple he was holding at Malfoy, trusting that Malfoy's Seeker reflexes would kick in. They did, and Malfoy caught the apple easily, taking a bite immediately.
He purchased Hermione's quill and paperweight and dashed unseen into the only secondhand shop in Hogsmeade. He'd seen what he was looking for in here before, in a cluttered corner, tucked away, and- there! He grabbed the pensieve and bought it from the kind old man running the shop. He withdrew his memories of rehearsing and singing Weasley is Our King with the Slytherins, and the first time he'd managed to successfully conduct them through the whole song; he duplicated the memories and stored them in the pensieve. He flicked his wand and the pensieve was sent back to his dorm room, where he could cast all the spells needed to keep it in good condition properly. Then he left, returning to the Quills shop, where Ronald was just buying his quills.
"I'm going to teach you the more meditational way of using Occlumency. It's far easier than learning to defend against Legilimency, and you should only need to learn this to stave off nightmares. Also, you can use this knowledge and apply it to stronger forms of Occlumency; and should you ever need to use Legilimens on an Occlumens, you would, theoretically, know the weaknesses of Occlumency to exploit them.
glad that she is here and not his father; because with everything going on (waking up to have Potter at his side, said Potter siding with his friends against him- and all after Draco had already fainted) Draco really needed some parental love, and if his father had been here, his first question to Draco would've been something along the lines of
The war left everyone damaged. People had gone through a life-changing event, one that left them worse-for-wear. They'd lost so, so much. Most of them emerged from the war with things like PTSD, survivors' guilt, depression, anxiety, and so much more.
He took two clippings of Mandrake root, still alive and potted. To one of them, he added a few drops from one of his many batches of textbook-perfect Sleeping draughts; the other could wait a little.
! It's so wiry. It's probably really dry. Mine must be so much softer than hers, don't you think? And oh, her skin! It's so...
, Potter." He immediately set about making a new snowman, a better one; it would be the biggest snowman ever. When the head was about as tall as Draco was, he moved onto the body. He ended up having to use magic to help with that. He levitated the head up on top of the body, making sure it stayed firm, before bringing it down again. Blaise had re-emerged with hand-made hot chocolates and passed them around, keeping two aside for Harry and Draco.
He had, instead, gone straight back down to his potions room to have a look at his mandrake samplings. The one with the normal Dreamless sleep had awoken; it was writhing around again, and would be able to be reused for another test. It would be slightly altered, though; it would always want for more Dreamless sleep. Addicted to the unicorn's blood.
He turned back to Potter- still asleep, silent and still. The edges of the Resurrection stone were barely visible in his pocket. Draco could easily take it out and exchange it, but... This was
"Third year, Malfoy- Buckbeak the hippogriff." Draco glares at Potter. Now he's siding with Draco's own friends-
Even the few firsties gathered, who had only been attending Hogwarts for a couple of months, groaned with the older students, far more accustomed to Draco and how he could drone and whinge and whine and moan on and on and
"I get bored very easily. Climbing trees simply wasn't enough to occupy toddler-me. And what does my father have an abundance of? Birds. And I had been told, very explicitly, not to go anywhere near the birds. Multiple times. Now, being a toddler, I was not going to listen to that. In fact, I decided from the moment that I had been told to stay away from the birds that I would get the birds, and make them my own. I would clothe them and feed them and love them and my father wouldn't do anything about it."
She released the spells holding Draco up, and Draco was thrown into freefall. His stomach stayed at the top of the tree, but his body went hurtling towards the ground; he gripped the tree trunk, screeching, and went down with a
"About that," came a voice from behind Draco. Which was strange, because he was sat with his back to the wall, so whoever it was specifically didn't want Draco to know it was them. Unluckily for them, Draco knew their voice far, far too well for them to escape identification. And Draco suddenly understood why the hall had gone quiet. They all wanted to hear the exchange between the most prominent self-proclaimed arch-nemesi of the school. He turned around with a sigh.
It was a good ten minutes of incomprehensible joy and shouting and general jubilation before the boys were able to move onto the next step.
The cold metal was a shock, but has he pulled away the snitch unfurled its wings in his gloved hands, and the message displayed itself.
Scared for his life- and the lives of everyone else- he didn't stay to listen to the celebrations of others. He rolled out of Hagrid's arms, shot "
"I required you," Draco said again. "I was just thinking- I needed the Stone, and you have it, so I needed you, and I was thinking about how I really wanted you here, and, well... The Room knew I Required you, and so it brought you to me."
Blaise's eyes widened. "Oh. Um, I think you said something about a room down the corridor from the library?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "Alright, alright. So, yeah, Potter had a nightmare. Doesn't make him special, though," Draco added. "I had a nightmare too."
, he'd forgotten to take the Stone from Harry. Yes, he had been a little caught up with Jisky and then the dungeons, but- ugh, who knew where Harry could be? It wasn't like Draco had his Map of Hogwarts. He sunk down onto one of the plush chairs. thinking about how long it would take Harry to go to the Room and how he really, really needed the Stone.
The one with the bright yellow eyes growled; a low, menacing sound that reverberated through the ground, shaking Draco's bones. The rest of the group growled in response.
Potter blinked, then let out a quiet, "Oh." After a moment, he added, "Er- thanks, Malfoy. You didn't have to do that, but- thanks. I did talk to my parents and Sirius and everyone last night, though, but thank you."
His broom was far away from him, out of arm's reach; and though it looked a little battered and bruised, Harry could tell instinctively that it could be fixed up pretty nicely with some charms and the broom-maintenance kit Hermione had given him.
She flopped down somewhere behind him, and Draco tried to listen to her advice. To his surprise, it seemed to work. It was actually almost... Fun. He stood up, careful to stay inside his imprint, and jumped out. When he looked back, he could just about see how his silhouette was an angel; with his arms making wings and his legs making a robe of sorts. Huh.
Flamel, obviously putting up a brave facade, looked up at Potter cockily. "And just how would you do that, Potter?"
Maybe, when confronted by friends, both deny anything and everything. Maybe they don't quite believe it themselves when they deny their friends' accusations.
He'd had Harry come and sit with him, and Harry added a few more recent ones; ones that Draco hadn't even had long enough to really notice. They were far more similar than the ones he used to have, and incredibly different to how he used to be.
"Draco, you can't just- I don't know, avoid snakes forever! Look at it. It's so small- and it belongs to Potter. Who saved your life. And kept you out of Azkaban." And nearly killed me, Draco adds silently, but Pansy always could read him like an open book, because she adds, "It won't hurt you."
Draco's eyes caught on a stack of story books piled on a table next to Viv; the same books Harry had read to her before. Draco looked around, just to make sure no one was watching him, then pulled up a chair next to Viv and began reading to her in a hushed voice.
Draco nodded. "Yeah, I get it." It still stung a little to think of Crabbe; especially since that lead to his memories of the leaping fire reaching for him, and then of the look on Potter's face as he came back to get Draco; the insufferable "righteous hero" expression. Draco had never been happier to see it. He still owed Potter a life debt for that, actually. But, well, if Potter didn't bring it up, neither would he.
to-" Harry bowed his head, his back shaking, self-loathing evident in his voice- he was gasping for breath, and was that a- was he
Harry was still laughing, his eyes on the teachers, but his hand (unfairly warm after being in the snow for so long) had taken Draco's cold one. Draco felt himself melt inside; he linked their fingers and squeezed Harry's hand softly.
Potter looked up from where he was rocking the plant, and, seeing the look on Draco's face, said, "Don't. I didn't know how to keep her quiet, and she reminded me of a baby, and, well, this is a popular Muggle method for calming babies. Hey, it worked. I think she's asleep now, though, and my legs are falling asleep. Could you- help?"
He laughed as he made his way down to Draco. "Alright, alright. Look- here-" He pulled on one strip of fabric, just out of Draco's view, and the whole mess unraveled.
He took Hermione's scarf (Hermione had come prepared for the winter weather, unlike the rest of them) and enlarged it so he was barely able to lift it; then he levitated it up and wrapped it around the snowman's shoulders. He then focused the levitation on just one end of the scarf, the longer end, looping it over and under and around and through, then pulling, making a perfect knot  that sat snugly around the snowman's neck. He sat and picked up his hot chocolate as he waited for Potter to finish.
Harry had a flashback to first year, when he had been in a position similar to Draco's, while Ron was in his. What had Ron done then? Oh, yeah.
the one who managed a successful potions company, making a good, honest amount of money, ((Why is this in past tense? I'm still making loads of money, and we've only been up for a couple of years.)) who loves his mother ((My mother is a brilliant woman and if you don't like her you can fight me. Well, maybe not me. Harry, love, would you fight for me?) Well, yes, but why can't you fight? (I just got my manicure redone by Pansy a few days ago. Also, people are terrified of you, you killed Voldemort with an
She looked up at him with wide eyes, which slowly filled with tears under Draco's gaze. "Oh, Young Master Draco," she said, her voice quivering. "Jisky is so very sorry! Jisky never meant to go so long without food, but Jisky was just so worried about Young Master in Hogwarts, and Jiskey couldn't eat, not when Jisky's Young Master was away and maybe hurting!"
"See, that was also the first day I performed accidental magic. There was a lock on the birds' enclosure to stop them getting out. I managed to manifest my magic well enough to get past it and into the enclosure. Except, I never actually entered the enclosure. The birds got out.
, which then devolved into other vicious grumbles about Potter and Draco and some choice language. Draco simply smirked and looked down upon the gathering.
He smiled, still a little shaky. So far so good. "Well, not really chickens. It's just- okay, let me start from the beginning."
dominant hand free, he could do things like more precise cutting. He wouldn't shut up, though, constantly on about what was going on and what he was thinking. Still, the potion was now ready to sit and brew for three months; Draco had added the ingredient that grew only by moonlight, and he should only have to wait a while longer until he could separate from Harry.
"Well, considering how I think this will go... How about the standard "Last Man Standing" type thing? If you show up tomorrow at breakfast without alcohol poisoning, you win. Sound good?"     "Brilliant, Blaise. Other questions? Yes, you, with the freckles."
"Potter," Draco spat, the way he always did; but it was lacking in its hatred, its disgust. It sounded half-hearted, and- forced.
hate you, didn't he? If you managed that even once with that little instruction... Okay. Let's start from the basics.
Potter frowned (he did that when he was confused. He frowned an awful lot of the time). "Draco, your name means Dragon?"

(Yeah. I felt really,
They sat in silence a while, and then Draco said, "Thank you, Harry. I accept your apology. I hope you know that."
McGonagall only realised the eighth years hadn't ever reached their beds when, come the next morning, she found them all asleep in the Hall (and others passed out in the halls of Hogwarts). She told them all off sternly and watched them doze off in her class with an exasperated (but undeniably fond) smile.
Hagrid climbed out, dripping wet... And, following him, McGonagall, who looked like an angry wet cat. Both of them turned on Slughorn, who paled.
Draco, however, stood still, paralysed with fear; there were so many of the beasts, all stood high on their hind legs, growling and snarling, baring razor-sharp teeth, yellowed eyes glinting. Behind him, Potter skidded to a halt when he realised Draco wasn't with him. He turned back (his saviour complex would get him killed someday- it already had, actually), grabbed Draco's arm, and set off in a sprint again. Draco tripped and stumbled after him; he was usually fast, but he'd been taken by surprise.
Voldemort or something? Voldemort was leeching off of his soul, and he was on the back of Quirrell's head. That's why he always wore a turban- to hide Voldemort."
"They work. I used one last night, and I don't feel any addiction whatsoever, and I slept peacefully. You can trust the person." Harry met Draco's eyes. "I trust them with my life."
Pansy gave Draco a soft smile as he made sure it was okay and safe and happy. Harry didn't know how lucky he was, she shought. Draco wouldn't go to such lengths for most people. But, then again, Harry had never been like most people. Not to Draco.
And they were hugging. No, not even that. They were- they were embracing each other. Ron's eyes widened, and he said, "What the bloody-" before Hermione cut him off, slapping her hand over his mouth.
Harry thought about how he hadn't known until he was seventeen. But that wasn't his fault! In any case.
Everyone had heard about how Potter had lived as a child, before he came to Hogwarts. It'd been a scandal, pretty much, when it came out; the papers were all over the fact that muggles had mistreated
. And he realised, with a shock, that they were. Potter seemed to realise this, too, because he turned and met Draco's mortified gaze with one of his own. "Dear Merlin," Draco breathed. "What's happened to me?"
Draco realised with a start that he was smiling; this wasn't the antagonising battle of insults he and Potter had engaged in for the past seven years. This was- banter? And almost-friendly banter at that. Standing abruptly from the unbelievably comfy chair, he said, "Well, thank you for your information. I'll go ask Granger for her information and see if I can get any method of getting the Elixir of Life. Goodbye." And he stepped out of the Room of Requirement, heading towards Gryffindor tower once more.
"We have to change, to best suit ourselves to our situation; must make it reflect on us well, must make it benefit us," his mother said. Draco didn't particularly like the change. He didn't like the way that he constantly was having to change. Change his attitude, his wording, his personality, his mind.
"No! Still no! You can't make me! I refuse. You know what? I'm going to do something else. I can pull an all-nighter tonight, it's Saturday. I'll sleep tomorrow. Goodbye, you lot. Good luck trying to get me to say- that!" And Draco turned and walked down the corridor, leaving the group giggling to themselves.
Maybe tales are passed down through generations of hatred turned to friendship turned to love, and all the imperfections in between.
"Er, hi. Came to see if anyone was being tortured. Who was screaming?" he said, and Draco felt himself falling head-over-heels again; not physically, this time. More... Emotionally. Except, he realised, he'd fallen a long time ago. It was just now, looking up at Harry, that he realised. And maybe- just maybe- he now accepted it, too. But only
He wasn't perfect. But then, he never had been. He still had flashbacks, he was still dealing with survivors' guilt. He probably always would. PTSD sometimes overwhelmed him. But he got through it.
Draco didn't sleep that night; he spent the whole time reading and practicing, wandering around the Slytherin dormitories and Common rooms; then he slowly expanded his trail outwards a few corridors and classrooms.
Hermione had managed to sneak up while Harry stared, motionless, out the window at Malfoy; she sat on Ron's bed, observing. Harry dashed around the common room, looking for a latch on a window, or a handle or
Their little group did panic, but didn't spread the news. Zabini then said, "You know, we think Draco's been missing for about that long, too. Usually they're brew- er, arguing somewhere together; maybe they're together now, too."
Ron just picked up one of the long branches, fallen from the tree, and (avoiding the flailing branches of the tree) hit the knot at its base. The tree stopped moving, and Ron entered the dark tunnel, trusting Hermione to lead the others after him.
had to admit that. Ginny could make up lost time with Luna later. As Harry was explaining what had happened to Ginny, her nodding along, he didn't notice Seamus and Dean behind him, holding a timer and a little yellow post-it note.
He was holding a small part of the cauldron, and inside it was a shimmering pool of golden liquid. The Elixir of Life.
"The next step is to start adding people, for your purposes, I think," Draco told him. "You want to relax, right? Have a place you can get away to? Well, wouldn't you like your friends there? And you could add dead people- like Diggory, or Lupin, or that godfather of yours. If you know them well enough, you can add them. You could even add your parents."
He burst into McGonagall's room, barely sparing her an apology for his interruption before he whipped around to face Snape.
They went to Dogweed and Deathcap first, where Granger and Weasley spent an unbelievably long time helping Blaise pick out a plant for Neville Longbottom. After half an hour of "No, that's too bright," and "It's not deadly enough," and "Neville has 10 of those already", Draco strode forwards and picked up the plant that had first caught his eye.
His parents, however, were a candle flame next to a bonfire compared to his closest friends in terms of knowledge about Harry Potter. They'd had to listen to the smallest of facts that Draco picked up on every day for the whole seven years. But oh, Draco wasn't done. They still had eighth year to go, after all.
Draco spent quite some time continuing to test the potion; whether it was poisonous, or possibly toxic in any way at all, and if it still had the same effects when duplicated (it did, thank goodness. Draco wouldn't have to keep brewing more and more batches of it as long as he kept one vial of the original batch) before moving on to administering it to Harry and himself to check for effects from differently sized doses. It seemed to work just as well as the normal Draught- even better, if Draco did say so himself- and when their testing session was over, Draco and Harry were no more addicted to the potion than they had been when they began.
Maybe the one who was helped sends the helper a little something to say thank you. Maybe it's an album of pictures found in an old room in the Malfoy/Black estate with a note that says,
He had to say this often to Hermione; she seemed unable to accept. and always gave him a Look. Well, whether she liked it or not, it was true; Hermione could take her knowing looks somewhere else.
His plants were all in little cute plant pots of varying shades of green and turquoise, hung from little metal hooks in the ceiling on the left of the vast room. The middle was taken up mostly by rows upon rows of desks and equipment; everything Draco had ever dreamed of. To the right of the room was an incredibly large potions cabinet, full of hundreds- if not thousands- of ingredients and simple base potions.
"Oh. Yeah, but it's just mandrake root clippings. They react nearly the same as humans would; going to sleep, being poisoned, dying."
"I'm sorry for insulting your parents, your parental figures, your friends, your mentors. I'm sorry for betraying you and all of your friends by joining Voldemort. I'm sorry for- the bathroom incident. In fact, I'm sorry for all of sixth year.
Maybe they both realise how bigoted and prejudiced they were as children, and finally realise that everyone is just as human as everyone else, and everyone has their problems, and maybe the best thing to do is to just treat everyone equally; spare them one more problem.
Granger asked him how he was doing; offered to come and help. She knew Harry hadn't come to see him. She wouldn't tell Draco where he had been; only that he would probably see him soon.
!!!" did the trick) before dragging them (still half-asleep and in pyjamas) down to the Great Hall, where the eighth-years had requested a large, communal Christmas tree.
Thankfully, Potter was oblivious and thought Draco had just been listing off his attributes, not revealing all the things he'd noticed.
But he does find him, and they exchange pleasant conversation as they examine the potion. Then, a few weeks later, maybe one of them gets attacked by vengeful fans of the other; and maybe the other one's resurfaced unhealthy habits pay off because he can immediately step in and get help.
?" Draco asked incredulously. "The incompetent, stuttering fool? Who shook like a leaf every time you so much as
During the war, Harry was- well- stunning. Not absolutely perfect, but he can't have been far off. His reflexes were unbelievably sharp, honed to a point, dodging curses and hexes thrown his way like he was born for it- perhaps he was- whilst shooting back a barrage of spells (mostly
That would mean that the drinker would eventually build up a tolerance, and either have to deal with the nightmares, or use a far stronger form of sleeping potion. The stronger ones were all also ridiculously addictive, so the user would basically become an addict... All because of one ml of unicorn's blood?
Draco stepped forwards, into the reflection of the mirror. It was fractured, a spiderweb of broken lines criss-crossing the surface; a fragment of the mirror was missing, right about where Draco's eyes would've been when he was younger. Now, that spot was over his chest- over his heart.
Then, without waiting for a response, she turned and left, her heels click-clacking on the floor of the hospital wing.
The room Potter had conjured up wasn't the worst Draco had ever been in. It was decorated with neutral colours, no specific house colours featured more than any other. Two plush purple chairs were situated around a fire- a golden, glowing fire, not the terrible scarlet of fiendfyre.
Potter, who had been watching the conversation with a frown, spoke up. "Say, Mr. Flamel, when was the last time Dumbledore visited?"
There was Malfoy. Leaving the castle. Was giving his whole house alcohol poisoning not enough? Had it been too quiet for him?
"Right. Well- er-" And Potter proceeded to ask Draco what felt like a thousand questions, varying in topic and seriousness. Some were about his friends, some for his family; some were what-would-you-do-in-this-situation type questions; some were more personal, more about his thought processes and emotions. Some were about his qualities as a person; how he acted around people, how he talked to get what he wanted. Draco closed off on a couple, but had no problems with the rest, until- "What are your eating habits like?"
"I'm sorry for the fiendfyre; for the deaths of anyone who you knew and held dear. I know that not many people get affection from you... I'm sorry for those who did that are- that are dead.
Malfoy turned back to his work. "I'm insulted, Potter. Do you really think I'd let my hair get into such a greasy state?"
Potter bristled, on-edge from what Draco deduced had been a nightmare. "Well, I don't have my glasses, and we'd been attacked by bloody werewolves last I remember. Are we still in Flamel's place?"
When Harry heard this, he immediately decided he would go and check on Malfoy; after all, the last time he'd avoided his friends like this, he'd been working on getting Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Yes, he'd go make sure Malfoy wasn't planning a Vanishing Cupboard act that would end in someone dying again, that was it. What Harry was
They found they worked rather well together, in fact. Their weaknesses and strengths nicely contrasted and matched; potions and DADA they were very much terrible and brilliant at individually. They were scared and smart and hated and brave and ignorant and loved. Working together, and helping each other, they actually got the two highest grades in the year on average; on par with Hermione, who was doing even better than usual seeing as she was only coaching Ron and not Harry too. Also, Ron was excelling, now he had Hermione's sole focus. And, not having Draco and Harry being distracting every lesson, the rest of eighth year was getting better and better, too.
"Draco," Potter said, and Draco got a double shock to his system. Firstly, he'd forgotten Potter was there. He would
"Nope. Oh, look, Hermione says she's ready. C'mon, Draco." Indeed, across the Hall, Granger had stood up and was beckoning the Slytherin trio.
Harry turned to Draco smiling that special smile of his. "Thank you, Draco," he said. "Thank you so, so much."
Pansy grabbed Draco by the sleeve and tugged him along after her, even though he resisted all the way to the Great Hall doors. Just as he was leaving, Harry walked in. "Save me!" Draco cried; but Potter, useless git he is, just stood and watched Draco be dragged away to be tortured. Tortured how, you ask? Shopping with Pansy Parkinson.
, who had nearly killed him, and he didn't particularly care about Potter's opinion (he told the voice of Pansy that spoke up in his mind to object to
: The same snark and wit and dry humour of his childhood, but now with more knowledge, a wider repertoire of insults, (What's a repertoire? (Oh Salazar. Potter, I thought you left your uneducated tendencies and moronic aptitude before we go married? Wasn't it in the terms and conditions?) Err... (You didn't read the terms and conditions.) There shouldn't be terms and conditions for a marriage! It's
He skipped breakfast in the Great Hall purposefully that morning, walking his friends to the doors and bidding them goodbye just as they entered. He stepped far enough in to be seen, then turned around and made his way down to the dungeons. Straining his ears, he could only just hear the telltale scuffle of Potter grabbing up all his things and racing after Draco, and the resulting shouts of his friends after him. Indeed, after a little, Potter caught up to him in the hallways. His breathing was far too even after he'd run all that way; he was probably trying to consciously slow his breathing so as to appear more composed. The fool. Draco knew all those tricks. After all, he'd used them all multiple times over the past few years.
"Yeah, I did. Really early in the morning. I knew I wouldn't be getting back to sleep, so I came down here early."
Draco felt his hand going sticky, and then the warmth of Potter's hand seemed to increase tenfold. Draco snatched his wand with his other hand, pointed at his throat, and thought the counter-curse for the silencing charm as forcefully as he could. He then whirled on Pansy, who was now stood, triumphantly. "Pansy, you
Draco was down in his potions room, somewhat awake and sort of functioning with a Pepperup potion (or two) and a strong cup of coffee (how the muggles came up with this stuff, he'd never understand, but it was heavenly). He rolled his sleeves up, preparing for another day of work, Harry Potter the last thing on his mind for once.
"Okay. So. I saw on the- actually, it'd be easier to show you." He withdrew from his back pocket a weathered piece of parchment, yellowed and wrinkled. He opened it, and ink spread out over the pages, creating a message that read,
"Oh," Draco said quietly, quickly removing all the wards. Harry shot him a strange look, but didn't comment. His only acknowledgement was that his wand dipped. "Come on in, Jisky," Draco called a little louder. The door creaked open, and a small house-elf stepped in. Harry's wand dropped completely.
Harry flew into the air; Hermione set him down beside the imprint in the snow he'd made. "Ooh, it's a good one!"
But, yes, it was a chilly night; it made Draco long for his bed, soft and warm. He collected the Mandrake snippings drowsily; didn't really remember making his way down to the potions classroom and storing all the snippings. Next thing he knew, he was crawling into bed and falling asleep, forgetful of the nightmares lurking in the darkness of the night.
"Jisky, Jisky," he said soothingly, "Don't punish yourself. I'm not mad. C'mon, let's head down to the cellars and I'll get you some food, okay?"
Ripples spread out across the lake, and then a series of splashes preceded the arrival of something swimming to the shore.
"Well, this morning-" she began, but Draco didn't really want to hear now. If she was wearing the Look, she was surely going to try and embarrass him somehow; and, knowing Pansy, it was going to work. The hall had gone quieter- almost tense, Draco thought. Perfect opportunity to embarrass him, with the whole school listening. Thankfully, someone else cut in at that moment.
"You can almost feel it," Pansy said one morning at the Slytherin table, munching on a slice of buttered toast. "And you can definitely smell it, what with the early snow arriving and all the mince pies the elves have been making."
But for now, they are just two eleven-year-old boys in a shop in Diagon Alley, being fitted for robes. One boy is telling the other about this new world he has never heard of. A world he will one day save. And the boy before him will be there for it all.
Granger stepped forward, finally, and pulled back Weasley. The Weaslette had been detained by Lovegood, and was now eyeing Draco dangerously from the Gryffindor table, where Pansy and Blaise had seated themselves to wait for Draco to defuse the threats.
running in those. C'mon, let's go." Every single Slytherin and most of the Gryffindors watched as Draco sashayed out of the Hall, and every single pair of those eyes watched how Harry Potter didn't take his eyes off of Draco until the doors slammed shut.
"Cover me!" Potter said, and he bent down and started hissing at the snakes. In a couple of seconds, the snakes were slithering forwards; they started diving at the wolves, hissing and biting as much as they could.
"They're snowmen," Harry told him. "You make snowballs, but bigger, and put them on top of each other to make people."
"Back to stalking me, Potter?" one asks the other. They don't argue. They make small, rather awkward talk about one's family, and the weather, and one's friends, and the public and the appearances, and their jobs, and how
Potter stepped forwards, holding the stone in one hand, the other open for the recipe. Flamel passed the photo, eyes fixed on the Resurrection stone. He took it from Potter's hand almost gingerly. "Alright," he said. "That's everything. Go on, now, off you go."
She turned to face him, quiet and slow- deadly, Draco thought. Ronald must've realised the danger he was in, because he laughed nervously and moved to hide from her behind a towering tree, but she whipped out her wand and suddenly he was pulled into the air. Hermione made to stop Pansy, but Pansy levitated him into the highest branches of the tree he'd been attempting to hide behind, and Hermione sat back and laughed. Blaise joined her, sitting on the thinly-snow-covered floor, watching as Ronald attempted to get down. Draco soon joined them laughing as Weasley slipped and missed a branch, managed to grab another, and hung helplessly from the branched. He looked pleadingly at Hermione, who did nothing to help; then to Pansy, who told him defiantly, "
if he just happened to notice when Potter was and wasn't out practicing with him? He was just eyeing up-
Draco sighed. "Are we physically here, or are we like- like ghosts? Can we pass through walls and such?"
Had he left Hogwarts grounds? No, he wouldn't, it was dangerous outside of Hogwarts. With any magical beasts roaming the countryside, you never knew what you could encounter. He wouldn't leave Hogwarts unless he was really trying to escape. Why had he even run in the first place? Harry had just been asking him questions so he could add Draco to his mind palace (not that he'd told Draco that that was his motivation). He'd asked if Draco had been eating... Harry tried to recall exactly what had happened.
Draco rolled his eyes. "As if I even could. Mother would have me hanged. No, you idiot, she's my cousin, I would never. I've gotten her something she's been on about for ages, I just wanted to see how she reacts."
"Harry-" Draco said, reaching out, but Harry rounded on him as soon as he felt the brush of Draco's hand against him.
Next was a short trip into Dominic Maestro's music shop. Blaise helped Granger pick out a peculiar flute that only played when the musician was upside down for Luna, while Pansy had Draco help her pick a new violin for Blaise. She ended up entirely ignoring Draco's advice and decided on one that played like a mermaid;
Draco turned around to Blaise just in time to receive a snowball straight to his face. He sat there with the the most dangerous
Trying to save his dignity as much as he could, Draco stuck his nose in the air, brushed off his robes, and gave a snooty "Thank you." before carrying on up the hill, past a still-smiling Potter.
and then they part, rather awkwardly; but they haven't fought, and that's just about the first time that has ever happened.
Draco was on-edge; every crack of a branch or rustle of leaves not caused by himself made him tense up and glance around. Potter led the way, mostly, seeming to know exactly where he was going although they had long ago strayed from the path, but made sure Draco stayed right by his side.
Narcissa, somehow unphased by this pity-me-please story, nodded at Potter before turning back to Draco and continuing, "So, as you already know, the house elves' magic doesn't really count as magic, so they are still able to perform their previous tasks for us at the Manor. Well- so- house elves are able to disapparate, and a few of them work down in the kitchens, and so- so I came on a little- ah- supervisory visit to see how they're all doing down in the kitchens. Entirely legal," she adds, before pausing slightly to say, "technically. But your Headmistress allowed it, so I think I'm fine. I do probably have to leave soon, however; I cannot stay too long. You
He turned into quite a child at Christmas; full of energy for days before, jumping and leaping around the place, grinning from ear to ear. This Christmas was no exception. He ran down to the foot of the tree and just sat there, amongst the presents, revelling in the feel of Christmas that flowed through the air. Ron and Hermione had been eating at one of the tables; Blaise and Pansy approached them with murmured greetings and tired smiles. Hermione gave Pansy a sympathetic look when Ron bounded over to Draco; apparently he was a fellow Christmas-lover.
He went tumbling down the side of the hill, distantly noting that it was night here as the sky and the ground blurred together in an indistinguishable mess of muted colours and grass.
"I am so, so sorry about this," he brushed his hand over where Harry's scar was, raised skin on his forehead, "And I know I couldn't have done anything to stop it, but I should've known it was terrible to be you. I'm sorry for being envious of your fame, I'm sorry for wanting what you have. I'm sorry for this, too," he said, brushing his fingers over the raised skin on Harry's hand that he received from detentions with Umbridge. "I'm sorry for the Inquisitorial Squad; and the DA; and for your Godfather. I'm sorry for hating the Weasleys because they loved you, and they showed it. I'm sorry for- I'm sorry for everything from the past seven years, pretty much," he finished, looking away and playing with his fingers.
While attached to him, he had gained a certain sort of... fondness for him, though. He was such an idiot, so oblivious... Actually, no, that was just annoying. But he was far better as a friend than he was as an arch-nemesis.
"Don't get on Draco's bad side," Draco said boastfully. They'd arrived at the square arrangement of the tables, and sat next to each other.
She looked up at him, surprised, then turned back to the make-up with a grin that seemed to stretch from ear to ear.
In the living room, Potter had lit the fireplace, and was carelessly brushing away the ashes he must've brought in. Draco settled himself against the wall; stood, and close to the door, so he could escape if things got nasty. He suspected that they would; he was pretty sure, seeing the look on Potter's face, that he knew what they were going to talk about.
Malfoy made his way up the stairs, oblivious to Harry's unbelieving expression. When he was nearly at the top, he turned back to see Harry, gaping up at him. "Nice view, Potter?" he whispered. Potter's mouth snapped shut and he started hissing something at Malfoy, stepping up onto the staircase-
"Still," Pansy adds appraisingly, "Very cunning- very, very cunning. You analysed Draco's reaction, predicted his answers, and entirely changed your approach to antagonise him into doing what you wanted." She pauses, as if really realising how that is a
A gorgeous dark green ball gown with black tulle, skin tight till the waist, where it flooded out into a poofy bell-like shape, with a short train at the back. It had shimmery full-length sleeves of a sheer satin-like material. The neckline was an Elizabethan Collar, clearly showing Draco's collarbones and the pale expanse of his neck.
Draco, however, was stuck. His eyes wouldn't move from the spot Dumbledore had implored him to join the Light; his mind wouldn't move from the moment.
"Have I ever told you I sued someone as a toddler? Yeah, It's related. So, imagine. I was about- what, three? Four? And I was playing around in the gardens while my mother gardened and my father worked in his office.
the sweet, caring side of Draco Malfoy, who is shown to Harry always and occasionally to sick or sad friends in need of comfort, and very occasionally his family. No one else. (And if you so much as entail that this part of him exists, he will not hesitate to rip your vocal cords out.)
They are both children born in the midst of a war, born of parents following someone who shares their beliefs; a
"How do you even plan to get the resurrection stone?! Wait, scrap that. How do you know it even works?"
The next three months passed in a blur. There were fights, obviously, and smaller arguments, and even one near-duel; a few jelly-legs jinxes, too, but most against common enemies of the boys.
"Right, ready?" Hermione asked him once the group had gathered. She was taking Ron in a Side-along, while Parkinson and Zabini went together. He gripped her hand as the sickening feeling of apparating washed over him.
I dressed? I put the rest of you lot to shame.) Nobody else was with you enough to notice, we all hated you. (...I suppose.))
He loved the way that flying now, at night, the stars and the moon were the only light, bathing the world in an effervescent glow. He loved how his heart beat like a drum, pounding through his veins.
Pansy started it as a game just for her, to try and entertain herself while letting Draco talk about what he wanted to- Potter. Blaise quickly caught on and joined in, and soon the rest of the Slytherins did, too. Occasionally, even Snape would give prompts on how to antagonise Draco into talking more whenever a group of Slytherins were getting close to beating the record.
It was a full moon that night. The sky was littered with a thousand stars; pinpricks of light in the darkness. There were no clouds; the sky was clear. The air was cold and crisp and clean.
bed. He could only barely see, though- he was almost blinded by sunlight streaming in through the window. "Morning," Harry said. He lifted up his fist, blinding Draco further as the light glinted off of something in his hand. Something... red. Red like the sky he remembered escaping. The realisation of what it was hit him like that punch from Granger in third year.
He loved how- oh, Merlin, there was Malfoy. His platinum-blonde hair was easily distinguishable from the rest of the dark night. He looked rather delicate, so pale and pretty on his broom, hovering above the Quidditch pitches. He looked so... relaxed. He hadn't seen Harry yet, then.
"But... why should I? This won't benefit me in any way. I'm only a memory now- literally. I am in the history books, I don't need money, I'm safe and happy... Why should I help you?"
The astronomy tower itself was a struggle. The two just froze as soon as they reached the top of the staircase, looking at the place Dumbledore had fell. Potter- shoot, Harry- moved first.
"Thank you, Jisky," Draco said. "I'll probably be gone until Christmas this time- not quite as long as before- but I'll be fine. Really. You just keep eating, okay?"
Pansy slipped Draco ten galleons with a grumbled sound of indignation and something that sounded suspiciously like,
He rolled up his sleeves and started to walk forwards, preparing himself to have to push people to get to where Potter was still stood in the middle of the group, and was rather surprised when people leapt out of the way. He was about a third of the way to Potter when he noticed the way people would always look at his arms before moving; he was nearly at Potter when someone stood up to him.
Potter and Granger took turns explaining the story to Weasley as they made their way down to the forest again. Draco's
"Er- yeah, I did. But, well, we need it as a bargaining chip against Flamel for the Philosopher's Stone, and we need help to find it. So... Help?"
"You can't be here!" shouted a good ten people, while others shouted some form of agreeal or "Get away!"
The tips of Potter's mouth twitched upwards. "Yeah. That guy. So it turns out, he was- I don't know,
He sighed, resigning himself to making another derivative of the Dreamless Sleep Potion when he remembered the train of thought he'd had earlier.
Potter grinned; a sly grin, like he'd won already and he knew it. "Well, he's now a portrait; you could hang him up on your wall, keep him with you."
Eventually they reached a small clearing; the leafy canopy still hung heavy overhead, letting only little bits of moonlight shine through. A ring of trees surrounded the area. When Potter confirmed that the stone would be somewhere here, Draco let him start looking while he cast spells.
The old man smiled. "Yes, I can see you. Potter, eh? By any chance, would that be James Potter? You match his description quite well... Oh, wait, no, there was another one, wasn't there? Found my Stone and so I had to give up the Elixir. What was his name? Hagrid? No... H... Harry?"
too familiar. Harry was pretty sure he had spent countless hours staring at this very snitch. Just to be sure, he pressed his lips against it.
Two eleven-year old boys meet in Madame Malkin's Dress Robes shop, both shopping in preparation for the upcoming school season. One has a messy nest of black hair, dark, warmly toned skin flecked with faint freckles and there's a pale, raised scar of a lightning bolt crackling across his forehead over strikingly bright emerald-green eyes. He's nervous; his eyes flicker all around the shop, and his expression is painted with a mixture of emotions; shock and disbelief and wariness and utter awe.
He refused to look at Pansy and Blaise, although he could feel their triumphant gazes burning a hole in the side of his head. Nevertheless, he had a task to complete.
"Firstly- may I assume you are Nicholas Flamel?" The man nodded. "Okay, thank you. So, the war is over, as you guessed. We both played rather big roles in the war; so did many of our friends.
He lowered himself to the ground. He kept up the glamours, the concealment charms that hid the little cylinder of space he used to practice this stunt, but added some silencing charms, around his little bubble of space as his feet touched solid ground.
Meanwhile, down in McGonagall's class, Harry felt the strangest tug at the back of his head. He shook his head to clear it, then continued on the essay he was writing.
Draco and Harry stayed asleep at Grimmauld Place for far too long. They slept until the sun had set and then risen again, and through most of the next day, too. They were undisturbed in that time- well, nearly.
Draco had decided he would make the Stone down by the Lake. He levitated all his plants and potions, all except Viv (who he carried), down to the spot Harry went when he had nightmares. He sort of hoped Harry would be there already, or would come down later.
Harry met Draco's eyes with a soft smile and mouthed, "Thank you," at him. Draco grinned. He wasn't done yet... But now wasn't the time. He decided to give Harry his second present at midnight; two hours from now. Most of the people gathered would still be awake, undoubtedly; Draco just hoped that Harry would be.
and said, "Don't worry about me. I couldn't even begin to tell you half the rules I've broken for people I love; and if I still had a mother when I was in Hogwarts," he adds a little more quietly, "I'd want her to do anything she could to see me after i was injured. Even if that meant breaking the law."
Maybe the friends figure it out. Maybe they start going to extra measures to get the two together. Maybe it's a little more awkward between them now. Maybe it's an improvement.
And the snake- still unrestrained, still free- slithers towards Draco slowly; he bends down, lets the barest tips of his fingers brush across its body. It rises, head arching up to meet Draco's arm, and Draco freezes. The snake doesn't stop, though- it keeps going until it is entirely wrapped around Draco's forearm- Potter was right, it really couldn't be longer than his forearm- and Draco is shaking and tense and
"Well, what can I say," he said, starting to smile. "Common sense. Beats talent, skill and pure dumb luck every time."
"I believe I've found the solution- the unicorn's blood. I believe the blood, instead of cursing the drinker, makes them addicted to the potion. But the unicorn's blood also counters the fatal bits of the potion. I took the unicorn's blood out to remove the addictive attributes, but I can't find anything stronger to replace it to keep the drinker alive... And so I went to the smartest girl in our year for help." Potter gave Draco a strange look.
Draco decided that he'd spend a week supervising Potter and accustomising him to the plants, and if, after the week was up, Potter appeared competent enough to not kill his plants when he wasn't there, he would comply with Potter's idea of splitting the care of the plants. McGonagall gave her permission after a glance at Draco's tired eyes and demeanor, and it was settled.
A wicked smirk came upon Pansy's face. "Well, this is where it gets interesting. See, the game revolves around our beloved Draco here-" she pulled him from the edge of the clearing, where he'd been lurking on the fringes of the crowd, and to her side, where he was met with cheers and amicable groans- "and his well-known crush on one Harry James Potter."
about magic and wizards much at all. I'm sorry for everyone who died-" Draco's mask dropped, because this was completely absurd; how were
When the sun's rays began to finally peak over the hills Draco and Potter had descended from, Draco decided enough was enough. He'd lost count of how many wards he'd cast; his eyes ached from observing the same landscape over and over. His skin prickled from the cold, his lips had long ago turned numb, and his fingers seemed frozen in a tight grip on his wand. Still, he hadn't left his position by Potter's side the entire night.
gossip by socialising with lions, and we can also get on McGonagall's good side about all that inter-house friendship stuff. Besides, it's boring without you, and the Golden Trio were missing their dear Potter while we mourned our loss of you. So we grouped together."
"Alright, Potter. Lead the way." He grabbed another apple- green this time- for the journey, and put another in his expanded potions satchel. And it was a
The Golden Trio had somehow ended up in front of Draco when the students were picking seats. Well, not really. They'd arrived late to the class and the seats in front of Draco were the only ones left unoccupied (no one else was brave enough to sit in front of Draco, which he'd decided to take as a compliment). Now, Granger (sat in front of Blaise, a table over on Draco's left) stuck her hand up and asked, "Miss,"- Draco noticed the distinctly missing title of "
But, Potter, with his utter lack of decorance or etiquette or manners or just general awareness of others' emotions, kept going. "I bet it gets a little lonely here, right?"
Draco turned, very slowly to face Potter, McGonagall's words ringing in his head. Look like parents.
Draco noticed, as he watered his plants again, that his thoughts continued to drift to what he'd said at Grimmauld Place. He noticed that now, when he thought Harry, he thought of Harry; not Potter or anything else. Just Harry.
The cellar looked... strange, to say the least. Almost out-of-place, with its fresh-produce-lined shelves and small wooden cubby-holes. It was empty when Draco and Harry entered, but elves quickly started apparating in to take some food; just a loaf of bread or a block of butter and then
Maybe their friends stand back, now, and watch with smiles as the boys learn and reconcile and begin to finally open up- truly open up- with one another.
Draco's head shot to him, his body tensing instantaneously, his hand already beginning to reach for the floo powder. He saw the look of hurt in Potter's eyes, the way his posture sagged and his movements halted entirely, and slowly let himself relax and look away again. He was safe. He was safe. He was safe.
Potter rubbed over a faint scar on his hand- the way rubbed at his scar he did when someone mentioned Voldemort. Remembering how he received it. "Yeah, there. Merlin, I
Having spent the past seven years watching Malfoy's actions closely, analysing his every move, Harry was slightly concerned when Malfoy didn't show up to breakfast the day after he and Harry had retrieved the recipe for the Philosopher's Stone; when he brought it up to Hermione, however, she gave him that knowing Look again and said, "Harry, the war is over. He's not up to anything," and Harry nearly said,
Evidently Potter had been to see his home; he recognised the place immediately. He walked hesitantly into the room, brushing his fingers lightly over the furniture and the books. He wandered into the kitchen, out of Draco's sight, and Draco heard the creak of a cupboard being opened, followed by Potter's soft gasp. Potter emerged a few minutes later, and Draco pretended he didn't see the tears glistening on Potter's cheeks.
Draco had awoken the next morning with Harry Potter curled up in his arms. He had panicked, remembering everything he had said the night before, and carefully extracted himself from Harry's arms. He'd flooed back to Hogwarts in a state of mild panic, ignorant of the disappointed stares of his friends- and Harry's- at the fact that he'd returned alone.
, then. Draco schooled his face into the indifferent Malfoy Mask he had perfected over the years. He feared what his face would show if he didn't.
"Now, take your five objects. In your mind, starting at the doorway, make your way around the room again; as you do, place your five things. Go around the room again. Make sure you know those objects, and where they are. Always walk the same path past them to remember them best.
"Yeah. Hey, what do you guys think we'll get this year? I hope I get something good... Last year I just got clothes."
"Potter, shut your obnoxious mouth. You're going to give Draco a heart attack. Now, what's this about needing the resurrection stone?"
!" Harry said. The loaf of bread Draco had been trying to get floated down off the shelf and onto Jisky's table.
Draco huffed, acting wounded, and said, "Excuse me! Potter and I can absolutely have a decent conversation. Especially in public."
"Oh, Young Master Draco," she said, "Jisky is so glad you called on her. What can Jisky do for you?"
"Weasley, I haven't done anything. Potter's probably rocking plants to sleep as we speak and reading them stories. He's fine. Go check on him if you want; you know where he is. He offered, himself, to take care of my plants I need for my project so I could sleep and eat and all that other mundane stuff necessary for living. Terribly inconvenient, but we all need to do it. In any case, he's fine. Say, Granger, how are you?" he added.
Once Draco had returned to his dormitory, having successfully taught Potter how to calm his mind, he started thinking.
Whatever Harry had been going to say was gone; he secured his snake around his arm and followed Draco out of the room, both of them running through the halls to reach the Room of Requirement.
was inside. From his experience, it was just dust and spiderwebs, anyway. It wasn't until they'd seated themselves as they usually did- Ron and Harry sat facing the far side of the Hall, the Ravenclaw and Slytherin Tables, with Hermione opposite them facing the Hufflepuff table, that Harry even noticed anything was wrong. "Guys, does it seem- quieter than usual?" Hermione asked.
"Not by choice, trust me," Draco said. "And I advise you to get lost before Pansy sees you or you will also be pulled along for clothes shopping."
Draco was so distracted by his thoughts, he didn't fully register everything Blaise had said until he reached the Room of Requirement. Then he turned and bolted back down the corridors, leaping down the stairs to McGonagall's classroom; he burst in and grabbed Blaise, hauling him outside by the tail of his robes.
Blaise, Ron and Hermione had waited for the trio; they'd stopped on the grassy- well, snowy now- area next to the Black Lake. Ronald was lying down on the snow, spreading his arms and legs at the instruction of Hermione, it seemed; Blaise was watching and adding commentary. When Draco got within hearing range, Blaise said, "We're making snow angels!"
Draco looked over at the cat again, remembering that McGonagall was a- what was it called? An animagus. She'd shown their year her cat form multiple times over their time at Hogwarts.
She reached out a hand, but before she so much as touched him, the door swung open of its own accord, and Harry went flying out of it.
"I have another present for you," Draco told him as he opened the door. Harry shot him a surprised glance and made his way into the classroom to open it. It sat on the nearest desk, wrapped carefully with air holes poked in the top.
Maybe he is the first person, with his recklessness and his persistence, to break through the other boy's impenetrable shield.
After that, Draco, Ronald and Pansy travelled to Scrivenshaft's for quills while Hermione and Blaise went off to Tomes and Scrolls to buy books and other such presents. "Bet you a galleon 'Mione will bring back at least three books that she's bought for herself," Ronald muttered to Draco.
By this time, the students had grown slightly used to the biggest nemesi of the school going around hand-in-hand, so Draco and Harry had started eating in the Hall again.
The Slytherins at the far back of the classroom; a mix of the few Hufflepuffs and then the Gryffindors sat in front of them; and the Ravenclaws crowded together at the front of the classroom.
Pansy gave Blaise a triumphant look. "Pay up, darling, pay up." As Blaise reluctantly gave her a few galleons, she said, "Honestly, Draco, you disappear for a week, then you steal Potter from the Gryffindors, and you don't even say hello?"
," he added with a sigh, "I suppose I can tell Potter. Come along, then. I'll tell you what I'm doing if you tell me about the Stone." He started to walk away, but paused. "Do you know anywhere more... private? I don't really know anywhere fully secluded-"
When he had finished with the physical layout of his house and was able to recall every room and the items within it as quickly as Draco could think of them, Draco deemed him able to move on.
, she was going to say. She knows about how Draco had to live with the madman for so long- knows the torment, the punishment he had to endure during that time.     She turns to Potter. "You didn't- Potter, do you have the snake on you? Right now?" Potter nods his affirmation, makes some weird motion with his mouth, too quiet for Draco to hear, and the snake crawls out of his hair and onto the bed. It's tongue flickers out of its mouth, its eyes blinking in the light. From behind Pansy, Draco observes it more calmly.
Malfoy smirked. "Yes. So, McGonagall gave me leave to attend the plants instead of attending lessons."
After a few minutes of Potter getting increasingly uncomfortable and Pansy getting more and more amiable with the Gryffindors, she spotted Draco. She said her goodbyes and made her way over to Draco.
She must've seen the aghast expression Draco wore, because she immediately said, "Jisky is being very very sorry, Master Draco! Jisky will just punish herself-" she went to pick up a book (
"Er-" her gaze flickered to Draco. "Well, um, I can't say, they asked us to keep their identity a secret."
"Mr. Malfoy, you have been caring for these plants for over a week now, staying up at night for them and everything, I believe, quite akin to how a parent would."
His brain didn't register that he was attacking Draco, not Wormtail, until he had Draco up against the stone wall; at some point he'd disarmed Draco, and was now holding his wand against Draco's throat.
His first impression of the place was that he was safe. A strange thought, especially to have while in Malfoy- Draco's company. It was made only stranger by the fact that Harry felt safe
They'd eventually won the war. Bloody, beaten, and bruised, but victorious nonetheless. Mourning friends, mourning families, but alive. They wondered if they'd rather be dead.
! Like two parents looking after their child! Oh, this is brilliant. Pomona, Albus and Severus all owe me twenty galleons each!" She declared, leaving the room still laughing, unaware of the two mortified boys she'd left behind.
Draco had always been good at telling stories. His parents and friends had marvelled at how skilled he was at weaving pictures in the air with simply a couple of words; he could make you feel as if you were in an entirely different world. It got better when Draco had been there when the story unfolded; it was even better when it was about Draco himself. After all, Draco didn't love anything as much as he loved talking about himself. Even if Pansy did disagree and gave him the Look.
Pansy had been the one to set the previous record, and at just half an hour she was struggling to keep concentrated and focused on her goal.
reasonable that Draco immediately stiffened- Potter flinched back in surprise- and Draco took the moment to bolt out of the Room like a frightened bunny.
Oh, Merlin, Draco knew that mistletoe. It was the same mistletoe Pansy had enchanted, way back in third year, trying to get Draco to kiss someone. If you walked under it, it would hold you in place until you kissed someone. Draco had managed to avoid it... Up until now. But looking at Harry... Well, there were worse people to get stuck under magical mistletoe with. But that didn't mean Draco would give in to Pansy's antics, even if he maybe (sorta (
Pansy took a deep breath to calm herself, then stepped back to observe. "You're right. How about..." She flicked her wand, and Draco felt his hair fall loosely around his head; it was the soft, fluffy texture it had been when Pansy had called him adorable. He went to protest, but she wasn't done. "Sit," she told him, and advanced, pointing her wand at his face. He froze, knowing how badly this could go. But he trusted Pansy. "Close your eyes," she murmured. He did, and felt a wash of magic over his face; soft like feathers, smooth like silk, gentle as a breeze. Pansy stepped back. "Perfect," she said. Draco turned and looked in the mirror.
He spent the next day locked away, too; he knew he was fixating on this, completely ignoring anyone and anything else.
Now, that knowledge was paying off; as the leader of the pack advanced rapidly on the pair, it seemed to pause for a second, thrown off by Draco's repellent charms.
One boy wins his life; the other loses everything but. At a court hearing, the winner stands up for the defeated. Speaks of how they both saved each other's lives. He rescues him from his own mistakes. The defeated boy is set free. Once the trial is over, he seeks out the boy who saved him.
At this point, they'd reached the entryway to the Room. Potter stepped forwards and paced back and forth three times, muttering something under his breath. On his third passage, a door appeared in the wall. Potter stepped forwards and opened the door. "After you."
"So, um, I was trying to make a - a potion that can fix that. I got permission from McGonagall, and I'm using Snape's old classroom and his ingredients. I'm just experimenting, but..."
There was one large, flat rock that Potter sat down on. Draco would not sit on a rock. Not as a Malfoy, a pure-blooded, skilled wizard. He transfigured a leaf into a plush chair, and took a seat on that. "So, um," Potter began.
wanted by the other boy. Maybe years of studying how the other thinks, moves and acts pays off when they see the reactions of the other.
Harry wasn't concerned when Draco suddenly became alert and anxious. He didn't even notice. Maybe he could learn to, over time.
Ginny, however, was very awake, sat talking with Luna in the corner of the common room. How she'd managed to sneak her girlfriend in-
", while Harry opened his Quidditch set from Ron. Both the Golden Trio and the Silver Trio received knitted jumpers  from Mrs. Weasley (Draco nearly cried) because, as Ron said, "C'mon guys, did you really think Mum was gonna let you out of sweaters now you're a part of our group? No way!"
"Neville, it's 'Bumpernuggets'. Honestly, this is the third time this week!" Harry shouted at the portrait.
Draco didn't ask why Harry hugged him or thanked him. He didn't want to get into that. He just stood and said, "Come on then, Harry. I need to make sure Jisky actually ate her sandwich."
McGonagall smiled and rolled her eyes. "Alright, alright. How do we know this person is trustworthy? How do we know these potions work?"
Harry threw an arm around Draco's waist, and let go of the broom. He held himself firmly against it with his legs, pulling Draco towards him and helping him onto it.
Viv still hadn't calmed down by the time Draco and Potter had reached the Potions room. It took half an hour of both boys fussing over her to get her to calm down. When she finally stopped crying, Potter sank down into the rocking chair, looking utterly exhausted. Draco remembered what Weasley had said earlier.
Granger threw down her wand. "I don't know what it is! It just won't work. Maybe 'cause it's a Hallow? I don't know. Sorry, Harry. We're going to have to do this the hard way."
"Draco, when was the last time you ate?" His voice was inquisitive, calm- but Draco had analysed Potter's every move for as long as he could remember.
Draco let Potter take a day to familiarise and memorise his childhood home, storing each room in his mind palace, each room having the five main objects within it. Draco took this time to tend to his plants and to the base potion that would, hopefully, produce the Philosopher's stone.
It's the voice she uses when she's trying to get him to face his fears. His response comes before she's even finished her sentence. "No." Firm, deliberate- his voice doesn't even waver. Draco takes a moment of pride in himself.
!)) make up for the mistakes of his childhood, ((Alright, yeah, I sucked.) I Like this bit though. This is when you sent out those 8-bloody-page-long apology letters, isn't it? (I had a lot to apologise for.) Well, they worked, if this is anything to go by.) who worked hard and did well ((Damn right I did.))
"Well- the stairs let Malfoy up but not me, so he had to go wake you. Now, because now is when we decided we needed you. We need you because you know what Malfoy's doing and somewhat trust him, also trust me, and know about the Resurrection stone."
Draco turned around and saw that she had moved the snowmen, rearranged them so that they looked towards Hogwarts, with their wood-arms... Oh. They were holding hands.
Potter watched them go, frowned, turned fully around, and asked Draco, "What's the incantation for the sticking charm, again?"
day he woke up early without prompting; finding that he was the only one awake at- he cast a quick Tempus- 6:30 am, he quickly awoke his Blaise and Pansy (he found that a
Their jaws dropped open, their eyes widening comically. Then Malfoy shut his mouth with a snap, turned away, arms crossed, scoffing, while Flamel continued to look at Harry in amazement.
Draco, who had been calming down with Occlumency tips from Severus, immediately lost any regained composure as he screeched, "You had the
Kreacher tilted his head to the side. "Master Potter is currently in Grimmauld Place's living room. Would you like me to take you to him?"
And then Harry remembered why he was out here- it was a good stress reliever after a nightmare, but apart from that, Malfoy was up to something. That got harder and harder to believe, though, as Harry drifted closer.
"'Course not, Malfoy. Just thought- you being you- you wouldn't have done anything this year to be called into McGonagall's office, so you wouldn't know the password, so you'd be stuck waiting out here for ages. She's in there at the moment and probably won't come out till it's time to eat. It's 'Sherbet Lemon' now. She was feeling rather sentimental when she set it." As Potter spoke, the gargoyle made a scraping, screeching sound of stone against stone- why were the Hogwarts floors all stone? So cold, so
Harry took a long breath in, then seemed to deflate. "Alright, then. You say, 'I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,' to open it; you say 'Mischief Managed' to close it. Be careful, please."
more important," Ron said. Hermione's jaw dropped open. (That was sort of insulting. So what if Ron loved food? Harry was his best mate! Although, if Hermione reacted like this to him choosing Harry over food, maybe he needed to prove it a bit more.)
Harry seemed to realize it before Draco did. He grabbed Draco from behind and pulled him down onto the floor as the cauldron rattled and hissed... And exploded.
Draco opened the door again, walking confidently up to McGonagall and asked, quietly, "Are there any rooms near the library? Any at all?"
Perhaps it was his heroic streak that refused to allow anything to die, but he seemed to almost intuitively know what the plants needed and when; a few days into the supervision, Draco actually left the plants with Potter to go and eat lunch with his friends. When he returned, the plants were quiet, and Potter was sat in- was that a
Potter stood a little to Draco's left, watching the old man. Draco stepped further into the room. As he did, the old man turned around. "Ah, so Albus finally sent someone through. Hello. Who are you?"
He opened his eyes, to make sure he wasn't sat backwards on it or anything, saw the ground hurtling towards him at an alarming rate (
"Draco," he said softly. "Draco, I think I know what that is." He frowned at Harry. Yes, the voice was definitely coming from behind him; but Harry was stood in front of him. He turned around, and discovered there were five Harrys here.
was why he fell with his eyes closed for the majority of the time; when you saw the ground coming at you, you were liable to freeze up in fear. Draco knew this from experience. Madame Pomfrey hadn't been at
As Potter settled away from the fire on the floor next to a seat, he gestured for Draco to join him. Draco did, after a moment of deliberation; only he sat next to the fire and floo powder. Just in case. He realised, very quickly, how hot he would get in his robes, sat in such close proximity to the blazing fire. He shrugged off his robes, and, after a moment, his jumper. As he did this, his white school shirt (silk, obviously) slipped up; he knew this from Potter's sharp inhale.
So he ignored the mistletoe, standing back up again, and said to Harry, "You'd better not set that mob on me when we get back in."
Harry looked down at the floor, scuffing his shoes along the floor. Was he blushing again? "You- you should really wear make-up more often, you look astonishing," he whispered.
"Y'know- sixth year, the astronomy tower," Potter begun. Draco glanced aside, folding his arms defensively, but Potter blustered on. "Dumbledore had possession of the Elder Wand at that moment in time. To own the Elder Wand, you have to defeat its previous owner."
Even before the war, Harry was damaged; the Dursleys had abused Harry in so many ways, leaving him physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred. Even now, after killing the Dark Lord, he would subconsciously flinch when someone raised their hand at him, expecting to be hit. People noticed, of course, but never mentioned it; Harry's friends would scowl and mentally curse the Dursleys for what they'd done.
He made the movement with his wand and a few moments later, the doors opened again; a small, red-orange stone flew into Harry's palm. "Here you go, Malfoy," he said. "Now, I'm off to the infirmary to make sure I didn't accidentally sustain any injuries."
"You're too stiff," Hermione told him. "Loosen up. Relax. If you're worried about your clothes getting wet or rumpled- well, we're magical. We have drying charms and ironing charms. Have some fun, Malfoy."
